 It’s hard to know who the audience might be for the documentary oddity “Kurt Cobain About a Son,” but I bet its subject, the guy who’s still being called on to entertain us even after his death, would have hated it.  Directed, if that’s the right word, by A J Schnack, the film weds about an hour and a half of  audio interviews by the journalist Michael Azerrad  with a stream of pretty visual images of places and unidentified people shot in and around where, for much of his too-short, 27-year life, Mr. Cobain lived, loved (if never enough, it seems), labored, played guitar, shot heroin and created beautiful, angry, popular music with the other members of Nirvana. In standard narrative fashion, these words and pictures have been shaped into three vague acts,  named after the Washington cities —  Aberdeen, Olympia and Seattle — most associated with Mr. Cobain or at least most familiar to those who live outside the state.  If you’ve read the articles and seen the movies about Mr. Cobain, you will recognize most of the details: the caring aunt, the nice teacher, the gay friend, the distant father, the stupid people, the cool artists and one wild chick. Mr. Cobain, sounding alternately friendly, guarded, bored, tired and, at times, slurred, was at this stage in his life well practiced in the art of self-creation. He was weary with fame by the time of the interviews; many were recorded at night at one of his homes, and were conducted from December 1992  through late March 1993, about a year before he died. Mr. Azerrad amassed more than 25 hours of interviews, eventually using them for his 1993  book, “Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana.”  “Kurt Cobain About a Son” doesn’t add much to the picture many of us carry around in our heads (and hearts) of its subject, and it certainly can’t begin to explain why this wondrously talented, delicate creature decided to shoot himself in the head with a shotgun in early April 1994. Hearing Mr. Cobain talk about shooting himself with a shotgun, as he does several times in the film, doesn’t add a thing to our knowledge; it’s painful to hear, even now. Mostly, it feels intrusive and disrespectful. Nobody forced Mr. Cobain to talk about himself, of course; at the time of the interviews, he was trying to clean up his and his wife’s image. (You hear Courtney Love briefly, at one point.) It didn’t work. And then he died.

Impressionistic docu "Kurt Cobain About a Son" is a counterpoint to the iconic late Nirvana rocker's legacy. Narration is composed entirely of excerpts from interview tapes Cobain made a year before his April 1994 suicide, while visuals are evocative latter-day shots of the three Washington State locations he inhabited during his short lifespan. Some fans will find the approach (which avoids Nirvana music and perf footage) too arty and indirect; but others will welcome the specialized theatrical release and the subsequent DVD.
Extensive audio interviews, recorded for Michael Azerrad's book "Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana," find Cobain alternately skittish and revealing, airing contradictory feelings about fame, his band, and just about everything. (Spouse Courtney Love, however, gets nothing but praise.) A happy child until his parents' divorce, he struggled with manic depression, chronic spinal/ stomach pain and general misfit status before finding an outlet in music. But the intrusion on his private life brought by success seemed too great. Abetted by Charles Peterson's B&W grunge-scene photos, Wyatt Toll's color lensing strikes a meditative tone. Original score and well-chosen songs by other artists flavor the thoughtful package. Pic was shot in 35mm but exhibited in HD at Toronto.

Pity the fool hired to scribble the DVD-jacket copy for Kurt Cobain : About a Son the film sounds horrific on paper. It's a 92-minute experimental documentary about the endlessly lionized "alternative" icon that doesn't include a guitar lick of his music, a testimonial from anyone personally acquainted with the man, or even Cobain's likenessthat is, until the final scene. Plus, the film's director is A.J. Schnack, whose most notable credit is a rock doc about They Might Be Giants . It's like entrusting James Dean 's legacy to a Don Knotts  biographer. Never mind that the producer is fond of saying, "The whole idea of this film is not to look back  at Kurt, it's to look into  Kurt." Rape me, my friend.
In truth, the film doesn't seem exploitive at all. Producer Michael Azerrad was Kurt's friendat least as much as Truman Capote  was a confidante of Perry Smith 's. In the early '90s, Azerrad extensively interviewed the generational lodestar for the authorized biography Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana  , a project that left the New Yorkbased reporter with 20-something hours of Cobain on tape. Schnack, who'd met Azerrad while working on his aforementioned TMBG debut, edited the audio into a kind of narration. About a Son  is essentially a dead rock star talking about his life for an hour and a half, andhere, jacket-blurbers!it's deeply moving.
If Cobain's death is the 9/11 of the modern-rock canonan epochal tragedy that recklessly opportunistic minds have flattened into a sad, one-dimensional cartoonthen Gus van Sant 's tedious and arrogant Last Days  is the World Trade Center   of the posthumous Kurt industry: a fictionalized piece of shit by a big-name director. (And Nick Broomfield 's Kurt & Courtney  is the Fahrenheit 9/11 .) "I started to feel like Woody Allen  in Annie Hall  when he's waiting in that line, listening to that guy pontificate about Marshall McLuhan ," explains Azerrad, who's thanked in the liner notes to Nirvana's In Utero . "I kept hearing people argue about Kurt, talk authoritatively about Kurt, make these bombastic statements about Kurt that were completely inaccurate portrayals of the guy I knew. I finally felt like it was time to let Kurt talk for himself."
Schnack built the film around Kurt's words, shooting contemporary scenes of the Pacific Northwest  to correspond factually. When the Washington State native references his father's lumber mill, there's a logging montage; unbeknownst to the viewer, it's recent footage of the actual place where Cobain's dad worked. "I didn't want to identify the locations and say, 'Yes, this is what he's talking abouthis dad's real office!' " says Schnack, in Bryant Park  with Azerrad one recent afternoon. Subtle, yes, but there are times you're left wondering just who and what the faces and places are. "I guess I thought people would just assume that of course  we went [to] that length. I'm kind of surprised when I read something where they think we went to a random lumber mill. Nopeactual lumber mill where his dad worked. And that's Kurt's actual Olympia  apartment. And those are real  Aberdeen  residents."
But the footage isn't the starthe voice is. There wasn't YouTube in the early '90s, so Cobain's speech isn't a familiar part of his mythology. Hearing him expound while eating cereal or sucking on a smoke, it's easy to forget that this is the voice of the "Gen-X anthem" for apathetic kids. "When we were making decisions about the film, looking at cuts, my mantra was: 'Don't break the spell, don't break the spell,'" says Azerrad. "It's supposed to be this immersive, dream-like, associative experience."
Azerrad caught his subject at a rather poignant moment. Frances Bean  had just been born, grunge was a juggernaut, and Kurt was contemplative, candid, and lucidable to reflect on the factors that would inevitably kill him. "Drugs are bad for you, and they will fuck you up. I just knew that I would eventually stop doing them. Being married and having a baby is a really good incentive," Kurt says late in the film. "If I would've kept doing drugs, I would have lost everything." This line is truly devastating. Likewise when Azerrad asks, "Is yours a sad story?" "No, not really," Kurt responds. "It's nothing that's amazing or anything new, for sure."
Here Kurt Cobain, the supernatural songwriting god who discovered that the only true fountain of youth is death, is transmogrified into a mere mortal. This is About a Son 's singular objective, and real accomplishment. "Every once in a while at a screening, in the Q&A afterwards, someone will say, 'Did Courtney kill Kurt?'" Azerrad says with a sigh. "The film has not reached that person. And that's disappointing. But those people, there's nothing you can dothey're like the Lyndon LaRouche  9/11 conspiracy theorists. You're never going to get to them." Oh well, whatever, nevermind.
