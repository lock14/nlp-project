Standing in his front yard, holding a Mr. Potato Head, unshaven � this is the Roky Erickson we see early in the film. Thirty years earlier he legally declared himself an alien. Nearly 40 years earlier he and his bandmates in the 13th Floor Elevators coined the phrase �psychedelic rock.� So it�s jarring to see the once hair-raising howler, who so decimated their hit �You�re Gonna Miss Me,� living in a ratpacked Austin apartment where he sits in a chair with sunglasses on and the TV up, while white noise blasts from a Casio to keep out the voices. Filmmaker and former Texan McAlester documents Erickson�s musical rise and unfortunate decline into a mental illness he still struggles with, unleashing archival performances and home videos in this documentary film, which premiered at SXSW Film 2005. He also filmed Erickson for nearly two years. Much like this year�s eerily similar The Devil and Daniel Johnston
, it�s hallucinogens vs. mental illness and what exacerbated what. First-wife Dana Gaines recalls that she would have to hold Roky in front of crashing waves to �knock some sense into him.� (Later in the film we see his mother, Evelyn, standing in Barton Springs, possibly doing the same.) After being arrested in 1969 on drug possession (for one marijuana joint), to which Erickson pleads insanity to avoid jail, he�s sent to Rusk State Hospital, where he starts up a band with a murderer and a rapist and receives shock therapy. It�s Roky�s family � namely his mother � that drives the film. McAlester�s shots in the home are personal, never claustrophobic, and we are allowed access to Evelyn and Roky�s domestic co-dependency. Scenes in the cluttered apartment feel like they�ve been ripped out of Grey Gardens
. Evelyn is a bizarre study, so desperate to tell her side of the story she�s surrounded herself with reassuring scrapbooks, memorabilia, and cardboard collages of her five sons, as a buffer for her eldest son�s mental health. Still, McAlester gives them room and the silence speaks loudly; his camera lingers on them respectfully. The opening and closing courtroom scenes, in which brother Sumner is granted legal guardianship, show a family in need of healing, mentally and spiritually. Today, Roky is playing again, proving he has always been here before. (Roky, Sumner, and Evelyn Erickson will attend the 7pm show on Friday and conduct a Q&A following the screening.)


If you've never heard the '60s psychedelic cult band the 13th Floor Elevators, by all means download their nuggets: They had a spooky thrash beauty, and their leader, Roky  Erickson, sang with a full-moon hellcat yowl that bridged the fervor of Van Morrison and the anarchy of Janis Joplin. But this slipshod documentary, a portrait of the drug-and-mental-illness-addled lump Erickson became, is too enamored of his decay. Director Keven McAlester thinks he's making Crumb , but he doesn't give you enough of Erickson in his glory. You're Gonna Miss Me  has the taint of exploitation.

 Early in the documentary "You're Gonna Miss Me," the film's subject, the psychedelic rocker and drug-damaged schizophrenic Roky Erickson, ambles through his Austin, Tex., home, clutching a Mr. Potato Head doll. It's a potent image that's all the more effective for being tossed off: Mr. Erickson, the lead singer of the 13th Floor Elevators and maybe the most influential 1960s pop star that most folks haven't heard of, has had so little control over his life and image for so many years that he's become a goofy blank slate.  Luckily, the director Keven McAlester keeps Mr. Erickson's humanity front and center. He lets music critics and musicians praise Mr. Erickson's smiling banshee voice (which influenced Janis Joplin) and pioneering use of feedback, but he doesn't insist on his subject's genius or oversell his importance.  He's more interested in Mr. Erickson's spiral into despair, through  drugs and mental illness, and his slow climb to something like normalcy. The film credits much of his recovery to his youngest brother, Sumner Erickson, who took custody of him in 2001 and helped him resolve long-festering royalty issues.  Also noteworthy is the film's superb cinematography, by Lee Daniel, a frequent Richard Linklater collaborator. His striking compositions and purposeful camera moves mirror Sumner Erickson's quest to create order from chaos.
If you only see one gushy, poppy rock-doc about an influential singer-songwriterrenowned as much for his music as for his near-tragic mental illnessthat features candid intimacy with the subject's folks and canonizing interviews with Gibby Haynes  and Thurston Moore , go rent The Devil and Daniel Johnston  . Not to dismiss You're Gonna Miss Me 's where-is-he-now chronicle of 13th Floor Elevators frontman-turned-LSD burnout Roky Erickson , whose legendary banshee tenor paved Janis Joplin 's way and whose pantheon status as the psychedelic-rock grandfather warrants rediscovery. Director Keven McAlester 's film is entertaining. But with battered archival footage and celebrity worship, McAlester  skimps on perspective and complexity, instead focusing in on the courtroom battle over 53-year-old Roky's custody and painting Roky's brothers as heroes and Mom, who's against giving her son psychiatric meds, as the villain. Roky's addled state might be a product of the electroshock he received after being arrested for marijuana and institutionalized in 1969, but McAlester fails to connect those dots, so Mom's faith in God over science looks merely neglectful rather than neglectful and  a rational response to evidence. The camera lingers unobtrusively on her nostalgic ramblings and scrapbook show-and-tells, but the laissez-faire approach feels less like impartiality than rope; it's her noose, but McAlester's knot.
