If good intentions mattered, writer- director Brant Sersen's small-town indie about an awkward Seth Meyers look-alike (Thomas Middleditch) falling for a cool, tattooed carny girl (Rachael Taylor) would get an A. But Splinterheads , which aims to be a quirkier Adventureland , never rises above mildly amusing. A supporting cast of oddballs (Jason Mantzoukas' intense magician The Amazing Steve) and a few familiar faces (hey, Lea Thompson!) aren't enough to keep you from forgetting about the movie the second you walk out of the theater.

 A cool hobby and a hot blonde guide an aimless young man to his bliss in “Splinterheads,” a shaggy comedy with more heart than heft.  It’s summer in a nameless, featureless small town, and Justin (Thomas Middleditch) is bored. Unenthusiastic about the lawn care business he shares with his best friend, Wayne (Jason Rogel), he’s more titillated than angry when the exotically named and tattooed Galaxy (Rachael Taylor) rips him off at the gas station. Galaxy’s grifter credentials are authenticated when Justin learns she’s a splinterhead: a carnival-based con artist who works marks on the midway. She is also an aficionado of geocaching, a satellite-guided treasure hunt and a too-obvious metaphor for Justin’s halfhearted search for a life.  Written and directed by Brant Sersen, who conjures his offbeat milieu without breaking a sweat, “Splinterheads” gains traction from an eclectic cast that knows how to work a line. Lea Thompson (little altered since her 1983 turn as Tom Cruise’s high school honey in “All the Right Moves”) settles comfortably into her role as Justin’s overprotective mom, while the estimable Christopher McDonald plays her simmering ex-boyfriend with practiced restraint. And thanks to Michael Simmonds’s clean, color-rich photography, the film has a visual polish rarely seen in low-budget projects: the gags may not always work, but the skin tones are perfect.

Splinterheads work the midway, tasked with parting suckers from their cash when a carnival comes to town. In the movie "Splinterheads," however, it's the other way around, with a lovestruck townie trying to steal the girl from a traveling fair. Writer-director Brant Sersen's amiable indie comedy -- even less edgy than Greg Mottola's theme-park-set "Adventureland" -- attempts to compensate for its too-familiar romantic setup by defining its characters through idiosyncratic hobbies and traits. A non-starter on the fest circuit, "Splinterheads" will likely be overlooked in limited release as well.
As played by newcomer Thomas Middleditch, who's performed with the Improvised Shakespeare Company and several other noteworthy comedy troupes, Justin Frost belongs to the same category of listless, middle-class, white-guy characters as Napoleon Dynamite. He lives at home with his single mom (Lea Thompson), practices amateur karate in his spare time and drives an old Toyota he insists on calling his "sports car" --�qualities that don't go particularly far with an edgy girl like Galaxy (Rachael Taylor, "Transformers").
Nevertheless, Galaxy feigns interest when they first meet, showing just enough cleavage to con Justin out of 60 bucks in a gas station scam. When Justin sees her again, she's working the dunking booth at the fair, a two-bit operation just exciting enough to lure Justin and his randy best friend, Wayne Chung (Jason Rogel), after a lame day mowing lawns.
For a character in his mid-20s, Justin behaves more like a junior high teen: He's a bit of a spazz, and lacking in ambition, interests and backbone. He's easily intimidated by Galaxy's carny boyfriend (Dean Winters), as well as the town police officer (Christopher McDonald) who used to date his mom. By the third time he and Galaxy cross paths, during a geocaching hunt for hidden treasure, he is thoroughly smitten, yet virtually incapable of loosening up.
While Justin seems to be coming to terms with his inner dork, Middleditch has clearly embraced his own. The actor looks like a young Daniel Stern, with his sleepy eyes and sideways smirk, and it's not hard to imagine Galaxy would find his awkwardness endearing. At the very least, he seems more sensitive than her cartoonish bully of a boyfriend.
Still, their time together feels mostly pro forma. Sersen ("Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story") uses the old trick of dropping out the dialogue as the two characters laugh and chat, but instead of condensing several dates into a standard falling-in-love montage, he cuts together multiple shots from a single, long drive, which conveys little more than how long it takes to reach their destination.
Side characters introduced as comic relief -- including a self-important magician (Jason Mantzoukas) and Justin's older-than-dirt granddad (Edmund Lyndeck) --�add flair to what feels like a very small town, but get in the way during the pic's sloppy climax. Still, Sersen has the right instincts for comedy, and with a few clumsy exceptions, his work is polished enough to pass for pro. Red-shot footage looks sharp.

Future students of early-21st-century screen comedy will be mystified by just how much film we devoted to fat guys screaming about gettin' pussy. Jason Rogel  barks the best friend part here—his complementary archetype, the awkward nice-guyish leading man, is headlight-eyed Thomas Middleditch , wincing in surprise at his own voice. Middleditch plays a no-ambition twentysomething townie, Justin, who is hustled and bewitched by punkette Galaxy (Rachael Taylor ), visiting with the carnival and her hardcase boyfriend. From here, it's another tale of an overgrown kid accepted for his sweet, stammering self and nurtured out of his cocoon—Justin and Galaxy's moment of connection takes place, typically, on a playground date. The best that can be said of Splinterheads  is that writer/director Brant Sersen's romantic idealization of a "funky" tattooed chick who's into "geocaching"—some kind of GPS-based scavenger hunt, awkwardly explained, which could be excised from the plot without leaving a scar—is touching in its dorkiness. Sundry eccentrics fill out the cast, with Jason Mantzoukas  and Lennon Parham  as magician Amazing Steve and his lover/assistant closest to being funny.
