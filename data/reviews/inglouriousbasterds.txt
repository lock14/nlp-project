As with puppies and nudity, you can never go wrong by sprinkling a whole mess of dead Nazis in your film, a truism that Tarantino takes to heart (and, via Louisville Slugger, head) in this in-name-only remake of the 1978 Enzo Castellari World War II outing. Divided into chapters � la Kill Bill
, Inglourious Basterds
 weaves together multiple storylines which coalesce into a literally explosive finale that rewrites both history and the World War II-era period of Germany's legendary UFA studios. Along the road to Berlin, it also travels into a surprisingly deft meditation on the uses and abuses of film as propaganda, and, while not every stylistic tack that's employed services the film as a whole � the wiggy, outsized, intertitled character introductions are a case in point � there's no mistaking this glorious mash-up of the war and vengeance genres for anything other than a Tarantino film. The tip-off that this particular version of history is an extended QT riff comes with the opening words: "Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France." Tarantino's war is no fairy tale, though. While the sundry threads of the interwoven stories take a roundabout way to get to their final, fiery conclusion, the end result is nearly as satisfying as kicking Hitler in the teeth with a steel-toed jackboot. Pitt, scowling and scabrous and full of earthy, Tennessee wit, seems to have pitched his portrayal of the Basterds� boss, Lt. Aldo Raine, somewhere between Clark Gable and Lee Van Cleef. His men, christened the �Basterds" by the Axis, are an all-Jewish squadron of bloodthirsty Nazi hunters whose most memorable member is Roth's baseball-bat-wielding maniac, Sgt. Donny Donowitz. Leading his men to a balls-out showdown with the Nazi top brass in a Parisian movie theatre owned by Laurent's Jewish survivor Shosanna Dreyfus, Raine and his men end up going head to head with the linguistically cunning and altogether opportunistic �bermensch, Col. Hans Landa, aka the �Jew Hunter." Landa is the most consistently entertaining character in a film crawling with uniquely archetypal figures � he may well be the best character that Tarantino has ever written � and the Austrian actor Waltz delivers a remarkably nuanced performance that's both outrageously over the top and treacherously nuanced. Waltz is, in fact, the beating heart of Inglorious Basterds
 and the best reason for non-QT fans to see the film. Despite what the film's ad campaign leads you to believe, this isn't
 simply an unending series of brutal encounters between unsympathetic Nazis and the business end of the Basterds� bayonets. Tarantino's typically circular dialogue swarms are less noticeable than they were in, say, �Death Proof� or Jackie Brown
, but they're still on display, and no one but no one writes with a surer grip of characterization and backstory (whether it's actually revealed or not) than QT. For all its stylistic flourishes and interlocking storylines, Inglourious Basterds
 is, at its bullet-riddled core, a bloody good war movie, twisting and twisted and full of wordy shrapnel but no less kickass for it. See "Once Upon a War Story
" for an interview with Tarantino.


If the title weren’t already taken, it’d be tempting to think of Quentin Tarantino’s new movie  - indeed, his entire career  - as “Infinite Jest.’’ Inside the fevered junk-pop particle accelerator that is this director’s brain, moments of power and banality, meaning and absurdity, all collide into each other, creating movie mash-ups as brilliant as they are pointless. You take a Tarantino film seriously at your risk, which is why “Inglourious Basterds’’ is his greatest risk yet: a rollicking action-comedy about  - wait for it  - the Holocaust.

This isn’t new ground, really. As with any historical calamity, the urge to view it from all sides  - including farce  - grows with time, and World War II has been mined for shock-comedy since at least “The Producers’’ in 1968. There’s a tiny germ of an idea in “Basterds’’ and it’s the same one that propelled last year’s “Defiance’’: How about a movie where the Jews fight back?

Where “Defiance’’ was a dramatic slog hamstrung by its faithfulness to history, though, “Inglourious Basterds’’ is just the opposite: a manically playful revenge fantasia made from the spare parts of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns and strapping World War II action flicks like “The Great Escape’’ and Enzo Castellari’s 1978 “The Inglorious Bastards,’’ from which Tarantino has mangled his title and much of his plot.

Does it work? On a scene-by-scene basis, “Inglourious Basterds’’ is prime, if well-worn, Tarantino  - the hard-boiled men and women, the tense, smart dialogue scenes that go on forever, the spurts of violence that erupt to wipe the board clean so the cycle can start again. Yet it’s also his weakest film yet, in part because the director’s playing close to the fire this time, and he’s scared of getting burnt.

The nominal star is Brad Pitt as  Lieutenant Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds, a (mostly) American squadron of Jewish GIs in occupied France whose mandate is to kill, scalp, and sow terror into as many Nazis as possible. Pitt’s doing one of his comic character turns here  - he plays Raine as a macho hillbilly who wouldn’t be out of place in a Coen brothers movie. It’s fair to say, though, that “Inglourious Basterds’’ is stolen fair and square by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz as  Colonel Hans Landa of the SS, the Jews’ worst enemy in France.

Waltz is a slender actor with a long, playful face  - he makes Landa a lethal imp whose one flaw is his ego. He gives an almost obscenely delightful performance: The colonel has vowed to capture the Basterds but he keeps getting sidetracked by the immense pleasure of watching himself do so. He’s the star of his own movie.
That’s not an idle metaphor: As you’d expect from a cinema-besotted former video store clerk, “Inglourious Basterds’’ is more about the movies made during World War II than about the war itself. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a young Jewish woman who has escaped Landa’s clutches in the opening sequence, later turns up running a movie house in Paris; she’s wooed by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), a Nazi war hero whom Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) has cast in a film based on Zoller’s exploits. Among the Basterds’ contacts is a German film star/double agent played by Diane Kruger, on loan from the “National Treasure’’ movies.

All this ensures the characters will argue the merits of Leni Riefenstahl’s 1929 “The White Hell of Pitz Palu’’ in long, arch arias of dialogue; that old Ennio Morricone film scores will be merrily repurposed; that obscure movie references will be buried throughout, awaiting future dissection by legions of cinema studies grad students. As with any Tarantino movie, “Basterds’’ ultimately just reflects its maker’s magpie affectations. Why is David Bowie’s “Cat People’’ title song trotted out here  - not once but twice? Because QT likes it, that’s why.

The hyperactivity makes the movie bearable while keeping it from connecting. “Inglourious Basterds’’ is divided into five chapters, some of which could serve as stand-alone shorts: A prolonged, outrageously suspenseful showdown in a basement bier-garten may be the film’s high point. Eventually the players converge on Shosanna’s little theater, where Zoller’s movie will premiere to an audience of Nazi brass, including Hitler himself (Martin Wuttke). (If it’s historical accuracy you’re seeking, boy, are you at the wrong movie.) An explosive reception is planned and “Basterds’’ dutifully detonates in style.

Yet you come away amused and unmoved, and that wasn’t the case with, say, “Kill Bill,’’ where by the end Uma Thurman had assumed an exhausted, hard-won majesty. For the first time in a Tarantino movie, the women’s roles feel underwritten, and most of the men don’t get enough screen time. Til Schweiger is briefly wonderful as a hulking ex-Nazi who has joined the Basterds  - it’s the old James Coburn part from “The Magnificent Seven’’  - and Hollywood vet Rod Taylor (“The Birds’’) drops in as Winston Churchill. There’s even a deft, Peter Sellers-like cameo by Mike Myers as a British officer  - the best work the comedian has done in years.

On the other hand, Tarantino overindulges horror movie director-turned-actor Eli Roth as the most ferocious of the Basterds, doing horrible things to a Boston accent only a kid from the western suburbs would dare. Next to Waltz, the most enjoyable performance in “Basterds’’ comes from British actor Michael Fassbender as the drily capable  Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a key player in that beer hall scene. The movie cruelly hangs him out to dry, though.

It’s obviously too much to expect a clever kid  - which at 46, Tarantino still is  - to grapple with history in any meaningful sense. For all that, the movie’s pop-art shallowness feels forced. “Inglorious Basterds’’ is an entertainment but an uneasy one; it represents 153 minutes of bravura stalling, after which its creator loses interest and walks away. Tarantino may be the most talented filmmaker in America who prides himself on having absolutely nothing to say.

Quentin Tarantino's fevered fantasia Inglourious Basterds  makes  the delirious assertion that World War II was won through a combination of the power of movies and the prowess of a band of renegades led by Brad Pitt as a twanging moonshine-maker. So it's perhaps unnecessary to point out that the blithe misspellings   in the movie's title are a delirious touch of nonsense too   the whim of a filmmaker who's a bit of a renegade himself.
Still, I start with the title, since so too does Tarantino. His orthographic choices seem to say, Love me, love my idiosyncrasies   fun with words is only a hint of the coming attractions. (Trivia experts in the QT movie clubhouse know that Inglorious Bastards , properly spelled, is the American title of a 1978 B-minus Italian war movie with only the loosest of plot connections to this loopy homage.) Few young-to-middle-aged American filmmakers have the nerd-centric depth of movie knowledge and technique that Tarantino brings to his high-flying projects, and fewer still have the confidence to simultaneously glorify and deconstruct genre as he can, whether the genre is blaxploitation, Hong Kong action, '70s grindhouse fare, or, in this case, war movies and '40s noir. But Tarantino's gleefully assembled spectacles are  inextricable from his frustrating emotional limitations: Everything is  a game. And here the game includes spelling and the actorly imitation of ''people'' in ''trouble.'' And Nazis.
Or should I say, ''NAH-zeees''? That's what Lieut. Aldo Raine (Pitt) calls them, as he handpicks a team  of cocky malcontents  most of them Jewish  to join him in accumulating Nah-zee scalps. (Literally: Each man is assigned a quota of 100.) Pitt, in a '40s-style toothbrush-bristle mustache, undertakes Raine's preposterous speechifying in an accent just east of a George W. Bush drawl; he also pulls his lower lip up in a cornpone approximation of Monty Python's Mr. Gumby. Among those who cowboy up for Raine's regiment is Hostel   director Eli Roth as "the bear Jew," a baseball-bat-wielding lug who smashes his enemies' heads to a pulp. You can watch, since QT is always up for a lavishly designed shot of brain splatter.
As is his preference, Tarantino builds his movie as a collage of interlocking set piece  cinematically dazzling, to be sure,   enhanced by an meticulously chosen retro soundtrack  rather than a linear progression. As a result, it's easy enough to tune out the Basterds  while they scalp up a storm, and drop in instead on other colorful players. As Bridget, a German actress and undercover agent with exquisite taste in footwear, Diane Kruger presides over a conversation-rich scene in a pub populated with good guys and bad. As French-Jewish Shosanna, who witnesses the slaughter of her family, forges a new identity, opens a movie theater, and plots revenge, Mélanie Laurent presides over a climactic blowout  literally  in her Cinema Paradiso of a movie palace. (At the Cannes premiere, this line  of Shosanna's killed: ''We're French. We respect directors in our country.'')
And as Nazi colonel Hans Landa, nicknamed ''the Jew hunter'' for obvious and terrible   reasons, Austrian actor Christoph Waltz   triumphs, heroically, over Tarantino's brash, cine-drunk tall tale. His Landa makes a   magnetic entrance in the movie's first (and very best) scene, terrifying a French farmer suspected of hiding Jews simply by requesting a glass of milk. Waltz, who easily won the 2009 Cannes prize for best actor, centers Inglourious Basterds  with the welcome subtlety of his performance. In Tarantino's besotted historical reverie, real-life villains Adolf Hitler and  Joseph Goebbels are played as grotesque jokes. The Basterds are played as exaggeratedly tough Jews. The women are femmes fatales.  In such a cartoon world, the appearance of one stereotype-resistant protagonist  a Nazi, no less  counts as something glorious indeed.

 Correction Appended  From the moment the charming, smiling, laughing Nazi in “Inglourious Basterds,” Quentin Tarantino’s latest cinematic happening, sweeps onto the screen, he owns this film even more than its maker. Played by a little-known Austrian actor, Christoph Waltz, Col. Hans Landa is a vision of big-screen National Socialist villainy, from the smart cut of his SS coat to the soft gleam of his leather boots. There might be a fearsome skull (the death’s head, or totenkopf) grinning on his cap, but Colonel Landa has us at hallo.  “Inglourious Basterds,” first shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May, is Mr. Tarantino’s sixth feature. (The bifurcated “Kill Bill” is really one film.)  In many respects it looks and, as important, sounds like a typical Tarantino production with its showboating performances, encyclopedic movie references and streams of self-conscious dialogue. The whistling on the soundtrack comes from the Sergio Leone composer Ennio Morricone, and the American avenger, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), is a nod to the Hollywood actor Aldo Ray, a sandpaper-voiced 1950s Everyman who often seemed most at ease wearing Army fatigues, as he does in Anthony Mann’s 1957 masterpiece “Men in  War.” (Mr. Ray’s widow, Johanna Ray, served as one of the casting directors for “Inglourious Basterds.”)  Raine leads a pack of Jewish avengers, the inglourious basterds of the misspelled title, who occupy one part of the sprawling narrative and whose numbers include a bat-wielding American nicknamed the Bear Jew (the director Eli Roth, dreadful). Also elbowing for attention is a young French Jew, Shosanna  Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), who’s running a cinema in Paris under a pseudonym, and a German Army hero, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), who dangerously woos her, unaware of her true identity. There’s the British film critic turned spy, Lt. Archie Hicox (a very good Michael Fassbender), and the German movie star turned spy, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). Mostly, though, there is Landa, whose unctuous charm, beautifully modulated by Mr. Waltz, gives this unwieldy, dragging movie a much-needed periodic jolt.  Mr. Tarantino likes to take his sweet time — he can be a master of the slow windup — but rarely has one of his movies felt as interminable as this one and its 2 hours 32 minutes. The film is divided into five chapters organized around specific bits of business and conversations that increasingly converge. The second introduces the basterds while the third brings Shosanna together with her German suitor, who introduces her to Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Landa swans in, and a ludicrous plot to kill Hitler is unveiled. The fourth chapter throws in an unrecognizable Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill, a barely recognizable Mike Myers as a British commander and a risible fiction: a suave film critic (Mr. Fassbender).  As usual Mr. Tarantino gives you a lot to chew on, though there’s plenty to gag on as well. Much depends on whether you can just groove on his framing and staging, his swooping crane shots, postmodern flourishes (Samuel L. Jackson in voice-over explaining the combustibility of nitrate prints) and gorgeously saturated colors, one velvety red in particular. The film’s opening sequence, much of which takes place inside the restricted confines of a farmhouse room, is a marvel of choreographed camera movement and tightly coordinated performances. When the scene moves inside the farmhouse, you admire how neatly the German soldiers outside are positioned within one of the windows, a shot that recalls the framing of an image in Monte Hellman’s 1971 cult classic, “Two-Lane Blacktop.”  This sequence crystallizes much of what is pleasurable about “Inglourious Basterds” even as it underscores the film’s pronounced failings. Set against a sweeping stretch of green French countryside in 1941, it opens with a dairy farmer, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet), chopping wood. As his ax looms ominously in the foreground of the shot, he readies himself for some unwelcome German visitors. Colonel Landa, nicknamed the Jew Hunter, has come looking for hidden prey, a task for which he is, as he explains in a long verbal jag, eminently suitable. Because Germans are like hawks, Landa explains, most cannot think like Jews, who are more like rats — a characterization that, of course, was a privileged metaphor and ideological instrument in the Nazi’s campaign against European Jewry.  The invocation of Jews as rats is ghastly — both times I’ve seen the movie I could almost hear the audience holding its collective breath — but Landa keeps smiling and talking and charming, and Mr. Waltz’s performance is so very good, so persuasive, seductive and, crucially, so distracting that you can readily move past the moment if you choose. Mr. Tarantino makes it easy to do just that by capping this exegesis with an abrupt sight gag: after asking the farmer if he can smoke, Landa pulls out a pipe so comically large it immediately undercuts his threat, transforming him from a ferocious Jew hunter into a silly man whose flamboyant pipe suggests he suffers from some masculinity issues.  The joke fades quickly, as they do in this film, because Landa has already guessed there are Jews hiding where you might expect to find rats, under the floorboards. Mr. Tarantino reveals them in their hiding place, the camera slipping through the floor to show the terrified family members prostrate, their hands over their mouths and eyes wide in fear. It’s a shocking moment partly because this image resonates with horror, but it’s also shocking because it comes cushioned with laughs. Yet the shock dissipates because the Jews are irrelevant here. What matters is how he builds the tension with unnerving quiet and a camera that circles Landa and the farmer like an ever-tightening rope. What matters, to Mr. Tarantino, is the filmmaking.  But too often in “Inglourious Basterds” the filmmaking falls short. Mr. Tarantino is a great writer and director of individual scenes, though he can have trouble putting those together, a difficulty that has sometimes been obscured by the clever temporal kinks in his earlier work. He has also turned into a bad editor of his own material (his nominal editor, as usual, is Sally Menke) and seems unwilling or incapable of telling his A material from his B. The conversations in “Inglourious Basterds” are often repetitive and overlong and they rarely sing, in part because the period setting doesn’t allow him to raid his vast pop-cultural storehouse. A joke about Wiener schnitzel just doesn’t pop like the burger riff in “Pulp Fiction.”  The film’s most egregious failure — its giddy, at times gleeful embrace and narrative elevation of the seductive Nazi villain — can largely be explained as a problem of form. Landa simply has no equal in the film, no counterpart who can match him in verbal dexterity and charisma, who can be the Jules Winnfield and Mia Wallace to his Vincent Vega as Mr. Jackson and Uma Thurman are to John Travolta in “Pulp Fiction.” Leading with his chin, Mr. Pitt gets off some funny lines, particularly when he’s pulling his Southern-flavored vowels out like chewed gum, but the character is too broadly drawn to carry weight. The same holds true of Ms. Laurent, a pretty face who all but slides off the screen.  This isn’t to say that the film’s representation of National Socialism, its repellent invocation of the Holocaust crematoriums in the final blowout and calculated use of the Jews-as-rat metaphor are not vulgar in the extreme. Mr. Tarantino likes to push hard against accepted norms, as his chortling exploitation of spectacular violence and insistent use of a noxious epithet for blacks  has shown in the past. But complaining about tastelessness in a Quentin Tarantino movie is about as pointless as carping about its hyperbolic violence: these are as much a constituent part of his work as the reams of dialogue. This  is, after all, a man who has an Oscar for a movie with a monologue about a watch stashed in a rectum.  Cartoon Nazis are not new to the movies, and neither are fascinating fascists, as evidenced by Ralph Fiennes’s Oscar-nominated turn in “Schindler’s List.” Unlike those in “Schindler’s List,” Mr. Tarantino’s Nazis exist in an insistently fictional cinematic space where heroes and villains converge amid a welter of movie allusions. He’s not making a documentary or trying to be Steven Spielberg: Mr. Tarantino is really only serious about his own films, not history. In that sense “Inglourious Basterds,” which takes its title if not its misspellings from an Italian flick in “The Dirty Dozen” vein, is simply another testament to his movie love. The problem is that by making the star attraction of his latest film a most delightful Nazi, one whose smooth talk is as lovingly presented as his murderous violence, Mr. Tarantino has polluted that love.  “Inglourious Basterds” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The basterds like to scalp their Nazi victims, and Mr. Tarantino likes showing their knife work in graphic detail.

"Inglourious Basterds" is a violent fairy tale, an increasingly entertaining fantasia in which the history of World War II is wildly reimagined so that the cinema can play the decisive role in destroying the Third Reich. Quentin Tarantino's long-gestating war saga invests a long-simmering revenge plot with reworkings of innumerable genre conventions, but only fully finds its tonal footing about halfway through, after which it's off to the races. By turns surprising, nutty, windy, audacious and a bit caught up in its own cleverness, the picture is a completely distinctive piece of American pop art with a strong Euro flavor that's new for the director. Several explosive scenes and the names of Tarantino and topliner Brad Pitt promise brawny commercial prospects, especially internationally, as the preponderance of subtitled dialogue might put off a certain slice of the prospective domestic audience.
In no meaningful way based upon Enzo G. Castellari's schlock 1978 Italian WWII programmer of the same title, Tarantino's deliberately misspelled namesake has been in the oven for many years, initially as a would-be "The Dirty Dozen"-style bad boys "mission" adventure and until very recently as a massive miniseries-length epic spanning the entire war. The narrow mission focus has prevailed in the end, but not in the way that might have been expected, as the group of Jewish avengers led by Pitt's Tennessee Lt. Aldo Raine rep only one component of a vast ensemble that feeds into a Nazi-foiling plot only a hardcore film buff could have dreamed up.
In fact, the best characters are non-Yanks, all of whom speak their own languages and one or two others to boot. But this commendable gesture toward linguistic accuracy is virtually the only realistic aspect of the picture, which otherwise soars on its flights of fancy and deliberate anachronisms -- the use of David Bowie's "Putting Out the Fire" at a crucial point is particularly inspired -- and flattens out only when Tarantino gets too carried away with over-elaborated dialogue scenes, a problem that could easily be addressed with some slight trimming between now and the skedded August opening.
Never less than enjoyable and more than that in the second half, "Basterds" is divided into five "chapters," the first being "Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France." Wording not only reflects the Sergio Leone-style nature of the opening scene, in which notorious Nazi "Jew Hunter" Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farmhouse to ferret out a hidden Jewish family, but honestly reflects the fantastical nature of the narrative to come.
The long discussion in which Landa engages the nervous farmer establishes, in slightly protracted fashion, Landa's erudition and his relaxed, self-amused way of leading up to the lethal moment. It also provides Waltz, a good-looking 40ish actor who carries off dialogue in four languages with consummate ease, with an early chance to claim the picture as his own, which he does.
One member of the Jewish family, young Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), escapes the massacre, only to surface three years later, in 1944, as the owner of a cinema in occupied Paris. Now a very quickly grown-up blonde, Shosanna endures the unwelcome advances of Nazi war hero Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who calls himself "the German Sgt. York" for his exploits at taking out dozens of Allied soldiers singlehandedly, a feat celebrated in a new German movie, "Nation's Pride," starring Zoller himself.
In short order, Shosanna is compelled to tolerate the company of the infamous Dr. Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) as well that of Landa, who informs her at length that the Nazis want to take over her theater to hold the premiere of Zoller's film, an event to be attended by Nazidom's elite. As difficult as it is for Shosanna to bear these monsters, the event does provide the long-suffering woman the opportunity she's been waiting for to strike back at her family's killer and other Nazis in the bargain.
A notable continuity issue crops up here, as Shosanna is told the gala screening is to be held that very evening. In the next chapter, "Operation Kino," a British commando leader (and former film critic), Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), is told by a general (Mike Myers, amusing and greatly made-over) that the opening will take place three days hence. Quite apart from Shosanna's own plot, the Brits, in league with the Basterds, plan to infiltrate the premiere courtesy of their invaluable secret agent, beauteous German leading lady Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger).
Once this mission is set in motion, pic clicks confidently on all cylinders. Before this point, some scenes feel overly attenuated; the leisurely exchange between Landa and Shosanna in a Paris restaurant features needlessly repetitious dialogue and has a deadened, airless quality due to the almost total absence of ambient sound and surrounding activity. The Basterds' first appearance, in which they gleefully display their grisly Nazi-scalping technique and which features much twangy, down-home speechifying by Pitt, also proves less amusing than was no doubt intended.
By contrast, a long tavern sequence in which the group of reveling spies -- including Bridget, Hicox, Til Schweiger's renegade German and Gedeon Burkhard's undercover corporal -- party on until coming under the suspicion of a Gestapo officer (August Diehl, excellent), is vintage Tarantino, brimming with delicious dialogue, wonderful linguistic mixing, lively group interplay and tension slowly built to a convulsive climax. Scene vaults the picture straight into its grand climax, in which all the top Nazis, including Goebbels, Goerring and, crazily enough, Hitler himself, conveniently place themselves under one roof awaiting the madly inventive fate devised for them by Shosanna.
While World War II has probably inspired as much fiction as any other single topic in film history, "Inglourious Basterds" is one of the few to have brazenly altered history to such an extent. Because he carefully sets up the approach at the outset, as well as through his sense of style, Tarantino gets away with it, and is in a position to fine-tune the picture before locking a final cut. Other scenes ripe for pruning are all those featuring Hitler prior to the grand finale, interludes that come off as cartoony, unconvincing and unnecessary.
In a true ensemble picture, Waltz stands head and shoulders above the rest with a lusty performance in the juiciest role. Laurent is appealingly thoughtful and observant as the young lady awaiting her chance, Fassbender cuts a dashing figure, speaks with a wonderfully clipped accent and rather resembles Daniel Day-Lewis here, and Kruger is far more engaging and animated than she's heretofore been in her big international pictures. Pitt clearly enjoys rolling his former moonshine runner's accent around in his mouth, although his performance is overly defined by constantly jutting jaw and furrowed brow. Inferring a measure of self-evaluation by Tarantino, some viewers will take exception to the film's final line, in which Aldo admires his climactic bit of brutal handiwork: "I think this just might be my masterpiece." 
Shot almost entirely at Babelsberg Studio outside Berlin, with brief location work in Paris, pic features terrific production values across the boards, from David Wasco's rich production design and Anna Sheppard's fine costumes to Robert Richardson's clear-eyed, beautifully framed lensing and Sally Menke's sharply timed editing. Tarantino eschews a traditional score in favor of a crazy stew of source music, ranging eclectically from Dimitri Tiomkin's "The Green Leaves of Summer" from "The Alamo" and some Mike Curb motorcycle movie music to eight selections from the Ennio Morricone library.
Basterd Eli Roth shot the black-and-white battle footage from the "Nation's Pride" film-within-a-film, which features glimpses of original "Inglorious Bastards" star Bo Swenson.

Energetic, inventive, swaggering fun, Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds  is a consummate Hollywood  entertainment—rich in fantasy and blithely amoral.
It's also quintessential Tarantino—even more drenched in film references than gore, with a proudly misspelled title (lifted from Italian genre-meister Enzo Castellari 's 1978 Dirty Dozen  knockoff) to underscore the movie's cinematic hyperliteracy. Tepidly received in Cannes , and thereafter tweaked, Inglourious Basterds  may still be a tad long at two and a half hours and a little too pleased with itself, but it's tough to resist the enthusiastic performances and terrific dialogue—if you're not put off by the juvenile premise or cartoonish savagery. (See Ella Taylor 's interview with Quentin Tarantino here .)
Not the year's preeminent genre exercise (The Hurt Locker  is a superior war film, as well as a serious reworking of the Hawksian group drama), Inglourious Basterds  is something sui generis—a two-fisted Hollywood occupation romance, in which a Jewish special unit wreaks vengeance on the Nazis. It also has the best Western opener in decades: The first of five chapters nods to Sergio Leone  with the title "Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France," and to the genre in general with a shot of a French farm family hanging their laundry as a Nazi convoy approaches in the distance like a Comanche band. Violence is not immediately forthcoming—Inglourious Basterds  is as much talk-talk as bang-bang. Or rather, as Andrew Sarris  described the characteristic Budd Boetticher  Western, it's a "floating poker game," in which characters, many of whom have assumed false identities, take turns bluffing for their lives.
The first of a half-dozen one-on-one verbal jousts pits a taciturn salt-of-the-earth peasant against a loquacious Nazi colonel, Hans Landa  (Christoph Waltz ), who, humorously officious, hypnotizes his prey with a twinkling eye, giant grin, and steady stream of civilized chatter. Landa, the S.S. functionary assigned to rid France of Jews, is not only the movie's villain, but also its master of revels. Waltz's turn isn't the lone showy performance—Mike Myers  has a ripe cameo as the British general who conceives the film's convoluted Operation Kino, and Diane Kruger  is convincingly unconvincing as a German movie diva channeling Mata Hari. (Her exasperated "Can you Americans speak any other language except English?" brought down the house at Cannes.)
But there's a reason why the hitherto unknown Waltz was named Best Actor at Cannes, appears on the current Film Comment  cover, and is the subject of an "Arts & Leisure" profile. Waltz's elegant and clever S.S. man is the movie's most crowd-pleasing creation—another in the long line of glamorous Hollywood Nazis. (See: Tom Cruise  in Valkyrie  for a recent example.) Indeed, this smooth operator is Eichmann as fun guy! He's also a European sissy whose "barbaric" antagonists are a squad of Jewish-American commandos led by wily hillbilly Aldo Raine  (Brad Pitt ). The Jews are out for blood, and Raine promises his eponymous Basterds that, under his leadership, they will terrorize the Germans with "Apache tactics," demanding only that each contribute 100 Nazi scalps.
Given its subject and the director's track record, Inglourious Basterds  has less mayhem than one might expect. There's nothing comparable here—either as choreographed violence or virtuoso filmmaking—to the D-Day landing that opens Saving Private Ryan . (But neither is there anything as false, sanctimonious, and emotionally manipulative as the rest of Spielberg's movie.) Inglourious Basterds  is essentially conceptual and, as with any Western, all about determining the nature of permissible aggression. Operating like a cross between the Dirty Dozen and a Nazi death squad, the Basterds take no prisoners—designated "survivors" are shipped back to Germany, swastikas carved in their foreheads to spook the brass. The rest are sent to Valhalla, most spectacularly by Sgt. Donny Donowitz  (exploitation director Eli Roth ), who uses a Louisville  slugger to bash German brains. "Watching Donny beat Nazis to death is as close as we get to the movies," one of the Basterds exults, tipping Tarantino's hand.
The heroine of, and most artificial construct in, Inglourious Basterds  is Shosanna Dreyfus  (Mélanie Laurent ), Jewish survivor of a Nazi massacre, hiding in plain sight as the proprietress of a Paris movie theater. "We have respect for directors in this country," she curtly tells the flirtatious German soldier who wonders why she includes G.W. Pabst 's name on her marquee. Shosanna articulates Tarantino's own cinephile credo: His characters live and die in (and sometimes at) the movies, and only there. Tarantino can't resist dispatching two characters in a John Woo –style slow-mo double shoot-out staged in a projection booth, or taunting Hitler  (Martin Wuttke ) and Goebbels (Sylvester Groth , re-creating his role in Dani Levy 's recently released My Führer ) by forcing them to witness an allusion from their supposed favorite movie—Metropolis  —in what could be their final moments on earth.
In a sense, Inglourious Basterds  is a form of science fiction. Everything unfolds in and maps an alternate universe: The Movies. Even Shosanna's Parisian neighborhood bears a marked resemblance to a Cannes back alley, complete with a club named for a notorious local dive. Inflammable nitrate film is a secret weapon. Goebbels is an evil producer; the German war hero who pursues Shosanna has (like America's real-life Audie Murphy ) become a movie star. Set to David Bowie 's Cat People  title-song, the scene in which Shosanna—who is, of course, also an actor—applies her war paint to become the glamorous "face of Jewish vengeance," is an interpolated music video. Actresses give autographs at their peril. The spectacular climax has the newly dead address those about to die from the silver screen. Operation Kino depends not only on Shosanna's movie house and the German movie diva's complicity, but a heroic film critic (!), played by Michael Fassbender .
