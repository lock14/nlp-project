         "Green Street Hooligans" serves up a lot of bone-crushing violence in an offbeat context with considerable style and energy, but the steady diet of brutal street fighting makes it all but impossible to connect with this picture, despite whatever visceral appeal it may offer.
 
  Elijah Wood's Matt Buckner is a Harvard journalism major two months from graduation when he's expelled for dealing drugs. He's not the guilty party, but he feels unable to take on the real culprit and his formidable political family. For taking the fall he accepts a $10,000 payment and heads for London to visit his sister (Claire Forlani), where he immediately meets the younger brother, Pete (Charlie Hunnam), of his brother-in-law Steve (Marc Warren).
 


         






    Pete is a rangy, charismatic fellow who is not merely a soccer fan but also the leader of the Green Street Elite, a "firm," a euphemism for gang, that rabidly supports the West Ham football team (never, Matt is informed, call it soccer). Matt, at loose ends, swiftly becomes a member of the gang — even though Pete's sour second-in-command, Bovver (Leo Gregory), is automatically opposed because Matt is a Yank. It is crystal clear that Bovver spells big trouble.
 
  The GSE is committed to continual warfare with firms of other teams. When the GSE is not slugging it out in the streets, sometimes with lethal consequences, they are boozing it up in their favorite pub. That the firm's members are by and large gainfully employed and have families frankly makes their addiction to violence seem all the more pathetic.
 
  Wood is a sufficiently talented actor to be able to make persuasive the shattered and rootless Matt's vulnerability to the GSE with its endless opportunities to express aggression and its strong sense of belonging. But he lacks the physicality to seem a credible brawler, to the detriment of the picture.
 
  The strongest plus is director and co-writer Lexi Alexander's ability to make understandable how these young — and not-so-young — men become intoxicated by violence, but this is not the same thing as being able to identify or empathize with them.
 
  At the end of the day they're just a pack of thugs, and the best that one can hope for them is that the old Mafia adage applies: "We only kill each other." Too bad these guys don't work things out on the mat or in the ring; ironically, Alexander is a former kickboxing and karate champion who made a deeply affecting Oscar-nominated dramatic short, "Johnny Flynton," about a boxer who strives to contain his aggressive feelings to his matches.
 
  Alexander has tremendous energy, passion and filmmaking flair, but "Green Street Hooligans," which has its share of unfortunate dialogue, careens out of control, culminating in all-out carnage interlaced with sentimental heroics.
 
  The only emotion it ultimately evokes is one of relief that after 106 minutes of grown men getting off on beating each other up it is over.

 In "Green Street Hooligans," a feature-length folly about the terrors and self-affirming joys of football (that is, soccer) hooliganism, the young British actor Charlie Hunnam enters in full swagger. A fine-boned beauty who holds the screen with ease, Mr. Hunnam plays his character, Pete Dunham, a full-time teacher and part-time thug, as a sexual predator. But here's the rub: the object of Pete's desire isn't the pretty girl (or boy) next door, but the sneering, shouting and swearing fans across the stadium. Like his equally hopped-up friends, he can't wait to have his way with them.  Along with war, sports has long been the arena for straight men to work out their issues with one another, and while not stated outright, it's brutally clear that all the punching, pounding, shoving, stomping and head-butting in this film are the vehicle for some serious sublimation. The love that dare speak its name here is for football. The love that dare not is among nominally heterosexual men who prefer hoisting a few pints, and generally more, with their mates down at the pub rather than staying home with the little woman. Such is the case in "Green Street Hooligans," an accidental advertisement for Alcoholics Anonymous and the somnolent pleasures of cricket that, in the end, is mostly about the pleasures, both visceral and visual, of violence.  The trace of a plot wedged between all the body blows involves a young American, Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood), who, after getting booted out of Harvard, ends up in London ladding about with Pete in support of West Ham United Football Club. The two are in-laws and apparently a match made in buddy heaven. This implausible conceit is meant to explain how this whiny American washout (and would-be journalist) ends up roughing it with men whose appetite for destruction is more whetted than their love for the game. What it doesn't remotely explain are the social whys and logistical hows of such hooliganism. For this, interested parties are directed toward Bill Buford's book "Among the Thugs," a vastly entertaining account of football fandom gone horrifyingly amok.  "Green Street Hooligans" was directed and written by Lexi Alexander, a former karate and kickboxing champion from Germany with a couple of films under her black belt. Her latest offering certainly possesses energy: it starts fast and rarely lets up. This pumped-up, accelerated pace works for its seemingly innumerable fight scenes, but the truth is that once you have seen one glass bottle shatter over a guy's head, you have pretty much seen them all. When toward the end of the film Ms. Alexander shows the hooligans at their day jobs - behind desks, in ties and suits - these shards of normalcy register as both surprising and disappointing since, at long last, the filmmaker seems to be acknowledging that there really is more to life than boozing, brawling and sports. Who knew?  "Green Street Hooligans" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It features a full menu of bloodletting, though there are no guns.

Unvarnished verisimilitude, visceral impact and vividly evoked emotional and physical extremes distinguish "Hooligans," the impressive debut feature by German-born helmer Lexi Alexander. The hype machinery will doubtless be fueled by the novelty of a woman directing an intense, unblinkingly violent drama about rabid soccer fans viciously clashing in the streets of London. (This particular woman is a former World Kickboxing champ, a fact that will likely loom large in the press coverage.) Still, drama will require special handling (and imaginative selling) to click in theatrical and homevid venues with U.S. auds whose interest in the sport is less than rabid.

"Hooligans" won both the grand jury prize and the audience award for feature at SXSW -- the first time in fest history that both awards have gone to same pic.
Alexander cleverly makes a running gag of American attitudes about Brit football while using a Yank as p.o.v. protag to guide aud through possibly unfamiliar territory. In the scenario the helmer co-wrote with Dougie Brimson and Josh Shelov, ace journalism student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is kicked out of Harvard weeks before graduation when his roommate, scion of a wealthy political clan, frames him to take the fall for cocaine found in their dorm suite.
Matt flies to London to visit expat sister Shannon (Claire Forlani), who's married to devoted yet moody Steve Dunham (Marc Warren). But Matt arrives at an inopportune time, so he's temporarily passed off to Steve's boisterous brother, Pete (Charlie Hunnam of Douglas McGrath's "Nicholas Nickleby"), who's frankly hostile to unwelcome Yank visitors.
Begrudgingly respectful of Matt's attempt to rebuff his intimidating tactics, however, Pete decides to take the tourist under his wing. He introduces Matt to his friends, fellow members of the GSE -- Green Street Elite -- the fan-comprised "firm" that loyally supports the West Ham football team. (Under no circumstances, Pete warns Matt, should the Yank ever
 use the word "soccer.")
Matt proves to be an unexpectedly tenacious (albeit inexperienced) fighter when the GSE takes on thugs from an opposing firm.That's more than enough to ingratiate Matt with the GSE members.
However, when the instinctively suspicious Bovver (Leo Gregory) uncovers evidence suggesting Matt may be an undercover journalist, he betrays the Yank and the entire GSE to Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell), a rival firm boss with a long-standing beef against Pete's family.
Evidencing a no-B.S. approach to hand-to-hand (and brick-to-head) mayhem that's unusual in this era of ever-increasing CGI body counts, Alexander dares to present a type of movie violence that's all the more unsettling for its blunt-force simplicity. She walks a fine line between honest dramatization and cynical exploitation, all the while acknowledging that, like it or not, there's something undeniably exhilarating about kicking ass.
"Hooligans" owes a great deal to "The Firm," the late Alan Clarke's near-legendary 1988 pic starring Gary Oldman in a career highlight perf as an increasingly violent football fan. But Alexander repays the debt by never shying away from showing how even seemingly civilized men can become animalistic while hunting in packs.
Wood is burdened with some of the pic's most tin-eared, over-emphatic dialogue -- script could have used at least one more rewrite to scrape away the more obvious cliches -- and he lays on the moist-eyed innocence a tad too thickly in early scenes. But he's very adept at rendering Matt's evolution during his slow, steady immersion into a culture of violence.
Often resembling Brad Pitt's younger, more pissed-off sibling, Hunnam hits the perfect balance of authority and anarchy, low cunning and instinctive decency. For all his madcap brawling and bad-boy attitude, he has more than sufficient gravitas to banish a traitor from the firm with a succinct command -- "Go away!" -- and make it sound like the sudden judgment of an angry god.
In key supporting roles, Warren and Bell score with forceful portrayals, and Forlani breathes fresh life into the stock role of a woman who wants her man to stop scuffling with other folks. Gregory memorably limns all aspects of a character who's equal parts Iago, Judas Iscariot and Jedediah Leland. Lenser Alexander Buono and editor Paul Trejo make violent sequences crackle with a genuinely terrifying anything-can-happen excitement.
Regardless of how "Hooligans" fares, pic amply demonstrates that Alexander -- director of "Johnny Flynton," 2003 Oscar nominee for dramatic short -- has the chops to bring a fresh take to onscreen rough stuff. Hollywood will beckon.

Lexi Alexander 's debut feature owes its pint-fueled proletarian angst and aggro to David Fincher  and Alan Clarke . Hooligans  nods at Fight Club  with whip-pan-filled melees and a not-more-than-usual amount of unaddressed homoerotic exclusivity ("What happens at football stays at football"). But in reality, it's rarely about football for the "soccer" hooligan, who privileges pre-arranged beat-downs over bicycle kicksan irony that the film's punch-up porn problematically acknowledges. Enlisting Nicholas Nickleby  and a hobbit to play a hard East Ender and his Yank protégé seems ludicrous, but Charlie Hunnam  is charismatic as a Green Street alpha geezer and Elijah Wood 's all wide-eyed innocence as a disgraced Harvard J-student who falls in with the West Ham  lads. Hunnam, whose cockney ranges from dodgy to downright Caine-ian, mutes Gary Oldman 's bestial mouth-froth (in Clarke's 1988 The Firm ), becoming the prettiest, most articulate, bloodthirsty thug ever to put lip to lager. He nicks the film, lock, stock, and something about a barrel. Hooligans  loses the plot late thoughin the filmic and Brit-speak senserevealing Hollywood , not hooligan, roots.
