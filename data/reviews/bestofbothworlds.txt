The side-by-side release of U2 3D  and Hannah Montana  & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert  invites you to line up the pop past and pop future in fascinating tandem. It's routine wisdom to say that U2 is the greatest rock & roll band of the past 25 years (depending on the day, I'd go with R.E.M., but who's quibbling?), yet this raises a question: Will the next  25 years produce a band with the passion and power, the transporting sweep, of U2? The rise of the tween-fashionista mechano-pop juggernaut Hannah Montana doesn't bode well.
I can't, offhand, think of an entertainer who could dignify the prospect of a 3-D movie more than Bono. If he says 3-D is a noble cause, that's good enough for me. I wasn't sure what to expect from U2 3D   the Edge tossing guitar picks into our faces?  but the film, shot in South America during the band's Vertigo tour, comes at us in images that are nearly sculptural. The 3-D visuals envelop you, majestically, and that effect fuses with the band's surround-sound rapture to create a full-scale sensory high. U2 3D  makes you feel stoned on movies.
On this tour, U2 had cleaned away a lot of their stage bric-a-brac, and what we're left with is great songs (''Pride,'' ''One,'' the incomparable ''With or Without You''), plus a few duds (''Bullet the Blue Sky''), as Bono, with his soaring message of global love, rules the crowd like a hippie cult leader. The Edge doesn't just create walls of sound  he creates cathedrals of sound. It's hard to imagine, in the digital era, downloading a band as monumental  as this one.
Rock & roll may never die, but you know it's been eaten by the consumer culture when you see Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert , in which the bouncy diva of prepubescent bubblegum pantomimes every rebel-yell gesture in history, all to exalt girl-power attitude as something you can acquire . Hannah is presented, explicitly, as Miley Cyrus' alter ego (she performs first as Hannah, then as herself  the only difference being Hannah's blond wig), and that's a stroke of marketing genius, since what it says is that anyone can be Hannah. Cyrus, an apple-cheeked dumpling, resembles Pia Zadora, but when she exhorts the crowd, it's with the martial efficiency of Hillary Clinton. Her music isn't even trying for the beauty of, say, Backstreet Boys, but her message is commanding: It's that girl power has trumped boy power. The sound leans on Avril Lavigne's prefab buzz guitar, but it also draws hooks from '80s songs like ''Kids in America'' and ''Summer of '69.'' As a soundtrack for empowerment, not to mention tween shopping (is there a difference now?), one could do worse. Hannah Montana : B- ; U2 3D :

 Correction Appended  “Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts,” Paul Simon once sang, and in 2008 there’s Miley Cyrus (excuse me, Miley Ray Cyrus)  — on television, on the iTunes Top 10 and in theaters with this 3-D artifact of her just concluded tour. Bygone decades had Donny Osmond, Menudo and New Kids on the Block. Today Walt Disney — which also spawned Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera — feeds tweens their pop idols. But don’t call it packaged teenage rebellion. In this movie  there are few teenagers and no rebellion, only bouncy inspirational ditties. “I Miss You,” a wholesome ode to Ms. Cyrus’s dead grandfather, is as doleful as it gets.  What you do see are diverting 3-D effects and lots of playing to the camera by Ms. Cyrus, who performs as both herself and as her television alter ego, Hannah Montana. To her credit her attire isn’t tawdry, and it appears that she can sing.  What you also see is Kenny Ortega (the mastermind behind “High School Musical”), this year’s Lou Pearlman, reassuring Ms. Cyrus after she has been literally dropped onstage by her dancers. Taking orders from adults can’t be fun for a 15-year-old on a grinding three-month concert-go-round.  Not that you’ll learn that here, or much about Ms. Cyrus. Does it matter? Not to your “Hannah Montana”-addicted daughter. She’ll be listening to other music soon enough. Maybe Ms. Cyrus will be making it. Maybe.

"You know, I didn't expect so much screaming," confides one father between flashy production numbers in "Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert." But the ear-piercing pandemonium emanates less from the audience than from within this quickie concert docu, spiffed up via 3-D presentation, since the fancy specs and all-access shooting style actually serve to discourage target aud's natural sing-along tendencies. Mixing concert footage with behind-the-scenes interstitials, pic looks poised to rack up awesome returns during its one-week, digital 3-D run, at least in per-screen terms. Seems Disney has discovered yet another way to print money.
For the uninitiated, Hannah Montana is the stage name of ordinary girl Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus, daughter of achy-breaky country hitmaker Billy Ray Cyrus), who leads a double life: awkward high schooler by day, pop sensation by night. "Hannah Montana's" split-identity theme carries over to the concert, in which Cyrus performs hit songs from the show in character (complete with platinum-blonde, Cher-style wig) before switching to original numbers as herself, topping it all off with the self-explanatory "Best of Both Worlds" single.
Between songs, helmer Bruce Hendricks ("ESPN's Ultimate X") cuts to 2-D backstage footage, spotlighting either Cyrus' rehearsal process or testimonials from her most enthusiastic fans. One amusing background scene shows fathers racing in high-heeled shoes across wet pavement for a chance to win tickets for their daughters, but most merely serve to interrupt the momentum, more like commercial breaks than attention-deficit energy-boosters.
It's all engineered as part of the Miley Cyrus mythmaking effort, reinforcing the classic Disney dream that anyone can become the studio's next pop sensation (never mind the grueling yearlong audition process that landed her the gig).
Unlike ex-Mouseketeers-gone-bad Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, Cyrus still projects a chaste, wholesome image of teenage fun, and she performs without all the trampy, sexualized theatrics, making her a less toxic role model for all those screaming tweens.
Audience is made up largely of ecstatic little girls, overwhelmed dads and ironically inclined college kids. But even stage-side seats would have been a pale comparison to this virtual experience, as the view alternates among seven cameras, most mounted on cranes. Dynamic camera moves, not those of the vanilla backup dancers (choreographed by "High School Musical" director Kenny Ortega), best serve the movie's three-dimensional element.
Movie picks up momentum midway through, when Cyrus is joined by the three Jonas Brothers, who know exactly how to play the crowd and the cameras. As 3-D goes, watching them criss-cross in space proves more engaging than observing one strutting performer.
Stereo ace Vince Pace doesn't push the 3-D gimmick too far, keeping depth of field relatively shallow throughout. Cyrus' character appears slightly forward of the screen at most times, meaning the only objects that loom out into the auditorium are disembodied audience hands in the foreground or the occasional z-axis gag (tossing a used guitar pick into the crowd or jousting with the mic stand). The single most impressive shot hovers above the band's drummer as he flips a stick, letting it spiral toward the camera before catching it again.
Unlike "U2 3D," which uses a sophisticated system of overlapping dissolves to create a unique multilayered effect, "Hannah Montana" deals exclusively in hard cuts between shots. The approach makes for a less mesmerizing experience overall, but is still relatively intuitive to follow.
