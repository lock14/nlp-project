For his first movie since "Crash," Paul Haggis switches from the problem of racism to the problem of Iraq. The war is a better fit. None of the exasperating guilt on display in "Crash" has made it into "In the Valley of Elah," a solidly made genre movie: the Army mystery.
Mike Deerfield (Jonathan Tucker), a young soldier, returns from a tour in Iraq and is declared AWOL after his first weekend on base in New Mexico. The boy's father, Hank (Tommy Lee Jones), takes the phone call and decides to drive over from Tennessee to get some answers. Hank is a former Army man himself and has already lost one son in combat. The idea of losing a second is too much for his wife, played by an underused Susan Sarandon.
Hank involves himself in the investigation, dropping by the base and talking to the men in his son's unit. The missing-persons case becomes a turf skirmish between local detectives and the military police. Charlize Theron shows up as Emily Sanders, the lead detective, and she appears to have had the job for about 10 minutes.
When we meet her, a gang of male co-workers is giving her a hard time while she deals with a possible abuse case. It's as though Theron came straight from the chauvinist climes of "North Country" to the ones in this movie. The woman she's playing in "Elah," though, doesn't actually always know what she's doing. Hank often shows Emily what she's missed at the crime scene, and those scenes between Jones and Theron are deftly played. Hank is wiser and, in most matters forensic, smarter than Emily, but she doesn't cede her authority. She simply learns from her mistakes.
The politics of this investigation - the lady detective having to fight against all these men, including her boss (Josh Brolin) and a stubborn Army lieutenant (Jason Patric) - threaten to push things off their path into a different movie. Hank hires a tech wizard (Rick Gonzalez) to hack into Mike's phone and retrieve video footage he took in Iraq. The hacker can't clean up the files all at once, so he e-mails them to Hank one by one.
The descrambled footage becomes a story unto itself. But it's also an aggravating device meant to stand in for the flashbacks that, interestingly, Haggis doesn't use. When Mike's fellow soldiers tell Hank and Emily stories about their AWOL comrade, Haggis could have used the opportunity to show the events but the camera lingers on the faces of the actors, which is a shrewd choice since the film is ultimately a study of military character and military culture. (Wes Chatham, Mehcad Brooks, Victor Wolf, and Jake McLaughlin are striking in the soldiers' parts, especially McLaughlin.)
Yet as you might expect from the man who brought us "Crash," Haggis overreaches. The explanation of the biblical title (it's where David slew Goliath) didn't enrich my appreciation of his parable-deployment skills. Neither did Haggis's attempt to extrapolate a larger indictment about the damage done to this country as a result of this war courtesy of a shot of the American flag being flown upside down as a distress signal.
It's the small moments that say everything in this movie. Haggis just doesn't trust them enough, even though they're damning. As the facts come to light, it seems Hank didn't really know his son. He more or less gave his boy to the Army and no longer recognizes the damaged young man Mike has become or the deranging military culture that produced him and his peers.
If the camera never left Jones, the movie would be some kind of masterpiece. It doesn't look like he's doing anything more than playing another grizzled know-it-all. But he lends soul to this character's stoicism. It's extremely affecting watching a man discover that the heart he thought dried up long ago can still break. That upside-down flag is right there in Jones's face.


         Though it sounds like a picturesque spot, no one is bringing a picnic lunch or having any fun "In the Valley of Elah." The characters in this somber film have the glum look of individuals delivering a Very Important Message to the world. And  though this film in fact does have something crucial to convey, this is not the way to go about it.
 
 Directed by Paul Haggis in his follow-up to the Oscar-winning "Crash," "In the Valley of Elah" (named, it's not clear why, after the place David met Goliath) is an honorable, earnest film that deals with a subject not usually touched by Hollywood: the pernicious effect war in general and the current one in particular has on the young people we send to fight. "He couldn't wait to get over there, to help the good guys," a friend says of one such soldier, adding pointedly, "We shouldn't send heroes to places like Iraq."
 


         






   But, paradoxically, the film's sense of responsibility proves almost paralyzing, allowing the production to be overwhelmed by the seriousness of what it's attempting. Almost all of "Elah's" elements, from the somber music of Mark Isham to the intentionally washed-out cinematography of the gifted Roger Deakins, combine to leach out whatever vigor the film might have.
 
 This lethargy extends to stars Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron, neither of whom does exactly galvanizing work. And though the film's powerful themes ultimately get a hearing, it takes a while to get there: The exposition's lumbering pace (Haggis, initially inspired by a Mark Boal magazine article, did the script) gives "Elah" a plodding quality that doesn't dissipate until things heat up in the second hour.
 
 "Elah's" narrative proper begins with an early morning phone call to the Tennessee home of Hank Deerfield (Jones) letting him know that his soldier son Mike is not in Iraq as he supposes but a) newly returned to the U.S. and b) AWOL from his barracks in New Mexico. That just doesn't sound like my boy, says Dad, who decides to drive across the country and find out just where Mike is.
 
 Deerfield would seem well-qualified to take on this quest. More than just a patriot who's a zealot for flag etiquette, the man is a retired MP, a former Army lifer with beaucoup investigative skills and, inevitably, a long-suffering wife (an underutilized Susan Sarandon) he leaves at home.
 
 But once in New Mexico, even a man of Deerfield's skills hits a brick wall. Not that everyone on the base isn't super-polite, but no one is especially forthcoming and for all intents and purposes, it seems that Mike has simply disappeared into thin air.
 
 In desperation, Deerfield goes to the local police, where he runs into detective Emily Sanders (Theron), who is having adjustment problems of her own and is unable to help with a strictly Army matter. But then a body is found on a remote corner of city property, and the discovery changes everything.
 
 That scenario may sound dynamic, but it isn't. For one thing, everything in "Valley of Elah" takes too long to play out, and there are eventually so many threads to track down in Mike's disappearance, including moving images gradually recovered from his mobile phone, that it is easy to lose interest.
 
  Though it is satisfying to see Theron in a pulled-back role as a solid citizen detective, the glumness of "In the Valley of Elah" affects her as well. The film likes the thought of Sanders and Deerfield as an investigative odd couple, but they come off as no more than Grim and Grimmer, too mournful a team to make any kind of emotional connection with an audience.
 
 Though Jones is too effective an actor not to make his presence felt, starring him in "Elah" creates problems that didn't need to be there. Jones' characters are difficult in the best of circumstances, and having him play an unapologetically surly and unpleasant pain in the neck, no matter what the reasons, makes Hank Deerfield almost impossible to sympathize with. Haggis initially thought of Clint Eastwood, an actor who can do intensity without Jones' truculent baggage, and that would have been much the better choice.
 
 Perhaps the most unexpected way to see where "In the Valley of Elah" could have been stronger is to compare it  with the highly adrenalized "The Bourne Ultimatum." Unlikely as it seems, both films share an interest in the effect propaganda about the necessity of doing "what it takes to save American lives" has on the soldiers subjected to it. Admittedly a very different kind of film, "In the Valley of Elah" could have used some of "Bourne's" life force in spreading its critical message.

In the Valley of Elah , the first film Paul Haggis has written and directed since Crash , is exactly the sort of movie America needs right now  a lacerating, bone-deep inquiry into the war in Iraq, one that struggles to find meaning in the very chaos of that conflict. It's no secret that those of us who have never been in a war have probably ingested much of what we ''know'' of the experience of combat from the movies. In the Valley of Elah  isn't a combat film per se, but its dramatic power is rooted in the violent mystery of battle  in the awe and anxiety and, yes, the curiosity we feel when we imagine our soldiers in a place like Iraq and think, What is it that defines this  war? This particular hell?
The film is actually a Stateside murder mystery, and it's a beautifully executed one: tense, and meditative (at times a little too  meditative), with most of the bogus genre conventions scraped away. I'm one of those people who couldn't abide Crash , with its phony checkerboard structure and glib talky quality-network-drama racial dialectics, but Haggis, teaming up with the great emotional minimalist Tommy Lee Jones, has turned over an austere and authentic new leaf. He has found the terse poetry of the everyday.
Jones' Hank Deerfield is a retired Army sergeant and Vietnam veteran who hauls gravel for a living. He's sitting in his Tennessee home when he learns that his son, Mike (Jonathan Tucker), who is scheduled to be returning from a tour of duty in Iraq, has gone missing. With barely a word to his wife (Susan Sarandon), Hank drives to Fort Rudd in New Mexico, where he meets his son's platoon buddies, all of whom have come home safely. None of them really want to answer his questions, and neither do the officers, but Hank soon learns the bitter truth, when the charred pieces of his son's body are found by a desert road near the base.
The Army investigators want the incident swept under the rug, and the local cops  there's a question, based on where the murder took place, of which party has jurisdiction  are just apathetic. Except, that is, for Det. Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron), a sympathetic desk jockey Hank cajoles into helping him pursue the case. Hank manages to swipe his son's camera phone from his quarters and bring it to a local street hacker, who decodes the files and sends them along, one by one. As Hank watches the jerky, staticky replays of Mike's missions in Iraq, the videos are like something out of Blow-Up   we scan every last inch of those digital ''bricks'' to learn the truth of what went on, and how, if at all, it might explain his murder. Hank's amateur sleuthing, driven by a father's sorrow and rage, has an arresting low-key gravitas.
In the Valley of Elah  is based on the case of Specialist Richard R. Davis, who, after returning from Iraq, was found dead of multiple stab wounds four summers ago. In the film, all the clues that Hank uncovers  a midnight meal at the local chicken joint, the possible involvement of drugs  carry the fascinating banal sting of true crime. The film was shot by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, and he gives it a high-bureaucratic '70s classicism  the grip of stately fluorescence. The power of In the Valley of Elah  is that Hank, in trying to learn how Mike was killed, is really delving, step by step, into the reality of the Iraq battle zone he came from. The roadside bombs, in their relentless anonymity; the orders to regard every civilian, even children, as a potential threat: How, exactly, does all of this shatter the nerves, and maybe shred the souls, of the men who are there? That's what drives the movie  the slow, accumulating revelation of how the war in Iraq, in its unique physical and moral circumstances (which can't be divided), has molded the soldiers fighting it.
Tommy Lee Jones, even when he was a young actor, always had a tense face, with its creased forehead and wounded, accusatory eyes. The creases are deeper now, and so, in this role, are the wounds, but Jones, in a powerful performance, somehow holds every emotion in and shows it to you anyway. Hank's tightly etched control  the demeanor of a lifelong military man  serves the movie's ideological purpose: It puts us on the side of a patriot who is not in any way questioning ''the troops''  who, in fact, wouldn't have it in him to do so. He does ask this, though: What is what we're doing in Iraq doing to us? The title refers to the setting of the David and Goliath story, with America, in Haggis' metaphorical scheme, cast as the giant caught off guard. That's a profoundly unsettling idea, but In the Valley of Elah  also uses the American flag to bring you to tears. It's the first Hollywood Iraq movie to remind me of a Vietnam film like Coming Home , and it does more than disturb. It scalds, moves, and heals.


Viewed from one angle — straight on, from the ground level of its busy plot — “In the Valley of Elah” might be mistaken for a tidy crime procedural. A retired military police officer named Hank Deerfield (played by Tommy Lee Jones with his usual brisk, gruff economy) learns that his son Mike (Jonathan Tucker), an Army specialist recently returned from Iraq, has gone AWOL from his base in New Mexico. Before long, the young man’s charred and dismembered remains are found in the desert, and Hank joins Emily Sanders, a local detective played by Charlize Theron, in trying to figure out who could have done such a terrible thing to his boy. As in an episode of “Law & Order,” suspicion veers one way and then another as new information comes to light. Was it drug dealers? Gang members? Soldiers from the young man’s own squad? Was Mike himself guilty of terrible things? Paul Haggis, the writer and director, obeys the rules of the whodunit genre by providing answers to some of the basic, literal questions at the center of the film. And considered strictly as a crime drama, “In the Valley of Elah” is a bit pedestrian, with a few too many set pieces, extraneous subplots and predictable turns. But an air of irresolution nonetheless lingers around it, a sorrowful, frustrated sense that the deepest mysteries cannot be contained within any narrative framework. Underneath its deceptively quiet surface is a raw, angry, earnest attempt to grasp the moral consequences of the war in Iraq, and to stare without blinking into the chasm that divides those who are fighting it from their families, their fellow citizens and one another. This is not to say that the detective story,  suggested by the actual murder of Specialist Richard Davis in 2003, is entirely beside the point. Rather, the mechanics of the plot — the forensic discoveries, the squabbles over jurisdiction between military and civilian authority, the rounds of paperwork and the squad-room arguments — serve as the scaffolding for a more unsettling, open-ended inquiry. Much as Hank wants to know what happened to Mike the night he died, his real quest is to find out who his son was, and what happened to him in Iraq. The only clues he has are some JPEGs his son e-mailed to him, the memory of a desperate late-night phone call from the war zone and some smeary, scrambled video recovered from Mike’s cellphone. These hectic, unfocused clips stand in jarring, pointed contrast to the neatly composed frames and carefully paced shots that make up most of Mr. Haggis’s film, and they pose an agonizing challenge: How do you extract meaning from such chaos? To his great credit, Mr. Haggis tries to coax an answer out of his story rather than imposing one on it from the start, as he did in “Crash.” That film, which owes its best-picture Oscar to the dedication of its cast and the obviousness of its themes, turned racial intolerance into fodder for a self-righteous, schematic allegory. While “In the Valley of Elah” has its share of overreaching and throat clearing — including clumsy references to the biblical story of David and Goliath, the source of its title — it is mostly free of moral grandstanding. (A brief scene in which Hank gives voice to some of his half-buried ethnic bigotry is more credible than any of the similar moments that make up most of “Crash.”) Not that the message of “In the Valley of Elah” is ambiguous or unclear. The message is that the war in Iraq has damaged this country in ways we have only begun to grasp. For some people this will seem like old news. Others — in particular those who pretend that railing against movies they haven’t seen is a form of rational political discourse — may persuade themselves that it is provocative or controversial. But however you judge the movie’s politics, and whatever its flaws, there is something inarguable, something irreducibly honest and right, about Mr. Jones’s performance. Hank exists on a continuum with the other lawmen he has recently played, in particular the Texas sheriffs in “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,” which he directed, and Joel and Ethan Coen’s “No Country for Old Men,” which will be released later this fall. Like them, Hank carries around an innate sense of right and wrong, and Mr. Jones’s creased face, at once kindly and severe, is a manifest sign of his old-school temperament. Hank is the kind of man who shines his shoes every night, says grace before each meal and makes his motel-room bed according to military standards. It’s unlikely that a veteran M.P., whose service covered at least some of the Vietnam years, would entertain the illusion that all fighting men are Boy Scouts. But it is clear that Hank has both a general fondness for soldiers and a father’s assumption that he knows his own son. That may be part of why the grisly nature of Mike’s fate, and the possibility that some of his buddies were responsible for it, disturbs him so much. Something, he suspects, has gone terribly wrong with the institutions and the men he has always loved and trusted. At every point, as Hank nags and pushes Emily in her investigation, the movie registers the panic and dread that he fights to keep down. These feelings come through to some extent in the reactions of his wife, Joan (Susan Sarandon), whom he tries to protect, but more decisively, and more hauntingly, through the moods Mr. Haggis creates (with the crucial assistance of Roger Deakins, the cinematographer responsible for the movie’s austere, washed-out look, and Mark Isham, who wrote the eerie, sparingly applied musical score). Almost no violence takes place on screen, but there are times when “In the Valley of Elah” feels almost like a horror film. Its steady crescendo of suspense builds toward the revelation — and vanquishing — of some unspeakable, monstrous evil. But since the monster has no identifiable physical shape, it is not so easily defeated. While there are killers, liars and sadists to be found in this movie, there are not really any villains. And there is no reassuring conclusion. If it is anguished, even despairing, “In the Valley of Elah” is also compassionate. At heart it is a somber ballad about young men who remain lost in a dangerous, confusing place even after they come home. “In the Valley of Elah” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are some violent scenes and a general atmosphere of brutality and fear.

The Iraq war has proven as nettlesome to Hollywood moviemakers as it has to Washington policymakers, and "In the Valley of Elah" continues the trend. Working overtime to be an important statement on domestic dissatisfaction with the war and the special price paid by vets and their families, Paul Haggis' follow-up to "Crash" is too self-serious to work as a straight-ahead whodunit and too lacking in imagination to realize its art-film aspirations. Lightning probably won't strike twice for Haggis, with prestigious fall festival premieres unlikely to translate into strong domestic cash flow for Warner Independent, though foreign returns could be brighter.
At its heart, "Elah's" storytelling (inspired from a true story first reported by Mark Boal in Playboy) is the stuff of a James Patterson thriller rather than a grandly elegiac reading of one father's tragedy. Unwilling to opt for the pulp-trash excesses of such military thrillers as "The General's Daughter," the film ends up delivering a poorly conceived message of alarm, bluntly signaling that the war is causing America's sons and daughters severe psychological damage.It also continues a line of recent movies addressing the first Gulf War ("Jarhead") and the current one ("Home of the Brave," "Grace Is Gone") that fail to capture the realities of war experience and familial angst beyond basic truisms and pictorial surfaces. 
A Vietnam vet, retired Army sergeant and Tennessee truck-hauler, Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) receives a call from Fort Rudd that his son Mike (Jonathan Tucker) is missing, though his unit is back from Iraq. Without having even a modest discussion with long-suffering wife Joan (Susan Sarandon), Hank drives to the New Mexico base to glean more information and hopefully reunite with his son. When Hank arrives, he finds that Mike's unit buddies are keeping mum and base officers like Lt. Kirklander (Jason Patric) and Sgt. Carnelli (James Franco) are little more than bureaucrat lackeys with little interest in the case.
Hank gradually earns the respect of one of the local civilian cops in neighboring Bradford, Det. Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron), informing her that Mike "has been bringing democracy to a shithole ... (and) deserves more than this." Not one for subtlety, Haggis ensures that Emily is not only the only woman in her department, forever marginalized by her male colleagues, but that she's also a single mom to a cute boy (Devin Brochu).
When a murder scene appears to be on the borderline between Army and local jurisdictions, the locals -- except increasingly suspicious Emily -- are willing to hand it over to the MPs for investigation.
The film awkwardly shifts between Hank's emotional realities -- as he watches some disturbing vid clips recovered from Mike's cell phone -- and a cycle of fairly obvious red herrings. One, involving Mike's unit buddy Robert (Victor Wolf), consumes an inordinate amount of running time, and is amounts to a one-dimensional portrayal of American-style bigotry.
While taciturn Hank, a man of so few words that he verges on being mean, cold and heartless, busts a few heads on his way to getting answers, Emily doggedly gets into extended verbal tussles with every authority figure in sight, from Kirklander to her immediate boss, police chief Buchwald (Josh Brolin).
Much of this is woefully familiar in dramatic terms, but viewers may find welcome distractions in cinematographer Roger Deakins' grandly panoramic widescreen visions of a contemporary American West -- emphasizingthe barrenness of the places people live and work -- as well as Jones' laser-focused performance, which is almost radical in its deliberately hardened flatness. As integral and crucial as each piece is to pic, both Deakins and Jones operate in worlds of their own, almost intimidating in their individual power and concentration. Theron gamely works hard to match Jones on screen, but her perf recalls the thankless roles so many of George C. Scott's many co-stars had to settle for. While vet thesps like Patric, Sarandon and Brolin come and go (even the superb Frances Fisher, as a topless barkeep, feels underused), rookie actor and Iraq vet Jake McLaughlin has a few exceptional scenes with Jones that impressively suggest a hidden world of hurt.
Most production departments, particularly Laurence Bennett's site-specific production design, are solid, though considerably less of Mark Isham's plodding and glum score would have been more; ditto some of the song choices (including a closer by Annie Lennox). Odd title, which will surely be a commercial impediment, alludes to the Israeli location of the biblical battle between David and Goliath.

Loosely drawn from a 2004 Playboy  piece about the killing of a soldier who went AWOL while on furlough from Iraq , Paul Haggis 's wildly uneven foray into the dark side of post-traumatic stress disorder focuses on parental grief, which the writer-director bravely complicates by asking what it's like for a patriot to mourn a son with a blemished record. Elah  comes packaged as a feverish murder mystery groaning beneath too many subplots and the added weight of a strained David and Goliath allegory. But once you peel away the ballast, the movie lives and breathes as a character drama with a terrific performance from Tommy Lee Jones  as the G.I.'s father. It's a vital American story, and a rare assumption of responsibility for what we ask our soldiers to do, how we ignore them when they can't, and what happens next.
