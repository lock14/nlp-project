 Less a documentary than an act of worship, “Darshan: The Embrace” is a glowing introduction to the life and work of Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, the so-called hugging saint. Recognized worldwide for her spiritual and humanitarian work, Amma, as she’s more commonly known, ministers to the poor of India with food and open arms, often for more than 20 hours at a stretch.  Jan Kounen’s awestruck film follows the mahatma from one jampacked event to another, eavesdropping as she offers advice on everything from caring for a skin condition to the correct way to feed an elephant. (The elephant, unbelievably, looks ecstatic.)  Mr. Kounen, who is Dutch, wants everyone to share his captivation: watching the white-garbed faithful line up by the thousands for a smile and a cuddle, his camera is guilty of lingering on the faces of the beautiful. Abundant shots of lush foliage, pastel-toned rooftops and sizzling sunsets are also a far cry from the images of Indian deprivation we’re accustomed to seeing on the news.  Yet this sincere and tranquil film reveals little of the woman beneath the halo. Photographs and film of the young Amma — whose family believed her to be mad — are few and fleeting, leaving a movie long on adulation but short on specifics. (Who, for instance, finances her extensive charity work, including millions of dollars to the victims of the 2004 tsunami?) Filling our heads with pretty pictures and not much else, “Darshan: The Embrace” is likely to leave audiences enchanted but unenlightened.

Talk about a hands-on vocation: "Darshan (Embracing)" follows India's world-renowned Amma -- a short, chubby woman in her early 50s with a radiant smile -- who, over three decades, has hugged more than 23 million people. Amma imparts comfort, serenity and unconditional love via touch, one person at a time, for 21 hours straight. But, far from inundating viewers with a litany of facts, Jan Kounen has his lilting camera drift through the colorful streets of India, recording Amma from a you-are-there vantage. Docu's pace will be a little too meditative for many, but the rigorous, sinewy lensing will have hypnotic power on those so inclined.
Along with cheery, quasi-profound pronouncements by Amma herself, interview testimony from Amma's disciples includes English and French-speaking Westerners, some of whom were skeptical originally but then were won over.
Footage shows Amma lick the pus from a leper's sores -- which is very effective shorthand for her saintly credentials. All possible allegations of quackdom appear to evaporate when Amma is shown accepting the Gandhi-King Prize for her work on behalf of peace and non-violence. The award's previous recipients include Kofi Annan and Nelson Mandela.
In 1979, Amma had a handful of followers and a temple in southern India that held 10 people. Today she is the irreplaceable fulcrum of a massive charitable enterprise that builds houses for the homeless, feeds the hungry, runs a hospital and an orphanage and does constant good works throughout India.
When Amma hugs people, the process resembles an incredibly affectionate book signing featuring a very
 popular author, whose readers feel free to kvetch to her about work, personal relationships and their health. With helpers keeping the crowds moving, long lines of humans are effectively "signed" by an attentive and apparently tireless Amma.
With this classily lensed venture, Kounennow has two docus under his belt about the mysterious reaches of alternative spiritual practices. "Other Worlds" (2004) documents the director's own extensive use of ritual hallucinogens under the guidance of a shaman.
Amma's gifts can't be explained but docu proves that 23 million people can't be wrong.

Darshan, the Embrace  is the kind of artistic endeavor for which the word hagiograph y  was invented: a documentary portrait of Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi , a Hindu leader who devotes her life to spreading inspiration, providing charity, and dispensing a famed spiritual embrace. At the film's climax, she hugs 45,000 admirers within a span of 21 hours. With no structure to speak of, the film documents Amma at work and interviews her breathless followers, along the way cherishing at lengthalbeit from a wide-eyed removethe beauty of Hindu culture. Without explanatory narration, the impressionistic editing is likely to prove tedious for the uninitiated. Werner Herzog 's Wheel of Time  was, in a sense, the Buddhist equivalent of this film, as well as a more illuminating look at the power and transience of ritual.
