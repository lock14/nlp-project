Here�s a neat party trick I came up with the other evening: Take The Legend of Zorro
 leads Banderas, Zeta-Jones, and Alonso and replace them with Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Freddie Boath; insert the name "Im-Ho-Tep" whenever anyone in The Legend of Zorro
 adds extraneous syllables to the word "California"; and then confuse ancient Egyptian legends with the writings of Johnston McCulley. Presto chango: Zorro�s secret identity is revealed, and it ain�t Douglas Fairbanks. (Note: This can also be performed with chilled maraschino cherries and Guy Williams, but the results are far less zesty.) What started out as a promising return to form for that mythic Mexican buckler of swash has, in a single sequel, devolved into The Mummy Returns
-lite, or, if you prefer, Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Box Office
. Adding a tyke to the mix, in this case Alonso�s Joaquin de la Vega � pint-sized scion of pop Alejandro, aka Zorro � is as old a Hollywood standby as the hairs on Freddie Bartholomew�s cadaver�s chin and twice as ticklish. While it may add a key demographic to the moviegoing mix, it also just as often alienates those fans who found the original material just fine sans Fauntleroy-isms, as is the case with this puling, strained-beets-and-formula sequel to 1998�s top-notch The Mask of Zorro
. Whereas the Zorro of yore was a cunning subversive with libidinous guerrilla panache literally leaking from his very pores � Ch� with a bullwhip � this new take is something akin to a Bizarro World, Hugh Beaumont version: Leave It to Zorro
, indeed. The interchangeability of plotlines between the aforementioned franchises is no mistake, either. Like the childhood add-ons, the narrative elements are more or less the same, e.g., parents get in trouble while acting like kids, and kids fly into action to save the day, which makes for a pretty freaky Friday any day of the week, and offers guaranteed relief to harried moms and dads utilizing the matinee as a weekend babysitter. The Legend of Zorro
 so erodes the original character it�s as though we�re receiving a glimpse of Don Diego�s hidden nightmares: lusty adventures replaced with jealous conniption fits and quality time with the li�l scamp. It doesn�t take too much effort to push the whole sagging mess into Freudian territory, but somehow I doubt that�s what director Campbell had in mind. (Then again, his directorial debut was something called The Sex Thief
, so who�s to say?) There are precious few things for a Zorro fan � or a film fan, for that matter � not to loathe about The Legend of Zorro
, not least of which is the movie�s central conceit of a shadowy New World Order hellbent on denying statehood to California, and led by Sewell no less. It�s a page torn from The Wild Wild West
�s playbook, while Zorro�s sitcomic divorce from long-suffering wife Elena and his consequent ornery bachelorhood is straight out of the Bill Bixby Guide to Modern Romance
. "People let me tell ya �bout my best friend." Thanks, no, I�m busy sharpening my rapier.

         Like the New Coke and numerous other commercial products, "The Legend of Zorro," theoretically a new and improved Zorro movie, is not as satisfying as the old and unimproved version. In a zealous attempt to broaden its appeal, the Zorro franchise has drifted from the qualities that made the previous film so successful.
 
  If 1998's "The Mask of Zorro" was spirited and sexy, "The Legend of Zorro" has designs on being, of all things, a family film. To this end, a 10-year-old boy Zorro has been added to the equation, and the results are not exciting. Imagine James Bond referring to baby formula when he says "shaken, not stirred" and you can get an idea of where the clash of cultures lies.
 


         






    This is especially problematic because many of the elements that made "The Mask of Zorro" a success return for the sequel, starting with costars Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones as jointly charismatic as ever as Don Alejandro de la Vega and his wife, Elena, a woman who has apparently received a special dispensation from authorities to wear décolleté gowns 24/7, even when dropping her son off at school early in the morning.
 
  Also back is director Martin Campbell, a man with a knack ("GoldenEye," the first Pierce Brosnan Bond vehicle, as well "Vertical Limit" and "The Mask of Zorro") for breathing life into old-fashioned action films.
 
  Working with cinematographer Phil Meheux, editor Stuart Baird and stunt coordinator Gary Powell, Campbell has put together crisply executed action sequences satisfying enough to make you wonder why they even bothered with a plot.
 
  But bother screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman did. The result, which gives over chunks of the narrative as well as action sequences to young Joaquin de la Vega (Adrian Alonso), has cramped everybody's style and helped ensure a level of kid-friendly ordinariness.
 
  Perhaps trying to balance that, "Legend" has constructed the kind of putatively adult story line for Alejandro and Elena that has them at each other's throats for most of the movie. Not the best use of a most alluring couple, but there you have it.
 
  The story is set in 1850, just before California's official entry into the Union. Alejandro's alter ego, Zorro, has been working toward this for a decade, and wife Elena has been hoping that now that it is in sight, Zorro will ride no more.
 
  It turns out that Alejandro is a classic workaholic, putting in long nights responding to injustice — and neglecting his family in the process. "You are missing your son's entire life," Elena says, just about stamping her foot. No specifics are offered about soccer games skipped and plays not attended, but we get the picture.
 
  Soon enough the De la Vegas' are splitsville, and we have to endure the tiresome bickering that now marks their meetings and witness Alejandro turning into a painfully sloppy drunk. (One scene with a horse is shamelessly cribbed from Lee Marvin's "Cat Ballou.")
 
  Adding to Alejandro's problems, Elena's old flame from school, French aristocrat Armand (Rufus Sewell), moves into the neighborhood and envelopes her in a full court press. And young Joaquin, who doesn't know his father's secret occupation, develops discipline problems and begins saying unsuitable (not to mention anachronistic) things like "Come on, you want a piece of me?"
 
  Not that Alejandro has time to concentrate on stuff like that. A sinister cabal ramrodded by the evil Jacob McGivens (Nick Chinlund as a bargain-basement combination of Billy Bob Thornton and Robert Mitchum in "The Night of the Hunter") is threatening to destroy America using bars of soap (true story). No wonder Zorro asks the Lord to "give me the courage, the strength to wear the mask a little longer."
 
  Despite its drawbacks, Zorro is acceptable in a pinch though not without its puzzling elements. What in heaven's name, for instance, is Abraham Lincoln, who was a lawyer in Springfield, Ill., in 1850, doing at the signing that welcomed California into the Union?
 
  More to the point, how did a film that features several brutal deaths and a shot of a red-hot poker getting personal with a villain's posterior manage to get a family-friendly PG rating?
 
  Thank you so much, MPAA ratings board, for your generosity of spirit. America may be puzzled, but Hollywood needs all the box office help it can get.

The Legend of Zorro , the legend of Spy Kids , what's the diff? Both swash franchises buckle their chances for success to the panache of Antonio Banderas, the Spanish star who began his movie career in the queer demimondo of Pedro Almodóvar's early films and went on to become the dashing Latin Lover of stage, screen, and Melanie Griffith's household. At this point in his delightful career, Banderas has catalogued every configuration of glower, smolder, wink, twinkle, pout, grin, and pose of olé! of possible use for a gentleman whose constituency ranges from swooning women and their disarmed male companions to giggling children who only know him as supersecret agent/papa Gregorio Cortez. And Banderas uses all his old wiles in this well-oiled, businesslike, quite clangingly violent sequel to The Mask of Zorro . He reunites with Welsh-born senorita Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena. And he follows Martin Campbell's direction for yet another go at the old black mask, flashy sombrero, and Zorronic attitude of do-gooding. There's no distinction to this sequel  except that it's designed, with more calculation than ever, to be a Saturday-afternoon seat-filler for the whole world's pants.
Legend 's cleverest notion (the cocky screenplay is by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and the piled-up story credits include original Zorro  scripters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) is to move the action ahead 10 years since last we saw Z and E (The Mask of Zorro  came out in 1998); now Alejandro de la Vega (Zorro's daytime name) and Elena are the parents of 10-year-old Joaquin (Mexican scene-stealer Adrian Alonso). It's also a time when the oppressed, viva Zorro!-shouting good people of the California territory are on the verge of voting to become the 31st state of the union, and villains appear in two forms: silky, cultured schemers like the aristocratic French vintner Armand (Rufus Sewell), and greasy-haired, scar-faced, stubble-cheeked, wooden-toothed varmints like the ruthless robber baron McGivens (Nick Chinlund).
Happy couples, though, make for dull superheroes (even Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl had to fight before they found strength in unity). And parenthood is now widely promoted in movies as a sainted form of superherodom all its own. So Zorro and Mrs. Zorro fight about child-rearing attitudes: She says he's not home enough and kicks him out of the hacienda for a spell. And time is unnecessarily wasted misunderstanding each other, when there is never any doubt, not even to the littlest viewer, that the two are meant to be together as superheroes and superparents. A couple of fancy fight sequences allow the stars, and their stunt doubles, to demonstrate how dashing they still look with swords in hand. And every shot of Zeta-Jones, with rosy lips, glistening black hair, and at-home gowns of sumptuous design, is a lit and composed thing of beauty. Still, too many scenes  particularly those with McGivens and his similarly unwashed henchmen  emphasize gross butchery over the elegance of the blade. At least Joaquin has a couple of nice moments with his slingshot, fighting against injustice in a pint-size way. The Son of Zorro ? So long as there's injustice and Banderas in this world, it's a possibility.

 The trouble with sequels is that most are obliged to outperform their forerunners in the most obvious ways. Bigger, faster and more spectacular is usually the rule. Strenuously applied to "The Legend of Zorro," the sequel to the 1998 blockbuster "The Mask of Zorro," that rule translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. Subtlety is out the window.  This fitfully entertaining mess of a movie was directed by Martin Campbell from a screenplay by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Especially in its jampacked final 45 minutes, it leaps off the precipice like the rider who jumps (Zorro himself) from a ledge onto a speeding train that disperses a crowd as it races toward a tunnel. It's all accomplished by brazen cut-away editing. Beyond the breakneck velocity  of that editing, which generates its own momentum, little suspense is sustained; speed rules, but the pace is hectic and haranguing. All the while, James Horner's stampeding pseudo-Spanish score huffs and puffs, working overtime to conjure a bullfighters' marathon.  "The Legend of Zorro" brings back Antonio Banderas, looking considerably older and in some shots haggard and flabby, as Don Alejandro de la Vega and his alter ego, Zorro, the original caped crusader, invented by Johnston McCulley in a 1919 novel. The voluptuous Catherine Zeta-Jones returns as his buxom wife, Elena, a 21st-century Hedy Lamarr, who smolders even in repose.  In this sequel-ready episode, the fun couple come apart at the beginning of the story, then reconnect just in time to save the still-expanding United States of America from falling into the hands of Confederate villains armed with a new secret weapon, nitroglycerin disguised as soap; California's statehood also hangs in the balance.  This fantasy of American history, of course, is utterly bogus in the same way that the history trotted out in a movie like "National Treasure" is fiction. But, hey! This is just a rootin'-tootin' daydream of the Old West, a heck of a yarn whose relationship to reality is at best tangential.  "The Legend of Zorro" could be dubbed the family edition of the myth, since the fun couple have spawned a son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso), who at 10 is already a fearless action hero who affects the course of American history. The unfortunate actor playing Joaquin has mouthfuls of cutesy pseudo-tough-guy dialogue that comes out sounding strained and affected. Look out, however, for Mr. Alonso, or for some other soon-to-be adolescent, to take over the franchise if it is to be picked up for further episodes, which is probably not a good idea.  Like "National Treasure,"  "The Legend of Zorro" throws in a large pinch of the occult. It imagines that in 1850, when California was just becoming the 31st state of the Union, a mysterious secret Spanish fraternity, the knights of Aragon, was scheming to rule the world through its agent, the evil Count Armand (Rufus Sewell), a school friend of Elena's. To Don Alejandro's chagrin, Elena seems willing to become Armand's new trophy wife.  Early in the story, the count celebrates the opening of a fancy winery that doubles as a front for his assembly line of explosives. Not even in the ritziest corners of Napa wine country have you seen a crowd as delirious or pyrotechnics as excessive as the fireworks bursting around Armand's mansion like explosive frosting on a wedding cake.  Unlike most his-and-hers action teams, Mr. Banderas and Ms. Zeta-Jones enjoy combustible chemistry; in a couple of backbending clinches they munch hungrily on each other's mouths, and Ms. Zeta-Jones seems genuinely dazed with desire when she comes up for air. Their chemistry notwithstanding, neither star is required to act beyond putting on a few stock grimaces. All Mr. Banderas has to do is to direct thunderous scowls in the direction of this or that villain. Ms. Zeta-Jones's principal task (particularly when wearing pearls) is to embody fleshy sultriness and to express mild indignation when vexed.  This is a hiss-the-villain, cheer-the-hero kind of movie. The slimiest of several bad guys is Armand's election-stealing, land-grabbing, cackling henchman, Jacob McGivens (Nick Chinlund), a grinning fiend with removable brown teeth and a hideous scar. His comically exaggerated caricature of evil embodies the collapse of the franchise that originally embraced and sent up clichés with a knowing sense of humor and a hint of subtlety. No longer.  "The Legend of Zorro" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has comic violence and some strong language.

Bigger, louder and considerably less charming than its predecessor, long-deferred sequel "The Legend of Zorro" gets by mostly on dazzling stunt work and the pleasure of seeing its dashing and glamorous leads back in cape and gown. Coming seven years after "The Mask of Zorro," which generated $251 million worldwide, pic also evokes unflattering memories of the bloated bigscreen "The Wild Wild West," and by introducing a kid into the swashbuckling at times risks devolving into outright silliness. Still, there are enough crowd-pleasing moments amid the frenetic action -- coupled with goodwill toward the 1998 adventure -- to carve out plenty of dollar signs internationally.
Picking up in 1850, the people of California are "poor and desperate," hoping that a charismatic action hero can help rescue them. In short, nothing much has changed.
Eager to become the 31st U.S. state through one of those special elections for which Californians are renowned, Don Alejandro de la Vega (Antonio Banderas) leaps into battle as the masked hero Zorro to thwart an attempt to steal the ballots, in the movie's first and best sequence.
Roughly a decade has passed since the original, and Alejandro's dual life is taking a toll on his marriage to Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), as well as his relationship with young son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso), who worships Zorro without knowing dad's secret identity. After Alejandro is asked to choose between his responsibilities to the people and his family, the couple abruptly splits -- a rather convoluted attempt to break them apart, then create obstacles for them to overcome to get back together.
A disconcerting three months pass before Alejandro discovers Elena is being wooed by a suave European count, Armand (Rufus Sewell). Of course, Armand is actually behind a nefarious, anachronistic plot to block statehood, as his henchmen, led by the wooden-toothed McGivens (Nick Chinlund), terrorize the countryside and steal the land.
What comes next provides all the De la Vegas the chance to strut their stuff, showing how a family that slays together, stays together.
Director Martin Campbell is back in the saddle again, but the firm hand he exhibited on the first go-round is shakier here, as the opening hour flits all over and hits some curiously flat patches. Only in the second half does the movie settle in a bit and clarify what all the shooting is about, as the pacing improves leading to an extended climactic sequence aboard a train that, perhaps inevitably, drags on a few miles too long.
A quartet of writers contributed to the script, and it certainly has the feel of work by committee. And while there are again welcome moments of humor, some are pitched so broadly it's easy to wonder if this is supposed to be a sequel to "Zorro" or "Blazing Saddles."
Fortunately, there are saving graces within the mayhem, beginning with the chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones, although, not surprisingly, it worked better when they were courting, not a squabbling married couple. Still, the years have been kind to both, and they balance the uneven mood switches from comedy to drama about as well as possible.
The same can't be said for the rest of the cast, as young Alonso wrestles with unfortunately precocious dialogue and bounces around like a pint-sized version of his pop. Similarly, Sewell plays Armand as something of a fop with a peculiar accent, just as Chinlund's sneering villain is a little too cartoonish to be completely menacing.
At its best, pic displays flourishes of kinetic energy, with Zorro leaping, springing and flipping from one peril to the next -- a kind of Nijinsky in black. (For some reason, though, that gag in "The Incredibles" regarding the dangers associated with capes kept coming to mind.)
Shot in Mexico, it's also a handsome recreation of the Old West, from the impeccable costumes to lavish haciendas. James Horner's score, by contrast, often sounds too florid, even by his standards, except for the moment when Zorro rides into the sunset, probably not for the last time. In fact, don't be surprised if the itch arises this time in less than seven years.

It's Zorro, the domesticated blade! This limp sequel to 1998's The Mask of Zorro  finds Johnston McCulley 's pulp hero so thoroughly committed to matrimonial equality he's even taken his wife's last name. Antonio Banderas 's Don Alejandro de la Vega  (formerly Murrieta ) has his hands full with embittered wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones ) and spunky son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso ) even before villainous religious zealots and French aristocrats show up to destroy 1850s California. Most of Mask 's cast and crew return, but they forgot to bring the last film's romantic aura and dry sense of humor with them; Anthony Hopkins  is deeply missed. Instead, the picture is beset by typical sequel problems like awkward slapstick and allegedly adorable kid sidekicks. Everyone seems to be coasting on goodwill. Banderas previously brought a muscular intensity to his Zorro and a palpable heat to his scenes with Zeta-Jones. Now he looks scrawny, and the romance subplot has less chemistry than a kindergarten science class.
