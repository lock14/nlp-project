Despite employing every clich� in the sports-movie handbook, Goal!: The Dream Begins
 tells a reasonably engaging story about the rags-to-riches rise of a rec-league soccer player in East L.A. to the glory of playing for England's Manchester United. Though it's not the first movie to be set within the world of professional soccer, it's the first to almost seem like a promotional tool for FIFA, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (not to mention Adidas, whose logos are featured prominently on the players' uniforms). Mexican TV hottie Becker stars as Santiago Munez, and appears in virtually every scene of the movie after the opening sequence in which the character is shown with his family as a child, carrying his precious soccer ball as he crosses the border during the middle of the night from Mexico to California. Fast-forward 10 years and we find Santiago working two jobs and playing soccer in his off-time. He has a natural athletic ability and dreams of going into something other than the lawn-maintenance business his father stubbornly insists is his son's lot in life. Then, in the first of the film's many moments of strained credulity, Santiago is spotted by the former player and talent scout Glen Foy (Dillane), who just happens to be in the right place at the right time, and gets Santi the promise of a professional tryout with just one phone call and urges him to come to England. Faster than you can holler, "Goal," illegal immigrant Santi is slipping back into Mexico to catch a flight to London, using pin money saved up by his supportive grandma. Later, when his tryout proves disastrous, Santi is awarded the first of numerous second chances. This forward-backward motion sometimes makes for an awkward narrative progression, and makes it look like this young man's success is due more to lucky breaks than hard work and innate talent. Though there are brief off-field cameos by several soccer stars � among them David Beckham, Alan Shearer, Ra�l Gonz�lez Blanco, and Zinedine Zidane � the action on the field won't be enough to sate the most soccer-crazed viewers. Tasty turns by Nivola as the spoiled sports star and Friel as the obligatory love interest help buoy the film, and the photogenic Becker also performs solidly. Goal! The Dream Begins
 was conceived by its makers as the first part of a trilogy, in which case they brought the right director on board. Cannon, whose last film was I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
, is someone who knows his way around a rehash.

Sometimes the first movie in a trilogy isn't that good, but it fails just nobly enough to still make you curious enough to maybe see the sequels. Goal! The Dream Begins   yet another Disney sports flick, this time involving an L.A. Mexican illegal named Santiago (Kuno Becker) who gets a shot across the pond kicking balls for Newcastle United  has two more installments featuring the very likable Becker on tap, and I'd like to see Santiago go on to win the World Cup or something, joined by Alessandro Nivola as Newcastle's party-boy star. (The cast, all around, is sterling.) There's only one thing they don't need to bring back for the sequels, and that's the movie's appetite for every sports cliché there ever was.

 Attempting an unfortunate blend of Newcastle grit and Hollywood uplift, "Goal! The Dream Begins" is the improbable story of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker), a young Mexican immigrant and amateur soccer star living in Los Angeles. Against the wishes of his conservative father (Tony Plana), who urges a secure future in the lawn-care business, Santiago follows the advice of a talent scout (Stephen Dillane) and heads to England for a tryout with Newcastle United.  Battling asthma attacks, hostile players and the ghastly Tyneside weather, Santiago gains a one-month trial; and before you can yell  "Foul!"  he's playing alongside the captain, Alan Shearer, and teaching his teammates the importance of clean living and hard work. One can only imagine their gratitude.  "Goal! The Dream Begins" is the kickoff to a trilogy of movies hoping to do for soccer what Kevin Costner has done for baseball. But though Mr. Becker's depressingly bland performance is countered by excellent work from both Alessandro Nivola as the team's resident playboy and the Romanian actor Marcel Iures as its paternalistic manager, the movie continually strains credulity.  As the clichés mount, Danny Cannon directs as if he's the one on trial, teasing tension out of every pass and dribble. Most irritating of all is his determination to paint British soccer as a gentleman's game,  a notion United's real fans would no doubt treat with the scorn it deserves.  "Goal! The Dream Begins" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A hint of sex, a whiff of drugs and an avalanche of corn.

A Mexican Los Angeleno hauls ass to Newcastle, U.K., to realize the American dream in "Goal!", a slickly mounted slice of can-do nonsense set in the world of British soccer. With its well-staged game footage and cameos by soccer celebs, film looks likely to score some points with sports fans when it starts release in soccer-loving territories late September via BVI. Stateside, it's much more specialized fare.
As a young boy, Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) steals across the Cal-Mex border one night with his family, almost leaving his beloved soccer ball behind when a patrol comes along. Ten years later, he's working as a cook in a Chinese restaurant and spending all his free time playing amateur soccer. His blue-collar dad, Hernan (Tony Plana), tells him to stop dreaming and get a proper job.
Santiago is spotted by part-time talent scout Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane), a former footballer with contacts in U.K. soccer. In a single phone call back to Blighty, Glen manages to persuade Erik Dornhelm (Marcel Iures), the German manager of Newcastle United, to give Santiago a tryout if he comes to the U.K.
Santiago starts saving like crazy to buy an air ticket, has his wad stolen by dad to buy a new pickup truck, but is financially saved by his devoted grandma (Miriam Colon), who tells him to follow his dream. Thirty minutes into the picture, Santiago arrives in London, takes the train north and turns up unannounced on Glen's doorstep. Well, yeah.
Thanks to Newcastle U's trainer, the gruff but kindly Mal Braithwaite (Gary Lewis), Santiago is taken on as a trainee. He braves muddy English soccer pitches and the sneers of the Geordies; is befriended by a geeky Merseysider (Kevin Knapman); and tries his luck with a local nurse, Roz (Anna Friel). Then, just before his first reserve game, a meanie steps on his asthma inhaler.
Fired after he goofs, Santiago watches his dream crumble. But hold on: Here comes Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola), a fast-living, multi-million pound signee who takes Santiago under his wing when they share a taxi one day. (No other reason is given for their sudden friendship.) Thereon, Santiago rises and rises, fighting off the temptations of fame and fortune to prove himself to his dad back home.
One can only surmise what Michael Winterbottom, pic's original director, would have made of the computer-generated material; but in fellow Brit, Hollywood-raised Danny Cannon's hands, "Goal!" moves with the well-tooled inevitability of a major studio release, utterly secure in its own universe. That universe is a strange combination of can-do Yank values and grumpy northern English practicality, and -- outside the soccer scenes -- most of the pic's entertainment comes from those two opposites grinding against each other.
Becker cuts a handsome enough Latino profile on screen but his character is vanilla; colorful Nivola fares much better, almost taking over the film's second half as his character comes into play. Friel, with a Geordie accent as wide as the River Tyne, is believable as the token local love interest, and Frances Barber contribs a colorful cameo as her blousy mom.
Iures is excellent as the wry, foreign club manager, seemingly modeled on Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, handling a bunch of troublesome players. As the loyal Glen, who guides his protege through the ups and downs of U.K. soccer, Dillane looks grateful that he has a Scottish accent to lean on for characterization.
Graeme Revell's thunderous score is suitably upbeat at moments that count, and lensing of the soccer scenes have a feel for the game's adrenalin. Cameos by well-known names include Alan Shearer, David Beckham, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho.

>Aside from a flirtation with the hot-button immigration issue, this inspirational movie about an underdog soccer player from tough East Los Angeles is pretty standard stuff. Mexican TV heartthrob Kuno Becker  stars as Santiago Munez , a rec league standout who lands a trial with the fabled Newcastle United  club of northeastern England. The appealing young man's tribulations are predictable, his triumph inevitable; while he gets respect (and  the girl, played by Anna Friel ), we get another Rocky -style dose of emotional uplift, cloaked in the usual game-day clichés. Not a bad movie, but as familiar as Alex Rodriguez 's batting average. Two sequels are already in the worksprobably aimed at the soccer-crazy international market. Brit director Danny Cannon  and Brit screenwriters Dick Clement  and Ian la Frenais  know their fútbol , but will American moviegoers pay to play?
