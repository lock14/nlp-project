There�s nothing particularly revelatory about Take the Lead
, which mines the battle-tested Hollywood chestnut of urban youth who find salvation, inspiration, and, in this case at least, more than a little perspiration from the most unlikely of sources, an adult who actually gives a damn. This time out, it�s former guitar-slinging desperado and spy dad Banderas, whose character here, the suave ballroom dance instructor Pierre Dulaine, is based on an actual person, which adds a layer of compelling grittiness to the already gritty proceedings. It�s Banderas� film all the way, of course: He�s one of those genuinely gifted, glowing actors who can nevertheless hold your attention through sheer onscreen charisma. As Dulaine, Banderas volunteers to teach the proverbial worst-of-the-worst at a decrepit public high school in New York City the finer points of working the dance floor. To no one�s surprise, his inadvertent coupling of the foxtrot and bossa nova with the phat beats of puckish teen DJ Ramos (Basco) ends up saving the day and making the local cotillion crowd look positively staid by comparison. Is there the requisite battle-dance capping the third act? Yes, indeed, but it�s difficult to fault such a warm, bouncy, and, yes, occasionally funky genre stalwart such as this for being exactly what you�d expect. I�ll give it my best shot, though. Oddly, Banderas� character suaves his way through director Friedlander�s smooth-as-silk film without so much as a single love interest, which makes you wonder what he does in his down time, or if he even has any, what with rescuing the youth of America from themselves and so forth. Banderas working solo is a stretch, to be sure, but he pulls it off with strutty aplomb, whipping his initially reluctant wards (who, to their eternal detriment, begin by dissing Gershwin) into a hybrid, multiracial band of brothers (and sisters) who reroute their hip-hop style and bad attitudes into something resembling Breakin� 3
, minus Boogaloo Shrimp. Take the Lead
 offers few if any surprises to anyone who�s seen either the aforementioned Breakin�
, Beat Street
, or, most obvious of all, Dangerous Minds
. That said, I can think of far worse ways to introduce your offspring to the glory of the ballroom, backbeat or no.


Not only are the kids who stagnate in detention at the fictional New York City public high school in "Take the Lead" the worst-behaved students. By the end of this pandering dramedy, we discover they're the most unorthodox ballroom dancers, too.
The movie partners all the cliches of the inner-city school drama with the cliches of the dance instructional, and the two keep stomping on each other's toes, while suggesting that a spoonful of hip-hop will make any medicine go down, even the stodgy tango.
Antonio Banderas stars as Pierre Dulaine, an urbane Spaniard who teaches ballroom dance to the wealthy. He arrives at principal Alfre Woodard's school to return her missing ID card and winds up volunteering to teach dance and manners to some her of more rambunctious students.
Obviously, they become lovable urban specimens of temperance and talent by the time the movie's done. Before then, the filmmakers prepare us to expect something horrific. Woodard leads Banderas into the humid bowels of her school as though she were walking Clarice Starling to meet Hannibal Lecter.
The rascals he winds up with are cuddlier, but just as randy. They're underprivileged boys and girls of various races, shapes, personality types, and sex drives. At least two of them come from dreary households -- Rock (Rob Brown from "Finding Forrester") and Larhette (Yaya DaCosta, who was season three's runner-up on "America's Next Top Model"). The duo's unhappy lives are intertwined by a tragedy. Yet forcing them into each other's arms, as "Take the Lead" does, is asking much too much.
We never find out precisely why they or anybody else is in detention. (This is not "The Breakfast Club," although I sincerely anticipate an all-urban version of that.) Presumably it's because they can't stop dancing. Whenever Dulaine comes to call on them, there's a party going on. They're allowed to have a boombox and are left unsupervised long enough for an old Christina Aguilera video to break out every afternoon.
Dulaine and the kids perform an old song and dance. Teacher wants to teach. Students won't let him. Then he reels them in by speaking their language, or rather, he lets them speak their language all over the pastime he loves. Indeed, when he tries to play an oldie for the class, someone tells him, "Yo, man, I need the remix!" So Sarah Vaughan is out in favor of mash-ups combining standards and new stuff.
Pierre Dulaine is a real-life ballroom dancer and instructor who has inspired scores of New York elementary schoolers to merengue and waltz. If I were Dulaine or any of his pupils, I'd find "Take the Lead" distressing. Not because Dianne Houston's script leans on enough ancient movie formulas to qualify as a question in the math portion of the SAT; nor because director Liz Friedlander, a veteran of so-so music videos, doesn't meet a sequence she can't turn into a montage more appropriate for a Sprite commercial. The movie would bug me because its makers don't seem to think much of ballroom dancing, or learning.
The villain here is the overworked teacher who doesn't have patience for ignorant kids. And the movie refuses to acknowledge the rigor and exuberance of ballroom dance that was taken seriously in the documentary "Mad Hot Ballroom," set among New York's first through fifth grades.
Without making the kids into attitude-filled hip-hoppers, "Take the Lead" would never have gotten made. As sweet and well-meaning as parts of the movie are, the filmmakers don't appear to trust their teenage audience to take this world seriously. Plus: There are soundtracks to sell! "Mad Hot Ballroom" demonstrated that the art had an urgency even a 9-year-old could feel. But in "Take the Lead," the big ballroom contest that the movie builds to rarely feels like the exacting athletic event that rewards practic e, sacrifice, and dedication. It seems like the prom.
.

In Take the Lead , an inner-city-delinquents-learn-how-to-tango rouser (it's Dangerous Minds  trying to be Mad Hot Ballroom ), the most entertaining sequence  I dare say the only entertaining sequence  is a dance montage that's the purest kitsch. At a public high school in Manhattan, a bunch of detention kids get taken under the wing of Antonio Banderas, who turns them on to the glories of ballroom dancing. They are, of course, hostile at first, until they begin to ''combine'' Banderas' classical approach with their own hip-hop moves. The highbrow/street connection derives from the audition sequence in Flashdance , where Jennifer Beals showed those ballet stuffed shirts how to break-dance, but the bad joke in Take the Lead  is that no one connected with the film apparently figured out how the ballroom/rap fusion should look. In the montage, we see the kids do a bit of vintage swing, then pure hip-hop, then back to swing. The only real fusion on display is the filmmakers' naked desperation to fuse demographics.
Antonio Banderas is a charming and talented man, but in Take the Lead  he lays on the old-world panache so thick  the accent, the flowery courtliness, the  romance of romance  that he comes off like Dracula's metrosexual cousin. The kids are the usual walking one-note cartoons (goofy white dreadlocked kid, humongous black shy guy, chicks so ''sassy'' they should form a band called the You Go Girls), and the movie makes them into champion dancers without ever showing you how they got good at it. ''Faith'' has rarely taken anyone so far, so blandly.

 A successful dance film need not abide by the rules of commercial moviemaking as  long as it delivers the coup de grâce. The transformation of a gawky duckling into a swan who glides you out of the theater on a cloud of vicarious grace can excuse myriad faults. When a dedicated magician transforms an entire duck pond into Swan Lake, as Antonio Banderas does in "Take the Lead," shouldn't that magic multiply exponentially?  Not necessarily.  Mr. Banderas plays Pierre Dulaine, a European ballroom dancer who not only turns a group of unruly detention students at a South Bronx high school into budding Astaires and Charisses but also gives them lessons in self-mastery, self-restraint and, as the song from "Camelot" puts it, "How to Handle a Woman." In real life, Mr. Dulaine was a prime mover behind the movement, celebrated in the hit documentary "Mad Hot Ballroom," to bring ballroom dancing to New York City public schools.  The crucial difference between this terpsichorean pop fairy tale and its dozens of screen predecessors is that "Take the Lead" goes out of its way to put hip-hop culture on an equal artistic footing with traditional pop music and dance. Athletic, beat-charged dancing, it insists, is as challenging as the tango, rumba, fox trot, merengue and waltz. It assumes the same equality between hip-hop music and the kind of pop-jazz embodied in the movie by Lena Horne singing "I Got Rhythm." (It's directed by Liz Friedlander, who comes from the world of music video.)    Because it is anti-elitist and anti-snob, "Take the Lead" should touch a chord among urban  teenagers for whom even a popular television show like "Dancing With the Stars" is old folks' stuff. Shrewdly timed, it fictionalizes the world of "Mad Hot Ballroom" and eroticizes it by raising the dancers' ages from 10 and 11 to high school age.  Mr. Banderas, with Valentino eyes and gleaming jet-black hair, suggests a mythically idealized younger version of Mr. Dulaine, and the movie's one genuinely thrilling dance sequence shows him (and a svelte blond partner) wowing his students with a tango exhibition as steamy as any music-video bump-and-grind.  But "Take the Lead," despite its nifty concept and fiery leading man, feels sloppy and rushed. Dianne Houston's screenplay crams together so many sketchy subplots that none has time to build to a satisfying payoff; the most care is devoted to the  romance of LaRhette (Yaya DaCosta) and Rock (Rob Brown), teenagers from dysfunctional families on opposite sides of a gang war. Their self-esteem develops with their ballroom skills, and their hostility melts into a trusting partnership.  Variations of the usual stock characters are all in place. In one subplot, an overweight South Bronx teenager ends up squiring a rich plain Jane to her cotillion, where the interracial duo's sudden appearance shocks  the girl's monstrously snooty mother. Alfre Woodard plays  the hard-bitten high school principal who reluctantly agrees to let Pierre teach dance in her school and is gradually won over to the cause. Clichés all.  "Take the Lead" is disappointing in other crucial respects.  By the end of the movie, the teacher should have stopped outshining his students. Even LaRhette, for whom the world disappears in one dreamy dance floor moment, never reaches full swan status. One reason she doesn't is that the movie refuses to relax and let itself float into dreamland. The lack of an "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" moment ("Dirty Dancing") or a "How Deep Is Your Love?" moment ("Saturday Night Fever") leaves a big hole in the film.  On a conceptual level, "Take the Lead" fails to realize its most ambitious goal: to show that hip-hop and traditional pop-jazz can be fused in a musical double-exposure. The overlaying of two genres ultimately makes for cluttered, confusing production numbers that add up to less than the sum of their parts.  "Take the Lead" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity and strong sexual innuendo.

Like a well-trained dancer with a vitamin deficiency, "Take the Lead" -- based on the true story of "Mad Hot Ballroom" inspiration Pierre Dulaine -- hits all its marks, but never dazzles anyone with its footwork. Nevertheless, this well-intentioned, feel-good urban tale of adversities overcome should waltz to a healthy B.O., thanks to its diverse mix of music, people, inspiring messages and the gentility imparted by star Antonio Banderas.
As Dulaine, Banderas assumes the "To Sir With Love" chair of advanced life lessons and ballroom dancing. He is magnetic, charismatic, and everything else a movie star should be. It helps that his adversaries -- who will, of course, become his allies -- are a rough-hewn crowd of after-school detainees who wouldn't know a fox trot from a '47 Buick.
Dulaine stumbles on high school hard case Rock (played with considerable sensitivity by Rob Brown) taking a five-iron to the car belonging to short-fused principal Augustine James (Alfre Woodard). Dulaine, who is a dance instructor, decides Rock and the school's other unrefined delinquents could use a healthy dose of dance. Of course, he has a hard time selling his idea to anyone else.
"Take the Lead" looks terrific and makes New York look good, too. However, the plotline proceeds like a cake recipe. Rock and LaRhette (Yaya DaCosta), whose brothers were on opposite sides of a gang war, are made dance partners despite their mutual hostility in Dulaine's after-school dance class, but their resistance to each other soon melts away. Meanwhile, the educational bureaucracy mounts its own resistance to Dulaine's techniques, despite all he does for the kids.
Additionally, family tragedies impose themselves on the narrative, and the poor kids are dissed by Dulaine's regular students, all children of obscene privilege.
And, the movie culminates in a big citywide dance competition.
There seems to be no sports-movie cliche, or a teen-drama conceit, or ugly-duckling moral that scenarist Dianne Houston and director Liz Friedlander have failed to resurrect for "Take the Lead"; audiences could quite easily narrate the story themselves as it unfolds.
But for all the cliches, the young performers in the film come across as quite genuine and even charming, once their obnoxious, hardshell finish is penetrated by Dulaine and his European savoir-faire. Even in as banal a movie as "Take the Lead," Banderas seems fresh -- perhaps partially because of the fact he looks so good in a suit.

Antonio Banderas  plays Pierre Dulaine , founder of the ballroom dancing program for New York City schools made famous by the documentary Mad Hot Ballroom . But screenwriter Dianne Houston  and director Liz Friedlander  have made a very canny change from the true story, substituting the elementary school kids with high schoolers. Watching presexual kids engaged in ballroom dancing felt at best like an odd dress-up game and at worst like a creepy mimicry of adult courtship by participants too young to understand its significance. With good-looking teens, it's a whole new ballroom. The downside is that we never learn quite what motivates Dulaine to just show up at the high school one day and volunteer to teach dance. It's no surprise to anyone who's seen his Robert Rodriguez  films that Banderas works well with kids. But it may surprise those who saw Evita  that he can make a music-and-dance movie that doesn't suck.
