         The death of Robert F. Kennedy in June 1968 marked the end of a certain type of idealism in American politics. In trying to translate the power of what Kennedy meant to so many people into a compelling film, writer-director Emilio Estevez has exceeded his reach with the historical drama "Bobby." Set on the day leading up to the assassination of RFK at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, the film weaves together the stories of 22 fictionalized characters tangentially linked to that event with archival footage of the late senator as he campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination. In the process, Estevez draws some rather obvious parallels between the Vietnam era and present-day social and political conflicts.
 
  It's an ambitious film drenched in sincerity and oozing with nostalgia that, despite the energy provided by its title icon via archival footage, falls flat dramatically in nearly every other way. It aspires for the Altmanesque interplay of "Nashville" or "Short Cuts" but instead feels like one of those '70s disaster epics such as "Earthquake" or "The Towering Inferno," in which a star-studded cast endures melodramatic story lines as the audience awaits the inevitable momentous event and tries to guess who will be around at the finish.
 


         






    Estevez lined up Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Helen Hunt and nominees William H. Macy and Sharon Stone, as well as his father, Martin Sheen, ex-girlfriend Demi Moore, her husband Ashton Kutcher and a slew of hot young actors such as Elijah Wood, Lindsay Lohan and Shia LaBeouf for this upstairs/downstairs mélange of intersecting lives. The tales of the hotel staff are more diverting than those of the guests, primarily because many scenes ominously take place in the Ambassador's kitchen, where Kennedy was gunned down, and their circumstances speak more directly to the issues the candidate was addressing.
 
  It's easy to become swept up in the palpable enthusiasm Estevez shows toward his subject, but the pedestrian and overly expositional dialogue of the film's characters proves to be as stifling as the excerpts from Kennedy's speeches are stirring. Even with dynamic performers such as Laurence Fishburne, as a chef, and Freddy Rodriguez as a busboy, the exchanges have the ring of platitudes rather than drama. Scenes of almost pure exposition and bald declarations of themes strip the film of any possibility of subtext.
 
  The film opens with a crawl explaining its context accompanied by familiar footage of RFK, Martin Luther King Jr., César Chávez and the Vietnam War from which we are to take that it was a time not terribly different from our own. An unpopular war rages while ideological, class and race divisions threaten to tear the country apart. Throughout the film, Estevez repeatedly points out these parallels — as when a man explains the perils of a new method of voting and warns of hanging chads — but never moves beyond that observation.
 
  Whereas Oliver Stone has had a career to examine the many gripping aspects and conflicts of the volatile 1960s, Estevez attempts to do it in less than two hours. The result is a Cliffs Notes movie skimming the decade's greatest hits of pop culture references and isms. When characters banally discuss movies such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Graduate," it feels as though they're merely name-dropping.
 
  The weakest of the micro-dramas — one featuring Sheen and Hunt as bored (and boring) Easterners suffering from psy-chological malaise; he's depressed, she's lost her identity in materialism — seems to exist strictly to mark the rise of pop psychology. Likewise, an overlong, indulgent sequence featuring naive campaign workers (LaBeouf, Brian Geraghty) drop-ping acid with the hotel's resident drug dealer (Kutcher) achieves little beyond reminding us that the '60s was the Age of Aquarius and that people did a lot of drugs, while also allowing the director to depict the requisite subjective acid trip.
 
  Estevez, who also plays alcoholic lounge singer Moore's dutiful husband, acquits himself far better as a director than as a writer. Working in episodic television in recent years, he has moved beyond early efforts behind the camera such as "Wisdom" and "Men at Work," and he does a good job of moving between stories and establishing milieu. Aside from the LSD interlude and the trite use of Simon and Garfunkel over a key sequence, his directing choices such as using actual footage of Kennedy rather than an actor are sound and make the film more watchable than it might have been.
 
  As a screenwriter, however, Estevez seems hamstrung by too much reverence for both the '60s and Kennedy. The approach limits him to dealing in archetypes rather than flesh-and-blood characters who would have elevated the drama to something more memorable. We've seen all these characters before, and other than Timmons, Christian Slater's racist kitchen supervisor, and Miguel, a kitchen worker played by Jacob Vargas, they threaten to recede into the hotel's wallpaper.
 
  Even those two get the life squeezed out of them in one of the movie's many tidy endings that precede the assassination sequence. The script's earnestness prevents the film from delivering a true perspective on the time the way Warren Beatty and Robert Towne did with the 1975 satire "Shampoo," set a few months after "Bobby" at the time of the Nixon-Humphrey presidential election.
 
  Finally, the film functions as something of an elegy to the Ambassador and the Cocoanut Grove, the late great Wilshire Boulevard hotel and nightclub which were demolished this year, a further blight on Los Angeles' reputation for failing to preserve its landmarks. Unfortunately, the fictionalized dramas that serve as a "Grand Hotel"-like homage to the place pale in comparison with the vitality of Kennedy. Simply seeing and hearing these words reminds us that even though the times have much in common, we're far removed from an age when politicians embraced issues and positions rather than middle-of-the- road centrism.

Bobby , a schoolboy-earnest exercise in nostalgia and tragedy (nostalgedy?), unfolds entirely at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, just prior to the night that Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. Written and directed by Emilio Estevez, it's a period piece in which the ''authentic'' details are mostly a matter of makeup and wardrobe and heavily signposted topical allusions. Look, there's Lindsay Lohan in raccoon-eyed '60s mascara! There's Ashton Kutcher, as a drug dealer who drops acid with two campaign workers, in a hippie wig, and here are references to Don Drysdale, the Communist menace, and The Graduate   though I seriously doubt that anyone discussing Anne Bancroft's possible nudity in that movie would have been familiar with the term ''body double'' in 1968.
The true skin-deepness of Bobby , however, is its rhythm. The conversation is crisp and fast and almost technologically aware, a mode that plays all too anachronistically contemporary. Estevez stages a kind of TV-movie Grand Hotel , with snippets of adultery and other dirty laundry (a fading cabaret singer, nicely played by Demi Moore (pictured, with Estevez), is a lush). In the hotel kitchen, there's some colorful verbal jousting between the black and Latino workers, but Estevez, trying to create a mood of cross-wired national anxiety, never really makes the personal political. He just piggybacks soap opera banality onto our awareness of what RFK's murder meant for this country  a death rattle of our hope, our optimism. Bobby  coasts along on a dread, and sorrow, it doesn't earn.

 With “Bobby,” Emilio Estevez, writer and director (as well as one of a huge ensemble of actors), sets himself a large and honorable task. It is important to appreciate this in spite of his movie’s evident shortcomings.  Intentions do count for something, and Mr. Estevez’s seem to me entirely admirable. He tries, by means of the familiar technique of weaving together story lines connected only by coincidences of time and place, to produce a feeling of collective life. Beyond that, he tries to link the intimate stories of nearly two dozen characters to a large and consequential public event — the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy — and to capture the heady combination of anxiety, anger, hope and idealism that supposedly characterized the United States in 1968.  All of the action in “Bobby” takes place at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, the day Kennedy, a late entry into the presidential race, won California’s Democratic primary. (It was also the day the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale took the mound to attempt his sixth consecutive shutout, an event that competes with the primary election for the attention of some of the film’s characters.) After midnight, as Kennedy made his way from a ballroom through the hotel’s kitchen, he was fatally shot, a calamity that casts its shadow backward over the more mundane doings of the day. In every scene of Mr. Estevez’s film, portent hangs heavy in the air.  The candidate himself is a tangential figure, present mainly through archival news clips and audio recordings, in which he talks, with a quiet eloquence that sounds almost outlandish to present-day ears, about the problems of poverty, prejudice, pollution and war. (The moments before the shooting are filmed, disconcertingly, from his point of view.) His assassin also barely figures in the story. Instead “Bobby” uses both Kennedy’s candidacy and his murder as a kind of prism, through which the aspirations and confusions of a cross section of Americans might be filtered.    Not all their concerns are political. Yes, the Mexican-American kitchen workers (Freddy Rodriguez and Jacob Vargas) argue about social justice with the wise black cook (Laurence Fishburne) and trade scowls with their bigoted boss (Christian Slater). And a young woman (Lindsay Lohan) prepares to marry a young man (Elijah Wood) to keep him out of Vietnam, even though she doesn’t know him very well. But at least as much attention is paid to the vague discontent experienced by a middle-aged couple (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt), to the mutterings of the hotel’s retired doorman (Anthony Hopkins), and to the adventures of a pair of young campaign workers (Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf), who skip out on their canvassing duties to drop acid for the first time. (They purchased the drug from the Ambassador’s in-house dealer, played by Ashton Kutcher.)  There’s much more. There’s Demi Moore, playing a boozy chantoozy with the kind of manic gusto you expect from drag performers. (She behaves like a cast member in the Wigstock road-show production of “A Woman Under the Influence: The Musical.”) Mr. Estevez self-effacingly takes the role of her husband, who minds the lap dog and wears an ascot, sure signs of emasculation. Meanwhile the hotel manager (William H. Macy), married to one of the hairdressers (Sharon Stone), carries on an affair with a young switchboard operator (Heather Graham). A black Kennedy staff member (Nick Cannon) embodies the aspirations of his race.  And so on. As if to make sure that we understand this movie’s pedigree, Mr. Estevez throws in a clumsy reference to “Grand Hotel.” He also nods vigorously in the direction of Robert Altman, stitching his disparate narrative threads together with floating cameras, long, twisty tracking shots and snappy cuts. These techniques give “Bobby” a degree of fluidity and momentum, but the multiple story lines coalesce in a manner more reminiscent of “The Towering Inferno” — or an episode of “Fantasy Island” — than “Nashville.” Each story rises toward an epiphany that is quickly overwhelmed by the gunshots in the kitchen.  The actors seem more like “very special guest stars” than like real, 1968-vintage Americans, and their period-appropriate get-ups — the narrow lapels and skinny ties, the sheath dresses and piled-up hairdos — are more distracting than convincing. (The freshest performances belong to Ms. Lohan, Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Slater.) Some of the stories feel too obviously melodramatic, while others are vague to the point of inscrutability. In the Vietnam-  and drug-related plots, the point is hammered home too hard — it’s the ’60s, folks! — while other narratives wind toward no discernible point at all.  Nonetheless the ambition behind “Bobby” is large and serious. Along with many other Americans who grew up in the wake of the 1960s — for whom figures like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were always more myth than flesh and blood — Mr. Estevez, who was 6 years old when Kennedy was shot, seems preoccupied with understanding what it was like to live through some of that decade’s galvanizing events.  The pulse of history is most audible not in the fictional portions of the movie, but in the moments, especially at the end, when the documentary record takes over. The sound of Kennedy’s voice, even as it takes you out of the movie, throws you into a past that seems both terribly remote and uncannily alive. When you hear his patient, meditative speeches, from which every note of demagoguery or pandering has been purged, you glimpse the film Mr. Estevez set out to make — the one you may wish you were watching.  “Bobby” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of drug use, sex and violence.
For progressives lifted, however temporarily, by the swell of a turning tide, Bobby  can be seen clearly for what it isan Airport  movie with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy  as the central calamity and an all-star cast deployed like multiple George Kennedys . Juggling some 22 main characters on June 4, 1968, in the hours leading up to RFK's speech at the Ambassador Hotel and its tragic after-math, ambitious actor-writer-director Emilio Estevez  means to eulogize the hopes of a nation, showing the night's impact on a group of hotel guests and staff cross-sectioned by age, race, and class. But his movie ends up buried under its stifling good intentions and dire execution.
It falls to gentlemanly doorman Anthony Hopkins  to acknowledge Bobb y 's model, the prototypical subplot-a-palooza Grand Hotel a stroke that screenwriter Estevez handles with characteristic subtlety. "Grand hotel," the doorman says, adding helpfully: "It's a line from the old Greta Garbo  movie, Grand Hotel ."
As Estevez practically builds the Ambassador a new wing to accommodate his subplotsfinding vacancies for a self-sacrificing war bride (Lindsay Lohan !), a boozy nightclub singer (Demi Moore !), and even his dad, Martin Sheen his attempt to hit every generational touchstone turns the movie into a docent's tour of '60s discord. If someone mentions a movie, it will be The Graduate ; if someone takes LSD, the soundtrack will blare Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man . If someone mentions art, it will be to disparage the painting they bought of a soup can, yuk yuk.
All this retrophilia is turned into camp by a veritable telethon of celebrity walk-ons. Actors barge in like nosy neighbors borrowing cups of sugar. At the doorwho could that soldier be? Why, hello, Elijah Wood !
Estevez's on-the-nose direction boldfaces contemporary parallels that might have been alarming and illuminating, if they hadn't been superimposed so blatantly on the material. Take the voter registration coordinator who explains the ballots, carefully pointing out "what the folks down at IBM  like to call 'chads.' " Or the spelled-out references to an unpopular current war. It may be, given Hollywood 's timidity about anything political, that the only way Estevez could get a movie made about the state of the union in 2006 was to set it in 1968. But he flattens his noble intent with a sledgehammer.
As awful as Bobby  is, there's never a moment its maker doesn't brave the derision of cynics, and in a few scenesfor example, the well-played exchanges between Joshua Jackson 's comradely campaign coordinator and Nick Cannon 's true-believer volunteerit evokes the hope that many Americans feel briefly rekindled and even more quickly doused every four years. As for the shooting, Estevez treats it as the snuffing of an entire alternate futurean America untangled from Vietnam , untainted by Watergate, and untroubled by racial friction.
In interviews Estevez has mentioned meeting Kennedy as a toddler. The movie regards the candidate from the same mythic distanceas the back of a head, or a heroic blur. But doing so robs the actual Robert F. Kennedy of his complexity. Bobby 's closing montage uses a recording of an eloquent speech Kennedy made after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. a man whom Kennedy, not five years earlier, had authorized the FBI  to wiretap while serving as his brother's pit bull attorney general. We'll never find out whether Bobby Kennedy would have become another Lincoln. Nor will he disappoint us with a long, sad decline into political careerism. Kennedy cited Aeschylus to eulogize King, but Bobby 's worshipful what-iffing calls to mind nothing so much as A.E. Housman : "Now you will not swell the rout/Of lads that wore their honours out/Runners whom renown outran/And the name died before the man."
