Frank Castle is the Punisher, Marvel Comics' one-man vengeance machine, who appears here in his third screen iteration and is played by Stevenson (HBO's Rome
), the third film actor to personify the comic-book hero. The character was last seen in 2004, played by Thomas Jane in a fairly campy version of Castle's origin story. An ex-Marine, Castle becomes a homicidal maniac after mobsters murder his wife and daughter, and he slaughters the mobsters in return. Frank Castle was also played by Dolph Lundgren in a 1989 direct-to-video release, which is often overlooked by commentators. Despite being human, Castle is virtually indestructible: Sure, he can dish out the violence, but he can also withstand anything that comes at him � without even mussing a single strand of his perfectly slicked-back hair. The blood and gore quotients of Punisher: War Zone
 are extremely high and are sure to sop the appetites of the series' fans and virtual bloodlusters � perhaps a trade-off for the muting of this most recent Punisher's signature garb and biting comebacks. Director Alexander handles the action with relentless fervor and occasional wit. (Alexander, a former karate champion, won acclaim for her 2005 soccer movie, Hooligans
, which premiered at South by Southwest, where it received Jury and Audience awards for Best Narrative Feature.) An image of the Punisher shooting double-fisted while twirling upside down from a chandelier at a mob dinner party is priceless, as is the impaling of a bad guy's noggin on an iron fence, which is then used as a stepping-stone to cross the tall metal barrier. Frank Castle is a cartoon version of Death Wish
's Paul Kersey (played by Charles Bronson), a remorseless vigilante whose only raison d'�tre is vengeance, even once the character's own personal beefs are settled. War Zone
 has him battling it out with the series' recurring character, Jigsaw (a bold move on distributor Lionsgate's part, since its cash-cow franchise Saw
 also features a baddie by that moniker). West brings a lot of verve to Jigsaw, whose face was horribly sliced and diced by a glass-recycling machine, but perhaps not as much as his mayhem-mad brother, Loony Bin Jim (Hutchison). The film is shot in striking neon pastels and filtered light, which is maybe meant to indicate some of the human conflict Stevenson's Punisher experiences when he mistakenly kills an undercover fed who's been embedded with the mob. Castle is dismayed by his error, and that guilt drives this film's plot. But I won't dwell on that here. Like the Punisher says to one of his victims: "Let me put you out of my misery."


If most December movie releases are epic-length and Oscar-ambitious, then "Punisher: War Zone" has to be considered Hobbesian counterprogramming: It's nasty, brutish, and short. This third movie iteration of the Marvel comic book barges into the holiday season like a skinhead crashing the office Christmas party, breaking furniture and puking in the punch. You'll either be horrified or grateful for the diversion.
Actually, "War Zone" bears little relation to the two earlier "Punisher" films, the 1989 version starring Dolph Lundgren or the 2004 reboot featuring Thomas Jane. Now it's the glowering, towering British actor Ray Stevenson ("King Arthur," TV's "Rome") who plays Frank Castle, the Special Forces commando turned anti-Mafia vigilante.
Frank doesn't wear a mask - he doesn't care who recognizes him - but instead sports a white-skulled black T-shirt and enough armaments to start a minor border incident. The plot of "War Zone" finds the hero accidentally murdering an undercover FBI agent and reeling with guilt - Stevenson expresses this by tensing a brow muscle - while vowing to kill New York mobster Billy the Beaut (Dominic West). The latter has had a little incident with a bottle-recycling machine; looking at his gruesomely stitched-up face in the mirror, he dubs himself Jigsaw.
For a movie primarily concerned with exploding heads, "War Zone" is surprisingly busy with characters: It's almost a B-grade Guy Ritchie knockoff. There's a smart Fed (Colin Salmon) and a dumb cop (Dash Mihok), a psycho secondary bad guy (Doug Hutchison) and an Irish Rasta who does parkour (Keram Malicki-Sanchez), a Romanian (David Vadim) trading in bio-warfare, and a computer nerd who looks suspiciously like Newman on "Seinfeld" (Wayne Knight). The Punisher even has time to glumly romance the widow (Julie Benz) of the man he killed while cheering up her little daughter (Stephanie Janusauskas) with a tour of New York's subway tunnels.
But these movies exist for the mayhem, not the characters, and "Punisher: War Zone" is enthusiastically violent even for its genre. If most of the budget has gone to ordnance and blood squibs, director Lexi Alexander films the sprays of gore with an artisan's eye, and the results make effective if morally indefensible movie red meat.
Incidentally, the filmmaker's own story is pretty interesting: A German-born stuntwoman and kickboxing champion, Alexander is making her feature debut here after a handful of short films, one of which (2003's "Johnny Flynton") was Oscar-nominated. Maybe someone should make a movie about her.


In this oddly Brit-heavy third attempt to   create another Marvel film franchise, Ray Stevenson (Rome ) takes over as the vengeful Punisher, following Dolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane. Alas, Stevenson doesn't have much to do except look gloomy after accidentally killing an FBI agent  and then deliberately kills about 50 more people. (His character could be called the Not-Much-of-a-Learning-Curveinator.) Meanwhile, Dominic West (The Wire ) plays a facially mutilated Mob boss as if he's in a broad SNL  sketch. On the plus side, Punisher: War Zone  has one of the all-time great   B-movie last lines: ''Oh, God, now I've got brains splattered all over me!''
Watch our interview   with star Ray Stevenson

 “Who punishes you?” someone asks Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson), better known as the Punisher, in the punishing new entertainment called “Punisher: War Zone.”  It’s a fair enough question, but the one I had as I sat through 107 bloody, grinding minutes was a little different: What did I ever do to deserve this?  Dumb question, I know. It’s silly to take the brutality of “Punisher: War Zone,” which is based on a comic book with a devoted following, seriously or personally. Guys get their heads blown off, or severed, or pierced with chair legs, or pulverized with fists, because that’s what they have coming and that’s what the fan base will pay money to see. But does it have to be so witless, so stupid, so openly contemptuous of the very audience it’s supposed to be pandering to?  More dumb questions! I understand that the picture, directed with grisly intensity by Lexi Alexander, is a big, bloody cartoon. At its center is a grim, humorless avenger whose nemesis is a onetime mobster named Jigsaw (Dominic West), so called because his face was disfigured in a recycling accident. Jigsaw has a crazy brother named Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) — but, really, why bother? You will see this movie or not, and it will make about as much sense to you either way. There is, however, one line that is, if not quite clever, at least relevant for the purposes of concluding this review. As the Punisher says to a bad guy he’s about to waste, “I guess I’ll put you out of my misery.”  “Punisher: War Zone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing and extremely graphic killing.

Frank Castle, aka the Punisher, was last seen in 2004 unleashing his inner homicidal maniac on the mobsters who killed his wife and children. In the latest installment, "Punisher: War Zone," Frank is played by Ray Stevenson, taking over for the original's Thomas Jane, but he remains divinely ticked off: "Sometime, I'd like to get my hands on God," he mutters, still unafraid to take matters to the top. Gore-drenched actioner is guaranteed to draw fans of wretched excess like moths to a nuclear holocaust.
Based on the Marvel Comics hero, the Punisher is an ex-Marine who's virtually indestructible, until the fight choreography says he's not. And then anyone can take a whack at the big guy, even the psychopathic Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison), whose gangster brother, Billy Russoti (Dominic West), is turned into Jigsaw, a kind of faux Joker with a face stitched like a baseball (all thanks to the Punisher, seen early on feeding Billy through a glass-recycling machine). Billy's line delivery sounds like 'The Sopranos' " Steven Van Zandt doing an impersonation of Robert Davi doing an impersonation of comedian Pat Cooper. Together, these brothers do less for the image of Italian-Americans than Chef Boyardee, a can of which seems to be exploding every three minutes.
Along with torrents of gore, "Punisher: War Zone" (scripted by Nick Santora, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, all new to the franchise) has moments that are deliriously funny, because the violence is so awful and so casual: Frank is just as apt to blow someone's face off his neck as he is to grumble darkly. His weapons collection is vast, well-oiled and large in caliber; his list of worthy corpses unending. Most of the time, helmer Lexi Alexander ("Green Street Hooligans"), replacing the first pic's Jonathan Hensleigh, plays to "Punisher's" fanboy base, but often enough, she lets slip that she's in on the gag. A body is impaled on a spiked fence. OK, good. Then Frank uses the guy's face as a step ladder. Even better.
Stevenson ("Rome') plays Frank with appropriate solemnity, and just an inkling of introspection; too much, of course, and the whole executioner ethos comes tumbling down, which it does when Frank inadvertently kills an undercover FBI agent. This sets up the story's faux-humanist slant, as Frank tries to protect the agent's widow, Angela (Julie Benz), and daughter, Grace (Stephanie Janusauskas), from Jigsaw and Co. (When Grace puts her hand in Frank's and says "Don't go," laughter is guaranteed.)
Among the other less-than-believable aspects of Frank's life is his spacious underground lair -- which, had this really been shot in New York instead of Vancouver and Montreal, would have been long ago rooted out by real estate developers and turned into condos. Also, that no one can find him, except when someone tries -- like federal agent Paul Budiansky (Colin Salmon), who at one point simply walks up to Frank and places him under arrest.
Not that pic really needs it, but light comic relief is provided by NYPD behavioral psychologist Martin Soap (Dash Mihok), who plays Jimmy Olsen to the Punisher's Superman, and the Punisher's arms dealer (Wayne Knight, "Seinfeld").
Production values are adequate, although the establishing shots of Manhattan, from which Punisher then enters some Canadian subway system, can be disconcerting. So is the pic's glossy, reflective, flaring look, which may just be out to distract auds from the horrible goings-on.


It really shouldn't have been so hard to make a decent Punisher  movie; after all, the character is basically just Death Wish's Paul Kersey  on steroids, in spandex. How come it took Hollywood  so long to figure that out? Following a direct-to-video '80s version starring Dolph Lundgren , and an unfortunately campy 2004 reboot with Thomas Jane , Lionsgate has gotten back to basics with Punisher: War Zone . Rome  's Ray Stevenson  plays the skull-clad Frank Castle  like a cross between Steven Seagal  and Jason Voorhees . Early on, he fixes his own broken nose by jamming a pencil up his nostril; nobody else in the movie gets off quite so easily, as blood, brains, intestines, and chunks of flayed skin fly. (It's not technically a horror movie, but nobody told the effects guys that.) The plot, such as it is, involves Castle second-guessing his life as a vigilante after accidentally killing an undercover fed, while fighting off a mobster (Dominic West ) who has fallen into a giant glass-crusher and been recycled as a lethal Leatherface lookalike called Jigsaw. But the script isn't what matters here: This is a slasher movie with guns, and, uh, huh-huh, that's pretty cool.
