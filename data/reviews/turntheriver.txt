 You can almost smell the clammy atmosphere inside the New York pool hall to which Kailey Sullivan (Famke Janssen), a tough cookie from upstate, periodically repairs to regain her bearings in “Turn the River.” Kailey, who has served time in prison, is a card shark and pool hustler who lives by her wits and exists in a state of such high anxiety that stress makes her retch.  The hall is managed by her gruff, kindly mentor, Quinette (Rip Torn), who lets her sleep on a pool table and scares up potentially profitable games for her. It is also a drop-off point for letters Kailey exchanges with her 11-year-old son, Gulley (Jaymie Dornan), whom she gave up at birth after the collapse of a disastrous early marriage. Gulley attends a  Roman Catholic boys’ school in the city, and mother and son arrange secret, emotionally fraught meetings in Central Park.  The first feature film written and directed by Chris Eigeman, “Turn the River” is not what you might expect from this actor best known for his roles in “Gilmore Girls” and in Whit Stillman’s elegiac examinations of ’80s blueblood manners on the Upper East Side. Nor does it have any relationship, stylistic or otherwise, to the “X-Men” movies, in which Ms. Janssen plays Jean Grey.  Kailey is a less extreme example of the kind of role embraced by beautiful women (like Charlize Theron as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in “Monster”) to break out of the glamour-girl straitjacket and prove they can act. Although Kailey is still beautiful, she is weather-beaten and without apparent vanity. Nowhere in the movie does she use feminine wiles to coax favors from men, although one male friend who hangs around the pool hall, Markus (Terry Kinney), is obviously smitten with her. Such is her tainted aura that when she wins $100 from an arrogant college boy in a pool match, he flies into a fury and socks her in the face.  At a rendezvous with Gulley, the boy shows up with a broken arm. His evasive answers lead Kailey to suspect that his father, David (Matt Ross), a successful real estate agent she hasn’t seen in more than a decade, has been physically abusive. The moment David appears in the film, he emits the same furtive explosiveness as Alby Grant, Mr. Ross’s character in the HBO series “Big Love.” His new wife, Ellen (Marin Hinkle), walks on eggshells. The movie’s most ominous scenes show this tense, enraged man itching for a fight with his son at the dinner table while interrogating him about his school day.  The source of David’s rage is immediately clear when his domineering, devoutly churchgoing mother, Abby (Lois Smith), pays a visit and treats him like a disobedient child. The movie’s portrait of a straitlaced Catholic family passing down heavy psychological baggage rings dreadfully true.  When Kailey conceives a plan to pluck Gulley out of school and flee with him across the Canadian border, he eagerly agrees to it. But the price of false documentation, according to Markus, who can secure it, is $50,000. The only way she can come up with the cash is by winning some high-stakes pool matches, which Quinette agrees to help her find. In a move that eventually throws the movie off its track and points it toward shrill melodrama, Kailey also demands a gun.  Until it transforms into an improbable thriller, “Turn the River” is a finely observed portrait of a desperate working-class woman who refuses to play by ordinary rules. It programmatically plays down the suspense during the ultimate contest, which pits Kailey against Duncan (John Juback), a canny, seasoned pool hustler adept at mind games.  At the point it shifts gear, however, “Turn the River” becomes a jerky, desultory chase movie in which Kailey’s solidity crumbles,  and she seems increasingly unhinged; the last third of the movie is almost a different, and much weaker, film.

Chris Eigeman's highly accomplished writing-directing debut, "Turn the River," is a meller/thriller about a poker-playing pool hustler trying to score enough money to run away with the son she was forced to abandon at birth. Down-and-dirty character study seems a stretch for Eigeman, who, as an actor, practically patented rich and smug, and a curious starring-role choice for elegant Famke Janssen. But atmospheric pic positively vibrates with authenticity, and Janssen's intense, febrile perf earned a special jury prize at the Hamptons fest, where pic also garnered screenwriting laurels. Taut femme "sports noir"
 could build an enthusiastic indie following.
Hanging out with the guys in a small town in upstate New York, Kailey (Janssen) ekes out a living playing poker, periodically driving into Gotham to hustle pool games and check up on her gruffly protective mentor, Quinn (a wonderfully world-weary Rip Torn), who runs a hardcore hall.
Quinn also serves as a mail drop for Kailey's secret correspondence with 11-year-old son Gulley (Jaymie Dornan), their exchanged letters unbeknownst to Kailey's rich, mama's-boy former husband (Matt Ross). Kailey is determined to wrest her son from the toxic clutches of her alcoholic ex-hubby and his domineering mother (Lois Smith, in fine, steely form). Kailey's quest to raise $50,000 for fake passports that will allow them to head to Canada provides the impetus for the bulk of the film.
In casting a woman in a traditionally male role, Eigeman subtly shifts both genre and gender. His heroine adopts the iconography of the hustler movie, but feminizes it: The image of a woman camping out on a pool table reads less as rugged than vulnerable. When Kailey gets beaten up, it's not for being a hustler but for being a woman, as male rage explodes on the barest pretext.
On the domestic sudser side, even at her most radiantly maternal, Kailey's mannerisms have a somewhat masculine directness as she instantly drops to her knees to welcome her enthusiastically running son, or brusquely engages him in escape mode. Janssen's Kailey exudes a survivalist energy and wrong-side-of-the-tracks physicality quite distinct from the fetishized superheroine the actress embodies in the "X-Men" movies.
Janssen effortlessly carries "Turn the River," interacting with barmaids and waitresses and scoping out poker bluffs and pool marks. But unlike alpha-male hustler films (like "The Color of Money"), there is little virtuoso shot-making on display. Instead, Kailey relies on Quinn to gauge potential opponents based on her talent. Sometimes strung-out, brittle and rash, and sometimes vibrant, confident and in control, her game mirrors her ability to cope with an environment that reveals itself as alternately feral and protective.
Tech credits are aces. Hernan Michael Otano's lensing ups the contrast between Kailey's naturally nocturnal environment and a daylight so unforgiving it actually makes her vomit from sheer stress.

Kailey (Famke Janssen ) is getting on 40, living in an upstate limbo, driving to NYC for clandestine meetings with the 12-year-old that son her ex-stepmom tries to keep from her. Shes undesirable because she lives off poker and trolling money games at Rip Torn s underlit, underpopulated pool hall (its drabness accentuated by a sludgy 16mm transfer). When a woman fills a traditionally male role, youre bound to find strange frictionsscenes around the pool table are fraught as each pocketed ball impacts the egos involved, the tactile threat of imperiled manhood a constant undertone. While buying the freshly exfoliated Janssen as a beer-battered hard case requires suspended disbelief, her low-key treatment beats the ostentatious frowsing-down thats usually counterfeited for range when a beautiful woman plays against type. Writer-director by Chris Eigeman , one of Americas finest comic actors (best showcased in Whit Stillman s films), seems aware of the risk that his film runs of drifting into the untenable, and so he painstakingly anchors it with double knots of character development, weaving in a network of supporting parts and a real sense of how people support or subvert one another in their screwed-up relationships. Turn the River  cant weather the ante-upping into pathos when Kailey desperately reasserts her privilege of motherhoodbut the sense of storytelling intelligence is undeniable.
