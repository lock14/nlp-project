All goats aside, this is one odd duck. A title card reads, �More of this is true than you would believe,� but it�s impossible to tell what�s factual in this fictionalized take on Jon Ronson�s book about Army experiments in the paranormal because it all sounds so deeply ludicrous. Never uninteresting � but never entirely successful, either � The Men Who Stare at Goats
 takes a sideways approach toward the 300-pound gorilla in the room. Reeling from his wife�s infidelity, journalist Bob Wilton (McGregor) leaves his podunk paper in Ann Arbor, Mich., seeking the wilder climes of Iraq, circa the second invasion. Cooling his heels in Kuwait, Wilton more or less bumps into the story of a lifetime, packaged neatly in the mustachioed frame of Clooney�s Lyn Cassady, psychic spy. That�s just one name for the particular breed of soldier that came out of the military�s mid-Eighties� �New Earth Army,� the brainchild of Bill Django (Bridges), a Vietnam veteran who went out on a fact-finding mission for alternative fighting methods and came back to base six years later a long-haired peacenik proponent of yoga, juice fasts, and the possibilities of invisibility and telepathy for his newly formed regiment of �Jedi warriors.� (The goats, by the way, are used for practice: A good psychic spy should be able to fell one with a concentrated glare.) Lyn relates all this to Bob as they travel into Iraq together, and the structure is not always an elegant one: Transitions from the training camp at Fort Bragg to present-day desert play abruptly and sometimes too thematically on the nose. These flashbacks are narrated by Bob (�Lyn told me ��) without the addition of any other sources to confirm or deny, which has the effect of legitimizing Lyn�s story for the viewer (at least within the confines of the film), when it�s clear Heslov and his screenwriter Peter Straughan intended there to be some doubt for dramatic purposes. This is Heslov�s first time directing, after co-writing and producing with Clooney Good Night, and Good Luck.
, and there are too many tiny blunders to call his debut a triumph. He ruins an inspired climax with a generic, drum-heavy music miscue, and even the last-reel pick-me-up of Boston�s �More Than a Feeling� can�t help the film find the beat (Heslov rushes through the final sequence as if he simply can�t wait to roll credits). Still, there is Clooney�s deceptively layered performance, some startling bits of laugh-out-loud absurdity, and the not-at-all-negligible pleasure to be had in a cockeyed point of view.

‘The Men Who Stare at Goats’’ prompts an obvious question: Will there in fact be any goats stared at in this movie? And, if so, by whom and to what end? The answers  - yes; George Clooney; to kill them by remote heart attack as part of a top-secret military initiative  - are deliciously absurd even if you don’t know they’re based at least partly in historical truth.
You can’t make this stuff up, but you can botch the telling of it, and that’s what sinks this satiric drama based loosely on a 2004 nonfiction book by London-based journalist Jon Ronson. What could have been a shaggy-dog “Dr. Strangelove’’ for our times falls prey to a first-time feature director, an unfocused script, and a lead role that’s both underwritten and miscast.
Not Clooney; he’s fine. Actually, his Lyn Cassady  - a rogue US Army psychic warrior  - is the sort of part tailor-made for this star: supremely confident, a little nuts, primarily reactive. Clooney works best when there’s a Normal for him to bounce off; here that Normal is journalist Bob Wilton, a fictional stand-in for Ronson who (unlike the author) is American and who’s played by British actor Ewan McGregor with a vaguely East Coast accent that should never have made it through Customs.
It’s the early days of the 2003 Iraq invasion, and Wilton is trying to embed himself in-country to prove his macho bona fides to an ex-wife who couldn’t care less. The journalist meets Cassady, who’s posing as a private contractor but whose true identity as a veteran of the shadowy New Earth Army is soon smoked out.
What’s the New Earth Army? Imagine that a Vietnam veteran in the early 1970s dropped out, did a ton of drugs, absorbed every New Age bromide the Left Coast had to offer, then created an experimental unit of hippie warriors trained in psychic arts like “remote viewing’’ (i.e., ESP) and, yes, the ability to stare goats to death. In the real world, the “First Earth Battalion’’ never made it past a training manual that was then co-opted by the US military for psychological warfare and other nefarious purposes. In the movie  - well, we get Jeff Bridges playing “The Dude Goes to War.’’
Bridges is cast as New Earth Army mastermind Bill Django, a ponytailed peacenik fox let loose in the Pentagon henhouse. The richest, most weirdly funny scenes in “The Men Who Stare at Goats’’ are the flashbacks to the secret unit’s training sessions, in which recruits Clooney (with long hair about as convincing as McGregor’s accent), Stephen Root, and others let their inner pagans loose, mastering the “sparkly eyes technique’’ and dancing about like teenage girls at a Grateful Dead concert.
Django’s shamanistic maxims pepper the script like hilarious smart bombs  - “We must become the first superpower with
 super powers,’’ “Be all
 you can be,’’ “The US Army has no alternative but to be wonderful.’’ When Cassady successfully deploys a small plastic widget that “can hurt you a hundred different ways’’ (it looks like an ice scraper), the movie finds its groove: the place where America’s spiritual yearnings and killer instincts meet and intertwine.
But it’s early yet, and the groove gets lost. Cassady leads the reporter deeper into occupied Iraq, and “The Men Who Stare at Goats’’ becomes a cracked buddy movie: Hope and Crosby in “The Road to Baghdad.’’ One problem is that McGregor’s character isn’t funny or even interesting. A larger problem is that Grant Heslov, directing his first feature after writing “Good Night, and Good Luck’’ (as well as producing other Clooney movies), loses his way in the script’s many crosscurrents.
At some point, “The Men Who Stare at Goats’’ has to become about what we’ve done in Iraq  - about how the pacifist ideals of the NEA have been warped by the modern Army  - and it turns both preachy and confused. Kevin Spacey barely shows up for his role as the unit’s designated snake in the grass; the tone shifts from psychedelic “Catch-22’’ to hectic sub-Altman chaos.
Heslov wants us to laugh at the New Earth Army’s hippie-dippy vision and embrace it at the same time, and he’s just not that agile a director. The movie collapses, a disappointing case of coulda-been. Still, it leaves a moral worth treasuring: Free your goats and your mind  - and country  - will follow.

In The Men Who Stare at Goats , George Clooney, as one of the founders of a crackpot U.S. military unit, wears a mustache that makes him look like Dennis Farina, and he does his best to act cool, calm, and collected  which sets him in marked contrast to all the flakes and hysterics around him. The movie is one of those over-the-top absurdist antiwar ''satires'' that are inevitably likened to Dr. Strangelove , though a better comparison might be the fractious, madcap-incoherent film version of Catch-22 . The Men Who Stare at Goats  was directed by Grant Heslov (he worked with Clooney as a producer on Leatherheads  and  Good Night, and Good Luck ), but in this case ''directed'' is a charitable word.
Spinning out the tall tale of a battalion of New Age paranormal soldiers who were trained, during Vietnam, to don cloaks of   invisibility, kill goats with their minds, and generally turn war into a groovy thing, Heslov slaps gags together and never begins to find a point of view. Actors like Jeff Bridges (in a ponytail) and Kevin Spacey (in the worst hairpiece of his career) jabber away as if locked in their own private acting classes, and Ewan McGregor, as the reporter who tags along with Clooney when the troop is revived to help fight the war in Iraq (see, it's a topical movie!), looks about as lost as you'll feel. The Men Who Stare at Goats  is a magical-realist sitcom war farce that ends up being about nothing but its own slovenly smugness.


 In “The Men Who Stare at Goats” George Clooney wears a heavy mustache and a somewhat shaggier version of the military haircut called a high and tight, two adjectives which also describe his performance in this likable, lightweight, absurdist comedy.  As Lyn Cassady — a fictional member of an Army unit that was weirder and possibly truer than most science fiction — Mr. Clooney has shed his cool cat skin to embrace his inner clown. Juggling tics, double takes, eyeball bulges and explosive gestures, he leaps in the air and splats in the sand with cartoon abandon, buoyed by the jokes and the big bounce of his own stardom.  With his thrusting jaw, Lyn looks as if he could have been drawn by Milton Caniff, the creator of the comic-strip tough guy Steve Canyon. Instead Lyn has been drawn in crude if generally effective strokes by Mr. Clooney and his producing partner, Grant Heslov, who together also wrote “Good Night, and Good Luck.” Mr. Clooney directed that film, but for this one Mr. Heslov has moved behind the camera to make a somewhat ragged directing debut. Though he never settles into a groove, moving between would-be parody and could-be sincerity, Mr. Heslov does keep the parts more or less in play, aided by the outlandishness of his story and by the performances of Mr. Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang.  Written by Peter Straughan and based on the nonfiction book by Jon Ronson, also titled “The Men Who Stare at Goats,” the film tells parallel stories that finally join. One involves a journalist, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who after his marriage tanks, heads to Iraq to give his life meaning. What he discovers is Lyn, a recruit in the mysterious New Earth Army, an experimental Army program centered on parapsychology that was developed by a Vietnam vet, Bill Django (Mr. Bridges) and pushed into creation by the gonzo General Hopgood (Mr. Lang). Realizing that he has the makings of a juicy story, Bob tags after Lyn, a decision that leads him both into Iraq and Lyn’s past in the New Earth Army.  Bill’s initiative, born in the fields of Vietnam and baptized in the hot tubs of the New Age movement, brings together Buddhism, pantheism, militarism and old-fashioned hooey-ism, the idea being that war can be waged with love, eagle feathers and assorted paranormal techniques — with a few martial arts moves thrown in. General Hopgood and Lyn take to the program with a seriousness bordering on devotional, partly because Bill, or rather the irresistible Mr. Bridges, could inspire lemmings of any genus.   His batty smile and loosey-goosey gestural performance, which brings to mind a modern dance teacher stoned on good vibes, perfectly complements Mr. Lang’s spring-loaded turn. (Mr. Lang is having a very nice year, with roles  also in Michael Mann’s “Public Enemies” and James Cameron’s “Avatar.”)  Mr. Clooney doesn’t play his part as straight as Mr. Lang or Mr. Bridges  and, especially during the flashbacks when he’s forced into a sloppy pageboy, he seems to be enjoying the joke too much. What makes Mr. Lang’s performance work so well is its unwavering seriousness: he never lets self-amusement cloud his eyes, or his acting. Not so Mr. McGregor, a predictably attractive if superfluous  presence. What makes this a story worth telling, it emerges quickly, isn’t the journalist but the men who thought they could travel the world or stop a goat’s heart with their minds. The journalist hook is an easy way into the material, but both Bob and the flashbacks, which probably account for some of Mr. Heslov’s unsteadiness, get in the way.  There’s more in the mix, including another New Earth Army member, played by an agreeably malevolent Kevin Spacey, and many goats. (They stare right back, by the way.) They’re all fine company, but like Bob and Lyn’s drifting adventures in Iraq, which finds them tooling down dusty roads on a mystery mission, they don’t leave much of a trace. There’s a curious evanescence to the movie, which while apparently based in truth — it recalls a multimillion-dollar project called Star Gate dedicated to parapsychology research that came to light in the mid-1990s — doesn’t add up to anything. It’s wacky, amusing.  But that’s about it. If there are truths to be drawn from the military’s use of men to locate hostages psychically, they’re not evident here.  There is a Lyn in Mr. Ronson’s book, Lyn Buchanan, who wrote about his experience in Star Gate in “The Seventh Sense: The Secrets of Remote Viewing as Told by a ‘Psychic Spy’ for the U.S. Military.” If you think that sounds outlandish, consider that a document on the Central Intelligence Agency Web site claims that the Defense Intelligence Agency has a psychic center, and that the National Security Agency studies parapsychology.  Furthermore, the C.I.A. “reportedly is a member of an Incident Response Team to investigate U.F.O. landings, if one should occur,” the site says. “This team has never met. The lack of solid C.I.A. documentation on Agency U.F.O.-related activities in the 1980s leaves the entire issue somewhat murky for this period.”  “The Men Who Stare at Goats” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Fisticuffs, war violence and one psychically sacrificed goat.

A serendipitous marriage of talent in which all hearts seem to beat as one, "The Men Who Stare at Goats" takes Jon Ronson's book about "the apparent madness at the heart of U.S. military intelligence" and fashions a superbly written loony-tunes satire, played by a tony cast at the top of its game. Recalling many similar pics, from "Dr. Strangelove" to "Three Kings," and the screwy so-insane-it-could-be-true illogic of "Catch-22," this is upscale liberal movie-making with a populist touch, in Coen brothers style. Enthusiastic welcome at Venice, likely to be echoed at Toronto, should translate into friendly biz Stateside in November.
Coming in at a tight, well-paced 93 minutes, Grant Heslov's second feature -- after his little-seen anti-corporate golf comedy, "Par 6" (2002) -- clearly benefits from his close working relationship with star George Clooney, following their writing collaboration on "Good Night, and Good Luck." It also benefits from the dense but pacey screenplay by Brit playwright Peter Straughan, whose credits include "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" and "Mrs. Ratcliffe's Revolution."
"Goats" is officially "inspired" by Ronson's book, which accompanied a three-part docu series, shown on Blighty's Channel 4 in late 2004, called "Crazy Rulers of the World," tracing some of the U.S. military's more outre ideas for policing the world, terrorism in particular. Straughan's screenplay takes many of the stories from the book -- apparently true, per Ronson, who's made a career from recounting "true tales of everyday craziness" -- and, as a way into the material, invents the character of a small-time, Ann Arbor, Mich.-based journalist, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who's desperate to get into Iraq at the time of the Bush invasion.
After a comically cautionary intertitle ("More of this is true than you would believe") and an opening gag (repeated, with a variation, at the end) that immediately sets the tone, the first reel is thick with info and time shifts from the present (starting in fall 2002) back to the early '80s, which are a tad difficult to digest on first viewing.
In a nutshell, Wilton, assigned to interview Gus Lacey (Stephen Root), an apparent wacko who claims he has special psychic powers, stumbles across an even crazier story: Back in the '80s, the government had a top-secret unit of "psychic spies" who were trained to kill animals by staring at them. The most gifted of the group, says Lacey, was a certain Lyn Cassady.
Wilton heads for the Middle East in spring 2003, looking for a good war story. Stuck in Kuwait City, he bumps into "Skip" (Clooney), who initially claims to be an Arkansas trashcan salesman but is actually Cassady, who's been reactivated and is on a super-secret black-op mission to Iraq.
As the two bond, and Wilton persuades Cassady to take him along, it's clear Cassady's elevator stops well short of the top floor. Claiming to be a "remote viewer," "Jedi warrior" and several other things in between, Cassady fills Wilton in on the formation 20 years earlier of the New Earth Army, brainchild of a Vietnam vet-turned-New Age hippie, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges, with goatee and pigtail).
In one sequence straight out of the Joseph Heller playbook, the U.S. military decided to adopt Django's New Earth manual, written with liberal doses of LSD, as a new template for ways of policing the globe. "We must be the first superpower to have super powers," exhorts Django, setting up a squad of psychics he dubs "warrior monks."
As the pic flip-flops between flashbacks illustrating Cassady's narrative and the present time, the pair get lost in the desert, kidnapped and traded by terrorists, and then lost again in the desert. Meanwhile, the backstory progresses to a point where one new member, Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey), tried to sabotage the NEA, prepping the movie for its acidly funny climax.
Incredibly dense screenplay traverses not only 20 years of U.S. military abitions, starting in the Reagan era, but also provides its own riffs on such public scandals as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. What saves it from getting dramatically tripped up by its own populist grandstanding are the leading perfs, which motor the movie far more than the messages.
As the completely nuts Cassady, Clooney anchors the movie in a beautifully calibrated demo of comic timing and sheer physical presence. More than just his nebbish straight man, McGregor has some of the best lines, slicing through Clooney's utter self-conviction with a handful of well-chosen words. Bridges, channeling "The Big Lebowski," fits Django like a glove, and Spacey's appearance midway adds some welcome tartness to all the New Age weirdness.
Robert Elswit's beautifully composed widescreen lensing of New Mexico's deserts (standing in for Iraq) and Puerto Rico (repping Vietnam and other locations) is aces, without dominating the characters. Other tech credits, including Tatiana S. Riegel's smoothly succinct editing, are top drawer.
End crawl stresses that though some characters are based on real people (the New Earth Army was reportedly the idea of a certain Col. Jim Channon), the movie is a work of fiction. Yeah, right.

Historical cataclysm produces conspiratorial thinking: Germany's loss in World War I, the JFK assassination, and 9/11 are all naturally understood as the stuff of unimaginable plots, unspeakable cover-ups, and unseen forces.
The guys who made The Men Who Stare at Goats  can't quite decide whether this syndrome is risible or heavy or simply far-out. Perhaps hoping to seduce a receptive viewer with hypnosis, they open their movie with a bug-eyed close-up of a would-be psychic and the mind-fucking assertion that "more of this is true than you would believe."
And, all critical thinking aside, would you believe that George Clooney 's latest production—directed by Grant Heslov  (who wrote the Good Night and Good Luck  screenplay) and loosely adapted from gonzo journalist-filmmaker Jon Ronson 's 2005 account of the U.S. Army 's adventures in paranormality—is meant to be a comedy? Perhaps in 1967, and under the right pharmaceutical conditions, it might have seemed so, playing as an antic blend of Catch-22  military absurdism and the counterculture bible Morning of the Magicians ' "non-conformist reality."
Ronson 's book—which takes its title from experimental attempts to induce goat coronaries with the evil eye—traced a circuitous path from the CIA's Eisenhower-era LSD experiments to more recent applications of musical mind control. Heslov's movie focuses on Ronson's greatest scoop, namely the battalion of occultist commandos—here called the New Earth Army—cooked up by a Viet vet colonel gone New Age. Stumbling through an obstacle course of flashbacks, the movie sends a hapless American reporter (Ewan McGregor ) into the cauldron of Desert Storm, where, meeting one of these Jedi Warriors , the New Earth Army's super-intense, one-time champion goat-starer (Clooney), he loses a smidge of his smirk.
Clooney's demonstration of cloud-busting creates a few sitcom complications. But The Men Who Stare at Goats  only picks up (however briefly) with the introduction of Jeff Bridges . He's the man who—having survived near-death in Nam and subsequently parboiled his brain in the hot tubs of Big Sur —sold the brass on the notion of the New Earth Army: "We'll be the first superpower to have superpowers!" Bridges's liberation training, delivered with a maximum of happy-go-lucky Dudeness, is a regimen that mixes High Times  with high colonics, mass Buddhist prayer, and free-form dancing to Billy Idol 's greatest hit. The grooviness grinds to a halt (as does the movie) when this cheerful shaman is outmaneuvered by Kevin Spacey 's Mr. Bad Vibes.
An uptight psychic party pooper, Spacey effects a coup and leads Bridges's band of brothers over to the dark side, privatizing the force by outsourcing psy-ops to his own company and purging the New Earth Army of its touchy-feely, transcendental "hippie crap." It's almost like a metaphor for America going from bad (the wacky spectacle of soldiers training to be fighting monks) to worse (Spacey directing soldiers to subject POWs to brain-destroying sound loops of Barney the Dinosaur  singing "I Love You") and back again! (The happy ending is a climactic hootenanny involving the old CIA fantasy of dumping acid in the water supply.)
Despite a backbeat of perky music and the sarcastic voiceover meant to lubricate the action, The Men Who Stare at Goats  lacks pizzazz. The movie isn't funny enough to work as farce, but it's far too dippy to take seriously. What's mildly exasperating is that there is an actual quest involved: The Men Who Stare at Goats  goes out to the desert in search of its tone—and never finds it.
Speaking of conspiracies: Warner Bros.' decision to withhold press screenings for the new Richard Kelly  film The Box  until two days before its opening, precludes my writing about it in these pages; a short review will be posted on the Voice  website November 6.
