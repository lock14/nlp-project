         Who in America, no matter how highly placed, couldn't honestly confess to Iraq information overload, to having taken in enough about that beleaguered country and its ceaseless crises to last several lifetimes? But no matter how Baghdad-ed out you may feel, make room for "Gunner Palace," a striking new documentary that shows the war in a way it's not been seen before: from the ground up.
 
  The gunners of the title are the 400 or so members of a stationed-in-Baghdad U.S. Army artillery brigade that Michael Tucker (who co-directed the film with Petra Epperlein) spent two separate one-month periods with in 2003 and 2004.
 


         






    The palace in which the gunners are housed is no euphemism: It is the former pleasure dome of Saddam Hussein's son Uday Hussein, complete with swimming pool and putting green and located in the Adhamiya area of the city, one of the deposed leader's former strongholds.
 
  Unlike the usual documentary procedure, "Gunner Palace" doesn't single out one or two soldiers to follow through the city's mean streets. What it aims for and achieves instead is a group portrait of today's volunteer army, what it's up to and up against in Iraq.
 
  As opposed to the fulsome official rhetoric we hear from time to time on the soundtrack, "Gunner Palace" shows us what grunt-level existence is really like for beleaguered but unbowed U.S. troops. We see the grittiness and the tedium, the heightened unreality and the ever-present danger that make up day-to-day life in this peculiar war zone.
 
  As one of the soldiers laconically puts it, "For y'all, this is just a show, but we live in this movie."
 
  As has been often reported about Iraq, a surprising number of soldiers there are teenagers fresh out of high school from tiny hamlets described as "an atlas of forgotten America."
 
  The kids who live in Baghdad's Gunner Palace would likely be unnerved by Los Angeles, so it's hardly a surprise that they couldn't be more confused and disconcerted by Baghdad's foreignness if it were the far side of the moon.
 
  Adding to the difficulty of the situation is that the nature of the Army's current mission means that, as someone puts it, these artillery soldiers, "people who like to blow stuff up, are now policemen, social workers, politicians and truant officers," even, in one case, getting a glue-sniffing kid off the street before he gets into trouble.
 
  Because "Gunner Palace" takes the broad view it does, we meet a whole range of soldiers, from the reflective to the self-absorbed. There are fathers who visit orphanages because they miss their own kids, and there are young guys proud to be 19-year-old war veterans in a place that provides entertainment "better than any movie, any sitcom."
 
  There are goofballs who enjoy "scaring the natives" and one man who says simply, "I don't feel like I'm defending my country anymore."
 
  As we see these guys go out on security missions, worrying about encountering IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and dreaming about visits to the airport Burger King, several things about the reality of the American mission in Iraq become inescapable.
 
  The first is how easy it is for our troops to become overmatched by the reality of a place with a different language, religion and culture. The soldiers we see tend to be well-intentioned but beleaguered, frustrated by the limits of their effectiveness.
 
  So an Iraqi woman who is in danger from terrorists is given the most desultory handgun instruction, and the Iraqi troops being trained do not look like they will be ready to defend their country any time soon, no matter what the politicians are claiming.
 
  On the other hand, "Gunner Palace" unexpectedly makes you understand that, despite how unpromising it can all seem, it's due to something positive and determined in the spirit of these soldiers that things are not worse in Iraq than they are.
 
  Co-director Tucker says in the press materials that he felt guided by the words of one GI's father, who told him, "Let me tell you how I can be so against this war and so for my son," and this in fact is the spirit of "Gunner Palace."
 
  The soldiers in "Gunner Palace" are mostly without illusions of any kind, like the man who challenges the audience back home when he poignantly says, "You'll forget all this. The only people who'll remember it is us."
 
  It is this film's accomplishment that it has made sure that won't happen any time soon.

The war in Iraq could wind up yielding an image every bit as iconic as that of helicopters buzzing the rice paddies of Vietnam: an American soldier in desert fatigues, cradling a bulky M16, standing tall in the back of a Humvee as it speeds along the roads of Baghdad. That image is repeated, in endless variations, in the documentary Gunner Palace . The soldiers, with their goggles and action-movie attitudes, look awfully butch up there, yet they know that they could hit a roadside bomb at any point. The vision of force, hardware, and a touch of bluster camouflaging a state of high anxiety is a perfect summation of the U.S. presence in Iraq.
It's a symbol, however, that Gunner Palace  employs with more than a touch of attitude itself. Michael Tucker, one of the film's codirectors (the other is Petra Epperlein), lived with the 2/3 Field Artillery for two months in 2003, and he serves up vérita e] slices of the regiment's daily lives, the sort that rarely make it onto the news. A soldier snarls a rap lyric into the camera, flashing his gold teeth. Another does a mock dance in Arab robes, and one stands in back of the bombed-out former mansion of Saddam Hussein's son Uday (now christened Gunner Palace), glancing at the swimming pool as he says, ''This is our party site.'' A predawn raid becomes an homage to Cops, as the soldiers break into a house, shouting ''Get down! Get down!'' only to come face to face with...a white-haired old lady and a little girl. ''The sheikh is out  gone to Fallujah,'' says Tucker, his voice dripping with irony at a mission that has turned up dust.
Could it be an accident that his narration sounds like a parody of Martin Sheen's dead-man-walking affect in Apocalypse Now ? In Gunner Palace , Tucker appears to be working overtime to show us that Iraq has become the 21st-century ''rock & roll war,'' a cauldron of violence and frat-house psychosis. The film's fragmentary structure, though, is suspect. It says that the soldiers find no real meaning in their combat actions, yet Gunner Palace  presents the operations we're seeing in so little context, reducing them to  a random hash of ''sensational'' moments, that Tucker at times appears to be exploiting the war to create a didactic canvas of manic military unease. His viewpoint shrivels next to that of the recent Frontline documentary  A Company of Soldiers , which caught the bone-deep humanity of our forces, even at their most desperate, in a way that this movie never touches.

he title of "Gunner Palace," a vivid and hectic documentary directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, refers to a monstrous pleasure dome in the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya that once belonged to Uday Hussein, one of the rotten princelings of the old regime. Its opulence somewhat reduced by American bombs, the building now serves as a barracks for American soldiers, who make use of its swimming pool and putting green when they are not patrolling the dangerous streets of the Iraqi capital, raiding the homes of suspected terrorists and trying to juggle the complicated, hazardous duties of occupation. Mr. Tucker, an American who makes his home in Germany, spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 unofficially embedded with the United States Army's 2-3 Field Artillery Division (known as the Gunners) in the palace. The resulting film is an unruly, riveting assemblage of anecdotes and impressions. The larger political and military questions about the war in Iraq are kept deliberately in the background, which some viewers may find frustrating. "Gunner Palace" does not present a clear or coherent point of view of why or how the war has been fought, but this limitation is also a virtue. Clarity and certainty, the movie suggests, are luxuries that come with distance and hindsight. What the soldiers have to deal with from day to day is far more chaotic and changeable, so it makes  sense that chaos should be not only  the filmmakers' subject but also a crucial aspect of their method. Early on, Mr. Tucker invokes reality television to emphasize the contrast between such manufactured spectacles as "Survivor" and the real business of surviving, but "Gunner Palace" owes as much of a debt to small-screen v�rit� as it does to the loftier traditions of nonfiction cinema. It's hard not to see jerky, breathless hand-held images of armed men in uniform cruising through rough neighborhoods without thinking of "Cops," or to witness young Americans hanging out in their shared quarters, accoutered with headphones, laptops and other high-tech accessories, without being reminded of "The Real World." Perhaps inadvertently, Mr. Tucker and Ms. Epperlein have glimpsed Iraq through the lens of American popular culture, and their film is also a mirror, reflecting back into that culture an image of itself at once utterly alien and entirely familiar. Mr. Tucker's occasional voice-over narration is deliberately flat and prosaic. The rough poetry that his video camera captured belongs to the setting - a landscape that is bright, teeming and tense by day, eerie and murky by night - and to the soldiers, several of whom are talented free-style rappers and spoken-word declaimers. Their rhymes and beats punctuate the film and provide it with a dense, dizzying eloquence. But even soldiers with plainer verbal styles and different modes of expression manage to stamp their experiences with something of their own personalities. The older officers speak in world-weary bureaucratese, their professionalism tinged with both cynicism and pride. The unit's designated cut-up, a round-faced soldier from Colorado who seems alternately sensitive and sociopathic, strums his electric guitar and cracks jokes. One young man speaks excitedly of the thrill of combat, while another muses that nothing is ever improved by the taking of a life. In refusing to generalize or to judge, "Gunner Palace" opens itself up to varying interpretations, all of them likely to be colored by the interpreter's prior opinions about the war. The soldiers' irreverent humor, and the efficient brutality with which they break into Iraqi homes in their hunt for "bad guys," may suggest a prelude to the abuse at Abu Ghraib (which is where, we are told, many of those arrested will go). The scene of an American officer, who speaks no Arabic, trying to moderate a raucous neighborhood council meeting, reveals both the absurd challenge of imposing democracy on Iraq and also the patience, seriousness and goodwill it requires. The interactions between Iraqis and the Americans suggest a mutual ambivalence - a desire for some kind of constructive relationship that coexists with suspicion, incomprehension and sometimes contempt. Iraq and the United States are both societies full of contradiction, and to watch "Gunner Palace" is to see the contradictions multiply. And not only on screen. I have now seen it twice - the first time last fall, at the Toronto Film Festival, with the American presidential election on the horizon, and the second time not long after the Iraqi elections this past January - and each time my reaction was colored by events outside the theater. In that sense, the movie, like the war that it partly chronicles, remains unfinished, to be completed - or further complicated - in the public arguments and private reflections of its audience. For every viewer who finds the film's portrayal of the troops troublingly unsympathetic, there will be another who finds it insufficiently critical. But this says more about the audience than about the film, which respects the humanity of its subjects by regarding them with a mixture of admiration, puzzlement and worry, and mostly by listening to what they have to say, even when they contradict themselves. The raw inconclusiveness of "Gunner Palace" is the truest measure of its authenticity as an artifact of our time and of its value for future attempts to understand what the United States is doing in Iraq. Over the last few years, we have been subjected to an awful lot of certainty - from proponents of the war, from its critics and even from vacillators and equivocators. "Gunner Palace," in its savage, intelligent, boisterous messiness, is a welcome antidote to the self-convinced rhetoric of pundits and politicians. Each time I have seen it, I have emerged feeling moved, angry, scared, hopeful, frustrated and dispirited - and grateful for this confusion, which is its own form of understanding. This film is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and violent scenes.

A you-are-there portrait of the war in Iraq as experienced by American soldiers in central Baghdad, "Gunner Palace" vividly delivers important images of the conflict, hitherto unavailable to the public. Made without any overt political agenda, direct cinema-style docu clearly demonstrates that, for the soldiers themselves, the issue isn't politics or democratization but simply day-to-day survival. Rough-and-ready pic, which was acquired by Palm Pictures after its Telluride world premiere, has some commercial prospects in limited theatrical release before finding broader exposure on homevid, DVD and cable.
Co-director Michael Tucker, who's from a military family, did two one-month stints with the roughly 400 members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery, first in September 2003 and again in February 2004. In between, the troop made the cover of Time magazine as "Person of the Year." Home for these volunteer soldiers during their 410-day tours of duty is the enormous, bombed out Azimiya Palace, one of the gaudy creations of Saddam Hussein that served as a pleasure palace for his son, Uday.
While the men (only one female soldier is glimpsed) are sometimes seen kicking back -- the palace has a pool and putting green -- pic's focus is trained on their daily rounds. Tucker regularly jumps, "Cops"-style, right into the Humvees along with the soldiers, providing a valuable look at Iraq the way they see it. There are the bustling streets of downtown Baghdad; the vigilant lookout for IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices); a contentious local council meeting; surprise raids on homes in search of suspects or weapons caches; rocks thrown by bystanders at vehicles; an Iraqi civil defense drill, and dealings with locals ranging from a kid zonked out on glue to possible spies and insurgents.
Through it all, the soldiers comment on what's going on, sometimes via engaging, eloquently wrought raps. Mostly very young men, they have the spirit and confidence of youth honed to a physical peak and an attitudinal sharpness undiluted by drink or drugs, unlike some of their counterparts of the Vietnam era. There's an expected degree of macho cockiness, but the dominant personal trait is a prudence born of the knowledge that death may await in any bag lying on the street or in any truck that may pull up next to you.
When Tucker returns for his second visit to Gunner Palace, which is located in what at least then was one of the most dangerous districts of Baghdad, he learns that while he was gone, several officers have been killed by roadside bombs. During the period the film was made, eight men attached to 2/3 FA were killed.
As it jumps around from soldier to soldier to reveal the diversity of American military experiences in Iraq, the film allows acquaintanceship but not closeness to its subjects; it's not a work in which one becomes deeply connected to the people in it. At the same time, it makes quite clear how one can, without contradiction, support the troops individually and collectively, and still object to the enterprise that put them in this very foreign and increasingly perilous environment.
There is also a decided pop culture aspect to the way the viewer experiences the film, as well as to the soldiers' consciousness of it. "For y'all this is just a show, but we live in this movie," one young man raps, and the film indisputably resembles a reality show in some respects, one marked by rapid lurches between action and boredom rather than by manufactured melodrama.
Put together by Tucker and his co-director/editor wife Petra Epperlein without a hint of artifice, docu offers up its sounds and images bluntly, and they are very much sounds and images worth having as part of the record.

Documentaries, like spinach, are supposed to be good for you and healthy for the body politic. The most striking thing about Gunner Palace , Michael Tucker  and Petra Epperlein 's fascinating, if not entirely satisfying, digital video portrait of U.S. forces in Iraq , is that it addresses a hunger for leafy greenswhich is to say, images of the warthat you may not have known you had.
Those who lived through the Vietnam  periodand perhaps even more those who didn'tare familiar with that war's lysergic jungle iconography, rock chopper soundtrack, and druggy "Born to Kill" ethos. Gunner Palace , which John Kerry  screened for his fellow senators last month, begins to provide a comparable simulation. Its points of reference are not Motown and westerns but rap and reality TV. Indeed, this often chaotic camcorder documentaryproduced during Tucker's two two-month stretches embedded with the 2-3 Field Artillerymost often suggests a combination of The Real World   and Cops , set to a plaintive gangsta beat.
The "Gunners" are barracked in one of Uday Hussein 's pleasure palaces. "We dropped a bomb on it and now we party in it," one of Tucker's roommates explains. The ambience suggests a post-nuclear Las Vegas a bunch of small-town kids with automatic weapons camped out in an abandoned luxury hotel, splashing around in the pool, putting golf balls amid the rubble of a goonish Arabian Nights  fantasy. But these children of Oprah  and the Internet are nothing if not self-conscious. Most are happy to perform for Tucker's camcorder, clowning in burnoose or expressing inanities they might have heard on TV. The most articulate are the group's rappers: "When those guns start blazing and our friends get hit, that's when our hearts start racing and our stomachs get woozy," Specialist Richmond Shaw  concludes his number. "Cuz for y'all this is just a show but we live in this movie."
The brass is nonexistent but the kids are documented having fun with their Iraqi interpretersmiddle-aged guys to whom they give nicknames like Mike Tyson  and Superstar. (Throughout the movie, these men are killed off-camera or exposed as spies.) Unable to get jiggy with the local women, the soldiers seem to enjoy themselves most when playing with Iraqi kids. One goes to an orphanage and presents a three-year-old with a SpongeBob SquarePants  doll: "He's one of my heroes." (Does that constitute child abuse or only cultural imperialism?)
Gunner Palace  is set almost entirely in Baghdad , mainly in late 2003, when Saddam , still at large, was being blamed for the insurgency, with additional material filmed in early 2004. GWB had declared major combat to be over 10 months before, but the movie resounds with the rifle fire of "minor combat." Meanwhile, more distant than guerrilla mortars, upbeat official bulletins whistle overhead: Secretary Rumsfeld  conveys his best wishes to the Iraqi people. "Life has improved, Comrades. Life has become more joyous," as J.V. Stalin  told the All-Union Convention of Stakhanovite Workers  in 1935.
Adrenaline pumps whenever the Gunners go on downtown patrol. If Vietnam reminded Michael Herr  of Fort Apache , this feels more like Fort Apache, the Bronx complete with glue-sniffing 12-year-old street kids. The soldiers sense hidden hostility all around themhardly a paranoid response in a world where any stray plastic bag might conceal a roadside bomb. The movie might be subtitled "Incomprehensible Doings on the Iraqi Street." Nerves are raw. Sometimes the guys enjoy "scaring the natives," by rolling through town with feedback blasting from their Hummers. A psyop to the barrio carries intimations of Black Hawk Down , although, with a nod to Apocalypse Now , the men play a bit of "Ride of the Valkyries" to set the mood.
No weapons are found in most of the raids we see. Often, however, the Gunners take prisoners anywayand there's more resonance than the filmmakers may have originally intended when the soldiers threaten unruly (usually English-speaking) captives with being "sent to Cuba." Tucker, who comes from a military family, is an empathetic observer of these ordinary enlisted men and one woman. We never see any casualties, although he takes pains to telegraph his suffering when some of the soldiers he's embedded with die.
Mainly, however, Tucker seems to partake in the mood of disassociated bewilderment. Floating on the surface of confusion, Gunner Palace  has a raw home video quality that's often quite beautiful. Much of the movie is hardly more than an immersion in sights and sounds. Vivid as it is, Gunner Palace  is dominated by what isn't shown. It's the human face of Abu Ghraib .
