More than just a fun three hours at the movies, Grindhouse
 is a total immersion into movie geekdom, in which the packaging, marketing, lore, and accumulative experience are as much a part of the deal as the images that are up on the screen. If they could, I suspect Rodriguez and Tarantino would design their own grind-house movie chain of theatres that would re-create the urban scuzz-holes of the past, which ran cheap movies nonstop � a usually eclectic mix of exploitation, horror, and action films, as well as a random assortment of top studio product that had seen better days and more intact prints. As it is, Grindhouse
 is an homage to an experience rather than any certain type of film, and with its two separate feature films � �Planet Terror� by Rodriguez and �Death Proof� by Tarantino � a host of tongue-in-cheeky trailers by the likes of Rob Zombie, Edgar Wright, and Eli Roth; scratches and notices of missing reels intentionally inserted into the prints in order to heighten the illusion of the celluloid�s sprocket-weary authenticity; a splashy two-for-the-price-of-one marketing campaign; and enough cast members to keep the talk-show couches on permanent rotation, Grindhouse
 raises the bar for a certain kind of movie lollapalooza (and also for the kind of filmmaker who is also a showman, along the lines of a William Castle or Cecil B. DeMille). It�s this injection of playfulness and fun and attention to the entire moviegoing gestalt that will probably become Grindhouse
�s lasting contribution to movie history rather than any on-the-screen content of the movie itself. Ultimately, �Planet Terror� and �Death Proof� are as transient and expendable as the movies they ape (which is meant as a tribute to their authenticity rather than a put-down). Of course, by now, everyone in Austin knows that Grindhouse
 was filmed here last summer, and part of the local fun will derive from the sight of and references to familiar locations in Tarantino�s section, whose first half is set in Austin. First up, however, is Rodriguez�s �Planet Terror,� a zombie barrage that begins with some pus and guts and builds to an all-out Armageddon between the humans and zombies. Rodriguez again proves that he�s a brilliant action director, making those of us who wish he would give at least equal attention to his scripts seem churlish for desiring more storyline when he�s able to invent a set-piece as good as that of a leading lady who has a machine gun for a leg (McGowan). Tarantino�s half is harder to judge within its Grindhouse
 context, as �Death Proof� is practically two discrete movies in itself � the first part a talky jamboree of girls� night out and the second a gloriously staged car chase/vengeance film, which plays like a demented filmmaker/fan�s love offering to stuntwoman Zo� Bell (who is showcased here doing her own stunts) and the non-Disney career of Kurt Russell (who plays a badass called Stuntman Mike in both "Death Proof" segments). Following the zombie rampage of "Planet Terror" and the crazed momentum of the whacked-out trailers and fake ads, the detail-rich dialogue of Tarantino's girls-night-out segment becomes an unfortunate victim of the adrenaline-fueled madness that precedes it. Then an abrupt change of place and characters, linked only by the centrality of Stuntman Mike in both segments, leads directly into the near-wordless muscle-car mayhem that consumes the second half of "Death Proof. " I imagine that somewhere down the line we'll get to see "Death Proof" and "Planet Terror" as stand-alone DVD releases with lots of extras, which is the point at which we'll get a better handle on how Tarantino's film plays without the pacing predicament of this combo release. Grindhouse
 holds a wealth of opportunities for potential DVD releases in the future: Don't be surprised to see whole movies spun out from some of the trailers or characters (Trejo's Machete and Poitier's Jungle Julia seem likely candidates) or a special directors' cut version that restores the missing reels and "remasters" out the splices and scratches. Rodriguez and Tarantino are nothing if not inexhaustible masters of movie revivification. (For more about
 Grindhouse, see p.56 of this week's Screens section.)



By the time Fergie is dismembered by zombies, you know you're in good hands. She tastes Fergalicious, I'm guessing.
The Black Eyed Peas singer is far from the only casualty in "Grindhouse," Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's cheerfully reprehensible ode to '70s exploitation movies. Good taste also dies a screaming death, along with half the enthusiastic cast, two classic muscle cars, and the audience's ability to resist. At 3 hours and 11 minutes, your rear end may also cry uncle.
But it works. This Frankenstein monster -- two homages to craptastic drive-in movies stitched into one shambling feature -- transports you to the outer limits of creative schlock. The classic exploitation films from which "Grindhouse" takes its name and geysering life blood only wanted to shock the money out of you. Tarantino and Rodriguez are after both more and less: They want you to cover your eyes in disbelief and
 get the unholy giggles at the same time. You do, but in two very different ways, and that's the movie's strength.
"Grindhouse" essentially offers a complete night at the movies: two 85-minute feature films, coming attraction trailers (directed by modern horror stalwarts Eli Roth , Rob Zombie , and Edgar Wright ), missing-reel title cards circa 1968, and disgusting ads for the burrito restaurant next door to the theater. The print is lovingly scuffed and scratched -- the cinematic equivalent of stressed jeans.
First up is Rodriguez's "Planet Terror ," a mutant-zombie-attack movie with a soupçon of "General Hospital " thrown in: There are married doctors (Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton ) with bonesaws to grind, a sheriff (Michael Biehn ) and his barbecue -shack owner brother (fellow '80s action survivor Jeff Fahey ), a foulmouthed pair of identical twin teenage Mexican baby sitters (Rodriguez's nieces Elise and Electra Avellan ), and hordes of pustulous zombies. Oh, and Bruce Willis .
Mostly, though, there's Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan ), a go-go dancer (not
 a stripper, thank you) with a hard heart, a quivering lip, and -- as "Planet Terror" progresses -- several usefully lethal prostheses where her right leg was, before it got bitten off. By her side is Wray (Freddy Rodriguez ), a pint-size mystery man who acquires more and more mojo until he's quite logically leaping off the walls, Bruce Lee -style.
"Planet Terror" is shallow, but it may be Rodriguez's most consistent piece of work, and some people will like it a lot more than Tarantino's "Death Proof ." (Trailers for "Werewolf Women of the SS " and a horror movie called "Don't! " are sandwiched between.) Some will prefer the Tarantino. Others probably ran screaming from this review after the first paragraph; let 'em go. To my mind, "Death Proof" has lower lows but much higher highs -- where Rodriguez is happy to play in the fields of genre pastiche, his partner just can't help making a Quentin Tarantino movie.
At first, that seems like bad news, as "Death Proof" settles in with a quartet of tough-talking women -- Jackie Brown times four -- and lets them jaw amusingly but aimlessly. The key figures are played by Sydney Poitier (daughter of film legend Sidney ) and Vanessa Ferlito ("CSI: NY" ), and the dialogue feels like a retread of the banter in "Pulp Fiction " and the "Kill Bill " movies. The tone ambles between comedy, suspense , and something harder to pin down. Our attention begins to drift.
But wait: What's Kurt Russell doing in the corner of that bar? The onetime Disney kid and "Escape From New York " hard case plays Stuntman Mike , a smiling lady-killer with a deadly hot rod -- all Freudian symbolism gleefully intentional. And here are three more women for him to potentially entrap: a movie stuntwoman named Zoe (played by the real New Zealand stuntwoman Zoe Bell ), her colleague Kim (Tracie Thoms ), and a nail-spitting make up girl named Abernathy (Rosario Dawson ).
Tarantino name checks a number of car-crash exploitation classics: "Vanishing Point ," "Dirty Mary Crazy Larry ," "Gone in 60 Seconds " ("the real one, not that Angelina Jolie [expletive]," says Kim). Soon enough, though, it becomes clear that he's driving straight into the valley of "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, " Russ Meyer's mighty 1965 sleaze opus about power-babes on a revenge kick. The segment begins to pick up speed. Then it goes faster, and funnier, than you thought possible. And then it goes further.
By this point, all the campy '70s touches have fallen away, and Tarantino's just grooving on speed and on the sight of women in charge (all three actresses are just wonderful). If "Grindhouse" has any precedent, it may be the 1967 concept album "The Who Sell Out ," which Pete Townshend sequenced like an actual AM radio station, with pimple-cream ads wedged between the Who songs. Like the album, "Grindhouse" loses interest in its own concept toward the end and simply lets the creative juices flow. That's not a bad thing.
Ultimately, the movie is just about clever boys (and girls) playing with their toys (and girls), at times to delirious effect. Never does "Grindhouse" play for keeps, though -- never do you feel that transgressive tug that says you're watching something you shouldn't.
Except once. One of the fake trailers is for a horror movie called "Thanksgiving ," about a serial killer who strikes on turkey day. While it's an obvious "Halloween " parody, the segment's sickly, washed-out footage and shots of crudely filmed violence make one genuinely uneasy. I don't think I'll ever get the final image out of my head, and I'm not even sure what's happening in it.
"Thanksgiving" is an unclean thing, in other words, and it's the handiwork of Eli Roth , director of "Hostel " and Mrs. Roth's boy from Newton . Alone in the merry moral wasteland of "Grindhouse," he understands that schlock without a sense of sin is just playing dress-up.


In Grindhouse , their crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez re-create the junk cinema of their youth with a deftly amused appreciation for its cheeseball squalor. But they also celebrate those films for their accidental B-movie nihilism, their freedom . The low-budget, anything-goes genre movies that sprung up like weeds during the '70s had a distinct, tasty decadence  a depraved underground allure. Taken as drama, they were glum and listless, often borderline inept, but they weren't trying to be ''good.'' They were vehicles for sensation  for nudity and zombie flesh, for cars screaming down the road with a death-rattle roar  and since sensation was more or less the only thing alive in them, their cruddiness worked in a peculiar way. In the very apathy of their storytelling, they expressed the blasted, what do we do now?  hangover of the post-counterculture era; in their promise of cheap thrills, they offered a down-and-dirty escape from that alienation. They were rooted in the action of the moment, and only the moment. They were drive-in rock & roll.
Grindhouse  wants to give you a ticky-tacky good time, and does, but it also taps the wild, jagged spasms of aggression that gave those films their primitive outlaw style. In doing so, it summons the most crackerjack pop charge of any movie with Tarantino's name on it since Pulp Fiction .
Tarantino and Rodriguez have conceived Grindhouse  as an old-school, three-hour night at the movies, a trash-heaven double bill complete with scratchy mismatched prints, trailers for unspeakably bad slasher and revenge films (I loved the ones for Machete   ''He just f---ed with the wrong Mexican!''  and the deeply sick Thanksgiving ), even that twirling-rainbow ''Our Feature Presentation'' fanfare. Growing up in the '70s, I spent my share of time in grind-house theaters, and I can testify: This is exactly  what it felt like. The first movie on the bill is Rodriguez's Planet Terror , a bottom-of-the-barrel living-dead thriller, set in a present day that feels just like 1974, with zombies that get shot and spurt raspberry Jell-O blood. Rodriguez captures a particular mood of desultory, badly lit gross-out ghoulishness, and he does it with such heightened fanboy exactitude that it's as if he'd made the Far From Heaven  of schlock. He gets the wormy dank images, the slam-lurch editing, the greasy synth score, the leaden early attempts at ''irony.'' He also gets the sprawlingly vague disaster-movie narrative (it's got something to do with toxic green gas and Osama bin Laden) that's really just a frame for insanely arbitrary mutating-flesh effects, which tend to come out of nowhere anyway. When a title announces there's a missing reel, it hardly matters: The film cuts to an apocalyptic inferno at a barbecue joint, and it's as if we'd lost nothing.
The actors don't miss a beat of badness, which raises a question: Why is this movie so much more fun than the ones it's copying? In part, because Rodriguez gives it little kinks of hyperbole, like Rose McGowan as a stripper who ends up with a machine gun for a prosthetic leg. But also because Grindhouse , like Ed Wood  and Boogie Nights , celebrates how certain low-grade entertainment, viewed in hindsight, looks different now than it did then, since we can see the ''innocence'' of its creation  the handmade quality of it  in a world not yet ruled by corporate technology.
Where Planet Terror  is an instant classic of deadpan perfection, Death Proof , Tarantino's crash-and-burn homage to the road-demon genre of Vanishing Point  and White Line Fever , is a flawed yet audacious hell-bent head trip. It starts off as Tarantino's most intricate jam session of trash-talking girls (and their sexy bare feet), only to introduce Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, a scarred old TV stunt driver who turns out to be a lot less charming than he looks. Death Proof , in tone, begins as a period piece but then shifts gears to a quartet of contemporary Hollywood women (including Rosario Dawson and Zoë Bell). Their endless jabbering sex talk lands somewhere between the hypnotic and the exhausted, but Tarantino is merely setting us up for the kill: the wildest, rowdiest, most bravura two-car road duel since the grind-house era, which the movie now exhilaratingly brings into our  era. You don't just get off on the speed; you get hooked on the desire for death. The final showdown is sheer brutality, sheer bliss, and sheer primal statement on the new power balance of the sexes. It will leave you laughing, gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass.

Correction Appended The essence of “Grindhouse,” Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s exuberant, uneven tribute to the spirit of trash cinema, is distilled in a scene from “Death Proof,” Mr. Tarantino’s feature-length contribution to the project. Two vintage American muscle cars, already scuffed and dented from chasing each other along back roads and two-lane blacktops, descend, engines whining and tires squealing, onto a highway full of late-model minivans, S.U.V.’s and family sedans, all of them driving safely within the lines and the speed limit. It’s a great car chase, but it’s also a metaphor. “Grindhouse,” soaked in bloody nostalgia for the cheesy, disreputable pleasures of an older form of movie entertainment, can also be seen as a passionate protest against the present state of the entertainment industry. Those Detroit relics, modified with loving care in someone’s garage or backyard, may waste gas and burn oil, but they seem to have an individuality — a soul — that the homogeneous new vehicles, with their G.P.S. and their cruise control, their computer chips and their air bags, can never hope to match. And “Grindhouse” argues, with more enthusiasm than coherence, for the integrity of a certain kind of old movie. Not the stuff that finds its way into the Classics section of the video store, but the kind that the guys behind the counter are always talking about: cheap, nasty slasher films, sleazy sexploitation pictures, gimcrack sci-fi epics starring people you never heard of. Just about anything, in short, with the right combination of topless women, gory, pointless violence and inspired amateurism. Also car chases. Really, though, what Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Tarantino try to evoke is less a particular style or genre of moviemaking than a lost ambience of moviegoing. “Grindhouse” consists of a double feature (“Death Proof” preceded by Mr. Rodriguez’s “Planet Terror”) accompanied by trailers for nonexistent coming attractions (with titles like “Machete” and “Werewolf Women of the SS”) and beset by technical difficulties. Each of the features is missing a reel —  the management apologizes for the inconvenience —  and of course it’s the reel with the sex in it, which the projectionist probably stole for his own amusement. The prints are full of scratches, bad splices and busted sprocket holes, and the images are not always in focus. It’s all a pretty good joke, especially since most of these glitches, artifacts of an earlier technological era, have been produced digitally. (Unfortunately the software application has not yet been developed that can simulate clouds of stale cigarette smoke in the projector beam, broken seats and sticky, smelly floors at your local multiplex.) The filmmakers are at once bad boys and grumpy old men, effortlessly adept at manipulating new-fangled gadgets even as they sigh over the way things  were in the good old days. Their approach is both broadly populist and fussily esoteric. It doesn’t take a cinephile to appreciate, say, the sight of Rose McGowan in skimpy go-go dancer get-up, or to be repulsed by the spectacle of zombies with melting, pustulant faces feasting on human flesh. But the obsessive crosshatching of allusion, spoof and homage that gives “Grindhouse” its texture is the product of a highly refined generational sensibility. Young people who see this movie —  in the spirit of the thing, they should ideally sneak in during school hours —  might do well to seek out a 45-year-old underemployed bachelor with a large DVD and comic book collection who can help them parse the basics (“What’s a reel, Uncle Quentin?”) and the more advanced material as well. That Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Tarantino are motivated by a sincere love of the movies they send up can hardly be doubted, but the affection is expressed in different ways. Mr. Rodriguez revels in badness for its own sake. “Planet Terror” is intoxicated by its own absurdity; it tries to raise incompetence to the level of craft, if not art. The random close-ups, the lurching cuts, the off-kilter framing —  all of this is obviously intentional. So is the hodgepodge story, which is like a stew made of the contents of every can in the cupboard. Ms. McGowan plays Cherry Darling, a hard-luck go-go dancer. She reunites with an old boyfriend (Freddy Rodriguez), who turns out to be a notorious gunslinger. They team up with a bunch of other townspeople  — we’re somewhere in Texas —  to fight off rampaging zombies (including Bruce Willis and Mr. Tarantino, who also has a small role in “Death Proof”). The zombies have been infected by a virus, and the only hope for a cure is. ... But that’s enough of that. Sensation trumps sense in “Planet Terror,” especially once Ms. McGowan, who has lost a leg in a car accident, has been outfitted with a machine-gun prosthesis. It’s certainly eye-catching, but “Planet Terror” is a joke that goes on for too long without much purpose beyond its own frantic inventiveness. Its sloppiness is a trait it shares not only with obscure horror movies (many of which were much more rigorously executed), but also with some of Mr. Rodriguez’s other films. His energy, in movies like “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” and the later “Spy Kids” installments, has often outstripped his taste. Not only does he like bad movies, he has a habit of making them too. Mr. Tarantino is another story — a connoisseur, a scholar and a bit of a highbrow. Not a snob though. Quite the opposite: He combs through trash in search of art and has done a lot to teach American audiences (and critics) to appreciate the formal seriousness and aesthetic sophistication of, for example, Asian action movies. “Death Proof” is in part a sincere tribute to the work of Monte Hellman, whose films have ascended from the fetor of their low-rent origins into the purer air of art houses and museum retrospectives, which is where they belong. Mr. Hellman was always a serious filmmaker, and Mr. Tarantino is too. At a certain point in “Death Proof” the scratches and bad splices disappear, and you find yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie. You are not laughing at deliberately clumsy camera work but rather admiring the grace and artistry of the shots —  in particular a long take in which the camera circles around a group of women talking in a diner. At his best —  in parts of “Pulp Fiction,” in “Jackie Brown,” in sections of “Kill Bill, Vol. 2” —  Mr. Tarantino strips away the quotation marks and finds a route through his formal virtuosity and his encyclopedic knowledge of film history back to the basics of character, action and story. “Death Proof” is a decidedly modest picture, fittingly enough given its second billing in this double feature. But its scaled-down ambition is part of its appeal. It consists of long stretches of talk —  the rambling, profane banter that is Mr. Tarantino’s hallmark as a writer —  interrupted by kinetic bouts of automotive mayhem. The verbal and visceral elements have no organic connection, and the plot is booby-trapped with surprises. I’m hesitant to risk giving away too much, but I will say that Kurt Russell is awfully good, and that I could listen to Sydney Tamiia Poitier and Tracie Thoms, two of the movie’s motor-mouthed heroines, talk through the whole three hours of “Grindhouse,” read the phone book or recite “The Faerie Queene” on tape in my Volvo in the middle of a traffic jam. I’m not sure I’d sit through “Planet Terror” again to get to them in “Death Proof” though. Of course, in the old days, true grindhouse devotees would wander in and out of the theater all day long. I guess DVD’s serve a similar function in our own time. In any case be sure not to miss the trailer for “Thanksgiving” —  not for the squeamish or the humor impaired, and not that you’d necessarily want to see the movie, if it existed. Also, when viewing “Grindhouse” at home skip the commentary track and bring in a few drunks off the street to mutter and snore. It’ll be just like the old days. “Grindhouse” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Tell your mother you were over at your friend’s house doing homework, and be sure to tell your friends at school about the severed limbs, the exploding heads and the naked you-know-whats.

The 1970s exploitation movie gropes, bites, kicks, slugs, blasts, smashes and cusses its way back to life in "Grindhouse," a "Rodriguez/Tarantino double feature" that lovingly resurrects a disreputable but cultishly embraced form of era-specific film production and exhibition. A pair of pictures devoted to re-creating their progenitors' grubby aesthetics and visceral kicks, but with vastly greater budgets, higher-end actors and a patina of hipster cool, they part company when it comes to talent and freshness. The numerous marketing problems for this bizarre pop-culture artifact begin with the three-hour-plus running time and young auds' unfamiliarity with the format. But the B.O. strength of "Sin City" and "Kill Bill" alone suggests the helmers' loyal followings will produce a very potent opening frame, with fairly steep fall-off thereafter in the manner of most horror films.
The United States may be the only territory, however, where the whole shebang will come out as one feature, as each picture will be released separately in slightly longer versions overseas.
As genre rehabs go, "Grindhouse" is more daring and audacious than most, partly due to its conception as an entire program complete with two pictures, four tailor-made trailers and various for-real interstitial bits, but more so because of its stylistic fidelity to its source material. Hollywood cinema, from "Jaws" and "Star Wars" onward, is filled with B-movie material served in A-picture bottles, but Robert Rodriguez's "Planet Terror" and Quentin Tarantino's "Death Proof" mean to reproduce the shot-on-the-run look and feel of genuinely down-and-dirty pics of 35 years ago, all the way to scratchy prints and missing scenes. One certain difference: Neither early George Romero nor the original "Gone in 60 Seconds" had seven-minute end credits scrolls listing things such as director's chef and greens gang bosses.
On the basis of sheer accuracy, Rodriguez's installment wins points for more exactly replicating the hollow, soul-sucking badness of many low-grade gore films, even as he raids Romero's great "Dead" cycle of zombie splatter epics. By contrast, Tarantino's road-rage opus so far exceeds almost anything made at the time in terms of dialogue and performance that it seems like a different beast, one half plotless gabfest, the other half insane car chase.
Presentation begins with an authentic, beat-up "Prevues of Coming Attractions" banner, which intros a hilarious trailer for a faux actioner called "Machete," about a mean Mexican hombre on a violent rampage on behalf of illegals. This is one cheapo picture that could do some business, and evidently Rodriguez, who helmed it, thinks so too, as he's already said he wants to expand it to feature-length.
Accompanied by the built-in sound of projector noise and terrible scratches on the print, "Planet Terror" focuses on a demoralized go-go dancer, Cherry (Rose McGowan), who gets more than she bargained for when she sets out late one night to change her life.
Due to some nasty business at a nearby military base, local residents are lurching around with pus-filled abscesses on their skin and unwholesome appetites. Human roadkill litters the highways and the hospital becomes overrun with disfigured and increasingly violent sickos.
Forced to deal with the crisis are some questionable but mostly attractive lowlifes, including Cherry's mysterious ex Wray (Freddy Rodriguez); a cop (Michael Biehn) who's heavily on Wray's case; feuding married medics (Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton) in a race to kill one another before the zombies get the chance; and a barbecue shack owner (Jeff Fahey) on the verge of perfecting a recipe.
Given the recent surfeit of zombie movies, and pretty good ones at that, it's simply not enough to re-create a highlights reel of favorite genre motifs. Rodriguez occasionally extricates himself from the muck with some genuine gross-out moments, beginning with an exchange over a bulging bag of testicles between Naveen Andrews and Bruce Willis, both in extended cameos.
But when all the generic filler of the episode has been forgotten, "Planet Terror" will still be remembered for one indelible iconographic sight, that of the scantily attired McGowan, her character having lost her right leg in the mayhem, striding back into action with her missing appendage replaced by machine gun. Needless to say, the weapon is put to excellent use in the Romero-inspired finale.
There is a measure of wit in some details -- McGowan's hair and makeup remain impeccable no matter the havoc around her -- and some of the thesps, notably the leading lady and Freddy Rodriguez, create something resembling characters in the one-dimensional circumstances. But with the majority of the running time devoted to overly familiar territory, "Planet Terror" delivers only momentary kicks.
An eight-minute "intermission" serves up tasty trailers for three more excellent candidates for exploitation immortality. "Werewolf Women of the SS," about "Hitler's plan to create a race of super-women," stars Udo Kier, Sybil Danning and "Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu," and is helmed with dead-on crudeness by Rob Zombie. "Don't," directed by Edgar Wright, trades hilariously on the enticing "Don't go in the ... " motif of horror-pic advertising, while "Thanksgiving," from Eli Roth, cooks up a startling and grisly holiday-themed gorefest.
All this is table setting for the main course, and while Tarantino's "Death Proof" is a juicy, delicious treat, its pleasures stem much less from the play with genre conventions than from great dialogue and electric performances. The chick-power movie is divided into two parts, both of which are exhilarating for the vibrant bonding and camaraderie they develop among two different sets of young women.
Opening scene simply puts three attractive femmes in a car riding down the main commercial drag in Austin, Texas, talking about sex and drugs. Much as the driving conversation between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in "Pulp Fiction" was captivating for its heightened naturalism and specific detail, so does the girl talk here instantly mesmerize through its casual frankness and relaxed humor; so natural are the rhythms of the banter that you instantly believe the women played by relative newcomers Sydney Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd are best buds, have no secrets and constantly kid one another about their peccadilloes.
A daytime meal eventually becomes a night of drinking at the funky Texas Chili Parlor. The level of raunch is amped up by booze but the talk remains great, with a touch of the poet at times. Tarantino here lays a claim to being the Joseph L. Mankiewicz of trash talk, so easily does he create reams of dialogue in distinct voices and so well does he direct it.
As boldly as in a late Howard Hawks film like "Hatari!" or "El Dorado," Tarantino confidently keeps his characters chattering away and lets about a third of the picture go by before anything much happens. Some guys (Roth, Michael Bacall and Omar Doom) try to hit on the girls, and eventually attention turns to the bar, where an older man named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) strikes up a conversation with slinky Pam (McGowan again, this time as a blonde).
A vet movie stuntman with an easy manner, Mike offers Pam a ride home in his mighty Dodge Charger, a stunt-ready vehicle so reinforced as to be "death-proof." But it doesn't turn out to be for Pam, as the Jekyll & Hyde-like Mike uses his car like a killing machine.
A second group of women take the baton for pic's ramped-up second half. Dominating these members of a Tennessee film crew on a break is foul-mouthed Kim (Tracie Thoms). Declaring that, "There's no point to living in America unless you drive a Dodge Challenger," fellow stuntwoman Zoe Bell (a New Zealander who was Uma Thurman's stunt double on "Kill Bill") gets her hands on one, turning the seg into a massive homage to the 1971 cult drive-in fave "Vanishing Point" as it sets itself up for an extended duel between the girls' Dodge and that of the now-maniacal Stuntman Mike.
With third wheel Abernathy (a game Rosario Dawson) along for the ride but the fourth pal (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sitting it out, Kim races behind, alongside and in front of Mike on twisty, hilly roads at breakneck speeds with Zoe, spread-eagled like a hood ornament up front. The hair-raising stunts are clearly absolutely real, making the sequence, among other things, a massive middle finger from Tarantino to the interventions of CGI.
Aspects of the chase, which was filmed in the Santa Ynez Valley above Santa Barbara, raise questions, notably as to why Kim doesn't apply the brakes at key moments when Mike is running alongside her. But the sequence is still a thrill, filled with loads of exciting shots filmed at high speed.
Bell is a relaxed, spirited natural playing herself, and Thoms and Dawson are both a gas. Russell is at his best shooting the breeze in the bar, but also gets off when Mike turns bad.
Tarantino capably serves as his own cinematographer for the first time, and the soundtrack brims with dynamite tunes. Production values throughout boast a deliberately degraded ruggedness.

I've got a theory about Grindhouse , and it goes like this: At some point during the brainstorming/beer-bonging process by which Robert Rodriguez  and Quentin Tarantino  developed their multimillion-dollar ersatz-exploitation double feature, the boys finished off the super nachos, sparked up a spliff, and said "Dude, let's just motherfucking bring it ." From whence proceeded a checklist of must-haves: zombie hordes and one-legged go-go dancers, hot rods and hot pants, evil doctors and exploding pustules, trash-talking identical-twin babysitters, castration, decapitation, dismemberment, diminutive Mexican badasses, customized motorcycles, Kurt Russell , Osama bin Laden , Fu Manchu, tasty sausage, jive-ass stuntwomen, outrageous car wrecks, buckets of blood, geysers of gore, mountains of weaponry, explosions bigger than God (Tarantino: "How big?" Rodriguez: "Retarded big")and of course titties, lots and lots of titties.
From first rude frame to lascivious last, Grindhouse guns to be the last word in fanboy fetishism. Not only does it monkey around with degenerate genres (splatter films, bad-girl flicks, John Carpenter  cheapies, car-chase extravaganzas), it apes the condition of crummy old prints. Convulsed in phony glitchesscratches, scuffs, projector hiccups, soured film stock, missing reelsit's a digitally enhanced homage to analogue grime that unspools like a Guy Maddin  spectacular supercharged to the Weinstein account. There may not be any house left to grind in New York, skuzzy little theaters having gone the way of subway tokens, smoking in bars, and, you know, fun . But as nostalgia trips go, at least this one goes all the way. You can practically taste the mold and smell the celluloid.
The house that Rodriguez and Tarantino built is constructed on two levels. In Planet Terror , a deliciously repellent zombie apocalypse (of love), Rodriguez busts his nut in every direction, showering the screen with icky globs of glorious nonsense. The convenient thing about riffing on grindhouse is that it gives you a license to thrill at will; casual plotting, randomly generated protagonists, spectacle for its own sake, and questionable ethics come with the territory. That plays well to Rodriguez's strengths (sight gags, Grand Guignol) and weaknesses (patience, coherence) as he mounts a hilariously haphazard scenario pitting a clutch of the non-infected (Rose McGowan , Freddy Rodriguez , Marley Shelton , Michael Biehn ) against the peckish undead (makeup effects by Greg Nicotero ).
Where Rodriguez does grindhouse more or less straight up, Tarantino takes greater license with Death Proof which is to say the tradition he's elaborating on is the Tarantino Movie. Only tangentially related to the vehicular-mayhem genre (Vanishing Point  is name-checked repeatedly), this sneaky contraption is booby-trapped with twisty talk, structural shocks, berserkoid set pieces, and unabashed foot fetishism. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike , a genial psychopath with a thing for running down babes in his customized Dodge Charger . His targets include Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier ), Zoë (Uma's Kill Bill stunt double, Zoë Bell ), Abernathy (radiant Rosario Dawson ), and the inevitable Tough Black Chick (Tracie Thoms  as Kim). Her incurable case of Tarantino-style Tourette's"bitch" this, "mothafucka" that, nonstop "nigga pleez "strikes what may be the only truly gratuitous note in this ostensible exploitation epic.
Given a climate where major studios cash in on the most fucked-up shit imaginable (a remake of The Last House on the Left  is in the works), there's not much ante for Grindhouse  to up. The vibe, in any event, is more convivial than confrontationalthe blockbuster as block party. Tarantino is a big supporter of the neo-exploitation crowd (two of whose luminaries, Eli Roth  and Rob Zombie , contribute ingenious trailers for imaginary films alongside Edgar Wright  and Rodriguez), but his own sensibility is sweeter. Death Proof expends most of its energy on boozy barroom camaraderie and baroque restaurant chitchat. Even the villain is rather a dear; Tarantino clearly relishes his rehabilitation of Russell (here giving a charmed, witty performance), on whom he lavishes as much affection as his girls gone wild. And wild they go, pedal to the metal, brandishing iron poles, turning the tables on Stuntman Mike in a giddy automotive assault that climaxes with the finest syncopation since Before Sunset .
So yeah, it's a gas, from first frame to last and by the time you exit this slobbering behemoth, you'll have taken in a quarter-million of them. This monumentally pointless movie is best summarized by a line from Planet Terror : "At some point in your life, you find a use for every useless talent you have." Rodriguez, Tarantino, and Co. aim for nothing more noble than to freak the funk, and it's about goddamn time. Go wasted, go stoned, go without your parents' permission. In paying homage to an obsolete form of movie culture, Grindhouse delivers a dropkick to ours.
