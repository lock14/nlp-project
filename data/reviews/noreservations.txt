Aussie director Hicks helmed the 1996 Oscar-winning meltdown-melodrama Shine
 and hasn't yet recaptured the dotty brilliance of that film (Geoffrey Rush had much to do with it). No Reservations
, a nearly note-perfect remake of Sandra Nettelbeck's 2001 German import, doesn't erase the memory of Hicks' odd turn directing the William Goldman-adapted Stephen King misfire Hearts in Atlantis
, nor does it come within striking distance, emotionally, of Nettlebeck's original, but that may have more to do with the culturally fraught experience of watching a tautly Teutonic, perfectionist German foodie defrost than any directorial malaise on Hicks' part. Hollywood is and forever has been rife with films about obsessive Americans unraveling for the better in the face of love and death; it's almost always more interesting, if not educational, to view the subject from across the pond, at a safe remove. In Mostly Martha
, it turned out those frosty Germans were all gooey on the inside. With No Reservations
, it turns out that so is Zeta-Jones, who here plays Kate, the chef at a tony Manhattan restaurant owned by Six Feet Under
 alumna Clarkson. She's more brio than Brie, this implacable, tempestuous go-getter, so much so that she's been ordered to see a psychiatrist (Balaban) by her boss. As in the original, fate conspires to free this chef from her self-imposed kitchen exile by placing her sister's suddenly orphaned child (Breslin) into her discomfort zone and then, as if that weren't enough to teach one the joys of letting one's angel-hair pasta down, inserting gustatory hunk Eckhart into her beloved kitchen. Eckhart, as incoming kinda-sorta-sous chef Nick, grins way too much for my taste, frankly (the bad aftertaste of In the Company of Men
 still gnaws at me, though this Nick is neither rat nor R�my), but he does begin to work in tandem with Kate's niece to free up her range, as well as teach her the real meaning of food-love. No Reservations
 succeeds as well as it does (kinda sorta) by virtue of Zeta-Jones' performance; she thaws deliciously, despite Eckhart's toothiness, and while No Reservations
 is no Big Night
 (or Mostly Martha
 for that matter), it's also surprisingly winsome in parts, a romantic fable that lingers on the palette of the mind's eye, not despite its familiarity but because of it.


Do the ingredients have to be fresh for a meal to taste good? In haute cuisine, yes; in movies, not so much. "No Reservations," starring Catherine Zeta-Jones as a persnickety New York chef, makes a corned beef hash out of "Mostly Martha," the much-loved 2001 German film from which it has been Hollywoodized. Nor is there anything here you haven't seen in umpteen other romantic comedies, with or without the saffron sauce.
So cynics, restaurant critics, and lovers of foreign-language originals need not apply. Date-night guys will be left craving hamburger, too. The movie's pleasant and light, though, and its emotional crises are the crust on an acceptably edible crème brulee. The most appreciative audience will probably be moms towing young teenage girls whose foodie tastebuds have been awakened by "Ratatouille." And that's fine; let them chow down.
Zeta-Jones plays Kate Armstrong, the tightly wound star chef at a chic Greenwich Village restaurant. "Life is unpredictable," says her therapist (Bob Balaban, wearing an odd blond frizz), to which Kate snorts, "Not in my kitchen." In case you didn't get that the character's an emotional iceberg, she regularly retreats to the restaurant's walk-in freezer for downtime.
Two developments bring about a thaw. Kate's sister (Arija Bareikis) dies in a car accident, leaving a tweenage daughter named Zoe (Abigail Breslin) in the heroine's unprepared care. While she's out coping, restaurant owner Patricia Clarkson (acerbic and slender as a champagne flute) hires a sous chef to run the kitchen. He is Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart), a stubbled surfer dude who likes to blast opera while he works. Kate's tocque visibly stiffens at their first meeting.
Nick's the perfect man, of course -- no chick flick is without one -- so Kate's resistance becomes the stuff of cute comedy. (The rocky relationship with Zoe is there to remind us life can be serious, too.) Some of Scott Hicks's filmmaking ideas are shockingly unoriginal (a frolic-in-the-city montage, compete with photo booth outtakes? In 2007?) and screenwriter Carol Fuchs's dialogue has the unfortunate habit of reviewing itself. Lines like "There's no greater sin than to overcook a quail" and "I can't help it if your reduction is a little thin" reflect too uneasily on the dangers of remaking art-house fare for mass consumption.
The script also has no real idea what to do with the character of Zoe, supposedly 11 but written as if she's much younger. Breslin, so natural in "Little Miss Sunshine," never finds a way into the role and remains stuck in neutral, watching the grown-ups from the sidelines. That's easy enough to do: Zeta-Jones and Eckhart are both incredibly attractive, and they're both pros, so Kate and Nick's courtship rituals are as tasty to witness as they're calorie-free.
Where "No Reservations" mostly clicks is in its depiction of a fairy-tale West Village, gritty but benign and pocked with eccentric ethnic types bearing truffles and golden tilefish to the circular trills of Philip Glass's score. The hectic camaraderie of Kate's work environment is conveyed well, too, with tart performances by Jenny Wade as a pregnant assistant chef and Lily Rabe (Jill Clayburgh's daughter) as an erotically inclined waitress. Why she and Nick aren't rutting in the cabbages out back is something of a mystery.
Those scenes lack the edge of a real restaurant, though -- the sense that a well-functioning kitchen is always one overseared scallop away from total disaster. Despite the tears and kisses and arias bursting forth on the soundtrack, "No Reservations" remains as decorous as a magazine spread. No eggs get broken, all the soufflés rise on time, and no one ever has to do the dishes.


         In the poster for the new Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle, "No Reservations," the actress and her charismatic costar Aaron Eckhart are shown standing hip to hip in a restaurant kitchen, stirring up something saucy while flashing their dazzling smiles at each other. Anybody tempted by this image to go see the film would be advised to spend an evening with the promotional materials instead, because Zeta-Jones' sparkling chompers aren't much in evidence in the theater.
 
 In their stead we get Exhibits H through P in the ongoing case against Professional Lady, whose talent and success can only exist in inverse proportion to her personal happiness. Eventually, she'll find out what life is all about, but only after a man and child forcibly enter her life.
 


         






   Directed by Scott Hicks ("Shine") and written by Carol Fuchs, "No Reservations" (no relation, incidentally, to the Anthony Bourdain show) is based on the considerably more charming German film "Mostly Martha," in which a German chef spars with, then falls for, an Italian sous-chef while coping with caring for her young niece, whose mother has been killed in a car accident. The American remake gives us Zeta-Jones as the angry professional lady, a top chef so compactly repressed that when she squeezes out a tear after her sister is killed it looks like she's just extruding moisture; Eckhart as the exuberant epicure who reintroduces her to her senses in both senses  of the word; and Abigail Breslin as the adorable child who brings them together.
 
 Among the movie's chief flaws is that Zeta-Jones is entirely unconvincing as a chef, an American and a human being. Whether she's storming out of the kitchen to attack customers who send back her food, regaling her exposition-enabling but otherwise pointless therapist (Bob Balaban) with disquisitions on food preparation and elaborately prepared meals, or serving her young niece a nice dinner of roasted fish with the head still attached, she seems awkward, Welsh and robotic.
 
 When the baby-sitting agency sends over a chain-smoking goth chick with a nose ring and a bad attitude, for instance, Kate shrugs and leaves the apartment. When the baby-sitter leaves the kid alone before Kate returns from work, she barely bats an eye. If, at this point in the story, we were to learn that her skin rolls back to reveal green scales, her character's credibility would increase exponentially. As it is, "E.T." seems to have had a far firmer grip on our terrestrial ways than Kate does.
 
 When Kate's sous-chef Leah (Jenny Wade) goes on maternity leave, restaurant owner Paula (Patricia Clarkson) is forced to hire a replacement without Kate's approval. She brings in Nick (Eckhart), an Italian chef with stellar credentials that mean nothing to Kate. The man is unforgivably ebullient -- he blasts "Turandot" and makes jokes in the kitchen, and she hates him on sight.
 
 Sooner or later, we know, the polar cap that is Kate's heart must begin its inevitable thaw, and Nick's attentions are just the gassy emissions required to kick off the melting process. But Zeta-Jones' strangely hemmed-in performance, not to mention her utter lack of chemistry with Eckhart (or Breslin, for that matter) and inability to infuse a line like "I was so afraid that something had happened to you" with even a scrap of the sense that she gives a rat's fig, make watching it happen pretty joyless.
 
 "No Reservations" is one of those movies that presents life precisely and meticulously as it isn't, presumably as some kind of consolation for how it really is. With its simplistic compartmentalization of dueling personality types, kindergarten view of grown-up love, exquisite styling, overripe camera moves and lousy, overwrought score, the movie feels stubbornly, resolutely disingenuous and one-dimensional. Everything in it is
designed to make you feel better, so why does it feel artificial and palliative in that really depressing way?
 
 
 "No Reservations." MPAA rating: PG for some sensuality and language. Running time: 1 hour, 41 minutes. In wide release.   

No Reservations  has the dicey luck to arrive in a summer that has gotten a head start on celebrating the arcane choreography of restaurant cooking with Ratatouille . So this particular salute is a second seating. Well, not to assume the role of the sniffing critic in that great Pixar pic and get all Anton Ego or anything, but the following are missing from this aspirational chick flick that adds a grating of food = sex = soul to the mix: (1) an animated rat; (2) any spice; and (3) any aroma of joy.
The substitute ingredients are (1) Catherine Zeta-Jones as Kate, a great chef (she's single and lives in a fabulous brownstone in New York City) who happens to like life very orderly, controlled, and finely minced; (2) Aaron Eckhart as Nick, a great chef (he's single and lives in a fabulous loft in New York City) who happens to like life very loose, spontaneous, and stirred up; and (3) Little Miss Sunshine 's Abigail Breslin as Kate's 9-year-old niece, Zoe, who unexpectedly comes under her aunt's less-than-nurturing wing as if recycled from Baby Boom , the opportunistic 1987 comeuppance for yuppie women who dare to want it all, starring Diane Keaton. Kate runs the kitchen at an upscale West Village restaurant (a soignée Patricia Clarkson plays owner and manager) with precision and intensity of purpose. Nick, who shows up to fill in as sous-chef, likes to crack jokes, sing along to opera while he sautés, and wave an uncooked quail in the air for musical emphasis. Zoe looks sad when her aunt serves her fancy duck dishes at home for dinner, since all the kid wants is a hug and a fish stick. (Breslin quietly centers the movie with her gentle seriousness.)
If you don't instantly recognize that bickering Kate and Nick are eventually going to want to fork each other  and that Nick will teach Kate how to become a warmer, softer woman capable of relating to others who are not, say, fishmongers  then you have never read a recipe book or a romance novel.
A familiar dish doesn't have to be a bland one, but No Reservations , which has been Americanized from the 2002 German romantic comedy Mostly Martha  with a script by first-timer Carol Fuchs and impersonal direction from Scott Hicks (Shine ), doesn't allow for the slightest grain of salt. Or pepper, beginning with Zeta-Jones' tense performance as a '' regular''  New York woman who dresses in a palette of gloom and wears a hat borrowed from Mary Tyler Moore. It's fun to see the glamorous actress turn down her movie-star flame, but it's a pity she's stuck with so many trite gestures on Kate's journey to fulfillment. The all-work, no-play professionally successful female character who comes home to her empty apartment, presses the button on her answering machine (as if she can't read the LED counter), and hears the accusatory refrain '' No messages''  is the creation of moviemakers with no new ideas about what to make for dinner.

If you’ve seen the commercials and trailers for “No Reservations,” you’re probably anticipating a glossy, goofy romance between a tightly-wound head chef named Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her new sous-chef, Nick (Aaron Eckhart), a rugged blond life force. Faithfully adapted from the German filmmaker Sandra Nettelbeck’s 2001 feature “Mostly Martha,” the movie provides these stock elements and many others,  including a wisecracking preteenage girl (Abigail Breslin of “Little Miss Sunshine”), lyrical montages  and too-cute therapy scenes (with Bob Balaban as the shrink) that play like unsubtle attempts to fill in the taciturn heroine’s past. What’s unexpected and gratifying, though, is the film’s enlightened attitude toward parenthood and work, which the movie’s publicity campaign conspicuously glosses over, even though it’s the story’s driving force. Ms. Breslin’s character, Zoe, is Kate’s smart, tough, 9-year-old niece, whose mother — Kate’s sister  — dies in a car wreck. Kate,  who has indefinitely deferred marriage and children to pursue her career and rarely regrets the decision,  is torn between the necessity of maintaining her workaholic lifestyle and her obligation to raise Zoe, whose father skedaddled before she was born. Modern Hollywood movies often genuflect toward feminism while implying that a woman isn’t truly a woman until she has gratefully surrendered to motherhood. While watching “No Reservations” you keep waiting for the other high-heeled shoe to drop,  but it never really does. The director, Scott Hicks (“Shine”), and  the screenwriter, Carol Fuchs, respect Kate’s ambition, skill and drive. Throughout, they imply that Kate’s biggest hurdle isn’t a lack of aptitude for motherhood but her credulous acceptance of society’s one-size-fits-all definition of good parents. It isn’t easy for Kate to process her sister’s death — she returns to work too quickly, and won’t take time off until her boss (Patricia Clarkson) orders it — and the challenge of mothering Zoe is even more daunting. Yet the film dares to present Kate’s stumblebum early efforts — subcontracting child care to a chain-smoking goth babysitter, then to a flirty single-dad neighbor (a charming and woefully underused Brian F. O’Byrne) — as proof not that she needs to quit her job, but that she’s fallen for the false dichotomy of work  versus parenting. Kate’s professional, domestic and romantic lives begin to merge satisfyingly when she invites Zoe to hang out in the restaurant’s kitchen. When Kate finally warms up to her subordinate and potential rival, Nick — who was hired by Paula while Kate was off grieving for her sister — it’s because Nick demonstrates an effortless ability to relate to Zoe while never losing touch with his defining identity as a chef. Nick’s middle-class rebel persona is a tad precious. He blasts opera while directing the kitchen staff and boasts that he never went to cooking school but learned the basics in a rural Italian restaurant he encountered while backpacking across Europe. At the same time, though, his boyish exuberance marks him as a potentially great dad, and his “Song of Myself” confidence makes him oblivious to the doubts that plague Kate. Nick sees nothing wrong with building his relationship with Zoe around the fine art of cooking. His instinctive tendency to overlap work and parenthood gives Kate permission to do the same. Make no mistake: “No Reservations” is a factory-sealed romantic comedy. It embraces dark emotions in early scenes showing Kate and Zoe’s grief, then moves on quickly, perhaps out of fear that viewers will deem  it a downer. There’s never any doubt that Nick has Kate and Zoe’s best interests at heart, or that they all will find happiness on its own sweet terms. But the emotional details of Kate, Nick and Zoe’s journey are surprising, honest and life-size, and the film’s determination to present their predicament sympathetically, without appealing to retrograde ideals of femininity and motherhood, makes it notable, and in some ways unique. “No Reservations” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some sensuality and language.

The summer's foodie mini-genre continues with "No Reservations," in which the wizard in the kitchen is not a rat but Catherine Zeta-Jones as an uber-chef made to see there's more to life than foie gras and black truffles. Agreeably prepared and attractively presented, this remake of the tasty 2001 German feature "Mostly Martha" bears too many earmarks of Hollywood packaging and emotional button-pushing, but doesn't go far wrong by closely sticking to the original's smart story construction. Warner Bros. should generate decent upscale-leaning biz by appealing to legions of food show fanatics and women ill-served by dominant hot-weather blockbusters.
Existing in that seductive version of New York most often associated with Woody Allen films and assorted romantic comedies -- the Gotham in which everyone lives in elegant apartments and dines at fabulously chic restaurants -- "No Reservations" is mostly set in one of those restaurants, 22 Bleecker, a fictive establishment at the very real corner of Bleecker and Charles in the West Village. Perennially packed eatery is fronted by savvy owner Paula (Patricia Clarkson), but the star here is Kate (Zeta-Jones), an obsessive kitchen diva who would no doubt happily reside at her workplace were it not prevented by city ordinance.
A perfectionist who cuts her hard-working staff no slack and thinks nothing of telling the occasional complaining customer where he can go, Kate is not a people person and would seem to need to get a life, from a conventional point of view. Well-rounded she isn't, but there's something so admirable about her demanding nature and professional self-realization that one partly doesn't want to see her bend to normalcy and accommodate others, even though it's obvious that's where this story is headed. When she tells her therapist she has no idea why she's seeing him, her utter befuddlement becomes a touchstone of her paradoxical charm.
Left to her own devices, she almost certainly wouldn't change. But fate delivers a low blow when Kate's sister is killed in a car accident, leaving her young daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin, "Little Miss Sunshine") nowhere to go but to Aunt Kate's. (Perhaps the biggest change from the original is that the father's identity this time isn't even known.) The brittle, all-business grown-up has no clue how to relate to a 10-year-old, much less how to console her, and so at first carries on as usual after dropping her at a new school and hiring suspect babysitters.
Stress finally demands a break, and while Kate takes a little time off, Paula brings a new face into the kitchen, the goofy but good-looking Nick (Aaron Eckhart), a cut-up who overnight changes the kitchen's ambiance from that of an army operations h.q. to backstage at the opera. Flamboyant, flirtatious and talented enough to get away with his pranks, Nick has made his rep in Italian cooking (character in the original film was an Italian chef working in Germany), and it's only with grudging resentment that Kate permits him to stay upon her return.
Once the story dynamic is set up, virtually nothing of any consequence happens that doesn't have its roots in food. Kate soon brings Zoe to work, where the girl begins learning some basics and, having turned up her nose at her aunt's fussy dishes, warms to the simple pastas calculatingly thrown together by Nick. And when Zoe schemes to have Nick over to prepare a feast for the three of them, Nick knows the key to Kate's heart lies in her stomach.
If, indeed, Kate is prepared to let any man into her life, it's clear early on -- and certainly to Zoe -- that Nick's the one, but some customary romantic comedy obstacles must be negotiated first. Hewing closely to the "Mostly Martha" script by writer-director Sandra Nettelbeck, first-time scenarist Carol Fuchs keeps the dicey dynamics credible among the central characters, although once Kate begins softening up, she drops some thudding dialogue bombs ("I wish there were a cookbook for life").
Similarly, director Scott Hicks' work cuts both ways, creating a warm cocoon that fosters engagement with the well-drawn characters while at the same time steering the material in softer-than-necessary directions and refraining from peeking any deeper into the main characters to suggest what makes them tick. Without question, "Ratatouille" deals more profoundly with the personality makeup and urges of a driven chef-as-artist than does this genial divertissement.
All the same, Zeta-Jones is in her element as a formidable woman one messes with, professionally and personally, only at one's peril. Dominating the kitchen like a field commander, her Kate may have stringently repressed desires and emotional frustrations she refuses to confront but, then again, she may not, and imagining that the latter is the case constitutes her greatest appeal. And, yes, she looks pretty darn good in her tight-fitting work uniform.
The lanky, exuberant Eckhart might seem an odd match for his co-star's cool, dark beauty, but this mostly works to the film's benefit; thesp makes Nick's quirkiness winning rather than grating as he stealthily charms Zoe while restraining himself with Kate. Breslin again shows she's got the right stuff by playing a bereaved kid without asking for sympathy.
Lustrous production values make the world of the film a lovely place to visit, and if 22 Bleecker actually existed, it would be months before you could get a reservation.

In this by-the-recipe remake of 2001's German chocolate cake Mostly Martha , Catherine Zeta-Jones  plays Kate, a top chef in New York City who rules her kitchen with a cast-iron fist. She wants to be alone, so, of course, her perfectly unencumbered existence is thrown into chaos with the death of her sister, who has willed to Kate her perfectly precocious nine-year-old niece Zoe, played by Abigail Breslin . At first, naturally, theirs is an uneasy relationshiprelative stranger living with relative stranger, neither of whom wants the other around. Then Kate decides to start taking Zoe to the restaurantwhere she discovers in her sacred space a new chef named Nick, played by Aaron Eckhart , whose tousled bangs hang so low you're amazed he can see what he's cooking. The guy's so sweet it's astounding he  isn't shot in soft focus; Nick won't take Kate's gig, despite their boss's desires, only everything else she's gother heart and the kid too. The cynic would like to write this off as empty grown-up hooey, Baby Boom  without an ounce of bang. But you can't do it, because the thing's so charming and frothy and delightful and sentimental and beautifully shot and well-acted and sincere that it takes a good couple of hours before you start craving real nourishment, and during this disheartening season of overheated air-conditioned diversions, that passes for an unparalleled feat of artistic achievement.
