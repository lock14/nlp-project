Oz (also known as the voice of Yoda, Miss Piggy, and
 Fozzie Bear) began his directing career with the not-really-for-kids kids� classic The Dark Crystal
 and over the years has successfully turned out bizarre camp (Little Shop of Horrors
), classic comedy (What About Bob?
), and brilliant satire (Bowfinger
). Here he is again, tackling British farce. Take one rolling country house, insert one big extended family, add a touch of personal tragedy, a bit of resentment, and a generous portion of dysfunction. Stir well. The result is Death at a Funeral
, a comedy that�s refreshing in its courage to embrace tradition and just have fun. The film spans the course of a single afternoon, during a funeral where everything that can go wrong, does. Macfadyen appears pastier and puffier than the dashing Mr. Darcy he played in Pride and Prejudice
. And it works because this time around he�s Daniel, the neurotic son who stayed home, attending to his aging parents while his successful novelist brother (Graves) went off to New York. Daniel�s years of pent-up frustration grow as he learns his brother won�t be ponying up his half of the funeral costs. But that�s just the beginning. As each guest arrives, troubles mount. Daniel�s resentful mother (Asher) continues to drop not-so-subtle jabs at Daniel�s wife (Hawes). Howard (Nyman) must tend to the ultimate in grumpy old men, Uncle Alfie (Vaughan), while indulging his growing hypochondria. Troy (Marshall) merely sees the funeral as a pit stop on the way to sell his latest pharmaceutical concoction. Meanwhile, his sister, Martha (Donovan), drags her milquetoast fianc� (Tudyk) to the service only to accidentally calm his nerves with some of her brother�s homemade LSD. Tudyk (Serenity
) is hilarious as the mild-mannered Brit sent on a psychedelic journey. Then there�s Peter (Dinklage), the mysterious guest who turns out to be closer to the deceased than anyone would have guessed. It�s comedy in the good old-fashioned sense: pure farce served straight up. Smartly conceived and executed, the jokes arrive with some cheap shots, but Oz (and Dean Craig�s script) takes everything one step further. And just when you think things can�t quite get any crazier, they do. Though everyone�s problems get resolved too easily, it�s a fun ride nonetheless. And it�s clear that Oz still has plenty of comedic venom to go around.


Why did Hollywood director Frank Oz cross the Atlantic to make "Death at a Funeral"? Because he knows that a comedy of embarrassment works better when those being mortified are British. The class rigidity, the earnestness, the accents -- all seize up with more interesting complications. The clichéd English urge to not make a fuss
 is so much easier to discombobulate than our broad, dull American certainty. (The Danes, meanwhile, turn the genre into agonized psychodrama -- to each their national metier.)
"Death at a Funeral" opens with a minor mishap -- the wrong body delivered to an at-home wake -- but the movie keeps piling on the disasters until every last lovely person has come unglued. As farces go, it's on the strained side, but the point is we don't get many farces these days, so finding one is like sighting a rare sort of booby. And when this booby takes flight, it's something to see.
About the only character not reduced to a hot lump of chagrin by the end is the deceased himself, the paterfamilias of a middle-sized, upper-middle-class clan. He has two surviving sons, one dutiful, one prodigal. The former is Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen), married to Jane (Keeley Hawes) and desperate to buy a house and at last begin life away from his parents. The latter is Robert (Rupert Graves), a celebrated writer and Manhattanite who left Daniel holding the bag during their father's final years.
So there's plenty of resentment already boiling, to which the dead man's widow (Jane Asher) remains breezily ignorant. She's also in the dark about an aspect of her late husband's life that a mysterious, diminutive American visitor to the funeral (Peter Dinklage, of "The Station Agent") would like to make plain to the sons. And perhaps get paid for his trouble.
Fold in a cousin (Daisy Donovan) whose uptight fiance (Alan Tudyk) accidentally ingests the designer drugs her brother (Kris Marshall) has cooked up, a crotchety uncle (Peter Vaughan) with bowel problems, a hypochondriac (Andy Nyman), and a boor (Ewen Bremner). Stir, then simmer -- the recipe for these things is straightforward enough.
"Death at a Funeral" lets the pot sit for too long, though, and Macfadyen makes Daniel a sympathetic but bland hero. We find ourselves hoping Oz and his writer, Dean Craig, will circle back to the wildly tripping 
fiance, who the American comic actor Tudyk (Katherine Heigl's boss in "Knocked Up") plays with inventive glee. Donovan is fun, too, as the brusque girlfriend trying to reel him in off the roof -- he's naked by now, of course -- while coping with a disapproving papa (Peter Egan) and Bremner's persistent, lovelorn lout.
The laughs in a comedy of embarrassment arise as the characters desperately stuff jack-in-the-boxes back in their boxes while pretending nothing's wrong. Eventually all the lies collapse with a crash and everyone stands there with trousers down; that's the payoff, and Oz has made it work before in modest pleasures like "Bowfinger" and "In & Out."
"Death at a Funeral" isn't up to their level, but it's close enough, and it's certainly painless -- for us, at least. After a bit of a mid-movie muddle, the film finds its prime jack in Dinklage, whose size is ruthlessly exploited for laughs and whose character deserves whatever he gets. "Death" builds slowly and inexorably to a comic explosion that's just too good -- too insanely, impossibly mortifying -- to spoil here. Let's just say it dwarfs everything that has come before it.


A mysterious guest (Peter Dinklage) with a secret rattles an already dysfunctional clan at a memorial service for the family patriarch. (Perhaps in homage to the funnier The Wrong Box , undertakers first bring...the wrong box.) By the end of Death at a Funeral 's effortful farce about busted British propriety, you may feel that peculiar facial ache that comes from wishing to laugh with no really satisfying release. Working with a broad script by Dean Craig, director Frank Oz goes for American-style physicality, marching his players around a country house in which a toilet, alas, plays a big part.

 There’s no dearth of rude humor on screens right now, but “Death at a Funeral” stands apart because its characters — mostly reserved upper-middle-class British folk who have gathered to bury a patriarch — are determined to keep a stiff upper lip no matter what. That’s no small feat when one of the mourners has ingested a psychedelic drug and another is secretly holding a would-be blackmailer hostage in a room mere meters from where the body lies in state.  “Death” is the latest feature from the Muppeteer turned farceur Frank Oz. Although his directorial track record is spotty (he made the near-classics “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “Bowfinger,” as well as the tedious remake of “The Stepford Wives”), he has a knack for peppering safe commercial projects with ecstatically deranged situations.  There’s nothing in “Death” that tops the craziest sight gag in “Bowfinger”: a dog in pumps ambling through a parking garage. But Dean Craig’s screenplay offers at least six moments that come close, and it’s hard to describe them without ruining their impact. Suffice it to say Mr. Oz stages them with such wicked glee that they eclipse the movie’s problematic aspects (more about those in a moment) and its reflexive, mostly regrettable attempts to add “heart,” an organ that should be banned from farce unless the director intends to jam a steak knife through it.  Heart is represented by the movie’s hero, Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen of “Pride and Prejudice”), a super-responsible sad sack who arranged his father’s funeral. Daniel is a would-be writer who has promised his wife (Keeley Hawes) that they’ll move out of mom’s house one day. He’s terrified of delivering a eulogy in the presence of his brother, Robert (Rupert Graves), a pampered hotshot novelist who has flown in first class from New York yet pleads poverty when asked to cover his half of the funeral expenses. Daniel must also juggle the emotional demands of myopic, squabbling guests and the anxiety of an overscheduled reverend (Thomas Wheatley) whose timetable is thrown out of whack when the deceased’s body — well, I won’t spoil that gag, because it’s one of the six.  There’s no doubt that Daniel will steel himself, restore gravity to the event and deliver a stirring valediction. But Mr. Oz and Mr. Craig don’t go easy on him. The strait-laced Simon (Alan Tudyk) is frightened to be in the same room as his potential father-in-law (Peter Egan), so his fiancée, Daniel’s cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan), filches him a Valium belonging to her brother, Troy (Kris Marshall). Unfortunately for Simon, Troy is a freelance drug chemist, and that Valium is actually an illegal experimental hallucinogen; over the course of the film, Simon (played with phenomenal focus by Mr. Tudyk) goes from stoner bliss to cokehead paranoia to clothes-rending madness and eventually ends up — oops, sorry; that’s another one of the six.  The cast of characters also includes the dead man’s widow (Jane Asher), whose seemingly vast reserves of patience slowly evaporate; a family acquaintance named Justin (Ewen Bremner), who tagged along hoping to steal Martha’s heart; and Daniel’s best friend, Howard (the scene-stealing fussbudget Andy Nyman), a germophobe assigned to accompany Daniel’s cantankerous, wheelchair-using Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan), who is therefore guaranteed to wind up on the receiving end of the nastiest of Mr. Oz’s six sensational gags.  The most striking guest is a mysterious dwarf named Peter (Peter Dinklage, natch) who shows up uninvited, reveals a secret, demands a share of the family fortune and spends much of the film hogtied and abused. Peter’s short stature and homosexuality are presented as an obvious (albeit comic) source of menace, and the script — which goes out of its way to make every other character at least fitfully endearing — never treats him as anything but a ridiculous inconvenience.  Farces aren’t supposed to be polite, but Peter’s treatment feels singularly cheap. It takes an infamous, sardonic Randy Newman lyric at face value: “Don’t want no short people ’round here.”  “Death at a Funeral” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for profanity, nudity, drug use and an excremental sight gag.

With a circus parade of mourning Brits and enough appalling circumstances to set proper Englishness back to the Dark Ages, "Death at a Funeral" pits decorum against sex, drugs and dysfunction. The winners? Auds who know you laugh hardest when you're not supposed to, and who appreciate the humorous qualities of embarrassment, blackmail and the twitting of the upper classes. Box office will likely be modest, but reaction will be strongly positive.
Frank Oz's first feature since his "Stepford Wives" remake stars Matthew Macfadyen ("Pride & Prejudice") as Daniel, the type of Brit who can't decide whether to mourn his father or be embarrassed -- death, after all, is such an inconvenience for everyone.
Daniel is indecisive by nature: He's promised his wife (Keeley Hawes) that they'll soon move out of his mother's (Jane Asher) house, and that he'll finish his years-in-the-writing novel. But it looks doubtful.
When the undertakers bring the wrong body to the house, Daniel nearly expects it, since the whole affair is shaping up to be a disaster. Not helping matters is his brother, Robert (Rupert Graves), a successful novelist who was born to drive Daniel mad with envy.As it turns out, Robert is the least of Daniel's problems. Soon he finds himself with a second body to dispose of, while his mother grows impatient with being cheated out of the dramatic spotlight.
Depending on one's tolerance for matters scatological, "Death" may go a bit over the top, with Oz betraying an American gift for comic extremism. That said, the two central riffs are wonderfully played: In one, the painfully conservative Simon (Alan Tudyk), fiance of Daniel's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan), accidentally ingests a powerful hallucinogen created by Martha's brother, Troy (Kris Marshall). This turns Simon into a trouser-dropping lunatic guaranteed not to win approval from Martha's already disapproving father, Victor (Peter Egan).
The other subplot involves a mysterious, diminutive fellow (Peter Dinklage) who arrives with a secret about Daniel and Robert's father. This secret might distract from the funeral entirely, if Simon weren't already naked on the roof.
The tension in "Death at a Funeral" is between good manners and good comedy, something Oz exploits throughout. Humor has a decided British accent, given that it's all about making genteel people cringe; one can hardly imagine the same movie set in Brooklyn, for instance, unless it were a docudrama.
Among the standout performers are Donovan, whose Martha has the intriguing capacity to stress out about an ungenerous father and a raving fiance at the same time. Macfadyen is also quite good as the stalwart husband whose promises to his wife are going up in smoke.
Though modestly produced and efficiently shot, pic boasts solid production values.

After unwisely hitching up with those costly Stepford Wives ,  director Frank Oz  gets drawing-room small with a proper English farce set solely within the confines of a country house, where frumpy, grumpy Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen ), his bestselling bro Robert (Rupert Graves ), and their family and friends have come to bury their father. Like Oz's best films ( Dirty Rotten Scoundrels , What About Bob? , and Bowfinger ), Funeral  obscures its sincerity behind a veil of misanthropy; before we can get to the touching eulogy, we first must encounter an accidentally acid-doused attorney (Alan Tudyk ) and his exasperated fiancée (Daisy Donovan ), a cranky wheelchair-bound uncle in dire need of a crapper (Peter Vaughan ), a short American possessing dark secrets about dear ol' dead dad (Peter Dinklage ), and assorted other relatives with little tea left in their bags. Yet for all its spot-on performances (Macfadyen's particularly good), clever dialogue, and wacky gagsTudyk winds up extremely naked on a rooftop just before Dinklage winds up riding shotgun in a coffin Death at a Funeral never even approaches the best of Oz's oeuvre. It's his first movie that begs for the laugh track; they'll love it on BBC America .
