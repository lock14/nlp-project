Hallelujah. Bill Maher walks with the angels in his documentary Religulous
 (rhymes with ridiculous). Though fashioned as popular entertainment with laughs, light moments, and mostly humorous segments, Religulous
 is as serious as a disapproving Jehovah about its mission to upend our rote allegiance to blind religious faith. Maher hosts this globe-hopping whirlwind of interviews with various representatives of the Western religious faiths of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Mormonism (Eastern and African religions are paid no mind here, which is one of the film's stumbling points). He goes to the Vatican and the Holy Land, the Mormon Tabernacle and a truckers' church in the Bible Belt, a congressional office and the church he attended as a child. As always, Maher carries with him his sharp wit as he engages his interviewees on the subject of faith without proof. He is in every scene as the interviewer, but rather than using Michael Moore gotcha tactics, he participates in what seem to be real conversations with his subjects. He poses provocative questions to which the respondents' answers often form the unintended punch lines. More restrained here than he is on his TV show Real Time With Bill Maher
, Maher frequently responds to an interviewee with controlled silence. The best example of this is his conversation with Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas during which the creationist senator defends his beliefs against Maher's ridicule of this legislator who believes in Bible "fairy tales," and Pryor concludes by saying, "you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate." Instead of responding to the gift of a fabulous straight line, Maher remains silent while the camera lingers on Pryor's face. The scene is also a testament to the contributions of director Charles (Borat
, Curb Your Enthusiasm
), who needs no more than this film's simple two-camera setup to demonstrate an unfailing sense of what needs to be in the frame at any time. Maher and Charles can be faulted for playing it somewhat safe in Religulous
, never going toe-to-toe with sophisticated thinkers or experienced theologians and instead depending for their interviews on those who might be considered easy marks. Neither do they delve too deeply into the more indecipherable sense of spirituality that seems to infuse the majority of people even if they don't consider themselves members of an organized religion or faith. A closing monologue by Maher about the dangers of mixing religion and politics also uncomfortably shifts the film's tone from barbed humor to zealous rant. Until that point, however, Maher dances on the head of a pin, pirouetting onscreen as he preaches the gospel of doubt. If, as Maher states, 16% of the U.S. population identifies as secular humanists who don't believe in God, then that's a large cross section of the country whose voices are muffled by the status quo. It is to them, more than the believers, Maher speaks. To the keepers of the faith, Maher and Charles in essence proclaim, "Let my people go."


It's entirely possible to leave "Religulous" thinking the planet is shaped like a barrel and the people living in it are fish that needed shooting. The shooter is Bill Maher, the stand-up comedian who now specializes in bloviating. The fish include anyone who believes in God.
In this road documentary, Maher travels the world (the Netherlands, the Bible Belt, the Vatican, the Wailing Wall) and meets with laypeople, clergymen, scholars, politicians, and fanatics, all of various denominations.
As an exchange of ideas, this is a hopeless project, since Maher's doubt is as immovable as his interviewees' certainty. As entertainment, it's entirely a matter of whether of you find Maher's superiority complex a laughing matter. He's a committed skeptic, and those who aren't must be stupid.
Obviously, the film, directed by Larry Charles of "Borat" fame, is rigged in Maher's favor. But his smugness makes him a frustrating guide for this kind of quest. The film has a habit of cutting away from interviews for Maher's commentary during the drive to the next location. You can see him trying to work the car for a laugh.
The comedian has done his Bible study and religion-history homework. (In a London park, he even disguises himself as a bum and shouts the sci-fi premise of Scientology.) Many of the faithful Maher interviews are underprepared or exposed as naïve, misinformed, or possibly fraudulent. Once in an infrequent while Maher's haughty disdain finds an appropriate subject, and a kind of negative chemistry develops.
Take his meeting with Jeremiah Cummings, a former member of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, an ex-Muslim, and now a popular minister with a flagrant taste for the finer things. Maher asks all the right questions - about his lizard-skin shoes and gold jewelry, how he makes his money - without bullying. He hooks Cummings with flattery, then reels him in. The same trick works with the Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor, an evangelical Christian and Democrat who says something so self-incriminatingly thoughtless that your heart goes out to him.
But Maher and the movie usually mistake mockery for a form of communication. During interviews, the film makes brief editorial cutaways to footage of, say, armed jihadists or an explosion meant to comment on what someone's just said. It's not a strategy that necessarily becomes Charles, who, as ringmaster in Sacha Baron Cohen's traveling circus, never had to resort to the movie equivalent of muttering under his breath.
In "Borat," Cohen played dumb at the risk of his life and his integrity. Maher never puts himself in danger of any kind, physical or intellectual, unless seriously interviewing the actor who plays Jesus at the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando, Fla., counts as endangerment. Even Michael Moore - who, it should be noted, is both a superior filmmaker and more compelling movie character - has managed in his documentaries to let other people besides himself look smart.
Mostly Maher is content to riff, rant, opine, judge, reduce, and preach - zealously, I might add. Early in the film, he meets with a group of American men in their tiny church, and speaks from an elevated pulpit, requiring them to look up at him. One of the men doesn't appreciate Maher's tone, excuses himself, and exits. He knows that Maher is not looking for answers. He's looking for targets.


Bill Maher, with his wryly contemptuous gleam (a look that says, to almost everything, ''You've got  to be kidding me!''), is only too happy to be the skunk at the garden party. That's one reason some folks can't stand him. But to me it's Maher's prickly honesty that has always made him an electrifying comic artist. Unlike his fellow political jester Jon Stewart, Maher puts his idiosyncrasies right out there, even when they tick people off  his feelings about drugs, for instance (he's a big fan), or marriage (not a fan), or religion (really  not a fan). He's a bombs-away provocateur, and in Religulous , Maher's blasphemous detonation of all things holy and scriptural, he doesn’t really pretend to play fair. He's like Lenny Bruce with an inquiring mind and a video camera.
In this documentary collaboration with Borat  director Larry Charles, Maher travels across America, as well as to Jerusalem and the Vatican and the Netherlands, grilling people about their religious faith. He talks to wealthy ministers in lizard-skin shoes, egomaniacal rabbis, a fellow who attempts to get gay men ''back in touch'' with the straight Christian inside, a guy who plays Jesus at an evangelical theme park, and his own mother (who was Jewish  though the comedian was raised Catholic). Does Maher take cheap shots? More than you can count. (Some of them, I have to say, are hilarious.) If you believe, as I do, that religion has been the prime civilizing force in our world, then Religulous  may on some level be indefensible. But that's why I'm glad Maher made it. He's scathing, but also curious, and as mischievous an interrogator as Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat. Talking to a melting pot of the faithful, Maher worms his way into the niggling contradictions of our cherished belief systems. There's a ticklish, childlike logical glee to his view that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are fairy tales for adults. Religulous  isn't an attack upon God but on the vain, deluded things human beings say and do in His name.
The movie is funny as...well, hell. It's also galvanizingly topical, since Maher’s view is that anyone who is powerful enough to have his or her finger on the nuclear button should not  be overly eager for the Rapture. Religulous  emerges as the first movie jape of the Sarah Palin era. It's a film that's destined to make a lot of people mad, but Maher, for all his showy atheistic ''doubt,'' isn't just trying to crucify religion  he truly wants to know what makes it tick. He leaves no stone tablet unturned. A–

 There is no arguing with faith. As the comedian and outspoken nonbeliever Bill Maher travels the world, interviewing Christians, Jews and Muslims in the facetiously funny documentary “Religulous,” you begin to wonder if there might be two subspecies of humans.  The skeptical minority to which Mr. Maher belongs constitutes 16 percent of the American population, he says, citing a survey. For many of them, including Mr. Maher, the tenets of Christianity, Judaism and Islam (Eastern and African religions are ignored) are dangerous fairy tales and myths that have incited barbarous purges and holy wars that are still being fought. A talking snake? A man who lived inside a fish? These are two of Mr. Maher’s favorite biblical images offered up for ridicule.  The majority of Americans, however, embrace some form of blind faith. But because that faith by its very nature requires a leap into irrationality, it is almost impossible to explain or to defend in rational terms.  Mr. Maher has already established his position as an agnostic in his HBO comedy series, “Real Time With Bill Maher.” A recent clash on the program with his frequent guest the blogger and author Andrew Sullivan, who is a Roman Catholic, illustrated how believers and those who doubt might as well be from different planets. They can argue with each other in fairly reasonable voices about politics, but not about faith.  “Religulous” is directed by Larry Charles, whose credits include “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” and many episodes of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” And the movie has the same loose, on-the-road structure as “Borat.” Much of Mr. Maher’s film is extremely funny in a similarly irreverent, offhanded way. Some true believers  — at least those who have a sense of humor about their faith  —  may even be amused. But most will not.  In a small journalistic coup Mr. Maher interviews a Roman Catholic priest in front of the Vatican, who laughingly agrees with him that the fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church are nonsense that are not to be taken literally. Mr. Maher, unfortunately, doesn’t press him on why he wears priestly vestments and presumes to exert religious authority.  Although theologians and scientists are interviewed in the film, they are fleeting presences in a documentary that doesn’t pretend to be a serious cultural or scientific exploration of the roots of faith. Because Mr. Maher adopts the attitude of an inquiring reporter instead of a pundit, his contempt for organized religion isn’t as pointed in the movie as it is in his television monologues.  His strategy is to coax most of those subjects who are true believers to appear foolish as they offer stumbling, inarticulate responses to his friendly interrogations. The majority of his subjects are easy targets. One such sitting duck is José Luis de Jesús Miranda, a nattily dressed Miami preacher who declares that he is the second coming of Christ and claims that his Growing in Grace ministry has 100,000 followers. Like the fulminating televangelists whose ministries the film glosses over, he comes across as a greedy, self-satisfied charlatan with a fondness for gold.  When Mr. Maher asks  Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat  and fervent evangelical Christian, why faith is good, he stumbles for an answer. Returning later to Senator Pryor, Mr. Maher suggests that many evangelicals look forward to  the end of the world, when it is  prophesied that Jesus will return. The senator doesn’t dispute him.  John Westcott, a former homosexual who is now married and the  director of Exchange Ministries in Winter Park, Fla., an organization whose mission is to reorient sexuality, can only smile when Mr. Maher reminds him that Jesus never addressed the subject of homosexuality. At a Christian theme park where the passion of Christ is re-enacted in a tacky musical pageant, the actor playing Jesus compares the Holy Trinity to the three states of water: liquid, ice and vapor.  When “Religulous” turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam, its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy. An attitude of glib condescension is inadequate to address clashing religions that have turned the Middle East into an ideological cauldron. Jihadism and Orthodox Judaism are red-hot topics that Mr. Maher addresses  too sketchily to convey the same authority he brings to Christianity.  Ultimately, “Religulous” turns into a thunderous warning about the future, complete with apocalyptic images of stampeding armies and mushroom clouds issued by Mr. Maher, standing in the ruins of Megiddo, the Israeli site from which the Book of Revelation says Armageddon will originate. Secular humanists, agnostics and atheists should rise up and make themselves heard, he declares. Instead of faith, he emphasizes, we should consider doubt.  “Religulous” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes humor that many will consider blasphemous.

Skeptics unite: You have nothing to lose but your inhibitions. That, in sum, is the underlying message of Bill Maher and Larry Charles� brilliant, incendiary �Religulous,� in which comedian/talkshow host Maher inquires of the religious faithful and finds them severely wanting. By providing an example to other non-believers, Maher is, um, hell-bent on launching an even more aggressive conversation on the legitimacy of religion than he has on HBO�s �Real Time With Bill Maher.� Sure to be a major talking point in Toronto and destined for tons of free media, docu looks primed for serious numbers in theatrical and vid heaven.
Set to open Oct. 3, the Lionsgate release just wrapped a one-week Oscar-qualifying run at theaters in New York and Claremont, Calif., in advance of its Toronto fest premiere. 
The only recent comparable example of entertainers venturing into such serious cultural-political territory is Penn & Teller�s Showtime series, �Bullshit!,� which skewers sacred cows from a skeptical-libertarian perspective. Charles� previous smash, �Borat,� used funnyman Sacha Baron Cohen to make satirical/political points, but the particular intensity and seriousness of Maher�s project are nearly unprecedented. Indeed, its arrival shortly after the death of George Carlin -- a profound influence on Maher�s standup act and politics -- suggests the kind of film Carlin might have made in his prime. 
Standing at the spot where believers say Armageddon will be waged -- Megiddo, Israel -- Maher opens his case with a warning that those who believe in a so-called �end of days� may be making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Scene also suggests the considerable globe-trotting Charles, Maher and their crew did for the film, from heartland America to Amsterdam to the Holy Land to the Vatican, and also establishes Charles and lenser Anthony Hardwick�s method of covering every segment with two cameras.
Maher devotes the first hour to the Christian faith, weighted toward evangelism, with amusing personal recollections of growing up Catholic with a Jewish mom. Not missing a beat, he even interviews his mom, Julie (who died after filming), and sister, Kathy, in the New Jersey church they attended, uncovering exactly why his parents left the church -- their use of birth control.
In a string of frank, often hilarious but always well-considered conversations with various Christians, Maher incisively asks them what skeptics always ponder about religion in general and Christianity in particular. To John Westcott of Exchange Ministries, which tries to �convert� gay men, Maher asks, given that Jesus never once talked about homosexuality, why is it such an issue for New Testament Christians? To churchgoers in Raleigh, N.C., he notes there�s no firm proof that Jesus Christ ever actually lived. Perhaps most profoundly, he asks Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), a devout evangelical, �Why is faith good?� 
To the film�s credit, Maher never engages in Michael Moore-style gotcha tactics, but rather asks questions that raise more questions, in the form of a Socratic dialogue. To believers expecting a blind hatchet job, this will prove both thought-provoking and a bit disarming; skeptics may be surprised (as Maher is) by the occasionally smart replies to his queries.
Pic gets in satirical digs at all faiths -- and yields some of its biggest laughs -- with clever inserts of clips from movies and other sources spinning off the topic at hand, be it fantastical Biblical tales, Mormon beliefs or the number of empires that have invaded Israel. Snarky subtitles are often inserted underneath conversations, meant to undercut the interview subject.
Latter section turns to Judaism and Islam, of which Maher is an equal-opportunity critic. Jewish laws around the Sabbath come in for some heavy ribbing, while the current wave of violence by wings of Islam is faced head-on. Chats with Muslims, from rapper Propa-Gandhi to scholars at the holiest Jerusalem sites, expose an internal debate raging among contemporary Muslims.
While he examines the Big Three religions of the West at length (Eastern faiths get a pass in �Religulous�), Maher even gets in some choice stabs at Mormonism (whose tenets may astound those not in the know) and Scientology.
Ending minutes, though, will catch auds up short: Suddenly, the laughs die down, and as in his closing monologues on �Real Time,� Maher turns deadly serious with a final statement that will stir raging arguments in theater lobbies.
Considering he was once a minor comic and a supporting thesp in generally awful film comedies, Maher�s transformation into one of America�s sharpest social critics is remarkable. He takes no script credit, but his periodic monologues to the camera are undeniably written, and written well.
Charles basically lets Maher do his thing, and does little other than record scenes as they happen. Tech credits of significant note belong to editors Jeffrey Werner, Jeff Groth and Christian Kinnard, who have assembled what must have been a daunting pile of footage into a notably sharp and smooth-running feature that never lags for a second. Behind the scenes, the research team of Robyn Adams, Chelsea Barnard and Sophie Charles supports Maher with considerable data. 


Redolent of Roman decadence and authority gone mad, the title Religulous  rolls pleasingly off the tongue. But Bill Maher 's one-man stand-up attack on religious fundamentalism is a dog that has more bark than bite—a skeptical, secular-humanist hounding of the hypocrites, amusingly annotated with sarcastic subtitles and clips from cheesy biblical spectacles.
Initially quite funny in its head-on engagement with star-spangled, self-righteous platitudes, Religulous  is one small career move for the left-libertarian tele-savant Maher and another, equally modest step toward confronting the migraine-inducing, theocratic With God On Our Side nonsense that defines much American political discourse—John McCain  gets a cameo insisting that "the Constitution established the United States as a Christian country," but he's hardly the only public figure out to sever the U.S. from its Enlightenment roots.
Religulous  opens with Maher in Israel  at fundamentalist ground zero, reporting from Megiddo, the designated spot for the Battle of Armageddon. By way of an alternative vision of the apocalypse, the movie breaks into a comic montage juxtaposing all manner of holy men, true believers, and pious pols—then licenses the comedian to spend the rest of its 101 minutes turning his blunderbuss on this barrel of fish.
For some, Religulous  might seem to articulate what has been imagined as Hollywood's secret agenda since the 1920s: Is nothing sacred to these heathens? Maher, who explains that he was brought up Catholic by a non-observant Jewish mother (dragged on camera to proclaim: "Every family is dysfunctional"), seems unambiguously alienated from cosmic consciousness. Recalling his boyhood, he says that God "wasn't relevant to my life—Superman was relevant" and maintains that he would have worshipped any deity that let him jerk off. (The latter is counterintuitive to the max: Radical psychotherapist Wilhelm Reich  theorized that it was precisely to keep kids from masturbating that humanity invented the notion of an invisible, all-seeing God.)
Although his antics are directed by Borat  showman Larry Charles , Maher is hardly comparable to Sacha Baron Cohen  as a trickster performance artist. (His funniest act in Religulous  is a brief stint, big glasses on and ear-flaps down, preaching Scientology  in Hyde Park, London . A few minutes into his rant, a bystander steps out of the crowd and crowns him King Ding-a-Ling, solemnly placing a garland of balloons on his fevered brow.) Nor is Maher a swashbuckling provocateur like Michael Moore , comforting the afflicted and confronting the infidels with his intimidating bulk. Mainly, Maher is pleased to play devil's advocate; occasionally, he presents himself as celebrity Antichrist.
On a road trip through rural North Carolina, Maher and his unseen entourage pause at a tiny truck-stop chapel for some good-natured joshing with the congregation. Whereas religion sells "an invisible product," Maher explains to them, he's peddling doubt. Sensing what's to come, one believer angrily makes for the door. Maher is always pleased to challenge, debate, and laugh at the lumpen faithful, willing as they are to cite "historical facts" to defend any position. Still, as a polemicist, he's hardly fair—more than a few exchanges are recalibrated in the editing, and too many end with Maher flipping Pascal's Wager, rejoining a believer's "What if you're wrong?" with an emphatic "What if you're  wrong?"
Such one-sided encounters are more depressing than fun. As a showbiz wise guy, Maher is more effective when hanging with more public personalities. He gets a dapper soul singer turned preacher to insist that "Jesus [also] dressed very well!" and then go on to mangle Matthew 19:24 ("It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God"). He maneuvers Senator Mark Pryor  of Arkansas into accepting the premise that religion is a remnant of the Bronze Age; unperturbed, Pryor defends his beliefs by lamely pointing out that "you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate." Maher confounds tourists and an unhappy public-relations woman in Orlando 's Holy Land theme park by engaging the star-struck actor who plays Jesus in a theological debate.
These straw men are Maher's more formidable opponents. It's far less enjoyable to watch him bait an anti-Zionist Hasid, a barely coherent Scottish Muslim, a guy who claims to be a descendant of Jesus, the proprietor of a creationist museum of natural history, or a Dutch pothead who runs a "cannabis ministry." The last half of the movie is more or less spent with the freaks on the carnival midway in preparation for Maher's big spiel. Throwing his own brand of snake oil on the fire, he insists that faith makes a virtue of stupidity, identifies religion as dangerous because it encourages people to believe they have all the answers, and warns the world to "grow up or die."
Heavy stuff. Freud, who devoted his life to the study of irrational behavior and characterized religion as humanity's "universal obsessional neurosis," concluded The Future of an Illusion  on a wistful note—arguing pragmatic, imperfect scientific thinking as the only alternative to the delusional totality of religious faith. Maher more or less short-circuits this line of thought with a fire-and-brimstone crescendo of exploding nuclear bombs and a chorus of the Talking Heads ' "Road to Nowhere." The anthem isn't inappropriate: Religulous  doesn't really go anywhere either. It's ultimately a celebration of the old-time religion we call entertainment.
