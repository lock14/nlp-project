Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a physics whiz. She's earned straight A-pluses and is on the fast track for a scholarship and a spot in Harvard's freshman class, where I'm sure she'd happily give President Larry Summers a piece of her very scientific mind. But, in ''Ice Princess," a feel-good but inane Disney production, what Casey really wants to do is figure skate.
So in the process of devising exact aerodynamic formulas for how to land perfect lutzes and salchows, Casey transforms from one kind of prodigy to another. She joins the same skating program as the popular girls at her school, one of whom is Gen (Hayden Panettiere), an unnaturally tan, unnaturally blond skater. Her single mother, Tina (Kim Cattrall), is her coach and a former champion; Gen's brother (Trevor Blumas) drives the rink's Zamboni and develops a crush on you-know-who.
Tina is taking these potential champs as far as she can, but she has reservations about Casey. Does she have the fire and competitive drive to make it? Nothing about Trachtenberg's chirpy and flustered demeanor says so. But, man, when she and her stunt double start landing triple axels, we're convinced. So is Tina, but only up to a point. Casey is ultimately her daughter's rival, and at Eastern sectionals, mom has a momentary psychotic lapse. One punky skater informs Casey that Tina's behavior is eerily reminiscent of what Tina pulled back in her championship days. ''It's just like Sarajevo," she says.
Because Casey is being raised by a stark-raving feminist, she has to disguise most of this from her academic single mom, Joan (Joan Cusack), who mysteriously holds the sport as an affront to women. Casey's mom righteously hates the outfits, the smiling, and what she perceives as an undue emphasis on physical appearance. Besides, going to Harvard has been the plan for Casey since she was a toddler. But was it Joan's dream or Casey's?
As long as Casey is fighting with her mother or sneaking off to practice, ''Ice Princess," written by Hadley Davis, is looking for drama in places it shouldn't. Cusack and Cattrall have juicy negative tension (I never thought I'd see these two go at each other), but some mothers would love to have the dilemma Joan faces. Her contempt for skating simmers at a level most parents save to rail against stripping, drugs, or a personal invitation for milkshakes with R. Kelly.
Joan might have a more compelling case if Casey were a boy (that would be a more interesting movie), or if the Carlyles were destitute and Harvard were their ticket out of the ghetto. But the stakes aren't high enough to justify Joan's irrationality. Indeed, her confession about what truly bothers her is poignant in its pettiness.
I'm not sure that 
'tween girls will know what to do with the astounding amount of unsteady handheld photography and the gracelessness with which the movie cuts between Trachtenberg and her double. Still, while he's not a strong technician, director Tim Fywell (''I Capture the Castle") ensures maximum cuteness and gives ''Ice Princess" a heart.
I especially appreciate how Gen becomes determined to befriend Casey when a zillion other stories would keep them at odds. The movie paints such a gentle picture of the figure skating world that neither we nor Joan can stay resentful for long.


         "Ice Princess" takes aim at teenage girls and hits the target squarely. It invites them to share the dreams of Michelle Trachtenberg's lovely Casey Carlyle, a suburban Connecticut high school senior whose aptitude in physics qualifies her to apply for a Harvard scholarship, much to the delight of her mother, Joan (Joan Cusack). "Ice Princess," smartly directed by Tim Fywell from Hadley Davis' insightful script, is about more than striving for one's dream, for what Casey discovers is that she has to decide whether she's pursuing her dream or her mother's.
 
  To be sure, the film is filled with talented young skaters turning in dazzling performances sure to thrill young girls who would love to take their turn on the ice — as would Casey. Yet the film is really about young people whose overbearing parents vicariously experience their children's achievements.
 


         






    Although this is the kind of entertainment designed to send its audience home happy, "Ice Princess" has its share of stinging moments and has a good deal more edge than one might have expected.
 
  Casey's physics teacher (Steve Ross) suggests she pursue a highly personal summer physics project to impress her Harvard interviewer. Since she has always enjoyed ice skating on the pond adjacent to her home, she hits upon a study of the aerodynamics of ice skating. This takes her to the local rink owned by Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall), a renowned former figure skater. Tina is one relentless dame, coaching her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere), a classmate of Casey, to become a champion skater. Inevitably, Casey decides that to gain the full benefit of her experiment, she needs to skate herself. Casey's discovery that she has the potential to be as good at skating as she is at physics creates all sorts of unforeseen problems. Joan, a proudly intellectual college literature professor, is as much a thwarted woman as Tina, who never quite made it to the top on the ice. They are blindly determined to fulfill their dreams through their daughters.
 
  Cusack and Cattrall play their parts with plenty of punch, but Tina is the better drawn character. Though it is made clear that Tina is a divorcée, there is no reference to Casey's father whatsoever — it's as if Joan conceived Casey through parthenogenesis. Joan put off going to college for some undisclosed reason and was not able to attend a university as prestigious as Harvard. At one point she exclaims that she's been able to give Casey only a quarter of what she would have liked to have been able to provide. Casey is understandably perplexed by this remark, for they live in a handsomely comfortable home on considerable leafy acreage. By Los Angeles standards it's a million-dollar property, and the suburb depicted on the screen is hardly a poverty pocket. The script demands the estimable Cusack to shift gears a lot in portraying Joan — more than should have been necessary — yet it doesn't fill in the blanks in Joan's life that would explain her motivation more fully.
 
  All this may not bother the young girls who identify with Casey and the even more oppressed Gen. Also key is Trevor Blumas as Teddy, Tina's son, a high school student who dutifully helps his mother run her skating rink without her paying him any notice — but crucially he takes notice of Casey.
 
  "Ice Princess" works its way to its resolution with a mix of fortuitousness and a certain rigor, and it ends on an amusingly realistic note, suggesting that though Tina and Joan may be capable of seeing the light, that doesn't mean they're going to change.

Given the luxurious but difficult choice between going to Harvard on a physics scholarship and going for the Olympics as a figure skater, what's an academically gifted and athletically talented young woman to do? If she's Casey Carlyle, and if she's played by Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's Michelle Trachtenberg in the slushy teen drama Ice Princess , she should put off making a decision for as long as possible, opting instead to mope through her days, on blades and off, with a perpetually frightened expression on her demure, doe-eyed face. Casey may be the first girl in the history of outstanding scholar-athletes who doesn't know she's good at both thermal equations and triple axels, as if such excellence were  an accident and such self-awareness immodest; she's one confoundedly passive superachiever and conflicted role model.
Stranger still in this peculiarly coy feminine-empowerment fable (written by Dawson's Creek  scribe Hadley Davis and directed, with what feels like bemusement, by British TV helmer Tim Fywell) is that all the other females around Casey know exactly what they want. And each is gently but firmly punished for it, as if such desire were unladylike. Even more insidiously, it's the mothers who take the brunt of the scolding  moms can't catch a break in the movies this week and fathers are nowhere in sight. As Casey's all-alone parent, Joan Cusack is forced to personify all feminist academics as tragically dowdy and out of touch with cosmetics. Casey's coach (Kim Cattrall), meanwhile, a former skating wonder and the pushy, all-alone mother of a discontented fellow skater (Hayden Panettiere), is forced to embody all competitive women as snakes.
In such a hothouse ice rink  where romantic interest, by the way, is treated like acne  it's  no wonder that Casey is a mess, or that Trachtenberg looks so pained as she pirouettes.

s the figure-skating movie "Ice Princess" executes lazy triple loops on its way to its climactic but underwhelming competition, you can feel this niche-marketed tweener fantasy of athletic glory frantically trying to balance a decent sense of values against a market-savvy awareness. The movie's likable saucer-eyed heroine, Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), is a high school physics whiz on the fast track to a Harvard scholarship. When she is drawn into the world of competitive figure skating, she has to make a Hollywood choice between equations and eye shadow. The rule says that sports heroines must trump nerds for box office security. Casey, who lives in Connecticut with her divorced mother, Joan (Joan Cusack), a prune-faced intellectual snob, enjoys whirling away her afternoons on the pond outside their house. A light bulb goes on inside her head when she decides to fuse her brains and sinew by writing a paper on the physics of figure skating. Camcorder in hand, she visits the local rink to conduct research. The nasty aspiring Olympians practicing there initially suspect her of being a spy. Once she calms them down, she begins taking skating classes in which she demonstrates prodigious talent, and her progress whets her appetite for competition. Mother wrinkles her nose in disapproval. The rink's owner, Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall), is a hard-boiled former skating champion who blew her chance for Olympic glory years earlier. She is now a coach ruthlessly pushing her daughter Gen (Hayden Penettiere) to succeed where she failed. The movie, directed by Tim Fywell, avoids hard-driving flash for flaccid skating sequences, in which each of Casey's main competitors personifies a different style. Zoey (Juliana Cannarozzo) is a wild, pig-tailed rock-'n'-roller; Tiffany (Jocelyn Lai), a demure and balletic little lady; and Nikki (Kirsten Olson), known as "the jumping shrimp," a ferocious jack-in-the-box. Casey's prodigious talents seem less than phenomenal compared with theirs, and when audiences go crazy for her, their enthusiasm seems misplaced. "Ice Princess" is on the side of youth. The two pushy mothers are forced to let go and allow their daughters to be who they are. In addition to possible medals, a reward held out is the devotion of a moist, cow-eyed boyfriend (Trevor Blumas), who suggests a Robbie Benson-manqu�.

Slap a sequined tutu on an English bulldog and you'll probably get the breathless attention of the ice-skating audience; its hunger for the sport seems insatiable. So, the vastly predictable "Ice Princess" will have no problem triple-jumping its way into the hearts of millions, even if it has a lot more in common with well-dressed bulldogs than with Torvill and Dean.

A sports movie and an ugly ducking story, "Ice Princess" is about dreams. Some are in the hearts of the movie's talented young girls, wistfully imagining an escape route from their ambitious mothers; some will be in the hearts of audiences, imagining something more gracefully choreographed.
Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a high school science whiz and wannabe Harvard-ite whose proposed scholarship project will study the physics of skating: What makes a triple axel? What puts the lift in the lutz? In pursuing her academic extra credit, she discovers not only a way to improve the performances of her haughty classmates/skating champs, but her own affinity for the sport. The question: Harvard? Or "Holiday on Ice"?
The tropes are many and familiar: High school blondes (such as Hayden Panettiere's insufferable Gen Harwood) are witchy and/or stupid; popular boys are turned off by brains; smart girls are destined to be mousy wallflowers until something glamorous makes their hair pop out of their death-grip ponytails, and fathers are nonexistent. Neither Casey nor Gen has one. Who or where they are is never even mentioned.
Mothers, though, they have: Casey's is unregenerate feminist and math mom Joan Carlyle (Joan Cusack), whose blind ambition to get Casey into Harvard is as fierce as her resentment of sexy little skating outfits. Gen has an even more relentless mother, Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall), a onetime Olympic skating star and Stalinist skating coach, whom Cattrall reduces to cartoonish callousness and grating egotism.
Neither mother does much for the image of skating. Or feminism. Or motherhood. But, as with most of "Ice Princess," that's not the point. The point is to make Casey as much a model of pure talent and guilelessness as has ever set blade on ice.
A savvier movie (and script) might have been able to mix some grays into its black and white palette, but "Ice Princess" is a movie in which character development is an abrupt and illogical process. Gen, for instance, doesn't gradually become a better person. She suddenly is one. When Casey erupts against her unjust treatment by mother Tina, it's without warning, or much plausibility.
All of which would be more forgivable if director Tim Fywell compensated with graceful action on the ice for what he lacks in the story off it. No such luck. Trachtenberg ("Harriet the Spy," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") looks positively elegant in profile, moving slowly across the ice -- and that's how Fywell is forced to shoot her. And shoot her. (Four different skaters sub for Trachtenberg in the more difficult performances.)
The most sparkling aspect to "Ice Princess" is Juliana Cannarozzo, a real-life, nationally ranked skater as well as a saucy actress whose pugnacious Zooey Bloch is the abrasive threat to the careers of Casey's three cohorts (Gen and pals Nikki and Tiffany, played by Kirsten Olson and Jocelyn Lai).
Cannarozzo not only skates like a demon, her unaffected, dead-on portrayal of a skate punk should provide her long years of work in the ice-skating movie genre -- although that's something "Ice Princess" may revive and kill at the same time.

Will the circle be unbroken? Let's hope not. This poorly conceived sequel to Gore Verbinski 's The Ring  ditches that film's scariest conceitpeople die a week after watching . . . an avant-garde video! for a watery possession plot. Fleeing the gnarliness unleashed in the first movie's Seattle  for small-town life, Rachel (Naomi Watts ) and her weird little son (David Dorfman ) have to fend off bad plumbing, angry deer, and the unshowered ghost girl who keeps ruining his digital photos. Postpartum depression is invoked several times; if the name of the game is to be the unheimlich  maneuvers of the mother-child bond, one wishes Hideo Nakata  (director of the Japanese Ringu  films) could have nudged the proceedings toward the Rosemary's Baby -Birth  axis. (Indeed, there's a brief, wordless melody intended to evoke RB .) Sissy Spacek , as the would-be Andrea Yates  now in the loony bin, is thankfully obscured by a long wig. The let's-travel-through-the-TV-screen sequence was better in Fat Albert  . Next time we'll try call-waiting.
