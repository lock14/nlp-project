 This film about a brilliant boy pianist fighting to shape his destiny was Switzerland’s entry for the 2006 Oscars, and you can see why. Like most award-seeking crowd-pleasers, it places uncomfortable impulses in opposition — in this case parents’ desire to develop a child’s latent genius, versus the child’s desire to have a “normal” childhood and find his own way — then dramatizes them in the most unchallenging way imaginable.  Vitus is a Franz Liszt in the making, and academically gifted to boot, but he would rather fly planes. His saintly grandfather (Bruno Ganz) respects his individuality, even as Vitus’s loving but self-centered parents (Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker) jump him ahead in school and make him perform at parties.  The title character is played as a  6-year-old by Fabrizio Borsani and as a 12-year-old by Teo Georghiu. Both performers are real piano prodigies, and the director, Fredi M. Murer, acknowledges their gifts in shots lingering on their finger-work.  Unfortunately, Mr. Murer is too sweet on his characters, including Vitus, a brat who sasses his teachers, scams his parents, creepily courts a teenage girl (Tamara Scarpellini) who was once his baby sitter and sneaks into a commuter airport and steals a plane for a joy ride. The triumphant musical cues and comic double takes encourage us to cheer Vitus’s high jinks as if he were Ferris Bueller’s ivory-tickling kid brother.  “Vitus” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has underage drinking, adult situations and mildly inappropriate language.

A 12-year-old piano prodigy struggles with his parents, his talent and his future in solid family drama "Vitus." A natural for kidfests, pic is a fine example of old-fashioned story-telling and also will dance wherever detailed character development and leisurely-paced drama are appreciated.
Already advanced at the age of 6, Vitus (pronounced "Veetus") von Holzen (Fabrizio Borsani) has hypersensitive hearing and reads the encyclopedia for recreation. He's the apple of his parents' eyes: Dad Leo (Urs Jucker) is an inventor on the verge of patenting a revolutionary hearing aid design, while Brit-born mom Helen (Julika Jenkins) is fiercely protective of her son's talent.
But even at such a tender age, Vitus is already apprehensive about all the attention he receives. The kid takes a shine to his eccentric grandfather (Bruno Ganz) and spends most of his free time hanging around the elder's workshop listening to his advice and his dreams of flight.
By the age of 12, Vitus (now played by real-life prodigy Teo Gheorghiu) is clearly uncomfortable about being different and deals with this by being precocious. Foolishly jumping off his balcony after donning a pair of wooden wings tooled by his grandfather, the boy hits upon the idea of pretending the fall has robbed him of his talent. While employing this ruse, he helps save Leo's company and learns a good bit about life in the process.
Working with key creatives that helped shape his similarly ambitious and unfortunately overlooked 1998 "Twin Peaks"-ish child disappearance drama "Full Moon," which shared the Montreal fest's grand prize in its year, vet Swiss helmer Fredi M. Murer once again seems to have thought a lot about the issues on display in his film. Thus, "Vitus" can feel overstuffed with ideas about family dynamics, the burden of talent and the risks of capitalism, but for auds willing to submit to its leisurely pace, the effect is enveloping.
A far cry from his befuddled Fuehrer in "Downfall," Ganz' rumpled grandpa isn't in a lot of the story but nevertheless emerges as its serene center. Young Gheorghiu engages the camera with ease, and Jenkins bravely essays a character whose maternal instincts can be more than a little abrasive.
A pair of actresses, Kristina Lykowa and Tamara Scarpellini, are fine as Vitus' free-spirited babysitter, Isabel, in two stages of the youngster's life.
Tech package is seductively glossy, with a rich selection of classical piano pieces scattered throughout the proceedings.

Genius weighs heavily on a child prodigy who longs to be "normal" in this charming Swiss import from veteran director Fredi M. Murer . Kicked out of kindergarten for being too smart, Vitus is both a brilliant mathematician and a musical virtuosobut he is still a child emotionally, something his well-intentioned parents fail to see. Only his beloved grandfather (Bruno Ganz ) allows him to be an ordinary, mischievous boy, and Vitus increasingly seeks refuge with him. Tired of being exceptional, Vitus plots a way out of his dilemma. Blissfully devoid of both sentimentality and melodrama, the story takes a few fantastical turns toward the end that dampen the realism but serve the film's larger message. Impeccably acted, Vitus  rests most squarely on the shoulders of two superb, young first-time performers: Fabrizio Borsani , who plays the yonger Vitus, and Teo Gheorghiu , a real-life piano prodigy, who plays Vitus at 12.
