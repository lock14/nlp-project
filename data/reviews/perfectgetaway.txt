Director Twohy may have been born and bred in the Hollywood hills, but you wouldn't know it from his r�sum� and this above-average thriller, both of which easily could have fit into the recent doc about Aussie exploitation filmmaking, Not Quite Hollywood
. (And that's a good thing.) Long before he chronicled Vin Diesel's Riddick, Twohy was churning out pseudo-exploitation fare, such as The Arrival
 ("You'll believe Charlie Sheen is a radio astronomer!"), while simultaneously penning the script for the big-budget seafaring wipeout Waterworld
 and (sort of) mainstreaming his career. A Perfect Getaway
, however, is a smartly paced and ultimately purely exploitative head trip that's a lot of fun if you can get past the third-act meltdown and Zahn's, um, far-ranging performance. If anything, A Perfect Getaway
 recalls late-Seventies/early-Eighties Aussie fare such as Long Weekend
, Road Games
, and any number of Brian Trenchard-Smith films, minus the nudge-nudge/wink-wink down-underisms and with a far higher budget (and some truly breathtaking cinematography courtesy of Mark Plummer, whose last notable film was Kevin Spacey's claustrophobic directorial debut, Albino Alligator
). Zahn and Jovovich play newlyweds Cliff and Cydney, who are spending their honeymoon traipsing around igneous outcroppings of Hawaii. Determined to follow a treacherous trailhead on the island of Kaua'i, they first encounter a pair of seemingly dodgy hitchhikers before embarking on their main trek and hooking up with yet another couple: testosterone-overloaded Nick (Olyphant) and his Southern belle girlfriend, Gina (Sanchez). As the quartet starts off, climbing over sheer, vertiginous drops and lolling in idyllic waterfalls, word arrives that still another
 couple (this film is nothing if not an exercise in duality) has been found butchered on the main island. Meek Cliff � whose day job as a Hollywood screenwriter provides more than a few recursive chuckles � debates turning back, as the unknown killers have been described as a "couple" and are still, apparently, at large. Could they be the hitchhiking couple who keep turning up, just out of frame? Or is it their newfound trail buddies, who both seem to know their way around edged weaponry and grin way too much for Cliff's comfort? Twohy, who also wrote the screenplay here, ratchets up some seriously nail-gnawing suspense; A Perfect Getaway
 is, in its own delightfully silly and manipulative way, one of the most effective paranoid thrillers of the new millennium. That doesn't make it a great movie by a long shot � the entire third act is an exercise in manic, flashbacky histrionics � but Zahn and Olyphant's mismatched machismo and the bizarre mystery at the heart of the story do
 score high marks for exceptional and thoroughly engrossing weirdness. And seriously, this would make a terrific double bill with Colin Eggleston's Long Weekend
.

‘A Perfect Getaway’’ may be a lousy title for a suspense thriller, but once you see the film, it does make a certain 
multi-leveled sense. In the same way, the movie itself turns out to be a neatly crafted B-movie pleasure  - nothing fancy, but the gasps, screams, and (mostly) intentional laughs are there. Anyway, “The Honeymoon Killers’’ was already taken.
It’s one of those city-mice-in-the-wilderness affairs, with newly married yuppies Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) embarking on a Hawaiian hiking honeymoon on the isle of Kauai (cue dramatic helicopter shots of the jagged Na Pali Coast). They’re in love and terminally naïve, forging ahead even after hearing about the brutal murder of two other newlyweds on Oahu  - even after the chopper pilot calls the area “the most gorgeous dead end God ever made.’’ He stops just short of painting targets on their backs.
Cliff and Cydney are savvy enough to avoid a creepy psycho-surfer couple they meet on the trail (Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton). On the other hand, they’re clueless enough to tag along with Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez), who may or may not be the sweetest pair of homicidal killers on the island.
Nick’s handy with a bow and arrow, and he regales Cliff with tales of his days in Iraq as part of an advance black-ops team. “I’m an American Jedi,’’ he crows, and Olyphant, who’s delightfully confident here, almost makes you believe the brag. Gina, a lanky Southern belle, can skin and dress a goat in minutes. “I find it more interesting than gory, really,’’ she remarks, which isn’t a bad description of the movie as a whole.
That’s pretty much all you get: Three couples strung out on a remote trail waiting for violence to erupt. Surprisingly, it’s enough. “A Perfect Getaway’’ is proof that a dumb idea can be brought to life, however briefly, by smart people, and writer-director David Twohy (“Pitch Black’’) is nothing if not clever. He makes Cliff a Hollywood screenwriter with a script lost in rewrite hell, a fact that still impresses Nick, who’s sure his life would make a terrific Nicolas Cage project. “It’s all about story,’’ he barks at Gina. Exactly so; seen in retrospect, some of the scenes could be writer’s exercises in how to mislead an audience.
If it’s best to go in knowing as little as possible, I can say the game board gets dramatically rearranged at a certain point, after which the blood flows and dramatic believability is reduced to entertaining tatters. The actors  - who are all quite a bit sharper than the people they’re playing  - deliver their lines with nuances that, in retrospect, are entirely warranted. “A Perfect Getaway’’ may not play fair by the audience but at least it cheats honestly. These days that’s something.

Who's been murdering newlyweds, turning a beachy paradise into a tropical hell shared by three pretty couples? You'll probably guess, but that doesn't take away from the slicked-up genre charms of A Perfect Getaway , a summery suspense thriller from writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black ). Steve Zahn  makes full use of the many varieties of hyper in his acting arsenal, while Timothy Olyphant has a heckuva good time telegraphing macho mania. The picture treats itself to all sorts of artsy camera tricks. And no, you're not tripping: The movie is set in Hawaii but was shot in...Puerto Rico. B–


 Do you suffer from blockbuster bloat? Do wisecracking guinea pigs give you the willies? Are you sick of ugly truths and icky, shticky juvenilia? Are you in the mood for mean, lean entertainment, some gratuitous R-rated nudity, totally unnecessary bloodletting and a slam-bang twist of the narrative knife? A B-movie-style throwback that’s consistently diverting and blissfully free of morals and messages, “A Perfect Getaway” is just the thing for the summertime movie blahs: it’s a genuinely satisfying cheap thrill.  A few wedding video clips introduce Cliff and Cydney Anderson, who, shortly thereafter, are seen rushing around Hawaii preparing for a honeymoon adventure. The eccentrically matched Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich play Cliff and Cydney, who, after loading up on gear, head off on a long hike toward a remote stretch of paradisiacal beach. As the blue, blue ocean spreads out below them, they hug a coastal trail, trading alohas with other hikers, including Nick (Timothy Olyphant), a hard body with a sly smile and a long blade strapped to one calf. Nick, it emerges, has a few tales to tell — one involving a bullet to the head — some seemingly taller than others. He’s awfully hard to kill, giggles his girlfriend, Gina (Kiele Sanchez).  A dark cloud drifts in fairly early, when news breaks that a young couple has been butchered on another island, setting off predictable alarms (in them, in us). Cliff and Cydney briefly huddle, weighing their options and casting worried glances at Nick. Throwing caution and apparent good sense to the wind, they stick with Nick and Gina, and together the four make for the beach. As they journey, Nick’s quirks grow curiouser and curiouser, and his tales grow progressively more far-fetched. A self-proclaimed American Jedi, he flexes his muscles and a violent skill set, at one point even bagging a goat that Gina, having suddenly produced a knife and a pair of pink rubber gloves, expertly guts.  Working from his own screenplay, the director David Twohy sets an easy if increasingly anxious tone and a brisk, functional pace. Cliff, it emerges, is a screenwriter with his first movie in preproduction. Nick, casting glances at Cliff, seizes on this information,  and it soon becomes a wedge between the writer and the warrior, the nominal geek and the anointed brute. You need a new story, Nick lectures Cliff, before plunging into a mildly comic meta-discourse on what makes a good thriller. It’s the kind of self-reflexive moment that usually means you’re watching a movie by a film-school grad. Here, the knowing cine-chatter cranks up the tension and serves as a clever, to quote Nick, “red snapper” (i.e., red herring).  This is nice, tense work from Mr. Twohy, a genre veteran with a patchy record of screenwriting hits, misses and demi-successes,  like the tight Harrison Ford vehicle  “The Fugitive”  and the tasty supernatural flick “Warlock,” recommended for its indelible image of a human tongue sizzling in a pan. He also directed the science-fiction thrillers “Pitch Black” and “The Chronicles of Riddick,” which were both weighed down by the mounting fame and attendant lugubriosity  of their star, Vin Diesel. Like “Below,” Mr. Twohy’s spooky submarine horror thriller with a tight first hour and no stars, “A Perfect Getaway” suggests that he does better without big bangs or big names. The most impressive special-effects moment here involves a flap of skin stirring ominously in the wind.  Mostly Mr. Twohy just plays on our familiarity, even exhaustion,  with this kind of thriller, as he nudges us this way and that, drops heavier and heavier clues and with his editor, Tracy Adams, quickens the pace and heart rates too. In one nifty chase sequence  the screen splits into two and then three, allowing you to see who’s chasing whom. The four leads furnish the requisite frightened and fearsome looks, as well as the ripped musculature and the self-consciousness about genre that you often find in neo-exploitation cinema. Because they’re also good actors, you actually care if their characters make it out alive. Having tamped down his comic side, Mr. Zahn does a fine impression of a rabbit, while the regrettably underemployed Mr. Olyphant makes like a world-class hunter.  “A Perfect Getaway” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun, knife, hatchet, rock, bow-and-arrow,  fist-and-foot violence.

A big-reveal thriller with surprises that really do surprise -- and are worth waiting for through an audaciously long buildup -- "A Perfect Getaway" finds writer-director David Twohy in popcorn form with a muscularity not seen since 2000's "Pitch Black." Toplining Milla Jovovich and Steve Zahn as one of three Kauai-vacationing couples imperiled by homicidal maniacs, pic offers a basic "Into the Blue"-type lure, marrying suspense to spectacular scenery both natural and gym-toned. What develops, however, is gratifyingly twisty, and doesn't lose its humor even when the going gets very tough. Late-summer sleeper status is assured, with likely stronger ancillary biz.
Excerpts from a wedding video intercut with the early Hawaii honeymoon days of Cydney (Jovovich) and Cliff (Zahn), accompanied by ominous music, raise the usual expectations that we'll soon witness deep trouble in paradise. After viewing their destination by helicopter, the two purchase permits allowing them to hike 11 miles to a remote beach.
Their rental-car drive to the trail's start point is marred by a brief encounter with hitchhikers Cleo (Chris Hemsworth) and Kale (Marley Shelton). She seems nice; he really doesn't. Once on foot, our yuppie protags meet a more congenial fellow traveler in Nick (Timothy Olyphant), who leads them to a gorgeous waterfall where his own amour, sassy Southerner Gina (Kiele Sanchez), is already taking the waters au naturel.
The warning signs are many: The more Nick and Gina talk, the weirder they get. The stalking/skinning of a wild goat for supper induces Cliff to observe that his new friends have "officially graduated to the 'crazy' category." This is no idle jest; by then, everyone has become aware that a pair of honeymooners in Honolulu were brutally murdered by another couple who are still at large.
It takes "Getaway" a full hour before it springs its biggest -- though far from last -- plot twist (which no doubt will be spoiled for many by text-messaging friends and unsubtly hinting reviewers). But that hour is far from time spent waiting for something to happen, as Twohy's screenplay gifts its principals with some fresh, sparky dialogue. When things finally do go to hell in the proverbial handbasket, the humor becomes more visceral than verbal, though one female character does get a memorably offhand last line.
The script's sole dicey aspect is the characters' occasional, self-conscious quipping about the very thriller-movie tropes being upended (excused by the fact that Cliff is a rising screenwriter), but fortunately those aren't pushed to overload. Twohy's one directorial misstep is a late bit of split-screen gimmickry that values style over content. But those minor quibbles aside, "A Perfect Getaway" is most satisfying (admittedly, "perfect" would be a stretch) pop entertainment that's clever enough to require no apologies for being sexy, gory, and far-fetched when thought about afterward.
Clearly enjoying their character idiosyncracies, the thesps are sharp, with slowly rising star Olyphant and comparative unknown Sanchez likely to get career boosts. Production is first-rate down the line; Mark Plummer's widescreen images were mostly shot on Puerto Rico for tax-credit purposes, with some Jamaica and Kauai pickups dressed in.

Because they're usually so badly made, B-movie thrillers rarely merit more than a chuckle and a roll of the eyes, but with A Perfect Getaway , writer-director David Twohy  (Pitch Black ) strikes the proper balance between the genre reverence for and a loopy subversion of the film's "terrorized romantic couple" formula. The couple in question—nerdy screenwriter Cliff (Steve Zahn ) and wife Cydney (Milla Jovovich )—have just arrived in Kauai, Hawaii , for their honeymoon when they hear about a recent murder of newlyweds on the secluded island. Suspecting a white-trash couple (Chris Hemsworth  and Marley Shelton ), they befriend another pair of lovebirds (Timothy Olyphant  and Kiele Sanchez ), who seem nice enough despite some ominous signals that they, too, could have homicidal tendencies. Twohy knows that his film's raison d'être is to lay out ridiculous red herrings while keeping us guessing as to who's targeting our heroes, but he finds inventive ways to mess with expectations, whether it's by supplying a bizarre backstory monologue or dishing dark humor at the unlikeliest of occasions. Rest assured, though, the story's Big Twist is reliably out-there, culminating in a no-holds-barred battle to the death that's craftier and more muscular than the norm. A Perfect Getaway  is never great, but Twohy isn't aspiring for greatness—he's after gritty and lively and weird. And that's good enough.
