With her Kewpie doll eyes and puffy face, Bynes has well earned her place in tween fandom. And bless her heart, she�s got decent comedic timing. But let�s hope she develops a more discerning eye for scripts before she signs up for Sydney White 2
. A loosely updated version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
, the story follows young Sydney (Bynes) as she heads off to college, inadvertently steals a bitchy sorority queen�s hot-girl status, wins the heart of a �prince,� and winds up as the spokeswoman for a group of outcasts. From the contrived romance to the hazy lavender eye make-up that Sydney sports in every scene, there�s nothing real about this film. More at home with her comic-book collection than a pair of heels, Sydney is the quintessential movie tomboy. Having grown up mostly sans mother, Sydney arrives at college armed with photos of her late mom�s sorority days, anxious to live up to the legacy. Little does she know that the sorority is controlled by evil Rachel Witchburn (Paxton) whose style includes forcing the sisters to recite, �Target cute pledges. Avoid fat losers.� Though Sydney is certainly cute and never fat, she�s an oddball. And while her legacy status gets her in the door, Sydney makes an enemy when Rachel realizes that hot guy No. 1, Tyler Prince (Long), is into Syd. And to top it off, Syd does weird things like eats bacon, throws a football, and talks to dorks. As a result, she gets the boot on the eve of pledge initiation. What�s a skinny pretty girl with permanent lavender eye make-up to do? Why, shack up with the college dorks, of course. Consisting of seven nerds, all based loosely on the Disney dwarves (Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, etc.), the outcasts embrace the homeless Sydney. These eccentric characters provide some entertaining distraction, particularly Carpenter as the Sneezy-esque, perpetually allergic Lenny and Pantoja as the dumbed-down, Dopey-like George. But, ultimately, nothing can distract from the reality of a watered-down script with a cringe-worthy love story. A better version would have Sydney wind up with one of the nerds. The shiny-toothed Tyler just isn�t nearly as interesting as any of the seven dorks. All that to say, I will admit (begrudgingly) that I was a little moved during the climactic finale when Sydney rallies the school�s varying marginalized into a sort of celebratory protest. It�s cheesy and contrived, but even the most watered-down stories retain elements of the original masterpieces.


I spent most of "Sydney White" trying to solve the mystery of Amanda Bynes's tan.
It's noticeable even in the trailers, but in the film itself - a feeble college comedy aimed at middle schoolers - the star's skin tone is a dark orange fake-and-bake marvel not found anywhere in or near nature. Did they take Bynes out back and lacquer it on? Did she suffer an accident in a Cheetos factory? Is it on loan from Lindsay Lohan in "Georgia Rules"? Doesn't matter: It's mesmerizing, and one of the worst makeup jobs ever seen in a studio film.
You're glad for the distraction, though, since "Sydney White" makes "Mean Girls" look like Shakespeare. A modern-dress "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" revamp, it's a comedown for Bynes, who has parlayed her pleasing plain-Jane looks and tart comic energy into a series of TV shows and movies ("What a Girl Wants," "She's the Man") that are better than your average mall-rat entertainment product. Not a lot better, but better.
This one pits the Barbies against the nerds, with Bynes's Sydney uneasily in the middle. She's the tomboy daughter of a manly single-dad plumber (John Schneider, of "The Dukes of Hazzard," given three scenes) who goes off to her late mother's college expecting to join her sorority as a legacy.
Kappa Phi Nu and the college itself are ruled by Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton), the latest in a long line of detestable blond hotties (see "Bratz," "High School Musical," etc., etc.). Sydney's easygoing ways and schlumpy sneakers offend her sensibilities and, after a thorough public humiliation, our heroine is exiled to the Vortex, a condemned dorm where seven dorky losers live. Sydney White and the Seven Dorks, get it?
Actually, the Vortex scenes are the funniest in the movie, since each of the seven gets his grumpy/sleepy/bashful character trait and the actors run with it. (So does Bynes, who looks happier here than in the sorority sequences.) Jack Carpenter as the allergic-to-everything Lenny (aka Sneezy) is even quite charming, and a smarter movie might think to pair him off with Sydney.
Chad Gomez Creasy's screenplay trundles down the more well-traveled path, though, providing the heroine with a real Prince Charming in Tyler Prince (Matt Long), the sensitive hunk of Frat Row. Tyler sings a cappella like a prep and plays video games like a wonk; the movie's point - and it's a good one, in theory - is that we all carry different cliques around inside us.
In practice, "Sydney White" is so broad and dumb it wouldn't fool a 12-year-old. Under Joe Nussbaum's direction, the fairy-tale parallels are cute (especially that "poisoned" Apple computer), but the film's message of inclusion somehow turns insulting. Sydney and the Dorks run for Student Council against mean old Rachel by appealing to the college's "fringe groups": the Goths, the transgenders, and . . . the Jews? Yes, according to this movie, all Jews are hefty young guys who wear peyas, twirl their prayer shawls, and shout "L'Chaim!" at every opportunity. Who knew there was a Chabad Lubavitch chapter at Southern Atlantic University?
For those keeping score, the movie offers an unintentional tissue-sample of shifts in pop-culture stereotypes. In English, that means nerds have officially become so hip that the film climaxes with the Kappa blondes and the jocks standing and claiming "I'm a dork!" in "Spartacus"-style solidarity. Well, no, you're not, but if cultural gentrification makes you feel better about yourself, go for it.
Bynes does what she can to pep up the proceedings - the movie mostly requires her to stammer amusingly or look determined - but even the target audience for "Sydney White" will probably realize college can't be this silly. Their parents will busy themselves fretting over the "fun" binge drinking in the frat-party scenes. I'm still freaked out about that tan.


         In "Sydney White," a broad, mean-girls take on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Amanda Bynes plays a teenager with the rugged soul of a plumber's daughter and the elite aspirations of her late sorority-gal mom. At home, she wears plaid shirts and wields a wrench to the manner born, but she enrolls in the whitest university in the country and rushes at the blondest, most uppity house on campus.
 
 Sydney's nemesis is the sorority queen, a pointy-nosed goddess named Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton), who believes she is the fairest girl around and has the Web hits to prove it. While Rachel does her wicked best to undermine the new dark-haired pledge's bid for sisterhood, the resident fraternity royalty, Tyler Prince (Matt Long), woos Sydney with clumsy mixed messages. Enter the seven dorks, a brotherhood of geeky rejects whom Sydney whips into a civic frenzy in order to beat the Greeks at the upcoming school election. And so on, ad nauseam.
 


         






   It's disheartening to see the peach-pretty Bynes anointed as official spokeswoman for college castaways.
 
 It's also a little weird trying to grapple with a movie in which the only black women who can be spotted, if you look close, are on a frat-party dance floor, and in which Jews and gays are  relegated to sideshow status. Step right up and see the drag queen and the weird, happy guys with the black hats and the pavess.
 
 Directed by Joe Nussbaum and filmed in that mecca of diversity, Orlando, Fla., "Sydney White" is a carnival of ethnic and social stereotypes that are rising up against the lily-white status quo. In Hollywood, blond princesses and fairy tales die hard.
 
 "Sydney White." MPAA rating: PG-13 for some language, sexual humor and partying. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minute. In general release.   

 Like Cluny Brown, Ernst Lubitsch’s tomboy heroine played by Jennifer Jones in 1946, Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) makes tool-wielding women sexy.  But that’s where the Lubitsch comparisons end, for there’s nothing sophisticated about the comedy in this peppy, ultra-P.C. variation on “Snow White.” Here Ms. White is a handy girl raised by her plumber father (the better-with-age John Schneider) who enrolls at her late mother’s alma mater, hoping to join the sorority Mom cherished.  But Sydney’s humble background and nonblond hair are just two indicators that she isn’t Greek sister material. After being rejected, she finds refuge at the Vortex, a ramshackle house inhabited by the seven biggest geeks  on campus. One’s bashful, another one’s sleepy ... you get the drift. Together they rally to steal the student body presidency from Sydney’s nemesis, Rachel, ahem, Witchburn (Sara Paxton), the still-pining ex of Sydney’s potential Prince Charming, Tyler, ahem, Prince (Matt Long), who’s as generic as his fairy-tale equivalents.  Perfectly slight, “Sydney White” is unlikely to muster the staying power of, say, “Revenge of the Nerds,” the raunchy underdog-power trailblazer from 1984. But Ms. Bynes, with her cherubic face, expressive eyes and comic timing, helps create a positive, pleasing diversion that caters to the geek in all of us.  “Sydney White” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some vaguely suggestive material and one record-breaking keg stand, but could easily pass for PG.

From "Twelfth Night" to "Snow White": Having taken on Shakespeare in the high school-set comedy "She's the Man," Amanda Bynes graduates to college with the fairy-tale themed "Sydney White." Result should satisfy Bynes fans looking for a pleasant, innocuous follow-up to her last vehicle, with B.O. in the decent if unspectacular range of "Man." Ancillary prospects look brighter.
While it may be premature to call Bynes the reigning queen of classically-inspired teen comedy, she has carved a niche as the dependably plucky heroine (or sidekick, in "Hairspray") of inoffensive, mildly amusing romcoms. And when it comes to her squeaky clean image, Bynes remains the fairest of them all. (Vanessa Hudgens, take note.) All of which means "Sydney White" reps an acceptable, if disappointingly safe career move for its star.
Reared by her plumber dad (John Schneider) after her mom's death, Sydney (Bynes) is a spirited tomboy more comfortable dishing on football than fashion. When she leaves for Southern Atlantic U., however, Sydney makes the uncharacteristic decision to pledge a sorority. It's a sentimental choice: Her mother was a Kappa.
But times have changed. Run by the self-obsessed, whippet-thin Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton), and populated by a pack of skinny blonde bimbettes, Kappa is the kind of sorority that gives Greek life a bad name.
Undaunted, Sydney braves the humiliating rituals of Rush Week and initiation and befriends a fellow pledge named Dinky (Crystal Hunt).
When Rachel sees her ex-flame Tyler Prince (Matt Long) take an interest in Sydney, the Kappa queen casts her rival out of the sorority house. Stumbling upon a dilapidated old dwelling known as the Vortex, Sydney becomes the guest of the seven geeky guys who live there. (Good thing Universal amended its wince-inducing original title "Sydney White and the Seven Dorks.")
No, the guys don't toil in a diamond mine, but they do sit around playing and parsing video games. Pic provides a few good laughs with Sydney's arrival at the home of the socially challenged, sexually inexperienced guys.
Realizing that the evil Rachel intends to replace the Vortex with a self-named Greek Life center upon Rachel's re-election as student body president, Sydney mounts a vigorous counter-offense, nominating the Vortex Seven for student council on a single ticket.
This earns Tyler's affection but Rachel's scorn, especially given Sydney's rising status among the online ranking of hottest college coeds. Not surprisingly, Rachel resorts to cruel and humiliating tactics to undermine the campaign, the worst of which involves bribing a hacker to erase Sydney's computer hard drive -- in other words, giving the unsuspecting girl a poisoned Apple.
The infected Mac joke might be the acme of Chad Gomez Creasey's script, which otherwise goes for the obvious. Ditto the serviceable helming by Joe Nussbaum ("George Lucas in Love"), which relies on a number of predictable sight gags. Mark Garner's production design has convincingly dressed up its central Florida locations to yield an attractive college campus that's fittingly rendered in Mark Irwin's lensing.
