Any woman who goes to Las Vegas and falls for a man named Huck is asking for trouble. That's what Billie Offer (Drew Barrymore ) gets in "Lucky You," a mixed-up romantic sports comedy of sorts set in the Vegas poker world, with Eric Bana as the troublemaking Huck.
Billie is an aspiring singer from Bakersfield , Calif. And we know Barrymore is in trouble the minute she opens her mouth. Her voice is high and airy, like her hair. Billie is a guest of her sister, and she's stuffed full of dreams. She speaks in dreamy cadences, as if everything, especially poker, is something she's experiencing for the first time after seeing it in her sleep.
Playing the character with this much girlish innocence is risky. Barrymore can seem dumb, but as "Lucky You" unfolds, we realize that the character is just a device to bring viewers into the parallel universe of poker.
It's a man's world. Jean Smart has a small part as a top player, and the person doing the commentating makes sure we know it's a big deal. The thrust of the movie concerns Bana's self-destructive ace and his odd, competitive relationship with his estranged father, a championship oldster that Robert Duvall plays with his usual cocky wisdom.
They enter a million-dollar tournament that takes up the movie's back half -- it's like "The Color of Chips," and during the big contest, Barrymore shows up in the audience and just recedes into the anonymity of spectatorship. Yet her character is crucial to the film, which was directed by Curtis Hanson ("L.A. Confidential ," "Wonder Boys ," "8 Mile "), who wrote the script with Eric Roth .
Huck meets Billie at some kind of sports pavilion (there's indoor volleyball), where a stranger is hitting on her. Sensing an opportunity to assert his ego, Huck steps in, pretending to be her boyfriend, a move she clearly finds charming.
Her sister (Debra Messing ) then steps in and makes us promptly aware that Huck is bad news. "Hustle 10, commitment zero," she warns, apparently from experience. But it's too late. In that dreamy voice, Billie wonders if she can change him and spends the rest of the movie being let down.
Their first "date" is at the poker table, where he explains, with a note of exasperation, how the game works. These early scenes are interesting because you're curious about what he sees in this woman with the big hair, nervous singing voice, and open heart. And after he sneaks off with $1,200 of her money, you get it.
But Billie doesn't learn the hard way. She doesn't learn at all. And the movie doesn't justify her tolerance for such a selfish man. Her attempts to teach him scruples, sensitivity, and love are frustrating, like watching a Jehovah's Witness keep knocking on an atheist's door.
To be fair , Bana is seductively handsome. The opening scene in which Huck tries to sell a camera to a pawn shop owner (Phyllis Somerville ) who doesn't need it is a wonderful introduction to a desperate man who knows his charm is another form of capital.
This could have been a movie of finesse, screwball romantic comedy, or breezy cynicism, in the vein of Ernst Lubitsch , Preston Sturges , or Billy Wilder (Robert Downey Jr. has a tiny part as a 900-number schemer that shows you how that film might have gone). But Hanson is a director with masculine sensitivities. As "In Her Shoes" demonstrated two years ago, he can't walk in heels.
"Lucky You" could also have been dark and bruising, though perhaps Hanson is defending against cliche. Huck is roughed up some but never has his knuckles crushed, and Billie is never assaulted. There are no drugs or goons or any consequence. No one drinks irresponsibly or has sex that we can see. This is a TV drama version of Las Vegas -- even more so than the TV version of Las Vegas already on NBC.
In going for a kind of relaxed air, Hanson and Roth have sterilized their movie, boxed in all the human contours. They're playing as close to the vest as anyone sitting at those card tables.


Lucky You  wagers that the strategies and insider vocabulary of high-stakes poker are sexy enough to engross even a card-novice moviegoer. Don't bet on it  advice that comes from a novice delighted with the table action in Casino Royale  and Ocean's Eleven . This marathon, no-stakes drama deals a low-card romance between a daddy-conflicted, poker-playing Las Vegas hotshot named Huck (Eric Bana, suffocating in his poker face) and a sweet, wannabe lounge singer named Billie (Drew Barrymore, drawing the wrong hand when it comes to casting). Of course, he sees in her old-fashioned eyelash fluttering a girly purity apparently missing from every other woman he has ever bedded in Nevada.
But the love story is a bluff. So is the tension between Huck and his mean ol' poker legend of a father, L.C. (Robert Duvall), a psychobabblish competition that causes the old man to undermine every move his kid makes with crap advice like ''the key to winning is watching and understanding,'' and spurs the glowering son to betray his instincts with empty commentary like ''no matter what's prudent, sometimes you gotta play your gut.'' Really, all this movie is about is the joy of checks, calls, folds, rivers, and the acquired thrill of knowing what those words mean. For her part, Billie opines that ''maybe giving and receiving are more complicated than winning and losing,'' but nobody listens to her. That's because Billie is a 2-D character who might as well have been built from green felt.
The movie, I can only assume, is a gut play on the part of writer-director-producer Curtis Hanson, himself a declared poker aficionado. Hanson is also an obsessive filmmaker who loves to immerse himself in exotic subcultures  the senior-citizen Florida geography of In Her Shoes , the Detroit alleyways of 8 Mile , the vintage California noir of L.A. Confidential . And when he and coscreenwriter Eric Roth first began work on the project (the release date has been shuffled a few times), televised poker was just making it big as a popular spectator sport. Clearly, Hanson is jazzed by the macho manipulation of chips and cards, the mysterious knocking and tappings of players with their shuttered eyes, the mindset, and the mumbo jumbo.
Fine for him, but somewhere between the first cards dealt and the inevitable father-and-son showdown at the fictionalized World Series of Poker that wraps up the movie's therapy sessions, a passion for authenticity gives way to alienating obsession, and real-time betting brings any dramatic momentum to a halt. The air is as artificial as it is in a gaming establishment with no windows or clocks. That an exact replica was built of the Bellagio poker room as it looked in 2003 may be of interest to hotelier Steve Wynn, but replication isn't action  it's fetish.
Lucky you, I've run out of topical analogies for now, except for this: A decent movie just wasn't in the cards.

 Cards on the table: I find it hard to dislike a movie that delivers songs by George Jones and Bruce Springsteen within the first five minutes or so. The rest of the music in “Lucky You” is of a similarly high, canonical quality (even when it’s Drew Barrymore rather than Mr. Jones singing “Cold Hard Truth”), but by the time the brand-new, specially commissioned Bob Dylan number plays over the end credits, it feels less like an apotheosis than like a consolation prize.  I still can’t entirely dismiss “Lucky You.” Even though it is sometimes dull and generally thin, there is something winning about the movie’s genial lack of ambition. It’s a nickel-ante fable of lessons learned and chances taken set in the world of high-stakes competitive poker. The sense of disappointment that lingers afterward may result from inflated expectations, since this is a small picture with some big names attached to it.  Like the main character, a Las Vegas poker player with the literary name of Huck Cheever (Eric Bana), “Lucky You” has a noble pedigree. It was directed by Curtis Hanson (“L.A. Confidential,” “Wonder Boys,” “8 Mile”), who wrote the script with Eric Roth (“Forrest Gump,” “Munich”). Mr. Hanson’s style is relaxed and observant; he is more interested in watching his characters than in hurrying them through the plot. This is just as well, since the story he has to tell is a pretty wheezy contraption, a slack assemblage of romantic-comedy and Oedipal-reckoning clichés.  Huck’s dad, a onetime English professor named L. C., is a two-time winner of the World Series of Poker and a raffish, self-possessed gambler of the old school. That he is played by Robert Duvall is one of the film’s great advantages; if I were as devoted to poker metaphors as Mr. Roth and Mr. Hanson seem to be, I’d say that Mr. Duvall was the ace in the hole.  With a neat mustache and a twinkle in his eye, he portrays a man in possession of more charm than scruple, and he attacks the role with his usual unpretentious gusto. Watching other people play cards is not necessarily riveting, and if the card table sequences in “Lucky You” turn out to be the best parts, it is largely thanks to Mr. Duvall, who could bring wit and excitement to a movie about the high-stakes world of competitive Sudoku or Crazy Eights.  The card-playing scenes — many  featuring real-life fixtures of the professional poker circuit — also offer some relief from the clumsy attempts by Mr. Bana and Ms. Barrymore to breath whimsy and longing into an unconvincing love story. Huck, who lives in an unfurnished house with an empty swimming pool, is not much for commitment. He is tempted to give up his rambling ways by Billie Offer, Ms. Barrymore’s character, an aspiring singer who has just arrived in Las Vegas from Bakersfield.  Billie’s most important attribute, as far as the filmmakers are concerned, is her complete ignorance of poker (and, it seems, of certain common American idioms that have nothing to do with gambling). This allows Huck to explain the basics of the game.  Billie, in turn, explains the finer points of Huck’s psychology. These are not mysterious. As L. C. puts it, his son plays cards the way he should live his life, and vice versa. In the casinos (lovingly recreated on a Hollywood studio soundstage), he is what’s known as a blaster, and in the course of “Lucky You” he repeatedly piles up big stacks of chips only to lose them on a rash bet. He steals money from Billie the morning after sleeping with her, and then feels convincingly remorseful. She, a bit less convincingly, decides to forgive him. Like money, her affection is something he wins and loses over and over again.  The crux of “Lucky You,” though, is the father-son drama between Huck and L. C., which has an oddly inert, tired feel about it. Part of the problem is that Mr. Bana, quick-witted and good-looking though he is, is an essentially passive, reactive screen presence. This served him well enough in “Munich,” in which he was the quiet, troubled soul at the mercy of external crises. But everything in “Lucky You” depends on Huck’s confused motives and feelings, and Mr. Bana’s diffidence is less intriguing than frustrating. His performance is so controlled that it becomes inscrutable.  There is not much heat between him and Ms. Barrymore, who is on hand mainly because the conventions of the genre require it. To be the girl in a gambling picture is a thankless task, though this movie deals out less heartbreak than some of its predecessors.  Compared with movies like “The Hustler,” “The Gambler” and “California Split,” “Lucky You” feels tidy and safe, more interested in kibitzing the action than in partaking of the existential rush that comes from taking big, mad risks. Strange to see a film about gambling that  wants only to break even.  “Lucky You” is rated PG-13. There’s a hint of sex, but this Las Vegas is smoke- swearing- and generally sin-free.

After several delayed release dates, Warner Bros. finally lays down its cards with "Lucky You," and it's a weak hand. Set around the 2003 World Series of Poker, the pic spends so much time at the tables that director Curtis Hanson fails to do much else -- beginning with establishing a personality for star Eric Bana or developing his relationship with Drew Barrymore. Despite departing from certain expectations inherent in a sports/gambling movie, the result is dull and lifeless, and, while launching opposite "Spider-Man 3" might charitably be called counterprogramming, the view from the gallery suggests the studio is folding early.
The timing for a poker movie, frankly, looks especially deadly, with the phenomenon having become so prevalent on cable TV (where gambling manufactures drama at a bargain price) that it's not uncommon to flip on the tube and find poker on a half-dozen channels. "Celebrity Poker Showdown," with actors as themselves, is probably more alluring.
The point of entry into this high-stakes world is Huck Cheever (Bana), a professional with a take-no-prisoners approach to the game and serious issues regarding his dad L.C. (Robert Duvall), a two-time poker champ who abandoned Huck's mother and has been fleecing his kid at cards for years.
Described as "Hustle, 10; Commitment, 0" in the ladies department, Huck nevertheless finds a little time to woo the newly arrived Billie (Barrymore), bringing her with him on a poker date that, more than anything, functions as an extended (and mostly tedious) tutorial for uninitiated audience members on rules of the game.
Huck needs 10 grand to buy into the World Series and pursue its $2.5 million payday, but he has a bad habit of gambling away cash every time he gets his hands on it, prompting him to seek or deny help from a variety of shady characters, including a phone-scam artist (Robert Downey Jr., in a worthless cameo), a money man (Charles Martin Smith), and one of those morons who bets on anything just for the action ("Saturday Night Live's" Horatio Sanz).
Winning and losing his buy-in stake in the build-up to the inevitable tourney drags on interminably, and pic squeezes in Huck's seduction, alienation and contrition toward Billie almost as an afterthought. Bana is constrained to sauntering through the entire movie with a blank poker face, and, while Duvall and Barrymore have moments, they've each been dealt these cards too many times to count -- including Barrymore's romantic turn in "Music and Lyrics," which was produced after this and released by Warnersless than three months ago.
Working with writer Eric Roth, Hanson adds to an eclectic resume that includes "L.A. Confidential" and "In Her Shoes," and he's sought to bring a high degree of verisimilitude to the poker action -- including more than two dozen characters credited as playing themselves. As presented, though, there's minimal tension -- in part because there's no real heavy -- and a hole-cards-eye view doesn't really improve that much on the way card games have been shot dating back to "The Cincinnati Kid."
Pic does feature a strong song score, including Bruce Springsteen's appropriately titled "Lucky Town," but even that can't provide the movie much of a pulse. As for the studio, there's so little to market here other than Bana (whose fans even circulated an online petition seeking to hasten the film's release) that the ad campaign almost appears designed for a different movie.
Ultimately, even for a poker movie, there's simply too much card-playing here with too little payoff. As the pic finally hits theaters, "Lucky You's" luck has probably run out.
