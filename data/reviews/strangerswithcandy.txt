Those mourning the demise of the unhinged Comedy Central series Strangers With Candy  (1999–2000) know who you/we are. In which case, the mere announcement that Strangers With Candy , the movie, brings back 46-year-old ''boozer, user, and loser'' Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris) for more inappropriate, sorta thrillingly raunchy adventures in the halls of Flatpoint High School may stand as its own movie review.
The ostensible ''prequel'' corrals the whole Candy  gang, including Stephen Colbert as married-with-a-sexual-secret science teacher Chuck Noblet, Paul Dinello (who also directs) as art teacher (and object of Noblet's affections) Geoffrey Jellineck, and Greg Hollimon as martinet principal Onyx Blackman. There's the matter of a science-fair project, and a running joke involving the long-term vegetative condition of Jerri's father (Dan Hedaya), an affliction that beset the old man on account of his daughter's life on the streets and in the slammer for 32 years. (Just because he's comatose doesn't mean he can't be trotted out to school events, like any other detached dad.) If you loved Amy Sedaris before in a golfer-lady wig and inbred chump's grin, you'll maybe love her again here, while wishing she had another TV-episode-size venue for her talents: There's a whole lot of padding and stretching  going on in these 85 minutes.
On the other hand, there's a whole lot of groovy guest stars on hand, too  it's hip kids' night out. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Allison Janney throw all their classy might into playing prissy school board members. Matthew Broderick is a weaselly science-fair ringer. Sarah Jessica Parker rolls her eyes as an unmotivated guidance counselor. The series was created by longtime Chicago improv pals Colbert, Dinello, and Sedaris as a cracked but loving parody of after-school specials through the ages, the kind where learning and hugging  ugh  conclude all business. Mr. Colbert has, of course, gone on to become America's most trusted source of ''truthiness'' with his weeknightly Colbert Report . How nice  how American  that the bigwig is still true to his school.

 The recurring nightmare that afflicts so many of us —  being suddenly and inexplicably plucked out of adulthood and sent back to high school  — is the premise of "Strangers With Candy." Not that its heroine, a 47-year-old named Jerri Blank, whose post-adolescent life is a catalog of dysfunction, including multiple addictions and a long, fondly recollected stint in jail, is necessarily someone with whom we're supposed to identify. As incarnated by Amy Sedaris, who also played the character on the Comedy Central series from which the movie has been belatedly spun, Jerri is a fascinating grotesque.  Desperately in need of — at the very least — a pedicure and a few Pilates sessions, she presents an unnerving combination of prison-yard street smarts and profound dumbness. By turns needy and belligerent, repulsive and almost sweet, Jerri is one of those sketch-comedy creations, like Martin Short's Ed Grimley or Gilda Radner's Lisa Loopner, that somehow transcends caricature to become — well, human might be overstating it, but you know what I mean.  Written by Ms. Sedaris, Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello, who also directed, "Strangers With Candy" does not quite rise above its spoofy, basic-cable origins. Like many feature films based on small-screen,  short-form comedy, it feels more like a long, sloppy "very special" episode than a movie. Still, devotees of the series, admirers of Ms. Sedaris and fake-news junkies who can never get enough of Mr. Colbert will find reasons to see it and to convince themselves that it is funnier and more satisfying than it really is.  Count me in. In addition to Ms. Sedaris's utter immunity to embarrassment and ability to toss off jokes that explode a few beats after you think they will, like damp blasting caps, the movie offers a grab bag of geeky, juvenile humor. As a setting, the modern American high school is shopworn and inexhaustible, with an ever-replenishing supply of jocks, nerds, mean girls and, in this case, a student (Carlo Alban) who shares the name of a well-known head of state. ("I'm Megawati Sukarnoputri," he says, by way of introduction. "Not that Megawati Sukarnoputri.")  There is also a pompous, corrupt principal (Gregory Hollimon) and a bevy of amusing cameos. Allison Janney and Philip Seymour Hoffman are school board officials and science fair judges; Sarah Jessica Parker is the school grief counselor, who keeps a tip jar on her desk; and Matthew Broderick is Roger Beekman, the most renowned high school science teacher and science fair project impresario in whichever state this is supposed to be.  As such, he is the nemesis of Mr. Colbert's science teacher character, who is, in turn, the former lover of Mr. Dinello's wayward art teacher. The plot wanders through various naughty and absurd situations en route to the big science-fair climax, which will also be Jerri's big chance at redemption.    Her father (Dan Hedaya) has been in a coma ever since she ran away from home, leaving his returned prodigal to contend with an icy stepmom (Deborah Rush), a thuggish stepbrother (Joseph Cross) and a guy named Stew (David Pasquesi), whose job title is one of many double entendres I'd pass along if I could. According to the family doctor (Ian Holm, believe it or not), the only way dad will recover is if Jerri overcomes her checkered past and makes the most of the second chance that parole has conferred on her.  The "Strangers With Candy" series was, explicitly, a parody of the after school specials that, in the precable past, used to supply America's youth with useful and important moral lessons. This movie, its aggressive impudence notwithstanding, upholds that tradition, reminding us to be ourselves, follow our dreams and be very glad that we never have to set foot in a high school ever again.  "Strangers With Candy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying  parent or adult guardian). It has vulgar sexual humor and drug references.

A whimper was heard across the land when Comedy Central skein "Strangers With Candy" was canceled in 2001 after three seasons. An instant cult fave, the absurdist spoof of Afterschool Specials now is back in a prequel that reunites its original collaborators (abetted by several guest stars) and reps the first theatrical feature effort for David Letterman's Worldwide Pants shingle. Warner Independent Pictures ponied up $3 million at Sundance for North American rights to a pic that will delight the previously converted, but, as film is just as hit-and-miss as the series was, accessing broader auds could prove a challenge.
After 32 years on the street, on the lam and in the joint as a "boozer, user and loser," ex-prostitute/junkie Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris) decides to start again "right where I left off" -- as a high school student. Never mind that she's almost three times the age of her classmates or that she's not particularly welcome back in the home where daddy (Dan Hedaya) is in a coma, and "mommy" is his hostile second wife (Deborah Rush). Latter not only has a moronic jock son (Joseph Cross) but also a butcher boyfriend (David Pasquesi) pretty much living on the premises.
Faithfully reproducing TV version's unique flavor, these and even odder circumstances are taken in stride by characters alternately venal and oblivious. "Candy's" funhouse-mirror vision of all-American suburban life observes perverse behavior with incongruous good cheer and ersatz schmaltzy "uplift," while the incessantly voiced racist and homophobic remarks are so pointedly ludicrous that they parody prejudice itself.
Convinced that only her becoming the "good girl" she never was will rouse daddy from his slumber, Jerri sets about being an exemplary student at Flatpoint High -- despite immediate antagonism from Principal Blackman (Gregory Hollimon) and science teacher Mr. Noblet (Stephen Colbert). Latter is a born-again Creationist with wife and child who's having an on/off gay affair with sweetly idiotic art teacher Mr. Jellineck (first-time helmer and co-scenarist Paul Dinello). Meanwhile, Blackman, in danger of losing funding, tries to up the school's low academic rep by hiring vainglorious Roger Beekman (Matthew Broderick) as a consultant. He's to steer them toward a Science Fair win -- a move that humiliates home-team prof Noblet, who in protest assembles his own rival student team.
Jerri figures winning the Science Fair will solve her problems. But her methods are somewhat appalling to teenaged teammates Tammi (Maria Thayer) and Megawatti (Carlo Alban). Subterfuge on both sides culminates in a pretty funny climax wherein the rival sides present elaborate musical production numbers to showcase their competing science projects.
As in the original series, inspired jokes run neck-and-neck with flat ones. Still, the faux "instructive" tone (full of ostensible life lessons that couldn't be more amoral) and rack of offbeat characterizations keeps things diverting. Sedaris' central creation Jerri, with her grotesque overbite, worst-of-the-'70s fashion sense and blithely appalling libidinousness toward hotties of both sexes, remains a spectacular comic turn.
Hilarious Dinello and Colbert highlight the remaining cast of tube holdovers. Among newbies, Broderick has the most to do, while Allison Janney and Philip Seymour Hoffman juice their few scenes as quarrelsome school board members. Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't add much in a cameo as a narcissistic guidance counselor.
Dinello, who's only directed shorts before, replicates the original series' feel with assurance, if without any extra dimension that might've made this bigscreen edition an improvement rather than mere continuance. Design and tech contribs are sharp on a modest budget.

Of the Sedarises, it's apparent that Gretchen is, or at least was, the funniest, if her brother David's family memoirs are any indication, and if you don't count their mother, that grande dame of impatient dish, cigarette punctuation, restless disgust, and curse-at-the-kids nonchalance. David, today, is funny too, enough to sell books like cans of soda. Amy, by the evidence on the public table, is a second-string Sedarispossessed of a rosy reputation among comics, she has only unrecognizable bit roles, a stint at Second City , and the short-lived Comedy Central  series Strangers With Candy   to commend her. Now that SWC  is a full-on movie, one might well wonder how Amy plays in meetings (fabulously, I'd guess), and how it was that a failed and peculiar cable sitcom was seen fit to reconstitute as a film, which is a far less forgiving form in terms of shtick, repetitive jokes, slack-jawed plotting, and caricature.
Sedaris certainly called in her chitsfirst shown at Sundance last year, Strangers With Candy  is top-heavy with guest stars (Matthew Broderick , Sarah Jessica Parker , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Allison Janney ) and co-producers (Stephen Colbert , David Letterman ). Whatever: The movie, for those unfamiliar with the show, represents a particular varietal of arrhythmic, conscientiously anti-witty comedy. Andy Kaufman  is the style's St. Joan, occupying the borderland between blackout yuks and discomfiting performance art. Often enough, overripe unfunniness is the joke.
As the film's hub, Sedaris, under a clownish ton of white-trash makeup and a never shampooed wig, is Jerri, an ex-junkie-hooker-hood fresh from decades in prison. A high school dropout, she returns to her alma mater in the hopes of making her comatose dad (an inexcusably wasted Dan Hedaya ) proud, or something, but the real loin of the matter is Sedaris's conception of her character. Set in Lowdown Sketch World, Strangers  is abjectly ludicrous, but even here Jerri is an alien creation, prone to gargoylish mugging and dim-witted non sequiturs. No one in the film notices Jerri's age, or her psychotic behavior; most of the cast (except, perhaps, for the implacable Ian Holm  as a charlatan shrink) have no idea how to react to Sedaris. (Margaret Dumont style awkwardness is the rule, especially for the teenagers.)
She's a committed spectacle, but hardly an incisive comedienne. When the all-sober Jerri takes a joint hit, everyone just stands back and watches her smash lamps and furniture in what's supposed to be a flashback seizure. Comic turned first-time director Paul Dinello  has the timing of a tar-pit victim; too often the dead air surrounding a gag is merely filled with Sedaris in close-up, screwing up her eyes and letting her fake buck teeth hang out of her mouth.
Mannered and odd, Strangers With Candy show or movie, because there is little functional difference between themis a daring shot in the dark, but it misses the barn. (And I do mean dark: Another comedy handicap is Oliver Bokelberg 's shadowy cinematography, giving many scenes the unbefitting gloom of a cheap thriller.) Predictably, the peripheral ideas are funniest: The school itself is a dukedom of misappropriated funds, with a faculty sauna and loungethat is, a working bar. Colbert's irate science prof is a testy neo-Christian who teaches anti-Galileo doctrine; Justin Theroux 's window of opportunity as a driving instructor who throws himself across his students' windshields is far too small. Greg Hollimon , as Principal Onyx Blackman the film's kiss-my-ass middle school racism and homophobia aren't meant as "real," but an ironic exploitation thereofis riotously gruff and blithely corrupt, even when he greets his underlings with a booming "Hi di ho!"
A few tense moments surrounding a ringing doorbell are, amid the shrugs, distended pauses, and goofy faces, a relative oasis of lurking humor. (Hoffman, on the other hand, acts as if he'd dropped by for lunch, and got shanghaied.) Strangers With Candy  regularly lampoons junkie-reparation melodramas and after-school specials, but with so little focus it's never clear what the film, or even Sedaris's vaudeville buffoon incarnation, is supposed to be parodying. That may be its fascination for someit's a satire without a baseline, free-floating in its own self-indulgent ether. It's always hard to tell which misfired films may gain a video/cable slacker cult with the roll of years and the application of recreational dope, but something tells me that, sometime in the bored future, a bang of that weed may convert Sedaris's lark into a revelation.
