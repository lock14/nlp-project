Half Nelson  offers an opportunity to marvel, once again, at the dazzling talent of Ryan Gosling for playing young men as believable as they are psychologically trip-wired. In a performance spectacular and ''invisible'' at the same time, the Canadian-born former child actor, who blew the roof off five years ago as a neo-Nazi in The Believer  (and then went on to make The Notebook  halfway palatable), stars as Dan Dunne, a charismatic, dedicated inner-city Brooklyn junior high school teacher by day. By night, though, he's something else  just another white, middle-class crackhead.
Dan, in other words, is a disaster waiting to happen, and a heartbreaker, too: He cares about his kids (most of them African-American) with the fervor of a valiant inner-city educator  but with none of the cliché heroics we've seen throughout Stand and Deliver  history. Instead, when he wastes himself at night, he's a wreck the next day, too (both in the classroom and in the gym where he coaches basketball). And that vulnerability doesn't go unnoticed by Drey (newcomer Shareeka Epps, a poised, powerful match for Gosling's intensity), a prematurely wise 13-year-old who has seen drug dealing up close in her own family.
There's no easy way out of Dan's self-imposed headlock of self-destruction and disillusionment. Half Nelson  conspicuously offers no tidy resolution or concluding uplift, which only makes the movie that much more trustworthy, and the unflashy, documentary-style filmmaking more artful. Working from a script he co-wrote with Anna Boden (shot three years ago as a short called Gowanus, Brooklyn ), first-time feature director Ryan Fleck keeps the story low to the ground, organic, honest. In response, every choice the star makes is fresh, from the way his Dan rubs his bloodshot eyes to how he attempts to straighten up his crummy apartment. Without ever appearing to act, Gosling is the most exciting actor of his generation.

 “Half Nelson” is that rarest of marvels — an American fiction film that wears its political heart on its sleeve. It’s a small film with a long view, and its story hinges on an unusually nuanced relationship between a white man and a black girl, each of whom has landed in harm’s way. The delicacy of its lead performances (more on them later) and its sense of everyday texture are each worthy of praise. But what makes “Half Nelson” both an unusual and an exceptional American film, particularly at a time when even films about Sept. 11 are professed to have no politics, is its insistence on political consciousness as a moral imperative.  The poet W. S. Di Piero once described the work of the Sicilian novelist Leonardo Sciascia as “inquiries into the impossibility of justice and the terminal intellectual fatigue caused by disillusionment.” From his haunted eyes, it looks as if Dan Dunne, the young idealist Ryan Gosling plays in “Half Nelson,” is suffering from that same terminal fatigue. A junior high school history teacher, Dan lives with his cat in an apartment filled with books, pages from an unfinished project and furniture that looks dragged in off the street. It’s the kind of apartment that the poor hold onto until they can’t hold on any longer, the kind of dump that cops break into so they can pull out the dead, which makes it the perfect home for a death wish.  Dan wants to save one child at a time, like 13-year-old Drey (the newcomer Shareeka Epps), but he’s committing suicide one crack vial at a time. He’s plagued by such contradictions, some inherited, others self-generated, teaching in a part of Brooklyn that still looks like Brooklyn, trying to do good in the very neighborhood where he buys his drugs. (The film was shot, among other areas, in Gowanus.) The people here are mostly black and brown, and in a film not as mindful of race and representation, the whole thing might come off as sanctimonious or worse. This is dangerous ground for Dan, as well as for the film’s gifted young director, Ryan Fleck, and his writing (and life) partner, Anna Boden.  But Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden are smart cookies, and they have figured out how to short-circuit the expectations of an audience weaned on Hollywood pieties. If “Half Nelson” had four times the budget and half the brains it could easily be cinematic Valium, a palliative about a white teacher who, through pluck and dedication, inspires his nonwhite students to victory, in the classroom or on a sports field, if not necessarily the larger world. But “Half Nelson” is something of a beautiful bummer, steeped in such melancholy and painful truths that there are moments when it’s almost a surprise that it doesn’t come with subtitles. This isn’t a pleasure-free zone, but the film earns its glimmers of happiness, and there are glimmers, with honesty.  Much of “Half Nelson” involves the tentative, messy relationship that develops between Dan and Drey after she discovers him nearly passed out in a school bathroom stall, a crack pipe still in his hand. The discovery gives her power that she doesn’t use. Instead of turning him in, this gruff, lonely child makes him a point of curiosity, first spying on him from the school playground and then tightening the circle, coming closer and closer. Soon, Dan is giving her rides home and warning her away from Frank (an excellent Anthony Mackie), the charming midlevel dealer who already has his hooks in her older brother. Dan and Frank each play big brother to Drey, adding layers of self-interested advice to her moral education.  For most of the film, Ms. Epps holds her face as still as a mask, only occasionally easing into smiles as bright as sunflowers, and then mostly in the company of her hard-working mother (Karen Chilton). It’s a lovely, discreet performance that derives its power from restraint, a long, steady base line that, by virtue of its steadiness, gives Mr. Gosling the freedom to riff every which way up and down the expressive scale. Pretty if not distractingly so, the actor has long girlish lashes, and the lines of his face are so delicate they might have been drawn in ink. It’s easy for him to look sensitive, but he can play nasty, too, as he proved in his breakout performance as a neo-Nazi in “The Believer.”  Mr. Gosling dazzles even brighter in “Half Nelson” as a character with a more complex take on race than the one provided by a rampaging skinhead. That complexity rises up wonderfully in the scene when Dan storms up to Frank’s house, jaw jutting, with the notion of telling the dealer off. You expect fireworks, maybe a gun or left hook. But it doesn’t go down like that because Frank is a dealer and Dan, after all, is an addict who, like all addicts, always takes more than he gives. It’s the same in the classroom. He teaches black kids about Salvador Allende and probably has a couple of dog-eared Frantz Fanon books next to his copy of Gramsci’s “Prison Notebooks.” The kids give him “focus,” but until Drey they’re also abstractions.  Early in “Half Nelson,” Mr. Fleck slips in a black-and-white news clip from 1964 of Mario Savio, a student at the University of California,  Berkeley,  and a leader of the Free Speech Movement, declaiming in front of Sproul Hall, the administration building that had become a flashpoint and battleground. “There is a time,” says Savio, voice quavering with brilliant passion, “when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part; you can’t even passively take part, and you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop.”  That time Savio spoke of passed, at least for the left. “Half Nelson” is a lament for the radical fires of the 1960’s, but its makers are too utopian, and commercially savvy, to suggest all is lost. If Savio were alive (he died in 1996), he would be roughly the same age as Dan’s parents, whom we meet over a dinner filled with loud talk and too many uncorked bottles. Just before he leaves, Dan tells his mother that she and his father “stopped the war.” She tells him, “That’s nice, honey,” and smiles one of her blurry smiles, blasted on booze and that long hangover she has been nursing since 1968. Like her, Dan has learned to self-medicate. What he needs to do now is kick the habit of disillusionment, and it looks as if he might.  “Half Nelson” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is drug use and tough language.

A terrific performance by Ryan Gosling is the chief but hardly sole reason to embrace "Half Nelson," a first narrative feature by director Ryan Fleck, who wrote it with Anna Boden. Sympathetic but toughly observed pic avoids melodrama in the potentially hyperbolic tale of a white Brooklyn middle-school teacher losing his own battle with drugs while trying to mentor an African-American student whose family has been torn apart by drug dealing. Avoiding rote inspirational notes as well as boyz-in-the-hood violence, scrupulously low-key drama nonetheless builds to a powerful impact. Unappetizing subject matter will require strong marketing emphasis on critical praise.
The alert intelligence Gosling has shown in disparate roles from "The Believer's" neo-Nazi teen to "The Notebook's" ornery romantic is put to ideal use here. His Dan Dunne is a 30-ish public school history teacher by day, engaging and well-liked by his students, though frequently at odds with the principal for straying from the official curriculum.
By night, however, he trolls bars, getting drunk and doing drugs, his bleary-eyed demeanor noticeable in class the next morning. He's kinda-sorta dating a pretty Latina fellow teacher (Monique Curnen), but is likely to bungle that as surely as he turns off bar pickups by talking philosophy and politics ad nauseum.
Also coach for the school girl's basketball team, Dunne is found semiconscious in a locker room stall after a game by 13-year-old Drey (Shareeka Epps) -- he's just smoked crack. Her deadbeat dad's a no-show in giving her a ride home, so Dunne fills in, after he's come down a bit. From this unlikely start an extracurricular friendship begins.
The bright, serious Drey has been around enough drug activity to be unfazed, given an older brother doing prison time as fall guy for local dealer Frank (Anthony Mackie), who returns the favor by kicking some cash toward her household. What with mom (Karen Chilton) regularly pulling double-shifts, latchkey kid Drey could use a little substitute parenting -- even from Dunne.
Simultaneously, Frank decides to play a more active quasi-paternal role. Worried about Frank's influence on Drey, Dunne tries to intimidate the other man into retreat. But Frank isn't having it, and Dunne's headed toward a substance-abusive bottoming-out anyway.
Astute screenplay doesn't spell out why or how Dunne got into such a state of self-destruction, though there are hints. Gosling pretty much fills in the blanks by sheer lived-in presence, lending Dunne an inner logic to the myriad contradictions. Dunne's rapport with the students, and Epps' figure in particular, is wonderfully credible.
Epps (a holdover from "Gowanus, Brooklyn," the 2002 Sundance prize-winning short whose concept creators expanded into this feature form) is convincing as a 13-going-on-45-year-old whose strength of character ultimately carries the day. Mackie is also excellent, generating enough ambiguity that both Frank's good intentions and predatory ones can co-exist comfortably -- at least so far as he's concerned.
Archival clips showing key moments in the history of the Civil Rights struggles -- a class topic and one of Dunne's passionate interests -- lend the story a larger dimension without getting too heavyhanded. Other classroom lessons, however, press obvious points.
Shot on location in Brooklyn, pic's presentation is unobtrusive and straightforward, with largely handheld camerawork and a very good original score by Broken Social Scene abetted by smartly chosen tracks by other artists.

Even curriculum-clutchers might rather leave a child behind than let her learn from Half Nelson 's Mr. Dunne (Ryan Gosling ), a Brooklyn  junior-high teacher whose off-the-cuff history lessons are basedbrace yourself, Bushieson dialectical theory. History is change, and change, the white teacher tells the kids, most of whom are black, is the result of opposing forces. To illustrate, Mr. Dunne playfully arm-wrestles one of his 13-year-oldsand wins, despite the greater pull of the teacher's own wearying addiction to crack cocaine.
Unawarded at Sundance despite ample acclaim, Half Nelson  drags the crowd-pleasing white-teacher-inspires-black-students movie onto the mat and pins the flabby genre in the first round, such is the film's acute understanding not only of its opponent's weaknesses, but its own. "What can I teach them?" Gosling's Dan wonders aloud in the bar after schoolas well he might, given that this oft hungover lefty intellectual, called daily to stand and deliver at the podium, isn't exactly the image of stability. Neither is he an entirely plausible protagonist, but as Mr. Dunne likes to employ metaphor in the classroom, so first-time feature-maker Ryan Fleck  instructs us to see his wannabe-activist basehead as a symbol of American do-gooding gone bador at least gone woefully undirected.
Fleck, who co-wrote the script with Anna Boden  in between the ambiguously effective anti-war rallies they attended in New York, dares to bend the uplifting melodrama's narrative arc until it points sideways. Who knows whether any one (or two) of us can make a difference these days? Fleck's handheld shakycaman apt stylistic device if there ever was onefirst catches Dan slumped on the floor of his unkempt apartment, the teacher bleary-eyed and wired even before his alarm clock rings at dawn. "Change moves in spirals, not circles," the strung-out dialectician tells his young students at one point, clearly spiraling down.
The audacity of making an inner-city drama in which the white-male authority figure is the crackhead finds its equal in Gosling's already legendary performance, a high-wire act that's gutsiest for its unconscionable charm. In a single shot some 15 minutes into the movie, Gosling does more than answer the question of whether an actor can humanize a junior-high-teaching drug addict whose student has just caught him cowering in a bathroom stall, reeling from a crack hit: Gosling's wide-eyed look of fear is exaggerated just enough to show us that the addict is acting, tooaffecting pathetic vulnerability, plus the faint hint of sheepishness about the act (therein is the charm), by way of copping a plea. No wonder Drey (Shareeka Epps ), watching Teach quiver atop a toilet seat (Epps's deadpan reaction is a stunner), decides to take mercy on the man, wiping his brow and proving that opposite forces can also unitein theory, anyway.
Half Nelson  builds to an image of solidarity forged across the lines of race, class, age, and gender, but its path to that cautiously hopeful conclusion remains both tough-minded and regularly surprising. Fleck and Boden, whose documentary Young Rebels  examined hip-hop in Havana , guard well against the intrusion of anything that feels like Hollywood , shooting in the fly-on-the-wall style of a vérité doc (improv played a part on the set) and sprinkling milky archival footage atop the students' classroom presentationsthe classic show-and-tell. (Only an old-school indie would care to refresh our memories of Dan White 's "Twinkie defense" and the CIA's support of Augusto Pinochet .) Tutelage takes many forms here: Both Drey's dismantled family and Dan's upscale ex-hippie one appear believably damaged by flawed father figures. One of the movie's tougher lessons is that, for better or worse, we're all connectedchild and parent, student and teacher, peddler and user. A gentler message is that stupid jokes, like the trifling knock-knock gag that passes between characters and caps the film, can be a smart way to diffuse tension.
That, Mr. Dunne would say, is a metaphor: The left won't build consensus in divisive times until it can learn to lighten up. Thus the movie gives its school principal not only a valid point about the efficacy of teaching from the standardized "civil rights binder," but a playful moment where she collects Mr. Dunne's chewing gum in her bare hand, the instructor looking all the more like just another boundary-pushing kid. Authority, in and out of the classroom, is expected to have the answers. Half Nelson tentative even in its titleis more than honest enough to settle for genuine uncertainty: It asks whether genuine uncertaintythe vague sense that modern life is too complicated to address or even understandis going to cut it as the world burns. Gosling's second tour de force moment in the film comes when the crackhead teacher, midway through telling Drey's drug-dealing surrogate dad (Anthony Mackie ) that the girl needs more positive role models, gets a glimpse of his own privileged hypocrisy and starts acting doubtful. "I don't know, I don't know," the teacher says, throwing his arms aloft. Half Nelson  is named for the wrestling move by which an opponent's own strengths are used against him. Mr. Dunne's strength as a teacher is his weaknessas well as a metaphor.
