Curb Your Enthusiasm 's Jeff Garlin makes his feature writing-directing debut in I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With , a wry movie that, packed with his well-known friends and scored intermittently to bouncy accordion music, plays like a softer episode of Curb . He stars as a Chicago actor hoping for love and weight loss, and the movie would feel too wispy and minor if not for a romantic subplot matching him with Sarah Silverman as a crazy ice cream vendor. Garlin's the first director to really exploit the menace behind Silverman's funny-hot-chick persona; if only for a scene or two, the results cut surprisingly deep.


 Imagine Larry David’s HBO’s series, “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” without the bile. That’s the tone of “I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With,” the rambling debut feature by Jeff Garlin, a “Curb” regular and one of its executive producers.  Mr. Garlin wrote, directed and stars in this feature, playing James Aaron, a veteran of the Second City improv troupe in Chicago who still lives with his mother (Mina Kolb). He fidgets through Overeaters Anonymous meetings, turns down auditions arranged by his impatient agent (Richard Kind), obsesses over landing the lead in a remake of his favorite movie, “Marty,” and gads about town with his best friend and partner in sarcasm, Luca (David Pasquesi).  He also develops a mild crush on a droll, jazz-loving teacher (Bonnie Hunt) and falls hard for a shockingly funny ice cream parlor employee (Sarah Silverman).  But James’s inevitable personal growth takes a back seat to Mr. Garlin’s digressive sense of humor. The movie carves out space for a late-night candy-hunting trip to a drugstore (where James sees a successful but pompous and neurotic colleague, brilliantly played by Wallace Langham) and a hilarious encounter with another fellow actor (the reliably excellent Joey Slotnick), who is handing out free hot dog samples while wearing a pirate outfit with a huge papier-mâché head.  Laid back and affectionate, “Cheese” is the movie version of a dear friend you could spend all day with.

Curb Your Enthusiasm's" Jeff Garlin has adapted his solo stage show into a fully-cast, running-gag version of "Marty." "I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With" could benefit from either more or less plot: Story of a fat comedian who still lives with his mother, eats obsessively and can't find a girlfriend never completely takes off, yet somewhat overestimates the surrounding zaniness. Still, any opportunity to witness the improvisatory skills of Sarah Silverman, Bonnie Hunt and Amy Sedaris should not be missed. Sure to amuse fans of Second City-type humor, pic won't wow but will definitely please.
Garlin's laid-back performance (in contrast to the hamminess of alter-ego Jackie Gleason, often glimpsed on a background TV) generously grants center stage to Silverman's slightly psychotic ice-cream parlor waitress, Hunt's sweetly askew schoolteacher and Sedaris' off-the-wall counselor. And lesser-known "Second City"-alumnus David Pasquesi, as Garlin's sardonic sidekick, almost steals the show. Chicago-set pic abounds in rhythm-perfect soft-shoe exchanges, as Silverman takes romance-minded Garlin on a sexual roller-coaster, or grocery counterman Dan Castellaneta gently tries, for the umpteenth time, to wean Garlin from junk food.

Sitcoms about nothing, mumblecore moviesis the thematic three-act structure really dead, and if so, should we say good riddance? Either way, if you're into the formless baring of the innermost self, you could do a lot worse than Curb Your Enthusiasm   star Jeff Garlin 's sweetly tender peregrination, based on his one-man show on being a fat, gig-less, and lonely actor in search of someone to love. Jeffor is it "Jeff"? drifts around Chicago playing straight man to an unlimited supply of neurotics and lunatics, most of them played by Curb  and Second City  buddies like Bonnie Hunt , Amy Sedaris , and David Pasquesi . Sarah Silverman no stranger herself to the aimless lifeplays a crimson-bra'd nut job and love interest with a cruel streak you'll have no trouble recognizing from her own body of work. There's nothing radically new about Garlin's observation that life is governed by absurdities and non sequiturs, but what sets this movie apart from the pack is that it's ruefully self-aware rather than self-conscious. I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With  may be one of the wisest studies of urban loneliness since Paddy Chayefsky 's Marty  (which figures in the movie as a remake starring boy-band alum Aaron Carter ), as well as the least condescending to little old Jewish mothers, who drive the story more than you'd think.
