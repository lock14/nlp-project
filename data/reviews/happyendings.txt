''Happy Endings" has a rather unhappy start. A woman named Mamie Toll runs out of a subdivision cul-de-sac into oncoming traffic, and is promptly struck by a car.
The scene is all the more upsetting because the woman playing Mamie is Lisa Kudrow, the smart comedic actress who seems to have skidded into a masochistic streak, enduring humiliation on HBO's gimmicky ''The Comeback." This movie, a blackish comedy written and directed by Don Roos, also has a nagging, albeit less painful gimmick.
After Kudrow is hit by that car, the screen splits and a reassuring title comes up. ''She's not really dead," it reads. ''No one dies in this movie." These pop-ups appear often enough throughout the film to warrant status as the cheekiest, most omniscient member of a crack ensemble that includes Laura Dern, Steve Coogan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tom Arnold, who's actually very good. The pop-ups are in Roos's voice. The trouble with them is that they intrude on the film's interwoven trilogy of Los Angeles stories.
''Happy Endings" is shuffled among three tales of love and parenting, secrets, lies, and manipulation. After Mamie is hit, the film rewinds to explain what led to her running down the road in a panic. Not long before, she received a cryptic note from Nicky (Jesse Bradford), a young documentary filmmaker who claims to know the son she gave up for adoption 19 years ago. If she wants Nicky to give her the boy's name, she has to agree to let him film the reunion for his application to the American Film Institute. Appalled but intrigued, Mamie offers an alternative movie about her boyfriend, Javier (Bobby Cannavale), an immigrant masseur from Mexico who finishes off some female clients with the erotic bonus of the movie's title.
Meanwhile across town, Mamie's stepbrother, Charlie (Coogan), is convinced that his good friends Pam (Dern) and Diane (Sarah Clarke) have surreptitiously used the sperm of Charlie's boyfriend, Gil (David Sutcliffe), to father their young son.
Not far away is the movie's most interesting story. It features Otis (Jason Ritter), the 22-year-old who runs the karaoke nights at Charlie's restaurant. His band's lead singer, a grifter named Jude (Gyllenhaal), beds him, then threatens to tell his wealthy widower father, Frank (Arnold), that he's gay. To please her, they concoct a scheme that keeps Otis's dad in the dark and allows her to live in their home, where she instigates an affair with Frank.
In his three tales, Roos appears to have conceived, respectively, a short film, a bad episode of television drama, and the material for a decent French novel. He's blended them seemingly in the hope that each will amount to more in the others' company. As tidily and ''happily" as this movie winds up, it seems like a draft for a project Roos is still working out. Even when the running commentary offers poignant news of what will happen to these people in the years ahead, ''Happy Endings" feels as overwrought and curiously weightless as Roos's previous pictures, ''The Opposite of Sex" and ''Bounce."
This isn't because the acting doesn't have any heft. The cast is strong. Kudrow and Gyllenhaal provide the movie's emotional center, and the film doesn't stint on giving either enough to do.
Roos does have a firm grasp on his characters. Their secrets provide protection against complete vulnerability, and, more than once in this film, their desperate and retaliative disclosures are comparable to chewing off an arm to evade danger. But whenever possible, Roos opts for smugness over introspection. These people can perceive the bad in others, but none can glimpse it in themselves.

         "Happy Endings" opens with a hysterical Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) running down a suburban street and straight into the path of an oncoming car. As she lies on the pavement covered in blood, her stepbrother Charley (Steve Coogan) hovering anxiously, a title card splits the screen in half. "She's not dead," it reads. "Nobody dies in this movie. It's a comedy, sort of."
 
  Arriving seven years after "The Opposite of Sex," Don Roos' pitch-dark, kick in the teeth of a first feature, "Happy Endings" is as bawdy, self-conscious, jaded and still sweetly optimistic as its double-entendre of a title suggests. It's basically a loose cluster of stories about Angelenos in various stages of romantic disaffection and flux. (And, yes, one of them is a massage therapist.)
 


         






    The omniscient (and sassy) title cards pop up like mushrooms as the characters are introduced — spilling their secrets, digging up old dirt, foretelling their futures — then abate until near the end of the movie. Killing a little suspense here, inserting a sad fact into a light moment there, the title cards serve as perverse instructions to maintain a critical distance from the fiction on screen. If Roos' lost, hapless characters and talented cast (including an adorable Jason Ritter and a surprisingly endearing Tom Arnold) are too involving for that to be entirely possible, they are still a decent reminder that, ultimately, "Happy Endings" is a story about stories, and their function in helping us get through in life.
 
  Mamie, we learn, is a divorced, lonely-despite-not-being-alone therapist who works as a counselor at an abortion clinic. As a teenager, she got pregnant by Charley, and secretly gave the baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion as she'd planned to do. Charley, who is gay and managing a restaurant he inherited from his father, is floating in a sludge of domestic torpor with his partner, the smug and supercilious Gil (David Sutcliffe).
 
  Mamie is approached out of the blue one day by a young guy named Nicky (Jesse Bradford), who offers to introduce her to her child if she'll let him film the reunion as an application to film school. Instead, she offers the trumped-up story of her boyfriend, Javier (Bobby Cannavale), a Mexican massage therapist who pretends to be a sex worker for the benefit of the admissions department at AFI.
 
  As Mamie gets increasingly involved with Nicky, Charley begins to suspect that Gil is the father of their best friends' Pam (Laura Dern) and Diane's (Sarah Clarke) son, and devises an elaborate lie to find out. Meanwhile, his wistful employee Otis (Ritter) pines for romance, as for that matter does Frank (Arnold), Otis' rich, widowed dad, whose guilelessness and good intentions make him an easy mark.
 
  When his band's lead singer goes into rehab, Otis asks Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) to fill in, an opportunity she quickly twists to blackmail Otis and catapult herself into Frank's affections. Roos' trenchant humor — a pair of tombstones belonging to Mamie's mother and stepfather, for instance, bear the cursive inscription "Don't Drink and Drive" — is still in evidence, but his empathy toward his characters seems to have deepened in the years between his films.
 
  The characters can be divided, more or less down the middle, into your classic sharks and turkeys, but neither side bears the brunt of the ridicule, opprobrium or scorn. Much of the humor in "Happy Endings" is drawn from its most painful moments, when the characters realize to their horror that they've made a big, irreversible, life-altering mistake.
 
  Why aren't there more American movies like this? I mean smart, unpretentious, sophisticated, un-condescending and cheap. One throwaway scene like the one in which sanctimonious alterna-hipster parents Diane and Pam move to Pittsburgh and "go back on sugar" is worth 10 of Tom Cruise trying to avoid being mistaken for an alien juice box.
 
  "Happy Endings" lives up to its title not because Roos rigs it that way — some of the characters don't find love, others do and (title cards) die young — but because he trusts they'll end up exactly where they're supposed to.

There are pleasing outcomes for almost everyone in Happy Endings , and that's not good news. Writer-director Don Roos sets up a game board's worth of dysfunctional characters in his arch trifle of a romantic comedy  as in his much sharper debut, The Opposite of Sex , he's entranced by the overlap of gay and straight lifestyles among sophisticates who don't bat an eye at such muddle. And then he lets them make fools of themselves, desiring the wrong people, things, and L.A. signifiers before stumbling into what suits them (and the narrative game board) best. There's something bitter about the fun Roos has at his players' expense, as if he's trivializing their troubles.
And then there are, you know, wink wink, happy endings as well, involving sex and its potential for making people act really foolishly. Take Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) and her stepbrother, Charley (Steve Coogan), whose teenage escapades resulted in pregnancy. Now Charley is gay and living with Gil (David Sutcliffe). And Mamie, who is carrying on with her Mexican masseur boyfriend (Bobby Cannavale), is being blackmailed by an aspiring documentary filmmaker (Jesse Bradford) who claims to have information about the son Mamie gave up for adoption years ago.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a punk adventuress who seduces a young gay musician (Jason Ritter) as well as his rich father (Tom Arnold). Laura Dern plays Charley's lesbian best friend whose son may or may not be the happy ending for Gil's donated sperm. Trouble is, every character in Roos' universe plays at having problems in a homo-hetero-Angeleno world but lacks substance, each little more than a composite of quirks and one-liners  a hip ensemble cast playing games further embroidered by the regular appearance of title cards that comment on the action. Still, there are three felicitous developments to report in this bliss-deficient project: Gyllenhaal is as wonderfully, naturally slouchy-sexy as her character is artificial and also turns out to be a riveting torch singer; Arnold is impressively vulnerable and honorable as the story's one guileless man; and as she was in The Opposite of Sex , Kudrow is a heartbreaker, and a muse.

 It's possible that Maggie Gyllenhaal will never become a major star, but there isn't an American actress in movies today who holds the screen with as much deep-seated soul. In Don Roos's slyly subversive "Happy Endings," a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, Ms. Gyllenhaal plays Jude, a heartbreaker whose throaty voice was made for torch songs and drama. Adrift in a melancholic haze, with pixie hair and long, loose limbs, her eyes rimmed with liner and worry, Jude looks a lot like a doll, one that knows she is fated to be forgotten.  An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, "Happy Endings" centers on two complementary characters: Jude and Mamie, an older woman played by Lisa Kudrow. Just south of 40, with no life partner or children, Mamie works as a counselor in an abortion clinic. She's distracted and disengaged even at home, where she wanders through rooms that have all the warmth and personality of a Hyatt. It's a measure of her profound disconnection that when she receives a massage from a smoothie named Javier (Bobby Cannavale), who also turns out to be her lover, she flinches under his touch. For her, the land of the living is dangerous territory.  Mamie and Jude meet only once, near the end, but their lives form parallel lines from almost the start of the story. The film opens with a literal bang as a woman we will soon know as Mamie, breathless and convulsively weeping, runs smack into an oncoming car. Mr. Roos, who wrote as well as directed the film, quickly assures us with some printed text that this is not the promised happy ending of the title and that the bloodied woman isn't dead: "No one dies in this movie, not on screen. It's a comedy, sort of." This annotation, which takes the shape of white-lettered words set against a slab of black, both diffuses the tension (Lisa Kudrow lives!) and underscores the filmmaker's personal stake in the story. He may be off-screen but he is never less than acutely present.  Mr. Roos, whose previous films include the nimble ensemble comedy "The Opposite of Sex" and, less happily, a romantic misfire called "Bounce," does well with a crowded canvas. If it takes a while to figure out that this new film is as much about Jude as Mamie, it's partly because there are other juicy characters jostling for attention. Among the most central are Mamie's  brother, Charley (Steve Coogan), who comes equipped with a lover, Gil (David Sutcliffe), and two friends, Pam and Diane (Laura Dern and Sarah Clarke), lesbians with a 2-year-old son on whom everyone dotes. At one time, Gil had been in the running to become the child's father, a road not taken that he and Charley peer down with uneasy wistfulness.  Sons and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and lovers, gay and straight, adopted and sperm-banked - "Happy Endings" is a road map to the way we live now. Mamie and Charley are actually  step-sister and -brother, but they share a history that goes deeper than family ties. The absolute depth of their connection emerges after Mamie is approached by a would-be documentary filmmaker, Nicky (Jesse Bradford), who wants to force her into an on-camera reunion with the son she gave up at birth. (Nicky thinks the reunion will be his ticket to film school.) Years earlier, in a spasm of teenage lust, Mamie had laid the foundation for her life: she had given birth to a child whose absence would become the hole in her heart.  Mr. Roos has a screwball director's sense of timing and a writer's love for the well-turned phrase. Smartly, he lets the director hold sway over the writer, a bent  that is most obvious in the economic way he keeps his characters in rotation. The filmmaker moves the narrative center of gravity seamlessly from Mamie and Charley to Charley and Gil to, ever so briefly, Charley and an eager pup named Otis (Jason Ritter). A rhythmically challenged musician who works at Charley's restaurant, Otis becomes the bridge to Jude, whom he meets at work while she's singing karaoke. Rootless, Jude follows Otis home, where she soon becomes involved with his wealthy  widower father, Frank (a wonderfully poignant Tom Arnold), and ushers the story into surprising depths.  Ensembles this large tend to be unwieldy or overly schematic, often both, but Mr. Roos is enough of a craftsman (and a mainstream filmmaker) that he never lets the seams show. It's worth noting that although ensemble movies take place in different geographies, multilinear stories like this one seem particularly attractive to filmmakers working in the sprawling, decentered cities of Los Angeles and London. There are probably all sorts of reasons for this, including the vagaries of fashion (and Robert Altman's long shadow). But one obvious advantage of bringing characters together in this fashion is that it allows filmmakers to create microcosms of the world. It also allows some filmmakers to indulge in the fantasy of "community," surely one of the most denuded words in the contemporary American lexicon.  Mr. Roos doesn't pretend that a collection of spiky, selfish, self-serving individuals, even a group as white and comfortably situated as the one he has concocted, necessarily makes a community. In a lot of ensemble films, the moral of the story is that everyone is lonely, but at the end of the day and those empty nights, no one is alone. Mr. Roos doesn't peddle such off-the-rack comfort. In "Happy Endings," everyone is always alone, whether in the arms of lovers or curling into solitude. That makes the filmmaker sound somewhat of an art-house existentialist. But Mr. Roos is more radical than that stereotype because, against the tide of independent fiction film, he remains alert to the truth that the personal is the political.  It would be difficult to explain just how Mr. Roos raises that tattered old feminist flag without giving everything away, and it's possible that even the mention of this particular F-word may do more harm than good to this movie. Suffice it to say that when Mr. Roos shows Jude exercising one of her constitutionally protected rights, he is not indulging in melodramatic excess. He is making a statement about how our choices define who we are, for better and worse. In that respect, it's never clear if Mamie ever understands the mistakes she made. But it's a mark of Mr. Roos's generosity that this fretful, difficult loner is as much the heroine of this story as Jude, a woman whose ending may not be happy, but whose self-determination is.  "Happy Endings" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some strong language, adult themes and a little recreational pot smoking.
Long ago packaged as Neil LaBute  lite, Don Roos  has nevertheless proved a sucker for heart-clutching finales. His new movie is named for such endingsand also, take note, for massage parlor orgasms. Received as an inauspicious beginning when it opened this year's Sundance, Happy Endings  is another Magnolia  manqué, an overlapped triptych designed to convince us that life is chock-full of coincidences that we'd regard with awe if only we could look closer and see them. This variation has a motif, of sorts: All three stories involve women who exploit gay men for sex or pregnancy. The first consummation is seen in a prologue, as 17-year-old Mamie (ultimately played by Lisa Kudrow ) beds her British stepbrother Charley (soon to be Steve Coogan ), an encounter that, to Mamie's great satisfaction, results in conception. "I only did it to get out of this house!" she cries, showing a kinship with Christina Ricci 's Dede, who pursued a similar strategy in Roos's The Opposite of Sex .
Two decades later, Mamie is an abortion counselor (and massage enthusiast) facing blackmail from an aspiring documentary filmmaker (Jesse Bradford ) who knows her pregnancy wasn't really terminated and views the prospect of a mother-son reunion as his ticket to an AFI scholarship. Meanwhile, Charley copes with his own familial woes, paranoid that his lesbian friends (Laura Dern  and Sarah Clarke ) duplicitously conceived their child with his boyfriend's sperm. In the third strand, karaoke crooner Jude (an unusually hateful Maggie Gyllenhaal ) sets a different kind of parent trap, condomlessly seducing her not so closeted bandmate (Jason Ritter ) in order to cozy up to his wealthy father (Tom Arnold ). Roos forecasts and explains every development with a title card, a device not unlike having someone yammering in your ear throughout the entire feature run time. In a more self-effacing director's commentary, he might have asked us, at least, to forgive the pun. Ben Kenigsberg
