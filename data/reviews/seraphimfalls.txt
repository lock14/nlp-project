For seven years, during his tenure as James Bond, Brosnan was the victim of his own good fortune: Under contract to play the Hollywood personification of simmering male sexuality, wit, and sophistication, he never seemed able or willing to test himself and try his luck with a real person. Now, on paper this might not sound so bad (surely there are worse things in this world than getting stuck playing James Bond), but it must be a somewhat unrewarding acting experience embodying perfection all the time. One can only hope that Brosnan was keeping his eye out for a challenging, juicy role while racking up all those untold millions as Britain�s most famous spy and Omega watch pitchman � a role that would allow him to dig down in the dirt and get his hair mussed and his soul cleaned. If that�s true, then he�s found some salvation in Gideon, the 19th century antihero of Seraphim Falls
, who is everything Brosnan�s Bond wasn�t. Bearded like a Jack London hero, weather-beaten, uncouth, detached, and all but indifferent to the fine art of speaking, he�s little more than an animal, shot in the shoulder within the film�s first minute and then hunted down through snow and desert over the course of the next 114 by violent men whose lives he extinguishes one by one without care. By the film�s five-minute mark, when Gideon is half naked in the cold, howling like a beast as he cauterizes a wound with a red-hot hunting knife, we know that Brosnan has officially exorcised 007 and put him out of his misery forever � buried, as it were, in his best tuxedo and bow tie. Good riddance, too. Because with Seraphim Falls
, Brosnan shows himself, finally, to be an actor of real skill � rather than just a pretty face, a great head of hair, and a buttery British accent � capable not only of playing a real human being but one with a tortured soul and a dodgy past as well. Meditative, beautifully shot, and blessed with a healthy dose of cynicism, Seraphim Falls
 is a morality play without the morality and a Western Purgatorio
 that, in the end, demands its protagonists resign themselves to their loneliness and brutality and avail themselves of the redemptive power of sheer exhaustion.

         Pierce Brosnan, looking suitably woolly and grizzled, stars as a man on the run from his past in the period suspense western "Seraphim Falls." A beautifully shot chase film by writer-director David Von Ancken and co-writer Abby Everett Jaques, it moves along with minimalist efficiency before running out of gas during an overlong allegorical final section.
 
  The film opens with Brosnan's character, a laconic man named Gideon, camped high atop Nevada's snow-covered Ruby Mountains (though the film was shot primarily in New Mexico) in 1868, with the Civil War looming ominously in the past. The peak's cool silence is soon broken by the sound of bullets, one of which rips into Gideon's bicep. He flees head-over-boots down the mountain and the hunt is on. His pursuers are the equally taciturn Carver, played with quiet gravity by Liam Neeson, and four hired guns. Carver forebodingly wants to capture Gideon alive — he gives strict orders to only aim for extremities — and therein lies the film's tension. Exposition is doled out judiciously, and we learn about the characters mainly through their actions. Gideon, for instance, is lethally proficient with a knife, and while firearms come and go, his trusty blade remains, taking on symbolic significance.
 


         






    Brosnan and Neeson make fine adversaries mining the terse dialogue for veiled dramatic fervor. The supporting players are also well-cast, with veteran character actors Michael Wincott and Ed Lauter as two of Carver's mercenaries, Tom Noonan as a wagon-train missionary and Anjelica Huston and Wes Studi making dreamlike appearances late in the film.
 
  The setup is simple and familiar but one that is instantly intriguing. Von Ancken adeptly exploits it for more than an hour but may have been better served by letting some of the past remain enigmatic. Once Carver's reasons for stalking Gideon are made clear through a flashback, the film shifts to a hallucinatory style. The mountains and prairie of earlier scenes, which John Toll's cinematography exploits to full advantage, give way to the dry, cracked floor of a desert.
 
  It's an apt setting for Gideon and Carver's final, Sartrean standoff, but the pas de deux goes on for far too long, draining the movie of whatever tension remained. The mystery that had fueled the film is gone, and we are left with a forced artiness that seems at odds with the film's earlier naturalistic tone.
 

 
  "Seraphim Falls." MPAA rating: R for violence and brief language. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes. At selected theaters.   

In movies like The Tailor of Panama  and The Matador , Pierce Brosnan has received credit, and justly so, for letting his belly hang out and for mocking his expensively debonair lounge-lizard twinkle. Yet what no one will quite come out and say is what a damn fine actor he is. Just watch him in the opening minutes of Seraphim Falls , a brooding Western revenge psychodrama that's set right after the Civil War.
As Gideon, a former Union captain who is being chased by a man with a personal vendetta, Brosnan survives a gunshot and then a plunge into icy waters. When he emerges, traipsing through a wintry mountain forest (the film was shot in New Mexico), he's so frozen it takes all the strength and concentration he has to extract the gunpowder from three bullets to light a campfire, then to use a knife to wedge the bullet out of his wound. Brosnan, swathed in a Grizzly Adams beard, makes you feel every frigid shiver, every tremble of his hands. As he performs surgery on himself in a scene that we've all seen a hundred times before, he doesn't wing it with a wince; he brings the pain home. This is more than an acting stunt  it plugs you right into the movie. And that's a good thing, since Seraphim Falls  is one of those films that you might call no-frills. Another word for it would be basic. Or maybe just slow-moving.
Gideon's escape, and his pursuit by Morsman Carver (Liam Neeson), a recessive former Confederate colonel who carries a rifle as long and lean as he is, results in a weirdly austere art-pulp hybrid: McCabe & Mrs. Miller  meets Rambo . Brosnan has never looked this spooked. He gets you on his side, even though it's not until the end that we learn if Gideon is a good man. Neeson, who has more presence doing nothing than most actors do playing Hamlet, gives Carver hints of a psycho drive beneath his righteous scowl. He and Brosnan are supremely well-matched foils, though I do wish that the filmmaker, David Von Ancken, had lent his sparsely mythic tale just a twinge of something...new.


Seraphim Falls" looks like something out of the ordinary solely by virtue of its rarity, but in 1956, it would have been a solid but unexceptional revenge Western. An unforgiving man's relentless pursuit of a Civil War-era adversary is played out across a magnificent backdrop ranging from snow-packed mountains to the lifeless desert floor, and John Toll's cinematography ensures the action is worth watching. Aside from spasms of brutal violence, however, there's nothing rousing or new here; the names of well-cast leads Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan won't be enough to muster more than modest theatrical B.O. for this very physical but familiar oater.
Familiarity is entirely relative, of course. A large share of today's audience wasn't born when the "recent" major film this most resembles, Clint Eastwood's "The Outlaw Josey Wales," was released 30 years ago. Nevertheless, little in the original script by David Von Ancken and Abby Everett Jaques is fresh, from the dramatic format to the simple psychology and motivations of the characters; from the men's desire to say as few words as possible to the film's message of forgiveness.
Long opening set-piece is a grabber. In Nevada's Ruby Mountains in 1868 (except for the river rapids scenes, which were shot in Oregon, pic was entirely lensed in New Mexico), salt-and-pepper-bearded loner Gideon (Brosnan) is shot in the arm. Forced to abandon his horse and rifle, he tumbles down multiple snowbanks, falls into a frigid river, plummets over a waterfall and loses his heavy coat before extricating himself and excruciatingly removing the bullet with his outsized hunting knife and cauterizing the gaping wound.
With determined hunter Carver (Liam Neeson) and his four hired guns closing in, Gideon makes his way up a tall tree, from where, with expert aim, he manages to drop his knife smack into the forehead of one of his pursuers and then get away before the others find him, pausing only to cut the dead man's belly open to warm his own frostbitten hand.
So off they go across the imposing landscape, Gideon staying a step or two ahead of his pursuers, who diminish in number along the way. There are intimations that Gideon committed some horrible atrocity that has provoked Carver's undying hatred, but revelation of its specifics is saved for a climactic flashback.
In the meantime, Gideon shrewdly manages to turn adversity to his favor on several occasions, as he and his hunters cross paths with other humans, including a small pioneer family, fugitive bank robbers, a wagon train of the devout, railway workers, a cagey Indian trader and, saved to the end, Angelica Huston as a snake oil saleswoman wandering far from where she might find customers.
For what it is, pic goes on excessively, with one final showdown too many. Its physical beauty notwithstanding -- Toll's work, which emphasizes the blues and greens of the forests, is always a pleasure to behold -- the film lacks a distinctive visual style, especially toward the end, when some hallucinatory heightening would have been in order. Gideon's frequent physical pain is palpable, and the killings are gruesome, but this motif doesn't translate into a feeling of pervasive harshness comparable to that found in, say, Anthony Mann's frontier pictures, such as "The Naked Spur," another film to which "Seraphim Falls" bears a passing resemblance.
For genre fans, however, a new Western is always welcome, and TV vet Von Ancken, in his theatrical feature debut, makes its way through some of the conventions with relative dexterity.
Of the two rugged Irish stars, Brosnan, for all his character's discomfort, seems to be having the better time. His lankiness sometimes reminding of James Coburn, whose turn in "The Magnificent Seven" also comes to mind thanks to Gideon's skill with a knife, Brosnan appears to relish his moments in the saddle as well as the gruff, minimal dialogue. For his part, Neeson also looks good out West but might have applied an extra edge of remorseless craftiness to his readings. (He also could have benefited from putting back the 20 pounds or more he appears to have lost of late).
As two of Carver's henchmen, Michael Wincott and Ed Lauter are perfectly cast for menace and treachery but aren't given enough to do make their roles indelible. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is solidly in the classical old-school tradition.

Really, you have to love the casting of Pierce Brosnan  and Liam Neeson two Irishmenas Civil War vets sprinting across the Western plains, with Neeson the pursuer and Brosnan the pursued. The whole project, filled with familiar faces (Angie Harmon , Anjelica Huston , other "Hey, it's that  guy!" actors) in teensy roles, reeks of old-fashioned Big Studio entertainmentthis could have been made sometime between, oh, 1953 and 1978, and danged if you (or your dad) wouldn't watch it on late-night TV. Directed by a maker ofno surpriseTV procedurals (David Von Ancken ), Seraphim Falls has decent pep in its step till the final 30 minutes, when it's finally revealed why Neeson's bounty hunter is after Brosnan's surly mountain man. The flashback finale and all that comes after (and keeps  on comin') drags on so long even the leads look exhausted. Till then, it's yet another replay of The Most Dangerous Game , and Brosnan and Neeson are game for it. The missus suggests Brosnan, who takes a dip in icy white water and treks from frigid mountaintops to arid deserts among his myriad deeds of derring-do, should have been paid a small fortune, since he "gets the shit beat out of him." Neeson, too, is a credible heroor is that villain? See, we're never sure who's who till the end, and even then Von Ancken ain't achin' to pick sides.
