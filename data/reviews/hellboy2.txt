It's not perfect � thank Satan! � but Hellboy II: The Golden Army
 is by far the most splendidly imaginative and creatively uncorked piece of fantastic cinema since the director's Pan's Labyrinth
 netted an Oscar trifecta in 2007. Given the success of that film, del Toro's budget is considerably larger this time, allowing him to indulge his genius for the freakish � Hellboy II
 is a visually breathtaking bestiary of everything that ever lurked under your childhood bed � while fleshing out (or in the case of the aquatic Abe Sapien, upscaling
) the "big red one" and his pals at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Co-scripted with wild abandon and plenty of heart by del Toro and the comic book's creator, Mike Mignola, this second Hellboy
 film outing finds the stogie-chompin', pussycat-lovin', Tecate-swillin' hell spawn defending an unsympathetic-as-ever mankind from the underworldly evils of bone-china-complexioned Prince Nuada (Goss, looking an awful lot like Edgar Winter's melanin-deficient offspring). Nuada seeks to own a golden crown which will allow him power over the legendary army of the title � a massive, subterranean legion of mechanical warriors that could tip the balance between man and not-man. Evil never rests, sure, but neither does Hellboy, who, along with his conflicted and eternally flaming love Liz (Blair), intellectual piscine Sapien (Jones, Pan's
 Fauno), stodgy bureaucrat Tom Manning (Tambor), and ectoplasmic newcomer Johann Krauss (Alexander and Dodd, voiced by Family Guy
's Seth MacFarlane), gives as good as he gets. There's much here for longtime fans and Hellboy
 newcomers to enjoy, not least of which is a perfectly pitched drunken duet by Hellboy and Sapien, to Barry Manilow's "Can't Smile Without You," no less. Both characters are having disparate relationship difficulties, but Sapien's bivalve heart, which has fallen for Prince Nuada's sister Nuala (Walton), is arguably the more achy-breaky. This brings us to del Toro and Mignola's ongoing theme � echoed in any number of superhero films and formats � of monsters who are more human than the flesh-and-blood humanity that surround them. That dichotomy has, of course, been a staple of cinema fantastique
 at least since James Whale's The Bride of Frankenstein
 (Karloff's "We belong dead" micromonologue can be briefly spotted here), but del Toro brings it front-and-center, imbuing these permanent outsiders-cum-saviors with a genuine emotional range and appeal that was rarely present in Mignola's original Dark Horse comic books. Crammed to bursting as it is with all manner of beasties and several subplots � a lengthy sequence in an underground troll market makes the cantina scene in Star Wars
 seem lazy by comparison � del Toro's film occasionally suffers from the fact that there's almost too much to keep up with. Complaining that you're sometimes overwhelmed with astonishing visuals and strange tales, however, is like whining there's too much icing on your birthday cake. All fantastic films should suffer such a fate.


Of all the comic book movies that have spun out of theaters this long and pulpy summer, Guillermo del Toro's "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is the most unapologetically comic book-y.
Thank goodness. No ironic Hollywood stars, no weighty character neuroses, no mid-movie dramatic twists sinking the fun like an anchor. "Hellboy II" is the anti-"Hancock," a blast of fanboy wit, style, imagination, and prodigious noise that comes on like heavy-bore pop art. Better, its title character is to mainstream heroes like Batman and Spider-Man what publisher Dark Horse Comics is to DC and Marvel: a scruffy, cigar-chomping upstart.
You don't need to have read the comics or seen 2004's "Hellboy" to play along, but here's the FAQ: Hellboy - actor Ron Perlman under a ton of glazed-ham makeup - is a demon raised from childhood by humans and currently employed by the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. (It's supposed to be top secret, but Hellboy has a bad habit of turning up on YouTube.)
He's short-tempered and sardonic but basically a good sort, keeping his horns sawed off and sharing quarters with girlfriend/human torch Liz (Selma Blair) and an aquatic empath - sort of a Creature From the Psychic Friends Network - named Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). Their job is to keep the occult legions (goblins, trolls, balrogs, you name it) from infesting the human world.
The elves, apparently, have had enough of this nonsense. The Kabuki-face Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) overthrows his father (Roy Dotrice) and embarks on a campaign to unleash a crew of unstoppable battle-bots called the Golden Army on mankind. Our heroes are called on to foil him, if Hellboy and Liz can stop arguing about his pet cats overrunning their apartment.
It all sounds terribly silly, and it all plays like a charm, because the cast stays in the spirit (tongue-in-cheek but committed), and because del Toro lets his inner comics-freak rip. The Mexican-born director hit the big time with 2006's "Pan's Labyrinth," but he has always balanced his art-house side ("The Devil's Backbone") with gonzo genre work ("Blade II"), and here the two come close to blending entirely.
If you've seen "Pan's Labyrinth," you'll recognize the visual design of the various nasties in "Hellboy" as the product of del Toro's brain and sketchpad: weathered faces lacking eyes, molting wings with eyes, a gargoyle who has a miniature cathedral growing out of his head. There are tooth fairies, but you'd better pray they don't get anywhere near the children.
In one scene a gargantuan, plant-like "elemental" stalks lower Manhattan, towering over the buildings like Hieronymus Bosch's rethink of the Jolly Green Giant. When it's wounded, flowers and moss spring up from its blood - a touch of unexpected lyricism amidst the mayhem.
Indeed, you may wonder whose side del Toro and his co-writer, "Hellboy" creator Mike Mignola, are on. The hero's job is to protect us helpless humans, but next to the elves and other eldritch beings, we're made to look puny and small-minded, turning on the big fella with mob fury in one scene. It's not pretty. Worse, it's not very believable.
"Hellboy" thankfully pulls back before he starts mewling like Peter Parker. Blair's Liz, though, has less to do than in the first film and more emotional water to carry, and the actress doesn't look too happy about it. "Hellboy" is more successful at building a romance between Abe and the villain's twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton); they're two delicate souls carving out a quiet space (complete with Tennyson verse) between the crashes and ka-booms.
Another character I wish we'd seen more of is Johann Krauss, a German paranormal specialist imported by the BPRD to keep Hellboy on a leash. He turns out to be a psychopathic gas - a ghost - inside a diving suit, and he looks for all the world like Darth Vader without a head. Two actors, John Alexander and James Dodd, are credited with his physical movements, but the persnickety Teutonic voice comes from Seth MacFarlane of "Family Guy," who gives the rivalry between retentive Krauss and explosive Hellboy the topspin of classic vaudeville patter.
"Hellboy II" is bigger, louder, and a smidgen more mainstream than the first movie, and I expect hard-core fans of the comic won't like it as much. There are signs of tired sequelitis in the personal dilemma Liz faces halfway through, in Jeffrey Tambor's officious BPRD bureaucrat, and in the way the clanky plot outstrips the wit in the final scenes.
The movie's rescued time and again, though, by the soulful swagger of Perlman's performance - he plays Hellboy like a smarter Thing or a fully self-actualized Hulk - and by del Toro's flair for the baroque. The filmmaker loves the tatty pop energy of comic books, their speech-balloon dialogue and muscular sense of fantasy. He knows that on the page, as on the screen, you can draw anything and make it spring madly to life.

The director Guillermo del Toro loves creatures. Big, squishy mutants and dreamy monsters. Otherworldly tentacled zomboid beasties. He's a master at creating them, a talent that I would not hesitate to call childlike; it's also a gift well-suited to our era. Del Toro can win awards for a highbrow Night Gallery  episode like Pan&#39;s Labyrinth   , with its fantastical images and fascism-is-bad message, and he can then turn around and make a hard-driving psychedelic action-movie fantasia like Hellboy II: The Golden Army , about a domesticated devil hulk and his superfreak comrades.
In Hellboy II , del Toro pushes his fetish for all things weird and shape-shifty to the extreme; he makes us feel childlike, too. You can taste the ripeness of his imagination when you see the new addition to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense team: a German scientist named Johann Krauss, who consists entirely of...gas. (He lives in a robot suit, to give the fumes some form, and his voice is provided by Family Guy   's Seth MacFarlane, for that hint of Hogan's Heroes  kitsch.)
Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the stogie-sucking demon of a crime fighter, with his sawed-off underworld horns and mighty stone edifice of a giant right fist, is now plunged into a cosmic culture war. An ancient race, led by the pasty scoundrel Prince Nuada (Luke Goss  , in a performance that suggests Marilyn Manson played by Tilda Swinton), has declared a holy war on all of humanity. To achieve his apocalyptic vision, Nuada must gather the three sections of a mystical crown, which will activate the Golden Army, a phalanx of clanking medieval robots, each with a chest cavity full of glowing industrial fire.
That's quite an image of sinister magic, and Hellboy II  has a lot more of them. The plot is really a fancy excuse for del Toro to keep forging his close encounters of the squirmy kind. New York gets attacked by a giant plant-monster (it has the head of a praying mantis and vines for limbs), which would have looked right at home in a '50s atomic-schlock horror film, and in Ireland there's a warlock gatekeeper who reveals a face that's a blade of flesh  as well as wings speckled with eyes, an image to give Salvador Dalí pause. The film's digital-effects artists deserve props, but what makes a creature feature like Hellboy II  so much more exciting than, say, The Incredible Hulk    is that del Toro's inventions don't just have ''attitude.'' They have temperament. Their personalities seem to have emerged right out of their skewed, fairy-tale-on-acid physiognomies.
That's true of the movie's heroes as well. Hellboy, with his skin the color of tandoori chicken, has a red-hot temper to match, and Perlman, who's even funnier  more grumpily assured  than he was in the first Hellboy   , has mastered a tone of self-deprecatory wise-guy blues; if you can forget how he looks, he sounds  like George Clooney after a rough night. Hellboy's sad comedy is his deep-down normalcy  the fact that no one sees past his facade. No one, that is, but Liz (Selma Blair  ), the outwardly normal girl who loves him because she's got some major hellfire of her own: She ignites like a human cigarette lighter, and Blair, glaring through those orange flames, lets you know that she's as angry as that fire is. Abe Sapien, the epicene British gill-man played with courtly grace by Doug Jones, has been given a love interest  the evil prince's twin sister (Anna Walton)  which only heightens his anachronistic pained delicacy. When he and Hellboy sing a lonely, drunken duet to Barry Manilow's ''Can't Smile Without You,'' it's a priceless moment, because it's really tweaking the hidden torment of every superhero in history.
The Paranormal Research and Defense team is basically a kinkier version of the X-Men    crew or the Fantastic Four  , but in Hellboy II  their collective oddity  familiar though it is  has an appealing, outsize grandeur. If the movie's plot is mostly comic-book boilerplate, del Toro stages all of the action brilliantly, whether he's choreographing an onslaught of skittery, spidery face-huggers or tracing the rhythmic, thrusting assault of flying swords. The Golden Army dazzles like something out of Jason and the Argonauts . To make a comic-book fantasy this derivative yet this dazzling requires more than technique. It takes a   director in touch with his inner hellboy.

 There are moments in “Hellboy 2: The Golden Army,” Guillermo del Toro’s profligate sequel to “Hellboy,” capable of delighting even the most jaded, comic-book-weary summer-blockbuster conscript. (That would be me.) Lately we have seen plenty of big, asphalt-smashing street battles between hero and nemesis — Tim Roth and Edward Norton, hopped up on military growth hormones, hurling cars across Harlem in “The Incredible Hulk”; Charlize Theron and Will Smith enacting some kind of meteorological superhero S & M in “Hancock” — but nothing quite like the scene in which Ron Perlman’s Hellboy, a baby in one hand and an oversize gun in the other, mixes it up with a giant, angry plant.  What makes that sequence memorable is not just the visual audacity of the stunts and effects, but also the weird animist vibe that the photosynthesizing fiend gives off. He might have sprung from the pastoral imagination of the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, if Mr. Miyazaki’s environmentalism inclined him toward anger rather than sorrow. And even after Hellboy carries out a necessary and brutal pruning, a moment of mourning is permitted. That raging vine, after all, was the last of an endangered species.  Which is not to say that “Hellboy 2” is exactly, or primarily, an ecological allegory, though it does have some twinklings of green consciousness amid all the red- and gold-hued mayhem. There is just too much else going on to single out any particular theme or mood, which is part of the movie’s charm and also, sometimes, a source of exasperation.  Mr. Perlman, painted bright red and outfitted with sawed-off horns and an extra-large fist, is happy to ignore the trappings of digital-era cinematic splendor and act like the cigar-chomping hero of an old black-and-white B picture. The script (and the comics by Mike Mignola that are the movies’  source) may identify the character as a demon exiled from the underworld, but as a movie archetype Hellboy is more like the gruff sergeant or the cynical gumshoe, with a soft heart, naturally, beating under the hard shell. In Mr. Perlman’s performance you catch glimpses of Bogey and Lee Marvin and hints of Robert Mitchum and George Kennedy, all blended with devilish glee and disarmingly sexy sincerity.  And the movie itself is similarly easygoing in its eclecticism. The story is a happy hodgepodge of bantering humor and portentous metaphysics, packing a remarkable range of moods and genre elements into a fairly compact 110 minutes. The love between Hellboy and the downcast, combustible Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) gives this film, like its precursor, an undercurrent of hard-boiled, noirish romanticism. There are also Tolkienish  elves (as Mr. del Toro limbers up for “The Hobbit”), officious bureaucrats and a showstopping Barry Manilow song washed down with many cans of Tecate beer. The whole affair is pulpy, jokey, sometimes touching and frequently nonsensical: a big mess and, mostly, a lot of fun.  An ancient truce between the elves and the humans has been broken by an angry blond elf-prince (Luke Goss), who robs an auction house and whose twin sister (Anna Walton) bleeds maple syrup whenever he is injured. Back at the top-secret paranormal government lab where Hellboy grouchily works, his put-upon boss (the indispensable Jeffrey Tambor) welcomes a new authority figure, the punctilious Dr. Johann Kraus,  a puff of gas with a creaky diving suit and a Prussian accent (voiced by Seth MacFarlane). Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Hellboy’s begilled foil and sidekick, returns and this time finds some romance of his own.  But enough summarizing. Mr. del Toro has made delicate, finely modulated films in the past (“The Devil’s Backbone” and “Pan’s Labyrinth,” most notably). Here, though, with a big budget to play with and a pop-culture franchise to tend, he lets abundance trump coherence.  Like the ancient king who builds an army of nearly 5,000 enchanted mechanical warriors (the Golden Army of the film’s title), this director is a compulsive and prodigious maker of creatures, and for this movie he seems to have opened up his notebooks and let his imagination run free. Around every corner is a strange new beast or gizmo, from the tiny, swarming “tooth fairies” who devour a room full of art collectors to the slimy denizens of the troll market, one of whom has what looks like an infant attached to its chest. “I’m not a baby, I’m a tumor,” the appendage explains.  “Hellboy 2” is not a great movie — its narrative is at once too busy and too perfunctory — but like that sassy little tumor, it is lovable in its prodigious grotesquery. It was made with the kind of heedless, geeky enthusiasm that has been drained out of the standard, somber superhero melodramas that crowd the multiplexes these days. It’s an artful, clever throwaway that may, over time, turn into a valuable collectible.  “Hellboy 2” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scary monsters, grown-up problems and salty lingo.

Curmudgeonly, cantankerous, cigar-chomping Hellboy is a cross between a '40s noir detective and a burning fireplace, but he's also cool enough to make "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" the hipster's hit of the summer. Yes, Catholic imagery has always run rampant through helmer Guillermo del Toro's movies, including "Pan's Labyrinth," which he made in between the two "Hellboy" entries, but he's really an evangelist of fanboy excess: Given the right push by Universal, he'll be making fantasy-horror acolytes out of the heretofore unconverted. 
In a previous life, del Toro might have been a maker of clocks -- clocks inhabited by gargoyles instead of cuckoos, and which exploded on the hour. But there's a precision to the visual ornateness of "Hellboy II" that exceeds even that of its predecessor. It's certainly a more deliberately (and successfully) funny movie, thanks largely to the drily ironic Hellboy -- Ron Perlman, who returns with the rest of the cast, and without whom an onscreen Hellboy would have been almost unthinkable.
Based on the comicbooks by del Toro's co-scripter, Mike Mignola, the pic finds Hellboy about to become Hell Man -- his incendiary girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) is pregnant, although she doesn't tell him till much later. But since we learn this at the beginning of the film, it shades everything that follows -- a elaborate sequence early on, in which Hellboy battles a towering green forest deity on the streets of New York while balancing a baby in his arms, gives us an indication of just what a caring, paternal figure the guy can be, despite looking like he's shrink-wrapped in red Naugahyde and has the temperament of a wolverine.
But the reason the movie plays so well has nothing to do with the leading man's paternal instincts; rather, it's rooted in del Toro's rococo instincts for the stylishly creepy and crawlingly macabre, his clockmaker's preoccupation with detail, and a flair for combining state-of-the-art technology with his taste for the antique, the gothic, the Catholic. Not to disparage the f/x guys, but what's onscreen in "Hellboy II" is all about the seismic eruptions in del Toro's head. Comparing his work to most fantasy cinema is like comparing cave drawings to the Cathedral of Cologne.
Still, "Hellboy II's" widespread popularity will be about the humor, which begins in a flashback to Christmas 1955, when the young Hellboy -- the progeny of a collaboration between the Nazis and Satan -- is awaiting Santa Claus. His father figure, Professor Broom (John Hurt), reads him a story, about an ancient people who created a Golden Army that was so invincible and ruthless it had to be retired; a pact made with the human race; and a crown divided -- two parts to the ancients, one to the humans, with the army in cold storage until the crown was reassembled.
This is a bedtime story? On Christmas Eve? But it serves as a preamble to what will follow some time later (50 years? These so-called people age well). Hellboy is working for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense alongside Liz and the Piscean Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and under the supervision of the unctuous Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) who urges Hellboy to keep his work quiet. Undercover. Clandestine. Be discreet! Naturally, the first big fight scene ends up with Hellboy crashing out of a burning building and onto a police car.
The instigator of all this mayhem is the otherworldly, martial-artsy Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), who wants his people to regain their rightful place in the order of things; his twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), knowing her bro is bonkers, sides with the humans and hides the key part of the crown. The results include chases, battles and a lot of quick-cooking mythology.
And, of course, creatures. Nuada is assisted by what seems to be a tusked gorilla with porcupine spindles on his back and an iron fist that turns into a medieval mace; the small, evil fairy-cockroaches that Nuada unleashes upon an unsuspecting crowd at an auction house (where the crown is up for bid) are efficiently carnivorous and natteringly unnerving.
The weak link in all this fun is Nuada himself. Goss embodies all the menace of Keanu Reeves, and his voice is roundly unimposing.
The movie bogs down only when the story leaves the city and heads for Ireland where, inexplicably, the Golden Army dwells. The army's awakening and combat is easily the least interesting sequence in the film -- the most conventionally chaotic and pedestrian. Hellboy's encounter with Nuada, atop a giant mechanism that looks like the insides of a cosmic watch, is invigorating. And probably the result of del Toro channeling one of his past lives in Switzerland.

Hollywood 's Endless Superhero Summer rolls on with the arrival of Hellboy II: The Golden Army   from Pan's Labyrinth  director Guillermo del Toro , but before this review goes any further, I must confess—head hanging low in shame—that I haven't read a comic book since I was 12 years old. That means I've never read a Hellboy  comic, the first of which appeared in 1993 (when I was well past 12). In fact, I'm not so sure I'd even heard of the big red lug until 2004, when del Toro made the first Hellboy  movie, although I bet at the time I pretended that I knew all about him. These days, not reading comics and graphic novels marks one as a pop-culture loser, which goes to show you how topsy-turvy the world is—in my day, comic-book kids got beat up.
A primer then, for the secretly uninitiated: Hellboy, or "Red," as his friends call him (played by Ron Perlman  in the films), is a demon from Hell (literally) who entered this earthly realm when Hitler 's minions opened a portal to you-know-where while attempting to form an alliance with the Big Guy down below. Rescued by the Allies and raised by a gentle British professor (John Hurt ), Hellboy has burnt-red skin, a long tail, thick horns on his forehead (filed down to stubs), and a massive right arm made of stone—the "Right Hand of Doom" in creator Mike Mignola 's comic. Red packs a mean right punch, but luckily, raised on Howdy Doody  and Santa Claus , he's fighting on the side of man, not with the evildoers who keep coming up from Hell to slay us all. Score one for nurture versus nature.
In the new flick, Hellboy and his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair ), who can turn herself into a ball of fire at will, are living in a government-run bunker belowManhattan, hunting demons. As Liz gets ready to announce her pregnancy, up pops the centuries-dead-yet-still-stylish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss , channeling David Bowie ), scouring Manhattan for a shard from a magic crown that, when reassembled, will raise the titular Golden Army, whose soldiers turn out to look like high-end, Neiman Marcus –catalog versions of Transformer toys.
Despite the rosary beads Red wraps around his wrist, Hellboy II  doesn't have much on its mind, but few will care since del Toro and his stellar Pan's Labyrinth  team, including Oscar-winning cinematographer Guillermo Navarro , stage one virtuoso set-piece after another. Chomping on his cigar, the otherwise uninteresting Red—I think I just got banned from this month's Comic-Con —hulks out against not only the vast Golden Army but tiny, pissed-off tooth fairies, a magnificent, multi-winged, multi-eyed Angel of Death (Doug Jones ), and, in the film's action centerpiece, a 70-foot forest demon that looks like a leaner, meaner cousin of Lord of the Rings ' mighty Treebeard. (Del Toro, of course, is set to direct The Hobbit  for LOTR  mastermind Peter Jackson .)
Smitten still with the movies of his youth, the 43-year-old del Toro joyfully references everything from the cantina in Star Wars  to the Alien  pod field to Ghostbusters ' marauding dough boy. A B-movie director (see: Mimic , Blade II ) with a touch of the poet about him (see: The Devil's Backbone ), del Toro was elevated to the status of capital-A artist with 2006's Pan's Labyrinth , a Nazi-era Through the Looking Glass  fantasy with underworld creatures so strange and wondrous that few seemed to notice how mean-spirited and unpleasant the film itself was. With this new Hellboy , del Toro is clearly coasting, and while there's no shame in having some summertime fun (and making some summertime money), the question hangs: Is del Toro a mad genius or an imaginative hack? Or both?
Time and hobbits should tell the tale, and in the meantime, the violent but gore-free Hellboy II: The Golden Army  will amaze 12-year-olds and amuse their parents, although at some point, one spouse may lean over and whisper to the other: "Wasn't that stretchy-faced demon with three eyes in Pan's Labyrinth ?" Maybe so, Marge, but wow, isn't it beautiful?
