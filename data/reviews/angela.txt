Having concentrated the last few years on writing and producing other people's movies ("The Transporter," "District B13 "), Luc Besson has taken a moment to grace us with a new work of his own.
The result is a small, bloodless black-and-white exercise, released in France two years ago, called "Angel-A." It's like Besson's other movies -- "The Big Blue ," "La Femme Nikita ," "The Fifth Element ," and the underrated "Joan of Arc " -- insofar as it's ludicrous. It's unlike them in a single crucial respect: the ludicrousness isn't any fun. He nonetheless appears pleased with this fairy tale of a suicidal Moroccan-born American named André (Jamel Debbouze ) and the mysterious, possibly heaven-sent woman called Angela -- played by the Danish former supermodel Rie Rasmussen -- who watches over him.
André owes money to a big bad gangster. Unable to pay, he elects to throw himself into the Seine. But before he leaps, he sees this platinum blonde derrick of a woman crashing into the water first, so he jumps in to save her, winning not just her thanks but her indentured servitude. Wearing a tight black minidress, she will help André get the money to pay his debts, using, of course, the only means Besson thinks a woman has. Soon she heads to a nightclub and proceeds to walk men from the dance floor to the loo. Cue moans of ecstasy and a growing mound of cash. Sigh.
The idea is that André -- whom Debbouze plays with aggravating nervousness -- is such a jellyfish that it takes this uninhibited celestial creature to give him a spine. There's nothing wrong with this; it's just that by now Besson's notions of comedy, action, and sex are so boring. He's a man capable of having a ball with the masculine and feminine energies swirling naturally in his heroines. "Nikita," "Fifth Element," and "Joan" were, in part, about that easy combination of the girlish and the pugnacious. "Angel-A" is all icky fantasy.
As a director he's usually best with bombast and action; he doesn't have the comedic finesse, artistic refinement, or even feigned wholesomeness to make this situation work. And whether she's straddling a chair or spin-kicking goons, Rasmussen is an action figure all the way. She's like a giant Michelle Pfeiffer but without that actress's peerless combination of grace and stress. The movie might have been more tolerable had Besson searched harder for a performer and not a specimen. Barbara Stanwyck in her prime might have made more sense.
In any case, this Angela doesn't behave like other angels before her -- Audrey Hepburn , perhaps, or Della Reese . She's a ride. And the movie practically self-destructs trying to make her into someone suffering an identity crisis. "I don't know who I am," she screams more than once. I do, Angie. You're an escapee from the Victoria's Secret's angel farm, and you're needed on the runway, immediately.


         Despite the seeming ubiquity of Luc Besson, it has been nearly eight years since a Besson-directed live-action film opened in the U.S. Busying himself with producing and/or writing a slew of high-octane (and highly profitable) action films such as the "Taxi" and "Transporter" series, he's never been far from the cinematic limelight following the extravagance of 1999's medieval epic "The Messenger — The Story of Joan of Arc." For his 10th directorial feature (Besson also recently directed the animated "Arthur and the Invisibles"), the French filmmaker dials things down considerably with a dopey, demimonde parable of self-acceptance, "Angel-A."
 
 The story of a desperate man given an opportunity at redemption, the film is the product of Besson rediscovering the city of Paris and lavishing upon it a black-and-white visual embrace (courtesy of director of photography Thierry Arbogast) that almost makes the whole thing worthwhile. The narrative isn't the most original, and it has a flimsy moral basis for its feather-light philosophizing, but coming from a filmmaker better known for stylish action fare such as "La Femme Nikita" and "Leon" (released in the U.S. as "The Professional") and overblown entertainments such as "The Fifth Element," it might qualify as pensive.
 


         






   Comedian-turned-actor Jamel Debbouze ("Amelie," "Days of Glory") plays André, a small-time North African criminal with a U.S. green card and a knack for lying and getting himself deeply in debt — the kind that gets you tossed off the Eiffel Tower for nonpayment. Under pressure from seedy Parisian underworld types, André tries to plead and con his way out of his predicament but to no avail.
 
 He finds himself perched on a bridge ready to drown himself in the Seine when he spies a woman thrashing about in the water, apparently a fellow suicide attempt. Temporarily snapped out of his own despondence, André leaps into the river and pulls her to safety.
 
 Her name is Angela, and she is no ordinary woman. Played by Danish model Rie Rasmussen (you may remember her as a brunet making out with Rebecca Romijn in "Femme Fatale"), she stands a full head taller than André and looks as if she stepped out of a teenage boy's fantasy, with legs up to here and a tiny black dress that barely covers there.
 
 Angela smokes like there's no tomorrow — it's banned where she comes from — and has some interesting ways to make some quick cash.
 
  The comically mismatched duo share some borderline metaphysical conversation that leans more toward Dr. Phil than Descartes and meander through a gorgeously shot, depopulated Paris (it's nearly as empty as London in "28 Days Later") with Angela teaching André the power of looking in the mirror and saying, "Je t'aime."
 
 Dialogue and two-handers have never been the forte of Besson — who, per the Internet Movie Database, has accumulated an astonishing 68 producing and 22 writing credits since "Messenger."
 
  Although  Angela is perfectly in line with any number of Besson heroines and does her share of derrière-kicking, the director's pacing seems adrift without his usual array of stunts and effects to fill the lulls.
 
 In essence, you get "It's a Wonderful Life" meets "Wings of Desire," swapping out the substance for self-help platitudes. If you can get past that, you can enjoy it as a 90-minute look at a  lovely postcard.
 
 
 "Angel-A." MPAA rating: R for language and some sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In French with English subtitles. In selected theaters.   

Angel-A  shows how director Luc Besson can be French in a way that even the French might despise. Take this awful concoction, set in a high-gloss Paris, in which André (Jamel Debbouze), a sawed-off Algerian loser  he's meant to be Chaplinesque, but comes off more like Luis Guzmán with heartburn  is rescued from self-hatred by his guardian supermodel (Rie Rasmussen), who's like an Aryan dominatrix out of Helmut Newton. Surely, she's the perfect messenger to deliver the news that it's the beauty inside  that counts. Quel  ick. And très  tedious.

 While watching Luc Besson’s comedy “Angel-A,” in which a leggy blond angel descends from on high to save the soul of a petty criminal who barely comes up to her shoulders, I had an unpleasant thought: if Hollywood got its hands on the story, Uma Thurman and Danny DeVito would be cast as the odd couple.  Not much charm there. Or worse: Daryl Hannah and Pauly Shore.  But Rie Rasmussen and Jamel Debbouze, the stars who portray Angela,  the celestial therapist, and André,  her star patient, display enough screwball romantic charm to keep this sugary trifle afloat longer than  you’d expect. Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, the movie, which shamelessly recycles “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Heaven Can Wait,”  suggests an episode of “Touched by an Angel”  without the tears.  Ms. Rasmussen, the Danish goddess familiar from Brian De Palma’s “Femme Fatale,” has a larger-than-life screen presence from which you can hardly avert your eyes. She radiates madcap mischief, blasé hauteur and erotic mystery in equal measure. Handsome and scruffy with brown puppy-dog eyes, Mr. Debbouze is best remembered by American audiences from the overrated Gallic bonbon “Amélie.”  “Angel-A,” filmed in ravishing black and white by Mr. Besson’s regular cinematographer, Thierry Arbogast, is a valentine to the City of Light, even more visually seductive than “Amélie” or the recent “Paris Je T’Aime.” In a scene where a loan shark’s goons dangle André, kicking and pleading for mercy,  off the girders of the Eiffel Tower, the Parisian vistas below are so inviting that you wonder if being dropped into this scenery might not be such a bad way to go.  André is a Moroccan-born American citizen (through the green-card lottery) who lives in Paris and is 40,000 euros in debt. He is given a very short deadline to raise the money, which he squandered on a failed business opportunity in Argentina. In despair, he visits one of Paris’s prettiest bridges, prepared to throw himself into the Seine. But as he is about to make the leap, the beautiful blonde on the next ledge jumps first. Instead of taking his own life, he saves hers.  Very early on it becomes apparent that Angela is not of this world. Her belated confession that she is an angel who has no memory of her former earthly identity comes as no surprise. For much of the rest of the movie, she tows André from gambling parlors to dance halls as she secures the money he needs, chain-smoking all the way. Angela is violent without hurting people. In a half-second whirl, she can spin around and leave a gang of thugs unconscious. An irresistible seductress, she can turn tricks all night long and look as if she just awoke from a refreshing beauty sleep.  Along the way she gives André impatient pep talks about self-esteem and his inner goodness. She teaches him to look into a mirror and say “I love you.” As André learns to like himself, he falls madly in love with Angela, who harbors her own secret sadness. But how does she really feel about him?  If you have to know and can’t guess already, then see “Angel-A.” It won’t hurt you, and it’s easy on the eyes.  “Angel-A” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and some sexual content. 

A two-hander in exquisite black-and-white, "Angel-A" is a fable about self-acceptance set in a ravishingly lensed, hauntingly vacant Paris. Luc Besson's first pic since 1999's "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" is his 10th directorial outing. This is good news for his detractors, since he has said he'll helm no more than 10. For his fans, "Angel-A" is an achingly sincere but protracted effort to trade mostly action for mostly dialogue. Beloved entertainer Jamel Debbouze in a bittersweet role will entice curious auds for modest but respectable B.O. Offshore sales likely will hinge more on local appetites for how Paris' beauty is captured than on the story. 
A sort of "It's an Adequate Life" with token bad guys, pic's tone is a bit as if the color-coded gangsters in "Reservoir Dogs" decided to get together and form a rainbow.
Debbouze ("Amelie") plays Andre, a 28-year-old downtrodden pipsqueak who owes tens of thousands of dollars to cruel creditors all over town. At pic's outset, three thugs give Andre until midnight to pay his E40,000 ($48,000) debt to their boss. Soon after, the sinister Franck (Gilbert Melki) has his men dangle Andre off the Eiffel Tower.
Andre, who considers himself to be an American on a technicality, finds no help at the U.S. Embassy. He then fails to convince the police to lock him up for his own protection.
Poised on one of the city's most photogenic bridges determined to end it all, Andre notices another would-be suicide: an impossibly statuesque blonde in a little -- really 
little -- black dress. She leaps into the Seine and Andre instinctively jumps in to rescue her. Cynics might say it's unlikely that a one-armed man in a wool overcoat (Debbouze lost the use of one arm in a youthful accident) could rescue anybody, but Andre drags himself and the woman to safety.
The leggy looker, Angela (Rie Rasmussen), is two heads taller than Andre. When he berates her for trying to deprive the world of so much youth and beauty, she assures him she's rotten and ugly inside-- and that's what counts. That kernel of wisdom sums up pic's worthy -- if repetitive -- thesis.
Reassured by Andre, Angela pledges to stay by his side. With her aggressive lead, they tackle his problems.
There's a twist at the 45-minute mark that Besson -- attending the nation's first public showing at 9 a.m. Dec. 21 -- asked a packed house not to reveal. It's not that much of a twist, but his wishes will be respected here.
Rasmussen, a striking Dane whose fetching accent puts her in the Gallic tradition of foreign leading ladies such as Jean Seberg and Anna Karina, is being described as "unknown." But it's hard to believe anyone who saw Brian De Palma's "Femme Fatale" has forgotten the sight of her clad in little but $10 million worth of diamonds.
Rasmussen and Debbouze are perfectly cast, but their characters just aren't all that interesting. They talk a lot, with Angela always voicing her eagerness to get to whatever's next on the agenda. Still, compared with most of the films Besson has written, directed or produced, pace is positively Zen-like, with calm cutting to match.
Pic's finale ties everything together with some nifty special effects. Thesps rehearsed for six weeks in order to make the most of location work.
Shooting in chronological order in July and August -- mostly at the crack of dawn -- Besson and ace d.p. Thierry Arbogast (in their fifth collaboration) manage to make Paris look completely depopulated. Shimmering in the early morning light, it's a city whose streets and bridges exist only for Andre and Angela -- and for our aesthetic pleasure.
Selective use of violence in the service of a higher cause, which is part and parcel of Besson's universe, is made unabashedly tender here.Score by Anja Gabarek is a plus.
With animation on his mega-budgeted "Arthur" (aka "Arthur et les Minimoys") still under way for a December 2006 release, Besson can always claim that 
is really his final helming effort, should "Angel-A" prove an insufficiently satisfying grace note.


What if you took It's a Wonderful Life  and replaced George Bailey  with a scruffy Parisian con man and swapped Henry Travers 's doddering guardian angel for the half-naked chick with the $10 million pasties from Brian De Palma 's Femme Fatale ? You'd wind up in the humid imagination of writer-director Luc Besson . In this amiably inconsequential fairy tale, one-armed Morocco -born comic Jamel Debbouze  draws on his scrappy charm as a quick-talking Brooklyn -based loser who's about to jump into the Seine  to avoid his gambling debts when suddenly a literal suicide blonde (Rie Rasmussen ) materializes on the same bridge. When the leggy sprite and her companion aren't wandering a desolate City of Lightsshot in silvery black-and-whitethe portentously named Angela throws roundhouse kicks in a bid to restore her man's latent decency. Is she the director's muse? Is expat Debbouze's love-hate relationship with Paris symbolic of Besson's own tenuous position in Gaulywood, where he functions as a kind of Gallic Jerry Bruckheimer ? There's little beyond the surface-deep pleasures of this talky distaff riff on Wings of Desire , although the raffish Debbouze and the gawky Rasmussen provide an ungainly sweetness. But the loony passion and profligate imagination of Besson's sci-fi whatsit The Fifth Element  are sorely missed.
