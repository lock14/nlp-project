After signing up for trials of a new happy pill, a geeky parking cop (Michael Rapaport) develops superhuman powers  or so he thinks. Sounds like a great Jim Carrey vehicle, but Special  is dead serious  and set on making you think instead of laugh. The result is a minor-key riff on Don Quixote  that struggles against heavy-handed plotting and the awkward humor of a man in a hand-sewn bodysuit running headfirst into walls. But thanks to Rapaport's brio in embracing the hero's drug-induced delusions, the movie is less a failure than a noble experiment gone awry.

 “Special” burdens its hero, Les Franken (Michael Rapaport), with a double dose of movie-loser shorthand: he’s a traffic cop and comic-book fan. But a funny thing happens after he starts popping an experimental antidepressant called specioprin hydrochloride (trade-named “Special”). Les develops the ability to levitate, walk through walls and read people’s minds.  Awesome! Except that he is actually going bonkers.  Written and directed by Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore, “Special” puts an indie spin on the current Hollywood vogue for moody superhero psychodrama. Or looked at another way, it puts a Hollywood spin on the indie vogue for tales of solipsistic man-boys.  Either way, it doesn’t quite go far enough as psychological study or cultural commentary. Though Mr. Rapaport is affecting (and well cast) as Les, the character often feels condescended to, and his inner conflict becomes stranded in some desultory plot mechanics involving shady drug company executives.  “Special” takes the notion of the mentally unstable vigilante hero to its logical conclusion  —  outright delusion —  and offers an empathetic alternative to the nihilism of the recent Batman pictures. But ultimately it adds little to our understanding of the curious return of the superhero as our paradigmatic pop archetype.  “Special” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and violence.

That superhero triumphalism continues to dominate Hollywood  is a peculiar trend in our pop-cultural history, but it makes the trickle down into character-driven, low-budget Sundance indies almost inevitable. In Special , a meek meter reader with fanboy proclivities (Michael Rappaport ) enrolls in a clinical trial for an experimental anti-depressant, after which he develops powers like levitation, ESP, and the ability to pass through walls. With his newfound self-confidence, he dons a homemade costume and preemptively tackles evildoers while they're still scheming in their heads, but could this cat simply be missing a couple marbles? In the first act alone, writer-directors Hal Haberman  and Jeremy Passmore  give up their "Is he or isn't he?" game by showing us a sane observer's point of view—yes, this pathetic nut is swimming on the floor, not hovering inches above. All that's left then is a miserablist analogue to M. Night Shyamalan 's Unbreakable , a sad portrait of paranoid delusion with wipe-out stunts played for the comic wincing of Jackass . Rappaport's befuddled sincerity has never registered so poignantly, but given its singular premise, for the film to waste an easy opportunity to satirize vigilante do-goodery and pharmaceutical dependence is, well, villainous.
