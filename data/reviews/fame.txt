It’s not a good sign when the first few minutes of a movie about singing, dancing, rapping, video-camera-wielding teenagers reminds you of a certain grimy horror franchise. But from the minute the camera drifts toward a series of light bulbs arrayed around a single word -- “Fame,’’ done up in the iconic font of the 1980 film -- you could be forgiven for asking yourself how you wound up in a “Saw’’ movie. We hear only the imperative lyrics of the original movie’s title song (“Re-mem-ba! Re-mem-ba! Re-mem-ba!’’) and the famous taunts made by Debbie Allen, who played the dance instructor: “Right here is where you start paying in sweat.’’ This is usually how the serial killer in “Saw’’ introduces his death games.

Lives are spared in this sugarless new version of Alan Parker’s movie and the TV show it spawned. But innocent songs and unsuspecting dance routines are hacked to bits. Like its predecessors (there was also a season of “Fame L.A.’’ and an NBC reality contest inspired by all of this), the 2009 edition is also set at the New York High School of Performing Arts, or “the P.A.,’’ where a clan of fresh young faces descend for four years of  - well, that’s part of the problem.

In Parker’s movie and on the TV series, we were handed a batch of talented New York kids with wild energy, neon personalities, and just enough self-belief for you to believe in them. And over the course of the school year and a television cycle, we watched the school’s staff hone skill into art. In the film especially, you could see the work. You could see the skill. Parker really showcased them, sometimes to ridiculous but memorable effect. I don’t know what we’re supposed to admire about this new cast of enrollees. They’re all camera-ready but mostly unremarkable. Written by Allison Bennett and directed as a music video by Kevin Tancharoen, the movie sees something in them in that I can’t.

We’re told that of the 10,000 people who apply to P.A. only 200 are accepted. Frankly, I’d like to see the other 9,800. Kay Panabaker, who plays an uptight drama student named Jenny, is nice and all, but the object of a movie like this is to show us how four years of intensive training can turn this meek little girl into a great actor. Her stammering line delivery and timid demeanor promise only the next Neve Campbell. Forget P.A., Jenny’s attending the “Party of Five’’ Academy.

She’s locked into a romantic story line with Marco (Asher Book), a squeaky-clean singing student with a strong Ralph Macchio haircut. His interest in her is baffling, since she’s dull and he seems just as likely to chase Neil (Paul Iacono) an aggravating acting student desperate to make movies, or Kevin (Paul McGill), a dancer struggling to make an impression. The movie just isn’t that interesting.
The big surprise is meant to be that Denise (Naturi Naughton), the gifted pianist, might be an even better singer of sappy ballads and hip-hop hooks. But having seen Naughton raunch it up as Lil’ Kim in last winter’s “Notorious,’’ this more wholesome version of herself is underwhelming. Frankly, one Ashanti is plenty. Denise defies her parents and teams up with a music classmate (Walter Perez) and rapper classmate (Collins Pennie), who is having trouble emoting in acting class (show me a rapper who doesn’t?). The tune they create together sounds like a retro dance-house number. They debut it at a costume party, which is about right, since the song suggests that 2009 has clearly gone dressed as 1992. Does P.A. even offer a class in C&C Music Factory?

A lot has changed in the three decades since “Fame,’’ namely fame itself. The original kids really believed, however naively, in their talent, that it would win out over everything. This time the students at P.A. seem entitled to success, and with so many avenues to other people’s laptops or living rooms, there’s some truth in that. But the casting directors don’t seem to appreciate that entitlement is not a means to entertainment. It’s exasperating. Whenever Panabaker sings or Pennie raps I found myself longing for the blunt assessments of Simon Cowell.

Allen makes a few appearances here as P.A.’s principal, and the electric feeling you got from “Fame’’ in the 1980s was seeing her and the other adults spot talent in these kids. Watching Gene Anthony Ray perform in the movie, Allen looked like she’d caught the vapors. I spent this movie searching for that awed reaction in the faces of the actors playing the teachers  - Charles S. Dutton (drama), Megan Mullally (singing), Kelsey Grammar (classical music), and Bebe Neuwirth (dance). There are no teachers’ lounge discussions here. And I think it’s because they’d be brutal.

What you really want though is a wow moment. And there isn’t one. There’s no Susan Boyle or Jennifer Hudson or disarmingly fun number to be found amid all telegenic faces. There’s more to savor in any installment of “High School Musical.’’ No one here has any funk, soul, charisma, or spontaneity. It’s true that not many of the actors of the original movie and show became big names, but “Fame’’ made them all seem like stars. Now the glorious threat of the title song seems like a joke. I’m gonna live forever? Not this time.

. 




         "Fame," it turns out, is not going to live forever. It's officially DOA.

Call the coroner. Then call in the top teams from "CSI," and that sexy pair from "Bones" while you're at it, because if ever there was a crime scene that should be yellow-taped and relentlessly investigated this is it. 



         






  Someone has driven a stake through the heart and ripped out the soul of the 1980 original. The responsible parties, make that irresponsible parties, should be found, thrown in movie jail and not allowed within 50 feet of a set again. Ever.

Gone is almost every shred of the gutsy, gritty script that Christopher Gore wrote. It would earn him an Oscar nomination, one of six that "Fame" would get, which should have been a clue to the team on the remake that maybe, just maybe, he had something there. (The film would go on to win two for song and score and launch the career of singer-songwriter Irene Cara.)

Gore's script distinguished itself with angst-filled back stories of the kids who made it into the highly competitive New York City High School of Performing Arts, stories that would, sadly enough, still have been relevant today: the brilliant dancer who can't read; the gay actor's painful coming out; the domineering stage mother; the interracial romance; the ballerina's unwanted pregnancy; the dignity stripped, literally and figuratively, from a young hopeful in a dirty hotel room in front of a camera; the stand-up wannabe seduced by fame, betrayed by drugs.

Though the remake uses the same blueprint -- starting with the auditions and then chaptering the story from freshman year through graduation -- the sense of change and evolution that should come with those years has gone missing here. 

Whether it was the PC police working to ensure that PG rating or too many notes from the suits who couldn't distinguish between the baby and the bathwater, Allison Burnett's watered-down screenplay offers up a vacuous teenage wasteland rather than a rich coming-of-age story. 

Instead, the performing arts school whose seething talent spilled out of the classrooms and onto the streets with such force in director Alan Parker's hands is left gasping for breath. The friendships, the friction, all the painful figuring out who you are of high school has apparently been stuffed into a third-floor locker and forgotten. The lesson here? Performance is not enough, we have to care about the characters, something even the countless spawn of "Fame" -- including "American Idol" and  "Project Runway" -- learned early on.

Sadder still, first-time director Kevin Tancharoen, 25, and director of photography Scott Kevan have given us a great-looking film, albeit a Rudy Giuliani vision of New York City. Everything is pristine, from the kids to the classrooms to the subways. Even the streets have been emptied. Though the grime, the taxis and the crowds are gone, it is a spare beauty that the filmmaker uses well. 

 Tancharoen has a real feel for the performance pieces too, and it is in the dance scenes that the film ignites. Modern dancer Kherington Payne is even more mesmerizing on the big screen than she was last year in "So You Think You Can Dance." The director makes the most of that extraordinary body in motion with a stripped-down staging. 

But it is Naturi Naughton as Denise, a classical pianist turned rocker over the protests of her father, who is the showstopper. Put a piano in front of her or a microphone in her hand and you believe that a star is being born right in front of you, which is exactly the emotional note the film is supposed to play from start to finish. If you happened to catch Naughton earlier this year as Lil' Kim in the biopic "Notorious," an under-the-radar film that traced the short life and violent death of rapper Biggie Smalls, her turn in "Fame" will serve only as confirmation of a talent who will hopefully be around for a very long time. For everyone else, she is "Fame's" brightest star.

There are other kids who emerge out of the ether -- Collins Pennie as actor-rapper Malik brings a kind of dramatic resonance to the role that leaves you feeling the film just scratched the surface of his potential. And Asher Book, not one of the five featured actors, may well turn out to be the sleeper surprise of the bunch with an appealing, low-key Zac Efron vibe about him. 

 Unfortunately, the other central characters prove to be forgettable, with performances that would have gotten them kicked out of the real NYC school. As for the faculty, with the exception of drama teacher Charles Dutton and one song by Megan Mullally, which is a lot of fun but makes absolutely no sense at all as part of the story, the teachers, especially Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth, feel like day players -- such a waste.

So unless you are one of those types who always slows down at accident scenes, consider leaving it to the detectives to solve the sad case of "Fame." If there's a trial, we'll let you know.



   

NYC high school students sing, dance, emote in acting classes, and otherwise insist that America's got talent, but this unnecessarily tepid, conservative remake of 1980's far more famous and affecting original Fame  suggests otherwise. Why settle for this dull, safe production  at once airbrushed in plot and undisciplined in execution  when you can watch Glee ? The teachers (including original cast member Debbie Allen as school principal) turn out to be the best part of the show. The kids try hard, but mostly look grim while pretending to smile.


 Of course. After three “High School Musical” installments, “Bandslam” and the Fox series “Glee,” “Fame” — the 1980 film that spawned a stage show and a television series or two — was due for a makeover. The new version, like the first, covers four years at a New York performing-arts high school. And while the movie, the feature debut of the choreographer and video director Kevin Tancharoen, suffers from a surfeit of  flash, it nonetheless  offers the undeniable power of young performers pursuing art at peak dexterity.  “Fame” revisits some of the original’s sequences, including a spontaneous lunchroom dance jam and an attempted subway suicide. But primarily it offers new predicaments for its students, among them Marco (Asher Book), an easygoing John Mayer look- and sound-alike; Jenny (Kay Panabaker), Marco’s girlfriend and a repressed actress; Neil (Paul Iacono), a goofy film director trying to finance a short; and Alice (Kherington Payne), an upper-crust dancer. Ahead of the pack are Naturi Naughton, as a classical pianist whose father disapproves of her pop-singing aspirations, and Collins Pennie, as an intense rapper-actor from the projects.  Codgers can savor the glimpses of the teachers, played self-effacingly by Charles S. Dutton, Kelsey Grammer, Megan Mullally and Bebe Neuwirth, few of whom are flattered by the camera (though Ms. Neuwirth looks great). From the original, only the actress-choreographer Debbie Allen returns, as the principal.  The 1980 “Fame,” directed by Alan Parker, melded fantastical sequences with quasi-vérité visuals, brisk editing and urban grime. It also addressed issues like stage mothers, coming out of the closet, racial competition, teenage pregnancy and demands for screen nudity.  For grit, the 2009 “Fame” offers a desaturated palette. Alice’s affair with a working-class composer merely glances at class tensions; the most daunting peril is the casting couch. Rebellion? A first-time drinker is inebriated, vomits and vows never to  touch alcohol again.  A closing multidisciplinary extravaganza lets Mr. Tancharoen and his cast flaunt their chops, and viewers, as with “Hair” 42 years ago, can celebrate the glorious image of youth in full creative flower. Yet when Ms. Mullally gives a speech about why her character left show business, you’re compelled to ask: Whatever became of Irene Cara and the other stars of the first “Fame”?  “Fame” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has skeptical, repressive parents.

Almost three decades since "Fame" -- a legacy that included a TV series, a musical, even a reality show -- the original template re-emerges, again focusing on fresh-faced yet hungry kids at New York's High School for the Performing Arts. The real motivator here, though, is Disney's "High School Musical" franchise (and perhaps a dollop of "American Idol"), resulting in a watered-down tone that causes the movie to drift dramatically between its musical and dance sequences. This PG-rated offering thus dances along a fine line -- one that suggests a shelf-life well short of its "I wanna live forever" anthem.
Mostly, "Fame" tries to galvanize a new generation while offering a bland reboot of the recipe to anyone old enough to remember it.
Following only the broadest outline of Christopher Gore's edgy original screenplay -- which captured the passion within these kids, and how that can be exploited -- first-time director Kevin Tancharoen and writer Allison Burnett hew closer to "after-school special" territory in the drama. Yes, there's a ravenous hunger for success and the occasional disappointment, but the kids and their stories have been homogenized in such a way that nothing all that bad -- or good, for that matter -- really happens to any of them.
Opening with the auditions and then continuing, year by year, through the high school experience, the movie is almost inescapably episodic, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's only that the kids' stories lack much bite, and their caring teachers -- a virtual sitcom honor roll that includes Kelsey Grammer, Megan Mullally, Bebe Neuwirth and Charles S. Dutton (Debbie Allen provides the one link to the first movie) -- don't have enough screen time to make much of a difference. (The credits nevertheless have an egalitarian streak, listing both the older and younger contingents alphabetically.)
The sharp corners of issues such as ethnicity, class and sexuality have been rounded, leading to more mundane conflicts. Denise (Naturi Naughton, perhaps the one breakout player here) yearns to sing, but her parents insist she stick to classical piano. Jenny (Kay Panabaker) burns to bust out, creating tension with her more laid-back but vocally gifted boyfriend Marco (Asher Book). And Malik (Collins Pennie) struggles to channel anger and pain from a personal loss into his acting and rapping.
Alas, these pieces, however attractive, don't add up to much dramatically. And even when they flirt with insights into the toil that goes into honing one's craft and the distance between talent and stardom, they tend to pull up short -- such as a promising but finally unrealized moment in which first Jenny, and then Marco, sings Gershwin's "Someone to Watch Over Me."
A choreographer by training, Tancharoen fares better in bringing an exuberance to the performance sequences, but those frequent interludes -- the best being Naughton belting out a song from the original, "Out Here on My Own" -- don't so much advance the story as provide a welcome respite from it.
For MGM -- which could certainly use a hit on its thin release slate -- all this has the feel of a missed opportunity. Yes, "Fame" was there in the library, but this revival manages to feel like a "me-too" response to all the singing and dancing, reality-based and otherwise, bursting out all over primetime, seeking to tap into the lucrative niche of teen and preteen girls.
The irony is that several of these talented young performers might very well wind up becoming famous. It just likely won't be for this.

Baby, look at me . Gone are Leroys cornrows, short-shorts, and leg warmers: The anodyne adolescents in 25-year-old Kevin Tancharoen s directorial debut (written by Allison Burnett ) suggest not the charismatic, street-smart pupils at Performing Arts, but the Up with People squares. Dont you know who I am?  Like all good drama queens, the students in Alan Parker s 1980 original, which unfolded during an unmistakably Koch-era New York, take up space (blocking traffic on West 46th Street) and disrespect authority (dropping f-bombs in class, smashing school property). They also do drugs, have sex (and abortions, if necessary), and stay up past midnight. The new class at P.A. is strictly PG, sharing a chummy coffee with the vocal instructor (Megan Mullally ) who takes them on a karaoke field trip to Lucky Chengs, where not one drag queen is visible. Light up the sky like a flame . Though his gayness was awkwardly shoehorned in, carrot-topped Montgomery  was at least undeniably out in Parkers film. His closest analoguemany of the kids in the remake are race and/or gender inversions of the original charactersmerely alludes to homo-leanings through emo, Efron-esque bangs and a slightly swish carriage. Members of the class of 80 struggled to stay in school despite homelessness and crime; the greatest crisis in 09 finds a students Sesame Street   work-schedule affecting her GPA. The sanitized moppets in the new Fame  sing the body generic.
