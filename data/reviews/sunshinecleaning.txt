With Albuquerque as the setting, Alan Arkin as the rascally grandpa, and a happy atmospheric condition in the title, the makers of Sunshine Cleaning  aren't exactly subtle about their recycled ideas… er, reconstituted artistic influences. And just in case a potential moviegoer doesn’t make the connection, this peachcolored comedy about a wacky family who shove their sadness into a bulging closet is being marketed as ''from the producers of Little Miss Sunshine '' All that's missing from the formula is a Volkswagen Microbus.
But wait! Soon enough, Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams), a single mother scrounging for income in bad-economy New Mexico, picks up a reasonable automotive facsimile  a junker van. The wheels, see, are necessary for Rose’s new specialty business in crime-scene cleanup and biohazard disposal. The learning curve, she figures, can't be that steep; she already works as a housecleaner, sometimes vacuuming the plush carpets of women she went to high school with. In search of a partner, Rose ropes in her younger sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), who's an even less functional grown-up. We know Norah is a bad girl because she wears raccoon eye-shadow and smokes. We don’t yet know why she’s so blue, but then, it took a while for Steve Carell, as Little Miss Sunshine ’s droll, suicidal uncle, to share his pain. So hang on.
Now all that's missing is an adorable little wise-eyed kid who has a special relationship with Gramps. But wait! Rose's inquisitive son, Oscar (pint-size TV pro Jason Spevack), is a bright boy so bored in his local elementary school that he makes mischief. That's probably just as well, since the need to transfer Oscar to a private school is what awakens Rose's entrepreneurial spirit in the first place. Soon, this thirtysomething underachiever whose glory days peaked when she was a high school cheerleader is zipping around Albuquerque, cheerily mopping up blood and brains and, along the way, finding a new sense of self-worth. Don't ask why a woman who looks as radiant and charismatic as Amy Adams thinks scrubbing bathtubs is her only career path  after all, Jennifer Aniston wielded a mop in Friends With Money , and Jennifer Lopez cleaned hotel sinks in Maid in Manhattan .
Meanwhile, Oscar gets to spend quality out-of-school time with Arkin's Gramps, a generic failed dreamer with a million lousy moneymaking schemes that only somebody in a movie would think up. (At one point the old guy tries to sell a shipment of bad shellfish to an unimpressed restaurateur.) We're eventually told why Norah is so sad— and the backstory is one melodramatic storm cloud too many. At least she gets to hang out for a while with an interesting, equally bruised woman played by 24 's always-welcome Mary Lynn Rajskub.
That's the silver lining in this emotionally inconsequential dramedy: Truly lovely performances by Adams and Blunt pierce the thoroughly artificial climate. New Zealand-born director Christine Jeffs and screenwriter Megan Holley were lucky to land these two talents when the film went into production back in 2007, just after Blunt broke through in The Devil Wears Prada  but long before Adams' Oscar-nominated turn in Doubt . As blooming Rose, Adams taps into a delicate vein of warmth and humor that makes her every reaction fresh; we may not understand why this arbitrarily thwarted character has settled for so little, but we cheer for Adams in the role. (The actor makes a showstopper moment out of Rose's attendance at a shallow classmate's baby shower.) And wielding the attitude of a not-as-tough-as-she-thinks chick, Blunt complements Adams' honeyed energy with her own irresistible, more deadpan vigor. She's a great eye-roller.
One other bright spot: Both Rose and Norah have adult sex lives  imperfect, to be sure, but real sex lives all the same. For a time, Rose has a lusty relationship with a married cop (Steve Zahn). Norah, meanwhile, beds a guy who means as little to her as she means to herself. These brief nods to the reality of female sexuality seem almost accidental in an otherwise contrived movie. But I'm grateful for the sky-clearing flashes of insight. B–

 I’m thinking of a movie. Wait, don’t tell me, it’s on the tip of my tongue. It takes place in Albuquerque. There’s a beat-up old van, a lot of family dysfunction, a cute kid, a get-rich-quick scheme that doesn’t quite work out as planned. Alan Arkin is the grandpa. The title? Something about “Sunshine.”  No, not that one. “Little Miss Sunshine” came out in 2006. Why on earth would I be reviewing it now? I’m wondering that myself. A better title for the movie I am supposed to review — for the record, it’s “Sunshine Cleaning,” directed by Christine Jeffs from a script by Megan Holley — would be “Sundance Recycling,” since the picture is less a free-standing independent film than a scrap-metal robot built after a shopping spree at the Park City Indie Parts and Salvage Warehouse.  I don’t just mean that aspects of the setting, characters and plot seem awfully familiar (and, in a few cases, familiarly awful). The deeper problem is an overall confusion of tone, mood and genre, a breathless incoherence that comes from the effort to jam too many disparate elements together. In one scene you think you’re in a gritty little regional-realist drama, which gives way to a quirky comedy about adorable eccentrics and then swerves abruptly through psychological melodrama on its way to a cheery, tidy ending.  If, from one of these stuck-together moments to the next, “Sunshine Cleaning” sometimes seems better than it is, that is largely because Ms. Jeffs (“Rain,” “Sylvia”) has a good touch with actors and a very good cast. Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, playing sisters who go into business together, attack their roles with vivacity and dedication, even if the roles themselves don’t entirely make sense.  Ms. Adams, with her tremulous smile and her usual beguiling mixture of fragility and pluck, is Rose, a single mother whose life is a daily struggle with disappointment and humiliation. Though she dreams of getting her real-estate license — perhaps a more seductive dream when the movie was made than it is now — she scratches out a living cleaning houses and hotel rooms. She’s having an affair with Mac (Steve Zahn), her high school boyfriend — he was a football star, she was a cheerleader — who married someone else and works as a police detective. Her son, Oscar (Jason Spevack), is always getting in trouble at school, and her dad (Mr. Arkin, naturally) is an erratic and sometimes troublesome, though generally well-intentioned, old coot.  But Rose, whose recitations of self-help mantras as she looks in the mirror make her a target for the kind of condescension that can play as satire or pity, is by far the more stable of the two sisters. The other, Norah (Ms. Blunt), is the cool, wayward one, who has tattoos on her wrist, bad sex with a guy at a party, and a fondness for telling Oscar scary bedtime stories when she goes over to Rose’s to baby-sit. She also does a bit of stalking, which gives the film a chance to use the wonderful Mary Lynn Rajskub, rather unimaginatively, as yet another faux-provincial American oddball.  It is not enough for the sisters to have oil-and-water temperaments that make their painful quarrels and comic spats inevitable. There needs to be a childhood trauma to inject a little more pathos into their relationship, and to this end the filmmakers supply a dead mother, whose suicide continues to haunt Rose and Norah. Except when it doesn’t: Rose is perfectly happy to make a flippant joke about suicide in one scene, only to howl in undimmed rage and grief a short while later.  “Sunshine Cleaning” is too busy to notice such inconsistencies. Rose and Norah busy themselves with a ghoulishly comical, gratingly improbable new enterprise, which is cleaning up crime scenes. This job allows the film to dabble in cheap, grisly sight gags and also in gratuitous throat-lumping. It’s the human comedy! It’s the human tragedy! It’s love and family and sisterhood and second chances and picking yourself up and dusting yourself off and making lemonade out of lemons. It’s a kindly, one-armed cleaning-supply salesman with wry wisdom, quiet patience, a scraggly ponytail and an endearing hobby. He builds models.  Really, though, “Sunshine Cleaning” is none of those things, apart from the cleaning-supply salesman, played by Clifton Collins Jr. He’s real, which is to say he’s as phony as everything else in the movie. All in all, it’s a mess, and much as Ms. Blunt pouts, Ms. Adams twinkles,  and Mr. Arkin growls, there’s nothing they can do to clean it up.  “Sunshine Cleaning” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, swearing, drug use and scenes depicting the bloody aftermath of violent acts.

Anyone who saw "Little Miss Sunshine" will feel a lot of the same buttons being pushed in "Sunshine Cleaning." From the title to the blandly generic Western setting to the sight of Alan Arkin pairing off with a little kid, this new entry from the same production shingle, Big Beach, forces comparison to its wildly successful predecessor and comes up short in all departments. Two of the most appealing new actresses on the scene today, Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, make the film eminently marketable, but no one should expect "Sunshine" B.O. lightning to strike twice.
Although it's a bit of a stretch to accept women as winning as these two sisters being so desperate for livelihoods and decent men, Rose (Adams) and Norah (Blunt) can both feel life passing them by. Rose, once the most popular girl in high school, has a 7-year-old son named Oscar (Jason Spevack) and works as a maid.
Younger Norah is the edgier one, a hard partier who lives with dad Joe (Arkin), an old guy still hustling goofy financial schemes. Everyone in the family is short-tempered, their frayed nerves stemming from the perceived lack of prospects living on the lower end of the Albuquerque food chain.
Rose's (married) lover is savvy local cop Mac (Steve Zahn), and, when he mentions how much money can be made in the unsavory specialized business of crime scene cleanup, Rose puts all the gumption and energy she's got left into getting such an enterprise off the ground. Literally holding their noses, they make a tidy sum from an initial mop-up after a motel shooting, and, despite lack of certification, they're in business.
Circumstances of their assorted jobs are passably amusing, as Rose attacks them with roll-up-her-sleeves straightforwardness, while Norah can never quite disguise her squeamishness. In the crime cleanup biz, the big paydays come when you land on insurance companies' lists of contacts, and Rose commits their little company to this goal.
It's in the assorted subplots of Megan Holly's script that the project's self-consciously calculated quirkiness rubs the wrong way. Arkin does nearly the identical blunt-talking, lovably cranky shtick he performed to such effect in "Little Miss Sunshine," as he tries to instruct young Oscar in the ways of the mercantile world. Rose contends with the twin humiliations of conducting her affair in a cheap motel and feeling like such a failure compared to the women she once lorded it over in school.
For her part, Norah is particularly haunted by the death of her mother at an early age and, as part of her search of answers, enters into an ill-motivated relationship with an older woman.
Director Christine Jeffs, who previously helmed "Rain" and "Sylvia," tries to strike a balance between the yarn's dark currents and offbeat comedy, but the result is often uneasy, with the humor receding as things progress.
Still, the film is in good measure saved by the leads, especially Adams, who proves once again what a sparkling, irresistible screen presence she has. So energizing and uplifting is she that considerable interest attends the test of her ability to perform scenes of doubt and despair (she can), and no matter her character's previous decade of drudge work, Adams leaves no doubt that Rose will find a way to prevail in the end.
Blunt has the second banana role in that Norah goes along for the ride that her sister prescribes, but she's a good comic foil in her scenes with Adams and comes more into her own in interludes with other characters.
Most eye-catching supporting turn comes from low-key work by Clifton Collins Jr. as a sympathetic cleaning supplies store clerk who is willing to watch little Oscar.

More than a year after its first twirl at Sundance, this Amy Adams –Emily Blunt  dramedy finally shrugs its way into theaters, and it feels almost like an afterthought. A film about sisters who go into the crime-scene clean-up business, it's a muddled mess: terrific performances (from Adams, especially, as the ex–high school cheerleader now at the bottom of the pile) buried beneath contrivances and clichés, not to mention Alan Arkin  cast yet again as the foul-mouthed gramps dispensing four-lettered advice to a troubled youngster (Jason Spevack , as Adams's son, who'll lick anything and anyone). Director Christine Jeffs , working with Megan Holley 's screenplay, renders the light and dark as a muddy shade of sitcom-pilot gray. This has the makings of a great Showtime  series—feels a bit like Weeds  , but with cleaning fluid instead of bong water. Too bad what's intended to play as funny (girls and gore) stumbles into slapstick; what's meant to play as profound (girls and dead-mommy issues) sinks into the overwrought—yet another willful, comically tortured "indie" coated with Hollywood 's happy-ending sheen. Or perhaps, at this point, it's simply hard to buy the perky Adams and pretty Blunt as schlumpy losers trapped in the bland flyover with an Oscar-winner stuck in rerun mode.
