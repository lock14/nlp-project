In a true starmaking turn, Terrence Howard commands the screen as the Memphis pimp DJay, who dreams of making his mark in the world and living a better life. His dream is amorphous at first, as we learn in a powerful opening monologue delivered to his top earner Nola (Manning) as they sit in his unair-conditioned old beater while waiting for a trick to bite. But the frustration with his dead-end career oozes from DJay much like the beads of sweat that pour from his body in the sweltering Memphis summer. That swelter and the movie�s grassroots honesty, along with its outstanding ensemble performances, is what elevates the basic corniness of this movie�s "pimp with a dream" plot into one of universal recognition. DJay is a character like Brooklyn�s Tony Manero striving to be king of the discos in Saturday Night Fever
, or Philadelphia�s Rocky, or the players in an old MGM musical who must battle the odds before their talent is recognized and their fortunes turn. It�s a winning formula, and when done right like it is here, it transcends the clich�s and moves audiences. When happenstance causes DJay to come into possession of a pocket keyboard and then later to run into an old high school buddy Key (Anderson, in a note-perfect switch from his usual comedic roles), who is now the soundman for a church choir, it focuses DJay�s urge toward self-expression. He starts writing down rhymes with the aim of turning them into raps and enlists Key�s help in converting a room in his house into a poor man�s recording studio. (And anyone who�s tried this will delight in watching them stapling egg cartons to the walls for soundproofing and bargaining with neighbors to eliminate the interfering hum from nearby electronic devices.) In turn, Key brings on the church pianist Shelby (Qualls), a pot-smoking white guy whose mastery of the beatbox is just one of the movie�s unexpected pleasures. DJay�s plan is to get a demo to Skinny Black (Ludacris), a Memphis-born rapper who�s hit it big and is returning to town for a private Fourth of July party at a local club run by Arnel (Hayes), a pot-buying client of DJay�s who tips him off. Hayes and Ludacris are both great, and there�s a carefree nonchalance to their conversations with DJay that lend the movie an extra sense of authenticity. The women, however, do not fare as well in writer-director Brewer�s script. Henson plays Shug, barefoot and pregnant but devoted to DJay, who learns to sing the chorus on one of his songs; Parker plays a shrewish hooker who gets violently tossed out of their crib for dissing DJay�s dreams, thereby freeing up her room for a recording studio; Manning, despite her trashy appearance, is DJay�s top (and if truth be told, only) earner, who absorbs some of DJay�s lessons about self-reliance and is reborn as his "primary investor"; and Neal plays Key�s church-lady wife, who has a charitable turn of heart. Hustle & Flow
 has a few lagging moments in the middle, and some third-act melodramatics that are just a bit too much, but they are easy to forgive because Howard and the others are just so watchable. The insistent bass hook of the Memphis crunk rap also drives the movie and practically challenges the viewer to resist nodding along to DJay�s tunes, "Whoop That Trick" and "It�s Hard Out Here for a Pimp." The movie�s ability to sway us over to its lyrics may be its ultimate tribute to the powers of art and self-expression.

 of this week�s Screens section for an interview with the movie�s writer-director, Craig Brewer.)


''Hustle & Flow" is the story of a drug-dealing North Memphis pimp, his ambitions of rap superstardom, and, of course, his hos.
Audience members at this year's Sundance Film Festival left screenings in a dazzled tizzy, and the movie was sold for a lot of money. The hoopla is embarrassing. Full of cuss words and trips to nudie bars and jail, ''Hustle & Flow" is ultimately a lot more familiar: an odds-beating tale of redemption and dreams come true.
Some will find it chicly inspired, recalling blaxploitation's heyday with its grimy urban realism. Some will rightly find it corny, absurd, and an insultingly limited presentation of options for the most disenfranchised African-Americans: I'm still waiting for the movie fantasy about the pimp who wants to get his GED.
Still, most will agree that Terrence Howard's acting as the hustler hero is remarkable.
Howard can usually be counted on to be the most magnetic presence in most of the nothing roles he's usually offered. He brought an electrically sinister note to a friendly card game in a romantic comedy called ''The Best Man," and he was very sharp in an implausible part as a ticked-off executive in ''Crash," the overwrought drama that came out this spring.
''Hustle & Flow" is the biggest vehicle yet, though hardly the best, for his talents. He plays DJay, a man whose lines of work provide food for his makeshift family, but they feed his soul. The character wears his hair slicked back in a press-and-curl. He never leaves the house without a long white tank top hugging his rangy trunk. He curses up a storm and wraps his twang around a word like ''man" until it is two or three times its usual length.
One afternoon, DJay runs into Key (Anthony Anderson), an old acquaintance and a devout Christian who works as a sound engineer. DJay drops in on him, recording in a church, where a woman powerfully sings opera-laced gospel about Jesus and salvation. DJay sits in a pew and is moved to tears. He wants to be saved.
But his day-to-day problems are more mundane. He shares a house with a feisty woman named Lexus (Paula Jai Parker, who's terrific), a dim, white one named Nola (Taryn Manning), and a pregnant, mousy one named Shug (Taraji P. Henson).
They turn tricks for DJay, leaving him with a nagging problem: Every night, he has to come home to his work. The movie tries to dramatize this domestic headache, but writer-director Craig Brewer's idea of living-room drama consists of ear-splitting, expletive-heavy screaming matches between man and woman that no one seems to win.
In this sense, he's learned a great deal from the movie's co-producer and chief champion, John Singleton, whose own South Central Los Angeles melodramas have perfected the male-to-female shout-down.
As an escape from his home life, DJay twiddles on the cheap little keyboard he got from a junkie. Very soon his ambition to rap is realized with the help of Key and a gangly white musician named Shelby (DJ Qualls), who stocks snack machines 9 to 5.
This collaboration produces some hilarious, sweaty home-studio recording sessions that culminate with the birth of a likely hit song. It's produced in the style of ''crunk," simultaneously throbbing and slinky music that was made popular by Lil' Jon. It's a sound that suggests what a college football locker room might be like in the middle of a strip club.
DJay's hustler's hip-hop lament (''You know it's hard out here for a pimp. . .") lacks a crucial ingredient, and in a snap of inspiration, Shug is summoned from the living room and asked to sing a hook. Well, she's verbally abused into it, but whatever: She's a natural. And the only transcendent sight in the whole picture is Henson's face, which is covered in sweat and tears after Shug hears the playback. She's the only person who seems shocked by her talent, and her surprise is touching.
Otherwise, everyone in DJay's circle accommodates his agenda. Even Key's stern wife (Elise Neal) starts bringing snacks by the studio as though her husband were working in some after-school program. If only the movie could make us feel the sense of conversion she feels.
Eventually, DJay takes a demo to Skinny Black (the rapper Chris ''Ludacris" Bridges), a North Memphis native who's now a big hip-hop star. Howard and Ludacris had an intense scene together in ''Crash," and here, they share a long, vulgar, and wistful conversation that turns sour, then violent. But the movie never loses hope and expects us to keep rooting for him long past the point when we should.
Part of the trouble is that DJay doesn't possess a particular talent as a rapper. His style is passably articulate, but his narrative is all cliche. The words flow as if they were forced out by an expectorant. The music video channels are full of guys like DJay -- men who are entitled but crude, surrounded by buxom girls jiggling out of their clothes.
The movie isn't showcasing a gifted artist, the way ''Purple Rain" did Prince or ''8 Mile" did Eminem. ''Hustle & Flow" is more cynical. The songs don't matter as much as the moments of street cred in a rapper's back story. Ultimately, Brewer is peddling a myth that has little to do with the music.


         "Hustle & Flow" abounds with all the ingredients of a terrific popular entertainment. Writer-director Craig Brewer first of all cares deeply for his characters, with the result that each one emerges as a distinctive, involving individual, and this care extends from the film's casting down to such details as the gold teeth sported by one of its stars. Wrenching in its raw emotions, hilarious in its earthy humor yet subtle in myriad ways, "Hustle & Flow" catches life in a warm embrace, unafraid of sentiment but not looking away from some of the harsher realities of everyday existence. It's safe to say it's not like any other movie about a black pimp.
 
  Terrence Howard's tough but reflective DJay is every bit as memorable as the fierce and flashy Max Julien was in "The Mack" (1973), one of the most popular yet serious pictures of the blaxploitation cycle, or Morgan Freeman as the most terrifying pimp imaginable in "Street Smart" (1987). "Hustle & Flow," however, is working on an entirely different level as it explores its simple, persistent theme: "Everybody needs a dream."
 


         






    Caught up in an endless routine of driving around the seedier side of Memphis in search of clients with his two prostitutes — there's a third at his shabby rented home, awaiting the imminent birth of his child — DJay focuses on what he has to do to survive and take care of his women. But when he hears that platinum-selling rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris), a high school classmate, will be making a hometown Fourth of July visit at a club run by DJay's friend Arnel (Isaac Hayes, a real-life Memphis legend), DJay is made painfully aware of the loss of his dreams. Encountering a street character who insists on selling him a keyboard and running into old friend Key (Anthony Anderson), a sound engineer who always wanted to own a recording studio, DJay begins to consider that if Skinny Black could make it as a rapper, why couldn't he. Pretty soon DJay and Key are converting a room in DJay's house into a makeshift studio, and Key has enlisted the help of his church's pianist, Shelby (DJ Qualls), a skinny white kid with plenty of wit and talent.
 
  An exciting atmosphere of creativity enthralls the three, but there's some fallout. Key's wife, Yevette (Elise Neal), proper and upwardly mobile, is less than thrilled that her husband, whom she calls by his real name, Clyde, is spending more and more of his spare time at "a house full of whores." One of DJay's women, Lexus (Paula Jai Parker), who's also a stripper, loses all respect for DJay for neglecting business. Nola (Taryn Manning), a poor white runaway, finds DJay's dream contagious, while the luminous, pregnant Shug (Taraji P. Henson), whose entire existence centers on DJay, is thrilled to be asked to sing backup on "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp," a prospect as amusingly ironic as it sounds, but she puts so much soul into it that the effect is also touching.
 
  "Hustle & Flow" unfolds in the satisfying fashion of classic Hollywood movies that strike a balance between grit and heart, capturing the hard edge of poverty and lack of opportunity but also offering a ray of hope for a better life. Scott Bomar's score and Amelia Vincent's camerawork exude the atmosphere of the funkier areas of picturesque Memphis. Above all, "Hustle & Flow" places Howard front and center as a man with little education but much street wisdom. A pimp who can't afford a flashy wardrobe but who puts his hair up in rollers every day, DJay seems a world apart from Howard's sophisticated, uptight Hollywood director in "Crash," but Howard makes them equally indelible — and Howard's scenes with Ludacris are as jolting as they were in "Crash." "Hustle & Flow" could just wind up a summer sleeper.

 A Paramount Classics, MTV Films and New Deal Entertainment presentation  Writer-director Craig Brewer. Producers John Singleton, Stephanie Allain. Cinematographer Amelia Vincent. Editor Billy Fox.

Certain movies, like 8 Mile , Rocky , or Saturday Night Fever , walk an entrancing line between realism and pop mythology. They're tales, at heart, of Hollywood uplift  of struggle and triumph, of an underdog's stubborn dream  yet scene for scene, moment to moment, they are made with so much grit and spirit and verve, such a deep-dish flavor of the streets, that their inspiration is rooted in something authentic and rare. Hustle & Flow , Craig Brewer's drama about a small-time Memphis pimp who pours his life into cutting a homemade crunk tape, is that kind of movie. From the moment we see DJay (Terrence Howard) seated behind the wheel of his ratty parked Chevy, rambling out a seductive monologue about the distinction between ''man'' (a mere dog, he says) and ''mankind,'' we're drawn to the exotic inside portrait of a flyweight urban hustler who knows how to cast a spell.
When DJay speaks, in the smokiest of smoky drawls, the words come out slowly, sliding into each other, the cadences fused in a lyrical back-porch whisper  a barely perceptible form of intimidation. He sounds, at times, like an old Southern man telling a story, and though DJay isn't old, exactly, the years are beginning to add up for him. Pushing 40, he's a veteran of the streets, one who's grown weary and a bit numb hawking his girls out of cars, using his casual gift for words to keep them in line. Terrence Howard, in the single most powerful performance I've seen this year, inhabits this character with a casual mastery that makes him a world unto himself; we're in touch with his ambition and sadness, his rage and longing, as if they were our own. DJay's hair is conked with old-school '60s-style curlers, and his flesh peddler's face is handsome yet puffy, as if he'd been presenting it to the world as a mask for so long that he'd forgotten what's under there. He may be an exploiter, yet he is not, by nature, a cruel man: Howard plays him with the hidden, bone-deep anxiety of someone who has spent his life coasting on outlaw instinct.
The movie, which is sharply  paced and terrifically shot, sketches in DJay's relationships with his working girls, furious Shug (Taraji P. Henson) and sexy, ignorant Nola, played by Taryn Manning like a deer in cornrows. DJay, by contrast, is a dog running out of tricks, so when he bumps into Key (Anthony Anderson), a sound engineer he knew back in his school days, and gets the idea to put some rhymes to paper, it's not just a movieish lark. He's out to save what's left of himself.
The home-studio recording sequences in Hustle & Flow  are funky, rowdy, and indelible. Brewer gives us the pleasure of watching characters create music from the ground up, beat by beat, take by take. DJay and Key, trapped in his bourgeois marriage, and Shelby (DJ Qualls), a gawky white church musician who's a wizard with a beatbox, are all out to escape the drudgery of their anonymous lives; that's what makes the sessions cathartic. As DJay works up a demo mixtape to give to Skinny Black (Ludacris), a hometown rapper–turned–platinum-selling star, some may accuse Hustle & Flow  of softening a pimp's brutality, yet the movie, in an odd way, is never more honest about the violent and tawdry degradation of DJay's life than when we hear him chant his ripped-from-the-gut lyrics (''Whoop that trick  get 'em!''). Those words imprint themselves on the audience. So does Hustle & Flow .
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Actor (Terrence Howard); Best Original Song (''It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp'')

 There is a lot of heart in "Hustle & Flow," Craig Brewer's first feature film, and a lot of nonsense as well. Perhaps this is only fitting, since the movie's hero, a Memphis pimp named DJay (Terrence Howard) who dreams of becoming a rap star, is both cunning and earnest, a scam artist who claims to want nothing more than to speak his mind and lay bare his soul.  This tension is summed up in the movie's title, which refers to the  language that defines DJay's conflicting professional ambitions. The pimp's mode is the hustle, a smooth, manipulative patter designed to separate johns from their money and keep hookers in line. But the rapper lives and dies by the integrity of his flow, which is praiseworthy insofar as it is "live" and "real."  And the movie, which scored an audience award and a big-money distribution deal at Sundance, is a volatile mixture of slickness and sincerity, hard-edged naturalism and sheer show-business hokum. It's certainly live, with fine performances and a strong soundtrack, including music from the Memphis rappers Al Kapone and Three 6 Mafia, but never quite real. A rough, sticky sense of place - you can almost smell the sweat of Memphis coming off the screen - dresses up a story so conventional that it sometimes verges on self-parody. Mr. Brewer's attempt to fuse hip-hop street credibility, art-house cachet and follow-your-dream, triumph-of-the-underdog Hollywood uplift is canny but clumsy.  The film, which he wrote and directed, feels both naïve and cynical, which may turn out to be the key to its success. It's hard to hate a movie that falls so completely for its own hustle. Perhaps more than it intends to, "Hustle & Flow" illustrates the contradictions and distortions that define contemporary popular culture. It depicts - and inhabits - a world in which the only sure determinants of value are money and fame, but that still holds onto sentimental notions of authenticity and regionalism.  The film's embodiment of this paradox is not only DJay, but also Skinny Black (played by the real-life rapper Ludacris, a k a Chris Bridges), who has risen from peddling homemade tapes at the local drive-in to music-video ubiquity and platinum-selling albums. (Ludacris is not the only musical figure to show up in the movie. Isaac Hayes's cameo as a bar owner pays tribute to his place both in Memphis musical history and in the tradition of blaxploitation cinema from which Mr. Brewer takes some stylistic cues.)  DJay, hearing that Skinny is coming back home for the Fourth of July and convincing himself that they knew each other in the old days, decides that his one shot at fame lies in getting a demo tape of his own material into Skinny's hands. He enlists the help of a high school friend, a hard-working family man named Key (Anthony Anderson) who once dreamed of being a producer with his own record label. Key recruits Shelby (DJ Qualls), a white musician, to lay down the beats, and the three of them hole up in a makeshift backroom studio. Their interactions give the movie a rough, boyish humor that undercuts some of the melodrama, and the music they come up with sounds pretty good. In the end, though, it all depends on Skinny. Surely he will remember where he came from, and give a fellow striver the leg up he needs. Or, as DJay more pragmatically puts it, "If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back of my Chevy, I can pimp Skinny."  But as every old-school hip-hop fan knows, pimping ain't easy. It sure is fascinating, though, to rappers and to filmmakers, both black (like the Hughes brothers, who made the wide-eyed documentary "American Pimp") and white (like Mr. Brewer). Not that DJay's life is especially glamorous. He conducts business out of an old Caprice Classic and lives in a run-down, un-air-conditioned house with three prostitutes: Shug (Taraji P. Henson), who is pregnant and weepy; Lexus (Paula Jai Parker), a belligerent stripper; and Nola (Taryn Manning), a skinny young white woman to whom DJay confides his hopes and fears as they wait in the front seat of the Chevy for clients.  The complexity - one might less charitably say the incoherence - of DJay's character requires a lot from an actor, and Mr. Brewer's good fortune in casting Mr. Howard can hardly be overstated. The actor's heavy eyes and downturned mouth convey weariness and worry, but he tries not to presume too heavily on the audience's sympathy. DJay, who sheds a tear when he hears a hymn in church, is also capable of cruelty and selfishness, and the braggadocio of his raps is more often than not tinged with self-pity. "It's hard out here for a pimp," goes the chorus to one of his songs (sung by the honey-voiced Shug), updating a point first made by Big Daddy Kane and noting that one of the problems facing a man in this business is "a lot of bitches jumping ship."  But hold on a minute. What really happens is that DJay throws one of his "bitches" out on the street, along with her toddler, when she dares to question his management skills. A pimp might be forgiven for failing to see his own misogyny - pimping is not a profession usually associated with feminism - but the movie can't just slide off the hook along with its hero. Indeed, the outlaw charisma - the lower-depths soulfulness - that Mr. Brewer lovingly bestows on DJay arises precisely from his ability to keep women in their place. Lexus, after all, is an uncouth loudmouth who won't give the man a moment's peace. Shug, on the other hand, is a picture of weepy, simple-minded maternity. Nola, who hates the life she is living, is nonetheless loyal and smart enough to become the junior partner (or "principal investor") in DJay's rap enterprise. She also has the job of turning off the fan when DJay and his real partners are recording.  Key's wife, Yevette (Elise Neal), meanwhile, who is made to look like a shrew when she talks too much at the dinner table, overcomes her churchly distaste for pimps and prostitutes and shows up at the studio with a plate of sandwiches. By the end, everyone is singing along with a hook that goes "Whoop that trick." The original lyrics, rejected by Key in the interests of radio airplay, were "Beat that bitch."  Not that the movie exactly endorses such behavior; it just can't establish enough distance from its hero. "Everybody gotta have a dream" is the movie's hopeful tag line, which DJay's sideman Shelby glosses as "every man has the right to contribute his own verse." His gender-specific version is truer to the spirit of "Hustle & Flow," where women, if they behave themselves, are allowed to sing backup. This disdain for women is not incidental to the film; it is integral to the fantasy Mr. Brewer is selling, which is that pimping is not as hard as it looks.  "Hustle & Flow" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has brief nudity, sexual situations, obscenity, drug use and violence.
It may be hard out there for a pimp. But things have gone pretty well for Hustle & Flow  writer-director Craig Brewer . He certainly hustled, along with producers John Singleton  and Stephanie Allain , who financed the movie on their own. And the money flowed, when they sold it for a cool $9 mil at Sundance, where its bootstrap uplift counterprogrammed art house fare. Now, amid a blockbuster marketing push, the backlash has begun. The tale of a broke-down Memphis pimp turned rapper is being dismissed as shallow wish fulfillment, poverty porn, a hip-hop cash-in, and just plain silly. Of course, Hustle & Flow  is all those things, but it telegraphs its intentions quite clearly. With 8 Mile  in its rearview, this flick openly guns for the Rocky s. And though Terrence Howard 's nuanced performance as accidental rap artist DJay suggests complex emotions, this is more Singin' in the Rain  than Esther Kahn .
Howard's exquisite ambivalence, which recalls that of Wood Harris  in the undersung Paid in Full , gestures toward a depth the film never intends to plumb. With one glance he pushes beyond stoicism, wordlessly complicating his hangdog defeat, tempering exuberance with anguish. The plot, though, proceeds programmatically. You just have to lock the bar over your lap and submit to the story's climbs and chutesfrom the dry-rot bungalow frustration to the charmed chance meetings and spiritual dustings, from the hot-dog musical discovery to the tragic tumble to the small-pond triumph.
To the film's credit, Memphis never looked worse. Whether you call it high tourism or a ghetto pass, Brewer's movie happily ignores Beale, blues, and barbecue. From DJay's two-tone sedan to the cellulite at a roadside strip joint, Hustle  revels in the skids. And as with Gregg Araki 's prostitution scenes in Mysterious Skin , it leaves the red-light district to examine the sex trade as plied in seemingly innocuous parks and at the mouths of Everycity underpasses. We get to know DJay mostly during the dead time spent waiting to hawk his girl, Taryn Manning 's Nola. Like a dirty-South Kevin Smith , Brewer has an ear for bullshit, the raunchy aside, and the tossed-off snap.
All that said, there's something wrong with Hustle . A bad aftertaste, and not just the dry grit of Memphis dust, but something meaner. A feeling that Brewer's sensibility is way off. Aside from Howard's characterization, the most indelible parts of the movie are the demeaning caricatures forced on DJay's women. The wonderful but squandered Paula Jai Parker  plays her role of shrew stripper girlfriend on the verge of campher only defense against such an injurious sketch. And Taraji P. Henson , who makes the most of her pregnant hooker's helpless dependency, is stuck in the "heart of gold" rut. Elise Neal , as the striver wife of DJay's producer pal (Anthony Anderson ), is trapped by equally cardboard careerist claptrap. And when it all shakes out, the most memorable visual ends up being the camera's relentless push up Manning's skirta move that's fun in a self-consciously voyeuristic flick like Femme Fatale  but here feels cheap. And in another true pimp stroke, Brewer ensures that the two characters with the most innate ambition in his story are white: Manning's washout with a sudden head for business and DJ Qualls 's stoner church pianist who lays down DJay's crunk beats. As cute as Manning and Qualls can be, these seem like multiplex concessions from a director whose next project, Black Snake Moan , starring Samuel L. Jackson  and Justin Timberlake , heads further South, to Robert Johnson 's crossroadswhere the devil buys guitar players' souls and maybe some salable stereotypes too.
