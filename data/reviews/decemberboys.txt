         A sweet end-of-summer respite from Down Under, "December Boys" is a nostalgia-driven coming-of-age drama about four Catholic orphans from the outback given a seaside reprieve from the nuns and heat. A nicely wrought film of modest ambitions, it also marks the first lead film role beyond Harry Potter for young Daniel Radcliffe.
 
 The popular adolescent  wizard, who by all accounts acquitted himself well in London  this year  in a West End production of "Equus," heads a quartet of likable lads playing the title characters. United by their lack of parents and a common birth month, the boys find those bonds tested when they arrive at the home of their hosts, a retired chief petty officer, Bandy (Jack Thompson), and his wife, Skipper (Kris McQuade), situated in a secluded cove.
 


         






   Roughly set in the 1960s (but with a soundtrack that includes songs from a bit later), the film was adapted by Marc Rosenberg from Michael Noonan's popular novel. Being Australia's summer, the holiday covers Christmas, and the kids frolic in the surf and sand and mingle with the cove's colorful inhabitants.
 
 The youngest December boy, Misty (Lee Cormie), is a sensitive, bespectacled kid whose middle-aged self (Max Cullen) narrates the film in flashback. Spit (James Fraser) and Spark (Christian Byers), the middle boys, are adventurous types prone to sneaking smokes and perusing lingerie ads in magazines. Maps (Radcliffe) is the group's ringleader and, as the oldest, is the most aware that their chances of being  adopted decrease with each passing year.
 
 Misty overhears that a local childless couple, Teresa (Victoria Hill) and her motorcyclist husband (Sullivan Stapleton), are considering adoption, leading him, Spit and Spark to compete with one another for their attention. Maps is resolved to enjoy the rare holiday at the beach and finish out his days at the orphanage.
 
 Into this paradise comes an apple-biting free-spirit named Lucy, who does more to rock Maps' little world than simply play him some  Creedence Clearwater Revival on her phonograph. Radcliffe is excellent as the slightly awkward teen who senses a growing distance between himself and his mates. Director Rod Hardy elicits strong performances from the entire cast, but Radcliffe and Cormie bear the real emotional weight of the storytelling. Less successful are some overtly literary elements such as a wild stallion, an old fisherman named Shellback and his pursuit of Henry, a fish of mythic proportions, and Misty's visions of Our Lady that, while adding some fantasy and whimsy, don't entirely mesh with the rest of the film's tone.
 
  "December Boys" is a refreshingly gentle treatment of familiar themes such as the inevitability of change, the dashing of youthful illusions and mutability of family. Enhanced by an exotic locale, the movie overcomes a  well-trodden narrative path and unflinchingly brandishes its sentimentality as it stakes out its crowd-pleasing territory.

Daniel Radcliffe doesn't look uncomfortable, exactly, in December Boys , but he does look like a hot transfer student trying to fit in with local pipsqueaks a head shorter and two grades below him. Then again, were Radcliffe not making his first screen appearance since Harry Potter stardom as the oldest of the title lads, there's a good chance this insular, Oz-centric tale might never have made its way Stateside at all. The boys are orphanage buddies in the early 1960s, sent for a seaside South Australian summer vacation. Frolicking ensues, clouded only when one of the tykes gets wind of a rumor that the quartet might actually be auditioning for adoption. And then competition ensues. Plus some cute-Catholic-childhood stuff involving cartwheeling nuns.
The movie is adapted from Michael Noonan's 1963 novel of the same name, loved in Australia as a modern classic of young-adult literature. And the filmmakers can't decide whether to trust the period innocence of the book (and play down their casting coup) or let the young man rip as a preteen-babe magnet (he's notably shirtless, buff, and attracted to a sexually experienced girl who'd never be allowed into Hogwarts).
So December Boys  splits the difference  safely, dully. Those who want a cheekier Radcliffe are directed to the actor's guest appearance as himself on HBO's Extras , especially when he declares, ''I've done it with a girl, intercourse-wise.'' The line is funny enough to make a nun flip.

 In “December Boys,” Daniel Radcliffe takes a holiday from Harry Potter to play another orphan, this time of the Muggle variety. Too bad his destination is a coming-of-age tale so treacly it doesn’t just tug your heartstrings, it attempts to glue them to your ribs.  As Maps, one of four boys who share a December birthday and the hospitality of a Catholic orphanage in the Australian outback, Mr. Radcliffe may be audience bait but he’s not the film’s fulcrum. That would be Misty (Lee Cormie), a bespectacled dreamer who longs for parents and discovers potential candidates when the boys receive the unexpected gift of a seaside vacation.    While Maps learns about sex, ciggies and Creedence Clearwater Revival from the local wild child (Teresa Palmer), his buddies vie to be adopted by a fairground worker and his seductive wife (Sullivan Stapleton and Victoria Hill). But when the inevitable tragedy strikes — in the form of death, abandonment and a clay-footed hero — its emotional heft is diluted by a screenplay (by Marc Rosenberg, working from Michael Noonan’s novel) mired in fantasy. As cartwheeling nuns frolic on the sand and visions of the Virgin Mary glow beneath the waves, the movie congeals into a soggy, symbolic mess.  As for Mr. Radcliffe, his acting is fine. It’s his career planning that needs some work.  “December Boys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The boys moon the camera, peep at naked women and enjoy a variety of under-age activities.

Destined to be forever known as "Harry Potter Gets Laid," the visually well-mounted but narratively muddled "December Boys," featuring Daniel Radcliffe, is an occasionally touching but rarely convincing coming-of-ager. Starting out like kiddie fare, the film sees its identity altered by awkwardly grafted sexual elements that seem to promise a more mature, continental tone. Oz production should play strongest in Euro markets, with Radcliffe's presence providing curiosity value in theatrical outlets and translating into a long shelf life worldwide on ancillary.
Film plays as if it's set in the '50s, but its Australian pop soundtrack sets it in the '60s. Four lads at an Outback orphanage -- Misty (Lee Cormie), Maps (Radcliffe), Spark (Christian Byers) and Spit (James Fraser) -- are treated to a seaside summer holiday for their shared December "birthday." Voiceover narration by Misty's older self (Oz vet Max Cullen) provides backstory as the quartet are driven to the South Australian coast by rough-and-tumble Irish priest Father Scully (Frank Gallacher). Upon arrival, the boys enter into the care of jocular old sailor Bandy McAnsh (Jack Thompson) and his welcoming wife, Mrs. "Skipper" McAnsh (Kris McQuade).
Yarn feels strictly kidsville with the four frolicking around the beach and hills and making wishes about being adopted, until topless French woman Teresa (Victoria Hill) emerges from the surf. She and her circus stunt-rider b.f., Fearless (Sullivan Stapleton), are childless and, to the boys, ideal potential parents.
The artistically inclined, goody-two-shoes Misty takes the lead in positioning himself as chief adoption candidate. By far the oldest at 17, Maps thinks it unlikely he will ever be adopted. But distracting compensation arrives for Maps in the form of comely blonde teen Lucy (Teresa Palmer), who is also vacationing in the area.
Even before Maps gets his initiation into manhood, Lucy's stance and apparel signal a tonal shift that will alarm conservative parents who've escorted their offspring to what seems like nothing more than an exercise in nostalgia. While screen decency is maintained, the scenes between Palmer and Radcliffe are genuinely erotic, and the less interesting thread of Misty and his adoption ambitions never regains ascendency. The other boys scarcely register as personalities, but a subplot involving Mrs. McAnsh touches an authentic emotional nerve.
Emphasis on other adult activities like drinking and smoking (tobacco inhalation hasn't been so lovingly depicted since David Lynch's "Wild at Heart") seem jarring, rather than truly indicating that pic is actually aimed at adult auds.
While the story's core is sincere, execution is generally slipshod. A climactic twist doesn't pay off, and the "will they or won't they" question of Fearless and Teresa adopting one of the boys is resolved in naive and unbelievable fashion. Finale reuniting the narrator and the surviving "December Boys" as old men sees pic again confused about its audience.
Oz-trained, Los Angeles-based, sometimes film, mainly tube director Rod Hardy ("Buffalo Girls," "The X-Files," "JAG") delivers a patchy helming job. Except for Radcliffe, the boys need a firmer director, and the adult thesps have their best efforts compromised by poor editing.
In tandem with his legit "Equus" venture in Blighty, pic reps Radcliffe's clear ambition to prevent stereotyping. Palmer builds on her impressive turn in Oz high school drama "2:37," and seems destined to be a thesp whose allure is equally matched by her acting chops.
Lensing is top-notch and makes excellent use of Kangaroo Island locations. All other tech credits are pro.

If Daniel Radcliffe  is hoping for an acting life after Harry Potter , he might want to be choosier than this cloying little Australian number about four outback orphan pals with horrid names like Maps and Misty, whose anxieties about outgrowing their chances for adoption bubble over during a summer vacation on the picturesque coast. There, a more colorful life awaits the lads (one of whom, now grown old, supplies the jovial voice-over along with a score made of pure syrup) in the form of a photogenic circus: a blonde teenage siren, a big fish called Henry, and a fortuitously childless couple who can adopt only one of the boys. Dilemma! Hampered by a silly gait and an emotional range that runs from abject to abject, Radcliffe gives by far the movies weakest performance as the depressive Maps. But whats most alienating about this alternately mawkish and ingratiating dramedy is the cheap shot it casually fires at institutional Catholicism while throwing its weight behind wacky visions of the Virgin Mary . Its enough to make anyone run for the priesthood, and somebody does.
