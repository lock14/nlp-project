         The characters in Marjane Satrapi's "Persepolis" (co-directed with Vincent Paronnaud) are simple, friendly black-and-white line drawings, as uncomplicated as characters in a children's book. Which is precisely what throws you when they get themselves put in prison or in front of a firing squad. Satrapi, who in the graphic novels on which the film is based recalls her upbringing in Tehran during the 1970s, '80s and early '90s, has said that she made her characters abstract so that they'd be more universal, so that we could see "us" in them. And it works.
 
 A familiar story set in an unfamiliar context, it's a paean to the universality of human experience, a testament to the endurance of individuality during great political and fanatical upheaval, and a reminder that even the most complex situations, identities and stories are heartbreakingly simple.
 


         






   In an era of sophisticated computer animation, "Persepolis" is a visual throwback to a time when abstraction was a useful aesthetic tool, not something to be overcome for the sake of creepy robotic naturalism. The fictionalized memoir is based on Satrapi's experiences as a young girl from a liberal, cosmopolitan family. The impressive movie spans Satrapi's childhood and young adulthood, from age 7 to age 23, when, having lived through the overthrow of the shah, the Islamic revolution and the even more oppressive fundamentalist regime that followed, the Pyrrhic Iran-Iraq war, a painful period of exile in Austria and a hasty marriage, she decides to leave her country for good. (She now lives in France, and the film is France's Academy Award entry for best foreign language film.)
 
 One of the sad, unintended consequences of making films about troubles in faraway lands is that often the trouble comes to define the place in our eyes, which can have a perverse distancing effect on the beholder. This, in a sense, is what Satrapi experienced after her parents sent her to boarding school in Austria to keep her safe from Islamic fundamentalists. Many Austrians lumped her with the backward tyrants she'd fled.
 
 All of these events are recounted through the experiences of the little girl and, later, the young woman who Satrapi was at the time. Her political consciousness begins to awaken, for instance, when her father gently informs her that the shah was not, in fact, chosen by God, no matter what her teacher says. She soaks up her family's optimism at his ouster and manifests it as exuberance, until it becomes clear to all that the new regime will be even worse than the old.
 
 She nourishes herself on her uncle's idealism and her grandmother's strength (voiced by Danielle Darrieux, Mami is an unforgettable character, a modern woman ahead of her time suddenly thrust into a primitive society), and delights in rebelling in every way she can.  Satrapi buys Western pop and rock records from clandestine vendors lurking on street corners like drug dealers. She talks back to her teachers, who proselytize about the "martyrs" of the war and enforce the veil. She even unthinkingly lobs an unfair accusation at a stranger to deflect police attention from herself.
 
 "Persepolis" also punctures the myth of the oppressed escaping to freedom and living happily ever after. As Satrapi learns in Vienna, exile brings its own problems. There's a shift in identity, which in her case coincides with adolescence, from staunch objector to exotic flotsam. The solidarity of shared experience -- and moral certainty -- that emboldened her in Iran doesn't exist for her in Vienna. The best she can do is hang out with the misfits at her school, a bunch of disaffected rich kids with a trendy interest in exotic social ideologies, for whom politics are little more than image-enhancing esoteric theories.
 
 Satrapi's entire life has been shaped by struggle, and the removal of that struggle and of the connection to others and sense of self it forged leaves her weak, lost and vulnerable. And yet a return to Iran -- a logical, and yet impossible move -- also fells her. She is an exile in her own country and abroad. How she overcomes this to become productive and make something of her experiences is, in a sense, what "Persepolis" is all about.

 “Persepolis” is a simple story told by simple means. Like Marjane Satrapi’s book, on which it is based, the film, directed by Ms. Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, consists essentially of a series of monochrome drawings, their bold black lines washed with nuances of gray. The pictures are arranged into the chronicle of a young girl’s coming of age in difficult times, a tale that unfolds with such grace, intelligence and charm that you almost take the wondrous aspects of its execution for granted.  In this age of Pixar and “Shrek,” it is good to be reminded that animation is rooted not in any particular technique, but in the impulse to bring static images to life. And “Persepolis,” austere as it may look, is full of warmth and surprise, alive with humor and a fierce independence of spirit. Its flat, stylized depiction of the world —  the streets and buildings of Tehran and Vienna in particular  —  turns geography into poetry.  If “Persepolis” had been a conventional memoir rather than a graphic novel, Ms. Satrapi’s account of her youth in pre- and post-revolutionary Iran would not have been quite as moving or as marvelous. Similarly, if the movie version had been conventionally cast and acted, it would inevitably have seemed less magical as well as less real.  It would also probably not have starred Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve and Danielle Darrieux, the three formidable French actresses who give voice to young Marjane, her mother and her grandmother. Sony Pictures Classics, which is releasing “Persepolis” in the United States, could easily have dubbed it into English, a change that might have broadened the film’s appeal for a subtitle-phobic American audience. But then we would have missed the music of those incomparable movie star voices, and also a delightful parallel between cast and characters. Ms. Deneuve is Ms. Mastroianni’s mother in real life, and Ms. Darrieux played Ms. Deneuve’s mother in “The Young Girls of Rochefort” 40 years ago.  Ms. Darrieux’s Grandma is the sturdy matriarchal anchor of “Persepolis,” a source of humor, advice and moral guidance for young Marjane, and also an embodiment of the film’s no-nonsense feminism. Like her grandmother, Marjane is a natural rebel, someone who takes freedom as her birthright and dares the world to challenge her.  Needless to say, the world obliges. Marjane grows up in a family of left-wing intellectuals who suffer first under the Shah’s dictatorship and then, as the triumphant Islamic revolutionaries turn on their secular allies, under the rule of the mullahs. This political history, which includes war, torture and execution, is conveyed with impressive economy and visual wit. The beards of male religious zealots — and the chadors of their female counterparts —  are like black holes in the screen, sucking away the light. (Later, during Marjane’s exile in Vienna, a straying boyfriend is transformed from an angel-headed paragon into a sniveling, buck-toothed cretin.)  Against the forces of intolerance and superstition, Marjane, following her grandmother’s example, takes an impetuous stand as a champion of enlightenment. Though she is self-confident and sometimes a little self-righteous, Ms. Satrapi doesn’t wrap herself in heroism. The political dimensions of her story are as clear and bold as her graphic style, but “Persepolis” traffics more in feelings than in slogans, and dwells most persuasively on the uncertainty and ambivalence of adolescence.  Fearing for her safety in a time of war and political repression, Marjane’s parents (her father is voiced by Simon Abkarian) send her to Austria, and the alienation she experiences there is a sad counterpart to the anxiety of Tehran. She loses herself for a while in punk rock and other alternative pleasures, but finds little to sustain her in the easy nihilism of European alternative culture. And it is in Vienna that the full pathos of her situation becomes clear, a dilemma that is hardly hers alone. Either she can be more or less free and give up her home, or she can return home at the cost of her freedom and individuality.  “Persepolis” dramatizes this dilemma without forcing it into an easy or sentimental resolution. While the character of her younger self sometimes slips into depression or dramatic behavior, Ms. Satrapi, as a writer and filmmaker, seems utterly devoid of self-pity. Grandma, whose life was long, difficult and rich, clearly had no time for such indulgences, and it is not hard to see that Marjane lived up to her example.  “Persepolis” is frequently somber, but it is also whimsical and daring, a perfect expression of the imagination’s resistance to the literal-minded and the power-mad, who insist that the world can be seen only in black and white.  “Persepolis” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scenes of violence and sexuality, for the most part discreetly and obliquely drawn.

Any stragglers still unconvinced that animation can be an exciting medium for both adults and kids will run out of arguments in the face of "Persepolis." Like the four-volume series of graphic novels on which it's based, this autobiographical tour de force is completely accessible and art of a very high order. First-person tale of congenitally rebellious Marjane Satrapi, who was 8 years old when the Islamic Revolution transformed her native Teheran, boasts a bold lyricism spanning great joy and immense sorrow. In both concept and execution,  hand-drawn toon is a winner. Sony Classics will release an English-dubbed version Stateside.
France-based Satrapi, who co-directed with fellow illustrator Vincent Paronnaud, is a sterling example of what good advice "Write (and draw) what you know" can be in gifted hands. Pic's specificity is what renders it universal. From Baltimore to Beijing, anybody who ever had a family, a government and/or aspirations for personal happiness should be able to relate.
Narrative, which starts in 1978 and continues into the 1990s, could have been just another coming-of-age tale, but Satrapi and Paronnaud navigate their sharp melding of form and content with assurance. Result zips along with considerable humor, much of it self-deprecating, interspersed with darker material.
Animation perfectly translates Satrapi's deceptively simple black and white drawings. Much like Art Spiegelman's anthropomorphic cats and mice vis-a-vis the history of the Shoah in "Maus," Satrapi's expressive, pleasingly pared down style lends itself to the pleasures of everyday life as well as the horrors of war and state repression. Original books used only stark black and white;  shades of gray and evocative backgrounds are added for the screen, along with subtle patches of color in select settings.
Made entirely in France, three-year project required the skills of Gaul's last working animation tracers (armed with felt-tip pens) and looks terrific on a budget of $8.1 million.
Protag's voiceover is woven into highly visual tale, with a dynamite cast voicing the main characters. (Satrapi works in French, so that is what the whole population of Teheran speaks.)
Adorable, spirited Marjane (Gabrielle Lopes) is an only child, raised with love and encouraged in her singularity and independence by educated, intellectual parents Tadji (Catherine Deneuve) and Ebi (Simon Abkarian). Feisty Marjane couldn't be closer to her wise, indomitable grandmother (magnificently voiced by vet Danielle Darrieux), whose frank blend of classy and earthy is irresistible. The Satrapi family values creativity, decency, personal courage and, as often as possible, a good time.
At pic's outset, the Shah's days are numbered. There is great excitement in the Satrapi household whose occupants trust that the people of Iran, having had their fill of dictatorship, will usher in a new era of freedom and prosperity. But they would be wrong.
Young Marjane watches her familiar secular existence morph into theocratic lunacy, with headscarves mandatory and repressive idiocy the order of the day. Still a child, she goes on speaking out, with trouble never far behind. Friends and relatives are imprisoned or worse. Iraq starts an eight-year war and the knee-jerk culture of martyrdom takes hold with a vengeance. 
But despite Khomeini, Marjane and her friends show off their contraband Bee Gees and ABBA records and buy bootleg cassettes peddled as if they were heroin.
Knowing they can't tame their daughter's outspoken nature and fearing for her safety, Marjane's parents send her to Vienna, solo, at age 14. (As a teen and adult, Marjane is splendidly voiced by Chiara Mastroianni.)
The roller coaster of Marjane's life is just getting started. People, as well as countries, have to learn the hard way what works and what doesn't.
In decrying conformity and totalitarianism, intelligent toon demonstrates how ideology perverts human nature. Pic champions integrity and resistance and shows that even smarter-than-average people sometimes do dumb things.
These characters smoke like chimneys, but only an ayatollah would mandate an R-rating based on animated individuals "inhaling" pen and ink smoke. They also blow off steam thanks to Iron Maiden, Bruce Lee and, in one of toon's best set pieces, the "Rocky" theme "Eye of the Tiger."
Marjane's intellectual fantasies include chats with God and Karl Marx perched in the heavens. The growth spurt during which Marjane's limbs and features hatch like recalcitrant Silly Putty is a visual highlight.
Thoughtful score provides spot-on accompaniment to everything from pointless death to first love. So far, Gena Rowlands has been announced as the English-lingo voice of the grandmother and Deneuve is slated to reprise her role in Yank dub. 


Persepolis   is a small landmark in feature animation. Not because of technical innovationthough it moves fluidly enough, and its drawings have a handcrafted charm forgotten in the era of the cross-promoted-to-saturation CGI-'toon juggernautsbut because it translates a sensitive, introspective, true-to-life, "adult" comic story into moving pictures. While Robert Crumb  only achieved the big screen as a porno-groovy shadow of himself and Daniel Clowes  decamped to live- action, Marjane Satrapi 's made the crossing; with the aide of French comic-book artist Vincent "Winshluss" Paronnaud (both making their first feature here), Satrapi's four autobiographical Persepolis  volumes have been smartly streamlined and storyboarded into 95 minutes of screen time.
We first meet little Marjane (voiced by Gabrielle Lopes ) in 1978. A rambunctious Bruce Lee  acolyte, she's the mouthy only child of a progressive Tehran  family anxiously watching their shah's repressive government give way to the ayatollah's far worse fundamentalist revolution. The state of the nation steadily carries on its bad-to-badder momentum through the mid-'80s, and to protect their daughter from the escalating war with Iraq , Marjane's parents send the now-adolescent girl (at this point voiced by Chiara Mastroianni ) into exile at a Viennese Lycée Française. Until then, Marjane's personal history naturally overlaps with her country's (her bedroom, where she violently headbangs to Iron Maiden , morphs into the border's battlefields). But once abroad and displaced from the culture that had nourished her, however, the wider world recedes, and teenage Marjane's focus turns inwardshe's victimized by boys and by her alien pubescent body, and she starts freely sampling subcultures in an attempt to re-establish her sense of self. The film's latter chapters bring her home for the university years, where the strictures of Islamic law have pulled even tighter.
Though the Persepolis  comix carried the up-market "Graphic Novel" tag, there's nothing obscure or "difficult" about the film they became. The characters are downright cute, rendered in a clean, comfortingly rounded line. The comic relief tends toward doofy, broad crowd-pleasers (e.g., a leg-humping pet pooch and a rambunctious scene of renewed self-determination scored to a tunelessly warbled "Eye of the Tiger"). Sentiment and nostalgia are unabashedly indulgedMarjane isn't quite addressing "Somewhere Out There" to the night sky, but many a scene open-ends onto a lingeringly poignant coda (the emotion, I should say, never feels chintzy). An especial dreaminess is reserved for the privileged memories of the elder generation's lost, lovely sartorial habitsa newly liberated uncle's gift to Marjane of a swan made from prison bread crumbs; a beloved grandmother's habit of filling her bra with jasmine petalsreminders of a once-poetic national character too delicate to weather the changing times.
Our heroine's early girlhood is marked by this imperiled sense of enchantment, as the movie uses an imaginative kid's tendency to color the world with make-believe as a license for expressionistic ornament. Dancing marionettes illustrate to Marjane how British interlopers propped up the shah; a recounted escape from government persecution takes on the quality of a fable.
Satrapi and Paronnaud say they were inspired in part by silent-era German Expressionism, which is evident in the film's dynamic gouges of black; some of their most striking scenes are in silhouette, suggesting Lotte Reiniger 's lacework-detailed Orientalist animation of the '20s. Persepolis , hand-penned by a team in Satrapi's adopted home of Paris, is almost entirely black-and-whitethe exception is a framing device that finds a grown-up expatriate Marjane reminiscing from Orly airport. The books were largely drawn in pure China-ink simplicity, but the film is ambitious with effects. As fundamentalism lowers its pall over Tehran, Persepolis  imparts the cultural sea change with a schoolyard of upturned girl's faces in an inky ocean of newly imposed cloaks and headdresses; when little Marjane, punked-out inasmuch as Islamic law will allow, is accosted on the street by two female zealots, the women appear lamia-like, solid black bodies coiling around their prey.
The guts of the thing, though, are in Satrapi's embroidery of quotidian details: the thrill of scoring contraband Western pop off the streets; the routine absurdity of a university "Life Drawing" class where all that's exposed is the model's face, the rest concealed under a tent of hijab ; the smuggling of illegal homemade wine into house parties that could turn fatal with a knock on the door; the horny teenagers recruited into martyrdom with government-issued plastic keys to a Live Nude Girls "Paradise" (that capacity for make- believe gone very awry). The accessibility of her firsthand addresshow Satrapi refits epic national tragedy to an identifiably personal scalehas made Persepolis  college curriculum and its maker something of a spokeswoman. She's even earned a tribute of sorts from back home. Her movie's Jury Prizewinning stand at Cannes  got a response from an Iranian government- affiliated cultural foundation; the film stands accused of presenting "an unrealistic face of the achievements and results of the glorious Islamic Revolution."
