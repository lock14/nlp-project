Had blaring news of Owen Wilson's personal crisis not reached his public so close to the release of The Darjeeling Limited , Wes Anderson's picaresque story of three brothers (Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody) who carry their emotional baggage on a train voyage across India would still resonate with vivid sadness. His head outlandishly bandaged in contradiction with the insouciance of his surfer-blond hair, Wilson's character is the one sibling among the three who has actively tried to hurt himself in response to family unhappiness: Father is dead, and a drifty, self-absorbed mother (Anjelica Huston) ignores her sons while searching for her own bliss in a Himalayan nunnery. Now he is trying to reestablish kinship, and he's up against resistance. Estranged from one another, each son is a quirky piece of work in his own right; together on a train, they're a rolling family-therapy experiment.
This is familiar psychological as well as stylistic territory for Anderson after Rushmore  and The Royal Tenenbaums . But there's a startling new  maturity in Darjeeling , a compassion for the larger world that busts the confines of the filmmaker's miniaturist instincts. (A jolting, unironic plot turn may even shock.) I don't know which came first  inspiration provided by the beauty and complexity of India, or an attraction to India because of a wiser heart. But either way, foreign travel is a growth opportunity for these passengers.

 To call “The Darjeeling Limited” precious is less a critical judgment than a simple statement of fact, equivalent to saying that the movie is in color, that it’s set in India or that it’s 91 minutes long. It’s synonymous with saying the movie was directed by Wes Anderson. By now — “The Darjeeling Limited” is his fifth feature film — Mr. Anderson’s methods and preoccupations are as familiar as the arguments for and against them. (See an essay in the current issue of The Atlantic Monthly for the prosecution and a profile in this week’s New York magazine for the defense.) His frames are, once again, stuffed with carefully placed curiosities, both human and inanimate; his story wanders from whimsy to melancholy; his taste in music, clothes, cars and accessories remains eccentric and impeccable.  And like his other recent films, “The Royal Tenenbaums” and “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,” this new one celebrates a sensibility at once cliquish and inclusive. It reflects the aesthetic obsessions of a tiny coterie that anyone with the price of a ticket is free to join. (Charter members include Owen Wilson, one of the film’s three leading men, and his co-star Jason Schwartzman, who wrote the script with Mr. Anderson and Roman Coppola.)  Precious, in any case, is a word with two meanings, which both might apply to “The Darjeeling Limited.” This shaggy-dog road trip, in which three semi-estranged brothers travel by rail across India, is unstintingly fussy, vain and self-regarding. But it is also a treasure: an odd, flawed, but nonetheless beautifully handmade object as apt to win affection as to provoke annoyance. You might say that it has sentimental value.  Whether sentimental value can be willed into being and marketed with movie studio money is an interesting question. What is beyond doubt is that Mr. Anderson’s main characters and creative collaborators share with him a passion for collecting rare objects and unusual experiences, all of which they handle with exquisite, jealous care.  The fraternal trio in “The Darjeeling Limited” — Francis, Jack and Peter Whitman — express, and perhaps construct, their personalities largely through their attachment to things. Francis (Mr. Wilson) has an expensive leather belt, which he tentatively offers as a gift to Peter (Adrien Brody), who cherishes a pair of sunglasses that once belonged to their father. The third brother, Jack (Mr. Schwartzman), is a bit less of a commodity fetishist, though he does have a thing for the savory snacks served on Indian trains (and for the women who serve them).  Francis, Peter and Jack share a huge set of luggage, like those sunglasses a legacy of the father whose death hangs over their journey like a mournful mist. All those grips and valises, piled onto railways cars, buses, donkey carts and other conveyances, can be taken as a metaphor, a kind of visual pun on the emotional baggage these brothers are clearly carrying around. (By the way, this matched, monogrammed set of symbols, we learn in the credits, was designed by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton, with “suitcase wildlife drawings” by Eric Anderson.)  The trip has been planned by Francis, with compulsive attention to detail (perhaps a bit of self-satire on the director’s  part) and with an explicit therapeutic purpose. He wants them all to bond, to be “brothers like we used to be,” to “say yes to everything.”  Mostly he expects Peter and Jack to assent to his control-freak instructions, and the friction that arises from their resistance gives “The Darjeeling Limited” its off-kilter comic texture. The movie may be designed  within an inch of its life, but there is life in it all the same, an open, relaxed narrative rhythm that cuts against the tight visual arrangements.  Part of the pleasure of watching it comes from never knowing quite what will happen next. Not that everything that happens is pleasant. Wes  Anderson’s world may be a place of wonder and caprice, but it is also a realm of melancholy and frustration, as if all the cool, exotic bric-a-brac had been amassed to compensate for a persistent feeling of emptiness. The Whitman boys may seem happy-go-lucky, but on closer inspection they don’t look very happy at all.  And even when we learn bits and pieces of their history — their father is dead; their mother (Anjelica Huston) ran off to become a nun; they have been variously disappointed in love and friendship — the sorrow is never traced to its source. Nor is it ever entirely banished. (Some of that sadness drifts in from beyond the screen; it is hard to look at Mr. Wilson’s bruised, bandaged face and weary eyes without being reminded of his recent suicide attempt.)  Mr. Anderson is clumsiest when he tries to confront intense emotion directly. The death of an Indian child, for instance, is less a dramatic crisis than an aesthetic opportunity, a chance for the brothers (and the filmmakers) to explore another aspect of the beauty and mystery of India.  “The Darjeeling Limited” amounts finally to a high-end, high-toned tourist adventure. I don’t mean this dismissively; it would be hypocritical of me to deny the delights of luxury travel to faraway lands. And Mr. Anderson’s eye for local color — the red-orange-yellow end of the spectrum in particular — is meticulous and admiring.  But humanism lies either beyond his grasp or outside the range of his interests. His stated debt to “The River,” Jean Renoir’s film about Indian village life, and his use of music from the films of Satyajit Ray represent both an earnest tribute to those filmmakers and an admission of his own limitations. They were great directors because they extended the capacity of the art form to comprehend the world that exists. He is an intriguing and amusing director because he tirelessly elaborates on a world of his own making.  It is certainly a world worth visiting, though a short stay may be preferable to an extended sojourn. At the New York Film Festival — where it will be shown as the opening-night selection this evening — “The Darjeeling Limited” will be preceded by a short, written and directed by Mr. Anderson, called “Hotel Chevalier.”  That film, which visits Jack Whitman (Natalie Portman visits him too) at some point before the events chronicled in the feature, will accompany “Darjeeling” on DVD, but not when it opens in New York theaters tomorrow.  It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson’s vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry. “The Darjeeling Limited” is an overstuffed suitcase. “Hotel Chevalier” is a small gem.  “The Darjeeling Limited” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex, drug use and profanity.

Three estranged brothers bond and get rid of some literal and figurative baggage during a trip across India in Wes Anderson's colorful and kinetic seriocomedy "The Darjeeling Limited." Breaking no new ground thematically, pic comes closer to "The Royal Tenenbaums" than "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou," but without achieving the poignance of "Rushmore." Inventively staged pic should satisfy the upscale, youth and cult auds Anderson has developed, though it's unlikely to draw significantly better than his earlier work. Following its Venice and New York fest bows, Fox Searchlight item will go into limited U.S. release on Sept. 29.
India's vibrant landscapes and varied modes of travel, in particular the confined space of the locomotive, prove extremely congenial to Anderson's brand of visual humor and widescreen setups. Framing, choreography and physical comedy reference classic train flicks ranging from "Twentieth Century" and "A Night at the Opera" to "A Hard Day's Night."
After a short prologue that neatly epitomizes India's color and chaos -- and offers a cameo for Anderson regular Bill Murray -- pic settles into a first-class sleeping cabin aboard the Darjeeling Limited, where the Whitman brothers have gathered. Francis ( frequent Anderson collaborator Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (co-scripter Jason Schwartzman) haven't spoken since their father's funeral one year earlier.
Clearly, the siblings all have some healing to do. Francis, the eldest, is swathed in mummy-like bandages resulting from a motorcycle accident (an image that could have unintended resonance for auds who have followed Wilson's recent personal crises). Middle child Peter can't come to terms with his wife's pregnancy. And Jack, the youngest, is so obsessed with his ex-girlfriend he continually eavesdrops on her answering machine.
Armed with a supply of Indian pain relievers, the brothers play catch-up and fall into familiar family patterns. Francis tries to impose his itineraries and menu decisions, Peter flaunts their father's possessions and implies he was the favorite child, and Jack tries to avoid their quarreling through a whirlwind affair with comely train stewardess Rita (Amara Karan).
After they're ejected from the train for egregious rule-breaking, Francis reveals an ulterior motive behind the trip: He wants them to visit their mother (Anjelica Huston), who's now a nun in a Himalayan convent, but she seems less than keen to see them. The convent scenes humorously establish the source of Francis' most irritating mannerisms and pave the way for spiritual healing.
Here, as in his two prior outings, Anderson's arch, highly artificial style gets in the way of character and emotional development, rendering pic piquant rather than profound. Despite intense perfs by Wilson and Brody, Francis and Peter come off as not particularly nice. Schwartzman and Huston fare best at humanizing their characters, while newcomer Karan makes a strong impression as the sexy "sweet lime" girl.
Script gets sibling dynamics down pat, with oft-repeated lines accumulating meaning throughout pic.
Tech credits are top-notch, with particular kudos to Mark Friedberg's gorgeous, intricate production design and Robert Yeoman's nimble lensing. A specially designed, numbered luggage set from Louis Vuitton plays a significant role.
Music track effectively sets the mood with selections from Indian film scores alternating with choice rock tunes.
In Venice, pic screened with a nifty 13-minute short, "Hotel Chevalier," identified in the end credits as "Part 1 of 'The Darjeeling Limited.' " Completed in 2005, pic shows Jack and his ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) in the titular Parisian hotel.
Short provides a potent prologue that further serves to make Jack the most sympathetic of the brothers and adds resonance to visual motifs that recur in the feature. Per Anderson, "Hotel Chevalier" will not be shown in theaters, but rather on the Internet, at festivals and on DVD.

The estranged brothers Whitman have reunited for a journey on board The Darjeeling Limited , a colorful old locomotive traversing the Rajasthan  region of India. Along the way, they will stop to visit temples ("Probably one of the most spiritual places on earth!") and shop for souvenirs (slippers, cobras, pepper spray), with plenty of time to take in the sights, sample the local delicacies (lime-flavored drinks, opiate-rich cough syrups) and wonder where, exactly, they're destined to arrive.
Francis (Owen Wilson ), the eldest, has organized the trip despite a recent motorcycle mishap that left his head bandaged in gauze, but fully conscious that the Whitman boys have more than geographical distances to cross. It is the journey, he knows, and not the destination that counts, even as he ensures they're heading in the general direction of a particular convent in the Himalayan foothills, home to a nun called Sister Whitman, first name Patricia (Anjelica Huston ), better known to the boys as "Mom."
Father died a year ago and mother skipped the funeral. Both absences continue to haunt the Whitman brothers, each of whom, as befits their name, contain a multitude of hurtas well as a signature look. Jack (Jason Schwartzman ), the youngest, mourns a recent breakup with his girlfriend and tends to go barefoot in expensive, well-cut suits. With oversized sunglasses, pink boxer shorts, and a gigantic nose, middle child Peter (Adrien Brody ) broods over a baby expected in the coming month from a woman he isn't entirely sure he ought to have married. Francis wears his crown of gauze, over injuries physical and otherwise, and hides his insecurities behind the mask of confidence that comes naturally to first-born sons.
Individually damaged and isolated in their styles, the Whitman boys share one thing in common: a handsome set of trunks, suitcases, satchels, and bags passed down from their father. Luxuriously constructed in leather and emblazoned with matching cartoon motifs (animals, palm trees), the luggage was designed by Marc Jacobs  for Louis Vuitton , but it's writer-director Wes Anderson  who turns it into baggage.
Literalizing the emotional baggage of the Whitman brothers is an awfully blunt conceit, and one that points directly to what works and what doesn't in Darjeeling . Anderson half succeeds in escaping the impasse of his last picture, The Life Aquatic , the first where his extravagant sense of whimsystorybook set, color-coded costumes, yearning pop songsfailed to carry emotion and so flailed as mere (and maddening) mannerism. That stumble may have been unavoidable on the heels of The Royal Tenenbaums , a high triumph of tragicomic imagination where style and feeling are inextricable, mutually dependent.
When Ben Stiller  sports a tracksuit in Tenenbaums , it's the saddest kind of joke, signaling his readiness to save his kids at a moment's notice as well as stasis, fear, and insecurity about his role in the larger Tenenbaum family. You could name a dozen movies since that try on similar sartorial gimmicks, none of which grasp what's at stake behind the style; in the upcoming indie phenomenon Juno , to take only the most recent example, the running gag of a randomly appearing track team decked out in cutesy matching outfits functions as a momentary touch of colorful, empty formalism.
Anderson perfected such strategies in Rushmore  (1998), the most influential indie since 1992's Reservoir Dogs . Self-referential from the get-go, Darjeeling  nods to that touchstone in its opening sequence: Bill Murray , resurrected as a hipster hero in Rushmore , rushes to catch the departing Darjeeling and, to the strains of "This Time Tomorrow" by the Kinks, fails. Has Anderson sensed the need to move on? Filming in a strange milieu impossible to micro-manage forces a somewhat looser grip on the material, and results in a story that pitches from the dramatically precise (Jack's fleeting romance with an employee of the Darjeeling) to the skittishly farcical. "We're just trying to experience  something," muses Francis, summarizing both the sincerity and confusion of Darjeeling  itself.
A companion piece to Tenenbaums  more than a step in new directions, Darjeeling  is a movie about people trapped in themselves and what it takes to get freea movie, quite literally, about letting go of your baggage. We bring our own to the movies, so let me cop to mine. I was moved by Darjeeling , flaws and all, but if my job is to explain why, I find it difficult for reasons that are none of my business. From the minute Wilson walks onscreen, face covered in scars, eyes full of trouble, Darjeeling  is warped by the gravitas of his recent suicide attempt. Anderson and Wilson are old friends and frequent collaborators, of course, and it's hard not to sense them working through more than one impasse here.
