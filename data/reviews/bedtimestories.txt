'Bedtime Stories" is baloney on Wonder Bread with a Kraft Single and some Miracle Whip - barely lunchable. But many hungry kids (and a few adults) will bite. At some point, with the music swelling or about to swell, a school principal, played by Courteney Cox, complains to her brother, "I'm mad that you told my kids there are no happy endings!" Lady, you left your son and daughter with Adam Sandler, whose fault is that?
Sandler, of course, comports himself predictably - like the infantile uncle a grown man named Skeeter ought to be. When soon-to-be-jobless Principal Cox goes off to look for new work, a co-worker (Keri Russell) and Skeeter perform tag-team babysitting chores for the kids (Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling). Cox is playing one of those Organic Moms - gluten-free everything, no sugar, no TV, no fun. That explains her relative absence from this oversweetened movie. All the high-fructose corn syrup would kill her.
The kids like stories before bed, so Skeeter makes up his own tale, which puts his real-life troubles into various fantasies that he suspects are starting to come true. Skeeter works as a handyman in a Los Angeles hotel his late father (Jonathan Pryce) sold years before to a British mogul (Richard Griffiths), who never made good on his promise to give Skeeter an executive role.
The gist of the movie and Skeeter's stories is that he's overdue for respect. He competes with a prissy, unembarrassable Guy Pearce for a promotion, while the movie slaps together a bunch of fantasy set pieces (Wild West, ancient Rome, outer space) and a possible love story between Sandler and Russell. For no reason, the British comedian Russell Brand is tossed on, as is Lucy Lawless, who, as Pearce's henchwoman, is almost funny.
But everything is badly executed (the director is the quality-averse Adam Shankman), especially a last-minute attempt to rescue an elementary school moments away from demolition. When the kids take over storytelling duties, the inconsistency and randomness of their tales suggest they might have written the rest of Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy's screenplay, too.
The appeal of "Bedtime Stories" belongs entirely to Sandler. As a comedian, he doesn't have to stoop to a kid's level. He's usually already there. Here he fights a giant "booger monster." He says "wedgie" and "manure." He talks with his mouth full of food, and after a bee stings his tongue, he babbles. And he appears to mean every minute of it. If small children respond to him at all, it's because for 95 minutes he's speaking their language.


Kids love Adam Sandler , who has played more than his share of men who would be boys, so a cockeyed kiddie fantasy flick ought to be a natural fit for him. But Bedtime Stories  is even worse than his innocuous Hanukkah cartoon, Eight Crazy Nights   (2002). It's a dispirited, galumphing mess in which Sandler, as a hotel handyman who spins out tall tales for his niece and nephew, pictures himself in assorted historical-kitsch guises (doofus medieval peasant, doofus Wild West cowpoke, doofus space warrior, etc.), all of which add up to a soggier sponge cake of a time-trip burlesque than Mel Brooks' History of the World: Part I .

 Adam Sandler is at that difficult age. Now 42, he’s too old to continue with the bungling, man-child shtick of yore, yet too young to transition to old-fogey infantilism. In “Bedtime Stories” the pain of this artistic limbo is written all over his character, a resentful hotel handyman named Skeeter. Astonishingly, his name is not the source of his umbrage.  Skeeter’s pique (though he may not know it) is reserved for his dead father, an inept businessman whose cozy motel once occupied the lot where Skeeter’s current employer has erected an upscale resort. Gone, along with the homespun vibe, is Skeeter’s dream of one day running the property; so when his divorced sister, Wendy (a frighteningly taut Courteney Cox), asks him to baby-sit for his young niece and nephew (Laura Ann Kesling and Jonathan Morgan Heit) for a few days, Skeeter is in no mood to play scallywag uncle.  “I don’t believe in happy endings,” he tells his incredulous charges when story time comes around. Luckily for the tykes, their director, Adam Shankman, loves them, the happier the better. (Even as a guest judge on “So You Think You Can Dance” Mr. Shankman, a popular choreographer, squirmed mightily to avoid delivering a bad critique.)  Rolling up his sleeves and piling on the digital effects, he labors to whip life into a screenplay (by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy) so tired even Bugsy, the children’s pop-eyed guinea pig, is moved to tuck himself into bed.  But Mr. Shankman is not one to give up without a fight. And as the children concoct their own stories, Skeeter and the rest of the cast are dragged through a variety of threadbare fantasies — an Old West showdown, a medieval joust, a chariot race in ancient Greece — in which Skeeter inevitably bests the villain and bags the girl. The adorable Keri Russell, as the unfortunate target of Skeeter’s passive-aggressive affections, is the movie’s soft center and sole pleasure: a locus of calm in a sea of turmoil.  Faring less well are performers whose tenure in children’s entertainment will, I hope, be brief, including Lucy Lawless as a brittle desk clerk and Russell Brand as Skeeter’s fuzzily written best friend. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce’s atrocious turn as the hotel’s pompous manager would be a lock. Mugging beneath a horrendous coif, he makes Basil Fawlty look like a paragon of restraint.  Almost everyone leaves blood on the floor, but “Bedtime Stories” refuses to be juiced; soured by its enervated star and uninspired writing, the movie offers only tiny moments of joy, like a hailstorm of gumballs that’s unexpectedly magical.  Clearly, pushing Skeeter’s broom doesn’t agree with Mr. Sandler, who seems impatient with immaturity and anxious to grow up. He was much happier selling novelty toilet plungers in “Punch-Drunk Love,” but the director of that movie, Paul Thomas Anderson, recognized his star’s natural inner rage and how to tap into it, encouraging a revelatory performance unlike anything on his résumé.  If Mr. Sandler hopes to shift smoothly into more mature roles (as indicated by last year’s “Reign Over Me”), he needs directors who understand his uncommon gifts. The toilet plungers are optional.  “Bedtime Stories” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). Stampeding horses, angry dwarves and a Booger Monster.

Not long ago, it would have been inconceivable to see the words "Adam Sandler" and "Disney family film" in the same sentence, but parenthood does strange things to people. With "Bedtime Stories," Sandler has delivered on his promise to make a movie his kids can enjoy. What's more, he's managed to do so without alienating his core audience. While the comedy -- about a hotel handyman whose outlandish tales spring to life -- clearly skews to a younger demo, there's enough sophomoric humor here to reassure the Sandler faithful. Combo of Sandler regulars plus family audiences augurs well for a B.O. happy ending.
From the outset, "Bedtime Stories" has a fanciful, whimsical spirit -- hardly surprising given that its helmer, Adam Shankman, put the sparkle in "Hairspray." Working from a script by Matt Lopez and frequent Sandler scribe Tim Herlihy, Shankman has conjured a world in which bad things (divorce, corporate greed) do exist, but good things (a spontaneous gumball shower!) are always just around the corner. Skeptics should check their disbelief at the door for this fantasy. A brief prologue establishes Sandler's character, Skeeter: As a boy (played by Thomas Hoffman), he watched his dad Marty (Jonathan Pryce, narrating) run the family motel business into the ground. Forced to sell the motel to zealous developer Barry Nottingham (Herlihy in flashback, Richard Griffiths throughout), Marty saw his dreams evaporate.
Some 30 years later, Skeeter is fixing toilets and tweaking TV sets as the highrise Nottingham Hotel's lowly maintenance man, only to watch brown-nosing manager Kendall (a conniving Guy Pearce) become Nottingham's designated successor. Skeeter, meanwhile, covets Nottingham's party-girl daughter Violet (Aussie Teresa Palmer); his offbeat pal, Mickey (Russell Brand, hilarious but underused), lends a supportive ear.
When Skeeter's sister (Courteney Cox) goes out of town, she asks Skeeter to babysit her kids, Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit). He shares the task with her friend Jill (imminent love interest Keri Russell, delightful).�Skeeter quickly learns the path to avuncular success involves elaborate bedtime stories. Inspired by aspects of Skeeter's daily life, the tales are vividly enacted onscreen.
Like most kids, Bobbi and Patrick have their own story ideas (guess who suggests the gumball deluge). The first tale, set in medieval times, posits Sandler as the underappreciated Sir Fix-a-lot, repeatedly trounced by Sir Buttkiss (Pearce). When Skeeter's tale concludes on a pessimistic note, the kids demand a new ending in which Fix-a-lot gets another chance to impress the king (Griffiths).
The next day, Skeeter is the beneficiary of a surprise reversal from Nottingham that sets up a climactic showdown with Kendall. Skeeter soon discovers the kids' story edits can also impact his own life. Future bedtime stories take him to the Old West (as cowboy Jeremiah Skeets), ancient Rome (chariot-riding Skeetacus) and outer space (futuristic warrior Skeeto). Final reel weaves together several story strands and gives Skeeter a long-awaited chance at personal redemption. In a series of tasks worthy of Hercules -- or at least Skeetacus -- our hero must save the kids, win over his true love and defeat his nemesis. Of course, it wouldn't be a Sandler movie without a little crude humor, so watch for a booger monster, a bee-stung tongue and a snot-nosed dog.
Upstaging the dog for comic relief, though, is Bugsy, a guinea pig with Marty Feldman eyes. A CG/live-action composite that grownups may find annoying but young moviegoers will adore, Bugsy is the latest evidence of Hollywood's bizarre current obsession with benign rodents (to wit: the hamster in "Bolt," the rat in "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" and the casts of "Ratatouille," "Flushed Away" and "The Tale of Despereaux").
From Linda DeScenna's evocative multiperiod production design to costume designer Rita Ryack's imaginative togs, from the elaborate visual effects overseen by John Andrew Berton Jr. to Michael Barrett's colorful lensing, tech work is at a very high level. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score adds muscle and momentum throughout and complements a well-selected roster of tunes, culminating in Journey's ubiquitous "Don't Stop Believing." Young moviegoers, in particular, won't.


While no one was expecting the live-wire daring of Punch-Drunk Love  or even You Don't Mess With the Zohan , the Adam Sandler  who shows up in Bedtime Stories  is that most unnecessary of movie-star guises: the benign family-comedy guy. Playing his usual underdog role, Sandler is Skeeter, a lowly Los Angeles handyman recruited by his sister (Courteney Cox ) to babysit her two children (Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling ) while she's out of town. In the hopes of bonding with the youngsters, he entertains them with made-up bedtime stories, but once events in the stories start happening in real life, he realizes that the kids' narrative input has some sort of magical effect. Directed by Adam Shankman  (The Pacifier ) in his traditional bright-shiny-silly way, Bedtime Stories  is too typical of what passes for live-action family filmmaking these days, throwing together saccharine sentiments, mindless comedic action, and scenes of unusually affluent family life in the hopes of crafting a gleaming entertainment that's always in motion and won't offend anyone. (But, on that note, is Guy Pearce 's evil hotel manager supposed to be gay or just, y'know, exceptionally prissy?) Because Bedtime Stories  has Sandler in it, a little loopiness still creeps in around the edges—the best bit has to do with a character's odd cell phone ring—but the twitchy anxiety that once powered his persona has given way to a doughy anonymity. Parental advisory: There is a Rob Schneider  cameo.
