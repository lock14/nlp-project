         "The Bucket List" arrives on Christmas Day to remind us to live life to its fullest and leave no cliché unturned. And while most of us would confess to not exactly seizing each day as if it is our last, another cloying reminder from Hollywood is probably not going to make any more of a difference than an afternoon spent on the couch with Dr. Phil and Oprah.
 
 A travelogue of triteness that demands alliteration to describe it, the movie is clearly aimed at fading boomers with its  story of two older men with terminal medical conditions. Its watchability almost entirely depends on your tolerance of Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson doing the things that made them stars and won them Oscars, only much more so.
 


         






   We meet Freeman doing a voice of God narration against the backdrop of the snow-covered Himalayas -- I know, you want to groan, but he really is good at this kind of thing -- that introduces us to the inscrutable concept that when all is said and done, you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.
 
 An auto mechanic, incessant reader, trivia buff and annoyingly vocal player of "Jeopardy," Freeman's Carter Chambers is an outwardly contented man in his 60s, with a 45-year marriage and three children of whom to be proud.
 
 Nicholson is Edward Cole, a healthcare mogul known for the fiscally lean management of his hospitals, which he declares are not health spas and decrees that there will be two beds to a room, no exceptions. He prides himself on drinking the world's most expensive coffee and his inability to stay married.
 
 Carter gets the phone call about his test results at the garage, with director Rob Reiner lingering for an almost comical amount of time on the ashes of his burning cigarette. Edward starts coughing up blood at a board meeting where he is trying to take over another hospital.
 
 Before you can say "Odd Couple" -- Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon almost certainly would have been cast in this 10 or 15 years ago -- these grumpy old men are sharing a room in one of Edward's facilities. No exceptions, remember?
 
 Carter is accepting of his fate, but he's prodded by his wife, Virginia (Beverly Todd), a nurse, to take a more aggressive tack in fighting the illness. Edward is simply irritated, bullying his loyal assistant Matthew (Sean Hayes), whom he insists on calling Thomas, into helping him maintain his luxurious lifestyle while undergoing chemotherapy.
 
 The superficial differences in economics and disposition give way to an uneasy bond as the two men share a limited life expectancy and a fondness for cards and reading. They fall into a kind of platonic man-love -- for this is, essentially, a love story -- a mite too quickly, and as the sentimentality mounts, you miss their initial bickering.
 
 Edward catches Carter making the list of the title -- things to do before you kick the bucket -- and challenges him to make the philosophical exercise a reality. Against Virginia's wishes and abetted by Matthew and Edward's deep pockets, Carter and Edward embark on a globetrotting pursuit of thrills and experiences. They skydive, race cars and visit France, Cairo and Hong Kong via some laughably poor visual effects.
 
 Rob Morrow costars as Edward's doctor, but his appearances are so brief you have to wonder if his part was left on the cutting room floor. In fact, the film is so eager to get its two stars out of the hospital and on their journey, at the expense of narrative logic, that you have to wonder if they simply lopped off a huge chunk from the first half of the film.
 
 Freeman and Nicholson make the most of Justin Zackham's script, but there just isn't enough substance behind their characters to prop up the carpe diem
 platitudes. The result is a semi-comedic, geriatric "Brokeback Mountain" minus the sex and with a Himalayan summit. If that isn't enough, the filmmakers really rub it in with a John Mayer song over the end credits.
 

 
 "The Bucket List." MPAA rating: PG-13 for language, including a sexual reference. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. In selected theaters.   

 “The Bucket List” operates on the hope that two beloved stars rubbing their signature screen personas together can spark warm, fuzzy box office magic. I wouldn’t count on it. Stars or no, it is an open question whether audiences will flock to a preposterous, putatively heartwarming buddy comedy about two men diagnosed with terminal cancer living it up in their final months.  The geezers chafing at death’s doorstep are Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman), cancer patients who meet cute in the room they share in a hospital owned by Edward. A greedy billionaire health care mogul, Edward is a victim of his own ruthless cost-cutting program that decrees two to a room in his cramped establishment.  Obviously, no billionaire in his right mind would endure such humiliation in an institution he is knowingly bleeding to death; he would have his own deluxe private suite somewhere else. Edward, however, does have gourmet food supplied by his obedient assistant Thomas (Sean Hayes), which he lustily consumes until chemotherapy takes away his appetite along with his hair.  Slipping into their stock screen personas of rampaging fool (Mr. Nicholson) and pious wise man (Mr. Freeman), neither actor adds a note that we haven’t seen before. Given less than a year to live, Edward and Carter flee the hospital to board Edward’s private jet for a final blowout underwritten by Edward.  Along the way they become best pals who help each other learn the usual lessons about living life to the fullest. The movie strenuously denies medical reality. As they undertake their journey, both men, in temporary remission, appear as robust as the rejuvenated seniors in “Cocoon.”  Their initial adventures, like sky diving and race car driving,  are high-adrenaline stunts embraced with macho zeal; they even visit a tattoo parlor. As they follow an itinerary that takes them to the south of France, the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Himalayas and Hong Kong, these stopovers, obviously filmed on a soundstage, have all the reality of snapshots photographed in front of travel posters.  On the sexual front, the happily married Carter demurs when opportunity presents itself. But nothing has ever prevented Edward, who has been married and divorced four times, from pursuing continuous novelty. The movie mercifully spares us the spectacle of Mr. Nicholson, whalelike at 70, in full rutting mode.  Directed by Rob Reiner from a sketchy screenplay by Justin Zackham, “The Bucket List” fails its stars in fundamental ways. Mr. Nicholson has played wealthy rogues before (most recently in “Something’s Gotta Give”), but this particular bon vivant is unsalvageably repellent. The actor’s frantic mugging, guffawing and eyebrow twitching only underscore the character’s pompous self-satisfaction. By the time the movie allows Edward a token gesture of humanity (his guilt-stricken attempt to reunite with an estranged daughter he cruelly betrayed), it is too little too late.  Carter is the one who initially brings up the notion of “the bucket list,” a roster of must-have experiences to be pursued before “kicking the bucket.” We are asked to accept that this dignified sage has been happily toiling as an auto mechanic for 46 years after forgoing his higher education to support a family. Anyone this articulate and composed would have risen far above day-laborer status.  Largely self-taught, Carter keeps himself in mental shape by watching “Jeopardy!” and competing out loud with the contestants. During their travels he is a font of geographic and historical trivia.  For all the kindly gravity he puts into the role, Mr. Freeman cannot begin to make you believe that a quiet family man like Carter would abandon his loyal wife (Beverly Todd) during his final months of life to go on a spree with a rascally egomaniac. I don’t imagine Mr. Freeman believes it either.  Saddest of all, the professed spiritual goals on the pair’s checklist of things to do — “laugh till you cry,” “witness something majestic” — are the kind of pallid bromides found in the pages of a quickie self-help book: “I’m Not O.K., and Neither Are You.”    “The Bucket List” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color dialogue.

"The Bucket List" is a feel-good film about death, a sitcom about mortality, "Ikiru" for meatheads. It's also a picture about two cancer patients confronting reality, and deciding how they want to spend their presumed last days, that has not an ounce of reality about it. For all these reasons, along with the star power of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, this refitting of the grumpy old men genre stands a good chance of becoming director Rob Reiner's first hit since the mid-'90s, even though its prevailing sensibility will eventually make it look more at home on small screens.
In Reiner's world, the opening scene showing auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman) smoking a cigarette signals that the genial fellow is headed straight to the grave. But the first stop is a hospital, where he's quickly joined by gazillionaire Edward Cole (Nicholson), who, despite owning the place, is forced to share a room with a fellow patient due to his own rules about equal treatment for all.
Although they embark on cancer treatments that allow a slight chance of survival, both men are given roughly a year to live, and their enforced cohabitation gives them plenty of time to ruminate about dreams, regrets and remaining hopes in between slapstick emergency dashes to the bathroom.
A philosophically inclined "Jeopardy" whiz, Carter wanted to be a history professor, but the demands of a growing family obliged him to face economic realities. Edward, by contrast, has had everything money can buy except a stable family life; married four times, he's estranged from his only child, a daughter.
Early going is highlighted by Nicholson getting his head shaved in preparation for surgery, meaning the well-fed star goes through most of the picture looking like a satiric version of the Michelin Man or a cheerier brother of Brando's Kurtz in "Apocalypse Now."
Finding some scribblings by Carter noting modest things he wants to do before he dies, Edward adds to "the bucket list" with far more grandiose, and uniquely photogenic, proposals such as skydiving and racecar driving, and others that involve travel by private jet, a mode of transport that is the norm for Edward.
So, after a big argument between Carter and his understandably perturbed wife (Beverly Todd), the old boys set off for a world tour that includes the South of France, South Africa, the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, the Himalayas and Hong Kong. Unfortunately, this is a film that leaves the soundstage only with the greatest reluctance; the parade of visual effects-generated scenes in which Nicholson and Freeman visit wonders of the world, while so obviously remaining in Hollywood, proves as realistic as a Hope-Crosby "Road" picture and about as profound, if not as funny. The trip's patent phoniness is quaint enough to provoke momentary nostalgia for the long-gone days of rear-projection process work.
The scenic sojourn, during which any traces of illness are magically banished, provides for saucepan-deep probing into the men's lives. The button-pushing by first-time scripter Justin Zackham remains narrowly focused on unsettled emotional issues concerning Edward's daughter, with whom Carter tries to arrange a reconciliation, and Carter's latent misgivings about the road not taken. Resolution of these matters is assuredly provided in the most obvious manner for immediate audience uplift.
Freeman's hardwired straight-shooter gravitas as an actor would have wonderfully served a genuinely serious meditation on the same subject. As it is, the ever-steady thesp provides a rock against which Nicholson can bounce like a crazy ball. Edward's extravagant view of life fits what the actor has become, and Nicholson actually hams it up less than he might have, but it's still a turn in which you're watching the star, and making associations between him and aspects of the material, rather than the character.
The role of Edward's factotum, who accompanies the guys on their journey, could have been conceived any number of ways to abundant comic effect, but he's been written in such a dull, straight-laced manner that Sean Hayes, of "Will & Grace," can do nothing to bring him to life. A similar comedy-drama from Hollywood's earlier years would have featured at least a half-dozen wonderful supporting parts, the lack of which is duly felt here.
In keeping with the effort expended on the location visuals, tech aspects are routine.

Rob Reiner 's latest film is, among other things, a paean to the glories of tourism and a reflection of our persistent cultural belief that you haven't really lived until you've ticked off a list of Earth's Greatest Hits (cf.1,000 Places to See Before You Die , etc.).
In The Bucket List , Jack Nicholson  plays Edward Cole , a quadruple-divorced billionaire (he calls his later wives "the sequels") who has just been hospitalized with inoperable brain cancer. In a nice twist, he happens to own the hospital. Cole's roommate is Carter Chambers , a retired mechanic with an intellectual streakplayed by Morgan Freeman , natchand a Jeopardy!   obsession. (Writing the big boss into a shared room took a LOT of maneuvering by scripter Justin Zackham .) Carter is still married to his high-school sweetheart and has three grown kids who adore him. Edward . . . well, let's just say that he's a jerk and everybody hates him (cf. Something's Gotta Give, As Good As It Gets ). Obviously, this odd couple hits it off: Condemned to die within the year, they dash off a list of things to do before that happens"See something truly majestic"and set out on a trip around the world, bankrolled by Edward and organized by his nebbishy personal assistant (Sean Hayes , making the best of a stock role).
There's a Knocked Up ish sexist streak here. The Bucket List  is driven by the idea that these guys need to be guys together, to flee into a fantasy world of fast cars and hot chicks. Ordinary women, it seems, just want to stop men from having fun and telling fart jokes. Carter's wife, Virginia (Beverly Todd ), is a killjoy who can't understand why her husband wants to leave his family and spend the last months of his life with a rich-asshole madman. Kerouac and Cassady, this duo takes to the road (or the skies, as it may be) partly to see the sights but mostly to escape workaday female emotions and expectations into a masculine sphere of their own creation.
At the heart of the movie is, of course, the Jack and Morgan Show. Nicholson seems to be gunning hard for another Oscar nomination with a frenetic, tic-y performance, full of grunts and heavy breathing, that just screams CANCER PATIENT. And Freeman's Poor But Wise Man, who narrates in plummy tones, is as mournful and wry and knowing as ever.
Both are skilled at squeezing emotion from a cheeseball script (as is Reiner, who, knowing the score, doesn't try to rein them in), and the last half hour of the film is genuinely moving despite itself. Turns out The Bucket List  is a meta-film, mostly about how these two legendary actors interact and what it means to be an actor in your own life. Even the scenery bears this outthe pyramids and cathedrals in the background look almost painfully fake, reminiscent of the big-budget studio epics of yore, movies bursting with personalities that dwarfed everything and everyone else.
