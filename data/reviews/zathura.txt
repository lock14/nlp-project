With his follow-up to Elf
, actor-turned-director Jon Favreau sticks with family-friendly filmmaking, this time taking on the film version of Chris van Allsburg�s bestselling children�s book Zathura
. Van Allsburg�s slim but well-illustrated books have been recast as large-scale, kids adventure films (Jumanji
, The Polar Express)
, perhaps so appealing in Hollywood because they come with ready-made storyboards (even though Zathura
 needed screenwriters David Koepp and John Kamps to expand its slender story). Zathura
 succeeds in a way that neither of the previous van Allsburg film adaptations managed: It�s infused with a greater sense of fun and realism. Favreau keeps the picture throttling forward with a carefree charm that offers opportunities for emotional involvement and detachment. It�s a space adventure that goes forth with a Buck Rogers attitude as silly gizmos, robots, and monsters turn from mildly goofy to dangerous and threatening in the blink of an eye � or the delivery of an instruction card from the dusty old Zathura
 game that young Danny (Bobo) finds in the basement. Bickering brothers Danny and Walter (Hutcherson) are left at home while their dad (Robbins) runs to the office to retrieve some materials the boys have accidentally ruined while fighting. The simplicity and look of this strange board game, which is made out of pressed tin, adds to the retro feel of the movie. The game spits out instruction cards with cryptic messages that generally presage some dire occurrence. One such event turns their teenage sister/babysitter (Stewart) into a block of ice for five turns (which conveniently allows the filmmakers to cart around a life-sized girl in pink sleeping shorts for much of the movie, a bonus for the adolescent boys who may think themselves too old to want to see this movie). Eventually, an odd astronaut (Shepard) comes along who allows the story to tie up its sentimental theme about eternal brotherhood. Comic actor Shepard seems a bit of a stretch in the role, but it�s nice to see Zathura
 try something different than the big star turns of Robin Williams and Tom Hanks in the previous van Allsburg outings. Robbins is solid as this film�s divorced dad trying to balance the differing needs of his squabbling 10-year-old and 6-year-old with his work responsibilities. His impeccable Mission-style home is utterly trashed by the space adventure, which uproots the house and its foundation and hurtles it through space Oz-style. The tone of the fantasy and the effects are just right: enough to surprise and startle everyone and even spook the littlest ones, but so gleefully defiant of the laws of physics and aeronautics that it�s clear the film�s only objective is to have a good time. Favreau continues to show a real flair for concocting worlds that persuasively blend the real and the fantastic, a talent that should serve him well on his next project, the film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs� John Carter of Mars
.


Rarely is a movie audience asked to put up with so much noise for such a thankless payoff as it must with ''Zathura," a loud, endless family picture directed by the actor Jon Favreau. The kids around me whooped and hollered along with the movie, so it might be profitable. And for pre-adolescents, the action probably has a kick.
Two squabbling brothers discover an antique mechanical board game called Zathura. It spits out cards that come destructively true when read aloud. One card sends their big house into outer space, where in order to get back to earth they have to keep playing.
There's a killer robot, killer meteors, killer slimy lizard aliens, and, to provide adult supervision, an ineffectual astronaut. The movie also tosses in some mild foul language and one dumb sexual situation involving the boys' randy teen sister, an unwitting passenger in the house.
Twenty years ago, ''Goonies," which was also full of booby traps and rambunctious antics, delighted kids of similar ages to those meant for ''Zathura." (I was one of them.) ''Goonies" had jokey characters with personalities and a suspenseful plot. ''Zathura" could end on at least three separate occasions but drags on.
If the movie sounds like that Robin Williams fantasy vehicle ''Jumanji" from 10 years ago, that's because both have been taken from children's stories by Chris Van Allsburg, who also wrote ''The Polar Express." ''Zathura" is the least of the three movies because it abandons us with two of the most intolerable children to make it onto a movie screen.
They are a blooming jock named Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and Danny, the meek kid brother he teases (Jonah Bobo). The movie has them perform one inane task after the next. This may be to keep the story in motion and special effects coming, but the whole experience is like being trapped in a great big Happy Meal. (The sister is also a pain, but she spends half the movie cryogenically frozen.)
Favreau, who's not in the film, is a smart and engaging actor. But he's not as generous when he's directing. Both young actors demonstrate a talent for violently screaming at each other for minutes on end, and nothing else. Or else they're delivering lines right out of schoolyard recess. When Walter discovers the robot, he commands it: ''Get me a juice box, bee-yatch!"
Neither boy exhibits the pluck or cleverness that sometimes can sweep you up in a middling adventure. Instead, they continue the whining and bickering that probably began after their parents divorced. Tim Robbins plays the loving workaholic dad; we don't see mom's face as she never even bothers to climb out of an SUV. Walter may blame Danny for the split, but clearly, the movie thinks the divorce is her fault, that bee-yatch.
Divorce is not what's put the brothers at each other's throats for most of ''Zathura." Being spoiled has. The movies never have a cure for that.

         You know how when you open an old board game and there's that one piece missing and it keeps you from playing, or you can still play but it's just not as much fun as it should be?
 
  "Zathura: A Space Adventure" is kind of like that.
 


         






    Based on Chris Van Allsburg's book, the movie has a lot of the elements that might make it thrilling and it's visually arresting, but it's missing the emotional connection necessary to make it interesting. As a de facto sequel to "Jumanji," it follows some of the same formula — a long-forgotten board game becomes a portal to a fantasy realm that leads to a Dr. Phil moment. In "Zathura," a fractured family is taken on a wild interstellar ride in search of the key to brotherly love.
 
  Their parents divorced, 10-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) split their time between households. When staying with Dad (Tim Robbins) in his rambling California Craftsman-style home, they're frequently a little bored when they aren't competing for his attention or generally driving each other crazy. They also find the house, especially its dark basement, a little creepy.
 
  One afternoon when Dad needs to run out to a business meeting, they're left in the care of their teenage sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart), who's asleep in her upstairs bedroom. Danny winds up in the basement, where he discovers a dusty, metal board game called Zathura.
 
  Walter ignores his pleas to play with him, so Danny begins playing the cleverly engineered game by himself and finds himself holding a card that reads, "Meteor shower. Take evasive action."
 
  Soon the house is being pelted by increasingly larger bits of molten rock and the boys discover they've been launched into deep space.
 
  The only way to get back to Earth is to keep playing the game. Each turn brings a new danger: a large, dysfunctional robot, carnivorous lizard-like beings called Zorgons and the rapid destruction of their home. Oh, yeah, and the scantily clad Lisa gets zapped into a cryogenic freeze.
 
  Along the way, Walter and Danny also rescue an intrepid astronaut (Dax Stewart) who's played the game before and helps them navigate the more terrifying turns. The film's main dramatic question is whether the brothers can play together nicely long enough to finish the game and return home before they become meat for the Zorgons.
 
  Jon Favreau's third outing as a director proves he can handle the larger budget and special effects, but the film strangely lacks the poignancy that underscored his previous studio effort, "Elf." The early scenes in "Zathura" depicting the family's lack of domestic tranquillity don't ring true, and that severely diminishes the emotional payoff later on.
 
  There's also a lack of causality in the way "Zathura" unfolds dramatically. The events feel random rather than linked, and although there always seems to be something happening, there's no real buildup of tension.
 
  It may be that Van Allsburg's economical 32-page books (he also did "Jumanji" and "The Polar Express"), which so effectively stimulate children's creative minds, are best left to the imagination.

No disrespect to director Jon Favreau, but I hope he'll make nothing but family films for a while. He's good at it and we need more of them  more than we need, say, another Elf , which felt like an honest kids' movie trying to wriggle out of a grown hipster's tight-fitting irony. Zathura  is far more at ease with itself as it hurtles purposefully through the starlit void of encroaching adulthood.
Like its sister picture, 1995's Jumanji , Zathura  is based on a Chris Van Allsburg picture book about two siblings drawn bodily into the perilous world of a vintage board game. Unlike Jumanji  (or last year's The Polar Express , another Van Allsburg adaptation), Zathura  isn't concerned with breaking any new ground in the field of visual effects; it trusts Van Allsburg's storytelling instead of trying to amp up the whispering vividness of his artistry. The tale is simple enough: Squabbling brothers Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) must learn teamwork in order to navigate their house back from the far reaches of the galaxy. Favreau manages to elevate this potentially trite setup into Cain and Abel territory without ever overstepping the genre's bounds or gunning the thrusters into Cartoon Network hyperdrive. From a Hollywood that often settles for less in the family department, Zathura  is a rarity: a stellar fantasy that faces down childhood anxieties with feet-on-the-ground maturity.


Its unwieldy title notwithstanding, "Zathura: A Space Adventure" is arguably the best adaptation of a Chris Van Allsburg book to date. A visually resplendent adventure about two brothers and an enchanted board game that beams them into outer space, Sony's unofficial follow-up to its 1995 hit "Jumanji" benefits from helmer Jon Favreau's amiably low-key sense of humor and assured handling of well-trod emotional territory. Absent the star power of a Robin Williams or a "Jumanji"-sized marketing push, pricey pic looks to draw midrange rather than astronomical numbers, with better prospects in ancillary.
As evidenced in both "Jumanji" and Warner Bros.' "The Polar Express," the main obstacle to wresting Van Allsburg's gorgeously imagined picture books onto the screen -- aside from the author's ineffable tone of deadpan surrealism -- has been their lack of a feature-length narrative. Yet aside from the occasional lapse in pacing, screenwriters David Koepp and John Kamps sustain attention for a full 101 minutes without departing significantly from the slender 32-page framework of Van Allsburg's story.
Ten-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) compete for the attention of their stressed-out father (Tim Robbins, in a brief but effective turn). After Dad takes off, putting their negligent older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) in charge, Danny finds himself stuck in the basement, where he digs up a '50s-style space-themed board game called Zathura.
Danny begins to play the game, an ingenious wind-up contraption that comes with self-moving pieces and a metal turnkey in lieu of rolling dice. It soon becomes clear, however -- after an impromptu meteor shower in the living room -- that self-operation is the least of the game's properties.
In a surreally entrancing shot that consciously echoes both "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "The Wizard of Oz," Danny opens the front door to find their house hovering not too far from what appear to be the rings of Saturn. The brothers soon realize they must finish the game to get home safely, and subsequent turns of the key trigger an attack by a giant robot (voiced by Frank Oz); a cryonic freeze that leaves Lisa hilariously immobilized; and an invasion by a fleet of carnivorous, lizardlike aliens called Zorgons.
Along the way, they pick up a free-floating astronaut (Dax Shepard) who helps keep the Zorgons at bay and, in a clever but foreseeable twist, fits neatly into the escalating emotional drama between the two siblings. For their part, Hutcherson and Bobo excel at delivering script's peppy banter while coming across as real live kids, their angry exchanges veering only occasionally into melodramatic excess.
"Zathura" cleaves in broad strokes to the "Jumanji" formula (two tykes play a game that teaches them life lessons while systematically destroying their house), but in every way reps a smarter, less mean-spirited and more purposeful picture than its decade-old predecessor. Still, the action -- replete with explosions, fireballs, gravity fields, black holes and other situations the average 10-year-old likely would not survive -- is anything but a faithful approximation of Van Allsburg's minimalist style and may prove a mite too intense for extremely young auds.
Pic's otherworldly setting and sentimental themes of family reconciliation place it squarely in the mold of early Steven Spielberg, as does John Debney's score, with backup vocals by a choir of angels who work a bit too hard to cultivate a sense of childlike wonder.
Favreau's first post-"Elf" directing project finds him very much at ease with the challenges of a larger-scale, more action-oriented family film. Relying heavily but not too heavily on CG effects, helmer displays a wizardly command of the house interiors, keeping the action tightly focused, sometimes to the point of claustrophobia, with only brief cutaways to the staggering sights just outside the window.

Let's play Jumanji! No, let's not, but say we did-in space! Caldecott Medalwinning author Chris Van Allsburg  has two primary audiences: kids who adore his surrealistic illustrated fantasies (Jumanji , The Polar Express , and this titular tale), and Hollywood  execs who inhale them as ready-made, storyboarded feature pith. A Two-Manji of sorts, the film finds siblings Danny and Walter (Jonah Bobo  and Josh Hutcherson ) at home and at each other's throats, until the younger Danny discovers the board game that sends their Arts & Craftsstyle house hurtling through the galaxy. Innocents will see brother-love wrung and beaten till it's gooey; math majors might notice a variant of the prisoner's dilemma, with both boys compelled to see the game through to conclusion, their cooperation required for an ideal solution. One thing: Perhaps my studio-cynic hackles are raised imprudently, but either Favreau reimagined the boys' teenage sister to read as matinee sex bomb, Tootsie Rolling  around in pink boxers for half the film, or children's books have become a lot hotter since I put down Seuss and Sendak for Encyclopedia Brown .
Umm, "Gimme a juice box, biotch"? Does Snoop have a children's book out?
