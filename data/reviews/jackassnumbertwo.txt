If you had thoughts of celebrating the arrival of autumn by attaching a leech to your eyeball or detonating a landmine near your person � just to see what would happen � the guys from Jackass
 want to save you the trouble. In their new film, a sequel to 2002 sleeper Jackass: The Movie
, Knoxville, Margera, Steve-O, and their band of thrill-seeking merry men continue their quest to create entertainment out of self-immolation and to conquer lingering human fear by laughing, and occasionally vomiting, in its face. The troupe enters the film on a perfectly pitched note of comedy and daredevilry: running in slow motion out of a dense fog � to the heroic strains of Ennio Morricone, no less � trailing a herd of angry bulls as they go. And this is one of the film's saner moments. You may know someone who ran with the bulls in Pamplona, but I imagine you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who's contemplated putting a fishhook through his cheek and diving into the ocean to pass himself off as shark bait. Jackass: Number Two
 is essentially a collection of absurdist, socially transgressive living-art pieces, and, taken together, they strike right at the heart of what moviegoing should be about: shared experience � of fear, humor, dread, disgust, pity, wonder � and the often unbearable thrill and agony of collective anticipation. I've never been in a theatre where the audience's reaction to what they were seeing onscreen was so unanimous and so unfiltered. Sure, the movie is long, at an hour and a half, but that's just quibbling. Strange as it might be to say, Jackass: Number Two
 is just the kind of vicarious excitement for which the movies were invented.


Any episode of "Jackass" or its two movies, the second of which opens today, kicks off with a disclaimer. Don't try this at home, it pleads. That's always sobering advice, though I'm fairly certain that an evening of sticking my hand in a bear trap is not in the cards. Neither is an afternoon spent impaling my cheek with a fishhook, then leaping into the Gulf of Mexico tethered to a fishing pole to pose as shark bait. Nor should they be for you.
Watching a bunch of dudes in a movie do it is an entirely different story. "Jackass Number Two" is another scrapbook of bad ideas made excruciatingly and uproariously real. Those who seek to imitate such activities are, like the movie's merry gang of lunatics, crazy.
Filmed in appropriately crude digital video, ``Jackass Number Two" arrives only weeks after Steve Irwin's ugly demise at the point of a stingray, and the sight of these guys doing a stunt called Anaconda Ball Pit (two snakes, a tank of plastic fun balls, and three Jackassers) leaves you fearful for their lives. No one in the "Jackass" franchise appears to proceed with caution, which, of course, is the fascinating point of these adventures.
Officially, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and the rest of the "Jackass" crew are not scientists. But their comedy qualifies as research, and their research, consequently, deserves to be considered comedy. The subject is the human body, and their experiments challenge man's capacity for pain. In a sense, this makes them corporeal frontiersmen. In fact, the only person in the history of movies as devoted to subverting bodily norms is David Cronenberg. And not even he's come up with a character who can receive a beer enema with such glee. (Let's hear it for Steve-O.)
In ``Number Two," we see the body reach its visceral limit (expressed usually by vomiting), and we see that limit's psychological manifestation: fear. Margera, the most amiable member of the gang, runs for his life from a cobra and more than once is filmed near tears. (After Medicine Ball Dodgeball, he declares, ``That was fun. Let's never do that again.") Apparently, Knoxville, who is mauled by bulls on several occasions, fears nothing. As the leader of this outfit, he's like a gutter-rat George Clooney, and his crew is a skate-park Ocean's 12.
The double feat of ``Jackass" is that it weds the obviously juvenile with the arrestingly profound. The boys of Delta Kappa Epsilon and their TAs can watch this movie in the same theater. Many smarty-pants have noted that ``Jackass" distills physical comedy to its essence, while scrapping narrative altogether. The stunts (in ``Number Two," Margera aptly refers to them as bits) are the joke, and the body becomes the punch line. This is extreme comedy, and it's amazing how director Jeff Tremaine, who along with Spike Jonze has been affiliated with this troupe from its outset, creates an environment where self-inflicted torture is uncontrollably funny without being morally offensive.
Still, given the devouring of animal secretions and the abundance of buttocks and penises on display, it's a miracle that the MPAA let ``Number Two" off with a mere R. ``Jackass" has always comfortably straddled the line between the gay and the brotherly. This is a world largely absent women, and its orbit gleefully revolves around the phallus. 
And this second movie actually suggests a kind of coming out. John Waters, who is this crew's transgressive uncle, shows up for one gag, and the final shot belongs to Rip Taylor, who walks on after the film's big Broadway/Hollywood-style musical number. That is correct. There's a musical number, and any frat dude in the audience will tell you: It's fabulous
!


The first Jackass , released in 2002, is maybe the most laugh-out-loud, sidesplitting movie of the last couple of years. There, I said it. I'm sorry, but trampolining into a ceiling fan is simply brilliant. It's performance art. But, unlike most films I love, I've never been compelled to watch Jackass  twice. A dude snorting wasabi will not  pay dividends over and over again  and therein lies one of its limitations as art. The shock is all.
Jackass Number Two  is not as original, aberrantly beautiful, unrepetitious, or good as Jackass  Number One, yet it will still double a lot of people over with big laughs and grossed-out disbelief. The sequel again finds Johnny Knoxville and his cackling buddies torturing each other in tastelessly innovative ways, and even if you can't stomach (or stand) what they're up to, you still have to admit that these goons execute their gags exceptionally well. Knoxville alone face-plants into asphalt, gets bitten by an anaconda (twice), gets gored (more than once) by a bull, drinks horse semen, punches a bear trap, and just hangs on for dear life as a big red rocket launches him high up over a lake. How  especially after two movies  is he or someone from his crew not dead eight times over? Something about these movies blows my mind, and maybe it's that, as crude as they are, they make me believe in the existence of a watchful God.

 When the supermasochist Bob Flanagan nailed his penis to a piece of wood in front of a live audience, it was called performance art. When Chris Pontius sheathes his penis in a cotton puppet, dangles it in front of a live snake, and then braces himself for the fangs while his buddies double over in glee, it’s known as “Jackass.”  “Puppet Show” is the opening bit in “Jackass Number Two,” the second feature-length collection of stunts, pranks and self-inflicted trauma from Johnny Knoxville and his merry band of skate-punk yahoos. Much of what follows is too obscene to be described here; suffice to say that disreputable things are done with the ejaculate of a horse. It is also too exhilarating to spoil. Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies.  You may prefer a Buster Keaton gag to the spectacle of a man leaping from a trampoline into a ceiling fan, but you can’t argue with its purity of expression. At the root of the “Jackass” project is an impulse to deny the superego and approach the universe, with all its hard edges and shark-infested waters, as an enormous, undifferentiated playpen. That, and the impulse to watch a 400-pound woman belly-flop on top of a midget. The Surrealists would have loved these guys, and relished the film’s signature image: the application of a leech to the surface of an eyeball.  “Jackass Number Two” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Things you can’t even imagine.

The first feature spun from MTV's notorious "Jackass" was described in these pages as "quite possibly the most exuberantly distasteful hodgepodge of beery anarchy and death-wishing irresponsibility ever unleashed by a major Hollywood distrib." But when it comes to plumbing new depths of ingeniously egregious gross-out humor, "jackass the movie" was an under-achiever compared to its inevitable sequel, the ever-so-aptly titled "jackass number two." This stunningly shameless follow-up to the 2002 theatrical sleeper (and homdevid mega-seller) offers more of the same -- a lot more -- while repeatedly upping the ante in terms of offensiveness. Which, of course, should greatly -- and profitably -- please is target aud.
Much like its predecessor, "jackass number two" has been cobbled together with brazen haphazardness. Again, the filmmakers haven't even bothered to provide capital letters or a colon for its title.
Nothing more than a series of skits, some of which barely qualify as blackouts, pic showcases hearty-partying Johnny Knoxville and his equally uninhibited cohorts (Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Dave England, Ryan Dunn, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey) as they do terrible things to each other, and themselves, while exhibiting varying degrees of sadism, masochism, exhibitionism and (apparently) inebriation.
In a typical bit, the wild boys place one of their fellows atop a familiar carnival attraction -- a mallet-driven strength tester -- and use the contraption to drive a huge dildo up the guy's anus. (Homoeroticism isn't so much a subtext as a running gag through the entire pic.) Later, the happy-go-lucky Steve-O places a large fishing hook through his cheek, then allows himself to be used as human bait in shark-infested waters.
Projectile vomiting figures prominently during other episodes, and the camera never turns away, not even when one Jackass washes down some horse manure with a gulp of beer. Indeed, it remains firmly affixed on the effluence, as auds are left to ponder various meanings of the term "gag."
And speaking of horses, more barfing ensues after a lusty stallion is rudely interrupted during a mating attempt.
Repeatedly, the "Jackass" boys risk permanent injury -- or, at the very least, total humiliation -- as they collide with metal doors, ski down staircases, attach leeches to their eyeballs, barely avoid being gored by angry bulls, and allow themselves to be pelted with a explosion-propelled fusillade of hard rubber balls. (At one point, a member of the gang semi-seriously wails: "Please, God, don't let there be a 'Jackass 3.'")
And when they run out of things to do to themselves, they bring in guest stars like filmmakers John Waters and Spike Jonze to ratchet up the brutal tomfoolery.
If you're in a suitably debauched frame of mind -- and, perhaps more important, if you refrain from dining for several hours beforehand -- "jackass number two" could very well make you laugh until you're thoroughly ashamed of yourself. Or not. Much like some of the delicacies savored on screen, pic is very much an acquired taste.
To call the humor sophomoric would be to overstate its sophistication. Call it infantile, and you'll be much closer to the mark. But it's hard to deny that many of the more outrageous bits have an exhilaratingly potent, shock-you-into-guffawing impact. And while a few stretches do feel wearyingly repetitious, you never have to wait too long before another eruption of "I can't believe they did that
!'" lunacy.
Put it another way: If you enjoyed "jackass the movie" -- and you know who you are -- "jackass number two" will qualify as another guilty pleasure you won't want to discuss in polite company.
It's worth noting, by the way, that while much of the first "jackass" pic was shot in messy, muddy digital video, the sequel boasts production values that border on adequacy.
