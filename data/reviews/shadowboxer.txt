 “Shadowboxer,” a gaudy thriller saturated in sex and violence, is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open — partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. Playing one of the most unlikely couples in screen history, Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. are Rose and Mikey, contract killers and lovers living in Philadelphia who happen to be stepmother and stepson. And oh yes, Rose is dying of cancer and eventually exits the world with the kind of bang not seen since Jeanne Moreau’s self-annihilation in “Going Places.”  The directorial debut of Lee Daniels, the producer of “Monster’s Ball,” “Shadowboxer” recycles the same themes that drove its more somber forerunner, this time in a “Pulp Fiction” style, with lush, saturated color and surreal trimmings. As it gleefully smashes boundaries and blurs the line between comedy and melodrama, it dares you to collapse into laughter.  The relationships, especially that of Rose and Mikey, are strictly theoretical constructions. Even Ms. Mirren, one of the world’s great actors, can’t make this couple believable, although she gives herself entirely to her character, a disenchanted political radical turned greedy hit woman. Mr. Gooding trudges through his role with a poker face, exuding an air of embattled nobility that belies his deadly occupation. As a character, Mikey barely exists.  Like “Monster’s Ball,” “Shadowboxer” explores the heavy psychological baggage handed from fathers to sons, in this case a legacy of murder perpetuated by men who grew up admiring their fathers’ skill and confidence with firearms and eventually played copycat. Rose was married to Mikey’s father, who was also a killer for hire. Explaining her past, she tells of having once belonged to a Weathermen-like radical group that accidentally blew itself up.  Rose and Mikey’s relationship strongly recalls the interracial affair in “Monster’s Ball,” in which Billy Bob Thornton’s character, a death-row prison guard from a white racist family, coupled with a condemned killer’s African-American wife (Halle Berry), who didn’t know what her lover did for a living. Although the interracial relationship in “Shadowboxer,” with its May-November twist, is even more far-fetched, it’s not as fraught with potential conflict.  The intensity of Rose and Mikey’s passion goes way beyond conventional Hollywood sex, and the fact that it is interracial and intergenerational (Ms. Mirren is 22 years older than Mr. Gooding) lends it an extra transgressive kick. I haven’t seen a black man and a white woman make love like this in an American movie since Ellen Barkin and Laurence Fishburne tore at each other in “Bad Company” in 1995. Although I suspect that this explicitness will damage the film’s already marginal commercial prospects, I applaud the film (and the actors) for putting it in our faces at a time when Hollywood has turned squeamish. (In fact, “Shadowboxer” is independently produced and released and unencumbered by studio strictures.)  “Shadowboxer” settles right down to business in delivering its jolts. Clayton (Stephen Dorff), a sadistic mob kingpin who lives in a mansion with his pregnant wife, Vickie (Vanessa Ferlito), and a pet zebra that prances on the front lawn, commissions Rose and Mikey to assassinate several of his mob associates and his wife in one fell swoop. Just as Rose is about to dispose of Vickie in her bedroom, Vickie’s water breaks, and she begins to give birth. Rose, perhaps because she’s terminally ill, takes pity, plays midwife and, to Mikey’s displeasure, insists they spirit the mother and baby to safety.  A poorly integrated subplot involves Dr. Don (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the mob physician they summon to check out Vickie after she gives birth, and his drug-addicted girlfriend, Precious (Mo’Nique). The doctor, like all the men in the movie, is a selfish sexual conquistador. But the worst of the lot is Clayton, a sociopath who, when interrupted during rough sex by voices in the next room, rolls off the woman under him, opens the door and shoots his bodyguard in the foot. (This is when Mr. Dorff, in a rare instance of a Hollywood actor baring it all, flashes a glimpse of full-frontal nudity.)  The story leaps ahead as Mikey, Rose, Vickie, and her son live like an anonymous suburban family hidden in the witness protection program. Although they hope Clayton never catches up with them, they don’t seem particularly strict about maintaining their false identities. Of course Clayton shows up and the story ends with a final nasty twist on the family legacy.  “Shadowboxer” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, extreme violence and profanity, and sex that stops just short of pornography. 

Producer and first-time director Lee Daniels' strange and exotic "Shadowboxer" admirably jostles and upends the fatigued killer-for-hire genre. For starters, assassin partners Cuba Gooding Jr. and Helen Mirren are also lovers, while hardly any story element in William Lipz's baroque screenplay is presented in standard chronological order. One person's transgressive cinema, though, may be another's pretentious claptrap, and pic faces a possible B.O. mission impossible in a national midsummer release mix of arthouse and urban markets. Vid and cable should nonetheless hit bull's-eyes.
Despite a salad bowl full of themes and storylines, "Shadowboxer" is centrally concerned with how a parent's lifestyle can be passed down to a child. In this and its serpentine manner of presenting past and present (not only flashbacks galore, but flashbacks within flashbacks), pic actually recalls the wild, paranoid fiction of Richard ("The Manchurian Candidate") Condon. While some nonplussed auds will doubtless laugh back at the screen, the film's sheer daring can't be denied.
Pro assassins Mikey (Gooding Jr.) and Rose (Mirren) live together and more than care for each other: She's slowly dying of cancer and talking of God, but seems rejuvenated when he makes love to her.
Opening flashback establishes that Mikey's father was a hit man outside the home and a wife-abuser inside, and who discovered his son's fascination with guns. Currently, grown-up Mikey picks up assignments from a mild-mannered man in a wheelchair (Tom Pasch) at a spot that looks like ancient Rome but is in the U.S.
First seen torturing a gossiping ex-associate with a broken cue stick, Clayton (Stephen Dorff) is a bad-ass crime lord who rules by terror and owns a mansion complete with an apparently free-grazing zebra.
Clayton, who suspects his wife Vickie (Vanessa Ferlito) of infidelity, hires Mikey and Rose to kill all those who witnessed his violence with the cue-stick. The couple, dressed in sleek black and with a dancerly silence that would make Irma Vep envious, efficiently off one after another in the mansion, until it comes time for the pregnant Vickie.
After aiming a silencer at her a minute before, Rose delivers Vickie's baby. As shown here, "Shadowboxer" throws starkly different emotional right and left hooks that make it nearly impossible to forecast where it's headed, and what new surprises it'll unpack.
Rose and Mikey take Vickie to Dr. Don (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose patients often are criminals, and his buxom nurse/lover Precious (Mo'Nique).
The waltz-like rhythm of Mario Grigorov's score (plus such interesting additional music as an Astor Piazzolla tango) are heard as Daniels weaves past and present together.
The rather literary and perhaps overly mannered quality of the storyline with Mikey and Rose, however, runs a deliberate collision course with the other --Clayton's determination to track down Vickie. There are times when "Shadowboxer," even at 90 minutes, may feel like it has too much in it for one movie, but the sheer excess is also magnificently rendered by Daniels, whose frames spill over with visual information.
Thesps put it all on the line, with Mirren coming off nobly in yet another gutsy perf. Gooding Jr. is on his best behavior, never mugging and managing to convince that he's both a killer and very much in love with Mirren.
Pic is packed with sparkling supporting turns, from Ferlito (in a role that's almost a co-lead in size), to Dorff, Gordon-Levitt, Mo'Nique and a funny, woozy Macy Gray.
With its richly textured colors, M. David Mullen's camera is less inspired by film noir than by Gustav Klimt, and production and other design elements (with Vivienne Westwood credited with costumes for Mirren, Gooding Jr. and Ferlito) are similarly gorgeous and opulent. Pic received prior fest exposure in an unreviewable telecine print.

To its credit, I suppose, Shadowboxer  is never exactly boringin the sense that a jabbering madman's most florid delusions are never exactly boring. Lee Daniels 's directorial debut is a garish, flaming wreck of a movie. All foolish vanity projects should be so riveting, so undaunted in the face of crushing absurdity. As befits a film by a successful indie producer ( Monster's Ball , The Woodsman ) turned would-be auteur, Shadowboxer  appears to have been willed into existence through a potent intermingling of ego and checkbook. To watch it is to ponder hownot to mention whyone even begins to get seasoned, ostensibly self-aware professional actors to perform certain acts onscreen. This is a movie in which at least two people are fucked to deathone with a pool cue, the other by Cuba Gooding Jr.
It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when it becomes clear that this lurid, steroidal neo-noir is certifiably insane (or at least a lot funnier than it means to be), but it's pretty early on. There's the strange moment of bathtub tendresse between Rose and Mikey (Helen Mirren  and Gooding), an assassin duo who happen to be lovers as well as stepmother and stepson. (She's also dying of cancerhence the coughing fits and deep, self-pitying swigs of Wild Turkey .) And there's that soon-to-be-legendary sodomy scene, in which the villainous gangster Clayton  (Stephen Dorff , more than ever a poor man's Mark Wahlberg ) has his victim splayed, strapped to a pool table, pinned down by some heavies, and gagged with an eight ball. (Nice touch: After Clayton snaps the pool cue, one half goes flying offscreen in hilarious slo-mo.)
Premised largely on oedipal conflicts and interracial harmony (or more precisely, interracial shtupping), the plot kicks in when Clayton hires Rose and Mikey to dispose of his philandering pregnant wife, Vickie (Vanessa Ferlito ). They break into his estate, a cartoon baddie's palace (as signified by the zebra that roams the lawns), but just as Rose is about to pull the trigger, Vickie's water breaks and the hitwoman, her mind very much on her own mortality, spies the possibility of redemption. Not only do the killers spare Vickie, they deliver her baby boy ("It's a gift from God," Rose declares) and take it upon themselves to form a curious alternative family, helped by the occasional ministrations of another oddball couple, a skinny white doctor and a rotund black nurse played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt  and Mo'nique.
Beneath the heavy-breathing hysteria, there's something bold and even noble about Shadowboxer . The eccentric casting alone plainly means to short-circuit various preconceptions about race, sex, age, and body type. But this monumentally ridiculous film doesn't stop at subverting stereotypes; it discombobulates narrative logic and the basic laws of human behavior. Still, there's a certain pleasure to be derived from watching the actors attempt to dig out from under the rubble that William Lipz 's screenplay repeatedly dumps on their heads. Mirren and Gordon-Levitt keep a straight face. Gooding seems vaguely embarrassed, especially when baring his ass. Dorff is only too happy to whip out his scene-stealing schlong. Mo'nique hints that she's in on the joke. Ferlito clearly has no clue. And then there's the Macy Gray  approach. As Vickie's friend Niesha, a sloppy, slurring banshee who exits the movie much too soon, Gray delivers a kamikaze performance that will be studied by drag queens for years to come.
