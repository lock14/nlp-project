Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) gave photojournalism the richness and depth of art -- and art the immediacy and directness of photojournalism. In coining the phrase ''the decisive instant" -- that moment when light, motion, and pattern combine before the lens -- he gave photographers a standard to strive for, one only a few reach, and none with the Olympian consistency he did.
Heinz B�tler's 2003 documentary, ''Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye," pays high-toned tribute to its subject. How high-toned? Bach and Ravel play on the soundtrack as a honeyed light streams through the windows of Cartier-Bresson's Paris apartment. We watch him look at his own photographs and remark upon them. We watch several talking heads -- Arthur Miller, the photographer Elliott Erwitt, the actress Isabelle Huppert, among others -- also look at Cartier-Bresson's photographs and speak in awed banalities of his artistry.
Miller and Erwitt speak in English (their gruff, muscular accents add a welcome earthiness to the proceedings). The French speakers are translated in voice-over rather than subtitles, which is distracting. Worse, the translations can be imprecise.
B�tler treats Cartier-Bresson like a kid-gloves classic -- the fact that the documentary is a coproduction of the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation may have something to do with this -- yet his photographs are utterly alien to any idea of the classic. The classic is eternal, generic, embalmed. What Cartier-Bresson did was to give form to the force and astonishment of a given instant, recording a now of absolute particularity.
A similar distrust of specificity extends to the facts of Cartier-Bresson's life. We hear him mention his pivotal visit to Mexico in the 1930s, being a POW during World War II, photographing Gandhi shortly before his assassination. But no context is provided. It's assumed we either already know the necessary biographical details or don't care. Huppert's effusions seem to matter more than Cartier-Bresson's helping to found Magnum, the premier photo agency in the history of the medium.
Even so, any documentary that shows so many Cartier-Bresson images has worth (though why they couldn't be shown in tighter close-up is a source of considerable frustration). Then there is the man himself. If angels aged, surely Cartier-Bresson's is the face they would have. That that face should dominate the screen is a nice irony. One element of the Cartier-Bresson legend was his decades-long refusal to be photographed, so as to preserve his anonymity on assignment.
When the documentary exits talking-heads mode, it reveals how extraordinary it might have been. At one point, Cartier-Bresson visits a warehouse where his watercolors and drawings are kept, arts he pursued as a young man, then in his final years. We see him in long shot, walking with a cane down a corridor, and there is a sense of both his frailty and indomitability that no words could ever convey.
Best of all are two artistic encounters. Cartier-Bresson has a brief conversation with the celebrated Czech photographer Josef Koudelka; and the complicit, kindly look on his face as the younger man speaks is at once moving and thrilling. Koudelka having visited him, Cartier-Bresson pays a visit of his own, to the Louvre. He gazes rapt at Vermeer's ''Lacemaker," his face inches from the canvas. What he says in the documentary of using the camera applies at this moment to both him and us: ''You see, you feel, and the surprised eye responds."

He rarely allowed himself to be interviewed, but Henri Cartier-Bresson, here nearing 100, comes off as a marvelous, spritely, and companionable figure in Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye . With eyes that glow like Yoda's, and a bald head that recalls his fellow humanistic giants Jean Renoir and Henry Miller, Cartier-Bresson, arguably the most influential photographer who ever lived, recalls how he caught, over and over again, the Moment. His work is really a series of global verité portraits  of leisure and war, of celebrity and daily life  that he somehow memorialized with a light and compositional richness to rival Rembrandt. The Impassioned Eye  makes that genius disarmingly accessible.

"Taking pictures means holding your breath with all your faculties concentrated on capturing a fleeting reality," declares the pioneering photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson near the end of Heinz Butler's austere documentary portrait, "Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye." In the small but stately film, completed a year before Cartier-Bresson's death at 95 in August 2004, he slowly leafs through volumes of his black-and-white photographs, shows some of his later drawings and muses on his art to the severe, prickly strains of Bach piano music. Even when viewed secondhand in a movie, these photographs are something to see. Their formal elegance is balanced by an intense, pulsing humanity. In all his photographs, Cartier-Bresson says, "geometry is the foundation." The documentary, which subscribes to the Great Man school of reverential portraiture, is not a biography but an interview (in French, simultaneously translated into English) conceived as a master class on art appreciation, with guest commentators augmenting Cartier-Bresson's own sparsely chosen words. A recurrent presence is the French actress Isabelle Huppert, who points to a portrait he took of her and says that it reveals a side of her personality she had never seen before. His pictures, she says, capture the "deep, mysterious bond between people and the things around them." But since the pictures speak so eloquently for themselves, her words are redundant. The keys to taking a good portrait, insists Cartier-Bresson, are making people forget they're in front of a camera and seizing the moment of truth as it passes. Portraits of Leonard Bernstein conducting, Isaac Stern playing the violin, Coco Chanel cracking a rare smile and Alexander Calder and Igor Stravinsky relaxing capture such unguarded moments. What sentimentality accrues to his famous subjects resides in the palpable aura of grandeur surrounding them. Arthur Miller shows off a picture of Marilyn Monroe, taken by Cartier-Bresson on the set of "The Misfits" while she was lost in thought, and says that it reveals her as she really was. The playwright's and the photographer's simpatico went far beyond a connection to the actress. Some of Cartier-Bresson's most emotionally charged pictures were taken in the United States in the 1930's and 40's and evoke the same raw-boned social realism that surges through Miller's greatest plays. "America is a place of great extremes, and if you choose to look at the extremes, it can be very tragic," Miller says. An intrepid world traveler, Cartier-Bresson had the instinct to be present at many of the flashpoints of modern history. He was in India when Gandhi  died and in China for the Communist takeover. He also expresses a special nostalgia for Mexico and its "passion." In his most vehement statement, he declares his revulsion to colonialism. But he still insists that he doesn't have a message and is not trying to prove anything. The pictures suggest otherwise. They show a complex and emotionally engaged observer who is innately, even fiercely political in his recognition of inequality and injustice. "Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye" is not rated.
More home movie than documentary, The Impassioned Eye sits photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson  down to spin a few anecdotes about his art, shortly before his death in 2004. Isabelle Huppert , Arthur Miller , and other artist admirers are on hand to add gravitas to his buoyant reminiscences (not subtitled but translated in dour voiceover). Anyone searching for a bio along with the homage should look elsewherefor instance, in the volumes of work Cartier -Bresson pages through (some spark a fleet- ing memory, others merit a sleepy nod). Such informality leads to numerous lulls, but when the photographer perks up the results are delightful, as when he spies his portrait of Alexander Calder  and gleefully imitates the artist's gruff rumble, or the sneaking smile that appears when he sees an image of his wife, photographer Martine Franck . Cartier- Bresson admits the modestly Proustian nature of these remembrances but insists that he lives day to day, still searching for "the decisive moment" to capture in his frame and his sketches, until the past sneaks up like a burp, which he demonstrates with gaseous gusto.
