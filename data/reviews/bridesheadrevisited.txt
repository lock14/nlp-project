The new "Brideshead Revisited" opens with a shot of an ocean liner cutting its way through the night. Aboard, a man races after a woman he appears to recognize. She runs off but ends the chase with a hello. It's factual to say that the film has been adapted from Evelyn Waugh's novel, but the filmmakers appear to have thrown a copy of "Titanic" in among the source material.
The boat doesn't sink, just the movie. It's a fruitless attempt to mine decorousness from spiritual suffering and movie romance from religion. The film plays fast and loose with the book, until its emotional depths, spiritual conflicts, and Waugh's discreet humor have been wrung out. This "Brideshead" is a familiar story that could be interchanged with a number of ostensibly dissimilar movies until something homogenous materializes - "The English Patient's Titanic Atonement."
We start with that nautical reunion then promptly back up 10 years to explain everything. It takes a supremely involving movie to keep you from wondering how long until we get back to that boat. And depending on your tolerance for aching glances, unpersuasive kissing, poster-worthy photography, and enviable art direction, it can amount to a very long time.
"Brideshead Revisited" does have the natural human elements of Waugh's 1945 book going for it. Middle-class Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) enters Oxford as an aspiring painter and falls immediately under the spell of Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw), an effete, teddy bear-carrying, alcoholic aristocrat who, in this droll yet flamboyant incarnation, would be at home fronting any British pop group from the 1980s.
Sebastian belongs to an intensely Catholic family whose signature property - the titular manor - doubles as a kind of cathedral for the devout and the noble. Sebastian, who introduces himself by drunkenly puking in Charles's dorm, fancies the idea of modeling for his new friend, the implication being that the spell is mutual.
Sebastian whisks Charles to Brideshead where he eventually meets one of Sebastian's sisters, Julia (Hayley Atwell), a girl as sharp in youth as her flapper's bob. Sebastian summons Charles to Brideshead to impress him, and the multiple trips are a success. He falls in love with boy, girl, and real estate. And it looks like the film might bear down on the fragile emotional bond between the arriviste, the siblings, and the property. But when Sebastian sees his friend kiss his sister, you don't feel the earth shatter. The attraction between Julia and Charles doesn't have that kind of power.
The connection between the men makes the other relationships seem mechanical. The director, Julian Jarrold, oversees a nice montage of Charles and Sebastian frolicking around the grounds. There are also less than sober pecks on the mouth and skinny-dipping in the fountain. But the movie's screenwriters, Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock, back off from any serious sexual exploration. We deduce that Sebastian is gay (his scarves are 10 times the thickness of everyone else's) and that Charles is not gay enough.
He's not Catholic enough, either. Emma Thompson, her hair piled and ashen, arrives as Lady Marchmain, Brideshead's staunch matriarch, and proceeds to invoke a fear of God in atheistic Charles (he was merely agnostic in the novel) and restore one in the fiercest two of her four children; they all make a humorous postprandial jaunt to the chapel. But here the family that prays too much together eventually falls apart. For years the lady's husband (Michael Gambon) has been living with his adoring mistress (Greta Scacchi) in Venice, in rejection of his wife's judgment and rectitude.
What's missing from "Brideshead" '08 is the philosophical glue that gives all the decadence a real quake of rebellion. The movie doesn't capture a tradition worth rejecting. The falls from grace have to land much harder in order for the returns to it to have any hope of stirring us emotionally. This is what happens when a novel's interior girding - its point of view - is discarded in favor of the external trappings, as though movies lack the capacity to burrow into characters' psyches. It's not the medium's shortcoming, it's the moviemakers'.
The film is polite but devoid of real carnal or social pleasure or real risk - the elements that thrived in Waugh's book and were loosely present in that legendarily thorough 1981 British television version of "Brideshead Revisited," with a young, irresistibly phlegmy Jeremy Irons as Charles and the superb Anthony Andrews as Sebastian."
Like Irons, Goode has a remarkable alertness. From the side, he's thin as a credit card, but there's enough going on inside him to keep Charles from being the cipher this adaptation might have settled for. Atwell, who played the actress Ewan McGregor fell for in Woody Allen's "Cassandra's Dream," never finds the conviction the end of the movie needs. She knows how to play Julia's youthful truculence but the girlishness stays with her for the entire performance.
Meanwhile, Whishaw, who was the Rimbaud Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes's "I'm Not There," seems appropriately miserable here. He's not nearly as vivid as Andrews was, but in bearing down on the character's maternal suffocation, Whishaw does give the part creepiness and sorrow that produce an unexpected movie achievement. He finds the missing link between Evelyn Waugh and Norman Bates.


It may sound odd to say so, but among the many things that drive our affection for British literary costume drama (the plummy accents! The drawing rooms! Those hunky yet so civilized men!), one is surely a nostalgia for repression. Viewed from the vantage of messy, vulgar, let-it-all-hang-out America, the prospect of a society in which everything is kept in its stuffy place exerts a special allure. When the 11-hour British TV adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited   aired on PBS in 1982, the very diffidence of the series was exquisite: Inch by inch, hour by hour, it dangled luxury and desire in front of its hero, Jeremy Irons ' Charles Ryder, only to keep reminding him of their heavy spiritual price.
The new movie version of Brideshead Revisited  stays relatively true to Waugh's plot, and Julian Jarrold has directed it lavishly, but the main difference is that the film's emotions keep sloshing around on the surface. Sebastian Flyte, the troubled, indulgent rich kid who still carries a teddy bear, and whose guilt about his homosexual leanings turns him into a drunk, is now a flamboyant, hair-tossing delinquent played by Ben Whishaw with a pout so petulant he makes Jonathan Rhys Meyers look like a smiley-face button. Charles, the middle-class, mildly reptilian painter played by Irons with such close-to-the-vest anguish, has become, in the person of Matthew Goode, a sprightly good fellow, charmingly at ease in his skin. Even Charles' atheism, so pivotal to the plot, now seems less a rigid stance on his part than a benign philosophical shrug. Charles falls for Julia (Hayley Atwell), Sebastian's sister, and that's a big problem, since Sebastian gets jealous easily, and he comes from a clan of passionate Catholics (even the lapsed ones).
The one performer who seems at home with the gravity of it all is Emma Thompson , who portrays the family matriarch, Lady Marchmain, as a woman so defined by faith that she's a beatific monster. The only life that matters to her is the afterlife, and Thompson, rolling her vowels like marbles, finds a radiance in that view, even as Lady Marchmain squashes her children's happiness in this  life. Brideshead Revisited  is opulent and watchable, yet except for Thompson's acting, it's missing something  a grander, more ambivalent vision of the England it depicts dying out. In the series, we looked at that palatial fortress of Brideshead manor and thought: Here, in one house, is a fading empire. In the movie, it's just sublime real estate.

 “Brideshead Revisited,” Julian Jarrold’s strenuously picturesque adaptation of the novel by Evelyn Waugh, conducts a whirlwind tour of the quadrangles of Oxford and the canals of Venice, always returning to the grand country house of the title, impersonated with lapidary dignity by Castle Howard. At Brideshead, Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode), a young man with artistic ambition and no special pedigree, falls under the spell of an aristocratic Roman Catholic family, conceiving first a “romantic friendship” with the dissolute, epicene younger son, Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw), and then lusting, in his understated English way, after Sebastian’s sister Julia (Hayley Atwell).  It is impossible to avoid mentioning that this story has been told on screen before, in a mini-series that was broadcast on PBS in 1982 and that holds up remarkably well. That version had a cast of first-rate British actors, some of them already known to American audiences (Claire Bloom,  Laurence Olivier) and others whose fame was about to take wing (notably Jeremy Irons, who played Charles). Mr. Jarrold’s rendition, with some fine British actors of its own, notably Michael Gambon and Emma Thompson as Sebastian and Julia’s estranged parents, is necessarily shorter and less faithful to Waugh’s book, and also, for what it’s worth, more cinematic. It is also tedious, confused and banal.  But first let’s look at the pretty pictures. The earlier adaptation was shot in a functional style that favored expository clarity over visual expressiveness. Mr. Jarrold, free of any such constraint, goes for tilted frames and asymmetrical, poetic compositions. The cinematographer, Jess Hall, renders Gothic interiors in a chiaroscuro as rich and smooth as béarnaise sauce. And the clothes, the accents, the accessories! Ah, yes. England between the wars. Storm clouds gathering on the horizon, old chap. Lots of smoking and tuxedo-wearing in the meantime.  It is not Mr. Jarrold’s fault that this landscape has been so heavily trodden over by others. But he and the screenwriters, Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock,  can be blamed for finding so little new or interesting to say about it, and for systematically stripping Waugh’s novel of its telling nuances and provocative ideas. His “Brideshead Revisited” focuses on Charles’s successive  infatuations with Sebastian, whom he meets on his first day at Oxford, and then with Julia, whom he encounters during a summer visit to Brideshead. In both relationships Charles is both passive and opportunistic, masking his prurience and what Sebastian and Julia’s mother, Lady Marchmain, calls his “hunger” with an air of sympathy and good manners.  Charles is a complicated character, who causes a lot of trouble in the Flyte-Marchmain family even as he pretends to be a detached observer of its internal drama. The role calls for a mix of diffidence and magnetism — Charles is a shy, stoical seducer — but Mr. Goode shows all the charisma of a stalk of boiled asparagus molded into the likeness of Jeremy Irons. The film can’t explain why Julia or Sebastian would conceive a risky, tempestuous passion for Charles other than that Waugh seemed to think they might.  Mr. Whishaw, an able enough actor, falls into easy, caricatural  indications of alcoholism and homosexuality, trembling and pouting and occasionally pulling himself into an attitude of doomed, fragile nobility. Ms. Atwell, by far the best thing about the film, manages to endow Julia, always the most enigmatic figure in the story, with a credible sense of internal conflict. Julia, like her mother, is headstrong and intelligent but, in large part because of her mother’s baleful influence, radically limited in her choices and chances.  About that mother. Ms. Thompson  as usual is impeccable, but Lady Marchmain’s monstrosity betrays the weakness of Mr. Jarrold’s grasp of Waugh,  or perhaps his high-minded intention to improve on the old master’s unfashionably reactionary and bothersomely contradictory views about society and religion. Lady Marchmain, in this “Brideshead,” is a nearly allegorical figure of religious fanaticism and rigid piety. Her pathological devotion to her faith is what drove away her husband and deformed her children.  Her dogmatism makes her Charles’s foil and provokes him, for once, to take a stand. At dinner he declares himself an atheist, and he and his hostess spar through clenched teeth over matters of the spirit. But the argument, as Mr. Jarrold stages it, carries no sense of intellectual conviction or historical context. It’s more like Dr. Seuss than Evelyn Waugh: The star-bellied sneetches had bellies with stars, and the plain-bellied sneetches had none upon thars.  In Waugh’s book  — and, I’m compelled to add, that fine old mini-series it was made into — religious commitments and social relations were part of a thickly detailed, complicated and ancient lived reality. The long experience of English Catholics as a religious minority, the subtle gradations of class in the British university system, the crazy quilt of sexual norms and taboos governing the lives of young adults: all of this is what makes “Brideshead Revisited” live and breathe as a novel. None of it registers with any force in this lazy, complacent film, which takes the novel’s name in vain.  “Brideshead Revisited” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual content.

A finely wrought, Merchant-Ivory-style Brit-lit adaptation rather curiously unloaded by Miramax smack amid Stateside summer tentpole season -- just before fall fest season and the unveiling of awards contenders -- "Brideshead Revisited" offers lush and compelling drama drawn from Evelyn Waugh's beloved novel. Purists may blanch at the screenplay's changes to the source material's narrative fine points, but its spirit survives intact. Fond memories of the 1981 miniseries likely will only help prod curious fans into theaters, suggesting respectable B.O. on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Scenarists Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock (like director Julian Jarrold, all veteran adapters of literary and historical tales for film and TV) have created a few bold shortcuts that will invariably distress folks who justifiably view the Granada TV mini as one of the truest page-to-screen transfers ever. But then, it had 11 hours in which to reproduce every nuance. And this version's changes, in the end, serve to communicate the novel's complexities within a viable, theatrical-friendly format without ever appearing to rush or coarsen its general arc. (Still, one wouldn't guess this from the film's trailer, which strains to make it look like a pulse-pounding intrigue in period duds, a la "Vanity Fair" or "The Scarlet Letter.")
Allowing auds sufficient retro-aristo-lifestyle sumptuousness for their dollar, yet exhibiting admirable, intelligent directorial restraint, this "Brideshead" is mainstream arthouse fare par excellence. Tale is framed, as in the novel, by the stationing of Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) as a WWII British Army officer in a lavish country estate-turned-temporary military base -- a location he's visited before under very different circumstances.
Bulk of the narrative is set earlier, in the 1920s, as middle-class Charles commences studies at Oxford and falls into the company of fellow student Lord Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw), whose impulsive hedonism and affectionate nature charm him. When Sebastian shows Charles the extraordinary ancestral grounds he grew up in, the latter is further seduced by such sheer magnificence.
But as Sebastian is too well mannered to say outright, Brideshead Castle is, for him, a prison of instilled guilt, to be escaped by any means possible -- which, in his case, turns out to be alcohol. With Sebastian's coolly alluring sister Julia (Hayley Atwell) also in residence, the fun comes to a sharp end with the dreaded arrival of their mother, Lady Marchmain (Emma Thompson) -- a devout, most bitterly husband-abandoned Catholic.
In the hope that the visitor's solidity might steady her son, Lady Marchmain encourages him to accompany the sibs on a trip to visit their father, Lord Marchmain (Michael Gambon), and his mistress, Cara (Greta Scacchi), in Venice. This is another idyllic time, though the growing attraction between Charles and Julia deals Sebastian a crushing blow that sends him sliding further into alcoholism.
As the years move onward, Sebastian, Charles and Julia drift far from one another, yet remain bound by conflicted secular yearnings and sacred guilt.
While the film offers the closest thing to a gay love story in mainstream cinema since "Brokeback Mountain," it wouldn't be quite right to call the Charles-Sebastian dynamic homoerotic: True to the novel, what Cara terms a "romantic friendship" is tangible more as true love than as mere sexual attraction, no matter that Sebastian suffers the stigma of feeling both.
Unfolding at a pace that never feels rushed despite the compacted runtime, pic clearly portrays the Flyte offspring as forever crippled by the sense of sin imbued in them by their mother. Yet what plays for some time as a fairly harsh condemnation of oppressive religious morality finally becomes a poignant acknowledgement of faith, encapsulating Charles' new attitude toward it in a beautifully low-key close.
Goode provides a fine center of gravity as the middle-class tourist in heady but toxic upper-class realms. Thompson superbly etches a complex, eventually tragic portrait in her relatively few scenes.
Whishaw and Atwell are fine, but leave perhaps a slightly less distinctive stamp on their roles than the series' Anthony Andrews and Diana Quick, respectively.
Without tipping into excess eye candy, the design contribs are all one could wish for, handsomely captured in Jess Hall's widescreen lensing. Adrian Johnson's graceful score is another notable plus in a package that, in every department, approaches the material with understated respect rather than stylistic flash.
Reportedly, Paul Bettany, Jude Law and Jennifer Connelly were attached until helmer David Yates was poached for last year's "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." One can say, in this case, that settling for the B team turned out well.

Making notes in 1949 for a review of Evelyn Waugh 's Brideshead Revisited , George Orwell  wrote that Waugh is about as good a novelist as one can be... while holding untenable opinions. Which is a nice way of saying that Waugh, a world-class satirist of everyone from the rich down, was also a social-climbing snob, an anti-Semite and fascist sympathizer, a hater of modernity and by extension (as anyone knows who has read The Loved One , his handy evisceration of the California funeral business) all things American.
Not that this deterred the millions of Americans who wolfed down the British television adaptation of Brideshead  when it aired on PBS  in 1981. Cruising right past the novel's crass Yank (disguised as a Canadian, but it was all the same to Waugh) who does business with the Nazis and sells his wife for a few paintings, just about every Anglophile I knew fell for the lovely country seat and its delicate-featured nobles dripping with diamonds, Catholic guilt and all. Personally, I never saw the point of stretching out this crisply written and none too long novel about England collapsing under the pressure of social change into a depressive 11-hour slog. A movie adaptation, even one passed through the pop filter of co-writer Andrew Davies , British TV's designated gatekeeper of all properties literary to the masses, sounds like much more fun. And though I can imagine Waugh rolling his eyes at the very idea of Brideshead Revisited  as a heartbreaking romantic epic, this remake is, often inadvertently, closer to the novel's spirit than the sepulchral television series, albeit still not half as waggishly Waugh-ish as Bright Young Things , Stephen Fry 's delightfully naughty interpretation of Vile Bodies .
Adapted by Davies with Jeremy Brock , Brideshead isn't much of a story. Charles Ryder  (Matthew Goode ), a wan young student who comes from trade, is taken up at Oxford  by the feverishly gay and increasingly alcoholic aristocrat Sebastian Flyte  (Ben Whishaw ) and soon finds himself caught up in Sebastian's struggle with his intensely Catholic family. What it lacks in plot, however, is made up for in atmosphere and constant movement. As directed by Julian Jarrold  (who already displayed impressive chops for jollying up the classics by bestowing a saucy love life on Jane Austen  in Becoming Jane ), Brideshead Revisited -revisited is a less gloomy affair than its predecessor, boasting better stately homes and gardens bathed in a warm chocolate glow, colorful trips abroad to Venice and Morocco , a marketably youthful cast, and broad winks at the novel's repressed homosexual attraction between Charles and Sebastian. Nothing wrong with any of thatWaugh was an observant creature of the Jazz Age he deplored.
If the movie strives and fails to redirect the erotic flow to the heterosexual love between Charles Ryder and Sebastian's sister, Julia Flyte , so, too, did Waugh, almost certainly a closeted homosexual inhibited by his conversion to Catholicism. As Julia, Hayley Atwell  has none of TV-Julia Diana Quick's tortured inner radiance, and when she and Charles finally rip off their silken evening clothes aboard a cruise liner, you want to laugh, or look away. In the end nothing that goes on in this youthful triangle proves as compelling as the great, sick love story between the teddy-clutching Sebastian (Whishaw is show-stoppingly queeny and heart-stoppingly vulnerable) and his mummy, an ice-floe nicely understated by Emma Thompson  as a woman at once energized and doomed by her devotion to Catholic orthodoxy.
Waugh, whose cruelty to others in life and literature was legendary, was merciless in taking down this rigidly controlling woman and the son she destroys. But the truly malevolent power of Brideshead Revisited  is his identification with what she stood for  a literal reading of the Vatican  texts, the preservation of ancient tradition, and keeping her snooty class free of contamination by interlopers like Charles  and Waugh himself. Late in the day, Waugh turns a pitiless, accusing gaze on Charles' unacknowledged motives for worming his way into the Marchmain household, and makes him over as a species of villain. You can't read this switcheroo in the 21st-century without revulsion at the self-laceration with which Waugh punished himself for his own pent-up sexuality and his yearning to join a class he was not born into, and at his retreat into unbending religious orthodoxy. Still, though Brideshead Revisited  the movie is far from deep, you have to admire the way it refrains from seizing the day for a post-modern lecture on the perils of fundamentalism, and confines itself to the disturbing vision of Evelyn Waugh.
