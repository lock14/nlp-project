         "The Bridge" is both a beautiful film and a disturbing one, and the connection between those two characteristics makes it the most disquieting of documentaries.
 
  The bridge in question is San Francisco's celebrated Golden Gate, which has the distinction of being both the most photographed man-made structure in North America and the single most popular suicide site in the world.
 


         






    This dichotomy, amply documented in a New Yorker article by Tad Friend that inspired the film, caused director Eric Steel to photograph the bridge for the entire year of 2004, setting up both a wide-angle camera and one with a telephoto lens powerful enough to capture individuals walking on the span.
 
  Because Steel misled bridge authorities about the purpose of his cameras and because he ended up with footage of most of the 24 people who jumped to their deaths in that year, "The Bridge" has become a controversial project, accused of being a snuff film and worse.
 
  Yet one has only to watch this troubling, provocative film to see that this criticism is misplaced. For what Steel has done, with able assistance from cinematographer Peter McCandless, editor Sabine Krayenbuhl and composer Alex Heffes, is craft a meditation on the nature of suicide, an attempt to understand the inexplicable: why some people are so intent on ending their lives; what drives them, literally, over the edge.
 
  Yes, it is shocking to see people go over that edge, in some cases leaping over the 4-foot railing (the bridge has no suicide barrier) as casually as rolling out of bed. But Steel has taken pains to tell reporters that saving lives was a priority for him, that the bridge security office was called the moment anything suspicious was seen through the camera.
 
  In truth, the sight of these leaps is more surreal than exploitative, encouraging us to grapple with profoundly unsettling questions about the nature of the will to die that's so at variance with the will to live that generally rules people's lives.
 
  Most of "The Bridge," in fact, is not taken up with jumper footage but with interviews with a wide variety of people: accidental witnesses to the suicides, friends and relatives of those who jumped, even one man whom we see, in a truly amazing sequence, reaching over the rail and physically lifting a potential suicide to safety.
 
  "The Bridge's" most compelling interview is with Kevin Hines, one of the few people to have made the 220-foot jump, hit the water at 75 mph and survive.
 
  Suffering from bipolar disorders since high school, Kevin lucidly describes the circumstances of his jump and what happened when he entered the water. He talks agonizingly about how tough it is for him to have his family and friends perpetually walking on eggshells when he is around. "I just want to be normal again," he says. "But I never will."
 
  If there is a common thread among those interviewed, even the people who merely observed the suicide, it is a feeling of futility and uselessness. Because it is so final, and so finally unknowable, suicide disorients everyone who comes in contact with it.
 
  Those feelings intensify and stretch across a wide spectrum when the suicide is a close friend or relative. Some people blame themselves, some believe the deceased "is in a better place," and a surprising number in effect commiserate with those who felt so trapped, often due to mental illness, that they could not imagine another way to get free. "I don't know why people kill themselves, yet it's a small step to empathize," says Carolyn Pressley, a friend of Gene Sprague, whose suicide features most prominently in the film. "I think we all experience moments of despair, but for most of us the sun comes out."
 
  Though there is some conversation about why these people all chose the Golden Gate as a suicide spot, "The Bridge" chooses a subtle way to answer that question. As extensively photographed by McCandless in all weathers and from a multiplicity of angles, the Golden Gate looks spectacularly beautiful and alluring. We don't have to be told why people go there to die, we see and feel the lure right up on the screen.

 “The Bridge,” an eerie and indelible documentary about suicide, juxtaposes transcendent beauty and personal tragedy as starkly as any film I can recall. Throughout the movie, inspired by “Jumpers,” Tad Friend’s 2003 article in The New Yorker, the Golden Gate Bridge shimmers like a pathway to heaven. Photographed from multiple perspectives, at all times of the day and in all kinds of weather, the bridge looms as an unearthly monument that seems to float in space,  especially when ringed with fog through which the spires of San Francisco peek.  The Golden Gate, however, is also a legendary point of departure for people determined to end their lives. And as the camera fixes its gaze on the structure, it captures people leaping to their deaths. The director Eric Steel and his crew spent all of 2004 filming the bridge during daylight hours and caught most of the two-dozen suicides that occurred that year.  Mr. Steel has compared these images to Bruegel’s painting “Landscape With the Fall of Icarus”; because the fatal leaps go almost unnoticed by passers-by, the analogy sticks.  “The Bridge” juxtaposes breathtaking scenes of the Golden Gate and its environs, shot in digital video, with the harrowing personal stories of family members and friends of those who jumped. Because their testimony is remarkably free of religious cant and of cozy New Age bromides, this is one of the most moving and brutally honest films about suicide ever made.  There is little hand-wringing and no accusatory finger-wagging. A close friend of one jumper worries that the antidepressants she gave him without a prescription, and that made him sleepless, may have contributed to his suicide. But her account suggests it would have happened sooner or later.  “The Bridge” begins and ends with the story of Gene Sprague, a long-haired 34-year-old rocker-type who was periodically photographed prowling around the bridge before he made his final leap, a dramatic backward dive. Mr. Sprague left his friends pondering whether he heard a message left on his answering machine offering him a job managing a video-game store.  Another jumper, 44-year-old Lisa Smith, was given a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia while a teenager and is remembered by her family as struggling with severe mental illness for most of her life. Shortly before her suicide, all her teeth, which had rotted from a combination of medication and an addiction to cola, had to be removed, and that may have been the trigger.  For all its discussion of mental illness, “The Bridge” is metaphysically rather than clinically oriented. No mental health professionals are on hand to talk about suicide. The closest the movie comes to offering a case history is the story of Kevin Hines, a young man with bipolar disorder who decided midway in his leap that he wanted to live and arranged his body into a sitting position before he hit the water. He survived with severe damage to his lower back. Mr. Hines recalls standing on the bridge crying for 40 minutes before making the jump. The only person to approach him was a German tourist, oblivious to his tears, who asked him to take her snapshot.  In the language of Wallace Stevens, “death is the mother of beauty.” The fact that so many people choose an earthly paradise in which to end their lives reinforces the film’s intimation that people’s hopes of ending psychic suffering by moving to a more pleasant place may be futile. If suicidal impulses are your demons, they will probably accompany you to the place of salvation.  “The Bridge” raises inevitable questions about the filmmaker’s motives and methods and whether he could have tried harder to save lives. It raises age-old moral and aesthetic questions about the detachment from one’s surroundings that gazing through the camera’s lens tends to produce. Those questions remain to be addressed in an article, not a review.  Strictly as a film, this is an impressive piece of work, although its musical soundtrack (by Alex Heffes), while somber, doesn’t measure up to its imagery.  The sadness and fatalism the film can instill are perhaps best expressed by a surviving loved one’s description of a jumper: “Some people say the body is a temple. He thought his body was a prison. In his mind, he knew he was loved, that he had everything and could do anything. And yet he felt trapped, and that was the only way he could get free.”  “The Bridge” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has shocking images of suicidal leaps.

One of the world's most trafficked and recognizable tourist sights, the Golden Gate Bridge also holds the unenviable title of its single most popular suicide destination. Eric Steel's docu "The Bridge" doesn't so much analyze this phenomenon as capture it -- he set up multiple cameras around the structure throughout 2004, recording nearly all that year's 23 fatal leaps (and sole non-fatal one), then interviewed grieving relatives and friends. Compelling result is handled with enough dignified artistry to quell most fears of exploitation. Still, ethical questions remain, to be weighed against the pic's undeniable curiosity-value appeal to broadcasters and specialized distribs.
Approximately 1,300 people are known to have leapt from the bridge since its 1937 opening; no doubt others have gone unwitnessed, and many jumpers' bodies are never found, carried out to the Pacific by currents. Virtually all jump from the side facing San Francisco -- underlining what one interviewee calls "the false, romantic promise" of the beautiful structure and city itself.
Steel starts out with handsome views of the area and bridge, creating a mythic aura abetted by Alex Heffes' ethereal score. Glimpses of pedestrians and bicyclists on the Golden Gate's walkway are wonen in. 
Sabine Krayenbuhl's clever editing almost imperceptibly narrows our focus on the everyday until we find ourselves sticking with a portly man in jogging suit who simply hops over the railing and plunges. The impossibility of predicting with any assurance who might be a suicide risk on the bridge is thus illustrated straightaway.
Some may take exception to the cat-and-mouse suspense the helmer builds in his grim context by teasing auds with views of pedestrians who may or may not prove suicidal. (Helmer noted after the screening that they called Bridge Patrol whenever someone's conduct began to seem preparatory to a jump, saving several lives. But often such behaviors were absent, or too abrupt, making preventative action impossible.)
Gradually we become acquainted with some of the deceased's individual stories, told by surviving family members and other intimates. A common thread is mental illness, with many survivors half-resigned to the likelihood of their loved one's fate. 
A recurrent motif throughout the film are glimpses of Gene, a leather-jacketed, longhaired guy who spent 90 minutes walking across and lingering on the bridge before finally making a most dramatic backwards fall. Also haunting are segs detailing the circumstances around bipolar-diagnosed youth Kevin Hines' jump -- one of very few instances in which the person survived the four-second tumble and normally body-shattering impact.
Tales are dramatic; the interviewees poignant, and the images -- often following bodies all the way down to the water -- are startling and discomfiting. 
Yet "The Bridge" is quite beautifully put together, in tone and pacing at times achieving a sort of melancholy poetry. (Only misstep is inclusion of some sorrowful songs by Joni Mitchell, Son Volt and others; in this context, pop sentiments feel trite.) 
Feature has already caused local controversy, stirred by the fact that Steel misled authorities about the nature of his project when applying for permits, and did not inform his interviewees that he had actual footage of their loved ones' last moments until much later. Visibly nervous at a Q&A following one SFIFF screening, first-time director Steel (a former VP at Scott Rudin Prods.) said these liberties were necessary to complete a project whose goal was bringing public attention to mental-health and suicide-prevention issues. 
Yet "The Bridge," which has no on-screen input from mental health professionals or suicide experts, never approaches those issues directly -- unlike the material which inspired it, Tad Friend's 2003 "New Yorker" article "Jumpers." Nor does it mention the controversial proposed walkway barrier whose advocacy he also cites as a major motivation for the film.
"The Bridge" is undeniably powerful stuff. But whether it's particularly helpful is less clear.

In his ghoulish documentary, director Eric Steel  examines the Golden Gate's dubious honor as the world's most popular suicide destination. Steel trained cameras on the bridge throughout 2004, watching for jumpers; 24 people obliged. In most cases, the director has the last pathetic snippet of the jumper's life on tape: a tiny human blur plummeting out of the frame, followed by an off-camera splash andnothing. In their wake, the movie dutifully visits survivor after survivordazed roommates, stunned family, unlucky witnesses. But the banal remembered particulars are less upsettingand less revealing, in a suggestive waythan the affectless glimpses of the soon-to-be-departed through Steel's long-range lenses. They could be anyone else on the bridge, right up to the moment they bypass some circuit breaker of survival instinct that keeps the rest of us on the other side of the rail. Equally disturbing, in this context, are the shots of unidentified tourists, walkers, and gawkers who stop to look over the side, then pause just a second longerplainly hearing, if only for an instant, the siren song of the undertow.
