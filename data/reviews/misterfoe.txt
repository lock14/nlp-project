Premiering exclusively in Austin prior to a national rollout two weeks from now, Mister Foe
 is unlike any coming-of-age movie you've seen before. Equal parts sweet and perverse, this Scottish film is unpredictable in places where it might be twee, and subversively fanciful in others where it might be punishing. Billy Elliot
's Bell comes into his own here as a leading man, fully demonstrating his ability to play a compelling range of emotions that leave in question the stability of the young man's mental state. Frighteningly disturbed and desperately needy, the character he plays, Hallam Foe, also bears a contradictory cocksureness and bemused sense of self-awareness. Things apparently started going badly for Foe after his mother's death in a boating accident two years ago, which the teenager alone regards as suspicious. His chief suspect is his father's secretary, Verity (Forlani), who married his dad (Hinds) rather quickly afterward. The young man develops into a full-fledged Peeping Tom who uses his ever-present binoculars to spy on his father and Verity, as well as his sister and other townsfolk. He hides out in his treehouse and bedecks himself in bizarre war paint and sometimes wears his mother's dress and an animal pelt on his head as part of his ritual. A crisis forces him to flee the family home for the streets of Glasgow, and almost as we begin to feel sympathy for the seemingly helpless lad, this voyeur and lock-picker finds a new perch in the city and a new subject, Kate (Myles), who looks rather like his dead mother. Fortunately for Foe, Kate eventually announces that she "likes creepy men" (as I said, it's all a bit fanciful), but there's still much conflict to resolve before the two can see eye-to-eye. This proclivity for outr� sexual situations is a holdover for director Mackenzie from his earlier film Young Adam
, though it must be said that much less is seen here than imagined. Mackenzie is a striking image-maker, and this film is also brightened by its animated credit sequences and a library full of accompanying rock music by the likes of Juana Molina, Sons & Daughters, and Clinic, and theme music by Glaswegians Franz Ferdinand. At times, it seems as though the film sidesteps the full implications of its voyeurism theme, but the story is told with such heart and conviction that it also manages to avoid succumbing to the ickiness factor. If there's any justice, Mister Foe
 will be a film to watch.

 “I like creepy guys.” This is what Kate, a personnel manager at an Edinburgh hotel, says to a young co-worker after a few rounds of drinks one evening. As it happens, both of them are in luck. Hallam Foe, the co-worker in question, is even creepier than Kate suspects. He has been stalking her  since before she hired him, and his main extracurricular activities are peering across the rooftops into her windows and scrambling up to her skylight to spy on her as she sleeps, has sex and practices her kickboxing.  This young man — “Mister Foe” to American viewers of David Mackenzie’s new film, which was called “Hallam Foe” (the title of Peter Jinks’s novel) in Britain — is evidently troubled. Back home at his father’s estate, which he fled for the Scottish capital, Hallam was a seasoned  voyeur with a taste for dressing up in animal skins and lipstick. His treehouse served as a shrine to his dead mother. She drowned in the loch, and Hallam is increasingly certain that she was murdered by his stepmother (Claire Forlani). Kate (Sophia Myles) first caught his eye because of her uncanny resemblance to poor old Mum (also embodied by Ms. Myles, in photographs), and his fixation on her is both sexual and filial. Creepy indeed.  Hallam (played by the excellent Jamie Bell, who has gained some skill and shed a bit of cuteness since “Billy Elliot”) would no doubt benefit from some counseling, and  the melodramatic twists of the plot ultimately serve as a kind of substitute therapy. It’s certainly more entertaining to watch a confused young man work out his issues through kinky sex and daredevil wall-climbing than to be a fly on the wall as he talks things out with a shrink. And if the extremity of Hallam’s temperament tests the limits of our sympathy as well as our credulity, Mr. Bell’s ability to seem by turns sweet and scary prevents us from losing interest entirely.  So does Mr. Mackenzie’s success in translating Mr. Jinks’s prose into an atmosphere that is both gritty and picturesque. He infuses the examination of Hallam’s emotional disorder with enough macabre and comical touches to prevent “Mister Foe” from sliding into the clinical sensationalism of the case study. That is more or less what it turns out to be in the end, but the film is also a nimble, acrobatic tour of Edinburgh, traipsing through narrow alleyways, up drainpipes and across gables and gutters as it follows Hallam on his pathological  way.  And the object of his desperate, icky and fond attention is certainly well chosen. Like Emily Mortimer, who played Ewan McGregor’s dream woman in Mr. Mackenzie’s previous film, “Young Adam,” Ms. Myles has the task of turning a phantasm of adolescent desire into a real person.  Kate’s insistence, late in the movie, that she is just that is both superfluous and unconvincing. In her loneliness, her toughness, her perfect mix of maternal warmth and sexual adventurousness, she is at heart a literary conceit, an inhabitant of that realm of the male imagination where lust and sentimentality meet and mingle. But Ms. Myles inhabits the role with such crisp and understated wit that she manages to hold such doubts at bay. Common sense might suggest that a woman in Kate’s position should change her locks, call the police or move to another town when a guy like Hallam shows up, but somehow she never seems more sensible than when she does the opposite of what prudence might dictate.  The smaller performances are nearly as strong as Ms. Myles’s and Mr. Bell’s, even when the characters are a bit too broadly drawn, like Ms. Forlani’s gold-digger or a philandering brute played by Jamie Sives. Ciaran Hinds, a welcome presence wherever he goes — from “Munich” to “Miami Vice” to “Margot at the Wedding” — strikes the right notes of obliviousness and paternal worry as Hallam’s father, vexed and concerned about his son even as he is unable to see how much of the boy’s waywardness is his fault.  To the rest of us it’s pretty clear from the start. And the main problem with “Mister Foe” is that Hallam’s strangeness is a puzzle only to him and those around him. He’s more of a mystification than a mystery, and never quite creepy enough to risk our not liking him.

Tip-top performances, led by young British thesp Jamie Bell, and a deftly handled tone reflecting all the title teen's confused emotions make "Hallam Foe" a viewing delight. Left-of-center rites of passager, marbled with comic moments, confirm writer-director David Mackenzie ("Young Adam") as one of Blighty's most distinctive talents, with a real feel for emotional intimacy and a cinematic way of presenting it. Though pic is unlikely to be a mass audience-pleaser, "Hallam" looks capable of tweaking plenty of upscale pockets in the hands of savvy distribs and with critical support. Film perked up the final days of this year's Berlinale.
Bell plays Hallam Foe, 17-year-old son of apparently wealthy Scottish Highlands businessman Julius Foe (Ciaran Hinds). Hallam has retreated into a semi-fantasy world following the death of his beloved mom. Still convinced she was murdered by his stepmother Verity (Claire Forlani), rather than having drowned by accident in the nearby loch, Hallam amuses himself by spying on people and living like a pesky monkey in a treetop cabin that doubles as a shrine to mom.
Tone of intimacy and playfulness is immediately set by a sequence in which, half-naked and wearing a badger skin, he abseils down on a couple enjoying a roll in the forest. But when his sister (Lucy Holt) leaves for Australia, Hallam feels isolated, and a chance exchange of bodily fluids with his stepmother turns into Verity's big kiss-off to her troublesome stepson.
With Hallam's background succinctly sketched, pic follows him as he hops a train to Edinburgh in search of a new life, but the sight of a striking young woman in the street turns him in another direction. Following her to her workplace, he finds she's the personnel manager of a large hotel and manages to charm his way into giving him a menial job in the kitchen.
But the real reason Hallam followed her was because Kate (Sophia Myles, from "Tristan & Isolde") is a dead ringer for his mom in her youth. That's the start of a funny, quirky, romantic and lightly dramatic love story in which Hallam, spying on her apartment from his new nest in a clocktower, becomes entranced by the businesslike and forthright Kate.
However, when Kate's married lover (Jamie Sives) finds Hallam is playing Peeping Tom, and an 18th-birthday drink leads to Kate taking Hallam back to her apartment, the latter finds himself on an emotional roller coaster beyond his or Kate's control.
Straight sex as a spiritual placebo was one of the driving forces behind the main character in "Young Adam." Mackenzie proves again he's an ace handler of such material, but the sex in "Hallam Foe" has none of the dark joylessness of the earlier pic. Chemistry between Bell and Myles is especially good, with the former radiating a mixture of angelic charm and manipulation, and the latter sending out subtle signals that Kate, underneath her business suit, simply needs regular servicing.
Tightly honed script, from the novel by Peter Jinks, is backed by equally tight editing. Film loses some momentum (and becomes a tad overexplanatory) with Hallam's return to the Highlands, but a beautifully played coda ends the pic on a moving and satisfying note.
Perfs are all on the money, from Hinds' essentially weak paterfamilias to Forlani's coolly upper-class stepmom and Sives' thuggish lover. Scottish accents are light throughout, apart from Ewen Bremner's inpenetrable turn as a jokey bell captain.
Widescreen lensing by Mackenzie regular Giles Nuttgens is equally textured and well-composed, and a bouncy pop-rock score keeps things largely on the lighter side. Lively graphics for both main and end titles also add bounce.

Young Hallam Foe (Jamie Bell ) is convinced that his stepmother (Claire Forlani ) accelerated her upward trajectory from dad's secretary to dad's wife by offing his mom, but the coroner says it was suicide. An unswayed Hallam sublimates his grief and loathing into spying on couples going at it, dad (Ciaran Hinds ) and stepmom primarily. After sleeping with the latter, he runs off to Glasgow , finds a doppelgänger for his deceased parent in Kate (Sophia Myles ), and sets about spying on her in the bedroom. 
These are unlikely components for a comedy—which Mister Foe  , against the odds, definitely is. Co-writer/director David Mackenzie  has jokingly claimed this as the capstone of his "sex trilogy" (2003's mostly celebrated Young Adam  and 2005's mostly ignored Asylum  preceded it), a threesome (har) of films extrapolating a single idea: In Mackenzie's world, wholesome sex is a possibility for other people, but never for the (anti-)hero, whose couplings are always the sublimated expression of something else. What makes Mister Foe  such unlikely fun, though, is Bell's accomplished smart-ass routine and Mackenzie's blithe attitude toward taboos. Every possible voyeuristic/incestuous kink gets a workout. "I like creepy guys," Kate declares, but she doesn't know the half of it. This is gonzo Mackenzie—a good thing—but some caveats: Up until the last psychotic break, Mister Foe  coddles its hero's stalker tendencies a bit too much, threatening to transform them into mere Sundance quirk. (The acid of the upcoming In the City of Sylvia , which once and for all takes the romanticism out of obsessive behavior, is missed here.) The whole thing's poised uneasily somewhere between urban fairy tale and actual human psychodrama, never really landing in one place or the other. And those for whom "hipster" is the ultimate pejorative might want to steer clear: Animated opening credits (courtesy of David Shrigley ) are set to Orange Juice, and the soundtrack's filled with an all-star, nearly-all-Scottish cast of very fashionable bands. What's left, though, is wit and extreme style, and that's enough. Mackenzie's camera is constantly moving, creating a sinuous trip. Cameras glide through rooms and zoom in on Glasgow's crowded buildings. Best of all, they crane over Foe's head when he's perched in one of his voyeuristic setups on the roof, inducing not vertigo but glee at Mackenzie's skill.
