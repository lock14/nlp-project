At this point, I've seen so many rousingly slick cookie-cutter high school sports movies that I have no real desire to see another one. But that's part of the reason I enjoyed More Than a Game . It tells the story of the ''Fab Five,'' the African-American core members of the Fighting Irish basketball team from St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. Starting in the early 2000s, the team was led to national glory by the young LeBron James. More Than a Game  is a documentary, but it's every inch a triumph-of-the-underdogs fairy tale. Indeed, it's almost funny, at times, to see how many classic Hollywood tropes are replicated, with far more vivid drama, in this expertly edited assemblage of video-shot game footage and hindsight interviews.
There's the day that Dru Joyce III, the team's tiniest member (barely five feet tall), wins a game by shooting seven three-pointers in a row. There's the team's awesome victory streak, which gets interrupted only when the Fab Five grow too cocky. There's the surreal infusion of big-money endorsement deals   in high school!  which no one blinked an eye at until James accepted two free jerseys  from a store, at which point he was benched in the middle of a perfect season. The team had to play without him, and guess what happened? (I won't say.) More Than a Game  could be an extended ESPN special, except that what's moving about it isn't the basketball prowess. It's the die-hard camaraderie that undergirded this squad and lifted it to the top.


 “More Than a Game,” a new documentary directed by Kristopher Belman, invites comparisons with “Hoop Dreams,” Steve James’s 1994 film about the lives of two young Chicago basketball players. That movie was an almost miraculous fusion of filmmaking art and real-life narrative full of twists and reversals. “More Than a Game,” which looks back on the achievements of a high school basketball team in Akron, Ohio, that happened to include the future N.B.A. superstar LeBron James, is halfway there. The art is lacking, but the material is remarkable enough to make up for pedestrian filmmaking.  The elements of the story are, at first glance, familiar: a group of players of varying ability, a coach who seems an unlikely candidate to lead them, various breakthroughs and setbacks on the way to the big game. The coach is Dru Joyce II, a former businessman whose interest in basketball came about because his son, Dru III, in spite of his small size, was crazy about the game. The elder Joyce coached a youth league team that included Sian Cotton, Willie McGee, James and his son, four friends who went on to become the nucleus of the Fighting Irish of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School.  After the coach who recruited those young men ascended to the college ranks, Joyce took over and led the Irish to state and national prominence. The tale of this journey, conveyed like the rest of “More Than a Game” through old video footage and recent interviews, is heartening but sometimes less than riveting. There is some interesting insight into the friendships among the players, the tensions between the coach and his son and the uneasy assimilation of a fifth player, Romeo Travis, into the close-knit nucleus of the team. But it’s mostly a whole bunch of games, many of them shot in low-grade home video.  Along the way, you catch glimpses of themes that might have been explored more thoroughly, as well as of some pretty good basketball. I found myself wanting to go further into Akron and its African-American neighborhoods and to spend more time with the players and their families. Still, there is enough personality and local flavor to create a context for the drama that takes shape in the film’s second half.  In 2002, while he was still a junior at St. Vincent-St. Mary, James was the subject of a Sports Illustrated cover story, and his sudden celebrity takes “More Than a Game” to a place that “Hoop Dreams” only dreamed of. Suddenly the modest celebration of a talented group of kids becomes something else: a half-critical, half-starry-eyed exploration of the money-mad, fame-besotted frenzy that is big-time sports in America. The value of the movie is that it keeps track of the impact that James’s rise had on his friends, his family and his team and reminds the audience that the superstars who so often seem otherworldly and unreal started out as ordinary kids.  It is moving to hear James, an executive producer of the film, talk about the poverty and displacement he experienced as a child and about his attachment to his mother, who was a teenager when he was born. And a lot of the archival video is pretty amazing. Mr. Belman, though, is too enamored of easy emotional payoffs cued by swelling music and manipulative editing, almost as if he did not quite trust the power of his story. And the story might have been richer in its characters and themes if its inspirational aspects were not pushed so hard. As it is, devoted fans of the game, and especially of LeBron James, will love “More Than a Game.” The skeptical and the curious may find themselves wanting more.  “More Than a Game” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has strong language.

With superstar LeBron James as its point man and a big heart at its center, "More Than a Game" is about the boyz from the 'hood who made up the St. Vincent-St. Mary High School basketball team of Akron, Ohio, which launched James into the NBA and is a kind of classic of American sports history. Limited theatrical seems possible, given James' enormous following and an emotionally potent story that involves fast friendships, teamwork, ego, the perils of overconfidence and the entrapments of celebrity. 
The object of helmer Kristopher Belman's attention for about eight years, the story involves high schoolers who, since grade school, had played for the same coach: Dru Joyce, who left corporate America to find more meaning in his life and found more than he bargained for at St. Vincent-St. Mary. Belman has solid material to work with, courtesy of James, Dru Joyce, Sian Cotton and Willie McGee, who were joined by Romeo Travis and together terrorized the Ohio competition. Belman and editor V. Scott Balcerek shape a propulsive, fast-breaking narrative that doesn't quite follow the conventions of fiction, although it sometimes seems like a fairy tale.

More Than a Game  follows Akron 's Fab Four (later Five) kids on the basketball court, from their "Shooting Stars" traveling youth team into high school and a run of championships. The reason this documentary tells their story—instead of that of the team that miraculously upsets the by-then-nationally-recognized starters in junior-year playoffs—is because one of the Fab was LeBron James . Ignored in the film's discussion of James's transition to premature fame is his attempt to swing early NBA  eligibility after the loss, which wouldn't jive with the "All for one" ethic, among the film's many pep talk lessons. The ostensible director here is Kristopher Belman , an Akronite who played court videographer to King James's St. Vincent–St. Mary team, but final cut belongs to LeBron, Inc.  The recent PR flub of Nike  henchmen confiscating footage of James getting gently dunked on in a pickup game testifies to the powerful trust authoring his legacy. The film could be a tie-in to the recent ghostwrite autobiography, Shooting Stars . Most obtrusive, though, is the contribution of Harvey Mason Jr. , producing and soundtracking, who sets Game  adrift on an endless sea of crashing crescendos. Good game footage, a few clear looks at the kids behind it, but mostly as processed as Space Jam .
