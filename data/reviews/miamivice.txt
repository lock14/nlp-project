Very nearly as electrifying as one of South Beach's ubiquitous pastel-peach beachfront cabanas or, alternately, an iridescently deceased jellyfish stranded at low tide and awash in sand fleas, Mann's edgy (read: underlit) take on the vacuous Eighties television cop-opera takes perhaps one too many cues from its cathode predecessor. For one thing, it's all style and precious little substance, drowning in a chromium murk (courtesy of Collateral
's director of photography Dion Beebe), which manages to make this most garish of Floridian playscapes into a dreary, overcast hellscape, alternately queasy and threatening. For another, Farrell and Foxx, as libidinous detective Sonny Crockett and his marginally more grounded partner-detective Ricardo Tubbs, have all the mumbly chemistry of a late Mickey Spillane hangover. There's style to burn, but it's not the kind you'd want to have on your walls, unless crimson back-spatter is the "new black." The script, from Mann, has the formerly five-o'clock-shadowed duo chasing down a rogue drug cartel and Sonny falling for sexy Asian money launderer/moll Li, but the real emphasis here is on globe-hopping. The film jets (and "go-fast" boats) from stateside to Cuba to Colombia to elsewhere with the only noticeable result being that you may well want to book next year's summer holiday in old Havana � the place, in Mann's universe, anyway, has lost little of the sleazy charm on display in 1964's slice of Soviet agitprop Yo Soy Cuba
, and I hear tell the cigars are to die for. There's plenty of death in Miami Vice
 as well, predictably so, with double-crosses galore and a token appearance by the Russian mob and the Aryan Brotherhood, two criminal enterprises not known for their sartorial splashiness. Even former style avatars Crockett and Tubbs appear to be dressing down these days, trading in their goofy Eighties Italianate pastels for more somber hues worn with the deadly air of men on their way to a funeral, preferably their own. Miami Vice
's one saving grace, and it's a slim one indeed, comes from Mann's tried-and-true, ultra-choreographed ballistics ballets, including one deafening, third-act rain of cordite and lead that threatens to make you leave the theatre limping. And that's the good news. Perhaps vice isn't what it used to be, or maybe Crockett and Tubbs just aren't all that interesting when removed from their appropriate time slot, but this may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer.


With all respect to every other Hollywood movie I've seen this summer, ``Miami Vice" is the only one that totally seduced me. I have my standards, and Michael Mann's intense reupholstering of his classic 1980s TV show meets a lot of them. The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.
It's also seriously serious, not the usual result when television is amplified for the movies. ``Miami Vice" is not cult, camp, kitsch, trash, or cheese -- it's not ``Starsky & Hutch" or ``The Brady Bunch Movie." This muscular, point-blank plunge into the drug world is all business, which is not to say there is no pleasure. It abounds, starting with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, who play ``Sonny" Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, the Dade County detectives whom Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas made internationally famous.
Mann has made a career of fierce crime opuses, from 1981's ``Thief" through 2004's ``Collateral." For ``Miami Vice," he's boiled down the television show to its essential dynamics -- the cops versus the cartels -- while globally expanding the parameters of the drug trade.
It seems all anyone remembers now about the show is the menswear. Mann wants to remind us that it was never that shallow. ``Miami Vice" debuted on NBC in 1984, during the Reagan administration's heightened crackdown on drug trafficking, and the show, which Mann created with Anthony Yerkovich (a producer of the film), treated the drug war with a straight face, trying to strike a tasteful balance between a sense of fashion and a feeling of hopelessness. Part of striking that balance was Mann's unique skill at bringing a cinematic sensibility to TV.
The film junks the garish Armani and Versace for a crisper fashion statement: the reflective high-definition digital camerawork by the great Dion Beebe that helped make ``Collateral" seem so unrelentingly dangerous. The movie also ups the show's violent ante. Now the war on drugs looks and sounds like actual war. And where the show took advantage of the Florida sunlight, this film is exquisitely nocturnal. Most of the story unfolds beneath blood-orange dusks and inky skies.
This ``Miami Vice" feels as impressionistically achy as Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line" or ``The New World," or ``Ali," Mann's tremendous kaleidoscope of black America, as framed through a decade of Muhammad Ali's career. Character detail and precise circumstances become elements of the loaded atmosphere. There is no foreground. This is to say that ``Miami Vice" is a serene mood picture as much as it is an action flick.
Mann dispenses with giving hairy Crockett and smooth Tubbs back stories (so the source of Farrell's nutty accent remains a mystery) or many real moments of psychological illumination. These two are their jobs. And in this movie, their day at the office involves going deep undercover to infiltrate an ostensibly Latin American trafficking syndicate with vast international reach. It's hooked up with a vicious white supremacist outfit and has a bold Chinese-Cuban chief financial officer, Isabella (Gong Li), who catches Crockett's eye.
She's already attached to the overlord (Luis Tosar ) running this operation. But there is no love or, for that matter, sex in their arrangement. He makes the money, she launders it. Thank goodness Crockett is on hand to show her what she's missing. They speedboat to Havana for mojitos then merengue vertically and, later, horizontally.
The plot particulars will probably delight the MBAs and heroin czars in the audience. Sadly, I'm neither and found myself adrift on several occasions, trying to figure out the cop argot and dealer jargon, not to mention all the indecipherable accents. But I am able to understand that Gong Li and Colin Farrell are two of the sexiest creatures around.
Because Mann is so good at sculpting shootouts and writing lyrical mano- a- mano exchanges, it's easy to forget how knock-kneed his love scenes can leave you. The encounters between Madeleine Stowe and Daniel Day-Lewis in ``The Last of the Mohicans," for instance, were a hot bonus to all the combat. One of my favorite Mann moments is when Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith, playing two attracted strangers, head toward the dawn together at the end of ``Collateral." The end of that movie, in so many ways, felt like an absolute beginning.
In ``Miami Vice," the tie between Crockett and Isabella soon tangles into something more ``Casablanca"-like. At some point, Tubbs is forced to say to Crockett, ``She could be a white-collar money manger. She could be true love. But she's with them." Foxx makes that line sound more profound than it probably is. He graces this movie with a philosophical serenity that the series never had.
Watching him I thought a lot about the peeved arias Al Pacino delivered in Mann's ``Heat" and how Foxx is required to do similar barking. But there is humid jazz in his approach that enhances the film's tranquil tone.
In fact, a lot of ``Miami Vice" is sweaty with atmosphere. For every moment of chaos, there are two of calm. The lush South American vistas and sight of cigarette boats zooming along the sea produce a soothing effect; and the sight of Foxx falling asleep, post-coitally, on Naomie Harris, who plays Tubbs's steely girlfriend and fellow cop, is incredibly romantic. As mood maintenance, the soundtrack is uncommonly good, stretching from Patti LaBelle (with Moby ) to Audioslave , a band whose heavy rock dirges prove to be as convincing baby-making music as Luther Vandross's.
Yet the film isn't the panoramic opera of cops, robbers, and their women that ``Heat" was. If the global stakes are higher here, they're less dramatic, too. You wish Mann had come up with more to do for the gallery of great supporting players, which include Barry Shabaka Henley as Lieutenant Castillo, Ciaran Hinds as a craven FBI agent, John Ortiz as a splashy Colombian kingpin, and Elizabeth Rodriguez as the police sharpshooter with the best line in the whole film.
Only in the brutal finale do the characters and the implications of the story's undercover operation come out of the procedural blur, as the backstabbing, fury, doubt, and fear start to wreak their havoc. Those white supremacists return, hell breaks loose, and the suspenseful mayhem leaves a bruise. That kind of visceral authenticity is one of Mann's purest strengths as an artist. Whether you come to this movie for the shootouts or the sex, bring protection.


         From "Thief," his first theatrical feature, through "Heat" and 2004's "Collateral," filmmaker Michael Mann has always felt the attraction of the hard, cold criminal world, where the night is alive with menace and the day is not far behind.
 
  Now, with "Miami Vice," writer-director Mann both returns to the scene of a previous crime (he was executive producer of the emblematic 1980s TV series) and tries to push things further. A consummate filmmaker on a never-ending quest for increased intensity, ever-more tangible realism and heightened style, he is determined to take Miami cops Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs along with him on that particular ride.
 


         






    But just as Crockett and Tubbs, here going deep undercover to infiltrate the mother of all drug cartels, find themselves possibly getting in over their heads, writer-director Mann faces a similar danger. While the moviemaking in "Miami Vice" is impeccable as always, its story finally turns out to be too flimsy a reed to support all of the weight put on it.
 
  It is the filmmaking we notice first as the film opens in a hot and hedonistic Miami nightclub (is there any other kind?) as Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and their crack law enforcement team prepare to take somebody down for unspecified nefarious activities.
 
  Crockett goes onto the club's roof to get better cellphone reception and the screen suddenly opens up to a dazzling view of the Miami skyline that turns out to be typical of the film's visual resources.
 
  Working once again (as he did in "Collateral") with cinematographer Dion Beebe and razor-sharp high-definition digital video, Mann has seen to it that every image we see is thought out and then thought out again. If an airplane flies past a cloud, it's the cloud of a lifetime; if a drug dealer has an out-of-the-way hideaway, it's near Brazil's spectacular Iguaçu Falls. Nothing is casual, nothing is done without yielding maximum visual effect.
 
  After the look, the next thing we notice about "Miami Vice" is the endless supply of attitude. Everyone in the movie, especially Crockett and Tubbs, is way past mythic, way past cool. If lean, hard, macho looks could kill, there would be a lot more corpses strewn around than there already are.
 
  Deputized by their boss Lt. Castillo (Barry Shabaka Henley) and FBI Special Agent Fujima (Ciaran Hinds) to find out how the drug lords know what they know, Crockett and Tubbs go into their undercover dance.
 
  Acting tough and saying things like "If they didn't do time with us, they can't do crime with us" mightily impresses the bad guys, and Crockett and Tubbs get a meeting with Mr. Big, José Yero (an evilly magnetic John Ortiz), only to find that there is a Mr. Bigger named Montoya (dead-eyed Spanish actor Luis Tosar) who also must be won over. The deeper the boys go, with the danger and the adrenaline spiking ever higher, the harder it is for them to remember what they are trying to accomplish.
 
  Clearly Mann did a formidable amount of research into the habits of undercover agents and drug smugglers alike, and the film goes to the far corners of South America, including Ciudad del Este at the intersection of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, in its search for authenticity.
 
  But while "Miami Vice" utilizes every high-tech toy in the business, including some nifty looking boats and airplanes, it also is so into its own myth and the posturings of its jargon-using characters that civilians may have occasional difficulty figuring out what people are saying and even what is going on.
 
  Part of the fun of a film like "Miami Vice," obviously, is watching our heroes be too cool for school, but there can be too much of a good thing. This attitude is pervasive enough to feel repetitive, plus it acts as a mask that hampers the protagonists from acting in any other key and gets in the way of the audience forming an attachment to them.
 
  Foxx's Tubbs, introduced with a steady girlfriend named Trudi (British actress Naomie Harris), does a better job of finding the person inside the character, but the script has him disappear for a stretch as "Miami Vice" gives considerable time to the developing romance between Crockett and Isabella (Chinese star Gong Li), a ruthless cartel financial officer. It is not a match made in cinematic heaven.
 
  As hard as she is beautiful, and she is very beautiful, Gong Li's Isabella is such a convincing Dragon Lady that we are not convinced when she starts to warm up. A relationship with the similarly self-involved Crockett may be mandated by the script, but both characters are too in love with themselves to make their pairing as believable as it has to be for "Miami Vice" to have its way with us.
 
  "Miami Vice" turns out to be not so much a reworking of the TV show as an old-fashioned B with an A-plus budget. This could be a good thing, and sometimes, as in some of the film's crackerjack action set pieces, it is. But without the ability to move off the mythic, without the emotional texture that "Heat" created, it is a film easier to admire than to get passionately involved with.

When Miami Vice  was big in the '80s, like other fans I got off on the stylishly decadent trappings, the pastel rock & roll machismo coolness  the  T-shirts worn under silk jackets, the roiling synthesizer music and white-on-white coral deco mansions, the way that Don Johnson, with his dimples and jaded nobility and celebrated stubble (I will always be grateful to him for making it possible to work in an office and shave only every other day), would stare into the mug of some two-bit informer and threaten him with a sarcastic ''Pal!'' Miami Vice  was famously pitched as ''MTV cops,'' but it was always better than that; if anything, the show was MTV noir. It was exciting, if not revolutionary in a years-before-HBO-did-it sort of way, to see a network crime series in which a sequence could be scored to Iggy Pop's ''Real Wild Child (Wild One),'' and that was only the come-on, the luscious frosting. Each week, the show's executive producer and central creative force, Michael Mann, oversaw a procedural thriller of arresting tricky density, in which Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, going up against a parade of Latino cocaine merchants (at the time, a relative novelty in pop culture), became, in effect, playactors in their own mini drug war.
Miami Vice , the movie, doesn't have a single pastel, and there's not a lot of rock & roll either. Shot with digital cameras in a deliberately anti-glamorous, off-center style, the movie unfolds in a dark and whispery technocratic netherworld where the languid sensual beauty of Miami is a distant memory. Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are now so enmeshed in the danger of their jobs that they've passed beyond cool into a kind of terse minimalism. Their speech is peppered with jargony code like op sec and intel and go-fast boats (the mood is so hushy-serious that I had to stop for a moment to realize that that meantâ€¦boats that go fast), and even when they infiltrate a Colombian cocaine network, its ruling thug remains a step ahead of their deceptions. Mann seizes the audience, all right  he makes us avid to know what's coming next  but he does it in such a cryptic, joyless way that we're scratching our heads even when the film holds us in its grip.
The movie opens in a disco, as Farrell's Crockett, beefy and haunted (or is it just blank?), his long hair swept back, orders a drink from a bartender he's too preoccupied to flirt with. As the scene unfolds, it grows murkier by the minute. What emerges is that a random informer's cover has been blown, probably by a mole within the FBI; Crockett and Tubbs then go undercover to flush out the mole. No one is more virtuoso than Mann at setting up a scene in which the cops, posing as seen-it-all drug buyers, win over a skeptical middleman by out-badassing him. What's changed is that with the globalization of drug traffic, the dealers now have the technology to expose all but the most in-deep impostors, and there's so much money at stake, and so many walls to penetrate, that even after Crockett and Tubbs have conned their way in, they hardly know where they're reaching. A maze closes around them.
For a while, Miami Vice  is like a cocaine thriller staged by early-'70s Costa-Gavras. Then Crockett meets Isabella (Gong Li), the dealer's financial right hand, and takes her on a boat ride in search of the perfect mojito. They fall into bed, and passionately, yet it's hard not to suppress a giggle at this turn, since even though it's vintage old-school Sonny Crockett, the sudden intrusion of l'amour fou  doesn't mesh with the nearly bureaucratically solemn Miami Vice  we've been watching. Gong Li, once you get past her awkward English, has a dragon-lady severity that strikes sparks with  Farrell's slithery sexiness, but the romance throws the movie off. Crockett never even uses it to get to Isabella's boss, Arcángel de Jesäs Montoya (Luis Tosar), who hovers so far over the action that his threat remains a bit too far out of reach.
Mann wants to establish a mood of mod futility. He stages a spectacular showdown in a scuzzy trailer, with our heroes facing white supremacists who are holding Tubbs' lover hostage, but it's never clear why these goons needed to kidnap her in the first place. Foxx does his best acting in the aftermath of this sequence, but mostly his performance is held hostage by Mann's dire minimalism.
I got the feeling that Mann remains embarrassed by the '80s-cheese, fashion-plate showiness of his beloved series, and that he was determined not to fall back into it. His movie, as entertaining as some of it is, is so cool that it's almost too cool. It takes the sin, and much of the juice, out of vice.

 IF there is a lesson to be extracted from the visual glories of “Miami Vice” — the painterly compositions of tropical sea and sky, the glowing, throbbing nightclub set pieces, the meticulously choreographed deployments of lethal force — it might be that love and work don’t mix. Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx), the South Florida municipal employees whose labors preoccupy this movie (as they did its predecessor television series two decades ago), have pretty complicated jobs to begin with.  They impersonate highly skilled, business-minded drug couriers in the interests of bringing down far-reaching criminal enterprises, which means that they must be adept at handling fast boats, suitcases full of cash, small planes and large guns. Their private lives don’t take them far from the job. In his spare time Tubbs keeps company with a vice squad co-worker (Naomie Harris), while Crockett pursues a reckless affair with a drug kingpin’s wife and business associate (Gong Li), and these entanglements give the undercover work an extra jolt of intensity. By the time the final showdown with the bad guys comes around, Crockett and Tubbs have long since crossed the line that divides the professional from the personal.  But in the world of Michael Mann — a guiding creative force behind the small-screen “Miami Vice” and the writer and director of this movie version — no such line really exists. Whatever their particular jobs, his major characters tend to be men whose commitment to their professions transcends mere workaholism and becomes an all-consuming, almost operatic passion.  These men might be television producers or paid assassins, boxers or cabdrivers, cops or robbers or frontiersmen, and they might relate to one another as partners, antagonists or uneasy allies, but they all seem to share this essential trait. It is impossible to separate who they are from what they do. Crockett and Tubbs are not in it for the pension plan or the dental coverage, not for the planes and the boats and the cool sunglasses, not even for the righteous thrill of fighting crime. Their devotion to their work is irrational, risky, extravagant: you might even say crazy. They insist on doing it their own way, tolerating no interference from, for instance, some pencil-pushing F.B.I. suit (Ciaran Hinds).  In other words, they’re a lot like the detectives played by William L. Petersen in “Manhunter” and Al Pacino in “Heat,” or like Tom Cruise’s hit man in “Collateral,” to name just a few. Which is also to say that, like most of Mr. Mann’s men, they betray a telling resemblance to the man himself. Never one for compromise or restraint, this filmmaker throws himself into every frame, turning genre movies into feverish spectacles of style and feeling.  With “Miami Vice” he clearly had money to burn, and the flames are beautiful to behold. Mixing pop savvy with startling formal ambition, Mr. Mann transforms what is essentially a long, fairly predictable cop-show episode into a dazzling (and sometimes daft) Wagnerian spectacle. He fuses music, pulsating color and high drama into something that is occasionally nonsensical and frequently sublime. “Miami Vice” is an action picture for people who dig experimental art films, and vice versa.  I’m not exaggerating about the art. Some of the most captivating sequences have an abstract quality, as if Mr. Mann were paying homage to the avant-garde, anti-narrative cinema of Stan Brakhage in the midst of a big studio production. Dispensing with the convention that the pictures exist to serve the story, Mr. Mann frequently uses plot as an excuse to construct ravishing pictures.  The camera, with leisurely, voluptuous sensuality, ranges from crowded cities to the open sea, from billowy thunderheads to the rippling muscles on Mr. Foxx’s back. Like “Collateral,” “Miami Vice” was shot in high-definition digital video, which Mr. Mann, in collaboration with the brilliant cinematographer Dion Beebe, treats not as a convenient substitute for film but as a medium with its own aesthetic properties and visual possibilities. The depth of focus, the intensity of colors, and the grainy, smudged finish of some of the images combine to create a look that is both vividly naturalistic and almost dreamlike.  Not that the narrative makes too many concessions to realism, apart from the occasional swatch of untranslated law-enforcement jargon (“Our op-sec has been compromised”) and the rumpled, workaday presence of the wonderful Barry Shabaka Henley as Lieutenant Castillo, the down-to-earth commanding officer played on television by Edward James Olmos.  There is a basic setup involving white-supremacist methamphetamine dealers that is a red herring and the foreshadowing of a later surprise, but before too long we’re in the familiar world of heartless Latin American drug lords (in this case a retiring fellow played by Luis Tosar) and their sadistic minions (John Ortiz, looking like an especially disgruntled graduate student). The case requires elaborate cover, buckets of money and the finest, fastest air and sea vessels the taxpayers of Miami can afford. Not really, of course. The actual operating budget for the Miami police department in fiscal year 2005 was around $100 million, a good $50 million less than the reported production costs of “Miami Vice.”    The action jumps from Paraguay to Haiti, from Colombia to Cuba (impersonated, as usual, by the Dominican Republic), where Crockett and his lady friend drop in for cocktails one evening after work. The movie’s swirl of danger, glamour and professionalism expands the central conceit of the series, which was to imagine a pair of urban cops who looked, dressed and acted like movie stars.  After the show became a hit, real movie stars would occasionally swing by for a visit. Still, the old Crockett and Tubbs, played by Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, carried a lot of baggage onto the set: divorces, dead partners, Vietnam, the N.Y.P.D. Their new, improved selves, by contrast, travel light and sleek, with no back stories to burden the picture with exposition. Except for something about Crockett’s daddy and the Allman Brothers, which explains Mr. Farrell’s mustache, if not his peculiar accent.  When the show made its debut in 1984, Mr. Johnson was a has-been — or never-quite-was — movie star, which helped give his character a grizzled, disappointed element of soulfulness. In the movie version, though, only real movie stars, who command attention simply by allowing the camera to behold them, will do. Mr. Foxx, sly, taciturn and effortlessly charismatic, certainly fulfills the requirement, as does Ms. Gong, a goddess of global cinema whose every word you hang on even when you can’t understand a single one. If there is any justice in the world, Ms. Harris (who can also be seen this summer in “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest”) will join their ranks before long.  Mr. Farrell, however, is a movie star only in the sense that Richard Gephardt is president of the United States. He’s always looked good on paper, and he’s picked up some endorsements along the way — from Oliver Stone, Joel Schumacher and Terrence Malick, among others —  but somehow it has never quite happened. Here he squints and twitches to suggest emotion and slackens his lower lip to suggest lust, concern or deep contemplation, but despite his good looks he lacks that mysterious quality we call presence.  Mr. Mann’s script has its share of silly, overwrought lines, but they only really sound that way in Mr. Farrell’s mouth. (Did he really say, “I’m a fiend for mojitos”? ¡Dios mío!) When he’s not on screen, you don’t miss him, and when he is, you find yourself, before long, looking at someone or something else. Gong Li. A boat. A lightning bolt illuminating the humid summer sky.  Yet the flaws in “Miami Vice” are in the end part of its pulpy grandeur. It is in some ways an entirely gratuitous movie: the influence of the original series can be seen in any number of big car-chase-and-fireball crime thrillers, from “Bad Boys” to “Bad Boys II.” There isn’t much to add. But the irrelevance of this project makes Mr. Mann’s quixotic devotion to it seem perversely heroic. This was not a job that anyone needed to do, but then again no one could have done it better.  “Miami Vice” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has heavy swearing, heavy breathing and heavy gunplay.

"MTV cops" was the note scribbled by the late NBC exec Brandon Tartikoff that famously inspired "Miami Vice," and while the music and color palette have changed (black, it seems, is the new pastel), writer-director Michael Mann has refreshingly revived the series largely intact. Unlike most TV-to-movie transitions, Mann returns to his roots and delivers what amounts to a slightly overblown episode, brimming with style and characteristically short on substance. As such, pic doesn't feel dated, but the question lingers whether young guys who were infants when the show expired in '89 will queue up for the ride.
Using the grainy night-lensing techniques he brought to "Collateral" -- and reunited with that film's co-star, Jamie Foxx, as well as cinematographer Dion Beebe -- Mann's handsome adaptation eschews the campy spoofs and thinly veiled disdain for the source material (think "Starsky & Hutch" and "Charlie's Angels") that have plagued TV-based movies; instead, "Vice" revels in the creative latitude that an R-rated feature provides without departing from the show's rudimentary structure.
That, of course, is for good and ill, since the series was hardly known for its mellifluous language or complicated themes. As it is, half the dialogue here sounds garbled, with Colin Farrell (as Sonny Crockett) not so much speaking his lines as consistently snarling them, in a manner that makes Don Johnson's initial take seem positively effusive.
Crockett and Tubbs (Foxx) are again undercover Miami cops, yanked into a botched FBI operation that has resulted in the death of a key informant. The dense (and mostly opaque) web of villainy includes a white supremacist group and a Colombian drug lord, Montoya (Luis Tosar), who is as ruthless as he is wealthy, calling the shots while sequestered in a jungle hideaway.
In short order, Crockett and Tubbs have wormed their way deep into the smuggling operation, riding super-fast boats to ferry illicit contraband into South Florida for Montoya's henchman Jose (John Ortiz). With similar speed, Crockett becomes entangled with one of the cartel's leaders, Isabella (Gong Li), both complicating matters and concerning his partner.
There's not much more to it, but Mann -- the executive producer on the series -- fills out the story with lingering sensuality (including not one, but two coed shower sequences) and terse but rousing bursts of action. The latter is highlighted by a hostage standoff that nicely shows off other members of their undercover unit, who are otherwise mostly mute throughout the film.
Foxx is the most conspicuously handcuffed by the no-nonsense attitude, though other solid supporting players -- including "Munich's" Ciaran Hinds as the FBI liaison and Barry Shabaka Henley as Lt. Castillo -- have precious little to do as well.
Gong, meanwhile, despite appearing to struggle with some of her dialogue, brings welcome vulnerability to the role of Isabella, which is about as much humanity as Mann cares to explore. Beyond that, it's all about gliding through a world of beachfront property, dense jungle lairs (in addition to Florida, filming took place in Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Brazil), darkened clubs and the constant threat of exposure.
Cinematically, it's territory Mann knows well -- from "Thief" early in his career to "Heat" to the more recent TV series "R.H.D./LA" -- and that mastery of brooding atmosphere buoys what would otherwise be an utterly by-the-numbers crime drama.
The only notable omission, in fact, is Jan Hammer's jaunty score from the original series (John Murphy does the honors), though song selections such as Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" help rekindle some '80s feeling.

Michael Mann 's Miami Vice  is like a car that's been stripped of everything but its two bucket seats and rebuilt from the ground up. The protagonists are a pair of detectives named Sonny Crockett  (Colin Farrell ) and Ricardo Tubbs  (Jamie Foxx ) and a cover of Phil Collins 's "In the Air Tonight" finds its way onto the soundtrack, but so little else about the film evokes the 198489 television series that the title seems almost perverse. About half the movie doesn't even take place in Miami, and even there the turquoise waters and white sandy beaches look muddy and gray under cover of night. In a career marked by an obsession with the intricacies of law enforcement and criminal activity, this may be Mann's most brutally efficient policier yet: The characters scarcely have personalities; they are nearly soulless nocturnal warriors. But watching them go about their deadly serious business nevertheless puts you in a state of high anxiety.
The plot of Miami Vice  (very  loosely based on the episode "Smuggler's Blues" from the series' first season) is tangled, and it moves as quickly as a speedboat, hopscotching among Miami, Paraguay , and Cuba. It begins with an interagency sting operation gone awry: Two federal agents and the family of a supposedly protected informant (an excellent, desperate John Hawkes ) are dead. Somewhere within the FBI  or DEA  or ATF, there is a security leak, and it falls to Crockett and Tubbs to ferret it out. So they will infiltrate the network of a mid-level drug trafficker called Jose Yero  (John Ortiz ) by posing as transporters willing and able to ferry Yero's product from South America  into south Florida. Then having done that, they will move even deeper, until they are enjoying a private audience with the enigmatic kingpin Montoya (played with chilly conviction by Spanish actor Luis Tosar).
The layers of deception, and the ways in which Farrell and Foxx riff off each other, are dazzlingly elaborate: Meeting Yero for the first time, Crockett and Tubbs accuse him  of wearing a wire; later, they will "give" Yero back a load of stolen product that they themselves stole, in turn further ingratiating themselves into his operation. In such moments, one is reminded that few have put this world of cops and crooks on-screen with greater verisimilitude than Mann. His characters talk the lingo and move with the assured physicality of a soldier on the battlefield. When someone fires a gun in a Michael Mann movie, or cracks a safe, or negotiates the terms of a drug deal, you do not question it.
None of that description will quite prepare you for the visceral impact of Vice the way each round of the characters' high-powered weaponry lands with unnerving force under the shimmering pitch blacks and pearl grays of Dion Beebe 's HD videography. (No director since Peckinpah has staged more repellently beautiful orgies of on-screen carnage than Mann.) But as is often the case in Mann's films, there is also a romance, which rears its head at the worst possible time. Here it appears in the form of the Chinese Cuban Isabella (Gong Li , speaking far more convincing English than in Memoirs of a Geisha ), who's Montoya's money manager as well as his moll, though that doesn't stop Crockett from falling hard and fast for her confident charms. She, too, recognizes something in hima fellow lost soul. And midway through, there is a ravishing sequenceone that single-handedly restores mature adult sexuality to Hollywood  moviesin which they abscond to Cuba together to begin their affair that cannot be, amid the ramparts of a place that once was.
Mann has done something transformative with Farrell: The Irish actor has never had this much charisma and natural authority in a role, and as he navigates that gray area between Crockett's real identity and his fabricated one, revealing subtle fissures in the character's cocksure facade, he's fascinating to watch.
