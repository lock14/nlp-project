'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," sure. But also the mysteries of literary adaptation. Michael Chabon's earnest first novel from 1988 about a young man's bisexual coming of age is now what could pass for a flavorless pilot for the CW. Almost nothing works in this movie, which was written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose previous film, the antic "Dodgeball," would be a hundred times more preferable come prep-school movie night.
Like many young people, Thurber appears to have fallen in love with Chabon's book (its finest moments perfectly capture the thwack of attraction). Unlike those other readers, Thurber got the book's rights and proceeded to conflate and excise characters and scenarios until only the most generic possible movie remained.
We still have the story of Art Bechstein (Jon Foster), a recent college graduate, studying one summer for his Series 7 stockbroker exam (the movie is set in the mid-1980s), dating the manager of the bookstore where he works (Mena Suvari), and trying to please his father, a gangster played by Nick Nolte. Sadly, Art seems a passive observer of his life. This could be a matter of Foster's mild approach to acting. It's as if Thurber decided to scour the nation's top lacrosse teams for a lead. It could be the fact that the film relies so heavily on poor Foster to recite large paragraphs of Chabon's manuscript. The scenes feel plunked down between narration, so no true rhythm can get going. Really, Foster just isn't very interesting to watch.
Of course, under the circumstances, neither are Peter Sarsgaard and Sienna Miller, who speed into the proceedings as Cleveland, a mid-level thug in a leather jacket, and his girlfriend, Jane. These two rope Art into their ho-hum adventures (drinking, leaping into pools, sitting around). But why should we care about anybody who chooses to spend the livelong day with Art? At some point it's clear that Cleveland likes Art in a way that has nothing to do with Jane. The consummation of their attraction occupies the film's second half, and gives the movie its only shot at honesty, although their interest in each other makes no sense. It's like Richie Cunningham making love to The Fonz. In the novel, Art fell for a different, more convincing man. The movie gives us a bad fantasy. It's conceivable that you could leave this movie thinking it had been adapted from a teenage boy's diary.
Thurber is clearly taken with these people, but he lacks the imagination to pass his enthusiasm on to us. Frolicking montages set to Ryan Adams and Iron & Wine tell us more about the contents of Thurber's iPod than about the inner lives of his characters. For what it's worth, "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" follows "The Great Buck Howard" and "Adventureland" as another wishy-washy portrait of a kid wandering across adulthood's threshold. None of these movies incorporates a kind of rearview wisdom or successfully re-creates any oscillation between the electricity and doldrums of youth. Our heroes insist these are the times that will define them, but the movies themselves are dull and interchangeably vague.

The paradox of a truly atrocious literary adaptation is that everything on screen  a crummy postcollegiate job, a love triangle, even a  burglary  must be embedded with little wisps of higher ''meaning,'' and therefore ends up meaning nothing at all. In The Mysteries of Pittsburgh , a stillborn rendering of Michael Chabon's first novel, Jon Foster plays Art Bechstein, the son of a Jewish gangster (Nick Nolte), but he comes off as the dullest of WASP preppies. His fascination with a young couple  heartfelt Jane (Sienna Miller) and her pretentious, chopper-riding, bisexual boyfriend Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard)   plays like Gossip Girl  written by a bad F. Scott Fitzgerald imitator.

 If, after Greg Mottola’s charming “Adventureland,” which opened last week, you find yourself in the mood for another tale of a recent college graduate’s coming of age in Pittsburgh one crazy summer in the 1980s, you may be in luck. Or not, since even the most passionate fan of Pittsburgh-in-the-’80s-crazy-summer-coming-of-age stories is likely to be disappointed by “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,” a clumsy and confused adaptation of Michael Chabon’s 1988 novel.  That Rawson Michael Thurber, who directed and wrote the screenplay, was motivated by sincere affection for Mr. Chabon’s book is evident in his scrupulous attempt to capture the novel’s delicate tone, which is poised between whimsy and heartbreak. A certain amount of the author’s prose has been transferred directly into the movie in the form of voice-over narration, which turns the main character’s wry naïveté into glum and redundant pretension. His name is Art Bechstein, and he is played by Jon Foster, who is attractive and well behaved but, at least in the absence of strong direction, a fairly inert screen presence.  Art’s story meanders from one fraught incident to another without much resonance or momentum. His father, played with gruff efficiency by Nick Nolte, is a local gangster who is urging his son toward a respectable career as a stockbroker. While he studies for the Series 7 exam, Art works in a discount bookstore and carries on an affair with his supervisor, Phlox (Mena Suvari), who never rises above the level of a moderately misogynist, blatantly snobbish caricature. Art is distracted by the ravishing Jane (Sienna Miller) and her volatile, bisexual boyfriend, Cleveland. (“Like the state?” Phlox asks, just so we know that she’s too dumb for our sympathy.)  Played by Peter Sarsgaard, Cleveland is a potentially interesting character, and both Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Miller do their best (though just what accent Ms. Miller is attempting is hard to guess) to push beyond the film’s hazy, romantic view — shared with the book — of who they are. Mr. Thurber’s suave camera movements, the slightly weary natural beauty of Pittsburgh and a piquant score (by Theodore Shapiro) provide the impression of a style, but the absence of any credible emotion beyond Art’s passive-aggressive anomie cripples the story before it begins.  When, at the end, the plot accelerates, and things start to look interestingly complicated, it’s too late. You’re left not with any feeling or insight, but rather with nothing much beyond the vague impression that Mr. Thurber, whose previous film was the Ben Stiller comedy “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,” is a big fan of Mr. Chabon’s “Mysteries of Pittsburgh.” Even viewers who share his admiration for the book may leave the theater wondering what he saw in it. 

A surefooted screen translation of Michael Chabon's beloved 1988 debut novel, "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" will likely irk diehard fans of the book, as helmer-adaptor Rawson Marshall Thurber takes considerable liberties and arrives at a more conventional general tone. Still, this engaging '80s flashback embroiling a hitherto vanilla protagonist with some wild characters during one heady summer has appeal for straight and gay twenty-to-fortysomething auds. It should prove capable of performing on the upper end of limited-release figures before decent sales on disc and cable.
Attractive, innocuous Art (Jon Foster) is worlds away from the widowed father with whom he has strained monthly dinners: Joe Bechstein (Nick Nolte), a New England mobster followed everywhere by FBI agents. Dad has arranged for his just-graduated son to start a job within "the family." To Art, that means "I've got three months to live" -- a normal life, that is, as opposed to the unpleasantly semi-criminal future mapped out for him.
Economics major Art has elected to stay in Pittsburgh -- at college -- to study for the exam required for U.S. broker-dealers, while he works for minimum wage among proles at the discount Book Barn. His days are enlivened, to coworkers' amusement, by manager Phlox (Mena Suvari) regularly paging him for sex in the store's stockroom, among other areas. Yet even this seemingly no-strings involvement begins to strike Art as just another obligation somebody else chose for him.
Things start to change when erstwhile freshman roommate Mohammed (Omid Abtahi) hauls Art to a party where he meets the beauteous Jane (Sienna Miller), an aspiring concert violinist. She's quick to point out she has a boyfriend -- yet invites Art out for latenight pie.
The next day, a motorcycle-helmeted figure shows up at the Book Barn and ominously insists Art join him for a "ride." The young man assumes this is tied to dad's gangland world, preparing for the worst. But the abductor turns out to be Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard), Jane's older b.f. He enjoys fooling Art into thinking he's due for a jealous beatdown, then simply sweeps the kid into the couple's manic-thrill-seeking lifestyle.
While undeniably attracted to Jane, Art is no less intrigued by the mercurial, charismatic, somewhat mysterious Cleveland, who has apparent underworld ties of his own and a very flexible sexual identity. The trio have some giddy times together (prompting hell-hath-no-fury response from the shut-out Phlox), punctuated by unexpected erotic tensions, the hetero couple's frequent fights, and, eventually, danger brought about by Cleveland's gambling debts. Art's attempt to fix the latter by begging help from dad triggers the tale's suspenseful final lap.
These "Mysteries" have been considerably rejiggered from book to film, eliminating key character Arthur Lecompte and, ergo, somewhat downplaying the bi/homosexual aspects of the book (though Art and Cleveland do end up in bed together). The full warmth and idiosyncrasy of Chabon's original is missed in an adaptation that feels more impersonally observed. But Lawson's pic, (with the director making a left turn from prior feature "Dodgeball," which he says was a money gig undertaken to hasten this dream project) is entertaining and involving enough on its own terms.
Foster comes off as a somewhat bland, preppie protag, too unlike his father for credence and an unlikely play-partner choice for his wild new friends -- but the book requires similar suspension of disbelief. Miller is OK, but the movie is sparked by Sarsgaard, who's seldom uninteresting but really gets a chance to burn on all cylinders. Nolte mixes paternal tough-love and genuine threat to sharp effect in his few scenes.
Location-shot pic has a handsome look that doesn't oversell the '80s trappings. Theodore Shapiro's rather routinely earnest score is supplanted by diverse soundtracked pop tunes.


After a history of preproduction false starts, Michael Chabon 's 1988 debut novel gets its promised widescreen adaptation by Dodgeball  helmer Rawson Marshall Thurber, providing fresh ammo for the "book is always better than the movie" crowd. Art Bechstein (Jon Foster ) has just finished college, paid for with laundered money from his mobbed-out old man (Nick Nolte , with a sticky dye job). Planning on a minimum of consequence and responsibility over the last summer before he's crushed by adulthood, Art's minimum-wage coasting is upended when he meets a turbulent couple: Jane (Sienna Miller ) and her breakneck bisexual boyfriend, Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard , usually sighing out the last two drags on a cigarette). Devotees of Chabon will find particular points on which to disdain Thurber's treatment—for the uninitiated, it's enough to feel the howling gulf between intention and what's actually on-screen. In lieu of any rapport between performers, Mysteries  relies on voiceover readings and an instructively soundtracked montage to articulate relationships, and these flimsy foundations blow away just when they should be a-quiver with the drama of criminal skullduggery and a ménage à trois tangle (the least compelling this side of Threesome). Mena Suvari , as Art's vindictive ex-fuckbuddy, gives sole signs of life—Miller is so void of presence that one can forget she's in the movie from scene to scene.
