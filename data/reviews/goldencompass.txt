Ain�t that just like the Christians to get their knickers in a knot over nothing? Did they really think that New Line Cinema (the producers of The Lord of the Rings
 film trilogy) would risk precious box-office returns and a cultural dust-up by preserving the anti-organized-religion bent of the source material, British children's author Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials
 trilogy? The Golden Compass
 trades in the novels' evil Magisterium � a society-controlling organization meant to stand in for the church (any church, really) � as something just as evil but more SS-inspired (from swastikalike imagery down to McBurney's greasy, Adolf combover). The film (and series at large), inspired in part by Milton's Paradise Lost
, charts the coming of age of Lyra Belacqua (Richards, a dirtied delight), a 12-year-old orphan living in a steampunk universe parallel to Oxford, England, whose fate � which has something to do with a holy, multiverse war yet to come � was long ago predicted by witches. Yup, it's that kind of world: witches, gyptians (seafaring gypsies), and, most delightfully, daemons, which are the animal manifestations of human souls. They walk and talk alongside their human counterparts and don't take definite shape until a child's adolescence, which means Lyra's daemon, Pan (voiced by Highmore), skips breathlessly from a fluttering winged thing to a cuddly cat. Not much in The Golden Compass
 is cuddly, though: This is a terrifying world in which trouble is visited regularly on small children and seemingly beneficent older ladies (like Kidman's Mrs. Coulter, slinking along like some Thirties screen goddess) would sooner serve your daemon to her daemon for dinner. Writer/director Weitz far exceeds here, in vision and ambition, the perfectly passable entertainments of American Pie
 and About a Boy
. The special effects, with few notable dull thuds, are mostly spectacular, culminating in a breathtaking and bloodied battle royal between ice bears. There are significant stretches of talky tedium, more than a few �huh� moments for neophytes � especially whenever anyone starts nattering on about Dust with a capital "D" � and the ending plays abruptly, but there�s plenty here to hang a franchise on.


In the alternative Earth of "The Golden Compass," every human is born with a "daemon," a shape-shifting animal companion that's a cross between a witch's familiar, a Beanie Bear, and an outward manifestation of the soul. This is a rich concept, if fairly nuts, and for an author like Philip Pullman, on whose 1995 novel the movie is based, it's an excuse for grand adventures in metaphysics. For a Hollywood filmmaker like Chris Weitz, it's merely the occasion for computer animation above and beyond the call of duty.
As a recent convert to the book, let me be the first to say the trade-off's perfectly acceptable. I'm not sure those who haven't read it will be able to say the same.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. "The Golden Compass" is the latest blockbuster fantasy adaptation - a wannabe "Lord of the Rings," this year's "Chronicles of Narnia" - and it rises to that high-stakes challenge while spinning a weirder and darker tale than its predecessors. The movie's chief flaw, in fact, stems from what it does right: "Compass" visualizes the book's vast world with such rapturous imagination that you want to spend much more time in it than the filmmakers allow. At under two hours, the movie feels rushed; at points we're asked to bolt down three servings of plot before being hustled on to the next spine-tingling wonder.
And there's a lot of plot. The time period is a steampunk mix of the 19th and 20th centuries, and society is controlled by the Magisterium, an all-encompassing theocracy in which the planet is one immense, humorless diocese. (Some devout Christians in our own reality want you to boycott "The Golden Compass" as an atheist tract not fit for the children, but the book's less anti-God than anti-dogma and anti-state religion, and the movie further fudges the matter into all-purpose anti-fascism. Be careful, though: It's definitely on the side of free thought.)
Our heroine is Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), an 11-year-old orphan living among the scholars and scullery maids of Jordan College. If you've consulted your Joseph Campbell playbook, you know that Lyra is the sort of foundling Of Whom Great Things Are Expected, and she's soon caught up in the dangerous business of the Dust. What's the Dust? Damned if I know, and I've read the book. But it's pouring out of the Arctic sky through a hole connected to an alternate dimension - maybe even our own - and in the faith-shaking bureaucratic panic that ensues, children start to go missing.
Not the ones that anyone but their parents would notice: children of roving Gyptians, kitchen boys like Lyra's pal Roger (Ben Walker). A shadowy band of rogues called the Gobblers is whisking them away - but to what? Lyra intends to find out.
First she and her daemon Pantalaimon (voiced in his various furry guises by Freddie Highmore) have to contend with the glamorous Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) and her golden monkey, the latter apparently descended from the Winged Monkeys in "The Wizard of Oz" and twice as creepy. Mrs. C. is one of those sweet-voiced fashion plates who's diseased to the marrow, and Kidman implies the harpies shrieking in her skull with a glacial, Botoxed smile. Whatever this woman's doing for the Magisterium, you don't want to be invited along.
"The Golden Compass" keeps piling it on - shipboard journeys with Gyptians and visits from gorgeous witches (Eva Green), frozen battles in the Far North, and laboratories where hideous things are contemplated and acted upon. (Is this for the kids, by the way? Not the littles, but hardy souls of 9 and up should be pleasurably spooked.) Daniel Craig skitters down icebergs as Lyra's manly Uncle Asriel, and Sam Elliott thaws the film out as a drawling Texas balloonist with a jackrabbit for a daemon (voiced by Kathy Bates, no less). And there are the bears, of course.
One bear in particular: His name is Iorek Byrnison and he's voiced by Ian McKellen with a couple of sub-woofers in the basement. In the scheme of "The Golden Compass," polar bears are intelligent and warlike, and instead of daemons they put their pride and soul into baroque suits of armor. Iorek is in exile when we meet him - boozy and useless, like Dean Martin in the opening scenes of "Rio Bravo" - but Lyra uses her alethiometer to force the issue of his stolen armor.
Wait, what's an alethiometer? It's the compass of the title, a gift from the Master of Jordan College that allows those able to read it to know things. Sort of like a GPS device for locating the truth. In the book, Lyra has a long apprenticeship before she masters the instrument, but here she's a dab hand in less than one scene. (Her fugue states when she consults the alethiometer are a cheap touch, too - dusty, swirling images that seem plucked from '80s schlock fantasies like "Legend.")
Prickly fans of Pullman's "His Dark Materials" trilogy, of which "The Golden Compass" is the first book, won't be happy with the way Weitz moves scenes around, gets rid of some characters, simplifies others. Less doctrinaire readers won't give a fig: The movie gets the book's eccentric spirit right, and the daemons are mostly marvelous (the CGI on the fringes of the action is less impressive). The climactic bear-fight is a thundering set piece indeed, and when it ends you realize with a shock that this movie has no interest in taking prisoners.
The book is, among other things, about politics - about how a child can grow into an understanding of the long game, of what to say and when not to say it. The movie's both less complicated and more hectic, an epic designed for a multiplex screen. Computer animation doesn't do shades of gray.
Still, "The Golden Compass" pulls you in, daft and alluring. Any adaptation of Pullman's fiction hinges on its Lyra, and in the first-timer Richards, Weitz has found someone worth following. Rangy and impetuous, with a sour, tilted mouth and big eyes that narrow with suspicion, Richards suggests the foul-mouthed street urchin and the future grande dame; she's not conventionally pretty, but she has beauties in her. Above all, she's whip-smart and curious - a real adventuress. She makes the "Narnia" kids look vaguely feeble.
The movie bats you about in good and bad ways, breaking free occasionally into the spectral awe we go to movies for, then screeching to a halt to download more exposition. At times you feel Weitz flipping the pages and dog-earing wildly, and that's a shame: This is a movie that needs to be lengthy and discursive, the better to duck into the back alleys of its invention. A visionary is required. This director isn't one.
Maybe next time. There had better be a next time, and not just because Weitz lops off the harsh final chapters of the book and ends the film with a whimper. With all its hesitations and half-measures, "The Golden Compass" kindled something this critic hasn't felt in years: a burning thirst to see the sequel.

Big, noisy, and fantastic yet curiously sodden, too, filled with talking animals, sparkly light showers, and vague hints of ''religious'' feeling that are never more than distant echoes, The Golden Compass  is a snowbound mystical-whizbang kiddie ride that hovers somewhere between the loopy and the lugubrious. You could argue that the movie does its job, since it keeps giving you things to gawk at. Look, a sky darkens as it fills up with witches! Look, a pair of polar bears engage in an Arctic smackdown worthy of the WWE! Look, it's Nicole Kidman  her creamy shoulders tensing, her eyebrows dancing with dark delight  acting hot enough to belong in an entirely different film!
Some of this qualifies as spectacle, but very little of it takes hold as organic wonder. Perhaps that's because writer-director Chris Weitz, adapting the first novel in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials  trilogy, has made a movie that flirts with theological solemnity yet fuzzes it out at the same time. The Golden Compass  is a chronicle of blarnia. The movie, like the trilogy, has already been attacked by the Catholic Church, which has accused Compass  of being an attack upon it . Yet the cleansing sternness of Pullman's vision has mostly been wiped away, leaving a film that knows what it's against (frowning white-haired conspiracists in fussy clerical suits) but never quite figures out a way to voice what it's for.
As the movie opens, we could be in a novel by Jules Verne. Lyra, 12 years old, is played by Dakota Blue Richards, who has the ringlets of a '60s Disney heroine and a lot of charming Irish pluck. Lyra is the ward of Jordan College, an Oxbridge-like institution that looks like something out of the 1890s  except that the surrounding city has a sci-fi celestial glow, full of contraptions like a nifty wooden blimp and street vehicles that whir with futuristic precision. It's also full of smarmy bad guys who belong to the Magisterium, an authoritarian star chamber with a dastardly plan.
Lyra, like all of her orphaned school chums, is accompanied by her ''daemon,'' a talking animal spirit-companion  hers is a cat  that shape-shifts into other animals, even as it remains a mischievous reflection of her own soul. It's no accident these creatures are referred to by a word that conjures devils: They are meant (at least, in Pullman's books) to suggest the potential for sin embedded in the life force. That's what the Magisterium wants to demolish. The organization has taken a passel of children, including Lyra's best friend (Ben Walker), to the frozen North for the purpose of separating them from their daemons, turning them into neuterized clones of goodness.
Do you see why the Catholic Church objected? In outline, The Golden Compass  is a protest against organized piety, yet the suggestive power of daemons, and also of the mystic substance known as ''Dust'' (no, the Magisterium isn't crazy about that one either), is just window dressing for a poky, one-dimensional rescue adventure. Lyra must first elude the clutches of the aristocratic Magisterium comrade Mrs. Coulter (Kidman), who traps her in her mansion. This part of the film has some brio, thanks mostly to Kidman's high-style villainy. Lyra, however, quickly escapes and ends up trekking to the North, where she meets a great big bunch of critters and characters.
They are not very enthralling, and neither is Lyra's odyssey. Ian McKellen voices Byrnison, an ''ice bear'' with a gruff, sad, scarred exterior and a heart of softest gold. The force of McKellen's voice could wake anyone up, as he alchemizes Byrnison's melancholy into triumphant anger, but I wish Lyra had a few quieter scenes with him. She's too busy banding with the Gyptians, a crew of tedious nomads, or with the sexy witch Serafina (the lustrous Eva Green, in too ill-defined a role), or with Sam Elliott as a roving Texas airman (say what?), the actor's overcooked-grits basso drawl more precious than ever. The titular compass, which allows Lyra to answer any question put to her by letting her mind drift through psychedelic sprinkles, should have been more central to the plot. It's a magical-mechanical MacGuffin.
Daniel Craig, in case you were wondering, is in the movie for about 10 minutes as Lyra's tweedy professorial uncle, who goes off to the North in search of Dust. (One presumes he'll have a larger role in the sequel.) And just what is Dust? To judge from the post-movie discussions I heard, those who have read the books will feel far more enlightened about it than those with little to go on but the occasional sprinkle of gold. That's the kind of movie The Golden Compass  is: a fantasy that leaves you chattering about particles.

 A fantastic bestiary inhabits “The Golden Compass,” prowling and flapping and slithering and fluttering. The animals, most of which are called daemons and are manifestations of the human soul, hover at the side of their people and near the story’s edge, where their coos and barks mix with the ambient clatter and clang. Every so often, an animal leaps forward, its fur raised in alarm, its feathers fanned in flight. And because these are no ordinary animals, they also offer words of comfort, advice, warning. In this otherworldly realm, humans have no dominion over these creatures, yet they are not merely equals, either. They are one.  This beastly attitude and the conception of the soul as being somehow separate from its corporeal vessel are, as far as I can tell, the most irreligious conceits in the movie adaptation of “The Golden Compass,” a novel that was first published in Britain as  “Northern Lights.”  Written by Philip Pullman, it quickly became a critical and commercial success for the most obvious of reasons: It’s a charming romp set in a parallel universe stuffed with magical creatures, spooky villains and mythopoetic conceits, and propelled by a young  orphan, Lyra Belacqua, who embarks on the hero’s journey with her shape-shifting daemon, Pantalaimon (Pan for short). The book has attracted voluble criticism for equally obvious reasons: Its army of darkness is a totalitarian institution called “the Church.”  That ecclesiastical entity is pretty much nowhere evident in the film, which otherwise hews as close to the original source as can be expected from a 114-minute, big-screen translation of a 400-or-so-page novel. Directed by the American Chris Weitz, who wrote the heavily condensed script, “The Golden Compass” has many of the virtues of a faithful screen adaptation and many of the predictable flaws. Agnostics and atheists may, for starters, regret the explicit absence of the Church (others may see lingering traces), but the movies have never been a particularly good pulpit for any gods other than those of cinema’s own creation. It’s a tradition that this film honors with a goddess of icy perfection played by the wickedly well-cast Nicole Kidman.  As Mrs. Coulter, an emissary of the reigning powers (known only as “the Magisterium” in the film), Ms. Kidman has rarely looked more beautifully and exotically alien. When she first appears, she pours across the screen like liquid gold, her body provocatively shifting inside a shimmering, form-fitting gown, her gilt-blond hair and alabaster skin all but glowing. She’s the film’s most spectacular special effect (her wonderfully vicious little daemon-monkey runs a close second), and for once, the smooth planes of her face, untroubled by visible lines, serve the character. This masklike countenance  helps hide Mrs. Coulter’s malignant designs from Lyra (the newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, spunky and serviceable), who, not long after the story lifts off, falls into her care through a series of complicated developments.  Mr. Weitz crams so many events, characters (computer-generated and otherwise), twists and turns, sumptuously appointed rooms and ethereally strange vistas into his film that he risks losing you in the whirl. It zips from the Gothic grandeur of Jordan College, the Oxford institution where Lyra has been raised and somewhat educated by her guardians (“Scholars”), to Mrs. Coulter’s swank London home, where the Art Deco touches bring to mind the dreamiest Astaire-and-Rogers cheek-to-cheek. Much like the neo-Victorian aristocrats in Neal Stephenson’s science-fiction novel “The Diamond Age,” the characters in “The Golden Compass” populate a world that resembles our own,  despite being also seductively foreign. In Lyra’s universe zeppelins putt-putt through a period twilight zone, evoking both a knowable past and a possible future.  Despite the pit stops and lovely clutter, some of it visibly influenced by David Lynch’s “Dune,” the story unwinds in fairly straightforward fashion. Lyra, using a nifty, compasslike device called an alethiometer, must face danger and destiny, along with some hard truths. Among the hardest and headiest are those involving her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), an adventurer who dashes in and out of her life accompanied by an elegant snow leopard for a daemon. Aided and abetted by assorted quirky types and acting legends (Tom Courtenay in person, Ian McKellen in voice), Lyra follows Lord Asriel to the snowy north, where further perils await, along with a creepy intrigue involving stolen children and hints that the book’s two sequels are ready for their big-screen close-ups.  The sequels are a welcome idea, if only because they might persuade Mr. Weitz and his team to take it slower next time. “The Golden Compass” is an honorable work and especially impressive, given the far smaller, more intimate scale of his last film as a director (with his brother, Paul), “About a Boy.”  But it’s hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace, which forces you to dash through the story like Lord Asriel.  Among other things, I would have liked to spend some quality time with Lyra’s friend and protector the warrior bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Mr. McKellen), a gorgeous creature whose ferocity is, alas, tempered by his resemblance to some familiar cuddly polar bears. It is, I discovered, hard to keep your mind off the concession stand when you are waiting for Iorek to offer Lyra a Coke.  “The Golden Compass” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some intense scenes involve children in danger and warfare between bears and humans.

Another holiday movie season, another fantastic mythological universe to contend with. This time, it's the world -- or multiple parallel worlds -- of Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" trilogy, the first installment of which is "The Golden Compass," or "Northern Lights" in its original 1995 British publication. New Line's bid for another "Lord of the Rings" bonanza kicks off with writer-director Chris Weitz's impressively rendered but oddly uninviting adventure about a chosen girl's momentous struggle against insidious forces that would extinguish free will. Visual splendor and scent of a franchise should lure considerable crowds, especially internationally, although it's doubtful "Compass" will find a B.O. path anywhere near "Narnia," much less Middle-earth.
A sensation in the U.K., although less so Stateside, Pullman's epic is grounded in a land very much like England, with an expedition to the arctic stretches of Norway. But the work more broadly concerns the war between a rational, scientific domain and the monolithic oppression exercised by the power-mad Magisterium, a hierarchical order intent upon claiming the souls of all children. It's this undisguised anti-religious theme that has numerous groups in a lather, but perhaps more of an issue for some auds will be the film's lack of exciting uplift and the almost unrelievedly nasty treatment of the young characters by a host of aggressively unpleasant elders.
Front and center is Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards), a 12-year-old orphan who has enjoyed the privilege of being raised at the august Jordan College. Brown-haired and with bit of a wild edge, Richards has an unusual presence for a tweeny leading lady, but certain questions immediately present themselves: If Lyra has spent her entire life in this rarefied academic environment, why does she, like her rough-and-tumble mates and best friend Roger (Ben Walker), speak with a sort of mild working-class accent and bad grammar? Although she's called an untamed rebel, her status within the institution and her connections with those around her are not well fixed at the outset.
To the horror of the Magisterium elite, Lyra's distinguished uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), has discovered evidence in the Arctic Circle of golden dust that might establish a mystical connection between the many imagined parallel worlds. Lyra also becomes the secret recipient of the last remaining Alethiometer, or Golden Compass, a device that can provide the true answer to any question.
When Roger vanishes, Lyra jumps at the chance to go north, where abducted kids have purportedly been taken, with the shimmering Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), whose overly solicitous manner with Lyra masks an unfriendly agenda. Off they fly, above a fanciful London aboard an even more fanciful flying ship that resembles a combination of a Zeppelin and Captain Nemo's Nautilus.
A distinguishing feature of Pullman's world is that every human being has an animal companion, called a daemon, that often verbally or physically expresses what's going on inside that person. With children, including Lyra, the animal frequently changes species to reflect the unsettled nature of young personalities, whereas adults' daemons are fixed. This conceit can produce comic results when two people come into conflict and their respective daemons act it out; unusually for an ostensibly youth-oriented film, the critters are scarcely used to cutesy effect.
To its credit, "The Golden Compass" panders hardly at all in the usual kidpic ways. In fact, what Lyra finds the kidnapped children subjected to in the far north is little short of torture.
To battle the forces of evil, Lyra enlists a diverse collection of allies, among them cowboy aviator Lee Scorsesby (Sam Elliott in typically iconic form), friendly flying witch Serafina (Eva Green), some vagabonds called gyptians and, best of all, a mighty white bear named Iorek.
Pic's first great set piece is a fight to the death between Iorek and the North's bear king. Voicing these two warriors, respectively, Ian McKellen and Ian McShane try to out-baritone one another as their armored CGI counterparts roar, paw and bite until only one is left standing in a genuinely exciting sequence.
Soon thereafter comes a big, chaotic battle on ice involving multiple factions which, if not quite of "Rings"-like proportions, still packs a significant punch. Conclusion settles the drama's pressing matters for the moment, which reps a departure from the tome's cliffhanger ending, a choice perhaps made because New Line, unlike with "Rings," is waiting to gauge the reaction to "Compass" before proceeding with the next installment.
Weitz ("About a Boy"), who has never directed a film with anything like these logistics before, is saddled with conveying loads of exposition but handles the big scenes competently. Still, the prevailing tone is cold, which has nothing to do with the frigid settings of the second half, and the pic doesn't invite the viewer to enthusiastically enter into this new dramatic realm.
Evoking the technological and sartorial world of the 1930s, the visuals, decked out with almost constant CGI adornments, provide a constant feast for the eyes. Creatures, especially the bears, are strongly rendered, and the enterprise lacks for little in production values.
Kidman's Mrs. Coulter reps a problem in that her contradictory intentions can't really be sorted out; she's clearly up to no good, but she also has genuine reasons for wanting to be close to Lyra that make her obvious deception annoying. Kidman herself seems unduly brittle and unsettled under her superficial poise and elegant duds.
Craig has very little to do after his preliminaries, although presumably his role would come to the fore in later editions. Among the villainous Magisterium elders, Simon McBurney cuts the most entertainingly odious figure.
As for Richards, only time will tell if her characterization will grow beyond the willful, somewhat impatient girl who quickly adjusts to having others do her bidding. Young thesp has something going for her, but she, like the film, does not engender ready capitulation.
Alexandre Desplat's active score, while not his most distinctive, remains above the norm for this sort of project.

Casting Nicole Kidman  as The Golden Compass 's glacial, intractably smooth megalomaniac Mrs. Coulter is no less inspired for being obvious. Indeed, she was the first and only choice for director Chris Weitz , who adapted this first installment of Philip Pullman 's "His Dark Materials" trilogy. Despite the book's description of the nefarious doyenne's panther-black mane (the fantasy equivalent of the black cowboy hat), with her creepy, honey-do voice and suspiciously impeccable, chilly femininity, Kidman is Coulter up one side and down the slinky other.
A pity, then, that this casting-as-destiny coup is just one miss in The Golden Compass 's comprehensive line of near hits: Almost effective as the coolly fanatical, child-stealing villain, Kidman ultimately is a stray thread among many in a too-complicated quilt. In other words, she's scarier in Margot at the Wedding .
Complaints about the blurrily byzantine plotting of Pullman's allegory may be as inevitable as comparisons of Mrs. Coulter to kid lit's snowiest queen, Narnia  's White Witch .  For better or worse, it's a comparison that Pullmanno fan of the "tweedy medievalist" C.S. Lewis himself begged: Calling the Narnia  cycle "one of the most ugly and poisonous things I've ever read," the avowed atheist set out to slyly dissemble much of that series' embedded dogma with his story of a girl's quest to free children from their zombie-like servitude to quasi-Christian, sin-obsessed authority. It really must have burned Pullman's biscuits to see the first Narnia  movie gross nearly a billion dollars; perhaps it will be some comfort to watch his young heroine finally climb into her own wardrobe closet on-screento be delivered not into a land of eternal youth, benevolent lion kings, sacrifice, and resurrection, but into a nightmare of surgically enforced "innocence" and power-mad zealotry.
Weitz opens the film with some necessary but weirdly incongruous voiceover introducing us to the "other world" we are about to enter, where humans walk alongside their own souls, which appear as pet-like "daemons." The daemons of children (dazzlingly realized, as are all of the film's effects) can still change form, morphing from a polecat to an ermine to a mouse in a moment, but when children cross the brink into adulthood, their daemons become defined. We know, for instance, that Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig ) is a beautifulthough ruthlesspredator because he struts on-screen with a snow leopard at his side. Uncle to Lyra (the charming Dakota Blue Richards ), Asriel travels to Jordan College , where his orphan niece is boarded, appealing to the shady, suspiciously clerical "Magisterium" to fund his arctic research into the source of Dust, a euphemism for "all the death, the sin, the misery, the destructiveness in the world."
Hiding in the aforementioned closet, Lyra witnesses an attempt to poison Asriel. She becomes determined to suss out the deal with Dust when the glamorous Mrs. Coulter sweeps onto campus and offers her an assistantship in her swish London digs. Initially seduced by Mrs. Coulter's flirting, finery, and lady-adventurer vibe, Lyra soon discovers her keeper is behind a recent rash of (possibly Dust-related) child kidnappings, including that of her friend Roger. Lyra escapes, only to be kidnapped herself and rescued by vagabonds called "Gyptians," whom she enlists in her determined journey north to rescue her pal. Joining Lyra's crew is a fearsome, exiled polar bear King (voiced by Ian McKellen ), who later provides the film with its most spectacular sequence: some killer  bear-on-bear action. Oh yeah, and Lyra masters reading the alethiometera golden compass that reveals the truthgiven to her for no apparent reason before she left Jordan College.
One vaguely implicit reason is that Lyra could potentially be the "prophesized child" the local witches have been waiting for. But along with that sidelong allusion to a decidedly virtuous, righteous child who will save us all, the film contains a head-spinning hodgepodge of ideas and tetchy references wedged into a serviceable (if harried) fantasy lark. Pulling even the diaphanously cloaked punches of the book, Weitz avoids Compass 's one relatively direct indictment (involving Adam, Eve, and a pile of bollocks called "Original Sin") altogether by having the film end three crucial chapters before the book does. Those punches, unfortunately, are intrinsic to Compass 's valorous narrative fight (i.e., trying to get kids to swallow some sense with their fantasy). By insisting on many of Pullman's heady conceits but diluting the doctrinal antidote encoded within them, the intricate plot becomes an empty challenge. In drawing and quartering much of the novel's intent, Weitz ends up with a film that feels not just unfinished but undone.
