I could be wrong, but it feels like Eagle Eye
 is arriving in theatres a few months late. With its frenetic car chases; its near-erotic fascination with explosions, gadgets, and guns; and its improbable and, in the end, totally disposable storyline, it�s the very definition of a summer blockbuster: good, manic fun plus a heavy dose of political intrigue adding up to two hours of clamorous, mind-numbing nonsense. Had Will Smith agreed to play the role of Jerry Shaw, a sweet-talking slacker with a chip on his shoulder who gets dragged pissing and moaning in to a violent conspiracy against the U.S. government, the July Fourth weekend would have been all his. Instead we get LaBeouf, the former Disney Channel boy wonder, who may not have Smith�s magnetic appeal but who can grow a surprisingly good mustache. Not that director Caruso (Disturbia
) has much time to stop and ogle him; ogling simply isn�t possible in a movie so bent on full-speed-ahead destruction. Within minutes of our meeting him � in the stockroom of the copy store where he works � Jerry is on the run from the FBI (led by a deliciously dyspeptic Thornton) after being framed as a terrorist for reasons he can�t understand and narrowly escaping the gaping maw of the post-PATRIOT Act American justice system with the help of a mysterious woman who contacts him by cell phone and who possesses the ability to manipulate the entirety of a city�s electrical system � including elevated trains, traffic lights, garbage cranes, LED news tickers, and power lines � to get what she wants. And what she wants is to either destroy or defend (depending on whom you ask) the American political system by teaming Jerry with an equally clueless young mother (Monaghan) and forcing them into a mission of near-impossible danger. Like Smith�s Enemy of the State
, Eagle Eye
�s backdrop is a world gone mad with surveillance and, like The Terminator
 trilogy, one where the machines have slipped their leashes and taken over. Only now, as befits our post-9/11 world of lingering ideological terrorism, governmental assaults on civil liberties, technological assaults on privacy, citizen paranoia, and rampant self-help pseudo-spirituality, the machines aren�t just despots; they�re political philosophers, defenders of liberty, psychoanalysts, father confessors, and destroyers of worlds, all rolled into one � multiheaded monsters for a terrifying age.


The last time D.J. Caruso directed Shia LaBeouf, the movie was called "Disturbia," and the most disturbing thing about it was the obviousness with which everyone involved was ripping off Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window." How obvious? The owners of the short story on which "Window" was based are currently suing, citing "Disturbia" as an unauthorized remake.
"Eagle Eye," likewise, is a movie only a copyright lawyer could love. It strip-mines at least three Hitchcock classics - "North by Northwest," "The Wrong Man," and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" - then commits unlawful assault on Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" just for the heck of it. Serene in the knowledge that few moviegoers under the age of 30 have heard of any of these movies let alone seen them, "Eagle Eye" is Hitch for a modern age bloated by steroids, addled by action, and incapable of long-term attention.
Is it any fun? For an act of pillage, it's pretty entertaining. Bring earplugs and Dramamine, though, and keep "Vertigo" cued up on the DVD player for when you get home.
LaBeouf plays the wrong man in question, a mopey Chicago copy clerk named Jerry Shaw whose life goes haywire after his identical twin, Ethan, dies. Ethan was the good brother, and now his work in top-secret US Air Force skullduggery is landing upon the head of prodigal slacker Jerry. The phone rings and a pleasant woman's voice informs Jerry that the FBI is about to crash through his door and he'd better get moving.
The same woman calls single mother Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) and orders her to go to the corner and hop in a waiting Porsche
. If Rachel doesn't, her young son (Cameron Boyce) will be lunchmeat. In that Porsche, having escaped sour-faced FBI agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) through developments you wouldn't believe if I told you, is Jerry. All right, we're hooked: What's going on here?
The subject is info-age paranoia - the lingering fear that our every move is being watched and stored by a post-Internet, post-Patriot Act somebody or other. Whoever the voice is or represents, she can control traffic lights, ATM machines, LED signs, surveillance cameras, and the nation's entire telephone grid and air traffic control system. She barks out driving directions like a GPS dominatrix. If you've spent any time navigating a corporation's recorded answering menu, you know this voice and she's your worst nightmare.
You've probably figured out who she is, but Jerry and Rachel are too busy dashing around like lab rats to wonder. There's a screeching multi-car pile-up that Caruso films with overaggressive close-ups - you can't tell who's crashing into whom - and, toward the end, a scene that one-ups the biplane-in-a-cornfield bit in "North by Northwest." Now it's a fighter pilot roaring through a highway tunnel. The studios probably think this is progress.
Far in the distance, straining to keep up, are fine actors like Thornton, Rosario Dawson (as a crisp Air Force investigator), Anthony Mackie (as a Pentagon insider), and Michael Chiklis of TV's "The Shield" (as a mournful secretary of defense). He has reason to look constipated, given the film's mounting improbabilities. Just one, for example: There are unexplained crashes and detonations all over Washington, and the State of the Union Address goes on as planned? What's the threat level - taupe?
LaBeouf tackles his first grown-up leading man role, and he's . . . adequate. Anyway, he's not the movie's star - the central gimmick and the action sequences are - so any young actor could have played the part. LaBeouf's lack of heft, unfortunately, is underscored by the casting of the decade-older Monaghan opposite him and by the movie's nervousness over whether there should be a romance or not. There's one kiss, but it's a quick peck on the cheek. I guess she's sending him off to school.
The germ of "Eagle Eye" apparently originated years ago with executive producer Steven Spielberg, but Caruso and producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (they wrote "Transformers" after coming off TV's "Alias") are the governing sensibilities. Their approach could be called Twist and Smash: The script's busy enough to keep you guessing and the cracks are papered over with speed and noise.
The borrowings from older, better movies are used the way you'd retrofit a classic engine into an assembly-line chassis. No one in the audience needs to know that's the Albert Hall climax from "The Man Who Knew Too Much" rumbling under the final scenes set in the US Capitol. But no one who's seen "The Man Who Knew Too Much" will think "Eagle Eye" does it remotely as well.


George Orwell's preposterous declaration in 1984  has come true: Big Brother is  watching me and you and everyone we know, documenting us on surveillance cameras, capturing our cell phone, Internet, and AT M activity, and tracking our whereabouts as we drive hybrid vehicles outfitted with satellite guidance systems. So Eagle Eye , a brain-squandering thriller starring Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, and cell phones they insist upon answering, is onto something with its future-is-now premise of ordinary citizens blackmailed by infernal technology. But the movie (which began as a byte of an idea from exec producer Steven Spielberg) is so hysterical in its terrorist subplot and its seizure-inducing action sequences that a pummeled viewer can be excused for texting WTF?  to a friend in the middle of the chaos. Especially when the commands come from an unseen female mastermind with the voice of a GPS console reciting driving directions. (Sometimes she flashes additional info via electronic signage  like Steve Martin did for laffs in L.A. Story .)



The paranoid strain in American suspensers proceeds into the terror era with "Eagle Eye," a thriller that imagines an all-seeing national government that even the most conspiratorial-minded viewers will see as a tad far-fetched. Hatched some time ago from an uncredited idea by exec producer Steven Spielberg and problematically posited as a present-day actioner (rather than the future-set drama it could plausibly be), the pic's first 35 minutes sizzle until a Byzantine plot nudges the story toward near-parody in the final act. Returns should be brawny in a wide-release opening frame but will fade quickly by early October.
Taking over what was once a Spielberg directing project, helmer D.J. Caruso does more with the film than is offered by the script, credited to four writers. Still, the pic's increasingly chaotic and cockeyed notions of national security overwhelm fine lead perfs by Shia LaBeouf in his first thoroughly adult role as Chi-town slacker Jerry, and Michelle Monaghan as Rachel, both ensnared in a cyber-conspiracy that seemingly knows no end.
A botched U.S. air attack on an Al Qaeda-type suspect carries graver ramifications than the terrorists' retaliatory strikes. In apparently unconnected action, Jerry holds down a zero job at a copying joint and is late on the rent, while Rachel sees her son Sam (Cameron Boyce) off on a trip to music school. Jerry learns the tragic news that his twin brother and decorated Air Force officer Ethan (also LaBeouf, seen in brief snippets) has been killed in a bus accident.
Suddenly, Jerry finds himself as a Hitchcockian wrong man, his paltry bank account flush with cash and his apartment crammed with sophisticated weaponry, while both he and Rachel receive cell calls from a robotic-sounding female voice ordering them about. Jerry's arrest and interrogation by FBI agent Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton), who suspects he and Ethan are potential terrorists, lead to a set of increasingly improbable events that draw liberally on Hitchcock's "North by Northwest" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (the later version), as well as a slew of evil computer pics from "2001" to "Colossus: The Forbin Project."
Essence of the film's paranoid vision is that the Defense Dept. has created an all-seeing computer dubbed "Aria" (thus, the female voice, not credited onscreen, though with wads of dialogue) designed to track, spy and assess domestic terror risks. This virtual defender, in effect, has a fit after its recommendations for attacks are overridden, and employs "Project Guillotine" to target and kill the top 12 U.S. officeholders.
Jerry and Rachel's roles in all of this are as impossible to swallow as the notion that the same U.S. government that so badly botched the initial attack can create such a thoroughly brilliant and omnipotent device that even high-tech weapons can't defeat.
Caruso manages to nudge the excitement along as a way to distract from the narrative nonsense, energetically cutting between Jerry and Rachel's nonstop cat-and-mouse game with the dogged Morgan, and Air Force investigator Zoe (Rosario Dawson, solid in a straight-arrow role capped with a laughable action moment) searching for the truth behind Ethan's activities and Aria herself. Some messily staged and edited car chases mar an otherwise clean and often subtly staged set of sequences, especially an elegant one in the Capitol Building before and during the State of the Union address.
Taking on the kind of role Tommy Lee Jones used to do in his sleep, Thornton revives it with his personal, prickly sensibility. Thesps have the especially difficult job -- most notably LaBoeuf, in a cheeky variation on a similar Hitchcock-brand character he played in Caruso's "Disturbia" -- of looking super-serious when things get absurd.
Speilbergian quality and scale of production values and effects abound, from a completely convincing underground Pentagon to a fanciful Aria that looks designed by Buckminster Fuller. Darius Wolski's lensing is a huge contribution, while Brian Tyler's score is blandly generic.
