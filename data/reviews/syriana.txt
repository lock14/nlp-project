         "Syriana" is a film of paradoxes, contradictions and complications. It's a political thriller that thrives on misdirection, on hiding information just as it hides glamorous George Clooney behind a rumpled exterior and a full beard. Even its title is a puzzler: The meaning is critical, but no one on screen so much as says the word let alone explains it.
 
  Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, "Syriana" is a fearless and ambitious piece of work, made with equal parts passion and calculation, an unapologetically entertaining major studio release with compelling real-world relevance, a film that takes numerous risks and thrives on them all. An Oscar winner for writing "Traffic," Gaghan is not shy about using traditional Hollywood ingredients such as dramatically supercharged plot elements and a major-player cast (including Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper and Amanda Peet), but what he does with them is the opposite of standard.
 


         






    Gaghan fiddles with the norms of studio storytelling in ways both nervy and unnerving, including treating all his stars like supporting players, the better to grapple with one of today's biggest stories, the ramifications of the fight to control the planet's dwindling supply of oil.
 
  More than that, Gaghan uses the cover of genre picture-making to present a scathing critique of how America acts to protect its interests, how we try to get the world to dance to our tune, and what the consequences of those actions can be. This is a film to make your head spin and, more critically, your mind ponder.
 
  This is also a film, frankly, that can be as confusing as it is involving, that intentionally tells its story in a way that is all but impossible to follow in detail. That's due to both the complexity of the tale "Syriana" has chosen and Gaghan's subversive determination to use mystification in the service of what he sees as a greater good. Pursing his widely quoted notion that oil was the world's crack addiction, Gaghan made a connection with former top CIA field officer Robert Baer, whose book "See No Evil" gets a "suggested by" credit. Gaghan hung out with Baer for a considerable period of time, meeting major players in the interconnected worlds of espionage and politics, international finance and law, oil and radical Islam.
 
  (As to the film's title, Gaghan says that while "Syriana" is "a very real term used by Washington think tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East," its use here is more generic, pointing to "the fallacious dream that you can successfully remake nation-states in your own image.")
 
  Out of all of this came "Syriana's" complicated plot, which revolves around a fictional but oil-rich emirate in the Persian Gulf, which begins the narrative by announcing it has transferred drilling rights from Connex, a giant Texas firm, to the higher-bidding People's Republic of China. This change profoundly affects four people, individuals who are not initially aware of one another but are all involved in the geopolitical world of Middle Eastern oil and gas.
 
  As Connex tries to recover from its loss, it decides to merge with a smaller firm called Killen. Owned by Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), Killen has acquired the drilling rights to a rich field in Kazakhstan. One of "Syriana's" key players is Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), a smooth, controlled Washington lawyer charged by his power-broker boss, Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), to do whatever it takes to ensure that the Department of Justice approves the merger.
 
  Two of "Syriana's" other major figures are also in the oil business, albeit at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst who lives with his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons in posh Geneva. Wasim Kahn (Mazhar Munir) is an impoverished Pakistani oil field worker employed by Connex in that mythical emirate who loses his job when the firm loses those drilling rights to the Chinese. "Syriana's" last major player is veteran CIA field operative Bob Barnes (Clooney), a been-around intelligence agent who speaks Arabic and Farsi and has never hesitated to get his hands dirty in unsavory covert operations. Now nearing the end of his career, Barnes gets drawn into what is happening in the emirate in a way that eventually affects not only his life but also the lives of all the film's major players.
 
  What makes "Syriana" unusual, however, is not so much its plot complexities, which that summary barely hints at, but the way Gaghan and his team have taken daring pains to keep us in the dark by a strategy of obfuscation and willful withholding of information. For "Syriana" is a film that chooses consistently to place the audience one step behind the action, to in effect eliminate the kind of information-providing exposition that we can ordinarily count on. Aided by impressive editing by Tim Squyres ("Gosford Park," "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), we are dropped into the middle of situations, entering rooms after the events have begun, hearing conversations that have started. More important, most of the film's characters are introduced cold, without any identifying information, any hint as to who is important, who is peripheral. It's up to us to use our wits to figure out what's what, and, by "Syriana's" end, the film has shown enough to enable us to do that.
 
  The reason "Syriana" places complete understanding barely beyond our grasp is twofold. First of all, just as placing a mechanical rabbit a fraction out of the reach of greyhounds focuses the animals' attention, this technique ensures that human audiences concentrate intensely on the information at hand. Gaghan, a natural storyteller, helps this process along by building in unashamedly emotional moments, often situations between fathers and sons, that provide dramatic handholds on an otherwise slick surface.
 
  The other reason "Syriana" is structured the way it is is as an aid to verisimilitude. To be heedlessly thrown into things heightens the film's sense of reality, giving us the feeling that we are on the inside, deliciously eavesdropping on behind-closed-doors situations.
 
  "Syriana" encourages that insider feeling in other ways, including having sizable chunks of dialogue in subtitled Arabic (which Clooney had to learn). Elegantly photographed with hand-held cameras by the veteran Robert Elswit (who most recently did Clooney's "Good Night, and Good Luck"), the production shot in several locations (including Washington, D.C., Texas, Geneva, Dubai and Morocco, which doubled for Tehran, Beirut and the emirate) to give the film a strong visual sense of place.
 
  This overarching focus on enhancing reality is in the service of making us believe that what we're seeing on screen in "Syriana" just might be happening at this very moment, that a shadowy, amoral cabal of untouchable Washington power brokers might be pulling the strings that control the world.
 
  This is conspiracy-theory filmmaking of the most bravura kind, but if only a fraction of its suppositions are true, we — and the world — are in a world of trouble.

 Released by Warner Bros. Pictures. Director Stephen Gaghan. Producers Jennifer Fox, Michael Nozik, Georgia Kacandes. Executive producers George Clooney, Steven Soderbergh, Ben Cosgrove, Jeff Skoll.   

Syriana  has a lot of big, important things to say about big, important things, and it says them with a sense of urgency. This dense, talky, proudly complicated adult drama of geopolitical intrigue weighs in on the amoral realities of covert CIA operations, Middle Eastern politics, global oil business, and U.S. government antitrust investigations  the whole military-industrial ball of wax. Indeed, the point of Syriana  appears to be that the whole lousy, corrupt, oil-producing and -consuming world is a ball of wax, ready to melt.
The movie tells interrelated stories in knotted loops of simultaneity and jagged shards of documentary-style realism, with conspiracy on its mind and the piecemeal structure of Traffic  as its screenwriting template, in good part because Stephen Gaghan, who wrote the Oscar-winning Traffic  script for Steven Soderbergh, here writes and directs, too. It's as earnestly, politically left-leaning as Jarhead  is coyly apolitical; it's also the kind of movie that requires a viewer to work actively for comprehension, and to chalk up any lack of same to his or her own deficiency in the face of something so evidently smart.
But while I'm all for political dramas that take stands rather than feign neutrality, what Syriana  forgets to provide is the one thing that makes any movie, however difficult, easy to love: emotional empathy. Like the title itself  think-tank talk for a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East  this is a working paper of ideas driven by hypothesis, rather than a compelling drama driven by compassion.
And while those with an eye for vast left-wing conspiracies are welcome to believe that Gaghan planned all along to make a movie shaped like a big-picture that fails to take into account small-picture human needs, I am not one of those conspiracy junkies; I think the absence of soul is just the filmmaker's big gaffe.
Consider George Clooney as Bob Barnes, a veteran CIA man who serves as one of the character tentpoles of Gaghan's construction. Bob's got the thickened gut of a middle-aged company spook slowed down by years of routine (even if the routine involves assassination), and Clooney, who grew his own morose gut and beard for the part, is nothing if not generous in his habitation of such a shady yet loyal, freewheeling yet lonely man. (The actor's commitment to politically engaged movies, in this as well as Good Night, and Good Luck , is one of the most effective uses of his well-earned stardom.)
But for all we see of Bob, we know nothing at all about the guy, except that having been arbitrarily double-crossed by a field contact during the course of a mission, he now finds himself just as arbitrarily made a scapegoat by his own CIA handlers, who want to distance themselves from such a liability. We watch Matt Damon, as an open-faced go-getter of an energy analyst, negotiate business with a Middle Eastern prince (Alexander Siddig), and Jeffrey Wright, as a Washington attorney, work on a merger between two American oil companies, and there's no reason given for the double-dealing, power plays, and American capitalist thuggery that shape the landscape. (What little humanity this trio of clueless, overmatched American men retains is conferred by fleeting interaction with kin; in the case of Wright's ambitious lawyer, his private burden is an embarrassing drinking bum of a father. And he handles the old man with much the same distraction shown by Michael Douglas as a drug czar with an addicted daughter in Traffic .)
The same schematic shorthand goes, by the way, for the Middle Easterners involved, who are less fallible men tripped up by the modern (and specifically American) world than walking position statements: corrupt Gulf-country prince backed by American oilmen versus his reform-minded brother, or long-suffering migrant Pakistani oil worker versus his angry son recruited by nuclear-weapon-toting extremists.
Syriana  makes a point of circling the globe, with scenes shot in Geneva, Dubai, London, etc.  it's a picture that displays datelines as a show of geopolitical bustle. And the speeches of even the most passing players are honed to draw blood  Chris Cooper as a scheming oilman, Christopher Plummer as the head of a powerful law firm, Amanda Peet in a slicing performance as Damon's distressed wife.  But what do those speeches say? They say, We're talking about big, important things, so pay attention  and then make it a challenge to do so.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Supporting Actor (George Clooney); Best Original Screenplay (Stephen Gaghan)

 Swaddled in 30 extra pounds and a thick gray beard, George Clooney moves through his portion of "Syriana" with furrowed brow and a slow, careful gait. His character, Bob Barnes, is a not-unfamiliar type in the world of movie espionage: the weary, cynical C.I.A. operative on the brink of an attack of conscience. Bob, who has spent his career in cheerful spots like Beirut and Tehran, is the kind of guy who knows a lot more than he says, and who speaks in a low monotone, evading more questions than he answers. When pressed for information - by an aggressive government bureaucrat or by his impatient teenage son (Max Minghella) - his default response seems to be, "It's complicated."  Quite so. "Syriana," written and directed by Stephen Gaghan (who also wrote "Traffic," its obvious precursor), is a movie that demands and rewards close attention. Loosely based on the memoirs of a C.I.A. veteran, Robert Baer, on whom Mr. Clooney's character is modeled, it aims to be a great deal more than a standard geopolitical thriller and thereby succeeds in being one of the best geopolitical thrillers in a very long time. Along with Mr. Baer's book "See No Evil," it assimilates a whole shelf of post-9/11 nonfiction and journalism, spinning a complex, intriguing narrative about oil, terrorism, money and power. Parsing its details requires a good deal of concentration: important information is conveyed through whispered conversations and sidelong glances, and you may sometimes wish for a chart diagraming all the patterns of influence, connection and coincidence. But the mental labor of figuring out just what is going on is part of what makes the film such a rich and entertaining experience.  And its sheer entertainment value - the way that Mr. Gaghan, with remarkable conviction and confidence, both honors and scrambles the conventions of the genre - is worth emphasizing. Since it deals with some contentious contemporary realities, it is likely to be greeted with a fair amount of chin-rubbing commentary. Though "Syriana" is expressly a work of fiction, it will no doubt be subjected to a round of pseudo-fact-checking, and its dark, conspiratorial view of the present and recent past is likely to be challenged, either because it is too complicated or not complicated enough.  Someone is sure to complain that the world doesn't really work the way it does in "Syriana": that oil companies, law firms and Middle Eastern regimes are not really engaged in semiclandestine collusion, to control the global oil supply and thus influence the destinies of millions of people. O.K., maybe. Call me naïve - or paranoid, or liberal, or whatever the favored epithet is this week - but I'm inclined to give Mr. Gaghan the benefit of the doubt. And even if the picture's rendering of current events turns out to be entirely off base, the energy, care and intelligence with which it makes its points are hard to dismiss.  There are four main storylines, linked by the anxious, irregular heartbeat of Alexandre Desplat's score - each one subject to enough twists and reversals to make plot summary a treacherous exercise. While Bob is sorting out his midcareer issues - his bosses, concerned about his maverick tendencies, appear to want either to confine him to a desk job or send him off to be killed somewhere - some members of the younger generation are finding troubles and opportunities of their own. Bennet Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is a rising lawyer at a Washington firm who is called upon to run due diligence in advance of a merger between two energy companies. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), a financial analyst living with his family in expatriate luxury in Geneva, becomes the financial adviser to Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), who is eager to succeed his father as ruler of an oil-rich emirate and inaugurate a program of political and economic modernization. In Prince Nasir's country, meanwhile, a young Pakistani laborer named Wasim (Mazhar Munir) succumbs to the lure of radical Islam, seeking refuge from the dusty oil fields and crowded hostels in the tranquillity of a madrasa.  These five characters - Bob, Wasim, Prince Nasir, Bennett and Bryan - add up to a sort of composite hero, though their heroism, collective and individual, is highly ambiguous. Not one of them is in possession of a clear conscience or a singular motive, and not one of them fully claims the audience's sympathy. Greed and ambition sometimes coincide with idealism, and self-interest shades into scruple. Each of the five is afflicted by family problems - the mutual disappointments of fathers and sons is the film's principal psychological motif - and throws himself into the world of money, politics and power as a way to escape or salve his private unhappiness.  Viewed in hindsight, and as a whole, "Syriana" can seem a bit chilly and schematic. Mr. Gaghan handles the main characters with analytical detachment, leaving it to the actors to supply each of them with a full measure of individuality. They prove more than equal to the task, and it is hard to single any one of them out. At different points in the film - and with the repeated viewings it amply repays - you notice Mr. Munir's delicate, watchful sensitivity; Mr. Damon's angry, boyish bravado; Mr. Siddig's icy mastery; or Mr. Wright's stealthy ferocity. Mr. Clooney, an executive producer as well as one of the stars, pushes understatement almost to the point of inscrutability. Is that guilt we see in Bob's eyes, or fatigue? Skepticism or fear?  There are too many fine supporting performances to list, though Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, William C. Mitchell and Shahid Ahmed all deserve mention. A movie this crowded and wide-ranging - the number of speaking parts seems to be exceeded only by the variety of locations - inevitably resorts to various kinds of shorthand. The secondary characters tend to be stock figures. When a character is shown working in his garden and then, later, swirling brandy in a snifter, you know he is a bad guy. A man who shoots billiards in the middle of the day can be counted on to be feckless and self-indulgent, and anyone who makes a high-minded speech on the virtues of free-market capitalism might as well have "fall guy" tattooed on his forehead.  All of which is to say that "Syriana" is, in the end, a movie. Rather than dispense with the familiar signposts of Hollywood storytelling, it brings them to a state of heightened attention and pushes beyond the clichés of heroism and suspense toward something a good deal more unsettling. Something you might even call realism.  "Syriana" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some graphically violent scenes and occasional obscenity.

Those complaining that Hollywood never turns out films of topical or political substance are likely to embrace "Syriana," a weighty and deeply intriguing look at the many-tentacled beast that is the international oil industry. Wide-ranging and restlessly probing, Stephen Gaghan's second directorial effort uses the same mosaic storytelling technique as in his Oscar-winning screenplay for "Traffic" to create a revealing portrait of diverse forces contributing to global tension, particularly concerning the Middle East. Terse, understated and sometimes confusing, this is the rare film that could actually benefit from being significantly longer. Warner Bros. release will become a must-see for thinking audiences and make inroads with the wider public thanks to star names and certain critical acclaim.
Globe-trotting as stealthily as did exec producer Steven Soderbergh's "Ocean's Twelve," but with rather more seriousness of intent, Gaghan plunges straight past the received versions of contemporary events to open up a vast range of inquiry that encompasses everyone from oil industry titans and CIA ops to disenfranchised Pakistani workers and a Beirut godfather of Hezbollah. Underexplaining sometimes to a fault, pic keeps the viewer straining to keep tabs on the identities, relationships and allegiances among the dozens of characters (explanatory titles at least identify locations), but while many post-screening discussions will feature "Did you get what was going on there?"-type queries, the disparate threads come together with undeniable power and reasonable clarity by the end.
It's all about those old standbys, power and money, but the fascination is in the details -- the manipulations, betrayals, deceit and tragedies, the immoral extremes to which true believers (in religion, capitalism, the principles of government) will go and at what human cost. Analytical and revelatory in nature, the film is not designed to elicit rooting interests or a strong emotional pull, nor is it didactic or motivated by political point-making. It mainly wants to strip away conventional perceptions to present one closely observed view of what makes the world go 'round.
If there's a chief among equals here, it's graying, bearded, portly CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney, with 30 extra pounds), who's first seen unloading two sophisticated stinger missiles to a young Iranian in Tehran.
Back in the U.S., two petroleum behemoths are about to merge, one that's losing its drilling rights in a fictional Gulf state to a higher Chinese bidder, the other of which has just snared access to Kazakhstan. Situation in the Gulf nation is delicate since the aging Emir needs to select a successor from between his sophisticated older son Nasir (Alexander Siddig), who favors the Chinese deal, and his uncouth younger one Meshal (Akbar Kurtha), who's Yank-friendly.
Meanwhile, the merger is being assessed by D.C. attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), whose boss Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is a major behind-the-scenes power player in oil and politics. Then there's Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), a Geneva-based energy analyst who becomes deeply involved with Nasir after a terrible accident makes the prince feel indebted to the American.
Lurking beneath the radar is young Pakistani oil refinery laborer Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir), who, with his father, is laid off after the Chinese takeover and falls under the sway of a radical Islamic cleric in the Gulf.
In laying out the story's underpinnings, Gaghan, whose prior outing as helmer was the under-realized 2002 suspenser "Abandon," takes a terse, even cryptic approach that quickly signals you're going to have to stay on your toes to keep up. Only with reluctance does the writer-director supply what normally passes for exposition, and he and editor Tim Squyres keep the rhythms tense and the mood off-kilter without resorting to manufactured-feeling suspense cutting.
Even when it's not entirely clear what's going on, the scenes are mostly dramatic and absorbing, with a feeling of credibility rooted in the palpably real settings and naturalistic dialogue.
When Barnes arrives in Beirut to undertake a hit, he's greeted by a Hezbollah welcoming committee that packs him off in a car to meet their boss, a serene gent who approves his presence. Before he can do his nasty deed, however, Barnes is turned on by one of his own and undergoes gruesome fingernail extraction torture (a scene that injured Clooney's own spinal cord) before a last-second reprieve.
But it's curtains for his CIA career. Frozen out, the perennial agency loyalist is forced to extreme measures to reclaim his passports for one more trip to the Middle East.
Meanwhile, Holiday arranges for a couple of powerful men to take the fall so that the oil merger can go ahead, and Woodman accepts guilt money that creates an irreparable rupture with his wife (Amanda Peet). As for Wasim, he becomes tempted by the idea of a nonstop ticket to paradise.
The richness of detail is immense, evincing Gaghan's years of research: the booze and floozies in Tehran; the parched lives of immigrant workers in the Gulf; the convinced attitudes of members of a Washington-based Committee for the Liberation of Iran; the comparative ways Texans and Arabs wear their oil birthrights; the arguments among Islamic youth about the righteousness of virginity; the competing pulls of modernity and fundamentalism in the Middle East, and corruption, corruption everywhere.
Given the breadth of Gaghan's canvas, there's a sense that "Syriana" may even have been trimmed down too much, that more information would have been welcome. William Hurt pops up only for two quick scenes as a friend of Barnes, latter's son (Max Minghella) has but a toss-away interlude, and repeated appearances by Holiday's grouchy father are confounding.
Performances are all cut from the same serious, unostentatious cloth. Clooney, in an effective, self-effacing turn, delivers an agent whose determination still trumps a growing exasperation. Damon embodies a boy-man whose opportunistic moral choice will forever define him, while Siddig cuts a compelling figure as a British-educated Arab royal whose breaks with tradition prove far too "progressive" for long-standing vested interests. Wright's character is so zipped up and close-to-the-vest that even this most inventive of thesps can't provide a glimmer of Holiday's inner life.
Lensed to a great extent in Dubai and Morocco, as well as in Europe and the States, pic gives the impression of great mobility and agitation without Gaghan and cinematographer Robert Elswit indulging in visual showboating; compositions are actually rather plain. Dominant effect of the locations is backed up with seamless production design by Dan Weil.

Syriana , written and directed by Stephen Gaghan , is by far the Bushiest of Bush II  thrillers. Set in the really big time, it's a complicated tale of investigation and intrigue involving Texas oilmen and Gulf emirs, Islamic terrorists and slick lawyers, the CIA  and the Committee for the Liberation of Iran , fear of China and hatred of regulation, dubious business deals and missing missilesjust about everything except the big enchilada, Eye-Rack.
Gaghan wrote the screenplay for Steven Soderbergh 's highly regarded 2000 dope opera Traffic , and Syriana  (which was inspired by Robert Baer 's CIA memoir and takes its title from a think-tank term for a reconfigured Middle East) is a comparable game of 3-D Monopoly. Indeed, Gaghan has been widely quoted comparing oil to crack. Given the large cast, the international hopscotch, and the tantalizing illusion of depth, the movie's tone is Frontline  meets John le Carré . Compared to the complacence of something like The Interpreter , it's a regular brain tickler. Gaghan's opus runs just over two hours and, complicated as it is in its evocation of new world disorder, could easily have been half an hour longer.
The ensemble is stellar. Bearded and paunchy, George Clooney  plays against his looks as a bearish CIA operative who is at once the spook that sits by the door and the spy left out in the cold; Matt Damon  is an enthusiastic young energy trader who angrily cashes in on a family tragedy to hook up with a reform-minded Persian Gulf  prince (Alexander Siddig ); Jeffrey Wright 's very buttoned-down D.C. lawyer dutifully greases the wheels for a merger involving a giant oil company, just shut out of the Gulf, and the smaller outfit run by Chris Cooper 's wildcat Texan, which has locked up the drilling rights to Kazakhstan .
No single scene typifies the movie's geopolitical whirligig, and yet nearly every one of them is predicated on a subtle reversal of expectations. While, from a liberal perspective, Siddig's character is a designated good guy and Wright's boss (Christopher Plummer ) is an unambiguous slimeball, no one else's morality is so clear-cut. What's particularly novel about Syriana 's scenario is its reticence in identifying the honest intentions of its three stars. In a sense, this virtue is also the movie's flaw: There are too many points of view and there is too little time to fully develop the key characterizations.
Or, perhaps the actors have been under-directed. Is Clooney playing a fall guy or a rogue operative or both? At what point does disillusionment set in? (Clooney's torture scene evidently caused a serious back injury.) Is Damon's character an avid opportunist or an incipient idealist? Does Wright's have his own agenda? Is he a monster of passive-aggression or is he simply a tailored suit? Even if character is defined by action, as is customary in the thriller world, there is a sense of abruptly telescoped activity. Clooney's agent, in particular, has a puzzling genius for hitting the narrative's dramatic marks all over the world.
Syriana  is both topical and anachronistic. It harks back to lefty thrillers of the Watergate era like The Parallax View  and Three Days of the Condor , but Gaghan is less fixated on superstar heroism and more interested in representing a systemif, indeed, that system can be represented. His method is actually more Socratic than his worldview is paranoid. There is the feeling that any location might yield a terrorist bomb and that the big story is (intentionally?) submerged beneath a welter of small plots. Still, the question is always, can we really do thisand does it matter?
Gaghan's oblique framing, dense editing, and hectic Steadicam  make his movie's tangled narrative skein even harder to unravel. The look recalls Soderberghand while Syriana  is certainly more fluid than if it had been directed by Michael Mann , it doesn't dumb itself down. Gaghan assumes that you'll get the historical reference when someone casually drops the name "Mossadegh," or recognize the more egregiously self-serving koans certain characters are apt to spout. ("In this town you're innocent until you're investigated," Plummer tells Wright.)
Even at its most didactic, Syriana  (like Traffic ) is not unduly moralizing. The movie may be too knowing for its own good, but it's not glib and it never goes cheesy.
