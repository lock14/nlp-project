Peter Jackson's ''King Kong" delivers all you could possibly want from a modern popcorn behemoth: state-of-the-art special effects, epic scope and running time, rampaging dinosaurs, things majestically going ka-boom. It's not so much a remake as it is a loving re-creation of the 1933 original on extra-strength steroids, with a side order of Botox. You've seen it all before but most assuredly never like this.
So why did I come away feeling something was missing?
''Kong" reestablishes Jackson as the king of Hollywood gigantism, and plenty of moviegoers will feel like they're getting their money's worth. After an overly drawn-out first hour, the film turns into an E-ticket ride of the first order, with scene after eye-popping scene in which the 24-foot ape takes on T. Rexes, elevated trains, biplanes, and Naomi Watts. There's a brontosaurus stampede almost as terrifying as rush hour on the Southeast Expressway, and a Times Square donnybrook that's a landmark in screen mayhem.
Andy Serkis -- the body under Gollum's digital skin in ''The Lord of the Rings" -- gives Kong enough personality, enough soul, to make you believe he'd tumble for Watts's Ann Darrow, and the director works overtime to create a love story between the two that's substantially deeper than anything offered by the original or the misbegotten 1976 remake.
It's the movie itself that's curiously lacking in soul. Jackson is so devoted to piling modern CGI wonders on the bones of the 1933 classic that he forgets to have much fun. Whether by conscious choice or through the limitations of digital technology, the color scheme in ''Kong" is one of dark, leaden grays. The film is an astonishing machine.
It's also quite nasty in places, in keeping with the original movie and with the director's beginnings in anarchic splatter films. A sequence storyboarded for the 1933 ''Kong" but never filmed finally reaches the screen here: chasing Ann and Kong into the interior of Skull Island, the ship's crew tumbles down a ravine and is attacked by a variety of jumbo insects and beasties, including carnivorous sea slugs that gobble one man down in slimy gulps of peristalsis. This is bravura screen horror -- and definitely not for the kiddies.
Jackson wants to give us a primal experience. Scratch that -- he wants to pound us with primal experiences, but the 75 minutes leading up to the appearance of Kong feel padded and inert. The film establishes the Great Depression, Ann's desperate financial straits, her crush on rising young playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), the panicky attempts of gonzo filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) to hire an actress and set sail for an uncharted island in the South Seas and the rumored thing that lives there.
Once at sea, various crew members are introduced -- Thomas Kretschmann as the captain of the tramp steamer, Jamie ''Billy Elliot" Bell as the crazy cabin boy, Evan Parke as Token Black Guy -- and you have to wonder why, since they're probably all going to be dino kibble soon enough.
The 1933 film got all this over and done with in a matter of minutes, but never mind that. Finally we get to the island, and to Jackson's vision of the natives as an inbred horde of prehistoric savages; the emphasis isn't on ooga-booga political incorrectness but full-on zombie terror. (Anyway, there's enough sublimated racial dissonance later on, in the image of a beautiful blonde in the grip of a dark, bestial stranger three stories tall. Jackson doesn't really go there, but you grad students can.)
Finally, Ann gets picked up by Kong -- hello, gorgeous -- and carried into the island's interior, and the movie's true marvels begin. The director bows low to the original film (I swear some of Kong's movements ape the skittery stop-motion of Willis O'Brien's groundbreaking work) while going for broke in key scenes. Kong fights off not one but three roaring tyrannosauri, and not just on level ground but ensnared in vines while suspended over a crevasse.
Amazing stuff, and there's plenty more where that came from. Serkis's movements, filmed and then digitally ''clothed" with fur, give the great ape a fluidity that can't be attained with puppetry or monkey-suits; this is easily the most believable Kong yet. The sequences in which he and Ann bond are remarkably good-natured -- who knew the big fella could laugh? -- and I for one could have happily spent the entire movie in their company.
But Manhattan calls and there are period cars to be stomped. The final New York section, once Kong has been installed as the prisoner of Broadway, is exciting without being compelling; the sense of connecting the dots of the 1933 film with a heavier digital pen is unavoidable. Brody and Black are back on the scene; the former has little to do given the new rapport between girl and gorilla, and as amusing as Black is, he's too ironic a performer to approach the monomaniacal intensity of Robert Armstrong in the original.
It comes down to, as it must, Kong swatting the attacking planes atop the Empire State Building. This time, though, Ann is begging them to stop, and the film suddenly stumbles into a sense of tragic loss it isn't fully equipped to handle, even with an earlier scene of Kong chained and ''crucified" onstage. In the end, the film's key line of dialogue isn't ''Twas beauty killed the beast," but a character's comment on Denham's ''unfailing ability to destroy the thing he loves." Peter Jackson hasn't destroyed ''Kong" -- I doubt that's possible -- but his love for hollow extravaganza proves to be larger than his love for a great big monkey or a great old movie.

         Peter Jackson has a satisfyingly sure-handed update in 'King Kong.'
 
  There's a moment about 45 minutes into Peter Jackson's "King Kong," as the "motion-picture ship" the Venture approaches the fog-shrouded shores of Skull Island, when Jimmy (Jamie Bell), the youngest member of the crew, looks up from his copy of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" with a troubled look and says, "It's not an adventure story, is it, Mr. Hayes?" To which the grave first-mate Hayes (Evan Parke) replies categorically, "No, Jimmy, it's not."
 


         






    Of course, "King Kong" is too an adventure story, and a big, nerve-jangling, spectacular one at that, featuring an expressive 50-foot ape, packs of bloodthirsty dinosaurs and hordes of monster insects with super-viscous insides. Hayes is referring to Conrad's nightmarish novel about the brutality of white imperialism, but he's also signaling that Jackson has gently updated the movie's attitudes without crossing the line into revisionism or parody.
 
  At more than three hours and $200 million, "King Kong" is an homage not just to the original but to the history of movies themselves. Like the 1933 version directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, a studio-saving box-office sensation that set out to out-movie every movie ever made, "King Kong" is designed to hit mostly below the brain. But the excellent script by Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens retains the plot, settings and spirit of the original while also engaging it in a lively debate.
 
  A travelogue through popular movie genres, it passes from socially conscious drama to comedy, romance, horror, adventure, science-fiction fantasy and doomed love story, cleverly quoting the styles and tropes to which we've become accustomed along the way. A movie about the movies, and specifically an exploitation picture about exploitation pictures, Jackson's "Kong" is also a witty comment on the darkness at the heart of adventure stories, a bazillion-dollar spectacle that reserves the right to question the morality of spectacles, and, mostly, a tender love story about a melancholy girl and her tragically misunderstood monkey.
 
  The movie may promise, as adventure filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) says to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), the starving actress he lures aboard the ship as monster bait, "money, fame, adventure, a long sea voyage," but it delivers a tragedy. By returning to the 1933 version, a special-effects marvel that showcased everything movies could do that other media could not, Jackson translates Cooper and Schoedsack's awing crowd-pleaser into contemporary visual idiom, creating the experience anew for a much tougher, sensation-inured and bloodthirsty crowd.
 
  The original starred Robert Armstrong as the blustery showman Denham, Fay Wray as the helpless blond Ann Darrow, Bruce Cabot as the unintentionally hilarious woman-hating (but Ann-loving) first mate Jack Driscoll, and Willis H. O'Brien's 18-inch, rabbit-fur-covered mechanical model with stuffed-animal eyes as Kong. Four decades later, John Guillermin transplanted the story to the Me Decade, casting Jeff Bridges as a hippie paleontologist named Jack, Charles Grodin as the evil head of an oil company, and Jessica Lange as a loopy actress who was not so much malnourished as she was just hungry for attention.
 
  In different hands, the new version might have been subjected to another topical makeover. (Carl Denham as secretary of State? Jack Driscoll as HuffPo blogger? Ann Darrow as "Top Model" hopeful?) Instead, Jackson dramatizes the shift in attitudes of the intervening years by digging deeper into his characters. Some become so complex as to require spinoffs. Driscoll, for instance, becomes three characters: Hayes, the first mate and voice of dissent; Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler), the preening actor who plays the first mate and Ann's love interest in Denham's movie and supplies the silly, B-movie dialogue for the film within the film; and Driscoll (Adrien Brody), the talented, ruminative and ineffectual playwright who sees through Denham but lacks the wile to curb him.
 
  The most problematic aspects of the original (perpetually on tour throughout film-theory classes as the classic example of Hollywood racism) are also brilliantly incorporated as Denham's B-movie in progress and, later, as part of his Broadway show â€” a spectacularly tasteless representation of "native" cultures, with ooga-booga music and coconut bras lifted directly from Cooper and Schoedsack. Ann, an archetypal screaming blond, has been fleshed out and reboned as a sensitive artist whose integrity and soulfulness have a way of keeping her hungry. And Watts plays her with such soul, intelligence and spirit that she effectively neutralizes the role of the helpless girl-victim forever.
 
  As for the character of Denham, whose cocky, blinkered noxiousness goes unchallenged in the original (it ends with Denham blaming "beauty" for all the havoc, as a city cop all but pats him on the back), Jackson has managed to represent the spirit of the era without condoning or condemning it. Jack Black â€” with his flat, brassy voice, and flat coal-lump eyes â€” is an inspired choice for Denham. Loosely modeled on Orson Welles, he's a showman-hustler with a nose for sensation, a palpable desperation and an uncanny ability to surmise what people want to hear and then lie to their faces. Denham sees the world as one vast, virgin thrill mine just waiting to be tapped. He wants his millions and his artistic respect too. What kind of a person is he? As he tells Ann, "I'm someone you can trust. I'm a movie producer!"
 
  The movie opens on shots of zoo animals near a homeless encampment in Depression-era New York and travels through soup kitchens and welfare lines to alight in a half-empty vaudeville theater, where Ann is performing for a handful of spectators. When the theater closes, she makes a last attempt to get an audition for a part in a new play by Driscoll. The producer rebuffs her, suggesting she try her luck at a burlesque show, which is where Denham finds her.
 
  Denham is desperate, having just stolen his footage from angry producers (such philistines as to make him look like an artist) and lost his lead actress. Using nothing but his considerable powers of manipulation, he soon has her onboard the ship, along with the shanghaied Driscoll.
 
  It's a full hour before we meet Kong (for whom Andy Serkis provided the motion-captured modeling for the CGI animation, as well as Kong's facial expressions and melancholy, tea-colored eyes) and at least two before we really start to get to know him. In the meantime, the Venture's passengers experience shipboard adventure, romance and a nightmarish encounter with the otherworldly Skull Island natives. Witches, zombies and voodoo children rolled into one, they represent the sum of all Western fears. ("For God's sake, Denham," hollers Baxter, in a hilarious moment when the director tries to offer a feral-looking child a half-eaten Hershey bar. "Leave the native alone!" Naturally, Denham intends to do no such thing.)
 
  No surprise, they go for the blond. Ann is abducted and offered to Kong as sacrifice, and the crew is compelled to travel deep into the jungle, where it experiences a series of lethal run-ins with stampeding brontosauruses, giant prehistoric crab lice, the first ever, as far as I know, recorded attack of giant Phallus Dentata.
 
  But the movie really comes to life in the scenes of developing idyll between Ann and the giant ape. After a rocky start, they discover themselves to be kindred spirits, sensitive types (with high theatrical standards) adrift in a brutal world where people just can't get past their looks. For all the movie's technical wizardry, it's the relationship that gets you.
 
  And from the moment Ann (who shares a last name with the famous Clarence, who in 1925 defended the teaching of evolution in Tennessee public schools in one of the most publicized trials of the century) willingly steps into the palm of Kong's hand, you kind of step in with her. It's not just that he's cute, or that he saves her from the prehistoric lizard brains; it's that she sees something in him that the others don't: He's a link to her humanity. He's family.
 
  Naturally, their problems don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and eventually Kong is captured and crucified in front of thousands of thrilled-to-death, well-heeled New Yorkers (though his simian leanings will no doubt prevent him from being hailed as a furry martyr any time soon).
 
  As in the original, he meets his end atop the world's tallest skyscraper â€” where there's no escaping the bi-planes or the symbolism.
 
  Sure, the girl gets the blame in the end, her being so sexy and all, but the movie knows better. It's the doomed romance of a lifetime, and it makes perfect sense. Kong is the last gasp of the great, natural world, reduced to consumerist spectacle. And she's Ann Darrow
, famous monkey defender.

There's a new king in town. He roams the jungle with unmatched strength, and when he prowls his territory, other creatures must bow to his awesome primacy. I'm referring, of course, to Peter Jackson, the New Zealand filmmaker whose thrilling reinterpretation of King Kong  is one of the wonders of the holiday season. As a follow-up to his triumphant Lord of the Rings  trilogy, the movie seals Jackson's reputation: He's the most gifted big-picture artist working today, a master of epics from a human-eye view who excels at employing 21st-century technological wizardry to suit the needs of ageless, personal storytelling.
As a sophisticated blockbuster, meanwhile, based on a premise with little of LOTR 's gravitas and complexity, King Kong  sets the new standard for honoring a mass-market classic while remaking it with nuanced contemporary self-awareness. I mean, let's get real: If the 1933 original, directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, was the era's comparable marvel of special effects, the production was also about as refined as Kong's left mitt. Lusty shrieking and fainting by Fay Wray as the ape's delectable beloved to the contrary, the performances were heavy-footed, the dialogue was leaden, and on-screen racial sensitivity was in its primordial stage. Yet with the bracingly smart script by longtime teammates Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, the remake acknowledges that very clunkiness with love and a sense of humor, incorporating relics of dialogue Â— and racial silliness Â— into the retelling. And with Naomi Watts so radiantly intelligent as the beast's new beauty, the dynamic between dark, hairy, tired old male and delicate, blond, empathetic young damsel takes on new psychological reverberations.
The enchanting love story that ensues becomes its own thoughtful Topsy-Turvy-like essay on and homage to the very nature of theatrical creation, both in 1933 and today, all of which is easily accessible to those with a like-minded love of such wit and lore; it's also expendable by those who would rather sit happily dumbstruck with pleasure as the old doozy roars to life again. Behold the savagery and egomania of show business, and behold, as well, the primal animal instincts of fighting and bonding! Or at the very least, behold the spectacle of the cinematic creation itself, King Kong!
Indeed, reliving those pleasures puts me in mind of Titanic , however imbalanced the weight of fantasy fiction versus that of historical fact might seem to be. In both pictures, the old world gives way to the new under duress (the ship and its prewar class system sinks, the untamed animal is defeated atop the swanky Empire State Building). And in both, the rush of pure, movie-going satisfaction is precious.
Three hours is a long run for a primate pic, but the time passes quickly when the entertainment is so full, funny, and unexpectedly moving. Although echoes of Max Steiner's fine original music can be heard throughout the new score by James Newton Howard, the picture opens on ironic wings of song as Al Jolson burbles the tune ''I'm Sitting on Top of the World'' and the filmmaker vividly establishes the contours of a New York City racked by economic depression. Repeated viewings will allow closer study of the juicy detail squeezed into this teeming artificial Manhattan; for now, it's a brisk trot before we're introduced to the monomaniacal moviemaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts in Wray's dainty shoes), the newbie actress he casts as his leading lady in the exotic new picture he wants to make on an island far away Â— the worst location shoot ever.
The itinerary timetable allows for one hour before the ship anchors at Skull Island, one hour of nonstop action onshore (as the adventurers meet Kong, the adventurers meet dinosaurs, dinosaurs meet Kong, spiders meet the adventurers, ape meets girl, ape loses girl), and one hour back in New York as Kong and Ann battle the beasts of capitalism. (In a glimmer of hope for socially challenged writers everywhere, Ann's shipboard sweetheart, Jack Driscoll, is no longer a sailor; he's now Carl's screenwriter, and he's played by menschy Adrien Brody.) Jackson gets it all in Â— the crazy feats of battle, the little flashes of self-awareness from ruthless Carl (no one beats Black at portraying barely controlled mania), the postfeminist enlightenment from Jack. The new King Kong is a virtuoso demonstration of the industry's most astonishing advances in computer animation Â— Kong himself (with a motion-capture performance by the invaluable Andy Serkis) appears as fully real as the luminous, earthly Watts, and Jackson's dinosaurs make Spielberg's dinosaurs in Jurassic Park  look as if they were conjured in the Jurassic Age. But what resonates is the story, which is a very human tale of compassion, greed, loss, bravery, creativity, foolishness, and love. Something, as Carl Denham might have said, for everyone.

 Among the reasons "King Kong" - the old 100-minute black-and-white version, that is - has retained its appeal over the years is that it reminds audiences of the do-it-yourself, seat-of-the-pants ethic of early motion pictures. In 1933, when RKO released it, sound film was in its infancy, and film itself was in the midst of a coltish, irrepressible adolescence. Merian  C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack, who directed the first "Kong," understood the alchemical convergence of gimmickry and sublimity that lay at the heart of the medium's unrivaled potential to generate spectacle and sensation.  That potential still exists, but it may be harder to find these days, given how much bigger and more self-important movies have become. In his gargantuan, mightily entertaining remake, "King Kong," Peter Jackson tries to pay homage to the original even as he labors to surpass it. The sheer audacious novelty of the first "King Kong" is not something that can be replicated, but in throwing every available imaginative and technological resource into the effort, Mr. Jackson comes pretty close.  The threshold of sensation has risen drastically since the 30's, when movies were still associated with older, somewhat disreputable forms of popular culture. Unlike the 1976 remake, which tried to drag the story into the corporate present, Mr. Jackson's version returns it to the Great Depression, reminding us that the road to the multiplex stretches back through the music halls and burlesque houses of those bygone days.  Of course, this new "King Kong" (written by Mr. Jackson and his frequent collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) cost more than $200 million to make and can hardly be called scruffy. It arrives burdened with impossible expectations and harassed by competition from all sides. The director, who not so long ago was making low-budget monster movies in his native New Zealand, clearly wants to hold onto the artisanal, eccentric spirit of the past - his own and that of the art form he loves. But at the same time he must live up to the success of his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and prove to a glutted, gluttonous audience that large-scale, effects-driven filmmaking is still capable of novelty, freshness and emotional impact.  He succeeds through a combination of modesty and reckless glee, topping himself at every turn and reveling in his own showmanship. His "King Kong," though it has a few flourishes of tongue-in-cheek knowingness - including references to Cooper and Fay Wray and shots that directly quote the original - never feels self-conscious or arch. And though it presents the interspecies love story between Kong (Andy Serkis, who also plays a shipboard cook named Lumpy) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) with touching sincerity, the picture wears its themes lightly, waving away the somber, allegorical sententiousness that too many blockbusters ("Lord of the Rings" included) rely upon to justify their exorbitant costs. The movie is, almost by definition, too much - too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and over-the-top set pieces - but it is animated by an impish, generous grace. Three hours in the dark with a giant, angry ape should leave you feeling battered and exhausted, but "King Kong" is as memorable for its sweetness as for its sensationalism.  After setting a nostalgic mood with Art Deco titles and James Newton Howard's old-fashioned movie-palace overture, "King Kong" plunges into a New York of vaudeville houses, soup lines and Hooverville encampments. Ann, a winsome, wholesome hoofer, is performing in a threadbare revue that shuts down just as Carl Denham (Jack Black) loses the star of his next movie. Somehow, he entices not only Ann, but also her favorite playwright, the Barton Finkish Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), onto a rusty tub whose unsavory captain (Thomas Kretschmann) captures and transports exotic animals.  Denham's plan is to take his film crew - which also includes his anxious assistant (Colin Hanks) and lantern-jawed star (Kyle Chandler) - to Skull Island, where they will discover ...  Well, take a guess. The sea voyage is, for the most part, a diversion and a tease. Denham frets and schemes, Ann and Jack make tentative moves toward romance, and we also meet the noble first mate (Evan Parke) and his skittish young protÃ©gÃ© (Jamie Bell). The actors take evident pleasure in shedding the demands of naturalism and trying out an older, more emphatic screen style.  Mr. Black holds some of his clownishness in check and adapts some of his "School of Rock" monomania to the task of playing Mr. Jackson's alter ego. The rest of them mainly serve as dramatic fodder for the coming battles with Kong and the islanders.  First among these are the human Skull Islanders, whose grunting, wild-eyed savagery is one bit of nostalgia Mr. Jackson might have forgone. But their seaside settlement is soon abandoned for the island's green, craggy interior, which gives biodiversity a whole new meaning. There are enough dinosaurs to overrun Jurassic Park, and every kind of slithery, crawly, beetly thing you can imagine, as well as some you can't.  At times, the blending of computer-generated imagery and live action is pushed to a point where the seams begin to show, as in a Pamplona-style running of the brontosauruses, with various human actors darting between the legs of rampaging lizards. But two scenes are so madly inspired that they are likely to become touchstones: a three-way T-Rex versus Giant Ape  wrestling match in a deep ravine hung with vines, and a battle involving fanged worms and giant vampire crickets (at least I think that's what they were).  In this world, Kong, while certainly irascible, also shows himself to be a pretty evolved guy. Apparently the only nonhuman mammal on the island, he is a grumpy vegetarian who treats the people sacrificed to him as playthings rather than prey. He takes a special shine to Ann, not just because she is blond and lovely, but because of her  pratfalls and dance moves, which  turn out to be the universal basis of entertainment.  The rapport between Ms. Watts and Mr. Serkis is extraordinary, even though it is mediated by fur, latex, optical illusions and complicated effects. Mr. Serkis, who also played Gollum in the "Lord of the Rings" movies, is redefining screen acting for the digital age, while Ms. Watts incarnates the glamour and emotional directness of classical Hollywood. Together they form one of the most unlikely and affecting screen couples since Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina did their beast and beauty act in "La Strada."  Come to think of it, there is a touch of Fellini in Mr. Jackson's sentimental, ambivalent love of theater and spectacle. Returning to New York, "King Kong" evolves from jungle adventure to pop tragedy, as the big monkey becomes a symbol for ... well, for quite a few things, not all of them coherent. According to Denham, his captivity and display prove the power of show business to make the mysteries of creation available to anyone with the price of admission. In his mouth, this sounds both appealingly democratic and grossly cynical, which is fitting enough, since that is precisely the paradox Mr. Jackson embraces. He intuitively understands that the machinery of mass spectacle has the power to despoil and demystify whatever it touches and, at the same time, the ability to endow easy pleasures with a durable and genuine nobility.  The climax of "King Kong" - one of the most familiar sequences in movies, and one that never grows old - exemplifies both tendencies. It is shameless and exalted, absurd and sublime, vulgar and grand. It's what movies were made for.  "King Kong" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent action sequences and quite a few unhappy deaths.
That 10-ton gorilla in the room this holiday season is literally a 10-tonÂ—or maybe a 50-tonÂ—gorilla. "It's huge, it's huge!" I heard a colleague exclaim as the dust cleared.
Peter Jackson 's three-hour King Kong  remake is acutely self-conscious without being particularly self-reflective. Every kink in the 1933 originalÂ—a ballyhooed mÃ©lange of sex, carnage, sadism, racial weirdness, and special effects made by former expeditionary filmmakers Ernest B. Schoedsack  and Merian C. Cooper Â—is extravagantly normalized. Jackson's broad, beautifully designed, knowingly hokey, and ultimately exhausting super-production treats the mad love of a monstrous jungle ape for a sylph-like white woman (Naomi Watts ) as an episode of Sex and the City  , just a fatherless girl's search for the ultimate protector.
Destined for box-office glory, Jackson's Kong  can afford to revel in its tawdry Depression origins. The movie is set in the early '30s. The magical opening montage puts a Hooverville  in Central Park , conjures up streets limned by elevated trains and clogged with Model T's, and evokes a sense of desperate vaudeville in the person of Watts's gutsy hoofer. All period wonder is liquidated, however, with the introduction of Jack Black Â—the devious filmmaker who is bound for the mysterious Skull Island  in search of the Eighth Wonder of the World.
It takes Black's tramp steamer of mystery a full hour to even reach Skull IslandÂ—a mini Mordor replete with ruins, calcified skeletons, and prehistoric inhabitants deliquescing in the rain. Jackson doesn't really solve King Kong's "native" problemÂ—nor can he. The original was as much a symptom as a movieÂ—the most extravagant cinematic expression of white supremacy made in America since The Birth of a Nation  and perhaps the most delirious imperialist fantasy ever. Lose the spectacle of the white woman at the mercy of a savage horde and you lose the movie, although in keeping with Skull Island's decor, Jackson recasts the indigenous people as a mob of slavering aboriginal zombie orcs.
"In this film the Europeans show themselves, as usual, particularly repugnant," Jean Levy wrote approvingly of the '33 Kong  in the surrealist journal Minotaur . For the surrealists, Kong  achieved greatness in its second actÂ—when the action moves beyond Skull Island's barricade into the primeval jungle of pure instinct and unconscious desire. "Maybe American professors of palaeontology designed the models of the prehistoric monsters for Hollywood ," Levy noted. "Their spiritual father is none other than Max Ernst ."
The spiritual father for Jackson's dinos is, of course, Steven Spielberg , and Skull Island's interior is a second-rate, jumped-up Jurassic Park  of unrelenting dinosaur stampedes and interminable trapeze acts. Holding the white woman in one paw, the great ape fights three dinos at once, even as her human lover (Adrien Brody ) hacks his way through the creepy-crawlies. It's bio-class warfare to the maxÂ—a free-for-all pitting reptiles against mammals (primates actually) against insects and their mollusk allies. Primates prevailÂ—hoist high the opposable thumb, Roger!
Jackson's camera lavishes attention on Watts dashing through the jungle in a state of greater and greater dishabille. The only thing stronger than the spaghetti straps of her chemise will be Kong's love. (The striptease will never be consummated. There is nothing in the new Kong  to compare with the censored moment in the original when the ape rips off Fay Wray 's flimsy wrapper and then, curiosity aroused, sniffs his fingers.) Andy Serkis 's Kong is positively noble in repose, captivated less by the white woman's charms than her spunky vaudeville antics. Although Watts is always "acting," her adventures among the Effects cannot compare to those of Tilda Swinton , who, treating the cosmos as her personal blue screen, plays the White Witch of Narnia  with an Aryan hauteur worthy of Leni Riefenstahl .
Intermittently, Jackson attempts to dignify his material. But the repeated referencing of Heart of Darkness  is pointless. (For highfalutin tone, King Kong  is more a P.T. Barnum  version of Moby-Dick .) The director is on surer ground when he re-creates the 1933 movie's tom-tom savage dance routines for Kong's stage debutÂ—incorporating a chunk of the original the way a postmodern architect might appropriate the facade of a supplanted landmark. Speaking of which, midtown gets suitably trashed but Kong exerts an Aslanic effect on the big town. Hooverville is gone, Central Park filled with Christmas trees. In this enchanted landscape, KK and his petit w.w. take a magical spin on the ice and frisk in the snow.
She's down with the ape, but not all the way. For King Kong  is an accountant's movie at heart. Given the excessive length and bombastic F/X, there's too much action and precious little poetry.
