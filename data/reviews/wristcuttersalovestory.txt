The afterlife for those who refer to themselves as ''offed'' is a washed-out, dusty road to a SoCal nowhere in Wristcutters: A Love Story , a singular absurdist lark. But the residents are irresistibly hip, beginning with Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous ) as the title suicide, and not limited to Tom Waits as the crackpot leader of a utopian community  utopian at least by suicide standards. The whole film is cracked, but in a stylish, downtown way. And there's a tonic appearance by Arrested Development 's Will Arnett as...a (or is it the?) messiah. Heaven.

 The afterlife can be a difficult place to set a movie, especially a comedy. Apart from the inevitable lighting and labor issues, there is the risk of alienating viewers with sentimentality, implausibility or questionable metaphysics. Then again, when the conceit works, you may wind up with “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Defending Your Life” or the various iterations of “Heaven Can Wait.”  “Wristcutters: A Love Story” is not quite at that level; it’s more likely to live on as a cult favorite than as a consensus classic. But this movie, written and directed by Goran Dukic, a graduate of the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb, Croatia, and based on a  novella by the Israeli writer Etgar Keret, has an offbeat, absurdist charm that turns a potentially creepy conceit into an odd, touching adventure. The Sundance Film Festival (where “Wristcutters” first popped up in 2006, before vanishing into indie limbo) can be a breeding ground for studiously whimsical, willfully quirky films. “Wristcutters” belongs to a rarer species: it is genuinely eccentric.  At the beginning a mopey young man named Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts on a Tom Waits record — Mr. Waits himself will show up later — cleans his apartment, and commits suicide by the method suggested in the title. As a consequence of this act, apparently provoked by love trouble, he is plunged into a purgatory reserved for those unfortunate or impulsive souls who chose a similar exit.  It’s not a terrible existence, or nonexistence, as the case may be. For Zia, it’s a lot like the life he  quit, but “a little bit worse.” This netherworld, which looks like a shabby corner of the American Southwest, is a place of broken-down cars, hand-lettered signs and unflattering fluorescent lights. No one is able to smile and the stars are invisible. Still, a desultory society has taken shape. People compare notes on how, as they put it, they “offed”   (the title notwithstanding, some used nooses, guns or gas).  And since everyone is already dead, there’s no reason not to smoke a cigarette or drink a beer first thing in the morning.  Zia befriends Eugene (Shea Whigham), a failed musician and semi-successful ladies’ man whose loving Russian family has, oddly enough, accompanied him into this afterlife. Zia and Eugene, in the course of a road trip, meet up with Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), a lovely young woman who is trying to convince whoever is in charge of this world that she was sent there by mistake. Zia’s attraction to her is complicated by his search for his old girlfriend,  Desiree, who caused his self-destruction and seems to have followed it with her own.  And this is only the beginning. Mr. Waits shows up as a broken-down guru named Kneller (Mr. Keret’s story is called “Kneller’s Happy Campers”) and his appearance precipitates a swerve from dark comedy into wild spiritual allegory. One of the chief virtues of Mr. Dukic’s film — as well as a potential obstacle for nervous moviegoers — is that it conforms to no familiar pattern or genre. It seems to invent its own rules as it goes along, but with such low-key self-confidence that it takes a while to appreciate the full measure of its originality.  What makes it work is that the performers, trapped in a weird movie about a weird place, underplay their astonishment. Mr. Fugit, such a perfect, quiet witness to the rock ’n’ roll craziness of “Almost Famous,” shows a remarkable range of emotions against a ground bass of morose bewilderment, and Ms. Sossamon, moody and mercurial, is his perfect foil. Mr. Whigham seems to have drifted in from a Gogol short story by way of an Iggy Pop song, and Mr. Waits gives the whole strange, irresistible confection his scruffy, soulful blessing.  “Wristcutters: A Love Story” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and disturbing content involving suicide.

Suicide is very much a laughing matter in "Wristcutters: A Love Story," a genially warped road-trip comedy that imagines a special purgatory for those who have willfully departed the land of the living. Though its absurdist inventions occasionally border on twee, this affectionate slow-blooming romance mines an understated vein of comic melancholy that the actors' wistful performances perfectly capture. Prime specialty fare is sure to find passionate admirers in limited release and marks an auspicious feature debut for helmer Goran Dukic.
Zia (Patrick Fugit) awakes one morning, methodically cleans his room and, just as the opening credits have wrapped, slashes his wrists in his bathroom. A pan to a framed photo of his beautiful ex, Desiree (Leslie Bibb), more or less sums up why the kid's decided to end it all.
Except that he hasn't. Instead, Zia finds himself in a dusty afterlife that looks an awful lot like Bakersfield, the final destination for those who have "offed." Now making a living (so to speak) at a place called Kamikaze Pizza while sharing a ramshackle apartment with a large, temperamental stranger (Abraham Benrubi), he finds existence more or less the same as his previous life, "just a little worse."
Zia eventually befriends fellow suicide Eugene (Shea Whigham), a Russian ex-rock star and irascible malcontent whose whole family has managed to wind up in the suicide after-life. "Not every family is as lucky as we are," beams his mother (Mary Pat Gleason).
When Zia finds out that his beloved Desiree has also made her way to the afterlife, he and Eugene set off to find her in Eugene's car -- a lemon, held together with duct tape, that becomes a character in its own right. The similarities to "The Wizard of Oz" only deepen when they pick up a sassy hitchhiker named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon).
Adapted by the Croatian-born Dukic from Israeli writer Etgar Keret's 1998 short story "Kneller's Happy Campers," the film has an unmistakably Slavic sensibility that manifests itself in the morosely offbeat humor, the characters' names and composer Bobby Johnston's wry, flavorful original score.
Yet even at its weirdest, pic is grounded in the vivid and completely believable relationships that emerge among the three leads. Eugene, an aggressive horndog, makes no secret of his interest in Mikal, but she cozies up to shy, sensitive Zia.
Dukic elicits beautifully underplayed performances from his three leads, though Whigham's alternately infuriating and endearing Eugene does get some large laughs. Sossamon makes Mikal feisty and alluring in a resigned goth-girl kind of way, while 23-year-old Fugit, who's matured a lot since his road-movie debut "Almost Famous," effortlessly engages as the film's emotional glue.
Tom Waits delivers a juicy comic turn as the man who runs a utopian campsite that the threesome stumbles upon. But when Zia and Mikal wind up at the fortress of the Messiah ("Arrested Development's" Will Arnett, who gets a laugh just for showing up), the story's central conceit begins to wear out its charm, as the glum, resolutely low-key mood veers at times into the soporific. Fortunately, a quietly moving ending intervenes, and pic's existential punchline -- Zia has to die to figure out the meaning of life -- registers with poignant force.
Dingy interiors and dusty exteriors were all filmed in and around Southern California, combining with Vanja Cernjul's deliberately drab lensing to create a persuasive vision of Inland Empire hell. Exemplary makeup work ensures that the suicidal characters all look appropriately pale.

Wristcutters: A Love Story , a well-wrought indie written and directed by Goran Dukic , has to be the kewpie doll of current zombie flicks: Its walking dead are a bunch of attractive slackers whose wounds are largely internal. They've got attitude.
Before the opening credits end, the movie's glum protagonist has tidied his disheveled apartment and slashed his wrists. Zia (Patrick Fugit ) kills himself after breaking up with his girlfriend Desiree (Leslie Bibb ). But death does not bring oblivion. The ruling joke is that the afterlife is the same as the world of the living, only worse. Suicide is a form of downward mobility: The streets are shabbier, the colors less vibrant, the jobs lousier, and the people more depressed.
Thus, Zia finds himself living in a dump and working for a joint called Kamikaze Pizza. Trolling his neighborhood pick-up dive, he meets a wanly wild and crazy Russian rocker, Eugene  (Shea Whigham ), whose entire family has, as they say, offed themselves. An avid, if luckless, skirt chaser, Eugene hopes to enlist mopey Zia in his carousing. Zia, however, is still haunted by Desiree. Then he hears that she followed his suicide with her own and, excited by the prospect of a "Heartbreak Hotel" reconciliation, he and Eugene take to the road in Eugene's jalopy.
Roll up for the mystery tour. En route, the guys join forces with a spunky hitchhiker, Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon ), who denies that she has in fact killed herself and insists that she's the victim of a cosmic mistake. Aren't we all? The trio then falls in with a derelict magic clown named Kneller (Tom Waits ), who appears splayed out mid-highway, in search of his lost dog. Waits's affably gruff presence notwithstanding, the car radio plays nothing but tapes of Eugene's old band, which is actually the Gypsy punk ensemble Gogol Bordello . (The Russian is named for and made up to resemble Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hutz , even providing a suitably dispirited version of his manic mannerisms.) With Kneller in tow, minor random miracles occur: People float, fish turn colors, Eugene finds an Eskimo honey.
Sweeeeet , as a David Lynch  character might say. Press notes describe the movie's "quirky universe," but you don't need a publicist to see how snugly Wristcutters ' studied whimsy fits the tendency that Atlantic  columnist Michael Hirschorn  recently dubbed "Quirk" and unsympathetically deemed the "ruling sensibility of today's Gen-X indie culture." Hirschorn's prime exhibits were NPR 's This American Life , the cancelled sitcom Arrested Development  , Wes Anderson 's oeuvre, and performance artist Miranda July 's personasmugly post-ironic all. Such "mannered ingenuousness" is not, of course, exclusively American: Japanese writer Banana Yoshimoto  is arch enough to make Miranda July's teeth ache, and the post-Soviet Russian fabulist Victor Pelevin  practices a form of high quirk. So does Dukic's source, best-selling Israeli writer Etgar Keret .
As befits a serious quirkist, suicide is a prominent Keret preoccupation. He's often said that he turned to writing during his military service after his best friend killed himself. Adapting Keret's 1998 novella Kneller's Happy Campers , Dukic can't be accused of shying away from or failing to appreciate its morbid theme. But he does dilute it. Although hewing closely to Keret's story, faithful even to his sense of the disgusting, Dukic is unable to rise to the author's deadpan capacity for outraging the reader or find anything comparable to his disturbingly bleak and wistful voice a Woody Allen  whine with intimations of Kafka grottiness. (Born in Croatia , Dukic studied at the American Film Institute  and honed this project at the Sundance Screenwriters' Lab . Perhaps that accounts for the movie's uneasy mix of gallows humor and irrational optimism.) Dukic slaps the low-quirk label "love story" on Keret's melancholy fable. Yet, rather than betrayed, Keret feels embalmed. The movie is too well crafted: The visuals are insufficiently slapdash, Keret's meandering narrative made linear and lugubrious.
And yet, certain things translate. Ponder these dejected antics long enough and the low-quirk curtain parts. Keret's metaphor for Israel  comes through, as if from afarthe sense of displacement, the uncertain boundaries, the youthful alienation, the crummy beaches, the desert wandering, the military detritus, the Russian immigrants, the magic-realist kibbutz, and the enigmatic bureaucracy, not to mention the cult of the false Messiah King that figures in the final act.
Dukic sneaks a furtive reference to an Arab cab driver but not, as in the novella, a suicide bomber. And The Wizard of Oz  subtext is all Dukic's. That's the movies. Or maybe it's America, the place an MGM studio head once called a "happy-ending nation."
