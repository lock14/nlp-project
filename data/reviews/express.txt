You can keep your Mafia dons, your corrupt cops, your femme fatales, and your World War II sharpshooters. For my money, there�s no juicier role out there for an actor than the football coach. Those lucky enough to stumble into such a casting opportunity will be given free rein to be loud and demanding and ornery; possibly racist, sexist, and violent; even borderline sociopathic. Viewers don�t just forgive irascibility and barking dyspepsia in their movie coaches; they expect it. So playing one is a chance for an otherwise well-hinged star to really let lose and indulge his inner Archie Bunker. Take Dennis Quaid, who has made a living out of flashing a 100-kilowatt smile, but even he couldn�t resist the plum role of Ben Schwartzwalder, the decidedly uncharming (but impeccably named) head coach at Syracuse University from 1949 to '73. These were years that saw the team go from a garden-variety great-white-hope manufacturer to the home of African-American superstar Jim Brown (who would go on to become arguably the best football player of all time, one of the great social agitators in sports history, and an actor of incomparable gruffness) and the coming-out ground of Ernie Davis, the first African-American Heisman Trophy winner, who made a habit of breaking down racial barriers and defensive backfields before his untimely death from leukemia at the age of 23. Davis� story is the subject of Fleder�s new film, The Express
, and it�s a doozy, full of the kind of last-minute, heart-pumping stadium heroics and quiet acts of dignity we demand from our football films, mixed with heartbreaking historical incidents of violent racism that give viewers the chance to recoil in horror and indignation while resting uneasily in the hope that all that�s behind us now. (I feel it�s my responsibility, at this point, to warn local readers that the University of Texas comes off downright villainous in this movie; Longhorn fans everywhere should prepare themselves for the worst.) Though The Express
 may stretch the limits of probability, holding up Davis as an athletic superman incapable of losing, it�s also that rare sports film that isn�t afraid to dabble in personal and social ambiguity. Plus, it gives us the opportunity to lavish in the rumpled, distempered glory of Quaid�s Schwartzwalder, who grows from mere coach to symbol of early-1960s white America in only a few short years, a stubborn soul in a fedora and NASA-issued horn-rimmed glasses waking up slowly to the realities and possibilities of a bold new day.


If we continue to need tales of improbably successful athletics programs and life stories of professional athletes to lift us up (and surely we've had enough already), we also need the movies themselves to be distinguishable from each other. But Hollywood has a way of working its magic in reverse so that all the triumph in a story (an over-the-hill quarterback or pitcher comes back; the Podunk team wins a national championship) becomes cynically generic.
"The Express," which opens today, joins the club. This movie is especially egregious since it bundles the civil rights era, garden-variety bigotry, and the achievements of Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis never played a game in the NFL, dying of leukemia a year after signing a contract with the Cleveland Browns. His life may be sad, but it's inspiring. The drama depicting it is brutally dull: two hours of motivational talks ("I never set out to be the best Negro running back. I set out to be the best running back"), stiff performances, and game sequences.
The movie kicks off like a dutiful term paper. In a voice-over, Rob Brown, the flat but likable actor who plays Davis, tells us how many lines compose a football field and how there are "lines that run deeper through this country and that aren't part of any game." It's 1949 Pennsylvania, and young Davis (Justin Martin) is accosted on train tracks by a gang of 12 white boys. They mock his stutter and abuse him with slurs. But a flash twinkles in little Ernie's eyes, and he takes off running. God may have made him fast, the movie basically says, but racism made him faster.
Davis's estranged mother (Aunjanue Ellis) moves him to Elmira, N.Y. And starting in 1957, coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid, pouting and peacocking) will make Davis better yet. Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) drops by, on a recruitment mission, to tell him so. Brown has just signed a deal to play for the NFL in Cleveland, and Schwartzwalder prevails upon his problematic superstar player to talk Davis into coming to play for Syracuse. The movie hints at the complexity of Brown's natural truculence and the chip racism left on his shoulder. But "The Express" ultimately settles for making him a big glass of tall, dark, and handsome, a neutered personality deployed to spout platitudes.
There is so much ripe material here for a socially or historically curious movie. Davis gets to Syracuse while racial conflict roils the South, but what was a northern campus like during the civil rights movement, besides a living Woolworth's catalog? The filmmakers are more interested in making a safely commercial football drama that doesn't deviate from the genre's shorthand imagery and plot points.
It's entirely possible Davis was a perfect national sensation, that he played great Heisman-winning football, and then he never did anything else with his days beyond play football and serve as a credit to his race. But he couldn't have been as bland as "The Express" makes him out to be. Aside from managing to get made at all, the movie doesn't do Davis's legacy any favors by giving us the store-brand version of his life.


Has Dennis Quaid really never played a college football coach before? With his handsome, craggy face and likable intensity, he was born for the job, and he's the main attraction in The Express , an overlong 1960s-set biopic of Ernie Davis (Rob Brown), the famous Syracuse running back coached by Quaid's gruff (but kinda soft) Ben Schwartzwalder. The movie is structured all wrong  after the climactic Big Game, it rolls on for another 20 minutes  but Quaid delivers near the end. When Davis becomes the first African- American to win the Heisman, Quaid's choked-up reaction is the movie's high point. Even though it shouldn't be. B–

 “The Express” is an honorable example of a tried-and-true formula, squarely aimed at a presumably large cross-section of the moviegoing public: people who love football and hate racism. Like “Glory Road,” “The Great Debaters” and numerous other similar movies, it packages a real-life story of athletic triumph and social progress into an accessible, rousing melodrama that is no less potent for being almost entirely predictable.  And this is true even for viewers — the majority, I’d guess — whose knowledge of college football in the early 1960s is hazy or nonexistent. The pivotal moment in “The Express,” solidly directed by Gary Fleder, is the 1960 Cotton Bowl, where Syracuse faced the University of Texas. The Syracuse team, coming off an undefeated season, was notable for the presence of Ernie Davis, a supremely talented running back who would go on to become the first black winner of the Heisman trophy.  “The Express” is more or less a biography of Davis, played by Rob Brown in a likable if somewhat stiff performance. The stiffness comes in part from the script, by Charles Leavitt, which is more inclined toward homily than toward psychological nuance. Ernie, who overcomes a childhood stutter, is raised by his mother (Aunjanue Ellis) and especially his grandfather (Charles S. Dutton), a Pennsylvania coal miner. After a flurry of expository scenes that supply a basic sketch of the young man’s background and temperament, he arrives at Syracuse, where he falls under the tutelage of Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid), the gruff but decent head coach.  Davis faces a double challenge. Even though he is something of a pioneer — one of a handful of black students on campus (another is his teammate and friend Jack Buckley, played by Omar Benson Miller) — he also has to fill the shoes of Jim Brown, who preceded him as Syracuse’s star black rusher. Relations between Brown (Darrin DeWitt Henson) and his coach were not exactly harmonious, and Davis must deal with a legacy of tension and suspicion in the locker room and on the practice field.  He finds some time for romance (with a Cornell student played by Nicole Beharie) and for a death in the family, but most of “The Express” is taken up with alternating set pieces, the Big Game followed by the Big Scene in which prejudice is confronted and attitudes are changed. Davis, with his idealized mixture of stubbornness, amiability and grace, is both the film’s symbol of progress and its dramatic catalyst, but you don’t get much sense of his internal struggle. It’s the coach, and thus Mr. Quaid, who carries the main dramatic burden of undergoing a significant change.  The scenes in which racism erupts on the football field — including at that Cotton Bowl — are the most powerful, and the most effective in infusing sports nostalgia with a sense of historical consequence. The end of the film is inevitably somber — Ernie Davis’s life was foreshortened by leukemia — which adds to a general feeling of sentimental overload. But if a movie of this kind didn’t traffic in overstatement, it wouldn’t be doing its job, which is to provide a strong dose of simple, rousing emotion.  “The Express” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some moderately brutal football sequences, a few fights and strong language.

Crowdpleasing and oh-so-predictable, "The Express" is a muscular movie with social conscience that portrays Ernie Davis -- the first African-American collegian to win college football's coveted Heisman Trophy -- as the heir to Martin Luther King and Jackie Robinson. Rob Brown's performance in the title role is solid and static, but Dennis Quaid's portrayal of coach Ben Schwartzwalder provides a convincing metaphor for a nation going through a crisis of conscience. The sports theme may define the pic's aud, but emotional content could provide a crossover punch. 
Of course, it's not as if helmer Gary Fleder has a tough argument to make. That blacks were an oddity either in professional or college football as recently as the late 1950s seems as anachronistic as black-and-white TV. And anyone expecting Fleder ("Kiss the Girls," "Runaway Jury") to walk the sidelines of righteous indignation in telling Davis' story would probably expect an onside kick by a team up by 30.
Fleder's most electrifying sequences portray Schwartzwalder's unbeaten 1959 Syracuse U. team playing West Virginia and Texas -- not exactly two bastions of tolerance -- with a level of racist vitriol pouring out of the stands that is a topical reminder of America's racial heart of darkness.
"Keep your helmets on at all times," Schwartzwalder warns his players during the West Virginia game. Whether it's to conceal skin color or protect from flying bottles isn't clear.
Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley intermarries the onfield action, flashbacks to Davis' Southern boyhood, a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story: Even as a shy boy who stutters (played by Justin Martin), Davis is a prodigy. Elevated to the Varsity by Schwartzwalder during his freshman year, Davis thrives under the grueling regime enforced by his coach.
"I bet about now you're wondering what happened to that nice gentleman who came to your house and asked you to play for Syracuse," says a sweaty Jack Buckley (the terrific, funny Omar Benson Miller). Davis' agonies will not all be on the field, of course, but his talent triumphs even over the most racist of his teammates -- such as the belligerent Bob Lundy (Geoff Stults).
Fortunately, there's also a great deal of humor in the Charles Leavitt script, much of it playing off the presumptions and biases of the time. The great Jim Brown has just graduated, having been Schwartzwalder's greatest star, and a thorn in his side. Is it a new trend, Schwartzwalder asks an assistant, or just his bad luck that the best prospect on his list is a black kid. "It's a new trend," the assistant quips, signifying a changed era in sports, and one Schwartzwalder had better get used to.
He does. The development of the coach's character makes "The Express" a romance of sorts. Raised by his grandfather (the always brilliant Charles S. Dutton), Davis is vulnerable to exploitation by a father-like figure, but the relationship he develops with Schwartzwalder is far more complex, nurtured by a common love of the game, distanced by the politics of their time. "The Express" may have football as its locomotive, but there's a long train of national sorrow, hope and promise coming up behind.
Production values are major league.


The story of Syracuse  running back Ernie Davis —the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy , in 1961, two years before he succumbed to leukemia—is absolutely worthy of a big-screen retelling. Davis, who died before ever playing a down alongside Jim Brown  for the Cleveland Browns , has almost become a footnote—an inspirational fairy tale. Based on a Davis biography, Gary Fleder 's account is a noble attempt at humanizing the myth, but it succumbs to the worst sorts of sports-movie clichés: Its smash-mouth football scenes play like Gatorade  commercials, and off the field, its characters infuse every casual aside with the dramatic gravitas of History in the Making. To his credit, Rob Brown , first seen in 2000's Finding Forrester , plays Davis with quiet subtlety (to the point where he almost disappears in some scenes). But Dennis Quaid , as Syracuse's Ben Schwartzwalder , is stuck with the thankless role of accidental civil-rights pioneer—the gruff, color-blind coach who must nonetheless overcome his own ingrained racism and internalized fears. And, like all formulaic biopics, The Express  sacrifices the details for the Big Picture—hagiography without the humanity (wait, is that his girlfriend? Wife? What?), populated by sorta-enlightened Yankees, rabidly racist Southerners, and a ghost who remains as elusive as the running back no defender could ever catch.
