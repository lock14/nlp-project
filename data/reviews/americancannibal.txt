Reality TV often consists of greasy hybrids  it's The Osbournes  meets Andrew Dice Clay!  and this exposé of how the reality sausage gets made, is itself less than pure. American Cannibal: The Road to Reality  follows two writers, Gil Ripley and Dave Roberts (if it's possible to be smugly self-deprecating, that's these guys), as they pitch a who-will-lose-his-cherry series called Virgin Territory . (It's currently casting.) The ''documentary'' then turns into a didactic hoax, with a pilot for a Survivor -gone-cannibal show. The writers act shocked at how low they are stooping, but given their desire to write sitcoms, you have to wonder.

 Don’t fool yourself. Any brilliant idea you might have for a reality television series has probably already been imagined and pitched by go-getters like Dave Roberts and Gil S. Ripley, the hotshot comedy-writing team observed peddling their dubious wares in the documentary “American Cannibal.” As the movie observes  them tossing around outlandish concepts, then trying to interest jaded cable network executives in their trashy ideas, you are tempted to wonder if the documentary, directed by Perry Grebin and Michael Nigro, is a put-on.  One concept Mr. Roberts and Mr. Ripley invent: “Virgin Territories,”  in which  10 men, all certified  virgins, share a house where they are bombarded with pornography and tempted  by sexy female visitors but forbidden to touch either the women or themselves. The one who remains chaste the longest gets the ultimate reward: loss of his virginity with a porn star.  Never mind that some men might think that a paltry, if not a dangerously unhealthy, payoff. And never mind that the mechanics  of certifying male virginity  are never addressed, nor the methods of detecting furtive autoerotic release. It’s the thought that counts.  But the concept and its catchy slogan — “when you win it, you lose it” — fire the imagination of Kevin Blatt, a promoter who marketed the Paris Hilton sex tape and is eager to jump into the cesspool of reality television. Mr. Blatt is even more excited about another idea Mr. Roberts and Mr. Ripley pitch to him as a half-joking afterthought: “American Cannibal.” Contestants on this show would be transported to an island, starved and led to think that one of them would  be eaten. The details are never spelled out.  Mr. Blatt invests  $100,000 in development money. Potential contestants are interviewed,  told the show is called “Starvation Island” (minus the cannibal angle) and given a questionnaire in which they are asked if they would be able to eat their own fingers and toes.  For some people, it seems, nothing is too humiliating or painful if it gets them on television. The six finalists are flown with a camera crew to the island of Vieques, off Puerto Rico, to shoot a pilot, and George Gray (of “The Weakest Link”) is signed as host.  Almost immediately upon reaching the island, the project collapses from sloppy planning, union problems and an injury  to a contestant. As one thing after another goes wrong, the documentary itself is sabotaged by acts of God and legal problems. None of the tests  the contestants endure are shown, and the ultimate fate of the injured woman is left unclear.  The documentary illustrates the premise that if you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas. Until  everything collapses,  and the filmmakers are left grasping at straws, it’s absorbing in a sick way. The fact that all the people we see in the reality-TV  business appear to sneer at their own genre doesn’t excuse their culpability for perpetuating  that toxic phenomenon. Mr. Ripley, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Blatt, in particular, earn every failure and setback that comes their way.

Taking swipes at the reality show phenomenon is so easy that perhaps helmers Michael Nigro and Perry Grebin made a conscious decision to remain on the fence, but their nonjudgmental approach to "American Cannibal: The Road to Reality" fails to draw any conclusions and, thanks to legal issues, leaves too many questions unanswered. Although chronicling a show that pushes the envelope to extremes, docu is far too cautious in probing its contents, packed with sleazy promoters, fame-craving contestants and mocking sadists. A certain train-wreck fascination may result in limited bicoastal play, though cable seems the most likely outlet. 
Pic was conceived as a docu on pitching TV shows, but once the helmers met writers Gil Ripley and Dave Roberts pushing a sitcom on Comedy Central (pretty dire from the brief clip seen), they decided to stick with these honest but lost souls exploring the jungle of small screen salesmanship. Realizing that reality shows have become a behemoth devouring everything in sight, the two writers/friends brainstormed in search of something "mindless, simple and compelling" that would grab jaded producers.
After numerous rejections, they found Kevin Blatt, a porn tape promoter most famous for getting Paris Hilton's sex vid into millions of homes. Blatt is initially sold on the idea of "Virgin Territory," with its catchphrase, "When you win it, you lose it." But after thoughtful consideration, he decided something more mainstream would help change his image.
Blatt seized on an idea Ripley initially pitched as a lark: "American Cannibal," in which contestants are taken to an island and told that someone will end up being eaten. Suddenly the bluff becomes real, and Ripley and Roberts scramble for a viable outline. Realizing they're in over their heads, Ripley becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the direction his career is taking, while Roberts, with a wife and kids to support, is stoked to make some money.
Docu's most interesting element is watching the relationship between the two friends crumble as pressures mount to come up with progressively outrageous, sadistic stunts. It all came crashing down when one of the contestants was airlifted out in a coma.
Both the cause of the accident and the fate of the contestant remain a mystery, for legal reasons, but it's indicative of the callous nature of reality TV in general that no one except for the two outsiders really seem to care. Even helmers Nigro and Grebin move in for a closer shot of the bleeding woman before being shooed away, a distasteful moment that uncomfortably blends the lines between docu and subject matter.
Interspersed among the scenes are industry insiders and academics remarking on the reality TV phenomenon, largely defending the genre with callous cynicism dressed up as market research. Helmers seem drawn to uncomfortable moments, their roving steadycam seeking out the confrontational and lingering on uneasy silences. Tech credits are standard.

Desperation, onscreen and off, has been a key element of reality TV from the beginning, and no wonder. Whether it's seven strangers in a dorm-like condo or a dozen jocks on a remote island, this patently unglamorous, formally sketchy, verily flopsweating genre exploits our lumpen identification with the ordinary schmoes who'd stop at nothing to yank airtime away from bona fide celebs. "Real life" is one big game show, and the underdogsUPN includedrefuse to play by the rules. Would you believe Amish in the City ? How 'bout Extraterrestrial in the City ?
Pop will eat itself as always, but even more scavenging these days might be the indie film, its audience thinned to near-nonexistence by small-screen fare. Case in point: American Cannibal , a reality-style movie about the making of a reality show that was maybe almost aired. It follows two hungry young hustlers who pitch a porno financier on their virgin conceptkids competing not  to get laidbut who instead take his money to concoct a sick Survivor wherein starving contestants are faced with the prospect of feeding on one another. The film begins in requisite shaky-cam mode with the revelation that The Ultimate Ultimate Challenge , shot on an island off the coast of Puerto Rico (but never completed), put one of its would-be cannibals in a vegetative state before blacking out itself.
For real? Does it matter? American Cannibal screened in the documentary category of last year's Tribeca fest and immediately drew skepticism. The Times  reported that at least two of the movie's main subjects were given pseudonyms, and quoted filmmaker Perry Grebin 's vague description of an aesthetic other than vérité: "We created scenarios in which events unfolded, over which we did not have control, which is very consistent with the documentary tradition." In fact, scenario-creation would seem more consistent with the tradition of reality TV, if not flat-out fiction.
Grebin and co-director Michael Nigro , whose collective résumé includes work in playwriting, publicity, criticism, and screenwriting instruction, may or may not be documentarians. But they can at least be credited with provoking the question of whether cinema should continue being held to higher standards than television when it comes to delineating what's real. You may recall that Rupert Murray , maker of 2005's purportedly authentic doc Unknown White Male , was practically put through psychiatric evaluation by film critics, whereas MTV 's superstar producer Jon Murray , one of American Cannibal 's bemused talking heads, could seemingly get away with murder in The Real World  .
In any case, American Cannibal , something like the (mock-)doc equivalent of The Producers , really, really should've been funnier. Its Bialystock and Bloom identified here as Dave Roberts  and Gil Ripley  of KanDu! Productionscome across as mere frat house hopefuls on a pledge-week dare to infiltrate the biz. Not even their pretensions stand up to scrutiny, as the oversized Godard poster in their office keeps falling behind the couch. Frenzied reality pitches to Comedy Central  and the IFC fall short of the plate, so the pair proceeds to Kevin Blatt , the colorful character who moved 700,000 units of One Night in Paris , a/k/a the Paris Hilton  sex tape. Blatt also boasts of having auctioned a porn star's surgically severed genitals on the Internet.
"We are a giant industry of pimps and whores," muses Blatt, who passes on the boys' "medically verified male virgins" concept, but throws in a hundred grand for KanDu!'s Ultimate Ultimate  pilot, the Vieques Island  escapade in which everything goes wrong. The would-be survivalist contestants mysteriously take ill after a single hour of production. The Screen Actors Guild , objecting to host George Gray 's participation in a non-union show, throws down an ultimate-ultimate challenge of its own. Ripley, believe it or not, is reduced to tears after learning that one of his hunger artists has collapsed, possibly from hypoglycemia. "I don't even know what happened," he says, "and it's totally our fault!" Something on the island smells fishy. Not even television's most pathologically truthful realist would take responsibility while tape is rolling.
For all we know, the fear factor might have been even higher on the Ultimate Ultimate  shoot, but, as a title card informs us, "The production's insurance rules prohibit the documentary crew from recording any challenge events." Funny those same rules somehow didn't prohibit the producers from planning to starve their contestants and force them to consider eating human flesh to survive. While creating their scenarios, Grebin and Nigro might've considered a Springtime for Hitler   ending wherein KanDu!'s surefire flop becomes a hit. But that would likely have required a little more reality than the filmmakers had available.
