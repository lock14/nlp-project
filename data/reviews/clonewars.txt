Remember, a long time ago, when the most powerful agent in George Lucas� universe was the Force? Remember how simple and compelling the idea was? A faceless, benevolent energy binding the galaxy together, fueling good and fighting evil, and easily interchangeable with whatever mealy-mouthed spiritual half-traditions audiences were comfortable with? Then came The Phantom Menace
 and Attack of the Clones
 and Revenge of the Sith
, and suddenly the greatest power in Lucas� cosmology wasn�t the Force but endless, grinding exposition spread thick over soulless technological flimflammery, leaving anything resembling wonder or excitement out in the cold. Well, with Lucas� new animated prequel/sequel, The Clone Wars
 (which takes place between the events of Attack
 and Revenge
), there�s a brand-new power rearing its ugly head, and it�s a beast more horrible and more terrifying than Darth Vader could ever hope to be: the tween girl. (It squeals! It texts! It shops! It consumes everything it sees!) In our new tween-dominated star economy, with Miley Cyrus and other Disney Channel starlets printing money, I suppose it was inevitable that the shamelessly market-savvy Lucas would seize an opportunity to do the same. Enter Ahsoka Tano, a sassy young Padawan, or apprentice Jedi, who arrives (looking like a chorus member from The Lion King
 stage show) to study under the future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, who�s busy leading the clone armies of the Republic against the droid armies of the evil Separatists while trying to secure the safe return of gangster Jabba the Hutt�s infant son, who was kidnapped by Separatist leader and Jedi-gone-spoiled Count Dooku in an attempt to frame the Jedi and convince Jabba to open his trade routes to the Separatist army, thereby clearing the way for total galactic domination � not that any of that matters. Story is entirely insignificant in The Clone Wars
, as it has been in the Star Wars
 universe since the closing credits of Return of the Jedi
. The only important thing is that viewers are blown away by the movie�s endless and pointless laser battles and that young Ahsoka has as much super, sassy, awesome, girl-powered fun as possible bounding about and cutting down droids by the dozen, while still finding time to call Skywalker �Sky Guy,� nickname Jabba�s son �Stinky,� and declare, in the spirit of original teen-girl heroine Barbie, �Being a Padawan is tough.� That and math, Ahsoka, that and math.


Not every "Star Wars" episode is an event. Remember those mid-'80s Ewoks TV spin-offs? The colorful, computer-animated "Clone Wars" aims higher, but in the end, it's a Cartoon Network pilot that's been dropped into a decidedly un-eventful late-summer release slot. (The ongoing TV series hits cable this fall.) It's also the latest example of how the franchise keeps frustratingly spurning the magical simplicity of the original trilogy.
Set in the narrative gap between the live-action "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith," the story spotlights a pre-Vader Anakin Skywalker ("Heroes
" bit player Matt Lanter) and his new female apprentice, Ahsoka (Ashley Eckstein of the Disney Channel's "That's So Raven"). Their mission: to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped slug, er, son. Anakin isn't corrupted yet, just peeved about his unwanted gig as Jedi tutor; Ahsoka is sk8er-grrrl spunky, insists on calling him "Sky-guy," and has patterned terra cotta skin that makes her look world-culture hip (if a bit like Navajo pottery). In other words, they're unlikely buddy cops. Let the bickering and adventure commence.
There's a lot of exposition, particularly in the movie's first half, about the Jedi needing to make nice with Jabba to ensure that he's on the Republic's side in the escalating clash with the Separatists. But we're also reminded that the Separatists and nefarious Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) are actually in cahoots with the future emperor. And so we're right back to the needlessly convoluted conflict that was just as problematic for the prequel trilogy as stiff performances or Jar Jar Binks (not present here). Once again, even reasonably committed fans will need a scorecard to keep track of who's fighting whom. What's the real target audience - i.e. kids - supposed to make of it all?
That said, the PG crowd should get a charge out of the hyperactive battle imagery, which feels less like overload here than it did when it was meshed with the prequels' live action. Sure, the characters are curiously rendered in the style of "Thunderbirds" marionettes. (What was wrong with the 2-D design work by creator Genndy Tartakovsky on Cartoon Network's previous "Clone Wars" series?) But a vertical firefight sequence with beetle tanks crawling up a sheer rock face is inspired. And a desert duel between Anakin and Dooku by the light of multiple silvery moons lends new energy to the requisite lightsaber-swinging.
But oh, the larger opportunity missed. There's a reason that children of the '70s recall "Star Wars" so vividly: The concept was pure. It was the Rebel Alliance versus the Empire, and if the rebels blew up the Death Star, they won. With "Clone Wars," we're hit with big-picture conflict that's about as rousingly black-and-white as a breakdown of the US's Iraq exit strategy. And when the movie finally relents with its labyrinthine politics, the dramatic goal that comes into focus is . . . Jedi Knights with a Huttlet nicknamed "Stinky" squished into a BabyBjörn, on a quest to get the little bugger home safe. Fun, but not exactly an event.


George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun. This all-animated chapter Star Wars: The Clone Wars  sounds like a perversely logical evolution of the series, which has been built around increasingly thick gobs of digital eye candy. But you never knew how much you'd miss all that lousy, wooden human acting. The animated Anakin, Obi-Wan, etc. (all with faux movie-star voices) are drones, and the repetitive combat sequences only add to the turgid videogame anonymity of it all. Lucas' fantasy empire has morphed into a machine that plays itself.

 Expectations were set so low by George Lucas’s lousy trilogy of “Star Wars” prequels that the latest from the Lucasfilm factory, a feature-length digital animation called “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” comes as something of a surprise: it isn’t the most painful movie of the year!  Set between Episodes II and III, this new “Star Wars” saga (II.5?) completes the franchise’s divorce from photography-based cinema, as well as from any relationship to credible human feeling.  As a mechanical thrill ride, however, “The Clone Wars” has an uncluttered look and furious pace that make it more or less as satisfying as its wildly overdesigned predecessors, although it’s neither as agile nor as well made as the terrific series of short, traditionally animated “Clone Wars” installments shown on the Cartoon Network from 2003 to 2005.  The director, Dave Filoni, has cited “Thunderbirds,” the 1960s British animation series with marionettes, as an inspiration for the, uh, wooden style of his picture, but the stiff, self-important characterizations; corny space-war talk; and overheated militarism kept reminding me of “Team America: World Police.”  No more than a pretext for exploding robots and light-saber duels, the plot concerns the efforts of Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, his neophyte sidekick, to secure a fragile alliance by retrieving Jabba the Hutt’s baby son from the double-crossing clutches of Count Dooku, blah, blah, blah. Exploding robots!  “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bloodless sci-fi mayhem.

"Star Wars: The Clone Wars" will serve its purpose as a quick fix for die-hard fans who simply can't wait for the new Cartoon Network show to debut on Oct. 3. This first theatrical production from Lucasfilm Animation purportedly reps a synthesis of the series' first three episodes -- 30 installments are finished and at least 100 are planned -- and there's little doubt this stuff will look more at home on the tube than it does on the bigscreen, since one thing is for sure: This isn't the "Star Wars" we've always known and at least sometimes loved. Young kids will constitute the biggest audience for this Warner Bros. release -- it's downright weird not to see the Fox logo on a "Star Wars" feature -- while devotees old enough to have seen the originals on their first go-round will likely wait to check out this strip-mining of one of the cinema's most enduring mother lodes at home.
Series trivia freaks will note that the clone wars were glancingly referred to in the very first "Star Wars" film, but didn't really come up again until "Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones." Conflicts in question were set in the three-year period between the events of that film and "Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith," and resulted in the long-standing Republic coming under the increased control of the Separatists to become an empire.
One could say that excluding them from the bigscreen "Star Wars" saga was the equivalent of writing the history of the United States and leaving out the Civil War. The omission, however, left Lucas and his cohorts with the opportunity to invent a virtually endless array of battles, which is what "Clone Wars" mostly consists of: a little exposition, an invasion; some more exposition, a light saber fight; a bit more blah-blah, a spaceship dogfight, and on and on.
Leaving behind the traditional animation employed on the three-season, similarly combat-oriented "Star Wars: Clone Wars" series aired on the Cartoon Network 2003-05, Lucas & Co. here employ a computer-generated anime/manga style that results in somewhat more dramatic compositions and color schemes. But the movements, both of the characters and the compositions, look mechanical, and the mostly familiar characters have all the facial expressiveness of Easter Island statues.
Given that the Anakin-into-Darth Vader story arc has been milked for all it's worth, Dark Side villainy is here assumed by the estimable Count Dooku, all of whose energies are devoted to expanding the influence of the Separatists and the power of the droid army. Happily, Christopher Lee was induced to return to endow the role with his inimitable basso inflections, providing one of the film's greater pleasures.
Less crucially, Samuel L. Jackson and the perennial Anthony Daniels voice their original roles of Mace Windu and C-3PO, respectively. Most of the other voicings are OK -- the declamatory dialogue makes few demands -- but Frank Oz is sorely missed as Yoda, whose replacement, Tom Kane, sounds little like him.
With the droid armies on the move, young Anakin Skywalker is paired with a foxy, red-skinned, blue-eyed, Egyptian-style teenager, Ahsoka Tano. This previously (if briefly) seen subject of Queen Padme learns on the job as Anakin takes on a videogame's worth of adversaries while attempting to find, then return, the kidnapped infant son of the infamous Jabba the Hutt.
The expansion of the Hutt clan reps the script's most diverting aspect. The mere idea of the corpulent, nasty old Jabba fathering a sprig is itself amusing, and the offspring, variously referred to as Rotta the Huttlet and Stinko, resembles a wriggling turnip with eyes. Dooku manipulates Jabba and his relative Ziro, imaginatively etched as a melodramatic Southern queen, into believing the Jedi mean to betray the Hutts, and sends a stealthy assassin, the sleek Asajj Ventress, to take out Anakin. 
With his sculpted beard, light saber in hand and arm pointing forward like a Greek statue, the newly minted Obi-Wan Kenobi looks like he belongs in "300" rather than at the controls of a spaceship. 
Director Dave Filoni, who helmed the visually imaginative Nickelodeon animated series "Avatar: The Last Airbender," seems at home with Lucas' universe, which is a good thing, since he's the supervising director of the upcoming "Clone Wars" series. One can only hope the writers find intriguing tangents and backwaters to enter as the program progresses, rather than being forced to crank out a battle-to-end-all-battles every seven minutes.
Employing a reorchestrated version of John Williams' trademark theme at the beginning and the end, the score by new composer Kevin Kiner is never absent even for a moment; he's tried to associate every realm depicted with its own theme, but settings come and go so quickly that nothing sticks around long enough to resonate.
