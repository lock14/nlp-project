"Music Within" brings us the true story of Richard Pimentel, the trailblazer who helped write the book on helping the disabled enter the workplace and influenced the passing of the Americans With Disabilities Act. It's everything it ought to be: right-minded, well-intentioned, compassionate. But it doesn't rise above made-for-cable public service announcement, either. Written by Bret McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen, and Kelly Kennemer, directed by Steven Sawalich, and narrated incessantly by Ron Livingston, who plays Pimentel, "Music Within" leans on biographical boilerplate to tell his story. So it's purpose-oriented but bland. There is the chance, however, to see Livingston age from about 22 to 41 without the apparent aid of special effects.
Pimentel was born in Portland, Ore., in 1947 to a mentally ill mother (Rebecca De Mornay, overwrought) who sent him to a foster home. ("I was passed around like an unwanted Christmas fruitcake," he narrates.) Eventually, young Richard discovers he wants to be a public speaker, wins a number of high school oration contests, and, by 1969, enrolls in college. The university's speech coach (Hector Elizondo) tells him he lacks conviction and that he ought to "earn a point of view." So Richard joins the Army and goes to Vietnam, where he loses his hearing.
Because the filmmakers choose to depict Pimentel as a righteously driven man with a cause, the movie doesn't go very deep into Pimentel's trauma. Things seem at their worst for him in a scene where Richard can't hear a post-class discussion about Ken Kesey. But "Music Within" is a can-do movie, so in the next scene he learns to read lips. Not much later he forms a fast friendship with Art (Michael Sheen), a genius student with cerebral palsy whose deliberate speech Richard can actually hear. One afternoon he loses his grip on Art's wheelchair at a roller rink, and what do you know. It hits Christine (Melissa George), the sexually liberated woman with whom Richard will spend the rest of the movie.
The story dutifully hits all the highlights. Richard quits his insurance agency job to help other veterans find work. He stands up for Art against a nasty restaurant waitress. He turns to Elizondo to help him craft his manifesto, and Elizondo, playing someone on lithium, tells us what this movie is all about: "You don't need to change people's minds about disability. You need to change people's minds about themselves." And so the rest of "Music Within" is devoted to Richard's lecturing, speechifying, and right-hook judgments ("Buy yourself a conscience!").
None of this can happen without some melodrama. As Richard successfully changes attitudes toward the disabled, his personal relationships take an obligatory nosedive and his formerly tidy, vice-less house becomes a mess. Whose overflowing ashtray is that, anyway? And, yeah, how did Art let himself into the living room? Some of the performances aren't bad. Sheen, who played Tony Blair in "The Queen," actually manages the difficult feat of being technically impressive and quite moving. Meanwhile, Livingston confidently smoothes over the movie's cliches as though he doesn't know that's what they are.


 A bad movie with a good heart, “Music Within” is a biography  of Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston), a debating champion who suffered severe hearing damage   in Vietnam, then reinvented himself as an activist for the handicapped.  Mr. Livingston sells this war hero’s patience, work ethic and independent spirit. But he fails to illuminate Mr. Pimentel’s anger and melancholy, qualities that the film credits with spurring his alcoholism, destroying his marriage to a hippie-swinger-turned-domestic-martyr named Christine (Melissa George) and fueling his greatest accomplishments (including the writing of  a California State guideline for dealing with  disabled  job applicants, and agitating on behalf of the Americans With Disabilities Act).  The film’s sound design inventively suggests how its hero hears the world, and Mr. Pimentel’s relationships with his best friends — Art Honneyman (Michael Sheen), a puckish man with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair, and Mike Stolz (Yul Vázquez), a hot-tempered, profanely funny fellow vet  — feel lived-in and real.  But the film’s direction, by Steven Sawalich, and its screenplay, credited to Bret McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen and Kelly Kennemer, are annoyingly unimaginative. When the screen fills with shots of soldiers in helicopters scored to “We’ve Got to Get Out of This Place,” you may be inclined to agree.  “Music Within” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language including sexual references, and some drug content.

�Music Within,� the decidedly �70s-flavored story of Richard Pimentel, the motivational speaker and writer who helped pass the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, convincingly delivers the message that disabilities are everyone�s concern. Helmed by Steve Sawalich, this real-life dramedy is anchored by Michael Sheen�s captivating performance as the severely handicapped, profoundly acerbic Art Honeyman. Commercial response should be modest but passionate. 
A bit soft around the edges -- Ron Livingston as Pimentel is a sympathetic but puppyish leading man -- the picture wastes no time making its point: Richard is more or less victimized at birth by what can be described as betrayal by the human body and mind: His mother (Rebecca De Mornay) has suffered seven miscarriages by the time he�s born, and the effect is to send her into a disturbed mental state that dictates the course of Richard�s childhood. 
As a young man, Richard discovers a talent for public speaking, but when he auditions for �College Bowl� founder Dr. Ben Padrow (an imperious Hector Elizondo), he�s told in no uncertain terms that he needs to have a life before he can convince others of his point of view. Richard thinks he�s had a life. But he joins the Army, goes to Vietnam and, during a shelling of his platoon, loses his hearing.  
Accompanied by some very deliberately programmed and too obvious period music -- including the unwelcome bleatings of Three Dog Night, America and the Youngbloods -- Richard returns to college, where he meets Art (Sheen), a wheelchair-bound, beret-wearing verbal bomb-thrower, who is wracked by cerebral palsy but harbors a caustic wit and a hilarious gift for obscenity. Ironically, Richard�s deafness allows to him understand Art, so a social movement of two is born, as they get kicked out of restaurants, endure the contemptuous glances of passersby and are generally ostracized by a public horrified or disgusted by Art�s writhing incoherence.
�Music Within� is less than subtle about the way people were treated before and after the Disabilities Act, and depending on one�s tolerance for overstatement, the film might tread a bit heavily on the moral outrage. But Sheen (best known for playing Tony Blair in �The Queen� and David Frost in �Frost/Nixon�) is remarkable -- one of the film�s stratagems is that Art is made understandable through Richard�s eyes and damaged ears, but a garble otherwise. So Sheen is really required to give two technically difficult performances. He�s utterly convincing, and the humanity he brings to the part only helps drive home the film�s social issues.
Script by Brett McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen and Kelly Kennemer is good, but just sort of cobbles together a romantic subplot, between Richard and beautiful free-love advocate Christine (Melissa George), who fail to find a meeting ground for their mutual affection. In a smaller but essential role, Yul Vazquez turns Mike Stoltz, one of Richard�s fellow vets, into an intemperate alcoholic firebrand. After Sheen, Vasquez is the best thing in the film. 
Production values are adequate, but �Music Within� was always a film that was going to rely on heart rather than craft.


There's no disputing the sincerity with which Steven Sawalich  tells the true-life tale of Richard Pimentel , the man more or less behind the Americans with Disabilities Act . His is, without question, a story worth telling: Cocky kid thinks he'll make a great motivational speaker, professor tells him he's "full of shit" and needs to go live a little, kid goes to Vietnam  and nearly dies a lot, then returns home all but deafthe whole world sounds like it's underwater and populated by a billion whistles being blown at once. And Ron Livingston , deadpan batshit in Office Space  and stoically heroic in Band of Brothers , is the perfect dude for the role; you want  to believe in him. But a little earnestness goes a long way, and Music Within  has a little too much of it, down to the casting of Michael Sheen  (The Queen 's Tony Blair ) as the wheelchair-bound savant with cerebral palsy who acts as Richard's muse and conscience. Sheen, like the movie itself, is trying too hard to inspire when the story doesn't need the help.
