Of the many, many movies  the great, the splattery, the choreographed, the profound  that have explored the lives of samurai warriors, the dramas of 74-year-old Yoji Yamada may come closer than anyone's to demystifying Japan's feudal nomad swordsmen, portraying these lone-wolf aristocrats of honor not as mythical action figures but merely as regular, vulnerable folks, as men. Masatoshi Nagase, who you may recognize as one of the two Japanese Elvis fans in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train , plays Katagiri, a stoic lower-caste samurai of the mid-19th century who is ordered by his clan to kill an old comrade. He wants no part of it, yet what we see (and he doesn't) is that this thankless task is precisely what he needs to spur him past his reticence toward Kie (Takako Matsu), the family maid he's in love with. The Hidden Blade  is tranquil, touching, and, in its climactic sword fight, excitingly real.

 When the veteran filmmaker Yoji Yamada makes a samurai movie, his warriors don't fly through the air on invisible wires or confront multiple foes while dancing from one tree to another. They have too many burdens — poverty, conscience, obedience to their clan — and the struggles of daily life leave little time for frivolous swordplay. So when violence does occur, it's solidly earthbound and staged with magnificent solemnity.  Mr. Yamada wants us to feel the moral weight of taking a life.  Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, "The Hidden Blade" focuses on Katagiri (Masatoshi Nagase), a gentle samurai troubled by his forbidden love for a low-caste servant girl (Takako Matsu) and confused by his clan's transition from swords to Western artillery. When an old friend is arrested for plotting against the Shogunate, Katagiri is ordered to kill him; but the assignment forces our shabby hero to follow his conscience, confront his corrupt clan lord and ultimately question the rules he lives and loves by.  Though less powerful than Mr. Yamada's "Twilight Samurai" (2002), "The Hidden Blade" is an affecting portrait of the impact of profound change on people with limited options. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, where necessities like food and medicine eclipse battles and bravery, Mr. Yamada is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life.  "The Hidden Blade" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).There's a hint of sex, some ponderous swordplay and a single, effective bullet.  The Hidden Blade 
An all but unknown quantity in North America, septuagenarian workaholic Yoji Yamada  appeared on our doorstep two years ago with The Twilight Samurai  (2002), which was only the 66th feature in a filmography dominated by the 46 romantic comedies in the contemporary "Tora-San" series. A radical departure for him and for the Japanese imports we see, Twilight  is a mature, brooding, revisionist samurai epic, executed with unpretentious expertise. Every shot in the film counts, narratively and emotionally. The genre itself was treated to a colon cleansing Yamada's 19th-century shogun functionaries are haunted less by honor and courage than clan politics, financial problems, managerial humiliation, and prescripted hara-kiri. Constructed as a concise yet organic contest between happiness and society, Twilight  was a rueful and respectful gift, oddly Oscar nominated but otherwise ungratefully received.
While still rapping out comedy series scripts, Yamada has now crafted a follow-up, returning with The Hidden Blade  even more conscientiously to the fading dusk of the samurai era, when artillery and modern military methods began to change the manner of war and render swordsman norms obsolete. From the beginning Yamada's movie, made in 2004, looks and feels more like a John Ford  western than any other Asian film I've ever seenwithout the tavern yuks, racism, and glut of stereotypes. The compositions are functional and stately, the battles are fought at a dignified distance (we aren't made to feel  them with amphetaminic editing, but of course we feel them even more clearly), and the measured rituals of home and duty are treated with reverence.
Derived, as was Twilight , from a Shuuhei Fujisawa novel, the narrative has an inevitable but natural frontier logic, and boils down to the tender moral sphere of Munezo (Masatoshi Nagase , his wary stare having accumulated gravity in the 15 years since Jim Jarmusch 's Mystery Train ), a low-level samurai pining for his family's maid Kie (Takako Matsu ). Again, nothing is as ruinous in the social fabric as feudal class distinctions. As his clan slowly struggles with the adoption of gun warfare, Munezo watches Kie get married away, and then learns a few years on that she is a slave in her new home, sickly and abused. Worrisomely violating the first of many conduct codes, Munezo charges in and rescues her; back at the homestead, Kie's nursed back to health and again becomes the family's servant.
Her lower station forbids marriage, and as the couple's story begins to hit the brick wall of propriety, a parallel thread emerges, forcing Munezo to confront his Hamletian stasis: An old friend is brought back to town in a cage, arrested as a usurper. Munezo is accused of consorting with the renegade and is even pressured, HUAC-style, to inform on mutual friends, before the prisoner escapes and Munezo is commanded to settle the business for both his own good and that of the corrupt clan.
The air of ethical crisis is germane to the western even more so than to the samurai genre, and The Hidden Blade  evokes the cream of the FordAnthony MannBudd Boetticher  prairie dramas along the way. (The homegrown traditions aren't slighted, however; familiar Japanese images, such as the careful arrangement of characters standing on a hillside and gazing off frame, are returned to like holy icons.) Yamada's decidedly undazzling yet expressive filmmaking approaches classicism, from a sensei training session captured in one lengthy shot to the final showdown, seen with shifting points of view that suggest a relativist unease with the cut-and-dried judgments of war culture.
