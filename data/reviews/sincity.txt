Let�s not mince words: Sin City
 kicks ass. You�ll have to excuse the language, but, in the context of the film, it�s entirely appropriate. Honestly, this ultra-noir adaptation of Frank Miller�s black-and-white cult comic series is a visual feast ripped straight from the original medium�s blood-soaked pages. It�s a total immersion in Miller�s grim, gin-soaked dystopian world, aided and abetted by Austin�s Robert Rodriguez (and shot here at his own studio) with an assist from honorary townie Tarantino that simply makes every other comic book adaptation yet filmed seem downright tedious. If you�re not familiar with Miller�s work, we�ll just say he�s the writer/artist who re-imagined Batman
 as The Dark Knight Returns
, brought a shopworn Daredevil
 into the dark of day, and created this shockingly good homage to the hard-boiled antiheroes of pulp fiction: part Mickey Spillane machismo run amok, part Dashiell Hammett stripped down to the bare-knuckle essentials. The closest contemporary parallel might be Andrew Vachss� gritty Burke
 novels, but even they fall short of Miller�s mega-masculine mark. Working with a dream cast who performed nearly all of their roles in front of nonexistent green-screen backgrounds that were added later via CGI, Sin City
�s look and feel is genuinely unique. And, again let�s not mince words, it�s also an incredibly violent tale of love and death, retribution and absolution, both immoral to the core and almost biblical in its Old Testament prescripts of eyeballs for eyeballs. Presented as a triptych of interrelated stories all set in and around the Gotham-esque burg of the title, Rodriguez and company have mined the best of Miller�s work and come up aces. It�s not just the top-notch (over)acting and dialogue, which, it bears noting, is so hard-boiled you could shatter a molar on it, but also Rodriguez�s daring use of color in an otherwise black-and-white epic. There are hints of flesh tones here and there, but it�s the red stuff � spraying, dripping, jetting, pooling � that is most prevalent. In terms of story, it�s Miller Time and then some: Willis plays Hartigan, the Last Honest Cop, who is on the trail of Nick Stahl�s foul-as-dog-waste rapist-murderer, and spends his time in pursuit of the truth only to find it biting him on the keister in the endgame. Rourke, made up to look like the world�s meanest barroom brawler, plays Marv, a streetwise tough who wakes up one morning to find the dead hooker Goldie (King) in his bed and the cops on his tail. And then there�s Dwight (Owen), a career criminal with a soft spot for the city�s legions of fallen women (among them Devon Aoki�s spirited Mijo and Dawson�s materfamilias Gail), and a new face to boot. All three overlapping storylines are united not by one another, as you might expect, but by Rodriguez and Miller�s inventive, purely cinematic use of imagery, nearly all of which is lifted directly from Miller�s original artwork-cum-storyboards. The end result is a one-of-a-kind film that�s both incredibly offensive and undeniably entertaining, using casual misogyny and offhanded amorality much like its direct literary forebear Mickey Spillane. It should go without saying (but I�ll say it anyway) that this isn�t going to be everybody�s cup of tea. For those who enjoy their tough-guy testosterone straight up, no chaser, it�s a 120-proof sucker punch to the cinematic solar plexus.


It's been a long three months, but the dry season is over: ''Sin City" is the first great Hollywood joy ride of the year. Hyperstylized and ultra-ultra-violent, this adaptation of Frank Miller's two-fisted cult comic book series barrels through a black-and-white moral landscape like a runaway bullet train, and it makes no stops for those with delicate constitutions to stagger off.
The film is proudly sensationalistic and hellaciously incorrect, but as directed by Robert Rodriguez and Miller himself (with a guest assist from Quentin Tarantino), it's also a stunning, visceral piece of work -- cheap thrills polished to the level of high art.
''Sin City" -- tellingly, the ''official" title is ''Frank Miller's Sin City" -- is also the most faithfully realized comic book adaptation to hit the screen to date, with dialogue lifted still wet from the original speech balloons and camera shots fetishistically re-creating Miller's stark, impressionistic panels. For better and for worse, this is the one the fanboys have been waiting for.
Can an outsider penetrate such a brutally funny macho universe? Yes, because comics legend Miller and Rodriguez, the mad-genius family man behind both the ''Once Upon a Time in Mexico" trilogy and the ''Spy Kids" franchise, have directed ''Sin City" to within an inch of their lives.Collecting roughly 3½ stories from the comic, they've taken a gallery of lowlifes, played by an engagingly motley cast, and set them in a digital film noir metropolis filmed in luscious black and white.
There are random splashes of color -- a femme fatale's blond mane of hair, a hooker's cobalt-blue eyes, the diseased yellow skin of a very bad bad guy -- but this world is so monochromatic even the gunshot wounds bleed phosphorescent white. (Occasionally the film cuts to white-on-black silhouettes, which would be more striking if the iPod ads hadn't gotten there first.)
Of the movie's intertwined narratives, the prize probably goes to the one that rescues Mickey Rourke, of all people, from the pop-culture has-been bin. The actor is nearly unrecognizable as Marv, a hostile lug with a head shaped like a pitching wedge, but Rourke uses the facial prosthetics to bully his way ecstatically through the film's mayhem, like a man who has seen it all and no longer cares (which may be as true for him as for his character).
Marv is an ex-con loser with no one on his side except a butch parole officer named Lucille (Carla Gugino, walking around in nothing but a thong for no apparent reason and all the obvious ones). Then a goodhearted whore (Jaime King) is murdered in his bed, and Marv goes on a rampage to find the responsible parties. This leads him to a fine young cannibal, played by Elijah Wood as if he hoped to bury all memories of Frodo; a rotten-hearted cardinal (Rutger Hauer) also figures into the mix, as does a mendacious priest played by Miller himself.
Elsewhere in Sin City, the streetwalkers of Old Town are in a fix: A cop has been killed, and the delicate truce by which the women control their own business is in danger of coming apart. This story line, based on the ''Big Fat Kill" series of ''Sin City" stories, is notable for some of Hollywood's most beautiful young actresses dressing in S&M chic and snarling with abandon. Rosario Dawson (''Alexander") heads the group, but Alexis Bledel (''Gilmore Girls") pops up as a woman with uncertain allegiances, and Devon Aoki (''2 Fast 2 Furious") swipes the entire sequence as a sullen little Ninja hooker named Miho.
This somehow dovetails with the story of hard-luck hunk Dwight (Clive Owen), who loves Dawson's Gail when he's not romancing bartender Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and protecting her from a sadistic ex-boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). In the film's most baroque tangent, Jackie Boy ends up maimed in spectacular fashion, and it's no surprise that this is where guest director Tarantino decided to apply his cinematic muscle. Such is the stylistic coherence of ''Sin City," though, that you can't really tell who filmed what.
Finally, there's Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the grizzled police detective who in the movie's opening sequence protects a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a rich-kid serial killer (Nick Stahl) and, later in the film, discovers she has grown up into an angelic pole dancer played by Jessica Alba. This is the weakest of the major story lines, and not just because Alba acts with the force of a wet paper towel (or because Hartigan's love for Nancy borders on the pedophilic). It's the one place in ''Sin City" where Miller hasn't boiled his stew of trash influences into something new. That said, the sequence ends with a touch that may have even hardened filmgoers yelping in disbelief.
What keeps the movie from collapsing into a pile of clever nastiness? Bravura style, anarchic humor, and a deep appreciation for the power and pungency of lowbrow American culture. The action in ''Sin City" adheres thrillingly to the laws of comic-book physics: Cars soar high into the air around every corner; heroes take hundreds of bullets and keep coming. Rodriguez and Miller have delivered on the promise and peril of CGI, and their digital world feels more hyper-real, more urgent, than the mundane one waiting outside the multiplex. This is the reason there are fanboys in the first place.
If that doesn't give you pause, maybe it should. There are many reasons that the moralizers, not to mention a lot of women, will be put off by ''Sin City": It's so violent that at times I felt like Alex the Droog having a night out with the boys, and so gleefully sexist that the good girl's a stripper. At the same time, the movie plays fair by the rules of its down and dirty genre -- you know what you're getting into. More problematic is that all the sensation, in the end, has nothing to say about the world we actually live in. ''Sin City" is as sealed off from reality as a double-bagged mint-condition comic in a collector's closet. Tarantino may have nicked the title first, but this is the real ''Pulp Fiction," with all the drama and the dead ends that implies.


         Do graphic novels really need defending anymore? Because the oppositional, slightly defensive comic book guy stance is starting to feel atavistic. Michael Chabon won a Pulitzer Prize for "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay," and then took a crack at the script of "Spider-Man 2." National Book Critics Circle Award-winner Jonathan Lethem just published a book of essays called "Men and Cartoons." Even "Ghost World" creator Daniel Clowes — from somewhere deep in his alterna-comics lair in Berkeley — is on his second movie adaptation. The term "graphic novel" alone says all there is to say about comic books' cultural rehabilitation in the last two decades.
 
  Of course, with "Sin City," Robert Rodriguez didn't set out to protect legendary comics auteur Frank Miller's source material from Allan Bloom-style guardians of high culture but from the transmogrifications of villainous Hollywood superagents and nefarious studio execs. The road to "Sin City," in other words, was a high one — elevated by a fan's pure adulation and loyalty. While doubtless his commitment to preserving the original work has made Rodriguez a geek-land champ — especially as stories about his superheroic break with the Directors Guild of America have circulated (The DGA refused to let him to share directing credit with Miller, so he quit the guild), it's also led to a curious new 
stance, which sounds a little like the 98-pound weakling squawking supremacy. "I don't want to insult the graphic novel by turning it into cinema," Rodriguez said in a TV promo that aired last week, "I want to turn cinema into a graphic novel."
 


         






    Which is ironic, considering it was Miller's great contribution to comics to make them more cinematic.
 
  For a relentlessly violent and exploitive noir knockoff, "Sin City" is mystifyingly flat and static — cartoonish, even, if you want to get tautological about it. (And trust me, you won't be able to help it.) Rodriguez has said it was his goal to "translate" the series into film rather than "adapt" it, without the interloping mediation of a script (the director transcribed the books, and no screenwriting credit was designated). But as someone bilingual, he should know that there's such a thing as being too literal — you can fail to express the spirit of a thing by sticking too closely to the letter.
 
  Cinema has plenty of things in common with sequential art, but spatial limitations, lack of sound and an inherently nonrepresentational style (compared to film, anyway) aren't three of them. In "Sin City," Miller's thought bubbles have been preserved, packed and exported into voice-over tracks as lovingly as if they had been found on scrolls in a tomb outside Cairo, and they choke the movie like a hot smog. The characters' audible musings are not the ironic, unreliable kind that contradict the action and create a tension between a character's perception and reality but a relentlessly torpor-inducing on-the-nose stream-of-consciousness — all "bum tickers" and "fat steaks" and "crazy broads" — that mimic the hard-boiled style of film noir spoofs.
 
  Transpiring in the nightmare world of Basin City — a place so corrupt even the ingénue is a stripper — "Sin City" is a triptych of stories, loosely woven together "Pulp Fiction"-style. In the first story, John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop on his last night on the job, risks his life to save an 11-year-old girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from being raped and filleted by Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl), the psychotic son of a corrupt senator. (Roark Jr. is later transformed into the freak super-villain, That Yellow Bastard.) The wide-eyed child grows up to be a gyrating Jessica Alba in an abbreviated cowgirl costume. If this sounds dismaying, you don't want to know how it ends.
 
  In the second story, a hulking man-beast and freelance avenger known as Marv (Mickey Rourke) spends the night in a heart-shaped bed with a hooker named Goldie (Jaime King) and wakes up to find her dead. The romantic interlude, we're given to understand, was a Very Big Deal for Marv (even in "Sin City," girls have standards), so he sets out to avenge her murder. After torturing a handful of thugs, Marv winds up on a desolate farm where his missing parole officer, the sexy Lucille (Carla Gugino), is being held captive by a young cannibal named Kevin (Elijah Wood). Kevin enjoys making girl sushi and then displaying the leftover heads on the wall like hunting trophies. (At least he uses the whole prostitute.)
 
  In the third story, Dwight (Clive Owen), a private investigator, finds himself in the middle of a turf war between corrupt cops and vigilante streetwalkers when he helps kill the cop (Benicio Del Toro) who's been harassing his girlfriend, Shellie the waitress (Brittany Murphy). In the process, he's reunited with his ex, head hooker Gail (Rosario Dawson). When things start to get really gruesome, old sparks fly.
 
  "Sin City" is a visually striking movie, though like most disconcertingly pretty things, it gets boring fast. In the precredit sequence, a black-and-white Marley Shelton, sheathed in a blood-red sequined gown, gazes out over a moonlit penthouse terrace where she's joined by a dapper Josh Hartnett. He lights her cigarette; her eyes flare green. For an instant, I thought a new fragrance by Chanel was on the cusp of being introduced.
 
  One wasn't, of course, but the movie's slick, all-digital universe, though technically impressive, feels cloistered and airless, and it's hard to beat back the occasional sneaky feeling that the characters aren't, in fact, roaming the streets of a concrete jungle but standing on a smallish stage. The chamber piece effect amplifies the deliberate brutality of the violence, "Sin City's" real reason for being. Once it really gets going, it becomes clear that the movie's film noir pose is a coy justification — like ordering a salad for the croutons and bacon bits — for the smorgasbord of stylized gross-outs and gleeful sadism that dominate the show. "Special guest director" Quentin Tarantino provides just one of the movie's funniest moments of smart-aleck nihilism, but his influence is all over the place. Hartigan treats Roark Jr. to a plug in the groin that looks like a slap on the wrist when compared to the relish, the extravagant gourmandise, really, with which Marv cuts into Kevin (literally, with a saw) and other bad guys. Marv may simper and pine for "that angel" Goldie, but it's killing that supplies his joie de vivre
.
 
  Given the pitch of the violence, the movie's hyper-stylization starts to seem merciful after a while. The gag factor of severed heads, gnawed-off hands, crotches blown to smithereens, and foreheads impaled by large chunks of metal is slightly diminished by the use of ever-tasteful black and white and cartoonish yellow or glowing white blood. (Though the latter, especially as it spurts from bullet wounds, bears an unfortunate resemblance to pigeon poop.)
 
  The acting is equally "stylized" — which you may interpret at will. Unrecognizable in his facial prosthetics, Rourke is the only member of the large cast to fill out his larger-than-life monster rather than let it flatten him. He slips into the character of the troubled, misunderstood pariah who chugs pharmaceuticals straight from the vial as easily as if the role were a warm bath. Willis, Owen and Del Toro reprise their intermittent gigs as tough guy, slightly neurotic hot guy and ghoul, respectively, and do a serviceable if not remarkable job. Gugino plays a tough cookie without resorting to mannerisms. But Murphy dials up the "dame" factor to the point of seeming as if she's stuck in an old "In Living Color" sketch (remember Black and White lady?), and Alexis Bledel, on loan from "Gilmore Girls," plays a double-negative obsessed prostitute named Becky in the stammering, motor-mouthed style of a prissy Yale sophomore who got off on the wrong exit in New Haven.
 
  Such, I guess, are the vicissitudes of green-screen acting — it's harder to get a sense for what everyone else is doing and where they're doing it. Repellent as it is, the carnage in "Sin City" does have the odd effect of tethering it to the material, flesh-and-blood world. (Unlike, say "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," which was so ethereal it seemed as if the characters had seeped in through the air vents.) The movie feels like a reductive exercise. Rodriguez might have accomplished what he set out to do, but I'm not sure he's done anyone any favors.

Faithfulness, a virtue in personal relationships, is overrated when it comes to movie adaptations of comic books. (Let the foaming from fanboys begin.) The devotee who is betrothed to the pages of a particular, ardently loved graphic novel  sequential print-art event, multipage transportable visual diversion, whatever  is the devotee advised to reread that book, through sickness and health, for guaranteed fidelity of experience. To look for the same in a movie is to arrive at the obsessive literal-mindedness and diminished emotional returns of Sin City  or, as the promotional materials emphasize, Frank Miller's Sin City   as if, in certain controversial scholarly circles, Francis Bacon has been credited with the authorship.
This uncontestedly jazzy-looking screen translation of various stories from the pages of the Sin City  comic books begun by Miller in 1991 is first and foremost the cinematic work of impish pop-culture vulture Robert Rodriguez, who has swung in his colorful career from El Mariachi  to Spy Kids . But with insistence that the work is produced and directed by Rodriguez and Frank Miller , from text by Frank Miller , with an appearance by Frank Miller  as a low-down priest, I've got to wonder how much truer to the pulp-fiction spirit of the books (and thus how much more persuasive an introduction for the uninitiated) the movie might have been had its production team not been stuck in such fawning thrall to the source material. Miller is famed, in inky circles, for his two issues of Marvel's Spectacular Spider-Man , and for his work on the comics Daredevil  and The Dark Knight Returns . Call me an insensitive non-fangirl, but if the sacred works of Jane Austen can stand up to freewheeling reinterpretation, then so, too, can heavy-breathing pages about trussed-up little girls and a vile-smelling cartoon pervert known as Yellow Bastard.
Miller's neighborhood of vice, lust, perversity, and loneliness (the burg's full name is Basin City, as in the pits of humanity) is one of brutish, rock-jawed men, dangerous and impossibly curvaceous women, crooked cops, and arch-villain types familiar and even comforting to any hormonally trip-wired teenager who has ever held a racy comic book with one hand. Rodriguez/Miller's screen version, fleshed out by eager-to-play-along stars including Bruce Willis (as a crusty cop), Jessica Alba (as an untainted exotic dancer), Clive Owen (as a tough ex-photojournalist), Rosario Dawson (as your average hottie prostitute), and Elijah Wood (as the kind of flesh-eating serial killer who lurks inside every adolescent boy) warps those characters into alienating  or worse, laughable  avatars of violence and sexual humiliation. Miller's carefully styled, hard-boiled dialogue and narrative connections (''The night is hot as hell. Everything sticks. It's a lousy room in a lousy part of a lousy town'') lose punch  or worse, sound like Guy Noir parodies from Garrison Keillor  when spoken out loud with broad sneers rather than read, nestled on the page amid the crackle and pop of the illustrations.
Consider the story of the vulnerable bruiser Marv, Miller's coolest antihero, played like he was born for the gig by Mickey Rourke in the movie's best star turn. Marv's mangled profile is a cross between Dudley Do-Right and Ron Perlman on Beauty and the Beast , and he's got the ugly-puss resignation to go with it. And when he gets into a brawl, which is constantly, he covers his scrapes with adhesive bandages that glow white, like stars, on the blackness of the page or screen. Rodriguez gets Marv's look down just right  the visual elegance  of Sin City  may be its own reward for certain tech-minded  connoisseurs  and in Rourke's melancholy interpretation, a soul leaks out that the movie doesn't know what to do with. And so a grand love-and-death story that might have carried the whole picture  about the homely loner's all-city search for the killer of a beautiful woman who showed Marv love in one night of sticky bliss  gets shuffled between other, less ''human'' stories that apparently must be told.
Such undifferentiated enthusiasm culminates in a long, stupidly extreme story of torture and revenge involving Benicio Del Toro as a stinkin' cop who gets into a spot of trouble: He's tortured, and double-killed, and triple-hacked until his head  severed from his body  becomes a negotiation point and/or soccer ball all its own, with competing Sinners out to collect it. The moderate amusement of seeing Del Toro in segments (and FYI, he's not the only star who goes to pieces in Rodriguez and Miller's town) soon wears off, though, replaced by a kind of restless overstimulation. Glued tightly from page to screen, Sin City  is so seduced by the visual possibilities of sin that style becomes its own vice.

here are eight million stories in the naked city and almost as many crammed into  "Sin City." Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, who directed the film with Robert Rodriguez, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs (mostly downs) of tough guys and dolls recycled from the lower depths and bottom shelves of pulp fiction. Instead of Raymond Chandler, though, with his weary allusions to Shakespeare and Keats, these hard-boiled tales owe a debt to the American primitivism of Mickey Spillane and comic book legends like William Gaines. Set in a nowhere metropolis,   the film opens with a gaspingly beautiful  image of a woman staring into the night. Dressed in a shimmering gown the color of newly spilled blood, she stands with her back to the camera, oblivious. That gives us time to register that this red is the only color in a landscape exclusively painted hot white, bottomless black and silvery gray. It also gives the narrator (Josh Hartnett) time to creep up on her. Soon, the man offers the woman a cigarette and takes something far more precious from her in return. With a few short sentences and an act of violence, the filmmakers telescope the death and desire to follow, as well as the underlying brutality of their  world. "Sin City" unfolds in a permanent midnight with only an intermittent splash of color to brighten the dark. In this shadowland, the men wear trench coats and chips on their shoulders, while the women wear next to nothing at all. Aesthetically speaking, the filmmakers have a thing for pneumatic breasts and bondage wear, and the women in "Sin City" are conceived along the same fetishistic lines as many comic strip heroines. Dressed in push-up bras and even a pair of chaps, they all look as if  they could be on the stroll in Pigalle,  including a parole officer, who likes to ramble around in thong panties and heels. It is a vision of women so comically retro you half expect the 1950's pinup Bettie Page to swing by for some fun. Like "Pulp Fiction," which clearly influences its structure, "Sin City" turns on three tales lifted out of Mr. Miller's original. The first involves a detective with a bad ticker, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who intersects with a sex fiend (Nick Stahl) and an 11-year-old (Makenzie Vega), who grows up to become an exotic dancer (Jessica Alba) with an undulating belly and a nice way with a lasso. Little girls apparently do not enjoy a whole lot of career choices in Sin City. Except for that parole officer (Carla Gugino) and a waitress (Brittany Murphy), all the other women in this burg are prostitutes, members of a snarling sisterhood bound together by greed, kink, self-interest and numerous lethal weapons. That sisterhood features most heavily in the story hooked to a psychopath named Dwight (Clive Owen). Like the rest of the film's menagerie, Dwight is a conceit rather than a character, and would barely register save for the fact that Mr. Owen is easy on the eyes, whether jumping out of a window or locking lips with his own personal demon (Rosario Dawson). Dwight's story, a tale of jealousy and misidentification, finds him crossing paths with a thug, Jackie Boy (a barely recognizable, criminally uglified Benicio Del Toro), and not much more. Jackie Boy, whose moniker recalls that of Robert De Niro's doomed Johnny Boy in "Mean Streets," has the makings of a tragedy, but the filmmakers don't have the will. He just crashes and burns, sacrificed for the usual blood sport. And so it goes - pow, wham, splat. The most developed story hinges on Marv, a slab of sub-humanity played by a thoroughly unrecognizable Mickey Rourke. With a face like roadkill and a pumped up body, Marv is at once the classic cartoon underdog and a pulp superman, a lonely guy who can take vengeance on the world by blowing like Krakatoa. (Needless to say, he is also a classic identification figure for the stereotypical comic book reader.) Like Hartigan and to an extent Dwight, Marv is also an avenger of women, a knight in shining black. Marv has a dream called Goldie (Jaime King), a stealthy enemy (Elijah Wood) and a taste for stomach-flipping violence. You may not look at your dog the same way after you watch Marv go about his gory work. The scene with Marv and what turns out to be a hungry hound could have been published in William Gaines's E.C. horror comics. Originally published in 1950, these comics hit a postwar America with an understandably strong appetite for horror, and are filled with Grand Guignol laughs, distressed damsels and terrors bubbling under the surface.  Like many comic book artists, Mr. Miller was influenced by E.C., but his voice and style are also steeped in the romantic fatalism of film noir. There is nothing urgent or remotely profound about "Sin City" and its pastiche of styles; here, the text is the subtext, and the horror is abstract, not rooted in the real. But Mr. Miller certainly knows how cool a guy looks, or thinks he does, walking its mean streets. I bring up E.C. because "Sin City" has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. In recent years, Mr. Rodriguez has been a careless craftsman, but he went to great lengths to honor Mr. Miller's vision, even quitting the Directors Guild because  it wouldn't allow the two men to share the directing credit. But in an effort to make a faithful adaptation, Mr. Rodriguez put his own movie sense on hold, not even bothering with a real script. He didn't just try to make his "Sin City" look like a graphic novel: he tried to replicate the private experience of reading one too, slowly turned page after slowly turned page. The problem is, this is his private experience, not ours. The soporific vibe isn't helped by the fact that "Sin City" has the muffled, airless quality of some movies loaded  with computer-generated imagery. The film feels as if it takes place under glass, which makes conceptual sense, since the characters don't bear any resemblance to actual life: they don't have hearts (or brains), so there's no reason they should have lungs or air to breathe. At the same time, Mr. Miller and Mr. Rodriguez's commitment to absolute unreality and the absence of the human factor mean it's hard to get pulled into the story on any level other than the visceral. When stuff goes blam, you jump like someone who's  landed on a whoopee cushion. But then you just sit there, wrap yourself in the dark and try not to fall asleep. "Sin City" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains a smorgasbord of stylized, generally unrealistic-looking violent acts, including a lot of dismemberment; there is also alcohol use, adult language, some hanky-panky and many women in various stages of undress.

Lurid run the streets of "Sin City," as aggressively faithful a rendering of a comic book aesthetic as has been put on the bigscreen with live actors. Deeply and digitally noir with the occasional slash of bold color to highlight a dame's golden hair or red lips and dress, Robert Rodriguez's guild-bolting collaboration with graphic artist Frank Miller is a Mickey Spillane fever dream, with a gallery of tough customers doing nasty things to each other on a shimmering monochrome canvas. For geeks, action freaks and sensation-seeking teenage boys of all ages, the price of admission will provide a one-way ticket to hard-boiled heaven, generating potent theatrical B.O. and even stronger returns in the homescreen afterlife.
Miller's world of rough customers living on the wild side possesses a sordid allure, which the directors dazzlingly deliver to the screen. While the pair's purist approach may fully realize the nature of the material, it also unfortunately locks it into its own box as a live-action cartoon. An adaptation of three Miller books from the "Sin City" series he launched in 1991, pic is increasingly limited by its episodic nature, repetitive motifs, monolithic character types, use of violence to substitute for drama, lack of modulating humor and virtually identical gravely voices for all its male characters.
The film also peaks early, at the 50-minute point, with the conclusion of its most arresting story, in which Mickey Rourke makes a ferociously effective bigscreen comeback as a hulking part-man, part-beast out to avenge the murder of the only woman who ever done him right. With muscleman Marv literally tearing apart Sin City (actually identified as Basin City on a road sign), Rodriguez and Miller achieve maximum energy in this story, while also endowing it with sardonic humor and a touch of sweetness conspicuously lacking thereafter.
Neatly setting its nightscape location and hard-bitten tone in a brief teaser featuring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton (sequence served as the acid test that induced Miller to give Rodriguez the go-ahead to use his material), film quickly dives into the struggle of veteran cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis, looking every bit a great film star of old in black-and-white) to prevent a corrupt senator's pedophile son (Nick Stahl) from raping a young girl.
Narrative soon switches over to the night of pleasure strapping Marv (Rourke) takes with a hooker named Goldie (Jaime King), who next morning turns up dead in his bed. Marv, whose lupine proboscis (wonderfully rendered by the makeup experts to meld convincingly with the actor's features) has evidently put a sizeable dent in his social life, goes on a rampage in search of the killer.
After checking in with his parole officer, luscious lesbian Lucille ("Spy Kids" star Carla Gugino, letting it all hang out), Marv invades a particularly nasty bar, where a number of the characters who come to figure importantly in later action are first glimpsed. He blows away a priest in a confessional, before continuing his quest to the farm of cannibalistic killer Kevin (Elijah Wood, in radically anti-Frodo mode), who displays on a wall his collection of the beautiful heads of his victims.
So ultra is the violence between the destruction machine known as Marv and the eerily calm Kevin that it becomes perversely funny. This partly stems from the insouciance with which Rourke tosses off his characterization of a man so tough and strong he just can't help himself. Even when strapped to the electric chair to meet a fate he'd be the first to admit he deserves, he faces his demise with such style you can't help but like the guy.
The action remains mostly downtown in the next vignette, which sees one of the city's last good men, Dwight (Clive Owen in rugged BMW ad form), wrangling with berserk corrupt cop Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro, his look significantly changed by a long sloping nose) over the affections of impudent waitress Shellie (Brittany Murphy). The men's conflict sets off a gang war that impinges on the neighborhood's collection of savagely sexy hookers, notably their Number One, Gail (Rosario Dawson), Dwight's great love.
Episode has its moments of grotesque humor -- the supposedly dead Jackie Boy continues to figure in the action with a pistol embedded in his forehead -- but the presence of quasi-recognizable human beings here emphasizes the absence of any real emotions or relationships. 
Dawson comes as close as any of the actresses to creating a memorable role, but the episode reveals an overriding weakness in the material -- Miller's lack of strongly individuated female characters.
With the return of Willis' cop character for the final half-hour, the directors' desire to dovetail the stories in "Pulp Fiction" mode becomes clear. But it's a half-hearted, uninspired gambit and, despite Nick Stahl's startling transformation from merely a nasty spoiled boy to a grotesque meanie named Yellow Bastard (a character who infests the black-and-white screen with his full appropriate color), Willis' Hartigan by this time seems too routine a character to ignite great excitement, compared with those who have come before.
However rough they are around the edges, Miller's male protagonists are descendents of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe as knights trying to rescue largely dubious damsels from the encroaching darkness. To be sure, the combined Women of Sin City would make for a banner issue of any men's magazine, and the prospect of Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel, Dawson, Gugino, King, Murphy and Shelton in skimpy and slutty attire will assuredly raise the pulses of the target audience.
On the other hand, too much may be made of the prominently billed participation of Quentin Tarantino as "special guest director." His contribution amounts to one scene, which took a day to shoot, of Owen's Dwight driving through a hard rain while dealing with the presumably dead Jackie Boy in the seat next to him. It's a good, energetic scene, but appropriately of a piece with the rest of the picture.
While generously giving Miller top billing on the shared directors' card (as well as a possessory credit before the title), and eschewing any mention of a screenwriter, Rodriguez takes an amusingly unusual "shot and cut by" credit, and he really shines here; his lensing, using the digital high-definition Sony HFC-950 cameras, sublimely synthesizes the influences of graphic novels and film noir.
The way in which computer generated backgrounds closely evoke and yet improve upon the backdrops and studio sets of 60-year-old Hollywood pictures is an ongoing astonishment, and the synthesis of story, acting and technology is in all ways more satisfying than last year's similar big-studio experiment, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."
Rodriguez also collaborated on the exceptionally evocative, ever-present score with John Debney and Graeme Revell.

The sun never shines in Sin Citybut then Sin City  doesn't really need light. Although populated by a gaggle of Hollywood  meat puppets, this slick and brutal Robert Rodriguez  adaptation of Frank Miller 's famously "grim and gritty" graphic novels is strictly post-photographic.
Reality is virtual. Shot on DV in black-is-black and white-on-white with strategic swatches of colormost often blood-redSin City  has  its digitally enhanced performers cavorting through hyper-noir CGI "sets." The atmosphere is the landscape, and the narrative as well. Sin City  tells three intertwined tales of the world's toughest towna place populated by crooked cops, corrupt pols, depraved priests, pedophiliac cannibals, and a super-abundance of bodacious thong-snapping bondage babes.
Even a sweet little girl grows up to be an exotic dancer in a low-life dive, and every pickup is a prelude to murder. The movie's three protagonists are the last good cop in Sin City (Bruce Willis ), a surgically altered private eye (Clive Owen ), and most spectacularly, the hulk-like, borderline-psychotic killing machine Marv (Mickey Rourke , rendered unrecognizable with a prosthetic profile). Their thought balloons rule, in voice-overs spiced by hard-boiled bons mots: "Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts."
Nuts it is, fellasand ain't it cool? A female stream of consciousness is about as likely to be found in Sin City as a rainbow sign or a visit from the Teletubbies . Chivalry, however, is not dead. Each of the three stories (which include Miller's first, starring Marv) is predicated on a 12-year-old boy's fantasy of the lone, misappreciated tough guy protecting or avenging some vulnerable little ladyeven, or rather especially, if she's a kickass Amazon hooker in full circus regalia.
Miller, who has a cameo as a degenerate padre, is a comic-book god for his 1980s reinvention of Batman, among others things, and Rodriguez reportedly quit the Directors Guild to ensure that the artist got co-credit; his approach to Miller's material is nothing short of reverential. Sin City  aspires to be a living comic book and it certainly has a look. Everything from Marv's iridescent bandages to the wounds that explode like Day-Glo bird shit is a design element. The filmmakers have taken evident pains to approximate Miller's aggressively stark high-contrast paletteno shades of grayand fondness for dynamic, receding planes. But movies are not comics, and once the shock of recognition wears off, this literalism has an oppressively overwrought effectnot unlike the hyper-real Plan Nine  reconstruction in Tim Burton 's Ed Wood  .
Sin City 's loop-the-loop narrative structure owes something to Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction . (People more acute than I have noticed some peculiar temporal inconsistenciesthe fan sites will no doubt tell us if these are intentional.) But Sin City  lacks the human interest, not to be confused with humanism, that Pulp Fiction  had in abundance. As if to underscore the fact, Tarantino guest-directed a scene. It's readily recognizable as the only one in which the dialogue has the slightest conviction, and the actors (Owen and Benicio Del Toro ) seem to play off each other, even if one is the other's hallucination. It also has the subtlest use of color and is the only scene that made me laugh.
Not that Sin City  doesn't invite you to chucklethere is, after all, an underwater perspective of Del Toro being dunked in a toilet bowl. The problem is that the humor is less predicated on violence than sadism. Limbs are sliced, jaws cracked, faces regularly beaten to a bloody pulp. There's an exceptionally graphic electric-chair scene"Is that the best you can do, you pansies?" the executionee laughs as the top of his head sizzles offand, in another quasimoney shot, Rosario Dawson  bites a chunk out of a stoolie's neck. Played for laughs, it's an image that evokes the EC horror comics of the early '50sas do the decapitated heads that are regularly held up by their hair.
Pulp Fiction  by rote, Sin City  ultimately twists back into its first story. But more than just the narrative comes full circlein a way it's the history of pulp. All the visual ideas that the savvy comic-book artists of the '40s swiped from Citizen Kane   return as the zombie accoutrements of pure digitalia. For all its graphic splendor, watching Sin City is like spending two hours in a state-of-the-art wax museum. Rodriguez loves his material so much that he embalmed it.
