         Ingmar Bergman is back. With a vengeance. "Saraband" is not what might be expected from a venerable director with six decades of experience who will turn 87 next week. But Bergman has never been an ordinary filmmaker, and what he's given us is no genial last hurrah but rather an intensely dramatic, at times lacerating examination of life's conundrums that is exhilarating in its fearlessness and its command.
 
  Named after a 17th century court dance, "Saraband" is the Swedish writer-director's first serious look at family relationships since 1983's "Fanny and Alexander." Characterized by costar Liv Ullmann as the most personal film Bergman has ever made, it is also proof that he still has both the passion for exploring psychological intricacies and the gifts to make that passion indelible.
 


         






    "Fanny and Alexander" was announced as the director's last film (as has this one). But he's since done projects for Swedish television (where "Saraband" originated) and written scripts for other directors. Trying to make sense of life is not just a profession or even a calling, it's who Bergman is at the core of his being.
 
  That unwavering attitude means that Bergman's scripts are never done full justice when other, less involved directors bring them to the screen. So we are especially fortunate that this film, with its unblinking examination of the stifling nature of love as well as love's unnerving proximity to hate, was one Bergman felt strongly enough about to handle himself.
 
  Because two of its four characters (Erland Josephson's Johan and Ullmann's Marianne) appeared as estranged husband and wife in 1973's "Scenes From a Marriage," "Saraband" is being inaccurately talked about as a kind of sequel. In fact, Bergman seems to have used these characters simply because he was familiar with them; there's nothing you need to know about their history that the present film doesn't immediately tell you.
 
  "Saraband" is broken up into a prologue and nine chapters, almost all of them dialogues between two of the film's characters (the source, presumably, of the dance title). The prologue is an exception, as Marianne faces the camera and casually catches us up on what's happened with her and Johan over the decades. Besides filling us in on events like Johan's retirement with inherited money, the monologue combines with Ullmann's empathetic qualities to establish a kind of complicity between the audience and the characters. More or less on a whim, Marianne has decided to visit Johan after an absence of 32 years. She finds him creaky physically, wary of intimacy ("Are you going to start hugging?" he asks fearfully) and worried that he's lived "a meaningless, idiotic life."
 
  One of the unexpected aspects of "Saraband" is that it is not primarily about this waning relationship. Living on a cabin on Johan's property is Henrik (Börje Ahlstedt), his 61-year-old son from a previous marriage, and Karin (Julia Dufvenius), Henrik's 19-year-old daughter. Karin, a gifted cellist, is getting instruction from her musically involved father while both are trying to recover from the recent death of the family's wife and mother.
 
  Bergman has an acknowledged gift for savage personal relationships, in which grudges are far from forgotten and people can't help but eviscerate those they are close to. Johan's lifelong willingness to be dismissive of his son has warped Henrik's personality. Showing us that dynamic playing out in all of the film's interactions is the essence of "Saraband's" intentions.
 
  As a result, the most memorable acting in the film comes from Ahlstedt, known to Bergman watchers as Uncle Carl in "Fanny and Alexander" and other films. His is the most complex role, and we only gradually come to see what having a father like Johan has done to his soul, and to Johan's.
 
  The most remarkable thing about "Saraband" is that Bergman makes this kind of intensely emotional filmmaking look simple. The ease with which the director calls forth the most deep-seated and complex emotions from his actors is helped by their skill and the decades they've worked with him, but it's nevertheless exceptional.
 
  Bergman shot "Saraband" on digital video without a designated cinematographer, and though that format's user-friendliness made this film possible, it's difficult to watch without lamenting the absence of the texture and richness that shooting on old-fashioned film provides.
 
  Seeing "Saraband" also reminds us how much we're missing by not having pictures like this as part of our regular moviegoing menu. Bergman's style of filmmaking seems to come not from the last century but rather another universe altogether, one that we've abandoned, to our loss.
 
  In some ways sadder than anything else are the Swedish words that close "Saraband": "Manus och regi Ingmar Bergman" 
(written and directed by Ingmar Bergman). They are words we're not likely to see on a new release ever again, and having them end this quite marvelous film makes us realize yet again how much the world of cinema will miss him once he's gone.

Turning to the camera, Liv Ullmann crinkles her warm oval face into a smile, once again taking on the role of Marianne from 1974's Scenes From a Marriage . For art-movie lovers of a certain age, it's like gazing at an image out of your own memory scrapbook. In Saraband , Ingmar Bergman reunites Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan, the loving and raging couple whose marriage and divorce came to seem, in the '70s, an incarnation of the bourgeois domestic spirit. Anyone expecting a tender sunset elegy, however, has wandered into the wrong film. Saraband , despite a few wistful moments, is a poison pill of a reunion. It's set in a tranquil mountain cabin, where Marianne arrives to visit Johan after a separation of 30 years. She discovers that he has devolved into a ghastly crank who specializes in tormenting his now-aging son (from a different marriage). As Marianne becomes a bystander to his cruelty, you feel the pull of Bergman's craft, but also the sting of his sourness.

"Saraband" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 15, 2004. The film, in Swedish with English subtitles, opens today in Manhattan. Ingmar Bergman has said that "Saraband," his bleak made-for-television epilogue to "Scenes From a Marriage," will be his final statement on film. For the great Swedish writer and director, final turns out to mean unbendingly severe. There has been no mellowing with age. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson, playing the embattled ex-spouses Johan and Marianne 30 years after "Scenes From a Marriage," you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. These solemn, world-weary characters rummaging through the past are still possessed by their nagging inner demons. Ms. Ullmann, now 65, and Mr. Josephson, 81, have a supreme mastery of the Bergman style. Their performances are spiritual and emotional X-rays. As in all of Mr. Bergman's later work, you have a sense of a ritualized penitence being re-enacted. To these actors, who have served him for decades, he must loom as an omniscient visionary whose canon is as inviolably sacred to them as Freud's theoretical writings appear to be to a dwindling pool of Freudian acolytes. Mr. Bergman's psychic world is an unchanging Scandinavian twilight, saturated in deep music (here it is Bach, Bruckner and others) that invites contemplation and evokes tormenting dreams of an elusive spiritual peace. As ever, women are the salvation of men. They alone have the capacity to forgive and empathize, even after their terrible mistreatment at the hands of the opposite sex. And men, no matter how accomplished and feted by the world, remain hard-bitten patriarchal taskmasters vainly striving to rule their pitiful little fiefs. "Saraband," which unfolds in 10 short chapters, opens with a prologue in which Marianne, sitting at a desk strewn with old photographs, addresses the camera and introduces the story of her impulsive visit to Johan, whom she hasn't seen in 30 years. The couple have two grown daughters, one married and living in Australia, the other catatonic and confined to a mental hospital. Although Marianne shares some marital reminiscences with Johan near the beginning of the film, she is predominantly a sounding board for the emotional wreckage she encounters on his estate in the middle of a forest. Living in Johan's lakeside cottage are his 61-year-old son, Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), by an earlier marriage, and Henrik's 19-year-old daughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius). Both Henrik and Karin are musicians, locked in grief over the death of Henrik's wife, Anna, two years earlier. Henrik has transferred the fierce possessiveness he felt toward Anna to his daughter, a musical prodigy and his student on the cello. Father and daughter even share the same bed. Henrik believes he can't live without Karin and fears an imminent break that would leave him "destitute," as he puts it. Karin has already begun fighting his tyrannical devotion. No love is lost between Johan and Henrik. As they trade bitter accusations, Johan, who controls the purse strings, systematically humiliates Henrik, treating him like a whipped dog. Their warfare makes for one of the ugliest portraits of father-son hatred ever filmed. The screenplay for "Saraband"  has the oratorical tone of a theater piece. The film consists almost entirely of anguished verbal confrontations in which the characters rub salt in one another's open wounds. Ms. Ullmann has finally lost the earth-mother bloom that has made her the director's most reliable gauge of whatever slender hope he wishes to convey. Marianne is able to draw back from the desperation and hold herself in. Of her 16-year marriage to Johan, once a compulsive womanizer, she can now say with some equanimity, "I was so naïve." The character (and perhaps Ms. Ullmann herself) has reached the time of life when you realize that any dreams you may have had of saving the world, or even saving a single lost soul, are probably futile. That may count as wisdom, but it's wisdom of a very sad kind. "Saraband" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong sexual situations and nudity. 

A bitter but finally moving story about lost love, hatred between generations and a curious kind of liberation, "Saraband" officially closes one of the most prestigious and influential careers in the history of cinema. TV movie is the final film both written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, who at 85 has stated it's time for him to step back and let others do the work. It's effectively a sequel to his classic 1973 TV series "Scenes From a Marriage" (also released at the time in a shorter cinema version), following the two main characters 30 years after their divorce. Though that production was more emotionally engaging, "Saraband" still makes for fascinating viewing, with Bergman regulars Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann encoring their roles and in top form. 
Item airs on Swedish Television Dec. 1. Pic was shot on hi-def video and, despite considerable interest from fests this year (including an open invitation from Cannes), Bergman has refused all offers to screen it theatrically. (Sources at STV, however, hint that he still may be persuaded to change his mind.) Helmer is reportedly unhappy with the visual quality in 35mm blowup. At STV press screening caught, film was shown on hi-def, and picture, color and sound were clear and fine, with none of the usual sickly hues traditionally associated with video.
Dedicated to Bergman's late wife, Ingrid, pic takes its title from the South American dance form that came to Europe in the 17th century (and was promptly deemed indecent by the Spanish Court). Film is divided into a prologue, 10 chapters and an epilogue, in each of which only two characters are present. Though each seg is in the form of a conversation, one always talks more than the other, turning each section into something close to a monologue.
In the prologue, Marianne (Ullmann) sits in front of a table full of photographs, talking straight to camera. She says that Johan, her ex-husband, became a millionaire thanks to an inheritance and bought a secluded house in the northern county of Dalarna; the two of them haven't had any contact with each other for years. As she speaks, the camera moves closer and closer to her face through an abrupt series of cuts.
Marianne adds that she also never sees her and Johan's two daughters anymore: One moved to Australia and the other is in a mental hospital. She's started to wonder whether she should pay a visit to her ex-husband. And so she does, as the film proper starts.
The old Johan (Josephson) turns out to be full of bitterness and hatred, and it's clear that Marianne's visit isn't welcome. Contemptuously, he tells her that Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), his son from his previous marriage, and Henrik's 19-year-old daughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius), are living in his guest house. Karin's a highly talented cellist, and Henrik, who's also a musician, has devoted his life to tutoring her since her mother, Anna, died two years ago.
Johan's manner of speaking is mean and aggressive ("My life is shit; it's hell," etc.) but he grudgingly lets Marianne stay over in a guest room. When Karin comes to the main house, she tells Marianne how she and Johan have fought over a piece of music he wants her to play. In rapid flashback, their argument -- shot through with a sense of unease and sexual tension -- is shown, plus Karin's subsequent escape into the surrounding woods.
"Never again," Karin tells Marianne. "Now someone else will have to take care of him." Later, it is revealed that Karin and her own father sleep in the same bed in the guest house. A week later, Henrik visits Johan to ask for a loan to buy Karin an antique cello. During the talk, Johan mocks his son ("If you weren't Karin's father, you wouldn't exist"), and both his eyes and voice are full of hatred and contempt. Henrik feels the same about his dad, telling Marianne when they meet in a church that "I hate him in every possible way; I want to see him die from a painful disease." After Henrik has left, Marianne prays in front of a crucifix on the wall.
Later, Johan tells Karin he's had an offer from an old friend to continue her musical education in Helsinki. In a stunning coup de cinema, as she leaves her grandfather, Karin imagines herself playing her cello alone, in total whiteness.
When Karin finds a letter that Anna, her mother, wrote to Henrik a week before she died, she reads it to Marianne. It's about Karin's own relationship with her father, one of extreme closeness on Henrik's side ("You love her, but you bind her," wrote Anna). Emotionally, Karin tells Marianne there's no way she could move to Helsinki, as it would kill her dad. The stage is thus set for a final confrontation between Henrik and Karin, and a reconciliation of sorts between Johan and Marianne.
Apart from a couple of exterior shots, whole film is made up of interiors and feels very stagebound, more like classic TV-theater than a movie. There's no real attempt to hide the fact that interiors were all shot in a studio, with backdrops seen through windows looking more like paintings than real sky and trees. The dialogue is also theatrical, in an old-fashioned way; nobody talks like this today.
Yet "Saraband" still works. Though the main focus starts out as Johan and Marianne meeting again, the film's central protags in fact turn out to be Henrik and Karin. Pic is their story, with the father's way-too-intimate devotion to his daughter providing the film's dramatic backbone.
Marianne's prolonged stay at the house is the catalyst to the tensions in Henrik and Karin's relationship being forced into the open, with devastating results. As a result, the film's emotional clout is mostly during the final half-hour.
Bergman uses long, often static, takes, giving his thesps the freedom to act out their emotions without cutaways. In the hands of a lesser director, this approach could have become tedious, but both the story and the players keep the picture alive and give it a sense of forward motion. Among the cast of five, the biggest pleasure is provided by Josephson, relishing the hatred and bitterness that drives Johan. Though the 80-year-old thesp now suffers from Parkinson's disease, it's not visible in the film, apart from some trembling of his hands; he can still deliver lines as venomously and convincingly as he did 30 years ago.
"Saraband" won't be the film that Bergman will be remembered for, as it's certainly outclassed by pics like "Cries and Whispers" and "Fanny and Alexander." But it's more than worthy of the veteran director, and deserves platforming at a major fest.

A fusty, quaint blast from the art-house past, Ingmar Bergman 's Saraband  rolls out with anachronistic boldnesswere imported movies ever this hermetic, this psychodramatic, this high culture? Yes and no: This new film, shot for Swedish TV when Bergman was 85, holds to the mandarin's late taste for head-to-head emotional warfare and chamber-piece economy. But the all-digital piece is a minor-key coda, skimpy on ideas and reliant on nostalgia for 1973's Scenes From a Marriage , to which it is a sequel of sorts. Busy in his autumn years writing deep-dish film scripts (The Best Intentions , Private Confessions , Faithless ) and directed TV plays, Bergman hasn't returned to form now so much as fallen back on his lazier tropes. Perhaps it is inordinately harsh to say Saraband  resembles Woody Allen 's Bergman manqué Interiors  more than any other Bergman film outside of After the Rehearsal . But I prefer Allen's WASP-family meltdown, if only for its regard for realistic conversation and Maureen Stapleton 's exploding sexuality.
Saraband  is conducted in 10 dialogues or monologues, beginning with Liv Ullmann 's Marianne, three decades after Scenes , directly addressing the camera about her inexplicable impulse to visit her ex-husband Johan (Erland Josephson ) at his remote cottage in the mountains. Her motivations are never cleared up, but their semi-amused, semi-bitter relationship is soon subsumed by the nearby presence of Johan's middle-aged son from an older marriage, Henrik (B Ahlstedt), and his teenage daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius ), who are both penniless cellists occupying an outlying guest house rent free. Like Scenes , the action is restricted to duets, and it becomes clear that Johan and Henrik hate each other's guts and that Henrik, whose wife had died a few years earlier, is lost in grief and obsessively attached to his willowy, earnest blonde goddess of a child.
Hyper-confessional logorrhea has become uncommon in movies and takes getting used to now. In any case, Ullmann's tolerant heroine, our confidant in this relatively fruitless tangle of family needs and fears, is all but shunted aside. Modest as the movie is, Bergman doesn't skimp on the watery-eyed combat and infinitely dissected neuroses, lively ingredients that may be sufficient balm for cineastes pining for the olden days of Janus Films  logos and reliably turbulent Euro-cinema. Still, the distance between Bergman's vision of human intercourse and reality has always edged toward pretension and self-involvement, and without more thematic weight for buttress, the project slips into the abyss. The academic-reference-packed dialogue, the reading of Kierkegaard, the utter lack of ordinary modesty or pragmatism, and the casual lack of concern for one's own children ("I know nothing about our daughters," Johan shruggingly says at the outset) are all far from convincing. The frantic bond between Henrik and Karin is another bizarre matter, manifesting as a manic cello-mad co-dependency before setting sail, in one strange, dishonest moment Bergman never prepares us for or feels the need to explain, into incestuous waters.
The actors work like sheepdogs, of course, but their roles give them one note to pluck in each scene. Ullmann, for one, seems less concerned about filling out her inconsequential character than dressing the sets with grande-dame mannerisms and crinkly-eyed cuteness. Saraband  doesn't ask to be considered prime-cut Bergman, and it isn't, although its slightness may not matter to the art-film starving class. His style may date, but that's another way of saying it has been indispensably assimilated into our ideas of what profound, thoughtful cinema is supposed to be. Like a wedge of low-grade Stravinsky , revived and performed, the movie could be considered an addendum to a looming and unique catalog, in which no work is insignificant.
