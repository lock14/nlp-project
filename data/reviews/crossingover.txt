Crossing Over  tells a tale of illegal aliens in   Los Angeles, with Harrison Ford scowling through the role of a weary Immigration  and Customs Enforcement officer. It may seem safe to assume that the movie is going to be about desperate, impoverished Mexicans trying to smuggle themselves over the U.S. border. But the thrust of Crossing Over , a multi-stranded, narrative-collage message movie   in the Crash /Babel  we-are-all-one-world mode, is that undocumented immigrants arrive  in America from anywhere and everywhere. They can be like Gavin (Jim Sturgess), a British musician who draws on his secular Jewish roots to try to forge fake credentials as an Orthodox holy man; or Taslima (Summer Bishil), a 15-year-old Bangladeshi who gets in trouble with the feds after she reads a paper in class exalting the courage of the 9/11  hijackers (she later claims that she wasn't  defending them  a bit hypocritically, I'd say); or Claire (Alice Eve), an Aussie actress who is promised legal status by Cole (Ray Liotta), an applications adjudicator, if she'll sleep with him at his beck and call; or Yong (Justin Chon), a Korean teenager who, on the verge of taking his naturalization oath, is lured into a youth gang even more blankly vicious and overwrought than the one in Gran Torino .
The director, Wayne Kramer (The Cooler ), crisscrosses these stories into a diverting   anthropological melodrama, with enough  coincidence to keep the action unified.   A lawyer (Ashley Judd) who takes the case of one of the illegals, for instance, is married   to Liotta's sleazy case officer. Fortunately, there isn't enough  coincidence to turn the film  into a Crash -like pileup of crazy "connective" accidents. Yet Crossing Over  is so eager to  go for the emotional jugular that it never quite  forges an enlightening point of view. It places us on the side of men and women who crave green cards as if they were magical totems. But when the film wags its finger at the U.S. for deigning to protect itself by cracking down on those who haven't earned green cards, its understanding of immigrants starts to look like little more than knee-jerk empathy.

 When it comes to politics and the big screen, American filmmakers tend to fall into two camps, the grossly exploitative and the earnestly instructive. On the earnestly instructive side are well-intentioned downers and uppers like “Grand Canyon” and their lower-budget equivalents, like “The Visitor” and “Frozen River,” which offer prescriptive lessons in tolerance. On the grossly exploitative are those films, like Wayne Kramer’s “Crossing Over,” that deliver their sanctimony with less hand-wringing and more fist-shaking, complete with lurid violence and, for no real narrative reason, periodically bared female flesh.  In general, the grossly exploitative flicks tend to be more entertaining or at least bearable than the earnestly instructive variant. (Sam Fuller was a master of the exploitative political film.) Such is the  case initially with “Crossing Over,” which tries, through a carefully balanced range of characters, to tackle some of the thornier problems involving immigration in America, post-Sept. 11. Largely set in that boiling multicultural hot pot known as Southern California, with a few stops south of the border, the mosaiclike story oscillates between various, unrelated immigrants, legal and otherwise, and the American citizens who are trying to help or  hinder them. The film’s most obvious models are “Crash” and “Babel,” which both advance their multi-everything messages structurally with fragmented, multistrand narratives.  If Mr. Kramer’s bid to fuse form and content registers as rather less elegant than  “Crash” or “Babel,” it is in part because he doesn’t seem equally committed to all his characters.  Though he’s come up with a veritable United Nations of human-interest stories  — including those of an African child stuck in a detention center and an Iranian patriarch on the verge of citizenship — he spends most of his time hanging out with his film’s more familiar faces.  By far the most well known is the appealingly gruff Harrison Ford as Max Brogan, an officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who comes equipped with a marshmallow heart and a flinty partner with serious culture-shock issues of his own, Hamid (a very fine Cliff Curtis).  In “Crossing Over” immigration isn’t just a problem, it’s also what defines and limits each and every character. Yet, much like the characters’ diversity — the huddled masses include a Mexican mother and son, an Australian actress and a Korean family — immigration isn’t really the point here. Violence is. When a zealous Muslim teenager, Taslima (Summer Bishil), the daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants, delivers a naïve essay on the Sept. 11 hijackers at school, the speech doesn’t prompt any soul-searching. It isn’t meant to: it’s simply a device to show (prove) how wretchedly bigoted everyone in this rainbow coalition actually is, from the black teenagers who hurl insults at Taslima to the white  F.B.I. agent who comes cataclysmically knocking on her family’s door.  If Mr. Kramer’s outrage felt honest, his film would be easier to respect. But time and again, he undermines his own righteousness  by pumping up the violence (gangbangers threaten the Korean family) and stripping down  his talent, including the Australian, Claire (Alice Eve), who, after attracting the sexual interest of a sleazy immigration bureaucrat, Cole (Ray Liotta), ends up taking really long showers. Cole is married to an immigration lawyer, Denise (Ashley Judd), who wants to adopt the African child (Ogechi Egonu)  languishing in the same detention center that Taslima lands in. It’s all just one big circle of life, which doubtless explains why Mr. Kramer routinely tries to bridge these stories with aerial images of Southern California freeways, where people of every origin flow together except, you know, during rush hour.  “Crossing Over” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Graphic gun violence, strong language and the occasionally bared female breast and buttock.

You can feel the characters being moved around like pieces on a chessboard in "Crossing Over," an overweeningly deterministic mosaic of U.S. immigration case studies. Unlike "Crash," to which it invites comparisons due to its identical structure, Los Angeles setting and similar socially conscious intent, Wayne Kramer's film at least remains cognizant of why people want to come to the United States in the first place, and more plausibly blends positive and negative events. However, the way the picture dwells almost exclusively on cinematically exploitable elements -- gangbanger crime, prostitution, honor killing, terrorism paranoia -- gives it a sordid patina that even the classy, able thesps can't offset. Harrison Ford's presence atop the ensemble cast should boost this Weinstein Co. release to a decent opening, but longer-term prospects are modest.
A transplant himself -- from South Africa, in 1986 -- Kramer has come up with a wider range of immigrant stories than is the norm, in that the vignettes don't predominantly deal with poor, Spanish-speaking characters from south of the border. Granted, the opening scene features a sweatshop raid led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Max Brogan (Ford), in which a young Mexican mother (Alice Braga) is taken away to be deported despite her having a young son, whose welfare Brogan decides to make his business.
But the way the film's attention fans out provides some welcome fresh angles on the wide variety of the immigrant experience, in particular the illicit ways in which some, specifically those with showbiz aspirations, try to obtain real green cards or create phony ones.
Brit Gavin Kossef (Jim Sturgess) and Aussie Claire Sheperd (Alice Eve) are a couple who have grown apart, it is suggested, due to their uncertain status in the country. Gavin, an aspiring singer and atheistic Jew, plays club gigs and gets a job teaching music at a Jewish school on condition that he study the religion and keep his illegal status secret. Foxy blonde Claire, desperate to become "the next Nicole or Naomi," makes a huge moral compromise after a chance meeting with Cole Frankel (Ray Liotta), a middle-aged green-card application adjudicator, agreeing to have sex with him for two months if he greases the path for her residency. This doesn't go down too well with Gavin.
Brogan's tough ICE partner Hamid Baraheri (Cliff Curtis) is of Iranian descent and his father, an enormously wealthy businessman who fled the 1979 revolution, is about to be finally naturalized an American citizen. However, the old man is none too pleased about what the New World has done to the morals of his daughter Zahra (Melody Khazae), who's consorting with a counterfeiter -- who's been helping out Claire.
And so the dots begin to connect in Kramer's screenplay, which is credible enough in its observations of assorted immigrant dilemmas but, when taken together, feels far too contrived due to the diverse characters' forced interconnectedness. The idea, of course, is to suggest how everyone -- citizens and illegals -- are in this together, and the challenge for the country is to figure out how to be as fair and just as possible.
Subplot of Cole's childless wife Denise (Ashley Judd), who just happens to be an immigration-preoccupied defense attorney, trying to convince her husband to adopt a Nigerian orphan is awfully ordinary and contrived, while another story strand involving a Korean teenager's (Justin Chon) walk on the wild side feels like rejected scenes from "Gran Torino." More bracing, although again nothing new, is the sorry fate of a Bangladeshi teenager (Summer Bishil, "Towelhead") who has the audacity to present a not-unsympathetic view of the 9/11 hijackers to a school class.
Sense of forced coincidences and ironies goes way over the top -- or under the bottom -- in a climactic scene in which some highly unsavory personal dramas are played out against the backdrop of a mass citizenship ceremony at the L.A. Convention Center. Although there are winners and losers among the immigrants and the officials who deal with them, Kramer wraps everything up too tidily.
Very low-key and performing several of his scenes in grammatical Spanish with a mile-wide American accent, Ford successfully suppresses his superstar aura to integrate himself into the ensemble. Most perfs are right on the nose, with no subtext, although Curtis and Eve convey the enormous turmoil roiling inside them stemming from their untenable situations.
Production values are solid.

Haven't we been here before? The inbred mutant offspring of Crash  and Babel , writer-director Wayne Kramer 's Crossing Over  treats the subject of illegal immigrants coming to (and from) Los Angeles with the same vulgarity that Kramer brought to his 2006 children-in-peril thriller Running Scared , this time (barely) concealed under a paper-thin plaster of Oscar-worthy self-importance.
Like the fictional New Jersey town that served as the backdrop for Kramer's previous film, Angel City is, for the filmmaker, yet another disenchanted urban forest filled with innocent maidens (Alice Eve  as an Australian actress trying to make it in Hollywood ), big, bad wolves (Ray Liotta  as the INS honcho who offers the Aussie a green card in exchange for daily buttfucking privileges), and world-weary armored knights (Harrison Ford  as the Immigration and Customs agent who never met a pretty illegal he didn't want to save). Similarly traveling along their own breadcrumb trails are a baker's dozen of black-, brown-, and yellow-skinned unfortunates on hand mainly to be crushed by the might of La Migra or squished under the steel-capped boot of post-9/11 racial profiling—which may nonetheless be preferable to getting rammed up the ass by Mr. Liotta's cock.
Crossing Over  begins earnestly enough as an old-fashioned exercise in Stanley Kramerish  consciousness-raising, with Ford wearing existential angst on his sleeve as a callous colleague reprimands him: "Jesus Christ , Brogan! Everything is a Goddamn humanitarian crisis with you!" From there, solemn overhead shots of freeways and skyscrapers serve as the Scotch tape crudely holding together the movie's myriad storylines. Lest we forget that white people suffer, too, an atheistic British singer-songwriter (Jim Sturgess ) masquerades as an observant Jew in order to obtain his much-coveted "status." Meanwhile, a Muslim teen (Summer Bishil ) gives a class report in defense of the 9/11 hijackers, then appears surprised to discover Homeland Security agents ransacking her bedroom. And an about-to-be-naturalized Korean youth (Justin Chon ) resists indoctrination into the very street gang one was certain Clint Eastwood  had already run out of town.
But by the time we arrive at the serendipitous meet-cute-by-car-wreck of Liotta's green-card gatekeeper and Eve's Kidman/Watts aspirant (who, by the way, happens to be the girlfriend of the counterfeit Semite), it's clear that we're firmly in the hands of the lurid Kramer we know, if don't necessarily love. Wouldn't she rather steal away with him for an afternoon quickie, he proposes, rather than end up in a San Pedro  detention center where "some mamma Latina makes you her bitch for a couple of nights"? Well, now that you put it that way. . . .
Never does Kramer encounter a cultural stereotype he can't repurpose. For most of Crossing Over , Ford's Iranian partner (played in a triumph of affirmative-action casting by New Zealander Cliff Curtis ) glowers so contemptuously at his cleavage-bearing sister that when the girl turns up with a bullet in her head, the only surprise is that the movie thinks it's a mystery. Meanwhile, when Ford travels south of the border in search of the deported sweatshop worker (Alice Braga ) who's captured his heart, I could all but swear that Kramer and cinematographer James Whitaker  slapped a brown filter on the camera, the better to emphasize the developing world's pervasive filth.
And so it goes, with Kramer—who doesn't really seem to like people very much—failing to muster even the superficial empathy the makers of the similarly programmatic The Visitor  and Rendition  showed toward their own cardboard-cutout imperiled illegals. Eventually, all points converge on a finale draped in patriotic imagery employed for maximum irony, as Kramer haphazardly cross-cuts between a naturalization ceremony and a deportation—not exactly The Godfather 's baptism by gunfire, in case you had any doubts.
There might be no more to say, were it not for the fact that Crossing Over  once counted that paragon of liberal virtue, Sean Penn , among its ensemble, before either poor test screenings or Penn's own request to be cut out of the film—depending on which rumor mill you believe—saw him excised. Reportedly, Penn's storyline involved a border patrol agent who crashes his car and subsequently "crosses over"—not from one country to another, but from this world to the next. Minus him, Kramer's film at least manages to clock in just under the two-hour mark. Praise Allah for that.
