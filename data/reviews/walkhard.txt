The creative forces behind Walk Hard
 adhere to one simple rule: If it�s funny once, it�ll be funny 10 times over. And throughout this absurdist spin on musical biopics, the good news is that sometimes they�re right. It is funny again. And again. And again. But conversely, sometimes it isn�t. Taking cues very specifically from Ray
 and Walk the Line
, this film spans 70 years in the life of its hero, the fictional music legend Dewey Cox (Reilly). As a child in rural Alabama, Dewey accidentally slices his older brother in two with a machete. This leads him to take up music, run off with his high school girlfriend (Wiig) and become a star. The story follows a rise-fall-and-rise-again structure as Dewey meets the love of his life (Fischer), develops multiple drug addictions, loses his love, finds her again, and along the way falls prey to every generational music trend in the book. Whether traveling to India with the Beatles, writing protest songs, or hosting a variety show, Dewey manages to enact all the rock & roll clich�s. And then some. Simultaneously dumb and enjoyable, the silliness manages at times to be both wonderful and cringe-worthy. In the end, Reilly�s oblivious swagger successfully carries much of the film. So while there were stretches without laughter, I was always seduced back into the fun thanks both to Reilly�s inspired performance and the creative audacity of co-writer/producer Judd Apatow (Superbad
) and co-writer/director Kasdan (Orange County
). Aside from Reilly, two clear stars emerge: the wardrobe and the music. The costumes (by Debra McGuire) are both oddly authentic and absurd. Similarly, the songs (written by a slew of artists, including Reilly, Apatow, and Kasdan) are genuine, ridiculous, and often very funny. With cameos by everyone from Jack White, Ghostface Killah, Lyle Lovett, and the Temptations, the film is also a veritable who�s who from Apatow�s unofficial comedy troupe. In this case, that includes Starr (Knocked Up
) and Rudd (who portrays John Lennon in one of the movie�s funniest scenes � where Schwartzman�s Ringo Starr is truly inspired). And when the penis jokes linger (which is often), it�s apparent that the sharp comic forces behind this epic are simply a couple of juvenile men who think it�s hilarious to show a man�s penis on screen just for the sake of itself. But the embarrassing truth is that, well, sometimes it is.


The first 30 or so minutes of "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" condense the entire Hollywood biopic genre into a sweet chewable tablet. It's the Flintstones vitamin of spoofs. (However, it is not recommended for actual Flintstones chewers.)
In one of the opening scenes, we see our tall gawky hero, Dewford Cox (a great John C. Reilly), leaning against a wall. He's got a minute before he's set to take the stage. But wait, his drummer tells the stage manager, Dewey has to go over his entire life's story before he plays. And that scene melts back to the farm Dewey grew up on, while the soundtrack pours mellifluous gospel moaning all over the pastoral imagery.
The movie gives us the scarring family tragedy ("I'm cut in half pretty bad," says Dewey's brother), the discovery of his early musical genius (he learns the blues in about two seconds), the ascent to fame, the instantly dysfunctional marriage, the introduction to drugs, the luscious new wife, the collapse (jail, rehab), and the comeback. That the makers of "Walk Hard" - director Jake Kasdan wrote the movie with Judd Apatow - manage do all this in about half the time it takes to watch a "Behind the Music" is part of what makes it such a carbonated treat.
Like the "Scary Movie" series, "Walk Hard" is a comedy that doubles as obscene film criticism. The tired tropes and clichés of Hollywood music biography (about Jim Morrison, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, et al.) get beaned hard with a dodge ball. One of the best gags is that Reilly is already playing Dewey at age14. A year later comes this line to spouse one, whose mantra is "Give up your dreams": "I think I'm doing all right for a 15-year-old with a wife and a baby!"
"Walk Hard" is pure "Weird Al" Yankovic pop prank - impersonation that merges homage and disrespect into confection. This brisk bliss is short-lived, though, as Kasdan and Apatow's ambition gets the best of them. Three or four awesome novelty singles strive to make up an album. But when is the last time you listened to an entire Weird Al record? In essence, the movie becomes one of the fish in the barrel it's shooting. This should be over in 35 minutes but goes on for another hour.
There are gold nuggets strewn about those 60 minutes - like the vulgar, crassly fused hip-hop mash-up that resuscitates old Dewey's career (race is deftly toyed with). The cast is uniformly committed to the movie's nonsense, from the "Saturday Night Live" alums, like Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell (these two need a show of their own), to current "SNL" player Kristen Wiig. Jenna Fischer - Pam from "The Office" - plays Dewey's second wife. On TV, she can seem self-doubtingly sad even when she's smiling. Here Fischer is very funny anyway, both when her feet are in the air and when they're kicking Dewey out of her life. Reilly, meanwhile, is like Will Ferrell with a vastly human third dimension.
Even so, fatigue sets in. Since "Walk Hard" is essentially lacking in drama, the gags move laterally, and they can stand more or less independent of each other. It's not building toward anything. So you're free to drift in and out if you please, to make your own playlist of the movie's greatest hits. Speaking of which, Dewey's songs are smart little rockabilly, pop, and country numbers that Apatow, Kasdan, and others wrote, and that Reilly intones with hearty sincerity. The movie stays with you for about 10 minutes. The music, though, suggests that while Dewey Cox might have been a cartoon, he was certainly an achy-breaky one.


Walk Hard , a parody of warts-and-all pop-star biopics, comes out of the Judd Apatow factory (he produced and co-wrote it), and at first it appears to be nothing more or less than this year's model of Epic Movie, Not Another Teen Movie , and all those other happy-idiot genre spoofs that descend from the Airplane!  school of artfully hyperbolic razzing. Directed by Jake Kasdan, the movie tells the story of Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly), a doltish country-rocker who becomes a star, meets a stage partner (sparkly Jenna Fischer) as prudish as a nun, and enjoys a rise to legend status matched only by his druggy, Daddy didn't love me!  fall. A handful of the jokes score (the boy Dewey slicing his brother in half, which inspires his dad's refrain of ''The wrong kid died!''), a few fall flat (a not-dirty-enough tweak of dirty dancing), and most are mildly clever enough to keep you grinning.
The movie walks the line of surreal vulgarity (you will not, repeat not , expect the penis), yet most of it, intentionally, is less nutzoid than your average megaplex genre parody. It's a teensy bit straighter , and that's a good thing, since it allows Kasdan to take on not just the clichés of the biopic but the emotions as well. He skewers the spirit of rock history. As Dewey moves into the hippie '60s, then the variety-show '70s, Reilly lends his weariness a goofy heart. Walk Hard  isn't merciless (except for maybe one wicked sequence with the Beatles), and that's because it so loves what it's sending up: the pleasure, ego, and sheer exhaustion of what happens behind the music.

 “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” has a good beat and you can dance to it, though mostly you’ll probably just tap your foot. It’s a cleverly packaged story about a patently phony musician — er, John C. Reilly is Dewey Cox — who conquers the nation’s eardrums with a song in his heart, a guitar in his hands and a million clichés in his DNA. He’s a tuneful pastiche: a little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll, topped off with a pinch of Ray Charles, a dash of Buddy Holly and a whole mess of Johnny Cash as filtered through Joaquin Phoenix’s impersonation and mischievously repurposed through the Judd Apatow laugh factory.  Mr. Apatow wrote the screenplay with the director Jake Kasdan, though given how close the two follow the recent biopic template some credit rightly belongs to the writers of “Ray” and “Walk the Line.” Like those films, “Walk Hard” tells an upbeat story about a great talent who finds renown, but also stumbles into temptation. “Ray” and “Walk the Line” are soft targets, near-parodies of the form, which suits this film just fine since Mr. Apatow and Mr. Kasdan have no plans to burn down the house. Dewey doesn’t shoot up backstage or beat his woman, much less drown in his vomit or hang himself in the family kitchen, as Ian Curtis does in “Control,” the downbeat version of the same old rock ’n’ roll story.  Born to be mild, Dewey is cuddly and cute, not Iggy or pop. Partly as a consequence, the film is more funny ha-ha than LOL; it’s a smarty-pants satire that mocks and embraces almost every cliché in the biography playbook. The usual characters enter on cue, hitting their marks and the expected emotional notes, including Ma Cox (the wonderful Margo Martindale) and Pa Cox (Raymond J. Barry), who rear  Dewey in a shotgun shack not far from where Ray Charles played in the dirt before he grew up to become Jamie Foxx and win an Academy Award. Like Ray, Dewey is a musical prodigy, and it isn’t long before he’s making the girls swoon. But by then he’s become Buddy Holly with a child bride more befitting Jerry Lee Lewis.  Mr. Kasdan is an observant student, and “Walk Hard” glitters with recycled biopic verisimilitude, from the cars to the clothes to the nagging first wife (Kristen Wiig) and especially the music. Written by a team of collaborators, the close to 20 songs jump from early rock ’n’ roll (“Take my ha-ha-hand”) to the Johnny Cash-style anthem of the film’s title and a genius Dylan-esque rune delivered in twanging singsong, in which “mailboxes drip like lampposts in the twisted birth canal of the coliseum,” “fairy teapots mask the temper tantrum/O’ say can you see ’em,” “stuffed cabbage is the darling of the Laundromat,” and  The mouse with the overbite explained  how the rabbits were ensnared  ’N the skinny scanty sylph trashed the apothecary diplomat  Inside the three-eyed monkey within inches of his toaster-oven life.  Dewey’s “Don’t Look Back” period takes place in the black-and-white 1960s familiar from D. A. Pennebaker’s documentary and now, of course, the Todd Haynes-Cate Blanchett take on that same period in “I’m Not There.” Mr. Kasdan shifts visual styles, or at least color schemes, as often as Dewey changes outfits. But despite the kaleidoscopic twirling, time traveling and a giddy visit with the Beatles in India, “Walk Hard” is surprisingly flat. Part of the problem is that it sticks so close to the films that inspired it that it actually echoes some of their flaws. The June Carter-Reese Witherspoon story in “Walk the Line” was pretty much a drag; the sendup in “Walk Hard,” which features Jenna Fischer as Darlene, is so accurate that it is too.  The reliably enjoyable Mr. Reilly doesn’t bring any real modulation to Dewey or his phases, just good vibrations. He’s fun to hang around, even though I wish he and the film had made room for madness and not only faithful mimicry. Like all of Mr. Apatow’s films, “Walk Hard” is naughty, but it’s also awfully nice, a word that has no place in rock ’n’ roll. Maybe that’s why I kept waiting (hoping) for the Dewey Cox promised in the film’s poster, which shows Mr. Reilly — in homage to Jim Morrison — wearing only a necklace and a goofy, what-me-worry gape. He still looks more like Alfred E. Neuman than the Lizard King, true, but there he also seems on the actual verge of letting it all hang out.  “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.

At first this "Walk the Line" sendup sounds more like a sketch than a movie, before director Jake Kasdan and co-writer/producer Judd Apatow broaden it to include every tic of the musical biopic, from "The Buddy Holly Story" through the current wave. "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" thus strums the genre for considerable laughs, with John C. Reilly playing the title balladeer from teen to senior citizen, generating enough goodwill to offset the flat sections and a decidedly juvenile streak. While unlikely to rival Apatow's recent hits, box office should sing a merry little tune as a raunchy Oscar-bait alternative.
Hewing more toward "Airplane!" territory than he has previously, Apatow incorporates members of his repertory company in what amounts to a variety of amusing cameos, such as Paul Rudd popping up as one of the Beatles. For whatever reason, this Sony release also features a vast assortment of NBC's comedy talent, starting with "The Office's" Jenna Fischer and "Saturday Night Live's" Kristen Wiig as the protagonist's overlapping wives.
Infused with a adolescent streak that revels in its R rating and never seems to tire of puns derived from Dewey's last name, pic dutifully chronicles the life of Reilly's Cox from well-telegraphed boyhood tragedy to unexpected stardom to drug abuse, despite half-hearted "You don't want to try this" warnings from band member Sam (Tim Meadows).
Along the way, Apatow and Kasdan (coming off the satirical "The TV Set") zero in on a surprising number of spoof-worthy conventions within these films: The star playing his character starting at a ridiculously young age (when Reilly takes over as Dewey, he's 14); black characters bursting into raucous dance when a budding white singer lets loose; nurturing Jewish (here, Hassidic) record executives; and the excess that invariably accompanies stardom -- in Dewey's case, not just drugs but destructive rages that consistently wreak havoc on bathroom fixtures.
Having worked out his comedy chops for Apatow in "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Reilly not only belts out the double-entendre-laden tunes -- one of which sounds impressively like Roy Orbison -- but unabashedly dives into the silliness of the role. Fischer also makes the most of her turn as the backup singer who wins Dewey's heart but, much to his chagrin, keeps withholding her body.
"Walk Hard" employs a quartet of songwriters -- among them Marshall Crenshaw -- to cleverly craft Dewey's songography, which should yield a dynamite tie-in novelty soundtrack. One suspects many a young lad will find himself humming, "In my dreams, you're blowin' me (pause) sweet kisses," perhaps even inadvertently.
By its very nature, the movie is episodic in its chronological stroll through Dewey's fictional life, and not all the bits (among them a "Yellow Submarine"-like acid trip) work equally well. Fortunately, there's a general exuberance and fondness for the musical material that eases the rough spots, down to meticulous technical touches ranging from the evolving costumes and hairdos to the conspicuous makeup as Dewey enters his "Driving Miss Daisy" years.
For Apatow, "Walk Hard" also continues to demonstrate that gleefully embracing R-rated comedy needn't be reserved for DVD extras; rather, it's possible to walk hard, laugh hard and still earn hard -- a formula that's surely music to any studio's ears.

As an actor, John C. Reilly  is the opposite of Mr. Cellophane. He doesn't disappear into a role; roles disappear onto himthe unlikely porn sidekick of Boogie Nights , the inadequately adequate family man of The Hours , the cutup cowboy of A Prairie Home Companion , all stamped and imprinted with the actor's doughy kisser. The only catch is, the role has to exist first. He's a character actor in the true sense: He'll provide the perfect coatrack, but someone's got to hand him a coat.
As Dewey Cox, a hard-livin', hard-lovin', hard-everythingin' singer with a Zelig-like proximity to every major music figure of the past 50 years, Reilly cuts a hilarious and electrifying figurelive. On a recent promo tour, playing Nashville's Mercy Lounge in a concert that was part Spinal Tap  , part Hedwig and the Angry Inch , and completely riotous, Reilly slipped hungrily into the guise of a surly, self-obsessed spotlight hog. Surprisingly lithe and snake-hipped, he played selections from his protest-singer phase ("not that I believed in that shit"), bestowed female patrons with hankies steeped in ball sweat, and congratulated the crowd for its taste: "I've never heard so many men say, 'I love Cox!' " His Dewey was an arrogant bastardand more important, he was funny as hell.
Sadly, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story  isn't. And seeing Reilly perform the material live only points out how fundamentally misconceived this barrage of dry-docked yacht-rock gags is at every levelstarting with its flaccid Cox. (Live by the dick joke, die by the dick joke.) It's not that the pop biopic isn't ossified enough to get its own Epic / Date /Scary Movie : There were moments, watching La Vie en Rose  and Ray , when you could swear it already had. You better walk the line, Johnny Cash ! Hit the road, Ray Charles ! Vous ne regrettez rien , Edith Piaf ! But this burlesque of biopic clichés flounders from one setup to the next without the engine that drives the genre: a strong central character.
Scripted by the high-powered team of Judd Apatow  and Jake Kasdan  and directed by Kasdan, Walk Hard  often plays like scene-for-scene nose-thumbing at Walk the Line . Only Dewey is less a Man in Black than a twerp in twill: a humble country boy who steps forward at his high-school talent show to croon a mushy ballad. This being a pop biopic, it takes all of a stanza to induce a riot, prompt cries of "It's the Devil's music!" and unleash an epidemic of teenage lust. It also bum-rushes Dewey down the path to stardom, leading to an affair with dewy duet partner Darlene (Jenna Fischer , in a Reese Witherspoon  parody that's one joke shy of a one-joke part) as well as busted marriages, drug addiction, patricideand, at rock bottom, his own '70s variety show.
Reilly's Roy Orbison ish tenor is game for anything from funk to punk, and he's been given a ready-made hit parade of clever knockoffs. Had Dewey been the mean, obscene sex machine of Reilly's live shows, Walk Hard  might've been a hootat least as funny as the recent Will Ferrell  comedies it resembles, down to the unnecessary attempt to make the self-infatuated hero ultimately lovable.
But Dewey doesn't hang together as a character. He's a blank festooned with ill-fitting traits swiped from a season's worth of Behind the Music s, and when the movie isn't sending up something specificCash's drug habit, Dylan's protest singing, Brian Wilson 's obsessive maniaReilly has nothing to play. (Maybe this  is the movie that should've been called I'm Not There .) Gag-a-minute Airplane! -style comedy isn't Apatow's or Kasdan's strong suit, either. Even when the skewering of bio tropes is spot-onas in the obligatory conquering-the-charts montage for a single "recorded just 35 minutes ago!"the timing is off, stifled by Kasdan's needlessly glossy direction or Apatow's ability to flog a running joke into whimpering exhaustion.
The biggest laughs come from players who know how to hit their sketch-comedy marks quickly and move on: from Tim Meadows  as Dewey's drummer, whose antidrug warnings inevitably turn into a can't-resist come-hither, to Harold Ramis  as Mad  magazine's idea of a Jewish record mogul, more likely to cut foreskins than 45s. The rest of the movie blows through opportunities like Mötley Crüe  through coke money. It takes almost a perverse determination to put Jack Black , Paul Rudd , Jason Schwartzman , and Justin Long  in a room together as the Beatles , then give them so little to do that even Eddie Vedder 's cameo as an awards-show presenter smokes them. (The DVD extras will almost certainly be better.) Walk Hard  limps softbut if John C. Reilly turns up anywhere onstage in your town, go. If there's anything America needs now, it's more Cox.
