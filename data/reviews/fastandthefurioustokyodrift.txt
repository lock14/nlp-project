The third installment in this flashy, wildly successful franchise opens with a bravura demolition derby through a developing suburban neighborhood. As cars barrel through half-built houses while rap-rock blares over the film's bone-crushing sound design, it's easy to feel the testosterone-fueled adrenaline buzz that made the first film a hit. Granted, the sequence is implausible, overblown, poorly written, and a bit misogynistic, but anyone buying a ticket to the third Fast and Furious
 film should be ready for all of that. Unfortunately, the rest of the film will likely disappoint even diehard fans as it plods through worthless characterization and mediocre race sequences, then fizzles without ever approaching the audacious energy of the introduction. Lucas Black (Friday Night Lights)
 takes the driver's seat this time as Sean Boswell, a racing enthusiast who joins his estranged father in Japan to dodge the numerous legal repercussions of his suburban joyride. Once in Tokyo, he quickly becomes entrenched in the city's racing underworld, which, as it turns out, holds close ties with the yakuza. But the organized-crime subplot proves inconsequential; the film's focus is racing and, more specifically, drifting, a technique that involves fishtailing around sharp corners or, in some cases, spiral parking garage ramps. It's a pretty neat trick. Soon though, the novelty wears off, and director Lin (who previously helmed the bold but shallow teen thriller Better Luck Tomorrow
 and the universally panned Annapolis
) offers nothing to up the ante. Perhaps sensing this problem, Lin spends much of the film's second act developing Boswell's friendships and rivalries during his adjustment to the new locale. These long detours take him to a number of glitzy nightclubs and equally glitzy garages with plenty of beautiful women, but they kill the pacing of the film. Worse, Boswell is possibly the dumbest, least charming protagonist to ever grace this sort of film. He speaks exclusively in cliché fragments, which Black delivers like a casting reject from  Varsity Blues 
 on downers. And, with the exception of actor Sung Kang, who lends a bit of enigmatic charm to his equally awful lines, Boswell's friends aren't much fun either. But I digress. For all functional purposes, Boswell shouldnâ€™t even be talking to his friends. He should be racing! For the third entry in a series known for its excess, Tokyo Drift
 includes surprisingly few destructive driving spectacles. Also, sans the opening scene and an early drifting race through a parking garage, Lin shows almost no imagination when directing the spurts of automobile mayhem. To his credit, he uses minimal CGI, but every race still amounts to a series of hyper-fast cuts that never gives the audience a chance to situate itself in the action. And of course, it's all shot like a car commercial. Racing junkies would be better off browsing the myriad online drifting videos where the camera doesn't cut and the people don't speak. Film buffs would be better off watching Two-Lane Blacktop
, but they probably already knew that.


About the ``Tokyo Drift" in that subtitle of the latest installment of ``The Fast and the Furious": What is it?
Sounds like an environmental crisis or a nightclub craze. Really, it's just a game race cars play -- like demolition derby where drivers are challenged not to demolish anything.
The cars only flirt with destruction. And the movie only flirts with entertainment.
Taking over for Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Tyrese, the missing stars of the first two movies, is Lucas Black, an Alabaman who is half their size but twice their seriousness. He drives with all his might.
Black plays Sean Boswell, a nomadic high schooler with a bracing Southern drawl and a felonious addiction to speeding. At his brand new school, Sean gets into a fight with the cocky blond jock before the movie even firmly establishes what his archetype is. They settle their beef with a race whose prize is the jock's dumb blond girlfriend.
She's not worth it, but they're off anyway. Property is damaged, faces are bloodied, and the law comes down on Sean. To save him from juvie he's shipped to Tokyo to live with his negligent Navy dad (Brian Goodman), who forbids him from going near a car. Nice try.
A fellow American (Bow Wow, playing a cornrowed gearhead named Twinkie) brings Sean underground into the city's drift culture, whose kids congregate in massive parking garages where every night appears to be Friday night. Because the movie's three screenwriters appear to lack any imagination about plot -- and women -- Sean finds himself right back where he started in his last school: the bully's vamp girlfriend, Neela (Nathalie Kelley), has the hots for him.
There's a rub this time. D.K. (Brian Tee), the cool Tokyo toughie, is a yakuza, and he wants to drift against Sean, who knows only how to drive like a Duke out of Hazzard.
His first race is a flop, but Han (Sung Kang), the kid who loans him his car, agrees to teach him the right moves in time for the climactic showdown. In the meantime, there are fistfights, indigestibly deplorable dialogue, comely dudes and chicks for the camera to ogle, and an impressive cross-section of hip-hop and Japanese rock that helps pass the time.
Oh, and Sonny Chiba, as a cigarillo-chomping gangster. The martial-arts star's mock-menacing performance is the only one you couldn't mistake for lumber.
``Tokyo Drift" does give us a Tokyo mostly unsullied by the American cultural indifference that makes Sofia Coppola's ``Lost in Translation" exasperating with repeat viewings. Director Justin Lin uses the city as a touristy backdrop, but he doesn't turn it into a hipster's freak show either -- although I was disappointed that the sea of Harajuku girls never parted to reveal a Gwen Stefani number.
This Tokyo is even a more convincing melting pot than the all-white American high school we see earlier. The best thing about these ``Fast and Furious" movies is the uncommon way they take the multiracial and the multicultural for granted.
Lin also manages to make explicit what the previous two installments merely implied. The ``F&F" series is the 21st century's beach movie, one for some beachless future world where the kids are crowning 25 and seem capable of living off of hair gel and exhaust fumes. The car races stand in for the musical numbers; they're just as dopey and underwhelming. And even though no one here is as charismatic as Frankie and Annette, everybody appears to be having as much fun.

         As of today "Cars" is not the only automotive movie in town. "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift" has motored onto screens everywhere, and it is a whole different box of gears. Sort of.
 
 This third installment of the popular series about fast cars and the posturing boys who love them is best viewed as an energetic cartoon, an unintentionally amusing, head-shaking guilty pleasure that will divert those not in the mood for anything more profound than gleaming metal and preening women.
 


         






    Savvy producer Neal H. Moritz has taken to calling "Tokyo Drift" "a lifestyle movie," which apparently means it depicts a way of life so fantastical and preposterous no one could possibly live it for real.
 
 Set in what an on-screen title tells us is "Tokyo, Japan" (to differentiate it from the many other Tokyos that presumably dot the globe), "Tokyo Drift" is in love with all things automotive to an extent that might be called carnographic. This is a film in which the seven primary cars have as much personality as the characters who drive them and a company that provided the "Japanese high performance clutches" gets major thanks in the credits.
 
 But you always hurt the one you love, especially in movies like this, and cars, outfitted with tires that do more squealing than a roomful of Justin Timberlake fans, do take quite a beating.
 
  As orchestrated by legendary second unit director-stunt coordinator Terry Leonard, the film's chases and races utilized close to 250 vehicles, cutting up 25 and destroying more than 80. That's why the film ends with the stern reminder (intended, no doubt, for the same people who didn't know Tokyo was in Japan) that "the motor vehicle action sequences depicted in this film are dangerous." In case you were wondering.
 
  Not so banged up are the film's numberless lithe young Japanese women in tiny Sanja Milkovic Hays-designed miniskirts who masochistically flock to young men who lust mainly after cars.
 
 There are so many it seems there must have been an eye-candy casting director working full time to corral this particular coalition of the willing.
 
  Given all this attention to "lifestyle," Justin Lin ("Better Luck Tomorrow") was a smart choice to direct. One of the many Sundance alumni who've gone on to mainstream careers, Lin's ability to treat an overly familiar tale with complete seriousness (evident also in the James Franco-starring "Annapolis") is just what this film needs to be all that it can be.
 
  Filled with actors chosen for their ability to convey attitude as much as anything else, "Tokyo Drift" does especially well with charismatic Alabama-born Lucas Black ("Jarhead," "Friday Night Lights") as protagonist Sean Boswell.
 
 Screenwriter Chris Morgan starts the film with an American prelude that establishes Sean as an anti-authority type way too cool for high school, a Steve McQueen knockoff who, as someone says later, "doesn't just play with fire but soaks the matches in gasoline."
 
 An ill-advised "Rebel Without a Cause"-influenced race ends badly for Sean and he has to get out of town, way out. That means Tokyo (the one in Japan), where his divorced father conveniently lives.
 
 "Drift," which could have been subtitled "Plausibility Takes a Holiday," thinks it's perfectly reasonable to send Sean to a high school where the teaching is done exclusively in Japanese. Not that it matters, he's never there anyway, he's up to his crank shaft in racing Japanese style.
 
 After picking up a sidekick (Bow Wow) and becoming infatuated with a classmate (Nathalie Kelley), Sean learns that her boyfriend (Brian Tee) is nicknamed D.K. because he is the drift king, the master of a style of racing that involves the kind of controlled sliding that, oddly enough, resembles the technique Lightning McQueen has to learn in "Cars."
 
  Under the tutelage of the Zen-like Han (Sung Kang), Sean picks up pointers on drifting and absorbs the kind of lessons ("Life's simple: You make choices and you don't look back") "Tokyo Drift's" intended audience will likely regard as profound.
 
 Naturally, there is a big race at the end of this episode of "The Fast and the Furious," and it involves a Yakuza crime boss (action veteran Sonny Chiba) and considerable drifting, both morally and automotively.
 
 If there is a better way to learn a lesson about life than nearly killing yourself behind the wheel, Hollywood has yet to discover it.

The third movie in the Bad News Bears  series, a notable turkey, went to Japan. That trip spells certain doom for the Fast and the Furious  franchise as well. Dubbed Tokyo Drift  (but let's call it 3 Fast 3 Furious ), this junker ships Friday Night Lights ' Lucas Black abroad as punishment (to Tokyo? Lucky jackass!) after he hot-rods through a Phoenix housing development to the tune of that blasted Kid Rock ''Bawitdaba'' song. Once overseas, he tries ''drifting,'' a wavy, tractionless, sorta psychedelic, poky race style whose poorly shot appeal gets lost in translation.

 A number of questions spring to mind when considering "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift." Can the movies possibly get any faster or more furious? What exactly is the Tokyo Drift? And does Al Gore know what we can do to stop it?  Drifting, as it turns out, is the ancient Japanese art of gunning your hot rod through hairpin turns in such a manner that it rockets sideways while heavy metal music thunders on the soundtrack. In the film it is practiced by a gang of aspiring yakuza gearheads who hang out in parking structures taking cellphone pictures of their custom paint jobs.  "Tokyo Drift" is about all of the rapid, peevish things that happen when the American bad boy Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) arrives on their scene. As in the previous two installments of the "Fast and Furious" franchise, this largely consists of macho tantrums, vying for the girl, intense vehicular mayhem and high-octane homoeroticism.  The director, Justin Lin, proves that his overrated indie debut "Better Luck Tomorrow" was a Hollywood calling card, while the writer, Chris Morgan, delivers none of the B-movie kicks that made "Cellular" such a gas. The rapper Bow Wow co-stars with product placements by Nissan.  "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Cars crash, people cuss, and the global warming apocalypse inches significantly closer.

A used chassis gets a new supercharged engine in "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift." Pumping high-performance gas back into the series after a second lap sputter, third entry stays in high gear most of the way with several exhilarating racing sequences, and benefits greatly from the evocative Japanese setting. As what's onscreen amply reflects the title, franchise fan base looks to be well satisfied, meaning domestic take shouldn't be far off the $144 million and $127 million raked in respectively by the initial entries.
Real action this time, however, looks to come from overseas, particularly Asia. Universal no doubt took particular note of how foreign grosses jumped dramatically between the 2001 original and the 2003 follow-up, from $63 million to $109 million; this one could go faster and further still.
Pic is good, old-fashioned genre filmmaking done in a no-nonsense, unpretentious style rarely seen these days. The plot, about a chronic bad boy sent overseas to get straightened out, is entirely formulaic and exists mainly to connect the dots between the action: Western showdowns with guns at high noon have been replaced by challenge races with cars at midnight.
You've seen it all before, except that you haven't, not quite this way. Series producer Neal H. Moritz found something cinematically novel in the Japanese-born driving style known as drifting, which involves sweeping sideways through turns without traction, but with great precision. Technique proves highly photogenic and brings out a knack for kinetic filmmaking in director Justin Lin that was not even hinted at in his previous work -- certainly not in his debut feature, "Better Luck Tomorrow."
Only problem with the California-set opening sequence is that it's so good, the film can't top it. In a classic American high school set-up, cocky ne'er-do-well Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) takes on the top jock in a drag race, the prize being the football player's blond girlfriend. Imaginatively staged on the empty streets of a housing development that's under construction, the cutthroat contest is rough, thrilling, funny and ultimately surprising.
Upshot is that, to avoid jail time, Sean is packed off to live with his long-estranged dad (Brian Goodman), a Tokyo-based U.S. Navy lifer who will presumably whip wild Sean into shape. His first rule -- that his son must stay away from cars -- is, of course, immediately broken, when Sean is taken to a wild parking-garage party filled with fabulous girls, tough-looking guys and loads of incredibly expensive cars.
Eager to strut his stuff, Sean impulsively challenges the most dangerous young man there, D.K. (Brian Tee) to a race. Little does Sean known that D.K. stands for Drift King, and he soon gets a bruising lesson in what drifting is all about in an incredible speed scene highlighted by the Japanese driver's sliding through the corkscrew parking lot ramp without scratching his 460 hp Nissan 350Z.
Like the injured Marlon Brando learning to shoot again while staying at the Japanese fishing village in "One-Eyed Jacks," Sean retreats to nurse his wounded ego and relearn everything he thought he knew about driving, all under the tutelage of Han (Sung Kang). Han, a sometime D.K. flunky, makes Sean do dirty collection work, as D.K. turns out to be the nephew of big-time yakuza boss Uncle Kamata (JJ Sonny Chiba).
To make matters worse, gaijin Sean, who has a heavy Southern accent, gets a flirty thing going with D.K.'s girlfriend, fellow foreigner and student Neela (Nathalie Kelley), an Aussie-Asian stunner who identifies with Sean's outsider status, as do Han and hustling student entrepreneur Twinkie (Bow Wow).
Screenwriter Chris Morgan knows his way around genre requirements, supplying just enough personality traits to set characters in the viewer's mind and conveying their desires and attitudes in effective verbal shorthand. Greatest narrative challenge was no doubt coming up with excuses to stage some sort of race every 15 minutes or so, a task the filmmakers have met with flying colors.
Naturally, the climax offers the inevitable rematch between the now-drift-skilled Sean and D.K.Wrap-up may be predictable, but you wouldn't want it any other way, and it's followed by a vastly amusing coda featuring an unbilled appearance by a certain muscled star of the first "The Fast and the Furious."
Black, who broke through in "Friday Night Lights," is quite appealing as a habitual screw-up who keeps his self-assurance and sense of humor through a long stretch of adversity. Supporting characters are stock -- fast-talking con artist, alluring beauty, doomed risk-taker, condescending thug -- but Bow Wow, Kelley, Kang and Tee, respectively, make them lively company. Vet action star Chiba turns up in godfather attire as D.K.'s uncle and yakuza chief.
Lin and company cover a lot of ground in Tokyo, managing to express the city's mostly nighttime moods through a colorful variety of locations. Second unit director and stunt coordinator Terry J. Leonard deserves a special bow, and tech contributions are grittily sharp. Throbbing soundtrack is of a piece with the constantly revving engines.

Drifting, Tokyo or otherwise, is a fancy street-racing term for what amounts to a controlled skid. In person, where you could appreciate the difficulty and danger, it might be exciting, impressive, even beautiful. In a filmparticularly one as allergic to long takes as The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift it just looks like another digital effect. Lucas Black , playing a teenage outsider in the Beverly Hills, 90210   mold (driver's license says 17, chest hair says 23), is sent to live with his estranged father in Japan  after one too many traffic accidents. Dad acts like a hardass, then can't be bothered as Black falls in with the yakuza. By blending schlocky acting and laughably pretentious dialogue with sharp plot twists and peppy direction, the first Fast and the Furious  achieved a strange alchemical perfection as the ultimate dumb action movie. But like 2 Fast 2 Furious before it, Tokyo Drift  is a subculture in search of a compelling story line, and Black's leaden performance makes you pine for the days of Paul Walker .
