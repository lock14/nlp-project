An urban drama featuring talented young actors navigating the circuitous path to adulthood while spending their downtime at the local roller rink � didn't we already see this six months ago? You'll be forgiven for thinking this wicked smart examination of black kids in modern Atlanta might be in some way comparable to Malcolm D. Lee's recent homage to the Seventies � Roll Bounce
 (a fine, funky film in its own right) � but, apart from the twinned themes of roller skates and true-blue friendship, the comparisons end there. (Although if Lee and Robinson � not to mention ATL
's screenwriter Tina Gordon Chism, whose script is based on an original story by parking-attendant-turned-screenwriter Antwone Fisher, and Norman Vance Jr., the scripter of Roll Bounce
 � ever get together they might well create the greatest roller-skating drama the world has ever seen � sorry, Xanadu
.) Populated by a smooth, engaging cast of relative unknowns and hip-hop up-and-comers, Robinson's debut feature glides along with the thoughtful, honest assurance you'd expect from a more seasoned director and is buoyed by an eclectic soundtrack that mines both the past and future of hip-hop. Harris (aka Atlanta-based rapper T.I.) plays Rashad, the nominal head of a parentless household that also includes his Uncle George (Williamson) and younger brother Ant (Ross). When he's not pulling late nights with the family janitorial service or pining for ghetto-stunner-with-a-secret New-New (London), he's struggling to keep his more volatile brother out of the clutches of the neighborhood gangsta/drug dealer. It's only at the Cascade roller rink � which acts much as the burger stand in American Graffiti
 did � that Rashad and his posse can cut loose and pitch the proverbial woo restlessly circling their glittering, flat-track dreamland. Which, come to think of it, is as apt a metaphor for teenage life and its attendant emotional spirals as anything George Lucas has managed in 30 years. Much of the credit goes to writer Chism, who imbues even the most minor supporting players with far more nuanced characterizations than you might expect (Daniels' mouthy Brooklyn is a hoot, and Ross' conflicted Ant is as real as it gets). I'd be remiss not to mention the work of cinematographer Karsten Gopinath and editor David Blackburn, who together give what might have otherwise been a tedious rehash of Boyz N the Hood Go South
-isms a fluid, seamless, and genuinely exhilarating pulse. Despite a third-act tendency to gather a few spare genre clich�s as it rolls along (Guns! Drugs! Angry siblings!), Robinson's film is a cut above the rest, seeming simultaneously wise beyond its years and electrically, youthfully playful. Of course, it's not the ATX, but then, what is?


''ATL" is one of those filmic byproducts (in this case, a promotional vehicle for the rapper Tip Harris, a.k.a. T.I.) that somehow manage to emerge from the mill of commerce with their modesty preserved. The reek of synergy is strong -- the movie is being released the same week as T.I.'s album ''King" -- but so, in its unambitious way, is the script.
A hat-tip to the censor here: To secure the PG-13 rating that allows them to reach their target audience, the makers of ''ATL" were obliged to steer clear of the more sensational aspects of hip-hop movies and concentrate instead on producing a nice little story, in which the elements of teen romance, class-based drama, and ghetto morality tale are mingled with some expertise.
Is ''ATL" even a hip-hop movie? There's hip-hop in it, certainly, but unlike the recent vehicles for Eminem and 50 Cent -- respectively, ''8 Mile" and ''Get Rich or Die Tryin' " -- it does not have a rapper hero. Rashad (played by Harris) is not propelling himself out of the ghetto with his fast mouth. He is a meditative young man who sits doodling in his basement and dreams of having his cartoons published in the local funny pages. Rather than attempting to provide T.I. with a gunfire-heavy hip-hop back story, ''ATL" advertises the feminine virtues of gentleness, diligence, and the drawing of pretty things in one's journal.
ATL means Atlanta, and the setting for the movie is the outlying neighborhood of Mechanicsville. There Rashad lives with his younger brother Ant and Uncle George, going to school, working in the family business (a janitorial service called Swann Cleaning), and trying to keep his nose clean. The tearaway Ant, however, played by Evan Ross Naess, is more interested in the quick score and thus provides an entry into the story for the looming kingpin-figure Marcus (OutKast's Big Boi), who arrives in a quake of car stereo bass and recruits him into his drug army. Meanwhile, Rashad and his crew are perfecting their moves down at the local roller rink Cascade, and Rashad is becoming involved, via some PG-13 embraces, with the gorgeous New-New (Lauren London).
As for T.I., he proves himself a worthy vessel for the kind of teen dreams that ''ATL" is courting. Taut-necked but easy, sleepy-eyed but with a wakeful austerity in the leanness of his face, and showing a super-Southern drawl that tightens into a snarl when he's roused, he carries the film unproblematically on his slender shoulders. You just relax, he seems to be saying, and leave my imminent mega-stardom to me.


The young African-American gladiators in ATL  flash the kind of fierce dental bling Lil' Kim might dream about in the slammer. But the combat in this gentle ode to good pals and roller-skating nights in the bad hood is about as ferocious as a Saturday Night Fever  dance-off, or as dangerous as a corporate-tie-in soundtrack album. Mostly, Rashad (rapper Tip ''T.I.'' Harris) and his buddies just wanna get their skates on, hit the pinwheel- colored '80s-style rink called Cascade, and blow off everyday agita with spectacular choreographed team routines.
The more rink time, the better: As directed by hip-hop music-video king Chris Robinson from a story by Antwone Fisher 's Antwone Fisher, the skate scenes are a blast. It's when ATL  (that's home talk for Atlanta) attempts to be all genres to all audiences that the movie stumbles. While Rashad works out class differences with a ghetto-fab girlfriend who calls herself ''New-New'' (newcomer Lauren London, playing a character based on TLC's T-Boz) only when she sneaks out of her family's mansion, ATL  also throws in a Horatio Alger subplot and an antidrug fable featuring OutKast's Big Boi as the local dealer big boi. Really, all we wanna do is skate, skate, skate.

 Though the rap-fueled "ATL" is full of untested actors, the most amateurish thing about it, surprisingly, is the script. The cliché-marred story aspires to be a street-cred-level view of hard-luck black teenagers in Atlanta, yet it ends up — as an earlier generation of young people might have said — selling out to the establishment.  But forget the somewhat predictable tale, from a screenplay by Tina Gordon Chism and a story by Antwone Fisher (yes, the "Antwone Fisher" Antwone Fisher). The fun here is in seeing a new batch of rappers try acting, and some of them turn out to be eminently watchable. Tip Harris, better known as the Atlanta rapper T. I., displays a smoldering something-or-other as Rashad, a teenager who after the death of his parents has taken responsibility for raising his younger brother, Ant (played credibly by Evan Ross, son of Diana, in his film debut). And Antwan Andre Patton — Big Boi from OutKast — is very entertaining as the drug dealer who tries to draw Ant into his web.  The action centers on an Atlanta roller-skating rink, and it is here that the director, Chris Robinson, a veteran of music videos, seems most comfortable, creating some great-looking minivideos within the film. But elsewhere his music-video genes undercut the movie. He can't stay with a scene long enough to let his actors build momentum.  As for the story, this almost entirely black film borrows the blueprint from another, very white movie, "American Graffiti": teenagers about to graduate, hanging out at the rink/drag strip, wondering about their futures, hormones surging. If only it could have stayed honest till the end, as the earlier film did, rather than take the upbeat way out.  "ATL" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), mostly for moderately foul language.

A group of misfit Atlanta teenagers must compete with a luscious soundtrack and some impressively trippy camerawork in "ATL," the wildly undisciplined directorial debut of musicvideo maven Chris Robinson. Hitching a poor-boy-rich-girl romance to some conventional drug-dealing shenanigans, with a dash of last year's "Roll Bounce" thrown in for good measure, Warner Bros.' low-budget stab at capturing an urban niche audience is higher on stylistic dazzle than originality or coherence, making it an unlikely candidate to bust out of the box office ghetto.
As scripted by Tina Gordon Chism from a story by Antwone Fisher (who wrote and was the subject of "Antwone Fisher," 2002), this is the sort of movie where everyone is identified by a catchy nickname, a brief freeze-frame and a mouthful of introductory voiceover.
First up is Rashad (Tip Harris, better known as rapper T.I.), a reasonably well-adjusted black teen from Atlanta's south side who has been the self-proclaimed "man of the house" -- a home he shares with younger brother Ant (Evan Ross) and prickly uncle George (Mykelti Williamson) -- since the untimely deaths of his parents a few years ago.
Rashad's buddies are a familiar but likeable bunch that includes preppy Esquire (Jackie Long), tubby Brooklyn (an immensely likeable Albert Daniels) and perpetual high school flunkee Teddy (Jason Weaver). Amusingly mismatched group spends every Sunday night jamming at the Cascade roller-skating rink, where Rashad first meets a sharp-tongued beauty (assured newcomer Lauren London) whose name, New New, is almost as improbable as her hoop earrings.
Radiating ghetto-fabulous flair on the surface, New New guards a not-so-unpredictable secret. Script dovetails her dilemma cleverly with that of Esquire, whose relentless social-climbing leads him to ingratiate himself with successful businessman John Garnett (Keith David). Resulting conflict, if a tad schematic, says some interesting things about black social mobility, cultural legitimacy and the sense of pride that can readily attach itself to both the ghetto and the country club.
The sweet and entirely believable romance between Rashad and New New unfortunately has to share roughly equal screen time with some flat-footed comic bits (signaled by Aaron Zigman's score, which turns conspicuously wry at odd moments) and a stale subplot that sees Ant falling in with a group of drug dealers. Tonally, pic never gets a firm grip, wobbling between earnest sincerity and the lowbrow mockery of a blaxploitation picture, even introducing peripheral characters with names like Big Booty Judy for no real reason.
Robinson's direction is similarly all over the rink, achieving a near-contact high in the skating scenes that is aided in no small part by Devyne Stephens' choreography and Robb Buono's fabulous candy-colored production design. But for the most part, helmer is content to go flashily over-the-top, experimenting with varying lenses and bizarre angles rather than figuring out the ideal camera placement for a given scene.
In his bigscreen debut, Harris reveals himself to be an actor of charismatic reserve, while Williamson also registers strongly as the oafish but sympathetic George. London is almost too feisty in her early scenes -- a choice that makes sense, given her character's wavering sense of identity -- and heartbreaking in her later ones.
The supremely tasty soundtrack, with music supervision by Julia Michels, features nuggets like Ludacris' "Georgia" cover as well as a few tracks performed by Harris himself. Also figuring into the mix is hip-hop duo OutKast, whose Antwan Patton appears in a small role.

You may think you already know what it is: a cautionary 'hood-rap tale scarred by exit wounds and scored to booming basslinespop propaganda for the radio-ready soundtrack. But where lesser works have died trying, ATL  doesn't derive authenticity from criminality. Rather, it unpretentiously serves class consciousness and conflict with its Cadillac music, attempting to capturenot capitalize onthe Atlanta scene that's spawned an aesthetic and a mythology all its own, and is currently in full flourish. Music video vet Chris Robinson  distills a fine vintage from rich sources, namely his cast of (mostly) certified ATLiens who bring organic charisma to their character's interactions, playing them sweet like mash notes yet grown-ass as the men and women the tale's teens are trying to be. First and foremost is Tip Harris  (a/k/a T.I.), as a high school senior who spends his Sunday nights at a skate rink with his crew rather than adopt the dope boy lifestyle his younger bro aspires to. A debutant actor, T.I. seems equally at ease with his canny demeanor as with his mesmeric drawl, fluently swaggering between mellow and malicious from behind a winsome perma-squint. And as if channeling William Hurt 's latest villainous turn, Big Boi 's trapstar kingpin borders on self-parodic, delivering hilarious quips with bristling menace beneath. It's entertainment with ambition, but I can't front though; the soundtrack is pretty fly too.
