Rocket Science  is one of those terminally annoying, depressive-yet-coy Sundance faves in which the tale of a mopey teen misfit unfolds behind a hard candy shell of irony. The movie, set in Plainsboro, N.J., is too hip to ask you to feel sorry for Hal Hefner (Reece Daniel Thompson), a gawky, floppy-haired high school stutterer. Yet it never explores his psychology or anguish. His stuttering is presented as the behavioral equivalent of a dysfunctional halo  a trait that confers outsider status, and the ''innocence'' that goes with it. The director, Jeffrey Blitz, who made the acclaimed documentary Spellbound  (and who has discussed growing up as a stutterer himself), doesn't trust the audience to respond to the situations he creates. He turns everything into a glib indie commercial, from the speech pathologist who tells Hal ''It's really a shame you're not hyperactive'' to the brainiac Ginny (Anna Kendrick), who speaks in mile-a-minute sentences and pushes him onto the debate team.
Why filter such a personal story through the attitudinal tics of Wes Anderson and Napoleon Dynamite , especially if you're going to do it with about one-third the skill? Nothing in Rocket Science  quite parses. Ginny, the verbal genius, starts out with a crush on Hal (we can see why she might prefer a quiet boy), but then she takes a hostile turn that isn't remotely explained. And Thompson, who has a winning presence, isn't asked to show any anger  a glaring omission in a story of adolescent pain. Rocket Science  is a movie that never quite spits out what it has to say.

 Jeffrey Blitz’s tender but hardheaded “Rocket Science” plumbs the tormented consciousness of Hal Hefner (Reece Daniel Thompson), a fragile teenager with a paralyzing speech impediment that leaves him unable even to order lunch in his high school cafeteria. As he stands there desperately trying to articulate the words racing through his head (will it be pizza or fish?), you feel his excruciating humiliation.  Hal’s sense of helplessness and frustration is a metaphor for the insecurity and confusion felt by every sensitive soul trapped inside the bubble of adolescence. “Rocket Science” belongs to the genre of independent films, now a Sundance cliché, that contemplates the world from within that bubble. At the high end are movies like “Napoleon Dynamite” and “Rushmore.” Somewhat lower are movies like “The Chumscrubber” that are barely noticed.  This is a genre that insists (often annoyingly) on flaunting a supposedly rarefied sensibility. Your affection for “Rocket Science” will depend on the depth of your identification with Hal’s angst and the degree to which you regard high school as the ultimate microcosm of American life.  By any measure Hal is a supernerd. That means he has no compensatory skills. He may or may not be brilliant, but his potential is still locked inside his head. Mr. Blitz sympathizes with him unconditionally, and Mr. Thompson delivers a performance that is all the more appealing for his refusal to make Hal overtly self-pitying.  With “Rocket Science” Mr. Blitz makes a promising transition into feature films after his popular, charming documentary, “Spellbound.” Both films share an openhearted but unsentimental vision of America as a land of multicultural opportunity. In both films there is no such thing as normal; everybody is riddled with quirks.  The story’s cruel joke is that Hal, of all unlikely people, finds himself aggressively recruited by Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick), a smart, pretty, manipulative girl, to join the debate team. Ginny believes that if she drills Hal hard enough, he can conquer his speech impediment, although there is no specific evidence to support her intuition.  A brilliant debater, Ginny is also a virtuoso practitioner of an exercise called spreading, in which an argument is compressed into a 10-second rapid-fire delivery that makes the breakneck tongue-twisting list of Russian composers’ names in the Danny Kaye show-tune rap “Tchaikovsky” sound dawdling.  From the moment Ginny enters Hal’s life, he is smitten. Because the movie views her through his besotted eyes, it is never clear to what extent he is her personal cause and to what extent he is just a plaything. Their relationship, which begins promisingly and culminates in a passionate kiss, sours as Hal repeatedly fails in his debate trials. As she withdraws and changes schools, he desperately tries to contact her and repeatedly visits her home, where he receives a chilly reception.  Hal’s own home is splintered. Early in the movie his mother (Lisbeth Bartlett) kicks his cheating father (Denis O’Hare) out of the house in a fury. She takes up with the Korean-American father (Stephen Park) of one of Hal’s classmates (Aaron Yoo) until that relationship also ends in an explosion. Hal’s bullying, thieving older brother (Vincent Piazza) delights in torturing him.  The closest thing to a mentor Hal finds is Ginny’s slick former debate partner, Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas D’Agosto), whose high school stardom ends when he abruptly and mysteriously freezes during a debate. Coached by Ben, who encourages him to sing his debating points (to the tune of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”) instead of speaking them, Hal makes a little progress.  The surest sign of the movie’s integrity is that it resists any temptation to build the story to a climactic debate. “Rocket Science” has more important things to do than to create a false “will he or won’t he succeed under pressure?” moment of truth. Mr. Blitz recognizes that adolescence, for all its agonies, is a phase of growing up, and that Hal, like most teenagers, somehow senses that he is more resilient than he imagines — that adolescence is a purgatory he will survive.  “Rocket Science” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some strong language.

Writer-director Jeffrey Blitz segues effortlessly from nonfiction to fiction -- and from spelling bees to speech tournaments -- in "Rocket Science," a disarmingly quirky follow-up to his Oscar-nominated (and Sundance-rejected) doc "Spellbound." Following a stuttering, insecure youth who joins the debate team after falling hard for a brainy female classmate, this unusually voluble comedy is as eloquent about love, self-realization and adolescent angst as its protagonist is endearingly tongue-tied. There's room for debate, but by playing up the pic's geeky comic sensibility and Blitz's hit pedigree, Picturehouse just might have a winner on its hands.
"Rocket Science" has a few things in common with 1999's "Election," from its purposefully drab visuals to its larger-than-life personalities -- all variations on recognizable high-school types, albeit a hundred times brighter, better-spoken and more interesting. But Blitz's film is ultimately a sweeter, more heartfelt picture. It's more a barbed, coming-of-age tale than satire, and firmly on the side of its lovably awkward hero, Hal Hefner (wonderfully played by Reece Daniel Thompson).
Smartly scripted prologue suggests a metaphysical (or perhaps metalingual) connection between Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas D'Agosto), a brilliant policy debater at New Jersey's Plainsboro High School, and Hal, a quiet teen who, whenever he speaks, does so with a pronounced stutter. During an important debate, Ben suddenly halts midspeech and loses the championship trophy; miles away, Hal watches as his dad (Denis O'Hare) has a nasty altercation with his mom (Lisbeth Bartlett), packs a suitcase and walks out of the house.
Cheekily suggesting the gift of rhetoric can be transferred from one soul to another, the pic proceeds to dig deep inside Hal, exposing the near-daily humiliations that have gutted his self-esteem. His speech impediment makes even a trip through the lunch line difficult, and his older brother Earl (a hilariously macho Vincent Piazza) beats up on him constantly, often by launching "Psycho"-style attacks on Hal in the shower.
Enter Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick), Ben's former debate partner, who's determined not to repeat her disastrous defeat this year. A close cousin of "Election's" Tracy Flick and a better speaker to boot, Ginny is bossy, beautiful and freakishly competitive. She also claims to see something in Hal that others don't, and urges him to join the debate squad under her tutelage. Thoroughly smitten, Hal agrees.
Pic would be worth watching just for its scenes of debaters practicing the art of "spreading" -- a rapid-fire delivery technique that would give the characters in "His Girl Friday" pause, and which D'Agosto and Kendrick have got down cold..
But sharp dialogue and wacky non sequiturs aside, the deep pleasure of "Rocket Science" is the way it resists easy classification. Pic unexpectedly deepens into a poignant and amusing reflection on the universal nature of love, as Hal realizes everyone is getting it on -- from his mom and her new boyfriend (Stephen Park) to a musician couple who play erotic duets down the street.
Yet just when it seems the story is going to settle into a conventional teen romance -- as Hal and Ginny begin making out in earnest and the competition approaches -- Blitz throws in a hairpin twist that forces a drastic reassessment of his intentions. Given its ideas about the importance of defying expectations and taking charge of one's destiny, the comedy's mercurial nature turns out to be entirely appropriate.
If there's a link between "Rocket Science" and "Spellbound," it's Blitz's terrific ability to embrace people's idiosyncrasies, real or fictitious, even as he tweaks them for maximum comic effect. This time, he also brings to the podium a formidable skill with actors. 
In an unusually demanding role for a young thesp, Thompson not only makes an appealingly gawky protag but, crucially, nails the trademark stutter that, no less than the movie itself, is one-of-a-kind. 
Other standouts in the strong ensemble include D'Agosto and especially Kendrick, who bring a fierce, meticulous concentration to bear on their delightfully cocky performances as Type A overachievers.
The dingy, underlit quality of Jo Willems' lensing perfectly complements the mundane New Jersey locations (with some stand-in work from Baltimore). 
Eef Barzelay's impressively multifaceted score incorporates ukulele, tuba, accordion, cello, banjo and kazoo music into a folksy-percussive whole, while the similarly diverse soundtrack makes memorable use of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," among other tunes.

It seems fitting that a movie about debate competition should produce ambivalent feelings. As a master debater says early on in Jeffrey Blitz 's Rocket Science , a strong opinion is a luxury the great ones don't allow themselvesit only gets in the way. What matters is being able to argue either side with equal conviction, based on the evidence.
So: Rocket Science  is yet another Eagle vs. Little Miss Napoleon Dynamite   quirk fest that practically frames its characters in cartoon panels, letting arch oddity trump genuine depth of imagination and empathy. No: Rocket Science  evokes the moment a kid starts to sort out the mixed signals of human complexity. If everything seems weird and goofy, no shitwhen you're 15, clumsy and shy, everything is  weird and goofy: girls, parents, frisky middle-aged chamber-musos whose idea of a musicale is sawing away at the Violent Femmes . . .
What? Keep reading. The evidence supports both takes on Rocket Science , a mix of sleeve-tugging whimsy and keenly recalled misery set against the high-stakes backdrop of the Plainsboro, N.J., public school system. What makes the first fiction feature from documentarian Blitz persuasive is its late-film detour from the inspirational niche-sports genre to something altogether unexpectedand the winning lead performance of Reece Daniel Thompson as Hal Hefner, a bashful teen coaxed into helping his school earn some payback for last year's debate-team fiasco.
Remember? It was the Jersey state finals, and Ben Wekselbaum  (Nicholas D'Agosto ), the Twista  of policy debaters, was busy "spreading" (i.e., speed-freak steamrolling) his opponents with a firehose blast of agricultural rhetoric when suddenly, in mid-spiel, he stopped. Could Ben's godlike argumentative powers and Bone Thugs flow have transferred, through some cosmic punch line, into chronic stutterer Hal, for whom specifying "fish" or "pizza" to the lunch-line lady is a daily ordeal? He's recruited for the team by Ben's still-smarting partner, the preternaturally assured Ginny Ryerson  (Anna Kendrick ), who senses raw talent. "Deformed people are the best," Ginny tells Hal matter-of-factly on the school bus. "Maybe it's because they have a deep resource of anger."
The law of niche-sports comedy (see: Dodgeball Codicil, Section Hot Rod ) says that Hal will tame his stutter, capture Ginny's heart, and make the final round at state. But Ginny is made of sterner stuff, and so is the movie. Rocket Science  is both a companion piece and a rejoinder to Spellbound , Blitz's bright 2002 doc that followed eight teen contenders to the 1999 National Spelling Bee. The risk of public humiliationthe governing terror of adolescencelooms over both films: To be smart and apart from the crowd is scary enough, but to fail is unthinkable. Yet debate has no obvious, according-to-Webster's answer. That's what makes it tantalizing for Hal or any other teenager seeking a voice: the chance to try on points of view in search of one that fits. The funniest scenes involve Hal's hapless attempts to adopt his mentors' advicebewildering opponents with a Peter Sellers  Fu Manchu accent, croaking an opening statement to "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." Because Thompson is an endearingly gangly, gallant presencehe has the wistful look of a hungry pup just inches shy of a steak his mortification is ours.
Rocket Science  lacks Spellbound 's kaleidoscopic richness, its curiosity about the lives of others. While you'd think a former documentary filmmaker couldn't wait to invent all the narrative detail he had to chase in real life, the cutely conceived adults here appear to have been posed just seconds before the camera was switched on: Hal's mom's red-hot lover, a desperate-to-please Korean-American judge (Steve Park ) who's unimaginable on the bench; Ginny's mom, who answers a door as if she'd been standing there hours waiting for her cue. Worse, they evaporate when the camera's switched off. Because movies about smart, studious teens are as rare as concentration-camp comedies, the overenthusiastic are comparing Rocket Science  to Rushmore , but there's not a supporting character here as expansively sketched as Max Fischer 's barber dad, who suggests a life beyond the frame.
In the movie's second half, though, Blitz pulls the first of several surprises that disorient us almost as much as they do Hal. Once Rocket Science  enters the realm of the debate competition, the director's eye for detail never deserts him. As shot by Jo Willems , these scenes evoke the low-stakes/high-drama milieu so astutely that you can almost smell the lemony floor cleaner in those too-white institutional classrooms. In the end, Rocket Science  is less about debate than resolution: The title refers to the mind-boggling complexity of human interaction, of which the hauntingly unresolved ending gives Hal his first inkling. In several scenes, the movie juxtaposes the purity of inarticulate rage (flipping a bird, heaving a cello through a window) with Ginny's glib sophistrya motif with an unfortunate anti-intellectual bent. But in our current landfill of empty, conviction-free punditry, a single middle finger is worth a thousand words.
