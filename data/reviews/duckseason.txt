         Sometimes a film about nothing can be a film about everything; a film without overwhelmingly dramatic events can delight you more than an outsized epic. The sly and disarming "Duck Season" is such a film.
 
  A major success in Mexico, where it won an unprecedented 11 Ariels, the local version of the Oscars, "Duck Season" has traveled exceptionally well. The film has screened in more than 70 festivals, been distributed in more than 30 countries, lighted up Critic's Week at Cannes, won the grand jury prize at AFI Fest and got a best foreign film nomination from the Independent Spirit awards. Better than average for an 85-minute black-and-white film about the laziest of lazy Sundays for two 14-year-old Mexico City boys.
 


         






    "Duck Season" is in fact so whimsical and idiosyncratic, so reluctant to rush its narrative, that viewers will be forgiven for wondering in the early going if this unhurried, seemingly uneventful film is the same one that collected all those honors.
 
  But writer-director Fernando Eimbcke, working on his first feature after a successful series of shorts, absolutely knows what he is doing. As the Sunday in question spirals delicately but unmistakably out of control, Eimbcke's quiet but steely assurance asserts itself and causes all the film's disparate strands to come wonderfully together.
 
  The Sunday in question takes place in the Mexico City apartment of 14-year-old Flama (Daniel Miranda). He and best friend Moko (Diego Cataño), delighted to be left alone by Flama's mother, are preparing for an afternoon of carefully poured king-sized Cokes and Xbox video games.
 
  So intent are they on deciding who should be Bin Laden and who Bush, the boys barely care that Flama's 16-year-old neighbor, the fetching Rita (Danny Perea), is so determined to bake a cake that she has talked Flama into letting her use the family kitchen.
 
  Though she looks angelic, Rita turns out to be a creature without boundaries who is as interested in snooping around and sampling everything as she is in baking, someone who amusingly treats Flama's kitchen as if it were her own. Then the apartment's power goes out and the boys are so bored that, for diversion as much as food, they order a pizza from Telepizza, which guarantees 30-minute delivery.
 
  But when Moko decides that the pizza is 11 seconds late and Flama refuses to pay, wacky deliveryman Ulises (Enrique Arreola) refuses to leave without his money, adding the fourth and final loose cannon to the apartment mix.
 
  The things that happen among these four are in one sense too inconsequential to describe, events that sound uninvolving in words but win us over on screen. Secrets are exchanged, confidences are shared and a painting of ducks on the wing takes on almost mystical significance. Taken together, what we see bonds these people to one another, and to us, changing lives irrevocably in an unassuming if not necessarily quiet way. (We're talking teenage boys here, after all.)
 
  "Duck Season" has a great sense of what it really feels like to be 14, a much different thing than what the movies usually insist it is. In this world of no more than the most nominal adults, this quartet turns itself into an off-the-cuff family, listening intently to one another as they work through questions of sexuality, identity, what to do about bad jobs and impending divorce. What we are watching in "Duck Season," the source of all its success, is something very human, with all the surprise and wonder that that condition implies.   

The tender and droll Mexican charmer Duck Season  captures the stalled rhythms of a lazy Sunday shared by pals, a time of idleness in which pleasure gets tangled with melancholy. Pizza is the sustenance of choice for 14-year-old buddies Flama (Daniel Miranda) and Moko (Diego Cataño), the better to fuel their parent-free afternoon of indolence and Xbox in the unremarkable Mexico City apartment where Flama lives with his mother while his parents fight through a divorce. And before the inconsequential yet unforgettable day turns to night, a prickly pizza delivery guy (Enrique Arreola) and a restless teenage neighbor girl (Danny Perea) join the cocoon.
Sometimes the building's power goes out. Always, the scenes  shot in black and white, with plenty of space for the evocative music of the Mexican power-pop trio Liquits  cut to black, as if to induce a quick catnap. A feature debut for writer-director Fernando Eimbcke, Duck Season  unfolds with a slaphappy logic that only looks casual. In fact, every unfinished conversation and banal picture on the wall (one's of ducks) matters as four little people share one memorable little day.

 One of the beautiful things about the movies is how they can burrow into our beings, turning a public expression into a private ritual. Once, that might have meant strutting across a room like James Cagney or drooping like Ali MacGraw. The charmingly low-key Mexican film "Duck Season" changed the way I pour soda. In this  hymn to friendship, a young teenage boy fills two glasses with Coke for himself and a friend. As the dark, fizzy liquid precariously climbs toward the rim of each glass, the boy gives the signal: "Finger." His friend places a digit above the rim, a gesture that stops the foam from brimming over and yields perfectly equal shares. You can pour a single glass of soda, but how much nicer it is to pour for two.  Sly, droll fun, this unexpectedly fine first feature from Fernando Eimbcke creeps to life slowly with a series of static images — a broken-down bicycle, a graffiti-embellished stretch of concrete — that suggest a postapocalyptic wasteland. Happily, this isn't the setting for some dystopian nightmare, the stomping ground for zombies and thugs, but the exterior courtyard of a vast, anonymous housing complex. Look closer, though, peek inside one of the blank windows that puncture one of the block buildings, and that's where you find the two teenagers, Moko and Flama (nicely played by Diego Cataño and Daniel Miranda). Fourteen years old, the boys are still very much children, with gangling limbs and wide-open eyes, but also on the verge of making a touching swerve into adulthood.  Left home at Flama's with video games and gallons of Coke, the boys begin playtime ordinarily enough. But as late morning gives way to early afternoon and then night, the two are joined first by a next-door neighbor, the lovely Rita (Danny Perea), a somewhat older, much more mature-looking teenager, in search of a working oven. (She wants to bake herself a birthday cake.) Sometime later, a pizza-delivery guy waggishly named Ulises (Enrique Arreola) joins the party, turning three into a neatly symmetrical four. Like the others, Ulises is on a voyage, the implications of which he cannot fully grasp until he (with us riding shotgun) arrives at its end. And so, after some hesitation and pettiness, a little spilled blood and a few badly separated eggs, these four join forces, becoming an island of castaways.  The critic J. Hoberman has pointed out that "Duck Season" is, essentially, a retelling of "The Cat in the Hat," and so it is, though I don't remember the two tots, the goldfish or even that troublemaking feline scarfing down pot brownies. Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll play a part in "Duck Season" and its fab four's magical mystery tour, as do a wealth of detail and a haunting story about a dog pound, a tale told with an agitated camera and accompanied by howls. Shot in black and white in 35-millimeter film, "Duck Season" has a formal elegance that belies its poverty of means. Inside this small canvas — almost the entire film unfolds in the  one apartment — Mr. Eimbcke turns each character into an epic.  Mr. Eimbcke, who also wrote the fine screenplay, throws a precise frame around a world, which emphasizes the sterility of the characters' lives and makes their gradual deliverance from that sterility all the more meaningful. A story about friendship and the ecstasy of communion (not coincidentally, the story opens on a Sunday morning), "Duck Season" suggests that transcendence arrives when you least expect it — sometimes it comes with a pizza, sometimes it materializes in a kitsch painting and, sometimes, in a pan of chocolate-flavored euphoria. More important, transcendence comes in small moments of kindness, in a hand offered with gentleness,  in a kiss delivered without regret. In the end, we are always home alone. But as "Duck Season" reminds us, we don't have to live there forever.  "Duck Season" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Think of it as a PG-13 with pot and no guns.
There's imported-film minimalism, and then there's this: Fernando Eimbcke 's feature debut, Duck Season , a daringly banal comedy of ennui set almost entirely in a middle-class Tlatelolco flat. Knocking them dead at festivals and at the Mexican Ariel Awards, where it enjoyed a Ben Hur like sweep, Eimbcke's movie could become the couch potato nation's anthem film, if only Gen-Xbox  could sit through it. As the title suggests, certainly inadvertently, we're in the land of narrative reductivism, where time is only something to be killed and conversations are as empty as a Bugs-Daffy tit for tat, but without the aptitude for comic attack and with plenty of silent downtime. Wait, as I did, for an "Elmer Season " fillip in vain.
The conscientious depletion of story is both the movie's modus operandi and the probable cause of its refreshed-festgoer hosannas. Two Mexican 'tweens, Moko (Diego Cataño ) and Flama (Daniel Miranda ), see Flama's harried mother off on a Sunday and settle in for a spacious afternoon of Halo and Coke . A 16-year-old neighbor girl named Rita (Danny Perea ) begs to use the apartment's oven. Thumb, thumb, beep, beep, "kill you, asshole," "then kill me, faggot." It's Stranger Than Paradise  for gamersuntil the power goes out. After one of Duck Season 's many slouchy longueurs and a pizza order, the first sign of tension is the delivery guy's race through traffic and hump up the elevator-less building's stairs within his 30-minutes-or-it's-free window. Of course, whether he (Enrique Arreola ) succeeds or not is a matter of dispute, so he loiters, and succumbs, when the power is briefly restored, to the challenge of playing for the money with video soccer.
Jim Jarmusch 's seminal 1984 film had a similar fondness for dead brains going deader on sofa cushions, but Paradise had a formal humor and an existentialist chilliness that filled the movie's empty well like rainwater. Eimbcke's film is a relative bagatelle, hunting for mild hints of comedy and wackiness amid the torpor. Brief moments are gag-scored with quasi-merengue and rock but then abandoned. Rita enlists Moko in her free-form baking debacle, Flama and Ulises the deliveryman squabble, and eventually Eimbcke relents in his dedication to the space's four walls and provides Ulises with fragmented flashbacks to his previous job as a dog pound attendant. A soulful equanimity is found in regards to the pizza payment, and it is revealed that Rita is baking herself a birthday cake because her family forgot. Eimbcke resists the ordinary teen-com reflexes, but then Rita and Moko experiment with French kissing, and Rita's second baking experiment produces pot brownies a natural lubricant the filmmaker wastes on a musical interlude.
Shot in silvery black-and-white, Duck Season  is not charmless, just insubstantial. The smoldering crisis in Flama's homehis parents are waist-deep in a bitter divorcetakes center stage, providing the viewer's famished consciousness with some shreds of narrative red meat, but it's also where the movie becomes sodden and trite. Only Perea's Rita, nursing a hidden psychic bruise and ranting against blonde favoritism, is a robust enough character, and only Perea handles the meaningless moments with complete confidence. But the movie accumulates a sneaky affection anyway; you grow fond of it like you can of a dull tourist spot, or a relative's kitschy home you never wanted to visit but remember warmly now. No 14-year-old I've ever met, however, will opt for it over a good shooter.
