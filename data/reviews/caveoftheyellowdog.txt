 The dog is cute, the children are adorable, and the earth and the sky seem to stretch on without limit in “The Cave of the Yellow Dog.” Unfortunately, so does the slight story, which the writer and director Byambasuren Davaa has pulled and tugged way past its breaking point. Ms. Davaa, who, together with Luigi Falorni, directed the charming narrative documentary “The Story of the Weeping Camel,” has returned to her native Mongolia, this time with far less satisfying results. There are no weeping camels, just bleating goats and mooing cows kept by a family of nomads — played by a real family, the Batchuluuns — whose oldest daughter, a stubborn kewpie named Nansaa, adds a stray to the peripatetic farm.  As in her earlier film, Ms. Davaa follows the rhythms of everyday life on the steppes with love and attention. The children tumble on the grass, the mother makes cheese, the father minds the herds. The children tumble on the grass, the mother cleans the yurt, the father drives off to the city on a sputtering motorcycle. And so it goes.  As Ms. Davaa vainly searches for some kind of dramatic glue to pull these pretty pieces together, a soporific haze settles over the proceedings, punctuated by bursts of beauty, as when Nansaa perches on a high cliff, or when a vulture, wings stretched and toggling from foot to foot, threatens to descend on the family’s youngest child. The dog, a handsome creature with a black face and a circle on its backside, is named Zochor, or Spot.
Director Byambasuren Davaa 's follow-up to The Story of the Weeping Camel  takes a classic tale of girl meets dog and sets it in the filmmaker's native Mongolia , where it becomes an allegory of social change. The stunning, remote valleys where six-year-old Nansaa moves around with her sheep-herding, yurt-dwelling family are increasingly depopulated, as people abandon the nomadic way of life for jobs in the city. "Only stray dogs are left," a roving hunter remarks. Enter Zochor (Mongolian for "Spot"), a wild puppy Nansaa finds in a cave. At times the film's Buddhist lessons feel a bit forced, but the naturalistic performances Davaa has coaxed from a real-life Mongolian family, and her intimate understanding of their culture and values, give this sensitive portrayal its heft.
