Set during the cocaine wars of the late '70s and early '80s, this documentary is out to reveal how Miami vice really worked: less glitz, even crazier piles of cash (the city's swank skyline was just about built on drug money), and far uglier violence. Cocaine Cowboys , which at times seems like it could have been edited by someone on coke, comes at you as a vast bloody river of underworld information, though you may wish you'd gotten to know former trafficker Jon Roberts and former pilot Mickey Munday beyond their bank accounts and apparent obliviousness to danger. The most colorful hard case: Griselda Blanco, a homicidal Colombian ''Godmother'' who, no  lie, makes Tony Montana look like Mother Teresa.

 Overlong, overexcited and over the top, Billy Corben’s bottom-feeding documentary, “Cocaine Cowboys,” would be more enjoyable if it weren’t so impressed with its subject matter and so devoted to pictures of dead bodies. A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970’s and 80’s, the movie overflows with cops and coroners, snitches and smugglers, reporters and importers. Most resemble refugees from “Scarface,” and all talk a mile a minute — except for the dead bodies, of course.  Punctuating interviews with archival film and crime scene photographs (some in merciful black and white), “Cocaine Cowboys” chronicles the explosion of South Florida’s “cocaine economy” and the ensuing turf wars between the Colombians and the Cubans.  Our primary guides are Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, twin pillars of the low-life population, complete with disco hair, criminal records and colorful tales of their exploits with the Medellín cartel. Seeing their remorselessness and raising it is Jorge Ayala, an enforcer whose lengthy jailhouse interview — delivered in English so slurred that he seems to be enunciating through novocaine — is a chilling litany of casual assassinations.  Yet the enterprise that kick-started both Miami’s real estate boom and Don Johnson’s television career was eventually reined in by the city’s expanding law enforcement and the smugglers’ shrinking brain cells. As Jan Hammer’s  appropriately sleazy score twangs in the background, Mr. Corben sifts through the carnage for nuggets of humor to relieve the film’s atmosphere of unrepentant greed.  It’s not enough; “Cocaine Cowboys” is a tabloid headline, a movie as oppressive and inarticulate as the lives it represents.  “Cocaine Cowboys” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has brutal violence, foul language and obscene wads of cash.

Documaker Billy Corben's 2001 Sundance phenom "Raw Deal" unspooled raw tapes that tested the limits of consensual sex. In "Cocaine Cowboys," he revels in endless piles of dope, money and corpses to a "Miami Vice" beat while recounting the heyday of drug traffic in the Florida metropolis. Corben's films are meant to grab the most ADD-afflicted viewer. Jam-packed "Cowboys," featuring colorful drug runners and assassins expansively waxing nostalgic about the glory days, opens today in select cities and should wow on cable. 
Well-structured docu is divided into three distinct sections concerning: the nuts and bolts of the importation and distribution of cocaine; the societal impact of the huge amount of cash flowing through the city; and, the runaway violence of the drug wars.
A rogues gallery of flamboyant gangsters paint an anecdote-rich portrait of the drug trade, while a steady stream of cops, coroners and crime reporters furnish social commentary.
Big-time cocaine dealer Jon Roberts and major transporter Mickey Munday relate their improbable exploits, such as Munday's story of returning from a run with a boatload of coke only to wind up towing a disabled Coast Guard vessel to shore. But their awed reminiscences of walls full of cocaine pale before the sheer volume of money that poured into this once sleepy town of retired geezers, transforming it into a flashy international mecca for fast-living Eurotrash.
Corben's fondness for shots of sacks of cocaine is matched only by his love for shots of stacks of money, but the facts about the influx of cash speak even more loudly than the images: While banks nationwide sent approximately $12 million to the Federal Reserve, the banks in Miami turned over $600 million, the surplus of the Miami Fed greater than all the branches in the U.S. combined.
A new player is added in the last act in the person of Jorge "Rivi" Ayala, the main hit man in the employ of the biggest badass of them all -- Columbian Godmother Griselda Blanco, aka "The Black Widow." Interviewed from prison, where he is serving multiple concurrent life sentences, soft-spoken, rather charming "Rivi" adds a personal insider note to tales of indiscriminate, out-of-control slaughter.
To illustrate the docu, Corben draws from a huge bank of found footage, from 1950s Chamber of Commerce shorts to news clips and police archives, which he supplements with newly-shot reconstructions, both realistic and wildly impressionistic. Taken individually, the sound/image matchups are often ludicrously literal: Roberts mentions arriving in Florida with $650 in his pocket and we cut to a close-up of a hand pulling money from a pocket.
But everything is delivered in such a wash of rapid-fire montage, under a driving score by "Miami Vice" composer Jan Hammer, that the viewer scarcely has time to register the particulars.

Recounting the true events that inspired Miami Vice  and De Palma's Scarface , Billy Corben 's documentary one-ups the recent big-screen Vice  by actually getting the TV show's composer, Jan Hammer , to do his soundtracksee, Michael Mann , that shouldn't have been so hard! Corben's so intent on getting the whole story that he devotes perhaps a bit too much time to the early traffickers, who ferried bricks of cocaine from Colombia  on small private planes. But about halfway through the movie, the focus shifts to a convicted killer named Rivi, who began as a small-time car thief and eventually found himself in the employ of "Godmother" Griselda Blanco , a fascinating and temperamental character whose mercurial moods jacked up the violence levels in Miami during the '80s. Much of the archival footage is from old TV news, and the transfer to the big screen does the image quality no favors, but the story is fascinating, if a little overlong, and makes you want to see a high-profile, big-name Griselda Blanco movie happen, like, tomorrow.
