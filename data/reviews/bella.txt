Bella
 is, indeed, a beautiful film. The bustling, cab-crowded thoroughfares of New York City have rarely looked as inviting and the coastline as momentously beachy as they do in this film. Monteverde's film was shot by cinematographer Andrew Cadelago (both men are University of Texas graduates) with an unusual attention to detail for what is essentially a character study of two people. This only adds to the nuance and sense of grace inherent in Ver�stegui's and Blanchard's performances, both of which are models of emotional restraint and resonance. Forget Uta Hagen for a moment, and watch these two actors give pitch-perfect performances in what could have been a soppy, overwrought melodrama. They aren't just in
 the moment; they are
 the moment. Jose (Ver�stegui of Chasing Papi
 and many a Mexican TV soap) is the chef and Nina (Blanchard) a waitress at the Cuban bistro owned by Jose's brother Manny (Perez). When Nina shows up late for work two days in a row, Manny fires her, and Jose exits as well. Nina's just discovered she's pregnant, and Jose, who arrives onscreen with a mysterious past and haunted eyes, chooses to spend the day roaming around New York before taking Nina, who plans to abort the fetus, to his family's beachfront home on the coast. We learn in the film's many capsule flashbacks that five years ago Jose was a famous soccer star on the verge of signing a major sports deal, and we know immediately, from the way he sits on the beach, his long hair and bushy beard tousled by the sea breeze, that this is a film about redemption and grace. There's been some hue and cry about the film's subject matter (i.e., will she or won't she?) from people with too much free time on their hands, but the only thing that should be inflamed by this gentle, graceful film is your heart. Although the question of termination hangs heavy over Bella
 � both Nina and Jose lose their jobs, Nina has money problems, and the portentous flashbacks surely bode ill for someone as yet unknown � this is a film that embraces and celebrates the possibility for change and growth, both without and within, both personal and spiritual. Ver�stegui and Blanchard's platonic chemistry is undeniable (although Perez seems to be riffing on John Leguizamo for some reason), and alongside Monteverde's unobtrusive direction it makes Bella
 into something far more interesting and affecting than the mediocre telenovela it could have been. The film won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival in 2006.

 It is not hard to see why “Bella,” a saccharine trifle directed by Alejandro Monteverde, won the People’s Choice Award at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. This is a movie that wears its bleeding heart on its sleeve and loves its characters to distraction. Nothing — not even significant plot glitches and inconsistencies — is allowed to get in the way of its bear-hugging embrace of sweetness and light.  The protagonist, José (the Mexican actor Eduardo Verástegui), is a selfless angel with big blue eyes and a gaping emotional wound who works as a chef in his brother Manny’s Mexican restaurant in New York City. When Manny fires Nina (Tammy Blanchard), a waitress, for being late, José quits in solidarity and becomes her rescuer. After she confesses that she is pregnant and planning an abortion, he decides  to talk her out of it, helps her find a new job and takes her home to his warm-hearted Latino family on Long Island.  Although José is an unattached dreamboat, there isn’t the slightest suggestion of romance between him and Nina. All we know of José is that a tragic accident several years earlier derailed his brilliant soccer career just as he was about to sign a $2 million contract. When the incident is finally shown (at the movie’s halfway point), it is milked for every last teardrop, and José’s good deeds can be seen as acts of atonement.  If “Bella” (the title doesn’t make sense until the last scene) is a mediocre cup of mush, the response to it suggests how desperate some people are for an urban fairy tale with a happy ending, no matter how ludicrous.  “Bella” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for thematic elements and brief disturbing images.

So slight that a gentle breeze might tip it over, "Bella" is a film about selfless love that wants to be loved too much. Manipulative pic trades in fairy-tale views of New York life alongside briefly sustained emotional confessions, which may partly explain its victory as Toronto fest's aud winner. Mexican-born helmer Alejandro Monteverde's debut will be remembered as a curious case of a mediocre film that wows crowds; still, domestic distrib still isn't set four months after preem, portending that best prospects may remain in vid and cable.
Former soccer pro Jose (Mexican pop and telenovela star Eduardo Verastegui) is lead chef at a fine Manhattan-based Mexican restaurant owned and operated by his brother Manny (Manny Perez). Intolerant of sloppy behavior or tardiness, Manny fires server Nina (Tammy Blanchard) when she shows up late, unaware that she's just learned that she's pregnant.
Nina, however, could easily have been to work on time, since her delay was due to her buying and using a homepregnancy test -- something she rationally would have done after her shift was over. Though it would be easy to conclude that her character sabotages her own best prospects in life, such an intriguing wrinkle is never even contemplated in Monteverde and Patrick Million's cut-and-dried script.
Similarly burdened with half-developed motivations, Jose impulsively ups and leaves his post just as the restaurant is about to open its doors for lunch and accompanies Nina around the city for the rest of the day, despite the fact that he barely knows her and the entire kitchen operation depends on him. 
With its storyline based on such inexplicable behavior, "Bella" is seriously behind the dramatic eight ball, and trusts that the effective chemistry between the two leads will help auds ignore the many narrative potholes. One doesn't object to Verastegui's habit of directing puppy-dog looks Blanchard's way -- a clear attempt on the heartthrob's part to soften his sexy image, furthered by wearing a large beard that gives him an odd Jesus-like visage. (Jose's unshaven face is seen in flashbacks to five years earlier, when his troubles began.)
Jose and Nina spend the day visiting his loving parents (the fine Angelica Aragon and Jaime Terelli) --a model of middle-class Mexican familial harmony that emotionally touches Nina, who has no family herself -- and delivering monologues to each other about their pasts. Jose's speech ushers in the film's major set piece, a tragic mishap followed by several needlessly time-bending montages -- in which Jose convinces Nina to keep the child and allow him to raise it -- and a strangely elliptical ending.
The warm stars can do only so much to humanize a mucky narrative that unavoidably lessens the film's emotional thrust. Perfs are suited to Monteverde's staging and Andrew Cadelago's bland lensing, both tuned to a television-like aesthetic. Editing by Fernando Villena stutters where it should flow, and is occasionally gripped by hysterical bursts of cross-cutting.

Bella , the People's Choice Award  winner at last year's Toronto International Film Festival , is already getting some buzz among Catholics and pro-lifers in the blogosphere, who've pinned it as the crossover anti-abortion hit they've been waiting for. Sorry to break it to you guys, but . . . no. Director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde  has so little control of tone or nuance that even the most tragic and serious moments here come off as melodramatic jokes. (During the screening I attended, nearly the entire theater burst out laughing at the violent death of a child.) His main character, Jose (Eduardo Verástegui ), a Jesus-haired hottie with sad eyes and a sad secret weighing on his mind, works as a (preternaturally talented yet modest) chef in his brother's New York restaurant. When a co-worker, the streetwise Nina (Tammy Blanchard ), is fired for her chronic lateness (guess what: she's actually pregnant), Jose takes her out for a day at the beach and tries to dissuade her from getting an abortion. Does she? If you can't tell by now how this movie ends, I won't spoil it, except to say that it manages to be utterly predictable without making any sense at all.
