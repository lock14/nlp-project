Canadian animation studio Snoot Entertainment goes up against the big boys in this futuristic, CG-animated tale of a peace-loving, pseudo-religious race of tadpole-esque creatures known as the Terrians, who face imminent extinction at the hands of murderous aliens from beyond the stars: mankind. Taking a page from Battlestar Galactica
 (the original series) and putting a nifty spin on such peaceable Fifties sci-fi classics as The Day the Earth Stood Still
 (again, the original), Battle for Terra
 boasts impressively executed battle sequences that, frankly, are light-years beyond anything found in the recent Star Wars
 animated add-ons. There's none of the nattering subplot exposition that marred The Clone Wars
, and in fact, Battle for Terra
 has more in common � philosophically, at least � with the Brad Bird-directed, Tim McCanlies-scripted The Iron Giant
 than it does with anything coming out of Skywalker Ranch these days. Battle for Terra
�s protagonist is high-spirited tomboy (tadboy?) Mala (Wood), who, in the wake of a violent attack on her people from a �new God in the sky," rescues wounded enemy pilot Jim (Wilson). Through Cross' multilingual robot, Giddy, Mala learns that Jim and his mother ship (commanded with militaristic gusto by Cox's Gen. Hemmer) are all that remain of the human race, the planet Earth having long ago exhausted its life-sustaining resources. While the Terrian elders mount a countercampaign against the backdrop of a truly unconscionable plan by Gen. Hemmer to "terraform" the planet (and thus kill off all
 life on it), Jim and Mala work together to save both Terrians and humankind alike. Director Tsirbas, a former digital artist on such films as Hellboy
 and Kevin Smith's Dogma
, works wonders on a budget that was probably equal to one day�s rendering costs on the last Disney/Pixar production, and his script, co-written with Evan Spiliotopoulos, knowingly touches on some thoroughly contemporary issues � not least among them unchecked militarism, the dangers of conformity (and religion), and the moral imperative and compassion all freethinking life forms should exhibit toward one another, regardless of whether they look like googly-eyed airborne spermatozoa or not.

Message: We are a friendly film entity. We mean you no harm. We seek 85 minutes to entertain you and your offspring with our animated offering.
Yes, "Battle for Terra" is a clash-of-civilizations construct  - peace-loving creatures versus warlike ones  - and yes, it ends in a climactic battle. (In-joke: The invaders aren't tentacle-waving mutants, but desperate humans seeking a new home because they trashed Planet Earth. Ha Ha.)
But when a human pilot (voice of Luke Wilson) crashes on placid Terra and is befriended by alien teen Mala (Evan Rachel Wood), is it not logical they would team up to find a way for the two races to coexist?
If you find the plot predictable, as a distraction we present an arsenal of 3-D visuals. For the Terrians, we crossed tadpoles with E.T.
 and stuck them on an earth-toned world of floating mushroom-shaped high-rises. You can tell the militaristic humans are bad because their spaceships are metal and glow neon, whereas Terrians fly low-tech, bird-shaped aircraft made of cloth and love.
The robotic Giddy (David Cross) provides comic relief. OK, it's a WALL-E/C-3PO rip-off. OK, more than a few shades of "Star Wars" color our joyous cartoon. The humans pilot TIE Fighter shoo-ins, and the mother-ship interiors are based on Death Star schematics. Mark Hamill has a walk-on voice gig as one of the fish-faced elders.
But our plot twist (Terrians not who they seem?) will please you. We also spare you from musical numbers.
Please, moviegoers, time is running out for us. Our civilization (and bottom line) depend on fast-food kiddie meals stuffed with toys. In this way, we conquer the solar system.
Our plea: Send us your offspring.

 If you’re making an animated movie about another planet and go to the trouble of doing it in 3-D, shouldn’t you give your extraterrestrial inhabitants an interesting, complex appearance? The beings of Terra, the planet in peril in the 3-D “Battle for Terra,” look a bit like flying spermatozoa. They’re supposed to be lovable — Terra has mastered the art of peaceful, prosperous existence, you see — but in truth they’re kind of creepy.  Anyway, their squiggly paradise is disrupted by the arrival of brutish humans, who are looking for a new home after having destroyed their own through a combination of environmental abuse and war. The human military commander (voice of Brian Cox) is eager to just blast the locals to bits and take over Terra, but one of his fighter pilots (Luke Wilson) starts thinking differently after he crash-lands and is rescued by a girl-squiggle named Mala (Evan Rachel Wood).  The movie’s messages are delivered with a heavy hand, but some of the scenes are eye-popping, especially — sorry, peace-loving Terrians — the battle sequences. The starry voice cast also includes Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover and James Garner.  “Battle for Terra” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) because war, 3-D or otherwise, is a violent business.

Considering they're basically noseless tadpoles, the inhabitants of "Battle for Terra's" title planet are an endearing group, and their world is the fully realized offspring of dreamy imagination and CGI. U.S. production is as original and convincing a feature as the better Japanese animes of recent years --"Tekkonkinkreet" comes to mind, along with the slightly older "Metropolis." While too violent for the youngest kids, the sci-fi invasion story, high-tech wizardry and high-profile vocal cast could make for substantial mainstream traffic. Adoration by animation acolytes? Affirmative.
Helmer Aristomenis Tsirbas and scribe Evan Spiliotopoulos have created a galactic utopia, but not one without costs: Freethinkers like Mala (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) are an endangered species. The planet -- around which the tail-heavy Terrareans motor as if underwater -- is ruled by mullahs who enforce fundamentalist policies regarding behavior and belief.
As a result, the population has become a bit infantilized; when invading Earthling forces are spotted entering Terra's atmosphere, the fliers are assumed by some to be approaching gods. What the Earthlings want -- having used up three planets already -- is Terra itself.
Combining elements of "Planet of the Apes" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "Battle for Terra" is also part inter-species "Romeo and Juliet." Mala, whose father is abducted by aliens (humans!), saves and protects crash-landed pilot Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson), hoping he'll take her to her father and secure his release. Thus allied, Mala and Jim must hide from both the Terrareans and the Earthlings, who plan to convert the Terra atmosphere into one inhabitable for humans but poisonous for Mala and her people.
What helps make "Battle for Terra" a good ride is that Tsribas and Spiliotopoulos have addressed many of the implausibilities such a story naturally comes saddled with, such as the language barrier, which is corrected by the R2-D2-inspired Giddy (David Cross), a combination robot/Berlitz course.
"Battle for Terra" isn't sugar-coated -- the humans are hardly paragons of virtue, but neither are the Terrareans. And the story's resolution won't make it the feel-good cartoon of 2008, although it is a work of art.
Tech credits are superb, including the sound, which is used in such a precise way as to give palpable weight and substance to Tsirbas' amazing architectural creations.

A spiritual sequel to the equally hapless Delgo —which sold pacifism in animated form to an empty theater—Battle for Terra  pits alien creatures against invading Earthlings in a detail-poor CGI landscape. Terra , to be fair, looks fairly clean, and the 3-D is totally passable, but watching it will be no fun for either kids or adults. The creatures of Terra  resemble nothing so much as myopic earthworms, the backs of their heads ripped off from The Fifth Element 's alien opera singer. Into their drab, hippie-esque world enters a fleet of invading humans—having destroyed Earth, Mars, and  Venus, they need a new pad. Inevitably, the human military wants to wipe the natives out and colonize, while dissenting voices call for peaceful interaction. It's up to young alien Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) to bond with downed soldier Jim (Luke Wilson) and convince him that her species has value, etc. Battle for Terra  harps on pacifism so tirelessly that it's enough to make the most die-hard U.N. supporter long for some irresponsible asskicking. And the alien dialogue ("Inventions that are against our teachings are not approved." "Then maybe our teachings are wrong!") makes a good case for wiping the suckers out.
