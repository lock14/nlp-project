Based on Mark Jacobson's New York
 magazine article, American Gangster
 does a crackerjack job at nailing the look and feel of New York City's bad old days, when mayors Lindsay and Beame (mis)ruled over the Manhattan canyons and Bronx tenements aided and abetted by a police department riddled with more internal corruption and outer rot than a smack-head's corpse. Every day was a dog-day afternoon, and Serpicos were in short supply. Hell may have come to Harlem and dressed to the nines � in the form of the much-admired, longtime crime boss Bumpy Johnson, here played to the essential hilt by a terrific Williams III � but at the height of the Vietnam War, it was the late Johnson's driver and confidante, Frank Lucas (a sizzling, ferocious Washington), who figured out a whole new angle. He took over Harlem's heroin trade, which was exploding thanks to the many GIs who returned home with a habit picked up in Southeast Asia, and undercut the mob by first brokering a deal with the Thai manufacturers and then shipping the 100%-pure skag back stateside in the coffins of American servicemen. Conservatively attired, Lucas flew, with murderous aplomb, under the radar of those cops not already on the take. He moved nearly half his family up from the Carolinas to serve as his crew and bought his mother (the captivating Dee) a mansion fit for a kingpin's mom. Only when a sudden fit of pimpy ostentation hit during the Ali-Frazier boot at the Garden (his wife bought him an ermine coat-and-hat ensemble) did he come to the attention of Jersey cop Richie Roberts (Crowe, sporting Dustin Hoffman's Seventies-era hair and Star of David). Roberts is uniformly loathed and scorned by the NYPD's dirty cops (led by a great Brolin), who view him as a stooge and a dupe for not going with the bribery flow. (The film's running gag is that Roberts was clean enough to actually turn in a million bucks in unmarked bills that he found in a suspect's car.) Like Eliot Ness before him, Roberts is tagged by the feds to create his own Untouchables and weed out the source of the increasingly fatal Blue Magic distribution network. Crowe has rarely been better, and the same goes for director Scott, who parallels and then dovetails Lucas' and Roberts' stories with sublime, gritty precision, working up to a magnificent Godfather: Part III
-style crosscutting sequence that electrifies an already explosive tale. Like Joe Friday said, the story is true, but only a few names have been changed, because in this
 NYC, hardly anybody was innocent.


"American Gangster," you'll notice, is not called "American Gangsta." The director Ridley Scott and the screenwriter Steve Zaillian take us back to an era when a drug lord had some class. His jeans did not sag, because he didn't wear jeans. He did, however, wear chinchilla, lots of it. And as a show of community spirit, he gave back to the people. In this movie, we know this to be true since we see Denzel Washington throwing Thanksgiving turkeys from a big truck to the outstretched arms of Harlem masses. And what you think is, "Gosh, I hope nobody gets hurt."
But the man Washington plays, Frank Lucas, doesn't want to hurt anybody - unless he's just set you on fire then shot you or has bashed your head into a piano. Or unless he or his associates have sold you heroin. Right. How could I forget that?
Well, "American Gangster" isn't about heroin. It's about business, and the movie wants to make a case for Lucas, the real-life kingpin, as a risk-taking businessman. Maybe "American Entrepreneur" sounded too much like something on CNBC. But Scott and Zaillian, who adapted the movie from Mark Jacobson's New York magazine article about Lucas's rise and fall, mix boilerplate crime-epic frills with pointed observations about a black male rising to the top of a vast industry dominated by Italians. The result is kitschy entertainment that wants to celebrate Lucas's chutzpah and acumen while loosely condemning what they wrought: "Scarface" with a ghost of a conscience.
To drive home the legal angle, Russell Crowe lives in the movie's other half, using an unforgivable Noo Joysie accent. He plays Richie Roberts, a New Jersey cop and aspiring prosecutor promoted to head the federal narcotics squad that's trying to shut Lucas down. Roberts is upstanding at work (he turns in the million or so dollars he finds in a car trunk) and a mess at home; he's in the middle of a custody battle.
Lucas, meanwhile, came up through the Harlem underworld as the driver and collector for Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III), the dapper crook who tried to keep the mob out of the neighborhood numbers racket. (Laurence Fishburne played Johnson in a 1997 shoot-'em-up about his life called "Hoodlum.")
By the early 1970s, Lucas takes Johnson's pride-of-ownership mantle and expands it. He cuts out the middleman in drug dealership, importing thousands of kilos of pure heroin from Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, via the body bags of US soldiers. Twice the quality for half the price, Lucas says of his Blue Magic powder. The movie has him and his soldier contact (Roger Guenveur Smith) sailing down a jungle river to a poppy field "Apocalypse Now"-style.
Business booms. To underscore just how booming it is, Scott gives us a montage of people shooting up and junkies walking down the streets scratching their arms, while Lucas monitors sales from his car. Right away, he moves his family from North Carolina to his deluxe mansion on a hill (Ruby Dee plays Mama Lucas). He marries Miss Puerto Rico (Lymari Nadal) and puts his five brothers to work; two of them are played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and the rapper Common (in a nifty bit of casting, another, dissimilar rapper, T.I., plays 
Common's son). When Lucas isn't sporting a tweed jacket to negotiate with the be-tweeded Mafioso (Armand Assante) miffed with Lucas's marketplace success, he's trying to avoid sharing his fortune with the NYPD, represented here by a scary moustache that's wearing Josh Brolin.
The contrasting irony between Lucas and Roberts is meant to have a neon glow: We can't miss their differences. The criminal, for instance, is the better family man. The movie jumps back and forth between its two halves until, of course, they meet in rather shameless fashion.
Some of Lucas's grandiosity verges on camp. But Denzel Washington couldn't do camp if John Waters assembled the tent for him. So when Lucas curses out a servant for wiping a bloodstain from his $25,000 alpaca rug when he should be blotting it out, you laugh both because that kind of flamboyance is ridiculous and because Washington doesn't find it funny (which almost makes it campy anyway).
The entire movie is caught between being a work of seriousness and a work of absurdity. And when Joe Morton shows up with a blond moustache and what looks like a dead beaver on his head and Cuba Gooding Jr. jives it up as a flashy rival of Lucas's, it's absurdity you want. Camp might have been too extreme a tone. But gentler, riskier hands could have fashioned a kind of social comedy from a movie about the black guy who shook up the drug world. You'd need real characters, though,
 to bring out the truth in the comedy, and they aren't here. Like Gooding, Ejiofor goes for something appreciably funny, but the movie isn't interested in that. They're playing screw-ups.
Besides, Scott, Zaillian, and producer Brian Grazer seem to think they're really showing us something surprising. But this is "New Jack City" with Oscar winners. (Incredibly, the movie ends the year "New Jack City" came out, creating a kind of reverse drug-flick continuum.) The central idea of "American Gangster" - and it's not a bad one - is that, on the one hand, Lucas is like John H. Johnson, the creator of Ebony, or Nike's
 Phil Knight. He's both a black entrepreneur who understands his niche market and just a plain-old good businessman who knew how to move a product. He didn't invent heroin. He made it extremely profitable.
The moral part of those analogies seems beside the point. The movie has Lucas argue that Bumpy Johnson was as important as Martin Luther King, a jaw-dropping line of thought that might require some follow up. The movie suggests, by the logic of its premise, that the thousands of Harlemites hooked on Blue Magic were better off because the man pushing it was black and not Italian. Lucas seems to have been mistaken for some kind of freedom fighter.
No matter how many shots Scott gives us of babies crying over half-dead junkie mothers, "American Gangster" is scarcely convincing as social-problem filmmaking. It's a cautionary tale with a broken yellow light. The movie prefers the high of big business. When the title cards tell us at the end that Lucas served an abbreviated 15-year sentence for cooperating with Roberts, the audience cheers. Scott, like Lucas, appears to know his customer. We ride the ups and downs of a rise-and-fall drug-lord tale like a roller coaster. There's nothing fun about those 15 years and the ones that follow.


         IT takes nerve to call a film "American Gangster": It's more than a movie title, it's the name of a venerable genre that dates to cinema's beginnings. But once you see this finely made and richly satisfying film, you understand it's the only title possible.
 
 In part that's because "American Gangster" is conscious of its place in that tough guy continuum. Visual and thematic references to classics such as "The Godfather," "Once Upon a Time in America" and "The Asphalt Jungle" show that director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Steven Zaillian are quite aware of their film's place in history.
 


         






   More than that, with Oscar-winning costars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe joining forces with Scott and Zaillian, two of the best at what they do, "American Gangster" is mindful of continuing another tradition, that of sweeping, old-school epic filmmaking that artfully heightens reality even if it's based on the gritty facts of the Harlem drug trade of the 1970s.
 
 Making this point even stronger is the presence of a pair of documentaries that cover roughly the same territory as "American Gangster." Frank Lucas, the drug lord Denzel Washington plays, is profiled in a BET Networks hour, while Nicky Barnes, Lucas' rival, gets a documentary of his own called "Mr. Untouchable."
 
 But it is a tribute to the complexity and drama of Zaillian's character-driven script and to Scott's commanding grasp of large-scale visuals and sweeping storytelling that the truth is puny and uninvolving compared with the bravura moviemaking webs these men can weave. Scott is the third director (after Antoine Fuqua and Terry George) who signed on for this project, and he brings to it cinematic gifts no one else has.
 
 It is Zaillian and Scott's notion that the gangster story is another version of the classic American success story, a theme that echoes "Asphalt Jungle's" famous description of crime as "a left-handed form of human endeavor." In the same way, the entrepreneurial Harlem drug dealers who wreak havoc in the streets took as gospel the line that starts "The Godfather:" "I believe in America."
 
 "American Gangster's" two adversaries, drug kingpin Lucas (Washington) and Richie Roberts, the cop who becomes his "Les Misérables"-type nemesis (Crowe), can also be seen as two sides of the same scary coin, each of them fearless and driven by interior forces that make them terrors to be around.
 
 Yet, unexpectedly, "American Gangster" has not only kept the face-to-face meetings between these two men to a minimum, it has also relegated them to the last hour of this 2-hour-and-40-minute film. In fact, Zaillian told Script magazine that he ended up "writing two separate scripts," one from Lucas' point of view, the other from Roberts', and then combining them to compelling effect.
 
 As the title indicates, this is Lucas' story more than anyone else's, and it is no disrespect to the charismatic, magnetic work Crowe does to say that Washington's is the performance to savor here. The actor is always at his best, as he was in his Oscar-winning "Training Day," as the magnetic bad guy, the man with a malleable code who can say things like "If you weren't my brother I'd blow your brains out" and make you believe it.
 
 Certainly the first glimpse we have of Lucas, being the good gangland soldier and unemotionally setting someone on fire, leaves us with few illusions about the man who was for 15 years the factotum to Harlem crime czar Bumpy Johnson. Yet Washington's performance makes it possible for us to see nuances in the man's character without shortchanging the malevolence of his actions, makes us see how in his own mind Lucas was a believer in family, integrity and character.
 
 Washington is also expert at conveying the watchful waiting in Lucas, the man who took his time after Bumpy Johnson's death in 1968 to understand the power structure in criminal Harlem and figure out how to work the area's heroin traffic to his advantage. Bumpy, he notes, was rich, but "he wasn't white-man wealthy," and this becomes Lucas' goal.
 
 To achieve this, as related in the Mark Jacobson article in New York magazine that started the project, Lucas went to Thailand and made his own deals with growers for the purest dope, which he called Blue Magic and had shipped back to the U.S. in the coffins of Americans who died fighting in Vietnam. A left-handed form of human endeavor indeed.
 
 Back in America, Lucas cuts deals with the Mafia and bumptious Harlem rival Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr.), brings his brothers (including Chiwetel Ejiofor's Huey) up from North Carolina to help him run the business and acquires a stunning Miss Puerto Rico (Lymari Nadal) as a girlfriend. "I sell product better than the competition at prices lower than the competition," Lucas boasts. "I am my own company."
 
 Smoothly intercut by editor Pietro Scalia with these events is the story of Crowe's Richie Roberts, a tough Jewish cop at home with both a swagger and a sledgehammer. Possessed of a volcanic temper and a disinclination to wait for warrants if there's crime fighting to be done, the fearless, streetwise Roberts, like Lucas, has his own stern code of behavior.
 
 So when he comes across a huge cache of money he could have walked off with, no questions asked, Roberts instead turns it in, and, like Frank Serpico before him, earns the enmity of those of his co-workers who are deeply suspicious of honest cops.
 
 Being Richie also means royally irritating his wife, Laurie (Carla Gugino, far from "Spy Kids"), and getting into conflicts with connected crooked cops like Det. Trupo (the protean Josh Brolin). His worth is finally recognized, however, as part of a special antidrug task force, and the stage is set for his epochal face-off with Lucas.
 
 Watching "American Gangster" in tandem with those Harlem drug documentaries underlines that this impressive film is less based on actual fact than on movie fiction.
 
 Authorities and eyewitnesses may argue about who did what to whom in real life, but where the big screen is concerned, it matters not. What "American Gangster" is doing is re-creating myths, and it's good to see that the movies haven't lost their touch where that kind of work is concerned.
 

 
 "American Gangster:" MPAA rating: R for violence, pervasive drug content and language, nudity and sexuality. Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes. In general release.
   

As Frank Lucas, the brutal Harlem drug lord of American Gangster , Denzel Washington has a gaze as steady as a statue's, and he wanders through the vibrantly messy, pre-Giuliani-time streets in an overcoat that accentuates his wide shoulders and coiled, urban-king swagger. There's no doubt that Frank communicates strength  in fact, he communicates little else. Washington might be playing a senator, or Malcolm X all over again; his performance is smooth, confident, and more than a little familiar. Even as a gangster, he doesn't transform   he doesn't release his inner thug. He's still every inch Denzel, all dour nobility.
Directed by Ridley Scott, and adapted by screenwriter Steven Zaillian from a New York  magazine story entitled ''The Return of Superfly,'' American Gangster  is meticulous and detailed, a drug-world epic that holds you from moment to moment, immersing you in the intricate and sleazy logistics of crime. Yet the movie isn't quite enthralling; it's more like the ghost version of a '70s classic. Scott nails the grit and clutter of the era  the bombed-out buildings, the litter and the rusty pay phones  and he structures the film almost pointillistically, with brief, heightened, coruscating scenes that flow into each other. American Gangster  unfolds on parallel tracks, cutting back and forth between Frank Lucas' reign and the stubborn quest of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a terse and scruffy last-honest-narcotics-cop-in-New York, to hunt him down. It's like The Godfather , Serpico , Scarface , and The French Connection  all mashed in a blender, along with a heavy helping of synthetic cocktail mix.
Lucas aspires to be a new kind of inner-city criminal. He's a drug dealer who thinks like a CEO, without the plumage of previous black gangsters. His innovation, which puts him a step ahead of the Italian Mob, is to realize that with the Vietnam War raging, he can purchase uncut heroin directly from the Southeast Asian kingpins who supply it to American soldiers. Using his connections, he journeys upriver, like a grunt in Apocalypse Now , to the jungles of Thailand and buys 100 kilos. He then cuts the U.S. military into the deal by having the drugs shipped back on Army planes. Now that's  thinking outside the box.
Frank's product, marketed as ''Blue Magic,'' is purer than any other dealer's, and he sells it for less. American Gangster  tells the story of a singular underworld mind, yet Frank, as a character, isn't fascinating, exactly. He's an icon who hasn't been completely filled in. Every half hour or so, starting with the opening scene, he commits some hideous cold-blooded execution meant to demonstrate he's got more stones than anyone else. His fury, though, is tidy and compartmentalized. Even for a stealth corporate gangster, he doesn't show a glimmer of it the rest of the time. You never feel  like you did when James Cagney shoved that grapefruit in his girlfriend's face in The Public Enemy , or when Tony Montana unleashed his mad-dog machine-gun rage in Scarface   that Frank is a gangster because he lives and breathes violence.
Washington's performance lacks idiosyncrasy, and it also lacks a whisper of the streets, though that, at least, is by design. When Frank's Puerto Rican beauty-queen wife (Lymari Nadal) gives him a striped fur coat, he wears it to the 1973 Ali-Frazier fight, and that's the tip-off to Detective Roberts that there's a new player in town. Frank gets caught out the one night he dresses like a pimp. There's an irony to that fact the film should have made more of. What works, terrifically, is Roberts' fixation on Frank. Crowe plays him with a thick, hunched body and a squint of a scowl. He's a caveman lug who has burned his life down to an ashy nub of integrity. Catching criminals is all he has; he's every bit as obsessed with nailing dirty cops, like the shakedown bully Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Still, it takes a special doggedness to trap Lucas, since Frank's secret weapon  the real way he sneaks drugs into the country, not revealed until late in the film  has a ghastly ingenuity.
Frank builds his empire with family, uprooting brothers, cousins, and his dear old mother (Ruby Dee) from North Carolina and moving them to a mansion that looks like the Tara of Westchester. Yet we barely get to know the brothers, even as they run Frank's operation. (The great Chiwetel Ejiofor is wasted.) American Gangster  is never dull, but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue. The last section, in which Lucas and Roberts finally connect, is almost weirdly upbeat. Many movie gangsters have, of course, become role models, but this film might have been more convincing if it didn't set out to create one.

 Greatness hovers just outside “American Gangster,” knocking, angling to be let in. Based in rough outline on the flashy rise and fall of a powerful 1970s New York drug lord, Frank Lucas, the film has been built for importance, with a brand-name director, Ridley Scott, and two major stars, Denzel Washington as Lucas, and Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, the New Jersey cop who brings him down. It’s a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red.  This being an American story, as its title announces and Steven Zaillian’s screenplay occasionally trumpets, there’s plenty of blue in the mix too, worn by some of New York’s very un-finest. Mr. Lucas was among the city’s most notorious underworld hustlers, but one of the film’s points (at times you could call it a message) is that he was just doing what everyone with ambition, flair and old-fashioned American entrepreneurial spirit was doing, including cops: getting a piece of the action. His piece just happened to be bigger than most, stretching across Harlem and snaking into other neighborhoods, into alleys and apartments where someone with ready cash and a hungry vein was always aching to get high.  You see a few of those veins, popping, all but jumping in anticipation of another hit. Sometimes the needle slides into a clean arm, though every so often the camera comes uncomfortably close as a spike jabs into a suppurating wound. You could call these images metaphoric, something about the oozing, bleeding body of the exploited underclass, but mostly they’re just graphic evidence of the damage done. Despite the intermittent nod to someone nodding out and even dying, this isn’t about the suffering of addicts or of those forced to watch their neighborhoods perish alongside them. It’s about good guys and bad, a classic story of white hats and black squaring off at the corral at 116th Street and Eighth Avenue.  Mr. Crowe, his jaw thrust forward as aggressively as his pelvis, wears the white hat, while the silky, smooth-moving, smooth-talking Mr. Washington wears the black. They’re irresistible, though neither possesses the movie because each occupies a separate if parallel story line. Mr. Washington has the more developed and dynamic role, which he inhabits easily, whether flashing his wolfish grin or draining the affect from Lucas’s face to show the soulless operator beneath the swagger and suit. Lucas’s rival, Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a sharp, small turn), wore the pimp threads and fedoras the size of manhole covers (he also read Machiavelli). Lucas dressed like the businessman he believed himself to be and was.  Formally, the plot takes the shape of a simple braid, with Lucas’s and Roberts’s stories serving as individual narrative strands that become more and more tightly plaited. Complicating this simple, at times overly mechanical back-and-forth design is a third player with a smaller strand, a corrupt New York detective, Trupo (Josh Brolin in a knockout performance), who shakes down Lucas and other larcenous types. The baddest bad man in town, a thug’s thug, Trupo wears his power as confidently as the long black leather coat he whips on for battle. He hassles Lucas, who hates him in turn, and openly indulges his contempt for Roberts because the other cop is honest, which means he’s a threat to Trupo and his kind.  It’s hard not to fall for these men pumping like pistons across the screen, which is as much part of the movie’s allure as its problem. Mr. Scott doesn’t escape the contradiction that bedevils almost every Hollywood movie about gangsters, which cry shame, shame, as they parade their stars, crank the soul and showcase the foxy ladies, the swank digs and rides. Mr. Washington obviously enjoys sinking into villainy, but he never finds the lower depths. There’s little of the frightening menace the actor brought to “Training Day,” where you see the pleasure his character derives from his sadism. Even when Lucas goes ballistic, beating a man to pulp,  the film tosses in a laugh about the proper way to clean a bloodied rug.  Seriousness has always been one of Mr. Scott’s strengths as a director, but when his material has skewed too light, too frivolous, the gravity and purpose etched into each one of his meticulous, beautiful images have also helped sink films. He couldn’t make an ironic gesture if he wanted to, or toss off an idea or a shot. Everything counts, even if it shouldn’t. (Such was the case with his and Mr. Crowe’s last collaboration, their 2006 Provençal folly, “A Good Year,” a soufflé made with lead.) Mr. Scott makes the case for his and his new film’s seriousness in its opener, which shows Lucas tossing a match at a man who has been doused with gasoline and then pumping bullets into the burning, screaming figure.  This is the match that ignites the story of a criminal overlord who, without mercy or remorse, takes down one human being after another, many of whom, like the addicts he supplied, were as helpless as that burning man. By rights this match should also ignite a tragedy, and you can almost feel Mr. Scott trying to coax the material away from its generic trappings toward something rarefied, something like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 definitive American story, “The Godfather.” He comes closest to that goal with the suggestion that the lethal pursuit of the American dream is not restricted to one or two families — the Corleones, say, or the Sopranos — but located in a network of warring tribes that help to obscure the larger war of all against all.  The America in this film isn’t a melting or even a boiling pot; it’s a bitter object lesson about the logic of market-driven radical individualism, wherein a self-styled Horatio Alger type, thwarted by racial prejudice and born into poverty in North Carolina, grows up to become a powerful captain of the illegal-drug industry. Lucas pulls himself up by his bootstraps, a gun tucked into his belt, and becomes a folk hero (and a pop culture idol) who doles out free turkeys to the very community he helps enslave with narcotics, fear and despair. He gathers his relatives around to help him, modeling himself after the Mafia families with whom he does business. He builds a gang, but only so it can serve his personal desires.  The bottom line of what a Frank Lucas does — to people, to neighborhoods — doesn’t make for entertainment. And so, despite Mr. Scott’s talent for trouble and shadows (the cinematographer Harris Savides bleeds all the bright color from this world), he soon loosens his grip on Lucas. He lingers over the garish surfaces and violence, and the exotic locales where Lucas found a steady supply of pure heroin. He quotes “Super Fly,” fires up Bobby Womack,  samples Richard M. Nixon and tosses in a pinch of black power rhetoric to mask the rot. He distracts and entertains until the divide between his seriousness of purpose and the false glamour that wafts around American gangsters, and invariably trivializes their brutality, becomes too wide to breach.  Like many moviemakers (and watchers), Mr. Scott loves his bad guy too much. And by turning Lucas into a figure who seduces instead of repels, an object of directorial fetishism and a token of black resistance, however hollow, he encourages us to submit as well. Part of this is structural and economic: blood and nihilism are always better sells than misery and hopelessness. Yet there’s also a historical dimension, because when Lucas strolls down a fast-emptying Harlem street after putting a bullet into another man’s head and the camera pulls back for the long view, you are transported into the realm of myth. Once, another gunman, or the director, might have taken direct aim at Lucas. But the world belongs to gangsters now, not cowboys.  “American Gangster” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit and very realistic-looking intravenous drug use and bloody, bloody gun violence.

"American Gangster" wants to be a great epic crime saga so badly you can feel it. The true story at its core -- of the rise, fall and redemption of a '70s-era Harlem drug lord -- is so terrific, it's amazing it wasn't put onscreen long ago, and it would be difficult today to find two better actors to pit against one another, as hoodlum and cop, respectively, than Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. With so many elements going for it, this big, fat Universal release is absorbing, exciting at times and undeniably entertaining, and is poised to be a major commercial hit. But great it's not.
Memories of numerous classics hang over this film like banners commemorating past championship teams -- "The Godfather," "Serpico," "Prince of the City," "Scarface" and "Goodfellas," among other modern-era crime-pic landmarks. Like most of those, this is a quintessential New York story, one you feel could have been the basis for a Sidney Lumet masterpiece. But while "American Gangster" is made with consummate professionalism on every level, it just doesn't quite feel like the real deal; it delivers, but doesn't soar.
Based on a New York magazine article by Mark Jacobson, the story arc is so sensational it warrants outsized treatment. Frank Lucas rose from Harlem crime-world minion to drug kingpin by bringing in uncut heroin straight from Southeast Asia during the height of the Vietnam War. At least the way the script tells it, his steps were dogged by notably incorruptible working-class federal investigator Richie Roberts (a man not once mentioned in Jacobson's piece), and the upshot was the hammer coming down on the NYPD's drug enforcement cops, three-fourths of whom were on the take.
Steven Zaillian's script plausibly lays the story out on parallel tracks, following the two men until they finally meet very late in the game. It's an intelligent, craftsmanlike job that coherently lays out a complicated, multifaceted tale, but also one that serves up genuine intensity and overblown aspects in virtually equal measure, with director Ridley Scott following suit.
Contrast between the two protags is neatly set up. Frank (Denzel Washington), driver and collector for legendary Harlem hood Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III, classy), steps into the void left by his mentor's death in 1968 by traveling to the jungles of Thailand and, with crucial help from an Army relative, transporting 100 kilos of pure heroin back to the U.S. via military planes. Eliminating any middleman, Frank floods the streets with top-quality stuff, undercuts the competition's prices and reaps huge profits.
In an era of pimp-style flash and braggadacio, Frank cuts an intriguingly low-key profile; he dresses conservatively, eats breakfast alone early every morning in a local diner and seems not to indulge in his own merchandise. But when crossed, he doesn't hesitate to administer punishment personally by shooting the transgressor himself in broad daylight.
On the other hand, Richie (Russell Crowe) is a sweaty, scraping-it-together Joisy kid going through an unpleasant divorce and studying for a law degree when he's not chasing down drug dealers. He becomes the notorious exception to the rule in his profession when he busts a couple guys with a million bucks in the trunk and insists on turning it in.
With little visible opposition, Frank does more than his share to spread drugs and crime throughout New York. Pic barrels like an uptown express through this moral issue, neither condemning the self-made entrepreneur nor excessively glamorizing him, blaxploitation-style (the real Frank Lucas was, by all accounts, considerably flashier than Washington's version allows).
As Frank expands his empire, he brings his five younger brothers up from North Carolina and proudly installs his dirt-poor mother (Ruby Dee) in a white mansion on a hill. Frank meets and marries Miss Puerto Rico 1970 (Lymari Nadal); puts would-be rivals at a polite distance (Armand Assante's Italian mobster, who wants part of Frank's action) or in their place (Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Nicky Barnes, Frank's real-life Harlem competitor); and makes a return trip to Thailand to engineer the most ambitious import scheme of his career (although not nearly as breathtaking as the real man's alleged career-capper).
To make an end run around the NYPD, the feds recruit Richie to lead their own drug probe, a move that bumps Mr. Clean up against top cop Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin) in some of the film's most jolting interludes. Trupo's brazen sense of entitlement to a cut of everyone's drug profits is jaw-droppingly audacious, and it's played to the hilt of threatening menace by Brolin, who steals scenes from even Washington and Crowe. With this and his splendid turn in "No Country for Old Men," Brolin has graduated to the bigs this year.
But it's when Richie, in a spectacular raid on Frank's factory, nails his prey, and Washington and Crowe finally end up across a desk from one another in a small room, that "American Gangster" achieves maximum voltage. What goes down during their exchanges proves all the more engrossing thanks to the shrewd underplaying of these two terrific actors, both of whom rise to the occasion when pitted opposite the best.
Still, there's an irony in that, good as he is, Crowe is essentially miscast as the tenacious working-class Jewish kid who brings Frank down. Having an actor of Crowe's stature play Frank's adversary helps balance the film, but this is one of the few roles he's played for which he brings nothing special to the table, and which does not allow his considerable charisma to flourish.
Similarly miscast is director Scott, whose greatest strengths lie in bringing to life grandly conceived portraits of distant worlds past and future, rather than in contemporary realism. Maximizing a gritty big-city story requires a credibility composed of thousands of small details, and this is one area where a citizen-of-the-world director like Scott can't excel. It's akin to asking Lumet or Scorsese to make a definitive film about crime in '70s Newcastle -- they could do a respectable, even exciting job of it, but it probably wouldn't ring deeply true.
Still, Washington's steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas holds the film together. Even if he doesn't entirely give the impression of a street hustler who never attended school in his life, Washington presents a man of striking, thoroughly credible contradictions: cool businessman/explosive killer, loner/family man, engaging guy/scourge of society.
Awash in blues, functional lensing is something of a disappointment coming from the usually distinctive Harris Savides. Though it achieves a decent momentum, pic feels its length.

American Gangster  is a movie with obvious gravitas and a familiar argument: Organized crime is outsider capitalism. As archetypal as its title, Ridley Scott 's would-be epic aspires to enshrine Harlem dope king Frank Lucas  in Hollywood  heaven, heir to Scarface and the Godfather. Or, as suggested by the Mark Jacobson  article on Lucas that inspired the movie, a real-life Superfly.
Ambitious as American Gangster  is, it's well suited to Denzel Washington 's particular star qualitythe circumspect badass. Washington plays Lucas as a combination of ruthless thug and gentlemanly striver. His two sides are established in a murky opening sequence when, factotum to old-school crime boss Bumpy Johnson , Lucas torches a guy in one shot and tosses Christmas turkeys to the crowd in the next.
It's 1968, and Bumpy is complaining that corporations are pushing out the middle man. He then drops dead in the very chain-store outlet that prompted his disquisition, leaving Lucas to create a new empireby eliminating the middle man. Rather than dealing with the mob, Lucas figures out a way to import high-grade heroin direct from Indochina. Then he takes Harlem by storm, selling smack that's twice as good for half the price under the label Blue Magic.
Scott's Lucas is more attractive, if less hypnotic, than the character profiled by Jacobson. (The writer notes that upon hearing tapes of his conversations with Lucas, his wife remarked, "Oh . . . you're doing a story on Satan.") To balance the moral equation, Steven Zaillian 's script introduces a Lucas nemesis in the form of actual police detective Richie Roberts  (Russell Crowe ). As Lucas is a visionary, Roberts is a man of stoopid integrity. Busting a bookie, he finds a car stuffed with unmarked bills and actually brings it in as evidencecausing his partner, soon to be revealed as a drooling junkie, to moan: "I'm a leper because I listened to you and turned in a million bucks."
The world capital of smack and police corruptionsuch was disco-era New York. Still, for all of American Gangster 's discreet period markers and cleverly cobbled- together locations, it doesn't get the period's putrid exhilarationthe sense of irreversible decay and giddy disorder. Scrupulously academic, it does acknowledge the key texts of the day: Scott recycles the theme from Across 110th  Street , references Sidney Lumet 's Prince of the City , and draws on the quintessential New York dope opera so closely that his movie might have been subtitled The "French Connection " Connection . Albeit directed with high-powered panache, American Gangster  lacks The French Connection 's messy human drama and, a choreographed final bust notwithstanding, thrill-machine set pieces. The movie never spins out of control.
American Gangster  functions on parallel tracks: As Roberts recruits a posse of lowlife cops, so Lucas brings his brothers up from North Carolina to help in the business. As the cop's marriage falls apart, the gangster treats his wife, Miss Puerto Rico 1970, like a queen. Further, both men are humiliated and threatened by the predatory animals of the NYPD's corrupt Special Investigations Unit . American Gangster and Honest Cop, each played by an Oscar-winning tough guy, finally converge when Roberts stakes out the Ali-Frazier fight and, spotting the self-effacing Lucas ringside in an uncharacteristic sable coat, has to wonder: "Who the fuck is that guy?"
Who indeed? Lucas is self-made with a vengeance, a cold-blooded killer and warm-hearted family man in one tightly wound package. It's one of the movie's running gags that nobodycertainly no white person save Robertsseems able to understand that Lucas actually works for himself. American Gangster  more than makes its point regarding his entrepreneurial spirit. But Roberts is actually more enigmatic: What makes him so irrationally honest? Could it be the same thing that inspires Lucas? Late in the movie, the gangster dodges an assassin's bullet and waxes indignant: "I ain't running from nobodythis is America."
Marc Levin 's current documentary Mr. Untouchable , a portrait of Lucas's better-known rival Nicky Barnes , shares American Gangster 's logic in presenting its subject as an all-American business genius. Barnes too brags about his professional operation and high-quality shit, dismissing Lucas and his family as rubes: "They acted country and they dressed country." The corresponding cameo in American Gangster  is a mirror image: When Lucas discovers that Barnes (broadly played by Cuba Gooding Jr.)  is slapping his Blue Magic brand on inferior smack, he confronts his competitor and, with all the indignation of an idealistic MBA, accuses him of "trademark infringement."
That's not the only grotesque irony to be found in American Gangster , although at 157 minutes, the movie is a tad leisurely in letting the audience in on Lucas's secret dope-smuggling methoda social metaphor that gives the notion "wrapped in the flag" a whole new meaning.
