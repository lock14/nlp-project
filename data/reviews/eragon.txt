Dear George Lucas: What gives with this Eragon
 jazz? I mean, gee whiz, did you seriously think that we wouldn't recognize you, the Great Man, as the guiding, um, force
 behind this dull retelling of Star Wars
? C'mon, man, give us a little credit: An orphaned farm boy raised by his uncle who harbors a secret destiny as the last of a magical breed of warriors? An evil king and an imperiled princess? A sage old mentor and a cocksure sidekick? A rebel alliance, and a desperate, final airborne assault on the forces of darkness? Dude, we've been over this before. Enough, already. It's bad enough that you've cloaked your true identity behind that of a 15-year-old bestselling novelist by the name of Christopher Paolini � which, frankly, is totally creeping us out � (that was you in the chat room the other day asking about the length of my broadsword, wasn't it?) but did you have to remake Episode IV
 all over again? With friggin' dragons
?! Trust me, the X-Wings were infinitely cooler. I can sympathize with your postpartum Tattooine-sextet blues, and I realize it can be difficult for an artist of your caliber to wake up one day and realize that all your lightsabers are suddenly behind you, but don't you think it's best for all concerned to let long ago and far away stay that way? Why resurrect, recontextualize, and reimagine the Jedi saga as a lot of pseudo-medieval, dragon-happy claptrap? Leave that to the pros, like Peter Jackson and his WETA team and keep the Lucasfilm and Skywalker brands out of it. Sure, Irons in the Obi-Wan role is genius casting, but Malkovich as the king/emperor? Ninety seconds of Malkovich is never enough, although the final shot does
 set up his eventual return in a sequel. I suppose you chose Edward Speleers to embody the dragon-riding savior Eragon because, like Mark Hamill, he's a newcomer to film and sports blond hair and a guileless smile � okay, I get it, but why Carlyle in the Durza/Vader role? Just because the guy cracked skulls and radiated bad juju in Trainspotting
 shouldn't typecast him as Evil's cat's paw (plus, it reminds us of Ewan McGregor's far better turn as Obi-Wan). Even the effects work here is subpar. All those lousy rear-projection shots of Eragon astride the dragon Saphira look like they were lifted from Reptilicus
! And Rachel Weisz as the voice of the dragon? Dude, what have you been smoking? Hobbit shake? So your ruse failed, Mr. Lucas. We know it's you. But take heart, Old Man Skywalker: Your legacy is safe and continues to spawn new and ever more clever permutations on fan sites the Internet over (you should check out the the Kirk/Spock/Vader B&D fanfic sometime!). You're already golden, Dragon Boy. Just try and stay that way.



"Eragon" is the first in a planned series of movies based on Christopher Paolini's insanely popular fantasy novels, but it already feels tired. If you've seen one flock of digitally animated fire arrows streaking across the night sky, you really have seen them all. And must every hero in the heat of a crypto-medieval battle make an exclamation that wouldn't sound out of place in "Mortal Kombat" before he vanquishes an enemy ? Apparently, yes. In this movie, it's "Let's finish this!"
Paolini started writing the series of books when he was 15. His hero is Eragon, a teen farm boy in the land of Alagaësia, who, with the help of his trusty dragon, becomes a fierce warrior. Young readers (mostly preadolescent boys) of these tales have an intense kinship with the books. They've discovered something new, and the discovery is special. However derivative these stories might be, they do have the sweep of their author's precociously good, if gangly prose.
Presumably, many of these same boys have seen "The Lord of the Rings" films, the " Harry Potter" movies, or "The Chronicles of Narnia." "Eragon" the movie is more of the same only a lot less, even by the low standard set by the video game that was made last year of C.S. Lewis's "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
The whole thing is a rehash right down to having John Malkovich cough up another hissy overlord. Malkovich plays King Galbatorix (the name gives a better performance), and his highness is miffed that the enormous blue egg -- it looks like an extra-strength pill from "The Matrix" -- Eragon (Edward Speleers) found in the forest has hatched. This means the boy will be coming to defeat him.
From the egg pops Saphira, a little blue dragon that will grow to intimidating size and communicate telepathically with Eragon, using the voice of Rachel Weisz, who's stuck with purely exclamatory thoughts. (Speleers makes complementarily big faces; his hair, meanwhile, appears to have been colored and styled at Ye Olde Salon.)
Eragon and Saphira are most powerful when he rides her. There's an intriguing whiff of sexual metaphor in the relationship, although that's a possibility likely lost on the average pre-pubescent. More important: The boy and his new partner resurrect a bygone era of dragon-riding that excites Eragon's crusty mentor, Brom.
Played by Jeremy Irons in fits of fatigue and glee, Brom remembers life before Galbatorix's tyranny. "There was a time when our land flourished without cruelty or fear," he announces. The duo of Eragon and Saphira fills his heart. Happy to vicariously experience his own thwarted dragon-riding glory, Brom tags along to help the revolutionaries stop the king.
But since a showdown with Malkovich has to wait for a future "Eragon" installment, Galbatorix dispatches a bewigged Robert Carlyle, as the evil sorcerer Durza, to hold them off.
Director Stefen Fangmeier is an experienced visual-effects supervisor making his debut behind the camera, and it says a lot that the studio turned the book over to a technician and not a visionary. "Eragon" is a handful of scenes flung at the screen. There's no rhythm or emotion holding the movie together. In three minutes, Eragon goes from the forest at night, to a scene with Irons, to the golden fields of his uncle's farm, to horseplay with his cousin, to two scenes of his cousin's abrupt departure, to a shot of him plaintively staring out at the dusk, to the sudden hatching of that big blue egg.
In hacking Paolini's book to the bone, the movie's three screenwriters use a glut of exposition to drag us to the climactic battle sequence, where sloppy editing prevails. Darn if I could follow it or tell what was at stake or who was who. I did catch Djimon Hounsou standing around a cave looking chic in costumes presumably from Ralph Lauren's feudalist collection.
The mess that's been made with all this money is maddening. This isn't economical moviemaking. It's a deluxe trailer for "Eragon 2."


         Adapting movies from popular books for youths is always a dangerous proposition as filmmakers struggle to appease passionate readers and at the same time appeal to a broader audience. Last year's holiday hits "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" prove the feat can be accomplished, but then there are movies such as the fantasy tale "Eragon," which takes an already derivative plot and guts it like so many Urgals.
 
 Based on the bestselling 2003 novel written by then-teenager Christopher Paolini, "Eragon" is at its core "Star Wars" grafted into Middle-earth. Newcomer Ed Speleers plays Eragon, a coming-of-age farmboy raised by his Uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong).
 


         






   After Garrow's death, Eragon is taken under the wing of Obi-Wanish Brom (Jeremy Irons), who tutors him in magic and warfare as they travel to join the rebellious Varden and their fight against the evil Empire.
 
 The twist to the theme is that Eragon discovers a dragon egg, and when it hatches he's literally marked as one of the mythical dragon riders à la the Jedi knights. The dragon, who communicates telepathically with Eragon via the maternal voice of Rachel Weisz, manages to age from near infancy to young adulthood during a single flight.
 
 Screenwriter Peter Buchman similarly truncates the rest of the source material and in so doing fails to adequately develop the relationship between Eragon and his dragon and renders key characters superfluous, such as the charismatic and mysterious Murtagh (Garrett Hedlund, a potentially better choice for Eragon over the ultra-vanilla Speleers). In contrast, an Elven warrior (played luminously by Sienna Guillory) receives extra screen time as eye candy decked out in a single-shoulder bodice and later in body-hugging armor akin to a cheung-sam
.
 
 Inevitably, "Eragon" reaches its less-than-epic final battle between the Varden and the Urgals, who despite their monstrous name are disappointingly human. It's here that first-time director and Industrial Light & Magic veteran Stefen Fangmeier finally gets to flex his muscles, but again it's at the expense of the original material as he replaces the book's climactic scene with a dizzying aerial battle featuring Eragon and his dragon against a sorcerer Shade (Robert Carlyle) astride a giant bat.
 
 Given Weta Digital's involvement in "Eragon," comparisons to the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy are unavoidable. Such talk would be high praise indeed; unfortunately, any conversation involving "Eragon" is likely to center on its place among the likes of "Dragonheart," "Reign of Fire" and the rest of the mediocre dragon flicks.

 In general release.   

 “Eragon” is what happens when misguided studio executives option a novel written by a teenager (Christopher Paolini) with a head full of Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin. Not full enough, however; this boy-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen’s manager. Even the scaly star, a Delft-blue beastie whose tint suggests either royal lineage or hypothermia, seems unsure of her motivation.  Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, “Eragon” boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Ed Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. A hint of the exotic is provided by a dreadlocked Djimon Hounsou — who seems to be phoning in his lines from a booth in the Bahamas — while the marvelous Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, playing a steadily decomposing wizard, hisses incantations from a mouth resembling a nicotine-stained graveyard.  The film’s few moments of hilarity are no less welcome for being completely unintended (the young hero’s heavy-breathing romp with a strapping male cousin could only have been envisioned by someone completely lacking in subtext radar), though “Into the sky, to win or die!” doesn’t have quite the same mythic flair as “One Ring to Rule Them All.” And if some of the characters won’t be returning for the sequel, no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience.  “Eragon” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some medieval-style violence (impalings, bashing with heavy objects) and dragon-on-dragon mauling.

Kicking off yet another projected cinematic trilogy laden with dungeons, dragons and digital wizardry, "Eragon" confirms that novelist Christopher Paolini is no J.R.R. Tolkien -- but more to the point, helmer Stefen Fangmeier is no Peter Jackson. Appropriating all the external trappings of big-budget fantasy but none of the requisite soul, this leaden epic never soars like the CG-rendered fire-breather at the core of its derivative mythology. Fox's meek marketing push is not a good omen for an oddly positioned year-end release, which may conjure early biz from the sword-and-sorcery set but should soon be era-gone from theaters.
Paolini was only 19 when "Eragon," the first novel in his "Inheritance" trilogy, was privately published in 2002. Since then, the 500-plus-page tome has spawned a bestselling second edition (printed by Knopf) and an even longer sequel, "Eldest," with a third volume currently in the works. No future films have yet been officially announced; presumably, that decision will await the performance of this decidedly inauspicious first outing.
The story unfolds in the realm of Alagaesia, a land once ruled by the noble Dragon Riders -- until one of their own, the evil Galbatorix (John Malkovich), seized power by cutting down his fellow riders and nearly driving their steeds into extinction. Fortunately, one egg survived, fated to fall into the hands of a 15-year-old farm boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers), who is shocked to find himself branded by the newly hatched dragon as its rider.
The film's prologue immediately invokes "The Lord of the Rings" with its grim narration about an epic clash between good and evil and an unlikely hero who would bring about salvation. To a certain extent, Fangmeier (a visual-effects man making his directorial debut) and scribe Peter Buchman are merely following the book, whose elaborate maps of imaginary worlds and smattering of invented Elvish dialects were clearly conceived from the Tolkien template.
But the film fails to duplicate the immersive narrative rhythms, the rough, tactile poetry or the beguiling sense of wonder -- in short, the magic -- that came so effortlessly to Jackson in his "Rings" adaptation. It does, however, boast plenty of exposition, anachronistic dialogue, Renaissance Faire-style posturing and enough arcane mythologies and barely pronounceable names (Ra'zac? Urgals?) to warrant a glossary in the press notes.
The challenge of paring down Paolini's massive tale to a manageable length results in slapdash pacing: It takes all of five minutes for Eragon to get over the untimely death of his uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong) and maybe five minutes more for his new pet to grow into an enormous, fully formed dragon named Saphira.
Standing 15 feet tall with a roughly 30-foot wingspan, Saphira reps an impressively gargantuan feat of character design, but the decision to anthropomorphize the dragon immediately renders her less interesting. Though she cannot speak, Saphira is linked telepathically to her rider, allowing Eragon and the audience to hear her decidedly human-like thoughts (voiced by Rachel Weisz).
Under the guidance of an Obi-Wan-like mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons, providing invaluable support), Eragon and Saphira set out on a dangerous quest to reach a band of rebels known as the Varden. Obligatory scenes follow in which the vile Galbatorix orders his demon-possessed sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle, unrecognizable in a Marilyn Manson wig and zombie-pale makeup) to kill the rider and his dragon at any cost, leading to yet more obligatory skirmishes between Eragon and a horde of fierce but surprisingly vanquishable assassins.
"Yesterday, you were a farm boy; today, you are a hero," intones Arya (Sienna Guillory), the beautiful maiden whom Eragon rescues. Her pronouncement sums up exactly what's wrong with the movie: It's so busy trying to strike all the right notes in the allotted timeframe that not a single narrative development -- most crucially, Eragon's evolution from naive stripling to powerful warrior-wizard -- feels even remotely earned.
That's partly due to Speleers, who resembles a youngish cross between Simon Baker and Mark Hamill, and whose blandness in the title role gives a viewer little to invest in. As the resident megalomaniacal villain, Malkovich rightly should have sent the material spiraling into camp, but he seems disappointingly straitjacketed by his chain mail. Only thesp who registers with an actual performance is Irons, whose resonant bass tones could make even banalities sound Shakespearean.
Widescreen cinematography repeatedly apes the vertiginous swooping cameras of "Lord of the Rings," but despite the level of production detail and highly photogenic locations (pic was shot in Hungary and Slovakia), the illusion of a fully inhabited supernatural world never takes hold. Patrick Doyle's score is less evocative than his music for "A Little Princess" and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" would seem to promise.
