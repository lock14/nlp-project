         If it weren't for a few small, telltale details — a character flipping through not one but two Dostoevsky novels at bedtime, a cash-challenged actress living in a charming London one-bedroom — you might never know that "Match Point" was Woody Allen's latest. For one thing, it's set in London, and only one of the major characters is American. For another, there's no Woody Allen character in sight, not even a thinly veiled British one. Nobody stutters or trips over the furniture, compulsively quoting Strindberg and Groucho Marx. It pretty much keeps its pulse steady, its blood cold and its nerves tamped down — which, combined with cinematographer Remi Adefarasin's architectural Hitchcockian flourishes, lends a queasy, cool air to the proceedings.
 
  The main female characters — Scarlett Johansson as Nola, an American actress, and Emily Mortimer as Chloe, an upper-class English girl — have shades of Allen's women, but their respective sensuality and sweetness keep them from ever going over the neurotic edge. The male characters, Chloe's brother Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and his onetime tennis instructor, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), are perhaps tellingly stuffy in their tastes (both are young, gorgeous and straight opera 
buffs, of all things), but even this characteristic Allen tic, the loading down of his characters with dubious high-culture bona fides, slides by in this context. Watching "Match Point," you could almost conclude that Allen is shedding some of his more calcified habits, that he's molting.
 


         






    This may have something to do with the all-new foreign setting. The movie was originally supposed to have been shot in the Hamptons, and I, for one, am very glad it wasn't. "Match Point" plays out among the verdant tennis clubs, seigneurial country houses and airy lofts of London's filthy, and apparently at least partially self-made, rich. It looks like Charles and Camilla territory, but it acts more like Rupert Murdoch. The Hewetts are outwardly democratic types with social Darwinist streaks. Had they been in America, they might have spent half their time talking about their court surfaces or racket strings and how much they cost. In England, they can live like demigods and pretend they don't — a distinction that allows Allen, for the first time in what feels like forever, to come across as wryly, slyly observant instead of out to lunch. Besides, Rhys-Meyers is almost absurdly sexy, making it easier to overlook the quirks.
 
  Chris is an Irish former tennis pro from a lowly background, an ambitious golden boy with the face and grace of an angel — lucky for him, he was born at a time when looks like his amount to money in the bank. At the exclusive tennis club where he's just been hired, Chris meets Tom, the son of a wealthy businessman played by Brian Cox. Tom takes an instant liking to Chris and invites him to join the family in their box at the opera, and later home for a weekend en famille 
in the country. Chloe is instantly smitten with Chris, and soon, through very little effort on his part, he finds himself ensconced in a life of outrageous privilege.
 
  The glitch, natch, is blond, gorgeous and trouble — or rather, she's the type everybody perceives 
as trouble, so trouble keeps getting heaped on her. Nola is engaged to Tom, a fact that vexes Tom's mother, Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), to no end. It's not just that Nola is a struggling actress and an American, no less, but she has a dark streak that brings out the most predatory instincts in smiling sharks like the Hewetts. It's one thing for their sweet and fragile daughter to marry an ambitious young man they can mold and control; it's altogether another for their son and heir to throw himself away on a brooding sexpot. Unlike Chris, Tom can afford to do as he pleases. Still, Chris is drawn to Nola like a lemming to a steep cliff. One rainy afternoon, after Eleanor has casually broken Nola's spirit once again, Chris runs out after her to offer a shoulder and whatever else. There's a sudden, waterlogged tryst in the heather, which Nola assures him is a one-time deal. So Chris marries Chloe, and Tom (none the wiser) dumps Nola for another woman. Chris runs into Nola again and asks — consequences be damned — for her phone number, and energetically paced, well-plotted tragedy ensues.
 
  Well, maybe more high-class potboiler than tragedy, one you're only too happy to get caught up in. Like "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Match Point" is a meditation on morality, though not quite as discursive and self-conscious. The Dostoevsky references, for instance, are kept to a minimum, though you almost wish they weren't there at all. It's interesting that Allen, after all these years and movies, keeps sending out for cultural reinforcements. After all, he does a perfectly good job of backing Chris into a corner like a rat all by himself, without any help from Fyodor, thanks very much. And Rhys-Meyers deports himself admirably in the role.
 
  So, for that matter, do Mortimer and Johansson. Mortimer's Chloe is sweet-natured but so pampered and sheltered she can't inspire much more than a sort of benign, well-wishing contempt. It can't have been easy to elicit that, but Mortimer does it effortlessly with a slope of a shoulders, an awkwardness in the gait and fleeting frightened look in her eyes. Johansson, meanwhile, is saddled with the burden of representation of one of Allen's scorned women — a role that has felled bigger girls than she. But either the director's touch has lightened or Johansson's earthiness goes such a long way to round out the edges that even when she tips into hysteria, she retains her dignity and power.
 
  What accounts for Chris' life going one way and Nola's another? Chris, and Allen, have a theory: At certain crucial points in life as in tennis it all comes down to luck. When the privileged, blissfully ignorant Chloe, whose father's money has bought her a house, a career and a husband, chirps something about the all-conquering value of hard work, it's the funniest moment in the movie. "Oh, that's mandatory," Chris says, appeasing her. But he and Nola know better.

In recent years, Woody Allen's movies have grown encrusted with mannerism, set less inside the real world than in the twee Upper East Side of his mind. Now he has rediscovered himself, and reality, too. To call Match Point  Allen's comeback would be an understatement: It's the most vital return to form for any director since Robert Altman made The Player . The film's tone  knowing, sexy, controlled, not at all jokey  has something to do with the London setting, and also with the fact that the lead actor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, hasn't been asked to mimic Woody's fumbling Brooklyn tics from 30 years ago or the anxiety beneath them. Match Point  isn't a tale of ''neurosis.'' It's a serious and lusciously entertaining adultery drama driven by a lust that turns into authentic compulsion.
You know Allen has found a way back to common experience, that he's remembered what it looks and feels like, the moment Chris Wilton (Rhys Meyers), a good-but-not-good-enough Irish tennis star, recently retired from the championship circuit, takes a job as a club pro and rents a tattered flat in London. He can't believe how high the rent is, and the broker, with his pushy East End accent, only adds insult to economic injury. Immediately, Match Point  hooks us with the silken ambition of its hero, a young climber with style and wit and enough brains to keep a hood over his appetites. When he befriends Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), a rich kid who leads a charmed life, and starts to date his sister, the lovely, conventional Chloe (Emily Mortimer), it's a mutual courtship: the ''innocent'' outsider submitting to the hospitality of his hosts, when it's really he who's doing the seducing, flattering them by playing the part of the perfect guest.
Rhys Meyers, with rock-star lips and eyebrows serious enough to rival Montgomery Clift's, has a flushed sensuality that can look, by turns, debonair or depressed. We glimpse the hunger beneath his mask, even when it turns to silent, simmering jealousy. At the Hewetts' estate, Chris walks into a Ping-Pong game, and there he meets Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an aspiring actress who is American, troubled, and gorgeous in a come-hither way that suggests a cross between Veronica Lake and Jenna Jameson. She is, in a word, irresistible; she is also Tom's fiancée.
Johansson gives her a faintly husky voice, a looking-for-trouble carnality that's all the more potent for emerging from a vaguely unsettled nature. Yet even as Nola, who drinks and flirts too much, occupies the role of fatal-attraction bad girl, she can't really be pigeonholed that way; a quality of decency, of buried romantic longing, shines through her promiscuous allure. She and Chris are both outsiders in a world of privilege. He puts the moves on her  he literally has no choice about it. Yet his instincts keep him on the fast track to marry Chloe and take a job at one of her dad's finance firms. For this poor Irish kid, that's a compulsion too  the lust for upward mobility. The movie depends on our recognizing what Chris, tragically, only half does: that his desire for Nola is the real thing, passion  true love embedded in the urgency of hormones.
Match Point  isn't labored, like Crimes and Misdemeanors , and there isn't a false note in it  not a snob wisecrack out of place, not a character who sags into stereotype. Allen doesn't fall into the trap of mocking these high-life Brits, with their horses and hunts and round-the-clock drinks; they may be complacent, but they have sharp eyes and good hearts. They're honest in their enjoyment of wealth. The apartment that Chloe's father (Brian Cox), in his controlling benevolence, purchases for Chris and Chloe is so gorgeous it's a joke  a window-walled duplex overlooking the Thames  only Allen isn't using the real estate as a backdrop. He's made a film that embraces the addictive taste of money.
At the Hewett compound, Chris tries to keep Nola at bay on his cell phone, and we register, with a shudder, what a fearless, instinctive liar he is. He wants comfort and his romantic-erotic candy. It's a doomed quest, but such is the primal magic of movies that we're in his shoes, taking every squirmy step along with him. I can't think of another film that has caught the devious anxiety (or turn-on) of adultery with such close-up honesty. Rhys Meyers makes Chris a sympathetic slime, giving him a dozen shades of yearning, sweat, and deceit. When he takes drastic action, we're divided between pure horror at what he does and a desire to see him get away with it. Match Point , a meditation on crime and luck, has the design  the formal elegance  of a thriller, yet it has been made with a sublime eye for why people do what they do that marks it as Allen's finest movie since Manhattan.
2006 Oscar Nomination:  Best Original Screenplay (Woody Allen)

 Because Woody Allen's early films are about as funny as any ever made, it is often assumed that his temperament is essentially comic, which leads to all manner of disappointment and misunderstanding. Now and then, Mr. Allen tries to clear up the confusion, insisting, sometimes elegantly and sometimes a little too baldly, that his view of the world is essentially nihilistic. He has announced, in movie after movie, an absolute lack of faith in any ordering moral principle in the universe -  and still, people think he's joking.  In "Match Point," his most satisfying film in more than a decade, the director once again brings the bad news, delivering it with a light, sure touch. This is a Champagne cocktail laced with strychnine. You would have to go back to the heady, amoral heyday of Ernst Lubitsch or Billy Wilder to find cynicism so deftly turned into superior entertainment. At the very beginning, Mr. Allen's hero, a young tennis player recently retired from the professional tour, explains that the role of luck in human affairs is often underestimated. Later, the harsh implications of this idea will be evident, but at first it seems as whimsical as what Fred Astaire said in "The Gay Divorcée": that "chance is the fool's name for fate."  Mr. Allen's accomplishment here is to fool his audience, or at least to misdirect us, with a tale whose gilded surface disguises the darkness beneath. His guile - another name for it is art - keeps the story moving with the fleet momentum of a well-made play. Comparisons to "Crimes and Misdemeanors" are inevitable, since the themes and some elements of plot are similar, but the philosophical baggage in "Match Point" is more tightly and discreetly packed. There are few occasions for speech-making, and none of the desperate, self-conscious one-liners that have become, in Mr. Allen's recent movies, more tics than shtick. Nor is there an obvious surrogate for the director among the youthful, mostly British and altogether splendid cast. If you walked in after the opening titles, it might take you a while to guess who made this picture.  After a while you would, of course. The usual literary signposts are in place: surely no other screenwriter could write a line like "darling, have you seen my copy of Strindberg?" or send his protagonist to bed with a paperback Dostoyevsky. But while a whiff of Russian fatalism lingers in the air - and more than a whiff of Strindbergian misogyny - these don't seem to be the most salient influences. The film's setting is modified Henry James (wealthy London, with a few social and cultural outsiders buzzing around the hives of privilege); the conceit owes something to Patricia Highsmith's Ripley books; and the narrative engine is pure Theodore Dreiser - hunger, lust, ambition, greed.  Not that the tennis player, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), seems at first to be consumed by such appetites. An Irishman of modest background, he takes a job at an exclusive London club, helping its rich members polish their ground strokes. He seems both easygoing and slightly ill at ease, ingratiating and diffident. Before long, he befriends Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the amiable, unserious heir to a business fortune, who invites Chris to the family box at the opera. From there, it is a short trip to an affair with Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), a job in the family firm and the intermittently awkward but materially rewarding position of son-in-law to parents played by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton.  When "Match Point" was shown in Cannes last spring, some British critics objected that its depiction of London was inaccurate, a demurral that New Yorkers, accustomed to visiting Mr. Allen's fantasy Manhattan, could only greet with weary shrugs and sighs. Uprooting a script originally set in the Hamptons and repotting it in British soil has refreshed and sharpened the story, which depends not on insight into a particular social situation, but rather on a general theory of human behavior. London is Manhattan seen through a glass, brightly: Tate Modern stands in for the Museum of Modern Art; Covent Garden takes the place of Lincoln Center. As for the breathtaking South Bank loft into which Chris and Chloe move, it will satisfy the lust for high-end real estate that has kept the diehards in their seats during Mr. Allen's long creative malaise.  In this case, though, what happens in the well-appointed rooms and fashionable restaurants is more interesting than the architecture or the décor. Mr. Rhys-Meyers has an unusual ability to keep the audience guessing, to draw us into sympathetic concord even as we're trying to figure him out. Is he a cipher or a sociopath? A careful social climber or a reckless rake? The first clue that he may be something other than a mild, well-mannered sidekick comes when Chris meets Tom's fiancée, an American actress named Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), in a scene that raises the movie's temperature from a polite simmer to a full sexual boil. (The scene also quietly acknowledges a debt to "A Place in the Sun," George Stevens's adaptation of Dreiser's "American Tragedy." The parallels don't stop there. Mr. Rhys-Meyers's hollow-cheeked watchfulness recalls Montgomery Clift. Which makes Ms. Johansson either the next Elizabeth Taylor or the new Shelley Winters. Hmm).  What passes between Chris and Nola is not only desire, but also recognition, which makes their connection especially volatile. As their affair advances, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys-Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes. It is possible to identify with both of them - and to feel an empathetic twinge as they are ensnared in the consequences of their own heedlessness - without entirely liking either one.  But it is the film's brisk, chilly precision that makes it so bracingly pleasurable. The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allen's bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter.  "Match Point" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some steamy (though not explicit) sex scenes and a few moments of shocking violence.
What we think about when we think about Woody Allen : the Woody of the 1970s, parodic nebbish-genius turned self-satiric nebbish-romantic, whose films bore rich, thick meat and yet could produce belly laughs in the educated middle-aged. The Woody of the next decade, workaholic shotgun-spray auteur, who made some kind of progression toward maturity and inventiveness every other film. And the Woody of late, recycling menopauser and master of mannerism, his scenarios tame remakes, his characters instantly recognizable as meta-Woodys aping the man's trademarked delivery. Given the career entropy, his survival has been remarkable, as is the forgiving shower of accolades shepherding his new film, Match Point , home from Cannes . A modest and mildly pretentious mediocrity in the Woodman canon, the movie sports a British veneer, and this relative oddness has been cause for "return to form!" sighs of relief. But Allen is, alas, pushing forward and downward into de-fertilized soil badly in need of crop rotation.
To its misfortune, Match Point  must be viewed in terms of its hype; Allen has long been less a mere filmmaker than an art-entertainment axiom by whom many critics and urbanites have defined their cultural lives. It must be a depressing responsibility. His new hero, Chris Wilton  (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ), is a soft-voiced, unmoneyed lad hired as a tennis pro at an elite London country club. (Honestly, did you ever imagine that Allen and Rhys-Meyerswhose snarling, hip-swiveling career highlights run from Velvet Goldmine  to Ride With the Devil to Titus even existed on the same dimensional plane?) We know nothing about Chris beyond his fastidious politenessgracious, dead-air Brit banter as only Allen can imagine itas he is introduced around, meeting up with the gregarious and filthy rich Tom Hewett  (Matthew Goode ), whose aristocratic family requires more social encounters and empty chitchat. Match Point  is Allen's longest filmover two hoursand its first quarter lopes on tepidly enough to suggest the alienating first act of Kubrick's The Shining , but without the satanic visual chill and menacing psycho- pathology. Chris falls in with the Hewetts; the patriarch (Brian Cox ) mysteriously thinks him capable of great achievements in finance; the sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer ), adopts him as a boyfriend; and Tom's bedroom-eyes fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson ), eventually takes him as a lover.
Even after Chris's social climbing has born material fruitmarriage, a well-heeled job in the father-in-law's firmthe tone and content of Match Point  are so thoroughly banal that you begin to expect a revelation of Pinteresque stylization, a moment when the zombification of the upper classes manifests as an idea. Forget it; the narrative's comments on class mobility and priorities would sit comfortably in an Altoids  tin. What does become apparent is that all of this cloth-eared exhaustion is leading to a redo of a story thread from an earlier, and far richer, Allen movie (to go nameless here). Once that light dawns, the Allen-schooled viewer can only be overcome by a yen for the 1980s, and more robust Woodian cuisine.
Lauding Match Point  as a social morality tale has bite in its backswingAllen is one of this nation's most unapologetic wealth pornographers, here savoring the massive estates, stables, ultra-high-end retailers, the breakfast nooks that literally look out upon Westminster Abbey , the libraries filled with more leather-bound books than the filmographies of James Ivory  and Harry Potter  combined. Could Allen ever be interested again in poor people, American or otherwise? Both Chris and Nola are designated as low-income "outsiders," but nobody's at a loss for high-life, high-rent funds. Talk in the country of being "an accomplished grouse shooter!" seems inevitable; how did Allen avoid a foxhunt? Chris's rampaging success in banking, like virtually every tendril of the script that might interface with the world outside Allen's moving castle, is briefly talked up, never made flesh.
Even if this were a yuppified shot at An American Tragedy , the performances Allen gets, with his puppet hand permanently up his cast's colons, suggest an undergrad film adaptation of Dreiser. Approximating Woodspeak, Rhys-Meyers sounds as if he's faking his own accent, while the naturally warm and ironic Johansson is a square peg slammed into the round hole of her role's cliché-sultry, cigarette-and-come-hither-look femme. Crushingly humorless, Match Point  also has a grade-school-simple Major Theme: At the outset, Chris's narration informs us that life is luck, and at any point we could win or lose. Whoa. After the sixth or seventh time someone proclaims themselves "lucky!" I began to feel less so, and to wonder if luck fades, like eyesight, with age. After all, if Allen was flipping coins, he'd come up heads half the time.
