"Traitor" offers up one of the more maddeningly, gratifyingly complex lead characters seen in movies lately. Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) is a Sudanese-born, American-raised black man and a devoted Muslim. He's an explosives expert trained by the US military. He's also an enthusiastic new member of an international terrorist organization clearly modeled on Al Qaeda. And that's just for starters.
The film's a propulsive international espionage thriller, built on the hurry-scurry bones of the "Bourne" movies. It hops from Yemen to Washington, D.C., to Marseilles to London to Canada - the audience needs a visa just to keep up. And while "Traitor" expertly and entertainingly gets the pulse racing for two hours, it has more on its mind. Perhaps too much. Like a more urgent, slightly less smart "Syriana," the movie plugs into a grid of global political anxiety and warns us against thinking in black and white.
Samir's involvement with the bomb-squad wing prompts a slow-growing friendship with Omar, a self-styled "thinker not a soldier" played by the great French-Moroccan actor Saïd Taghmaoui ("The Kite Runner," "Three Kings"). Despite Samir's having a journalist girlfriend back in Chicago (Archie Punjabi), this is the real love story of "Traitor," and it's surprisingly affecting. Both men are rootless, intelligent, and sad; both are Muslims who dream in English. One uses his faith to rationalize killing innocents, the other - well, it's not entirely clear yet.
The movie, written and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff from a story by him and executive producer Steve Martin (yes, that Steve Martin; apparently he's wilder and crazier than we thought), keeps us guessing. Samir and the terrorist cell are being tracked by an FBI special task force headed by agent Roy Clayton, a brilliant, soft-spoken Southern boy played by Guy Pearce of all people. He has a partner (Neal McDonough), who's mostly on hand so Clayton can explain to us what's going on.
A bombing in Marseilles leaves several dead and Horn with blood on his hands; Cheadle beautifully conveys glints of moral agony beneath the character's dead eyes. As "Traitor" gradually circles back to America, building toward a terrorist plot that's half James Bond scenario and half post-9/11 paranoia (the worst kind, too - the kind that seems plausible), the film turns both more exciting and philosophically muddled.
It's not that there are too many characters involved - among them Jeff Daniels as a sneaky Capitol Hill pol and Aly Khan as a Saville Row jihadist. The problem with "Traitor" is that it wants to be compassionate while at the same time paralyzing us with Orange Level fear. The film reminds the audience that not all Muslims (or Christians, for that matter) think alike, and that "every religion has more than one face." It has respect for men of peace and sorrow for their opposite numbers. But it also shouts, with all-too-easy action-movie fervor, that the terrorists are here and they're right next door!
Well, which one's it going to be? "Traitor" ends with a satisfying twist that also renders the story more Hollywood-ordinary than one might like, but what sticks with a viewer is the anxiety gnawing at Cheadle's Samir Horn. The title cuts both ways: Who's the traitor here, and what's being betrayed? National security? One's God? As ambitious and provocative as "Traitor" is, I suspect it's the movie that got sold out.


The eyes are always a giveaway for the fine actor Don Cheadle . Here he is in Traitor  playing a bad guy, a renegade Sudanese-born U.S. military operative named Samir Horn who deals arms to Muslim terrorists in Yemen. We know from the start that Samir is himself a devout Muslim and that, as a child, he witnessed his father's death in a car bombing. So, by the shorthand of mindless stereotyping and movie storytelling, we accept that the foreign-born fellow has reason to become a bad guy, right? Yet one look deep into the star's gentle eyes, with their perpetual, moist glimmer of humanity, and you know  that the traitor's treachery doesn't track: Didn't those peepers recently convey the grace of a good man who saved hundreds in Hotel Rwanda  ? However far the bad guys get in Traitor   and there'll be no disclosure here   a Cheadle-wise viewer's attention is bound to drift, subconsciously waiting for the facts to match the face.
The wait isn't worth it in this fearmongering, opportunistic political/spy thriller, a slippery entertainment that's all feints and few punches thrown at a fight card of indistinguishable terrorists, Muslim and otherwise. Strip away the religious and ethnic red herrings devised by writer and first-time director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (he co-wrote the 2004 thriller The Day After Tomorrow  ) and the movie becomes less concerned with what makes Samir run than with where in the world (literally) Samir is running next, and whether he can be caught before stuff blows up. A sharp FBI agent (Guy Pearce ) is on the suspect's tail, assisted by a partner in the bad-fed role (Neal McDonough, his ice blue stare used, as it often is, to suggest a streak of sadism). Somewhere in the bureaucratic pileup, Jeff Daniels  checks in as a shadowy CIA contractor.
Meanwhile, many rainbow-colored actors (Middle Eastern, South Asian, African,   African-American  it seems to be all the same to central casting in Hollywood) contribute their faces in the cause of a paycheck (good for them) and an agitation of racist paranoia (not good for us). By the time the clock ticks down to the climactic act of terrorism  this time poised to take place on American soil  the makers of Traitor  count on audiences to be in a tizzy, distrustful of the stranger in the next seat. They would do better to hope no viewer looks too closely into Cheadle's eyes, truth-telling orbs that deserve credit here for not rolling.

 “Traitor,” a somber, absorbing and only moderately preposterous new thriller written and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff, manages an impressive feat of economy, condensing a vast and sometimes contradictory compendium of post-9/11 fears and anxieties into 110 swift minutes. The terrorists are all around us! The government is not doing enough to catch them! It’s doing too much!  The movie, despite  its unassuming style and tightly focused story, tries to cover every side and cater to just about every possible ideological objection, an effort at comprehensiveness that seems noble and a little nutty. There are, for instance, two F.B.I. agents, Clayton and Archer. Archer (Neal McDonough) is prone to making insensitive remarks about Islam and the Bill of Rights, and to smacking around suspected terrorists;  Clayton (Guy Pearce), a minister’s son with a soothing Southern accent, delivers calm homilies on religious tolerance and holds a Ph.D. in Arabic studies.  On the other side, there is Fareed (Aly Khan), a murderous and mercenary master terrorist whose jihadist cant is indistinguishable from hypocrisy. But then again there is Omar (Said  Taghmaoui), one of Fareed’s lieutenants, who, if you put aside his vocation as a planner of suicide bombings, seems like a pretty smart and thoughtful guy. American foreign policy is criticized in a general way —  hot-button words like Iraq, Israel and oil are never uttered — and no one could accuse Mr. Nachmanoff of underplaying the danger of Muslim extremism.  His point is not to suggest an easy symmetry — or, goodness knows, moral equivalence — between terrorists and American law-enforcement officials. Rather, the film’s sometimes clumsy efforts at topicality illuminate the conflicted psychology of its main character, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle). Samir, the son of an American mother and a Sudanese father, is an  observant  Muslim and a veteran of the Army Special Forces, a highly trained warrior whose allegiances are, at first and for a gratifyingly long time afterward, decidedly ambiguous.  He is, in other words, an elegantly conceived and suavely played construct, a theoretical being born out of a very real political conflict. Samir, enigmatic and quiet though he is, has less in common with Robert Ludlum’s Jason Bourne than he does with some of the cold-war specters dreamed up by John le Carré in his prime. Samir’s doubleness is built into his biography, and whatever choice he makes is likely to constitute some form of betrayal.  His friendship with Omar, whose partner he becomes in organizing murderous operations in Europe and America, seems genuine, even as the audience doubts his loyalty to Omar’s cause.  There are some scenes that groan with half-digested themes, but Mr. Cheadle’s performance gives “Traitor” a sense of ethical gravity and real intrigue. The story demands that we entertain the possibility that Samir is a bad guy, and also that he retain our sympathy when our doubts about him are most acute.  Mr. Cheadle, as subtle an actor as any working in movies today, accomplishes this without raising his voice or breaking a sweat. He has an ability to lay claim to the audience’s trust without quite reciprocating it, to seem at once guileless and guarded.  And Samir is mysterious precisely because he seems, at every turn, utterly sincere, honest even at his moments of greatest duplicity.  Somehow  the character retains his credibility even as the movie, perhaps inevitably, trips over some of its own complexities and confusions. On balance, though, Mr. Nachmanoff succeeds more often than he fails. A screenwriter (“The Day After Tomorrow”) making his debut as a director, he does not attempt the breathless pace and kaleidoscopic cutting that have become the dominant manner in globe-trotting action-suspense filmmaking. (See “The Kingdom” and especially the last two Bourne pictures.) Instead he builds up suspense slowly, cutting deliberately between the terrorists and their pursuers and withholding just enough information to set up surprises that don’t seem completely absurd.  The story moves around a lot — from Yemen to Canada, from Chicago to Marseille — and involves a lot of interesting minor characters, from Samir’s former girlfriend (Archie Panjabi) to the intelligence bureaucrat (Jeff Daniels) who knows his deepest secrets. But at its best “Traitor” feels less like the usual rushed, contrived action-travelogue than like an intimately scaled drama of ambiguous motives and fretful moral dilemmas. It holds your attention, even if you never quite believe it.  “Traitor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many violent scenes and some profanity. 

A provocative political thriller about a conflicted African-born Muslim American deeply immersed in the worlds of jihad and espionage, �Traitor� brandishes physical verisimilitude and intelligent seriousness but proves unable to really get inside its chameleon-like central character. Reminiscent of �Syriana� in its globe-hopping approach and desire to portray the roots and complexities of terrorism rather than just use it for melodramatic purposes, Jeffrey Nachmanoff�s well-mounted feature nonetheless feels more conventional due to its straighter-line narrative. Commercial prospects look just OK.
Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) carries a load of extreme influences, life experiences and contradictions that rep both a unique professional blessing and an impossible personal burden. Having witnessed as a youth his Muslim Brotherhood-friendly father blown up by a car bomb in his native Sudan, Samir made it to the States, became a special operations officer and ultimately seems to have gotten a bit too cozy with the Muhajadeen in Afghanistan. 
Where that leaves him politically and emotionally now is anyone�s guess. He�s apparently not averse to lending his expertise with explosives to the local Islamicists in Yemen, for which he�s thrown into a perfectly delightful prison, where his polite manner and impeccable American-accented English attract notice among the thugs. All the same, he establishes a rapport with Swiss-educated jihadist Omar (Said Taghmaoui), with whom he eventually manages a spectacular escape.
Since he�s a U.S. citizen and former military man, Samir merits the attention of FBI agents Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), who in short order also become preoccupied by a suicide bombing of Americans in Spain and a fatal attack on the U.S. consulate in Nice, a job personally engineered by Samir. This slim, quiet man moves about as inconspicuously as a shadow, his successes leading terrorism big shots to engage him to coordinate a massive upcoming attack in the American heartland. 
Nachmanoff, best known for co-writing �The Day After Tomorrow,� capably handles all the location juggling -- other destinations include Chicago, Washington, D.C., Toronto and Nova Scotia -- on what must have been a limited budget. He also creates absorbing scenes involving the jihadist inner circles, as the plotters lounge on the Riviera, recruit in Marseille and strategize in London. When zero hour approaches for the widespread mayhem planned for the U.S., it�s a tense and real question over what will happen.
Still, the odd, enigmatic figure at the center of it all somehow muffles the film�s impact. Early on, Samir admits, �I don�t feel at home anywhere,� and subsequent dialogue is larded with such comments as, �He�s caught between traditional Islam and the West.� Similarly, Nachmanoff and Cheadle, the latter also a producer here, seem caught between sustaining the ambiguity of Samir�s position for suspense -- is he really a good guy or bad guy? -- and genuinely examining this tragically torn figure. 
The first things to go in Cheadle�s portrayal of such a knotted, inward man are spontaneity and a sense of humor. Add to this a latent sense of self-importance about such a project and the result is an overly cautious, restrained and dry characterization of an individual who�s been robbed of a true sense of self; a volatile, exciting actor when he wants to be, Cheadle keeps himself on as tight a leash as does Samir.
The tale takes on an unexpected added layer midway through with the arrival of a wild-card character, rogue CIA vet Carter (Jeff Daniels), with motives and connections of his own.
Old- and new-style intelligence tactics are effectively limned by McDonough, as a quick-trigger roughhouser, and Pearce, whose soft Southern accent and cushion-shot investigative technique provide welcome counterpoint to the uptight personalities of almost everyone else. Similarly, Taghmaoui�s energy balances Cheadle�s reserve in their many scenes together.
The tactile verite-style lensing by J. Michael Muro, who shot the memorable early Beirut sequence in �The Insider,� makes the diverse settings come vividly alive, abetted by Laurence Bennett�s sharp production design. Mark Kilian�s atmospheric score and Billy Fox�s lean editing keep the film on the go. 


Traitor 's man on the run is Samir Horn  (Don Cheadle ), an American-born mercenary who at age nine witnessed his Sudanese Muslim father being blown to bits in a Middle Eastern car-bomb explosion. The culprits are unknown, but years later, Samir is in Yemen , selling Semtex explosives to jihadists and, as a bonus, providing lessons on how to handle a detonator. "I'm going to teach you how to use them," he says, "without blowing yourself upunintentionally, that is." It's a rare joke for the heavy-hearted Samir, who has a tendency to stare off into the distancea Cheadle specialtymulling over, perhaps, his time as a soldier in the U.S. Special Forces, a job (and a country) that he turned his back on after a tour of duty in Afghanistan  led him to become an Islamic fundamentalist.     
"Is he a devout Muslim?" FBI agent  Roy Clayton  (Guy Pearce ) asks Samir's girlfriend (Archie Panjabi ). "He's a Muslim," she replies. "I don't think there's a sliding scale." Clayton can't quite wrap his mind around a Special Ops soldier turning terrorist, even as evidence pours in that he's behind a series of European bombings, including an American-embassy explosion that kills eight. 
In its well-written first hour, Traitor   hops from continent to continent, with Nachmanoff, in his directorial debut, nimbly juxtaposing terror-cell intrigue with moments of self-reflection from FBI men and bad guys alike. The screenwriter gives the best lines to the bad guys, including a cell leader (Raad Rawi ) who sips expensive wine in French cafes and shakes his head at these foolish Americans. "Once upon a time, it was the Americans who were terrorists against the British," he says. "They've forgotten their history." Beyond such talk, the filmmaker steers clear of present-day politics, never mentioning Bush or Iraq  or even the CIA , focusing instead on the unruffled procedural professionalism of the FBI agents pursing Samir. 
In Europe, those FBI guys (including Neal McDonough  as Clayton's partner) are on their game, but they seem to get dumber once they return to America. Realism and insight go out the window as soon as Samir crosses the U.S. borderoh so easilyto set in motion one last big terror plot. Faintly, in the distance, the ghost of The Day After Tomorrow  begins to stir.
Cheadle, who has a gift for playing outsized personalitieslike D.C. DJ Petey Greene from last year's Talk to Me,  or the hyperactive killer in 1995's great Devil in a Blue Dress is stiff and self-conscious here, as if it's taking all his concentration to keep Samir's convoluted backstory straight in his head. He isn't helped by the spy-novel goofiness of the terrorist's final plan, which calls to mind a similar scheme propelling Don Siegel 's far superior 1977 thriller Telefon , in which a rogue KGB  agent travels across America activating deep-cover Russian agents with detonator skills of their own. Nachmanoff (and co-scenarist Martin?) has devised a nifty last-minute twist to the concept, but he appears to take little pleasure in the tellingalmost as if he's embarrassed to be having fun with a subject as serious as terror. Creating an ingenious mad bomber isn't quite the thrill it used to be.
