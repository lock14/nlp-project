Carter Page III (Woody Harrelson) in Paul Schrader's The Walker  is who Julian Kaye in Schrader's American Gigolo  might have become, had Julian not been blessed with Richard Gere's bone structure  and had Julian come out of the closet many movie fans guessed he had been camping out in for years. A chatty charmer in middle age, Page lightens the social burdens of married and widowed power-wielding Washington, D.C., ladies with his well-bred Southern manners, his gossip, and, he knows deep in his disgusted soul, his marginality. (Lucky jester  his society dames are played by Lauren Bacall, Lily Tomlin, and Kristin Scott Thomas.) It's only when he is implicated in a criminal investigation  the reward for loyalty to his favorite swan and senator's wife (Scott Thomas) while she canoodled with a lobbyist  that Page begins to understand he's been confusing the stink in his life with cologne.
Schrader has been proselytizing about the lonely male struggle for salvation for so long that the repetition of his stern themes makes the filmmaker's work interesting even when a particular parable stumbles  as The Walker  does. The brittle, very ''written'' catty quips meant to characterize Washington hypocrisy sound perfunctory; the story of an aging, self-hating homosexual who goes home alone to his lacquered town house feels ancient as well as uncomfortable for the writer-director. (Harrelson seems both game and ill at ease.) But moral stink? Schrader has a nose for what's in the air.

 Nothing in Paul Schrader’s film “The Walker” can quite match its delicious opening scene of sniping repartee over canasta among three Washington grandes dames and their pet gay playmate. Lynn (Kristin Scott Thomas), Natalie (Lauren Bacall) and Abigail (Lily Tomlin) constitute what may be the screen’s most formidable threesome of jaded, dirt-dishing socialites since “The Women.”  Ms. Bacall’s Natalie has the film’s toughest bons mots.  Marrying for money, she cracks in her brandied baritone, is the hardest job:  “You don’t get the money; you get to look at it.” Ms. Scott Thomas’s Lynn seethes with the chilled rage of a neglected wife. Ms. Tomlin’s gaunt, hollow-eyed Abigail personifies the political spouse as ferocious watchdog.  As the fourth card player, Carter Page III, the scion of a Virginia political dynasty that reached a pinnacle of respectability during the Watergate hearings, Woody Harrelson executes a spectacular pirouette away from his usual hot-wired renegades. Playing a bewigged, forked-tongue charmer drooling gossip inside this viper’s nest, he drops nuggets like his signature line, “I’m not naïve, I’m superficial,” in the languid, insinuating tone of a Southern courtier. Carter, who dabbles in real estate and decorating and favors too-tight double-breasted suits, relishes his role of “walker,” a platonic escort to the wives of boorish Washington power players who can’t be bothered to attend cultural and social functions.  If it is all overdone, that’s how Mr. Schrader likes his decadence; ripe and toxic, it seeps through the gold-trimmed furniture and into the water supply. Without being overtly political or naming names, “The Walker” portrays contemporary Washington as a cesspool of soullessness, hypocrisy, greed and antiquated social attitudes. Its brutal realpolitik is personified by Abigail’s husband, Jack Delorean (Ned Beatty), a greasy-haired fat cat and behind-the-scenes manipulator who will do whatever it takes to do whatever is necessary.  “The Walker” is the third part of Mr. Schrader’s so-called lonely man trilogy, which began in 1980 with “American Gigolo” and continued 12 years later with “Light Sleeper.” Carter is the spiritual descendant of Julian Kaye, the Hollywood stallion for hire played as a noble fool by Richard Gere in “Gigolo.” Both are innocents who fancy themselves sophisticates.  When scandal threatens to ruin the party at which their services come in handy, they are sacrificed to the wolves by their fancy, fair-weather friends. Carter’s self-defining slogan should be reversed to read: “I’m not superficial. I’m naïve.”  Like “American Gigolo,” “The Walker” unfortunately finds it necessary to attach a juicy social microcosm to a clunky mystery thriller whose antihero finds himself the chief suspect in a murder. Carter’s troubles begin when he chauffeurs Lynn, his closest friend among the card players and the wife of a senator, to the home of her lover (Steven Hartley), a financial wheeler-dealer.  While Carter loyally waits in the car to take her home, Lynn returns in great agitation, having found her boyfriend’s dead body on the living room floor. Fearful of a scandal, she refuses to report the crime and begs Carter to cover for her. He agrees and returns later to “discover” the body and contact the police.  Immediately he is the chief suspect, and already the film’s machinery has begun to creak. Carter is hounded by an ambitious district attorney (William Hope) and by a detective (Geff Francis) speaking tin-eared dialogue. A meeting between Carter and Lynn’s husband (an ill-used Willem Dafoe) is laughably sketchy.  The awkward scenes between Carter, who begins investigating the murder, and his German-Turkish lover Emek Yoglu (Moritz Bleibtreu), generate no emotional heat. A tabloid paparazzo who wants Carter to use his connections to help him break into art photography, Emek sleuths on his computer and unearths enough information to get himself followed to a gay bar and beaten up as a warning. The ominous gay-bar ambience feels about 30 years out of date, as do the  songs featuring the shivery voice of Bryan Ferry.  By the end of “The Walker” a movie that begins as a dazzling round of charades has deteriorated into a plodding game of Clue.  “The Walker” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity.

Paul Schrader's "The Walker" reworks one of his favorite plot tropes: the ne'er-do-well whose soul is purified in the heat of a murder investigation. Harrowed hero here is a gay Washington, D.C.-based gadabout (Woody Harrelson) who struggles to shield a friend from scandal. Although script sparkles with twinkly bon mots and cynical quips, pic's midsection feels a little flabby, as if the writer-helmer were just going through the motions. Still, even if this isn't Schrader's best, it's hardly his worst, and modestly budgeted pic should break even with limited release in urban burgs, performing marginally better abroad.
A scion of the Virginia gentry and the son of a late, highly respected liberal senator who took part in the Watergate hearings (as everyone keeps reminding him), Carter Page III (Harrelson) apparently lives off some kind of inheritance and dabbles in real estate. His real vocation is as a walker, a sort of unpaid escort (most definitely not the sexual kind) for the wives of rich and powerful men, squiring ladies to public events when their husbands aren't free or inclined to come.
Per press notes, term was originally coined to describe Jerry Zipkin, who "walked" Nancy Reagan and Betsy Bloomingdale among others and, like Carter here, held weekly canasta games at the height of his popularity where he and select femme friends would swap gossip.
Action opens at just such a canasta game in a private D.C. hotel room where Carter entertains his inner circle: grande dame Natalie Van Miter (Lauren Bacall, in great, queenly form), Abigail Delorean (Lily Tomlin, solid as ever) and Lynn Lockner (Kristin Scott Thomas, doing that brittle, haute-bourgeois siren schtick she does so well), all of them wives of either politicians or eminent lobbyists.
As opening shot swirls around room's tasteful murals, the camera not even showing any faces, dialogue suggests convincingly that although these ladies may spend most of their time lunching, their husbands didn't marry them for their looks alone. They're the politically savvy handmaidens of the elite who help stage-manage their husbands' careers, and Carter is their court jester.
He's closest to Lynn, whom he even once made a play for way back before coming out of the closet. They're such old friends now that he acts as lookout and alibi for her when she pays weekly visits to her lover, lobbyist Robbie Kononsberg (Steven Hartley). But one day, she comes back from Robbie's condo and tells Carter she found her lover stabbed to death. In order to protect Lynn and her senator husband Larry (Willem Dafoe) from impertinent questions, Carter offers to report the crime himself to the police.
When the investigation starts, and ambitious district attorney Mungo Tenant (William Hope) gets involved, Carter is hauled in for grilling. It seems someone has tipped them off already about Lynn's affair with Robbie, but Carter refuses to waver from his story that he found the body first, even if it makes him a suspect.
It emerges, via gossip at the canasta game, that Robbie was involved with an investment company that is about to be investigated for malfeasance (never quite explained), which would uncover all kinds of dirt about people in Carter's circle. The only way for Carter to protect Lynn and keep himself out of jail is to turn amateur investigator himself, helped by his loyal German-Turkish lover Emek (Moritz Bleibtreu), a tabloid paparazzo who wants to transition into gallery-based art photography and get Carter to settle down with him.
Plot parallels with Schrader's "American Gigolo" and "Light Sleeper" are obvious, but helmer also more subtly references his back catalog through James Merifield's production design, which makes ample use of Venetian blinds (a key noir-homage motif in "Gigolo"). A very "Gigolo"-esque montage lingers fetishistically over the hero's coiled ties and glinting cufflink collection as he undresses, climaxing with the removal of his wig revealing his bald pate, a brave moment for follicle-challenged star Harrelson that tenderly exposes the character's hidden, vulnerable self. Elsewhere, cantered camera angles invoke the woozy feel of camerawork in "Cat People" and some of the helmer's other pics.
Such self-homage is fun for Schrader fans, but what's missing here is the ambitious innovation, emotional ferocity and spiritual topnotes of the director at his best, on view in "Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" and more recently in his underrated minor masterpiece "Auto Focus," to say nothing of his scripts for Martin Scorsese. Plot's mystery MacGuffin hinders rather than enhances second act, right when Carter's world starts to frazzle and his relationship with Emek needs to be more fleshed out (perhaps literally -- character' passion for one another is incarnated in just one long but chaste-looking kiss through a wire fence).
Fortunately, strong ensemble compensates for film's minor shortcomings. Harrelson finds new ways of making smarm charm, his gestures and gait convincingly suggesting affected camp without slipping into caricature. His signature line, "I'm not naive, I'm superficial," nails the character beautifully.
Costume designer Nic Ede gets across Carter's slightly misjudged, Southern-style foppishness through the design of his oddly cut, shade-too-tight double-breasted suits, suggestive of hand-me-downs from Carter Page Sr. that don't quite fit.
Apart from location work in Washington, D.C., pic was largely shot in Blighty and on the Isle of Man, presumably for budgetary reasons, and it shows in the anonymous interiors that never look quite right as the playgrounds of America's super-elite. Otherwise, craft contributions are pro without being outstanding.

Paul Schrader 's cinema is largely defined by the pathology of his male protagonists, and with The Walker , he's added a striking new character to his gallery of loners.
Carter Page III (Woody Harrelson ) is the degenerate scion of a political family. Openly gay and eminently presentable, this American aristo makes himself useful as a companion to the neglected wives of the Washington elitegabbing over canasta or escorting them to the opera. (Hence the term "walker," coined to describe Nancy Reagan 's frequent squire Jerry Zipkin .) Cast against type, Harrelson rewards Schrader with a nuanced, if showy, performance, reveling in a Capote-like mush-mouthed drawl and flagging his sub-Capote bon mots  with insinuating hand gestures.
The Walker  evokes a town of mighty rubes and backbiting yentas (including heavy-hitters Lauren Bacall  and Lily Tomlin , both in fine grande dame fettle). Carter, however, has a special fondness for the vulnerable Lynn (Kristin Scott Thomas ), a sad-eyed lady of the lowlands, unhappily married to liberal senator Larry Lockner  (Willem Dafoe  with a Gary Hart  'do). Once Lynn discovers her lobbyist lover stabbed to death and gallant Carter puts down his copy of Suetonius to shield her, The Walker settles into thriller mode.
Carter is hauled into the U.S. Attorney's office for interrogation by a particularly nasty twerp (William Hope ). Meanwhile, the canasta crowd gossips about the murdersex or money? The third alternate, politics, goes unmentioned. Schrader has denied that The Walker  is a political film. However, it's not only political, it's nostalgic for politics. When his lawyer invokes the martyrdom of Susan McDougal , who spent two years in prison rather than inform on Bill Clinton , Carter expresses magnolia-scented melancholy: "That seems like another era."
Indeed. There are many references to Bush and more to the unnamed vice president who's the actual locus of clout. "It's a mean crowd, this administration," Carter muses. Iraq  is constantly on TV, and Carter's younger lover (German actor Moritz Bleibtreu , playing a German Turk) is an avant-garde painter who draws inspiration from Abu Ghraib . The Walker  reeks of the Patriot Act . "Don't fuck with the feds," Carter's lawyer warns. "After 9/11, they took the leash offthey do whatever they want." As with Brian De Palma  in Redacted , the movie-brat auteur can't resist drawing parallels between imperial Bushland and the America of his glory daysin this case, the Watergate era. Even more, however, Schrader wants to locate The Walker  in the context of his oeuvre.
Nothing if not self-conscious, Schrader habitually plants clues in his press notes, cuing reviewers to connect the dots. Note then that The Walker  reprises a sequence from American Gigolo  by lavishing close-ups on Carter's collection of cashmere sweaters, silk paisley ties, and tastefully bejeweled cuff links, while providing a new punch line when the dandy delicately removes his rug; a later montage quotes Light Sleeper , using an overhead camera to show Carter's nocturnal tossing and turning.
Thus, following Gigolo 's fastidious hustler and Sleeper 's ascetic drug dealer, Carter Page is another would-be variation on the protagonist of Bresson's Pickpocket , an isolated soul who finds redemption. (Given that The Walker  reiterates the conventional wisdom that the cover-up is worse than the crime, it might be that Schrader identifies with a certain form of amoral entertainer: gigolo, pusher, court jester. The filmmaker even supplies his own defense: "I'm not naive, I'm superficial," Carter declares in a line that's all but lit up in lights.)
Haunted by the specter of his senator father, an oft-declared "great man" and hero of the Watergate hearings whom Carter knows to have been a fraud, this protag appears to have a more complicated morality than his precursors. He's also a sadder case. Is Lynn using him? Could be. Are the cops planting evidence? Sure seems that way. Will he take the fall? Doesn't look like he's got much choice. As the pressure mounts, Carter's code of honor seems inexplicable, not least when he tells his boyfriend that, in their loyalty to Lynn, they are "ridiculous."
In its final third, The Walker  falls apart. Emotional murk rises, stakes are lowered, and, despite a late dose of Hardy Boys derring-do, drama founders. Confrontations with the ultimate D.C. fixer (Ned Beatty ) and the lady whose honor Carter protected fall flat, even as his redemption drops down from nowhere. This is a serious movie and, gliding around the center of power, a stylish one. But, like its protagonist, The Walker  is unable to close the deal.
