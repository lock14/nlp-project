         A documentary about a legendarily filthy joke, "The Aristocrats" consists of 87 minutes of riffing, joke analysis and reminiscences by a hundred or so well-known comedians, plus dozens of versions of the joke itself.
 
  Described by several comedians as the comedy equivalent of a Miles Davis riff, the joke, like the movie itself, wants to root around in the darkest, most twisted corners of comedians' minds as they consider the ever-shifting landscape of — it could be a Time magazine cover, actually — What's Shocking Now. Gilbert Gottfried uses it to soothe a prickly audience after telling a premature 9/11 joke at the Hugh Hefner Friars Club Roast. Later, a "South Park" clip incorporates 9/11 into the joke itself.
 


         






    The joke — here it is — is a rambling and entirely improvised porno-scatological ramble sandwiched between a never-changing set-up ("A guy walks into a talent agency and says, 'I've got a great family act for you,' ") and punch line ("That's some act," says the agent. "What do you call yourselves?" The man snaps a little flourish and says, "The Aristocrats!"). No one can quite agree on what the punch line means, or whether the humor is humanistic (the guy is so clueless he thinks his act is classy); satirical (the upper class can get away with anything); or absurdist. Some tell an inverted version of the joke, in which an absurdly genteel and boring bourgeois family act goes by a disgusting name.
 
  Shot by comedian Paul Provenza and comic-magician Penn Jillette on medium-grade video equipment, the film cuts together interviews with Robin Williams, Drew Carey, Gilbert Gottfried, Sarah Silverman and Paul Reiser, among many others, who extemporize on where they first heard it, what happened to them when they first heard it (Phyllis Diller fainted), what the rules of telling it are, what it means, how it works, and whether it's still shocking or was ever really funny in the first place. All of these questions are encapsulated in the main reason to see "The Aristocrats," the aforementioned "South Park" animation that features Cartman telling the joke his grandpa told him, Kyle, Kenny and Stan, while Kyle begs him to stop.
 
  Mainly, though, this "comedian secret handshake" and the most sustained in-joke ever (it's been around since vaudeville days and has been known to break the 90-minute mark) reveals more about the social dynamic of professional comics than it provides insight into the joke, which is pretty basic. There's something about professional comedians breaking down what's funny for civilians that gets annoying after a while. Maybe Provenza and Jillette could have let a little of the hot air out by making them all wear matching T-shirts with a logo like "We Know Funny" or something, I don't know. Actually, the whole thing reminded me of this joke my grandmother told me once: Two guys make a movie about a bunch of people who pounce on a joke and pick it apart, ignoring its pathetic pleas for mercy, until there's nothing left of it but a steaming pile of mangled entrails. What do they call it? The Comedians!

We live in a round-the-clock comedy culture, in which the trade secrets of professional joke tellers have long ago been dragged out of the closet. It's now an official cliché that humor is rooted in insecurity and pain, that comedy is aggression directed against the audience (the stand-up's infamous boast: ''I killed!''). But unless you dare to see the fascinating sick-joke documentary The Aristocrats , you may have no idea exactly how much the minds of comedians resemble those of serial killers, child molesters, and babies happily smearing their bassinet walls with poo. For this is a movie about the rudest, dirtiest secret in the world of comedy  a joke so vulgar and despicable that it is told only by comedians to other comedians, told late at night after the audiences have gone, told less as a joke than as a ritual, a bebop monologue of hideous kink, binding everyone who tells it or listens to it into an underground fraternity of forbidden laughter.
In The Aristocrats , we watch more than 100 different comedians, old and young, male and female, mainstream and cult, as they tell this joke, dissect it, meditate on it, recall anecdotes about it, and generally revel in the lurid, disgusting glory of its existence. The joke, incidentally, goes something like this: A man walks into an agent's office and says, ''Have I got an act for you!'' He then describes the act, which consists of a family of performers coming up on stage and engaging in a litany of unspeakable behavior  activities, left entirely up to the imagination of each joke teller, so gross and sadistic and perverted and horrific (not to mention criminal) that I would be hard-pressed to find euphemisms for most of them in this review. Incest, bodily excretions, rape, murder: They're all there, and all in good fun! The agent, nonplussed, then asks what the name of the act is. The answer: the Aristocrats.
It is, as more than one of the storytellers points out, a lousy joke  all lurid setup leading to an innocuous vaudeville whiff of a punchline. Yet the badness, in its way, is the point. Devoid of true wit, the joke is unabashedly a showcase for depravity, providing each comedian with a chance to unlock the outhouse of his or her fantasies. It's an Olympic contest of can you top this? George Carlin gets the ball rolling with a tale of vile human waste that may have you reaching for a barf bag, and the scatological dementia just escalates from there. If you thought that people like Paul Reiser and Drew Carey and Jason Alexander were mainstream clean, think again. There's an ingenious Martin Mull version, a splattery South Park  version, a pet-unfriendly mime version, and a rare public celebrity-roast version (featuring Gilbert Gottfried in full rasping cry). By the time the movie reaches the hidden sacrilege of Bob Saget, even he can't quite believe the things that are coming out of his mouth.
The Aristocrats  has a lot of laughs, but as it giggles and blasphemes its way into areas not so far removed from the scandalous landscape of the Marquis de Sade, the movie, funny as it is, becomes exhausting and a bit depressing. It's at once a comedy, a horror film, and a hilariously unsettling testament to the deepest reality of what comedians are: rim-shot madmen, driven to seek out and destroy all that's taboo. The joke, of course, is ultimately about them, our aristocrats of unhinged anarchy.

 "The Aristocrats" is - how shall I put it? - an essay film, a work of painstaking and penetrating scholarship, and, as such, one of the most original and rigorous pieces of criticism in any medium I have encountered in quite some time.  For those of you who have not already put down your newspaper and rushed off to buy tickets (and I hereby authorize the advertising department at ThinkFilm  to plaster the previous sentence wherever it likes), perhaps I should add that "The Aristocrats" is also possibly the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene documentary ever made. Visually, it is as tame as anything on PBS or VH1's "Behind the Music," but there is scarcely a minute of screen time that does not contain a reference to scatology, incest, bestiality and practices for which no euphemisms or Latinate names have been invented.  The film, made by Penn Jillette (the louder half of the Penn and Teller magic and comedy act) and Paul Provenza, who directs, is being released unrated, and one theater chain has already declined to book it, on the grounds that its appeal is too "narrow." That's one way of looking at it,  but surely there are few forms of expression more universal than the dirty joke. Those curious about why this should be so - why from a very early age we are prone to laugh at references to sex, excrement and other bodily activities - can of course consult sages like Henri Bergson, Sigmund Freud or the evocatively named Gershon Legman, author of the  two-volume "Rationale of the Dirty Joke." But none of these learned men are as funny as "The Aristocrats," or as revealing, through example and analysis, of the craft and tradition involved in what professional comedians call "working blue."  Mr. Jillette and Mr. Provenza start with a simple premise and a single joke, one that has a long and esoteric history going back to vaudeville days. The punch line is the title of the film, and the setup, which takes place in a talent booker's office, has a whiff of stale "Broadway Danny Rose" cigar smoke about it.  I won't say anything more, because I can't work blue in this room, and also because I don't want to spoil it. The point of the "aristocrats" joke, though, and of the movie, is that it can't really be spoiled, partly because it's so bad ("the opposite of a joke, really," one comedian muses) and partly because the humor resides in the delivery. While professional comedians rarely use it onstage - as George Carlin points out, most comedians don't really tell jokes onstage - they like to try out their own versions on one another, competing to see who can tell the dirtiest, most extreme, most shocking and longest version.  Through a series of interviews with an all-star cast of dozens of performers, television writers and other intellectuals - among the best known are Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Jon Stewart, Drew Carey and the animated boys of "South Park" - the filmmakers overturn two bits of received wisdom about humor. The first is that what is funny cannot be explained, the second that it dies by repetition. Indeed, the more you hear the joke - and you hear it, in bits and pieces and all the way through, at least 60 or 70 times - the deeper you appreciate its peculiar fascination. And as various comedians reflect on its meaning and history - Mr. Carlin is particularly thoughtful in this regard - you come to understand the codes and customs of that peculiar guild that makes a living by trying to make the rest of us laugh.  Along the way you learn something about the history of American comedy. Chris Rock explains that in the old days, raunchiness was not as much of a taboo for black comedians because they were excluded from television and mainstream theaters and clubs.  Phyllis Diller, for her part, maintains that the first time she heard the joke she fainted, and that it was generally not the kind of humor a woman would indulge in. This notion is challenged by Lisa Lampanelli and brilliantly subverted by Sarah Silverman, who gives the joke its creepiest, funniest inflection by pretending that it isn't a joke at all.  And while "The Aristocrats" is full of howlingly funny moments - Kevin Pollak blending the joke with a Christopher Walken impression; Paul Reiser, Gilbert Gottfried and Bob Saget (yes, him) turning in notably disgusting renditions - it works on the mind as well as the funny bone and the gag reflex. It makes you reflect on the mysteries of timing, context and delivery, those aspects of discipline that make comedy an art and separate the pros from the cocktail-party bores. It also takes you deep into the land of the id, not just of individual comedians (some of whom have pretty scary ids), but also into that murky collective terrain of desire, regression and fear where we all started out and where a few brave souls remain to make a living.

The so-called "dirtiest joke in the world" gets told to a fare-thee-well in "The Aristocrats," a raucous insider docu that invites the viewer to share a secret held exclusively by comics for untold generations. More than 100 entertainers relate the joke or aspects of it, explain its private history, comment on its variations and rate renditions of it for fellow funnymen Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette. What cascades forth here for an hour-and-a-half couldn't be verbally filthier, meaning that some prospective audiences will be offended; but most will be amused by this unique, star-laden homemovie. Commercial prospects are iffy to OK for limited theatrical release, but quite bright indeed in cable and sell-through markets.
Joke in question is one known in comedy circles at least since vaudeville days but never told in public. Without spoiling it, tale has a simple set-up and a clean, satisfying but hardly uproarious punchline. But as everyone points out, it's the "middle" that counts. "It's a blank slate and you get to play," advises George Carlin, and many compare the wide-open opportunity offered by the joke's format to jazz, with its invitation to improvise and riff to the artist's content.
What the set-up provides, in fact, is the chance to spin a tale of debauchery to put Boccacchio, the Marquis de Sade and the combined exertions of John C. Holmes and Jenna Jameson to shame; the further you carry it, the more depraved and original your slant, the more successful the telling. Versions that take wing and acquire a life of their own can easily last a half-hour, and the ability to relate it in a way that makes other comedians crack up stands as a test of any stand-up's talent.
Bob Saget, not publicly known as a dirty-mouth, proves he's actually a brilliant one in an extended seg, and Whoopi Goldberg makes the valid point that racial humor has now become more of a flashpoint than sexual outrageousness. The most original contributions are made by Billy the Mime, who manages to relate the essence of the joke without a word, and especially by sleight-of-hand master Eric Mead, who loads a series of card tricks with dizzyingly lurid innuendo.
But the star of this smut-off is unquestionably Gilbert Gottfried. Raspy-voiced comic raises scabrous invective to new lows of sustained bedazzlement, both in straight-to-camera comments and, especially, in a tape made at a private roast of Hugh Hefner that's rightly saved for the docu's climax. Gottfried's ever-escalating ferociousness is enough to reduce even heard-it-all audiences to helpless tears of laughter.
No doubt only fellow comics could have induced so many jokesters to let down their guard and participate in such a project. While the lineup of talent is undeniably impressive, most of the comedians are middle-aged types with similar perspectives. The old guard is sorely missed, and one regrets the absence of such giants as Buddy Hackett, Milton Berle, Rodney Dangerfield, Red Buttons, Henny Youngman and others, many of whom are now gone but were still alive when the picture went into production four years ago.
Provenza and Jillette grabbed their interview sessions on the run with hand-held consumer video equipment, and, while some of the lensing is less than professional, this is a small price to pay for the access obtained. Editing is snappy, and IDs of the participants are thoughtfully provided at the end.

Going deep inside the improvisers' studio, The Aristocrats  examines the timeless appeal of a notorious vaudeville jokea kind of "secret handshake" among comedians. The so-called "aristocrats" routine suggests Catskills  by way of Andrew Dice Clay : A man strolls into a talent office saying he's got a show that'll knock 'em dead. He proceeds to tell the agent about his act, the world's most depraved, obscene family revueinvolving shitting, incest, you name itand starring his own family. "Whaddaya call it?" the agent asks. The man replies, "The Aristocrats."
The punchline, of course, is a red herring. What matters is the description of the revue, a blank canvas that each fabulist is encouraged to douse with as much smut as possible. "I think you can put people to death for what happens in the best versions of this joke," quips Jake Johannsen , one of more than 100 comedians featured in the film. Director Paul Provenza  and his collaborator, Penn (of Penn & Teller) Jillette, set out to prove what's already evident: that each comic puts a personal stamp on the material, spinning a fundamentally hollow gag into ostensible gold. "You gotta save the scatological for the end," Paul Reiser  informs us, rating diarrhea as more shocking than intra-familial blowjobs. (A typical "aristocrats" recitation would involve both.) Chevy Chase apparently held parties where the goal was to stretch the joke past 30 minutes. Simpsons  writer Dana Gould  claims to have once drawn it out for two and a half hoursincluding mentions of white slavery and zeppelin crashesonly to flub the final word.
Virtually structureless, The Aristocrats  finds an apex in Gilbert Gottfried 's performance at a September 2001 Friars' Club roast, where the screechy comedian ad-libbed an "aristocrats" delivery after his attempt at early 9-11 humor fell disastrously flat. Despite much conjecture about why the joke has enduredthe movie deploys George Carlin  as the stand-up-comic equivalent of Mark Shields The Aristocrats  is most enjoyable as a series of riffs. Reminding us that he used to be on Full House  , Bob Saget  unfolds a variation that features "projectile shit." Thinking outside the box, Kevin Pollak  does his version in the voice of Christopher Walken . Whoopi Goldberg , one of several comediennes who talk about the difference between male and female renditions, devises unspeakable uses for foreskin. With Robin Williams , Jon Stewart , Sarah Silverman , Eric Cartman  (in an animated segment), and the staff of The Onion  treated as almost incidental presences, The Aristocrats  is a veritable talent show itself, albeit one that feels inescapably slight. To rejigger another ancient joke: The food at this place isn't terrible. But the portions are really small.
