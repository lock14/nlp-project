The new Woody Allen movie, Melinda and Melinda , is not a work of science fiction, yet there are moments when you may think you've slipped through a verbal-sociological time warp. Who are these men and women in their late 20s and early 30s nattering about Stravinsky and Bartók (''I find the more turbulent parts a little scary!''), about the Nuremberg trials, about the act they persist in referring to as ''making love''? Allen, who is often chided for creating a lily-white Upper East Side universe, now features a prominent African-American character, yet you wish he wasn't a refined classical musician who has to say ''I'm from Harlem, USA!'' At one point, a flip reference is made to the ''personal columns,'' a phrase I don't think I've heard in a decade. Doesn't Allen know that the Internet has not only revolutionized the way that people advertise for someone to, uh...make love with but eliminated the stigma of it?
The hermetic, ''neurotic,'' high-culture Manhattan of Melinda and Melinda  no longer looks or sounds like the real world; it's a synthetic patchwork of the world of old Woody Allen films. In alternating scenes, Allen creates two versions of the same story, one comic, the other tragic, and what's odd is that the difference doesn't mean anything: In each version, everyone speaks in the same coyly overemphatic Allen-ese. Yet if he now possesses an official tin ear for the rhythms and references of American urban life, Allen has by no means lost his craft, his ability to spin out a romantic scenario of adultery and heartbreak so you stay with it.
The best reason to see Melinda and Melinda  is Radha Mitchell, who has her grabbiest role (or two of them) since she broke through with High Art  (1998). In each version, she's Melinda, a troubled young woman who splashes, uninvited, into a dinner party. The tragic section casts her as a former school chum of two of the women there, and in the comic version she's a stranger  a luminous wreck who has just popped 28 sleeping pills. In each episode, she is rescued, or so it seems, by  a love affair but mooned over by someone else; the effect is Hannah Lite, with a touch (in the downbeat version) of Crimes and Misdemeanors . Mitchell, the rare beauty who doesn't act behind a screen of self-possession, lends urgency to the drama of someone coming apart, and she's moving in her romance with a suave, subtly duplicitous musician (Chiwetel Ejiofor, the superb Nigerian  actor from Dirty Pretty Things ).
In the lighter episode, Melinda is chased by the earnest, dorky Hobie, a bad actor trapped in a passionless marriage. He's played by Will Ferrell, who does a riff on Woody's anachronistically nervous, cough-out-a-punchline shtick without embarrassing himself the way that Kenneth Branagh did. Yet Ferrell doesn't put his stamp on the role, either. Except for Mitchell, no one in Melinda and Melinda  does. The roster of offbeat actors (Chloë Sevigny, etc.) are dangling from strings, with a puppet master who needs to muss up his art and stop looking backward.

he new Woody Allen movie, "Melinda and Melinda," is framed, somewhat in the manner of "Broadway Danny Rose," by table talk. Lingering over dinner at Pastis, four marvelously articulate New Yorkers debate the interpretation of an anecdote, unheard by the audience, involving an unhappy young woman named Melinda. Two of the diners happen to be playwrights - perhaps the only two left in New York who could afford to eat at such a restaurant, but never mind - and one of them, a maker of serious dramas (Larry Pine) sees the story as a tragedy, while the other, a cherubic author of comedies (Wallace Shawn), claims it for his own preferred genre. That the tragedian turns out to have a sunnier view of life than his colleague is part of the film's point: in life and in art, funny often keeps close company with sad, to the extent that it is sometimes hard to distinguish one from the other. Mr. Allen does not make it much easier. As he interweaves two versions of the Melinda story, one meant to be bathed in pathos, the other sprinkled with whimsy, it becomes apparent that his notions of comedy and tragedy do not quite correspond either to scholarly dogma or to everyday usage. You might, for instance, expect the tragic tale to purge your unruly emotions through pity and terror, rather than through bafflement and ennui. You might also expect the comic half of the movie to be funny, in which case the joke is on you. The link between the two asymmetrical stories is Radha Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both, surrounded in each case by a different supporting cast. The distinction between comedy and tragedy comes down, ultimately, to her: if she is wild-haired, fretfully smoking and overacting like a contestant in the Jennifer Jason Leigh category on "American Idol," then it must be tragedy. If, on the other hand, her hair is neatly bobbed and her manner ingenue-fresh, then comedy is the name of the game. In both renderings, she crashes a dinner party with an air of distress and a tale of woe, and her arrival sets off a chain of marital misunderstanding and emotional collision that swirls through subsequent parties and further dinners in charming Manhattan restaurants. The tragic Melinda barges in on some old friends - Laurel (Chlo� Sevigny), a Park Avenue trust-fund baby, and her husband, Lee (Jonny Lee Miller), an intermittently employed actor with a bit of a drinking problem. This Melinda arrives demanding single malt Scotch and brandishing a florid life story that includes a bitter divorce, an unhappy love affair and a suicide attempt. (An even darker chapter is revealed later on.) Her comic counterpart, whose misery is less Gothic, lives downstairs from another couple, an intermittently employed actor named Hobie (Will Ferrell) and his wife, Susan (Amanda Peet), an independent filmmaker. In both scenarios, Melinda's presence stirs up latent instabilities within her friends' marriages and causes some upheaval in their social and professional lives. Not that the two plots are exactly parallel, though they are connected by ingeniously placed details and motifs. In the comedy, Hobie falls in love with Melinda, while in the tragedy she and Laurel become rivals for the affections of a gallant pianist and composer with the extraordinary name of Ellis Moonsong, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Love, Actually," "Dirty Pretty Things"). Mr. Ejiofor's presence, along with that of Daniel Sunjata in a smaller, similar role in the film's comic half, is perhaps the biggest shock in "Melinda and Melinda." In the fifth decade of his career as a New York filmmaker, Mr. Allen has written not one but two black characters into a movie, without sensationalism or stereotyping. Better late than never, I suppose. In every other respect, though, Mr. Allen's Manhattan remains a fantasy world, which is both a serious limitation and a minor source of delight. By now, there is nothing to be gained from complaining about the inaccuracies and anachronisms that color his view of the city or the strange, stilted idioms its inhabitants use in his films. It is better to appreciate him as a kind of preservationist, carefully restoring a cultural niche where the hectic elegance of old studio comedies and serious Broadway plays might still flourish amid the vulgar madcap of the 21st-century metropolis. "Melinda and Melinda" is perhaps best thought of as an offering to the memories of Ernst Lubitsch and George S. Kaufman, half-forgotten culture heroes whose examples of crisp sophistication deserve to be kept alive for future generations. Mr. Allen pries his actors away from their naturalistic habits, evoking a pre-Method style of performance that has all but vanished from the modern stage and screen. The results are mixed. Ms. Sevigny, Mr. Ejiofor and Ms. Peet seem liberated, freed of the necessity to plumb psychological depths and able to explore behavior rather than motive. Mr. Miller, struggling with an underwritten part and a badly fitting accent, has a harder time, as does Mr. Ferrell, who is miscast in the Woody Allen surrogate role of soulful schlemiel. Mr. Ferrell, with his large, shambling body and bland features, is hardly the ideal mouthpiece for the jittery, hostile one-liners that afflict Mr. Allen's writing like a tic. Coming into a pretentiously decorated vacation house in the Hamptons, Mr. Ferrell seems much more likely to trip over the furniture than to insult it, and Mr. Allen grudgingly allows him a single moment of physical comedy, involving a bathrobe that gets stuck in a door. Which brings me to the real reason to appreciate Mr. Allen, which is as an unrivaled pornographer. I'm not talking about sex; there is some bed-hopping in "Melinda and Melinda," but the camera always stops at the bedroom door. These days, in any case, the kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes. To make the fantasy even more delicious and indecent, these apartments are inhabited by struggling actors, filmmakers and musicians who amusingly complain about being broke when the combined market value of their property could finance another installation of "The Gates." Which is, come to think of it, both funny and sad. "Melinda and Melinda" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many sexual references and situations, and some off-color language.

Representing a return to form for Woody Allen after a trio of slighter works, "Melinda and Melinda" juggles comedy and tragedy in two alternating stories about the same young woman struggling to straighten out her seriously messsed-up life. The sensitive dual female role for femme lead Radha Mitchell stirs memories of complex Allen heroines from Annie Hall on down, even if the action is dispersed via a larger ensemble cast which he currently favors. His consummate ease with the genre is pleasure to watch, but a certain difficulty in keeping the twin tales straight could hold back the film's otherwise bright B.O. prospects to within the norm of Allen's recent features. 
Over a friendly meal in a Chinese restaurant, Sy (Wallace Shawn) poses a conundrum to his fellow diners: Is the essence of life comic or tragic? For the sake of argument, he tells the bare bones of a story, which the others then embellish to illustrate their takes on life.
The story starts as follows: An ambitious young Manhattan couple, Park Avenue princess Laurel (Chloe Sevigny) and tippling actor Lee (Jonny Lee Miller), are throwing a dinner party to impress Lee's would-be producer when suddenly the doorbell rings and their long-lost friend Melinda (Radha Mitchell) appears, bedraggled and woebegone.
In the tragic version of what happens next, the beautiful intruder -- made up to look like a sexy, latter-day Kim Novak -- is a disturbed woman who got bored with her Midwestern doctor-husband and dumped him for a photographer. Her husband took the children away and she spiraled into a suicidal depression that landed her straight-jacketed in a mental ward.
Melinda is a college friend of both Laurel. Drinking and pill-popping, she moves in with Laurel and Lee over the latter's grumbling while she tries to meet the right man who will sort out her life.
In the comic version, Melinda (toned down for a girl-next-door look) is childless and a downstairs neighbor to the dinner hosts, who are ambitious indie filmmaker Susan (Amanda Peet) and under-employed actor Hobie (Will Ferrell, a deadpan alter ego for Allen himself). Bursting in on the party with a fainting fit, this Melinda develops into Hobie's unconfessed love interest even while Susan is setting her up with a rich, good-looking dentist.
Back and forth the stories go, contrasting the destinies of the two Melindas. The tragic one rejects a nice widowed dentist to whom she's introduced and instead falls hard for another wrong man, one Ellis Moonsong of Harlem (the charming Chiwetel Ejiofor), a handsome piano player and opera composer. On the same day that she learns she'll never see her children again, she finds out Ellis is two-timing her with Laurel, whose marriage to Lee has meanwhile fallen apart. She is devastated. Yet even in the midst of her travails, Mitchell brings out the humor in her self-preoccupied character, by far the more memorable of her two Melindas.
Fate deals a better hand to the comic Melinda and offers the audience more chance to laugh at Hobie's clumsy attempts first to hide his feelings and then, after discovering wife Susan in the sack with a friend, to joyfully declare them. As in all well-written comedies, obstacles keep cropping up that keep the would-be pair separated, but a de rigeur happy ending puts a satisfying cap on the tale.
As different as the versions are -- and Allen does return to Sy's story-telling group a few times to remind us where this outlandish fiction is all coming from -- they have some very confusing overlaps which sidetrack the entertainment while viewers work to keep the characters straight. This problem seems inherent in the film's key point: namely, that life's comedy and tragedy are inexplicably interwoven or, as one character puts it, our tears of joy and tears of sorrow are one and the same. The bottom line is it's hard to remember which story we're watching.
Though he never appears on-screen, Allen is constantly present in the stagy, ironic Manhattan dialogue, which sounds like he's doing the talking no matter what character mouths it. This makes for a quick-moving script and characters defined by their actions, not their words. Oddly lacking are the breezy gags and laugh-out-loud one-liners of classic Woody, though the multiple-character situations furnish ample smiles. Happily film ends on its best joke, a startling moment of filmmaking inspiration that sends the audience home laughing.
While sultry-soapy Mitchell steals the spotlight in the juicy title roles, Sevigny makes a notable contribution in illustrating the anxious, self-doubting side of a woman whose life revolves around shopping and lunch. Ferrell, though a lot taller, sticks close to Woody's own film persona and reaps the benefits.
Keeping up with Allen's wide-ranging cultural interests from Chekhov to Cole Porter, Vilmos Zsigmond brings an eclectic note to the lensing with a lot of in-jokes of his own, like the film noir lighting of the tragic story's denouement. As usual, a predominantly jazz sound sets the scene.

Less a return to form than a return to formalism, Woody Allen 's 35th feature finds him happily at play in the house of fiction. Melinda  and Melinda  is predicated on kind of a kindergarten Jacques Rivette  or Raul Ruiz  conceit; it's a tricksy narrative that doesn't work too hard on its contrivances but (to be fair) doesn't expect too much from you either.
Events are set in motion one rainy night in a cozy Village boîte with Wally Shawn  enthusiastically holding forth on the nature of comedy. After another writer at the table disputes Shawn's garrulous theorizing, a third member of their amiable party recounts the tale of a young woman whose surprise appearance disrupted another, no less strenuously sophisticated Manhattan gathering, and challenges them to determine whether her story is comedy or tragedy. This self-reflexive setup enables the entwined alternate-universe adventures of Melinda and Melinda, both played by Radha Mitchell whose attractively stressed-out performance is the movie's most convincing aspect. (As Lou Christieor was it Klaus Nomi ?once trilled, "Two faces have I, one to laugh and one to cry.
Tragic Melinda makes her appearance in a downtown loft belonging to her old college friends, an unsuccessful actor (Jonny Lee Miller ) and his Park Avenue wife (Chloë Sevigny ). The less dramatically coiffed Comic Melinda haunts the Upper East Side and harasses a new cast of characters; she's the ditzy neighbor to another struggling actor (Will Ferrell ) and his high-powered wife (Amanda Peet ). That the latter is the would-be director of an independent movie named The Castration Sonata  is a clue, as if one were really needed, that the ungainly Farrell is playing the Woody character.
The two-track narrative proceeds smoothly enough, albeit with too few corresponding incidents. Both stories feature a day at the races and a resident dentist. Drinking serves as a narrative lubricant throughout. Drama is predicated on the bourgeois tragedyor is it the bedroom farceof unfaithful spouses, as well as both Melindas' various liaisons (in both cases spurning dentists in favor of musicians). But this parallelism is ultimately arbitrary. Allen's undisciplined sense of analogy results in an asymmetric set of romantic triangles suggesting that it is the presence of the Woody character that insures a comic reading. Neither comedy nor tragedy, the movie is closest to genteel soap opera. There are moments when Melinda and Melinda  is a parlor trick, as worn and familiar as the magic lamp that serves a different purpose in each story.
