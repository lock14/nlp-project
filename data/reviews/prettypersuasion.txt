         There's a scene in "Pretty Persuasion," Marcos Siega's broad swipe at high school, the entertainment industry, racism, dog love, local news, bad parenting and pretty much you name it, in which a teacher berates a student while standing in front of a chalkboard with the definition of "satire" written on it. "Irony, sarcasm or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice or stupidity," it reads, even though by then the movie is too neck-deep in cheap psychology to qualify.
 
  The bit with the chalkboard is intended as a wink to the audience, but it's more like the dramatic equivalent of serving guests a culinary failure alongside the picture-perfect magazine photo of the dish that inspired it. It's too bad that the satire is not more pointed, because "Pretty Persuasion" is outrageously funny in short blasts, mainly thanks to James Woods at his most gleefully depraved.
 


         






    Screenwriter Skander Hadim descends on his characters with all the avenging fury a baby cynic can muster, and erstwhile music video director Siega renders them in a stylish pop-Goth way that's all form, no discernible function. The movie begins at an audition (where else?), as rows of cantilevered aspiring Jessica Albas await their chance to writhe and swirl like soft-serve ice cream in front of a team of producers of a show called "Dysfunction." Cool and beautiful 15-year-old Kimberly Joyce (Evan Rachel Wood) delivers a creditable bad-sitcom version of a sexy French exchange student, then goes back to school at the prestigious Roxbury Academy in Beverly Hills, a gloomy monument to privilege where the very rich pay top dollar to dump their unloved kids.
 
  Kimberly, whose home life makes "Mommy Dearest" look like a child-rearing manual, has taken a new Palestinian student, Randa (Adi Schnall) under her wing, instructing her on the finer points of popularity, celebrity, sex, bulimia and which ethnicities are most likely to succeed in the entertainment industry. Last on her list, "no offense, is Arab." People are too prejudiced against them, she says. Then she tells an off-color racist joke to illustrate her point.
 
  "It starts with the parents," the school's squirrelly principal is fond of saying. And Kimberly's dad Henry (Woods), an anti-Semitic pig-on-wheels who spends his days roaming his slovenly lair in his underwear and bathrobe like an unkempt Hugh Hefner, is the type who conducts business on the phone between phone sex and cocaine breaks. Absentee mom misspells Kimberly's name and gets her age wrong on a birthday card. Stepmom is a human Barbie doll.
 
  With such a family, in a school run by cynics and perverts and in a city where, by the movie's lights, even winding up on the local news for perjury counts as heat, it's no surprise that Kimberly soon devises a splashy way to lash out. Enlisting Randa and Brittany (Elisabeth Harnois) to back her, she trumps up a sexual harassment charge against their English and drama teacher, Percy Anderson (Ron Livingston), whose not being guilty doesn't exactly make him innocent. Seething at an assignment to do a fluff piece on the school, local news reporter Emily (Jane Krakowski) sleazily pounces on the story as a way to advance her career.
 
  What differentiates the filmmakers from Emily, of course, is their blanket disdain for everything and everyone in the film, including its tragic victim. Their scorn may set them apart from their characters, but it hardly elevates them — or the movie. "Pretty Persuasion" is too flip to be serious and too smug to be rousing. And by the time we get around to the big reveal, which feels shoe-horned into the ending, the idea that a puppet master like Kimberly would expend her considerable gifts on the most banal of high school dramas feels ludicrous.
 
  Wood is an intelligent actress, and her canniness emanates like a hard light, but the cynicism rubs off on her, making her vulnerable moments look like the virtuosic performances they are, rather than real emotions. Is she a victim or a perpetrator? Bright, slick and exploitative, "Pretty Persuasion" wants it both ways. Not pretty we can handle. Not persuasive is another thing altogether.

Pretty Persuasion  stars the intriguing, deceptively dewy-looking Evan Rachel Wood of Thirteen  and The Upside of Anger  as Kimberly, a vixenish 15-year-old who stirs up dangerous mischief at an affluent high school when she frames a teacher (Ron Livingston) for sexual harassment. But it's not Wood who personifies the repellent tone of this childishly coarse little scorched-earth satire on a theme of high school imitates life. Rather it's Woods  James Woods. As Kimberly's father, a limitlessly vulgar man obsessed with drugs, porn, and the pursuit of bigotry, Woods throws himself into the job of looking and acting disgusting with such excessive abandon that his every scene leaves stink marks.
Actually, each character is a lousy joke in this cynical, eager-to-shock Sundance indie (directed by music-video guy Marcos Siega from a script by Skander Halim). The movie wears its notion of incorrectness with a smirk, ignorant of how unearned that smugness is. Among the easy targets  the only kind the filmmakers can spot  are a pea-brained student acolyte (Elisabeth Harnois) and her clueless Arab-American classmate (Adi Schnall), both of whom back Kimberly's accusation. And, naturally, the media comes in for cheap mockery, in the form of an ambitious local TV reporter (Jane Krakowski) who sees the scandalous sex-charge-in-a-high-school story as a ticket to career advancement.
But Woods' papa-don't-preach is the lousiest gag of all, symbolic of everything obnoxiously out of proportion and unpersuasive about Pretty Persuasion . The movie wants so badly to be mentioned in the same breath as Heathers  or Election  that it's not even funny. Really, I mean it, this charred-black comedy is not even funny.

 Kimberly Joyce (Evan Rachel Wood), the smirking 15-year-old alpha girl who spins a toxic web of lies and deceit in "Pretty Persuasion," is a screen monster worthy to stand beside Suzanne Stone, Nicole Kidman's fame-obsessed television weather reporter in "To Die For."  Kimberly's father, Hank (James Woods), is a wealthy, foul-mouthed Beverly Hills electronics magnate in a perpetual rage, whose spewing of vicious ethnic and sexual epithets between snorts of cocaine suggests the onset of Tourette's syndrome. As they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  In her upscale private high school, situated in the 90210 ZIP code that everyone loves to hate, Kimberly glides through the corridors like a malignant princess, oozing contempt as she tosses poisoned roses to her courtiers. Early in the film, she remarks that there are just too many "worthless, annoying people on this planet," and she means it.  An obscene, misanthropic go-for-broke satire, "Pretty Persuasion" is so gleefully nasty that the fact that it was even  made and released is astonishing. Much of it is also extremely funny. Any satire worth its salt should not be afraid to offend, and "Pretty Persuasion" flings mud in all directions with a fearless audacity. As its bilious vision splatters across the screen from a hot center of disgust, the high school becomes the movie's symbol of a culture submerged in an acid bath of celebrity worship, envy, greed, material obsession and vengeful selfishness.  The satire can be recklessly excessive. In the movie's zeal to cover all bases, it even brings in the war in Iraq, in which Kimberly's older brother was killed, and which she refers to as "Operation Iraqi Freedom" with a venomous sarcasm. Later, when confronted with the pain she has caused, she dismisses the accusation with a shrug and remarks, "Every war has its casualties."  Kimberly loathes her new stepmother (Jaime King), whom she accuses of sleeping with the family dog. After eavesdropping on Hank having phone sex, she mockingly repeats the smutty dialogue to his face. At school, she is flanked by two sidekicks, the air-headed Brittany (Elisabeth Harnois), who thinks the word podiatrist means pedophile, and Randa (Adi Schnall), a shy Middle Eastern student whom she introduces to pornography and teaches how to purge.  "I respect all races but I'm glad to be white," Kimberly announces airily. She goes on to rank the races according to personal preference and then tosses off a dirty joke about how Arab women become pregnant.  The film's ingenious, far-fetched plot revolves around the touchy subject of sexual harassment in the classroom. For reasons that are revealed only in the film's final minutes, Kimberly persuades Brittany and Randa to join her in lodging false complaints of sexual abuse against their English and drama teacher, Percy Anderson (Ron Livingston). All three girls have personal axes to grind, but their grievances stem from his ego-wounding remarks, not from any boundary-breaking intimacy.  Technically, Percy may be innocent, but in his heart he's not. Although the movie makes it clear that he would never molest a student, his fantasies are another matter. In one of the funniest scenes, he buys his wife, Grace (Selma Blair), a short gray skirt for her birthday that is identical to the girls' school uniforms. After cajoling her into putting it on, he persuades his wife to writhe in front of him like a teenage temptress and to put on a sexy voice and read a provocative essay on discipline that Kimberly wrote during detention.  The scandal Kimberly sets in motion comes right on the heels of a Columbine-like massacre at another school in nearby Bel Air. A planned television puff piece on Kimberly's school suddenly becomes a tabloid news feature pursued by a fame-hungry reporter, Emily Klein (Jane Krakowski). A stand-in for every preening, self-righteous bimbo in the infotainment business, Emily happens to be a lesbian. When the scandal breaks, she becomes Kimberly's biggest champion as well as her latest conquest in the girl's lengthening list of people seduced as part of her nefarious master plan for glory and revenge.  Ms. Wood, who made a memorable debut in "Thirteen" as a girl going wild, brings an icy poise to her role that is entirely convincing and a little unnerving. Now that Christina Ricci has outgrown her niche as Hollywood's ranking bad girl, Ms. Wood has the field all to herself, and she holds it with an imperial command.  "Pretty Persuasion" was directed by Marcos Siega (who has a music-video background) from a screenplay by Skander Halim. Visually it has the deceptively bright pop gloss of products like "American Pie" or "Wedding Crashers," which are much less cutting-edge. The movie doesn't go soft until the confusing final minute; in that minute, you wish it had kept its heart in the freezer.  Watching "Pretty Persuasion" is like passing through a sudden, violent thunderstorm; behind it, the air is fragrant, and the visibility extends to the horizon. Think of the movie as a clearing shower.
A high school send-up more gleefully incorrect than Heathers  and considerably less articulate than Election , Pretty Persuasion  is a hand grenade lobbed at no place in particular. After being fired from her role as Anne Frank  in the school play, Kimberly (Evan Rachel Wood ) enlists her friends to corroborate a false sexual assault claim against their drama teacher (Ron Livingston ). Preposterously, she plans to leverage her ensuing fame into TV stardom (as opposed to recurring appearances in the New York Post  ?). Spectators view the case with a similar amount of cynicism, from Kimberly's slur-spouting, womanizing dad (James Woods ) to an ambitious news reporter (Jane Krakowski ) to the accused's wife (Selma Blair ), weary of her husband's very real fantasies about his students.
Everyone's a hypocritea lesson the filmmakers could easily extend to themselves. Much as it wants to be a satire (smugly self-aware, the movie posts a definition of the term on a blackboard), Pretty Persuasion  is at heart an exploitation film. It revels in the shock value of, say, an Arab girl (Adi Schnall ) watching Titty Lickers 2  and asking questions about anal sex, but never unites its targets into anything resembling a statement. Writer Skander Halim distributes his disdain evenly, at least until he makes a bizarre plea for sympathy in the final minutes. Ostensibly a critique of intolerance, the movie invites chuckling at a wheelchair-bound prosecutor (or at least scolds its audience for thinking the handicap incongruous) and is in fact predicated on a streak of misogyny. For girls, one teacher says, "High school is all Cockteasing 101." Marcos Siega 's direction is alternately shrill and listless; indeed, Wood mutters most of her Clueless -style tour of the school's cliques. Offhand references to metal detectors, the war in Iraq , and the Israel -Palestine  conflict exist to provide topicalitywhich only makes the film seem more timid for not taking a stand. Comedy is hard; contempt is easy. Or as the movie's Columbine  gunman says, "Just like shooting ducks in a carnival."
