'Taken"? You bet. Eurobaddies abduct Liam Neeson's teen daughter, and Neeson, playing a one-man gang called Bryan Mills, moves heaven and earth - OK, he just destroys a lot of property - to get her back. But that title is more about abducted movie plots. The prurient underworld shock of "Hardcore"? Taken. The Parisian pot-boiling of "Frantic"? Taken. The comical seriousness of "The Bodyguard"? Taken. The overall Van Dammage? Taken.
Perhaps Neeson is eager to add his name to the list of men who pummel. And I suppose he has. (Look out, Jason Statham. There's a taller sheriff in town.) Neeson breaks necks, karate-chops men unconscious (that move still works!), and foot-chases speeding cars, but with a depressing lack of style. He's a killing machine whose setting stays locked on "Harrison Ford Is Sleeping."
"Taken" begins in crass manipulation. Bryan quits the CIA to live near his estranged 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace) after years of clandestine government missions. He's making up for lost time but can't compete with her stepdad's largesse. Real Dad brings a karaoke set to his little girl's 17th birthday blowout. Stepdad (Xander Berkeley) lavishes her with a horse. And Mom (Famke Janssen, brittle) savors her ex's humiliation. But when Bryan listens via cell as men snatch his vacuous pogo-stick of a child in Paris then springs to action, we get it. Let's see Stepdad top this!
Neeson applies as much professionalism as he can while amassing quite a body count. This only redoubles the ridiculousness. No one has told him he's standing in a toilet. This can be fun, as when Bryan escapes certain death with the help of a steam pipe and a fire extinguisher, or when he accepts the business card of a pop star (the card reads "Sheerah") whose life he saves. But it's not Neeson's talent we're meant to appreciate. It's his fitness and the absurdly lethal ends to which it's put.
This is another unsavory mix of sentimentality and high-octane seediness from the Luc Besson factory. Pierre Morel, a Besson disciple, directed from a script Besson wrote with Robert Mark Kamen, who shared credit with Besson on "The Fifth Element" and two "Transporter" movies. In addition to everything else, "Taken" could also be another installment in that series.
A rotten whiff of pleasure wafts through "Taken." You want to see Bryan on the warpath. But when he's not killing everybody, he's such a pathetic character. The man whose spy buddies unload exposition about how he used to be the baddest of the bad ("Remember that time with Hezbollah!") now anticipates his daughter's calls like someone waiting for a second date. Dude, she's just not that into you.
Of course, being sold into sexual slavery has a way of changing all that. It's easier to think of "Taken" as "Revenge of the Non-Custodial Parent," for it feels guided by the hands of men who've signed their share of child-support checks. This might explain why the ex-wife is so one-dimensionally bilious and the daughter a half-dimension more helpless than that. The movie stops at nothing to make this dad a superhero.
Morel was up to similarly reductive tricks with 2004's French action-thriller "District B13," only to snatch the curtain back on the terrific action sequences to reveal a scathing class critique of the European power structure. For his Hollywood debut, he appears to have been briefed on how American girls sometimes go missing from cruise boats and youth hostels, and how cable-crime shows like Nancy Grace's go wild speculating about what happened. But this time outrage takes a holiday.
A rescue movie turns here into an indecent, cynical fantasy aroused by the spectacle of peddled flesh with girls drugged and in distress. I didn't care whether Bryan saves his daughter (she's a bratty "Hills" clone). But if I'm going to watch anybody track down and demolish her violators, I'd rather have a terminator with a little spunk. Nancy, can you hear me?


In the propulsively outlandish thriller Taken   (it's like Paul Schrader's 1979 Hardcore  with no brain and more muscle), Liam Neeson  plays a retired CIA agent out to find his daughter, who has been abducted by an Albanian sex trafficker. Throwing knock-'em-dead punches, Neeson  a hulk with jackknife limbs  makes Jason Bourne look like a man of tired reflexes. He pierces the underworld of sex trafficking so efficiently it's as if he'd set out to nab Osama bin Laden...and found him in 36 hours.
More from EW:  Box Office Preview: Taken  vs. the Super Bowl

 “Taken” stars a dour Liam Neeson as a big bad papa bear on the rampaging hunt for his baby cub, a virginal Los Angeles teenager — the first of many dubious plot points — who has been snatched while vacationing in Paris by hairy and scary Albanians who put her on the auction block. The movie was produced by the international hitmaker Luc Besson, who is best known for bankrolling action fare like the “Transporter” series and who shares writing credit on this exploitative throwaway with Robert Mark Kamen.  Mr. Besson, who made his reputation in the 1980s directing entertainments like “Subway,” was a central figure in a French movement called the cinéma du look, work that emphasized slick visuals, avoided ideology and politics, and paid closer heed to spectacle than to narrative. Although Mr. Besson now casts a wider net as a producer — he went somewhat upscale with the recent art house thriller “Tell No One” —  the genre movies that carry his brand tend to be predictably homogeneous, with more or less the same look (glossy), sound (blaring) and pace (relentless). That more or less  describes “Taken,” as well as innumerable action flicks from Hollywood to Hong Kong, of course, though this digitally dreary-looking movie also gleefully trades on the specter of American vigilante justice.  Directed by Pierre Morel, who kept bodies and scenes jumping in the superior “District B13,” another Besson factory production, “Taken” starts in low gear and almost immediately stalls out. Mr. Neeson’s character, Bryan Mills, a former operative for the Central Intelligence Agency (he calls himself a “preventer”), has hung up his black bag to repair his relationship with his long-neglected daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). It’s a tough road for Bryan, particularly since he has to compete with Kim’s bitter mother (Famke Janssen, in a thankless role) and wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley). Happily for Bryan, nothing brings an estranged daughter back into the patriarchal fold faster than the threat of being served up like a bonbon to a salivating, knife-wielding sheik from the Republic of Cinematic Stereotypes.  The story, which opens in Los Angeles, perks up once it moves to the more dangerous environs of Paris, where legions of predators prowl for salable young things. By chance, or rather because of the shamelessly lazy filmmaking, Kim is on the phone with Bryan when the wolves break down her door, which allows him to tell off her kidnappers: “I will find you. And I will kill you.” He makes good on both promises and, in a repellent scene, he also tortures and electrocutes one of the bad guys, employing techniques he mastered while in the C.I.A. Swarthy Europeans and Arabs may still be the villains du jour at the movies, but the Americans, including those with inexplicable Irish accents,  are, alas, catching up.  “Taken” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A veritable tasting menu of death, courtesy of knives, fists, electricity and guns of various calibers.

Without ever taking his shirt off, Liam Neeson makes a surprisingly convincing one-man mean machine in "Taken," in which an ex-CIA agent rids Paris of most of its Albanian population while rescuing his darlin' teen daughter from nasty white-slave traders. Very much in the style of other non-redemptive Euro shoot-'em-ups from Luc Besson's EuropaCorp stable ("The Transporter," etc.), dumb, pedal-to-the-metal actioner will sit well with target auds in fast playoff before robust ancillary. Late February release in Gaul has already notched up a warm $4 million in its first two frames; Stateside release via Fox is skedded for September.
Onetime Langley grunt Bryan Mills (Neeson) has moved to Los Angeles to be near his spoiled 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), now embedded in a world of luxury since his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) married rich businessman Stuart (Xander Berkeley). When some ex-CIA pals offer him a night's work bodyguarding a singer (Holly Valance), it's clear Bryan has lost none of his Jason Bourne-like skills when he saves the diva from an attempted slaying.
Under pressure from Lenore, Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim go on a Euro trip with schoolfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). But when both girls are kidnapped by evil Albanians within minutes of their arrival, Bryan hops one of Stuart's private jets to Paris to find her. He reckons he has 96 hours before Kim ends up a drug-addicted lump of white meat.
Besson alum Pierre Morel, who was d.p. on "The Transporter" and previously helmed 2004's futuristic actioner "District B13," wisely doesn't give the viewer any time to ponder the string of unlikely coincidences in the script by Besson and regular scribe Robert Mark Kamen. From the actual kidnapping -- breathlessly staged with Kim actually on the phone with dad -- to Bryan arriving in Paris and immediately causing a pileup outside the airport, pic has the forward, devil-may-care momentum of a Bond movie on steroids.
With grudging help from former French intelligence op Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin) and an Albanian translator (Goran Kostic), Bryan discovers and then trashes the baddies' ramshackle brothel prior to tracking down kidnapper Marko (Arben Bajraktaraj) and his gang. He then learns Kim has been sold in a high-class auction arranged by a certain Patrice St. Clair (Gerard Watkins) for -- natch! -- Arab clients.
Interventionist politics of the movie, which plays like "Rambo in Paris," hardly bear thinking about, but Neeson growls his way through the functional dialogue as an unstoppable killing machine in impressive, cold-eyed style. For a thesp now in his mid-50s, he handles the niftily edited, bone-crunching action way better than his scenes as a sappy, devoted father. Other thesps simply register as evil gun-fodder or script cutouts (including a wasted Janssen), with only Rabourdin suggesting anything like a real character.
Widescreen package is technically slick at all levels, and ditto the action choreography, in a cartoonish way.
