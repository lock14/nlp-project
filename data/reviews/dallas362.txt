The actor Scott Caan makes a strong debut as a writer-director in this atmospheric character study in which he also co-stars. The second-generation actor, who is usually cast for his muscular physique in youth-oriented films like Varsity Blues
 and Gone in 60 Seconds
, shows with Dallas 362
 that he has been paying attention to the craft of filmmaking while spending time on those couple dozen movie sets. Dallas 362
 sports lots of the rough edges common to first-timers, but Caan�s film also shows a real visual flair (Phil Parmet�s agile cinematography provides the film with a real boost), skillful rapport with actors, and an unusual degree of comfort with narrative ambiguity. In essence, Dallas 362
 is a coming-of-age film in which the lead character, Rusty (Hatosy), must discover the truth about what he wants to do in life and then muster up the courage to defy the wishes of his mother and best friend and follow his dream. Caan�s strength lies not in his screenwriting (at least at this point), which becomes evident as some verbal groaners slip past. Yet he does wonders with this ensemble of four, creating a real sense of intimacy among them and establishing relationships whose parameters are fluid and realistic. Of course it helps that he has a wonderful ensemble to work with. Dallas 362
 may be Hatosy�s best work so far, and Goldblum and Lynch remind us once again of their masterful acting chops (which often come and go, depending on the project). Lynch plays Rusty�s mother, Mary, who worries about all the bar fights he gets into with his best friend, Dallas (Caan), so she has Rusty see her therapist boyfriend, Bob (Goldblum). Of course, this emotionally incestuous relationship causes a few complications, but Goldblum manages to invest Bob with very human, nonomniscient traits that have him re-examining the porous personal and professional boundaries every step of the way. It doesn�t really require a shrink to figure out what�s troubling Rusty; however, the trick is to get Rusty to see what the matter is. There�s no doubt as to what the story�s conflict is (that�s clear with the film�s stunning opening shot that hurtles out from a fight that�s just broken out at a bar�s pool table and into the street), the only question is how the conflict will be ultimately resolved. The film�s opening and closing credit sequences, with their wonderfully constructed preamble and epilogue, show Caan�s filmmaking at its best and most fully articulated. We look forward to hearing more from him.

Almost inevitably, the rising career of a movie star's son will be beset by comparisons with his more famous father. Scott Caan, the 28-year-old son of James Caan, confronts this Oedipal problem head-on in his directorial debut, "Dallas 362," which he also wrote and in which he has a co-starring role. The story - about the son of a rodeo cowboy struggling to emerge from his late father's shadow - cannot help echoing the relationship between Scott Caan and his own father. The film tracks the troubled friendship between Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) and Dallas (Mr. Caan), two boys just out of their teens whose lives have become stalled in an endless cycle of drinking, bar fights and minor arrests. At the end of her rope, Rusty's mother, Mary (Kelly Lynch), sends her son to a pot-smoking psychologist, Bob (Jeff Goldblum). Soon Bob is simultaneously treating Rusty and falling in love with his mother. The therapist's unconventional methods help Rusty to imagine a better life for himself, even as his friend Dallas sinks further into a world of pool-hall brawls and petty crime. As a writer and actor, Mr. Caan seems more comfortable with men than with women; the scenes between him and Mr. Hatosy, in which the insults they trade function as a kind of secret code for their deep attachment, are deftly and movingly sketched. But when romantic subplots intrude, the film's execution feels less assured. Mr. Goldblum and Ms. Lynch are superbly cast as the neurotic middle-aged lovers, but the dialogue in the scenes they share lacks emotional heft. A young blonde named Amanda (Marley Shelton) makes a brief appearance to embody Rusty's dream girl and then disappears from the story entirely. In another less-than-compelling subplot, Val Lauren (who has a recurring role on television's "24") plays a small-time criminal with a persecution complex and a grating, whiny voice, an odd amalgam of Jerry Lewis and Sal Mineo. "It's a whole thing" is this film's catchphrase,  a line the two boys use to gesture inarticulately toward the complexity of any subject they can't understand. Mr. Caan's debut film is not quite a whole thing, but it offers up enough promising fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for. "Dallas 362"  is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, violence and one brief and relatively chaste nude scene.

The 26-year-old actor Scott Caan likely grew up watching films his father James made during the late-1960s/early-1970s, and the influence shows in his debut as writer-director, "Dallas 362." Set and shot, like last year's "Spun" and "The Salton Sea," in grimy flophouses and back alleys of Los Angeles, Caan's picture refreshingly refrains from borrowing from those films' stylistic handbook. Rather, it has a relaxed poeticism to it; it's a sweetly naive, adolescent Hemingway fantasy with a star-making performance by Shawn Hatosy and good ones from everyone else (including Caan). The recipient of the critics' jury prize at Cinevegas, this low-key but accomplished pic definitely has a future as a festival item and a specialized theatrical release.

The story of two longtime friends, Rusty (Hatosy) and Dallas (Caan), who ramble aimlessly from bar fight to bar fight, always getting bailed out by Rusty's understanding mom (Kelly Lynch), "Dallas 362" has a first-time-filmmaker's tendency to overplay its hand. At times, Caan (like Hemingway or Sam Shepard at their worst) gets a bit too seduced by the notion of angry young men working out their frustrations physically when that's exactly the thing pic purports to be rallying against. (There's one scene, in which Dallas stares at his split-open and bleeding head in the mirror and seems turned-on by it.) Rusty, who's supposed to be the one with the bright future in this doomed, "Scarecrow"-esque friendship, occasionally smacks of bad Will Hunting-isms. He's a loner-rebel caricature: the toughest, most sensitive and most misunderstood kid on the block.
But this shaggy dog of a movie (decked out in work boots and blasted blue jeans), is also involving and surprisingly mature. There's something sweetly appealing about Caan's near-fetishization of adolescent angst. Despite his indulgence in cliches, Caan connects to his characters on a deep, meaningful level; auds will care about Rusty and Dallas, even if they don't quite believe they exist. Caan lets their situations -- Rusty is looking for a way back to the Texas of his youth; Dallas is plotting a robbery to set him up for life -- play out in unpredictable ways, even if too much time is spent on the Dallas subplot.
Caan stages some lovely scenes, like one early on where a beautiful girl (Marley Shelton) walks into the diner where Rusty is eating and he tells her, without batting an eye, that he loves her, that instinctively he ought to sweep her off her feet and "rescue" her, but that he can't at the moment, because "it's a thing."
Caan also gives ample chunks of the movie over to the very honest relationship between Rusty and his mom. Lynch is very good as the mother -- it's the biggest mother role in recent memory in a movie ostensibly aimed at Generation Y -- and she even gets her own tender, unhurried romance with a shrink played by an enjoyably goofy Jeff Goldblum.
But the movie belongs to Hatosy, in his best role to date, whose Rusty is by turns child-like and wise-beyond-his-years, imploding with sadness and rage.
"Dallas 362" overstays its welcome by a bit, but keeps introducing new characters along the way to keep things fresh. (Freddy Rodriguez's turn as a Cuban shyster with a "Scarface" accent is particularly memorable.) And in pic's final moments, there's an unexpected emotional pull.
Widescreen cinematography by Phil Parmet has a day-dreamy haze that captures L.A. very well. The superb opening titles (by Howie Nourmand) are further proof that such sequences are the true renaissance art at the movies nowadays.

THE GREAT WATER    Directed by Ivo Trajkov    Picture This!, opens June 17, Quad
Orphans and cinema are old friends, at least since the days of D.W. Griffith  and Lillian Gish . Macedonian director Ivo Trajkov 's The Great Water  opens with an elderly politician, Lem Nikodinoski , being rushed to the hospital, as his mind wanders back to the close of World War II. Yugoslavia 's romance with Stalin was in full bloom, and the 12-year-old Lem (Saso Kekenovski) was interned in a re-education camp for the orphaned children of "enemies of the people." There he meets Isak (Maja Stankovska ), a boy who dabbles in occult religious practices and challenges the camp authorities. Despite the choppy script and cartoonishly bad villains, what emerges is a compelling tale of the moral compromises a corrupt system demands of even its most unwilling participants.
