Whatever else might be said about sitcom writer Leslie Caveny�s feature-screenplay debut, Penelope
, it can�t be argued that it doesn�t feature one of the oddest courtship sequences in movie history. Penelope (Ricci) and her suitor, Max (McAvoy), pitch woo and conduct their early lovemaking in two separate rooms with a one-way mirror between them, as if she were a robbery victim falling in love with a possible culprit standing in a police lineup. Unfortunately for these two young would-be lovers, no crime has been committed. The reason that mirror separates them is because Penelope has a pig�s snout instead of a nose, the result of an age-old curse placed on her blue-blood family by an angry witch. Legend has it that until Penelope finds �true love with one of her own kind,� she�ll continue to be half woman, half pig. So she and her upper-class crush flirt through a mirror. They talk, and they play chess, and they bat their eyelashes; he even goes so far as to sit in with a full New Orleans jazz band and serenade her (which, to be honest, didn�t make any sense to me at all), but it doesn�t matter. As soon as she comes out from behind that glass and he sees her face, he�s going to run for the door like all the other dowry seekers who came before him, leaving poor Penelope alone with her thoughts, her self-loathing, and her mother (O�Hara), who has raised meddlesome matchmaking to a neurotic art. To be fair, Penelope
 isn�t a bad movie. It isn�t a particularly good one, either, but for viewers who are susceptible to modern-day fairy tales that are heavy on whimsy, sweeping soundtracks, and easily digestible life lessons about the importance of inner beauty, I can see how it might be seductive. The problem, however, is that entire plot strands crop up from out of nowhere only to disappear without explanation, never to be heard from again. It�s as if Caveny had so many ideas that she simply couldn�t bear to leave any of them crumpled up on her office floor. Witherspoon (who is also one of the film�s producers) pops in for a hot second as Penelope�s newfound, tough-talking best friend and then is gone again. Max falls for Penelope and then runs away and then returns again, only to reject her and disappear again, before showing up 15 minutes later, this time with a burning desire to rejoin the rock band we never knew he was in. One minute the residents of a nearby city are living in fear of the �pig-girl�; the next she�s the girl everyone wants to be around. Then they�re all gone again, leaving unresolved questions about the nature of friendship and celebrity worship lingering in the breeze. It�s enough to drive viewers into a whiplashed panic, which is one thing a family-friendly fairy tale probably shouldn�t do.


There are probably worse things Christina Ricci could be doing in a movie than running around with a pig's snout. While you think of what they might be, Ricci dutifully carries this dollar-bin fairy tale about Penelope, an aristocrat whose porcine family curse has landed on her.
Penelope's mother (Catherine O'Hara) assumes the way to lift it is to have a blue-blooded gentleman wed her daughter. The groom will even come into Penelope's ample family fortune. But every prospective suitor runs screaming from her English mansion. Mom has hidden Penelope away from the world for decades. But a morose-looking gambler named Max (James McAvoy) is not completely appalled by her. Naturally, he's too good to be true.
Before long, Penelope escapes and discovers the world, and the media's discovery of her creates Penelope-mania, which she likes. From here the movie could have gone anywhere, especially once Reese Witherspoon turns up as Annie, a beery, horny, and jaded barfly. She shows Penelope London, gives her rides on her Vespa, and snaps the movie awake. A riskier movie might have these two flirt with each other. But the PG rating confirms that all risk has been beaten out of the movie in order to tickle the girls and young women who laughed and cooed at everything the night I saw it.
I guess the movie is exploring the issues of our times - our cruel aversion to the strange and the ugly, our sad bandwagon mentality, the case for magical nose jobs, the pitiful state of movies about young women. When someone asks Penelope if she has any other pig parts, a farce threatens to bubble up. Some dubious satire, too ("Pig Latin banned from schools!" one tabloid announces). But it comes to nothing. The director, Mark Palansky, doesn't push the movie far enough over the top. Maybe Craig Brewer, who directed Ricci to ludicrous sexual effect in "Black Snake Moan," might have been able to inject some carnality into the proceedings. Maybe Tim Burton, who directed Ricci in "Sleepy Hollow," could have given the movie a few shadows and some visual wit.
It wouldn't matter: The message in Leslie Caveny's script is ultimately too dispiriting a cop-out. This story could have gone in a number of more inspiring allegorical directions but winds up your average bedtime story instead.
What pleasures there are come from the cast. And even those are fleeting. O'Hara has a good time being snooty and shrilly narcissistic. Richard E. Grant is fine as dad. Peter Dinklage plays a reporter stalking Penelope, and the usual chip on his shoulder gets a sharp workout. McAvoy gets in some decent American accent practice. But that sleepy, mirthless face of his seems like a permanent condition, suggesting a place in only the most miserable movie romances. Needless to say, he should be perfectly at home here.
For her part, Witherspoon might have been more inventively comic with the pig snout than Ricci. She's always better dipped in acid or vinegar as opposed to honey. But here she proves she is just as good wallowing in lard.


Is there anything more dull than an ineptly cynical fairy tale? As Penelope, an aristocratic brat who's the victim of a family curse (and no, it's not the egregious overacting of Catherine O'Hara and Richard E. Grant as her parents), Christina Ricci plays a girl with the nose of a pig. Sadly, the actress is so charmless in Penelope  that we can't look at her and see inner beauty. She's just a snouted cipher. Escaping the prison of her family mansion, Penelope becomes a tabloid superstar freak in a plot that grinds along with a camp garishness that leaves one not merely bored but disenchanted.


 “Cinderella” meets “The Ugly Duckling” in “Penelope,” a muddled, charm-free fairy tale whose title character, played by Christina Ricci, is a rich girl born with the snout of a pig.  The movie’s fundamental flaws begin with Penelope’s appearance. She is supposed to be so hideous that potential suitors dive out of the windows of her family’s London mansion at the first sight of her. After an encounter one greedy twit, Edward Vanderman (Simon Woods), goes to the newspapers with a tale of being attacked by a fanged monster, but nobody believes him.  In actuality Penelope Wilhern, who is hidden away in the house by her snobbish parents, Jessica (Catherine O’Hara) and Franklin (Richard E. Grant), is more adorable than Miss Piggy. Her nose, through which runs a carotid artery (thus precluding cosmetic surgery), is well-shaped, symmetrical and cutely turned up. Ms. Ricci plays her as a smart, hardheaded young woman who stoically accepts her fate. She suffers from an ancient family curse that can be lifted, she is told, only when she marries a man of equivalent social station. There are no takers.  The movie takes a wrong turn when Edward, ridiculed for his horror story, teams up with Lemon (Peter Dinklage), a tabloid journalist wearing an eye patch, to prove her existence. They recruit Max (James McAvoy), a down-and-out aristocrat with gambling debts, to court Penelope and photograph her. Max fails to produce a picture, but in their brief encounter a spark is struck.  Penelope, desperate to experience the real world, eventually runs away from home with a scarf wrapped over her nose and is befriended by Annie, a tough-talking bike messenger played by Reese Witherspoon (one of the movie’s producers in a thankless cameo performance). Once Penelope’s identity is discovered, she becomes a tabloid celebrity.  Directed by Mark Palansky from a screenplay by Leslie Caveny, “Penelope” is a hopeless jumble of visual and linguistic styles. Its Tim Burton-manqué look combines old-fashioned storybook London with a 21st-century cityscape, and the characters speak in a welter of accents (British and American and  in between). This is a movie in which even Ms. O’Hara, whose twinkling sense of mischief can make almost anything funny, is comically stymied.  Without humor the movie’s messages about self-acceptance, snobbery and a paparazzi-infected media register as annoyingly smug. How much better “Penelope” might have been if it were animated, with a “Shrek”-worthy heroine who could magically transform.  “Penelope” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested.) It has some strong language.

In "Penelope's" whirlwind pre-title sequence, Mark Palansky establishes a confident narrative grasp and eccentric visual style, creating a richly imagined canvas that blends old worlds and new. The first-time director quickly sketches the title character's backstory: The daughter of blueblood socialites, she was born with the snout of a pig, the result of an ancient family curse. The whimsical ugly-duckling fable becomes more uneven as it proceeds, straining too hard to manufacture its quirky charms. But its message of self-acceptance might connect with tween girls daunted by unpretty adolescence.
Produced through her Type A banner by Reese Witherspoon (who also appears in a small role late in the action), the film embroiders the real London into a fantasy realm and fudges national identity with a muddle of American, British and mid-Atlantic accents.
Working with a vibrant color palette, production designer Amanda McArthur and energetic lenser Michel Amathieu fold together old city landmarks and stately streets with a sleek modern skyscape, juggling splendor with grime, fairy-tale quaintness with 21st-century style.
Jill Taylor's costumes, full of telling character detail, and Joby Talbot's lush score add to the attractive package. If the storytelling assurance falters, the production certainly earns points for ambition.
Echoing McArthur's frequent splashes of Tim Burton-influenced grotesquerie, Palansky and screenwriter Leslie Caveny draw on everything from "Beetlejuice" to "Edward Scissorhands" to "Big Fish" while dipping into the same well of fairy-tale updates that yielded pics like "Shrek," "The Princess Bride" and "Ella Enchanted." The result is sweet but less than beguiling.
Hidden from a world of prying tabloids by her overbearing mother (Catherine O'Hara) and addled father (Richard E. Grant), Penelope Wilhern (Christina Ricci) believes the curse can be broken only if she marries one of her own kind -- interpreted here as a class distinction. A long line of society suitors is assembled, but one look at her porcine shnozz makes them all bolt. Fact that Ricci's Penelope is not nearly hideous enough to justify their horrified exits (flinging themselves from an upstairs manor window) is the script's first stumbling block.
Among those making a hasty retreat is big-business scion Edward Vanderman (Simon Woods), whose claims of a Miss Piggy encounter get him branded a loony.
The poorly developed central conflict revolves around Edward's attempt to prove his sanity by exposing Penelope's existence. He teams with reporter Lemon (Peter Dinklage), who has his own grudge against the Wilherns.
They enlist Max (James McAvoy), whom they believe to be a dissolute rich boy plagued by gambling debts, to woo Penelope. Max's unexpected feelings for Penelope complicate the plan, as does her bid for independence.
Softening her brittle edges with innocence, Ricci's disarming mix of light and dark, guilelessness and pluck give the fanciful script more grounding than it might otherwise have had. She's especially good when she seizes her freedom, wrapping a scarf around her disfiguring nose and venturing forth like a veiled woman into the intimidating city streets. (The Muslim East meeting the West? Probably not.)
McAvoy also registers winningly with his affable, disheveled charm, even if the fable's romantic angle is a stop-start component.
While performance styles are too erratic in tone, O'Hara's demented timing adds comic flavor, as does the always distinctive Dinklage. Witherspoon plays a Vespa-riding free spirit who befriends the newly emancipated Penelope; the actress is a spunky presence, but her role is inconsequential.
Closer to studio fare than indie fodder, the film could use some tightening of its sluggish midsection before further exposure.


"A Fairytale Like No Other"? Penelope 's influences are right up front—there's the Tim Burton  production design (overstocking each frame with curios) and Amelie  music-box wistfulness tinkling all about. The film's titular heroine (Christina Ricci ) is born into money, but thanks to a hex brought on by a distant ancestor's snobbery, is accursed with a sow's snout (she's a prettier breed of The Twilight Zone 's pig people). Director Mark Palansky  starts Penelope  by whisking us through a "The Story Until Now" sequence, and doesn't slacken much once the real tale starts in—released fully two years after shooting, the film's been trimmed to the quick. This little piggy ventures off her family estate for the first time into a hybrid London–New York–Belle Epoque beyond, to experience life and love (with the impeccably scruffy James Mc-Avoy , ready to front some cruddy sparkle-and-fade NME -championed band). Ricci, though, is appealingly human, and some acknowledgement of the importance of female friendship, in addition to romance, is faintly touching. The social function of fables has long switched from cautionary chiding to coddling self-esteem. Hence the moral here: Self-acceptance brings inner beauty out. It's not quite that easy, but it's also not a bad lie to buy.
