         Charles Dance's "Ladies in Lavender" teams two of Britain's grandest dames, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, in an endearing film of subtlety and charm. This lovely period picture, set in Cornwall in 1936, also boasts the inimitable Miriam Margolyes and David Warner. It is a pleasure from start to finish.
 
  On a sunny summer day a nearly drowned young man (Daniel Bruhl) is washed ashore on a craggy beach, where he is discovered by two spinster sisters who share a fine old stone manor house on the cliff above. Dench's Ursula and Smith's Janet are around 70 in an era when at that age women in Britain, as in America, were regarded by themselves — and everyone else — as "old ladies" and dressed and behaved accordingly. They are therefore leading very quiet lives indeed and deeply settled into routines, attended by their crusty but loyal housekeeper (Margolyes), when this stranger appears.
 


         






    They immediately set about rescuing him, calling in the local doctor (Warner) to treat the youth and set his broken ankle. It seems he is a Polish Jew and a violin virtuoso who was swept overboard from a ship bound for America. He speaks no English but does speak German, a language in which Janet is a little rusty but with the aid of a German-English dictionary can communicate with him pretty well.
 
  Bruhl's Andrea Marowski is sweet-natured and boyish, and his impact on the sisters Widdington, Ursula especially, is immediate. Ursula has never known love — Janet lost her fiancé in World War 1— and she is overcome by romantic stirrings while Andrea soon appeals to the astringent Janet's maternal instincts. The feelings Andrea stirs up in the sisters are nothing they believe they can't handle sensibly, yet at the same time they cannot bring themselves to contemplate the possibility that at some point Andrea almost inevitably will be moving on.
 
  Complications set in when an elegant Russian watercolor artist (Natascha McElhone), while on a painting holiday to Cornwall, becomes aware of Andrea's musical gifts, and Warner's Dr. Mead, a lonely widower, becomes jealous of the artist's interest in Andrea, not knowing that it is restricted to his talent.
 
  Dench and Smith have known and worked together off and on since 1958, and it is of course a joy to watch two consummate actresses play off each other so effortlessly.
 
  Ursula and Janet are two very real, fully dimensioned women who as sisters have learned to be very supportive of one another and never let ruffled feelings distance them for long. Their Widdington sisters are part of a sturdy, hearty community of farmers and fishermen who gradually learn to accept Andrea in their midst.
 
  In reworking a William J. Locke short story, Dance, an estimable actor (perhaps best known for his gallant D.W. Griffith in the Tavianis' "Good Morning, Babylon") in his writing and directing debut overreaches a little in bringing "Ladies in Lavender" to a rather hectic conclusion. Even so, he achieves an emotional impact that has been well earned.

adies in Lavender" offers the opportunity to watch two beloved dames of the British Empire rattle around a house in Cornwall, exchanging snippets of subtext-heavy dialogue in the breaks between picking flowers, knitting and listening to the radio. The year is 1936, and through the static we discern that across the English Channel, world war is a-brewing. Those facts should stir the hearts of diehard Anglophiles of a certain generation into a frothy pitter-patter. What bliss that these purple personages should be played by none other than Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith! But don't set your expectations too high. As Ursula and Janet Widdington, twittering sisters of late middle age who share a house on a bluff with their fussy housekeeper, Dorcas (Miriam Margolyes), these two great actresses sink into their roles as comfortably as house cats burrowing into a down quilt on a windswept, rainy night. (And since this is Cornwall, such nights are plentiful.) But those hoping to see two pedigreed felines arch their backs and claw at the scenery will be disappointed. The most high drama unleashed by either sister is the discreet, disapproving little hiss that Janet (Dame Maggie) releases in reaction to the romantic disorientation of her emotionally vulnerable younger sister, Ursula (Dame Judi). Otherwise, Dame Maggie keeps her withering hauteur firmly in check. One morning after the latest piece of major weather has blown by Cornwall, what should the sisters discover on the rocky beach below their home but an unconscious young man washed up by the angry sea? The rest of the movie explores the identity of this mystery guest, as the doting duo revive and nurse him back to health with the assistance of a local doctor (David Warner). While recovering his health, the stranger is revealed to be - what else? - a violin virtuoso! Only in bittersweet dramas about lonely older women do shipwrecked young men with princely airs emerge from the sea to stir the dying embers in the hearth. For this amiably far-fetched film, the direction of Charles Dance, who adapted the screenplay from a short story by William J. Locke, heralds the return of the Comfy Movie (increasingly rare nowadays), the cinematic equivalent of a visit from a cherished but increasingly dithery maiden aunt. In this fading, sentimental genre peopled with grandes dames (usually English) making "grande" pronouncements, the world revolves around tea, gardening and misty watercolor memories. Terence Rattigan and No�l Coward perfected the Comfy Movie's tone of stiff-upper-lip sadness and nobility leavened with enlightenment. The handsome stranger on the shore, Andrea Marowski (Daniel Br�hl), is eventually revealed to be a Polish �migr� fleeing to the United States. Exactly how he was pitched into the sea is left to our imaginations. All we're given is a fleeting, clumsily inserted flashback of the young man flailing around underwater. Janet, who lost her husband in World War I, has known true love and accepted its loss, but Ursula, whose maternal doting on Andrea mutates into a romantic fixation, hasn't. The delicate kernel of the story follows Ursula's increasingly besotted state and her embarrassment as Andrea recovers and casts his eyes elsewhere. A nearby cottage is occupied by an attractive young painter, Olga Danilof (Natascha McElhone, looking alarmingly cadaverous, with sunken cheeks and zombie eyes), a summer visitor who spends her days perched in front of an easel overlooking the sea. Olga, drawn by the sound of Andrea playing a borrowed fiddle, strays onto the Widdington property and is immediately perceived as a threat. That doesn't prevent her from asking Andrea if she can paint his portrait. As its romantic score (composed by Nigel Hess and played by Joshua Bell) billows and swells, "Ladies in Lavender" suggests a more level-headed variation of "Humoresque." Here, at least, nobody ends up walking into the sea in an alcoholic funk to the strains of the "Liebestod" wafting over the radio. Joan Crawford had to die for our sins. These staunch English ladies wouldn't dream of making such a stupid sacrifice. "Ladies in Lavender" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

In "Ladies in Lavender," master pros Maggie Smith and Judi Dench simply do what they do best, without coasting on feel-good stereotypes. British actor Charles Dance, making his directorial bow, shows an assured hand which foregoes stylistic flourishes for a thesp-centered portrayal of two spinster sisters and the emotions unleashed by the appearance of a foreigner on their patch in rural England. Though distribs may have difficulty selling this one to the under-25s, pic is a given seat-filler for upscale, older auds on both sides of the Pond, not only for its surefire cast but as a worthy crowdpleaser.
Dance moves the period of William J. Locke's short story from Edwardian times to 1936, thereby taking advantage, in a light-handed but meaningful way, of the residues of WWI and the approaching conflagration of WWII. He's also parted company with some of the original's background material, allowing the characters to develop their own lives rather than be hedged in by historical indicators.
In coastal Cornwall, southwest England, sisters Ursula (Dench) and Janet Widdington (Smith) lead the kind of old-fashioned, upper-bourgeois existence beloved by PBS viewers. They're financially prudent and home-loving folk, comfortable in their quiet village life. Ursula is the dreamy one, still retaining a child's sense of fun; gently protective, older sis Janet is the practical one. In contrast, housekeeper Dorcas (Miriam Margolyes) has a no-nonsense, working-class wryness.
After a fierce storm, a body washes up in view of the Widdington manse. Miraculously alive and with little more than a broken ankle to show for the ordeal, the mysterious stranger is brought inside by the sisters, who minister to his wounds. His name is Andrea (German star-of-the-moment Daniel Bruhl), a native Pole with a whiff of melancholy and no English. Janet breaks out her old German primer and relishes her ability to communicate with the grateful young man.
Meanwhile, Ursula hovers around Andrea, extra-attentive to his needs and resentful whenever her sister gets to him first. During a small argument, Ursula accuses Janet of insensitivity and, in a perfect example of Smith's capacity to load meaning into the slightest phrase, she half mumbles "on the contrary." The three simple words are filled with a depth natural to people who know each other's secrets, and their own, intimately.
Andrea turns out to be a violin virtuoso, and the sisters borrow an instrument from the village fiddler. Visiting painter Olga Danilof (Natascha McElhone) overhears the luscious sounds coming from the house and loudly shouts her appreciation from the road, but the sisters disapprove of this beautiful, young stranger.
Undiscouraged, Olga writes a letter to the sisters telling them that her brother, world-famous violinist Boris Danilof, would love to hear their talented guest. Her forwardness, combined with her fluent German, prove a threat to the ladies, and they withhold the letter's contents from their guest.
As Andrea's mobility increases, Ursula's solicitous behavior takes on a new sense of contained desperation. It's here that Dance especially scores as a director: A film that acknowledges the sexual longings of an older woman is uncommon enough, but one that portrays those feelings as something other than improper or sordid is especially rare.
Dench almost wordlessly captures the conflicting feelings welling up inside Ursula. To the accompaniment of the classic WWI tune, "Roses of Picardy," she fantasizes her younger self locked in an embrace with Andrea.
Dance has an actor's understanding of how to showcase his cast, and in Dench and Smith he has the perfect models. Dench is perfectly paired with Smith, who's peerless at impregnating meaning into the most meager of lines, here done with poignancy and warmth. Dance isn't afraid to hold the camera on a face, trusting in his performers' physical skills.
Pic is full of delightful moments that throw into high relief the actors' craft, such as Margolyes' look of amusement and triumph after flushing the contents of a chamber pot.
Only one performer gets little to work with, and that's McElhone. Her foreign-flavored accent is a little too unplaceable, and her character, superior and independent with a bit of cock tease, serves mostly to arouse the sisters' jealousy.
Film delivers a sense of period without overloading on design details, and news of the outside world filters through in snippets heard on the radio. Sole misstep is a late-on flashback that veers into more facile sentimentality.
Golden lensing by Peter Biziou is reinforced by lighting that takes full advantage of Cornwall's late-summer sun. Composer Nigel Hess does a first-rate job with an orchestral concert that highlights Andrea's Heifetz-like talent.

"Her personal life was intertwined with the Bolshevik revolution," intones the narrator of this no-frills doc on Nadezhda Alliluyev , who was 16 when she married the 39-year-old future despot in 1919. Best known for 1982's cult classic Liquid Sky , Slava Tsukerman  combines archival footage, interviews with scholars and relatives, and plummy voice-over to dutifully recap the short life of his subject.
Nadezhda met her husband-to-be as a child when her revolutionary father offered Stalin refuge upon his escape from prison in 1908; a few years later Nadezhda's mother had an affair with Stalindescribed by one descendant as "a ladies' man." The teenage bride, who had been Lenin 's favorite stenographer, would spend her remaining years producing two children and watching her spouse transform into (in the words of one family friend) "a humanlike beast." Talking heads provide contradictory evidence as to whether Nadezhda killed herself or was murdered (perhaps by Stalin himself) in 1932. Others take the notion that the personal is political to the extreme: "Perhaps if another woman, with less spiritual demands, had been close to Stalin, things would have been different," suggests the dictator's grandson, referring to the barbarity that would ravage the Soviet Union . Yet Tsukerman is not interested in disproving or discounting theories, but merely assembling them.
