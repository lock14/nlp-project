With a cast like this it's difficult to go wrong, and, indeed, Lee has created a truly original film from various shopworn genre clich�, chief among them, the New York City bank heist/hostage standoff gone awry. As with all of Lee's films, there's much more going on beneath the surface than is immediately apparent. Inside Man
 takes pointed and well-deserved jabs at everything from post-9/11 treatment of nonwhites to, ultimately, a scheming cabal of backlogged evils that, even a decade ago, would have seemed wholly fantastic (and very much in the realm of two other NYC thrillers: Marathon Man
 and, to a lesser degree, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three
) but now feel drastically less so. The inside man of the title is actually three men and one woman, all with variations on the name Steve, who, led by a silky smooth Owen, commandeer a Manhattan bank with the supposed notion of financial gain. It's not so cut and dried as all that, as Washington's hostage negotiator, Detective Keith Frazier, and his partner Detective Bill Mitchell (Ejoifor) slowly learn. Frazier, his career stalled in mid-stride by 140 grand gone missing from another case, is thrown this bone by his superior with the ultimatum: Don't Fuck Up. But even he's not sure if he's on the right track when the crooks demand a plane and food yet kill no hostages, as if they're biding their time, waiting for something more precious than money. That's exactly what they're doing. The audience is in on it, but screenwriter Russell Gewirtz's cunning, tight script doles out droplets of information at a painfully slow rate, which only increases the tension. It's a great, unique script (I can't wait to sit down and read it through) that upends genre conventions and is buoyed by a grimly calm performance from Plummer as the bank president and an initially irritating turn by Foster as a enigmatic go-to girl who apparently has more political sway than anyone else in the five boroughs, and just maybe beyond that, to Washington itself. In the midst of all the bank-heist hullabaloo, Lee does an amazing (but very Lee-like) thing: He comments, through various hostage characters, all well-delineated despite their minimal screen time, the very essence of the city post-9/11: Its culture-clashing, turbaned-and-yarmulkaed, unmelted stew of immigrants and naturals remain inextricably mixed within the great melting pot. That man with the foreign-sounding surname was born and bred in Brooklyn or Bed-Stuy, do or die. In Inside Man
 (even the title is cagey), the robbers end up playing the cops like bull fiddles, with the unwitting assistance of the hostages, until Washington � in another shockingly good performance � isn't even sure what he's doing. The only imperative that still stands strong in Lee's post-9/11 world is the one that stands just as strong in the world outside the cineplex: If you want to find the bad guys, all you have to do, time and again, is follow the money.


For partisans, walking into a new Spike Lee film can be a nerve-racking experience. What's he going to do now? And how far off the deep end will he go? Last time, it was the epically rejected "She Hate Me," a big fat farce about a buppie and the lesbians he was paid to impregnate. It had more on its mind than most people were willing to concede, but its insanity remains inarguable.
Now it's on to a bank-robbery thriller, "Inside Man," which stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Plummer. This is probably Lee's most purely enjoyable movie, a radical departure, too, insofar as its package is conventional genre stuff with a twist of French crime classic. But the script, by first-timer Russell Gewirtz, is skintight (for a Lee film), and Lee's filmmaking is playful yet unusually calm.
The basic story is elemental, but because Lee and Gewirtz invest it with grit, comedy, and a ton of New York ethnic personality, it's fresh anyway. The first 10 minutes are a wonderful reminder of why I haven't been inside a bank in almost two years, and it's not because a gang disguised as painters might walk in and hold up the place. It's because people on cellphones waiting in line seem more annoying than people with guns.
The man running the operation is Dalton Russell, a peevish dude played by Owen with his usual growling insinuation. In the first scene, he looks right into the camera and brags that he's planned an ingenious heist. Part of its genius includes forcing his dozens of hostages to strip to their skivvies and put on dark, hooded coveralls that match the robbers'. This could be the start of "Die Hard 6." But by this point, the movie has already distinguished itself.
We've seen Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) talking nasty on the phone to his silky-voiced cop-girlfriend, played by Cassandra Freeman. (Lee always has the jazziest black women in the most thankless parts.) Frazier is in hot water over a missing $180,000 or so. But he and his partner, Bill Mitchell (Ejiofor), are given the Wall Street robbery anyway. They can't believe it. They're psyched to be on the job, and that anticipation is contagious. No crusty, jaded, Bruce Willis detectives for us. Frazier even puts on a snazzy Panama hat for the occasion.
Just as those two wings of the movie get going, the film leaves the tension at the bank and drops in on a posh apartment, where Madeline White (Foster) is about to get a call from the bank's stern owner (Plummer). He'd like her to fetch something "secret" from his safe deposit box. Madeline cuts through the movie with great occupational vagueness.
But Foster, dressed in revealing business suits, with her skin shiny, tight, and tanned, has never looked more expensive or redolent of sorority. The character is high-class, well connected, and possibly sleazy, marching down to City Hall to wring a favor from the mayor.
These three sides build to a number of nifty, if implausible, climaxes. More than its plot and the admittedly bizarre motives behind the bank robbery, "Inside Man" is a personality-driven throwback with one foot firmly in this era. A couple of times someone references a Sidney Lumet picture, and in some respects this movie might have been one of his. But this is Lee's third film since 9/11, and you can feel the sociopolitical ground shifting.
One of the bank's hostages is Vikram (the excellent Waris Ahluwalia), a young Sikh whom the robbers release early with a message tied around his neck. The NYPD officers on the scene assume he's Arab and that the message is a bomb. They rough him up, then swipe his turban. When Frazier and Mitchell interrogate him later in a booth at a diner, Vikram refuses to discuss the heist until his turban is returned, then condemns his harassment. When he's done, Washington says, "But I bet you can still get a cab." In this single moment, which is more vivid than almost all of "Crash," we see the sad modern hierarchy of American bigotry.
Lee also gets in an eloquent dig at black-male gangstas. They run amok here in a little boy's video game, a shoot-'em-up so morally appalling that even Owen's nasty bank robber takes offense.
This is a big Hollywood movie, with Lee's usual truckload of ideas and energetic performances from the entire cast. Washington hasn't been this relaxed in years. When he feels like it he can be the most charismatic star in the movies. His smile, which he flashes in the joshing interrogation scenes sprinkled throughout the film, is a dentist's dream. This is a simmering, intelligent piece of acting that, for a change, stays below the emotional radar. Washington is having a good time. So is Foster, who seems happy not to have to roll up her sleeves and bruise people. She and Washington have a pair of crackling scenes together in which they really seem to be studying each other. Enough can't be said of actors who like their material. If they buy it, so will we.
And Lee is suavely selling -- but not selling out. He's found a way to matter as an entertainer without copping out as an artist. The fact that Brian Grazer has produced "Inside Man" might strike some people as odd, like Phil Spector trying to tame the Last Poets. But the movie is unmistakably a Spike Lee Joint. He's surrounded by his usual precision band, which still keeps sizzling harmony: Barry Alexander Brown on editing, Wynn Thomas on production design, Terence Blanchard on score, Matthew Libatique, back for his second tour with Lee, on photography, and Washington on the lead.
For Lee, working with Grazer is just an opportunity. Everything is. He's been itching for something to catch commercially his whole career, and this superbly crafted movie looks like his best chance yet.

         What's going down inside Manhattan Trust's Wall Street branch may or may not be the usual bank robbery, but "Inside Man," the crime drama that details those nefarious doings, is careful to keep its distance from your standard heist movie.
 
  Smartly plotted by newcomer Russell Gewirtz and smoothly directed by, of all people, Spike Lee, "Inside Man" is a deft and satisfying entertainment, an elegant, expertly acted puzzler that is just off-base and out-of-the-ordinary enough to keep us consistently involved.
 


         






    The broad outline of "Inside Man," of course, couldn't be more familiar. We're talking perfect-crime territory here, the classic cat-and-mouse encounter between criminal mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), the NYPD operative charged with outthinking the man with the master plan. Screenwriter Gewirtz, though, is not interested in doing anything quite that formulaic. Though its eye is always on the final showdown, his script is especially good at doling out confounding information on a need-to-know basis, providing a multitude of incidents to occupy our minds until all the pieces fall into place. This is one of the rare films Lee has directed without at minimum co-writing the script, and you can see why. Though he has made his own versions of standard Hollywood films before — witness the classic biopic "Malcolm X," also starring Washington — it's obvious that Lee is more at home with argumentative, provocative, socially relevant films than he is with this kind of genre material. Which turns out to be a good thing.
 
  For though he is perfectly capable of crisply handling nuts-and-bolts action scenes like that of the quartet of robbers securing the bank and taking dozens of hostages, that is never going to be enough to hold Lee's interest.
 
  So the director found ways to be slightly off the mark, from the minor — starting the film with the unmistakable and beautifully disorienting rhythms of Bollywood superstar composer A.R. Rahman — to the major, including the decision to use both Washington and costar Jodie Foster in roles that depart a bit from what they usually do. And what else could the shot of Brooklyn's legendary Cyclone roller coaster under the opening credits be telling us except that this is going to be quite the wild ride? Lee has also been able to make political points around the film's edges, to be himself without sacrificing the project's plausibility in the process. A Sikh hostage complains of police mistreatment and being called "an Arab." Two police officers have a racially charged conversation. A boy is chided for playing a particularly brutal and insensitive video game. Not to mention that one of "Inside Man's" themes, the notion of systemic political corruption, doubtless found a receptive audience with the filmmaker.
 
  Finally, like any nongenre director, Lee is interested in people, in what they look like and how they act. It's an interest that exists outside of considerations of suspense, but when characters are made individual, it inevitably means that we worry more about them, which of course heightens tension.
 
  One person who is cast exactly to type with excellent results is the redoubtable Owen, who opens the film by looking directly at the camera and saying, as only he can, "My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say. I choose my words carefully, and I never repeat myself." What Russell, no paragon of modesty, proceeds to tell us is that he's planned the perfect bank robbery. The film immediately shows him and his team, all dressed identically in painters' coveralls, swiftly taking over the bank in question and telling cowed hostages, "My friends and I are making a very large withdrawal. Anyone who gets in the way gets a bullet in the brain."
 
  Charged with negotiating with the man is Washington's Det. Frazier and his partner, Bill Mitchell (the always convincing Chiwetel Ejiofor). Frazier, however, is not the superstar cop you might be expecting. He is a veteran detective second grade with the slightest hint of a paunch who got the assignment only because the department's top guy was on vacation.
 
  At first the situation develops like any other bank robbery, with Russell eventually demanding the usual fully fueled jet ready to take him and his team out of town. But first the audience and then Frazier begin to sense through the actions of others that there are as yet unnamed factors in play.
 
  The first hint of this comes when Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), Manhattan Trust's board chairman, is informed of the robbery and says, "Oh, dear God." He next calls Madeline White (a picture-stealing performance by Foster), who is the ultimate ice-princess power broker in a city of power brokers, and asks for her services.
 
  From that point on, "Inside Man's" plot takes more twists and turns than the venerable Cyclone and includes the interesting technique of periodically flashing forward to police interrogations of the hostages after the siege is over. Like everything else about this engrossing thriller, it's a tactic intended to keep the audience on its toes, and it does.
 
 "Inside Man"
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for language and some violent images   

As Inside Man  busts open, some guys dressed like industrial painters descend on a New York bank, one of those somber marble edifices built to last as long as the dollar rules. The intruders stride in wearing sunglasses, scarflike masks, worker jumpsuits, and painter caps. Then they hold up the place at gunpoint, forcing some 50 male and female hostages to don identity-blurring jumpsuits and sunglasses, too. The gang, led by stern ringleader Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), appear to be bank robbers in search of what's in the vault. But they're in no hurry to take the money and run. Instead, as Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) discovers when he begins negotiations with Russell, the cat-and-mouse head game is, to Russell, its own reward.
Frazier's a complicated cat himself, ambivalent about proposing to his girl, ambivalent about clearing his name in a corruption charge, an angry black cop dressed like a dandy in a white-power world. The bank chairman, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), a suave, old-world type, is a conundrum too  he's suspiciously worried about the contents of one safe-deposit box. And to that end, mid-hostage-crisis, Case hires Madeline White (Jodie Foster), an elegant (and, wouldn't you know, complicated) corporate ''fixer,'' to broker a deal that would leave that particular box off Russell's must-have list. Foster gleefully musters her throatiest ballbuster voice as she heel-toes her way around in expensive cream-colored suits and fierce stilettos, a siren of shady dealing who'd do well selling secrets on 24 .
There's mystery to what Madeline is really up to, but that's just one among many in Russell Gewirtz's grabber of a first script: Everyone's complicated in this jam-packed, spring-loaded contraption, everyone's sneaky, compromised, clever, nervous, mouthy, opinionated, and New Yorky. Even the hostages are choice  there's a young woman who gabs obnoxiously into her cell phone, the little black kid playing a jolly-horrid videogame called Kill Dat Nigga, an old rabbi worried about diamonds, an elderly woman who would rather be shot than strip to her undies in public. Everyone's prime material, in other words, for Spike Lee to fashion his first mainstream, bring-in-the-box-office adventure.
Inside Man  is a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint. Or else it's a cross between a 2006 Spike Lee joint and a 1970s-style movie indictment of urban unease. It's also a blend of Dog Day Afternoon  and a Foster tough-lady thriller; of a Foster thriller and a smooth Owen sleight-of-hand drama; and of an Owen caper and a Washington out-for-justice pic. Some unwieldy hybrid  and yet the gamble pays off. Everyone gets a piece of the deal. Everyone gets a piece of the city with the brutally changed skyline, in all its new paranoia.
Gewirtz's script spells out the power snarls between Frazier and his police captain (Willem Dafoe) and between Frazier and Russell (more of a concept than a character despite Owen's energetic efforts at creating dimension). But it's Lee whose eye seizes the continuously recalibrated details of race, gender, culture, and socioeconomic power with which New Yorkers have sized one another up with even more anxiety since the towers fell. A Sikh hostage is distraught and insulted when, under interrogation, his turban is taken from him. (He's fed up with being mistaken for an Arab.) An Albanian woman, brought in by the cops to translate chatter picked up by surveillance, barters her bilingual abilities for amnesty from a shopping bag filled with parking tickets. The videogame-playing kid tells Russell, ''I'm not scared. I'm from Brooklyn.''
Lee, also from Brooklyn, hangs on to some old tricks that have outstayed their welcome. One favored camera tic, in which a fella appears to float while the world zooms behind him, tells us nothing when turned on Plummer's bank mogul. The jazzish score, by Lee's music man, Terence Blanchard, is typically intrusive. But the mood is right, the twists are new. And with one casting inspiration, Inside Man  furthers the rising stardom of Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity ). Playing Frazier's detective partner with perfect New York diction, the magnetic British-born actor raises Washington's game in every scene the two share. (Denzel looms large, but his energy level also fluctuates.) In a movie about zigging and zagging, that extra boost is as necessary to negotiations as the pizzas delivered to hungry hostages in New York-flavored movies the world over.

 FOR most of his career, the great and maddeningly unreliable Spike Lee has been anything but — to borrow the title of his diverting new film — an inside man. Mr. Lee, who hit the scene in the mid-1980's with "She's Gotta Have It," a barbed independent comedy that jump-started the black film movement and made him a national brand, has preferred to be seen as an outside man, a rebel who said what he wanted, when he wanted, far from the industry establishment. To judge from this precision-tooled amusement, Mr. Lee may have missed his calling (one of them, anyway) as a studio hire.  "Inside Man" is a jolt, partly because it comes equipped rather incongruously with the name of Mr. Lee's company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, but mostly because this is the kind of seamless diversion that should be a stock item in Hollywood, but isn't. Much like Richard Donner's recent actioner, "16 Blocks," another effective piece of genre showmanship, "Inside Man" works because it takes a familiar setup — in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis — and twists it ever so slightly. A particularly solid screenplay helps here, as do stars who can actually act — this film's holy trinity being Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster — along with an excellent supporting cast and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside "The Sopranos."  Here's how it goes down: Mr. Owen stares into the camera and announces that he is about to commit "the perfect bank robbery."  Whether his character, Dalton Russell, succeeds is immaterial to how he gets from the first act to the third, which is where Mr. Lee's movie love comes in. This is the least overtly personal of Mr. Lee's films, but it's also his most polished and satisfying work in years, with none of the raggedness that sometimes mars even his best intentions. Taking his cue from the surprising, witty screenplay by the newcomer Russell Gewirtz, the filmmaker frames the heist and subsequent standoff as a really big show — namedropping "Dog Day Afternoon" along the way — then cuts  his actors loose and lets them play.  As the action pings between Russell working his wicked ways inside the bank (beating hostages, forcing them to  wear unflattering coveralls); Mr. Washington's smooth operator, a veteran detective named Keith Frazier; and Ms. Foster's Madeline White, a fixer hired by the bank, you might find yourself trying to unknot the increasingly tangled plot. Don't bother. Filled with playful noise and nonsense, clever feints and digressions, "Inside Man" has a story to tell, but its most sustained pleasures come from its performances, especially the three leads. To watch Mr. Washington breeze into a scene smooth as silk, smooth as Bogart and Easy Rawlins combined, or to listen to Mr. Owen murmur sweet nothings into the camera, is to experience the ineffable pleasures that only big-screen stars can provide.  Mr. Lee rarely treats his actresses or female characters as well as their male counterparts, but whether by design or neglect, he helps Ms. Foster deliver her wittiest, most relaxed performance in ages. Part Mata Hari, part Ilsa the She Wolf, she stalks the sets in form-fitting suits and nose-bleed heels that show off her spectacular legs wonderfully. (She could kill with those things!) In a story dominated by men, in which most of the women are either desexualized or double-D babes, her character presents an amusing fantasy of female power. One of those mysterioso brokers who circumvent both the law and the criminal element for the deepest pockets in town, Madeline isn't the equal of any man: she's superior. And you thought dominatrixes wore only black leather.  Like everyone else in the film, Madeline seems interested only in getting hers. Russell wants his ill-gotten gains, Detective Frazier wants his promotion, and the bank bigwig (Christopher Plummer) wants his secrets kept — it's a Hobbesian world, after all. Mr. Lee, meanwhile, most likely wants the respect that he has always been due. Consistently underrated and underappreciated, this  filmmaker is an erratic talent, if no more so than many ensconced in Hollywood, and his insistence that race matters has cost him dearly with the mainstream (i.e., white) audience. He's right, of course, that race matters, which is why, in between plot points and star turns, he gently and, at times, rather hilariously, insists on reminding us that it does. He may have sublet this "Spike Lee Joint" to out-of-towners, but it's good to see that he hasn't left the neighborhood.  "Inside Man" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some gun violence, some sexual innuendo and a lot of bad, bad words.

A thriller that aims to be different, "Inside Man" stirs some very tasty flavors into its familiar bank robbery/hostage crisis plot, which helps conceal the modest portion of the central ingredient, suspense. A flashy cast, clever script and vibrant showcasing of New York City as the ultimate melting pot are strong plusses for Spike Lee's most mainstream studio venture, which Denzel Washington's name should propel to solid returns for Universal.
No matter the diversity of his projects, one thing Lee has never been is a genre filmmaker. While his interests and instincts remain elsewhere, he does throw himself into the spirit of things here, briskly setting the lay of the land -- the stately Manhattan Trust Bank in the Wall Street area -- and efficiently presenting its takeover by a band of four masked and armed intruders led by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen).
As Russell and his cohorts corral 50 hostages, dress them in identical baggy outfits and masks and roughly threaten them, it quickly becomes clear the ringleader is an unusually smart criminal. However, his motives and intentions -- issues first-time scripter Russell Gewirtz deliberately evades as long as he can -- remain unclear.
There are piles of money in the vault tantalizingly ripe for the picking, but the wily perp seems to have his mind on something else.
Under the circumstances, the detective in charge, Keith Frazier (Washington, sporting a thin moustache and near-shaven head), sees no alternative but to play a waiting game. In the doghouse at headquarters and assigned to the case with partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) only as a substitute, Frazier, in league with Emergency Services officer John Darius (Willem Dafoe), suppresses the urge to take any untoward action that could endanger the hostages, indulging only in innocuous schemes such as sneaking hidden microphones into the bank in pizza boxes.
To fill the time until Russell makes a move, Lee and Gewirtz begin layering the action with elements both germane and incidental. Snippets of post-crisis hostage interviews create the impression they got away unharmed, as did, evidently, the hold-up crew. These exchanges are often amusing, but introducing them so early in the proceedings reps a double-edge sword, as they inevitably reduce whatever tension had been generated up to then.
Then there are the machinations of the bank's founder and chairman, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), who enlists ambiguous high-end power-broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to monitor the sensitive contents of his personal safe-deposit box.
Revelations concerning these hidden items ultimately prove dramatically crucial. But while the substance of the secrets has topical validity, pic's credibility is seriously compromised by the great unlikelihood that Case would allow such potentially damaging material to exist.
Still, Lee insures the substance of the film consists as much in its texture and details as its plot. It may seem like a predictable cliche, especially to the director's detractors, that he so intently underlines the ethnicity of even the most minor characters; much is made of the rainbow brigade that constitutes the hostage group: the white woman who talks loudly on her cell phone; the young Sikh hostage who, when released, strenuously complains of being mistaken for an Arab; the glam Albanian sexpot who knows how to play her cards, and the young black hostage whose ultraviolent "Kill Dat Nigga" computer game gives pause even to Russell.
Lee makes a point of showing New York and, by extension, American society top to bottom, from politicos and power players in their extravagantly appointed lairs to drug-addled deadbeats like the teen brother of Frazier's girlfriend. Mostly, of course, there are the working stiffs in the middle, including most of the hostages and the cops, who just try to get through each day.
"Dog Day Afternoon" serves as an acknowledged template here, but aside from the central bank hostage situation driven by unconventional reasons, the differences are more marked than the similarities; Sidney Lumet's film was notable for grand theatrics and the spectacle of the media/law enforcement frenzy, two aspects "Inside Man" shies away from.
While far from the most compelling character Washington has played, Frazier is interesting enough, a savvy, confident guy alternately prudent and rash who hasn't advanced professionally as far as he wants. He'd like to think he can outwit his crafty adversary, although only a long-distance mind-reader could deduce what Russell's really up to.
Frazier's sartorial selections, which include classy suits, the occasional bow tie and spiffy straw hat, command attention of their own. As the mastermind, Owen is commanding despite being hidden behind a mask much for the time, while Foster seems to be having fun with a change-of-pace role as the elegant, far-more-superior-than-thou intermediary.
With Matthew Libatique behind the camera for his second consecutive picture with Lee, rough-and-ready visuals are of a piece with those of the helmer's previous pics. Terence Blanchard's score tends to the grandiose, although some Bollywood rap interludes are quite catchy.

Possibly the least personal Spike Lee  joint in the entire history of cinema, the bank-heist-hostage -policier-cryptoterrorist thriller Inside Man  nevertheless manages to be a most enjoyable sampling of the director's treasured "my way" eccentricities.
This big-budget studio release, set mainly in and around a Wall Street area financial institution, has been fashioned from a cunning script that, given its Holocaust subtext, scenarist Russell Gewirtz  might have hopefully pitched Steven Spielberg . Denzel Washington  stars as a cocky police detective matching wits with Clive Owen , the smooth mastermind who takes the bank. Jodie Foster  (hilariously referred to throughout as "Miss White") plays a high-powered fixer hired by super-capitalist swine Christopher Plummer  to finesse a dicey situation; Willem Dafoe  is on hand to bark out a few orders. The stars are not exactly slumming here, but they're frequently upstaged by the garrulously polyglot mob of unruly New Yorkers trapped in the bank or patrolling its perimeter.
The svelte, twisty plotting, complete with concentration camp references and Nazi-era villainy, is almost certainly Gewirtz, but the ethnic vaudeville is pure Spike. "You get the same treatment as everybody else, rabbi," one of the bank robbers gratuitously snarls during the grand takeover. "Face down on the floor!" Or, rather, in-your-face all the time: Inside Man  resounds with stray assertions of irate identity like "100 percent Albanian! 100 percent Albanian!" and "What the fuckgive me my turban!" The latter demand, delivered by a Sikh bank employee to the cops who are questioning him, readily segues into a diatribe against post9-11 profiling, the onrushing complaint coming to an abrupt bada-boom when Washington's partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor ) dryly observes, "I bet you can get a cab, though."
Inside Man  certainly functions as a genre film, but the backbeat of inane banter and schoolyard trash-talking serves to promote an infectious sense of levity. Adding to the pervasive wackiness, Lee pours on the florid mise-en-scéne; he humanizes the bare scaffolding of the Gewirtz scenario by subjecting the action to an assortment of space-mauling, time-wasting pans, as well as his trademark static character background glide. The filmmaker is sufficiently relaxed to interpolate the occasional editorial (in this case, against racist video games) and forcefully plug his pet '70s movies. "You saw Dog Day Afternoon ," Washington triumphantly taunts Owen. "I know you're stalling."
Speaking of stalling: Inside Man 's denouement is somewhat pointlessly distended. Spike Lee couldn't cut a movie down to two hours if his life and the fate of Universal Studios  depended on it. Still, this enjoyable exercise in popcorn pyrotechnics demonstrates that Lee can be relied on to attack the clichés set before him with gusto. I wouldn't say that he exactly robbed the bank, but in this joint at least, he's his own inside man.
