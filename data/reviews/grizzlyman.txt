Timothy Treadwell was a quixotic, towheaded dude of a man determined to defy the boundary between man and bear. Actually, he didn't appear to perceive much of a boundary at all. As far as he was concerned, he was one of them.
One bear didn't quite see it that way. In the fall of 2003, Treadwell, an actor-turned-animal preservationist, and his girlfriend were eaten by one of the Alaskan beasts he spent a decade trying to protect.
His passion for wildlife elevated his plight from kooky folly to a nearly religious act, most of which he recorded with a video camera. If this story of a man's ultimately unwinnable struggle with the environment sounds like a Werner Herzog movie, now it is. ''Grizzly Man," a sublime new documentary, assembles Treadwell's video diaries and interviews with his parents and closest friends to relate a haunting cautionary tale.
According to Herzog, who doesn't narrate the movie so much as furnish unstinting running commentary on Treadwell's footage and psyche, Treadwell's wish to ''leave the confines of his humanness to bond with the bears" was a transgression. ''In doing so," Herzog explains in his insinuating German brogue, ''he crossed an invisible borderline."
We could say the same of Herzog, who for five decades has been the dark lord of transgressive filmmaking. He's given us a film starring all little people (1970's ''Even Dwarves Started Small"), one about a fanatic who dragged conquistadors through the Peruvian jungle (1972's ''Aguirre, Wrath of God") and another about a fanatic who built an opera house in the same tropical climes (1982's ''Fitzcarraldo"). Those difficult, endlessly fascinating movies (and a handful more), with their legendary back stories and extreme stunts, were Herzog in his domineering, some would say cruelly combative, prime. Back then he battled the elements, the earth, and the actors, with leading man Klaus Kinski as his greatest opponent.
But in his late 50s and 60s (he'll be 63 next month), Herzog hit a new stride with a fresh round of nonfiction. I wouldn't characterize this current phase as mellow, but even when they flirt with exploitation, his recent documentaries have allowed Herzog to humanize himself. (This a man who, in the name of cinema, once climbed an erupting volcano and, on a separate occasion, hypnotized his cast.) ''Grizzly Man" is the fourth of his tremendous documentary psychodramas, following 1997's ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly" and 1999's ''Wings of Hope" and ''My Best Friend." Despite the ghastly circumstances, it's the most compassionate movie he's ever made.
Treadwell's ideas are perfectly suited to Herzog's cinematic taste and philosophical beliefs. But the subject's life arouses the journalist in the filmmaker. The gruesome particulars of the deadly mauling are delivered in a surreal comic fashion by coroner Franc G. Fallico who speaks directly into the camera about how Treadwell and his companion, Amie Huguenard, perished. Oddly, Fallico seems like a figure from an Errol Morris film, and Herzog shrewdly uses him to handle the forensic angle, while the director argues for Treadwell as a psychologically troubled young man.
The man we find in the footage is impish and childlike. In his simultaneous delusion and naivete, Treadwell variously recalls Michael Jackson, Pee-wee Herman, and Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka.
Yet Herzog complicates the picture with the late discovery that Treadwell might have suffered from megalomania. Indeed, we see Treadwell launch into an expletive-laced screed that practically gives Herzog a Kinski flashback. Still, the director expresses sincere admiration for his subject's purity and impregnable spirit. The preservationist in Treadwell understands that the bears are dangerous, but the empathizer in him doesn't see how the danger is personally relevant.
Nonetheless, by telling us up front what they're capable of, Herzog trains us to fear the animals. And the flying bugs that swarm the camera on several occasions signal a note of inevitable doom: We know there is carrion out there.
Yet Herzog, in a merciful show of decorum, does not subject us to it. The deaths were recorded only on an audio track, and in the movie's most powerful moment, Herzog actually insists that a devastated ex-girlfriend of Treadwell's never listen to the tape. He wants her to burn it.
Throughout ''Grizzly Man," Herzog cuts firmly but delicately past Treadwell's ecological romance, seeing passive-aggressive fatalism where some might see a martyr. He also reminds us that he's learned a lot during his formidable career. Nature has laws, and, however great a temptation it might be to break them, they should be heeded.

         "Grizzly Man" shows and tells an astonishing story, a disturbing and provocative tale of obsession, bravado and self-invention that leaves you open-mouthed for all kinds of reasons.
 
  You will wonder at the vivid footage, mostly with massive bears but sometimes playful foxes, that Timothy Treadwell shot of himself interacting with animals during the last five of the 13 summers he spent camping out in an area he called the Grizzly Maze in the far reaches of Alaska.
 


         






    Treadwell the man turns out to be even more complex and involving than his nature footage. Blond, handsome, charismatic, he styled himself, says documentary director Werner Herzog, as "the lone guardian of the grizzly," someone who was convinced the love he'd created with the animals would protect him from their claws and jaws. "They can kill, they can bite, they can decapitate," he says on camera. "But it will never be me."
 
  Yet in October of 2003, in an ending with so much of the awful inevitability of myth it made news around the world, it was him. The 46-year-old Treadwell and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, were killed and eaten by a grizzly in Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve. In the final irony, his death led to the killing of members of the species he had sworn to protect.
 
  This story of the powers and the limits of delusional thinking, of a man who truly felt that if you dreamed your dream hard enough you could bend reality to your will — and who did just that for a surprising number of years — is such a perfect fit for Herzog your first thought is that the filmmaker made up Timothy Treadwell, that he couldn't possibly be real.
 
  A veteran filmmaker who's been making documentary and fiction films for more than 40 years, Herzog — witness features like "Fitzcarraldo" and "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" — has often gravitated toward driven individuals who've set themselves up against rationality, not to mention sanity. It's no wonder that Les Blank's documentary on Herzog is called "Burden of Dreams."
 
  Treadwell was not only exceptionally real, he also left behind 80 to 100 hours of footage he shot himself, and selections from the footage comprise about half of "Grizzly Man's" running time. The rest of the film consists of interviews with people who knew and worked with Treadwell that examine the extent of his passion and his self-creation as well as offer a detailed look at the horrific circumstances of his death and of the bear that likely killed him.
 
  What's inescapable from the first moment we see Treadwell facing the camera is what a mesmerizing talker and supreme, tree-topping egotist he is, absolutely delighted to be playing the lead in the drama of his life. It's not at all surprising to discover that, as an addictive personality who'd nearly died of a drug overdose, Treadwell transferred his addiction to bears, convincing himself that they needed help surviving and that he was the person chosen by the universe for that task. He says "I will die for these animals" so passionately and so often he sounds like a politician.
 
  Like anyone profoundly sure of himself, no matter what their ideology, Treadwell gathered followers and supporters. Along with close friend Jewel Palovak, he founded an organization called Grizzly People, entranced large numbers of schoolchildren with his bear lore and appeared on David Letterman's show, where the host asked him point-blank, "Are we going to read about your being eaten by one of these bears?"
 
  What makes Treadwell's crusade trickier is that it's not at all clear his bears actually required protection. Undeniably he felt a kinship with the animals he returned to year after year, giving them nicknames like Mr. Chocolate, the Grinch and Sgt. Brown. And for reasons that will never be clear, perhaps a combination of the man's undeniable fearlessness and God's willingness to protect fools, the bears tolerated him in return.
 
  Still, Herzog has said in off-camera interviews, "probably he needed the bears and the presence of the bears more than the bears needed him. Let's face it, from a practical point of view, you do not protect the grizzly by standing 3 feet away from him."
 
  More than that, though the tapes promote the notion that he's out there alone, Treadwell not infrequently had companionship, especially in the last years, of the woman who died with him, Amie Huguenard. Huguenard's family chose not to cooperate with the film, and she remains a mystery even after reading "The Grizzly Maze," Nick Jans' strong new book on Treadwell, which offers considerably more information on her.
 
  To many individuals interviewed in the film, moreover, Treadwell crossed a line by getting too familiar with bears, by treating them, as one man says, like "people in bear costumes instead of wild animals." Herzog himself agrees with this theory, as does an Aleut museum curator who has a Harvard doctorate, emphasizing the notion that in "seeking a primordial encounter," Treadwell in effect disrespected the bear and invited his own death.
 
  Yet it's hard not to be impressed, as Herzog himself very much is, with Treadwell's perseverance and skills as a filmmaker, his documenting of what the director calls "human ecstasies and darkest inner turmoil." A mating season battle between two bears is riveting, as are, for a completely different reason, shots of a baby fox fooling around with Treadwell on a tarp. Though Herzog takes a gratuitous swipe at organized labor when he calls his footage something "studio directors with their union crews could never dream of," it is awfully impressive stuff.
 
  Our attitude toward Treadwell, like Herzog's, is a mediated mixture of horror and fascination. We're intrigued to see video Treadwell shot of the bear that likely killed him but just as happy not to hear the audio record that exists, which the film does not include, of that fatal attack. It's a tribute to the remarkable qualities of Herzog's film that we are left uncertain just what we think of Timothy Treadwell.
 
  Finally, though, as Jans writes in "The Grizzly Maze," it is hard to escape the spooky feeling that "in the best 19th-century folk-song tradition," the man did "indeed die in the arms of his own true love."

To call Timothy Treadwell a man madly in love with grizzly bears is a statement of adverbial precision. For 13 summers, the self-appointed advocate of Ursus horribilis chose to camp out on the Alaskan peninsula as an uninvited guardian and promoter of the species, obsessively documenting his experience on videotape to create his own personal nature movie with himself as heroic movie star. Before he found his calling, Treadwell dreamed of becoming an actor, and even alone in the wilderness, he was vain about his surfer-boy good looks, his sun-bleached hair styled in a distinctive Prince Valiant shag. ''They're not that different from us,'' the home-grown naturalist said of his neighbors as the boundaries between man and beast became increasingly unstable. Treadwell's mission lasted until October of 2003, when he and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, were mauled to death by one of the creatures he considered his friends. He was 46 years old when he died, with a video camera running. The picture failed. The audio portion survived.
In a stunning application of nature's balance to art, Werner Herzog makes use of some of the 100-plus hours of video footage Treadwell left behind to create Grizzly Man , a mesmerizing work of disturbing power and unease. The director of Fitzcarraldo  and Aguirre , the Wrath of God , famous for both his fiction and documentary studies of men teetering between omnipotence and insanity, has crystallized his reputation as a chronicler of metamorphosing personality. Immersing himself in details, the filmmaker incorporates Treadwell's own footage (Treadwell sometimes indulged in multiple takes to achieve the look of spontaneity); interviews with a zoologist, a medical examiner, and the pilot who discovered the bodies when he flew in to Treadwell's base camp; and narration, in his own hypnotically mild German accent.
We don't hear Treadwell's death, but we watch as Herzog listens to the audio evidence and then advises Treadwell's former girlfriend/business partner to destroy the tape without listening to it. We respond emotionally, nonetheless; in Grizzly Man , Herzog has bushwhacked fearlessly into one man's thorny soul.

 One rainy afternoon in the Alaskan wilderness two years ago, a self-made man named Timothy Treadwell was  mauled and eaten by a grizzly bear. It may be that the animal, a scrawny male about 28 years old and 1,000 pounds, was trying to fatten up in preparation for its winter's sleep. As it happens, Treadwell, who achieved minor celebrity as an expert on grizzlies, publishing a book on the bears and jousting with David Letterman on late-night television, had pitched his tent in a feeding ground. The call of the wild was as irresistible to Treadwell as his flesh proved to be to that bear.  The strange story of Timothy Treadwell, a Long Island native who came to see himself as some kind of ursine Dr. Dolittle, only to die at 46 from a bear attack,  is the subject of "Grizzly Man," the latest documentary from Werner Herzog. As fans of the German New Wave know, the director has a fondness for stories about men who journey into the heart of darkness, both without and within - men like the deranged 16th-century explorer in "Aguirre, the Wrath of God," who searches for El Dorado in the Amazon, and the early-20th-century esthete in "Fitzcarraldo" who hauls a steamboat up a mountain  to bring Caruso to the Peruvian jungle. Treadwell's journey was no less bold or reckless than these earlier Herzogian tales and certainly no less enthralling.  Mr. Herzog has been making documentaries for more than three decades, about as long as he has been directing fiction films, but he is not part of any nonfiction tradition. In a statement on his Web site, wernerherzog.com, he declares: "By dint of declaration the so-called cinéma vérité is devoid of vérité. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants." This is a rather crude  attempt to separate himself from the nonfiction crowd, but Mr. Herzog is also no ordinary filmmaker. It is the rare documentary like "Grizzly Man," which has  beauty and passion often lacking in any type of film, that makes you want to grab its maker and head off to the nearest bar to discuss man's domination of nature and how Disney's cute critters reflect our profound alienation from the natural order.  Beauty enters first in "Grizzly Man," which opens with two bears  grazing on a spectacular stretch of green in the Katmai National Park and Preserve, a nearly five-million-acre swath on the Alaska Peninsula. Dressed in black, his  pageboy stirring in the wind, Treadwell walks into the frame and introduces the grizzlies as Ed and Rowdy. "They're challenging everything, including me," he says as the bears munch away. "If I show weakness, if I retreat, I may be hurt, I may be killed. I must hold my own if I am going to stay within this land. For once there is weakness, they will exploit it, they will take me out, they will decapitate me, they will chop me into bits and pieces. I'm dead. But so far, I persevere,  persevere."  It is a typical Treadwell recitation - sincere, grandiose and intensely worrisome - a bit of bravura that ends with the self-designated "kind warrior" blowing a kiss and signing off like Kojak: "Love you, Rowdy." Even if you don't know that Treadwell was killed along with his girlfriend, a physician's assistant named Amie Huguenard, his familiarity with, and proximity to, the bears bodes badly, for him and for them. There is something surreal (at least to a committed urbanite) about anyone who would talk to these animals, especially a guy whose blond, bland good looks made him seem like an aging surfer, a kind of Spicoli of the backwoods. But as Mr. Herzog points out in his online manifesto, "facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable."  Despite some early bumps, Treadwell started off as an average sort.  After an injury put an end to an athletic scholarship, he moved to (where else?) Southern California. There he did the usual bumming around, but his life  soured and, according to his book, "Among Grizzlies," written with Jewel Palovak, he suffered a near-fatal drug overdose. Scared straight, he gradually reinvented himself, and by the early 1990's was summering in Katmai, home to about  2,000 grizzlies. Mr. Herzog lays out this history in voice-over, illustrating Treadwell's ups and downs through the spectacular videos the amateur naturalist shot and interviews with the dead man's family and friends. The filmmaker also taps the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on Treadwell and Huguenard, Dr. Franc G. Fallico, a character around whom an entire reality show could be built.  Dr. Fallico pops up a couple of times in "Grizzly Man," but the most potent use of his testimony occurs when he expounds  at length in an autopsy room, a scene that illustrates Mr. Herzog's sense of drama beautifully. Sporting a blue smock and a fixed gaze, Dr. Fallico recounts his version of the attack, a  description based on his examination of the bodies and the six-minute audio record found on one of Treadwell's video cameras. (The lens cap was on the camera.) The account is graphic, gruesome and thoroughly riveting, partly because morbid tales always tug at the imagination, but also because Dr. Fallico turns out to be an incredible storyteller. For Mr. Herzog, it's clear that the truth of this story isn't located just in the facts that the doctor strings together with florid gestures and pregnant pauses, but in a performance that is as artful as it is true.  Treadwell's adventures among his beloved grizzlies were also a kind of performance, built on lies and truth and played out on the stage of celebrity. Even though his choices were dangerous and finally fatal, he traveled a familiar American path shaped by boundless optimism and an almost religious belief in the self. He lived among grizzlies because he believed that he could. Given this, the cheap shots that followed his death, including the appalling snarkiness that crept  into newspaper headlines ("Grizzly bear that killed pair attacked at lunchtime"), are revelatory. For some, Treadwell's death confirmed that animal activists and environmentalists are dangerous wackos; for others, though, his unhappy end may have suggested something equally disturbing: sometimes a smile and  American goodwill aren't enough.  Throughout "Grizzly Man," men and women pay testament to Treadwell's niceness and naïveté. Some are kind; others less so. Each testifier seems to capture some authentic quality of Treadwell, who from the evidence of his videos and Mr. Herzog's sympathetic inquiry, seemed equally nice and naïve, brave and foolish. At some point that foolishness mushroomed into a welter of delusions about his power to survive the wilderness in which he so recklessly tried to find himself. His death, as inevitable as it was preventable, could mean that he may have been more lost than found. Mr. Herzog remains generous to a fault on this particular point, perhaps because he recognizes that for someone like Treadwell, there is nothing more terrifying than being ordinary, even the claws of a grizzly.  "Grizzly Man" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some adult language and vivid descriptions of a bear mauling.
Closing out this summer's Werner Herzog  hat trick, Grizzly Man  is something of an anomaly in the man's encyclopedic nonfiction corpus. Formally speaking, Herzog has always been the most guileless documentarian to climb an erupting volcanothere has never been a pretense of fly-on-the-wall objectivity, talking heads are rare, the political is almost always flipped for the absurdly epic personal. By the same token, he's been a fundamentally resourceful experience-maker, preferring firsthand fortune and catastrophe but never above employing news footage, archival materials, others' films, even clips from his own features and opera productions. All the same, Grizzly Man  must be seen as Herzog's first authentic found-footage moviethe majority of it is videotape shot by Timothy Treadwell , the amateur conservationist and budding tele-zoologist who was killed and eaten by a grizzly bear in 2003. Herzog admits admiration for Treadwell's camerawork, considering him more of a compatriot than a subject, but the film is nevertheless the work of two men, two competing visions, two antithetical agendas.
Many of Herzog's essays have a primal elementalism to them that suggests they could've happened in a pre-electronic- mediated world, or even within a pre-cinematic mind-set. Not so with Grizzly Man the dirty fingerprints of celebrity hunger, 24-7 broadcasting, and nature-as-commodity market-think are all over it. Which is precisely why the stubbornly renegade Herzog is the righteous choice for reconsidering Treadwell's dismaying odyssey to the frontier. A failed actor, ex-surfer, and soul-searching recovered drinker, Treadwell found satisfaction and meaning establishing a grassroots preservationist organization on behalf of Alaskan grizzlies and, most vitally, spending 13 long summers living unarmed among the animals in Katmai National Park . He began recording his adventures in 1999, shooting the beasts hunting salmon and mating and filming himself for hundreds of hours talking about the bears to the camera as if he were in fact taping a television show.
Treadwell's shade-wearing, sandy-haired dude persona, complete with high-pitched kid-show delivery and fierce Rousseauian idealism, is extraordinarily compelling, particularly when one of the 800-pound animals he so childishly praises creeps up behind him on camera. His post-game wrap-up after a hair-raising battle between male bears is priceless, and his genuine determination to stand off when bears get too close is mesmerizing. But it's not merely the disconnect between Treadwell's Mutual of Omaha  na and the potential for feral disaster that gains momentum as Herzog's film progresses; it's clear that Treadwell, alone and self-sanctifying in the woods with only a lens to talk to, identifies more with the bears than with the society that had in effect exiled him. His way of mooning over the beasts, giving them preschool names like Mr. Chocolate and relentlessly declaring that he's "protecting" them, suggests acres about why Treadwell abandoned the company of people. Raving paranoia, against the government, tourists, would-be poachers, other activists, and anyone else in reach, seems inevitable. Meanwhile, his mission in the wilderness is persistently constructed as a Discovery Channel  series, one that was never green-lit but got filmed all the same, often beautifully. Grizzly Man  is many things, including a much more resonant and complex portrait of TV-poisoned narcissism than Tarnation .
For many the question remains about how Treadwell's eventual death should be regardedas a tragedy, as a fool's fate, or as comeuppance for daring to humanize wild predators and habituating them to human presence. Herzog's perspective is, of course, scrupulously nonjudgmental. He doesn't share with us the audio of the killing (in which Treadwell's girlfriend, Amie Huguenard , was also torn up and eaten), but instead grimly listens to it on camera, and then instructs a surviving ex-girlfriend to destroy the tape immediately. Mysteries, like The White Diamond 's unseen waterfall caverns or the Aborigine totem that would end the world if glimpsed by a white man in Where the Green Ants Dream , are worth keeping secret.
Herzog and Treadwell occupy polar camps; fascinated though he may be by the beauty and hellfire of natural forces, Herzog is no naturalist. His career project reflects a bitterly pragmatic view of nature as ravenous, amoral, and empty-headedhardly a viewpoint sellable to cable-TV-watching schoolkids. Herzog's strong-armed interventions in Grizzly Man  say as much, cutting off Treadwell's original sound in one close-up of a bear: "I must disagree with Treadwell here," he grumbles, launching into a diatribe about the essential inhumanity of wild animals. "I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature." Regarding the bears as deus ex machina within Treadwell's bizarre saga, Herzog asserts again one of modern moviedom's wisest, plainest humanistic sensibilities, sympathetic to man's never ending war with the planet but aware that the struggle will always draw ambiguous blood. Treadwell is simply another lost foot soldier, killed in the ongoing collision between human obsession and untamed reality.
