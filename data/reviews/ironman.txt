He has not lost his mind. He can see; he is not blind. He can walk; he will not fall. He is so alive you can see the thoughts in his head, and, boy oh boy, you should care because he's the best actor of his generation. Bloodied but unbowed, wounded but walking, Downey Jr.'s sly take on Marvel Comics' cold warrior Iron Man
 elevates everything about this film. The actor's real-life troubles merge with those of Iron Man's alter ego, Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy and military industrialist with a drinking problem, and the result is, no pun intended, riveting. As a comic-book character, Iron Man never quite scaled the dime-store racks like Batman, Spider-Man, or any of Marvel/DC's other lantern-jawed megamen. His debut in Tales of Suspense #39
 in 1963 was cool, to be sure, but not quite as cool as, say, Jim Steranko's vivid, hallucinatory Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
 But the iron Avenger-to-be quickly fine-tuned his original battleship-gray supersuit and, Dewar's in hand, repulsor beams at the ready, and gal Friday Pepper Potts (played onscreen by Paltrow) by his side, went on to fight the good fight and stuck it out. Favreau's screen version is a magnificent origin story that holds its own just fine against Bryan Singer's convoluted X-Men
 and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man
, and there are moments of both stunning action and earnest, subtle emotion. It's Downey Jr.'s show all the way, though. He twins the self-involved Stark with his own personal history to create a semiautobiographical un-Superman. Both men, reel and real, were critically wounded by their own hands, had an epiphany, dropped by a Burger King for a nosh, and then cleaned up their acts, but good. It's that subtext, alongside Downey Jr.'s unyielding charm and subtle underplaying of his role, that lodges in your mind. Well, that and Iron Man's first battle, his jerry-rigged, flame-throwing escape from an Afghanistan cave. Kudos, too, to Bridges, who, as baddie munitions magnate Obadiah Stane, almost (but not quite) steals a scene or two out from under his clanking co-star. And Favreau? If you'd told me 12 years ago that Swingers
' comic linchpin would end up helming one of the best, most visceral, and downright fun forays of all the comic-book franchises waiting in the CGI wings, I'd have told you to amscray, kid. But what the hell? Turns out irony's good for your blood.


As the playboy-turned-heavy-metal superhero, Robert Downey Jr. brings 'Iron Man' to life
As you might expect, "Iron Man" is an elemental affair. The ear for dialogue is tin. The directing contains lead. The gases released are mostly sulfuric (although a few of them turn out to be noble). And it all mixes to form that complex compound whose formula we know by heart: the superhero blockbuster. I liked "Iron Man," but the I-know-it-by-heart part makes it somewhat resistible. It's entertainment out of a jar.
Even though the movie makes an admirable bid for political topicality by retrofitting the struggles of its Marvel Comics hero for our current wars, and even though the fantastic Robert Downey Jr. plays our slutty, metallic superhero, there's a sameness to it that makes the entire enterprise seem obligatory. Close your eyes, and it's "Superman Begins: Rise of the Silver Daredevil 3." Even the hard rock of the film's score sounds like heavy Muzak.
Downey is Tony Stark, a billionaire playboy, brilliant scientist, and extreme ly successful weapons manufacturer who lives in a sleek modernist fortress on a seaside cliff. On a trip to introduce a new slate of weapons in Afghanistan, Tony is kidnapped and locked for three months in a cave, by terrorists who demand that he replicate one of his designs. Instead, with his helper, Yinsen (Shaun Toub), he builds a giant iron suit and throws the insurgents around.
Tony returns to America appalled at the reach of his military-industrial success and decides to stop selling weapons. How he could not have known he was doing such a bang-up job as a warmonger is a mystery. But his about-face might have something to do with the glowing electromagnetic amulet in his chest keeping his heart clear of shrapnel left by a bomb his kidnappers set to trap him. Tony's a big softie now, ready, even, to consider real love with his assistant, "Pepper" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile, shares in Stark Industries plummet, and Tony's stupendously bald partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), pushes him aside to restore profitability.
What we have in parts of "Iron Man" is a nifty critique of corporate amorality, with remorseful Tony bound to square off against heartless Obadiah. Indeed the film's supervillain is a double-dealing big-business titan. But the most interesting action sequence requires Iron Man to save an Afghan village from the terrorists who threaten to tear families apart. It's cheesy and absurd (Iron Man has a lot of RoboCop in him). It's also effective. The international humanitarianism acknowledges that the sky sometimes falls in places other than New York.
So kudos to the actor-director Jon Favreau and his four credited screenwriters for trying to raise the blockbuster consciousness, although most of the good and excellent superhero films have politics or allegory on their minds (even that last, execrable "Fantastic Four" movie gave us a waterboarding sequence). "Iron Man" isn't remotely as adventurous as the Marvel series, which debuted in 1968, and which has had Tony Stark wrestle with alcoholism, Communism, Vietnam, and destructive misappropriations of the Iron Man armor - a few years ago going so far as to accept a secretary of defense appointment to do so.
Favreau and his team know they have to entertain us, too. But rather than craft a sci-fi action-drama out of geopolitics, they spray the movie with Teflon and complete a checklist: Cool toys? Here. Expensive effects? Check. Damsel with a twist of distress? Yup. Climactic nighttime brawl straight out of "Superman II" (but badly staged)? Got it. Incoherent plot? You bet. Some activity for Terrence Howard, who plays Jim Rhodes, Tony's Air Force-commander best friend, besides talking to Tony on phones? OK, they missed one.
Favreau is actually best in "Swingers" mode, when, say, the camera pulls back from Downey and Howard and reveals that what we think is a nightclub party is actually a strip joint on Stark's private jet. You half-expect Vince Vaughn to erupt from the cockpit.
Otherwise, Howard, Paltrow, and Bridges are in purely functional positions. It's odd seeing Paltrow gloss her way through what is basically an ingenue part - the sort of role that has enough to it to warrant a smart actor but not enough to keep you from noticing that Paltrow can do anything convincingly except stand around and be helpless. I swear I saw her check her watch once. Bridges undercooks his part, as if he's warming up to the idea of embodying evil. His bald head is consistently arresting. I wanted to crack it open and make an omelet.
But the movie is ultimately distinguished by its star. Either through uncertainty or misdirection, actors who play superheroes tend to let the technical departments steal the show. Out of their suits, the Christian Bales of the world still seem masked. Downey appears to like all this make-believe. Even the clunky dialogue sounds witty out of his mouth. This is not a part that makes great demands on his talent, and his slummy approach to it is amusing.
Downey could have taken a tragic tack. But he has fun just figuring out how to make the armor suit work. His sarcasm and almost drunken Tony Curtis body language transform the scenes of Iron Man flame-throwing or flying around: You believe it's Downey in there. And in case you don't, the cinematographer Matthew Libatique gives us Martin Schoeller-like images of the actor's face and eyes aglow beneath equipment and graphics. For such a standard, clumsy picture, the beauty in those shots is ludicrous. You expect to see a bunch of circuitry, and you get a flash of soul.


After Tobey Maguire's gawky boyishness and Christian Bale's glower, the ''offbeat'' casting of comic-book films is now the new normal. (The trend really started back in 1989, when Tim Burton turned a saucer-eyed noodge like Michael Keaton into Batman.) Yet it's still bracing to see Robert Downey Jr.   redefine what it takes to be a superhero in Iron Man . As Tony Stark, a high-living celebrity weapons magnate who is wounded on a trek through Afghanistan, only to transform himself into a hulking mechanical rocket man, Downey doesn't dial down his eager narcissistic wit. Wearing a goatee right out of the beatnik '50s, he's fast and frictionless, as airlessly ironic as a talk-show host who's been shoved onto the air at 3 a.m. and left to his own what-the-hell devices. The key to Downey's mocking, crumpled charm is that no matter whom he's talking to, he's really just nattering to himself. When he climbs into his Iron Man machine suit, with its whirring, clicking limbs and plated chest, flamethrower arms, and mask of a medieval knight, he doesn't disappear behind the tin-can walls of that chunky, atomic-age jet-pack robot. He's still there, a deftly fragile motormouth  a damaged soul who needs armor to fully become himself.
Just about every classic comic-book superhero is, at heart, a Jekyll-and-Hyde, divided between ineffectuality and power. Too often, however, the movies adapted from comic books come with their own split personalities. There's the flat, prosaic story, with all that overbright franchise lighting and actors like Tobey Maguire doing their best to charm us in thinly scripted regular-guy roles. And then there are the special-effects parts, when suddenly we're asked to believe that a man can fly, or shimmy up walls, or dissolve into particles, even as we remain naggingly aware that we're watching a digital extravaganza that has little to do with mopey nice-guy acting.
The fun of Iron Man , a Marvel adaptation in which a routine arc has been burnished with great elegance and skill, is the way that it heals the split, soldering the two halves of its hero into a single organically driven figure. On that fateful Afghan jaunt, Downey's Stark is wounded by one of his own bombs, then kidnapped and taken to an insurgent lair, where a magnetized gizmo is surgically implanted in his chest, all to keep the bits of shrapnel from heading toward his heart. To fool his captors, he pretends to construct the cluster bomb they demand, but instead he builds himself a mechanical alter ego and flies to freedom. Back at his hillside mansion (one of many clever details  it's out of vintage Bond), Stark then erects a new, improved version, with a two-toned shell and computerized mask. His desire? To destroy the weapons that he once created. He becomes a rock-'em sock-'em robot for peace.
The director, Jon Favreau  , doesn't exactly have a big sci-fi track record  he wrote and starred in Swingers  , and also directed Elf    but he draws on his humanistic gifts to make Iron Man "] a compellingly down-to-earth superhero fantasy. The effects sequences, in which Iron Man zips through the air like a toaster that's been shot out of a cannon, are ingenious enough to never let us forget that this gold-titanium hulk has been built , from the ground up. (When he takes off, you feel the quivering smoky thrust of his engines.) The story line is, to put it mildly, familiar, with all the episode-one bona fides ticking into place. Yet Favreau's direction never feels rote, even during the sky-zipping, metal-smashing action scenes, and the casting is aces. Jeff Bridges  , as Stark's corporate partner, looks as scary as a cult leader in his shaved head and bushy beard, but he underacts, benignly; Bridges uses that wry, trust-me voice to create a timely portrait of stylish power. And Gwyneth Paltrow  , as Pepper Potts, Stark's selfless girl Friday, manages the neat trick of taking a character who's a prefeminist throwback and playing her with a liberated twinkle. When Pepper replaces Stark's glowing electric heart device, it's a nifty, squishy gross-out and  a terrific love scene. Too often, superhero films feel like a different species of entertainment from the smudged comic books that spawned them. Iron Man  takes you back to the days when you sprawled out in front of those books, flipping through the adventures of a dude who was too vital, and vulnerable, to ever be a mere F/X object. Even at his coolest, Downey's Iron Man remains a ghostly, neurotic crusader  one whose life, in the Marvel tradition, has become a grand spectacle of overcompensation.

 The world at the moment does not suffer from a shortage of superheroes. And yet in some ways the glut of anti-evil crusaders with cool costumes and troubled souls takes the pressure off of “Iron Man,” which clanks  into theaters today ahead of Hellboy, Batman and the Incredible Hulk. This summer those guys are all in sequels or redos, so Iron Man (a Marvel property not to be confused with the Man of Steel, who belongs to DC and who’s taking a break this year) has the advantage of novelty in addition to a seasonal head start.  And “Iron Man,” directed by Jon Favreau (“Elf,” “Zathura”), has the advantage of being an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least — since it certainly has its problems — a superhero movie that’s good in unusual ways. The film benefits from a script (credited to Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) that generally chooses clever dialogue over manufactured catchphrases and lumbering exposition, and also from a crackerjack cast that accepts the filmmakers’ invitation to do some real acting rather than just flex and glower and shriek for a paycheck.  There’s some of that too, of course. The hero must flex and furrow his brow; the bad guy must glower and scheme; the girl must shriek and fret. There should also be a skeptical but supportive friend. Those are the rules of the genre, as unbreakable as the pseudoscientific principles that explain everything (An arc reactor! Of course!) and the Law of the Bald Villain. In “Iron Man” it all plays out more or less as expected, from the trial-and-error building of the costume to the climactic showdown, with lots of flying, chasing and noisemaking in between. (I note that there is one sharp, subversive surprise right at the very end.)  What is less expected is that Mr. Favreau, somewhat in the manner of those sly studio-era craftsmen who kept their artistry close to the vest so the bosses wouldn’t confiscate it, wears the genre paradigm as a light cloak rather than a suit of iron. Instead of the tedious, moralizing, pop-Freudian origin story we often get in the first installments of comic-book-franchise movies — childhood trauma; identity crisis; longing for justice versus thirst for revenge; wake me up when the explosions start — “Iron Man” plunges us immediately into a world that crackles with character and incident.  It is not quite the real world, but it’s a bit closer than Gotham or Metropolis. We catch up with Tony Stark in dusty Afghanistan, where he is enjoying a Scotch on the rocks in the back of an armored American military vehicle. Tony is a media celebrity, a former M.I.T. whiz kid and the scion of a family whose company makes and sells high-tech weaponry. He’s also a bon vivant and an incorrigible playboy. On paper the character is completely preposterous, but since Tony is played by Robert Downey Jr., he’s almost immediately as authentic and familiar — as much fun, as much trouble — as your ex-boyfriend or your old college roommate. Yeah, that guy.  Tony’s skeptical friend (see above) is Rhodey, an Air Force officer played with good-humored sidekick weariness by Terrence Howard. The girl is one Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, also in evident good humor), Tony’s smitten, ultracompetent assistant. His partner and sort-of mentor in Stark Enterprises is Obadiah Stane, played by Jeff Bridges with wit and exuberance and — spoiler alert! — a shaved head.  These are all first-rate actors, and Mr. Downey’s antic energy and emotional unpredictability bring out their agility and resourcefulness. Within the big, crowded movements of this pop symphony is a series of brilliant duets that sometimes seem to have the swing and spontaneity of jazz improvisation: Mr. Downey and Ms. Paltrow on the dance floor; Mr. Downey and Mr. Howard drinking sake on an airplane; Mr. Downey and Shaun Toub working on blueprints in a cave; Mr. Downey and Mr. Bridges sparring over a box of pizza.  Those moments are what you are likely to remember. The plot is serviceable, which is to say that it’s placed at the service of the actors (and the special-effects artists), who deftly toss it around and sometimes forget it’s there. One important twist seems glaringly arbitrary and unmotivated, but this lapse may represent an act of carefree sabotage rather than carelessness. You know this ostensibly shocking revelation is coming, and the writers know you know it’s coming, so why worry too much about whether it makes sense? Similarly, the patina of geopolitical relevance is worn thin and eventually discarded, and Tony’s crisis of conscience when he discovers what his weapons are being used for is more of a narrative convenience than a real moral theme.  All of which is to say that “Iron Man,” in spite of the heavy encumbrances Tony must wear when he turns into the title character, is distinguished by light touches and grace notes. The hardware is impressive, don’t get me wrong, but at these prices it had better be. If you’re throwing around a hundred million dollars and you have Batman and the Hulk on your tail, you had better be sure that the arc reactors are in good working order and that the gold-titanium alloy suit gleams like new and flies like a bird.  And everything works pretty well. But even dazzling, computer-aided visual effects, these days, are not so special. And who doesn’t have superpowers? Actually, Iron Man doesn’t; his heroism is all handicraft, elbow grease and applied intelligence. Those things account for the best parts of “Iron Man” as well.  “Iron Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of action violence, none of it especially graphic or gruesome. Also, Iron Man has sex, and not with the suit on. But not completely naked either.

Finally, someone�s found a sure-fire way to make money with a modern Middle East war movie: Just send a Marvel superhero into the fray to kick some insurgent butt. The powerhouse comicbook-inspired actioner �Iron Man� isn�t principally about this fantasy, but it won�t hurt at least American audiences� enjoyment of this expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza. Having an actor as supercharged as Robert Downey Jr. at the center of such a tech-oriented enterprise reps a huge plus, and Paramount should reap big B.O. rewards by getting out ahead of the summer tentpole pack with such a classy refitting of an overworked format.
It�s refreshing, for a start, that the character suddenly endowed with superpowers isn�t a dweeby teen, but rather a pushing-middle-age genius who is himself entirely responsible for the advanced means he acquires to combat his adversaries; even more than the latest incarnation of Batman, he�s a self-made superman. And while we�ve seen plenty of masks and gravity-resistant heroes before, the outfit sported by the main man here, which looks as though it was made by a top ski boot manufacturer, is striking and capable of great things.
Half-hour setup neatly dovetails essential character background with the flawed hero�s extreme imperilment. Imperious, sarcastic and arrogant, Tony Stark (Downey) creates the world�s most sophisticated weapons for the U.S. Army. A boozer and brash ladies� man, the gazillionaire (originally based to a great extent on Howard Hughes) inherited Stark Industries from his late father and runs the company with his dad�s partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Praised as a technological Da Vinci and reviled as �the merchant of death,� this is a man who always gets what he wants.
On a demonstration trip to Afghanistan, however, Tony is ambushed and kidnapped by swarthy insurgent types who take him to a cave, connect him to a bomb and command him to make them his latest and greatest weapon. Despite being closely watched, the devious dude surreptitiously creates a sort of high-tech armor suit that turns him into �a destructive Robbie the Robot� and enables him to thwart his captors and fly off into the desert, where he promptly crashes before being rescued by Yanks.
Tony arrives back home a changed man. Revealing that during captivity he �realized I have more to offer the world than making things that blow up,� Tony announces his exit from the arms business, which sends his huge firm�s stock plummeting and pits the ruthless Obadiah against him. 
Trying to settle on what to do with his life, Tony begins fashioning a more sophisticated version of his jerry-rigged suit, and one of the film�s most delightful scenes has him making a trial run in his warehouse; seamless visual effects allow an encased Tony to hover and rocket around via boot and glove jets. In a memorable maiden voyage, he zooms out of his Malibu h.q. and shoots above Santa Monica on his way to testing the outer atmospheric limits of his marvelous invention.
At the same time, the bad boys back in Afghanistan are patching together the broken remains of Tony�s original improvised suit and wreaking havoc on the local populace with a cache of stolen Stark weapons. It�s easy to see where this is headed, and it isn�t long before Tony is high-flying it back for a little precision target practice at the expense of the nasties. (Only the snide will wonder why he doesn�t stop off in Iraq on the way home to put things in order there.) 
Foreign kidnap-and-revenge format actually recycles the initial �Iron Man� storyline from the April 1963 Marvel comic, in which the heavies were Vietcong. Current villains do not espouse any particular religion or ideology, although their leader, the bald-headed Raza (Faran Tahir), professes a desire to become the new Genghis Khan.
Tony�s self-appointed role as international enforcer doesn�t go down well with U.S. officials, including his Pentagon pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), and another action highlight has supersonic Iron Man in a wild dogfight with a couple of American fighter jets.
With foreign devils out of the way, at least for the moment, the final act�s dynamic pits Tony against turncoat Obadiah. Although kids will probably like it, the climactic giant suit vs. giant suit battle, which, with its machines� multitude of moving parts and resultant clanging metal smacks all too much of �Transformers,� is the pic�s only disappointment. 
Talent lineup on both sides of the camera injects familiar conceits with fresh energy and stylistic polish. The work of two screenwriting teams -- Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (�Children of Men�) and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway -- have been blended effectively to keep the plot moving and provide motor-mouthed Downey with plenty of snappy dialogue. Ever-eclectic director Jon Favreau, who briefly pops up onscreen as a Stark minion, maintains a brisk but not frantic pace, and, in concert with lenser Matthew Libatique, production designer J. Michael Riva and the first-rate visual effects team, has made an unusually elegant looking film for the genre.
Snapping off lines as crisply as Bugs Bunny might bite into a carrot, the sculpture-bearded Downey invigorates the entire proceedings in a way no other actor ever has in this field. Initially conveying Tony�s Matt Helm lifestyle as if it�s second nature, Downey possesses a one-of-a-kind intensity that perfectly serves the character�s second-act drive and obstinacy. His Achilles� heel is his heart, at first threatened by shrapnel and later central to his superpower and his submerged romantic relationship with ever-loyal assistant Pepper Potts, who Gwyneth Paltrow, in an unexpected casting move, endows with smarts and appeal.
Shaven-headed and sporting a bushy beard in a way that makes him rather resemble Bruce Willis, Bridges is an imposing antagonist. Other roles, including Howard�s second-billed Army officer, are one-dimensional.
All tech credits are tops. 


Chalk it up to personal preference, but I've always been fonder of those comic-book heroes who emerge by intent rather than happenstance. I mean the ones, like Batman 's Bruce Wayne , whose transformation from average Joe into masked crusader is an act of will instead of the unintended result of a genetic mutation, a spider bite, or a meteor ride to earth from the outer reaches of the galaxy; the ones who, underneath the metallic breastplates and layers of spandex, remain ordinary bone and sinew.
Tony Stark, the unlikely hero of the Iron Man  comics co-created by Stan Lee , Larry Lieber , Don Heck , and Jack Kirby , is one such creation. A boy-genius inventor and heir to a weapons-manufacturing empire, Stark initially conceives of his crime-fighting alter-ego in an act of life-saving self-preservation, donning a makeshift suit of rocket-powered armor in order to escape from the bad guys who've abducted him during a Stark Industries  field test. Nothing if not a product of his foreign-policy moment, Stark first appeared in the March 1963 issue of Marvel's Tales of Suspense , just in time to fight the encroaching Red menace in Southeast Asia . In the 2008 film version of Iron Man , directed by Jon Favreau , Stark finds himself at odds with Afghan insurgents called the Ten Rings who, in a wonderful Taliban -era irony, come armed with a black-market supply of Stark's own war machines.
Where Lee and his collaborators based Stark in part on Howard Hughes , the 21st-century version embodied here by Robert Downey Jr.  is more like a defense-industry Mark Cuban  or Richard Branson —a coiffed and tanned, media-savvy technocrat whose too-cool-for-the-planet attitude says that as long as the market is up and we're kicking Charlie's (or Hadji's) ass, it doesn't much matter how we're doing it. But Stark soon gets his comeuppance in a desert-chic cave where, his shrapnel-riddled heart kept a-ticking by a jerry-rigged electromagnet and a Ten Rings doyen demanding a custom-built smart bomb from Stark's newly deployed "Freedom line," he realizes that maybe WMDs aren't so great after all.
Though he remains best known for writing and co-starring in 1996's hipster totem Swingers , Favreau honed his directing chops with a couple of richly imaginative, resolutely lo-fi kids movies, Elf  and Zathura . If the larger-scale, bigger-budget Iron Man  never quite ascends to those heights of tinsel-and-string splendiferousness, it maintains Favreau's fondness for the handmade over the prefab, for erector sets over CRPGs. It's an exemplary comic-book fantasia. There's plenty of CGI to go around, but Favreau uses it, for the most part, to enhance rather than supplant the movie's physical dimension.
When Stark returns to his sprawling Malibu  mansion/laboratory—a sort of sun-and-surf Batcave—to perfect the prototype, Favreau gives the sequence the slapstick ping of early Blake Edwards  or Frank Tashlin . And Downey is—as he is in most of the film—a marvel to watch here, his body a shimmying human jello mold as he tries to get the hang of his newly jet-propelled hands and feet, his face a kaleidoscope of exhilaration and terror. He's like a kid without training wheels for the first time, but also like a man newly resolved to make something meaningful out of his life. More than once in Iron Man , you get the feeling the actor may have seen, in Tony Stark , a serio-comic surrogate for his own very public rehabilitation.
The movie—and I mean this as the highest possible compliment to Favreau and the four credited screenwriters—uses the better part of an hour to really  get going. Rather than cutting directly to the chase, it takes its time to involve us in the characters, who are relatively three-dimensional as comic-book movies go, and are played by the kind of actors who know how to make a lot out of not very much. As Stark's dutiful, waiting-to-be-unbuttoned girl Friday, Gwyneth Paltrow  is particularly appealing, while the ever-reliable Jeff Bridges  manages to invest a glimmer of conflicted humanity in a role that all but comes with "Villain" stamped on its forehead. Even when the plot of Iron Man  kowtows to convention, the movie's personality—hip to the times without ever resorting to self-congratulatory snark—keeps it zipping along. Rarer than a grown man in a rocket suit, it's a summer blockbuster that comes to entertain first and shill second.
Just about a year ago at this time, another summer tent-pole that climaxed with giant robots body-slamming each other on the streets of Los Angeles was making its way into cinemas amid much clamor from critics that, no matter what they wrote, people would go see it anyway. The movie was called Transformers —perhaps you've heard of it. Iron Man , too, is something that people will see regardless of the reviews, but here is the point: Where Michael Bay  has mastered a kind of sensory-assaulting pop art, Favreau is a born storyteller who engages the audience's imagination rather than crushing it in a tsunami of digital noise. He gives us giant robots we can actually care about as opposed to those we can scarcely tell apart—and that, I would propose, is the difference between making images and making movies.
