Roughly 460 terror suspects are currently detained at the American prison camps in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. To protest what they say is abusive treatment and their negligible legal access (some of them might be guilty, but there's scarcely a court of law to prove it), detainees have waged hunger strikes and made suicide attempts, none of which were successful until earlier this month. Three detainees hanged themselves.
Lawyers say misery drove them to do it. The US military considered it an act of warfare, with top officials notoriously describing it as a ``good PR move to draw attention" and ``to further the jihadi cause." Truth or spin? Who can say? But if ``The Road to Guantanamo" is even a tad accurate , I'm inclined to think they succumbed to despair.
The film dramatizes the true, gruesome plight of a group of young men who wound up detained at the camps. Ruhel Ahmed, Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, and Monir Ali head from the town of Tipton in the British Midlands, to Pakistan, where one of them is to be married.
The actual detainees narrate the picture in documentary cutaways, but the actors playing them -- Farhad Harun, Riz Ahmed, Afran Usman, and Waqar Siddiqui -- make a jovial quartet. Under happier circumstances, directors Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross might have refashioned ``A Hard Day's Night" around them.
But these are different times. The trip happens in the weeks after 9/11, during the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan. At the urging of a cleric they overhear preaching at a mosque, they go to Afghanistan with the ambiguous intention of ``helping out." The boys hit Kandahar for a day, then, after an eternal van ride, Kabul. Amid the air strikes, it dawns on them that they're not benefiting anyone. How could they? They're tired, unarmed, and dislocated.
They decide to head back to Pakistan, losing Monir somewhere along the way. (He's never found.) The van that Shafiq, Ruhel, and Asif hop into takes them, instead, to a crowded Taliban outpost in the Afghan hinterlands, where, upon the surrender of Taliban fighters, they're turned over, along with dozens of other non-Taliban men, to the Northern Alliance.
 After a grueling day-and-a-half trip in a huge, dark, and stifling storage container, they're handed off to the US military.
In American (and eventually British) custody, the men are treated more viciously. Sacks are pulled over their heads , and their arms are shackled behind their backs, as they're locked up first at Camp X-Ray , then at Camp Delta, where they're kept outside in cages like dogs at a kennel. Ruhel calls it a zoo, but a zoo at least allows visitors. Detainees' senses are deprived (goggles stay on even in the shower), and the indefinite stay forbids prayer, standing, and talking to your neighbor. In all, we get a jarring sense of the extreme horrors committed at Abu Ghraib and in Haditha.
Watching these and other humiliations, a viewer's awareness of the way the film switches between the actors and the interviews evaporates. The prolific Winterbottom, whose recent projects (``9 Songs," ``Tristram Shandy") have been eccentric excursions, creates a simple and brisk descent into hell. And the immediacy gets under your skin.
Only when the American s and British arrive, with their theatrical demands, does self-consciousness fog up the film's naturalist ic facade. The actors playing the interrogators, especially the American ones, go for a stock villainy: ``You're Al Qaeda! . . . Now tell me where Osama bin Laden is!" One gratuitously smokes a cigarette during his interrogation.
Another condescends during hers: ``I come from Wash
ington ," she announces, as if she'd just gotten off a flying saucer. Her session with one detainee is outlandish in a Nancy Grace sort of way. She shows him unintelligibly grainy video footage of an Al Qaeda rally and tells him to identify himself, which, of course, he can't. ``I can see you
!" she says.
``The Road to Guantanamo" makes it inarguably clear why these men need lawyers. They're never charged with any crime, yet they're serving a harsh sentence. Due process here seems like a pipe dream. But nobody falls for the military's obvious entrapment. They remain pretty strong throughout, especially Shafiq, who, in a great moment, performs a rap about his detention to an increasing ly uncomfortable American soldier. The film makes sure that we never lose sight of the men's humanity, even though they're repeatedly robbed of it. The Tipton Three, as Shafiq, Ruhel, and Asif were called in the British press, also say that their Guantanamo experience made them better Muslims.
As strongly as the movie argues that the prison should be closed, if only as a matter of remorseful political symbolism, ``Road to Guantanamo" is even more chilling as a snapshot of how the world changed for average Arab and Muslim men after 9/11. The film's insistence on the men's innocence is matter of fact. But it's also an urgent corrective to the suspicious eye the movies so often cast on Arabs and Islam. I don't know what the US military's brass would say, but that is
 good PR.

         Prolific British director Michael Winterbottom's "The Road to Guantanamo" is a visceral first-person account of what happened to three British teenagers shortly before and for a long time after they were captured by American forces while traveling in Afghanistan in 2001. Detained for three years without charge in Cuba, where they were tortured and denied access to lawyers or their families, they were eventually released and returned to England. The recent suicides in Guantanamo make this film especially timely.
 
  Although its methodology raises some questions, "The Road to Guantanamo" provides a riveting glimpse into a heavily shrouded political and moral quagmire that deepens by the day. If history has established the banality of evil, "The Road to Guantanamo" illustrates its rank stupidity.
 


         






    Co-directed with Mat Whitecross, the film mixes interviews with dramatic re-enactments of the events the young men describe and news footage to create a vivid picture of the chaos, confusion and political opportunism that resulted in their arrest. The film's setup is brief and direct, an arrow pointing to a foregone conclusion. "750 men from 40 different countries are being held in Guantanamo.... Many of them were sold to the United States by Afghanistan's Northern Alliance for $5,000 a head." This information is followed by a news clip of President Bush saying, "The only thing I know for certain is that these are some bad people."
 
  But here are some not so bad people: Asif Iqbal (portrayed in the reenactments by Arfan Usman) was 19 on Sept. 10, 2001, when his mother returned to Tipton, England, from her native Pakistan with news that she had found a bride for him. Asif traveled to Pakistan to meet her, and decided to go ahead with the marriage. He called his friend Ruhel Ahmed (Farhad Harun), then 19, to come be his best man. Ruhel invited two friends from Tipton, Shafiq Rasul (Riz Ahmed) and Monir Ali (Waqar Siddiqui), 23 and 22, to join him, and the three set out for Karachi.
 
  After spending a few days of shopping and sightseeing, the friends attend a mosque with Asif's Pakistani cousin, Zahid. Inspired by the Imam's call for volunteers to travel to Afghanistan and provide humanitarian aid, and sensing an excellent adventure, the friends decide to go to Kabul to help. Crossing the border by bus, they encounter another world, a bleak and bombed-out landscape that is just coming under attack by the United States.
 
  After their bus driver hits and kills a man on the road and abandons his passengers, the friends eventually reach Kandahar spooked and demoralized. A few days later, they travel to Kabul, where they wander for days with nothing to do. Concerned for Asif, who has become ill, they try to arrange for a ride back to Pakistan. Instead, they are taken north to Konduz, one of the last Taliban strongholds. As Konduz falls, three of the four friends (Monir disappears and is never heard from again) find themselves herded onto trucks.
 
  What happens next will be familiar to fans of stories of adventure gone horribly wrong. After a harrowing ordeal, Asif and Shafiq are handed over to the Americans. (Zahid is imprisoned in Pakistan.)
 
  Asif and Shafiq are initially relieved. Average Western teenagers, they have dutifully absorbed the messages the movies have taught them. "The Americans are all right," one of them says when they are turned over. "It's all right now." But they soon find themselves hooded, beaten and airlifted to Cuba, where they are placed in open-air cells at Camp X-Ray. There, detainees are forbidden to speak, pray, exercise or even look directly at the guards.
 
  The style of the dramatizations is raw and improvisational, lending the early part of the movie a documentary feel and giving a vivid sense of the young men's ordinariness. One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is how it touches, indirectly, on the problems faced by the children of immigrants, whose citizenship and national identity can be fragile under the wrong circumstances. In one scene, Asif is interviewed by an American official through a translator, who speaks to him in Urdu, his third language. He again has to point out that he speaks English.
 
  But there are some blunders on "The Road to Guantanamo." The movie front-loads its first-person accounts with a short list of facts to keep in mind as we watch, creating an imbalance that serves only to undercut the movie's overall credibility. And the actors playing the Americans are for the most part hopeless hams in roles as nuanced as blocks of wood. Given the official response to news from Guantanamo, you'd think Winterbottom and Whitecross would have been only too happy to let the powers that be have their say, as chances are they'd wind up making the friends' story that much more credible. As it is, you wonder if the directors are protesting a bit too much on behalf of the three.
 
  What does seem quite clear is that if Asif, Shafiq and Zahid fall into the category of "bad people," then the world doesn't have that much to fear. That's not to say they are angels — ironically, it's their police records that save them in the end. The questions that remained in my mind were these: What if, as the typical Western teenagers that they once were, the men were momentarily excited at the prospect of "fighting the power," or at least hanging around to see it get fought? What if they showed up and immediately realized the stupidity of that idea? In our country's zeal for punishment, at home and abroad, the field of what might, in a more liberal-minded time, be considered normal human behavior has consistently narrowed.
 
  An interesting undercurrent emerges that seems rife for exploration as political forces strain to categorize and differentiate people in an increasingly global world. As "typical" British teenagers, Asif, Ruhel and Shafiq wear Gap sweatshirts and Adidas tracksuits, listen to rap and speak in slang-heavy Birmingham accents. In Guantanamo, they are tortured with death metal played at deafening levels, and later, after they're cleared but before they're released, they're rewarded with Burger King and Pizza Hut. The idea that "American culture," which we've slowly allowed to be supplanted by corporate capitalism, has become a handy instrument of torture and as well as its hasty palliative is curious to say the least.
 
  And it seems worth noting that what seemed like a harebrained scheme when President Reagan used it against Manuel Noriega in the 1980s has become standard practice. As anyone who's ever been subjected to another's migraine-inducing music at ear-splitting levels knows, the ultimate effect is not breakdown or surrender but increased aggression. You don't want to die because your roommate won't let you sleep or think. You want to punch his lights out.
 
  Whether the story of the Tipton Three is typical, the film doesn't speculate. But their story illustrates how the shady and reductive policies of the war on terror can distort reality and obscure the facts so much that the problem that it sets out to solve is exacerbated by the methods employed to solve it.
 
 'Road to Guantanamo'
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for language and disturbing violent content   

   THE release of "The Road to Guantánamo" comes shortly after the suicides of three prisoners held in American custody in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in the midst of renewed concern, in the United States and abroad, about the mistreatment of detainees and the policy of holding suspected terrorists at the detention camp. In a sense, then, the film, which is based on the testimony of three British Muslims captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and held at Guantánamo for more than two years, does not tell us anything new. It is nonetheless a wrenching and dismaying account of cruelty and bureaucratic indifference, a graphic tour of a place many citizens of Western democracies would prefer not to think about.  It should be emphasized that the movie, directed by Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross, is not a documentary. It does rely on talking-head interviews with the former prisoners — Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Ruhel Ahmed, known collectively as the Tipton Three for the town in northern England where they grew up  — and faithfully reproduces their version of events. Most of what the audience sees on screen, however, is a re-enactment, conducted mainly by nonprofessional actors. By the time the action reaches Guantánamo — those scenes were shot in Iran — the artifice is unmistakable, since no camera could have penetrated the actual isolation cells, interrogation rooms and chicken-wire cages of Camps X-Ray and Delta. But earlier sequences in Pakistan and Afghanistan have the shaky, grainy urgency of real life captured on the fly.  This is not the first time Mr. Winterbottom has mingled the techniques of documentary and fictional filmmaking; he did it whimsically in his mischievous nonadaptation "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story," pruriently in the moodily hard-core "9 Songs" and soberly in "In This World," his grim chronicle of young refugees in flight from Afghanistan. Nor is he alone in teasing the cinematic boundary between storytelling and truth-telling. He seems to have been inspired at least partly by Iranian films like "Close-Up," "The Apple" and "Where Is the Friend's House?," which used ordinary people and on-location photography to recreate real events.    Those films can induce a kind of vertigo in the viewer, an almost philosophical confusion about the literalness of the filmed image. And "The Road to Guantánamo" can be disorienting, especially in its first half, as it switches back and forth between the recollections of the three main characters and the raw immediacy of their restaged ordeal. It is sometimes hard to match the speakers with the amateur actors playing them, or to establish a clear sense of who they are.  Curiously, their personalities emerge only in the dehumanized environment of Guantánamo itself, when their heads have been shaved and they are dressed in identical orange jumpsuits. There, as the combination of tedium and brutality stretches time and tests their endurance, the movie begins to gather the emotional force that is likely to leave you sickened, shaken and angry. For their part, the former detainees look back calmly and speak about their worst moments with a combination of detachment and puzzlement. How did this happen to them?  "The Road to Guantánamo," relying as it does on their testimony, does not entirely answer that question. In September 2001, Mr. Iqbal flew to Pakistan to meet the woman his mother had chosen for him to marry. Shortly afterward, Mr. Ahmed, who had agreed to be the best man at the wedding, arrived with two other friends, Mr. Rasul and Monir Ali.  The story of how they ended up in Afghanistan is left a bit hazy, in spite of vivid images of miserable bus rides over bumpy, unpaved roads. The idea of crossing the border into Afghanistan seems to have arisen almost on a whim. They wanted to see for themselves what was going on and to participate in a humanitarian aid mission organized by the imam of a  mosque in Karachi, Pakistan. Sitting in an outdoor restaurant one evening, they talk excitedly about the size of Afghan flatbreads, as if they were planning a culinary road trip.  As the war against the Taliban intensifies, the four young men travel first to Kandahar, then to Kabul and finally to Kunduz, where they are captured by Northern Alliance soldiers. At that point, an arduous, possibly ill-advised adventure turns into a nightmare, as they are first accused of being Al Qaeda fighters and then, after months of harsh treatment, coerced into confessing that they are.  There may still be some die-hards who respond to pictures of hooded prisoners and detailed accounts of physical and psychological abuse with accusations of anti-Americanism. The filmmakers and the Tipton Three are fairly circumspect with regard to their own political beliefs, but their ideological commitments are really beside the point. A news clip shows President Bush referring to the Guantánamo detainees as "bad guys," and it is not necessary to believe that the Tipton Three were good guys — one of them had a police record in Britain — to be appalled at their treatment.  And also profoundly depressed. "The Road to Guantánamo," while far from a great movie, nonetheless effectively dramatizes a position that has been argued, by principled commentators on the left and the right, for several years now: that the abuse of prisoners, innocent or not, is not only repugnant in its own right. It also squanders a crucial strategic advantage in the fight against terrorism, namely the moral superiority of liberal democracy to the nihilism and extremism that oppose it.  The facts on which "The Road to Guantánamo" is based are horrifying, and in its most effective moments it provokes strong feelings of helplessness and dread. But by far the scariest thing about this movie is that, for too many people in this country and elsewhere, it may already have lost the power to shock.  "The Road to Guantánamo" is rated R (Under 17 not admitted without a guardian) for language and violence.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

The true story of four British Muslim boys who go to Pakistan for a wedding and end up in Cuba as tortured prisoners of the U.S. Army is retold as a modern horror story in "The Road to Guantanamo." Powerfully co-directed by Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross, the film has a winning combo of excitement and topicality that should get it rolling through international theaters, backed by critical support and press coverage. 
Far more immediate than the news accounts that have been circulating, this graphic depiction of prisoner abuse at Camp X-Ray and Camp Delta is a punch in the gut meant to shock auds. Yet film also has a very British reticence that keeps it away from simple sensationalism.
For example, there is barely a nod at reports of sexual humiliation and no mention at all of prisoners dying. Nor does it go out of its way to demonize individual soldiers or their superiors, thus leaving Bush, Blair and Rumsfeld, who appear in newsreel footage, holding the buck for blatantly trampling on the Geneva Convention and human rights.
Closest in spirit to Winterbottom's Mideast immigration saga "In This World," this is a much more gripping watch. The actual protags of the story, who spent over two years in Guantanamo Bay before being released as innocent, tell what happened in head shots intercut with a fictional re-creation of events. Ruhel Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul were 20-year-olds when, together with their friend Monir, left their native England to attend Asif's wedding in Pakistan.
Their adventure begins in September 2001 in Karachi. Having a ball-playing tourist, they head off for the family village to meet the bride. Somehow they decide to take the opportunity to visit neighboring Afghanistan, whose border is wide open. By the time they reach Kandahar, however, events take a dramatic turn as they're shocked and terrified to find the city under U.S. bombardment. They head for Kabul.
The boys, who are very religious, pray in local mosques. Given the white-hot pace of the editing, not every detail is clear but their Muslim friends seem to put them on a van bound for Pakistan; only instead it drives them to Kunduz, a Taliban stronghold in the middle of the mountains. When troops from the Northern Alliance storm the town, Ruhel, Asif and Shafiq mix in with the fleeing Taliban fighters. Monir gets left behind, and is never heard from again.
All this lead-in, intercut with sound bites from newscasts and the accounts of the real-life protagonists, is told at white-hot speed in the film's first 30 minutes. No time is wasted on character sketches and most viewers will never clearly distinguish the four boys. This isn't really a problem, however, in keeping viewers focused on this kind of edge-of-seat storytelling.
Aboard the fleeing Taliban convoy, the boys find themselves in the midst of falling bombs. The dead strew the desert. The survivors surrender.
Here the pace slows for a while as imprisonment begins. Their captors hand them over to the U.S. military and many die aboard a transport container while being taken to Kandahar Air Base. The beatings and interrogations begin.
At first they decide it's wise to hide the fact they're Brits, but when the truth comes out, they are questioned in English about their links to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Handcuffed, hooded and blindfolded, they are flown to Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.
The heart of the film, which will be most talked about, is its graphic depiction of what appears to be round-the-clock torture at Camp X-Ray, the first holding block for detainees. It starts as the boys are locked in open-air cells resembling dog kennels. With the boys' own account to back up the images, these scenes have a sickening realism.
Not allowed to talk to one another, exercise, touch the wire of their cages or protect themselves from the hot sun, they are awoken every hour for a head count. Interrogations at the hands of the CIA, FBI and military personnel involve beatings to extract confessions that they are Al Qaeda fighters. Most diabolical of all the tortures, worthy of a modern-day inquisition or Nazi Germany, is being tied up in stress positions to the floor of cells while being blasted with ear-splitting music, which even a few seconds of re-creation makes torturous for the audience.
The boys' sudden release in 2004 affords a merciful end to the abuse, at least for them, although as Winterbottom and Whitecross remind us, some 500 prisoners are still in Guantanamo.
Playing the four unlucky young Brits, non-pro actors Rizwan Ahmed, Farhad Harun, Waqar Siddiqui and Afran Usman lend a bewildered realism to their characters. Cinematographer Marcel Zyskind and production designer Mark Digby find riveting images not only in the staggering scenery and color of the Afghan, Pakistani and Iranian locations, but in the inhumanly alien orange suits and black hoods the camps' detainees are forced to wear. Molly Nyman and Harry Escott's score is doled out parsimoniously until the final closing moments, when it directs the viewer with its tragic sweep.

Asked about that triple suicide last week at Gitmo , Colleen Graffy , our deputy assistant secretary of state for public diplomacy, opined that it was a "good PR move." Michael Winterbottom 's The Road to Guantánamo which docu- dramatizes the case of the Tipton Three and won the Silver Bear at the last Berlin Film Festival might be an even better one.
The great versatilist of British film, Winterbottomhere co-directing with editor Mat Whitecrossfollows his hardcore structuralist musical 9 Songs  and anti-adaptation of the anti-novel Tristram Shandy with the true story of three Tipton lads, British-born South Asians all around 20, who, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, find themselves hooded and flown in a cargo plane to the U.S. prison camp on Guantánamo base.
"These are bad people," George W. Bush  explains, with a touch of petulance and Tony Blair  at his side, of the Guantánamo detainees. In the case of Ruhel Ahmed , Asif Iqbal , and Shafiq Rasul  that term hardly appliesunless luckless  and possibly stupid  are synonymous with evil . Having gone to Pakistan  in late 2001 for a wedding, the trio gravitate toward Afghanistan 's open border and arrive at Kandahar  in time for the bombing. They flee to Kabul  and then, attempting to return to Pakistan, take a van that turns into a Taliban  convoy.
The Tipton Three are represented as good Muslims, which is to say, they're not fundamentalists but citizens of the worldcarrying Adidas  tote bags, wearing Gap hoodies, and referencing Back to the Future . Arrested by American forces, they are initially unfazed. U.S.A. is OK. (Later, one will compose a rap song that captivates his American jailor until it gets too close to home.) But their interrogation degenerates into pointless brutalizationcomplete with menacing dogseven before they are packed up and shipped to Gitmo.
The Road to Guantánamo  is shot documentary-style, mainly on digital video, with much interpolated news footage and hectic Steadicam  work. Interviews with the actual Tipton Three annotate the action, which is feverish to a fault before settling into its prison camp routine. From there on, it's effectively grueling. Less narrative than experiential in its bias, The Road to Guantánamo  details the 24-7 "processing" of these prisoners, replete with beatings, stompings, sensory bombardment, cage-like cells, shackles, and endless, fruitless interrogations. What's brilliantly omitted by the filmmakers is the ostensible purpose of the violence. Although the Americans claim to want information, their intention is political. Rather than knowledge of Al Qaeda , the goal seems rather to force confessions useful in the creation of defendants for a future show trial.
Although the Tiptons are ultimately unbroken after two years in prison camp, The Road to Guantánamo  is one of the most oppressive accounts of life in a military detention since Jonas Mekas 's "documentary" version of The Brig  or Peter Watkins 's Punishment Park . How good is it as PR? (As the American guards are fond of saying, "Shut the fuck up!") By making a spectacle of the purposeless violence inflicted by frightened authority on whoever might be available, the movie could just as well have been called The Road to Haditha  .

The Museum of the Moving Image  takes a chance in giving a short run to a more low-key, avant-garde wartime drama, Vimukthi Jayasundara's The Forsaken Land . Winner of the Camera d'Or  at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival , the Sri Lankan feature is a studied piece that opens with a single tank arriving at dawn in a deceptively tranquil war zone, a rural purgatory populated by a single familytwo sisters, a child, and the man of the house, conscripted to home duty. The mysterious troop deployments around this deadpan quartet accentuate the sense of alienation.
Although the decades-long civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers  is in relative abeyance, years of violence have precipitated a breakdown in conventional behavior patternsresulting in civilian suicides, adulterous sex, and participation in summary executions. Beautiful but withholding, The Forsaken Land  doesn't offer much in the way of explanationthe soundtrack features more birdcalls than dialoguebut the 27-year-old filmmaker's command of film language is evident and his evocation of postwar trauma is haunting.
