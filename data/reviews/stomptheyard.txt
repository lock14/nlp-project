Equal parts Footloose
, Drumline
, and 1,001 other movies about a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who�s long on talent and rebelliousness but short on social graces and opportunity, Stomp the Yard
 won�t ever be accused of breaking new ground; it�s too busy entertaining to worry about being original. The film�s hero, D.J. (Short), is a dancing prodigy with a chip on his shoulder, and when we first meet him, he�s tearing up the underground dance-battle scene in Los Angeles with an array of moves that would have given Gene Kelly a coronary. I don�t know if there is an actual underground dance-battle scene in Los Angeles, but if there is, I can only hope it�s half as gritty, intimidating, and populated by pit bulls as the one in this movie. Unfortunately, these dance-floor clashes � like those between the Jets and Sharks 50 years ago � can quickly turn into real ones, and after his brother is murdered by a rival gang of hoofers, D.J. is sent to fictional Truth University in Atlanta, where he quickly catches the eye of the gorgeous April (Good) and just as quickly runs afoul of her angry boyfriend, Grant (Henson). In addition to being rich, pompous, and conniving, Grant is also one of the leaders of Mu Gamma Xi, a fraternity whose pre-eminence in �stepping� � a highly physical, rhythmic, almost confrontational form of group dancing � is so unquestioned that only an outsider entirely ignorant of school tradition but blessed with a deep well of bravado would dare challenge it. One can only wonder who that outsider might be. Anyone who�s spent any time at the movies will realize 15 minutes into Stomp the Yard
 that a dance-off is brewing between Grant and DJ, between old and new, and the path the film takes to get there is littered with clich�s and shopworn manipulations of its audience�s most basic emotional vulnerabilities. But the intervening dance sequences are so exciting, so captivating, so full of life, it�s almost possible to forget you�ve seen this movie a hundred times before.


"Stomp the Yard" is a vigorous college cheerleading movie with pumped fists instead of pom-poms. The white skin has been replaced with all kinds of creams, caramels, and cocoas.
Our setting is one of Atlanta's prestigious historically black universities, albeit a fictitious one, and our newcomer is DJ (Columbus Short), a scholarship kid fresh from Los Angeles streets that more or less took his brother, a dancer for sport, like himself. He doesn't want to be there, but like I said, this is a college cheerleading movie, and the movie is cheerleading for college.
After the school's two rival fraternities get a load of DJ's dance movies -- a little krump, a little Savion Glover, some hydraulics -- they both attempt to recruit him to step for them. Stepping is a dance that requires discipline and team
 showboating, not the buck-wild solo stuff he's used to. It also means time away from his studies and his campus job, doing grounds keeping chores for his unsmiling uncle (Harry J. Lennix).
And why conform to the black Greek system, anyway? One gander at the wall of fame in the school's all-purpose heritage hall corrects his ignorance: Esther Rolle, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, her husband, Martin. Soon DJ pledges, and the fictional outfit he chooses, Theta Nu Theta -- a.k.a. the Vipers a.k.a. TNT a.k.a. his background dancers -- has six weeks to prepare for the nation al step competition.
I'm a sucker for a movie that mixes suds with sweat. So I was pleased to see that DJ, on registration day, is stopped, as so many men in B-movies before him have been, by the vision of Meagan Good , who's as teasingly luscious as ever. Naturally, she's the girlfriend of the egomaniac in the rival fraternity, who's played by the pop-music choreographer Darrin Henson . (We can tell he's the villain; a lot of his moves are old Britney Spears routines.) In any case, Good is also the provost's daughter, which is what the movie should have been called. And daddy don't like no thug, even one as cute, limber, and personably un-thug-like as DJ.
This is the screenwriter Robert Adetuyi's second movie in a week. At some megaplexes, his "Code Name: The Cleaner" is stinking up the house next door. "Stomp the Yard," which Sylvain White directed, has a lot more to observe -- and not just the way Good manages to jog on concrete like a "Baywatch" girl, although that is fascinating.
This is the first movie since Spike Lee's "School Daze" to even consider the social complexities of black college life, and Lee's film was almost 20 years ago. Granted, a lot of what "Stomp the Yard" considers complicated is daytime-TV stuff (secrets, lies, tears, Keith Sweat as a competition judge). But the movie does afford Lennix, the suave Valarie Pettiford , as his wife, and Brian White , as the Theta's dignified leader, the chance to enliven the proceedings with elegance.
The raucous dancing, meanwhile, is where most of the drama is. The girls in the movie theater screamed when it start ed . They also screamed at every shirtless training sequence and when something bad happen ed to the singer Chris Brown, who has a small part. The movie doubles as a hormonal horror show. For his part, Short, another pop choreographer, sounds like Vin Diesel, but he moves like a bee. When he dances, he makes sure every girl in the theater goes home stung.


The latest arcane, MTV-icized group activity to receive the loud, busy, generic music-video treatment is stepping, a choreographic tradition of Greek campus life at black universities. In Stomp the Yard , one handsome former L.A. tough (Columbus Short) finds his feet  and a welcome reason to take off his shirt  among other similarly shirtless-worthy Atlanta fraternity brothers. The shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot don't mean a thing. But the stepping does got that swing.

 Brotherhood is powerful. That’s the message of “Stomp the Yard,” a strange and at times strangely compelling mix of black fraternity recruitment video and inspirational tale about a hip-hop boy in a stepping world.  After a dance-off ends with a fight and murder, DJ leaves Los Angeles and krumping for Atlanta and stepping. At Truth University (go, Truth!), the all-black school where he enrolls, stepping — that combination of precision dancing, marching and chanting done in African-American fraternities and sororities — rules, and Gammas and Thetas are the Sharks and Jets.  DJ (the engaging Columbus Short) stands out: he’s a work-study student among the haute bourgeoisie and a street-style dancer among steppers (though it can be difficult to differentiate styles in the frenetically edited dance sequences). “Stomp the Yard” means to be a fable about finding your place in the group (a primal college story, after all) and succeeds most when it hews closest to genre formulas, showing a milieu rarely glimpsed on film, and least when it too warmly embraces fraternity culture.  Here, frat affiliation is lifelong and a predictor of success, with a pedigree so echt it includes the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But race and social justice are incidental to the Gammas and Thetas and to “Stomp,” which posits a world in which white people exist only to fill seats in upscale restaurants. DJ doesn’t need to change the world, he just needs to find a way to dance in it.  “Stomp the Yard” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is a little violence, a little sex and a lot of stepping.

The dancing is more dynamic than the plotting in "Stomp the Yard," an energetic if formulaic underdog tale about warring black fraternities specializing in an intensely competitive style of step dancing. Enjoyable youth-skewing fare executes its predictable moves with plenty of visual-aural panache, only to get tripped up by some decidedly un-hip twists in the third act. Still, "Stomp" should get its B.O. groove on in urban markets, if earlier dance-themed hits like "Step Up" and "You Got Served" (also from Screen Gems) are any indication.
Furiously hyperkinetic prologue shows cocky Los Angeles native DJ (Columbus Short) and his posse winning a bout of competitive street dancing with their daring acrobatics and insanely fast rhythms. After the thunderous backbeats have subsided, however, the night takes a tragic turn when a gang of rival dancers jumps DJ and guns down his brother (Chris Brown).
Arrested for his role in the violent clash, DJ avoids juvenile hall by getting shipped off to Atlanta, where his tough-love uncle (Harry Lennix) enrolls him at Truth U., a historic, predominantly African-American institution. The troubled freshman immediately gets off on the wrong foot with popular upperclassman Grant (Darrin Henson) -- a member of Truth's dominant fraternity, Mu Gamma Xi -- by flirting with his girlfriend, April (Meagan Good).
Soon DJ's show-offy attitude and unmistakable prowess on the dance floor draw the attention of the other
 frat on campus, Theta Nu Theta, which has been overshadowed by Mu Gamma at the national stepping championship for the past seven years. From there, the story's trajectory could hardly be more predictable -- DJ must get schooled, get hazed and, of course, get the girl and the trophy, while dealing with his repressed grief and learning the meaning of teamwork. (Call it "Good Will Stomping.")
Learning being a two-way street, however, Theta Nu also benefits from DJ's "street" background, incorporating his cool ghetto stylings into their traditional dance routines. Pic continually contrasts tough, urban DJ with his invariably smug and wealthy adversaries -- and to that end, Robert Adetuyi's screenplay goes out of its way to cast preppy Grant and even April's father, the school provost (Allan Louis), as two-dimensional villains. Script's excessive dramatic convolutions -- all rigged to make DJ look as vulnerable and put-upon as possible -- prove especially groan-worthy as the climactic dance competition approaches.
Fortunately, Short's moody, taciturn DJ is easy enough to root for on his own, while Brian White also shows sparks of charisma in the slender role of an older Theta Nu brother. Good is, well, good as usual, even if she is playing just another coveted trophy, one whose every sultry movement -- whether bending over a water fountain or jogging in hot-pink track gear -- is ogled by the camera in hilarious slow-mo.
Though some presumably important details of DJ's college life are either relegated to montage or left out altogether (at no point does the camera venture near a lecture hall), helmer Sylvain White's background in commercials and musicvideos serves him ably enough in the invigorating dance sequences. Lenser Scott Kevan wisely dispenses with the irritatingly sped-up camerawork used in the opening sequence and instead shoots the dancers' impressive moves in real time, at times flooding the screen with wildly oversaturated colors.
Editing, for the most part, works in conjunction with the bass-heavy hip-hop soundtrack, but the cutting is often still too frenetic, proving unnecessarily competitive with Dave Scott's athletic and nimble choreography.
