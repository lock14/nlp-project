Writer/director Gary David Goldberg pulls out all the "chick" clich�s � from lit to flick � in this truly (dog)craptastic adaptation of the Claire Cook book about a newly divorced preschool teacher named Sarah who tries Internet dating. The film strives for single-lady, "you said it, sister" boosterism � we�re supposed to want to go rah-rah for our hapless heroine (played here by Diane Lane) as she tries, and mostly fails, to get back in the game. But it�s hard to cheer for a film that wears a slight sneer when it comes to its leading lady. Sarah�s sprawling Irish family (led by patriarch Christopher Plummer) treats her like a freak, a basket case, or a punchline. Her adventures in cyberdating produce one humiliation after another. And the neighborhood butcher looks on her with contempt because she�s only buying for one, and then with fear when she gives him a much-deserved dressing-down. The icing on the cake? When that butcher whispers "praise be" when Sarah finally lands a man � one less crazy divorced lady to deal with! And indeed Sarah does find a man. We all know her single-ness is just a brief spell � a bad rash � and that she�s going to have to try all sorts of embarrassing over-the-counter topical creams before she finds the just-right remedy. Must Love Dogs
� soothing balm is played by John Cusack, as a brokenhearted boat-builder. His part is a bore, but at least it doesn�t demand indignity. That honor�s reserved for Lane, a luminous actress who�s forced to dowdy herself down. She�s played a lonelyheart before, in Under the Tuscan Sun
, but there the desperation and despair felt legitimate � and legitimately moving � here, that pain is just the necessary preamble to getting a man, to getting "fixed." They say rah-rah, I say retch
: No film that requires a woman to jump in water and dogpaddle toward a man has the "sisterhood�s" best interests at heart.


When a man is dumb enough to neglect or divorce Diane Lane in a movie, the upside tends to be: more for us.
Who else in Hollywood is as believably self-doubting? A Lane picture nowadays involves her rediscovery of what we already know to be true -- that her earthly radiance has no peer. While that can be an invigorating experience, she can't entirely make ''Must Love Dogs" as pleasurable to watch as she is.
The movie is harmless and crowd-pleasing, and sometimes uproariously accurate about the debilitating self-consciousness of being newly single. But while Lane is her typical winning self, the film is mawkish. The more we're cajoled to root for Sarah Nolan, the divorced preschool teacher she plays, the more ''Must Love Dogs" stops resembling a movie and starts feeling like a greeting card.
The story gets going after Sarah's shameless sister Carol -- played by Elizabeth Perkins, a sharp actress who deserves bigger parts -- creates an online personals ad in Sarah's name. It bills her as voluptuous, features her high-school graduation photo, and insists that any man who responds must love dogs.
Across town, Jake Anderson, another divorce (John Cusack), has also had his profile thrown online by a friend (Ben Shenkman). Jake likes to sit at home and wallow in idealism, preferably under a blanket watching ''Doctor Zhivago," his apotheosis of romance. For once in a movie like this, the Meg Ryan part is played by a man.
In the film's best scene, Jake and Sarah meet in a dog park. The pets are borrowed. Hers is Mother Teresa, a big Newfoundland that belongs to her brother. His is a little West Highland white terrier that belongs to his buddy; it's good at playing dead. Jake accidentally insults Sarah, asking why she called herself voluptuous, when the term is typically deployed as a euphemism for fat. She bristles and insults him back.
The encounter has a charming awkwardness: Two wary strangers try to disarm each other in public, while puzzling over the absurdities of online dating. And Lane and Cusack, who's in rare witty form, establish a crackling connection that ought to whisk them into a smarter romantic comedy, but I'm probably getting ahead of myself.
Delaying the inevitable between Sarah and John, there's a side plot in which Sarah goes out with the father (Dermot Mulroney) of one of her students. There's also another story line in which her own debonair father (Christopher Plummer), a widower, builds himself a harem of middle-age prospects.
The most garish of them, Dolly (Stockard Channing), lives in a trailer, has taste in Southwestern accessories that runs toward the trashy, and treats online dating as though it were a role-playing game.
Sarah actually heeds the advice Dolly gives her about the joys of false advertising. Yet watching Lane superimpose her face onto a fly-fisher's, or dress in a dozen uncharacterisic styles on dates (oy, that perm!), is more sad than funny. It feels like a betrayal of what is so appealingly practical and intelligent both about the character and the star playing her. Chaka Khan was every woman. Diane Lane is not.
TV veteran Gary David Goldberg directs ''Must Love Dogs," which is adapted from a Claire Cook bestseller, and he rarely passes up an opportunity to ladle on cuteness. The audience I saw the movie with went ''aww" at all the right moments, such as when Mother Teresa rolls over to cuddle with Sarah one night in bed. The movie is part sitcom and part television dramedy. And Goldberg doesn't apologize for relying on the artificial buoyancy of either. He gleefully slaps on a Nolan family sing-along to the ''Partridge Family" theme, for good measure. ''C'mon get happy!" has rarely sounded more like a threat.


         Ah, movie divorce. The dinner over the sink loneliness. The ice cream out of a carton sadness. The bad date montages. About three-quarters of the way through "Must Love Dogs," Sarah (Diane Lane) suffers her first big romantic setback, at which point my viewing companion keeled forward and croaked, "Oh my God. Of course she's wearing bunny slippers."
 
  "Must Love Dogs" must not love movies very much because it takes Lane, John Cusack, Dermot Mulroney, Elizabeth Perkins, Stockard Channing and Christopher Plummer and forces them to reenact the entire unabridged Encyclopedia of Treasured Romantic Comedy Clichés and Chestnuts, Revised Second Edition.
 


         






    I won't dwell on the fact that Sarah is a preschool-teaching, animal-loving recent divorcée with a dead mother, an incidental gay co-worker (thrown in to comply with rom-com regulations) and a pearl-of-wisdom dispensing Irish dad (Plummer) who actually says things like "that's a fine how d'you do" and "your sainted mother" in the corniest Irish brogue this side of the Lucky Charms leprechaun. But by the time his kooky trailer-park lady friend, Dolly (a mop of russet curls draped over the head of Stockard Channing), leads everybody in a hearty round of the Partridge family theme song, I wanted to call Amnesty International.
 
  Director Gary David Goldberg, a veteran television writer whose production company UBU produced "Family Ties" and "Spin City," knows how to write a joke but not how to leave it hanging anxiously in the air waiting for a laugh track that never comes. Cusack manages to not let this get to him. But the camera keeps a wary, some might suspect court-ordered, distance of about 30 feet at all times.
 
  While Sarah's family stages dating interventions, the kids at school say the darndest things. Which is how she learns about one adorable moppet's "incorrigible" and recently separated dad, Bob (Mulroney). Meanwhile, her sister Carol (Perkins) signs her up for an Internet dating service.
 
  Drawn to Bob, but worried about engaging in an inappropriate parent-teacher association, Sarah dutifully suffers through a bad date montage — a weeper here, a pervert there — until she meets Jake (Cusack), a sensitive, "Doctor Zhivago"-loving boat-builder.
 
  Oddly, neither Sarah, Bob nor Jake owns a dog of their own, borrowing them instead from friends and family as the need arises.
 
  Soon, Sarah finds herself drawn into a "Doctor Zhivago"-style dilemma of her own — torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool after somebody turns out not to be the dreamboat he appeared to be.
 
  For a while, it looks as if the title might refer to something Sarah must learn to do, but fate, one of those really weird combination website-graphics programs that exists only in the movies and the luck of the Irish turn her fortunes around.

Good looks, in theory, shouldn't limit a movie star, but when you see Diane Lane in Must Love Dogs  as Sarah, a divorced preschool teacher in her late 30s who is so skittish and insecure about men that she dithers with doubt like the young Mary Tyler Moore crossed with somebody out of an old Woody Allen movie...well, sorry, but I couldn't buy it. It's not simply that Lane is gorgeous; she has the calm direct gaze, the beaming ease of flirtation that so frequently comes with beauty. Self-deprecatory neurosis doesn't jibe with her features. But in the world according to writer-director Gary David Goldberg, everyone, deep down, is a good person, and that goodness is established by one's ability to carry on like a winsomely nerdish loser.
Timid and vulnerable, naked in her desperation, Sarah lunges at every decent man who looks her way, primping in the supermarket aisle, making goo-goo eyes at the recently separated father (Dermot Mulroney) of one of her students. Time and again, however, her amorous instincts are overruled by caution. ''He's looking for the whole dance,'' she says of one of her prospects, ''and I'm just starting to relearn the steps.'' If a line like that is enough to make you cringe, then do yourself a favor and steer clear of Must Love Dogs . The people in this movie don't talk, exactly. They patter, with that hollow cloying rattletrap cleverness common to bad sitcoms at the moment they reveal their ''sincerity.''
Sarah, a saintly sweetheart, is surrounded by relatives who keep telling her to buck up and find a man, and never have I seen an Irish family with quite this many yentas in it. One of her sisters (Elizabeth Perkins) places an ad for her on an Internet dating site, and before long Sarah is subjecting herself to the anxious semi-charade  oh, those youthful photos!  of digital personal ads. She meets Jake (John Cusack), a guy so sensitive that he carves rowing shells out of wood and weeps during Doctor Zhivago. Cusack, whose overfamiliar arch mannerisms, once the stuff of hipster 'tude, now mesh all too well with the banter of a film like this, is so clearly right for our heroine that Goldberg, a director who thinks in episodes, has to keep coming up with lame new ways to stall their getting together. (A frantic late-night hunt for condoms is a particular low point.) This is a movie of fake conflict, fake heart, even fake doggy love.

 Watching "Must Love Dogs," an Internet dating comedy so weightless that it makes a trifle like "You've Got Mail" look like Chekhov, you have to wonder how actors of the caliber of Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing were bamboozled into lending their talents to the project.  One reason might be that its writer-director, Gary David Goldberg, who adapted the movie from a popular novel by Claire Cook, has a reasonable track record in television sitcoms ("Family Ties"). How bad could it be?  But aren't actors supposed to read the screenplays sent to them before they commit to a movie? Proving once again that skillful performances can't create something out of almost nothing - the best they can do is make it palatable - "Must Love Dogs" plays like a dated pre-"Seinfeld" television comedy carelessly splashed onto the screen. Even with its family values and its dogs and children trotting around, its connections to the real world feel tenuous. And its titillated oohing and ahhing attitude toward computer dating puts it several steps behind the social and technological curve.  As Sarah Nolan, a recently divorced preschool teacher pushing 40, Ms. Lane sinks deeper into the stereotypical rut of a smart, beautiful thoroughbred in desperate need of a Mr. Right to complete her life. Ms. Lane played virtually the same role in the slightly more substantial, sexier and less overtly frothy romantic fantasy "Under the Tuscan Sun." The time has come for her to pull herself out of the dirt and run as fast as she can to higher ground, where there's some green grass.  "Must Love Dogs" demonstrates that Ms. Lane is not cut out for light romantic comedy. Even when playing sunny, waves of darkness and tension ripple below the surface. Ms. Lane's body language and the speed and intensity with which her face continually changes expression betray the impatience and wariness of an intelligent high-strung animal straining at a leash. At her most brilliant, in "Unfaithful," her volcanic passion held under pressure was allowed to erupt.  In "Must Love Dogs," Sarah, pushed and prodded by her sisters, Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) and Christine (Ali Hillis), allows them to post an Internet ad that reads "voluptuous, sensuous, alluring and fun" with the condition "must love dogs" be attached. One of the many who respond is Jake Anderson (Mr. Cusack), a wisecracking builder of handmade wooden canoes whom she meets at a dog park.  The vehemence with which Jake sneers at fiberglass attests to his true-blue niceness and decency; his insistence on wood makes him a whole-earth kind of guy. He is sensitive too. Emotionally devastated by a recent divorce, he likes to sit around and get teary-eyed watching "Dr. Zhivago."  Mr. Goldberg's screenplay gives all its wittiest lines to Mr. Cusack, who makes the most of them, although the jokes aren't funny enough to bring the movie fully awake. And Ms. Lane and Mr. Cusack have such an acute lack of romantic chemistry that the sight of them pretending to make nice to each other leaves you squirming with discomfort.  "Must Love Dogs" gives Jake a rival in the person of Bob Connor (Dermot Mulroney), the recently separated father of one of Sarah's preschoolers. The screenplay tries vainly to make the fact of this handsome cipher's being the father of one of Sarah's students a romantic obstacle.  The movie has shoehorned several contrived little incidents into its story to keep the plot in motion. Most involve Mr. Plummer, who plays Sarah's 71-year-old widowed father, Bill, and Ms. Channing as Dolly, one of his blowsy girlfriends. Bill and Dolly have also taken up Internet dating and the deception that often goes with it. Bill claims to be in his early 50's and Dolly (who is well over 50) in her early 40's.  "Must Love Dogs" is so clueless that it imagines that Dolly's landing of a 15-year-old suitor and Sarah's assignation with a man who turns out to be her father are fresh comic ideas. That's how hopelessly clichéd and out of date this vapid little movie that thinks it's so cute turns out to be.  "Must Love Dogs" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and sexual innuendo.

To properly appreciate "Must Love Dogs," one must first love John Cusack. Thesp's maverick turn steals the show in this otherwise middling romantic comedy, which retools standard meet-cute elements for the Web generation in pleasant but uninspired fashion. Fortunately, the charming match-up with Diane Lane goes down smoothly enough. Affectionate interest in both leads could generate solid distaff B.O. early on, though word-of-mouth won't sizzle.
This is the first film in more than 15 years from writer-director Gary David Goldberg, a veteran TV scribe ("MASH," "Lou Grant," "Family Ties"), and some viewers may recognize the Ubu Prods. credit (in this context, "Sit, Ubu, sit! Good dog," Ubu takes on an entirely new angle).
Even when it doesn't entirely succeed, Goldberg's literate screenplay has an old-fashioned, almost preternaturally classy vibe, recalling a time when characters chose their words more carefully and spoke at greater length. Yet the script also betrays a weakness for quaint, obvious humor and a habit of striking its notes with too-on-the-nose precision.
Viewer is thrown into the premise from the very first frame, in a sitcom-like ensemble scene that finds divorced preschool teacher Sarah (Lane) being pressured by her mob-like family -- an intervention, they call it -- to return to the dating scene. The most meddlesome of the bunch is Carol (a perky Elizabeth Perkins), who, without her sister's permission, signs Sarah up for an Internet dating service, with a fake online profile that describes her as voluptuous and includes the requirement of the film's title.
At 40, the stunningly beautiful Lane brings the right twinkle of careworn radiance to her role, with a simmering undercurrent of anger that emerges briefly but fiercely. Lane is too lively and bracing a presence, however, to sell Sarah's occasional moping -- which doesn't seem to fit Sarah anyway.
Sarah fields plenty of undesirable bachelors through the dating Web site -- including, in a mortifying coincidence, her own father (Christopher Plummer). Unfortunately, the bachelor vignettes turn out to be notable less for their comic payoffs than for Sarah'sfascinating assortment of hairdos (styled by Candy L. Walken).Somewhat more satisfyingly, she also starts a flirtation with Bob ("Call me Bobby"), the newly separated dad of one of her young students, played by Dermot Mulroney.
It takes Sarah a while to finally meet Cusack's Jake (at a dog park, naturally), though auds are introduced to him well before that. Philosophical and hyper-articulate, a builder of racing boats whose favorite weekend activity is watching "Doctor Zhivago," Jake is a hopeless romantic and master of comic introspection.
Cusack's offbeat perf is a dazzling display of nonstop verbiage, so prodigious it's tempting to suspect that the actor, who always seems to be sneaking in dialogue ahead of and behind the beat, was allowed free rein to improvise. Non-fans, however, may recoil from what is essentially a mellifluous stream of blarney, one not too far removed from the other soulful smart alecks Cusack has played in the past. Indeed, Sarah is put off by Jake on their first meeting.
Goldberg's script eventually reveals a subtle yet unmistakable strain of moralism, largely dictated by which characters are sleeping together and which aren't (Sarah and Jake get in the mood, only to find themselves on a wild goose chase for contraceptives). Given the frivolity of most mainstream movie sex, this selective prudery weighs in as almost refreshing.
By contrast, the promiscuous Bob(by) is set up rather too tidily as a straw villain, though Mulroney plays him with the right combo of sleaze and charm.
Pic underlines its point by giving Sarah's father an online companion of his own, played with poignancy by Stockard Channing. Supporting is solid, especially Brad William Henke in the token role of Sarah's gay best friend, and Plummer, who adopts a gentle Irish accent as Sarah's father. Craig Armstrong's lilting musical score is noticeably Irish in flavor.
Less successful is an embarrassing musical number halfway through, in which Sarah and the family bust out in "Come On, Get Happy" -- a regrettable attempt to match the joie de vivre 
of the "I Say a Little Prayer" sing-along from "My Best Friend's Wedding."

That's it. I'm divorcing Diane Lane and every divorce-rebound flick that isn't Shirley Valentine  . As in the insultingly bland Under the Tuscan Sun , Lane struggles to recover from a broken marriage. This time, though, her character is helped by her lovably large Boston Irish family. Unfortunately, aside from the reliable Elizabeth Perkins , relegated to advising her prim sis on "boob shirts," these yuppie siblings project all the warmth of models in a new picture frame. Worse yet, father Christopher Plummer  declaims sparkle-eyed platitudes like an old Irish mariner scanning the horizon for sea fowl. Everybody's worried about spinster Sarah (Lane), whose plight leads her to the Internet, the official black hole of film comedy. With a character this dullso dull that we're told over and over how smart and special she isthe resulting glut of date-ad losers seems like just deserts. Of course, dejected Sarah can't hide forever sipping her tea in the bubble bath, and ends up ambivalently juggling the suave Dermot Mulroney  and quirky, Zhivago -obsessed (!) craftsman John Cusack . Guess who wins while I go file the separation papers.
