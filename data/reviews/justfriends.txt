"Just Friends" is funnier than any low-rent rip-off of "There's Something About Mary" has a right to be. It's crass, it's unsophisticated, it aims right for the slapsticky pleasure center of the under-30 moviegoer's brain. So sue me, I laughed. A lot.
And I don't even like Ryan Reynolds, the smart-alecky actor who seems cobbled together from leftover pieces of Chevy Chase, Jimmy Fallon, Bill Murray, and Jason Lee. Reynolds has achieved stardom by snarking his way through teen comedies such as "Van Wilder" and the recent "Waiting . . .," but up to now he hasn't been an actor so much as an attitude with legs. "Just Friends" shows he's capable of edging out onto the branch of date-movie respectability.
First, though, the film has to get him out of the fat suit. When the movie opens, it's 1995 and Chris Brander (Reynolds) is a New Jersey high school senior who looks like Jiminy Glick's kid brother and acts like Richard Simmons's. He also nourishes a crush on Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart), the friendly, outgoing cheerleader who's been his best-friend-forever since, well, forever. Can a husky lad who lip-synchs the lyrics to All-4-One's "I Swear" into his bedroom mirror get the girl of his dreams? Not in movies like this.
Cut to 2005 and Chris has grown up to be -- no, not gay, though the character does maintain an interesting touch of swish -- but a slim, uber-successful Hollywood music executive with models clinging to him like lint.
Enter the film's comedy secret weapon: Anna Faris as Samantha James, an incomprehensibly celebrated pop star who combines the gentility of Courtney Love, the modesty of Gwen Stefani, and the multileveled talents of Jessica Simpson. Chris has to get this creature from Los Angeles to New York, but through a handful of absurd plot contrivances the two are stranded in his hometown for the Christmas holidays.
Screenwriter Adam Davis and director Roger Kumble have one good idea: They know that anyone trying to prove they've left high school behind will revert to their dorkiest teenage incarnation the moment they return. So the more Chris has a chance to show Jamie -- now a bartender and substitute teacher -- that he has escaped "the friend zone," the more the film works overtime to humiliate him. I won't describe the process by which the hero reacquires his adolescent mouth retainer, but it's painfully funny.
As filmmaking, "Just Friends" is slovenly: It's 
visually dingy, haphazardly structured, and it breaks down before it crosses the finish line. As a vibe, though, the movie's unusually happy, and the thanks goes to the cast. Smart is her reliable, grounded self, and Chris Klein shows some overdue comic flair as Chris's fellow teen wonk who has morphed into a romantic rival (his role is the film's most blatant theft from "There's Something About Mary"). Julie Hagerty of "Airplane!" turns up as Chris's ditsy mother, and Christopher Marquette is his brother Mike, slack-jawed with incipient teen lust at the notion of the
 Samantha James staying under his roof. The brothers' relationship -- it could be summed up as one long, loving punch-out -- is a high point of the movie.
With all that, "Just Friends" belongs to Anna Faris, and why an actress this smart and insanely uninhibited isn't getting above-the-title offers is a mystery. Samantha is a star who never filters out a bad idea -- she doesn't have good ones -- and who acts on every impulse, especially those that cause problems for other people. At the same time she retains a little girl's faith in herself as an artiste
. Faris has the enthusiasm, if not the focus, of a great clown, and to see her zonked out on Vicodin and drooling toothpaste into Chris's ear after a minor Taser mishap is to enter low-comedy heaven.
More than anything, "Just Friends" reminds this '80s survivor of the rambunctious teen comedies directed by "Savage" Steve Holland and starring the young John Cusack -- films such as "Better Off Dead" and "One Crazy Summer." Those weren't art, and neither is this. But they were cheerful and inventive and sloppily assured -- and so is this.


         In "Just Friends," Ryan Reynolds, who has established himself as an actor by demonstrating his versatility and not relying on his looks, plays a young man who 10 years earlier left New Jersey suburbia as a sensitive, overweight, double-chinned and much-abused high school student but returns as a buff, handsome high-powered Hollywood music executive. An unexpected detour on his way to Paris brings him home again, making him realize he still loves the local girl (Amy Smart) who back then told him she loved him — like a brother. His challenge is to make her see him as a love interest and not just her best friend from school days.
 
  There have been worse premises for a romantic comedy, but director Roger Kumble and writer Adam "Tex" Davis could scarcely have done a worse job developing it. This is a standard-issue gross Hollywood knockabout comedy in which slapstick antics have been piled up with a steam shovel and driven home with a sledgehammer. Reynolds and Smart are game and even dimensional, but all others are stuck playing tiresome, obnoxious characters.

Hard to believe it's been 16 years since Harry met Sally and told her all that 1980s guff about the impossibility of platonic relationships between men and women. In the cheerily clean and notably bright teen comedy Just Friends , Chris (Ryan Reynolds, a rising pro at playing cute/funny) meets Jamie (Amy Smart, likewise) and adores her, yet he can't escape from her ''friend zone'' to become boyfriend material. He's an overweight dweeb in New Jersey high school hell, circa the 1990s; she's a Miss Popularity who loves Chris  like a brother.
The movie, directed by Cruel Intentions ' Roger Kumble from a script by Adam ''Tex'' Davis, argues on behalf of the Darwinian theory that all of life imitates high school: Ten years later, Chris is a svelte, babe-slaying record-biz success in L.A. who reverts to dweebhood when he's back around Jamie. But the argument is only halfhearted. Just Friends  is much more interested in  and hilarious about  the small nostalgias of suburbia. (Not for nothing does the quintessential suburban-nostalgia band Fountains of Wayne contribute a tune.) And for added value, there's a running joke about the movie The Notebook  that the South Park  guys only wish they had written.

 "Just Friends" hangs its crude, clobbering sense of humor on a dubious theory. Once a boy and a girl have entered the "friend zone" in a relationship, there's no turning it into sweet romance. Translated into the movie's loutish high school mentality, that means no  you-know-what.  The idiot who spouts this theory is Chris Brander (Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit, prosthetic makeup, frizzy wig and a slimy retainer that he pops in and out of his mouth more than once). A New Jersey high school senior, Chris is besotted with his best friend, Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart), a blond cheerleader to whom he has devoted a whole wall of tribute in his suburban bedroom. Chris's private tête-à-têtes with this best friend are exercises in torture, in which Jamie sprawls all over him,  oblivious to his agonized frustration, which, when you think about it, is not really very friendly of her.  Chris's awful moment of truth arrives at a graduation party during which his abject confession of love to Jamie, scrawled in a high school yearbook, is read aloud to screaming derision from the assembled guests. He stumbles out of the party vowing to show them.  That was in 1995. The movie jumps ahead 10 years. Chris is now a slimmed-down, slick-haired Hollywood smoothie operating in the music-video world; compliant models drip off his arm. The movie, directed by Roger Kumble from a screenplay by Adam Tex Davis, wants us to think that Chris has lost his soul in Hollywood. But Mr. Reynolds is not an actor who oozes either sensitivity or intelligence.  In its one stroke of originality, "Just Friends" gives Chris a nightmarish sidekick in the person of Samantha James (Anna Faris), a ferociously possessive, psychotically self-centered, nymphomaniacal music-video star who attaches herself to him like a creeping fungus. Think of all the worst characteristics of Britney, Madonna and Courtney magnified by a hundred and rolled into a poisonous package resembling  the young Joey Heatherton. When Samantha serenades Chris during a flight to Europe with her new song, "Forgiveness," in a cat-scratching yowl, his pained response, "Oh, God," is taken as a sign of approval.  Chris gets his chance to show them when a fire aboard the jet causes the flight to be grounded near Trenton, and, with Samantha clawing at his arm and jabbing his groin, he makes a 10th-anniversary reappearance in his hometown. Jamie, as beautiful as ever, and single, still lives there.  Although "Just Friends" belongs to the same genre as "Wedding Crashers" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," it has only about half their wit and stamina. But it is somewhat better than "Waiting," the nadir of the style, which also starred Mr. Reynolds. "Just Friends" overcompensates for its sloppiness with loud,  knockabout farce, much of it involving Chris's violent love-hate relationship with his younger brother, Mike (Christopher Marquette), on whom he tries to palm off Samantha while he pursues Jamie.  He has a challenger for her affection in Dusty Dinkleman (Chris Klein), another high school frog turned into a prince. Dusty, who appears at the beginning of the movie as a pimply geek so adoring of Jamie that he becomes tongue-tied in her presence, is now a pseudo-sensitive, guitar-strumming seducer wielding a New Age shtick. His last name, however, indicates how despicable he really is.  "Just Friends" knows its audience and their points of reference. There is a gross-out toothpaste scene that echoes the hair-gel sequence in "There's Something About Mary," and accidental vandalism to rival the destruction of a suburban yard in "Meet the Parents." The movie would like us to believe that Chris, eventually reduced by a series of mishaps into wearing another retainer, gets back his lost soul. Don't believe it. There was never one there to begin with.  "Just Friends" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual content.

A one-time high school loser takes a second stab at love in "Just Friends," a surprisingly shrewd and energetic romantic comedy. Well-cast charmer doesn't make it to the finish line with all its virtues intact, though for the most part, those virtues -- among them a barbed, pop-savvy script and cheerfully self-effacing performances -- are estimable. New Line release should play well to date-night crowds and may strike a chord with viewers with an affinity for '90s nostalgia.
Anyone who came of age in that decade and can look back with any fondness on the experience will likely be hooked from the opening, which finds smart, lovable, overweight teenager Chris Brander (Ryan Reynolds, wearing a fatsuit and prosthetics that have no aspirations to believability) serenading the camera to slow-dancing staple, All-4-One's "I Swear."
Chris is in love with best friend Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart), a beautiful cheerleader who's dated a steady stream of jerks and jocks, but whose affection for her pudgy pal remains strictly platonic. After his feelings are made humiliatingly public one night, Chris leaves town, vowing to forget his old life and make something of himself.
Ten years later, a newly svelte Chris has relocated to Los Angeles and made good on his promise: He's a high roller in the music industry, a skilled hockey player and a seasoned ladies' man.
An unexpected Christmas layover in New Jersey forces him to reconnect with his mom (a delightfully ditzy Julie Hagerty), younger brother Mike (Christopher Marquette) and, inevitably, Jamie, who's as gorgeous as ever and now works behind the counter at the local diner. And so Chris sets out to woo her anew, expecting that his hunkiness will make for an easy kill -- only to find it more difficult than he could have imagined.
To complicate matters, Chris has ex-girlfriend and prospective client Samantha James (Anna Faris) in tow. A national sex symbol, burgeoning rock goddess and hyper-spoiled Hollywood brat, Sam is the film's secret comic weapon, as Faris -- doing a monstrously over-the-top variation on the bubbly pop star she played in "Lost in Translation" -- scores one direct hit after another, managing to steal every scene she's in without distracting from the proceedings.
On one level, pic serves up a supremely cushy yet immensely satisfying revenge fantasy: The idea of a high school outcast who returns home to find himself the coolest guy on the block is all but impossible to resist (and no doubt will resonate with more than a few Hollywood A-listers).
But Adam "Tex" Davis' script reveals surprising layers, smartly suggesting Chris' external improvements -- his newfound worldliness and sexual savvy -- have come at considerable cost to his integrity and personality. Reynolds embodies these contradictions expertly in a tricky, at times deliberately distancing performance, playing Chris as a scheming, self-absorbed yuppie, with all the wounds and insecurities of his previous life very much intact.
Helmer Roger Kumble, who revealed an assured hand with younger thesps in "Cruel Intentions," elicits similarly solid perfs from Smart, who makes Jamie a wonderfully earthy and lovable girl next door; and from Chris Klein, smarmy and spot-on as Dusty, another loser-turned-dreamboat who offers cutthroat competish for Jamie's attentions.
Relying far more on verbal humor than gross-out gags, pic does have a violent comic bent that tilts occasionally into mean-spiritedness, with some unnecessarily cruel hijinks involving a Taser and what has to be one of the most hideous hockey accidents committed to film. And the last act takes a needlessly sour turn, as the leads are punished and kept apart for far too long, in a way that echoes the similarly derailed "Wedding Crashers."
Editor Jeff Freeman matches the ensemble's comic timing cut for cut, while cinematographer Anthony B. Richmond (who last collaborated with Kumble on "The Sweetest Thing") delivers an appropriately bright, zippy look.
Closing credits revisit the opening "I Swear" gag to somewhat lesser effect, though the full version of Sam's single "Forgiveness," performed by Faris, makes a terrific kicker.

A refreshingly mean-spirited breeze through both the holiday movie and romantic-comedy checklists (including the third-act heart of gold), Just Friends  aspires to the exalted likes of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion , in which the ostracized misfit returns to wow his old classmates with nouveau-riche playthings and a newly taut abdomen. Overweight drama geek Chris Brander  (Ryan Reynolds ) spent high school covertly pining after his BFF Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart ), a bubbly blonde cheerleader who just doesn't think of Chris that way. Ten years after a graduation-night humiliation sent him packing to L.A., where he's metamorphosed into a smooth-talking record exec, Chris crash-lands in the New Jersey suburb Jamie still calls (her parents') home. Can he finally win her heart? Between belabored plot points, screenwriter Adam "Tex" Davis gets in some good jokes, mostly at the expense of Samantha James  (Anna Faris ), a monstrous Britney clone Chris has been ordered to sign in spite of her K-Fed-grade pipes. An underrated (if not underworked) comedic talent, Reynolds acquits himself masterfully; by simply widening his eyes, he provides a window into the private anguish of his bemused Everyasshole.
