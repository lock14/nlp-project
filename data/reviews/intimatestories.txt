Argentinean filmmaker Carlos Sorin's deadpan and beguiling road-trip drama Intimate Stories  makes use of the road itself as a major character. In vignettes of coincidence and cooperation played out between Fitz Roy and the distant port of San Julián, the imposing physical presence of blacktop extends in an endless ribbon over the vast, extraordinary steppes of Southern Patagonia. But while this piquant, tapas-like movie (a 2003 film- festival favorite only now being released) asserts that landscape is a kind of destiny from which one cannot escape, Sorin takes delighted, serious interest in how far a person can advance psychologically, even if all roads lead back to a home at the end of the world.
In a persuasive demonstration of innate  human dignity, all but two of the cast members are nonactors who enact their parts with easy naturalism. An old man with a guilty conscience hitches rides in search of his dog; a young provincial woman and her baby journey by bus to claim a prize on a TV game show; a traveling salesman frets about the perfect gift to impress a woman he fancies. Strangers meet, then move on. Paths cross, then unravel. Only the highway itself remains constant in Sorin's sweet, shaggy travelogue.

he most indelible image that lingers from the Argentine film "Intimate Stories" is the picture of an 80-year-old man with a cane shuffling along the road at sunrise in the desolate plains of Patagonia. The landscape is bare. The only hints of color are  in the early morning sky. The road seems to stretch  into nothingness. Almost every frame of this modest gem of a movie, directed by Carlos Sorin from a screenplay by Pablo Solarz, conveys the emptiness of the environment in which three interwoven vignettes unfold. "Intimate Stories" (originally titled "Minimal Stories") is Mr. Sorin's first film since his rarely seen 1989 flop, "Eversmile, New Jersey." Starring Daniel Day-Lewis as a dentist touring Patagonia on a motorcycle, it disappeared at virtually the moment it was released. In "Intimate Stories," as the camera scans a wasteland nearly devoid of material things, the eye fastens on whatever is available; the most humble, weather-beaten objects become precious signs of life. The movie conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For characters who wouldn't even understand the concept of upward mobility, this is  the way life is. The old man, Don Justo (Antonio Benedictis), who takes to the road from his native village of Fitz Roy, where his family runs a grocery store, is one of  three travelers bound for the provincial capital of San Juli�n.   The 200-mile journey promises redemption to one, riches to another and true love to a third. Don Justo, having heard that his beloved dog, Badface, which ran off three years earlier, has been seen in a neighboring village, plans to hitchhike the route in hopes of retrieving the animal. Half blind and on the verge of senility, he is haunted by a question: do dogs know the difference between right and wrong? Only at the end of the movie do we learn his guilty secret, which he believes may have driven Badface away. The second traveler, Mar�a (Javiera Bravo), is a single mother who journeys with her baby to San Juli�n to compete on what looks like the world's tackiest  game show, "Multicolored Casino." The contestants spin a roulette wheel and throw out numbers attached to prizes. The top prize is a food processor, an item of dubious value to Mar�a since her shack in Fitz Roy has no electricity. The most sophisticated itinerant, Roberto (Javier Lombardo), is a 40-year-old traveling salesman peddling so-called slimming plasters made in Sweden that his aggressive sales pitch promises will produce rapid weight loss. How they are applied and how they will accomplish their little miracles are never explained. Roberto totes with him an elaborate birthday cake, patched like a soccer ball, which he plans to give to Rene, a child he's never met of a female client he fancies. But midway in the journey, it occurs to him that Rene could as easily be a girl as a boy. He frantically casts about for a cake decorator, and finds a stranger who attaches  little blue feet to it that make it resemble a turtle. The movie's satirical touches are so affectionate that you never feel its creators are looking down on characters whose modest quests loom as such potentially life-changing adventures. To the contrary, the vision of simple people helping one another  expresses an  essential humanity that doesn't feel forced or sentimental.

Small is beautiful indeed in the case of "Minimal Stories," a beguiling tale of three parallel journeys across the dusty steppes of Patagonia that culminate in subtle but satisfying moments of self-fulfillment. Endowed with captivating simplicity, gentle humor, rich humanity and infectious generosity of spirit, Argentinean director Carlos Sorin's road movie won the Special Jury Prize at San Sebastian. A sure-fire festival favorite, the modest production could also find a receptive arthouse niche with the right handling.
A veteran commercials director, Sorin won a Silver Lion at the Venice fest with his 1986 debut "La Pelicula del Rey" but dropped out of sight after 1989's poorly received "Eversmile, New Jersey" with Daniel Day-Lewis. Only his third feature, "Minimal Stories" was completed thanks to the Cinema in Progress joint funding program between San Sebastian and the Toulouse fest. Pic was shown at the latter in an incomplete version in March, at which point Spanish co-producer Wanda Vision came aboard.
The principal characters all travel from their native village far from the modern world in remote southern Argentina to the nearest, only marginally more sophisticated town of San Julian. Their stories are loosely but seamlessly interwoven as they each pursue their humble dreams.
Unable to drive after losing his license due to failing eyesight, retired general store owner Don Justo (Antonio Benedictis) defies his son's travel veto and sets off on foot after hearing his missing dog has been seen in town. Traveling salesman Roberto (Javier Lombardo) plans to court the widow of a client by showing up on her child's birthday with a cake. A timid young mother with an unemployed husband, Maria (Javiera Bravo) gets a reprieve from her hand-to-mouth existence when she's selected to compete on a TV gameshow for the top prize of a food processor.
By far the most touching of the three stories, Don Justo's journey is punctuated by encounters with characters that all show a profound respect for the aged, from a doting biologist (Julia Solomonoff) to a goodhearted night-watchman (Anibal Maldonado). The old man's urge to be reunited with his mangy mutt is driven by a deeper need to atone before death for what he perceives as his abandonment of the animal years earlier.
By turns poignant and funny, Roberto's mission may be to find love, but he approaches his goal with guidance from a marketing self-help manual. His efforts to redecorate the soccer-ball cake with more generic frosting when he realizes he's unsure of the child's gender provide some of the film's most amusing scenes.
Bowing to pressure from a habitual gameshow contestant (Silvia Fontelles), Maria swaps the food processor for an inferior prize, plus the cash to cover a restaurant meal and hotel stay with her daughter before heading home. The experience fosters a quiet sense of joy and discovery that dwarfs her triumph on the TV show.
While all three stories share a soul-stirring view of the everyday kindnesses between characters and are all resolved with sweetly disarming outcomes, there's nothing manipulative or artificial in Pablo Solarz's economical screenplay or Sorin's warmly observational direction. This extends also to the unaffected work of the largely non-professional cast, with 80-year-old novice Benedictis a natural scene-stealer.
The action hums along at a pleasurably unhurried pace to the lovely sonorous strains of a Latino guitar-flavored score by the director's son, Nicolas Sorin. Shooting with two Super 16 cameras, lenser Hugo Colace nicely offsets the intimacy and seemingly inconsequential nature of the stories, lending dignity and scope to the characters with the windswept plains and endless skies.

Mike Leigh  spins silk out of shoestrings and Terence Davies  can't even get a foot in the financiers' door, but somehow the U.K. film industry can always scrounge enough loose change from the cushions to foot the bill for a pre-chewed lump of sickly saltwater taffy like the mawkish Scottish-seaside postcard Dear Frankie . Emily Mortimer  (last seen getting a big banging from Ewan McGregor  while covered in custard and ketchup in Young Adam ) plays single mother Lizzie, who's been on the run from her violent husband for years; her deaf nine-year-old, Frankie (Jack McElhone ), has no memory of his thuggish father, and Lizzie eagerly fills in this lacuna with tales of a fantasy sailor Dad on the high seas. When his supposed ship comes to dock at Frankie and Lizzie's latest hometown, quick-thinking Mum recruits the Phantom of the Opera (stone-faced Gerard Butler , credited as simply The Stranger) to play Daddy, provoking many slushy soundtrack cues. The pat emotions contradict the lazily inconclusive life-goes-on ending, and the moral seems to be that kids just want to be lied to.
