There are a few reasons why you'd probably want to steer clear of Sweeney Todd (Depp). For one, it's six to five and pick �em whether or not he'll slice your throat open with a straight razor, leaving you to gasp for life while spurting blood all over his newly refurbished barber's chair. Two, if he does kill you, most likely he's going to hand your corpse over to loopy, pasty-faced restaurateur Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) so she can cook it into a meat pie. And three, even if you do manage to escape being turned into supper, there's no escaping the slow death by monotony you'll experience after spending a few days in his company. Like some religious fanatic, Todd is a sounding bell playing the same note over and over again, ad nauseam: "Revenge, revenge, revenge," he crows. Which may sound more exciting than, say, "latkes, latkes, latkes," but watching Burton's adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, I was struck by just how dull violent retribution can be when it's all someone ever talks (or, in this case, sings) about. The focus of Todd's bloody obsession is Judge Turpin (Rickman), a sinister megalomaniac who 15 years earlier stole Todd's wife and young daughter and sent him to prison in Australia. Now back in London (which, he sings, is a "hole in the world/like a great black pit/and the vermin of the world/inhabit it"), Todd is only interested in two things: reopening his shop and slicing Turpin into little bits. After that? Retirement, I suppose, or vocal lessons. Burton's gorgeously grim film (his sixth with Depp) is loyal to Sondheim's original, both in spirit and structure; it's dark and Gothic and drenched in blood, and it forgoes excessive dialogue in the name of getting quickly to the next murky, malevolent, yet strangely forgettable tune. Poor Depp, though, isn't up to the challenge of a musical. He may look menacing with his ivory skin and flashing eyes, but he sings like he's three drinks into a night at the local karaoke bar. Which is a problem because Todd is constantly singing � to Lovett, to Turpin, to London, even to his razors. So by the time he gets that long-wished-for shot at restitution, I didn't care anymore if he succeeded or not, so long as he stopped singing about it. By that point I'd already decided life would be better inside a quiet meat pie.


With Johnny Depp as the demon barber, Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd' slashes the songs and ramps up the gore
To devotees of Broadway musicals: Fear not, your beloved "Sweeney Todd" has come to the screen relatively intact, with most of its songs and nearly all its depravity.
To Johnny Depp idolators and anyone else stumbling into the multiplex expecting the further larks of Jack Sparrow: This is a musical. More than that, in its original form, "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" was a bloody brilliant musical, featuring some of the most glorious melodies in American stage history and some of the most ferocious business. Homicide. Sadomasochism. Incest (sort of). Cannibalism. The kind of show where you go home humming the murders.
Which brings me to my third point: Everybody bring a raincoat. This thing spurts.
What Tim Burton has done to Stephen Sondheim's 1979 show is tighten it, Gothify it, and heighten all the bloodletting that stagecraft can only imply. A Grand Guignol night at the theater has become a full-on horror movie, "Saw" with a ravaged, keening heart. This makes it harder to watch - and may turn it into that rarity, a commercial film whose target audiences cancel each other out - but it's a conceptual masterstroke. "Sweeney" always wanted to be a revenger's tragedy to make us recoil in fright. Now it is. Merry Christmas.
On a lighter note, you want to know if Depp can sing. I'm pleased to report that he can - on a lighter note. Turns out he's almost a tenor. As the mad barber of 19th-century London, returning from the prison colonies to exact vengeance on the corrupt judge who sentenced him, Depp cuts a smart, lithe swath through the film's visual murk, and he hits his notes with ease. He's not a big Sweeney with a big voice - not an un stoppable bull like the men who've played the part on stage - but rather a cauterized romantic hero. A Tim Burton hero.
Todd has crept back into the city accompanied by an idealistic young sailor, Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), who spies Todd's beauteous young daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and falls in love. Problem: She has been the ward of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, surprisingly low-key) ever since the villain banished her father and ravished her mother (Laura Michelle Kelly in flashbacks). Ickier problem: Now the judge wants to marry his ward.
In keeping with the blood-and-thunder melodramas on which Sondheim based the play, "Sweeney" is absurd with plot: coincidences, mistaken identities, purloined purses, the lot. It all comes down to revenge, and for this a man needs a helpmate: Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the blowsy restaurateur who grinds Sweeney's victims into meat pies and serves them to a hungry, unknowing public. "What's the sound of the world out there?" the barber exultingly sings to her. "Those crunching noises pervading the air?/ It's man devouring man, my dear/ and who are we to deny it in here?"
This is Rodgers and Hammerstein devoured by Brecht, and the only way it can possibly go down is with black humor and melody. Providing the former are scene-stealers Sacha Baron Cohen (as Signore Pirelli, the grinning mountebank who runs afoul of Sweeney; even Cohen's pants are funny) and the reliable Timothy Spall as the judge's weaselly beadle.
Sondheim provides the melodies, harsh and enchanting. "Pretty Women," the duet between the barber and the judge as one prepares to shave the other, is a heart-stopping ode to watching and appreciating - and fetishizing - the fairer sex. The mid-movie reprise of the lyrical "Johanna" captures all the major characters in stages of bliss and delusion; it's like a fugue for lost souls.
Depp is up to the demands of the role; Bonham Carter, sadly, is not. Burton's wife in real life, she's playing to his wispy Goth sensibility again, and, worse, her singing voice is all wrong. Because Sweeney is the dreamer, Mrs. Lovett has to be the hard-nosed doer, urging her artistic mate toward the practicalities of body removal and such. She's his manager, really, but Bonham Carter plays and sings the part with such limp ennui that at times you can't make out what she's saying (a particular crime with Sondheim). She's an Edward Gorey figure in a Jack the Ripper landscape.
There are other pieces missing. Burton, working with Sondheim himself, has cut all the choral parts (no opening "Ballad of Sweeney Todd," alas), half of the show-stopping "Have a Little Priest" (with its gleeful descriptions of what type of person would make what type of meat pie), and many of the love songs between Anthony and Johanna. You actually miss the latter, since Bower and Wisener aren't the handsome stick figures of most stage versions but odd-looking and impassioned. They're as misshapen as everyone else here, just attractively so.
More damaging is the loss of the play's larger message - that what Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett dish out, we're more than happy to scarf down, whether at a restaurant table or in a multiplex seat. The customers no longer bellow "God, that's good!" in the song of the same name; London has ceased to be a cannibalizing character of its own. Star-struck by his homicidal duo, Burton lets the dark heart of the matter slip.
In its place, though, he puts blood: geysers of it, jetting in hot arterial fountains from any number of severed necks. In a movie year steeped in hemoglobin, "Sweeney Todd" may be the most unrestrained of the bunch. The gore functions as an over-the-top joke, but it's also a devil's bargain, insisting that if we want to be entertained by murder 
we had better confront what it looks like.
This is risky business, and it brings Burton at least partway out of his shell of chic gloom. It's less distance from Edward Scissorhands to this weary maniac with the gleaming razors than you may think, and Sondheim's unyielding cynicism - expressed in this one musical more than anywhere else - spurs the director to what may be his most direct and discomfiting movie. "Sweeney Todd" comes as close to raging 
at normalcy as Burton has dared. It's no coincidence that the rage is borrowed from a greater artist.


A wronged barber in 19th-century London wielding silver razors on a mission of vengeance sings ''They all deserve to die!'' in the thrilling epiphany aria that's the first-act climax of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street . As any besotted devotee of Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical-theater masterpiece knows, they all do. Die, I mean. Thwarted just when he has the throat of the villain he most wants in his hands  the evil Judge Turpin, who sent the then-named Benjamin Barker to prison years earlier on false charges  the brooding tonsorial artist expands his killing plans to include all who sit in his barber chair. The legend of this grim reaper and the widowed baker, Mrs. Nellie Lovett, who assisted him by grinding up dead customers into meat pies has been around for over 150 years. But only Sondheim's music and lyrics could explain the barber's reasoning so eloquently: ''The lives of the wicked should be made brief/For the rest of us death will be a relief.''
In other words, to stage a proper Sweeney Todd , necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who has chopped and kneaded an almost dauntingly famous theater piece into something that stands up to the screen, and has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock.
Burton's adaptation, starring Johnny Depp in the title role and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, isn't the most enduringly classic Sweeney Todd  (that would be the original Broadway production, with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury) or the most brilliantly original (nothing beats the deconstructed 2005 stunner, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone). Songs have been cut and characters reproportioned in importance (the utilitarian screenplay, respectful enough of Hugh Wheeler's original book, is by John Logan, who co-wrote Gladiator ). But this opulent, attentive production is splashed with signature style and hell-bent on entertaining Sondheimites, Deppsters, ladies who heart Alan Rickman in the role of the judge, and even Borat/Ali G -loving strays who wander in to see an uncontainably antic Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of a blackmailing faux-Italian con man. It's an impossible assignment, really, carried off with more-than-respectable panache
Indeed, the movie is so finely minced a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job. (Okay, I'd love to see what American Psycho  director Mary Harron would have done, but I'm sure DreamWorks wouldn't.) What Burton lacks (and I suspect he knows he lacks) in ease when it comes to directing fully liberated glee, real fear, and dangerous hilarity, he steadfastly attempts to make up for with compensatory floods of visual verve. Plus, he gets Depp, Bonham Carter, Rickman, and even Baron Cohen to sing.
Oh, Captain Jack Sparrow, gone to the really, really dark side! Burton has an affinity for the mayhem's Grand Guignol setting, of course. But more valuably, he has a unique collaborative relationship with his longtime leading man. And painted in chalky pallor and drop-dead under-eye shadows out of the Pirates of the Caribbean–Edward Scissorhands  makeup bag, Depp propels the production through sheer graceful grit of stardom. He emphasizes the mourning man's melancholy (he misses his lost wife and the daughter who's now the hideous judge's ward) with a cold Sleepy Hollow  ghostliness, rather than a hot, iniquities-of-the-world fury. Depp is a decent enough singer in a cast for whom vocal prowess isn't job No. 1 or even job No. 5, but singing almost doesn't matter, not while he's around: He's the most interesting person on the screen, and the demon barber he conjures is a fascinating interpretation.
As for Mrs. Lovett, she truly is a woman of ''limited wind,'' as Sondheim describes her and Bonham Carter sings her in a thin, breathy voice  it's difficult to believe that this particular bloody wonder can lift a rolling pin, let alone crank the handle on her hellish meat-grinding machinery. It's nice, though, how Bonham Carter's corpse-bride complexion complements Depp's; how Rickman's sadistic Judge Turpin oozes real erotic heat, not just twisted sexual tastes; and how honorably a big studio has, er, stuck its neck out to do right by one of the great American artistic creations of our time.

 Correction Appended  Tim Burton makes fantasy movies. Stephen Sondheim writes musicals. It is hard to think of two more  optimistic genres of popular art, or of two popular artists who have so systematically subverted that optimism. Mr. Sondheim has always gravitated toward the dissonance lurking in hummable tunes, and has threaded his song-and-dance spectaculars with subtexts of anxiety and alienation. Mr. Burton, for his part, dwells most naturally (if somewhat uneasily) in the realms of the gothic and the grotesque, turning comic books and children’s tales into scary, nightmarish shadow plays.  And so it should not be surprising that “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” Mr. Burton’s film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s musical, is as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the “Saw” franchise. Indeed, “Sweeney” is as much a horror film as a musical: It is cruel in its effects and radical in its misanthropy, expressing a breathtakingly, rigorously pessimistic view of human nature. It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme — I am tempted to say evil — genius.  As it was originally performed onstage, with all the songs Mr. Sondheim composed for it, “Sweeney Todd” balanced its inherent grisliness with a whimsical vitality. The basic story is a revenger’s tragedy more Jacobean than Victorian, but Mr. Sondheim nonetheless wrings some grim, boisterous comedy out of both the impulse for vengeance and the bustling spirit of commerce. A barber, wronged by a powerful judge, returns to London and sets up shop, cutting throats as well as hair. The bodies of his victims are turned into savory meat pies by Mrs. Lovett, his energetic partner in business and crime. Cannibalism and mass murder as the basis for a hit show — what a perverse and delicious joke.  It seemed a lot less funny in the recent revival, which starred Michael Cerveris and Patti Lupone in roles originated on Broadway by Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in 1979. Mr. Burton’s film, in spite of the participation of Sacha Baron Cohen (as a mountebank barber in a skin-tight costume) and Timothy Spall (as a louche bailiff) pretty much casts out frivolity altogether. Mr. Burton’s London is a dark, smoky oil slick of a city. Dante Ferretti’s production design, which owes something to the Victorian city confected for Carol Reed’s “Oliver!,” can make even daylight look sinister. Innocence, represented by a pair of young would-be lovers (Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower) has virtually no chance in this place; it is a joke played by fate, something to be corrupted, imprisoned or destroyed.  Mrs. Lovett the pie maker is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a witchy fixture of Mr. Burton’s cinematic universe as well as the mother of his children. If the director has an alter ego, or at least an actor consistently able to embody his ideas on screen, it would have to be Johnny Depp. He was the hurt, misunderstood man-child in “Edward Scissorhands,” the cracked visionary in “Ed Wood” and the cold, creepy candy mogul in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” in each case giving  form to an emotional equation that had never quite been seen on film before. As Sweeney, his hair streaked with white and his eyes rimmed in black, he is an avatar of rage.  Mr. Depp’s singing voice is harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful. He brings the unpolished urgency of rock ’n’ roll to an idiom accustomed to more refinement, and in doing so awakens the violence of Mr. Sondheim’s lyrics and melodies. Some of the crowd-pleasing numbers, like “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” have been pared away, but their absence only contributes to the diabolical coherence of the film, which moves with a furious momentum toward its sanguinary conclusion.  Like nearly every other horror-film serial killer — the outcast teenager abused by the cool kids; the decent man whose suffering has been  ignored or mocked — Sweeney starts out as a sympathetic figure. Once upon a time, he was a happy husband and father, until his lovely wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) caught the eye of a malignant judge (Alan Rickman), who transported the poor barber to Australia. Now, after many years, he has returned to find that his daughter, now a teenager, has become the judge’s ward. Finding his old straight razors — “my friends” — under the floorboards of his former shop, Sweeney sets out to ensnare the judge, a project that requires the deaths of quite a few customers along the way.  “They’ll never be missed,” sings the practical Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney’s view is harsher, almost genocidal. “They all deserve to die,” he says, looking out over the rooftops of the city. And Mr. Burton depicts those deaths ruthlessly. The initial geyser of blood may seem artificially bright, but when the bodies slide head first from the chair down a chute into the cellar, they crash and crumple with sickening literalness. You are watching human beings turned into meat.  It may seem strange that I am praising a work of such unremitting savagery. I confess that I’m a little startled myself, but it’s been a long time since a movie gave me nightmares. And the unsettling power of “Sweeney Todd” comes above all from its bracing refusal of any sentimental consolation, from Mr. Burton’s willingness to push the most dreadful implications of the story to their blackest conclusions.  “Sweeney Todd” is a fable about a world from which the possibility of justice has vanished, replaced on one hand by vain and arbitrary power, on the other by a righteous fury that quickly spirals into madness. There may be a suggestion of hopefulness near the end, but you don’t see hope on the screen. What you see is as dark as the grave. What you hear — some of the finest stage music of the past 40 years — is equally infernal, except that you might just as well call it heavenly.  “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s not “Hairspray.

Both sharp and fleet, �Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street� proves a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim�s landmark 1979 theatrical musical. Where much could have gone wrong, things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap by far the biggest audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although just how big depends on the upscale crowd�s tolerance for buckets of blood, and the degree to which the masses stay away due to the
whiff of the highbrow. In all events, DreamWorks-Paramount and Warner Bros. have a classy and reasonably commercial delicacy on their hands.
The composer-lyricist�s bulging shelf of awards and peerless reputation notwithstanding, Sondheim�s own shows have never invited much bigscreen interest, no doubt due to the general feeling that they are works from and for the head rather than the heart. The two films that were made from his musicals, �A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum� and �A Little Night Music,� were, to put it kindly, hardly representative of the effect the shows had onstage.
Some Broadway purists will gripe about how the film of �Sweeney Todd� omits and abridges certain songs, reshapes the drama to a degree or just can�t measure up to their cherished memories of Angela Lansbury�s wondrous performance as Mrs. Lovett. But it will be hard to argue that Burton and his cohorts have not imaginatively reconceived the piece as a work of cinema; strictly in film terms, �Sweeney� is seamless, coherent and vibrant, with scarcely a trace of �Broadway.�
The flip side of these virtues is that the immaculately designed settings and lack of breathing room lend the film a claustrophobic feel that underlines its status as an art work. Other qualitative considerations to the side, this aspect makes �Sweeney Todd� most recall the much-debated �Evita� among screen versions of post-�60s musicals.
Eschewing trademark mannerisms and flights of fancy, and yet fully imprinting the film with his signature, Burton strongly delivers the dark core of this story of a lower-class London barber whose thirst for revenge against a venal judge gives birth to a prodigious serial killer. Yarn has questionable real-life origins in the 18th century, but came to prominence as a story and a stage drama in the mid-19th century, and in 1973 served as the inspiration for the Christopher Bond play that attracted Sondheim�s attention.
As Sweeney Todd (Depp) sails up the Thames with a young man, Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), having escaped from prison in Australia, his bitterly ironic commentary in �No Place Like London� firmly defines the side of the city the film will occupy; in production designer Dante Ferretti�s superb realization, it is a squalid place of narrow streets and dingy rooms. Evoking old Hollywood horror pics, Burton has made something very close to a real black-and-white film, as Ferretti�s sets, the extensive CGI backgrounds, Dariusz Wolski�s lensing, Colleen Atwood�s costumes and the pale makeup are synchronized to permit only traces of bold color -- mostly red -- to accent a world dominated by shades of gray, blue, white and black.
Sweeney Todd returns with the single-minded intention of killing Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, as deliciously sinister as fans know he can be), who locked him up on false charges so he could make off with the younger man�s lovely wife Lucy and young daughter.
Installed in a room above a dismal pie shop run by his slovenly long-ago landlady, Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter), Sweeney has his desire for payback sharpened by the news that Lucy killed herself out of distress and Turpin is now romantically inclined toward Sweeney�s now-teenage daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener), who coincidentally catches the eye of the naively romantic Anthony (Campbell Bower�s screen future seems assured, thanks to looks so striking that they distract one from looking even at Depp).
Sweeney�s murderous career commences to the detriment of a fellow barber, charlatan and con artist Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen), following a public musical �duel� to determine who in London can administer the quickest, closest shave. Cohen, in his first screen appearance since �Borat,� makes the most of this brief but expansive supporting role, broadly playing the braggart showman with, as required, two different accents and highly colorful costumes.
Mrs. Lovett, a widow who signals her enduring love for Sweeney by having carefully kept his collection of gleaming razors through the years, makes a quick moral adjustment to her boarder�s bloody enterprise by using his victims� flesh in her meat pies, which brings her business roaring back to life.
All the while, Judge Turpin and his malevolent henchman Beadle Bamford (an unctuous, gruesomely toothsome Timothy Spall) frustratingly elude Sweeney�s clutches; once they�re on to him and Anthony, the virtuous Johanna is thrown into an asylum, while Mrs. Lovett begins entertaining delusions of happily-ever-after domestic bliss with Sweeney.
Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler fashioned a darkly effective morality tale out of this descent into madness, one Logan has elegantly whittled down to two hours from three to satisfy the more concise specifications of the screen. Dialogue is present when needed, but the vast majority of the text and drama is conveyed via the songs, which themselves have sometimes been shortened -- with verses removed -- with little loss in impact. 
Burton stages the singing sequences with precision and fluidity; as most of them are intimate one-or-two-person affairs and not production numbers in the traditional sense, he approaches them as he would dramatic scenes, in degrees of closeup and with an emphasis on content and forward movement. Music has always played a major role in his films (notably in his previous pic, �Charlie and the Chocolate Factory�) and this represents one happy instance of a film made by a director without stage experience that genuinely serves the intentions of the original piece.
Heavy curiosity will center on how Depp, in particular, manages the vocals (all the actors performed their songs themselves). The answer is, perfectly well, thank you. The ever-resourceful thesp doesn�t take the half-measure of sing-speaking in the manner of Rex Harrison or Richard Burton, but puts across his many numbers with an agreeable voice that effectively registers the lyrics� import.
The same goes for Bonham Carter, a similarly untrained vocalist, who works in the same vein of successfully acting her role through song. There is deeply buried emotion and charged motivations in both characters that Depp and Bonham Carter consistently express, and the eerie similarity of their looks -- the endlessly dark eyes, cascading black hair, delicate facial structure, sunken cheeks, exaggerated lips, slight stature -- accentuates the characters� complicity; at one point, they are both so pale, they look like they�ve been done up in whiteface.
Another effective connection is made between Sweeney and his mortal enemy, Rickman�s hanging judge; both express the view, and justify their predisposition for meting out severe punishment, that all men have done something in their lives that make them deserve to die. It is certainly true of the two of them, no matter that one is the antihero, and the other the villain, of the piece.
The narrow, heavily deterministic and, yes, gushingly bloody nature of the show (more than enough to warrant its R rating) serves to mute the exhilaration to a degree, but producers Richard Zanuck, Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald (and Sondheim, who had approval of the director and actors) deserve credit for ensuring that everyone involved on the picture was the right person for the job.


Several seasons into the post-2001 millennium, it's apparent that the long-moribund Hollywood  musical returns to life each December in the form of a single prospective Oscar nominee. Still, as effectively overwrought and generally excellent as it is, Tim Burton 's R-rated Sweeney Todd  seems unlikely to be this year's Chicago  or Dreamgirls .
For one thing, this particular walking corpse is actually a movie about a walking corpse. For another, there's that most un-Yuletide serial-killer premise of Stephen Sondheim 's great 1979 show, a miasmic tale of Victorian London in which a vengeful barber carves up his customers who, butchered and baked into pies by his adoring landlady, are eagerly devoured by a foul lot of greedy customers.
Burton has taken Sondheim's quasi-operatic, mock-penny-dreadful exercise in Dickensian-Brechtian Grand Guignol as the pretext for something highly personal and typically obsessive. From its magnificently gory credits to its climactic bloodbath pietà, the director makes it clear that this is his meat. As much as he's a filmmaker, Burton is also a graphic artist in the tradition of Charles Addams  and Edward Gorey and here he's successfully incorporated Sweeney Todd  into his own distinctively dank and spidery gothic world.
Sweeney Todd  is a movie of bombastic, impossible camera moves and rhapsodic yuckiness. Burton can't resist filling the screen with scuttling vermin or surges of splatterific violence. Sweeney Todd  has been made with actorsBurton axioms Johnny Depp  as the demon barber, and Helena Bonham Carter  playing his accomplice Mrs. Lovettbut, as hyper-designed as the production is, it's only a few stop-motion stutter-steps away from the puppet animation of The Nightmare Before Christmas  or Corpse Bride .
Depp's Sweeney  is an icon, a fiery-eyed, razor-brandishing cadaver with a mad Pagliacci glare. Bonham Carter is comparably corpse-likea matched composition in bird-nest hairdo, death-pallor complexion, and heavily shadowed eyes. This ghoulishly attractive couple is supported by a suitable gang of gargoyles, including Alan Rickman  as Sweeney's doppelgängerthe malignant magistrate responsible for wrecking his lifeand, as the judge's henchman, Timothy Spall , who even sings. A foppish Sacha Baron Cohen  bursts on-screen as Sweeney's rival Pirellireveling in the opportunity for gross ethnic impersonation as he maximizes every celluloid second.
Sondheim evidently approved the casting, although the singing is barely more than adequate. Depp has a pleasing, if untrained, tenor but Bonham Carter's sweetly tentative voice has none of the coarse vitality that the original Mrs. Lovett, Angela Lansbury , brought to the role. Still, the numbers are so inventively staged that two of Bonham Carter's key songsthe cannibal waltz "A Little Priest" and the grotesquely wistful "By the Sea"brought down the house at the preview I attended. Burton manages to open up the play even as he stylizes it, choreographing scenes in bedlam and the sewers, as well as the vacation resort of Mrs. Lovett's febrile imagination. Possibly not since Vincente Minnelli  has anyone directed a musical with such absolute mise-en-scéne.
As great as Sondheim's score for Sweeney Todd  was, so was his ambition. The show's major dramatic, if not musical, precursor is Kurt Weill  and Bertolt Brecht 's Threepenny Opera . Indeed, Sweeney Todd  might have lifted its omophagic thesis from the opera's second-act finale, "What Keeps Mankind Alive?" It's striking that Burton has dropped "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd," the most Threepenny -esque of Sondheim's numbers, from the movie. Did he assume that such overt theatricality wouldn't work on-screen? Staged as though to encompass the entire Industrial Revolution, Sondheim's discordant and lyrical Sweeney Todd  was a metaphor in search of its meaningwas it a work of social protest or a revenge tragedy? A study of abnormal pathology or a joke played upon the audience?
Burton's expertly trimmed adaptation tilts decisively toward the last possibility. He solves the problem, in part, by ignoring the play's various subtexts. The original ending is softened, albeit without diluting Sondheim's dark humor. No Greek tragedy, this Hollywood Sweeney  is a fun  creepy-crawly. If nothing else, Burton has learned that the successfully gruesome is its own reward.
