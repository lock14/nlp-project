The ads are making "Vacancy " look like the latest meat-grinding horror special to come down the chute in the wake of "Saw " and "The Hills Have Eyes ." It's not. It's an entrance exam. And a pretty good one at that.
Director Nimrod Antal made a stylish Hungarian film in 2003 called "Kontroll ," about brutal power games among the ganglike employees of the Budapest subway system. Riding on that festival hit, the L A -raised director has returned home to see what Hollywood might offer and come up with a stripped-down suspense drama that, at its best, begs comparisons to Steven Spielberg's breakthrough TV movie "Duel ." At its worst, "Vacancy" is merely the kind of taut B-chiller they don't make any more, other than to riff on them in "Grindhouse. "
The set-up is as simple and stark as an urban legend. A bickering married couple, David (Luke Wilson ) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale ) have car trouble on a country highway miles from the interstate. They hike back to a motel run by a weird little night manager (Frank Whaley ) and take the honeymoon suite. They put on a videotape, which shows a horrific scene of murder so realistic it could be a snuff film.
In fact, it is
 a snuff film. And it was filmed in the room they're standing in.
The rest is pure cat-and-mouse, but as scripted by Mark L. Smith and directed without an ounce of fat by Antal, it's nastily intelligent cat-and-mouse that rarely cheats the audience. "Vacancy" squeezes the maximum in suspense out of the minimum in location (with a relative minimum of gore; how's that for a trick?). It runs through every permutation of the motel-hell concept, and when it's done, it stops. Really: It just stops. I don't know when I've seen a thriller this unpretentiously well-crafted sputter to so inconsequential an end.
Still, the filmmakers sketch in enough of David and Amy's backstory for us to want them to survive. (Again, such novelty.) The two have a dead child that has driven them to the brink of divorce; according to this movie, nothing says "couple's therapy" like a backwoods maniac coming at you with a digital camera and a butcher knife.
Wilson and Beckinsale aren't given much time to indulge in acting, thankfully, so their performances are harried and real. Whaley creates a memorable cracker-barrel lunatic behind those oversize aviators; I'd swear he was modeling his role on Dennis Weaver's jittery night clerk in the Orson Welles classic "Touch of Evil ."
Maybe that's not a coincidence. Unlike the new wave of torture porn, "Vacancy" feels like it was made by people who love movies and perhaps have seen a lot of them. Those snuff flicks on the motel TV offer an implicit critique, too: What kind of person gets off on that? Someone for whom "Saw III" just isn't enough? The movie unnervingly hints there's a vast audience out there, and one that's willing to pay retail.
I don't want to oversell the thing. There's no agenda in "Vacancy" other than to keep you in a state of nervous collapse for 85 minutes, but Antal fulfills it honorably for the most part (that ending truly is a disappointment) and in so doing raises the stakes for his own future. Now let's see what he can really do.


         The unhappy marrieds who stray off the interstate in "Vacancy" think that the most unpleasant thing awaiting them is a night in the same bed. But when their car breaks down on a quiet rural road, the only place to stay is a run-down motel with some particularly creepy amenities. Mattress stains and untraceable smells aren't the half of it.
 
 Staffed by a twitchy manager (Frank Whaley) whose passive-aggressive hospitality is straight out of a Jim Thompson novel, the Pinewood Motel is a city dweller's idea of hell. No restaurant, no cable, not even running water, unless you count the brown sludge oozing from the taps. What it does have is hidden video cameras, a secret entrance and a stack of videotapes showing previous occupants being gruesomely murdered by men with long knives and silver masks. Without knowing it, David (Luke Wilson) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale) have been cast in a snuff film, and its climax is fast approaching.
 


         






   At first glance, "Vacancy" seems to be the latest entry in the lamentable "torture porn" genre, whose films mainly involve waiting for the next vaguely sympathetic character to have his or her vital organs pulled out with a fork. But director Nimród Antal and writer Mark L. Smith are up to something a bit cannier as well as more devious.
 
 "Vacancy" is a ruthlessly efficient stalk-and-slash machine. Antal, whose previous movie, "Kontroll," involved a killer set loose in Budapest's subways,  knows how to milk tension from confined spaces and low lighting.
 
 But "Vacancy" starts to turn in on itself once David discovers that they've been imprisoned in a psychopath's version of a  movie set, complete with multiple camera angles and in-house editing system. Suddenly,  "Vacancy" becomes a critique of sadistic thrillers, at the same time still serving as a crackerjack example of the genre.
 
 Self-awareness can be an easy out, but Antal's friendly fire finds its mark, especially when a panicked Amy asks her husband why anyone would want to watch another human being violently murdered. David fixes the lens with an icy glare and sneers, "They're enjoying themselves."
 
 Antal and his cinematographer, Andrzej Sekula, are clearly having their own kind of fun, using reflections and split-focus lenses to toy with the audience's perceptions. The shot that pulls back from a TV monitor to show  Whaley savoring his captives' distress might well keep retreating until Antal comes into view, rubbing his hands with glee.
 
 However much he's enjoying the show, however, Antal exercises restraint at key moments. For all the screaming on those snuff tapes, we don't actually see much in the way of blood and guts, especially by the slaughterhouse standards of "Hostel" or "Turistas." He even hides a brutal beating behind a curtain, which in this context is equivalent to a porno movie in which the actors perform under the sheets.
 
 Wilson and Beckinsale's brittle bickering quickly grows tiresome, but Whaley gives his off-kilter killer surprising depth. Casting himself as an omnipotent figure, he's reduced to a whimpering pervert once things stop going his way. That still leaves open the question of whom those tapes he's been making are meant for. What kind of sicko would watch this stuff? The answer lies no farther than the ticket in your hand.
 
 "Vacancy." MPAA rating: R for brutal violence and terror, brief nudity and language. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes. In general release.   

Vacancy  is a schlock surprise: a no-frills motel-hell slasher film  with a bit of soul. It's proof that when characters are under attack by anonymous masked goons, it really is  better if the victims aren't just walking slabs of starlet meat. Luke Wilson, with his hangdog defensive mopiness, and Kate Beckinsale, all sexy severity, are ideally matched as a couple who hate each other. They're David and Amy Fox, soon to be divorced, who find themselves stranded on an anonymous highway in the middle of the night, picking away at each other's emotional scabs. Their tit-for-tat squabbling is itchy and funny, especially compared with the usual teen-horror-film jabber.
When these two wander into the Pinewood Motel, a roadside relic that looks as if it hasn't been housecleaned since the late 1970s, it's obvious that Vacancy  is going to be an homage to the granddaddy of all psycho thrillers. It also looks like a comic nightmare set in the Twilight Zone. The motel's manager (Frank Whaley) is a geek in a sardine mustache and aviator frames who emerges from an office, where he's watching what sounds like torture porn. He's a gloss on Norman Bates, but Whaley, all passive-aggressive frowns, plays this odd-duck creep with what might be called understated overstatement. The whole movie is like that: It's grind-house trash done with style. (It's also a tidy 80 minutes.)
When David and Amy get inside their motel room, it's a squalid dump, but the rotting decor, which looks like early Brady Bunch  house meets Saw , is so colorfully grubby there's suspense lurking in every diseased nook and cranny. Before long, the two are being terrorized by ferocious knocks on the door, and when David discovers a pile of dusty videotapes, the torture and murder porn on them  looks all too real. The creepy part is, the tapes were shot in that same motel room. Vacancy 's director, Nimrod Antal, made the technically impressive but turgid 2004 Hungarian subway drama Kontroll , but this time he gives every scene a spin of finesse. David and Amy have to crawl through a rat-infested tunnel and use a car as a weapon, but though the action is sometimes over-the-top, the staging never is. That's why Vacancy  is truly scary. It's also undeniably a formula flick: Once you figure out where the movie is going, it never once veers off its sadistic, don't-peek-behind-the-shower-curtain course. But this is one fear ride that almost gets you to care.

 This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. Luke Wilson, who could stand a career intervention, and Kate Beckinsale, the reigning queen of the bland B's, play a sniping couple who undergo a little unexpected marital therapy by landing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Having strayed off the Interstate one evening in the middle of nowhere, they   end up in a motor inn run by Frank Whaley that, in the real world, would have been repackaged for its self-conscious retro-ugly hipster chic.  This being a movie, the motel is actually a charnel house in which the shag carpeting does little to muffle the screams of the dying. The gimmick here is that the butcher in residence likes to watch, you know, kind of like that Norman Bates guy, but with a video camera whirring, which means that the motel is a handy-dandy snuff-movie studio. The other director in residence, Nimrod Antal ("Kontroll"), tries to polish this junk with flashy camera work and some nitwit self-reflexivity — you see, we like to watch too — reserving most of his energy for the snuff-movie loops playing on monitors throughout the motel.  "Vacancy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The usual: knife and gun violence, brief female nudity, profanity.

There's no better form of marriage therapy -- according to the torture-chic horror romp "Vacancy" -- than being stuck in a fleabag motel and threatened by psychotic killers. Better yet, make that mask-wearing sadists who not only want to terrify, abuse and kill you, but also sell videos of your painful demise. Whether a movie about snuff films is morally superior to a snuff film is a question for debate, but "Vacancy" should have no trouble making B.O. hay in a marketplace hungry for the next big outrage.
Dubious ethical aspects aside, Nimrod Antal proves himself an able director who has made a highly cinematic movie. Shooter Andrzej Sekula's compositionsare startling for a film of this ilk, the pace is appropriately brisk and everything clicks, at least visually. Antal may rely on closeups -- and extreme closeups -- more than anyone since Carl Dreyer, but what he creates is a sense that something is always looming just outside the strangulated frame. Whether it's David Fox (Luke Wilson), his bitterly estranged wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale), or the crawlingly evil motel clerk Mason (Frank Whaley), neither they, nor viewers, ever seem to be alone.
Of course, the level of terror is proportional to the level of plausible threat, and here "Vacancy" falls a bit short. Checking into Mason's repulsively squalid inn, David and Amy, whose relationship is essentially over, are immediately harassed by slamming on the walls and what sounds like pneumatic hammers on their door.
It soon becomes clear that David and Amy have almost nothing between them and the perpetrators of the sordid crimes they find themselves watching on tapes in the room's VCR -- which, they soon realize, were taped in that very same room. That the room itself would then provide sanctuary for so much of the movie not only strains belief; it's laughable. And, of course, laughter doesn't do much for the cause of terror.
At the risk of spoiling anything, "Vacancy," is one strange movie. It ends so precipitously, one can only assume it's a setup for the sequel (which, given all that happens, seems a mite unlikely).
The substantive issue to be taken with the pic, however, is its reliance on inexplicable cruelty and viciousness. Seldom has criminal violence been so unabashedly used for entertainment, in a story in which the criminals are perpetrating violence to be sold as entertainment. It's doubtful the filmmakers were intending to deliver an oblique moral argument against their own movie, but they did so all the same.

Perfectly suited to the shabby delights of the hometown drive-in theaters of yester-year, director Nimród Antal 's creepy cockroach of a thriller feels less horrifying than it does curiously nostalgic. David (Luke Wilson ) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale ) Fox are a bickering couple driving back to L.A. when David's wrong turns lead them to the Pinewood, an old motel where, they soon realize, manager Mason intends to make them the stars of his next grisly snuff film. Antal smartly adheres to the no- frills demands of B-movie horror, eliciting impressive chills from old-fashioned suffocating dread rather than the now usual gore. And Wilson and Beckinsale superbly execute everything that's required of their charactersnamely, yelling and running. At a time when so many genre films go splat because of large budgets or big egos, the small-scale pleasures of Vacancy are a welcome surprise.
