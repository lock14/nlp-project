You could call it Seabiscuit Jr.
, but this horsey DreamWorks heartwarmer does something very surprising in spite of its underdog sports-movie formula, its sun-dappled beauty shots of Kentucky thoroughbred farms, and its shameless emotional manipulation of innocent viewers who are jerked between the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in almost every scene: It manages to be a watchable, even enjoyable movie about and for girls, and in our world of candy-coated sparkly pink crap, that�s a rare and commendable thing. Dreamer
 is not � I repeat, is not � challenging or avant-garde cinema; Gatins (in his directorial debut) is the scribe of Coach Carter
 and Hard Ball
, and he�s never met a clich� he didn�t like. Upon its "true story" (actually that of racing mare Mariah�s Storm, a filly that won several Grade III-stakes races after recovering from a broken leg) Gatins has superimposed plucky Cale Crane (Fanning), a Kentucky grade-schooler whose father, Ben (Russell), brings home a broken-legged horse he�s been training, refusing to have her put down after she falters on the track. Cale falls in love with the horse (animal actor Sacrifice), feeds her Popsicles, and Never Gives Up. You can pretty much take it from there. But the movie has a lot going for it if you look at it right: Hayseed farm kid and broken-down abused animal join forces to fight Big Money assholes and beat them at their own game. Gatins cuts the sugar by surrounding Fanning with a who�s-who of crusty old codgers, most notably Kristofferson, who arrives in the film scowling and backlit, like he�s going to start thrashing someone with his cane. He�s magnificent. Cale has a mother (Shue, Botoxed into a rictus of perpetual surprise), but the movie isn�t interested in her, so Gatins assigns her to a roadside diner and brings her back whenever Russell and Fanning need a cheerleader for their crazy dreams. Gatins does regard the father-daughter relationship seriously, and the roles are well-acted. Poor Fanning takes a lot of guff for being a snaggle-toothed, googly-eyed child actor, but she really is awfully poised; maybe part of the problem is that Hollywood doesn�t like children and is always squeezing them into outlandish situations (imperiled by aliens, having macabre visions with their imaginary friends) instead of letting them be actual human beings. In one scene, Ben is made to read a school assignment Cale has written. Of course it�s a story about magical horses and faraway kingdoms while actually being about her dad (she is, after all, a little girl), but the scene works because Russell is so low-key, so gruff and wizened, with just the tiniest little crack in his Carhartt farmer facade for his feelings to seep through. In other words, Dreamer
 is worth several Princess Diaries
 or Lizzie McGuire
s. It doesn�t have any shopping montages. Fanning never once talks on the phone � to anyone. It makes you realize how truly abysmal, how truly bankrupt and nauseating, most mainstream entertainment for young girls is.

Just in case you didn't know that ''Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story" was inspired by a true story, they've gone and spelled it out for you right in the title. This is annoying to newspaper editors and the poor slob whose job it is to change the theater marquee, but a studio has to work with what it has, even if this family crowd-pleaser about a horse, a girl, and her dad didn't include the latter two in reality.
There was a horse, Mariah's Storm, who came back from a crippling 1993 leg injury to win a number of 1995 Kentucky races. This so moved writer-director John Gatins that he has wrapped a fictional saga of intergenerational bonding and triumph around it. ''Dreamer: Vaguely Suggested by an Actual Horse" doesn't cut it, though. Besides, all you really need to care about is whether the movie works.
It does, especially if you're young enough to have never seen a horse movie before or old enough to temporarily induce amnesia. With a gentle charm out of all proportion to its near-total lack of originality, ''Dreamer: IBATS" is -- thank God -- closer to ''Seabiscuit" than to ''Racing Stripes." For that, you can thank the entire cast of able underplayers, most notably Dakota Fanning, who continues to craft her roles with more subtlety than most of the voting membership of the Screen Actors Guild.
She portrays Cale, the 11-year-old daughter of horse trainer Ben Crane (Kurt Russell), not as a Miss Prissypants or a tweener groovy-girl but simply as a kid who misses her workaholic dad and wouldn't mind a horse to share him with. There's precedent: Ben is the son of grizzled horse-whisperer Pop Crane (Kris Kristofferson), who's living in self-righteous exile in the barn after selling off the family land to the racehorse-loving Arab prince (Oded Fehr) next door. ''Dreamer: IBATS" has some soft but interesting insights into how the generations of middle-class horse people in this part of the country have been edged out by foreign money and nouveau riche yuppies.
Ben trains horses for one of the yuppies, a soulless stable owner named Palmer (David Morse, acting with his sunglasses) who urges him to race a 2-year-old filly named Sonador -- Spanish for ''dreamer" -- despite the trainer's misgivings. The horse goes down with a broken leg and is almost put down, but Ben looks into his daughter's eyes and has a change of heart. Buying Sonador from Palmer for the price of his back pay, he hangs her up in traction in his barn. Maybe he'll be able to breed her, he thinks. Cale has other ideas, not all of which involve sneaking cherry popsicles to this equine pinata when no one's looking.
''Dreamer: IBATS" isn't wholly predictable. Cale doesn't become a jockey, for one thing, but opts to rehabilitate Manny (Freddy Rodriguez of ''Six Feet Under"), a scarred former jockey turned stable hand. Other members of the home team include groom Balon (Luis Guzman) and Cale's strong-and-steady mom (Elisabeth Shue), who slaves in the local diner to make ends meet. Even Pop gets pulled into the longshot drama.
The movie gets a surprising amount of mileage, comic and otherwise, out of Pop and Ben's inability to express their emotions -- there's a reason they spend most of their time with horses -- and Fanning plays Cale as cut from the same dour cloth. When the script calls for her to beam with joy, you don't quite buy it; when storm clouds cross her face and she tucks her feelings out of sight, you're able to read her like a book. The role is beneath Fanning's abilities, but why should she care? She's 11 years old and acting in a horse movie.
There's a nice little empowerment fantasy here, too, when Ben signs Sonador over to Cale as majority owner and basically says, ''We're working for you." This leads to a fine face-off with the racing board of governors and to Cale seeking sponsorship from that nice Arab prince. We're in Shirley Temple territory by now, but the movie has worked its way there with reasonable honesty. The ending's never in doubt, but you don't mind pretending it is, especially if there's someone small sitting next to you.
Just rent the kid ''National Velvet" when you get home. That movie's proof you don't need a true story to be inspired.

         It should come as no surprise that dreams do in fact come true in "Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story," a classic underfilly tale about a girl, her horse and the family farm they bet against when dad Ben (Kurt Russell) accepts an injured racehorse as partial severance after getting himself fired from his job as a horse trainer.
 
  Directed by John Gatins (screenwriter for "Varsity Blues" and "Coach Carter"), the film stars Russell, Dakota Fanning and Kris Kristofferson as three generations of Kentucky horse breeders whose now 100% equine-free horse farm has been all but sold off to the Arab prince (Oded Fehr) next door.
 


         






    Now Pop (Kristofferson) spends his days skulking around in an adjacent house not talking to his son, while daughter-in-law Lilly (Elisabeth Shue) picks up extra shifts at the diner and Ben stays up late with a calculator. The only member of the Crane family who dreams of reviving the family business is young Cale (Fanning). She tags along to work with Ben on the day his boss (David Morse) pushes him to race a filly called Soñador (Sonya for short), despite Ben's feeling that something is wrong with her leg.
 
  When the leg shatters during the race, Ben refuses to have the filly put down in front of his daughter, and by the end of the day, he and Cale have returned home with the all-but-useless Sonya and two new employees in tow: a trainer named Balon (Luis Guzman) and an exercise jockey named Manolín (Freddy Rodriguez), whose early career was also derailed by an injury.
 
  From there, it's more or less "Rocky" for kids, as the horse, of course, brings the family together, gets the jockey back in the saddle and saves the farm, all thanks to Cale's faith and perseverance. What it lacks in originality, "Dreamer" makes up for in coziness.
 
  Sweet and unassuming, it lopes along against the beautiful, bucolic landscape of Kentucky and Louisiana, where it was shot on location by Fred Murphy.
 
  The low-key charm of its setting underscores the easygoing performances of a relaxed, well-matched cast. Kristofferson doesn't oversell the grizzled grandpa routine or talk down to the little girl.
 
  Fanning radiates intelligence and poise while acting her age — a rare gift these days. "Dreamer" keeps the cuteness in check, so the predictable happy ending is more dessert than cream pie in the face.
 
  There may not be much left to say about the relationship between a girl and her horse (it's a power trip, basically, but a comfy, loving power trip), but "Dreamer" says it all again in a way that's nice to hear.

One more feel-great sports movie with a teen-poetry title and Kurt Russell will have himself a trilogy. A year after the hockey fable Miracle , the actor stars in Dreamer , a horse-race drama whose complete handle is Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story , inelegantly disarming any criticism of the movie's believability from the get-go. It's the tale of a lame filly saved from death and turned into a champion by a trainer (Russell) and his daughter (old pro Dakota Fanning). That part's okay; the final race even gets you going a bit. But Miracle  was better because there, Russell's character made sense. Here, for no real reason, he acts aloof around his kid, and the forced family dynamics just drag the movie down.

 The movie's official, unwieldy title is "Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story" - which could mean anything, really.  In any case, the story, in its rough outlines, is certainly a familiar one; its themes are the overcoming of past disappointment, reconciliation between parent and child and the triumph of the underdog, which in this case is a horse. Parents who accompany their children to this film,  written and directed by John Gatins (whose other writing credits include "Coach Carter"),  will find themselves anticipating just about every plot turn, and nodding as each premonition is fulfilled. Nodding through tears, I should add. Yes, "Dreamer" follows a formula, but the formula, when applied with skill and intelligence, as it is here, is pretty much foolproof.  Set in the green horse country around Lexington, Ky., the movie concerns a farm family fallen on hard times. Most of its land has been sold off, and Ben Crane (Kurt Russell) trains horses for spoiled princes and their coldhearted minions. Ben barely speaks to his crusty father (Kris Kristofferson), and does not have much time for his daughter, Cale (Dakota Fanning), who has inherited  the family's horse-whispering gene and more than a bit of her dad's stubbornness. (Her blond cuteness must come from her mother, played by Elisabeth Shue.)  One day at the racetrack, a filly Ben has been training breaks a leg, and rather than stand by as the horse is put down, he impulsively decides to take her home. Her name is Sonya, short for Soñador, which is Spanish for dreamer, a piece of information that takes a curiously long time to emerge. In any case, Ben and Cale, with the help of a wisecracking groomsman (Luis Guzmán) and a sweet-natured jockey (Freddy Rodriguez, late of "Six Feet Under"), nurse Sonya back to health, after which ...  Well, I'll leave it there, since even a story that ends with a long-shot entry in the Breeders' Cup deserves to have its twists and turns protected. Children will worry at occasional reversals of fortune and sigh happily when things come right again. Adults, meanwhile, can relish the fine work of the cast, thoroughbreds all, who do the material the honor of not condescending to it. Mr. Russell seems temperamentally incapable of dishonesty or overstatement, and his dry, taciturn presence inoculates the picture against mawkishness. (He performed a similar service as the fiercely reserved hockey coach in "Miracle"). Ms. Fanning, neither kidnapped by bandits (as in "Man on Fire") nor menaced by aliens (as in "War of the Worlds"), gives a similarly quiet performance, restraining the impulse to be cute and winsome in favor of some serious acting. Cale, who idolizes her father, pointedly imitates his mannerisms and habits of speech, and Ms. Fanning, a quick study, absorbs Mr. Russell's quiet warmth.  David Morse, in a silver beard and a dark suit, is delightfully mean as the main villain, essentially a suave update of the archetypal top-hatted plutocrat. His presence allows "Dreamer" to shake off some of the aristocratic airs of its chosen sport and find a strain of populism. This has to be fudged a bit once the matter of Breeders' Cup entrance fees, which run into six figures, comes up. But  never mind. The film's basic moral distinction is between those who come to horse racing for reasons of egoism or greed and those who do it for love. Maybe all that really needs to be said about "Dreamer" is that it  was made for the right reasons.  "Dreamer" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some scenes of human and equine distress.

Modestly engaging but mostly unexceptional, family-friendly "Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story" likely will sprint through theatrical tracks before grazing in greener pastures as a homevid product. Pic boasts appealing performances by ever-reliable Kurt Russell as a Kentucky horse trainer and hot property Dakota Fanning as his adoring daughter. But the derivative plot about the rehabilitation of an injured thoroughbred will surprise only those in the youngest level of the target demographic. 
Scripter John Gatins ("Coach Carter") sticks to a well-trod path in his debut effort as feature helmer. Very loosely based on real-life exploits of Mariah's Storm, a promising filly who triumphed over a near-crippling injury in the early 1990s, the largely fictionalized scenario misses few opportunities to yank at heartstrings while following an equine survivor on the comeback trail.
In the wake of financial setbacks at his family's horse farm, vet trainer Ben Crane (Russell) works for wealthy stable owner Palmer (David Morse, sneering haughtily). But when Palmer's up-and-coming filly named Sonador (which translates, of course, as "Dreamer") breaks a leg during a high stakes race, Crane refuses to follow orders and put the animal down. He's especially reluctant to shoot the injured filly in front of his young daughter, Cale (Fanning), who just happens to be visiting the track on the day of the accident.
After an angry clash with Palmer, Crane quits -- and takes the injured Sonador as part of his severance pay. It's a bold move for a man teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and Crane's estranged father (Kris Kristofferson), another horse expert, is only too quick to deride his son's decision. But with a little help from stablehands Balon (Luis Guzman) and Manolin (Freddy Rodriguez), and a lot of enthusiastic attentiveness from Cale, Crane manages to heal the horse in time for an against-all-odds run in the Breeders Cup.
Russell and Fanning develop a father-daughter relationship both believable and compelling. Indeed, some of their scenes together -- including a playful conversation about Cale's feeding Popsicles to the mending filly -- have the feel of savvy improvisation. Kristofferson provides a few moments of weathered wisdom laced with grizzled crankiness. Unfortunately, other key cast members are unable to do more than go through the motions in thinly written roles.
Pic is at once contrived and simplistic while cantering toward finish line. Parallels between the horse's physical recovery and the family's emotional reunion are dutifully underscored, often to satisfying dramatic effect. The most distinctive plot wrinkle involves the fortuitous involvement of a visiting Arab prince (Oded Fehr) who has personal reasons to support Sonador's Breeders Cup bid. 
Fred Murphy merits mention for his attractive lensing of Louisiana and Kentucky locations.

It's about a quick-footed horse, but Dreamer 's only feat is winding up slower than Seabiscuit . Adults will be restless as stabled bucks, but even children may need unusually high Ritalin  doses to slog through the visual and dramatic indifference on display. "Inspired by a true story" generally translates to "prompted by a true story but reconstituted as a cliché pileup." A promising horse is injured, but father (Kurt Russell ) and daughter (Dakota Fanning ) don't kill it, for sentimental reasons. Eventually Russell transfers ownership to Fanning, leading to race-qualifying meetings where the pre-teen holds her own alongside adult trainersexcept for meanie David Morse , who upbraids his twee colleague in public. Dad worries about losing money, but Grandpa (a grizzled Kris Kristofferson ) encourages the girl to follow her racetrack dreams. Meanwhile, viewers will be encouraged to sleep, to dream of better movies.
