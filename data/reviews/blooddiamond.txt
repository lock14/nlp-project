As a means to drive home its chief argument � that the 14-carat rock on your fianc�e's ring finger might be little more than a blood-drenched byproduct of an African civil war � the stringent verisimilitude of Blood Diamond
 includes endless sequences of slaughter, bloodthirsty child soldiers, and politically motivated dismemberment, which is rough, gory stuff. That it's taken hip-hop star Kanye West's Grammy-winning track "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" to fully coalesce the issue in the mind of the public is a thoroughly depressing commentary on our bling-addled culture, but at least the facts are readily available. You can view Zwick's action-packed take on the issue as a social critique masquerading as cineplex fodder, but in this case the Hollywood tropes of the storyline very nearly overwhelm the subject matter. (As far as African-crisis movies go, Terry George's Hotel Rwanda
 is still the benchmark.) DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a former mercenary who now operates a lucrative diamond-smuggling trade in war-torn Sierra Leone. When he hears of the discovery of a rock the size of a baby's fist by enslaved diamond-digger Solomon Vandy (Hounsou), he schemes to locate this ultimate payday. Then, after a crisis of conscience that arrives in the form of Connelly's crusading Yank journalist, he aids Vandy in retrieving not only the carbonized prize but the man's displaced family. Vandy's teenage son has been captured, drugged, and brainwashed by the vicious Revolutionary United Front rebel faction, which makes Archer's job more difficult but later provides the crux of his ricocheting character arc. Blood Diamond
 is by turns moving, horrific, and bombastic; rarely if ever do the characters speak in nonexpositional sentences, and even this trio of intensely talented actors occasionally finds themselves battered by the ceaseless barrage of atrocity. Blood Diamond
 works best when it puts its social message on the back burner and cuts to the interlinking machinations of sidebar characters like the colonel, Archer's merc prot�g� (the always-excellent South African actor Vosloo) and RUF maniac Captain Poison (Harewood). While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months' salary.


"Blood Diamond" is about the moral conundrums of the international gem trade, but the movie offers its own form of barter. If you attend our lecture on Third World suffering and First World culpability, promise the filmmakers, we will give you Leonardo DiCaprio pitching woo to Jennifer Connelly and, yea, many loud and hair-raising action scenes. If you want to further examine the ethics behind your engagement ring, that's up to you -- but we sincerely hope you do.
It's a solid deal as these things go, but it's hardly a steal. As directed by Edward Zwick, the "thirtysomething" co-creator who moved on to films great ("Glory"), good ("The Last Samurai"), and neither ("The Siege"), "Blood Diamond" wears both its social conscience and its Hollywood calculation on its sleeve. The movie wants to rouse you to action while narcotizing you with Connelly's bottomless green eyes.
The first half dramatizes the lethal calculus of Africa's "conflict diamond" trade with impressive force. Set in Sierra Leone during the late-1990s civil war, "Blood Diamond" gives us two very different men and asks us to choose a hero. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a village fisherman who dreams that his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers ) will go to college. Danny Archer (DiCaprio) is a former Rhodesian mercenary turned diamond smuggler.
Danny's is a sweet business: The Sierra Leonean rebels trade gems mined by captives for money and weapons, middlemen like him sneak the diamonds over the border to Liberia, and we end up subsidizing the death of thousands when we buy our earrings. "Blood Diamond" shows us the path of one anonymous African through this process and, less convincingly, how a smuggler's moral compass might change direction.
After the rebels attack his village, Solomon is forced into slave labor; he comes upon a huge, rare "pink" diamond that becomes the film's McGuffin -- the thing everyone wants. Danny has been arrested at the border, meanwhile, and catches wind of Solomon's find while the two are in prison, the latter having landed there after government troops have taken the rebel compound.
Pulling strings that lead all the way to the top of the European diamond trade, Danny engineers his and Solomon's release, and a deal is reluctantly brokered: If the white man will help Solomon find his wife (Benu Mabhena ) and children, the black man will lead Danny to the jewel. Complicating matters is that Solomon's son has been brainwashed by the rebels into a pre-adolescent killing machine.
The movie is following recent history so far, and as a consequence, it's ugly as sin. Innocents die and limbs are chopped off, and the film dares you to look away. With the arrival of Connelly's fetching U S reporter, though, "Blood Diamond" takes a turn for the ordinary. Maddy Bowen -- even the name reeks of a screenwriting seminar -- is meant to be the movie's articulate conscience, and Connelly is too good an actress to simper, but her character's here only because Zwick and scripters Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell think you won't pay attention otherwise.
Maybe they're right, but it doesn't help the movie. (Nor does the script's reliance on coincidence in getting such characters as David Harewood's villainous Captain Poison exactly where they need to be.) Hounsou's Solomon nearly gets left behind in all the chaste eye-batting between Danny and Maddy; "Blood Diamond" is another film about black Africa that's really about a white couple. DiCaprio is excellent as Danny, and you almost forget the marvelous things he's doing with his accent, but his performance is undone by his character's escalating nobility.
Zwick makes a handsome film out of this combination of organics and plastic. As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre, in which glamorous movie stars bring our attention to the plight of the less fortunate, "Blood Diamond" is superior to 2003's ridiculous "Beyond Borders" while looking strident and obvious next to last year's "The Constant Gardener."
"T.I.A." -- "This is Africa" -- is the cynical mantra Danny and his fellow mercenaries toss around, but, really, This Is Hollywood. If "Blood Diamond" gets people to ask whether their diamonds have been sanctioned by the internationally agreed-upon Kimberley Process the next time they're at the jeweler, that's a start. Sometimes, though, there's nothing more cynical than the ways in which the film industry sells idealism to the masses.


         An ambitious film that can be viewed as either half empty or half full, "Blood Diamond" attempts something difficult and problematic. It can be pulled apart or appreciated, depending on your mood, but it should be recognized that movies like this have become as rare and potentially valuable as the stone that sets its plot in motion.
 
  Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and a powerful Djimon Hounsou, and set amid the surreal chaos of an Africa in perpetual armed conflict, "Blood Diamond" attempts to be an action thriller with serious political overtones, to be as much position paper as "Zulu Dawn."
 


         






    Directed by Edward Zwick, who believes that "political awareness can be raised as much by entertainment as by rhetoric," "Blood Diamond" attempts to marry the budget and the stars of major league Hollywood with a serious message about difficult un-Hollywood subjects like child soldiers, contraband diamonds and amputations as a tool of war. It is an awkward fit at times, but the attempt is more successful than might be imagined.
 
  It's a mark of the trickiness of the intertwined subjects of diamonds and the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leone that Charles Leavitt's script tackles that "Blood Diamond" has gotten pre-release criticism from all sides of the political spectrum.
 
  De Beers, the international diamond concern, has taken expensive pains to distance itself from the film's scenario and its fictitious cartel Van Der Kaap. The trade arm of the government of South Africa, where the film was in part shot, has a stern on-screen disclaimer insisting it "does not accept any liability for the content and does not necessarily support such content." And the makers of "The Empire in Africa," a new documentary, claim Zwick and company have unnecessarily demonized the rebels who fought for control of the country.
 
  Blood diamonds, sometimes known as conflict stones, were so named in the 1990s by advocacy groups wanting to call attention to the fact that diamonds were being smuggled out of countries at war specifically to buy more arms and kill more people. This situation, the film emphasizes, "created millions of refugees who've never seen a diamond."
 
  One of those folks is Solomon Vandy (Hounsou), a humble Sierra Leone fisherman who wants his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) to be a doctor when he grows up. Those plans are put on hold when the country's rebels attack and destroy Vandy's village, turning his family into refugees and landing Solomon in a rebel-run diamond mine overseen by the appropriately named Captain Poison (David Harewood).
 
  One day Vandy comes upon an enormous pinkish stone, as big as a bird's egg. He manages to hide it before he is captured by government forces and ends up in a prison where his discovery comes to the attention of fellow detainee Danny Archer (DiCaprio). An amoral gunrunner and former mercenary from Zimbabwe, which he insists on calling by its old name of Rhodesia, Danny, like Poison and Vandy himself, wants the stone for its power to change lives.
 
  The only character in the film who doesn't want the diamond is Maddy Bowen (Connelly), an action junkie photojournalist who instead wants Archer's help exposing the ins and outs of the conflict diamond business. She and the soldier of fortune begin one of those flinty and flirtatious movie relationships that is part antagonism, part attraction, all star power.
 
  Given that so many want to lay hands on that stone, "Blood Diamond" contains a considerable amount of plot, smoothly and professionally moved along by director Zwick, who also handles the film's numerous action scenes with a confident touch.
 
  On the other hand, and with this film there is always another hand, when repeated coincidences and numerous hairsbreadth escapes are factored in, all that plotting can sometimes feel like too much of a good thing.
 
  Also noteworthy is DiCaprio's performance in the kind of good-bad guy roles Clark Gable used to knock off before breakfast. This is the new, mature Leo, first glimpsed in "The Departed," and he throws himself into the part with such conviction and skill he makes us believe in his character more than we otherwise might. Despite these best efforts, however, there is not enough of Gable's kind of traditional masculinity in the actor's persona for his work to enlarge the picture as much as it should.
 
  As for DiCaprio's costars, Connelly has some potent speeches and once again proves her ability to hold the screen with major male players. And Hounsou, a native of Benin, factors in his obvious feeling for the continent and creates a passionate portrait of a man determined to find his family again.
 
  Africa is also one of the stars of "Blood Diamond," as cinematographer Eduardo Serra ("Girl With a Pearl Earring"), shooting in Mozambique and Sierra Leone as well as South Africa, convincingly puts the at times wrenching chaos of that continent on screen.
 
  But if the scenes of the transformation of children into soldiers is harrowing stuff, "Blood Diamond" also has a weakness for the Hollywood emotional moment and convenient plot resolutions.
 
  Finally, though, those weaker moments are overshadowed by the film's willingness to risk disturbing an audience's sense of the world and how it is run. "Blood Diamond" is very much aware that these are problems beyond easy and convenient resolution, and it is hard not to appreciate any film that understands that.
 
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for strong violence and language. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes. In general release.   

Righteous indignation is exhausting in a movie  maybe not for the indignant, but certainly for the unsuspecting moviegoing bystander in the path of all that onrushing rectitude. Blood Diamond , set in Sierra Leone, makes a big show of dramatic twists, linking the fates of a white African diamond smuggler, a black African fisherman, and an American journalist in a series of perils set to trumpety action music. But the movie's message is static, medicinal: Don't buy blood diamonds (also known as conflict diamonds, for the bloody African civil wars their sales subsidize). Don't do business with companies that sell blood diamonds. And don't forget to enjoy the chase scenes.
You may not want to eat popcorn under the circumstances. Anyhow, don't say you haven't been thoroughly briefed about what blood diamonds are, not after 132 educational minutes of Djimon Hounsou looking stricken as forced laborer Solomon Vandy (hiding a diamond as big as the Ritz and trying to rescue his scattered family); Leonardo DiCaprio looking conflicted as mercenary Danny Archer (angling to sell Solomon's stone); and Jennifer Connelly looking idealistic but wily as Maddy Bowen (a magazine writer out to report a story no other newshound in America apparently cares about). ''You might catch a minute of this on CNN somewhere between sports and weather,'' she lectures, her flashing eyes turned toward DiCaprio but her words aimed at the audience, or perhaps The Huffington Post. Even though Connelly's Maddy is the dewiest warzone lady since MSNBC's Ashleigh Banfield traipsed off to Afghanistan, she alone can prove that big business is complicit in these dirty dealings. The chemistry between the Lois Lane and Han Solo of the Dark Continent is unstable at best. Hounsou does better as a soul on fire.
Edward Zwick, who directed from an explicatory script by Charles Leavitt (K-PAX ), has called himself a ''perpetual student''; his previous honors-class movies include Glory , Courage Under Fire , and The Last Samurai . There is every reason to learn about the link between jewels and death, by all means, but no reason to try to disguise a term paper as entertainment.

 The makers of “Blood Diamond,” an exceptionally foolish thriller starring a most excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger.  The story involves so-called conflict diamonds, illicitly mined stones that have been used to finance some of the most vicious wars in Africa. If films were judged solely by their good intentions, this one would be best in show. Instead, gilded in money and dripping with sanctimony, confused and mindlessly contradictory, the film is a textbook example of how easily commercialism can trump do-goodism, particularly in Hollywood.  Mr. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler  who, having been orphaned during his native country’s violent struggles in the 1970s, has spent most of his 30-some years crisscrossing the continent as a soldier of fortune and a merchant of misery. Tousled and tanned, with a long, slicing gait and a killer smile, Danny looks as if he were born for trouble of the sweetest kind. But Mr. DiCaprio, perhaps because he knows that much of the audience has already crawled into his pocket, plays the smuggler as the scum he is.  Even as the film coaxes Danny toward redemption, the actor fights to hold his ground and the truth of a character who has inspired the most fully sustained performance of his adult life.  This being an Edward Zwick film, it’s no surprise that redemption is on the menu. Mr. Zwick likes to make epic-size movies about men of anguish and conscience who, whether they wear Civil War blue (“Glory”) or a Meiji kimono (“The Last Samurai”), invariably land on the side of the angels. Danny is initially on the side of the devils, and when we first meet him in 1999 he is trying to cross the border of  a perilously unstable Sierra Leone with a stash of diamonds tucked into some goats.  Busted by a patrol from Sierra Leone, he lands in jail, where he soon hears of a precious pink diamond  unearthed by a fisherman turned unwilling miner, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou).  The chase is on, and on. Written by Charles Leavitt, “Blood Diamond” more or less plays like an exotically situated action flick as each man races toward his respective goal. Solomon hopes to reunite with his wife and three children, from whom he has been violently separated; Danny just wants a score big enough to pay his way permanently out of Africa. Theirs might be a match made in movie-genre heaven if the filmmakers didn’t insist  on wagging their fingers in our faces and delivering dire statistics by the ream, the intimations of Antwerp intrigue and an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), whose preferred interview method involves shimmying up to her subject like a pole dancer.  If the sociopolitical context weren’t so appalling,  this ludicrous characterization and Ms. Connelly’s equally woeful performance would be easy to laugh off. But both are insulting because they transpire against a backdrop of human suffering, suffering that Maddy sternly lectures Danny for exploiting even as she snaps another photograph of the very same. (Say what!?) Any question that the filmmakers might be clued into Maddy’s cluelessness, might be directly engaging the contradictions involved whenever misery becomes fodder for entertainment, is answered by the documentarylike images of children roaming a mound of garbage, by the blank-looking men and women sitting in trash-strewn streets and by the periodically brandished arm and leg stumps. The horror, the horror.  Like “The Constant Gardener,” this film betrays an almost quasi-touristic fascination with images of black Africans, who function principally as colorful scenery or, as in the gruesome scenes inside rebel training camps, manifestations of pure evil. Pure evil that, incidentally, likes to listen to rap and, in one case, wears a Snoop Dogg T-shirt along with his gat. Good as gold, Solomon earns a sizable share of screen time, and though the performance is expectedly sympathetic, the character has none of Danny’s complexity, which means that he’s inherently less interesting. Mr. Hounsou, who first came to attention as a noble African in “Amistad” and has often had to play the same role since, must be awfully tired of holding his head up so high.  “Blood Diamond” means well, but it also means box-office business. Hollywood has always traveled to faraway places (or at least tricked out sound stages) to spin yarns about moral calamity perfumed with the exotic. Whether down Mexico way or in Morocco, it generally kept the atmospheric extras — the snake-hipped dancing girl, the scoundrel in the burnoose, the smiler in the fez — stashed in the background, where they wouldn’t distract from the star attractions. “Blood Diamond” wants to bring those blurred figures closer into view, notably through Solomon. But the rushing camerawork, breakneck editing, compulsion to go, go, go onto the next genre beat mean that there is next to no time for such niceties. The faces remain obscured, the voices muted, even as Danny comes sharply into focus.  The tragedy of Sierra Leone and the complicity of Americans, who buy more diamonds than any other consumers in the world, deserve louder, more clamorous attention than the occasional news report.  And certainly big-budget Hollywood action films are plenty loud and plenty clamorous, and the volume is only    turned up to shrieking with the addition of the international heartthrob who, by sacrificing himself on the altar of love in “Titanic,” conquered a generation of young female fans (the same demographic most likely to brandish a rock on its ring finger).  Yet while Mr. DiCaprio turns out to be an ideal fit for “Blood Diamond,” there’s an insolvable disconnect between this serious story and the frivolous way it has been told. There is no reason to doubt the filmmakers’ sincerity; only their filmmaking.  “Blood Diamond” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes scenes of extreme violence, some of which involve child soldiers.
"T.I.A.," mutters Danny Archer  (Leonardo DiCaprio ), slouched across a bar in Sierra Leone . It is 1999. As the West obsesses over Clinton's blowjob, the West African nation is mired in a savage civil war. Our hero, a world-weary soldier of fortune, has struck up a conversation with Maddy Bowen  (Jennifer Connelly ), a foxy idealist reporting on the blood-diamond trade for an American newsweekly. As the ground operative of a vast conspiracy to exploit the country's unrest in the harvesting of precious stones, Danny holds the key to her storyholds it, most conveniently, in a little red notebook he keeps tucked against his cold black heart.
T.I.A., baby. Danny sizes up the lady journalist with his jaded blue eyes. They have witnessed too much on the dark continent to shed a tear. Apartheid, civil war, tribal conflict, human slaughter, global indifference, unquenchable hatred, unimaginable crueltyyes . . . this is Africa!
Well, yes and no. It doesn't quite roll off the tongue the same way, but a more appropriate acronym in this case would go something like T.I.A.P.U.O.M.A.A.C.Y.W.B.T.T.S.S.O.B.W.P.W.S.H.A.T.I.G.R.B.S.T.W.N.A./O.V.A.: This Is Africa Propped Up Once More As A Colorful Yet Wrenching Backdrop To The Stupid Story Of Boring White People Whose Sham Heroics Are Thrown Into Greater Relief By Surrounding Them With Noble And/Or Vicious Africans.
Directed by Edward Zwick  (The Last Samurai ) from a screenplay by the author of that legendary sociopolitical treatise K-PAX  (Charles Leavitt ), Blood Diamond assembles three refugees from central casting around the quest for an egg-sized pink diamond. When Revolutionary United Front  rebels rampage through his village, Solomon Vandy  (Djimon Hounsou ) is wrenched from his family and put to work mining diamonds. Pulling what looks like a giant, rusty crack pipe from the river, Solomon retrieves the rock and sets about hiding it when government soldiers bust in and cart everyone off to jail. Word of the diamond soon reaches Danny, himself imprisoned for the possession of criminally ridiculous blond highlights, and a scheme is hatched to get rich or die trying.
The holy trinity of African adventure-flick clichésthe amoral mercenary, the righteous native, the idealistic reporteris soon completed by the arrival of Maddy, and everyone heads off into the picturesque jungles, slums, and refugee camps of war-torn Sierra Leone. Endless stretches of witless torpor are interrupted by jarring assaults of violence; the bland Oscar bait of the season bristles to life only at the touch of mass murder. Workmanlike at best, Zwick's generic epic chops show newfound verve whenever there's a deadly set piece to mount: eight-year-old RUF agents mowing down women with AK-47s, innocents shredded to pieces in the crossfire, limbs severed, buildings detonated, cars aflame, shrapnel whizzing through flesh.
It's remarkable that a movie presumably opposed to Western exploitation of Africa exhibits a heartbeat only when slaughtering its anonymous, dark-skinned extras. To be sure, there's splendid momentum to the havoc here, a real thrill in the quickness of death leaping from the jungle, machine gun fire rattling through the ominous bass of gangsta rap. Such excitements would be less unsettling had their spark lit on any larger idea than "Whoa, shit is messed up in Africa." If Zwick and Leavitt intend to draw any parallel with American city lifethe crack pipe in the river, the dropping of the word bling it gets smothered in the tedium of an oppressively cornball script.
De Beers  can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond  won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling. "You might catch a minute of this on CNN ," says Maddy of the surrounding horrors, "between sports and weather." After she is confronted by the spectacle of a million refugees, her voice gathers gravitas and declares, "It's a like a whole nation has gone . . . homeless." Connelly is so ready for her "I Am African" poster.
