         Rian Johnson's debut feature, "Brick," won the Special Jury Prize for originality of vision at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005, but its description — a noir mystery set in a California high school — didn't grab me at all. The prize, it turns out, is as apt as the description is limited. Johnson has taken a well-worn, much-revised genre, adapted to what's become a clichéd setting and transcended both in the process. "Brick" is as difficult to categorize as its hard-boiled, made-up lingo is hard to understand — neither of which should deter anyone from seeing it. It's rare to see a debut as witty and assured as this.
 
 Joseph Gordon-Levitt, remarkable in "Mysterious Skin," plays Brendan, a brooding high school loner mourning the loss of his girlfriend. Emily (Emilie de Ravin) abandoned him to run with the popular kids — known as "the upper crust" — and soon found herself embroiled in a shady drug deal. She disappears, then mysteriously contacts Brendan asking for help. Before he can find her, Emily turns up dead.
 


         






   Here, the sleuthing kicks into gear, as Brendan recruits his friend the Brain (Matt O'Leary) to help him get to the bottom of a tangled web of subterfuge and shifting allegiances. At the top are two dark femmes fatales
, the football star-dating rich girl Laura (Nora Zehetner) and the poisonous drama queen — and Brendan's former girlfriend — Kara (Meagan Good). From there, it's a short trip to various other shady underworlds — the jocks, the stoners, and a mysterious local drug dealer and his posse of murderous thugs; as well as to a hilarious détente with assistant vice principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree), who's willing to cut deals in exchange for a culprit.
 
 "Heathers," naturally, comes to mind — but "Brick" forgoes over-the-top satire and deadpan acting for a sly knowingness and genuine, if seriously understated, emotion. The memory of Christian Slater's oily smarm is all but obliterated by Gordon-Levitt, one of the most appealing young actors to emerge in recent years. As he did in Gregg Araki's wonderful "Mysterious Skin," the actor radiates intelligence and sensitivity that's at once dreamy and firmly grounded in hard reality.
 
 Also notable are Lukas Haas as 26-year-old ("really old") the Pin (short for "kingpin"), a local drug lord with Godfatherly pretensions; Noah Fleiss as Tugger, the Pin's hotheaded muscle, and Noah Segan as the tragic stoner dude Dode.
 
 Set in the idyllic seaside community of San Clemente, "Brick" interacts with its milieu in witty, surprising ways. It grounds itself in the realities of teenage life — the Pin's mom, for example, is wont to cluelessly serve his roughed-up victims juice and cornflakes — and just as unexpectedly spins off into surrealistic tragedy reminiscent of early Gus Van Sant.

 A contemporary high school drama in which every other word isn't "dude" or "awesome": what kind of movie is that?  "Brick," a flashy cinematic stunt perpetrated by Rian Johnson, dispenses with the adolescent gibberish of the here and now to graft the hard-boiled argot of Dashiell Hammett onto an upscale Southern California high school: the milieu of "Beverly Hills 90210" and "The O.C."  goes noir.  In a twisty plot that proudly borrows elements from "The Maltese Falcon," "Red Harvest" and other Hammett yarns, Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a teenage Bogart-as-Sam Spade minus the trench coat and fedora, digs into a roiling adolescent underworld of murder and drug dealing. It's all so seamy, sordid, lurid and shocking! And dull, despite a noirish gloss of wide-angle cinematography and a jaundiced, smoggy color scheme.  If nothing else, the concept of a high school film noir is a shrewd attention-getting move for a first-time filmmaker like Mr. Johnson. "Brick" was duly awarded the Sundance Film Festival's Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision in 2005. Its raw ambition certainly puts it near the head of its class in contemporary teenage dramas. But what does that mean in a genre dominated by C students and worse? The word "class" is a misnomer, since there's not a classroom in sight in "Brick." The main action takes place outside in the high school parking lot.    "Brick" is even less dramatically convincing than Alan Parker's 1976 gangster spoof, "Bugsy Malone," which cast children as hoods and featured the 13-year-old Jodie Foster vamping it up like Rita Hayworth in "Gilda." ("Brick" has nothing half as spicy.) Even a guilty pleasure like "Cruel Intentions," which took "Dangerous Liaisons" to high school, landed some uncomfortable emotional punches because it was acted rather than pantomimed.  The underachieving cast of "Brick" merely goes through the motions. The women are especially pallid. Isn't a deep whiskey-and-cigarette-ravaged voice a prerequisite for playing a noir siren? Or has the Hilary-Britney-Mary-Kate-and-Ashley chirp stamped out precociously womanly voices like the 19-year-old Lauren Bacall's in "To Have and Have Not"?  Maybe "Brick" is a comedy. There is something cute, if not outright ludicrous, in the spectacle of dewy young actors striking the poses of hard-boiled demimondaines and desperadoes and failing utterly to make them come alive. The movie seems to have its tongue stuck in its cheek during a final showdown in a suburban basement, during which the impervious mother of a teenage drug lord is upstairs baking cookies. But funny it's not.  The story, briefly: Brendan, a lean, squinty-eyed loner, senses that there is something rotten in his high school when his insecure, social-climbing ex-girlfriend, Emily (Emilie de Ravin), vanishes after phoning him in a state of panic. Brendan, who still cares for Emily, becomes obsessed with finding her and enlists his über-nerd pal, the Brain (Matt O'Leary), as fellow gumshoe. Brendan has an ambiguous relationship with the high school's stern assistant vice principal (Richard Roundtree), the movie's surrogate police chief, with whom he verbally spars in some of the film's most embarrassingly wooden conversations.  He soon discovers Emily's dead body at the entrance to a tunnel. As he meticulously retraces her steps, we meet high-school versions of the usual noir suspects: a predatory drama queen (Meagan Good), a stoner who requires some roughing up (Noah Segan), a slinky femme fatale (Nora Zehetner), a beefy thug (Noah Fleiss) and, finally, the drug lord himself, the Pin (Lukas Haas). Mr. Haas, who twirls a falcon-crested cane and walks with an elegant limp, suggests a wiry, smirking Sydney Greenstreet.  Mr. Haas and Mr. Gordon-Levitt at least succeed in evoking the outlines of their characters. But the film's ham-handed reliance on period argot not only wears thin; it keeps the characters, such as they are, at a chilly distance.  "Brick" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and some violence.
Calling Rian Johnson 's teen indie Brick  a piece of stuntwork might seem tantamount to hitting it with a pie, but it's a high-speed wheelie of a strangely daring and say-it-couldn't-be-done variety. Try a thumbnail definition on for size: a high school noir, complete with Hammettian plot and a fearless fidelity to antiquated gangster patois.
Scary, isn't it? Brick  represents an impossible dream, though: the reusewith conviction of cinema's most calloused and beloved genre as applied to contemporary middle-class life. Johnson is drop-dead serious, and the strategy's unavoidable irony is buried so deeply it's nearly possible to forget it altogether. The hair may thin considerably under Brick 's hat after a while, and Hammett redone remains Hammett half done, but while the plates are in the air, it's a spectacle of nerve.
We're given little reason for hope at the outset, with a found corpse and a brooding loner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) contemplating grief and guilt. Flashing back, Gordon-Levitt's Brendan, bitterly nursing heartbreak like a good Bogart, is lured into his ex-girlfriend's drug-dealing-hophead troubles with a single mysterious phone call; thereafter, he reconnoiters, figuring out "who she's been eating with," how deeply she was involved with local drug kingpin The Pin (Lukas Haas ), and why she was killed. Every step of the process is a deft shadow of noir logicjust showing up at the right party, or beating the tar out of the right thug, sends unspoken messages to "the right people," and Brendan's relationship with the SoCal high school's law-and-order dean (Richard Roundtree ) wittily echoes the shamus-cop intercourse of scores of postwar thrillers.
Classes are never attended, the characters occupy the town's empty fringelands and alleys, and parents, as in Peanuts, are all but invisible. At times the jazzy, tougher-than-leather lingo feels like a pose, but most of the time Johnson keeps his actors' leash viciously tight, and no one riffsthey all fucking mean it, particularly Gordon-Levitt, who handles vast quantities of arch dialogue, much of it piercingly funny, with a Montgomery Clift like earnestness. ("I gave you Jared to see him eaten," Brendan tells the dean, "not to see you fed.") Blessedly, Johnson does not indulge in narration. But what's most beautiful about Brick  is the consistency with which the yesteryear dynamics are used to backlight and dramatize teenage angst. The Chandlerian society femme with a yen for the outsider hero is a rich bitch with absent parents; Mr. Big is an affected pusher who maintains an artificial air of menace only when he's not in his mother's kitchen, being served iced tea. Instead of cheap hotel rooms, we get cheap suburban bedrooms; if Brendan is no longer "in" but "out," it's with the school's power clique, not the mob. The cynicism of noir is deployed as a near-tears metaphor for pre-adult isolation, insecurity, and self-destruction, and it's such simple fusion between potent American cultural ideas it feels sui generis.
There are potholes: Johnson layers in drippy nonstop mood music, Gordon-Levitt's hero spends a third of the movie doubled over with an unexplained illness, and the Red Harvest y plot doesn't yield any surprises we haven't already seen get dealt from the deck bottom in 75 years of crime fiction. More than that, the movie's very concept keeps it limited and predictable, which is likely to be the tithe you have to pay for noir if it's not 1948 and you're not Nicholas Ray . But I didn't see Brick  comingand the question dangles about how young audiences not schooled in the real McCoy will fathom its fusty style. To modern kids only and literally wired to each other and the world through corporatized entertainment forms, maybe the hard-boiled existentialist vibe will seem like second nature.
