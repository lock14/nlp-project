In 1981, Thavisouk Phrasavath, his mother, and eight siblings  all survivors of the war in Laos  arrived in Brooklyn, where they'd been promised a home by U.S. officials. Ellen Kuras' documentary The Betrayal  jumps between the '80s, when the family struggled to make a go of it (Phrasavath, who helped shoot this footage, is credited as codirector), and the present, when Phrasavath learns that his father, a CIA recruit and victim of Laotian ''reeducation'' camps, is still alive and has a family in Florida. The past-and-present layering is a lot more resonant  and less sketchy  than the film's theme of ''betrayal,'' both familial and governmental. B–

 The subjects addressed in “The Betrayal (Nerakhoon),” a documentary by Ellen Kuras, could hardly be more enormous: war, revolution, the abandonment  of a nation and the scattering of its citizens. But the film, though it includes old news clips of the war in Laos and of American presidents discussing that country’s fate, is distinguished by an intimate mood and a lyrical tone. It is quiet, contemplative and impressionistic, which makes the story it has to tell all the more powerful.  That story belongs to Thavisouk Phrasavath, who is credited as Ms. Kuras’s co-director and who provides on-camera and voice-over narration. The son of a Laotian military officer who was part of the American-backed government, Mr. Phrasavath and his family fled their homeland not long after the Communist Pathet Lao insurgents came to power in 1975. After Mr. Phrasavath’s father disappeared into a re-education camp —  for a “seminar,” in the chilling local euphemism — Mr. Phrasavath, his mother and most of his sisters and brothers made their way to Thailand and then to the United States, where they were deposited in a tough, gang-ridden section of Brooklyn.  Ms. Kuras first met Mr. Phrasavath around that time, and one of the most remarkable aspects of “The Betrayal” is a narrative span rare in documentaries.  Film shot almost a quarter-century ago flows into more recent images. Some middle years are missing, giving the film a haunting sense of discontinuity and intensifying the surprise of its unexpected turns. Mr. Phrasavath and his mother seem to age before our eyes, as he grows from a sullen adolescent with big 1980s hair into a sober and contemplative middle-aged man and she is pared down by time into a tough, weary matriarch.  A complicated, sometimes tragic chronicle emerges in “The Betrayal,” but the film is driven less by chronology or plot than by the expressive counterpoint of words, music and images. Ms. Kuras, making her debut as a director, has had a long and distinguished career as a cinematographer (her credits range from Tom Kalin’s “Swoon” to Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind”), and while “The Betrayal” is in some respects a memoir, it is also a work of visual art. The collaboration of the co-directors seems to consist precisely of the synthesis between his memories and her eye.  The result is imperfect, but its roughness is entirely consistent with the way the filmmakers understand the traumatic experiences of displacement, loss and deprivation. The title, which at first seems straightforwardly to refer to the American government’s abandonment of its Laotian proxies, takes on deeper, sometimes contradictory meanings as “The Betrayal” (in Lao, “Nerakhoom”) unfolds. It refers to the actions of Mr. Phrasavath’s father, and also, more obliquely, to the loss of cohesion and identity suffered by exiled Laotians as their children drift into violence and materialism.  Mr. Phrasavath and Ms. Kuras address these complicated issues, and the feelings they evoke, with a patience and tact that sometimes feels a little too detached. But their purpose, finally, is not to traffic either in despair or easy uplift, but rather to write a film essay that takes account of pain, resilience and the sheer strangeness of recent history.

The wounds inflicted by the U.S. military's covert Vietnam-era operations in Laos still run deep, as evidenced by "The Betrayal" ("Nerakhoon"), which details one Lao family's harrowing efforts to start a new life in America. More than two decades in the making, this heartfelt debut docu feature by veteran cinematographer Ellen Kuras brings an affecting personal dimension to a sprawling sociopolitical narrative, intimately detailing how the agendas designed to advance the interests of nations can destroy individual lives. Results signal a long, well-traveled life on the fest circuit and on television, with limited theatrical play also a possibility.
It was in the mid-1980s, while seeking a Lao language tutor for a planned docu about another refugee family, that Kuras first encountered the charismatic Thavisouk Phrasavath (credited here as pic's co-director, co-writer and editor) and decided to turn her camera upon him instead.
Back in Laos, Phrasavath's father had worked for the CIA choosing targets inside the country for U.S. bombing runs. Following the fall of the CIA-backed Royal Lao Army to the Communist Pathet Lao in 1975, the Phrasavaths became personae non grata, with Thavi's father being shipped off to a re-education camp and his mother fleeing the country with eight of her 10 children in tow.
After a brief period in Thailand, the family applies for asylum in the U.S. and lands on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, where their vision of a gold-paved promised land quickly gives way to the harsh realities of poverty, street gangs and a cramped tenement apartment shared with a Cambodian family of six.
Pic then winds its way toward the present, with Kuras managing to have her camera running at just the right times to capture several stranger-than-fiction dramatic moments, including a series of unexpected revelations about the family's presumed-dead patriarch.
As a d.p., Kuras' work has included multi-pic stints with such visually venturesome directors as Martin Scorsese, Michael Gondry and Spike Lee, so it's hardly a surprise that "The Betrayal" offers a higher level of aesthetic involvement than most documentaries. In addition to the expected talking heads and news-reel footage, Kuras captures many lyrical images of everyday life both in Laos and in Brooklyn (where, in one particularly memorable moment, Thavi and his brothers go fishing for dinner in Prospect Park). Mix of multiple different film and video formats further enhances pic's varied visual textures.
Working from what must have been an enormity of raw footage, Kuras and Phrasavath have assembled "The Betrayal" in a free-associative fashion that, particularly in the opening half-hour, jumps back and forth in time between Laos and America and eschews on-screen supertitles and other conventional documentary storytelling aids.
Though an admirable attempt to allow the characters to tell their own story in their own voices, docu may be a bit too freely associative, as it becomes difficult at times to identify individual characters (some of whose names aren't even given until well after we've met them) and the precise order of events. Pic's second half, which proceeds in a more linear fashion, is resolutely gripping.

Some 23 years in the making, Ellen Kuras 's first film as a director is a portrait of Laotian refugee Thavisouk Phrasavath. The Betrayal (Nerakhoon)  is also a haunting flashback to the lush green and fiery orange phantasmagoria of wartime Indochina.
The son of a Laotian army officer, and a baby when the first U.S. advisors arrived in neighboring South Vietnam , Phrasavath grew up in the zone: "I thought killing and dying was only a normal thing." (He's first seen as a tough-looking kid with shoulder-length hair and a dragon tattoo.) Phrasavath escaped Laos  by himself at 12, swimming across the Mekong  to Thailand  and living for two years on the streets of Bangkok  until his mother and siblings joined him. Long one of the independent film movement's leading cinematographers, Kuras had yet to shoot anything when she discovered Phrasavath and his family living in a Brooklyn  housing project and embarked upon their epic collaboration. (Her subject is credited as co-director, co-writer, and editor.)
Although she documented Phrasavath's life for over two decades, Kuras seems particularly fascinated by things that could not be filmed directly. The Betrayal  eschews straightforward chronology, incorporating photographs of colonial Laos, TV footage of JFK, newsreels of the Ho Chi Minh  Trail, bombs falling, towns burning, and clips from a Pathet Lao propaganda movie, as well as incidents from Phrasavath's subsequent return to his birthplace. The mode is free-associative, but the movie's blunt accusatory title fits multiple periods of its subject's life. He was abandoned by his protectors ("The U.S. just left in the middle of the war"), by his liberators (Pathet Lao's victory was "a beautiful moment" with music everywhere, until his father was arrested), by the relief agency that brought his family to the U.S., and by his father who reappeared after 15 years, before, as Phrasavath puts it, "our heart was broken again."
The Betrayal  is refined, even delicate, filmmaking. Continuous destruction is accompanied by continual string music. Subtly off-speed and suffused with late-afternoon light, the movie weaves through time. Which is the dream, America or Laos? The landscape is typically onrushing—Kuras often shoots from cars or trains—and Buddhist ceremonies add to the free-floating displacement. Life seems a blur. Impressionistic and lyrical, as well as somber and gripping, The Betrayal  conveys a ceaseless flow. It's as if the filmmaker has opened a window onto a parallel world traveling beside our own.
