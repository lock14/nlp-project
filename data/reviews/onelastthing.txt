Two Eighties genre staples � Disease-of-the-Week and Poppin� the Cherry � meet, shake hands, and mostly play nice in this sweet, if overly earnest feature. The �one last thing� that 16-year-old Dylan (Angarano) wants to do before his body succumbs to terminal cancer is go fishing with a famous ballplayer. At least, that�s what he thinks he wants, and that�s what he tells the United Wish Givers Foundation, and that�s what he plans to say during their televised news conference. But once cameras roll (and with lips gently loosed by his medicinal pot), Dylan announces a different wish � to spend a weekend with a supermodel named Nikki Sinclair (an unmemorable Mabrey). Dylan�s quite-right rationale � �What�s the point in a wish if you don�t wish for what you really want?� � doesn�t win over the scandalized United Wish Givers Foundation, but pretty much everyone else on the planet seems taken with the "Wish Kid.� Friends and strangers alike want not just to accommodate him, but to shower him with wealth and wisdom (yes, I know the kid�s dying
, but still �). That sort of unreality hangs over the whole picture, from its halfassed attempts at high fashion (Nikki and her sunny good looks are more the stuff of catalog modeling) to the ease and swiftness with which Dylan and his friends launch a cable-access show (in order to raise funds for Dylan to go to New York to try to woo Nikki), a show that is seen at precisely the right moment in order for Dylan�s passed-over ballplayer to take notice, swoop in, and shower Dylan with wealth and wisdom. There�s a lack of sophistication to the storytelling (the script is by former TV writer Barry Stringfellow), and that lack creeps into the look of the film as well. Shot on HD, One Last Thing �
 is crisp but flat, textureless; and Steyermark�s (Prey for Rock & Roll)
 attempts to �art� up a couple of scenes with extreme close-ups and piecemeal framing distract to no discernible (positive) effect. Still, the thing works, more or less, despite itself. The cast mostly does good work, and as the sickly but wisecracking Dylan, Angarano (Jack�s son on Will & Grace
) is the film�s anchor, a winning presence that consistently rises above the taint of schmaltz or mystical hokum. You know he won�t live � the film is admirably up-front about this inevitability � but you can�t help but cheer him on toward getting laid.


Dylan Jameison can't see wasting his dying wish on a shopping spree or a red carpet event or even a fishing trip with his favorite professional athlete. Dylan wants what most honest, terminally ill, 16-year-old boys would ask for if they could: He wants to spend a weekend with (a.k.a. bed) a supermodel. And as silly as that seems, it's easily the most plausible part of ''One Last Thing. . ."
From director Alex Steyermark (''Prey for Rock & Roll") and first-time feature screenwriter Barry Stringfellow, ''One Last Thing. . ." isn't so much a movie as it is A Very Special Episode in search of a TV series. It stars a sunken-eyed Michael Angarano (Jack's son, Elliot, on NBC's ''Will & Grace") as teenage cancer victim Dylan, Cynthia Nixon as the boy's silently suffering mom, and blond bombshell Sunny Mabrey as a self-destructive model named Nikki Sinclair, who apparently hasn't been happy since she traded her small-time roots and boyfriend for big-city fame and fortune.
(By the way, Nikki drinks too much and watches her prom video a lot; that's how we know she's a fashion model in pain.)
When Dylan surprises a charity press conference by announcing that he'd like to spend a weekend with his favorite pinup, his Pennsylvania high school buddies and the rest of America cheer him on. It isn't long before Nikki's agent, played by Gina Gershon without her ''Prey for Rock & Roll" snarl, stages a photo op to net her client some positive PR. Even Dylan's dead father (Ethan Hawke) reappears in visions and videotape to encourage the lad to go after his self-involved dream lady.
The result is a road trip to New York City, where Stringfellow's screenplay -- already groaning under the clichéd weight of horny teen sidekicks (one of whom is actually named Slap) and medicinal marijuana abuse -- makes room for strippers, thugs, supernatural happenings, and a helpful taxi driver who looks suspiciously like Wyclef Jean.
Dylan and Nikki are an awkward match at best, and their combined story is about as creative/convincing as a Hallmark card, despite the fact that Angarano's character is aggressively written to thumb his nose at sentimental convention.
But the saving grace here is the touching bond between Dylan and his tolerant, devoted single mom. Thanks in large part to Nixon, who essentially plays a salon-deprived version of her ''Sex and the City" character, the bittersweet parent-child scenes in this movie connect, to the degree that you might just find yourself moved to tears even as you roll your eyes.
Angarano, too, is impressive. For good reason, his career looks poised to take off in ways that ''Sky High" could not have predicted. And while ''One Last Thing. . ." probably won't be his breakout film, it's a pretty good testament to his ability to rise above mediocre material.

         In "One Last Thing  ," a terminal teenager changes his "Make-A-Wish"-style dying fancy from fishing with his favorite football star to spending a weekend alone with the supermodel of his dreams on live TV — which seems like a good move, considering. Written by television writer Barry Stringfellow ("Perfect Strangers," "Sweet Valley High") and directed by Alex Steyermark ("Prey for Rock and Roll"), the movie straddles the heretofore undiscovered line between gonadal teen comedy and weepy cancer drama, throwing a couple of dead people into the back story for good measure.
 
 Sixteen-year-old Dylan Jamieson (Michael Angarano) lives with his widowed mother, Karen (Cynthia Nixon), in an industrial Pennsylvania town. In the last stages of brain cancer, he is granted a publicity stunt by a charity called "United Wish Givers" and elects to spend a weekend trawling for trout with NFL stud Jason O'Malley (Johnny Messner). Sharing his medical pot with his best friends, Ricky (Matt Bush) and Slap (Gideon Glick), before the press conference, Dylan is presented with the challenge of asking for the thing he really wants and rises to the occasion.
 


         






   Meanwhile, in New York, Nikki Sinclair (Sunny Mabrey) is teetering on the apex of the fashion world, porn star name notwithstanding, just one drink away from falling off. When the item makes the news, Nikki's manager, Arlene (Gina Gershon), seizes the damage-control opportunity and whisks her off to Pennsylvania for a photo op, leaving Dylan in the dust the minute the snap is shot.
 
 Luckily for Dylan, there's more to Nikki than meets the eye — namely, a crushing load of self-destructive guilt over a lost love. O'Malley turns out to be a hero after all. Over the objections of Dylan's bereft mother, the football player supplies the boys with a hotel room in New York, an envelope full of cash and his blessing, and off to the supermodel's house the kids go.
 
 An odd, hard-to-figure little movie, "One Last Thing " is too dark to be very funny, too mushy to be pitch black. Angarano is charming, and his ghoulish friends (Bush put me in mind of a young Vincent Schiavelli) weirdly spellbinding, but the script keeps the focus on the characters' pasts, trading the opportunity to explore a kid's standoff with death in favor of psychologically larded motivations and fantasies-come-true. Despite Dylan's last-minute exposure to the afterlives of the major religions (the doctor is Hindu, and our hero meets a Buddhist in New York), you get the feeling that "One Last Thing " is suggesting that the consolations of mortality are to be found in a few all-expenses-paid luxuries, and a snuggle with a Kate Moss wannabe.

 "One Last Thing ..." is shrewdly divided against itself. What begins as a small, cleareyed drama about a teenager with terminal cancer morphs into a gauzy tear-jerker. This flip-flop from realism to sentimentality conjures the image of a public official who spouts the unvarnished truth, quickly regrets it and spends the rest of his term in office backtracking and mending fences.  The movie reverses the usual relationship between storytelling and medicine: the coating of the pill may be bitter, but inside all is sugar. Whether it works as an antidepressant may depend on your attitude toward death and the afterlife; the movie is a firm believer in living happily ever after in the Hereafter.  In its favor "One Last Thing ...," directed by Alex Steyermark from a screenplay by Barry Stringfellow, has a likable cast. Michael Angarano plays the dying 16-year-old protagonist, Dylan, as a smart, spunky kid with unshed baby fat and raging hormones. If the character is too noble and fearless to be true, at least Mr. Angarano doesn't force Dylan into sentimental contortions. Even better is Cynthia Nixon, who adroitly underplays the role of his careworn, widowed mother, Karen.  Mother and son live in Marcus Hook, Pa., an industrial port outside Philadelphia. When a charitable organization called United Wish Givers arranges, amid much hoopla, to grant Dylan his final wish, he changes his mind at the last minute. Instead of going fishing with his football idol, Jason O'Malley (Johnny Messner), he announces that what he really wants is to spend a romantic weekend with his favorite blond supermodel, Nikki Sinclair (Sunny Mabrey).  A sour, spoiled brat whose career is in trouble, Nikki has to be dragged to Marcus Hook by her agent, Arlene (Gina Gershon), for a photo op with Dylan, during which she is barely civil. The chances of their meeting again seem slim. But the boy is determined to get his wish, and with some miraculous intercession, courtesy of the saintly footballer and rejected fishing buddy — who catches him on a cable-access show auctioning sports memorabilia — Dylan finds himself the recipient of $10,000.  Over his mother's protests, Dylan and his best friends Ricky (Matthew Bush) and Slap (Gideon Glick) travel to New York for a wild weekend at a fancy Midtown hotel (also compliments of Jason) during which Dylan plans to locate Nikki. Fortunately his picture lands on the front page of The New York Post; in the Big Apple he is Prince for a Day.  As "One Last Thing ..." seesaws between the surreal and the gritty, it suggests Martin Scorsese's "After Hours" revamped as an after-school special with an R rating. While scenes of the boys softening the hearts of hard-bitten New Yorkers wouldn't seem entirely out of place in a Shirley Temple movie, those of Ricky and Slap being hustled by lap dancers at a strip club mince no words. Meanwhile Dylan has recurrent hallucinations involving his dead father (an uncredited Ethan Hawke) and a mystical encounter with a Hindu guru.  The movie subjects Nikki to the same back-and-forth treatment. A booze-swilling, pill-popping cliché of self-destruction, she also has misty, watercolor memories of the true love she left behind in her hometown. She and Dylan eventually reconnect, on friendlier terms than before.  In addressing Dylan's illness, the movie is frustratingly nonspecific. He suffers nosebleeds and bouts of fatigue, and his doctor speaks of tumors, but the medical facts are never spelled out. Because we never learn the whys and wherefores of his father's death, the movie leaves hanging the implication that Dylan's disease might be inherited. That kind of cagey reticence I would call cheating.  "One Last Thing ..." is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity.  One Last Thing ...

Too self-consciously styled as an irreverent, lightly comic tale of a terminally cancerous teen boy and his outlandish final wish, "One Last Thing ... " lacks the spontaneously raw appeal of director Alex Steyermark's cool debut, "Prey for Rock and Roll," playing closer to an after-school special (with HBO-standard dialogue) than a satisfying feature film. Pic may find receptive niche auds in its Stateside release, planned for spring 2006, but will be best remembered as providing impressive young thesp Michael Angarano with one of his first substantial lead roles.
In small-town Pennsylvania, 16-year-old Dylan Jamieson (Angarano) appears to be taking his death sentence by cancer fairly well. He has solid emotional support in caring widowed mom Karen (Cynthia Nixon) and pals Ricky (Matt Bush) and Slap (Gideon Glick). Threesome share a joke that Dylan, when stating his wish for org United Wish Givers, should request a weekend with uber-hot supermodel Nikki Sinclair. Catching everyone off guard, this is precisely what Dylan asks for.
He seems destined to regret his dream, based on what we first see of the obnoxious Nikki (Sunny Mabrey), so corrosive and rude toward others and on such a self-destruct course that her agent Arlene (Gina Gershon, taking a supporting seat after her knockout lead perf in "Rock and Roll") is ready to give up on her altogether.
Unfortunately, the pic predictably and mechanically cuts back and forth between Dylan and Nikki, building no tension and repeating the same points ad nauseum, while leading to the inevitable conclusion that the boy will eventually bring out the best in the woman.
Most interesting aspect in the early section is the casual relationship between son and mom; he urges her to blurt out cuss words to relieve her stress. More sentimental are Dylan's many flashbacks to his dead father (Ethan Hawke, in an extended and uncredited cameo) fishing by the shore.
After Dylan's wish has been aired on TV, Nikki grudgingly meets the nervy teen at his home, but the scene is dull, and it takes all of the film's energy to rebuild a sense of storytelling purpose as Dylan decides to go to New York -- despite his weakening condition -- and meet Nikki again. Ricky and Slap, of course, act as sidekicks in what becomes a case of "Malcolm in the Middle" meets "On the Town."
Even though "One Last Thing ..." succumbs to trite sentimentality, Angarano gives the film its soul, with a performance that allows him space to project tenderness, uncannily mature wisdom and a commanding sensitivity to his character's growing confrontation with death. Outside of Nixon's nuanced turn and a finely shaded appearance by Brian Stokes Mitchell as Dylan's doctor, support tends toward types.
Digitally shot pic is plain is all aspects, reinforcing the sense it will look best on the small screen. Nelust Wyclef Jean (adding his birth name to his stage moniker) shows up in a slight role as a Gotham cabbie and with a nice closing credit tune.

Let's say you're a teenage boy dying of cancer. A well-known charity dedicated to helping people like you offers to make your fondest wish come true, so long as it's realistic. Since tumors don't stop gushing hormones, odds are a boy who'll never get to be a man is thinking about one particular rite of passage more than any other. One Last Thing . . . imagines such a boy; Dylan (Sky High  star Michael Angarano ) is determined to spend a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair  (Sunny Mabrey , star of Species III ). Most everyone around him assumes it's an impossible dreamand it might have been, if Nikki weren't such a self-destructive drunk that she badly needs a bit of good PR in order to stay gainfully employed. Director Alex Steyermark  gets great performances, but he and writer Barry Stringfellow  occasionally kill the mood with overdone spiritual bits. Still and all, Angarano and Mabrey bring something special to the proceedings, and they make it work.
