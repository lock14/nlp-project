At the end of the 12th century, in the middle of the Crusades, a fragile peace prevailed between the warring Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem. It is this unusual period of time that director Scott and first-time screenwriter William Monahan use to their advantage in Kingdom of Heaven
, a far-reaching period epic that is also relevant to our understanding of the conflicts in the Middle East of the present day. Scott is a masterful creator of otherworldly and noncontemporaneous locales, as films such as Gladiator
, Blade Runner
, and The Duellists
 will attest. His attention to detail is equally meticulous here, and Kingdom of Heaven
 additionally benefits from the exacting participation of cinematographer John Mathieson and production designer Arthur Max. By placing the story in this relatively peaceful time period between the Second and Third Crusades, the filmmakers have managed to fend off likely criticism by having no single religious group appear as the sole aggressor. If anything, the Christians seem the more battle-hungry participants, as they seek to oust the Muslims from Jerusalem, while the legendary Muslim leader Saladin (Syrian film star Massoud) shows marked military restraint. Despite the restive calm governing the region�s religious warriors, Kingdom of Heaven
 has a good number of battle scenes that are vividly punctuated with the sights and sounds of bloodied knights and soldiers and clanging swords and chain mail. Kingdom of Heaven
 is a historical spectacle on the order of Gladiator
 and a dissection of war as gritty and illuminating as Black Hawk Down
, to name two of Scott�s most recent films. Balian (Bloom), a French blacksmith, is the character at the center of this movie. He despairs knowledge of God�s love at the start of the film because of his wife�s suicide following the death of their infant son. His destiny changes when Godfrey of Ibelin (Neeson), a great knight who has returned home from the Holy Land on a recruiting mission, reveals himself to be Balian�s illegitimate father and invites the blacksmith to journey east with him and become a knight. Godfrey is loyal to the enlightened Christian king of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV (Norton), a leper who has not much time to live. However, Baldwin has instilled among his loyalists the idea of Jerusalem as a religious melting pot, home to Christians, Muslims, and Jews � a real kingdom of heaven. It is in this regard that Scott�s movie really takes flight: It becomes a canvas for ideas and ideologies in action. Balian goes with Godfrey because of his belief that in Jerusalem all sins can be erased; recruiters tout the idea that killing infidels is not murder but rather the path to heaven; Godfrey assures Balian that God is manifest in actions, not faith. Kingdom of Heaven
 occasionally groans under the weight of modern ideas, like Baldwin�s "kingdom of conscience," an expression more indicative of 21st-century thought than 11th. Yet the story�s parallels with the present are sometimes inescapable, as when Saladin�s fireballs catapulted at Balian�s castle strike an eerie resemblance to the "shock and awe" of the U.S.-led coalition�s initial assault on Iraq. The actors, too, lend a sense of decorous believability to the characters, although Bloom�s Balian often exudes a more matinee-idol polish than true gravitas. Nevertheless, the top-lined Bloom may add to the box-office draw, and with the arrival of the hotly anticipated thriller Domino
 later this summer from Ridley Scott�s brother Tony, the Scott brothers may prove themselves to be the real boys of summer 2005.


First things first. ''Kingdom of Heaven," director Ridley Scott's return to the sword-and-sandals genre he revived with ''Gladiator," is nowhere near as entertaining as that 2000 film. It's also nowhere near as awful as the inert bores that followed ''Gladiator" into theaters -- the wooden ''Troy" and the demented ''Alexander." It is, instead, a mostly lumbering, occasionally rousing epic that walks a bizarre line between historical fact and Hollywood wishful thinking.
More than anything, this often fascinatingly confused Crusades epic lacks a leading man with the stature to put it over. Audiences know Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is their friend. Orlando Bloom is no Russell Crowe.
To be fair, Bloom is not actively
 bad as Balian of Ibelin, a French blacksmith who becomes the defender of 12th-century Jerusalem against religious fanatics of all stripes. The face that launched a million adolescent sighs as Legolas in ''The Lord of the Rings" is handsome and sincere; he reads his lines well and tosses a sword like a man trained in the finest fencing academies of Brentwood. He is not unlikable. But he seems like a man holding the fort for a genuine star who never arrives.
Well, Liam Neeson does turn up early on as Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader returning from the Holy Land seeking his bastard son. We know Godfrey is manly because he talks about fighting for two days with an arrow through his testicle the way you or I might talk about a hangnail. Coming upon Balian shortly after the younger man has lost his beloved wife to suicide -- Bloom expresses grief by staring into the middle distance and working up a brow furrow -- Godfrey tells his heir to follow him to Jerusalem. The directions aren't quite ''take a right at Italy," but they're close.
By the time Balian makes it across the Mediterranean, he has been knighted, de-fathered, and shipwrecked; if screenwriter William Monahan had locusts up his sleeve, he'd throw them in, too. Luckily, by the time Balian journeys across the desert to the Holy Land, he has shown his bravery and compassion to the infidel in ways that will pay off nicely down the line.
Here is where ''Kingdom of Heaven" gets extra wiggy, and not just because Scott's Jerusalem inexplicably has snow-capped mountains looming in the far distance. Some history: After the First Crusade, Christians held the city for 88 years. The movie's main narrative concerns the successful campaign of the Muslim leader Salah al-Din, a.k.a. Saladin (Syrian actor-director Ghassan Massoud), to bring it back under Arab control. There followed six more crusades over the centuries and, ''Kingdom" correctly implies, a struggle to control this living religious symbol that continues to this day.
However, the movie offers the extremely curious notion that, under the European conquerors of the First Crusade, Jerusalem was a shining, democratic city on a hill -- a kingdom of fair play and amicable relations between the differing faiths. It was a place where religious fanaticism has been conquered by social tolerance and where, Godfrey promises his son, ''You are not what you are born but what you have it in yourself to be."
That's right: Jerusalem is America. Or, rather, the ideological America of blue states and pious Hollywood producers. The openhearted Balian fits right in, befriending the leprous King Baldwin of Jerusalem (Edward Norton under a dime-store tin mask) and his adviser Tiberias (Jeremy Irons, playing a heroic variation on Scar from ''The Lion King"). All three want to preserve the delicate peace, as do the approaching Saladin and other Arab nobles before their hands are forced.
Against them are the foaming fundamentalists of either side, including Knights Templar Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald de Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson), the former sneering, the latter doing a mincing little dance in one scene as if he didn't know the cameras were rolling. The priests are even worse, urging the infidel slain without mercy, then suggesting a quick conversion to Islam when the chips are down. The Saracens have their fanatics as well, but at least they're well groomed, since the filmmakers are desperate to avoid even a hint of Arab-bashing.
Granted, this results in a refreshingly evenhanded portrayal of Muslims for a mass-market movie: As charismatically played by Massoud, Saladin is a past master of Middle Eastern detente. Something tells me evangelical Christians won't be quite as pleased.
(Where are the Jews, by the way? In point of fact, they were exiled from their own city by the Crusaders until Saladin permitted them to return later. For all the movie cares, they're in Boca.)
In the middle of all this is the king's sister and Guy's wife, Sibylla (Eva Green, the hotsy-totsy from Bertolucci's ''The Dreamers"), who takes one look at Balian and tosses her wimple to the breeze. ''Kingdom of Heaven" gives the two a pro forma love-making scene, but its heart is in the rhetoric of doomed 12th-century civil libertarianism and in the splendors of digital war-making.
Thus the back half of the movie is one titanic battle after another, the details of which had the historically minded critic in the row next to me cringing in agony. It is to laugh. Worse, to my mind, are the unreal-looking CGI backdrops. Whether it's Mordor or Troy or Jerusalem, Hollywood movies now always give us the same damn war: ahistorically bombastic, drunk on slo-mo flaming arrows, shrouded in computerized storm clouds. But you pay $8.50, you expect mass destruction, and when it's not preaching tolerance, ''Kingdom of Heaven" delivers.
In the end, though, the movie's well-intentioned message of peace and good will seems absurdly naive the moment you leave the theater and pick up a newspaper. The Crusades continue today, of course, as unyielding and bloody-minded on both sides as ever, but to really address that, the filmmakers would have to speak more than the language of movie cliches, historical fibs, and Civics 101 platitudes.
''If this is the kingdom of heaven, let God do with it what he wills," says Balian toward the end. Unfortunately, God will have to wait until Ridley Scott is finished.


         Jerusalem has the power to drive men mad.
 
  It's the paradox of this city sacred to three great religions that there are those who would kill to defend its holiness. That's as true today as it was nearly a thousand years ago, when Pope Urban II's cry of "God wills it!" sent Europe's knights to the Middle East in a series of bloody expeditions against Islam that we know as the Crusades.
 


         






    Director Ridley Scott, long fascinated by knights, those heroic Boy Scouts of yore, has made a film about not the entire two-century span of those invasions but rather a brief and pointed moment between the Second and Third Crusades when the fate of Jerusalem and the region hung in the balance.
 
  Scott, the epic director of our time ("Gladiator," "Blade Runner," "Black Hawk Down"), is not what you would call a political animal, but in "Kingdom of Heaven" he delivers that rare big-star blockbuster (Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons top the cast) that still manages to have something relevant to say.
 
  Working from a strong script by William Monahan and making full use of that solid cast and his own impeccable skill with imagery, Scott has fashioned an impressive film that resonates with lessons for an age when Crusaders, this time in American uniforms, are trying to save the Middle East from itself yet one more time.
 
  Scott did not necessarily set out to do that. He wanted an action-adventure film that would provide satisfactions commensurate with (and able to repay) its estimated $140-million budget. He's provided huge battles, spectacular vistas and slash-and-burn action, but given the times the film was made in, it is fortunate, and perhaps fated, that it turned into something more.
 
 
 "Kingdom of Heaven" is not one of those cheerful combat movies that believe bloodletting is the answer to everything. It is a violent movie that laments a peace that didn't last, a downbeat but compelling epic that looks to have lost faith in the value of cinematic savagery for its own sake. If you combine this film with Scott's recent "Black Hawk Down," you find the director in a place where he is no longer exulting in his ability simply to put violence on screen; he wants you to feel its searing effects as well.
 
  What Scott and screenwriter Monahan do believe in is the code of chivalry, the notion that, as one character puts it, "holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves." The knight who initially exemplifies these traits is Godfrey of Ibelin (a powerful Neeson), a nobleman introduced returning to France in 1184 accompanied by a member of the military order of Hospitaler (David Thewlis). Back in the East, Jerusalem has been under Crusader rule for nearly a century, but Godfrey has returned on a personal mission: He wants to find a son he's never acknowledged.
 
  That would be humble blacksmith Balian (Bloom), who gets the news about his parentage just as he's suffered a terrible personal tragedy. Godfrey asks his son to join him in Jerusalem, "a new land at the end of the world" where "you are not who you are born but who you can make yourself to be."
 
  There wouldn't be much of a movie if Balian didn't decide to take the trip, but he is initially more of a brooder — albeit a very masculine one — than a man of action. He worries about his faith and the state of his soul, worries that he is "outside God's grace." Truly, no one ever needed a new world more.
 
  Once in Jerusalem, Balian follows his father's advice and aligns himself with the forces of light. That would be King Baldwin IV (an especially effective Edward Norton), an intrepid ruler so eaten away by leprosy he wears a silver mask over his face at all times, and Tiberias (Irons), the man who runs the city for him.
 
  Representing the dark side are the ambitious Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and the wily Reynald de Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson, always irresistible). Bridging the gap between good and evil is Sibylla (Eva Green of Bertolucci's "The Dreamers"), sister of the king, wife of Guy and a woman who just happens to have a weakness for brooding types newly arrived from France.
 
  What makes the bad guys the bad guys, interestingly enough, is that they are aligned with religious zealots who are sworn enemies of a fragile truce that has existed for a precious few years under the sponsorship of Baldwin. His opposite number, the great general Saladin, is a hero who faces equal pressures from fanatics on his side of the issue to go to war for the greater glory of God.
 
  Saladin is intensely played by the charismatic Ghassan Massoud, a major film star in his native Syria. "Kingdom's" willingness to cast its net that far to ensure a strong performance is a sign of how scrupulously careful the film has been to be fair to both sides, not just for political reasons but to ensure good drama. It's a quest that has succeeded on all counts.
 
  William Monahan's script for "Kingdom of Heaven" is not always convincing, but (except for liberties taken with Balian) it does a better-than-expected job of staying as close as it could to the reality of its characters' lives while tailoring them to the needs of a major motion picture. Howler lines like "I once fought two days with an arrow through my testicles" are kept to a minimum, and the dialogue is largely intelligent and to the point.
 
  The star of "Kingdom of Heaven" is not the script or any of the actors, it is the director's unmatched gift for the visual. Shooting in Morocco and Spain, he created a physical replica of the walls of Jerusalem by using 6,000 tons of plaster, then he masterfully tweaked the result with digital technology.
 
  Working with editor Dody Dorn (who cut Christopher Nolan's very different "Memento") and composer Harry Gregson-Williams, he knows just how to pace battle scenes, how to intercut aerial master shots with intimate details, and he refuses to linger on the effects of violence more than he has to.
 
  Collaborating for not the first time with his key production crew — cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max and costume designer Janty Yates — Scott has accomplished the difficult feat of making his film look as real as it is exotic.
 
  Scott and company have gotten so accomplished at re-creating history that the results have a welcome offhanded quality, making them spectacular without seeming to be showing off. No matter what we're looking at, we're thinking, "It must have looked like that." For a film like "Kingdom of Heaven," a better compliment would be hard to find.

In Kingdom of Heaven , Ridley Scott's handsome but curiously remote Crusades epic, the bloody holy war between Christians and Muslims surges forth with the boiling logistical fury we've come to expect from films that feature a cast of digital thousands. Men in chain-mail armor, their white shields marked by a blood-red cross, raise their broadswords and hack away in righteous wrath. A shower of arrows fills the sky like horizontal rain, and catapults hurl flaming rocks over the walls of Jerusalem, as men, one by one, attempt to scale those walls, only to be drenched by buckets of gloppy thick oil. Giant wooden towers fall, the same spectacular way they did in The Lord of the Rings , and you can just about see every soldier inside. It's all very teeming and hordelike and impressive.
When you hire Ridley Scott to direct an oversize medieval war movie, there's one thing you needn't worry about: The money will be there on screen. Yet as I watched Kingdom of Heaven , a thought  a question  opened up in front of me like a dramatic-existential abyss: Who, or what, exactly was I rooting for? In 1184, Balian (Orlando Bloom), a young French blacksmith with a noble wisp of beard, is drawn into the orbit of his father (Liam Neeson), a righteous Crusader who leads him to Jerusalem, the city of hallowed ground and sacred stones that the Christians took from the Muslims a hundred years before. The movie views both sides as equal in their idealism, with one or two bad apples on each team spoiling things for everybody.
The Muslims, led by the fierce and honorable desert warrior Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), have ample motive for their aggression: A band of Christian soldiers struck them first. (Okay, they want Jerusalem back as well.) So God be with the Muslims! You must understand, however, that the Christians didn't really mean it  at least, not the devout mass led by Balian, the valiant knight whose dream is to preserve the city as a ''kingdom of Heaven,'' a multiculti paradise where Christians, Muslims, and Jews can all live and worship together. The temples and the shrines mean nothing to him, at least compared to the innocent civilians inside. So God be with the Christians, too!
Watching Kingdom of Heaven , I could feel my liberal empathy overflowing, to the point that I realized I was rooting for everyone on screen to rise up and defeat everyone else. That's not a feeling I would equate with excitement, but then, it's not every war movie that can turn the most gruesome sustained rampage in the history of mankind into a misunderstanding between rival peaceniks. Kingdom of Heaven  is obviously meant to be an allegory of our current global religious clashes, but Scott, working from a script by William Monahan, is so busy balancing our sympathies, making sure no one gets offended, that he has made a pageant of war that would have gotten a thumbs-up from Eleanor Roosevelt.
At the center of Gladiator , Scott's previous ancient action spectacle, was Russell Crowe, the thinking man's bruiser, slashing all comers in the Colosseum, dominating the world with his molten contempt. It would be an understatement, though, to say that Orlando Bloom doesn't look like he has combat (or much of anything else) on his mind. Bloom has fine soft features, a liltingly ''literate'' accent, and the passive, neutral demeanor of a page boy impersonating a warrior. Just about everybody who lays eyes on him recognizes Balian as his father's son, yet how can they tell? Liam Neeson is full of dark fire, but Bloom is like invisible ink on screen. The closest thing to religious fervor that he has ever inspired is the passion of magazine editors in search of a hunkalicious new movie-star-of-the-month.
Shot for shot, Kingdom of Heaven  is infused with Scott's lyric technological grandeur, yet it lacks the entertaining vigor of political gamesmanship. When Balian arrives in Jerusalem, it's like the Land of Actors With Speaking Parts, except that none of them are developed. Jeremy Irons as the noble Tiberias, Marton Csokas as the treacherous baron Guy de Lusignan, Eva Green as his sexy, suffering wife, who strays to be with Balian  what should have been a tasty soap opera of power never quite comes to life. Scott does achieve something indelible in his portrait of the Christian king Baldwin IV, a tender-souled leper who never removes his mask. His mournful, faintly disembodied voice  an uncredited Edward Norton  is spookier than anything in the recent Phantom of the Opera . He's the soul of the movie, all right: a gentleman trying to halt a turf war. What's missing from Kingdom of Heaven  is the unholy madness of the Crusades  the violence of men who, in their zealous desire to smite sin, were only too willing to turn themselves into apostles of blood.

ear the end of "Kingdom of Heaven," a plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades, the camera pulls back from the tumult of battle. Perched on high, as if assuming the view of a passing bird or some divine being, the camera looks down on a medieval scene that condenses the barbarism that has consumed the previous two hours of screen time - the impaled flesh, the crushed bone, the hollow and inflamed invocations of faith. From this great height, the Christian crusaders and Muslim warriors below no longer look like men, like warring armies of God, but bacteria under a microscope. Outside of a couple of sneering papal emissaries, this high-flown image of men at war comes about as close to real commentary on the Crusades as Mr. Scott gets in his curiously disengaged film about the Christian incursion into the Holy Land. Written by a newcomer, William Monahan, "Kingdom of Heaven" is an ostensibly fair-minded, even-handed account of one of the least fair-minded, even-handed chapters in human history, during which European Christians descended on the Middle East for more than 200 years.  Given the presumed lofty price tag of the film, its global reach and the current state of world affairs, with warriors of different faiths and ideologies battling one another in the name of God and terrorism, this vision of the Crusades is not that surprising. Paint a majority  religion with too damning   a brush and you just may lose out on a nice chunk of the international movie market. The historian Robert  Wolff has called the Crusades a "long chronicle of greed, stupidity, treachery, duplicity and incompetence." Mr. Scott begins his chronicle in France, sometime before the Third Crusade, circa the late 12th century, with a grieving blacksmith, Balian, played by the young English actor Orlando Bloom, reuniting with a father he never knew, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). En route to Jerusalem, where he has long done his part for the holy war, Godfrey pauses to give his son both legitimacy and a title. Initially reluctant, Balian acquiesces partly because his wife's recent death has left him unmoored, partly because the law is hot on his heels, a story element that gives Mr. Scott license to very quickly - to borrow a memorable phrase from the director's last epic endeavor, "Gladiator" - "unleash hell." Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of movie violence and he does not disappoint on that count here. "Kingdom of Heaven" is filled with scene after scene of choreographed mayhem. Soon after Balian and Godfrey join forces, accompanied by crusaders whose numbers include a sword-swinging, rough-riding monk (a characteristically fine David Thewlis), they are beset by soldiers intent on bringing the blacksmith to justice. (Earlier, Balian both crosses the law and proves his crusader mettle by tossing a man in an open fire.) Amid a storm of very fast cuts and whiplash camera moves, sprays of blood and flying dirt, men meet one another without mercy. One crusader tugs at an arrow buried deep in his torso while another kneels, stunned in the dirt, gurgling blood with an arrow speared straight through his neck. After starting with a bang, Mr. Scott tries to keep us in his storytelling grip with many more visceral, frenetically violent scenes. Soon after they meet, Balian and Godfrey part ways and the son ends up sailing for the Middle East without his father. What follows is a shipwreck and a desert fight to the death (there are neither safe landings nor safe harbors in this part of the world), followed by a lull during which Balian grapples with a crisis in faith. The death of his wife has made Balian question his belief in God, a crisis that serves the character but robs the story of both narrative thrust and purpose, since it means that "Kingdom of Heaven" is effectively a Crusades movie without a convincing crusader. Both believers and nonbelievers joined the Crusades, driven into the Middle East from Europe by a variety of spiritual and political rationales. (One historian has called crusading "an act of love.") Whether the Crusades were offensive or defensive campaigns remains a matter of predictable dispute, though a dispute that seems - at least from this angle - beside the point given the ghastly death toll. Whatever the case, Mr. Scott carefully stacks his films with the righteous and the tolerant, keeping the real villains far and few between. In this context, Balian initially comes across as a kind of ecumenical Hamlet, pondering not death but belief, and then, when forced to protect Jerusalem against Muslim troops, a proto Henry V who rallies the faithful with yet another iteration of the St. Crispin Day's speech. Mr. Bloom delivers this unpersuasive speech amid a climactic battle during which the Muslim leader, Saladin, tries to wrest Jerusalem from Christian control. As played by the Syrian film actor Ghassan Massoud, Saladin looks as cool as a long drink of water. (That may explain online rumors that some Christians are up in metaphoric arms about the film, though this Crusade couldn't be better timed if it had been dreamed up by studio publicists.) With his creased cheeks and wind-snapped black robes, Mr. Massoud quietly commands his scenes with a hushed intensity that serves as a relief to Mr. Bloom's droopy sensitivity and much of the rest of the cast's gnashing and bellowing. Only an entertaining Jeremy Irons, in the role of the Jerusalem king's closest adviser, has a role juicy enough to withstand such furious scenery chewing. How it all comes down will be familiar to students of religion and cinematic spectacles alike. Mr. Scott and Mr. Monahan play fast and loose with facts and figures, but here the chief difference between history and Hollywood is that there are few bad guys outside of Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), a baron whose dastardliness is immediately signaled by his French accent. "Give me a war," he growls to his henchman, played by Brendan Gleeson like some holy evil fool, complete with rolling eyeballs and a very strange dye job. Mr. Gleeson and the unfortunately cast Eva Green, as Balian's hot-to-trot illicit love interest, a desperate housewife who appears to live in some kind of fabulous day spa, bring "Kingdom of Heaven" perilously close to camp, which is depressing for a filmmaker of Mr. Scott's gifts. Equally at home in the future and the past, Mr. Scott seems born to direct epics. His ravishing visual style, characterized by a fetishistic attention to surface detail and unrelenting beauty, can work wonders with big subjects, but this is also a director who needs actors powerful enough to shoulder narrative and emotional extremes. One of the reasons that "Gladiator" worked as well as it did is that its star, Russell Crowe, could credibly put across one of Mr. Scott's typically anguished and existentially lonely heroes while wearing a skirt and gargling some very unfortunate lines. It takes an actor as self-serious as Mr. Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. "Kingdom of Heaven" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains a great deal of bloody violence with lots of impaled flesh and a few decapitations, among other outrages. It also features some discreet lovemaking.

"Kingdom of Heaven" navigates through the minefield of the Crusades and, by extension, the contentious background of Christian-Muslim relations in ways both shrewd and calculated. Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott's latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism, as well as in creating a convincing view of a late 12th century when East and West co-existed, then came to blows for neither the first nor last time. Dramatically, however, there is a vaguely programmatic feel to the drastic upward mobility of a simple French blacksmith to the ruling echelon of the Latin Kingdom. Domestic B.O. prospects look robust if not gladiatorial, while the international campaign will, in line with the new wave of ancient spectacles, net significantly more spoils.
The notion of basing a $140 million Hollywood production on the most calamitous episode in the joint history of the world's most dominant religions -- and at a time like this, no less -- would run the gamut from unlikely to sheerest folly in the minds of cautious industry execs.
But Scott and screenwriter William Monahan have craftily solved most of the thorny problems by beginning their tale toward the end of the nearly century-long truce that followed the Crusaders' bloody conquest of Jerusalem in 1099; correctly pinning the lion's share of the blame for reigniting hostilities on a couple of rash Christian belligerents; making the Muslims look good in comparison by more thoroughly detailing Frankish deviltry and, perhaps most importantly, bestowing the most sympathetic characters with an anachronistic post-French Enlightenment humanistic attitude that, while not denying God, at least suggests a desire on their part to take an extended vacation from doing His fighting.
In this respect, pic may irritate traditionalist Christians more than it will Muslims, who can delight not only in the ending, but in the hugely noble, if one-dimensional, portrait of the legendary warrior Saladin, strikingly impersonated by Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud.
But once all the intricate historical needle-threading is said and done, it's the story that counts. First-time scribe Monahan has done quite an adroit job merging fact with fiction, shifting and adjusting certain elements to streamline and augment the drama but never betraying the subject matter in a way that remotely recalls the Hollywood approach epitomized by Cecil B. DeMille's laughably inauthentic 1935 epic "The Crusades."
There really was a Balian who led the doomed defense of Jerusalem in 1187, but he was not the ordinary bloke vaulted to lofty rank played here by Orlando Bloom. Brooding over his wife's suicide after the death of their son, this Balian is shaken from sullenness by the arrival in rural France of imposing knight Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), who informs the youth he's his father and beckons him eastward.
On the way, Godfrey gives Balian fighting lessons before an ambush truncates the blooming father-son bond. But in his limited appearance, Neeson excels, his voice carrying the authority of experience and the lines around his eyes suggesting that nothing in life is any longer foreign to him.
On his own, Balian makes his way to bustling Jerusalem, where he quickly assumes control of his esteemed father's estate and sizes up the fractious factions that control the world's most bitterly contested religious site.
Ruled by a wise Christian king, frail leper Baldwin IV (beautifully voiced by Edward Norton from behind a sculpted silver mask), the domain is further dominated by Baldwin's comely sister, Princess Sibylla (Eva Green); her snaky husband Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), and the latter's warmongering cohort, Reynald of Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson).
Balian finds more natural allies in Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), a peace-minded and pragmatic military expert, and the Hospitaler (David Thewlis), a court counselor who has also seen enough fighting for one lifetime.
With all these colorful and intriguing characters circling around, the one in the center, Balian, looks bland by comparison. He seems uncomfortably like a reactor instead of an instigator, a consciously concocted Everyman designed for audience identification who has greatness thrust upon him.
Given that Balian is a cipher needing to be filled, a bigger personality than Bloom's would have helped. Upon arrival in Jerusalem, Balian heads straight for Calvary and spends the night meditating at the site of Christ's crucifixion, hoping but failing to feel God's grace. One never senses any urgency or anguish to Balian's spiritual dilemma in Bloom's performance, nor even the more easily expressed ambivalence in his relationship with the enticing Sibylla, who gives herself to him like a present, and later schemes to install him in Guy's place.
Narrative contains significant gaps, notably in the romance, Balian's adoption of his new home and especially in his rapid assimilation of military savvy. (Indeed, Scott is on record as saying his definitive cut of the film runs 220 minutes, a version he claims will be released on DVD.) Suddenly, after Reynald has outrageously provoked Saladin by attacking a Saracen caravan for no reason, it is Balian who warns in vain against Reynald and Guy's ludicrous decision to take on Saladin's army at the broiling Horns of Hattin, a miscalculation that made Jerusalem's fall inevitable.
Scott strikingly shows not the massacre that was Hattin (ironically the same location where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount), but only its grisly aftermath, so as to save the big action for Saladin's siege on Jerusalem. Although much may be made of would-be contemporary parallels, the filmmakers have actually gone out of their way to avoid them. The only scene that yanks the viewer into a modern mindset is Saladin's opening salvo, in which his fireballs lofted into the night sky above the walled city eerily evoke the initial U.S. nocturnal airborne attack on Baghdad.
The sights and sounds of the battle are staggering, with the enormous Saracen force bearing down on the Christian-held enclave with the help of enormous siege towers and trebuchets (giant catapults), and the vastly outnumbered Europeans holding their own with ingenious defenses that prominently include large amounts of boiling oil.
Despite the huge scale and vivid carnage, the sequence is a bit deflated by Balian's quasi-Shakespearean speech that's meant to be inspiring, but isn't. Resolution is essentially true to history.
Among the cast, vets Neeson, Irons and Thewlis come off best, along with Massoud. Green makes for a fetching princess, although the role could have been a much more complex one, torn as she is among her sovereign brother, usurper husband and appealing new lover; as it is, Green plays up her coquettish side and is allowed to smile too much.
Scott is content with one-dimensional villains, and Gleeson and Csokas indulge him with bluster, glares and dismissive put-downs that are both delicious and far too easy.
With John Mathieson behind the camera, pic looks much like "Gladiator," bathed in blues and densified whenever possible with atmospheric particles such as snowflakes, smoke, dust and shafts of light. Arthur Max's production design outdoes his efforts on the previous film, conjuring a world, particularly the amazing confluence of influences that was Jerusalem 800 years ago, never before seen nearly so elaborately or credibly onscreen. Janty Yates' diverse costume designs also contribute importantly.
With CGI work improving all the time, the mix of live and computerized elements creates numerous extraordinary canvases of virtually seamless quality. Harry Gregson-Williams' score emphasizes the uniformly solemn tone of the proceedings while mixing in such diverse sounds as traditional and liturgical songs, Arabic and world music and, most surprisingly, bits from "The Crow," "Blade II" and a piece by Jerry Goldsmith called "Valhalla."

What more spectacular and reverent way to celebrate the selection of the world's richest and most sanctimonious corporation's new puppethead than release a Hollywood  softball epic about the Crusades? Deus lo volt , as the knights used to cry. Untold millions of slaughtered infidels later, President Bush  announces his "crusade" against Muslim terrorists, the Islamic and secular worlds go apeshit over the reference, and Ridley Scott  says, Eureka! The time is right! Kingdom of Heaven  is well aware of the sociopolitical slag pit into which it plops, and the movie does what any self-respecting politician would do: sidestep the issues, soft-pedal mortal costs, talk a fat game, and divert your attention away from history with exercises in spectacle and power.
As the Second Crusade's brooding Luke Skywalker , the blacksmith Balian (Orlando Bloom ) is soon distracted from the funk over his dead wife and child by a Crusading Baron (Liam Neeson ) passing through, who informs our expressionless hero that he had raped Balian's mother and is the lad's father, and why not come with him to Jerusalem declared more than once as some kind of "new world!" After skewering a scummy priest, Balian accepts and even submits to an Obi-Wan swordsmanship lesson in the blue forests of Gladiator, before entering the digitized walls of the Holy City proper. From there, we're dawdling around in a calamitous three-year period beginning in 1184, when the city was ruled by Baldwin IV the Leper King (Edward Norton , behind a mask), who maintained an uneasy truce with Muslim leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud ). "Peace," we're told, "reigns between Muslim and Christian!" This utopian fantasy doesn't last long, thanks to the less-devout-than-power-mad Reynald (Brendan Gleeson ) and Guy de Lusignan  (Marton Csokas ), the designated evil Templars. (The presence of an obnoxious French knight only reinspires memories of the Pythons amid the Scottish mist.) Bloom and Jeremy Irons , who gets the Dafoe-in-Platoon , we-were-fighting-for-something-once speech, represent the liberal garde . The simplistic narrative cosmology drags on the eyelids like a covert Star Wars  sequel.
For the most part, Kingdom of Heaven  is stupefyingly dull; the naturally dramatic material is reduced to vapid gazes, monosyllabic declarations, and aeons of sword-clanging combat, dolled up with every shuddery slo-mo post-production gimmick on Scott's state-of-the-art hard drive. His film, containing not so much as a single undoctored sunset, has as much human humor and energy as a car commercial, a Sir Ridley specialty. (Bloom is no help; his earnest emptiness makes old-school costume vet Victor Mature look like Jim Carrey . What wouldn't we give for Angelina Jolie  and a snake?) In fact, the unfettered passion on display for monstrous marching hordes, army formations, and computer- generated masses (occasionally seeming to use programming left over from The Return of the King ) suggests a fascist or at least newly Riefenstahlian perspective.
But getting to the bone of the matter, Scott's movie grabs a hold of this lit-dynamite "crusade" business rather delicately. On one hand, Kingdom of Heaven  is ostensibly secular, left-leaning, and almost anticlericalthe greatest vehemence is reserved for weaselly bishops. Saladin and his Muslims are noble, tolerant, and pragmatic, and in a telling reversal, the catapult-shelling of Jerusalem is as close to the full-on bombing of Baghdad  as American audiences will ever have to tolerate.
Mountains of Muslims die anyway, of course, which is regarded as the price of event moviemaking as well as empire. Balian, playing down party affiliation like a congressman in TV ads, inspires the civilian Jerusalemites to fight with heroic rationalizations like "None of us took this city from the Muslims!" Well, in that case . . . Not that second-generation Israelis aren't prone to saying similar things. Can you make a film about the Crusades and pretend that the Christian invaders aren't mortally responsible for the world's longest-running imperialistic carnage? Or that the culpability doesn't matter? Perhaps screenwriter William Monahan  appreciated the nuanced moral vacuum produced by Schindler's List , the  American Holocaust movie with a sensitive Nazi for a hero and a sense of guiltless salvation that's palatable in public schools from Southampton  to Seattle.
"Who has claim?" Balian hollers late in the frayimplying that no one does, and that Jerusalem is only a few weapon surrenders from being Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood. The optimism is touching, but it's hard to say that Scott has, in the end, made an anti-war film. It's just anti-reality.
