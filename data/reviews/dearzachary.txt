Passion drives the hyperactive style of Kurt Kuenne’s very personal nonfiction film: Kuenne’s childhood friend, Dr. Andrew Bagby, was murdered in Pennsylvania in 2001, and the prime suspect, Bagby’s ex-girlfriend and fellow M.D., fled to Canada, where she gave birth to his son, Zachary. Then the story gets worse  deepening a tragedy that Kuenne unspools, with intrusive narrative flourishes, as a surprise horror story. Still, the facts are so awful that Dear Zachary  can be forgiven much of its antsiness  as a memorial, as a condolence to Bagby’s parents (who became activists for judicial reform in their late son’s honor), and as a howl of grief. B–

 It is impossible not to be fired up by Kurt Kuenne’s incendiary cri de coeur, “Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father.” At once a personal documentary about the murder of his best friend and a polemical rant against the Canadian justice system for coddling a dangerous sociopath, it wants to provoke outrage.  On Nov. 5, 2001, Mr. Kuenne’s oldest friend from childhood, Andrew Bagby, a doctor doing his residency in Latrobe, Pa., was shot to death in a parking lot. The killer, Shirley Turner, Andrew’s mentally unstable, Canadian-born ex-girlfriend, immediately fled the United States to live in St. John’s, Newfoundland, where she successfully fought attempts at extradition. Pregnant with Andrew’s child at the time of the killing, she gave birth to a baby boy, Zachary, on July 18, 2002.  Begun before a second tragedy altered its direction, “Dear Zachary” was conceived as a cinematic scrapbook for Zachary consisting of home movies Mr. Kuenne made with Andrew and loving reminiscences by Andrew’s family and friends, all of whom attest to what a wonderful, generous, life-loving fellow he was.  After Andrew’s death, his parents, David and Kathleen, sold their house in Sunnyvale, Calif., and moved to Canada to be near their grandson. Fearing that the boy was in danger from his mother, they waged a protracted custody battle with Shirley. To their horror, she was freed on bail pending extradition, on the ground that she posed no danger to society because she had killed the one person she wanted dead.  Suffice it to say, their fears were justified; the other shoe dropped. How and when, I leave you to discover for yourself.

What begins as a poignant tribute to filmmaker Kurt Kuenne's dead best friend snowballs into a gut-wrenching true-crime story in "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father," a film that, like the twist-filled events it covers, isn't always what it appears to be. Though presented as a visual scrapbook for the victim's son Zachary, Kuenne initiated the project before learning Andrew Bagby's unstable ex-lover was pregnant with their unborn son when the murder was committed. By addressing the memorial to young Zachary, Kuenne lands on a human-interest hook that has made the pic the talk of Slamdance.
Kuenne would probably be the first to admit he's crafted a shamelessly manipulative version of events, one that works best for audiences who know nothing about the case (which was widely publicized in "Dance With the Devil," a bestseller written by Andrew's father, David Bagby). Considering how much more tragedy lies in store, one can hardly fault the helmer for using the elements at his disposal -- from a button-pushing piano score to saintly photos and homevideos left behind -- to transform his personal tribute into a full-blown polemic. As dozens of oncamera interviews show, those who survived Andrew were angry and hurt by his murder, and the film will leave auds feeling no differently.
When they were kids, Andrew Bagby starred in all Kuenne's amateur movies, which means the helmer has boxes of footage of his friend. "Dear Zachary" is, above all, a virtuoso feat in editing, and Kuenne uses the material at his disposal to devastating effect. For example, a short film about time travel, in which Bagby can be seen saying, "I'll go back in time and stop people dying," takes on a painful new irony in this context.
Rather than letting friends and family share specific memories onscreen, Kuenne blends them together in sweeping, rapidly edited montages. The stories dissolve into one another, leaving audiences with an impressionistic sense of Bagby's legacy -- a succession of smiling faces, it turns out, can say as much as hours of longwinded testimonials.
As for Shirley Turner, the 40-year-old woman (Andrew was 28) who drove 1,600 miles to shoot Andrew after they broke up, Kuenne selects the least flattering footage possible. By crosscutting between court papers and pathological phone messages to Andrew's parents, Kuenne captures a sense of this deeply disturbed woman.
But there's more to Turner than meets the eye, and "Dear Zachary" switches gears, attacking the system and the individuals who allowed "a probably premeditated first-degree murderer go free."
The way Kuenne presents the material, with an aggressive style that lingers less than a second on most shots, it's impossible not to feel emotionally exhausted.

The nonfiction-film genre has grown fast, cheap, and out of control lately with the democratization of digital video cameras and iMovie . Much agitprop on politics and the environment is out there masquerading as documentary work. No longer do filmmakers feel the necessity to spend years tracking the development of a subject. So it's extraordinary to finally see a film worthy of comparison to Errol Morris 's seminal The Thin Blue Line  arriving two decades later. A lifetime in the making, Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father  investigates the murder of doctor Andrew Bagby , whom director Kurt Kuenne  had known and filmed in home movies since they were childhood friends. Bagby's ex-girlfriend, Shirley Turner , emerged as the prime suspect, and escaped to Canada while pregnant with their unborn son. Upon learning of this, Kuenne set out to interview everyone Bagby ever knew so that baby Zachary would one day get to know his dad. Meanwhile, Bagby's parents relocated from California to Newfoundland  to fight for custody of their grandson when it seemed there was no end to Turner's extradition process. Kuenne lovingly assembles home-movie footage and new interviews, while deftly borrowing a narrative trick from fiction—the plot twist—to create a true-crime story so gripping, devastating, and ultimately unforgettable that it easily trumps any thriller Hollywood  has to offer this year.
