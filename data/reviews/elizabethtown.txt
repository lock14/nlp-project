You can�t go home again, but if you do, you�d better discover yourself in the process or risk consignment to the slush pile of cinematic also-rans. This hoary Hollywood trope has gotten the treatment from Frank Capra to Zach Braff, and while the ambitious Elizabethtown
 seeks to retill those once fertile fields, its two-hour-plus running time borders on the interminable as Bloom and Dunst�s relationship inches forward with all the zip of a salted slug. It�s a black day for Seattle resident Drew Baylor (Lord of the Rings
� Bloom), whose crowning moment as the concept designer behind a fantastically overreaching sneaker turns out to cost his Nike-like company a billion dollars in lost revenue. The flopping footwear incident is only the beginning of Drew�s troubles, however. (To be fair, it is
 a spectacular downfall � the shoe in question looks like a manta ray � providing a juicy cameo from Baldwin as a wildly superficial CEO obviously patterned on Nike founder Phil Knight.) Adding to his woes, Drew�s ingenious, Rube Goldberg-esque suicide attempt is aborted when his sister Heather (Greer) calls with news of their father�s death in his hometown of Elizabethtown, Ky., and urges him to handle the responsibility of dad�s cremation. Drew acquiesces and promptly meets quirky Southern belle-cum-stewardess Claire at 30,000 feet, setting up a third-act romantic denouement that appears to be a given but which takes such a circuitous route getting there that any interest in it has long since gone the way of Drew�s dad. Once in Elizabethtown, hipster Drew is forced to recalibrate his internal code to "eccentric" as an extended family of neo-Gothic oddballs comes out in full force to celebrate the passing of the guard and to remind Drew that only in the Hollywood version of real life can so many quaint Southerners be so gosh-darn accepting of outsiders while also reminding him, and us, that Elizabethtown is more than a series of GPS coordinates: It�s also a state of mind. You could say the same about Pyongyang, I suppose, but frankly a nuclear-enabled Elizabethtown would be a far more terrifying vision (now there�s a movie I�d pay to see). As native color flocks around the prodigal son in the form of kooky, dare I say zany, blood kin, Drew and Claire flirt and frolic, stopping the film deader than dear old dad midway through for an extended montage of faux-witty and pseudo-revelatory late night pillow talk rivaled only by, um, Pillow Talk
 for sheer romantic flimflammery. Unfortunately, there�s none of the electricity of that fine Hudson/Day pairing on display in Crowe�s film. The slight, vaguely morose Bloom runs emotionally widdershins to the fizzy, hyper-charming Dunst, and only when the film turns into a road movie in its final half hour does Elizabethtown
 finally blossom into something of interest to anyone not actually living in that real Kentucky hamlet. (The film�s Web site crows, "We�re more than a movie!" but I have my doubts.) Drew is the anti-Lloyd Dobler � he doesn�t say anything much at all, leaving Claire to fill in the blanks and the rest of us wondering where the attraction is. Dunst is an immensely appealing actor, though, and it�s thanks to her perpetual dimples and wide-eyed enthusiasm that the film is as bearable as it is. When she�s off the screen, Elizabethtown
 goes dark and broody, stranding us with the morose Bloom during a third-act road trip that goes everywhere and nowhere at once.


Watch out for smart, perceptive filmmakers who make movies about their fathers. ''Big Fish" was Tim Burton on Paxil, vacant and even-tempered. Now, sadly, Cameron Crowe has decided to pay his filial respects. The movie is ''Elizabethtown," and it's his most nakedly square picture yet.
He casts the English actor Orlando Bloom as Drew Baylor, a designer of high-end, mass-market sneakers. After his latest shoe -- the Spasmotica -- bombs, costing his Nike
-like company an improbable $972 million, he heads home and tries to impale himself on a kitchen knife. But just in time, his cellphone vibrates with news of another death, his father's. So the son postpones suicide and flies to the film's eponymous Kentucky town (dad had been visiting his birthplace) to bring the body back to his mother (Susan Sarandon) and younger sister (Judy Greer) in Oregon. The trip plunks Drew smack in the middle of an endless, boisterous family he hardly knows.
For a stretch, the movie shows promise. The bloviating narration recedes. The personalities push themselves at Drew, who blankly takes in all the accents and affection and pictures, and the camera noses around the corners of a crowded house. In short, ''Elizabethtown" feels authentically alive.
Drew, on the other hand, remains frustratingly inert. Bloom may be a formidable actor, but in movie after movie, he looks misplaced. Crowe leaves Drew in a funk for so long that by the time the fog lifts we've stopped believing. The character lacks a philosophy. He's also missing a soul.
But Crowe, ever the idealist, has given Drew a savior: the flight attendant he meets on the plane to Louisville (magically, he's the only passenger). She's a relentlessly down-home woman named Claire, played by Kirsten Dunst, who again requires us to bring our sunglasses. Things are grim for a picture when not even she can pick it up, but that's what a saggy state things are in here for Crowe.
Claire helps Drew realize he didn't really know his dad. And in a long sequence, Drew and Claire share an epic conversation on their cellphones, but we never feel the click between these two. Yet for the duration of Drew's brief stay, they speak to each other in whimsical pontifications while the soundtrack shuffles through Crowe's iTunes playlist. Apparently, what they have to say to each other is better expressed by Tom Petty and Elton John.
Those aren't cool artists. Not anymore. Neither is the Lindsey Buckingham acoustic number that plays in one scene, good as it is. But no one will ever mistake a Cameron Crowe movie for a work of cool. This, of course, is Crowe's charm. His movies don't sit at the same table as the Tarantinos, the Wong Kar Wais, or the Gus Van Sants. Crowe's movies possess an unfashionable earnestness. They believe in the essential goodness of you and me. They believe that love can conquer everything.
Crowe's best movies, ''Say Anything . . ." and ''Almost Famous," risked cool for idealism and sentimentality. He can make you embrace corniness, because, better than a lot of American directors, he knows that, at our most besotted, corniness is an apotheosis of love. To wit, Renee Zellweger's ''You had me at hello" in ''Jerry Maguire." Only when mockingly plucked from the film does that line sound like a Hallmark moment. In the context of the movie itself, it was poetry, and it got to your heart. Crowe's other iconic movie moment was also romantic poetry: John Cusack hoisting a boombox up to Ione Skye's window in ''Say Anything . . . ." Romeo spoke Shakespeare to Juliet, but failing that he would have used Peter Gabriel.
The crying shame of ''Elizabethtown" is that nary an ounce of it approaches that sort of emotional transcendence. There is one stirring sequence, a road trip across the country, that caps the film, but, boy, does it come too late. What does Crowe intend for ''Elizabethtown"? In part, this is supposed to be his ''see the world" movie, but it feels hermetic. His ideas about globalism and grief are unformed to the point that his optimism seems uncharacteristically naïve. The movie feels long and strangely derivative of his other, better work. For the first time, he can't focus his romantic abstractions into fresh moments of insight or truth. What, for example, are we to make of the tragically embarrassing memorial service built around Sarandon and her character's personal growth?
Audiences of a certain hipster disposition, in fact, will see ''Elizabethtown" and pine for Zach Braff's ''Garden State," the movie to which ''Elizabethtown" bears an unfortunate and inferior resemblance. Both movies suffer from inert heroes who are awakened by bizarre lovelies. Obviously, this is a Cameron Crowe film, but his writerly instincts feel as if they're jammed up and suffocated. Indeed, too much of the film is set in Drew's hotel. So it's stale with still air, and it takes far too long for Crowe to crack a window.


         What's the difference between a failure and a fiasco? That's the first question Orlando Bloom's character, Drew Baylor, asks himself in Cameron Crowe's "Elizabethtown," and the question he keeps asking throughout. It also echoes some of the critical response that followed the movie's premiere at the Venice and Toronto film festivals, making it seem uncannily prescient and self-aware.
 
  In Toronto, "Elizabethtown" was introduced with a disclaimer, and Crowe has since trimmed it by about 15 minutes. But I doubt the edit will change the minds of anyone who didn't like it the first time around. The new version remains, in many ways, a mess of a movie — but a warm, friendly mess that's hard not to like, even when it tests your patience.
 


         






    Despite his own success, Crowe seems unusually drawn to big-scale failure both as a subject and a mind-altering experience. You get the feeling that success-worship bugs him, because it inhibits people and makes them cowardly and conformist. ("Success — not greatness — was the only god the entire world served," Drew says, as his colleagues throw him pitying looks.) The upside of Jerry Maguire's indigestion-inspired career suicide was that it doubled as a psychedelic trip and moral epiphany. It's not until Crowe's protagonists fail, or are publicly humiliated or rejected, that their authentic selves emerge. "Failure," Drew muses, as he descends from a helicopter, ducking to avoid decapitation on his way to getting fired, "is simply the nonpresence of success. But a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions."
 
  Like his characters, Crowe is given to flights of fancy, sudden enthusiasms, and risks — which sets him apart from other contemporary commercial American filmmakers. "Elizabethtown" doesn't just open on the subject of failure, it gives in to the same impulses that send Crowe's protagonists on lonely, weird and often misunderstood missions. (Like proposing a Rockwellian code of ethics to a bunch of shark-like sports agents, say, or designing a blubbery sneaker in the shape of a stingray.) The movie gets lost sometimes, wandering down several stray paths to nowhere, only to suddenly change course and wind up in an unexpectedly exhilarating place. In this sense, it's the opposite of the quick commute of the average commercial movie. It's a meandering road trip instead.
 
  Drew is an athletic shoe designer whose wildly anticipated sneaker, the Späsmotica, has just lost his company $972 million. Crushed and humiliated, he goes home, fastens a butcher knife to his exercise bike and hops on. Then the phone rings. It's his sister, Heather (Judy Greer), with the news that their father has died while visiting relatives in Elizabethtown, Ky. On his way to retrieve the body, Drew meets an alarmingly spunky flight attendant named Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst), a desperately lonely soul who clings grimly to optimism as if one bad mood will send her over the edge of the world. Checking into a hotel in Louisville that night, Drew calls Claire (mainly because he can't reach anyone else). Pretty soon, she is turning up in Elizabethtown, trying to charm him into loving her. Drew, meanwhile, has discovered a family and a side to his father he never knew existed.
 
  From the enormity of Drew's financial disaster ("It's so big it could be rounded up to a billion," says Drew's boss, Phil, played by a hilariously unctuous Alec Baldwin) to the puffed-up silliness of the shoe company where he works (an utopian Pacific Northwest "campus" with an in-house basketball team and a global environmental watchdog project) to the farcical look of his über-sneakers, with their floppy fins and decorative umlaut, every detail in "Elizabethtown" is taken to its absurdist extreme. At the same time, it's a deeply personal movie, based loosely on Crowe's experiences after the release of his first movie, "Say Anything," whose fortunes were unexpectedly reversed by the mighty thumbs of Siskel and Ebert, and whose success his father was celebrating when he died suddenly. What Crowe seems to be going for are the heightened emotions that go along with major personal catastrophes, those rare times in life when everything seems to come together in one, tangled, glowing mess of meaning.
 
  At sporadic intervals, he succeeds. The film's best moments are pure expressions of feeling: Drew melting down in the car after failing to find his freeway exit for the umpteenth time; Drew and Claire visiting Colonel Sanders' grave, where people have left individual hot sauce packets in loving tribute; the moment they walk up to each other on the morning after their all-night talk, cellphones still stuck to their ears, Claire asking, "Can we hang up now?"; Uncle Dale's (Loudon Wainwright III) quiet disapproval of the way his son Jessie (Paul Schneider) is raising his son; Jessie's resignation at his father's disapproval.
 
  But these moments and others that are equally touching, funny and true, not to mention set to great music, make the movie's missteps all the more frustrating. Bloom is surprisingly comfortable in the role of Drew, coming off as sweet, warm and easygoing, and easily in touch with his pit of despair. Claire is likable enough when she relaxes, which is almost never. (All her emotional push-pulling comes to feel a little crazy considering Drew isn't really push-pulling back.) But Susan Sarandon and Greer, playing Drew's over-the-top mother and flaky neurotic sister, respectively, seem as if they belong in another movie entirely and could have easily been reduced to voices on the phone.
 
  That Sarandon's and Greer's characters survived the cut is especially galling, considering what was lost.
 
  In the first cut, the fortunes of Drew's shoes are reversed when a teenager discovers that the Späsmotica can be modified so that the shoes whistle when you walk in them. The trend spreads organically, virally, and soon, teenagers everywhere are clipping their fins and filling the air with an ethereal tune. The sequence — which will no doubt be restored on the DVD — is the excised heart of the movie, as well its hopeful message about personal vision and its mysterious connective powers. Drew's shoes outlive both hype and criticism to find their audience. It'll be interesting to see if the movie does the same.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that amateur travelogues are more engrossing for the one who has traveled  than for those hailing the traveler's return. Looking at an image, the traveler recalls not only the names of the young couple he met from the hotel room down the hall  Chuck and Cindy, lovebirds getting married who favor bridal-party T-shirts blazing Chuck and Cindy's special snookums slogan  but also what the stale air felt like in that hallway. Those greeting the traveler and his indulgent video footage, meanwhile, look at pictures of Chuck and Cindy and think, ''Jeez, I'm glad I wasn't there. Hey, look, a cornfield. Huh, funny T-shirts. Gotta remember to wash a load of darks.''
Think of Elizabethtown  as Cameron Crowe's rambling amateur travelogue, one from a well-liked professional filmmaker momentarily so distracted by private notes scrawled on his souvenir map that he gets lost en route to telling his story of self-renewal. This undershaped, overlong warmedy is an homage to the memory of his late father (just as Almost Famous  was an homage to his mother), to the love of a good woman (just as Renée Zellweger completed Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire ), and to the balm of extended family who really don't care whether you're a famous success in the big, fancy world or not, so long as you stay awhile, eat a second helping, and pause to enjoy a gander at the stars. It's an album of vignettes  there actually is an encounter with a bridal couple called Chuck and Cindy, and it's clear that seeing their picture, the filmmaker remembers how in love with love the two appeared to be, so optimistic and full of American spirit, and with such charmingly corny taste in T-shirts; their guileless hopefulness contrasted poignantly with the lone traveler's own complicated despair on that specimen day. There's also a very long, uncomfortable tap dance (a literal tap dance) from Susan Sarandon as a life-affirming widow, and a tonally jarring visit to the motel site where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. And from Crowe the famous former rock journalist who knows how potent pop sound can be, there's an extended shuffle of songs, as if he never wants the tunes to stop, ever. In Elizabethtown , they don't  they work overtime, and still there's a space where Crowe's yearning to convey what matters to him isn't met by the viewing party he provides.
Casting is part of the problem. Dreamy to preteen girls as he is, Orlando Bloom reflects no light as Drew Baylor, a young hotshot shoe designer and media celebrity who has just seen his new sneaker design flop in the market-place. (I suppose Crowe ''failed'' with Vanilla Sky , but surely not with such grandiose consequence.) Bloom's affect is so wan and passive that it's difficult to believe this Drew could win big, lose big, or even sneeze big, although I like that Crowe has situated his spiritually depleted hero at a high-rolling Oregon-based company transparently modeled on Nike. (Alec Baldwin makes brief, fine mischief as the big boss, Phil, transparently modeled on Nike's Phil Knight.) Are we meant to conclude that moviemaking and shoemaking share similarities of product and process? We are: Sometimes you make a hit, and sometimes you make a wonton-shaped loser of an athletic shoe (or movie) that threatens to sink a company. But before Drew can commit seppuku, proportion is restored by a tragedy bigger than dud footwear: His mother (Sarandon) and sister (Judy Greer), who are also Oregon transplants, inform him that his father has suddenly died while visiting the original family homestead in Kentucky, and it's up to Drew to fly out and accompany the body back to the Northwest. Death of a sole is trumped by death of a soul.
The rest of Elizabethtown   given a good remedial editing once-over since its unveiling at the Toronto film festival but still squirreling and sidetracking too often for the simple, intimate size of the story  is how Drew journeys from here to there and back again, and what music he listens to on his journey. Oh, and boy meets girl: On the plane trip out, Drew crosses fate with Claire, a determinedly upbeat flight attendant played by Kirsten Dunst, and she becomes part of the odyssey too.
''I'm impossible to forget but hard to remember,'' Claire peeps, one of the many koans of nothingness she chirrups, with Dunst smiling and shrugging frequently to suggest goodness of heart in the absence of concrete details of personality. The phrase is cute  like a Chuck and Cindy T-shirt  but what does it mean? There's no time to consider: We're on to another song.


A correction was made to this review on Sept. 6, 2005.
Returning to his romantic comedy roots after "Vanilla Sky," helmer Cameron Crowe throws a friendly party with "Elizabethtown," laying on colorful characters, witty banter and a constant stream of vintage tunes. However, bash lasts too long, and guests try too hard to have fun, and pic's busy, neo-screwball script -- about a shoe designer planning his father's funeral in a Kentucky town while falling for a perky stewardess met en route -- suffers from arch editing and a surfeit of whimsical subplots. Modest B.O. looks likely.

Although presumably in development for some time, basic set-up sounds like a sunnier, studio version of Zach Braff's indie hit "Garden State," which beat "Elizabethtown" to the punch by a year and a half. "State" was a similar tale of a depressed young man who travels back East for a parent's funeral and ends up finding love with a gorgeous, hip chick. But where Braff's pic was riddled with slacker angst and featured characters with jagged edges, nearly everyone in "Elizabethtown" is as gosh-darn nice as a warm sunny day.
The only real exceptions are a couple of meanies at the West Coast corporate headquarters of footwear company Mercury, where workaholic protagonist Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is introduced. Much like the title character in the opening of Crowe's biggest hit, "Jerry Maguire," Drew is in disgrace. Alec Baldwin brings comic relish to the scene where his CEO character Phil coldly berates Drew for fashioning a sneaker that "may cause an entire generation to return to bare feet."
On top of that, Drew's g.f. Ellen (Jessica Biel) dumps him. He prepares to commit suicide, but is diverted by a phone call from his ditsy sister, Heather (Judy Greer): Their father has suddenly died in his hometown, Elizabethtown, Ky., and Drew must go there to take care of the funeral.
Heather, meanwhile, will handle their manic mom, Hollie (Susan Sarandon), who deals with grief by learning to tap dance.
From here on out, it's as if every character in the screenplay had the phrase "...but lovable" attached. For starters, Drew meets cute with kooky stewardess Claire (Kirsten Dunst), an archetypal Cameron Crowe femme love interest. Like Kate Hudson's Penny Lane in "Almost Famous," Claire is beautiful, slightly neurotic, and has impeccable taste in rock and pop (like Crowe).
In Elizabethtown, Drew meets up with his noisy extended family, including maternal Aunt Dora (cooking-show host Paula Deen), laidback Uncle Dale (country star Loudon Wainwright III), wily cousin Bill (Bruce McGill), and rowdy, wannabe rocker Jessie (Paul Schneider).
One of pic's funniest lines has Jessie countering accusations that he's not raising his son right by solemnly asserting he wants the kid "to know about both Abraham Lincoln and Ronnie Van Zant." (Pic pays tribute to Southern icon Van Zant, the late Lynyrd Skynyrd lead singer, with an impressive cover of "Free Bird" at its climax.)
Although rich in screwball silliness and sharp one-liners, film lacks the narrative drive one finds in the classic comedies of Preston Sturges, Frank Capra and Billy Wilder, whom Crowe always seems to try to emulate. Crowded with amusing supporting turns and eccentric minor characters, "Elizabethtown" becomes not so much character-driven as backseat-driven, taking frequent detours from the budding romance between Drew and Claire.
Love story is, in fact, pic's weak spine. Most effective point in its dramatic arc comes early on, when Drew and Claire bond through an all-night phone call that ends on a tart, believable note. But although Bloom and Dunst look good together, the grit that makes the pearl of a great onscreen couple is missing here.
Partly it's the script's fault; partly it's the stars'. Dunst looks luminous as ever and holds up her end well, although her Claire perpetually speaks too-slick movie dialogue. She's just a breath away from seeming like a controlling nut, or worse.
Bloom's Drew is mostly passive, and the British thesp brings little to the table apart from good looks and a reasonable American accent. It's hard to know what Claire sees in him.
Film's running time is drawn out by everyone getting a moment or two. For instance, Sarandon's Hollie has a big, five-minute speech that becomes a (not very funny) standup comedy routine at the final memorial service, climaxed by a tap dance.
In the end, the whole shebang feels as if it started out not with the characters or the funeral-homecoming plot device, but with a powerhouse mix tape of outstanding ditties around which Crowe then structured his story.
Choices include less-heard tunes by w.k. artists (Elton John's "My Father's Gun," Tom Petty's "It'll All Work Out"), balanced against hits by upcoming performers like Ryan Adams' ("Come Pick Me Up") and the kind of songs only proper pop aficionados and ex-Rolling Stone scribes like Crowe would have heard, such as "Hard Times" by Eastmountainsouth.
Editing by David Moritz feels nervous and drains comic potential in some scenes by favoring shot-reverse-shot where a simple well-played master would have sufficed. At 138 minutes, running time is far too baggy, despite signs of last-minute trimming in several strands that don't quite pay off.

Reviews of Elizabethtown   will begin in one of two ways: The reviewer will compare Cameron Crowe 's latest to the bizarrely similar Garden State , or she'll quip on the opening voiceover by Orlando Bloom , a rumination on the difference between "failure" and a "fiasco."
There's no avoiding it, so here goes. Both Elizabethtown  and Garden State  involve a despondent single guy in flux returning home after a deathin this case, Bloom's Drew Baylor  must retrieve the body of his father, who has died visiting Kentucky relations. As in Garden State , the despondent lad's life is changed by a gutsy woman and some killer tunes. But where the earlier flick, in its smallness, felt like an honest representation of writer-director-star Zach Braff 's struggles with notions of home, Crowe's is a hodgepodge of great ideas and moods in search of a plot to enrich.
Great idea number one: Spoof '90s lifestyle culture largesse. We begin with a lengthy sequence about Drew's career plunge after designing a flop running shoe for a hegemonic company. His boss, Phil, played with Glengarry  gusto by Alec Baldwin , is a giddily drawn billionaire spiritualist-sadist, a fun conflation of two iconic "Phils," Nike 's Phil Knight  and the NBA 's Phil Jackson . But unlike Braff's lo-fi shorthand intro that humanized his wage-slave antihero, Baldwin's bigness and the shiny mocked milieu leave Bloom a blank. If Say Anything 's Lloyd Dobler  was the perfect boyfriend and Jerry Maguire  the perfect dick, Drew Baylor is the perfect ghost.
Jumping way too soon into his big-song, window-stare contemplation mode, Crowe takes identification with Drew for granted. Though it's played for laughs, the fact that mom Susan Sarandon  and sister Judy Greer  are too frazzled to go to Kentucky comes off as simply weird. Sarandon seems as confused as we are that her character would take tap lessons instead of making funeral arrangements, and Greer just seems an unfunny version of her Arrested Development   nut job.
But then there's great idea number two: casting Kirsten Dunst . Drew meets flight attendant Claire on a plane to Kentucky, and Dunst, like Kate Hudson  before her, devours her role as the wise, goofy, music-savvy goddess. Like Woody Allen , Crowe repeatedly scripts the perfect girlfriend (without, thank god, injecting himself into the fantasy). But Drew is such a void that Claire's obsessive affection for him verges on stalker-esque. So too do the suffocating attentions of Drew's Kentucky cousins. Without an emotional anchor, absurd touches veer into almost Lynchian creepinessas when Drew arrives in Elizabethtown and everyone wordlessly points him toward his family's street.
Crowe's confident, clockwork tearjerking often seems baseless. Just when we're sure Drew hardly knew his dad, moving soft-focus flashbacks of father and son sucker punch us out of nowhere. Crowe's mastery of the music-aided emotional catharsis is in fine form; it just needs a real story. Of course, you'll have long given up on narrative by the time you reach great idea number three: the perfect-girlfriend road trip map and mix tape. By the time Drew ditches the titular town and heads west alone with his dad's ashes, following a route charted and scored by his muse, we're as ecstatic to be on the road as he is, and the sad, funny shots of him talking to and patting the urn in the passenger seat might make you cry from both the inherent pathos and for the movie this could have been. It's not a fiasco, but as the voiceover admits, anyone can fail.
