Let's get one thing straight right off the obelisk: I have been and shall always be a serious lover of Sid and Marty Krofft's trippy, early Seventies, Saturday morning kids television shows. If you're under the age of 30, the Krofft imprimatur may mean little or nothing to you, although with the steady re-release of their many live-action series over the past few years � including the wonderfully psychedelic H.R. Pufnstuf
 and the truly mind-warping Lidsville
 (which features a freakishly off-the-rails star turn by no less than Charles Nelson Reilly) � it's difficult to believe that anyone with an interest in American pop culture and access to YouTube isn't aware of the Kroffts� seismic influence on an entire generation of impressionable young minds. The Kroffts� Land of the Lost
, which ran for three seasons on NBC beginning in 1974, chronicled the adventures of the Marshall family � dad Rick, son Will, and daughter Holly � who became trapped in an alternate universe where stop-motion dinosaurs battled it out with a race of lizard-men dubbed the Sleestak, and a furry little primate named Chaka pulled double duty as comic relief and narrative linchpin. The dinosaurs, particularly a T-rex christened "Grumpy" by the Marshall clan, were of sub-Harryhausen quality, but that made little difference to the 8- to 12-year-old demographic targets. The show was wildly imaginative, gamely acted, and above all cool
. A recent viewing of several original episodes by yours truly suggests  the Kroffts were way ahead of their time, too, cramming action-filled episodes with everything from unsettlingly Philip K. Dickian plotlines (intentional or otherwise) to druggy countercultural references. So what to make of this bloated, noisy, and decidedly uncool remake by avowed Land of the Lost
 fan Silberling? I blame both pop-culture creep (what was once strange and vaguely subversive is now, like Charles Nelson Reilly, old hat) and Ferrell, who stars here as the dullish, food-obsessed, Matt Lauer-hating inventor Dr. Rick Marshall. Ferrell has been spinning his comedic wheels for what seems like ages now, and his once-entertaining schtick � the man-child forced by circumstances to grow up (if only just a teensy bit) � is now, officially, entering into the land of the lost career. He's headed, like Reilly, for that eternal graveyard of once-upon-a-time funnymen, The Hollywood Squares
 (which, although currently off the air, is due for another incarnation any day now). Silberling's remake is heavy on CGI saurians. The bug-eyed, slow-moving Sleestaks are faithful re-creations of the originals, but the script's idea of updating the Kroffts� show is to make hairy monkey-boy Chaka (Taccone, of sketch troupe the Lonely Island) a randy opportunist. Land of the Lost
 is, unfortunately, a perfect example of studio bloat: It's all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable. It feels less of an homage than an obligation � a big-budget, assembly-lined Will Ferrell castaway that's ultimately less entertaining than, well, The Hollywood Squares
. Feh.

About halfway into "Land of the Lost," our intrepid time-space travelers stumble into a desert wasteland filled with the half-buried bric-a-brac of human civilization: Ferris wheels and catapults, convertibles and fast food signs, swimming pools and phone booths and ice cream trucks. It's a cultural boneyard. Not at all coincidentally, so's the movie. Genially terrible, "Lost" is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more.
  - was the broadcast equivalent of an orange shag rug. The movie picks that rug to shreds and laughs at the pieces.
We're not exactly talking "The Iliad" here, even if the original show's producers, Sid and Marty Krofft, did draft well-regarded sci-fi writers to work on the scripts. (Schlocky as it was, "Lost" was a respectable step up from the Kroffts' earlier Saturday morning show "H.R. Pufnstuf," whose Barney-on-acid visions still haunt this writer's waking nightmares.) So Ferrell and his writers have a free hand to reinvent with affectionate mockery.
Fair enough. The star plays Rick Marshall, a pudgy blowhard  - nothing new there  - who has invented a "tachyon amplifier" with the power to open a gateway to other dimensions. Humiliated on TV by "Today" show host Matt Lauer, gamely playing himself, Marshall still plows ahead on a "routine expedition" to the land of three moons, accompanied by a comely British scientist (Anna Friel) and a belly-scratching cave guide  - Danny McBride, lately an inspired supporting boor of guy-comedies like "Tropic Thunder" and "Pineapple Express."
Once there, the threesome encounters revved-up, jokey versions of the old show's characters: a helpful apeman named Cha-ka (Jorma Taccone), a rampaging T. Rex nicknamed "Grumpy," those slow-moving Creature From the Black Lagoon knockoffs known as Sleestaks. Because modern summer blockbusters call for modern measures, Cha-ka is now constantly horny, the Sleestaks have scary double rows of serrated teeth, and the T. Rex is no longer an adorable Claymation beastie but a screeching computer-generated behemoth. (Don't take the little ones, by the way, unless they can handle sub-"Jurassic Park" scares and a lot of masturbation gags.)
Writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas have backgrounds in TV sitcoms and sketch comedy, and Ferrell has been indulging in online comedy shorts. Accordingly, "Land of the Lost" has the attention span of a caffeinated squirrel, scampering from smutty jokes to ragged action sequences and back again. Visually, the film's a disgrace, with jumpy handheld camerawork that plays as if the producers left the tripod back in the party trailer. Your kids could shoot a better movie. Your kids have shot a better movie.
Where "Land of the Lost" gets its laughs is from stringing dopey/funny pop-culture references along the most tenuous of plotlines. The joke that the tachyon amplifier is built from a boombox that plays the original cast recording of "A Chorus Line" eventually gets old, but it leads to the movie's most goofily inspired bit, with Ferrell pirouetting through a lava field of pterodactyl eggs.
"Blades of Glory" got an entire movie out of that, though. "Lost" is merely built on riffage: a Santana vocorder imitation here, a nod to Snoopy's doghouse there. You could play at home and save on the popcorn. As a diehard fan of pop-cult arcana, I appreciated the shout-outs to the 1979 comedy "The In-Laws" (Ferrell running around yelling "Serpentine!") and 1961 shipwreck fantasy "Mysterious Island" (a Ray Harryhausen-inspired giant crab meets an appropriate end). But I would have preferred a movie that took the business of being funny a bit more seriously.
Still, that's what you get with megastar "SNL" comedy grads like Ferrell and Mike Myers and, at his weakest, Adam Sandler: the proudly smug assumption that boner jokes, bad '70s songs, and computer graphics are all you need to separate summer audiences from their money. That may be true, but Sid and Marty Krofft deserve better and so do you.
.

         "Land of the Lost" is a silly contrivance of a comedy set in a strangely surreal world populated by fast-moving T. rexes, lumbering big-eyed lizardy Sleestaks, a tribe of monkey people and a random assortment of prehistoric wildlife. There are three moons floating above and a desert below, artfully littered with half-buried remnants of important cultural artifacts: a Big Boy statue, a piece of the Bay Bridge, an ice cream truck, a motel swimming pool and a Viking ship to name a few. It's enough to make the Salvador Dali in you smile, or sigh, depending on the moment.

Spinning wildly off the '70s Saturday morning TV series of the same name, it stars Will Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall, a quantum paleontologist whose time warp theories have landed him in an elementary school teaching precocious kids who specialize in sarcasm. 



         






  But before you despair that science isn't getting the respect it deserves, spunky beautiful researcher Holly (Anna Friel) slips into the classroom to encourage Dr. Rick to finish his mythic Tachyon particle accelerator. Huh? You know, the time-travel gizmo he abandoned after a really humiliating Matt Lauer grilling on "Today." But Holly has faith -- not even the legacy of the Lauer YouTube clip shakes it.

 What else then would any true man of science do but dig out the machine and head to a souvenir hut in the desert run by a wisecracking redneck named Will (Danny McBride)? As fate would have it, Will also doubles as a tour guide willing to paddle them down the polluted stream that disappears into Devil's Canyon Mystery Cave, which happens to be next door.

 Sure the cave looks like a papier-mâché science project, but the Tachyon readings are really high (and forgive me if I don't get all the science right). A flip of the Tachyon Meter switch and whoosh -- that stream is a rumbling river tossing them through a portal and into another world. Let the games begin.

Director Brad Silberling and screenwriters Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas have borrowed liberally and loosely from the series, grafting enough of its rock, paper, scissors design/emotional aesthetic onto "Land of the Lost" that the film will feel like a repressed memory experiment for fans of the show. The names are the same, only the identities have changed. Holly still wears braids, but she definitely doesn't think of Dr. Rick as dad. There's the "Beware of Sleestaks" whitewashed warning on a rock wall that even 30-or-so years later no one sees no matter how many times they walk past it. Monkey boy Chaka (Jorma Taccone) still speaks the screechy Pakuni developed by an actual linguist for the TV show, and the Sleestaks are still heavy breathers. 

The story is a simple one: The science gang is trying to deal with another world that comes with all the confusion of different life forms, new cultural clichés and an obsession with powerful crystals. It turns out that many truisms translate -- don't trust anyone in a tunic for starters -- but that doesn't mean there won't be mountains to climb, lava beds to cross, dinosaurs to outwit and outrun on their quest to save Earth from a Sleestak invasion, or difficulty finding their way back home. 

Like its characters, the film keeps getting lost too, stumbling as it struggles to keep kids and adults from squirming in their seats. There's a crowd-pleasing, clever T. rex named Grumpy fighting for screen time with a bad and long-running gag built around Chaka grabbing one of Holly's breasts every time he tries to say her name. Meanwhile, Ferrell is his likable Ferrell self, nothing new or especially exciting to report on that front. 

 The filmmakers get props for persuading Leonard Nimoy to suit up as the Zarn -- you know, an invisible alien creature except for the spots of light that totally make him visible. But not so much for a close-up shot of Ferrell delivering an F-bomb that seems the definition of gratuitous, which in movie lingo roughly means completely unnecessary but designed to get the boob in the back row to laugh. Mission accomplished.



   

Maybe it's something about the primitive setting (or the even more primitive script), but Will Ferrell lets his bumptiously, merrily masochistic id hang out in Land of the Lost . As Dr. Rick Marshall, a crackpot scientist who gets pulled into an alternate universe of dinosaurs, rubbery goggle-eyed lizard creatures, and apes who look like men in matted Isaac Mizrahi sweaters, Ferrell shrieks in terror like a teenage girl on a roller-coaster ride, and at one point he splatters himself with dino urine. When that stings his eyes, he tries to ease the pain by splattering on more. (It doesn't work.) A giant mosquito sucks the blood right out of him, and an ongoing battle with a T. rex  turns into a kind of 12-step test of our hero's self-esteem, which is roughly a notch below Stuart Smalley's.
You get the feeling that Ferrell is working this hard to beat himself up because Land of the Lost , a movie based on one of the cheesiest '70s Saturday-morning kids' shows ever devised, is anything-goes junk. The film's only conviction is its investment in its total lack of conviction. With three sidekicks to play off  Danny McBride as a good-ol'-boy survivalist, Anna Friel as an eye-candy science groupie, and Jorma Taccone as Chaka, the nattering, boy-faced ape-man  Ferrell ricochets from one pouty-angry sissy-man routine to the next. He even drops a bitchy F-bomb, which more or less signals the desperation of this grab-bag kiddie fantasy. Land of the Lost  has stray amusing  tidbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered.

 The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about the pricey movie  spinoff of the junky children’s television show “Land of the Lost” is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway. (Never say that Hollywood doesn’t know how to recycle.) Although the original Sid and Marty Krofft series, which ran from 1974 to 1976, doubtless still has its fans, because, well, some people are happy to watch whatever pops up on their televisions, I suspect that a fair share also like to light up before tripping down that particular nostalgic byway. Alas, only popcorn and soda were served at the screening I attended.  Not that I didn’t sometimes laugh anyway. It’s hard not to laugh when Will Ferrell, who can be very funny when given something actually funny to do, takes off his shirt to brandish his flabby-pack, a ritual unveiling now apparently written into all his contracts. It’s a cheap gag, certainly cheaper than the digital dinosaurs that stomp through a few scenes (and less embarrassing than watching him plug the movie’s marketing partner, Subway). But it’s effective largely because Mr. Ferrell’s version of comedy’s familiar child-man always skews more creepy than sentimental. Unlike most comic actors, even the most assaultive, he never begs for our love. Instead he exploits our willingness to laugh at other people’s debasement. He makes you laugh, he makes you squirm.  In “Land of the Lost” he does both, if not nearly enough. Wearing his usual deadpan, he plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a “quantum paleontologist” whose crackpot theories lead him down a waterfall and into a twilight zone alongside a brainy British babe, Holly (Anna Friel, pure icing), and a Southern-boy sidekick, Will (Danny McBride, diverting if running close to empty), where past, present and future come together in what looks like a giant Palm Springs flea market. There a Bob’s Big Boy statue lies semiburied not far from an allusion to “Planet of the Apes” i.e., a peek-a-boo Statue of Liberty. Much like prospective shoppers, the characters roam about poking at this and that —  in between cracking wise and sprinting from the regularly timed rampaging diversions.  Every so often the three visitors also cross paths with a few inhabitants of this thinly conceived fantasy, including a fuzzy critter, Chaka (Jorma Taccone), and a legion of googly-eyed lizard men, the Sleestaks, which  materialize in the jungle part of the set. It’s no surprise given the original material and the conspicuously low goals set here that the director, Brad Silberling, and the writers, Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, don’t give Mr. Ferrell and company much to do. That said, in between all the incidental nonsense they slip in an amusing interlude featuring a druggy substance and some male bonding that suggests that the best way to enjoy the desert is to bask in friendship under the light of multiple moons.    “Land of the Lost” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Mildly raunchy language and gnashing dinosaur teeth.

Hinting at the perils in synergy, "Land of the Lost" conspicuously feels as though someone at Universal was already planning the theme-park ride spinoff before taking a painfully wrong turn with the movie. Modernizing a 1970s children's TV show known for its cheap special effects offered certain possibilities, but the filmmakers have traded in any kid-friendly elements for bathroom humor of dinosaur-sized proportions. The result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target aud that should test Will Ferrell's appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 -- about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess.
Director Brad Silberling previously mixed special effects with comedy in "Casper" and "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events," but all the technology here seems to exist strictly for its own sake, without any thought to servicing an actual story. As for the performers cast adrift amid the mayhem, let's put it this way: It's never a good sign when "Today" host Matt Lauer (more synergy there, given the NBC-Universal connection) delivers the least irritating performance in a movie.
Despite paying lip service to an affinity for the campy source material, writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas have essentially kept the title of Sid and Marty Krofft's original series -- about a father and his two kids who descend into a primeval world, complete with lizard people, furry, monkey-like creatures and one stiff-looking T-Rex -- and mostly abandoned everything else.
In essence, only the names remain unchanged, with Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall, a "quantum paleontologist" who, after a disastrous appearance plugging his book with Lauer, winds up teaching science to elementary school kids. All that quickly changes, however, when attractive Cambridge doctoral student Holly ("Pushing Daisies'" Anna Friel, deserving better) walks in, prodding Marshall to revisit his research.
The two schlep out to the middle of nowhere, picking up a goofy tour guide, Will (Danny McBride, a Ferrell repertory member), before being sucked through a roller-coaster-like vortex into the you-know-what. There they encounter the ape-like Chaka (fellow "Saturday Night Live" alum Jorma Taccone), who speaks in guttural grunts and keeps not-so-subtly feeling up Holly, and a hostile T-Rex that takes an instant dislike to Rick.
From there, it's a tired, steep descent down the cinematic evolutionary ladder. Ferrell and McBride appear to enjoy riffing off each other -- including a sequence in which they get wildly high together -- but with only four characters in much of the movie, that's a whole lot of them to take. And while Silberling produces a few big visual gags -- from the dinosaurs, which strongly resemble those in "Jurassic Park," to a thirsty primitive mosquito -- there's an episodic quality to those scenes that makes the exercise play like a tedious trek to the exit in more ways than one.
In the process, a lot of expensive effects-work is squandered, as well as a few cheap-looking elements (including the character designs) meant to evoke the cheeky charms of the original series. Other wasted contributions amid a soundtrack replete with loud screaming include Michael Giacchino's score.
Granted, this is hardly the first adaptation of a classic TV show to go awry, but it's among the most misguided. In hindsight, the movie looks like a secondary consideration to the marketing possibilities, such as the "Today" tie-in and Ferrell's appearance on the Discovery Channel adventure program "Man vs. Wild."
"Bad things happen in caves, folks," Will warns his companions at one point. "Watch your movies." As "Land of the Lost" proves, they can happen in theaters, too.
