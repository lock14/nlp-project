''Innocent Voices" is not a happy time at the movies. It bears the distinction of bringing to the screen a dark nugget of history. During the El Salvadorian government's civil war with guerrillas that began in 1980 and lasted a dozen years, government forces resorted to stealing boys around the age of 12 (though no one in the movie asks to see a birth certificate) and conscripted them for military duty.
''Innocent Voices," directed by Luis Mandoki from Oscar Torres's autobiographical screenplay, is centered on Chava (Carlos Padilla). He lives in a slum with his mother, sister, and little brother. Chava is cute and plucky, but he's also 11, and the movie describes the time we spend with him as his last innocent year.
Chava's father left at the start of the war, and the family barely gets by on his mother's work as a seamstress. So he takes a job calling out the stops for a jolly, if vulgar bus driver (Jesus Ochoa). The beleaguered priest (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) appears to be the final authority figure left in town, and Chava's school day is twice interrupted by soldiers, once when they're looking for recruits and again when they start a gun battle with some guerrillas perched on the schoolhouse roof.
This all seems slightly less harrowing than it should be. Mandoki has difficultly juggling village life with the government's unsparing destruction of it. The scenes of military conflict are charged and grim, but when there are no soldiers descending or bullets flying, the movie is thin to the point of transparency: It wants to play a symphony on our heartstrings. Hence the swelling music, gratuitous slow-motion shots, and minor characters introduced to make us gasp when they fail to turn up later on. Neither Mandoki nor Torres succeeds at the melodrama their movie's aiming for.
Because Chava is often our viewfinder for events, he also has to do things just so we can see them. When the school is shot up, rather than stay on the floor, he runs to the door in time to see his mother (Leonor Varela) dodging bullets. He races out and across the street, where he embraces her in flagrant disregard of the violence around them. That feels foolish, though I'm sure the filmmakers imagined this moment to be heroic.
''Innocent Voices" is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place, but its treatment just feels wrong. Much of that seems due to Mandoki, who was born in Mexico City and has spent most of his career in Hollywood. His breakthrough was 1987's ''Gaby: A True Story," which was affecting in all the ways this new movie feels labored. His most familiar films are problem romances (''White Castle," ''When a Man Loves a Woman," ''Angel Eyes") and he's tried thrillers, too, like 2002's ''Trapped."
Working in Spanish on Mexican locations, he's brought his years in Hollywood to bear on ''Innocent Voices." And it could have done without that. The movie doesn't need more fake rain, slow-motion sequences, or operatic crying jags. It needs more outrage.

         Near the beginning of Luis Mandoki's harrowing "Innocent Voices," a man with a suitcase hurries out of a shack in a shantytown village. His wife, Kella (Leonor Varela), doesn't bother to bid him goodbye, for he is fleeing to the U.S. in the midst of the civil war that racked El Salvador from 1980 to 1992, leaving her with three small children to support as a seamstress.
 
  The film focuses on eldest son Chava (Carlos Padilla), who at 11 has but a short time to enjoy being a boy, because the government's armed forces, trained and supported by the U.S. military, sweep through towns and villages and seize all 12-year-old males and turn them into soldiers to attack guerrillas of the rebel FMLN. Although "Innocent Voices" is told from Chava's point of view, the story's center is his mother, who with the help of her own steadfast mother, Toya (Ofelia Medina), is trying to hold her family together the best she can in ever-worsening circumstances. She resists throwing her lot in with the FMLN, which her brother Beto (José Maria Yazpik) has joined, and in the meantime hopes she and her loved ones can stay clear of the increasing gunfire as the FMLN advances toward the capital.
 


         






    In the initial stages of the film, Chava is rather heavily established as a carefree kid, a cut-up with a ready smile just becoming aware of the opposite sex. There's a bit of a contrived, self-conscious quality to these lighter moments, which are swept away soon enough.
 
  Indeed, the picture builds power as it gets more serious — as the government troops randomly brutalize citizens and have absolutely no respect for teachers or the young priest (Daniel Giménez Cacho) who with the women of the community — the men are largely absent, having either fled or joined the FMLN — are striving to provide as normal a life as possible for the children.
 
  Mandoki, who with this film returns to the Spanish-speaking cinema after a string of Hollywood films, has brought a sure sense of the visual and taut construction to "Innocent Voices," based on a true story. It is filled with wrenching images, none more memorable than an overhead shot of boys of the shantytown lying flat on the corrugated tin roofs of their makeshift homes, hiding from a government roundup.

 In the most wrenching scene from Luis Mandoki's film "Innocent Voices," Salvadoran army troops storm into a  school in the heart of an impoverished rural village, bark out a list of names and forcibly conscript any boy over 12 into the military. As the dazed, terrified children are herded into the back of a truck and carted away, their stricken parents look on in horrified silence; to interfere would be to risk being shot to death.  This scene is one of several in the film, set in the 1980's during El Salvador's 12-year  civil war, that break your heart. During those years, the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, or the F.M.L.N.,  waged an armed struggle against the right-wing government, which responded by attacking villages and massacring inhabitants suspected of sympathizing with the left-wing guerrillas. The United States, fearing a Communist takeover of the country, backed the government and dispatched American soldiers to train the government troops, who eventually prevailed.  These events are viewed through the eyes of Chava (Carlos Padilla), a spirited 11-year-old boy and the oldest of three children who live with their mother, Kella (Leonor Varela), a seamstress struggling to provide for her family. Chava's father has left El Salvador for the United States, and there is no word as to his whereabouts.  Because this is history  viewed through the eyes of a child, "Innocent Voices" gives you feelings and impressions, but few facts. The only people  seen in the village are women, children, the elderly and the disabled cowering in fear and uncertainty. In one brief scene, American soldiers are shown handing out chewing gum to children whose parents warn them that the kindly soldiers are really their enemies. In another, Chava witnesses the kidnapping off the street of two girls who are dragged away to be raped; the heroic local priest (Daniel Giménez Cacho), the film's most eloquent voice, refuses to tell the boy what will happen to them.  The film is based on the real-life childhood experiences of Oscar Torres, who co-wrote the screenplay with the Mexican director Mr. Mandoki. It is set mostly in the year between Chava's 11th and 12th birthdays, as the war worsens and his conscription looms.  Between attacks, life in the village goes on. Chava, an enterprising child, talks a local bus driver into giving him a job collecting fares and announcing the stops. He pursues an innocent flirtation with Cristina Maria (Xuna Primus), the daughter of a local teacher. One day, an uncle (José María Yazpik), an F.M.L.N. member, sneaks back into town for a visit. He brings a guitar and calms the household during a raid by quietly singing and playing a banned folk song. Later he takes the boy to visit his camp in the mountains, gives him a portable radio, shows him a forbidden station on the dial and warns him never to play it in public. Chava is so delighted by his toy that he naïvely struts through the streets, blaring it under the noses of the soldiers until the priest intercedes.  But the familiar world shatters the instant a military vehicle wheels around a corner, scattering the panicked villagers, who huddle on the floors of their shacks, clutching mattresses against the bullets that rake through the cardboard-thin walls.  If these  horrific scenes are well directed, they belong to a movie that has no qualms about pressing your emotional buttons. The mother-child bond and Chava's puppy love are stroked by the same heavy directorial hand that applied extra layers of sentimental varnish to Hollywood movies like "When a Man Loves a Woman" and "Message in a Bottle."  Early in the story, Kella named Chava "the man of the house." When the war worsens, and mother and son are separated, her search for him and their eventual reunion are squeezed for a last teardrop long after the well has been depleted. "Innocent Voices" is a movie in which there are only heroes and villains, the persecutors and the persecuted.  It is understandable and maybe even necessary that a movie with a humanitarian agenda should bluntly manipulate the emotions. But how far should it go? As an outcry against the forcible conscription of children into armies around the world, "Innocent Voices," is an honorable film. But as a balanced portrait of a tragic civil war, it is simplistic and opaque. A movie like "Hotel Rwanda," which also indulged in sentimental excess to dramatize mass slaughter, at least provided some background and shading to the events it portrayed. "Innocent Voices" offers neither.  "Innocent Voices" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has harrowing scenes of war.
Based on the experiences of co-writer Oscar Torres , Innocent Voices  is personal in the most limiting sense: a memoir of war-torn El Salvador  presentedwith a heaping side of nostalgiafrom the perspective of someone too young to understand it. For more than an hour, schmaltzmeister Luis Mandoki  (Message in a Bottle ) directs as if on assignment for Miramax . After his father splits for the U.S., 11-year-old Chava (Carlos Padilla ) assumes duties as man of the house, makes eyes with a cute girl, and rages against the civil war in his own ineffectual, adorable way (e.g., dancing through the streets to "I Will Survive," emanating from a contraband radio). The sporadic violence is so bloodless that explosions function as a kind of design element. Eventually, harder times arrive, bringing with them a new set of contrivances, as Chava is almost gunned down alongside two of his peersMandoki drags out the moment for maximum suspenseand struggles with pulling the trigger when faced with a kill-or-be-killed proposition. It may have all happened, but it certainly seems touched up. The scene where Chava distracts his siblings from gunfire by playing with cosmetics is perfect shorthand for the film as a whole.
