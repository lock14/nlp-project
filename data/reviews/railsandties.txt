It's becoming a bit tiresome watching Kevin Bacon suffer, and he isn't done any favors by this thudding weeper, which Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) directed. Bacon plays an engineer who fails to stop his passenger train from slamming into a car, killing the depressed woman who planted it on the tracks. It's contrived enough that Bacon illegally ''adopts'' the woman's young son. Did I mention that his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) has terminal cancer? Rails & Ties  is like one bad TV movie that slammed into another.

The actress Alison Eastwood’s first feature as a director, “Rails & Ties,” has a functional visual style and an abundance of drama that would go unnoticed in the close-up, actor-oriented world of television. The film is so self-consciously unadorned, so   humble and plain, that it feels as if its director didn’t want us to think that she was trying to make some kind of cinematic statement. She hasn’t. Though she serves her actors well enough and sometimes even better than that, her grasp of the medium and its expressivity is less sure. Ms. Eastwood’s smartest move was to tap Kevin Bacon for one of her leads. As Tom Stark, an emotionally tamped-down railroad engineer with a dying wife, Mr. Bacon gives the film gravity and energy. Unlike Marcia Gay Harden, an appealing actress who takes on the role of the terminally ill wife, Megan, with rather too much enthusiasm, Mr. Bacon plays it as cool as he can. He’s brusque in word and severe in gesture, tightly wound, withholding. He keeps the character back from us, in reserve, even when called on to execute an important moment, as when he has to angrily sweep Tom’s model train to the ground. Even Mr. Bacon’s gently lined face seems in retreat, as if his very skin and flesh had withdrawn. The overloaded story, written by Micky Levy, would challenge even a more practiced director. One afternoon, while running  his train from Los Angeles to Seattle, Tom slams into a car parked on the tracks. Inside is the body of a psychologically ravaged younwoman (Bonnie Root), who, in her insanity and desperation, has also tried to do away with her 11-year-old son, Davey (Miles Heizer, a newcomer and a real find). As the train bears down on the car, Davey escapes just in time. Unmoored and unloved, this lonely, sad and impressively resourceful boy makes his way to Tom and Megan’s house of illness and miscommunication. Only those who have never seen a movie need to be told what happens next. Despite the impossible setup and some unfortunate scripted clichés and miscalculations (two railroad men deliver a précis on the modern railway for our benefit alone), Ms. Eastwood does manage to tap into something honest and unexpectedly moving at times. She’s particularly good at handling the interplay between Mr. Bacon’s inhibited performance and Mr. Heizer’s periodically near-hysteric one. Her work with Ms. Harden satisfies less; the actress has her moments but she tends to hit her notes with excessive force, banging away too loudly for this otherwise quiet film. The whole thing improves greatly during its second half, after the story’s incredible coincidences have given way to Tom, Megan and Davey just living everyday, ordinary life, trying to find ways to fit together with kindness and with love. Family affairs are a tricky business, even behind the scenes. It may seem unfair to point this out, but Ms. Eastwood has done herself no favors by tapping some crucial members of the filmmaking team that works for her father, Clint Eastwood, which of course only invites scrutiny and comparison. “Rails & Ties” was shot by Tom Stern, the cinematographer for Mr. Eastwood’s last five films. Here, Mr. Stern keeps things simple and by and large bright, which is presumably what was asked of him, and affords no hint of his genius for chiaroscuro. Mr. Eastwood’s new production designer, James M. Murakami; one of his editors, Gary D. Roach; and his longtime costume designer, Deborah Hopper, also contributed to “Rails & Ties.” Their work serves Ms. Eastwood’s caution. Everything looks professional if undistinguished. “Rails & Ties” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Brief female nudity, adult language, death.

Reserved, careful and largely predictable in the way it plays out its wrenching emotional crises, "Rails & Ties" reps a capable but modest directorial debut by Alison Eastwood. The tale of a middle-aged husband and wife who work through a professional tragedy and a medical trauma when fate lands a young boy at their doorstep, the pic possesses some straightforward virtues, but is so discreet that its emotional payoff is delayed too long. High-profile fest bows may create unrealistic expectations for this unashamedly old-fashioned drama; this Warner Bros. release's target audience lies with heartland women rather than highbrows.
In almost every respect, Micky Levy's original script resembles a story that feels more rooted in the 1950s than today, especially as it regards several of the characters' deep-rooted love of trains, both real and model. This preoccupation proves quaintly appealing, but it also, along with the characters' emotional reticence, places the action in a vaguely unreal, abstract environment untouched by contempo culture.
Eastwood fille 
does a crisp, efficient job of setting the wheels in motion. Locomotive engineer Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) can't seem to wait to climb aboard and roll the Stargazer Express out of Los Angeles' Union Station up the coast to Seattle, despite having a wife, Megan (Marcia Gay Hardin), who's dying of cancer. As time will show, Tom is an emotionally stunted man/boy, unable to be of any true assistance to his ailing mate or to say the right things to her.
In equally bad shape is a younger lady who parks her car, with her young son inside, on a rail crossing in the Simi Valley as Tom's train is fast approaching. Against the instincts of his fellow engineer Otis (Eugene Byrd), who wants him to slam on the brakes, Tom follows regulations and only moderately slows down, resulting in a crash that kills the mother; the boy escapes just in time.
Insisting it was an obvious suicide, Tom is nonetheless suspended, pending a hearing. Now stuck at home with his sick wife, things go from bad to worse as Megan begins regretting her whole life and especially not having had kids. In her last stab at throwing off her constricted existence, she announces she's going to leave the uncommunicative Tom, and light out to San Francisco.
In a series of events that doesn't ring entirely true, the suddenly orphaned kid, Davey Danner (Miles Heizer), gets immediately tossed into a frightful foster home; there's not even a funeral for his mom. Escaping the foster home, the 9-year-old miraculously finds his way to Tom's house and, after accusing him of killing his mother, quickly changes his tune when he finds a new potential mother in Megan.
Anyone who at this point can't see where this is all headed is asleep at the switch. For a modern kid, Davey has an unusual fascination for Tom's expansive model train layout; the two have hours of fun playing with it. Tom knows it's wrong for the son of his victim to stay with them, but one little threat from Megan overrides him. For her part, Megan takes up piano and begins feeling ever-so-much better.
Megan has her periodic outbursts of misery and anger, but mostly the characters remain so bottled up you'd think they lived in Iowa in 1953. There's no indication of the Starks' past or what they might have shared in better days, and certainly little trace of intimacy between them. Dialogue consists so much of simplistic homilies and hollow expressions of what they think they should be saying that it's sometimes difficult to tell if it's meant to illuminate the banality of their existence or is simply banal.
And yet, there is a directness and lack of fuss about the film that impresses in its own way. The compositions are clean and well judged, the emotional lines are clear -- sometimes too much so -- and Eastwood's attraction to traditional, elemental story values could bode well for future ventures. What she needs is more confidence to bust out of the script's straightjacket to embellish the characters and detail their environment.
Thesps effectively hit the notes they play, but seem locked into fairly narrow conceptions of their characters -- Harden as the long-suffering wife needing an outlet for her feelings, Bacon as the immature man heading for a life change -- rather than being able to find a way of making them three-dimensional.
Given the fact that he's just lost his mother, the Davey character is too nice and cooperative by half; quite late on, however, he does crack, providing the film with a degree of the intensity and catharsis it's needed, and young Heizer does a nice job with this scene.
Production values are thoroughly pro for the small-scale venture, which looks fine but occasionally becomes mawkish due to the sometimes corny folk rock tunes on the soundtrack.

No doubt about it, Alison Eastwood  has picked up a thing or two from her old man. Her debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for placenone of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes that tie this hackneyed domestic drama together with fearsome symmetry. A child in need of parents, parents in need of a childwhat else is necessary to complicate the passage from A to B to redemption but suicide, cancer, and a difficult marriage? The acting is great, though it may be time for Kevin Bacon playing a train conductor faced with a difficult decision about the car parked in a fast-approaching crossingto take a break from the man-of-few-words thing. Marcia Gay Harden  is much too good for her role here as the afflicted wife who "doesn't want to relax, I want to live." (Clichés by Micky Levy, who cobbled them together after a train journey of her own.) Newcomer Miles Heizer is excellent as the forlorn lad, but there's no saving this mawkish talewhose best feature is its sense of railway life, and whose worst is its reduction of life's common hurts and losses to puppetry.
