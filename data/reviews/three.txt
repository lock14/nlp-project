Here's a conundrum: How does one make a Christian horror movie? Sure, it's possible to eliminate the drugs, nudity, and bad language so common in our popular entertainment � and maybe even some of the immoral behaviors. But doesn't the crux of a horror movie usually require some psycho baddie to disrupt the calm of normalcy? Is turning the other cheek a useful tactic to ward off unsavory malevolents and murderous nut jobs? Thr3e
, a Christian psychological horror thriller, wants to take on the challenge. This first release from Fox Faith, a new label under the auspices of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, seems to accept the fact that murderous mayhem is indeed a necessary aspect of the genre. Based on a novel by bestselling Christian author Ted Dekker, Thr3e
 almost gives away its mystery by virtue of its title. Yes, there's a psycho killer on the loose: This one is called RK, the Riddle Killer (Moseley). In the fashion of the extreme horror currently in vogue in movies such as the Saw
 continuum, RK seizes his victims, wires them with bombs, and taunts the rescuers with tautological riddles that need to be solved before the bomb detonates. In the action-packed prologue, RK blows up the brother of a cop (Waddell), who then becomes personally vested in the capture of this maniac. The next victim turns out to be Kevin Parson (Blucas), an aptly named seminary student. Flashbacks to Kevin's childhood are vague and bring up questions the film only answers in the end, and the same goes for his childhood pal Samantha (Jordan), who suddenly appears from nowhere. A visit to the home in which Kevin grew up under the care of his obviously deranged aunt (Barnes) and dingy, fez-wearing uncle (Bower) ought to set off cautionary alarms � but, no. It's situations such as these that make Thr3e
 such a frustrating exercise in diverted expectations. What initially seem to be examples of inept filmmaking (i.e., illogical actions, physical impossibilities, and a murky visual palette) turn out in the end to be tactics to forestall the revelation of the story's narrative conceit. Christians can ultimately go to this film and be safe from hearing swear words or seeing nudity. But will they take kindly to its dark, psychotic, and lethal manifestations? It's a sure bet the regular gore hounds will be disappointed by the film's transparencies, but will the faithful flock to a film that offers a lot more grit than the pallid stuff that generally passes for Christian entertainment? Ask Mel Gibson.


"Thr3e" is a genuine oddity, a psychological thriller aimed at Christian ticketbuyers -- and, not incidentally, heavily promoted through religious bookstores and radio stations -- that plays more or less like a blandly secular popcorn pic. Indeed, you could argue that weighty questions about the nature of evil and the allure of sin figured more prominently in the similarly titled "Se7en," one of several other, better suspensers dimly echoed here. It will take some kind of miracle to attract mainstream multitudes during the pic's limited rollout. But the faithful may be drawn by the source material, from bestselling Christian author Ted Dekker.
Trouble is, anyone unfamiliar with Dekker's tome will just have to take it on faith that the book is more involving and exciting than the generic farrago served by scripter Alan McElroy (who co-wrote the film of the post-Rapture adventure "Left Behind") and helmer Robby Henson.
The plot focuses on Kevin Parson (Marc Blucas), a twentysomething seminary student who's stalked by a mad bomber known as the Riddle Killer. For reasons only gradually revealed, the serial exploder targets Parson as his latest unwilling opponent in a sadistic cat-and-mouse game. The cruel sport involves menacing phone calls, voice-distortion technology -- yes, you can count "Saw" among the pic's other influences -- and, occasionally, very big bangs. 
The Riddle Killer (or, as he's referred to by cops and tabloid reporters, RK) demands that Parson "confess" some past transgression if the seminarian doesn't want a close friend, some total strangers and/or a beloved pet blown to bits. Even after Parson admits to a very, very bad thing, however, the calls keep coming, and the bombs keep detonating.
There's precious little in the way of clammy tension or mounting apprehension as "Thr3e" plods toward a climax that is startlingly absurd, yet not entirely illogical. Still, there is an undeniable novelty in having an anxious male protagonist require the help of not just one but two strong-willed, gun-toting women: Samantha (Laura Jordan), an insurance investigator who was Kevin's childhood sweetheart, and Jennifer (Justine Waddell), a police profiler who lost a brother during an earlier matchup with RK.
Most of the performances are understated and unremarkable. A glaring exception, for all the wrong reasons, is Priscilla Barnes' grotesquely twitchy, scenery-chomping turn as Kevin's self-dramatizing aunt. Production values are on a par with an early-1990s vidpic, with locations in Lodz, Poland, adequately doubling for some anonymous North American metropolis.
It's worth noting that at least one plot point -- a character is revealed to have been psychologically scarred, and perhaps sexually molested, while being home-schooled -- may offend some members of the pic's presumptive target aud. 


What happens when a thriller finds Jesus? It's bye-bye, blood and boobs. Thr3e , written by Left Behind er Alan B. McElroy , based on a Ted Dekker  novel, and debuting as the first theatrical release from Fox's new Christian-friendly imprint Fox Faith, is on its dull surface the mystery of a psychopath/serial killer and his seminary-student preywith God replacing gore. There are no dead bodies here, but perhaps filmgoers, tired of all those secular scares and heathen horrors, won't miss the aesthetic pleasure of a creative murder scene. Still, Marc Blucas  as the hunted seminary student Kevin Parson  might as well be dead for all his charisma, even with a backstory involving deceased parents and an unhinged, abusive Aunt Belinda (Priscilla Barnes , formerly Thr3e's Company 's blonde no. 3 and currently looking like Courtney Love  after a thr3e-week bender). Of course, Fox Faith wouldn't want you to trust our  judgment; as the movie reminds us in its tidy moral, "We need the power of God to teach us good and evil." That awesome power has co-opted pop music and cornered the market on swearing-in ceremonies. Can't we at least have our cookie-cutter thrillers?
