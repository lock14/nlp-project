 The deliciously twisted world of Claude Chabrol turns on a different axis from our own, though a closer look always suggests discomfiting similarities. In “The Bridesmaid,” the latest of his works to be released in the United States, Mr. Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving — perhaps as a consequence of his age (76), perhaps in deference to the contributions of his son, the film’s composer, Matthieu Chabrol, and of his wife, Aurore Chabrol, its script supervisor.  Whatever the case, “The Bridesmaid” certainly presents a looser, more relaxed Mr. Chabrol, in both intellectual and formal terms, than do midcareer masterworks like “Les Biches” and later successes like “La Cérémonie.” Once again, there are a family and a crime, as well as the crime that is the family,  one whose pathology is suggested by smiles and eyes that always seem a bit too bright, and by the fantastically ugly flowered wallpaper that covers much of their home like funeral wreaths.  When the film opens, the two daughters, Sophie and Patricia (Solène Bouton and Anna Mihalcea), are parked in front of a television, soaking up a local tragedy and engaging in a familiar spectator sport: the misery of others.  The mystery of empathy pervades Mr. Chabrol’s work, which is full of sociopaths, some charming, others not. One of the least appealing is surely Senta (Laura Smet), the femme fatale with cat’s eyes who, after meeting him at a wedding, sweeps Sophie and Patricia’s older brother, Philippe (Benoît Magimel), off his feet. A mama’s boy who looks to be in his late 20’s, Philippe has a steady job and the trust of his employer, selling bathroom fixtures principally, it seems, to lonely older women. If he appears especially well suited to these demanding clients, it may be because he still lives at home with his doting mother, Christine (Aurore Clément), a tremulous blonde with animal-print coordinates and what in an American film might be called boundary issues.  Filmmakers often run from unlovable and unlikable characters, or, if they’re American, seek a cure or a punishment for souls so afflicted. Mr. Chabrol has never bowed to the notion that characters must be likable (or, in the vulgar parlance of Hollywood, someone you can root for), knowing full well that all they need be is worthy of our attention. It’s no accident that the only truly appealing character in “The Bridesmaid” is a foulmouthed derelict (Michel Duchaussoy), who burrows into a pile of rubbish parked on Senta’s property. You may not root for this tramp, but you may appreciate his earthy laugh and symbolic importance, particularly in light of both the bourgeois and bohemian worlds from which he’s so pointedly excluded.  The tramp figures in the murder that eventually figures in the story and that plays almost as an afterthought. Written by Mr. Chabrol and Pierre Leccia, and based on the novel of the same title by Ruth Rendell, the film has a vague narrative thrust that is itself a red herring. You wait for something to happen, not necessarily realizing that the most important thing is happening in front of you, in the family members’ exchanges with one another and, significantly, in Philippe’s fixation on a stone bust that looks somewhat like his mother, somewhat like his lover, and that once had pride of place in the family yard. (It’s hard to say which is chillier here, a stone that looks like a woman or a woman with a stone-cold heart.)  Although the bust seems like a fetish object, it’s more representative of Philippe’s fossilized humanity than an emblem of sexual perversion. In many respects, Philippe, his sisters and his mother, each of whom presents a smiling front to the world, are not all that different from their beloved stone bust. It’s no wonder that Philippe lavishes the bust with kisses, stroking its smoothly carved cheeks much as he strokes Senta’s curved body. And no wonder, too, that when the worst happens in this deceptively understated and finally ferocious film, Philippe seems to shatter into a thousand pieces, much like a stone dropped from a very great height, much like a man whose mask has finally and irrevocably been forced from his face.

When the master of French thrillers Claude Chabrol meets the mistress of English suspense fiction Ruth Rendell, the result is a potent if very classic blend. "The Bridesmaid" is pleasing precisely for the way it expertly follows genre rules in its story of a young femme fatale who demands ultimate proof of love. At 74, Chabrol is in full possession of his talent for elegant, understated filmmaking, though he's far from his disturbing films of the '50s and '60s. Current pic, as satisfying as a latenight read in bed, should have little trouble finding an audience with suitable handling.
In a quiet French town only slightly rocked by the news of a missing girl, Philippe (Benoit Magimel) lives with his attractive hairdresser mother Christine (Aurore Clement) and his two younger sisters. One night, Christine introduces her offspring to Gerard (Bernard le Coq), a businessman who has been courting her, and asks their permission to give him the sculpted head of a woman in their garden as a present. They reluctantly agree.
Gerard, however, disappears from Christine's life and Philippe retrieves the sculpture in secret. He hides it in his closet and develops a strange attachment to it; not long after, at his sister's wedding, he meets her bridesmaid Senta (Laura Smet) who bears an eerie resemblance to the statue. She seduces him during a thunderstorm and the die is cast for an unpredictable, dangerous relationship.
Senta, a model and wannabe actress, lives in the basement of a huge house her father left her. Rather humorously, Philippe tries to juggle his sultry girlfriend and exciting new sex life with a steady job and family propriety. But the girl's true nature remains shrouded in mystery, creating a low-level tension that hovers unnervingly in the background of the film.
When she asks Philippe to murder a stranger to prove his love for her, he doesn't take her seriously. Things precipitate in the following scenes, and the conclusion, while far from a surprise or great psychological revelation, offers a satisfying last twist.
The pseudo-anonymous Magimel astutely uses his clean good looks to fill the shoes of the hard-working young career man whose secret inner urges derail his normal life. Smet doesn't go far beyond casting smoldering looks for a character who could have used more depth. As the jilted mother of the bride, Clement catches a nicely modern equilibrium between maternal and feminine.
Excellent tech work also follows the classic beat to create a rich atmosphere around commonplace events. Eduardo Serra's cinematography bathes the town in night shadows, while editor Monique Fardoulis gradually raises the tension until film's final revelation. Matthieu Chabrol's mystery music is discreet and well-dosed.

Given his doggedly consistent fascination with psychopathic crime intersecting with bourgeois lives, it's a surprise to find that The Bridesmaid is only Claude Chabrol 's second adaptation of a Ruth Rendell  novel (after La Cérémonie). It is, in any case, a psychodrama of typically brisk efficiency and relaxed gallows humor. The semi-functioning family at the center is sketched inresponsible son (with incestuous lurkings) Benoît Magimel , high-spirited single mom Aurore Clément , bickering sistersbefore we meet the titular catalyst at a family wedding: Senta (Laura Smet ), a sensuous but off-putting seductress with a mysterious past. Magimel is all pro, deciphering life with his eyes, as the chump who gets vacuumed in by this odd girl's impulsive devotions and Nietzschean delusions, but Smet, all eyelashes and butterscotch skin, is the film's prize; she doesn't act out the character's slowly revealed pathologies so much as keep them barely contained behind her mesmerizing stare, like mad dogs in a cage. Chabrol sets us up, of course, which is half the fun, and the experience is a delight for lack of pomposity (his visual storytelling remains no-nonsense) as well as genre expertise.
