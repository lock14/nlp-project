         About halfway through Todd Field's deeply resonant "Little Children," adulterous suburban lovers Sarah and Brad (Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson) indulge in something really naughty: They join in a moment of mass moral panic and righteous ostracism at the community pool. The cheerful chaos has just been obliterated by the discovery that the goggled and flippered town pervert, Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), has slipped into the water among the kids. Sarah spots him first, then awareness sweeps over the crowd like a wave. Parents rush poolside, children scramble out of the water or get plucked out by the armpits, babies start to wail. It's as if the shark from "Jaws" had finally found a way to justify decades of collective primal fear. Wrapping their arms around their kids, Sarah and Brad instinctively join the crowd. They may be guilty, but McGorvey, mercifully for them, is guilty of much worse.
 
  For a nearly wordless sequence, the pervert-in-the-pool scene is astonishingly complex, not to mention brave, and it's indicative of the wicked insight and emotional subtlety at play in Field's lucid and sensitive film. The movie begins as a satire, rolling inexorably forward — like the meatball in the camp song — building steam, mass and weight until it completely obliterates every bogus piety in its path. What's revealed in its wake is an empathetic, humanistic vision that rejects, even in difficult, extreme cases, the mob impulse to demonize.
 


         






    The story of an illicit love affair that coincides with a presumed pedophile's move to town, "Little Children" is based on a book by Tom Perrotta, who wrote the novel "Election" (Alexander Payne's film was later based on it). Field, whose last film was "In the Bedroom," co-wrote the movie with Perrotta, with whom he obviously shares an interest in hermetic environments and a fascination with what happens when their familiar dynamics are disturbed by outside or deviant forces. But "Little Children" is one of those rare films that transcends its source material. Firmly rooted in the present and in our current frame of mind — a time and frame of mind that few artists have shown interest in really exploring — the movie is one of the few films I can think of that examines the baffling combination of smugness, self-abnegation, ceremonial deference and status anxiety that characterizes middle-class Gen X parenting, and find sheer, white-knuckled terror at its core.
 
  The title is far more inclusive than it seems at first. Sarah and Brad are misfits in their town, where the norm is so rigidly but tacitly enforced that even the slightest deviance raises eyebrows and hackles. The two meet one morning at the playground frequented by a cadre of regimental stay-at-home moms ruled by queen bee Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann). Mary Ann's approach to child-rearing combines a militarism, adherence to protocol and self-satisfaction not seen since "The King and I," and while Sarah tries to conform to the strict rules of snack times and play-dates, she can't manage to subsume herself to the degree required by her cohorts. Her feelings of rebellion and inadequacy are exacerbated by the fact that conformity is couched in a false broad-mindedness and empathy, making it insidious, alienating and cruel.
 
  If Sarah is a threat to the moms' conformity, the mysterious house-husband Brad is a threat to their complacency. Male, beautiful to the point of inciting panic (the ladies call him "the prom king") and apparently unemployed, he's an erotic apparition in the playground, not to mention an apparently discomfiting reminder of a stage in life when sex was its own justification and reward, instead of another task to be scheduled. Sarah, who is unhappily married to a much older man named Richard (Gregg Edelman), a remote and tedious branding consultant with a secret porn fetish, gets through the days pretending to be "an anthropologist studying the behavior of suburban women," not as a suburban woman herself. Her attraction to Brad, therefore, is not only impulsive and romantic, it's intrinsic to her sense of who she is — or was. Among other things, a former PhD candidate in literature. (She never finished her thesis.)
 
  Brad's attraction to Sarah has more to do with what she sees in him than what he sees in her, as well as with her willingness to inhabit a world outside of their reality. She's not as beautiful as his wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), but she demands nothing. While Kathy waits impatiently for Brad to pass the bar (which he's failed twice), Sarah is happy to live with him in the past, clinging to the idea that they are hovering in the pleasant limbo of unrealized potential, cheering madly in the otherwise deserted bleachers at night football games in which a bunch of cops play a bunch of accountants. When he's not taking care of his son, playing football or watching teenagers skateboard at the high school when he's supposed to be studying for the bar, Brad spends evenings riding around town in his new friend Larry Hedges' (Noah Emmerich) van. Larry, who befriends Brad one night during his "rounds," warning the town of McGorvey's presence in their midst, is Mary Ann's male counterpart. A former cop who took early retirement under troubling circumstances, he now dedicates his time to persecuting McGorvey and his mother, May (Phyllis Somerville). Haley and Somerville are remarkable as "mommy" and damaged son, creating a rapport astonishingly layered with disappointment, resignation and wary hope.
 
  "Have you ever thought about the term 'homeland security'? I mean really thought about it?" Larry asks Brad one night. Brad doesn't say, but the question lingers. Security weighs heavily on all the characters, but the more they grasp at it, the more damage they do to themselves and others. May's deep inner strength exists in sharp contrast to Larry's bullying, which masks a bottomless well of self-loathing and fear. Obsessed with "the family," "the community" and, of course, "the children," Larry causes nothing but harm.
 
  It's the same poisonous certitude that causes Mary Ann to take the opportunity, during another memorable scene at a book club, to tell Sarah what she thinks of her by calling the unhappily married and unfaithful fictional character Emma Bovary "selfish" and "a slut." Sarah delivers a defense of the individual versus the crowd that is rousing, moving and all the more touching for the fact that she, like Madame Bovary, is neglecting her child. While Sarah and Brad's standard adulterer's guilt is painfully heightened by the aggressively virtuous cult-of-the-child that stifles their pretty suburban town, the movie's actual kids are not so much characters as they are tiny loci of anxiety, resentment and redirected ambition. In fact, the only child in the story who is loved reciprocally and without reservation is McGorvey. His mother is a firecracker with no illusions about her son and only the most modest expectations, which he will probably not meet. Strangely, she adores him anyway.

When did words like adult , child , suburban , and playground  lose their neutrality  their innocence? When did the Pedophile Menace Alert get raised to red in this country so proud of its hazard-free swing sets and juice boxes? Little Children , a jolting, artfully made drama set in and around a suburban playground somewhere between American Beauty  and In the Bedroom  on America's psychic highway, is populated by parents who are surprised by adulthood and children who are treated like projects built by competitive students of What to Expect...  books.
The trouble  satiric and dead-serious in turn  begins when two of those adults are shaken out of their own childlike stupors one day by dangerous grown-up desire: Sarah (Kate Winslet), the restless mother of a little girl and wife of a man (Gregg Edelman) lost in work and Internet porn (the latter's a misplaced satiric touch), meets Brad (Patrick Wilson), the passive, handsome father of a little boy and stay-at-home husband of an alpha-female documentary filmmaker (Jennifer Connelly).
What begins as an idle hug  a playground dare, really, to shock some gossipy mothers  becomes something first emotionally important, and then sexually urgent, even torrid. The coupling on screen is hungry and exposed, something with which only an actress as honest and confident as Winslet can be entrusted, and to which Wilson responds with vigor. The two make a riveting, attractive couple of unhappy lovers who, unlike the cartoon cavorters in Desperate Housewives , have no intention of messing up their nests, and then do so; it is no accident that Sarah joins a book-group discussion of Madame Bovary , or that Todd Field directs with the same sensitivity to male and female failings he brought to In the Bedroom .
Almost all the parents, meanwhile, remain pathetically immature in their lack of psychological self-awareness, a condition Field alludes to with just the faintest raising of an eyebrow and some judiciously applied third-person narration. (Will Lyman, the stentorian voice of so many Frontline  documentaries, provides a cool tone of sociological detachment.) And that middle-class naïveté is brought into even sharper focus by the introduction of Ronnie (All the King's Men 's Jackie Earle Haley, whose very skull conveys depravity), a pedophile who did time for indecent exposure and now lives nearby with his own aging mommy (Phyllis Somerville).
As Tom Perrotta makes clear in the 2004 novel on which he and Field based their fine screenplay, the parents in Little Children  can't recognize need in themselves or their kids. But they think they're experts when it comes to Ronnie, urging constant monitoring and even further punishment at the slightest opportunity  a calling to which one overwound ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) responds with zeal. Who are the little children in this dark tragicomedy? It depends on how broadly you define the neutral word playground .

 Correction Appended  “Little Children,” Todd Field’s superb film adaptation of the novel by Tom Perrotta, begins in a clean and leafy suburban playground, where toddlers cavort under the watchful, benevolent gazes of their pretty young mothers. This may strike you as a rare tableau of innocence in a hectic world, unless, that is, you have spent time in such a place. For the playground really is a scene of primordial brutality, in which a few agreed-upon rules — play nice, share your toys, no hitting — barely suppress the essential savagery of the human species.  I’m not talking about the kids; they’re perfectly sweet. “Little Children,” its title notwithstanding, is a rigorous study of adult behavior, and the first playground scene, introduced by an unseen narrator whose smooth, authoritative voice is familiar from luxury-car commercials, sets a tone that is both compassionate and severe.  It can be observed that the chorus of viciously competitive moms, who reappear now and then throughout the movie to pass judgment and enforce social norms, amounts to a caricature, tinged with snobbery and misogyny. True enough, but those mean mothers nonetheless offer a glimpse into the larger reality that is one of the film’s main areas of inquiry, as it was the novel’s: the empty, invidious, anxious feelings that accompany material and domestic fulfillment.  Set in a Massachusetts suburb with many scenes filmed on location in New York, “Little Children,” which will be shown this weekend at the New York Film Festival before opening in New York and Los Angeles next Friday, balances tenderness with satire. It takes seriously the complaints of people whose lives are, by any objective historical measure, almost impossibly privileged (though they would no doubt describe themselves as middle class). But the movie, which Mr. Field and Mr. Perrotta wrote together, does not, in the manner of other, more facile examinations of suburban dysfunction (like “American Beauty”) assume that it or its audience is better than its characters. The combination of self-regard and anxiety that the characters display makes such judgment superfluous in any case.  Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet), sitting in that maternal playground klatch, insists to herself (in the narrator’s voice, an unsettling and effective touch) that while she may be in this world, she is not of it: “a researcher studying the behavior of typical suburban women, not a typical suburban woman.” Sarah has been to graduate school, and though she never received a doctorate, she did acquire the habit of living within the protective quotation marks that the postmodern academy hands out in addition to (and sometimes in lieu of) substantive knowledge.    Her bouts of parental ineptness — forgetting to bring a snack to the park for her daughter, Lucy, for example — are both humiliating and self-aggrandizing. Sarah’s sloppiness is a sign, to herself and the others, that she is too fine a creature to be bothered with the trivia of parenthood. Ms. Winslet, as fine an actress as any working in movies today, registers every flicker of Sarah’s pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern that amounts, by the end of the movie, to something like love.  That Ms. Winslet is so lovable makes the deficit of love in Sarah’s life all the more painful. She is married to an older man named Richard (Gregg Edelman), whose profession is marketing and whose vocation is masturbating to Internet pornography, pursuits that leave him with little time for his family. Sarah, suffering from a vague but nonetheless acute malaise, treats it with the traditional literary prescription of adultery, embarking on an affair with Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the only weekday dad at the playground, a handsome former athlete known to the chattering moms as “the Prom King.”  Their first kiss is a joke meant to shock the other moms, but it shocks Brad and Sarah as well, and their discomfort signals that we are not in the swinging suburbia of novels like “Couples” or “The Ice Storm,” but rather in a milieu in which marital infidelity carries the dangerous, thrilling charge of genuine transgression. It comes as no surprise, then, that when Sarah joins a book club the text under discussion is “Madame Bovary.” Nor is it surprising that she identifies with Flaubert’s heroine, who suffered so memorably from the stultification of a provincial marriage that she became a French verb.  In 21st-century America, though, it is not only women who Bovarize; Brad too is bored and adrift. He is married to Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a documentary filmmaker, and has an easy rapport with their son, Aaron, whom Brad cares for while Kathy is at work. But even if society, in principle, smiles on stay-at-home dads, in practice matters are more complicated.  Aaron still favors his mother, and Brad, who has failed the bar exam twice, is under pressure to climb back on the professional treadmill. He joins a nighttime touch-football league to recapture the vanished athletic glory of his youth, and also to shore up his eroded sense of manhood.  Mr. Wilson’s most striking characteristic in his film roles so far (notably in “The Phantom of the Opera” and “Angels in America”) has been an appealing blankness, which he and Mr. Field have the wit to acknowledge and to subvert. Brad is so obviously blessed by nature and circumstances that he seems, to the playground moms and also in some ways to Sarah, almost unreal, which has the effect of increasing his isolation.  How could anyone feel sorry for this guy, or believe that his inner life was speckled with unhappiness, or even imagine that he has an inner life? You feel sympathy for Brad precisely because it’s impossible to feel truly sorry for him.  Brad and Sarah spend sun-kissed days together at the public swimming pool, their children providing camouflage and, at nap time, the chance for a daily hour or so of sexual bliss. Antonio Calvache, the director of photography, gives the daylight a soft, golden quality that is flattering to Ms. Winslet (whose body the narrator describes as “boyish,” thus demonstrating the limits of his omniscience) and that combines with Mr. Field’s leisurely takes and off-center close-ups to produce a gentle, pastoral rhythm. When night falls, though, that same deliberate pace becomes more sinister, as the town discloses its darker side.  A pedophile named Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) has been released from prison into his mother’s custody, an event that sets his fellow citizens on edge and that provides the film with a sad, creepy second plot to counterpoint the tale of Brad and Sarah. One of Brad’s teammates, Larry (Noah Emmerich) is obsessed with Ronnie, and sets about harassing the man in the name of public safety: staking out his house, papering tree trunks and lampposts with fliers, banging on his door in the middle of the night.  Larry and Ronnie are, in an odd way, as deeply connected as Brad and Sarah: they are symbols of failure, frustration and the ineradicable consequences of what earlier Massachusetts townspeople would not have hesitated to call sin. Mr. Haley’s performance, haunting and disturbing, is sure to help resurrect his career, and Mr. Emmerich’s is equally impressive. Both actors take thoroughly unsympathetic characters and, without sentimentalizing them or softening their edges, make them into human beings.  Mr. Field, with his second feature — his directing debut was “In the Bedroom” — proves to be among the most literary of American filmmakers, one of the few who tries to find a visual language suited to the ambiguous plainness of contemporary realist fiction. He and Mr. Perrotta have wisely trimmed and modified the book, excising some of its harsher gothic notes and its wilder comic flights. The result is a movie that is challenging, accessible and hard to stop thinking about.  At one point Brad tells Sarah that beauty is overrated, something that, as the narrator notes, only someone secure in his own beauty would say. He may nonetheless be right. But in too many recent movies intelligence is woefully undervalued, and it is this quality — even more than its considerable beauty — that distinguishes “Little Children” from its peers.  “Little Children” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing, strong sexual content and one scene of gruesome violence.  LITTLE CHILDREN  Plays tomorrow and Sunday at the New York Film Festival; opens in New York and Los Angeles  on Oct. 6.

Running time: 137 minutes. Showing tomorrow at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, as part of the 44th New York Film Festival.  WITH: Kate Winslet (Sarah Pierce), Patrick Wilson (Brad Adamson), Jennifer Connelly (Kathy Adamson), Gregg Edelman (Richard Pierce), Noah Emmerich (Larry Hedges), Jackie Earle Haley (Ronald James McGorvey), Phyllis Somerville (May McGorvey), Ty Simpkins (Aaron Adamson) and Sadie Goldstein (Lucy Pierce).   Correction: Oct. 25, 2006 A film review in Weekend on Sept. 29 about “Little Children” referred incorrectly to the filming of its scenes. Many were shot on location in New York; it was not filmed “mainly on studio sets.” (The story itself is set in a Massachusetts suburb.) 

Displaying many of the same qualities that distinguished Todd Field's debut feature, "In the Bedroom," "Little Children" is a deftly made, emotionally acute and at times a tad fastidious examination of cracks in middle-class American family life. Adroitly adapted from Tom Perrotta's fine and popular 2004 novel with every literary reference neatly in place, this New Line release about an affair between a married man and woman in a community troubled by the return of an unwelcome neighbor will tie many viewers, particularly women, up in knots, and should follow in the critically and commercially successful footsteps of its director's previous picture.
Literary feel is established at the outset by the dry, oh-so-faintly superior tone of the narration (commentary's faintly "Barry Lyndon"-ish quality shows it's not for nothing that Field acted for Stanley Kubrick and now employs as associate producer longtime Kubrick colleague Leon Vitali). What at first seems an apparent narrative crutch increases in amusement with abundance, to the point that it's missed when dropped through the long midsection.
Dramatic attention alights upon four women watching their young children at a playground, three nattering types and one outsider, Sarah (Kate Winslet), a more pensive observer with little patience for extended discussion of toddler issues. The three cackling hens go into a dither at the arrival of a long-absent young father so dreamy they've dubbed him the Prom King. They've never dared speak to him as he's played with his little son, so Sarah delights in betting she can get his phone number. Instead, in a beautifully played scene that locks the viewer into the protags' story, they have a delicate, probing chat which ends with them briefly kissing in front of the children and other women.
There's no doubt where this is going, but it takes a while getting there. Through the hot summer, Sarah and the clean-cut jock (Patrick Wilson) whose name is Brad (changed from Todd in the book, perhaps by a director uncomfortable with too many Todds around) meet with their respective kids amid hundreds of other similar folk at the large community pool. Gradually, their dissatisfaction with their superficially contented lives seep to the surface. Sarah has a master's degree in English lit and never imagined herself as a suburban mom married to a successful businessman (Gregg Edelman), especially one she's just walked in on pleasuring himself to the Slutty Kay Web site with a pair of panties adorning his face like a gas mask.
Brad, married to a striking PBS documentary filmmaker, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), is unenthusiastically anticipating taking the bar exam for the third time; when he's supposedly studying nights at the library, he's instead hanging with skateboarders or practicing for the police football team with his ex-cop buddy Larry (Noah Emmerich).
Another guy with too much downtime, Larry with boorish zeal leads the local protest against the return home of a convicted sex offender, Ronald James McGorvey. Latter is very effectively played by Jackie Earle Haley, a teen standout in "The Bad News Bears" and "Breaking Away" absent from the bigscreen for 23 years; he's also in the upcoming "All the King's Men." A creepy, ferrety-looking man, McGorvey freaks out the moms one day by jumping in among the kids at the public pool.
Principal attention naturally remains on the central couple, who 55 minutes in begin coupling in sweaty but, at least for the viewer, unerotic frenzies during the day when their spouses are away and their kids are napping. All goes well until the two unadvisedly decide to dine together with their respective spouses, when a slip of the tongue confirms Kathy's suspicions.
Still, the pic spends an unexpected amount of time with ex-con Ronald, whose doting mother (the wonderful Phyllis Somerville) encourages him to date again. This leads to a startlingly tender, if ultimately dismaying, dinner scene between Ronald and the emotionally damaged Sheila (Jane Adams, terrific), and Ronald's path eventually comes to cross those of the other characters in a way that will have most mothers in the audience cringing.
Like "In the Bedroom," "Little Children," at well over two hours, is somewhat long for an intense, intimate drama, and arguments could run many ways concerning what could be tightened or excised. More than one TV newscast goes on at length, a docu interview Kathy conducts with the son of an Iraq war casualty seems notably dragged in, the football sessions are indulged and a women's book club meeting devoted to "Madame Bovary" requires Sarah to address the issue of adultery in an almost absurdly on-point manner. At the same time, it could legitimately be said that all these scenes are good, and enrich the overall texture of the film.
Although Sarah is a conflicted, contemplative woman, she's not particularly hard to read, meaning she's not the most fascinating character Winslet has played of late. Appealing but glammed down to suit her domestic domain, the thesp anchors the film with a strong, intelligent performance. Wilson fills the bill as the handsome Peter Pan who has yet to grapple with the challenge of supporting a family, although the character could have used a hint of an edgy undercurrent or the suggestion of anxiety about his future.
Respective spouses are somewhat shortchanged, as one never learns what makes Connelly's Kathy tick and Edelman as Sarah's husband completely disappears for long stretches, to the point where one mistakenly imagines he's been banished by his wife. One curious detail is Brad's complaint that Sarah's eyebrows are thicker than he likes, when Connelly, as his supposed physical ideal, has the thickest eyebrows of any woman around.
Pic's craftsmanship reps a step forward from "In the Bedroom," with Antonio Calvache's lensing and David Gropman's production design helping create a comfy everyday feel just waiting to be infected by the untoward actions of the characters. Tale is specifically set in East Wyndam, Mass., but was filmed in New York.

Little Children , a second excursion into middle-class unease by Todd Field  after his intelligent but overrated In the Bedroom,  opens with a slow pan around a living room whose shelves are crowded with cheap china figurines of . . . little children. Twisted into insidious grins, their blood-red lips ooze a comic horror that will seep into the lives of the film's real kids, who are alternately overprotected and neglected by hapless parentsmore precisely, mothers. The movie unfolds at a leisurely pace in the parks, pools, and leafy homes of a commuter town in Massachusetts, an idyllic suburb where people come to bury their dreams, and in so doing warp them into nightmares. Though there's a strong case to be made for the city as the new hub of puritan living, where people do little but overwork, overconsume, and flop into bed at 9:30 p.m., suburbia continues to serve as the dartboard of choice for filmmakers bent on demonstrating their urbane superiority to the dull denizens of tract housing.
For all its surface spit and polish, Little Children  is no different. It posits a town full of hypocrites busily persecuting their local child molester (a compellingly creepy Jackie Earle Haley , who plays an equally slimy bastard in All the King's Men ) so as not to face up to their own subterranean secrets and desires. Behind the happy family facade are husbands and fathers who wear panties on their heads while jerking off to computer porn and fail to satisfy their desperate housewives in the sack. Though there's genuine affection for the movie's wise, spunky old dames, Little Children  is downright vicious toward its stay-at-home moms, ciphers who sit all day in the park, tut-tutting over snack protocol or giggling like virgins when a handsome dad shows up. Chafing against this furtively unsavory group are Sarah (Kate Winslet ) and Brad (Patrick Wilson ), two unfulfilled young parents unhappily married to other people. After a blissful summer lounging at the public pool, they find themselves coupling sweatily in her laundry room on a regular basisuntil Brad's scarily competent wife (Jennifer Connelly ) smells a rat.
Adapted by Field and Tom Perrotta  from the novel by Perrotta (who also wrote the satire that became Alexander Payne 's Election ), Little Children  divides its time evenly between melodrama and black comedy, uneasy bedfellows under most conditions but especially in a movie that solicits sympathy for its wounded souls. Where Perrotta is a born satirist, Field works most comfortably within the frame of earnest realist dramas. A former actor himself, he draws uniformly smooth performances from an unwieldy ensemble. Winslet, her ripe beauty bursting out of sensible dungarees and cardigans, makes us see how Sarah, an Eng. Lit. graduate student until she threw it all over for life in hell, could fall for a chronically underachieving doofus like Brad. But this overly long movie, made sluggish by a superfluously novelistic narrator, feels divided against itself, driven by opposed impulses of tragedy and dark humor that make it impossible for us to identify with these lost souls' break for freedom or wait for them to grow up.
And so the illicit affair drags on and on, and you can see Madame Bovary , that indispensable helpmeet of every unhappily married lass, coming around the corner. Sure enough, she shows up as the hot read at a women's book group where Sarah defends the freedom to choose a satisfying life against a young matron (played with delicious snarkiness by Mary B. McCann ) who's appalled at the very idea of an adulterous heroine. Having made its pitch for life, liberty, and the pursuit of romantic happiness, Little Children  takes a sudden left turn, gathers itself into a moue of petit bourgeois disapproval, and deals out the wages of sin with such zealous overkill, it put me in mind of the nuttily discordant murder that derailed the final scenes of In the Bedroom . Freud himself would have found the unmanning of the movie's most damaged "little child" a tad literal-minded.
