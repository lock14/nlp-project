The kvetches of regulars at a cheery Beirut beauty salon couldn't be more familiar  and that's the slender charm of Caramel , a Lebanese variation on sweetly soapy dramas about Women Who Bond With Wet Hair. Among the femme woes: One lady's got a married lover; another a fear of aging; a third a crazy sister. Then again, as Steel Magnolias ' bride-to-be, Julia Roberts never had to deal with a stumper like considering a surgical ''restoration'' of her virginity before marriage to her Muslim fiancé.

 The Beirut beauty salon where most of “Caramel” takes place is likely to be a familiar type of establishment, even to viewers who have never been to the Lebanese capital. What the shop lacks in sleekness and chic it makes up for in the kind of friendly, sisterly warmth that could be found, for instance, in “Beauty Shop,” the distaff installation in the “Barbershop” franchise.  Women of various shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds gather to bond and gossip. Their camaraderie is occasionally disrupted by a crisis, but you are likely to remember this charming film, directed by Nadine Labaki, less for its gently comic, mildly melodramatic plot than for its friendly and inviting atmosphere.  Ms. Labaki, who also wrote the screenplay with Jihad Hojeily and Rodney Al Haddad, plays Layale, owner of the shop, which is called Si Belle. Like many unmarried women in the Middle East, Layale, in spite of her professional independence, lives with her parents. She is also having an affair with a married man and spends anxious hours waiting for him to call, ignoring the attentions of a handsome traffic policeman who is obviously smitten with her.  Layale’s friends and co-workers are supportive and tolerant of her, and also have troubles of their own. Jamale (Gisèle Aouad) is a recently divorced actress made frantic by the necessity of competing with younger women for work in television commercials. Nisrine (Yasmine Al Masri), a Muslim, is engaged and is worried about what will happen if her future husband discovers that she isn’t a virgin. Rima (Joanna Moukarzel), who cleans up around the shop and washes hair, develops a crush on an elegant client. And then there is Aunt Rose (Siham Haddad), a seamstress who lives down the street from Layale’s shop with her demanding, mentally disabled sister, Lili (Aziza Semaan).  It all has the makings of a mild soap opera, or perhaps a Pedro Almodóvar film without camp or kinkiness. And Ms. Labaki is less interested in breaking new ground than in providing her audience the kind of comfort and catharsis that her characters give one another. Which is not to say that “Caramel” is overly soft or sweet.  The title refers to a hot-sugar concoction that, while edible, is mainly used, like wax, for hair removal. Lovely and smooth as Ms. Labaki’s film (and her cast) may be, there are also twinges of real pain and disappointment.  “Caramel” has an optimism born not of dreamy romanticism but of resilience and a degree of hard-headedness. Life for these women is not easy or especially fair, and each of them faces moments of humiliation, loneliness and potential heartbreak. But in the best melodramatic tradition, their toughness, good humor and loyalty see them through. Those qualities, and Ms. Labaki’s evident affection for the battered panache of her native city, make “Caramel” hard to resist.  “Caramel” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild sexual references.

As the name suggests, "Caramel" is a sweet affair, hiding any bitter undertones under a sprightly, glistening exterior. Fresh from commercials and musicvids, novice helmer (and star) Nadine Labaki gathers five women around a Beirut beauty salon to address a range of issues facing Lebanese women -- from extramarital affairs to religious dictates. Low on calories and not especially original but always diverting, pic should do great biz at home, though France may be its only Western market.
Layale (Labaki) is at the tail end of an affair, her breaking heart supported by salon colleagues Nisrine (Yasmine Al Masri) and Rima (Joanna Moukarzel). Latter is awakening to lesbian desires, while Nisrine opts for minor surgery before her wedding so it appears she's still a virgin. Client Jamale (Gisele Aouad) can't face aging and seamstress Rose (Sihame Haddad) wants to accept love but her elderly, half-crazy sister Lili (Aziza Semaan) needs constant attention. Helmer lightly addresses problems of hypocrisy in both Christian and Muslim communities, emphasizing a common female bond beyond beauty treatments. Labaki extracts surprisingly fine, natural perfs from non-pros, often bathed in a golden light in keeping with the title.

The multiply blessed young Lebanese writer-director Nadine Labaki  looks sublimely like Anna Magnani  crossed with Penelope Cruz . She also has the brass and the chops not only to direct her first film but star in it as well, as a Beirut  beautician stewing miserably in a dead-end affair with a married man while, all around her, a multigenerational bevy of colleagues and clients copes with lesbian urges, menopause, and senior dating in a society hostile to all three. Beauty-parlor romantic comedy has been done to death and beyond, but what Caramel  lacks in originality is redeemed by its exuberant sensuality and astute commentary on the way Lebanese women sit uncomfortably in the crosshairs of their countrys clash between patriarchal tradition and Westernized modernity. Labaki shows an assured hand with her mostly non-pro actors, most of whom were cast for the resemblance between their lives and the women they play. Theres more cheek than chic in this Frenchified bit of fluff, but also something deeper and more poignant about its dilemmas, which include a Muslim bride-to-be agonizing over whether to get her broken hymen restitched by a plastic surgeon in time for her wedding. Labaki treats her characters with wistful tenderness, raucous practicality, and enough romantic chutzpah to give almost every woman a moment, at least, when she can have exactly what she wants.
