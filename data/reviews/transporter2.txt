It's been three years since we last ran into Frank Martin. He'd made quite an impression in ''The Transporter" as a one-man delivery service for the underworld, speeding all over Europe in his black BMW, breaking bones, barely speaking, and, eventually, freeing dozens of Chinese slaves from a trailer. He stopped to make love to a dame. He embarrassed her prissy father. And, on one occasion, he took out a crew of thugs while covered in crude oil. Those were good times. And under only the direst circumstances should they be regurgitated.
But because in the movie industry you can always have way too much of a good thing, here comes ''Transporter 2," a sequel that makes it clear that the outrageous antics of the first movie had a one-time-only charm.
Frank drives an Audi now, and he's traded Europe for Miami, where in this sequel all he transports is a strangely articulate tot from home to school. Holy Noggin network! It's not exactly plowing your car into passersby along the French Riviera, but, really, what is? As played by the impenetrable Englishman Jason Statham, Frank is still coolly fastidious, even while chauffeuring a boy who can't solve his riddles. But Frank is also a little pathetic. ''Transporter 2" has him engaged in a new line of work you would expect from ''Transporter 8."
Nonetheless, when the usual clan of extremely fit, hypersexual Euro baddies kidnaps the boy, Frank speed-walks to the rescue. Who he finds is a greedy Italian villain worthy of a ''Die Hard" spoof. Yes, Alessandro Gassman plays the part with relish and every other condiment at the snack bar: He's not acting; he's hot-dogging. And he's having a good time with this fiendish throwback. (Honestly, is it fashionable any longer for a villain to ask that a $5 million ransom be paid in nonsequential $100 bills?)
When the boy is returned after 35 minutes, we know there's more bad news to come. And Frank is there to uncover it, along the way rebuffing sexual advances from the boy's mother (Amber Valletta) and the villain's lethal weapon of a girlfriend (Kate Nauta). Sorry, ladies, he's all business. ''Your son is infected with a deadly virus," he tells the kid's mother. ''Now anyone who comes into contact with him is going to die."
According to the Russian scientist who whipped it up, the virus is a ''recombinant, double-morphing" something or other -- the accent lost me. But that infected child is just the start of a dopey plot that, among other nonsense, requires Matthew Modine, who is worse than usual as the boy's daddy, to do quite a lot of coughing.
The film provides occasions for Statham to knock us out as he gracefully knocks off anonymous goons with kicks and props (look out for those watermelons). He does all this while wearing his driver's get-up of a black suit and tie over a crisp white shirt. One assortment of nasties is swept into a dumpster. Another is put away with a fire hose that the indestructible Frank turns on only as a finishing move. But, Frank's impossible ditching of a bomb aside, the movie lacks the spectacular sense of the ridiculous that made its predecessor so special.
The screenwriters of both movies, Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, and the director of the first, Corey Yuen, assumed that we'd seen it all, and kept trying to pop our eyes from our heads with a campy plot and formidable stunt craft. This sequel is what you find in a Tupperware container spinning in a microwave. The director, Louis Leterrier, is not as ruthlessly efficient as either Yuen or his hero. He throws in too many rinky-dink, clumsily edited car chases and several fight scenes with as much pow as flat soda.
The first movie didn't have a spare moment to peek in the rearview mirror. On too many occasions in this sequel, the camera stops to rubberneck at the pileups and cars crashed in slow motion. What had the makings of a crisp, confident action vehicle comes down with a case of the Cannonball Runs.


         "Transporter 2" returns Jason Statham as Frank Martin, the ex-Special Forces operative turned mercenary, a martial arts maestro with world-class high-speed driving skills. Armed with a specially equipped Audi A8 that would strike envy in the heart of James Bond, Martin is a "transporter," prepared to move goods or people with no questions asked and on-time delivery guaranteed. The stoic Martin, however, is a man with an unshakable code of honor prepared to go to mind-boggling extremes to keep his word.
 
  Martin may not be Superman, but he's just as fearless while remaining wholly human. He's not afraid of gunning his car straight off a high-rise parking structure only to land on a similar structure across the street, and that's just the beginning of his exploits behind the wheel and in tackling villains on land, under the sea and in a plummeting airplane. Martin has moved from the French Mediterranean to Miami, and as a favor to a friend has signed up for a month's stint chauffeuring to school and back 8-year-old Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), son of rich, hyper-critical, workaholic Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine), newly appointed as the nation's drug czar. Martin takes a fatherly interest in the bright, likable Jack, and the boy's mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), a neglected, mistreated wife, in turn has a yen for the sympathetic but formidably principled Martin.
 


         






    In the meantime super-villain Gianni (Alessandro Gassman) and his gang — most important his sadistic, gunslinging mistress Lola (Kate Nauta), a heavily mascaraed, scantily clad maniac — set up an elaborate scheme to kidnap Jack for a $5-million ransom. Martin senses there's a lot more behind the snatching.
 
  Along with Statham's sterling presence, what makes "Transporter 2" so much fun are car stunt designer Michel Julienne and martial arts choreographer Hong Kong legend Cory Yuen, who's been on both sides of the camera as star, director, writer, producer and stunt man — and was in fact director of the first "Transporter." Yuen, director Louis Leterrier and cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen, writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and their entire cast and crew have collaborated seamlessly to create a slick, modern thriller that has the timeless, edge-of-your-seat appeal of a classic cliffhanging serial. Statham's Martin and Valletta's Audrey provide involving, dimensional characters, and there's some comic relief from Frank's visiting pal, a French police detective — and compulsive gourmet chef (François Berléand), also from the first film. "Transporter 2" delivers a satisfying late-summer escapist treat.

Transporter 2  betrays the legacy of the first Transporter , if such a thing is possible. In that movie (which is actually just decent enough to merit a follow-up), The Italian Job 's Jason Statham was Frank, a puggish ex–Special Forces commando in the south of France who specializes in high-risk driving jobs (bodies in the trunk, bank robbery getaways) and fights, in a smart black suit, as if inhabited by the soul of a grizzled Asian martial-arts master. Showcased in clever if preposterous action sequences, his superhuman killing skills were imaginatively choreographed and lucidly shot, at least compared to the sequel, which is one of those action movies that flash-edits its fight scenes into epileptic nothingness. Here, Frank is in Miami chauffeuring Matthew Modine and Amber Valletta's 6-year-old, who gets kidnapped and infected with a deadly virus. (The antidote is kept, as most antidotes are, in a glowing purple orb.) In place of the original's straight-faced ridiculousness, this one plays like pure parody. In the best scene, the villain has affixed a bomb to the bottom of Frank's speeding Audi A8. To remove it, Frank rides the car off a ramp and spins a 180 in midair, so that the car is soaring upside down as he scrapes the undercarriage against a dangling construction hook, which, of course, knocks the bomb off the car just as it blows. Feel free to chortle: T2  is more unintentionally entertaining than many bad movies, and it's definitely a funnier car romp than The Dukes of Hazzard . Yet we expected more from director Louis Leterrier, fresh off this year's underrated actioner Unleashed , and co-writer Luc Besson (The Professional ), whose good-guy/bad-guy wordplay is at the MST3K-ready ''Sorry, this flight's canceled!''/''No, you're canceled!'' level. The greatest thing about the movie is Statham, a charismatic silent, deadly type who deserves to take the wheel behind a better franchise.

 Jason Statham is the unlikeliest of high-octane action heroes. He is a stocky, ordinary-looking Englishman who doesn't come off all that swift. But as the ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin, the impeccably dressed, blank-faced professional driver in "The Transporter" and now "Transporter 2" with more tricks - and lives - than James Bond, he's struck gold with a franchise-spawning role. The part allows for the exhibition of some impressive martial-arts skills (he performs almost all his own stunts) while requiring very little in the acting department.  After relocating to Miami from the dreamy French seaside, where the Euro-chic first film was set, Frank accepts a short-term assignment chauffeuring a wealthy family's young son. But before long, the boy, for whom Frank has developed a soft spot, is kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus, intended to be passed along to his self-absorbed father (Matthew Modine, in an exceedingly thankless role) and his drug-enforcement colleagues. Frank, whose life is governed by his own strict set of rules, vows to save the boy's life and proceeds to do whatever it takes (the more insanely implausible, the better) to keep his word, while being aggressively pursued by the police, who believe Frank is in on the crime.  Taking over directing duties from Cory Yuen, who was responsible for "The Transporter" and did the martial-arts choreography here, is Louis Leterrier - clearly the right man for the job. In addition to serving as artistic director on the first installment, he also collaborated with the writer-producer Luc Besson on the Jet Li vehicle "Unleashed," released earlier this year.  Though both "Transporter" films are driven by the same empty-headed video-game slickness, "Transporter 2" surpasses its less focused predecessor on almost every level. There are no traces of a romance subplot, which bogged down the first film, freeing up space for even more car chases and fight sequences. And the French cop Tarconi (François Berléand), the closest thing Frank has to a friend, is back, with a more consequential role, helping track down the abducted boy and making up for Frank's lack of charisma.  Purely shallow but never dull, the film wisely pushes the limits of absurdity to the extreme, making it easier to submit to its sheer camp. But even with all thought processes deactivated, it's hard to tolerate the main female baddie (the newcomer Kate Nauta), who struts around in lingerie and red stilettos, toting large guns, while delivering one of the worst performances since Milla Jovovich, another clothing-deprived supermodel-turned-actress, appeared in Mr. Besson's "Fifth Element."  "Transporter 2" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes extreme violence.

The plausibility factor is zero but the entertainment quotient runs fairly high in nimble actioner "The Transporter 2." Effortlessly transplanted from the South of France to Miami, sophomore installment in what looks like a viable franchise has rip-roaring chase scenes, inventive combat interludes and a beginning, a middle and an end. Slick kidnapping yarn starts off like a bat out of hell and never sags. Pic should do decent biz on home turf in Gaul (it opened Aug. 3) rolling out Stateside (Sept. 2) and beyond. 

Scripter Luc Besson's mind may mimic the "shuffle" function on an iPod, but the playlist that emerges here has a good beat and your eyes can dance to it. Nobody who actually enjoyed 2002's "The Transporter" is likely to feel let down by current effort.
Jason Statham is back as dapper and taciturn title character Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces operative turned driver-for-hire who transports things for a fee with rigor and discretion. Frank's sheer lethal coolness is nicely established in first five minutes, when he removes his freshly dry-cleaned suit jacket before laying to waste a quartet of formidable would-be car-jackers.
Frank's filling in for a chauffeur buddy, and his cargo for the last month has been young Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), the only son of U.S. anti-drug czar Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine) and his trophy wife Audrey (Amber Valetta). Frank's sensitivity and powers-of-observation are demonstrated when, having picked Jack up from school, he tactfully drives past the boy's parents to conceal their argument-in-progress from the likeable tyke.
Audrey and Jeff are semi-reconciled after a year's separation. Jeff is out of touch with his son, but viewers are given enough clues to know that Audrey's a great mom and Frank's as good at handling kids as he is at out-maneuvering any and all comers from the latest multiethnic sale at Thugs R Us.
Frank promises little Jack he'll never let anybody hurt him. That's on Friday. On Saturday morning Frank drives Jack to his annual medical checkup so Audrey can set up a surprise birthday party. But psychopathic hellcat Lola (Kate Nauta) and Russian virologist Dimitri (Jason Flemyng, with a Boris Badenov accent) have neutralized the receptionist and real doc and taken their places.
They're working for aggressively fit baddie Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). The plan is to inject Jack with a deadly custom-made virus, exchanging the antidote for a hefty ransom from the Billings' even heftier personal fortune.
When Jack is abducted, the authorities suspect Frank must have been in on it. And, after some very 
muscular research -- including a chase between a jet ski and a bus -- Frank learns that Gianni is a very 
bad man, whose real target is much bigger than one little boy.
Each set piece ups the ante, with Frank's technique for removing an explosive device from the chassis of his car particularly resourceful. Mano-a-mano fistfight on a pilotless private jet spiraling in free fall (for a really 
long time) is ridiculous but fun to watch. Moviegoing cats will be jealous as Frank has obviously been issued way more than nine lives.
Comic relief consists of a visit from jovial French police inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand) who, as in first pic, begrudgingly admires Frank's discipline and professionalism even if he's deduced the Brit's not living entirely off his military pension. Besson plays to the international gallery with a few funny digs at French stereotypes.
Thesping is more than acceptable for this kind of genre fare. Gassman, photographed to tower over Statham, makes a truly creepy villain. Nauta is effectively slutty as the literally killer babe who feels overdressed in anything more than a garter belt and see-through bra and who hates to go more than an hour without icing somebody.
Statham continues to convince as the enigmatic but resolutely can-do Frank. Final line of dialogue implies he'll be back.
Locations brim with industrial menace, and tech work is fine, with helmer Louis Leterrier ("Danny the Dog" aka "Unleashed") sustaining a breathless but not confusing pace.
For those poised to accuse Besson of an originality deficiency, this is almost certainly the only French pic ever to thank Gov. Jeb Bush in its closing credits.

Luc Besson  used to be the promising young director of The Professional  and The Fifth Element . Now he spends his days crafting paeans to the livery industry: Since 1998, he's written and produced four films about excitable taxi drivers and two about the world's most nimble chauffeur. Gas-guzzling adventure isn't the most sensible source of escapism during these times of record oil prices, but the Transporter  series has never troubled itself with politics or current events or gravity. Jason Statham 's titular motorist observes that rules are not meant to be broken, and to that end Besson doesn't fiddle with the first movie's formulaimpossible car chases punctuated by impossible martial arts sequences. Cars and humans spin through the air with equally outlandish aplomb and fight choreographer Corey Yuen 's use of a fire hose is far more creative than anything in the stale kidnapper plot. What does Besson care? He just wants us to tip our drivers.
