Frost/Nixon  is a fact-based drama, starring Michael Sheen and Frank   Langella, about a mid-1970s confrontation between a wily British TV host and a   disgraced American president. Doubt  is a fictional drama, starring Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, about a mid-1960s confrontation between an imperious Bronx nun in charge of a parochial school and a liberal priest she is convinced has behaved improperly with a student. The two might seem to have nothing in common, save that both previously enjoyed award-laden Broadway runs, and both are currently receiving Prestige Movie treatment.
But the pair, taken together, constitute a rewarding study in the opportunities and pitfalls of adaptation. Frost/Nixon , directed with practiced fluidity by Ron Howard, surges with an energy and visual verve that improve the play and enhance the themes of dramatist Peter Morgan's script  about the codependency of media and politics, and about the vanities of ambitious men shaping public images. Doubt , fussily overdirected by its author, John Patrick Shanley, dulls the play's own sharp inquiries into the dangerous power of those who profess certainty with God on their side.
Frost/Nixon  trusts Sheen and Langella to re-create the roles they first originated to such acclaim in London in 2006, then moved to Broadway in 2007. Certainly the two stars know their characters inside and out: There's David Frost, the striving TV-age smoothie who savored his jet-set lifestyle but craved journalistic legitimacy; and there's Richard M. Nixon, the infinitely complicated politician forced to resign in the wake of Watergate, who craved  well, obviously, he craved something, since he agreed (for a handsome fee) to sit with Frost through 12 days of taped interrogation. With the transcript as his guide, Morgan explores psychological terrain: how Frost found the chutzpah to land the interviews; how Nixon played cat and mouse with his interlocutor when asked to admit wrongdoing and apologize; how both men of humble beginnings felt stung by the scorn of those born with more  privilege; and how both were superb manipulators. But Sheen (who played the very model of a modern British go-getter as Tony Blair in The Queen , also written by Morgan) and Langella (operating at the peak of his powers) are disciplined enough to crop their performances to close-up size. (The sizing echoes the look of the   actual interviews.) And Howard is smart   to enhance the one-on-ones with journalistic context, weaving archival Watergate-era   footage into his fictionalized re-creation.
Streep and Hoffman, in contrast, translate roles memorably created by Cherry Jones and Brían F. O'Byrne as Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. Without a doubt, the movie stars are primo ''gets'' in the famous-name sweepstakes. (They're aided by Viola   Davis in a blazing, brief appearance as the mother of the boy who may or may not have received the priest's inappropriate attentions, and by Amy Adams in the wan role of a susceptible younger nun who becomes the agent of Sister Aloysius' terrible righteousness.) But Hoffman and Streep, especially, are also vulnerable actors in need of guidance from a director with a strong vision. And Shanley, in his first movie-helming gig since he leaped into his own script for Joe Versus the Volcano  nearly two decades ago and lost, turns out to have dismayingly few original cinematic notions to back up the basic did-he-or-didn't-he hook in his study of conviction and compassion. There's not a wind-whipped leaf, rain-hammered window, or burned-out lightbulb the director doesn't admire, lest we ignore a metaphor about spiritual crisis.
Meanwhile, Streep, apparently left to her own devices, lugs a load of mannerisms under the pruny nun's severe black habit, encouraged by the movie's literal-minded director. Sister A may be an intimidating, spirit-breaking character  but for all that, she's also   a servant of God unswerving in her code of right and wrong, and we ought to feel her burden. We don't. Speaking lines written to reach the stage heavens, the cast is infernally noisy and hectoring about mysteries that ought   to be felt with a communal hush. I doubt that's what the creator  I mean the playwright  had in mind. Frost/Nixon : A– ; Doubt :
Frank Langella talks about Frost/Nixon

 It’s twinkle versus glower in the big-screen edition of Peter Morgan’s theatrical smackdown “Frost/Nixon.” Directed by Ron Howard and adapted by Mr. Morgan, the film revisits the televised May 1977 face-off between the toothy British personality David Frost and the disgraced former president Richard M. Nixon three years after he left office, trimming their nearly 30-hour armchair-to-armchair spar into a tidy 122-minute narrative of loss and redemption that, at least from this ringside seat, would be better titled “Nixon/Frost.”  Broadcast in four 90-minute programs, the interviews were seen as an enormous risk both for Mr. Frost, who was gambling with his money and future, and for the presidentially pardoned Nixon, who was seeking absolution but risked further public humiliation. (Whatever the outcome, he was guaranteed a sweet jackpot: some $600,000 and 10 percent of the profits.)  For James Reston Jr., who helped Mr. Frost prepare for the interviews (and is played by a rabbity Sam Rockwell in the movie), and whose book “The Conviction of Richard Nixon” was the so-called grist for Mr. Morgan’s play, the former president was akin to Proteus, the wily, shape-shifting Old Man of the Sea from “The Odyssey.” It’s an evocative image, though the thing about Proteus is that when caught he does tell the truth.  As it happens, the worst didn’t happen to either Frost or Nixon, the worst being relative to your political view. The fallen leader fell no further, despite the choking close-ups, beads of sweat, agonized stammers, weird digressions and outrageous pronouncements: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” The reviews were decidedly mixed — from prison his former aide John D. Ehrlichman gave Nixon’s performance the big thumbs down, calling it “a smarmy, maudlin rationalization.” But the audience share was huge, blockbuster-size:  the first program, on Watergate, which played against a John Wayne flick and reruns of “Good Times” and “The Bionic Woman,” attracted as many viewers as the year’s reigning ratings champ, “Happy Days,” the Eisenhower-era sitcom in which Mr. Howard played the Everyboy Richie Cunningham.  Stories of lost crowns lend themselves to drama, but not necessarily audience-pleasing entertainments, which may explain why “Frost/Nixon” registers as such a soothing, agreeably amusing experience, more palliative than purgative. Anchored by its first-rate leads, who originated the roles on the London stage — Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost — the movie is a talkathon embellished with camera movements. It opens with one of those compressed historical montages, a kind of tossed salad of names, places and dates (Walter Cronkite, Watergate, August 1974), before moving on to the main course: Frost trying to persuade — and, with comforting words and an open checkbook, eventually persuading — Nixon to sit down to a series of on-camera interviews in a suburban Southern California house.  Much like Mr. Morgan’s screenplay for “The Queen,” a fictionalized account of the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair  in the aftermath of Diana’s death, “Frost/Nixon” turns on a power struggle between stubborn if sympathetic adversaries. Once again Mr. Sheen, who played Mr. Blair in both “The Queen” and “The Deal,” a made-for-British-television movie written by Mr. Morgan, assumes the role of the professional sycophant who proves tougher than his breezy smiles suggest. And once again, much as he was by Helen Mirren in “The Queen,” the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer who, if not carefully tethered, will devour the screen by the greedy mouthful.  And devour Mr. Langella does, chomp chomp. Artfully lighted and shot to accentuate the character’s trembling, affronted jowls, his shoulders hunched, face bunched, he creeps along like a spider, alternately retreating into the shadows and pouncing with a smile. That smile should give you nightmares, but Mr. Howard, a competent craftsman who tends to dim the lights in his movies even while brightening their themes (“A Beautiful Mind”), has neither the skill nor the will to draw out a dangerous performance from Mr. Langella, something to make your skin crawl or heart leap. Unlike Oliver Stone, who invested Nixon (a memorable Anthony Hopkins) with Shakespearean heft but refused to sentimentalize him, this is a portrait designed to elicit a sniffy tear or two along with a few statuettes.  At one point in the stage production of “Frost/Nixon” the two opponents sat facing each other under a bank of monitors showing the president’s face in fragmented mosaic. It’s a terrific theatrical contrivance that literalizes Mr. Morgan’s belief that Mr. Frost understood the power of the close-up. (Mr. Howard’s more prosaic interpretation of this same theme results in a lot of ... close-ups.) But Mr. Morgan radically underestimates Nixon’s own understanding of television itself. By the time he took on Mr. Frost, memories of his flop-sweat encounter with John F. Kennedy had been long supplanted by images of Nixon in China, and on your family television set. As one Nixon adviser said in 1967, “The response is to the image, not to the man.” In 1977 Nixon dusted off that image. The cleanup job continues.    “Frost/Nixon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Crude language.

�Frost/Nixon� is an effective, straightforward bigscreen version of Peter Morgan�s shrewd stage drama about the historic 1977 TV interview in which Richard Nixon brought himself down once again. Like the other election-year release about a modern Republican president, �W.,� this one isn�t out to �get� its much-vilified subject as much as to cast him as something of a tragic victim of his own limitations and foibles -- tragic for the perpetrator and his country alike. Frank Langella�s meticulous performance will attract serious filmgoers, assuring good biz in upscale markets, but luring the under-40 public will pose a significant marketing challenge. Universal release preemed Wednesday night as the opener of the London Film Festival in advance of its Dec. 5 Stateside bow.
Re-creating his Tony-winning role, Langella doesn�t instantaneously convince as the 37th president the moment you first see him, in the wake of Nixon�s resignation in disgrace on Aug. 9, 1974 -- the voice seems a bit languorous, the mannerisms a tad forced, his features a shade Mediterranean. But over the course of the piece, the many facets of the performance merge into an impeccably observed characterization of a man whose accomplishments, intellect and aggressive use of power never entirely overcame an abiding inferiority complex and propensity for self-sabotage. 
Morgan, who has carved a unique niche for himself penning smart dramas about the private dealings of eminent modern figures (�The Queen,� �The Deal,� �The Last King of Scotland�), laid out in his 2006 play the unlikely circumstances surrounding Nixon�s four-part interview with English TV personality and chatshow host David Frost (Michael Sheen), a breezy entertainer better known for bantering with showbiz stars than for confronting political heavyweights.
As with �The Queen,� one couldn�t have suspected there was necessarily a film in this material or, even if there were, that it could be written with such authority and seeming inside knowledge. In this case, the important events unfolded much as they do onscreen: The bold and opportunistic Frost, then hosting a TV show in Australia, put his own money on the line to keep the project alive when all the major networks and most advertisers shied away from the checkbook journalism involved; Swifty Lazar brokered the deal that would bring Nixon a much-needed $600,000; the former president saw the epic interview as a means of rehabilitating himself, which in turn would lead to a move back East to the corridors of power; and, in what was mutually acknowledged to be a duel in which only one man would prevail, Nixon almost effortlessly controlled the interview until Frost turned the tables in a desperate, last-minute ploy.
Although it all pays off in a potent and revelatory final act rife with insights into the psychology and calculations of power players, the initial stretch is rather dry and prosaic. Perhaps needlessly adopting a cinematic equivalent of the play�s direct-to-audience address, Howard �interviews� several of the characters, witness-style, which makes the film feel somewhat choppy, half like a documentary at first. Approach also imposes an overly predictable editing style on the whole film, one in which the cuts come precisely on the expected beats, when a fleet, syncopated rhythm would have moved the exposition along with more flair. The film might even have done without the talking heads altogether.
Sheen, so effective as Tony Blair in both �The Deal� and �The Queen,� excels again as Frost, an insouciant ladies� man who in many ways was Nixon�s opposite -- light, devil-may-care and sociable rather than dark, brooding and awkward. An engaging early scene -- in which Frost, traveling with recruited British producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), picks up comely young socialite Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) in a 747�s first-class cabin on his way to California to meet Nixon for the first time -- adroitly conveys the gifted gabber�s talent for mixing work and pleasure.
The only slightly disconcerting aspect of Sheen�s turn is his appearance; with his longish, brushed-back hair, sideburns, arched eyebrows and occasionally pursed lips, he calls to mind Jack Nicholson in �The Shining.� For her part, as coiffed here, Hall looks quite like Carly Simon.
Widely viewed as a lightweight ill equipped to take on a cagey old pro like Nixon, Frost engages two key associates to help strategize for the big event, vet journo Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and professional Nixon hater James Reston (Sam Rockwell). Nixon, portrayed as leading a lonely, isolated life at his seaside villa in San Clemente (key location work was done at the president�s actual house, Casa Pacifica), relies for support on a former Marine, Col. Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), while wife Pat (Patty McCormack, child star of �The Bad Seed�) putters around in a fog.
While the preliminaries could have been served up with a bit more panache, the behind-the-scenes details prove more interesting than might have been imagined. Reston, especially, senses that Frost, who�s consumed by trying to nail down backing for the $2 million undertaking, will fail to put Nixon through �the trial he never had� and supply what he feels the American people need -- a conviction.
Dramatic intensity increases when the interviews commence at pic�s midway point. The interviews were taped, not at Nixon�s own abode, but at the modest nearby home of a Republican Party supporter. Nixon has his way with Frost through the first three sessions, telling long stories, reinforcing his presidential stature and digressing when his interlocutor attempts to put him on the spot. 
The interview excerpts are obviously the real thing, and have been staged with great attention to how they actually looked. Where the script really shines is in the incidental backstage conversation, especially how Nixon smalltalks with Frost and catches him off-guard with remarks about the host�s presumed sex life and habits. These private exchanges culminate in the work�s most compelling sequence, in which an inebriated Nixon, prior to the final interview, phones Frost with a late-night ramble stressing their perceived similarities as fellows from modest circumstances looked down upon by �the snobs.� 
By the final scenes, Langella has all but disappeared so as to deliver Nixon himself, leading to a melancholy ending defined, as predicted, by the triumph of one man and the virtual vanquishing of the other.
Playing real-life participants, some better known than others, supporting players are uniformly effective. A host of locations, including the very suite at the Beverly Hilton where Frost stayed, heighten the verisimilitude, although production designer Michael Corenblith, his staff and costume designer Daniel Orlandi have advisedly soft-pedaled the mid-�70s accoutrements so as not to distract too much from serious matters at hand. Hans Zimmer�s background score provides some extra zing, while the R rating, earned no doubt by a number of vulgarities, is unfortunate, as it will further limit the number of younger people who might see the film. 


I hear America singing and I see . . . Richard Nixon . Not the man, but the muse: Has any president since Lincoln inspired more movies, TV mini-series, and operas? Just as Nixon's beetle brows, ski nose, and mirthless grin were made for caricature, so his rampant pathology was a gift for novelists and psycho-historians.
Frost/Nixon , dutifully directed by Ron Howard  from screenwriter Peter Morgan 's enjoyably glib play, is the latest installment of the Nixoniad, appropriately set in a media hall of mirrors. The subject is not Watergate, but its aftermath—the series of four televised interviews with the disgraced 37th president that British chat star David Frost  orchestrated and syndicated in the spring of 1977, a little less than three years after Nixon's resignation.
The interviews were the subject of intense interest even before they happened. The media hyped itself. The details of the deal, including Nixon's $600,000 payday, were breathlessly reported. Mike Wallace  created an anticipatory meta-event by interviewing interviewer Frost on 60 Minutes  ; the event itself rated the cover of TV Guide   as well as Time . Devoted largely to Watergate and including what was taken to be Nixon's apology, the first interview was among the top shows of 1977, attracting 45 million viewers. The mimic David Frye , then known as the world's greatest Nixon impersonator, modified his act—restaging the interview and taking both parts. Frost and Nixon each produced follow-up bestsellers, with Frost's behind-the-scenes account, I Gave Them a Sword , serving as the basis for Morgan's 2006 play, a hit first in London and then New York.
A docudramatist whose screen credits include The Queen  and The Last King of Scotland , Morgan conceived the Frost-Nixon interviews as a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win. Ever-cheerful Frost (Michael Sheen , wide-eyed and so coiffed as to be a distraction) meets sonorous, gloomy Nixon (Frank Langella ) for the equivalent of the pre-bout weigh-in. The former president is immune to Frost's preternatural perkiness even as he peppers the air with misfired jokes. Chronology is tweaked to give events a sports-match tension. As soon as the cameras roll, Frost takes a wild swing—asking why Nixon didn't just destroy the incriminating tapes—and opens himself up to a bludgeoning counterattack.
Round 1 ends with Nixon running down the clock as Frost is forced to spend his downtime dashing from sponsor to sponsor, trying to line up ads. In Round 2, Frost attempts to ambush Nixon by surprising him with actual atrocity footage of his Cambodian invasion. Nixon ducks this roundhouse and leaves Frost hugging the ropes. It's all pretty lugubrious until the big invented scene, when the former president places a drunken call to Frost's hotel room, seeking a measure of class solidarity: "Did the snobs look down on you, too?"
Howard has beefed up the supporting roles—Kevin Bacon  plays Nixon's aide, Oliver Platt  and Sam Rockwell  are Frost's researchers, and Rebecca Hall  has the decorative role of Frost's mistress. In opening up the play, however, the movie unavoidably dissipates its power. Having Nixon's actual lair, the so-called Casa Pacifica, as a location is considerably less compelling than the stripped-down onstage set, in which Langella and Sheen competed not just with each other, but with their giant, multiplied video images. (There's a profound poetic justice in that, as historian David Greenberg  has argued; Nixon was the first American president preeminently concerned with the construction of his image.)
Of course, Frost/Nixon  does provide a certain bitter pleasure, appearing as George W. Bush  slips into ignominy. In the season's current scholarly Nixonalysis, Reinventing Richard Nixon , Daniel Frick  describes Frost/Nixon 's Broadway audience chuckling as Langella delivered Nixon's sound-bite justification for his abuse of power ("When the President does it, that means it's not illegal"), but reserving true merriment for the follow-up line ("But I realize that no one else shares that view"), as if to acknowledge that the current White House  occupant does share Nixon's view and had gone him one better.
Still, Frost/Nixon 's main attraction is neither its topicality nor its historical value, but Langella's re-creation of his Tony-winning performance. Anthony Hopkins 's portrayal was even stiffer than the man himself (Nixon , 1995), but, each in his way, Rip Torn  (Blind Ambition , 1979) and Philip Baker Hall  (Secret Honor , 1984) were also fabulous Nixons, while Dan Hedaya  (Dick , 1999) made the most of his uncanny resemblance. Langella brings something else to the role: He doesn't shake his jowls or attempt Nixon's sickly smile. Ice-cold and physically imposing, the actor is a naturally menacing presence; his stooped, shambling, eye-rolling Nixon is like a prehistoric beast at bay. Howard follows Nixon's confession ("I brought myself down—I gave them a sword") with the show-stopping image of the stricken leader absurdly pausing to pet a fan's doggy on his way to the limo of oblivion.
In this, Langella captures something of the 1977 Nixon. As New York Times  columnist Anthony Lewis  wrote at the time: "The first Frost interview made this dreadful creature seem pathetic." In his 1970 speech on Cambodia , Nixon had warned that America would become "a pitiful, helpless giant." Langella's performance is the lament of a man who became what he beheld.
