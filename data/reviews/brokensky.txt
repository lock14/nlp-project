 The plot of “Broken Sky” goes like this: Boy (Miguel Angel Hoppe) meets boy (Fernando Arroyo), boys fall in love, boys have lots of sex. Boy No. 1 cruises another boy (Ignacio Pereda) at a nightclub; the boys’ relationship is strained. Enter a new boy (Alejandro Rojo), and a new falling in love, and lots more sex. Tension and sex and more sex ensue, until the original pair eventually come to reconciliation. The end. No detail has been omitted from this synopsis of the narrative, which unfolds over the course of nearly two and a half hours of audacious erotic minimalism.  The idea of “Broken Sky,” which was written and directed by Julián Hernández, is far more complex: to flesh out from this skeletal premise a voluptuous epic of nonverbal phenomena, to evoke the tone and texture of a kiss, a glance, the pulse of desire, the color of jealousy, the pattern of cracks in a broken heart. Dialogue is minimal; image says all. With the help of Alejandro Cantu, his gutsy, hypersensitive cinematographer, Mr. Hernández circles and scrutinizes his actors, maneuvering them in and out of elaborate traveling shots that dissolve continuous space. Style makes meaning, and the style is extravagantly abstract.  Movies, and our expectations of them, remain so much in thrall to outmoded conventions of the novel and theater that “Broken Sky” may seem flagrantly precious. It is no more contrived than Keats. Mr. Hernández doesn’t always grab what he’s reaching for — his talent soars untethered by discipline — but the thrust of his effort lights up the sky.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Though the bold treatment of homoerotic love in Mexican helmer Julian Hernandez's feature bow "Broken Sky" is sure to grab attention, it doesn't take long before the pic's torturously slow pace turns an earnest effort into a tedious aesthetic exercise. A love triangle is played out in near-wordless pantomime among three attractive young thesps, frequently photographed in the buff. But yearning looks followed by foreplay and tumbling do not a 2�--hour feature film make. Word of mouth will soon kill the film's prospects as a gay date-movie at arthouse venues. Its Berlin fest bow elicited massive walkouts. 
Sensitive Gerardo (Miguel Angel Hoppe) loves Jonas (Fernando Arroyo), and for a while they're happy together. Then Jonas is dazzled by a fleeting encounter with a stranger in a disco. Broken-hearted, Gerardo finds consolation in the arms of Sergio (Alejandro Rojo), another sensitive soul, yet he and Jonas are too much in love to break off completely.
There is little that feels real in this choreographed dance of love, rejection, pain, new love, guilt, return to old love. With an extensive background in shorts, writer-director Hernandez seems unable to rise to the challenge of narrative, preferring to explore simple moods at narcissistic length. Deprived of dialogue, Hoppe, Rojo and Arroyo have no way to build their characters, and communicate little more than self-absorption.
The action takes place in the wide-open spaces of a city college campus, or the closed universe of bedrooms, bathrooms, an airless club. Film's elegant cinematography is a pleasure to watch. Alejandro Cantu alternates horizontal pans and fixed camera to sensually caress the protags' sculpted young bodies, while locking them into painterly poses that tend to drain away a lot of the eroticism; there's nothing down and dirty about this film. Rhythm is infinitely slow as scenes circle around to repeat themselves again and again and again.

You can't accuse Mexican writer-director Julián Hernández  of lacking a consistent vision. In this film, as in his previous A Thousand Clouds of Peace , he aims squarely at a lyrical portrayal of obsessive love. The problem? Hernández's real subject is narcissism, which he doesn't seem to understand. And he doesn't believe in dialogue. The result is nearly two and a half hours of plaintive looks, with the following vaguely apparent plot: Jonás (Fernando Arroyo ) and Gerardo (Miguel Á Hoppe) are two university students who see each other on campus and immediately have sex. Things go well until Jonás sees a different boy and fixates on him. Gerardo retaliates by hooking up with someone else. That's the moviedesperate grasps, huffy affronts, gulping kisses, and one juicy (if silent) sex scene, early in the film, before our senses have been deadened by boredom. Without dialogue, we don't know who the characters are, so we can't care about what they do.
