"Meet the Robinsons" is the first movie to come out of Walt Disney Feature Animation since Pixar
 head John Lasseter took over the store last year, and, not surprisingly, it plays like Disney product with a shot of creative caffeine. Almost as funny as it is hyperactive, the new computer-animated family comedy is luscious to look at and as fizzy as a can of soda popped open in your face.
Especially if you see it in 3-D, which you probably will. With "Robinsons," Disney is escalating the 3-D experiment it started with 2005's "Chicken Little ," and the film industry is watching very, very closely. Nearly 700 theaters nationwide have recently been outfitted with projectors capable of showing the twin polarized images, and boxes of grey-tinted imitation Ray-Bans are stacked up. It may be time to replace that iconic '50s photograph of an audience wearing red-and-green paper glasses with a vision of a theater full of Roy Orbison clones. (The film will also be released in the standard 2-D format . )
So how's the movie? Good enough that it doesn't really have to be in 3-D. This tale of a boy genius misunderstood in his own time but loved and even necessary in the future is bright, fast, and comical, with a poignant emotional throughline that's only slightly compromised by Disney's heavy-handed way with a branding iron. However Pixar's DNA has entwined with the host object, it's to the benefit of "Meet the Robinsons," which is a markedly better movie than "Chicken Little."
Our Tom Swift -wannabe is Lewis (voiced by two actors, Daniel Hansen and Jordan Fry , though the film's publicity materials are mum on why), a bespectacled, bristle-headed orphan desperate to be part of a family. Some 124 couples have rejected him, mostly because his many inventions have a tendency to blow up. How was Lewis to know his PB&J-making machine would kick off a peanut allergy in one prospective dad?
Determined to find out why his mother left him on the orphanage steps when he was an infant, Lewis creates a memory-retrieval device and plans to unveil it at the school science fair. He's stopped by two figures out of the future: a moustache-twirling villain in a bowler hat (director Stephen Anderson , doing double duty) and an energetic young boy named Wilbur Robinson (Wesley Singerman ). Turns out that something awful is going down three decades from now and Lewis's help is required.
If this sounds like we've somehow wandered into "Back to the Future Part II ," you're right. "Meet the Robinsons" dodges the issue by introducing us to Wilbur's extended and strenuously wacky family: It's as if The Incredibles were staging a revival of "You Can't Take it With You " on the leftover sets of "The Jetsons ." Grandpa (Anderson again) wears his clothes backward , Uncle Art (Holy Comeback, it's Adam West ) is a pizza-delivering superhero, mother Franny (Nicole Sullivan ) is a hot mom, the butler's an octopus, and there are two strange cousins in the potted plants.
I haven't mentioned the lounge-jazz-singing frogs, have I? Nor the uncle who's married to a hand puppet? (They've somehow had kids, but I don't think we want to go there.)
All this comes at us fast and furiously, and in one frenzied sequence the 3 - D action-o-rama became so intense I began to feel physically disoriented. (Like they say in the IMAX
 theaters, close your eyes for a minute and think of England.) Disney Digital 3D doesn't come with a defibrillator, but maybe it should.
There are reasons for the villain's campaign to stop Lewis, and they're fairly baroque, involving an army of mind-controlling bowler hats, enslaved frog zombies, an earnest T. Rex, and much zip-zap-zipping between now and tomorrow. The classic logic of time-travel fiction doesn't hold up, but your kids will still get the giggles from scenes they're not already familiar with from the trailer.
So will you -- but you'll also notice the bits cribbed from other movies, as well as a narrative motor that keeps coughing like one of Lewis's misfired inventions. There are seven credited writers on "Robinsons," and it sometimes seems as if they're all talking at once.
I ended up just luxuriating in the film's pastel retro-future visual scheme and trying to ignore the parts that looked like Disney World. There's so much visual invention in "Robinsons" that it sometimes runs over the sides and a bluebird wearing a fez will pop up in a corner of the screen. Why? Who needs a reason?
The film's mantra is "Keep moving forward," and it's applied until you want to happily cry uncle. For all its wonderment, though, "Meet the Robinsons" is product that comes from a massive entertainment conglomerate, and at the very end of the movie comes an unexpectedly blunt reminder of that.
Some parents and kids might find this last touch charming, a reconnection with Walt's original mission. Those of us who already resent how deeply Disney has colonized our children's imaginations may find it leaves a sour taste more unsettling than any 3 - D-induced vertigo. Enough already: Who's wearing the bowler hats here and who are the enslaved? And how do we get back to the future?


         It's hard to think of "Meet the Robinsons," the new sub-Pixar animated film from Disney, as much more than a stopgap measure until this summer's "Ratatouille." Loosely based on "A Day With Wilbur Robinson," a 1992 children's book by Michael Joyce, it's a breezy knock-off of "The Jetsons," souped up with a time-travel twist and a mostly superfluous 3-D gimmick. (The film is being released in both standard and digital 3-D versions, the 600 screens nationwide being the widest opening ever for a 3-D movie.)
 
 Raised in an orphanage, bespectacled science nerd and boy inventor Lewis (voiced by Daniel Hansen) has terrible luck with prospective parents, who tend to be put off by his messily malfunctioning gadgets. The 12-year-old sets to work on a memory device that he hopes will help him track down his birth mother. But his obsession with the past unexpectedly catapults him into the future: He hitches a ride in the time machine of a mysterious teenager named Wilbur Robinson and winds up in the year 2037.
 


         






   By all appearances, it seems as if Lewis has traveled not through time but down the rabbit hole and into an absurdist wonderland. Wilbur's eccentric extended family lives on a sprawling estate where a chorus of tuxedoed singing frogs serves as the in-house entertainment, and the domestic help includes a purple octopus and a C-3PO-ish robot. (Tom Selleck and Adam West are among the actors who provide voices for the family members.)
 
 While Wilbur tries to keep the other Robinsons from finding out that his new friend is from a different era, Lewis is convinced he's found the perfect adoptive family.
 
 The boys are also pursued, for initially obscure reasons, by a moustache-twirling baddie, known as Bowler Hat Guy and voiced by the film's director, Stephen J. Anderson. (The character was reportedly a late addition, one of several changes imposed on the film by executive producer John Lasseter, director of "Toy Story" and "Cars" and Disney's chief creative officer of animation since the company's acquisition of Pixar last year.)
 
 As tends to be the case, the 3-D process is simply an excuse to have characters and objects lunge in the general direction of the viewer. (It's best showcased in a dinosaur chase sequence and a food fight involving a "meatball cannon.") In other words, the stereoscopic effect, achieved through state-of-the-art digital technology, is used in no more modern a fashion than it was in the golden age of 3-D: the 1950s.
 
 Which is perhaps in keeping with the overall retro-futurist vibe. (The geometric, Art Deco cityscape is the most impressive visual element here.) The animators also mix in high-toned references to surrealist art, with direct nods to René Magritte in the form of a flying bowler hat and an elaborate topiary garden.
 
 The screenplay, credited to seven writers, ties itself into knots when Lewis discovers the identity of the Robinson patriarch. Grown-ups, if not their kids, will notice a milder variation on the Oedipal complications of "Back to the Future," in which Michael J. Fox must fend off the advances of his mother. The usual time-travel dilemmas also ensue: if Bowler Hat Guy, who has stolen a time machine, changes the course of history for his own selfish purposes, the entire Robinson clan, not to mention much of the human race, could cease to exist.
 
 Zippy if forgettable, "Meet the Robinsons" keeps the tone mildly tongue-in-cheek and ends on a dutifully inspirational note. The oft-repeated motto, lifted from the wisdom of Uncle Walt, is "Keep moving forward" — advice that this basically old-fashioned film seems content to ignore.
 
 "Meet the Robinsons." MPAA rating: G. Running time: 1 hour, 42 minutes. In general release.   

There's a frantic, woo-woo, ding-dong, look-HERE-no-look-THERE!  attention-shattering disorder to Meet the Robinsons , a new animated family comedy from Disney's wobbly CG factory. The head-banging effect suggests a new category of filmmaking endeavor not previously analyzed in serious cinema journals: blind-men-and-elephant art. That's what happens when seven  seven!   screenwriters grope and stumble their way around an unmanageable story set simultaneously in the past, present, and a Jimmy Neutron future, starring a science-minded orphan kid who travels in a time machine. And in that future, he meets a family as squarely Walton-ish, in their lesson-dispensing way, as they are feverishly wacky.
In jerry-rigging a contraption from recycled parts  The Incredibles, Robots, Star Wars,  maybe even old animated Alka-Seltzer commercials  the production team (helmed by Stephen Anderson, making his overmatched  feature debut) doesn't know when to take a breath. So the movie weighs in on child abandonment, adoption, dangerous joyriding, failure as a mark of creativity, childhood embarrassment as a source of a vengeful adulthood, and frogs as good nightclub singers. There's also an irritating villain called Bowler Hat Guy. Under such circumstances, who  knows whether the project is meant to be earnest, ironic, post-ironic, made for adults, made for kids, made to teach lessons, or made to be watched in an altered state? All or none...jeez, this thing is one bumpy ride.

 At the end of “Meet the Robinsons,” a new 3-D computer-animated Disney film (loosely based on a popular children’s book by William Joyce), the screen is filled with an inspiring quotation from Walt Disney himself. The gist of it is that “around here” — meaning at Disney’s entertainment workshop — not a lot of time is spent looking backward. Instead, the motto is, as it is for some of the characters in the film, “Keep moving forward.”  In other words, learn from your mistakes. And it seems appropriate that this great man’s  words appear at the end of this movie, since they implicitly invite you to forget what you have just seen and may even serve as a sort of apology. Whether or not it counts as a mistake — movies tend to be made on purpose — “Meet the Robinsons” is surely one of the worst theatrically released animated features issued under the Disney label in quite some time.  Lewis, the bespectacled orphan who is this film’s hero, is a budding inventor whose obsessive nerdiness turns off potential adoptive parents. One of his less successful creations is a peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich machine that sprays brown and purple goo in every direction except onto the waiting bread. And so it is with “Meet the Robinsons.” With increasing desperation, the filmmakers (Stephen Anderson directed and shares screenwriting credit with a half-dozen other writers) and their Disney and Pixar supervisors hurl fun at the screen, digging deep into their bag of used novelties.  Lonely orphans? Hey, this is Disney; they practically invented lonely orphans. If you like time travel, they have that too. Lessons for the children: take your pick. Warm fuzzies for the grown-ups? That’s what lonely orphans are for. But if that’s not enough, the movie also has singing frogs — hey, it’s not like Warner Brothers owns that idea or anything — a lovable T-Rex and a bowler hat with claws. And a kid from the future with Jimmy Neutron’s hair! And an amusing talking robot like the ones in “Robots”! And a crazy extended family like the ones in lots of other movies! And Tom Selleck! And Rufus Wainwright (singing on the soundtrack). Rufus Wainwright? But did I mention the bowler hats? They’re plotting to take over the world.  Curiously, this last plot point yields the only visually interesting section of the movie, a brief sequence in which the much-ballyhooed 3-D technology is yoked to a dystopian architectural vision that recalls Japanese anime. Otherwise, the effects seem as haphazard and tacked-on as the plotlines. The present-day world where Lewis starts out looks as drab and generic as a studio back  lot set, and the landscape of the future is lifeless and badly scaled. “The Jetsons” did it better.  And, with the exception of a few quiet early moments before the full whirligig of narrative starts spinning, just about everything in “Meet the Robinsons” has been done better before, including at the Disney factory. This movie has more in common with cobbled-together junk like “Chicken Little” and “Treasure Planet” than with the studio’s classics. But it’s all right. I guess everyone makes mistakes — though only movie studios expect the rest of us to pay for theirs. 

The story's bywords may be "Keep Moving Forward," but the time-jumping narrative does some wild loop-the-loops in "Meet the Robinsons," a sharp-minded, plenty entertaining toon that will keep children of all ages wide-eyed and on their toes. Latest computer-generated animated feature from Disney is leagues ahead of the first, the successful but thick-headed "Chicken Little," in wit and art-istry, and shows the unmistakable influence of newly arrived Pixar wizard John Lasseter and friends. Snazzy entry should do strong if not smash biz through the spring, especially in the 600-plus theaters equipped to project it in the superb Disney Digital 3-D process.
The three-dimensional technique requires glasses, large, lightweight specs with dark lenses rather than the colored ones so dismally employed for the likes of "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D." Seen previously in limited engagements of Disney's "Chicken Little" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas," the state-of-the-art technology combines dramatic, in-your-face perspectives with a more than acceptable comfort level.
Happily, as has not often been the case in the past, 3-D has here been put to use in the service of what is, on its own merits, a good film. More than has any previous Disney effort, "Robinsons" resembles Pixar's smash "The Incredibles," both in the way the visuals combine futuristic and retro elements, and in the smart talk and can-do energy of the characters.
Left as a tot on the doorstep of a big city orphanage, straw-haired Lewis is a passionate science geek who, at 12, despairs of ever being adopted and gaining a family of his own. His fellow wastrel and only pal is sad-sack "Goob," a baseball fanatic forever depressed over a muffed catch that lost his team a big game.
Lewis is convinced he's made his big scientific breakthrough with a cleverly designed brain-scanner. But his presentation of the device at his school science fair is dashed by the interference of a mysterious crab-legged bowler hat doing the bidding of a dastardly villain, a curiously 19th-century figure with a cape, thin moustache, spindly legs and sinister laugh.
Just when Lewis and the audience might become concerned about what lies ahead, the boy is literally whisked off his feet by Wilbur, a cocky teen with a time machine. While Lewis would prefer to go back in time to look for the mother who abandoned him, Wilbur insists upon zooming ahead to the future, where his large family, the endlessly eccen-tric and imaginative Robinsons, await.
Pic comes into its own at this point, about a third of the way through -- first with the lovely design elements, then with the narrative time-jumping that makes all sorts of wild inventions possible in the adaptation of William Joyce's illustrated book engineered by seven screenwriters, among them first-time director Stephen Anderson (whose most prominent previous credits were as story supervisor on Disney's "The Emperor's New Groove" and "Brother Bear").
Wilbur's genius dad is the brain behind Robinson Industries, where the brightest new inventions are hatched for futuristic environs of the sort portrayed at world's fairs anytime from the '30s through the '50s. People glide around in transparent bubbles amidst elegant examples of the Streamline Moderne architectural style, exemplified by clean lines and graceful curves.
But due to an unfortunate time ma-chine wreck, a theft and the unwanted visit of the archfiend with the thin moustache and malevolent hats, this brainiacs' paradise is turned upside down; worse for Lewis, he's denied longed-for adoption just when he's found the family of his dreams. Wickedly clever manipulations of time travel make for some wacky character identity flip-flops, as well as the retrieval of a ferocious T-Rex brought forward to wreak havoc on the impeccably manicured landscapes of the future.
Especially in 3-D, pic has an im-mensely sharp, vivid look (sans glasses, the projected image is fuzzy in spots, focused in others), and the filmmakers have taken to heart the "Keep Moving Forward" attitude, attributed in an onscreen postscript to Walt Disney himself, in the way they keep the momentum revved up. Unlike some frantic animated efforts, "Robinsons" is never exhausting, but neither is there anything resembling a dull moment.
Voicings are spirited -- helmer Anderson himself performs the chief villain, among other roles -- and Danny Elfman's score, aided by other musical elements, further augments the energy level.
