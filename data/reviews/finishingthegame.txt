Director Justin Lin had the good idea of making a movie about the search for an actor to replace Bruce Lee after he died, in 1973, partway through the shooting of Game of Death . Lin then had the very bad idea to stage Finishing the Game  as a broad mockumentary, full of tiresomely exaggerated, vainly leering actors with names like Breeze Loo and Troy Poon; they make the contestants on your average reality-dating show look droll. The film completely misses what should have been its real target  the filming of Game of Death , a martial-arts campfest worthy of Edward D. Wood Jr.

 A faux documentary grounded in ethnicity and mired in absurdity, “Finishing the Game” is a terrific idea still waiting to be fashioned into a real movie.  When Bruce Lee died suddenly in 1973 at 32, he had filmed only 12 minutes of his dream project, “The Game of Death.” The studio’s decision to complete the film using a replacement actor outraged fans and provides the impetus for “Finishing the Game,” an extended audition sequence for the new Bruce Lee.  Marshaling the unlikeliest of candidates, the movie stabs ineffectually at Asian stereotypes and the ghettoization of Chinese-American actors. But the director, Justin Lin (who wrote the screenplay with Josh Diamond), lacks comic timing and the ability to hear jokes thud to the floor: a pornography setup with an irascible Ron Jeremy  feels even more tired than his trademark mustache.  Filled with chop-socky parody and too-tight jumpsuits, “Finishing the Game” saves its sharpest barbs for a sequence featuring the excellent Dustin Nguyen as a television cop saddled with the catch phrase “I ain’t gonna do your laundry.” Sadly his efforts (and those of a good-natured James Franco as his bemused partner), fall far short of rescuing a movie that, unlike its inspiration, never gets off the ground.
It's 1973. The dirt has barely settled on Bruce Lee 's grave, and the exploitation rush is on. A producer with some priceless footage, the only existent fragment from Lee's incomplete final opus, launches the search for a stand-in to complete the film. Finishing the Game  imagines the ensuing hunt in vintage-grainy faux-documentary trappings, flatly riffing on the boom of Lee knockoffs that surfaced in the wake of Bruce's last gasp and the typecasting ghettoization of Asian performers. (One actor, recounting his TV credits, leads us through sitcom after sitcom clip in which he invariably surfaces as the Chinese restaurant delivery boy.) But by setting the film in a deliberately distanced '70s, writer-director Justin Lin  gets the benefit of looking-back-in-superioritywould the inequalities have been so vastly different if the producers were trying to replace, say, Brandon  Lee? And hard as it is to believe that anyone thinks the comic possibilities of polyester arrow collars haven't been thoroughly strip-mined, those are the primary source of ostensible laffs here.
