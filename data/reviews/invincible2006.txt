Disney loves its inspiring, true-life sports stories � witness The Rookie
 and Gavin O'Connor's Miracle
, which even managed to recycle Disney lifer Kurt Russell � and Invincible
 is one more firm, competent notch in this most all-American of film genres. The story of Vincent Papale (Wahlberg), a lifelong football fan and backyard pigskin enthusiast who's plucked from the depressed and depressing anti-boom of mid-Seventies Philadelphia and offered a shot at being a bona fide Philadelphia Eagle, Invincible
 is like a thick, sweaty slab of NFL comfort food. Its themes are inspiring, all right: After Papale's wife (Lola Glaudini) leaves him unannounced, he's fired from his substitute-teaching position, and his beloved Eagles are abandoned by all but the hardiest fans as the losingest team this side of Seattle, Vincent takes a chance and attends an open try-out, itself the brainstorm of incoming coach Dick Vermeil (Kinnear). The event, which draws schlubby, beer-soacked wisenheimers from seemingly every ratty couch in town, is mocked even by the local newscasters, and so when the taciturn Papale actually makes the cut, no one's more surprised than he. Unfortunately, from that point on, Invincible
 is downright short on football, re-creating only a few clear sequences of gridiron prowess on Papale's part, although what it does show is tough, punchy stuff. Still, this is one footballing epic with nary an epic in sight, unless you count Vincent's growing relationship with New York Giants-loving Janet (Banks, charmingly sassy) and his boozy gang of hardscrabble Southie drinking-and-brawling buddies, winningly headed by peerless character actor Michael Kelly. This is more a film about beating the odds and sticking to your dreams no matter how lopsided they may appear in the light of day, a worthy sentiment but one that, here at least, seems to hamstring the picture's gridiron goals. Invincible
's greatest strength, actually, is derived from a wealth of excellent period detail and Core's fine, realistic cinematography. Set against the backdrop of the just-ended Vietnam War, a soul-crushing and economically blighted Philly economy, a looming strike by local Westinghouse workers, and shot through with some clever pop-music touchstones and an appropriately rousing score by Mark Isham, Core's film evokes the grim East Coast vibe that gripped what should have been a red, white, and blue bicentennial era. That the one guy who benefits most is a muscle-bound down-and-outter � shades of Rocky Balboa almost certainly intentional � only serve to give Wahlberg's coy performance that much more elegiac intensity. They weren't the Longhorns, sure, but those Eagles were pretty darn good for a moment.


``Invincible," another wedge of inspirational sports-movie cheese from Disney, is about Vince Papale, the unemployed but indefatigable 30-year-old Philadelphia-area native who hustled his way onto Dick Vermeil's Eagles in 1976. Mark Wahlberg plays Papale in the kind of earnest, hard-working performance that keeps a runny film tolerable. He's evolved into a dependable, entertaining star, the type about whom you can say, at last, ``This material is beneath him." But Wahlberg and the rest of the solid cast sell this ESPN equivalent of a Lifetime movie anyway.
Having been left by his wife and let go from his job as a substitute teacher, Vince finds himself borrowing money from his widowed father (Kevin Conway), a factory worker on strike. Nearly all Vince's time is spent with his boys down at the neighbor hood bar, whose owner (Michael Rispoli) gives Vince a pity bartending gig. They all play bruising tackle football in the dirty and muddy parking lots of South Philly, and eagerly await the day their beloved Iggles (as they're called in the local vernacular) shake off their blahs. (From the late 1960s and for most of the 1970s, the Eagles were a sub-.500 disaster.)
In an attempt to fix that, Vermeil (Greg Kinnear, well-meaning, but not terribly credible) is brought in from UCLA, and one of his first moves is to hold open tryouts, which Vince's buddies and his dad strongly urge him to attend. He does, and makes a good impression with his speed and determination. (In reality, Papale had a secure high school teaching job and was a wide receiver on a semi-pro team, which is how he caught Vermeil's attention. But where's the drama in that? Thank the movie's screenwriter, Brad Gann, for the Hollywood customizations.)
In any case, we see Vince putting his body through the grind of training camp, making it from one level of the tryout process to the next, until he's put on special teams coverage. At the time, Papale's hustle and his underdog status got him nicknamed Rocky, another local, albeit fictitious hero. (The Stallone movie had come out the same year.) But the makers of ``Invincible" forgo that fun fact, presumably for fear of redundancy.
The director Ericson Core, making his first feature, is also a cinematographer, so a lot of the camerawork in ``Invincible" is handsome and clever, like the shot of Wahlberg slumped on a bench that pulls away from him, onto the football field, and right into a play. Core seems as interested in the emotional rapport between the characters as he is in making sure the well-orchestrated football scenes sound like a war zone.
To give Vince something to hold besides a football, the filmmakers offer Janet (Elizabeth Banks), a romantically gun-shy New Yorker and teasing, trivia-filled Giants fan. These two take things slowly, and there's a simmer between Banks and Wahlberg that cuts through the relationship's trappings.
``Invincible," with its punny title, has the problem of drifting in and out of authenticity. A lot of it was shot on location in Philadelphia, but all the actors sound like they're from Brooklyn -- an acknowledgement that the Philadelphia accent is both unpretty and inimitable. Still, the men playing Papale's friends -- namely Rispoli, Kirk Acevedo, and Michael Kelly -- are all sweet in their own macho way. And so is the movie, in spite of its being shamelessly rigged for cheers.

Every so often, Mark Wahlberg gets hold of a role that lets him reconnect with what made him a star. Inevitably, these roles are all about becoming  a star: According to the Wahlberg myth, which replays Marky Mark's own transformation from thug rapper to Hollywood idol, he's a not-too-bright, no-frills dude, a trusting boy in a hunk's body, who gets shoved into the limelight  as a porn star, a rock star, or, in the heartfelt and gratifying new sports movie Invincible , a football star. What gives Wahlberg's innocent-roughneck version of Cinderella's rise its peculiar resonance is that even after his characters are famous, they can't quite shake the impostor syndrome: They are ordinary guys, gifted in one special way, trying to believe that they belong in the big arena.
Invincible , a true-life gridiron Rocky , casts him as Vince Papale, who in 1976 was a 30-year-old bartender in South Philly when he went in for an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. The movie is steeped to its beer belly in that '70s Eagles fever, with Vince and his buddies treating the team as an extended family, their mood swings cued to every win and loss. Since the team has been losing for years, they're depressed  until Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear), a new coach, gets brought in to turn things around. Wahlberg, with shaggy hair and a pumped bod he wears more convincingly than any actor, plays Vince as a guy who truly doesn't expect to win. That makes his rib-bruising triumph all the more believable and touching.

 Every two years the sports-underdog movie has become  an event for Walt Disney Pictures, whose “Remember the Titans” in 2000 was followed by “The Rookie” in 2002 and “Miracle” in 2004. The pattern continues with “Invincible,” the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a 30-year-old substitute teacher and part-time bartender who, in 1976,  was signed  to play for the struggling Philadelphia Eagles.  Battling inexperience, hostile teammates and an excess of slow-motion photography, Vince is soon being pummeled in summer training and body-slammed in a losing game against the Dallas Cowboys. As Jackson Browne mopes on the soundtrack and the football fans wilt in the stands, Vince’s embittered dad, Frank (Kevin Conway), cautions against optimism. “A man can only take so much failure,” he warns. Recognizing that the same is true of movie audiences, Disney piles on the uplift on and off the field.  Yet “Invincible” counters its predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. While a national energy crisis and the ghost of  Vietnam tug at the fringes of the story, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, focuses on the stained wallpaper in Vince’s apartment and the dingy camaraderie of the neighborhood bar. He understands that to the beleaguered working class in mid-1970’s Philadelphia, Vince’s story holds out hope for much more than just a winning game.  “Invincible” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Based on the almost impossible-to-believe true story of South Philadelphia barkeep Vince Papale's bid to make the roster of his beloved Philadelphia Eagles, "Invincible" has victory on its mind -- starting with its title. The latest entry in Disney's ever-growing stable of triumphant sports movies ("The Rookie," "Glory Road"), pic nevertheless seldom feels canned or the result of a mass-production assembly line. Although Giants fans may not like reliving one of their most ignominious days, aud appeal of this PG-rated inspirer should be wide and deep, cashing in on football fever just before the NFL season opens.
The film's most obvious sports movie connection is to "Rocky," with its mythic account of another Philly underdog who never gave up. Yet thanks to rookie director (and vet lenser) Ericson Core's handling and Mark Wahlberg's and Greg Kinnear's soberly professional and firmly grounded portrayals of Papale and Dick Vermeil, respectively, little here indulges in "Rocky"-like theatrics or overkill. (The exception is a secondary narrative that tries to shoehorn a love story to limited effect.)
If anything, "Invincible" begins on an unexpectedly poetic and solemn note, with a credit sequence that serves as a photographic elegy to a working-class urban neighborhood on the verge of economic and physical collapse in the mid-'70s. Symbolizing the failure are the Eagles, finishing another dreadful season in 1975 and drifting further from their winning tradition. Loss hits nobody harder than Vince, one of countless victims of local factory closures who is barely supporting his family with substitute teaching stints and nighttime bartending.
Vince's wife Sharon (Lola Glaudini) splits just as the Eagles hire Vermeil away from the Rose Bowl-winning UCLA Bruins. A bit too automatically, Vince then meets Janet (Elizabeth Banks), pretty cousin of bar owner Max (Michael Rispoli) and a lifelong New York Giants fan.
In a move that makes this past era appear quaint and romantic compared to the high-salaried, businesslike atmosphere of today's NFL, Vermeil calls for open tryouts prior to the '76 season -- thus welcoming in every Eagles fan nursing a long-held dream of donning the green uniform.
Vince is the only guy off the street to make the grade, and though he's the toast of Max's bar -- and a surprise to his worn-out dad Frank (the aptly cast Kevin Conway) -- he's a Pariah in the Eagles clubhouse.
Brad Gann's screenplay smoothly and convincingly tracks Vince's extremely uneven efforts to secure a toe-hold in the organization, as well as Vermeil's own uphill efforts to turn the franchise around. But the filmmakers are much less certain where to go when off the gridiron and practice field. The milieu around Max's reeks of old beer and a sweaty camaraderie, and Banks musters all of her endearing spirit for her role, but the budding tryst of Vince and Janet never escapes the shackles of pure formula screenwriting.
In a sign of Wahlberg's commitment to his part (apart from some visibly bulging arm and back muscles), Vince's repeated certainty that he'll be cut never feels less than real. Once in preseason games, the film thrusts the viewer into Vince's p.o.v. with gusto, whether running downfield as a special teams player or lying on the ground after brutal hits. While it doesn't reach the level of visceral -- or dramatic -- impact of "Friday Night Lights," "Invincible" generally gets the game's physical nature right, most ironically via Core's choice of slo-mo action shots.
On a personal roll after "Little Miss Sunshine" and, particularly, "Fast Food Nation," Kinnear impressively musters the full scope of Vermeil's forthrightness and toughness blended with unmistakable decency. Kinnear has quietly become one of the most reliable of American actors; much the same can be said of Wahlberg, here in a starring performance ideally suited to his utterly unpretentious and direct acting style.
Banks smartly uses her personality to fill in a fairly blank role, while Rispoli, Conway and Kirk Acevedo craft solid variations on their roles as blue-collar guys.
Handling both directing and cinematography duties, Core invests both with a clearly impassioned sense of place, period and perspective regarding this fanfare for common men. While his usually nighttime cityscapes are crusted in shadows and framed by aging frame and brick buildings on the verge of crumbling, his sun-drenched exterior settings on the field act like a shock of adrenaline.
His intelligent and artful collaborators include production designer Sarah Knowles and composer Mark Isham, both at the top of their game. Period song selections (with no music supervisor credit attached) are overplayed at times yet notably avoid the punk-versus-disco clash for a rich overview of the era's wondrous songwriting.

It's not like this boasts the most promising of credentials: a first-time filmmaker (Ericson Core), a first-time screenwriter (Brad Gann), a based-on-a-true-story script that more or less mimics Rudy 's underdog-to-top-dog story line, Mark Wahlberg  in a Boogie Nights  wig, and Greg Kinnear  as the as-if Dick Vermeil . It's constructed upon the clichés of the real-life-via-Hollywood  sports movie in which the unknown solider becomes the People's Champion, if only for a single game. It harbors no surprises as it tells the tale of Vince Papale  (Wahlberg), a 30-year-old part-time Philadelphia barkeep who played high school ball for one year, and none in college, and still wound up an Eagle in 1976. Yet Core and Gann  push past all that to extract from the clichés the larger, better story of a guy who has nothing to lose save for the dignity beaten out of him by pro ballers who want the guy dragged from the field on a stretcher. And so Invincible  joins Rocky  or Hoosiers  or Breaking Away  as one of the few satisfying sports movies in which the foundation built upon a heap of clichés holds strong.
