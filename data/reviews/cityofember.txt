Based on the young-adult novel by Jeanne Duprau, City of Ember
 digs deep but ends up feeling surprisingly cobbled-together from cinematic odds and ends that include everything from The Goonies
 to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
 to The City of Lost Children
. I haven't read the source novel (which is part of an ongoing series), but I'd wager that it packs more of a punch than this film, which, despite boasting a splendidly inventive production design and a comically villainous turn from a thoroughly engaged Murray, feels less like a timeless children's classic than a timely tale of living in the abyss. Set in the underground city of the title, City of Ember
 is, on the face of it, the story of two teens � Doon Harrow (Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Ronan) � coming of age just as the society around them begins an inexorable slide into darkness. In a prologue that's more than a little vague, we learn that the whole of mankind now lives below ground, having fled there after unspecified apocalyptic events topside have rendered the earth uninhabitable. This peaceable kingdom (sort of: Murray plays Mayor Cole although his actions are more regal) is powered by a massive generator and has been for 200 years, but now the patchwork power source is failing beyond repair, leaving both lights and lives in jeopardy. Enter Doon and Lina, who, following the classic tropes of inquisitive kids saddled with the salvation of the species, bypass their supposedly wiser elders (including Robbins as Doon's inventively in-denial father) and join forces to search for a fabled way out of Ember. With its crowded, rickety latticework of makeshift hovels and miles of tangled, life-sustaining electrical wiring, the very notion of a Con Edison-inspired subterranean world has a certain incandescent, retro charm, and the film also benefits from some snappy and strange character work from Landau and Smith. But, ultimately, it's undone by the overfamiliar nature of Doon and Lina's quest, the outcome of which, while breathlessly paced, is never really in question.


The city in "City of Ember" is about what you'd expect from a place where Bill Murray has been elected mayor. It's run-down and cheerfully sodden, a testament to the way things fall apart and time wounds all heels. City of Entropy, more like it. Oh, and it's miles underground and far in the future -- a final outpost of humanity centuries after some horrific catastrophe has destroyed the earth's surface.
Did I mention it's a family movie? You have to wonder what's in the water out in Hollywood; Doomsday is busting out all over. "City of Ember" lacks the vision and scope of "WALL-E," but it's based on a pretty good kids' book and it makes a pretty good "Twilight Zone" episode, with hope dangling at the end rather than one of Rod Serling's cosmic black jokes.
The lights are flickering and Ember is slowly dying, but the small, hermetic society it contains has no idea how to escape -- doesn't know there's anyplace to escape to. The surface world has been forgotten, even if our heroine, Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan, the changeling child from "Atonement") draws landscapes with skies, as if from genetic memory.
She and rangy young Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) find a key to the way out when Lina comes upon a metallic box created by "the builders" when Ember was established. It provides exit instructions, and as the two dash about the crumbling cityscape trying to put the pieces together, you may feel as if you've wandered into the old computer game "Myst."
The movie's production design is the real star, mulching "Metropolis," steampunk, Charles Dickens, and "The Matrix" into one beguilingly grotty underground universe. The human stars are overshadowed by all the clockworks. Murray makes an amusing moral slug of a mayor before he has to become a two-dimensional villain, and Tim Robbins, Martin Landau, Mary Kay Place, Mackenzie Crook, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste (as the only person of color in town; how'd those genetics work out?) take a back seat to the heavy-breathing plot and distressed ambience.
Much of the movie's small budget seems to have gone to the digital creation of giant mutant animals not in the book (you'll never look at a star-nosed mole the same way). For all its missed chances, though, "City of Ember" still casts a neat glow. The story's powered by the sense of discovery that moves classic quest tales -- the idea that there's something much, much bigger out there if only you can find it. It's a modest movie that understands the sky's the limit.


Given the talent involved  producer Tom Hanks , director Gil Kenan (Monster House  ), screenwriter Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands  )  City of Ember  should simply be better than the merely good-enough dystopian kids movie that it is. Especially because the elusive Bill Murray  pops up, playing the pot-bellied mayor of a dying underground city. He's fun, and the movie, slathered with grimy color, looks striking (think The City of Lost Children  for, well, children). But the story, which follows two kids who try to save their burg from blackouts, isn't well-executed, losing itself to unclear mythology and sci-fi gibberish. B–

 To watch the talents of Saoirse Ronan, the brilliant young actress from “Atonement,” being wasted in the science-fiction juvenilia of “City of Ember” is to be reminded that a powerful performance needs an equivalent screenplay. In “City of Ember,” she has nothing to work with.  Ms. Ronan, who is 14, and the dimple-chinned 24-year-old heartthrob Harry Treadaway portray Lina and Doon, best pals fleeing a subterranean dystopia guided by the kind of cryptic instructions found in the “National Treasure” movies. In Jeanne DuPrau’s children’s novel (the first of the four-part “Book of Ember” series), from which the film was adapted, Lina and Doon are dewy 12-year-old adventurers loaded with pluck but devoid of personality.  At moments “City of Ember,” directed by the British filmmaker Gil Kenan (“Monster House”), suggests a mild satire of end-of-days ideology, especially when Mary Kay Place appears as a prating, singsongy proselytizer for the status quo. Most of the time, however, it’s a whiz-bang kid’s film with neat gadgets and sound effects and an extended chase and escape sequence through underground rivers and tunnels. At only 95 minutes, the movie feels as though it had been shredded in the editing room. In Hollywood-speak, it has a weak second act.  Aside from its generic adventure music, the predominant noises are the clanks, squeaks and hisses of rusted machinery and steam pipes in the crumbling, labyrinthine underground city of Ember. This decrepit hole in the ground, from which there is no easy exit, is where humanity huddles in mounting discomfort under the autocratic rule of a series of mayors who dress like budget-conscious impersonators of Henry VIII.  The best things about this yarn are scenes of ominous grinding machinery of the kind found in railway yards, as well as several zany gadgets worthy of Rube Goldberg. The wittiest is a primitive telephone-answering machine that resembles the do-it-yourself hi-fi kits assembled by audiophiles in the early days of stereo. Because telephones no longer work in Ember, the machine is a quaint relic from another age.  “City of Ember” tosses in an unscary monster that suggests a giant, riled-up rooster on speed, as well as harmless, oversize creatures resembling beetles and cockroaches. Bill Murray droops through the movie as the fat, corrupt mayor of Ember, who maintains a secret bunker stocked with the canned goods that have become scarce. Even when affecting high dudgeon, Mr. Murray looks too bored to convey more than token menace. Tim Robbins is also on hand as Doon’s earnest, secretly rebellious father, who spends his days tinkering with exotic inventions.  The movie’s overriding message is anti-technological boilerplate. For 250 years Ember has been run by a generator. Now it is breaking down and no one knows how to repair it. Ominous blackouts regularly plunge the city into darkness and supplies are depleted. Because the people of Ember, forbidden to venture into the above-ground world, have forgotten their past, they face subterranean extinction. Ember recalls the more sophisticated world of E. M. Forster’s infinitely more evocative 1909 story, “The Machine Stops.”  But not to worry: the boundless resourcefulness of two curious, clean-cut adolescents full of gee-whiz enthusiasm may lead humanity back into the fresh air and sunlight.  “City of Ember” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild violence.

A fabulously designed underground metropolis proves more involving than the teenagers running through its streets in "City of Ember," a good-looking but no more than serviceable adaptation of Jeanne Duprau's 2003 novel. Director Gil Kenan's disappointing live-action follow-up to his enjoyable toon debut, "Monster House," shows promising flickers of visual invention throughout, but the dramatic sparks fail to ignite in this simple-minded exercise in juvenile dystopia. Families may show interest initially, but long-term B.O. prospects look so-so.
A portentous opening voiceover tells of the subterranean city of Ember, built to shelter English-speaking, predominantly Caucasian humanity from undisclosed apocalyptic events transpiring on Earth's surface. For reasons that have more to do with cool-sounding movie mythology than common sense, the builders decreed Ember would last for only 200 years -- an important fact that has unfortunately fallen out of public awareness as the story proper begins.
With the clock just about wound down to zero, Ember, powered by a massive generator that's seen better days, is experiencing random power outages and hostile incursions by giant bugs and the like. The fate of the city rests on the shoulders of two nosy, resourceful teens, Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan, "Atonement") and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway), who are quicker than the general populace to grasp that the time has come to leave Ember behind.
As red-caped Lina darts hither and yon in her capacity as a paid messenger, uncovering hidden clues and secret documents from the past, Kenan and d.p. Xavier Perez Grobet frame her movements in crane and tracking shots that showcase the city to striking widescreen effect. Martin Laing's nifty production design gradually reveals itself as a funhouse marvel of interconnected pipes and waterways, ladders, corridors and secret rooms; set decorator Celia Bobak's interiors are crammed with colored threads, bizarre contraptions and other clever throwaway details.
The film's visual design is so captivating and unusual that, at a certain point, you wish you could ditch Doon, Lina and her mute-cute little sister (twins Amy and Catherine Quinn) and explore Ember on your own for a couple hours. But Caroline Thompson's screenplay dutifully grinds its narrative gears and insists on turning these likable tykes into mini-saviors of mankind, pitting them against Ember's self-serving, fat-cat Mayor Cole (Bill Murray, giving a lazy performance as a lazy man).
Corrupt politicians, visiting terrorists, an energy crisis and (eventually) a food shortage -- "City of Ember" is nothing if not timely. But any potentially relevant subtexts are short-circuited by the lumbering nature of the story, which, despite the strenuous exertions of Andrew Lockington's score, generates neither suspense nor a sense of wonder. Kenan tries to goose the action by unleashing a hideous monster (looking like a cross between a sea anemone and a wild boar) that's not only far too frightening for young tots but also completely at odds with the otherwise hum-drum tenor of the proceedings.
Tim Robbins as Doon's dad and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Lina's friend add some grown-up warmth in their too brief appearances, and it's nice to see Martin Landau as a cantankerous pipe-worker. Climactic, Splash Mountain-style setpiece underlines the notion that "City of Ember" would have functioned better as a five-minute theme-park ride than as a 94-minute family film.
