         "Come Early Morning," the feature writing and directing debut of actress Joey Lauren Adams, falls prey to bits of psychoanalytic shorthand and narrative predictability, but it offers the rare, meaty role for an actress in her late 30s.
 
 Ashley Judd plays Southerner Lucy Fowler, a woman grappling with her fear of intimacy and some unwieldy emotional baggage, as short on self-esteem as she is long on drunken one-night stands. A truck-driving contractor by day who fancies herself as one of the boys, Lucy makes a habit of going home with a different guy every night, only to slip away in self-disgust at dawn. Abandoned by her emotionally distant father and bruised by her parents' divorce, Lucy is a walking billboard for denial, insisting to her roommate Kim (Laura Prepon) that she is just fine, thank you.
 


         






   Enter Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan), a kindhearted outsider who falls for Lucy. Deeply attracted to Cal but as wild as a stallion, Lucy struggles with her conflicting impulses, eventually embarking on a painful course of self-examination. She adopts a stray dog, accompanies her estranged father to church and begins to lower her guard.
 
 Avowedly mining bits of her own Arkansas background for inspiration, Adams has crafted a fully realized portrait of a woman in transition. Her dialogue feels sharp and authentic, its rhythm and cadence faintly echoing Kevin Smith, who directed Adams in her best-known film, 1997's "Chasing Amy." Like "Amy" it raises salient questions about gender roles and female promiscuity.)
 
 Adams, frustrated over the dearth of good female roles, originally wrote the film as an acting vehicle for herself. Having opted to direct instead, she found a fitting actress in Judd. It's a part that calls to mind Judd's screen debut as another woman searching for her identity in 1993's "Ruby in Paradise." The supporting players are equally strong, especially Tim Blake Nelson as Lucy's uncle and Diane Ladd as her stoic grandmother.
 
 Cinematographer Tim Orr has shot the North Little Rock locations with such attention to detail and texture that it's a shame Adams couldn't have resisted the temptation for cheap and easy metaphors, like the wounded stray Lucy takes in (after having been hurt herself in a bar fight). To its credit, the film doesn't end as tidily as it might have, implying instead that Lucy's journey toward self-discovery will be ongoing.

 In “Come Early Morning,” Ashley Judd returns to the Southern working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, “Ruby in Paradise,” to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. The career lesson it offers to an actor might be summed up in five words: Stick to what you know. In the case of Ms. Judd, who is no Meryl Streep, you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can’t take the trailer park out of the girl, so to speak.  Whether the setting is the coastline of the Florida Panhandle (“Ruby in Paradise”) or suburban Arkansas (“Come Early Morning”), this is a world in which Ms. Judd, who was brought up in eastern Kentucky, obviously feels at home. Disaster awaits her when she ventures too far afield, as in “De-Lovely,” the Cole Porter biography, in which she appeared frozen playing the composer’s high-society wife, Linda.  “Come Early Morning,” written and directed by the actress Joey Lauren Adams (“Chasing Amy”) and filmed in Ms. Adams’s hometown, North Little Rock, is an incisive but static and occasionally confusing character study of Lucy Fowler, a disheveled, hard-drinking single woman who has a day job as a contractor and a dissolute night life.  Off hours Lucy gets drunk at the Forge, a local bar where she hooks up for one-night stands with men she contemptuously abandons the following morning to go home to the cottage she shares with her more demure roommate, Kim (Laura Prepon). The only indications that Lucy’s heart hasn’t totally curdled are her rescuing of a stray puppy, her fondness for vintage country music and the respect her boss (Stacy Keach) has for her.  Ms. Judd reveals exactly the degree to which Lucy’s behavior is a self-perpetuating cycle sprung from her rage at her alcoholic, uncommunicative father, Lowell (Scott Wilson), a guilt-stricken womanizer and pathologically shy guitarist who has belatedly begun attending church services. Lucy seesaws between reaching out to him by accompanying him on Sunday mornings and throwing drunken tantrums when he doesn’t respond to her overtures.  As for the possibility of building a relationship with any of the men she picks up, Lucy has only to point to her grandparents (Diane Ladd and Pat Corley). Their marriage is a war of attrition that has settled into an ugly stalemate; they spend their days hurling insults back and forth in a ritual so shopworn that their lethal zingers have lost the power to wound.  These relatives, as well as the young men Lucy uses and discards, are viewed almost entirely through her eyes. If “Come Early Morning” were put on the stage, it would be a memory play whose peripheral characters appeared and disappeared in spotlights as Lucy mused aloud.  “Come Early Morning” is Ms. Adams’s filmmaking debut. She knows how these people speak and has a finely tuned awareness of their relationship to an environment where beer flows like water and the houses have cheap furniture and aluminum siding.  The minimal story follows Lucy as she meets and beds a new man, Cal (Jeffrey Donovan), who is a cut nicer than her usual hookups. Cal, who just moved to the area and is doing roofing for his uncle, treats Lucy with a courtliness that both infuriates and embarrasses her. He takes her frog fishing, cooks up a frog’s-leg feast and enlists her help in painting toy models of old cars (his passion). Her defenses begin to crumble.  The principal question hovering through this teensy but pungent slice of life is whether Lucy’s self-destructive mechanism will kick in. And if it does, how soon will the patience of her potential knight in shining armor wear thin? The mixture of Southern machismo and tenderness in Mr. Donovan’s performance makes his working-class charmer almost too good to be true, or least too good for Lucy, whom Ms. Judd plays with a vindictive edge that risks making her unsympathetic. And that takes courage.  “Come Early Morning” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity, sexual situations and a bar brawl.

Thesp Joey Lauren Adams ("Chasing Amy") makes her feature writing-directing debut with "Come Early Morning," a film that feels half therapeutic exercise and half the sort of low-key down-home regional drama that was a U.S. indie staple a couple of decades back. Coming full circle in a sense from her original Sundance breakthrough with "Ruby in Paradise," Ashley Judd confidently plays a Southern woman who urgently needs to pull her life together. But, despite her efforts and those of a generally talented cast, pic just pokes along and offers nothing out of the ordinary in terms of drama, characterization or insight. Judd's presence notwithstanding, this one would be more at home on small- than on bigscreens.
A competent Arkansas construction contractor by day, Judd's Lucy is a wild, drunken woman by night, specializing in one-night stands. With a family legacy of boozing and infidelity, Lucy is challenged by newcomer Cal (Jeffrey Donovan, who deftly endows his good ol' boy with unexpected sensitivity) to have a sober, sustained relationship, but it's tough. Writing and directing are elementary, and even ace indie lenser Tim Orr can do little to supply visual distinction.

By dawn at the latest, as per the title, Lucille (Ashley Judd ) will squeeze back into her jeans and flee another stranger's house, the screw-'em-and-split routine having something to do with her emotionally unavailable dad (Scott Wilson ). But she never counted on hooking up with Cal (Jeffrey Donovan ), a very, very  nice guy who lends a slow hand in turning their one-night stand into a week-long recline. Judd's typically lived-in performance and the authentic Arkansas locationscramped bars, dusty roadshelp vaguely distinguish a movie that comes on like a minor-key reprise of Judd's breakthrough Ruby in Paradise  and every other rural indie melodrama to grace Sundance since.
