         Wander into a screening of "Miss Potter" a few minutes late to see Renée Zellweger, in a long skirt and loose bun, scribbling in a notebook while musing to herself in British-accented voice-over and you might easily mistake it for another sequel. Could it really be "Bridget Jones III: Edwardian Spinster?"
 
  Well, no. It's "Miss Potter," an oddball rendering of the life of Beatrix Potter, the world-famous creator of Peter Rabbit and one of the bestselling children's book authors of all time. Written (originally as a musical) by lyricist and musical theater director Richard Maltby Jr. and directed by "Babe's" Chris Noonan, the movie is at once a flagrant piece of kitsch and an unexpectedly affecting story about an individual overcoming personal tragedy and brutally restrictive circumstances by talent and force of will.
 


         






    From the moment she appears on screen, Zellweger imbues the character with many of the same flinchy, purse-lipped mannerisms she brought to Bridget, but it soon becomes clear that Beatrix is no ordinary singleton. Thirty-six and unmarried in 1902 (though, unaccountably, the movie makes her 32 the year she published "The Tale of Peter Rabbit," because, let's face it, nobody wants to see a movie about a 36-
year-old spinster, there are limits), 
Miss Potter talks to her illustrations as though they were real, and the adorably anthropomorphized woodland animals and bonnet-wearing fowl (to which she referred, when speaking with other adults, as her "friends") blink and scamper right back at her. This is meant to be enchanting, but kill the condescending fairy-dust score by Nigel Westlake and the next scene could easily take place at the local asylum.
 
  The movie begins with the publishing company of Frederick Warne and Sons agreeing to take on Miss Potter's "bunny book" as a practice project for their younger brother just joining the business. The brother turns out to be Ewan McGregor. Things start looking up for Miss Potter. Norman Warne (McGregor) takes Beatrix's characters as seriously as she does and shepherds "Peter Rabbit" to unexpected success. Beatrix and Norman's sister Millie (Emily Watson) become close friends, and eventually Norman proposes — which doesn't sit well with Beatrix's wealthy, snobbish parents.
 
  "Miss Potter" is peppered with flashbacks of Beatrix as a child (she's played by Lucy Boynton), when she apparently wrote and drew as well as she did as an adult. Despite good performances by Boynton and Oliver Jenkins as Beatrix's brother Bertram, the scenes add little more than gratuitous adorability to the movie as a whole and saddle what turns out to be a sad and ultimately inspiring story with unnecessary and simplistic psychological back story. Take away the childhood scenes, the animated sequences, the treacly score and the unaccountable forced cheer and "Miss Potter" might have been formidable. As it is, it's a maddeningly confused movie that seems to have no idea of what it wants to be when it grows up.
 
  Still, the movie is redeemed by excellent performances. McGregor, in particular, lights up the film, and in her scenes with him, when she is not forced to interact with watercolor rabbits, Zellweger seems to wake up from a long, cranky nap. His Norman is a pure, puppyish innocent with a bounding enthusiasm for Potter's work. "I put your drawings aside with great reluctance!" he tells her on the first day he comes to her house to talk business. Watson is funny and endearing as Millie, who immediately recognizes Beatrix as a kindred spirit unlike the other unmarried daughters in their circle, who "sit around gossiping all day and unaccountably bursting into tears."
 
  These moments make "Miss Potter" worth seeing, if you can get past the feeling that you're watching a Merchant Ivory film trapped in a Disney movie's body.

As a child I couldn't stand Beatrix Potter , and not just because her cute, jacketed critters bored me senseless. I loved tough children's tales, but Potter's stories were manipulative and twisted, filled with punitive authority figuresMrs. Rabbit is a prissy scold, Farmer McGregor  an evil-tempered loutvisiting tight-lipped moral justice on insipid mice, bunnies, and the truly insufferable Jemima Puddle Duck. Small wonder that poor Peter Rabbit  cowers under the bedclothes on all those quaint plates and mugs that fuel the multimillion-dollar Potter industry.
How the Potter franchise continues to flourish in this age of permissive parenting is either a mystery or a case of marketing trumping ideology, but surely there's a meaty drama to be made about the dark forces that drove this dyed-in-the-wool Victorian. Director Chris Noonan  and screenwriter Richard Maltby Jr.  are having none of it. Blackness may have lurked within the Potter heart, but you'd never know it from Miss Potter , which shifts the burden of ill humor onto the lady author's petit bourgeois mother (the excellent Barbara Flynn ), thus freeing Renée Zellweger  to perk up Beatrix into a chipper cross between Bridget Jones  and Mary Poppins .
Bronzed and russet all over, with a quaintly autumnal production design to match, Zellweger's Beatrix bustles about, flashing the Zellweger sour-lemons smile, dispensing maidenly charm as she shepherds her little tales from soup to nuts with only grudging help from a whiskered family of publishers, save for the youngest brother, Norman  (a wishy-washy Ewan McGregor ). Smiling nervously as if not to unseat the mustache precariously affixed to his upper lip, this  Mr. McGregor does nothing to convince us that the pallid swain is the love of Beatrix's life, his untimely death withering her creative juices until a sensible country solicitor (Lloyd Owen ) restores her to pink-cheeked vivacity.
By most accounts, Potter was a serious workaholic monomaniacally devoted to the purity of her vision. Undaunted, Noonan and Maltby are determined to squeeze her life into a run-of-the-mill romance in which love heals all wounds. Voiceover and flashbacks work overtime to convince us of Beatrix's untended childhood, though it's far from clear that she was any lonelier than other well-to-do Victorian tykes, most of whom were left to the tender mercies of nannies and governesses while their parents scratched away at the nouveau-mercantile pecking order. Potter's parents may have been social climbers, but there's scant evidence that poor Mrs. P. deserved to be retooled as the philistine nag on whom Mrs. Rabbit may have been modeled.
And so we leave Beatrix, a merry chipmunk, scribbling and sketching in the sun by a suspiciously blue lake in a part of England known for its unrelenting rain. In real life, she married her solicitor, gave up writing, and devoted herself to buying up half the land in the Lake District from under the filthy mitts of marauding developers. I doubt whether Potter, a woman who battled her way to fame, wealth, and a pioneering spot in the conservation movement in a world where women mostly sat and sewed, bore any resemblance to the film's serenely girlish figure. This may be why the only bright spots in Miss Potter are the all-too-sparing special effects, in which Peter and his pals come to life, rise up, and quite understandably scuttle away from their wimpy creator.
