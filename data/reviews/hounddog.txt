There's no way Hounddog  ain't a greasy gumbo of a mellerdrammer (sorry for the language, that's just the effect of too much Southern Gothic cliché gettin' to me).   But Deborah Kampmeier's pulp fiction  about a country girly devoted to the music of Elvis Presley in a 1950s backwoods located somewhere near Tennessee Williamsland  might have stood a shot at being judged on its own Black Snake Moan  terms had it starred some interesting, unknown girl, and not the famous young phenom Dakota Fanning.  Then again, would this arthouse goo have gotten made if Fanning's adult team hadn't agreed it was a fine idea to let their champ wiggle in her underpants?
As it is, Hounddog  is destined to be  described in shorthand, now and forever, as the one where Dakota Fanning Gets Raped. Even so, that violence is only a small,   relatively tastefully handled episode in a drama heaped with clichés like...like a big ol' plate of grits. Here, in one swamp, is a drunk, brain-damaged Daddy (David Morse); a twisted, sin-patrolling Granny (Piper Laurie);  a battered, sad, sexy lady (Robin Wright Penn), a Wise Black Man (Afemo Omilami) who  teaches our heroine about the real, black man's blues music (none of this Elvis hooey);  and lots of snakes. Under the circumstances, Fanning is remarkably collected and even dignified. As for the rest of the gang,  they ought to be returned to sender.

 Save for the scandalized sound bites that surrounded its initial unveiling at last year’s Sundance Film Festival, “Hounddog” might have fizzled quietly on the fringes of movieland leaving few traces beyond  Dakota Fanning’s astonishing performance.  Instead, this overripe tale of innocence lost has become one of notoriety found. Set in rural Alabama in the 1950s, the movie clings protectively to Lewellen (Ms. Fanning), a gangly preteenager  whose only family is an abusive Daddy (David Morse) and a Bible-spouting Grammie (Piper Laurie). To ease her loneliness Lewellen dreams of singing with Elvis. She warbles “Hound Dog” to all and sundry  — quite well, as it happens — and wriggles her skinny body in imitation of her idol.  Daddy, of course, loves it, but despite the script’s intimations of incest and Lewellen’s guilelessly provocative squirming, “Hounddog” never comes close to being salacious. The much-maligned deflowering, when it finally occurs, is probably the film’s most accomplished scene, composed of thoughtful cutaways and relying for resonance on a single, lingering shot of the girl’s traumatized expression.  The only exploitation here is that of skilled actors lending their gifts to a less than worthy project. Though the lovely Robin Wright Penn, playing Daddy’s fragile girlfriend (and perhaps sister), juggles a black eye and a preposterous monologue with aplomb, Mr. Morse has little to do except hang around looking gormless. Ms. Laurie, for her part, simply recycles the God-fearing, liquor-loving harridan she perfected in “Carrie,” ranting against “devil music” and Lewellen’s twitching hips.  Most abused of all is Afemo Omilami as a gentle black neighbor who appears, genielike, whenever a white character requires spiritual guidance or a jolt of folksy wisdom. “You got to fill all those empty, hollow places,” he advises Lewellen, patiently milking the venom from rattlers and humans alike. The empty places in the script (by Deborah Kampmeier, who also directs), however, remain stubbornly vacant: cicadas chirp, chickens squawk and rutting men grunt, but nothing can salvage a narrative that’s all symbol and no substance, every rain shower and batch of homemade jelly loaded with mythic significance.  As snakes dangle in the trees, slither in the river and nestle in Lewellen’s crotch, the audience is left to speculate on whether her attacker will be good-for-nothing Daddy, his brain now stir-fried by God’s lightning bolt, or the aw-shucks milkman, leering beneath a devilish dose of acne. Yet compared with, say, the kicky, visceral pulp of Craig Brewer’s “Black Snake Moan” — an aria of Southern excess — “Hounddog” is never more than a sluggish dawdle from shack to swimmin’ hole and back again.  Like many a Deep South saga before it, the movie believes in the curative role of the blues, the symbolic role of reptiles and the strictly supportive role of African-Americans. If anyone were going to be scandalized, it shouldn’t have been the Catholic League and child protection advocates.   It should have been the Humane Society and the N.A.A.C.P.  “Hounddog” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has booze, buttocks, bruises and bad words.

"Hounddog" is an indigestible gumbo of Southern Gothic ingredients seasoned with snake oil, biblical hash and thoroughly unpalatable spice. Deborah Kampmeier's second feature became notorious even before its premiere as the "Dakota Fanning rape movie." The problem, however, is not that pivotal scene, which is tastefully handled, but the fact that, after a reasonably atmospheric, if uneventful, first hour, the picture runs right off the rails. Aside from Fanning and the controversy, the film has nothing going for it commercially; sales are likely due to the cast, but paying customers will be scarce.
Set in the 1950s, Kampmeier's script, which she struggled to get made for 10 years, recycles a laundry list of staples from the Southern literary repertoire: dissolute white trash dad, Bible-quoting granny, intimations of incest, cocky good ol' boys, the good Negro, the primacy of the blues and Elvis infatuation. Add some over-the-top symbolism about snakes in the Garden of Eden and the violation of innocence and you've got "Hounddog," which repeats the famous song so often (in various versions) that you leave not wanting to hear it again for a year.
Opening interludes are drenched in swampy sweat and sex, as barely prepubescent kids Lewellen (Fanning) and Buddy (Cody Hanford) scamper through the woods to find a secluded place where Buddy can show Lewellen his privates in exchange for a kiss. Lewellen shortly explains that one day she's going to kill her daddy and cut off his privates in the bargain.
When the spirited, irrepressible Lewellen gets back to the rural shack she calls home, it's clear her ratty-looking daddy (David Morse) has just finished having sex with a new woman on the scene (Robin Wright Penn), a character referred to as "Strange Lady" in the credits. Also in residence is Granny (Piper Laurie), whose conversational range extends only to observing how evil her sinning relatives are. The only thing missing is a cameo by Carroll Baker as a notorious, long-lost aunt.
With scarcely enough narrative line to be called a plot, the film advances with all the momentum of a long hot summer. Lewellen continually bumps and grinds in Elvis fashion, to the distinct disapproval of Granny, and schemes with Buddy to get tickets to an upcoming local Elvis concert; the two kids play grown-up, dressing up and pretending to drink and smoke, with her kissing him a lot; a little rich girl nicknamed Grasshopper (Isabelle Fuhrman) arrives for the summer at the mansion nearby, giving Lewellen a rival for Buddy's attention, and Daddy returns from a spell away only to get blasted off his tractor by a bolt of lightning, which turns him into a babbling idiot.
There's nothing terribly compelling about these preliminaries; it's all a tad studied and familiar, but the performers, and Fanning especially, bring color and energy to the characters, and the atmospherics are strong, thanks notably to the light-dappled, discreetly framed lensing of Ed Lachman and Jim Denault (Lachman was the original d.p. but had to leave after two weeks due to a prior commitment; Denault shot for four weeks and, after a break, gaffer Stephen Thompson took over for the final stanza.)
The big scene arrives nearly an hour in, as Lewellen is lured into a barn, tricked and raped by a minor character one can identify from his initial entrance as bad news. It's entirely clear what's going on, but Kampmeier handles it with finesse, keeping Lewellen offscreen most of the way but filling the soundtrack with her screaming. It's over relatively quickly, and when Lewellen is finally seen in the immediate aftermath, she looks drained of color, her youth and innocence suddenly vanished.
From here, one wants to stick close to Lewellen to study her reactions and decisions. Instead, the Strange Lady returns to distracting effect, Daddy starts running naked through town, Granny totes her shotgun around, and a plane's worth of snakes begins materializing everywhere, a matter tended to by a wise black man (Afemo Omilami), a horse trainer who endeavors to restore a measure of physical and psychic health to both Strange Lady and Lewellen.
To reference a certain Southern author to whom Kampmeier is clearly not oblivious, there is much sound and fury here signifying very little, and loads of vile behavior, beginning with the rape but scarcely confined to it, to scant point. The almost desperate dredging for themes and meaning in the late-going reps a sad and tedious spectacle.
In line with the director's seriousness of intent, the actors all go for broke. Fanning does nothing to diminish one's regard for her spectacular talents, even with such suspect material. Morse jumps bravely into the deep end to embrace his cracked role, while Wright Penn's part is a muddle. Hanford gamely tries to keep pace with thoroughbred Fanning in their numerous scenes together, while chanteuse Jill Scott gets off the best rendition of the title song in an impromptu jam with local musicians.

Having lurched through a gantlet of Sundance jeers, recuts, and release delays, writer/director Deborah Kampmeier 's Hounddog —at least as far as the press notes indicate (urgently)—now exists as a version different from the one that met such derision. One imagines, however, that the song—both the hip-swiveler of the title and the Southern Gothic story of FUBAR families, innocence, and, yes, child rape that it brackets—remains more or less the same. Dakota Fanning  plays 12-year-old Lewellen, and while the role will test the patience of even the staunchest survival-parable lovers, Fanning's extraordinary poise finally trumps precocity. "I'm gonna kill my daddy one day," she declares in the first scene, and why not? Played by David Morse , he's an inconstant brute with a wardrobe full of wife-beaters, in case there was any doubt. The symbolism is as clobbering as the blows that send Lewellen's maybe-mommy (Robin Wright Penn ) reeling: Snakes abound, notably in a grotesque, crotch-slithering dream sequence. Shot in mellow green and gold, Hounddog  manages an engaging summer sweetness in its early scenes, as Lewellen plots to obtain a ticket to a local Elvis  concert, but in the wake of the inadvertent betrayal that leads to her now-notorious rape (a sequence that, ironically, seems to have lost the horrific impact it needs), the film turns listless. By the time Lewellen gets tutored in the white-girl blues by a band of magical Negroes, it has fulfilled its risible potential.
