Nothing sets a girl's heart racing more than having her dreamboat name a new world after her. So when Sir Walter Raleigh returns from an expedition and entrances the Virgin Queen with stories of his discoveries and how he named Virginia for her, even the most uncommon of girls � a middle-aged queen who, decades ago, vouchsafed her celibacy for the good of her people � is likely to be caught in a bit of a swoon. Such is the case in Kapur's sequel to his 1998 film, Elizabeth
, which also starred Blanchett in her breakthrough role as England's monarch Elizabeth I. Whereas Kapur's original film concluded with Elizabeth's vow of celibacy and focused on her transformation from girl to monarch, his sequel picks up in 1585, the 27th year of her reign. The tone of this film is melodramatic, hypothesizing the unconsummated love between Elizabeth (Blanchett) and Raleigh (Owen). Adding salt to the wound, Elizabeth tosses her comely lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton (Cornish) at Raleigh, whose attention becomes so diverted that he ironically falls in love with Bess. Ooh � catfight in the court � almost. Blanchett, however, is such an amazing actor that she renders even this foolishness watchable. There is also military intrigue as King Philip II of Spain (Moll�) launches his armada at England in order to save the country from the Protestantism of Henry VIII's daughter and make Europe again safe for Catholicism. Dramatic battle sequences follow. There's also the sidebar plot involving Elizabeth's doomed-to-be-headless half-sister Mary (Morton), although there's either too little or too much of Mary's predicament presented here to make much of an impression. And, of course, there is the standard-issue court intrigue as Catholic assassins, henchmen of Philip and Mary, plot to obliterate the Anglican menace. Kapur's shots are beautifully composed, and the costumes and decor add to the film's delicious production design. Despite good performances all around, particularly the ever-brilliant Blanchett, Elizabeth: The Golden Age
 is a gilded ornament, speculative and uninterested in much besides this queen's matters of heart.


Historians might demand a little more history from "Elizabeth: The Golden Age." But soap opera loyalists could hardly ask for more soap. Having ascended the throne at the close of 1998's "Elizabeth," Cate Blanchett's Virgin Queen is ensconced in leadership and wigs. The year is 1585, more than two decades after her coronation, and she's determined to protect from invasion both her English kingdom and her purity. But it won't be easy. Spain angles for a holy war. And Clive Owen wants, well, what any seafaring guy just back from discovering the New World wants: more undiscovered territory.
He plays Walter Raleigh, the peculiarly tanned explorer with the bedroom eyes who wins Elizabeth's attention after he chivalrously throws his rag over a puddle. Until this moment, there's no urgent reason for this movie to exist. But then the screenwriters, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, and the director, Shekhar Kapur, come clean. To hell with the first movie's thoughtful consideration of a young woman's new political power or that a good second film would show how well she's been marinated in authority over the past 23 years: Let's rip some bodices. Or let's talk about it, anyway.
To atone for any lustful urges, we get a patina of political intrigue. The movie makes dutiful overtures to the cabals and shadowy maneuvering abroad. Spain's King Philip II (Jordi Mollà) hankers to return Protestant England to its Catholic roots. He's surrounded by other cloaked gents and snivels shamelessly, like a cartoon villain. Meanwhile, Samantha Morton has nothing more to do than curl her lip and heave her bosom as Mary Stuart, Elizabeth's cousin who is so murderously desperate to be queen she hires a gang of Jesuit assassins. And Geoffrey Rush reprises his role as Francis Walsingham, the queen's scheming defenseman and homeland security adviser. This is all rather dull. Where's the political sophistication that made the first movie slightly more interesting? That was a decent game of chess. "The Golden Age" is checkers.
You stick with it only as an act of camp. The movie clearly finds Elizabeth's commitment to chastity her most stunning achievement. And it gets good, cheap laughs out of her sacrifice. When Raleigh tells the queen, he's named Virginia in her honor, she bellows and says, "If I were to be married, what will you call it? Conjugia?" (It's funnier to hear Blanchett say it.)
In "Elizabeth," Blanchett was an ingénue in a movie about a girl learning on the job. By the time of "The Golden Age," she's become the sort of star who's comfortable hamming it up and injecting a lot of supercilious humor into a part without sacrificing all the character's wisdom. (Her eyes roll like a bowling ball.) According to my math, the queen is about 47 now, and knows a thing or two about a thing or two. Except, alas, that thing. And, oh, how temptation tortures her.
Having remained single all these years by refusing to marry for politics or propriety (there's an amusing sequence with a collection of international suitors), Elizabeth finds a man, in Raleigh, whom she loves. But she can't bring herself to succumb fully, as if purity is the battery that powers her empire. Kapur provides a scene of the two riding alongside each other that feels like an apt if cruel metaphor. To keep him close, the queen dispatches her nubile lady-in-waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish). Terrible idea. But the film has its best fun with the sexual dynamic among the three of them.
Kapur is not a natural moviemaker, although some of the more random disco-y shots suggest a man who longs to make videos for Cher. Otherwise, the close-ups are too close, the aerial shots too high. Shadows still equal evil intrigue. And the big war is done mostly as a haphazardly assembled montage of incendiary chaos. But in those sequences, Owen does everything in his power - swinging from ropes, peering over the side of a ship, swimming underwater in slow-motion - to convince us it's 1935 and that he might be the second coming of Errol Flynn.
And as the world turns and the Spanish Armada burns, there is time to contemplate the beautiful intricacies of Alexandra Byrne's costumes - their outlandishness, too. (The queen's battle armor is nothing less than 16th-century C-3PO.) You might be inclined to think of names for Elizabeth's various wigs (I saw the Richard Simmons, the Streisand, and the Big Bang) and admire her triumphant combat stances. My favorite has her positioned at the edge of a cliff at dawn, nose in the air, a touch of romance in her gaze while she watches ship after ship afire - not unlike her heart. A penny for her thoughts would purchase, "I love the smell of char in the morning."


         When we last saw the Virgin Queen (as incarnated by Cate Blanchett), it was 1558 (in 1998) and she had just completed her transformation from girl monarch to royal icon. The transformation that took place in "Elizabeth" seemed to stem from two wise decisions: remaining unmarried and switching to kabuki makeup. "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" (a title that strikes me as a missed opportunity -- something like "Elizabeth I:II: Caged Heat" would have better captured the essence) gives us the imperious and always majestic Blanchett as the middle-aged queen, last portrayed at that age by Helen Mirren and Judi Dench.
 
 It's about 30 years later, and she's hardly aged a day. How does she do it? By sheer force of fantasy, apparently -- the same force that has led director Shekhar Kapur to give us Queen Elizabeth as a cross between Joan of Arc and Joan Crawford, Sir Walter Raleigh as a bodice-ripping pirate sprung from the cover of a supermarket romance novel, King Philip II of Spain as a mincing lulu with a bizarre politico-erotic fixation on the virgin ("Whore!") queen, and the battle against the Spanish Armada as a series of chopped-together outtakes from "Pirates of the Caribbean."
 


         






   It's 1585, and Elizabeth has ruled for three decades. Mary Stuart of Scotland (Samantha Morton) has her eye on the throne, as does Elizabeth's  brother-in-law King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla), who'd like to see England ruled by a Catholic again, and is conspiring with Mary to take over the throne.
 
 Elizabeth's advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) is pressuring her to marry -- England needs the money and the military support -- and the realm is crawling with traitors. What's a girl to do?
 
 Into the scene strides Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), sex in hose and breeches and fresh from the New World bearing tubers, tobacco and pirated Spanish gold. The queen is amused by his exploits and Raleigh is flattered that she is amused, but that's as far as the romance goes. Raleigh moves on to unlace the corset of Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), Elizabeth's favorite lady-in-waiting. When the queen finds out Bess is pregnant and the couple have secretly married, she banishes Bess and throws Raleigh in prison.
 
 Whatever semblance of restraint Kapur showed in the first movie is flung over an Irish bluff here after Elizabeth slowly evolves into some kind of 16th-century Michael Corleone. The transformation occurs soon after she reluctantly orders her cousin Mary's execution on Walsingham's insistence, and gives way to some of the silliest, soapiest bombast to hit the screen since "The Phantom of the Opera."
 
  "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" gives new meaning to "costume drama" in that it is a drama primarily about costumes. But the drama is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the temple.
 
 Kapur is so invested in transforming his heroine into a comic book heroine that he reduces her antagonists to caricatures. Mary Tudor is a hysterical, dim-witted turkey; Mary Stuart a twitchy snake; Philip a sweaty creep; his emissaries and soldiers talk like they're trying not to flunk 7th-grade Spanish. Raleigh, meanwhile, is presented as a Byronic love guru, spouting homilies ("Why be afraid of tomorrow when today is all we have?") at every opportunity. Not a moment is left un-underscored by a soaring chorale, not a kiss is left un-backgrounded by a smoldering fire, not a pose left unstruck aboard a flaming vessel in the heat of battle.
 
 Elizabeth's decision not to marry allowed her to retain control of England -- had she married, this power would have transferred to her husband, along with the fate of her Protestant subjects and her father's money. But this being 2007, we're invited to reconsider the queen as Sad Career Lady.
 
 After her wax likeness is installed at Madame Tussauds' (I didn't know what else to make of the scene in which she stands stock-still, hands outstretched, slowly turning on a Lazy Susan), she visits her former lady-in-waiting and her unrequited love, now free from prison. Gazing into the eyes of their baby, she muses, "I am called the Virgin Queen. Unmarried, I have no master. Childless, I am mother to my people. God give me the strength to bear this mighty freedom." It's an actual quote, with a slight tweak. That "freedom" used to be "burden." Best to take it with a grain of salt, though it makes you wonder if the queen herself wouldn't find the insinuation somewhat medieval.
 

 
 "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" MPAA rating: PG-13. Running time: 1 hour, 54 minutes. In general release.   

Elizabeth: The Golden Age  takes place nearly three decades after the events that established the 25-year-old as queen of England in 1558. It arrives nine years after the success of Elizabeth , director Shekhar Kapur's bold, Eastern-influenced historical drama about monarchy and feminine personhood, and a lifetime  in celebrity years  after Cate Blanchett's blazing performance in the original title role established her as one of the international screen's most shimmering presences. Too bad Kapur's new, glittering sequel also shows up feeling prematurely old, square, and cautious. A production of exquisitely complicated wigs and expensively grand wide shots, it pauses often to admire its own beauty, leery of messing with previous success. The queen, who goes to war and defeats the mighty Spanish Armada before the last trumpet blares, continues to take risks. But The Golden Age  plays it safer now that the star is a Star.
The irony is, if ever there were an actress willing and even eager to break free of the mystique ascribed to her, it's Blanchett. Now in her late 30s (never mind that the monarch she plays, in her early 50s, aged even faster in a century lacking good preventive dentistry), Blanchett throws herself into mature queenliness with an unfiltered passion all the more precious for its fiery sincerity; she values the old-Hollywood belief that characters can grow to fit their destinies rather than adjusting their destinies to suit their flavorful personality quirks. And she is commanding as a woman who now knows what she must do for the greater good, however much it contradicts her own personal desires.
This Elizabeth, a Protestant ruler in an era of rising Catholic fundamentalism, faces down aggression from a proselytizing Spanish Catholic king (Jordi Molla) and her own traitorous Catholic cousin Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton). Attracted to the dash and passion of the adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), she accepts her kingdom's rules against union with a commoner and watches in pain as he falls for her own favored lady-in-waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish). Guided by her wily court adviser Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush, back again for satisfying spymastery), she makes difficult choices and big rallying speeches. (''Let them come with the armies of Hell,'' she roars before the armada showdown. ''They will not pass!'' Any echo of Russell Crowe-ish valor is probably not unintentional, since Gladiator  scripter William Nicholson joins returning screenwriter Michael Hirst on the job.)
Owen is the right man to meet Blanchett on a playing field of contradictions. Like the woman who plays the queen, he is an actor uninterested in his own beauty, or rather, interested in messing with its expectations. But something has happened between Elizabeth  then and now. And since the fault doesn't lie in these stars, I have to conclude that it lies in a current notion of audience tastes: that we are underlings who require a literalism that tamps down Kapur's more daring instincts for East-meets-West historical interpretation. E 1 was plenty opulent, but E 2 approaches the simplistic in its reliance on great gowns to catch the eye and waves  nay armada-drowning torrents  of intrusive musical score to direct a viewer's attention. E 1 demonstrated the historical competition between Protestantism and Catholicism for dominance of English statehood, but E 2 slips into something approaching troubling caricature  a shorthand assumption of the Catholic cause as primarily the province of scheming zealots. To telegraph the queen's awakening hots for Sir Walter, the two engage in that old faithful visual substitute for sex, the galloping simultaneous horseback ride; to emphasize her leadership abilities, Elizabeth prepares for a climactic showdown with Spain by letting down her tresses and borrowing from Joan of Arc's armor armoire. (Or is it Russell Crowe's?)
In the midst of all this 1980s-style Masterpiece Theatre ism, meanwhile, one young performer sticks out as a reminder that Elizabeth: The Golden Age  is, after all, a picture also made with a concern for today's younger tastes in self-actualization. As her majesty's royal favorite, Bess, Cornish (soon to appear in Stop Loss  opposite Ryan Phillippe) comes across at every moment as a modern girl testing her girl power. Peach-toned and Australian like Blanchett, and poised in E 2 for larger future fame the way Blanchett was in E 1, the 25-year-old Cornish is a star with Now appeal synthesized into a production no longer sure what it wants to say about Then.

A kitsch extravaganza aquiver with trembling bosoms, booming guns and wild energy, “Elizabeth: The Golden Age” tells, if  more often shouts, the story of the bastard monarch who ruled England with an iron grip and two tightly closed legs. It’s the story of a woman, who, as played by the irresistibly watchable Cate Blanchett as David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust period, sublimated her libidinal energies through court intrigue until she found sweet relief by violently bringing the Spanish Empire to its  knees. But that’s getting ahead of this story, which begins in 1585 when Queen Elizabeth hit  52, though the film seems to put her closer to 38, Ms. Blanchett’s actual age.  The blurring of fact and fancy is, of course, routine with this kind of opulent big-screen production, in which  the finer points of history  largely take a back seat to personal melodrama and  lavish details of  production design and costumes. In this regard  “The Golden Age” may set a standard for such  an adulterated form: it’s reductive, distorted and deliriously far-fetched, but the gowns are fabulous, the wigs are a sight and Clive Owen makes a dandy Errol Flynn, even if he’s really meant to be Walter Raleigh, the queen’s favorite smoldering slab of man meat. When Raleigh first swaggers into the  court, he’s toting a trunk of New World goodies, including some tobacco leaves that, when smoked, he promises with an insinuating smile, are very “stimulating.” Hearing that Raleigh has named a swath of New World land Virginia in her honor, Elizabeth seems exceedingly eager for stimulation. She may be a virgin or virginesque, but she’s far from cloistered.  She surrounds herself with female pets (“My  bitches  wear my collars”), the loveliest of whom is Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish). Bess holds the queenly hand, caresses the royal head and keeps the imperial body intimate company, suggesting that Elizabeth abandoned the metaphoric sword but not the chalice. The director Shekhar Kapur, who put Ms. Blanchett through her flouncing paces in “Elizabeth,” the rather more restrained 1998 film about the monarch’s earlier years, doesn’t spend much time pondering the Sapphic possibilities, mostly because he has armies to unleash, conspiracies to uncork and one head to lop off (Samantha Morton as Mary Stuart).  Even so, despite the hurried, sporadically  frantic pace, there are a few nice moments in which Elizabeth uses Bess and  Raleigh  as erotic puppets,  turning them into expressions of her own masculine and feminine selves, as if she were a child playing naughty with Barbie and Ken. In her spectral face you see a lonely soul trying to hold onto sanity, to a thread of real life. Mr. Owen looks as if he’s having a grand time, whether he’s revving Elizabeth up with his tales of seafaring adventure, nuzzling a swooning supplicant or hanging off a ship’s rigging as the wind gently stirs his chest hair. With his seafaring movie tan and muscular physicality he matches up well against the forceful Ms. Blanchett, whose strange beauty adds to the queen’s otherworldly affect. The Elizabeth of this film bears little relation to the flushed young woman of the first film, who had not yet been unmoored from the merely mortal. The spring lamb is no more, and with her Kabuki-white mask and palace rituals, this older, ethereal Elizabeth on occasion seems like a space alien, which, in some ways, is what she has become. Written by William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, “The Golden Age” has sweep and momentum and almost as many mood shifts and genre notes as the queen has dresses. It’s intentionally playful and an inadvertent giggle, an overripe melodrama that’s by turns a bodice-ripper, a cloak-and-dagger thriller and a serious-minded historical drama with dubious contemporary overtones. The first film opened with persecuted Protestants roasting over an open fire courtesy of Elizabeth’s predecessor; this film leads off with a scheming King Philip II of Spain, her former brother-in-law (Jordi Molla), who wants to dethrone the Protestant queen by igniting  a Catholic-led holy war. The resulting conspiracy, with its ominous monks and Latin chants, reeks of “The Da Vinci Code,” as well as a more urgently modern struggle. For much of “The Golden Age,” the filmmakers flirt suggestively with the idea that the English  or perhaps the English-speaking world is  engaged in another holy war against another set of radical fundamentalists. By the time the Spanish Armada has set sail for England, and Elizabeth has donned armor and a flowing red wig to rouse her waiting troops to victory, the suggestive has become explicit. Declaiming from atop her white horse, her legs now conspicuously parted as she straddles the jittery, stamping animal, she invokes God and country, blood and honor, life and death, bringing to mind at once Joan of Arc, Henry V, Winston Churchill and Tony Blair in one gaspingly unbelievable, cinematically climactic moment. The queenly body quakes as history and fantasy explode. “Elizabeth: The Golden Age” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A bodice rips, one head falls.
"Will you leave your kingdom to a heretic?" That was the question posed to a dying Queen Mary in 1998's Elizabeth , director Shekhar Kapur 's grim and dingy film now viewed in retrospect as the origin story of a superhero: the armored Virgin Queen, faster than a speeding lead pellet, more powerful than a Spanish Armada, able to leap the Tower of London  in a single bound. Queen Mary, of course, had no choiceshe had no heirs, after all, only her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth, to whom she handed over the throne rather than a death sentence, and, really, that was mighty nice of her. But fear not: Even if you recall little of your history textsor the film nominated for a fistful of Oscars in a previous millennium, including ones for Best Actress and Best PictureElizabeth: The Golden Age  demands only your loyalty to highbrow camp masquerading as a history lesson soapier than any bottle of detergent.
Kapur revisits Elizabeth, once more played by Cate Blanchett  beneath towering wigs and a deathly pale visage, some 30 years after her ascendancy to the throne. Only now, England is on the brink of war with Spain's King Philip II (Jordi Molla ), who wants the country reclaimed as a Catholic stronghold under the rule of Mary, Queen of Scots  (Samantha Morton ). As though any of that matters: The audience should have a very hard time taking seriously a film in which Clive Owen , dressed in baggy pantaloons as Sir Walter Raleigh , dangles like a romance-novel cover boy from a ship's mast while the ocean laps him like a faithful hound. Halloween's come early, and the kids who can't get their hands on a Jack Sparrow  costume might do well to see whether Target's carrying a Sir Walter Raleigh outfit this year.
The original was no less a fanciful soap operaDynasty  in Renaissance Faire drag, Dallas  with a fancier Southfork Ranch. But the sequel is considerably more garish and voluble. If Elizabeth  was BBC  stuff writ large, a history lesson made enchanting for soap fans, its successor is more like an Indian import: How is it these people don't break into song or skip into a dance routine every five minutes, honestly?
Kapur and his screenwriter have little interest here in maintaining even a dollop of historical accuracy. The Golden Age  commingles accepted fact, acknowledged fiction, and wild-ass myth to the point where it's often nothing more than a "Fractured Fairy Tale," really more Shrek    than Shrek . The foundation of the story's more or less accurate: By the 1580s, Elizabeth had settled into her role as the country's Protestant ruler, much to the chagrin of her former brother-in-law Philip, who wanted the country returned to its Catholic ways. Plots were hatched and conspiracies were conceived to put Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne, though in the end, Mary denied any wrongdoing just before her head was chopped clean off.
And while that was going on, Sir Walter was hanging out with the queen, who had taken a shine to the rogue explorer and poet. But Raleigh only had eyes, and baggy pants, for Elizabeth's favorite lady-in-waiting, Bess (played here by Abbie Cornish ), with whom Raleigh would have a childwhich made the queen mad enough to send him to the Tower of London for a while, till she freed him to do more pillaging of Spanish ships.
Kapur and his writers have taken all that "truth," such as it's been interpreted by copious historians over the years, and dumped it on its ass: Raleigh gets sprung from the tower not to do the queen's dirty work, but to save the entire damned country really, who knew it was Sir Walter himself who single-handedly sunk the Spanish Armada, and not Lord High Admiral Charles Howard  with the helping hand of Mother Nature? And the queen and Raleigh are now far more than friends: Here, Elizabeth acts like a flirty little teenybopper surrounded by giggling courtesans as she ponders the touch of the rakish hunk. The filmmakers even include the long-ago- dispelled story that Sir Walter once draped his cape over a puddle of mud lest the queen sully her slippers.
This will be rightfully damned as ludicrous nonsense, puffed into "substance" by a filmmaker who has found a franchise in a legend, while Blanchett, Owens, and Geoffrey Rush  (who returns as Sir Francis Walsingham , the Queen's right-hand man) play it so straight you're even more tempted to laugh out loud at every other scenethis is really Rocky Horror Picture Show  territory. But, really, you must  do the time warp again.
