 It is tempting to overpraise “Kabluey,” a bittersweet indie comedy whose hapless protagonist, Salman (Scott Prendergast), spends a good part of the movie waddling along the side of a  highway in a blue foam-rubber suit. Dressed as Kabluey, the corporate mascot of BlueNexion, a failing  Internet company in Texas, Salman is paid $6 an hour to attract attention.  As motorists stop to gawk at this featureless blob with a giant round head, Salman’s job is to distribute fliers advertising office space in BlueNexion’s sleek, nearly deserted headquarters. Because he can’t hold the fliers in his inflated paws, Salman has to keep them tucked under one arm, from which they are continually slipping and scattering onto the road.  To be trapped all day inside this costume with the sun beating down on him may be hell. But as enraptured children cling to Kabluey  as if he were a cartoon legend sprung to life, Salman finds an odd kind of transcendence in the work. He becomes two people: one a lost 32-year-old boy cowering inside the suit, the other the adorable, bobbing and shuffling Kabluey who inspires cuddly affection.  Midway through the movie Salman meets another professional buffoon, a man outfitted as a giant Gouda cheese who dispenses tidbits in front of a supermarket. Together the two, fully costumed, eventually engage BlueNexion’s sleazy, womanizing chief executive (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in a slapstick brawl.  Mr. Prendergast, an alumnus of the Groundlings comedy troupe, wrote and directed  “Kabluey,” which is very funny in a ghastly way. All the characters —  be they the gossipy, backbiting Austin, Tex., equivalents of television’s desperate housewives  or Salman’s morose fellow passengers on the bus to work —  suffer from excruciating boredom. It is a malaise that rises like steam from the flat, Middle Western  landscape in which the corporation’s emptied offices symbolize an economy going bust.  Salman  is the nerdy brother-in-law of Leslie (Lisa Kudrow), an overstressed mother bringing up two hellions, Cameron (Cameron Wofford) and Lincoln (Landon Henninger),  while her husband, a National Guardsman, fights in Iraq. When informed that her husband’s tour has been extended by several months, Leslie visibly crumples. No one is better than Ms. Kudrow at playing emotionally bedraggled women hanging on by their fingernails, and your heart goes out to her, even when she behaves atrociously.  Enlisting Salman as a live-in baby sitter is the solution of last resort for Leslie, who is forced to take a job at BlueNexion to pay for her children’s health insurance. Salman, unemployed and homeless after losing his last job as a laminater in a copy shop, nervously accepts the invitation. In the recent epidemic of comedies about 30-something men in the throes of severe arrested development, he is one of the most pitifully incompetent losers.  Cameron and Lincoln hate  Salman on sight. “I’m going to kill you,” hisses Cameron, the older and meaner of the two. And their pranks, like sprinkling cleanser on Salman’s eyes and mouth while he is asleep and putting thumbtacks in his breakfast cereal, show they mean business.  Salman takes the harassment in stride. He leads the rampaging little monsters on leashes to the supermarket and ties them up outside the store like dogs.  If Salman suggests an Adam Sandler character, Mr. Prendergast plays him like a long-suffering Buster Keaton stumblebum; he is so far beyond misery he is practically mute. Mr. Prendergast gives him the wide vacant eyes of a silent clown who is so resigned to a life of humiliation that his face has lost any expression, save for his mouth, which gapes in an attitude of befuddled amazement.  The plot of “Kabluey,” which operates on surreal cartoon logic, doesn’t bear close scrutiny. There are holes everywhere. When Salman gets the job as Kabluey, which Leslie finds for him, the crisis that brought him into the family is nearly forgotten. Who is caring for the boys? Toward the end the movie takes a queasy turn toward the saccharine.  The film’s distance from factual reality oddly enhances its bleak underlying vision. It portrays a demoralized American work force fearfully going through the motions of life while waiting without much hope for things to get better.  “Kabluey” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

"Quirky" and "deadpan" have been staples of the Amerindie diet since Jim Jarmusch first surfaced, but as many a film has proved, they can't float a feature alone. Such is the case with "Kabluey," a studiously oddball comedy starring, written and directed by Scott Prendergast, who plays a classic adult-child misfit looking after his sister-in-law's unruly children. If that sounds like Adam Sandler terrain, rest assured that "Kabluey" is short on the cutes and ca-ca jokes. But it's also short on substance, despite a watchable supporting cast and an amiable overall tenor. Pic might win a modest following in ancillary.
Salman (Prendergast) is a socially inept 32-year-old who can't hold a job. Nonetheless, he's summoned to stay with Leslie (Lisa Kudrow), who's in no position to be choosy. Her husband has been away on National Guard duty in Iraq for 18 months, during which time bills have piled up, their two young sons have become rampaging hellions and Leslie has gotten thisclose
 to a nervous breakdown.
But the brats finally show Salman some respect once they see him in the titular figure's giant puffy suit. It's the bizarre trademark for a vast, largely empty new office complex, and Salman has been hired to spend days in the sweltering costume, hopefully attracting potential renters. Sight of Prendergast in this sub-Smurf garb is pic's main joke; whether auds find it funny for 90 minutes or five seconds will determine their enjoyment of "Kabluey."
Pic is crisply designed and directed, but feels like a short's worth of droll ideas thinly stretched out to feature length.
Christine Taylor, Chris Parnell, Conchata Ferrell and others occasionally amuse in one-dimensional parts; it's not even clear who Teri Garr's character is supposed to be. There's nothing undernourished, however, about Kudrow's barbed, full-blooded performance as one non-campily desperate housewife.

From the film appearances of the San Diego Chicken  to the penguin-suited thug who gave Jean-Claude Van Damme  a flipper-smacking in Sudden Death , I can't think of a single instance in film history where a giant padded suit hasn't been funnyand in his plangently comic feature debut, writer/director/star Scott Prendergast  extends the streak. Prendergast plays Salman, the ne'er-do-well sibling of a National Guardsman on extended stay in Iraq . With his sister-in-law Leslie (Lisa Kudrow ) at wits end juggling her household of hellions and an unstable corporate job, Salman takes on child-care duties with his usual aplombleaving her sulking kids to crash in a den carpeted with breakfast cereal. In desperation, Leslie sets up Salman with the mother of all crappy temp gigsand soon he's passing out flyers in the sweltering costume of her company's mascot, a foam-rubber stick figure with a bulbous blue head. The movie's absurdist yuks and Chaplinesque sentiment don't always mesh with the realistic agony of wage slavery and suburban turmoil. But the ingeniously designed suit (kudos to Geppetto Studios) offers plentiful possibilities for humor both high and low, and Prendergast takes advantage of every unfortunate hand portal, restricted movement, and disastrous bathroom break. At the same timethanks mostly to Kudrow's stunning performancethe Austin-shot movie catches the nation's mood of economic anxiety and workplace exploitation more pungently than anything else in theaters.
