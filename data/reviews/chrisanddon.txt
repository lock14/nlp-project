Chris was British writer Christopher Isherwood, whose Berlin Stories  became the basis for Cabaret ; Don is artist Don Bachardy, more than 30 years Isherwood's junior, who was a teenage movie-star-struck Californian in the early '50s when he met the man who would be his life partner until Isherwood's death in 1986. Their love story was inevitably complicated. And so is the documentary Chris & Don: A Love Story   not simply a love letter to love  by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara. The work is a reflective hodgepodge of unnervingly ''cute'' animation, reenactments, archival footage, and Bachardy's own reminiscences, spoken in the singular British accent he invented just as he invented his own unorthodox life.

 The three-and-a-half-decade relationship of the British writer Christopher Isherwood and the American portrait artist Don Bachardy is one of the ultimate true stories of a proto-gay-marriage succeeding in a forbidding climate.  Defying social conventions of the 1950s and ’60s, the two men navigated Hollywood society as an openly gay couple, withstanding the slings and arrows of homophobes like the actor Joseph Cotten, who during a dinner party at David O. Selznick’s house made loud, derisive remarks about “half-men.”  Navigation was made all the more treacherous by the 30-year age difference between the two, who met on a Santa Monica beach and became lovers when Mr. Bachardy was 18, but looked several years younger. They spent what passed for a honeymoon in Monument Valley,  where the director John Ford, who was shooting a western, and his crew assumed they were father and son.  Mr. Bachardy, now 74, recalls a traumatic experience that sealed their bond: a trip to Morocco to visit the author Paul Bowles during which Mr. Bachardy consumed hashish for the first time. He and  Isherwood experienced a blind terror during which, afraid to let go, they clung to each other all night in their hotel room.  Guido Santi and Tina Mascara’s tender, extremely touching documentary, “Chris & Don: A Love Story,” examines the history of this complicated and passionate relationship, which ended with Mr. Isherwood’s death in 1986. As Mr. Bachardy remembers, the age and class differences —  Isherwood, who dropped out of Cambridge, came from an upper-crust English background and Mr. Bachardy’s father worked in the aerospace industry — made for a relationship fraught with power imbalances.  Until Mr. Bachardy established himself as a gifted artist, he was dismissed or simply ignored by many of his older partner’s famous friends, including Hollywood royalty and the expatriate artistic community in Southern California.  Within a year of living with  Isherwood, Mr. Bachardy, who grew up in Los Angeles, had assimilated so many of his British mentor’s mannerisms that he had assumed  Isherwood’s British accent and dry, precise vocal tone. One talking head observes that Isherwood had “succeeded in cloning himself in some weird way.”  After  Isherwood, an ever-attentive father figure, noticed Mr. Bachardy’s talent as a draftsman, he sent him to art school, where he flourished. Had Mr. Bachardy not developed a successful parallel career as a portrait artist (many drawings and paintings of celebrities are shown), the relationship might not have endured.  The elegantly structured documentary weaves extensive footage of Mr. Bachardy rummaging through their house and reminiscing with readings from  Isherwood’s diaries by Michael York, old interviews with  Isherwood, home movies of their travels and glamorous social life, and commentary by  friends, including Leslie Caron and the British filmmaker John Boorman.  One especially delicious scene observes the couple with Burt Lancaster, Anna Magnani and Tennessee Williams on the Key West set of “The Rose Tattoo,” in which Mr. Bachardy was an extra. The only parts of the movie that seem extraneous are brief re-enactments of scenes described by Mr. Bachardy.  Early in their relationship the two developed a special coded language to discuss themselves  through notes and cartoon drawings in which Mr. Bachardy was a cat and  Isherwood an old horse, and the movie develops these dialogues into short animated sequences. During a rocky period in the early 1960s when Mr. Bachardy began pursuing sexual encounters outside the relationship, they referred to his behavior as “mousing.” Mr. Isherwood’s anxiety, in which he imagined living without a partner, was reflected in his novel “A Single Man.”  In this pre-Stonewall era  Isherwood’s increasingly acute political consciousness led him to make “the treatment of the homosexual a test by which every political party and government must be judged.”  The last section of the film, devoted to Mr. Isherwood’s slow decline from prostate cancer, is its most wrenching. Mr. Bachardy, determined to make  Isherwood’s death “something we were doing together,” chronicled his deterioration, executing as many as 9 or 10 drawings a day, including one of his corpse.  Isherwood would have told him, “That’s what an artist would do,” Mr. Bachardy reflects, then adds, “And that’s what an artist did do.

The unlikely pairing of author Christopher Isherwood and painter Don Bachardy is one of those legendary but true L.A. stories that confounds the city's cliched Tinseltown image, and "Chris & Don: A Love Story" is well-attuned to this, focusing on the texture and sweetness of a particularly beguiling real-life gay love saga. Made with gentle grace and sensitivity, pic is certain to win hearts and minds at fests and vid, with a good chance at select theatrical dates.
In broad terms, the meeting of Isherwood and Bachardy was one of modern Europe encountering upstart America, with Isherwood as the upper-crust literary light and Bachardy as an unformed Angeleno seeking adventure. The roughly chronological telling in Guido Santi's and Tina Mascara's film reveals a more complicated picture, however. Isherwood was out of the closet far ahead of most in his wartime generation, and proved so rebellious at Cambridge that he was kicked out. The much younger and more impressionable Bachardy may have been Eliza Doolittle to Isherwood's Henry Higgins, but the youngster proved to be an exceptionally gifted portrait painter in his own right.
With a rich supply of archival and homemovie material, the pic shows the heady life in Weimar Berlin that drew Isherwood like a moth to a flame, and inspired his classic "Berlin Stories" that formed the basis for "Cabaret" and a considerable portion of his fame.
Isherwood fled Germany during the Nazi rise, and landed in Gotham alongside the brilliant poet and pal W. H. Auden (also seen in rare homemovie glimpses). Isherwood soon moved to Los Angeles, where he met Bachardy, as well as a dazzling cultural circle including Igor Stravinsky and Aldous Huxley.
The loquacious and energetic Bachardy is seen working and puttering about the Santa Monica home he and Isherwood shared for decades, but the film fails to explore the the linkages between Bachardy's fascination for the painted image and Isherwood's movie-influenced switch from traditional prose to what he termed "writing with a camera eye." Another odd absence is Isherwood's longtime friend Julie Harris.
But the docu also delivers a sense of triumph, in that Bachardy, who outlived Isherwood, winds up able to thrive away from Isherwood's considerable shadow; in many ways, "Chris & Don" can be read as a study in the growth of artistic confidence, as a young man with no strong vision is loved and encouraged to find his way until he discovers his metier. Passage of Isherwood's long and gradual death at home is extremely touching, with Bachardy displaying his many illustrations documenting Isherwood's decline, including his death visage.
Tech package is clean and spare, with camera coverage of Bachardy at home avoiding the standard talking heads approach. Animation by Katrina Swanger and Kristina Swanger, inspired by the simple horse and cat cartoon characters that Isherwood and Bachardy used in cards and letters to each other, is just this side of too cute.

With a glint in his eye and a grin on his lips, artist Don Bachardy  looks into the camera and explains the dynamic of his three-decade relationship with the late literary icon Christopher Isherwood  as if it were a fairy tale. "His role," says Bachardy, "could be described as that of the arch villain. He took this young boy and he warped him to his mold. He taught him all kinds of wicked things." Pause a half beat. "It was exactly what the boy wanted. And we flourished."
With his elegant cadence, crisp comedic timing, and witty flipping of homophobic stereotypes—in his very choice and use of language—Bachardy is that story come to life: the student who eventually mirrored his teacher, the molded who became a duplicate of the mold.
Chris & Don: A Love Story  is a charming, illuminating portrait of the complex and storied queer romance between Isherwood and Bachardy, who met on a Santa Monica  beach in 1952, when Bachardy was a teenager and Isherwood already 30 years his senior. Quilted from black-and-white home-movie clips, animated sequences that bring to life the duo's correspondence and pet names, and original footage of the elderly Bachardy going about his daily routine or walking through the art-filled Santa Monica home he once shared with his partner, Tina Mascara  and Guido Santi's film uses standard documentary-filmmaking tools to celebrate three entities—Isherwood, Bachardy, and their relationship—that flaunted all the rules.
Individually, the men are fascinating in their own right, and Mascara and Santi flesh out their backstories in rich detail: Isherwood's aristocratic upbringing and his break from it—though his background forever influenced every aspect of his being—and his life in Berlin , which became the basis for some of his most celebrated work (The Berlin Stories ); Bachardy's conservative, homophobic family life, and the electric-shock treatments that permanently debilitated his queer older brother. But it's the relationship and life that the men forged together that are most extraordinary. Their cosmopolitan circle (glamorous and influential friends included Elsa Lanchester , W.H. Auden , Igor Stravinsky , Aldous Huxley , and Bertrand Russell ) was at the center of a bygone era of both hyper-literate high culture and outsider chic. The terms on which the couple set up house not only reach back to the most ancient manifestations of queer coupling (the older man taking a younger partner under his wing, schooling him on life, culture, and sex), but also illustrate lingering issues with—or even within—the modern gay and lesbian community.
Theirs was an organic, constantly evolving companionship. They quite consciously shaped it, but also allowed it to find its own patterns and path. There was extraordinary vulnerability in their union ("Don might leave me," Isherwood is quoted as saying, "but I could never leave him. Not unless he ceased to need me"), only matched by extraordinary faith in their bond. The relationship contained elements of the parent/child hierarchy (with the roles flip-flopping back and forth over time), but it was also an erotic quest that expanded to include other lovers—especially as Bachardy matured into his own man—and then retreated back to monogamous form again, at least emotionally. And as Bachardy grew into his own creativity, theirs became a conversation between artists, too. With the most delicate of hands, directors Mascara and Santi shape their investigative film into the revelation that all of this constituted Chris and Don's love story.
The recent California Supreme Court  ruling overturning the ban on gay marriage brings gays, lesbians, and same-sex relationships one crucial step closer to legitimacy in the eyes of the law—a legitimacy that was unimaginable when our two heroes first met in the '50s. But as confetti and champagne toasts greet the news, it might be a good thing for gays and  straights to glean some lessons from Isherwood and Bachardy's example: Make your own rules, set your own terms for connection, and be willing to let them evolve as you and your partner hopefully do.
