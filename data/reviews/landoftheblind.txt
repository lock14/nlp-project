Set before, during, and after an unnamed revolution in an unknown country in an unknown time, Land of the Blind  suggests that power corrupts. That those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. And that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for enough good men to do nothing. In other words, there's nothing particularly revolutionary about writer-director Robert Edwards' grimly satiric political fable  nothing explained, either, about why a character who's, say, a staunch opponent of the reigning dictatorship, imprisoned and tortured, should, upon his release and post-revolution ascension to leadership, become just as despicable as the previous despot.
To compensate, there's an excess of handsome, jittery visual and theatrical style to this barrels-blazing first film from Edwards, a former U.S. Army infantryman and intelligence officer who won a prestigious Nicholl screenwriting fellowship for his script. The flyaway story is anchored, certainly, by the fired-up performances of Donald Sutherland as Thorne, the prisoner–turned–power grabber, and Ralph Fiennes as Joe, the obedient Establishment soldier who comes to support Thorne's rebel cause, and then to regret his choice of candidate. Wearing the long hair of a 19th-century romantic and writing manifestos on his prison wall with feces, Sutherland's Thorne (a jab in the side of the status quo?) is a tainted hero, while Fiennes bestows his usual compelling queasiness of soul on the character meant to represent...us? Just a guess.
Meanwhile, the filmmaker revels in the easy gibe. (In this strange Land , Friends  is a perpetual TV repeat.) Intent on demonstrating the crimes of Maximilian (Gosford Park 's Tom Hollander, specializing in facial expressions of pampered idiocy), the spoiled weakling dictator who inherits his president-for-life privileges when his Mussolini-headed father dies, Edwards shows the cruel fool consulting with advisers while straining and wiping on his own porcelain throne; he also presents the boor as an untalented wannabe filmmaker. In the movie's one-eyed philosophy, that's what passes as the last refuge of a scoundrel.

 "Nothing is better than a big, juicy steak" goes the double-edged slogan repeated incessantly through the last half of Robert Edwards's satirical allegory, "Land of the Blind." First mouthed by Thorne (Donald Sutherland), a shaggy leftist dictator who suggests a Maoist John the Baptist, the words are meant literally, since starvation is morally superior to consumption in the unidentified nation he rips to pieces with iron-clawed ideology.  As the fable goes along, that nation swings from extreme right to extreme left; yet at the end all signs point toward a spasmodic reversal of the pendulum. In its fascist phase (the movie's first half), this troubled Everycountry suggests Nazi Germany overlain with a banana republic in a multicentury, intercontinental time warp that alludes to everything from Iran under the Shah to prerevolutionary France. Its despotic ruler, Maximilian II, a k a Junior (Tom Hollander), is a demented little Caligula (or Napoleon) who has christened himself "president for life." Besides tormenting his incompetent toadies, his consuming passion is running the movie industry, for which he pumps out homemade action-adventure trash like his latest, "Out for Vengeance 4."  Junior eventually gets his comeuppance when his imperial bedroom is raided by Thorne while he and his tarot-card reading kook of a wife, Josephine (Lara Flynn Boyle), are playing a kinky sex game involving diapers and a ball gag. Thorne — a dissident playwright and guerrilla leader of the revolutionary Citizens for Justice and Democracy, who has been released from prison and made a member of Parliament in an effort to undermine his populist mystique — shoots the president and first lady and seizes power.  Under Thorne's autocratic rule, Everycountry becomes a pastiche of Communist China, North Korea, Cambodia under Pol Pot and Iran since the Islamic Revolution. Frightened women huddle under burqas, book burnings commence and the professional class is purged in grim re-education camps. Thorne even insists the traffic signals be reversed so that red means go.  "Land of the Blind" is narrated by Joe (Ralph Fiennes), the Everycountry's Everyman, who begins the film as Thorne's jailer and becomes his accomplice in Junior's assassination and, finally, an enemy of the people for refusing to sign a loyalty oath. As the screenplay's sour wisecracks fizzle around them, Mr. Fiennes and Mr. Sutherland play their characters without a smidgen of irony or facetious humor, and their performances in impossible roles lend "Land of the Blind" a frisson of gravitas.  But don't be deceived. Character is a misleading word to describe either of these stick figures, whose changes of attitude make no psychological or political sense. Why does Thorne, who won Joe's sympathy by spouting eloquent quotations from Shakespeare, Yeats and Eliot, become an enemy of literature? Did he undergo a brain transplant?  And why does the suave, chameleonic Joe turn into a priggish masochist willing to endure torture, beatings and solitary confinement, along with years of separation from his wife and daughter, merely for refusing to sign a piece of paper? Isn't he the same duplicitous guy who, during Junior's reign of terror, worked against the system from within?  Mr. Edwards, who wrote and directed "Land of the Blind" (it's his debut film), might counter that the movie is a Brechtian comedy that's not supposed to make literal sense: the big picture is what matters.  But the big picture is a mess. And Brecht at least created coherent mouthpieces. The movie is so clotted with references from here and there, now and then, that watching it is like poring over a quadruple exposure. Scattered around are some cute visual wisecracks, as when Thorne, his time having run out, is slain in a trompe l'oeil reference to  David's "Death of Marat," but such moments are few and far between.  And what's with the elephant herd periodically observed in black-and-white film clips? Might it  symbolize the herd of clichés stampeding through this dramatically inert film, which shamelessly borrows ideas from Orwell's "1984," then tramples them into the dust? Absolute power corrupts absolutely; fascism and Communism are two sides of the same coin; yada yada yada.  "Land of the Blind" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and scenes of torture and defecation.

One of the more spectacular misfires of recent years, "Land of the Blind's" lack of originality is only slightly exceeded by its failure to work as political satire. Perhaps this tale of dictators and revolution looked better on paper, when stars Ralph Fiennes and Donald Sutherland came on board, but it's hard to see how the jumbled reasoning and tasteless jokes could have escaped notice. The question is not whether American helmer Robert Edwards' feature debut gets a release, but how long it can withstand critical onslaught.
From the very start, the pic borrows elements from other sources thick and fast. A B&W newsreel sets the scene, describing the succession of a brutal dictator (heavily modeled on Soviet-style leaders) by his son, Maximilian II (Tom Hollander).
From his jail cell, Joe (Ralph Fiennes) narrates the tale, beginning in the Orwellian-sounding "Year Minus 5" when he was a security guard assigned to watch the country's most dangerous political prisoner, playwright-turned-terrorist Thorne (Donald Sutherland). 
Despite Thorne's daily habit of using his own feces to write slogans on the walls, his seductive intelligence leads Joe to question whether Maximilian II really is good for the country.
To rob Thorne of his martyr's status, Max releases him. But while the leader and his wife Josephine (Lara Flynn Boyle, combining Evita with Lady Macbeth) engage in kinky sex involving diapers and plastic, Thorne effects a palace coup with Joe's assistance.
The new regime, however, turns out to be every bit as repressive as the old. Thorne institutes a Khmer Rouge-type revolution complete with re-education camps, forcing women into burqas and reversing traffic light signals so red now means "go." 
Joe refuses to sign an oath of allegiance, and is thrown into prison.
Over-the-top barely describes the scenes involving Maximilian, whose obsession with action movies parallels North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il. In tone more suggestive of a bad sitcom than a fascist dictatorship, it's anyone's guess why Edwards includes a scene of Max taking a dump on a throne-like toilet.
Apparently Edwards, who directed docus after leaving army life, decided to use all of his ideas in one film, without thinking through their meaning or relevance, relegating what's meant to be a sharp satire into a gummy-mouthed exercise in pedantry. Most plundered is "1984," including the book's Room 101, here changed to Room 12, but equally dreaded. 
"Name that reference" becomes a piece of cake, including the death of Marat and an especially egregious, and hollow, comparison with Rudolf Hess and Spandau prison. 
In a bumper year for Fiennes, one misfire won't make a difference. Judging by his over-serious tone and earnest delivery, the actor apparently thought he was in another pic entirely and, considering the multiplicity of films trapped in these 101 minutes, he can't be blamed. 
Sutherland plays Thorne like he's John the Baptist morphing into Jesus, while Hollander and Boyle leave no piece of the palace unchewed.
Visuals are unremarkable, though the art department's mingling of period styles -- 1940s hair, 1950s TVs, 2006 references -- is but one of many head-scratching decisions, including the use of music, which cuts off the tunes just as they're building. 
Print screened in Rotterdam was waiting final post-prod tinkering, including some digital cleanup.

Wrongheaded and bizarrely outrageous, the first feature from Robert Edwards  chronicles the madcap historical throes of a fictionalized ur-nation (an amalgamation of Chile , Argentina, Iran , and the U.S., plus whatever) as it endures a Caligula-like scion in a line of military despots (Tom Hollander ), suffers a quasi-socialist revolution at the hands of a Marx-haired playwright- messiah (Donald Sutherland ), and then descends into Stalinist/Taliban  fascism. The literate blitz of allusions and thefts does not obviate plenty of bathroom humor and shtick; in fact, the movie relentlessly veers toward the preposterous every time you think it might cohere into a political position. In this world, everybody's either an evildoing behemoth or a dolt. Who exactly is the one-eyed man in this Mad  magazine version of dialectical materialism isn't clear; it surely isn't Ralph Fiennes , as the passive hero who graduates from being a good soldier to being Winston Smith  in a re-education torture chamber. It's an easy movie to loathe, but it's designed imaginatively and enjoys the committed attention of its cast.
