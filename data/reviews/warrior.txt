         Make way for "The Warrior," the latest in a venerable tradition of arty slice-'em-ups that prostrate before the slaughter churches of Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone, filmmakers who have ritualized movie violence into a kind of religion.
 
  The feature debut of British filmmaker Asif Kapadia, this lushly recycled piece of goods relates the story of Lafcadia, a feudal Indian warrior (Irfan Khan) who decides that he's had enough of the raping-and-pillaging lifestyle and wants to return to his mountain homeland to live in peace with his adolescent son.
 


         






    Lafcadia renounces his sword for good, but never say never, right? As in the hundreds upon hundreds of gangster thrillers, westerns and samurai pictures about antiheroes who choose to reform, the big boss (the neighborhood warlord, in this case) is not about to let one of his stooges go straight without a fight.
 
  The ex-warrior can barely take two steps out of town before warlord loyalists make things nasty for him and for the dozens of poor villagers who happen to be in the wrong place amid this deadly pursuit. Lafcadia's legacy of blood and death haunts him, most ironically in the person of a young thief he befriends who turns out to be the sole survivor of a peasant family wiped out in a warrior raid.
 
  You know that Lafcadia has finally found redemption when snow falls to cleanse his sins. Kapadia encases this and other clichés (dig the holy blind woman with lie-detector hands) in pictorial shots of Rajasthan calculated to take our breath. It is chockablock with brutality, but the violence is of the high-minded, self-congratulatory sort that indicates without actually showing. This enables macho-but-sensitive cineastes to revel remorselessly in the idea of decapitated heads, sliced necks and severed limbs.
 
  "The Warrior" marches into theaters dragging all sorts of prizes from England — including one for best British film from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, along with the endorsement of "The English Patient's" Anthony Minghella, who is into languid movies such as this with pretty, widescreen landscapes.

He's bound by honor and indenture to a corrupt warlord in a feudal past. But a crisis of conscience turns a fighter in a remote region of India into a hunted pacifist in The Warrior . And from the moment Lafcadia (Irfan Khan) lays down his sword, he's on a run for his life against punishing henchmen. Asif Kapadia's blazing feature debut, a gorgeously photographed saga with a fine sense of the way place shapes personality, has won numerous awards in the filmmaker's native Britain (the film was first released in 2002). That the Hindi-language drama appears in the U.S. only now is one of those mysteries of Miramax, yet another saga of acquisition followed by long-delayed release retold in the empire's final days.

Set during an unspecified ancient time in the seldom-captured picturesque locales of India's northwestern desertland and the western Himalayas, Asif Kapadia's feature debut, "The Warrior," which sat on Miramax's overstocked shelves for close to four years, is a minimalist but strikingly beautiful tale of renounced violence told with uncommon precision and depth. The title warrior, Lafcadia (Irfan Khan), is a longtime indentured servant and executioner whose livelihood consists of ravaging small villages - and their women - with his menacing gang of brutes. During a routine pillaging, he experiences a flash of clarity and resolves to never again pick up a sword. But his vicious warlord master immediately retaliates by calling for the head of Lafcadia and the death of his disloyal servant's only son. Instead of becoming a typical revenge-driven killfest like many of the westerns that were clear inspirations for this film, it develops into a rich journey of repentance, redemption and acceptance of fate. Accompanying the warrior on a meditative trek to his birthplace is an intuitive elderly blind woman (Damayanti Marfatia) and a young thief (Noor Mani), a lost though spirited teenage boy whose family has been murdered (perhaps by the hand of the warrior himself). They come to embody hope and a newfound familial presence for the grieving warrior who at first can barely muster the strength to continue. The themes explored in "The Warrior" are less than groundbreaking,  but the mesmerizing portrayal of a beaten man - and a true victim of his times - by Mr. Khan, one of the few professional actors in the cast, makes it all somehow fresh. His worn, gruffly handsome face, with big bags under the eyes, oozes pain and remorse. But because his barbaric acts are never shown, Lafcadia is probably more sympathetic than he deserves to be. Despite a measured pace, "The Warrior," with its lush imagery and sweeping score, is powerful and gripping, without ever resorting to easy spectacle. In fact, the most extensive swordplay occurs during the gracefully choreographed opening credits, featuring only Lafcadia and his blade. When the warrior grasps the full magnitude of his sins, while passing through a recently plundered town, he stares dejectedly as if seeing the ghosts of everyone he has killed. It's an incredibly moving scene, one that reminds audiences that an expression can be more eloquent than words - and a contemplative movie more hard-hitting than numbing depictions of violence. "The Warrior" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes adult themes and some violence.
In 1975, Indian filmgoers got a taste of their first chapati  western. Sholay , the Bollywood film that went on to set national box office records only recently broken, borrowed heavily from Sergio Leone 's tales of goons and gunsels. But language and inspiration are where the similarities end with Brit-Indian director Asif Kapadia 's "eastern" The Warrior , a swashbuckling fable set in northern India about a fighter who abruptly decides to forgo his vocation as an on-staff pillager. Man-at-arms Lafcadia (Irfan Khan ) has an epiphany mid-plunder, as he's about to lop off the head of a pretty young thing. This killing life is not for him, he decides, andforswearing all violence in one fell swoophe quits town and heads for the Himalayas . Would that the warlord he works for were so easy about letting his prime decapitator jump ship: A fellow killing machine is summarily dispatched to fetch the deserter's head. Kapadia's debut feature pulls no punches with size: Visual grandiloquence more than makes up for the bare-bones dialogue. But while high on mysticism and vast in scale, The Warrior  seems more poised than poetic, and ultimately landscape proves to be the film's real grabber. If this moralistic apologue appears a tad too simplistic, at least the pictures are pretty.
