About two-thirds of the way into the ridiculously satisfying new "Star Trek" movie, opening Thursday, there comes a brief shot of the crew on the bridge of the Federation Starship Enterprise. The film has been picking up familiar names as it goes, but you suddenly realize with a jolt that everyone, at last, is here: young, hopeful versions of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and pilot Sulu (John Cho), Bones (Karl Urban) and Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Simon Pegg).

It's a throwaway image, yet you feel the final pieces of the puzzle snap into place with a witty and intensely fond reverence. I just about wept with joy, and I'm not even a Trekkie.

Neither, apparently, is director J.J. Abrams, and that may have made the difference. "Star Trek"  - a.k.a. "Star Trek XI," a.k.a. "Star Trek the Franchise Reboot"  - approaches the late Gene Roddenberry's original science fiction world not on bended knee but with fresh eyes, a spring in its step, and the understanding that we know these people better than they know themselves. Indeed, much of the vast pleasure of this movie comes from characters suddenly discovering things about each other that we learned watching TV four decades ago. There are flaws to pick at in terms of story line and other matters, but that can wait until the glow has faded. In the pop high it delivers, this is the greatest prequel ever made.

"Star Trek" isn't all fun and games. The universe has to be saved (again), and Spock has to undergo a personality crisis severe even by the standards of his half-human/half-Vulcan nature. A renegade Romulan named Captain Nero (played by Eric Bana with facial tattoos and a taste for waterboarding) has dropped in from decades into the future, and he's very, very angry about something the older Spock has done, or will do. Nero's first order of business is to attack a starship, in the process killing Kirk's father (Chris Hemsworth) just as Mother Kirk (Jennifer Morrison) is giving birth to our hero in an escape shuttle.

Conceptually, this is a genius move: It establishes the entire movie as an alternate, parallel "Star Trek" universe in which Abrams and his screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman can do as they wish, fanboys and the canon be damned. Kirk can grow up a rebellious hothead, only learning about his father through the paternal Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Kirk and Spock can meet not on the bridge of the Enterprise but as clashing cadets in training school. ("Who was that pointy-eared bastard?," Kirk mutters.) Spock can even have a simmering relationship with Uhura that occasionally involves long, steamy kisses. Heresy!
But it works. As the characters scramble to deal with the Romulan threat  - the baddies want to destroy the Federation's planets one by one, and they have the future tech to do it  - their initial enmity is forged into camaraderie under heavy fire, and Abrams has a blast letting them get to know each other. Sulu and Kirk first connect while free-falling through space on their way to dismantling a Romulan megaweapon, and the ensuing fight with the enemy is outrageously choreographed, a ballet of high-impact fencing and brute force.

At the same time, Abrams respects the campy verities of the original show enough to include a third Enterprise crewmember on this mission  - the guy I and my roommates used to call "Lunchmeat." Remember him? The extra you'd never seen before who beamed down with the leads solely because someone needed to bite it? The script calls him "Olson" (Greg Ellis), but, trust me, he's Lunchmeat, and the movie's the better for his brief appearance and spectacular demise.

The editing, cinematography, and special effects work are state-of-the-art, as you'd expect  - extra praise goes to an astonishingly detailed sound mix  - but so are the same aspects of "Wolverine," and that film's a joyless bore by comparison. What lifts the Abrams film into the ether is the rightness of its casting and playing, from Saldana's Uhuru, finally a major character after all these years, to Urban's loyal, dyspeptic McCoy, to Simon Pegg's grandly comic Scotty, the movie's most radical reimagining of a "Star Trek" regular.

That said, the appearance of Winona Ryder as Spock's human mother comes as a jolt, and in no known universe can I imagine Tyler Perry as a Federation elder. (Abrams is a fan, I guess.) Still, the movie's center holds. The classic lines get trotted out  - "Ah'm givin' it all she's goot, Cap'n," "Dammit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist"  - but the players bring an affection and depth to their parts that's bigger than mere nostalgia; when they color outside the lines, it's on purpose. And when Pine sits down in the captain's chair with the exact macho sprawl William Shatner employed  in the original series, you almost want to applaud.

Do you have to be a hard-core fan to enjoy the movie? Not at all. "Star Trek" has been knocking around for so long that the basics have seeped into the culture by osmosis. The director indulges himself with a monster that resembles his "Cloverfield" beastie, and there are in-jokes for followers of "Lost" and other Abrams projects, but he has made sure to tap into the longstanding emotion that surrounds the "Trek" mythos.

Above all, he understands the potency and pleasure of the Kirk/Spock relationship. There are certain pop duos that have become cultural institutions and about whom it's endlessly enjoyable to speculate. Who wouldn't want to have been there when Holmes met Watson or Butch met Sundance? (Or Oscar met Felix, or Jack Aubrey met Stephen Maturin; you could play this game forever.) Pine makes a fine, brash boy Kirk, but Quinto's Spock is something special  - an eerily calm figure freighted with a heavier sadness than Roddenberry's original. The two ground each other and point toward all the stories yet to come.

Then, at a certain point, the movie's curtains part and Leonard Nimoy appears, playing an older, wiser, more fragile Spock. You're grateful for the continuity  - his appearance carries much more emotion than you'd expect  - and also thankful that this "Star Trek" stops there. One strutting ham of a Captain Kirk is enough, thanks.

The movie's not perfect. The final battle feels awfully "Star Wars"  - later "Star Wars"  - as does Scotty's sidekick, an Ewok knock-off in a lousy mask. Character, not plotting, is the film's strong suit, yet plotting takes over in the final half hour. Emotionally, though, "Star Trek" hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show. Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, "Star Trek" does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place.



Sci-fi origin stories, at least those that are launched decades after the stories themselves, tend to be disappointing. They're usually more work than play. The acquiring of superpowers, and/or Defining Personality Traits, has a certain built-in roteness, whether the subject is Luke Skywalker, Batman, or Wolverine; since we know where we're going, the getting there can be an elaborate filling in of blanks. But in Star Trek , the clever and infectious reboot of the amazingly enduring sci-fi classic, director J.J. Abrams crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums. That's because he rewires us back into the original Star Trek 's primal appeal.
Abrams revives the slightly tongue-in-cheek reverence that even those of us who aren't Trekkies still feel for Kirk, Spock, and their human/Vulcan, emotion/logic cornball yin-yang. The '60s series had its brain-warping concepts, plus all those ''special'' effects (that tacky tilt-a-cam whenever the Enterprise  got hit). It was tin-pot Isaac Asimov, yet the 40-year-old cosmic joke of Star Trek  is that the delectable, overemphatic ham passion of William Shatner (those staccato pauses!), counterpoised with the poker-faced minimalist charm of Leonard Nimoy, created a kind of map of the spirit for geeks everywhere. Abrams follows that map to pop bliss.
Star Trek  takes the two back to their boyhood, when the future Capt. James T. Kirk is a towheaded delinquent hot-rodding through Iowa farm country, and the half-human Spock is a conflicted nerd-rebel on the planet Vulcan. The movie really kicks in, though, when the two meet and butt heads at the Starfleet Academy. Kirk (Chris Pine), all cocksure deviltry, has figured out a way to beat a simulator that's been programmed by Spock to make the cadets lose. As Kirk sits in his command chair, munching on an apple, he sounds sarcastically sure of himself  a deft tweak of Shatner's slaphappy I-could-be-reading-the-phone-book bravura.
Newcomer Pine, with his slightly coarse sexiness  rough skin, thatchy hair, thick lips  evokes the young Brad Pitt, but he's no pouting pretty boy; his verbal attack is light and fast. After Kirk beats the test, he comes face to face with Spock, who's revealed to be a logical and fastidious...hothead. Zachary Quinto, the young actor cast as the shiny-black-banged, elfin-eared one, has softer features than Nimoy, but he makes a more volcanic Vulcan: This whippersnapper Spock is a cerebral control freak not by nature but by choice . (That's what his training taught him.) Early on, we see him plant a kiss on the lips of communications officer Uhura (Zoë Saldana), and Quinto, without ever breaking Spock's calm surface, always suggests the sensuality he's suppressing. It's as if Luke Skywalker had the Force not just with him but locked inside him.
On the Enterprise 's maiden voyage, Spock is part of the elite crew, and Kirk, on probation for his simulator stunt, sneaks aboard. The two don't like each other  they trade insults with crack timing  and the tension is only heightened when they come up against Nero, a wrathful Romulan who's getting revenge for the decimation of his homeland by blowing up planets. Nero is played by a shaven-headed Eric Bana as a cosmic biker thug, and the scenes of destruction have genuine grandeur: The giant, flame-tailed drill Nero uses to burrow into planets looks like a Mad Max version of the Space Needle. When the Enterprise 's captain (Bruce Greenwood) is taken prisoner aboard Nero's ship  an event that echoes the fate of Kirk's father at Nero's hands years before  Spock gets to be the captain, and it's up to him and Kirk to duel and jockey their way out of the villain's grip.
There's a time-tripping plot that, frankly, could have been trippier (not to mention a bit more, you know, logical). Maybe that's because it's basically an excuse to shoehorn Leonard Nimoy into the picture. Excuse granted: He's as dry, and spry, as ever  a tribal-elder aristocrat. I do wish Karl Urban, as Bones, lit his short fuse with a bit more idiosyncrasy, but Zoë Saldana gives Uhura a sultry spark, and casting the puppyish Simon Pegg as the hyperkinetic Scotty is genius. As for Pine and Quinto, they really do feel, by the end, like Kirk and Spock. With a crew like this, you can welcome the future.


Blasting onto the screen at warp speed and remaining there for two hours, the new and improved �Star Trek� will transport fans to sci-fi nirvana. Faithful enough to the spirit and key particulars of Gene Roddenberry�s original conception to keep its torchbearers happy but, more crucially, exciting on its own terms in a way that makes familiarity with the franchise irrelevant, J.J. Abrams� smart and breathless space adventure feels like a summer blockbuster that just couldn�t stay in the box another month. Paramount won�t need any economic stimulus package with all the money it�ll rake in with this one globally, and a follow-up won�t arrive soon enough.
�Star Trek� here joins the James Bond series as the long-term �60s franchises that have been most successfully rebooted, although the current accomplishment is the more surprising since, after 10 films and a succession of TV series, �Star Trek� was widely thought to have exhausted itself. While respectfully handling the Roddenberry DNA, Abrams and longtime writing cohorts Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have transferred it to a trim new body that hums with youthful energy. 
As happened with Bond and �Casino Royale,� the Abrams team decided it would be best to go back to the beginning -- earlier, in fact, than the first TV show did in 1966 -- to show the origins of James Kirk and Spock and the launch of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Stir in a well-chosen cast of relative unknowns, a strong new villain, vastly updated special effects and a dynamic style that makes �Star Trek: The Motion Picture� look 60 years old rather than just 30, and you�ve planted the seed for a whole new generation of Trekkies.
A wham-bang 12-minute action prologue both clears the palette of residual series expectations and sets the table for the kind of excitement that�s amply in store. The script brims with backstory and future-story but never loses track of the present, in which young James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), a wild Iowa boy whose father sacrificed himself at the helm of a spaceship at the very moment the child was being born, is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to attend the Starfleet Academy with an eye to joining the crew of the Enterprise.
Headed for the same destination is Spock (Zachary Quinto), whose troubled background as a half-human, half-Vulcan is deftly sketched in. If the script has an overriding concern, it�s to map out how these two very opposite figures become mutually trusted colleagues, a key not only to this film but the entire series, past and future.
By the time Captain Pike says �Let�s punch it� at the 40-minute mark, the key crew is rounded out by professional pessimist Leonard �Bones� McCoy (Karl Urban), nobody�s fool Uhura (Zoe Saldana), the valued Sulu (John Cho) and a 17-year-old Russian brain named Chekov (Anton Yelchin).
Longtime fans will feel comfortable onboard the new Enterprise, which might be compared with the new Yankee Stadium; it�s spiffier and technically more up-to-date, but has a familiar ambiance. The costumes are similarly not out of place, but have been stripped of the dorky look that always seemed borderline laughable on TV.
More adventurous is the design for the space-borne behemoth called home by the ferocious Nero (Eric Bana). Resembling a tattooed, grizzled brother of Ralph Fiennes� Voldemort in the �Harry Potter� series, Nero wants to annihilate the Federated planets, most notably Vulcan and Earth. 
Unfortunately, Nero has the means to accomplish this in the form of drills that can cause a planet to implode. One of the film�s most spectacular setpieces has Kirk leading two others in a free-fall dive from space for one of these drills, then fighting off two big goons as the fate of a heavily populated planet hangs in the balance.
Exile to an ice planet, Delta Vega, enables Kirk to do some inadvertent time-traveling and meet an older version of Spock (Leonard Nimoy, in much more than a brief cameo), a happenstance that complicates matters on the space-time continuum.
�Star Trek� rockets along like a beautifully engineered vehicle you can�t help but admire for its design and performance. It shifts gears often but always smoothly, and accelerates again and yet again when you suspect it might be tempted to ease up for good. 
Pine�s Kirk exhibits an early tendency toward undue cockiness but suffers enough setbacks and rough surprises that the actor is forced into more varied and thoughtful responses. (Someone should decide about his hair color, however, as it varies from reddish to blond in different scenes.) Quinto makes for a very good young Spock, a man trying to define and perfect the kind of man he wants to be. Urban shows comic promise as the medic; Yelchin and Simon Pegg, the latter as a reputedly brainy engineer, prompt some real laughs; and Saldana is vibrant as the female crew member who bestows her favors on one officer to the exasperation of another. Bana is memorably scary as the villain.
Production and effects values are top-notch. Michael Giacchino�s score soars -- occasionally a bit too much, perhaps -- with real character and vigor.


It's difficult for this long-time Trekkie to review J.J. Abrams 's relaunching of the U.S.S. Enterprise  . It's difficult to dispassionately dole out compliments and complaints per the job description. Because, yes, the professional critic understands: This is Paramount Pictures ' latest effort to jump-start a profitable but long-stalled franchise, to do for James Kirk  what MGM did for James Bond . Studio execs know that just enough time has elapsed since the original to engender just enough nostalgia for characters named Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. For the professional critic, this reboot has all the trappings and trimmings of the quintessential summer blockbuster: shiny things that fly through outer space and make boom . Plus plenty of merch: Mommy, can I have a phaser ?
Good thing I'm not professional. Seriously, Mommy: Can I have a phaser?
Trekkies and civilians (those for whom William Shatner 's long-ago "Get a life!" jab didn't have the same sting) alike can rejoice: Not only does this Star Trek   proffer smart thrills and slick kicks, but it builds upon the original's history–from its very first pilot episode to Robert Wise 's 1979 Star Trek: The Motion Picture  and beyond–while creating an entirely new future.
Retooling Gene Roddenberry 's hoary, winded pop-cultural warhorse, Abrams has scrubbed, polished, and turned the volume up to 11 with admiration and affection for the original series, but little of the die-hard's encased-in-amber reverence. All at once, he's revived the corpse but wiped clean its memory–a fresh start. Star Trek is like all of the best offerings in the big-screen Trek series: "wonderful dumb fun," as Pauline Kael  wrote in her glowing review of 1982's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan , the franchise's high point from which Abrams and his longtime collaborators–writers Roberto Orci  and Alex Kurtzman , responsible for everything from Alias  to Mission: Impossible III –crib so many plot points that Star Trek  almost qualifies as a remake.
Even in a universe altered by that most worn-out of Trek plot devices–time travel–Abrams remains faithful to all of the things that transformed a modest science-fiction series, made popular in 1970s reruns, into a beloved touchstone. Trekkies already know half the dialogue by heart; it's the sampled soundtrack to a misspent youth in front of a television. Except now, it's set to the Beastie Boys ' "Sabotage."
The story is no more complicated than that of your best Trek  TV episode: A bad Romulan (Eric Bana , sporting the full Mike Tyson  face tattoo) has come from the future in a tricked-out spaceship to destroy the past (specifically, planets Vulcan and Earth). His motives are barely explained and even harder to understand–unless one has read the four-part prequel comic book, ahem. No matter: Like most Trek  baddies, Bana's Nero is decidedly besides the point; he's merely phaser fodder, the latest villain in possession of a doomsday machine who exists solely to threaten Vulcan and bring together on the bridge of the Enterprise Kirk (Chris Pine ), Spock (Zachary Quinto ), McCoy (Karl Urban ), Scotty (Simon Pegg ), Uhura (Zoe Saldana ), Sulu (John Cho ), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin ), who–at warp factor 10, red alert, damn the photon torpedoes–must save the universe, this time for the very first time.
The crew is a bunch of untested Starfleet cadets: Kirk is a know-it-all horndog with a penchant for green-skinned ladies; Pine plays him like he's starring in an episode of Dawson's Kirk. McCoy is, well, a simple country doctor who abhors space travel; some things never change, as Urban, among all the cast members, comes closest to spot-on imitation. As for the rest, places, please: Sulu is a guy who likes swords and steers the ship; Chekov is a wunderkind who speaks in a weddy, weddy tick Russian accent; Scotty is working miracles in the engine room; and Uhura is still trying to hail Starfleet on all frequencies to no avail. The more things change . . .
Spock is the centerpiece–not only as played by Quinto as the tormented youth in revolt raised by the Vulcan Sarek (Ben Cross ) and human Amanda (Winona Ryder , almost unrecognizable), but also in the form of Leonard Nimoy , the once-dead first officer who's lived long enough to travel back in time to offer sage advice to old friends in need of–dare one say it–the human touch. Nimoy's scenes elicit genuine emotion, not just the nostalgist's thrill of familiarity or the newcomer's delight at discovery. When Spock tells a young Jim Kirk , "I have been and always shall be your friend," or when he realizes a "Live long and prosper" salutation simply will not do, it's enough to move even a Star Wars  fan to tears.
