Early in Shut Up & Sing , we get to see the Treasonous Offending Clip: that moment during a 2003 concert in London when Natalie Maines, the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, made her infamous remark stating that the group was ashamed that George W. Bush is from Texas. I was surprised to discover that Maines delivers the comment demurely, as a slightly abashed naughty joke, and that it's really a bone-deep assertion of her Texas-hood  a line that tweaks the president for not being enough  of a true-blue longhorn'd good ol' boy.
In other words: It was downright un-American!  At least, it was for the legions of country fans who then turned on the group with a whiplash of hatred. Shut Up & Sing , co-directed by the ever-inquiring Barbara Kopple (American Dream , Harlan County USA ) and Cecilia Peck, is a lively, roving, surprisingly intimate backstage documentary that follows the Chicks as they deal with the lingeringly bitter fallout from that incident. Some of the film's terrain is familiar (their interview with Diane Sawyer, their nude tattooed-with-epithets appearance on the cover of EW  ), yet Kopple and Peck capture how, in a nation that has become a living media bubble, the Dixie Chicks weren't merely criticized. They were branded , and so they were forced to re-brand themselves, leaving behind the country fans and radio stations that had abandoned them, writing about the experience on their albums, bucking the rules of a lockstep entertainment industry that would have them  say it loud  shut up and sing. Through it all, Natalie Maines' decision to shirk humility, to stick by her guns, to the point that the group returns to that London concert venue in 2006 and she utters the same joke again, becomes a feisty and inspiring act of something there is only one word for: patriotism.

 On March 10, 2003, Natalie Maines fired a shot heard ’round the world. From a London stage, Ms. Maines, the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, declared, “Just so you know, we’re ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.”  Her remark, uttered on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq, when President Bush’s popularity was near an all-time high, had instant, negative repercussions. Overnight, the Dixie Chicks, America’s country-pop sweethearts, who had sung “The Star-Spangled Banner” less than two months earlier at the Super Bowl, found their music banished from much of country radio.  At angry rallies in the South, Dixie Chicks CD’s were gathered and destroyed, and Ms. Maines received death threats. How she, Martie Maguire and Emily Robison coped with the furor is the main subject of Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck’s documentary “Shut Up & Sing.”  On the surface, “Shut Up & Sing” is a modest film with no obvious axes to grind. As it follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years, it takes Ms. Kopple’s usual route and lets events speak for themselves. No talking heads appear to debate the politics of the Bush administration. Neither the group nor its manager, Simon Renshaw, sat for a formal interview.  Shifting back and forth between 2003 and the more recent past, as the trio prepares its newest album, “Taking the Long Way,” with the producer Rick Rubin, the movie offers a revealing case study of the relationship between politics, celebrity and the media in today’s polarized social climate. The hatred hurled at the Dixie Chicks seems outsized measured against an offhand remark at an overseas concert. As the Dixie Chicks would put it in their song “Not Ready to Make Nice”:  And how in the world can the words that I said  Send somebody so over the edge  That they’d write me a letter  Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing  Or my life will be over.  The movie also brings up the skirmishes between the Dixie Chicks and Toby Keith, the rowdy country star and superpatriot, which began in 2002 and heated up when Ms. Maines wore a T-shirt to the Academy of Country Music Awards bearing a four-letter acronym that could be interpreted as an obscene dig at him.  It all makes for a sad commentary on pop culture and public relations. The movie suggests how pop stars are marketed like politicians to targeted constituencies. Given the echo chamber of mass media feeding a public addiction to high drama, when an act like the Dixie Chicks goes against the beliefs of its “base” (to use a word favored by Republican strategists), reason is drowned out by noise, and there can be hell to pay.  The movie also implies that there is a double standard when it comes to celebrities’ speaking out: women are condescendingly assumed not to know their place.  The first question facing the Dixie Chicks after the incident: Should Ms. Maines eat her words and apologize? No way, she decides; she backtracks only so far as to say she supports American troops. The second question: Will the consequences of her decision rupture the solidarity of three women who call themselves a sisterhood? Another emphatic no.  To Ms. Maines’s surprise, the controversy doesn’t blow over in a week or two. The Dixie Chicks are forced to reassess their career and public image. Should they cultivate a blue-state audience? And if so, how far toward rock should they go? In their flashiest publicity stunt, they appear nude, their bodies stenciled with slogans, on the cover of Entertainment Weekly; they also go on the Bill Maher and Howard Stern shows.  The new album, “Taking the Long Way,” is finally released in May 2006 and sells one million copies within three weeks. But in the South the boycott persists. In a revealing scene of the concert business in action, ticket sales for a coming tour are monitored by computer from the moment they begin. It’s immediately apparent that sales in the South are weak, and so the itinerary is changed to take the group across Canada.  Although the movie focuses on Ms. Maines, it spends enough time with Ms. Maguire and Ms. Robison for us to get a sense of them. We meet Ms. Maguire’s twin daughters and observe the pregnancy of Ms. Robison, who had twins (a boy and a girl) in 2005. Ms. Maines has a historical perspective on it all. Coming from Lubbock, the birthplace of Buddy Holly, she recalls a time when Holly, an early rock ’n’ roller in a country music bastion, was no local hero.  The film’s generous helpings of the Dixie Chicks’ music culminate with thrilling performances of “The Long Way Around” and “Not Ready to Make Nice” from the recent album. Performing these anthems expressing passionate defiance and solidarity, the group has never sounded more vital and engaged.  “Shut Up & Sing” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language.

Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck have crafted an insightful and heartfelt look at the experiences of the Dixie Chicks over the last three years, chronicling the often bizarre consequences of singer Natalie Maines' anti-Bush wisecrack on a London stage. Maines' statement is captured in "Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing," as are the meetings where they plot how to circumvent the core country audience and, eventually, how to reroute a tour and cancel shows due to poor ticket sales. It's the rare thorough documentary on a musical act whose dilemmas are faced in the here and now, one that should win over fans of the Chicks on the fence and of music docus and perhaps create a little cultural stir as well.
Filmmakers have created a nonchronological story to emphasize the Greek tragedy behind the Dixie Chicks' spiral into country music's public enemy No. 1. The Chicks vs. President Bush, the Chicks vs. Toby Keith, the Chicks vs. country radio -- every antagonistic angle is covered, and yet Maines, Emily Robison and Martie McGuire persevere, with their chroniclers providing a sympathetic tone to their every struggle.
"Shut Up" identifies the Dixie Chicks as sincere and honest, a self-contained matriarchal community that doesn't back down and, per the doc's p.o.v., deserves support for its integrity alone.
Docu opens in the studio in 2005, a scene that will be revisited several times. It becomes a beacon of change for the Chicks as they work in the uncomfortable environs of Los Angeles and with unfamiliar collaborators and musicians from the rock world.
The sessions challenge the women's concepts of songwriting and making music to suit yourself rather than country radio; there's also the question of what exactly constitutes a Dixie Chicks song. The result will be "Taking the Long Way," though the film doesn't document how it subsequently debuted at No. 1 and sold 1 million copies in three weeks.
"Long Way," they discuss with regularity, was designed to expose them to a new, noncountry audience. Primarily, McGuire notes, "The record is our therapy."
The Chicks had been extraordinarily popular, as a flashback reminds viewers: They sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl in 2003 and announced a tour sponsorship deal with Lipton Tea. Shortly thereafter they head to Europe, starting in London.
Maines is seen backstage at Shepherds Bush Empire asking for an update on the just-launched war in Iraq; within hours -- with cameras rolling -- she offhandedly says, "We're ashamed the president is from Texas," the home state of both Bush and the Chicks. She makes the statement, turns to a bandmate and laughs.
The press makes hay of her comment, and the Chicks and management go into damage-control mode, which will last nearly three years. There's the famous nude Entertainment Weekly magazine cover shoot, the Diane Sawyer interview and the protests at concerts.
The Chicks are shown, at every turn, getting on with their lives mostly by focusing on their children and husbands. Maines is the spunkiest, the one whose initial instinct is to fight back. Even when her call is the wrong one -- she objects to starting the 2006 tour with smaller showcases before hitting arenas -- her defense is admirable and much more than a selfish whim.
Fly-on-the-wall feeling permeates the entire film, which is seamlessly edited while leapfrogging back and forth in time. Sound recording and editing are consistently topnotch regardless of the setting.
"Shut Up and Sing" was booked for a one-week Oscar-qualifying Los Angeles run prior to its Gala screening in Toronto.

When a red-blooded, macho, flag-waving, Bush-voting American country music fan looks at a gorgeous blonde who also happens to make his kind of music, one doesn't normally expect him to pay attention to the substance of her conversation. Dixie Chicks  lead singer Natalie Maines  didn't think so either, at first. Far from controversial once upon a time, the Chicks were simply playing to a London crowd on the eve of the Iraq  war, and Maines happened to mention that she and the audience were on the same side. Had there been no such thing as the blogosphere, the remarks might have gone unnoticed, but juiced up by the right-wing website Free Republic, Maines's comments led first to a national stir, then some boycotts, and now a movie, Shut Up & Sing .
In fact, the movie's not quite the Bush bashfest its publicity might lead you to believe; it's closer to the Metallica  doc Some Kind of Monster  than to Fahrenheit 9/11 . Like Metallica, the Dixie Chicks begin the film as a multiplatinum band looking to move their sound forward on a new album, only to have external circumstances throw a wrench into the works. The political angle is the film's hook, but its real goal seems to be to persuade noncountry fans who support the band's politics that, hey, y'know, their music's pretty good too.
The idea that popular music should never be political is, on the face of it, idiotic. Would you tell Bob Dylan  to just shut up and sing? Or System of a Down ? John Lennon ? Even country as a genre has not been free from impassioned ideals; Willie Nelson  and Johnny Cash  never shied away from populist issues, and Hank Williams Jr.  and Charlie Daniels  have been vocal in support of Republicans. The thing with the Dixie Chicks is that they were not a political band and never intended to be; ironically, by going all out in bashing the band for one comment, protesters generated a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Maines became hardened in her defiance, still "Not Ready to Make Nice."
Those still mad at Maines aren't going to be won overthe right-wing demonstrators interviewed on camera mostly come off as idiots, and Bill O'Reilly  is shown advocating that the Dixie Chicks be slapped around (though he'd no doubt claim that to be amusing hyperbole). But the most hilarious of the detractors is Toby Keith , who defends himself against Maines's criticism of his songwriting skills by saying, "She said anyone can write 'Boot in Your Ass,' but she didn't!"
