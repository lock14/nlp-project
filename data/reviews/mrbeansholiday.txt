There�s not much to say about Mr. Bean�s Holiday
, a semisequel to 1997�s Bean
, which found Atkinson�s tweedy, semi-verbal-bungling Englishman abroad in Los Angeles. If you like the character � his tooty yellow Mini, his busily working beetle brows, his tendency to point and grunt and eat shellfish whole � then you will be rewarded with 88 minutes of such. If you are not a fan, Holiday
 will not win you. Not even with its references to Jacques Tati (the film�s salute to Jour de F�te
 is prominently featured in the trailer), not even with Bean�s French moppet of a traveling sidekick (Baldry), not even with the winsome young actress (de Caunes) with whom Bean has a thankfully chaste attraction. At the end of the day, it�s either funny when Bean chases a chicken to get back his bus ticket, or it isn�t, and you know where you stand. There�s a satirical bit about a gasbag film director (Dafoe) premiering a ponderous pic at Cannes, Bean�s holiday destination, and I did laugh at Bean disguised as an old woman. (It was the hat.) Certainly Atkinson�s flair for being Bean has not diminished, and he still has the timing and physical control necessary for a satisfying performance of the role at feature length � though some reports suggest Atkinson intends to retire the character after this film. But in the final analysis, this Holiday
 is a so-so late-summer diversion, unlikely to reignite Beanmania � or repeat the previous film�s boffo box office. It�s worth noting that longtime collaborator Richard Curtis is absent from the credits, and while the G rating correctly suggests that the film is inoffensive to children, that doesn�t mean they won�t be terrified when a father and son are separated in a train station, leaving the boy in childlike (and occasionally mean-spirited) Bean�s dubious care.


You'll know how you feel about the new Mr. Bean movie, "Mr. Bean's Holiday," within 20 minutes, when our hero is throwing his sixth or seventh monkey face into the Sony
 DVD camera he totes everywhere. Either you'll find the man hilarious -- or he'll seem like one of those awful, tedious comedians who only thinks 
he's hilarious.
Maybe we're in the minority, but count me and the giddy 10-year-old one seat over definitely in the former camp. Proudly G-rated, "Mr. Bean's Holiday" is a throwback to a strain of gentle, purely visual Euro-slapstick that has all but died out in the past few decades. Even when the movie's coming up empty, you're glad it's in there pitching.
For those of you arriving late, Mr. Bean is the creation of British comic Rowan Atkinson, whom you may have met in his 1980s BBC/PBS series "Blackadder" or in "Johnny English" (2003). As seen in a long-running telly show and in the rather dreadful 1997 big-screen "Bean," the Mr. Bean character's a mostly silent clown made up of various bits: a dab of Chaplin, a smidgen of Pee-wee, a lot of Monty Python's Upper Class Twit. He's infantile but punctilious -- a refined idiot -- and Atkinson's rubbery face gives each of Bean's emotions the broad punch of a comic strip panel: proud, chagrined, sneaky, joyous.
In this outing, Mr. Bean wins a church raffle vacation to the south of France, but it's the getting there that takes up most of the movie. Mishaps abound with trains, buses, and automobiles, not to mention prawns and oysters. At one point, the film detours into a prolonged, borderline-surreal chase after a chicken with a ticket stuck to its foot, the gag's very corniness part of the joke.
Along the way, Bean picks up a traveling companion in a young boy (Max Baldry) separated from his father (Karel Roden). "Mr. Bean's Holiday" courts sentimentality at times, but the winsomeness is mostly theoretical. As scripted by a bevy of writers (including the gifted actor/playwright/pantomimist Simon McBurney), the movie is content to unfold at a lazy summer lope, each series of gags existing as a separate cell of comic invention.
Moviegoers with long memories will, of course, recognize the title's nod to 1953's "Mr. Hulot's Holiday," and the airy timing, if not the comic precision of the great Jacques Tati is honored here. A bit where Bean hitchhikes along a French roadside, waiting patiently as a moped traveling 2 miles per hour draws nearer (and nearer . . . and nearer . . .) is the sort of devilishly deadpan joke that American movies would flatten in their race to the finish line.
There are also a few gags stolen outright from Tati, as well as some plot developments "borrowed" from "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" and a little worse for wear. And there are the moments of unexpected genius: Bean and the boy acting out the aria "O Mio Babbino Caro" in a marketplace karaoke act that suddenly turns weirdly moving.
Eventually "Mr. Bean's Holiday" works its way to Cannes, where the hero picks up a sort-of love interest in a pert French actress (Emma de Caunes, very fetching) while bringing the pompous film director Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe) to grief. Here things turn merely silly, as opposed to inspired-silly. Dafoe isn't exactly known for his light comedy work, but at least he got a trip to France out of it, and so do we. In the film's charming denouement, the entire cast sings along to a French-language version of "Beyond the Sea," Mr. Bean finally reaches the beach, and the waves wash the letters "FIN" away. Somewhere, Jacques Tati is smiling.


Rowan Atkinson, his face in Mr. Bean's Holiday  as pinched and gleaming as a Richard Nixon mask, is still doing his bit to keep classic screen comedy alive. Once again, Mr. Bean, the childlike British idiot  he's the walking id as Twit of the Year  tries to extricate himself from the mishaps he creates, which only results in more spectacular disaster. On a holiday to France, Bean eats oysters (a great joke), then gets stranded in the country, which for a while strands the film. But Atkinson's goofball grotesquerie never lets up  right through to the inspired finale, which could have been called A Day at the Cannes Film Festival .

 With “Mr. Bean’s Holiday,” the British comedian Rowan Atkinson continues a tradition that in the right hands — Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati,  even Jerry Lewis in “The Bellboy” — never gets stale: comic pantomime. Or, in this case, near-pantomime, since Mr. Atkinson, in a sequel 10 years after  “Bean,” speaks, but only rarely. He doesn’t have to. His googly eyes, gangly physique and elastic countenance are just fine for delivering the goods.  The plot is simplicity itself: Mr. Bean wins a ticket to the South of France;  train-station confusion results in the separation of a boy and his father;  and it’s up to Mr. Bean to reunite them. But not before he has demonstrated the range of his slapstick, against a sun-drenched, candy-colored French countryside. The whole escapade ends up at the Cannes Film Festival, where Willem Dafoe does an amusing turn as a vain director.  As the clumsy, sometimes mischievous but mostly well-intentioned title character, Mr. Atkinson essentially plays a child (in grown-up attire), which is only proper, given the audience this movie is squarely directed at. Yes, there are subtitles involved, but so what? The kids at my screening loved it. Besides, at its heart, Mr. Atkinson’s movie, a huge hit overseas, speaks in an international language.  MR.

Ten years after his original pic outing, Rowan Atkinson's obnoxious Brit klutz rides again in the chucklesome, surprisingly warm but rarely laugh-out-loud "Mr Bean's Holiday." With its French setting and a title that directly recalls another silent comedy-like creation -- Jacques Tati's M. Hulot -- this is a thoroughly Euro bedmate to the 1997 "Bean," with the Gauls rather than the Yanks as the butt of Bean's bumblings. English doofus' worldwide fan club should respond to what Atkinson has stated is the character's final appearance, with a typically long life on ancillary.
Original grossed some $237 million worldwide, of which $45 million was garnered Stateside. With a similarly episodic structure, in which some bits work better than others, there seems to be no apparent reason why Bean's timeless appeal shouldn't reap equivalent returns. However, pic's film-buffy slant, with a finale at the Cannes Film Festival, won't mean much to the ankle-biting segment of Bean's audience.
After its March 22 preem in Singapore, the film goes wide throughout Europe on March 30. Stateside release is skedded for Sept. 28.
Opening reel, set in a rainy London in June, has Bean (Atkinson) winning a free holiday in the South of France during a church raffle. Film clicks into gear as Bean screws up his rail connection in Paris and, armed with a compass, causes chaos as he walks in a straight line across the city from La Defense to Gare de Lyon to catch the Riviera express. (Buster Keaton-like joke is replayed briefly, and even more cleverly, at the end of the movie as Bean makes his way to the beach.)
After killing time in the station restaurant -- cue typically Brit humor about French food, presided over by a superior maitre d' (vet Jean Rochefort) -- Bean has an encounter with Russian movie director Emil Duchevsky (Czech thesp Karel Roden), who's on his way with his young son, Stepan (newcomer Max Baldry), to sit on the Cannes jury.
Thanks to Bean, Emil gets left behind on the platform as the train pulls out of the station, taking Bean and Stepan with it. After losing his passport, ticket and money, Bean and the streetwise 10-year-old become unlikely traveling companions as they head south to Cannes -- Stepan to his father and Bean to his beloved beach.
Early on, the script (by comedy writer Hamish McColl and "Bean" regular Robin Driscoll) sets up a few threads that help bind the episodic material together. As part of his prize, Bean has won a vidcam, whose footage is interwoven heavily during the early reels and becomes a key plot element in the finale. Also, Bean and Stepan try various cell phone numbers to reach Emil, producing several funny vignettes scattered throughout the movie.
Once en route, the pic spends some time bonding the two characters, most successfully when they busk for money in a rural marketplace. Sequence foreshadows the movie's most inspired idea -- a heartwarming wrap-up with a rendering of the Charles Trenet classic "La Mer."
It's during the second half that the humor becomes more hit-and-miss, as Bean is separated from Stepan and becomes involved first in a WWII yogurt commercial that's being shot in rural France, then with its director, American art-film helmer Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe), whose latest snoozeroo, "Playback Time," is competing at Cannes. Festgoers will get a buzz out of scenes actually shot on the 2006 red carpet, but as a finale, it's all a bit too insiderish to deliver on a general level.
Onscreen the whole time, and with virtually no dialogue beyond "oui," "non" and, uh, "gracias," Atkinson is the whole movie, in a role that's essentially beyond critique. Even when an extended gag is not especially funny, thesp always has a big enough bag of physical mannerisms to fill in the dull patches.
Aside from Baldry, whose neat chemistry with Atkinson gives the pic some emotional underpinning, other thesps are basically decorative. Dafoe is well cast as the Amerindie "auteur"; French thesp Emma de Caunes (whose dad, Antoine, pops up briefly as a TV reporter) is OK as a wannabe actress who hooks up with Bean and Stepan.
Helming by British TV director Steve Bendelack, whose pic debut was another small-to-bigscreen outing, "The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse" (2005), is much slicker than Mel Smith's on 1997's "Bean." Though supportive of Atkinson's comic rhythms, Bendelack also brings a voice of his own to the visuals, notably in a roadside parody of Omar Sharif's entry in "Lawrence of Arabia." (Surprisingly, though, Clay's film-within-a-film could have been funnier.)
Feel-good score by Howard Goodall is a valuable assist throughout.
