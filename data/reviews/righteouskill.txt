Say it ain't so, Bobby and Al.
Much has been made about how Robert De Niro and Al Pacino seem to have stopped caring about making great movies, but keep working anyway. As hard as that may be for diehard fans to accept, their lackluster performances in director Jon Avnet's misbegotten crime thriller, "Righteous Kill," support the rap.
De Niro and Pacino play veteran New York City detectives who are tired of watching criminals get away with rape, murder, and other heinous acts because of judicial loopholes. Lucky for them, the worst of the thugs start showing up dead, thanks to an apparently like-minded serial killer, who also leaves a poem alongside each corpse. It's as if TV's Dexter failed Poetry 101. Also on the case is a rough-sex-loving crime-scene specialist (Carla Gugino) and two up-and-coming police officers 
(John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg) who are convinced the killer is a cop.
If it sounds interesting, it isn't. The script by Russell Gewirtz ("Inside Man") is convoluted and often silly; an amusing exchange about the cartoon "Underdog" ultimately feels like Tarantino lite and Avnet
 ("Fried Green Tomatoes") manages to make New York exteriors (the ones that weren't filmed in Bridgeport, Conn.) appear bland and un-cinematic. De Niro scowls his way through most of the movie, and though Pacino starts out strong, he ultimately can't restrain himself and hams up the ending. The pair's mythic collaboration in Michael Mann's "Heat" is a distant memory.
Attention Martin Scorsese, Paul Thomas Anderson, or even Tarantino: Please come calling with some juicy comeback or Oscar-worthy part. Because when actors are as great as De Niro and Pacino, watching them in a movie like "Righteous Kill" is deadly.


 Oh, if only Robert Aldrich were alive! The pulpmeister of the horror lollapalooza “What Ever  Happened to Baby Jane?” certainly knew how to build a grand showcase for his corrugated divas (Bette Davis and Joan Crawford), while the hapless Jon Avnet hasn’t a clue what to do with his (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro). In “Righteous Kill” these two godheads of 1970s cinema go macho-a-macho with each other — furrowing brows, bellowing lines, looking alternately grimly serious and somewhat bemused  —  in a B-movie (more like C-minus) duet that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears.  Mr. De Niro and Mr. Pacino have squared off only once  before on the big screen, in Michael Mann’s 1995 thriller, “Heat,” in which they spent most of the film in separate story lines, joined only by the parallel editing and a late-act, disappointingly anticlimactic meeting at a diner. They share far more face time in “Righteous Kill,” playing well-seasoned New York City Police Department detectives and long-term partners who take turns clucking at each other like hens while swaggering around town like gamecocks. True to strut, pouf and wattles, Mr. Pacino’s cop goes by Rooster, while Mr. De Niro is just Turk, which doesn’t appear to be short for Turkey, though it sure does help to pass the time if you think about it.  Time, alas, doesn’t so much pass in “Righteous Kill” as crawl, despite the usual overcutting, which tries to pump energy into the inert proceedings. Mr. Avnet, whose last movie was the clunker “88 Minutes” (one of Mr. Pacino’s worst), is not a natural director, to put it kindly. His handiwork is most evident in the unsteady tone, though to be fair it’s always hard to know who deserves most of the blame for this kind of star-struck, suit-crammed (eight producers, three executive producers, one co-producer) mush. Suffice it to say that everything from the camera placement to the cheap use of the consistently good, lamentably underemployed Carla Gugino is shoddy. (Note to Mr. Avnet: Yes, Ms. Gugino has breasts, but, really, her acting is more interesting.)  Like most actors, Mr. Pacino and Mr. De Niro need a strong hand, some kind of visionary authority to put them in their best light and prevent them from leaning on the tics and tricks  —  Mr. Pacino tends to turn up the volume, while Mr. De Niro glowers until he looks ready to pop  —  that now too often mar their performances. “Righteous Kill,” a clutter of recycled cop-movie and serial-killer film clichés (it’s hard to believe that the screenwriter, Russell Gewirtz, also wrote “Inside Man”), is far from their worst effort. And the two have some nice moments with each other and some of the other actors. Mr. Pacino seems to be genuinely moved during his final showdown with Mr. De Niro, or maybe he’s just a sweet sentimental fool.  “Righteous Kill” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Ample gun violence, crude language and female bosoms.

After occupying separate timeframes in �The Godfather: Part II� and sharing just a few minutes of �Heat,� two iconic actors finally get a significant chunk of screen time together -- if not the material they deserve -- in �Righteous Kill,� the third and by no small margin the weakest crime picture to topline Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. At once groaningly predictable and needlessly convoluted, this gimmicky yarn about New York cops trailing a vigilante in their midst could nonetheless make a sufficient B.O. killing, assuming Overture Films can tempt auds with a dream pairing that promises more than it delivers.
�Righteous Kill� primes the viewer to suspect a red herring from its miscalculated opening scene: a scratchy, black-and-white videotape of an aging homicide detective (De Niro), known to his fellow officers as Turk, openly confessing that he�s committed 14 murders during his 30-plus years with the NYPD.
As Turk says in his defense, these 14 victims -- a pimp, a drug dealer, a rapist, a pedophile priest and various other scourges on society who had successfully eluded prosecution -- all had it coming. (The killer�s highly literate m.o. is to leave a sinister poem at every crime scene; talk about poetic justice.) The screenplay by Russell Gewirtz (�Inside Man�) lurches back and forth in time as Turk, in a voiceover that tries too hard to spin world-weary cynicism into pulp profundity, details the murders and his colleagues� attempts to solve them.
As played by De Niro with his trademark short fuse and staccato expletives, Turk is all too easily provoked to violence; he�s kept in line by his longtime partner, Rooster (Pacino), whose early dialogue consists almost entirely of telling his more hot-headed pal to relax. Rounding out the team are gorgeous crime-scene investigator Karen Corelli (Carla Gugino), with whom Turk has vigorous sex on the side, and ambitious up-and-comers Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) and Simon Perez (John Leguizamo), who quickly convince themselves that only a fellow cop -- specifically, Turk -- could have executed these lowlifes.
As early as the 20-minute mark, it�s clear enough where all this is headed, so it�s unfortunate that the film takes roughly another 75 minutes to get there. Unable or unwilling to match the visceral chops and moral provocations of superior serial-killer chillers, �Righteous Kill� is content to be a twisty genre exercise; it�s like �Seven� as reimagined by M. Night Shyamalan.
And so, despite the easy, instinctive rapport between De Niro and Pacino, who are both very much at home playing rough-edged men of action -- and who settle almost immediately into pleasurable buddy-comedy rhythms that bespeak decades of trust earned in the line of duty -- pic provides a meager showcase for the combustible duo. If the sight of these two thesps onscreen can�t help but generate a frisson of excitement, �Righteous Kill� ultimately makes a good case for keeping them apart: There�s no sense of the doomed spiritual kinship that seemed to bind the actors across time and space in their previous films, and Gewirtz�s tortuous scenario allows them little breathing room.
Elsewhere, Gugino brings an appealing toughness to the much-coveted Karen, who�s often on the receiving end of lewd banter from her male peers, and Trilby Glover shows some sparkle as a coke-snorting lawyer who goes undercover for Turk and Rooster. The fine Melissa Leo, however, is wasted in a throwaway role as a grief-stricken mother.
Though likely to enjoy a longer, friendlier reception than �88 Minutes,� pic reps another head-scratching collaboration between Pacino and director Jon Avnet (one of the 12 producers credited here). With d.p. Denis Lenoir and editor Paul Hirsch, Avnet has assembled an erratic tech package bogged down by portentous slow-mo, tinted flashbacks and other stylistic distractions. Bridgeport, Conn., doubles unpersuasively as a weirdly underpopulated Manhattan, despite some shooting in Brooklyn, Queens and Harlem.
