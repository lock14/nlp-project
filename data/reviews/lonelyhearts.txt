         When is a detective story not a detective story? Answer: When it's writer-director Todd Robinson's measured take on his grandfather's real-life pursuit of the lovers Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, a notorious pair of killers of the late 1940s whose bloody spree left at least four women and one child dead.
 
 In "Lonely Hearts," John Travolta plays Robinson's grandfather, Elmer Robinson, a  burned-out homicide detective in New York's  Nassau County Police Department who is spurred into action when the snow-white body of a beautiful young woman is found bathed in the deep crimson of her own blood. The death is written off as a suspected suicide but for the brooding and introverted Robinson, it's an opportunity to make up for a mysterious death he can't solve — his wife's by her own hand.
 


         






   The film alternates between Robinson's search for the killers and the exploits of Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Beck (Salma Hayek).  Fernandez starts out as a two-bit Casanova con man who preys on spinsters and war  widows he contacts  through "lonely hearts" matchmaking rags. His game of seduction, however, moves from money to murder when he hooks up with the beautiful but damaged Beck.
 
 Beck's insane jealousy fuels the relationship and the murders, which are disturbing and difficult to watch both in terms of their graphic nature and the callousness with which they are committed.
 
 As the deliciously psychotic Beck, Hayek delivers most of the film's best lines and dominates the screen with her presence, whether dressed to the nines in a revealing cocktail dress or scrubbing blood off the floor in a matronly nightgown.
 
 In contrast, Travolta, with his perennially hunched shoulders and overly subdued manner, wears the role of the contemplative detective like an ill-fitting suit. To be fair, Todd Robinson gives Travolta surprisingly little material to work with given the first-time director's familial connection with the character. Robinson says little and does even less as the pieces fall much too easily into place as he tracks the impulsive couple.
 
 While not much of a detective story, Robinson's period film (the third based on the so-called "Lonely Hearts" killings) does provide a captivating look at the dynamics that turn Fernandez and Beck into serial killers. In fact, Fernandez strikes an almost sympathetic figure as he remains in the destructive relationship with  Beck not so much because he's in love with her, but because he's afraid of her.
 
 "Lonely Hearts." MPAA rating: R for strong violence and sexual content, nudity and language. Running time: 1 hour, 48 minutes. In selected theaters.   

Jared Leto, looking and acting like a scrawny, pimpish Jim Carrey, is Ray, who scams lonely women out of their savings. Salma Hayek, at her most smeary-lipped voluptuous, is his lover, who poses as his sister  until she jealously slaughters his victims. It's  all based on the same case that inspired The Honeymoon Killers , but Lonely Hearts  never locates the key to the killers' bloody bond. Leto and Hayek, though, make their erotic psychohistrionics fun, and John Travolta and James Gandolfini, as cops, work up a dour camaraderie.

 Correction Appended  Ever since “The Godfather: Part 2” artistically ambitious crime dramas have superimposed gloomy philosophical reveries over  blood and guts. That certainly is the dynamic of “The Sopranos,” one of the few  that have managed to  generate a tragicomic dialogue out of this double vision. Ordinarily, however,  the metaphysics  are smothered under the splatter.  “Lonely Hearts,” a beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle’s 1970 cult B-movie “The Honeymoon Killers”  — which was based on the actual crimes of the couple known as the Lonely Hearts Killers —  succeeds better than many in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although  its villains’ dirty deeds  still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. Let’s face it: It’s more exciting to  watch Jared Leto, as Ray Fernandez, a lean, cocky con man and self-styled stud, put the moves on the credulous, love-starved women he meets through lonely-hearts clubs  than to contemplate the despair of Elmer  Robinson (John Travolta), the detective investigating Ray’s crimes.  As he often does when he steps out of the Hollywood mainstream, Mr. Travolta surprises with the depth of his acting. Elmer is a Long Island detective whose face is scrunched into a scowl of glum perplexity through most of the movie. Already eroded by years of grim police work, his faith in law and order  — and in humanity  — has crumbled after the unexplained suicide of his wife, who early in the film is found after shooting herself; it happens on their wedding anniversary, no less.  Elmer is estranged from his 15-year-old son, Eddie (Dan Byrd),  and treats his girlfriend, Rene (Laura Dern), who works in his precinct, with despicable callousness. That you still feel for  him is a triumph of Mr. Travolta’s wonderfully interior performance.  Elmer is balanced by James Gandolfini’s portrayal of his partner, Charles Hildebrandt, who sporadically narrates the movie and has the bulk of its wisecracking, hard-boiled dialogue. This is Tony Soprano as played by a less overbearing Broderick Crawford, on the right side of the law for once, but still formidable.  Despite all the care put into these characters, the killers carry the day as surely as the losers and lowlifes carried it in last year’s neo-noir “Hollywoodland,” which was set in roughly  the same period. (Most of “Lonely Hearts” takes place in 1949.) Far more unsettling than the discovery of  Elmer’s dead wife is a later scene in which Ray’s partner in crime, Martha Beck (Salma Hayek),  catches him having sex with another woman.  Martha shoots her from behind,  then straddles  Ray and keeps the action going while her victim tumbles to the floor  in a pool of blood.  “Lonely Hearts” is the directorial debut of Todd Robinson, grandson of the real-life Elmer, to whom the movie is dedicated.  Shot in desaturated shades by Peter Levy, it is at least the third  movie (after “The Honeymoon Killers” and the well-regarded 1996 Mexican film “Deep Crimson”) based on  the Lonely Hearts Killers, who were executed at Sing Sing in 1951 after committing a string of murders.  It is worth noting the differences between the villains in “Lonely Hearts” and the real criminals, who were portrayed much more accurately by Shirley Stoler and Tony Lo Bianco in the harsh, black-and-white “Honeymoon Killers.” The real Martha Beck, an ex-nurse who weighed more than 200 pounds — her execution had to be delayed because her body was too large to fit into the electric chair  —  was nothing like Ms. Hayek’s demented femme fatale. Ms. Hayek’s predatory beauty changes everything. Mr. Leto’s Ray Fernandez is closer to Patrick Swayze in “Dirty Dancing” or Christopher Walken in “Roseland” than to a lowlife Latino con man;  his accent is barely discernible.  But as fictional characters in a movie that is fetishistic in its attention to period detail, Mr. Leto and Ms. Hayek work well together as an unsavory couple two rungs down the social ladder from Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in “Double Indemnity.” Ms. Hayek’s Martha, a victim of childhood incest who begins as one of Ray’s marks and becomes his dominating, fiercely possessive lover, is a scary sociopath  whose twisted sense of self-esteem derives from the power she exerts over him. That he’s willing to kill for her makes her feel like queen of the world.  Mr. Leto, strutting around in a toupee, is the spitting image of a vain, small-time gigolo high on his own oily charms. Once Martha gets her hooks into him, he metamorphoses from  tarnished smoothie to  trapped animal. The film allows Ray no dignity. At his execution the camera stares unblinkingly as he is dragged, shouting and kicking, to the electric chair.  We hear the screams beneath his mask as smoke pours from his body. It may not be intentional, but “Lonely Hearts” appears to be ardently in favor of capital punishment.  “Lonely Hearts” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, gore and profanity.  Correction: April 12, 2007  A film review in Weekend on Friday about “Lonely Hearts” referred incorrectly to the suicide of the wife of the central character, the detective Elmer Robinson. She shoots herself; she does not slash her wrists. 

The lurid love story of infamous 1940s Lonely Hearts Killers Martha Beck and Ray Fernandez previously spawned two fringe movie masterpieces: Leonard Kastle's black-and-white cult fave "Honeymoon Killers" and Arturo Ripstein's operatically Mexican "Dark Crimson." The odds of a notable Hollywood remake, however -- especially one casting svelte Salma Hayek as the notoriously overweight Beck -- would seem unlikely; yet, in "Lonely Hearts," helmer/scribe Todd Robinson constructs a riveting thriller that contrasts the sleazy elegance of Hayek and Jared Leto's lethal duo with the lumbering, beefy persistence of cops John Travolta and James Gandolfini. Accomplished period piece could conceivably make a killing at the box office.
In their incarnations as Beck in the earlier films, both Shirley Stoler and Regina Orozco used obesity (the real Beck was so fat that her execution was delayed when she couldn't fit into the electric chair) to add to the grotesquerie and pathos of the character's obsessive romantic attachment to her slight, balding Romeo. 
Hayek's gorgeous, shapely murderess is a very different proposition, exuding such possessive malevolence and force of will that the viewer can almost identify with Leto's lightweight lothario, helpless to resist his lover's increasingly homicidal demands. 
Director Robinson's new take on the oft-filmed saga not only slims down the villainess but ushers in the hitherto undramatized role of the New York policeman who collared the pair. This detective, Elmer Robinson (Travolta), is the helmer's real-life paternal grandfather. 
The unexplained suicide of the Travolta character's wife under the opening credits provides the psychological link between the cops and robbers as Robinson is called to investigate the suicide of a victim of Beck and Fernandez. 
With Gandolfini's fellow cop Charles Hildebrandt playing protective Watson to Robinson's neurotic Holmes. Gandolfini's character, like Leto's Fernandez, is swept up in a scenario he only half understands.
 Pic's weird symmetry is such that the killers sink further and further into their romantic dementia, while Robinson slowly recovers from his morose guilt over his wife's death and begins a relationship with squad room squeeze Rene (Laura Dern). 
As in Kastle's breakthrough postmodern exercise, pic's deadpan, matter-of-fact depiction of violence renders it as shocking as it is unglamorous. In a startling scene, the killers' first victim (a nervously enamored Alice Krige) is bludgeoned from behind as she is riding fiance Fernandez; she falls out of the frame to be replaced by Beck, the couple proceeding to make passionate love while the bloody Krige convulses on the ground. This unblinking, straight-ahead approach to violence climaxes in the back-to-back scenes of the couple's state-mandated electrocutions, each shown in excruciating detail. 
In Kastle and Ripstein's films, Fernandez and Beck were seen as almost tragic. Not so in Robinson's treatment, where they register as outright sociopathic monsters. Indeed, in many ways, Robinson's script reads as a nuanced endorsement of an eye-for-eye death penalty. 
Performers are splendidly cast. Gandolfini, in classic character actor mode, lends an effective 1940s presence to the film (as he did to the Coen brothers' "The Man Who Wasn't There"), and Travolta's weary corpulence speaks of countless years on a thankless beat. 
But it is Beck's evil that dominates the film: Like some beautiful snake, Hayek embodies the ultimate femme fatale redeemed by no discernible tragic flaw. 
Totally organic, never seeming jerrybuilt or artificially decorated, Jon Gary Steele's '40s-flavored production design comes alive as cops shamble around their precinct, Peter Levy's camera stressing the flatfoots' physicality in classic bygone cinema style. Rural locations likewise achieve a convincingly old-timey quality, the lines of laundry in the sun and the mold on disused bathtubs feeling unquestionably authentic.

Slipped into release with an ominous lack of fanfare, this star-studded noir thriller is a halfhearted attempt to recast The Honeymoon Killers  and Deep Crimson , both of which were based on the 1940s case of a couple who preyed on and murdered lonely women. Lonely Hearts  is more humdrum than terrible, in large measure because writer-director Todd Robinson  drains the focus from the killer couplerendered with panache and self-amused flourish by Salma Hayek  and Jared Leto and places it on Elmer C. Robinson , the damaged but dull policeman who's on their trail, played in a sepulchral monotone by jowly John Travolta , as his more worldly sidekick James Gandolfini  superfluously narrates. Todd Robinson is the grandson of the real-life Elmer, which may be why the movie, shot in trite period sepia and littered with the usual blood-red fingernails, never fully commits to the heartlessness of the genre as Arthur Penn  did in Bonnie and Clyde . Robinson insists on saddling his prize psychos with motives, and evil invariably loses its pizzazz when it's explained away. Neither funny nor persuasively tragic, Lonely Hearts  ends up merely unpleasant in its fixation with the hydraulics of orgasms and electric chairs.
