Something New
 at first feels an awful lot like something old, or at least familiar, with its easy-bake romantic-comedy trappings. Think Bridget Jones
' lovelorn but marriage-obsessed single woman, only make her a neat-freak, not a basket case, and a comely African-American, not a plumpish, pasty Brit. Kenya McQueen (the terrifically appealing Lathan) is a power walker and a powered accountant about to make partner, with a powerful predilection for beige-ing everything in her newly bought single-gal pad. But her back yard's a mess: overgrown, sorely neglected, and as subtle a metaphor for her romantic atrophy as a hoe to the head. And who better to wield that hoe then Kenya's hot new landscape architect? (Romantic comedy, of course, isn't just about meet-cutes, but personal improvement and the weeding out of undesirable character traits via the intervention of a good man.) And yet, this is where Something New
 throws a curveball: Kenya, who has a very strict list of essentials for her IBM (that's Ideal Black Man), finally meets him in the form of her strapping gardener. She just wasn't expecting him to be so � white. Brian (Baker) is practically dipped in bleach, then set in bronze, from his golden-boy locks to the golden retriever sitting shotgun in his monster truck. Brian's a sensitive sort, fond of hiking and aw-shucks-isms like "I'm just a landscaper � I take hard earth and make things bloom." At first, his character's the butt of (some pretty funny) white-boy jokes; he then upgrades to a much-ogled piece of man-meat (also pretty funny). But give him time: He gets better, more game, and the same can be said for Something New
. Once the film stops spinning its wheels in rom-com clich�s, it gains traction and even a few moments of transcendence, especially in a scene in which the pair weaves in and out of a grocery store and most plainly speaks � then shouts � about their relationship dynamic as it sinks under the weight of their racial expectations and frustrations. But if first-time director Sanaa Hamri and writer Kriss Turner tweak genre conventions, they never toy with genre expectations � we're here to be wooed, after all � and Something New
, in its endearingly daft third act, manages the neat feat of feeling sweetly inevitable rather than boilerplate predictable. The film has its missteps and some dangling threads (what the hell was Cheers
' sad-sack postman John Ratzenberg doing ducking in the last frame?), but sometimes you have to go with the gut � or, in my case, a dumb grin � and, for better or for worse, give in to a good-feeling film.


In "Something New," Sanaa Lathan plays a single, upscale, have-it-all Los Angeles professional named Kenya McQueen. Because Kenya is all these things and an African-American woman, she's also faced with the annoying reality that the pickings of worthy black men are slim. But she and her girlfriends believe their I.B.M.
 (ideal black man) is out there, and he'll come along. While Kenya waits, a friend sets her up on a blind date with Brian (Simon Baker), a white landscape architect.
Sure she turns snobby and hostile, then terminates their first meeting. But he doesn't care. Brian fixes up Kenya's garden and seduces her into being his girlfriend. He tells her she needs some color in her
 life. Their relationship hits speed bumps because no one in her world approves and she's obviously ashamed of him. He puts up with it anyway, as though she were the only hot black yuppie in town.
This is an inept and unsubtle romantic fantasy about how black people and white people don't mix. The movie has to find interracial dating absolutely shocking in order eventually to say, "Never mind, ladies. Date all the white guys you want."
The success of Paul Haggis's "Crash" proved that the only way for an American movie to deal with the problem of race is to drop it on an audience's head like an anvil. "Something New" is a similarly blunt object. There's a profound way for the races to talk to each other (or not to), but Hollywood doesn't seem to have figured it out.
Instead, Kenya seems forced into racializing her frustrations at work, and Brian is made to appear insensitive for not wanting to hear her vent. This is a useful way to kick off a town-hall meeting. It's a terrible start for a love affair.
Sanaa Hamri directed this movie (it's her first feature) and Kriss Turner wrote the screenplay, and neither will drum any logic into Kenya. Would a woman this professional and this together, raised by academics and educated at predominantly white institutions, blanch at the idea
 of dating a man of another race? Especially one this handsome, independent, and polite? There might be several plausible reasons for her not to date Brian, but the movie doesn't allow her to articulate them.
The problem isn't just Kenya's. Her brother (Donald Faison) calls Brian "the help" and won't even shake his hand. Her mother (Alfre Woodard) is even haughtier. (The McQueens aren't the Huxtables; they're the Carringtons.) Were Brian black and Kenya named, I don't know, Paris, and if her family and friends were as rude to him, we'd be expected to find their behavior appalling. The movie's perceptions of black and white are so petty that race begins to seem like the stupidest hang-up in the world.
Kenya is as chronically dissatisfied as a lot of ambitious people, which makes her dilemma rich with social comedy. But "Something New" takes forever to turn progressive. The audience is smarter than the movie right up to the end, when someone finally clears up the apparent mystery. "The boy is white," says Kenya's dad. "He's not a Martian." Great, now he tells us.

         There's not really anything fresh about the romantic dramedy "Something New." Although its producer, Stephanie Allain ("Hustle & Flow"), characterizes it as "the first interracial love story of the 21st century with a black woman and a white man," and as forgettable as the 2005 Bernie Mac-Ashton Kutcher mash-up "Guess Who" was, the interracial romance is no longer much of a novelty.
 
  "Something New" can be aptly reduced to "Guess Who's Landscaping a Little More Than the Backyard" with its story of a proud African American professional woman (Sanaa Lathan), her search for an IBM (ideal black man) and the white landscape architect (Simon Baker) who artfully woos her. A first feature from Sanaa Hamri, who has directed music videos and concert footage for Prince and Mariah Carey, it's superficial and formulaic but pleasant enough to entertain and qualifies as intelligent and sophisticated by the current standard of Hollywood comedy.
 


         






    Lathan stars as Kenya McQueen, a tightly wound senior manager at a Westwood accounting firm. She's successful and from a good family — her father (Earl Billings) is a doctor, her brother Nelson (Donald Faison) is a lawyer, and her mother (Alfre Woodard) is a shopper supreme. Kenya works hard, hangs out with a trio of equally thriving girlfriends (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Golden Brooks, Taraji P. Henson) and has just bought a nice home in View Park with a grotty backyard.
 
  Dismayed at being part of the 42.4% of black women who have never married, Kenya grudgingly accepts a blind date. When Brian turns up at Starbucks, Kenya is visibly uncomfortable and politely rejects him. Though his surfer good looks make him stand out like a lone marshmallow in a half-gallon of rocky road ice cream, it's only Kenya's reaction that draws any real attention to them. Circumstances conspire to have Brian do a remarkable renovation of Kenya's untended backyard, allowing him the opening to loosen her up considerably. Think "Extreme Makeover: Romance Edition."
 
  The metaphors and innuendos fly fast and furiously, if heavy-handedly, with Brian modestly proclaiming that what he does is "take hard earth and make things bloom." Despite her resistance, Kenya is soon letting her hair down and adding color to her life by splashing paint on her blandly beige walls.
 
  Even as happiness threatens to consume them, Kenya and Brian hit a bump in their relationship and a convenient option arrives. Nelson introduces her to his mentor, corporate legal eagle Mark Harper (Blair Underwood), who's relocating from Phoenix and practically has "IBM" stamped on him.
 
  As is too often true of most romantic-movie rivals, Mark is no real competition. He may fit Kenya's image of the perfect guy, but he's also chauvinistic and deadly dull, hardly a match for Brian's skill at cultivating her heart. Once Kenya gets past her biases, there's no real obstacle to a happy ending.
 
  The movie nicely captures the area around Baldwin Hills, is crisply written by Kriss Turner and portrays the upper-middle class black community seldom seen in mainstream TV and film. However, the characterizations, even the leads, rarely rise above archetypes. The film's lack of depth as it oversimplifies the complexities of racism keep it from being anything other than a lightweight date movie.
 
 'Something New'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for sexual references   

At the start of the interracial romantic comedy Something New , Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) doesn't have a groove to lose, so there's no point trying to get it back. A beautiful, educated thirtysomething African-American executive on her way to making partner at a fancy L.A. accounting firm, she's a go-getter who's got everything except a man. New house of her own? Check. Well-made suits and an expensive hair weave? Done. Attractive TV-type black girlfriends with whom to commiserate about the elusive IBM  Ideal Black Man? Yep. Kenya is no charity case  she's the daughter of snobby African-American elites, a flower of black society  but she does stoop to accepting a blind date set up by a (white, Jewish) office mate. Leave it to those naively liberal Jews: Guess who's coming to dinner? Brian Kelly (Aussie hunk Simon Baker), irreversibly white, is the very opposite of a black man, so Kenya ditches him as a date (she's a formidable paragon of goal-setting self-discipline), hires him as the landscape architect he is, and begins the slow learning curve toward letting new love in, even as it means letting go of old assumptions. (Lest the deck look too stacked, Blair Underwood shows up as an official IBM.)
Of course, the deck is stacked. And the movie  a feature-directorial debut by Sanaa Hamri, with a script by TV vet Kriss Turner  is a shaky piece of work, with stumpy cinematography, choppy edits, speechy dialogue, and loose plotlines. And yet: There's an easygoing authenticity to the depiction of Kenya and her world  as well as to the serious issues between black women and white men  that coexists with the picture's many weaknesses. In other words, out of a genre stereotype rut, Something New  finds a way to exhale.

 LIKE those other big-screen intangibles, chemistry is easier to recognize than explain. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman combust beautifully in Hitchcock's "Notorious," while the then-married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman just sputter in Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," two soggy sticks without the requisite friction. In "Ocean's Eleven," George Clooney relieved Brad Pitt of the burden of being the most beautiful man in the room, and the results were nose-tickling fizzy, as playfully sexy and artless as the most classic of screwball pairings.  In "Something New," a pleasantly diverting romance about a black woman (Sanaa Lathan) and a white man (Simon Baker) forced to transcend prejudice, hair extensions and a few awkwardly staged scenes in order to be with each other, the chemistry between the leads is as unmistakable as the setup is contrived. As Kenya McQueen, a top executive in a Los Angeles accounting firm, Ms. Lathan wears the kind of smart suits that speak (never shout) consummate professionalism. Kenya lives to work, and if her datebook remains blank after-hours such is the apparent price for being young, successful and the new owner of a tastefully appointed house with a garden in desperate need of plowing and planting. Enter the gardener, Brian (Mr. Baker), muscles rippling.  Reader, he digs her  —  and she digs him, this being a Hollywood fantasia. First comes k-i-s-s-i-n-g, and then comes some lightly steamed boudoir nuzzling, including the best toenail-polishing since "Lolita," followed by the expected complications with family and friends. The lovely Ms. Lathan, who established her big-screen bona fide a few years ago in another romance, "Love & Basketball," and the similarly attractive Mr. Baker, an underemployed Australian who waxes hot ("L.A. Confidential") and cold ("The Ring Two"), don't just look good together; they feel right in sync. Their easy, sensual rapport partly owes something to the generally sure hand of the film's director, Sanaa Hamri, making a fine feature debut, and something else, something indefinable, to the delectable mysteries of two bodies in cinematic motion.  The screenplay, written by another newcomer, Kriss Turner, places those bodies in some familiar situations (a clinch in the rain), but it also gives the actors more than the usual romantic fluff and nonsense. Race is the obvious complicating factor here, but it is class  —  the perception as well as the reality of such difference  —  that gives the story its piquancy. The daughter of a prominent doctor (Earl Billings, who has the warmly gruff thing down) and a status-conscious mother (the reliably entertaining Alfre Woodard), Kenya works and plays according to the rules. For her that means extensions, not her natural curl, and a quest for what she and her friends call the IBM  —  or Ideal Black Man  —  a mate of impeccable pedigree and comparable earnings.  Brian throws Kenya for a loop not only because he's white, but also because he has dirt under his fingernails. As it turns out (this being a Hollywood fantasia), he isn't actually an inarticulate earthy brute out of D. H. Lawrence or Harlequin, but a landscape architect. Still, the battered ride, devoted golden retriever, community-garden work, rumpled jeans and artfully applied smudges are enough to give a former debutante pause. "He's the help," exclaims Kenya's brother, Nelson  (Donald Faison), after he refuses to shake Brian's hand. A buppie with a sports car and a succession of equally expensive girlfriends (one of whom speaks pitch-perfect Valley Girl), Nelson  is a model of clueless consciousness, a man who chides his sister for crossing the color line even as he goes through women like Kleenex.  For the most part, the Moroccan-born Ms. Hamri, who has directed music videos for Prince and Mariah Carey, among others, sells the story's tougher bits as well as she does the mush. The filmmaker has a nice sense of some of the less cinematically exploited areas of Los Angeles, like the upscale black neighborhood where Kenya lives and power walks, and the Magic Johnson Starbucks where she first meets Brian on a squirmingly uncomfortable blind date that says more about racial anxiety than the entirety of "Crash." "Something New" is a love story, but it is also very much about the education (and liberation) of a thoroughly modern miss who wears her identity as an Ideal Black Woman with righteous pride and, at times, a bit like armor.  "Something New" isn't especially new, which is actually part of its low-key charm. There's something reliably agreeable about watching two pretty people go through the usual romantic motions, especially since Big Hollywood seems to have more or less given up on love, perhaps because it's also more or less given up on women. This year's Oscar race, with its pathetic lineup of nominees for best actress and a specialty-division frontrunner about two men in love, offers further proof of just how inconsequential distaff stories now are to the majors. Which, in turn, partly explains why plausible straight romances are as rare (and tiny) as gemstones, like Richard Linklater's "Before Sunset." "Something New" looks modest indeed by comparison, but the film is good news nonetheless  —  it's a store-bought valentine with real heart.  "Something New" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film has some discreet lovemaking and one scorching dance number.

Interracial romance has become common enough that the arched eyebrows in recent films like "Guess Who" and now "Something New" belong to African-Americans, while a saintly white guy endures the abuse for his conflicted lover. Wispy at best, this romantic comedy from a first-time director and screenwriter feels as if whole chunks have been left on the cutting-room floor, with what remains mustering intermittent charm thanks to the attractiveness, if not chemistry, of Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker. All told it's more a heart than head movie, which should draw solidly in urban neighborhoods while possessing marginal crossover appeal. 
This isn't to say that the script by Kriss Turner doesn't raise some fundamental issues about affluent black woman having difficulty finding suitable mates, or that the story as presented by musicvideo director Sanaa Hamri lacks moments. It's only that so much of it is obvious and clunky, including protracted and preachy discussions about race, with one particularly unconvincing exchange occurring while the central couple wanders through a supermarket.
At its core is a sitcom setup: Numbers-crunching Kenya (Lathan) is on the partner track at her big, mostly white L.A. accounting firm, leaving scant time for life or romance. On Valentine's Day, then, she's hanging with her three girlfriends -- all of them hyper-successful professionals -- lamenting how 42.4% of black women will never marry. (Just to make the sitcom analogy more pronounced, Golden Brooks of UPN's quartet-comedy "Girlfriends" is part of the foursome.)
Kenya insists she's not picky but merely looking for a brother who's "taller than me, college educated and not crazy." So she's taken aback when her white co-worker fixes her up with Brian (Baker of TV's "The Guardian"), a handsome landscape architect rebounding from a recent breakup.
Resistant at first, Kenya eventually hires Brian to landscape her new house, and one kind of seed planting leads to another. Problem is she's highly self-conscious about the relationship, and when she brings Brian around her black friends most of them act as if she's sprouted a second head.
Such racism surely exists, but most of it here is too blunt and obvious. Along the way, a who's who of African-American TV stars (including Wendy Raquel Robinson as Kenya's friend, "Scrubs'" Donald Faison as her brother and Alfre Woodard as her disapproving mom) have a go at tearing the two apart.
The "boy loses girl" section, in fact, comes when Kenya is introduced to an elusive "IBM" (ideal black male) in the form of a corporate attorney played by Blair Underwood. Of course, he meets all the criteria on her list, forcing Kenya to reexamine what's important, culminating in an ending that's not merely sappy but flat-out silly.
Perhaps the best thing the movie has going for it, actually, is that despite the title, there's really nothing new here at all; rather, the beats are so familiar the audience can fill in the gaps themselves. In that undemanding context, there are modest pleasures to be derived from the budding romance between Lathan's high-strung gal and Baker's earthy dude -- and the discomfort it engenders.
Both leads would fare better, admittedly, if saddled with fewer speeches, but the movie clearly has social matters on its mind beyond the romantic comedy business at hand. Much of that centers on Kenya's unease, which yields a few amusing scenes with her friends as well as one warming encounter with her taciturn dad (Earl Billings).
Lathan plays Kenya well as the ice queen, though she's not given enough of a progression to achieve the melting process. Similarly, Baker lacks dimension other than looking buff while tearing up tree roots and zipping around in a beat-up truck with a Golden Retriever, which is movie shorthand for "nice guy."
Look too closely and there will be questions about abandoned plot threads and excised scenes, among them what the hell "Cheers" alum John Ratzenberger is doing in a silent cameo. Then again, that's why God (through his studio rep) created DVDs and directors' cuts.
Judging "Something New" strictly on what's there, meanwhile, finds an amalgam of recognizable themes draped around two pretty people who meet cute, mate cute, even split cute. For an audience provided sporadic gulps of such fare since "Waiting to Exhale," that'll probably be enough.

Sanaa Hamri's brisk, refreshingly understated romantic comedy Something New  is the rare movie that delivers on its title's promise. By bluntly integrating race and class into its stock love-conquers-all story line, this innovative fairy talewhich neither resorts to overblown palliatives nor shortchanges its genre bona fides effectively diminishes the stink of do-gooder dross like last year's Crash .
Hamri's film shares the same L.A. setting and bourgeois perspective as that self-important mess, but little else. Her African American heroine, Kenya  (Sanaa Lathan ), is a rising star at a high-end accounting firm with little time to devote to finding a husband. Enter Brian (Simon Baker ), a laid-back, New Agey, very available landscape architect (none dare call him yardman) who happens to be white. Kenya's well-heeled parents (Earl Billings  and Alfre Woodard , who gleefully plays against type) and a trio of her gal pals weigh in on the budding relationship, while another potential suitor (Blair Underwood  as an unctuous IBM , or "ideal black man") threatens to undo it.
The plotting may be familiar and mundane, but that's precisely what makes Something New  work: Its thorny, mostly unresolved questions of identity and racial affiliation are couched in identifiable everyday concerns, like dealing with job and family stress and worrying that a suitable mate may never turn up. In the end, the film is a lucid, tender appeal for flexibility, and no amount of carjackings, LAPD shakedowns, or freeway conflagrations can rival the pleasure of seeing such a concept so engagingly explored.
