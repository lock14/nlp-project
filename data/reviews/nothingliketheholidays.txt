"Nothing Like the Holidays" offers proof that canned ham can still taste pretty good. A Latino entry in the weathered home-for-the-holidays genre, the movie leaves no cliché unturned, but the enthusiasm of the players and the genuine fellow feeling that courses through the story fan a few new flames from the smoldering Yule log. Next to a garish plastic Santa like "Four Christmases," this is a handmade ornament - not very elegant but you're glad to hang it on the tree anyway.
Not every Hispanic and Latino actor in Hollywood has been given a part here - it only seems that way. Actually, there's a ringer at the head of the table: the British-born Spanish/Italian actor Alfred Molina as Edy Rodriguez, Chicago bodega owner and paterfamilias to a large, fractious Puerto Rican clan. Arriving home for Christmas are his three children: Iraq war vet Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez), struggling LA actress Roxanna(Vanessa Ferlito), and Wall Street honcho Mauricio (John Leguizamo), 
the latter toting his yuppie bride, Sarah (Debra Messing).
At first, "Nothing Like the Holidays" looks like it's going to set up the Anglo for potshots: Sarah is a tightly coiffed ice cube who barely speaks Spanish and doesn't want kids. Yet director Alfredo de Villa and his writing team (Alison Swan, Rick Najera, Robert Teitel) throw gentle curveballs throughout.
When mom Anna (Elizabeth Pena) announces her intention to divorce the wayward Edy at the dinner table, the family freaks out in unexpected ways. Powerbroker Mauricio falls apart completely while his wife turns out to know more of the family secrets than she's letting on. (You'll guess the big one before anyone in the movie does.)
Meanwhile, Jesse has to come to terms with his Iraq traumas while trying to woo an ex-flame (Melonie Diaz) and Roxanna needs to decide whether the Hollywood C-list means more than local sweetheart Ozzie (Jay Hernandez), himself dealing with a street-revenge subplot. The ribbons are laid out with care and the cast acts like they've never tied them into bows before.
The tartest performances come from the ever-reliable Pena - she invests every bit of business with sublimated fury - and Luis Guzman as a loudmouthed family friend, the jester who gets to say what the others can't. At its most original, "Nothing Like the Holidays" implies there's no greater force for conservatism in a Latino family than the children, desperate to hold together the illusion of clan while the parents deal with unpleasant facts.
The movie's not really interested in originality, though. Instead, it wants to wrap the old seasonal homilies in the warm specifics of time and place and ethnicity. At that, it succeeds. Both despite its familiarity and because of it, "Nothing Like the Holidays" brings it home for Christmas.


There are plenty of movies like Nothing Like the Holidays , a broad, warm, aspirational 'tis-the-season concoction about a raucous family  mom, dad, three grown kids, assorted significant other  reunited at Christmas. But there are relatively few families, at least in mainstream pop culture, who are so piquantly, cross-culturally Puerto Rican-Chicagoan as the Rodriguez clan. This gaggle has strong ties of affection and big, telenovela-worthy issues: The oldest son (John Leguizamo) is a high-powered New Yorker married to a supersonically powered Jewish hedge fund manager (Debra Messing) too busy to consider motherhood; the younger son (Freddy Rodriguez) is just back from a tour of duty in Iraq, with the horror of war still on his face; the daughter (Vanessa Ferlito) is a struggling actress in L.A.; and Papa (Alfred Molina) may be cheating on Mama (Elizabeth Peña).
The troubles are broad, the plot twists giant, and the performances cheery in this carol to ethnic pride in Chicago's traditionally Latino Humboldt Park. And when the neighborhood gets together to march and make music in the annual Christmas celebration known as the parranda , the joy is contagious.

 The gnarly dead tree in front of the Rodriguez house in Humboldt Park, a working-class Latino neighborhood of Chicago, will not be processed into kindling. As the Rodriguez menfolk, gathered for Christmas, attack it with chain saws, their incompetence with power tools makes them look like fools. Even when they try to drag it out of the earth with ropes and chains attached to a car, it refuses to budge.  That old dead tree is an unwieldy metaphor for family solidarity in “Nothing Like the Holidays,” an efficient home-for-Christmas ensemble comedy trimmed with plastic teardrops. But the tree might also stand for a wooden holiday genre in which uplift follows tumult as surely as Christmas morning follows Christmas Eve. The only distinguishing characteristic of this mildly agreeable variation of a worn-out formula is that the boisterous family under examination is Puerto Rican, and the screenplay includes a smattering of Spanish.  In its early scenes the movie, which has as many underdeveloped subplots as characters, threatens to be another melodrama about a returning soldier.  The glum Jesse (Freddy  Rodriguez), home from Iraq, is picked up at the airport by his neighborhood pals; sunglasses cover deep scratches around one eye that suggest he has had a set-to with a riled-up house cat.  But “Nothing Like the Holidays,” directed by Alfredo de Villa (“Washington Heights”) from a screenplay by Alison Swan and Rick Najera, has neither the time nor the inclination to explore Jesse’s malaise in any depth. Although he harbors guilt about the death of a friend in combat, what really bugs him is that Marissa (Melonie Diaz), the girlfriend he dumped, has happily settled down with another man.  No sooner has the Rodriguez clan gathered around the dinner table than the mother, Anna (Elizabeth Peña, who is at least a decade too young for her role), announces she is divorcing Eddy (Alfred Molina), her husband of 36 years, who owns a bodega; he allegedly cheated. The notion that a family-loving matriarch would make such a surprise announcement (even Eddy is ambushed) at a festive holiday reunion is simply bizarre.  Dinner, of course, is ruined. The taciturn Eddy, who urges a reluctant Jesse, the younger of his two sons, to go into the family business, has his own secret torment. (Hint: It’s medical.)  Anna, as written, is a disagreeable piece of work.  She badgers her non-Hispanic daughter-in-law, Sarah (Debra Messing), a yuppie banker, to give her a grandchild and mutters nasty things about her in Spanish, which Sarah can’t understand. The movie appears to take Anna’s side. Sarah is married to Anna’s oldest son, Mauricio (an unconvincing John Leguizamo in expensive eyewear), a successful lawyer.  Also on hand is a daughter, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito), a struggling television actress living in Hollywood who is waiting for a call from her agent about a part. Will Roxanna hook up with her hunky but shady childhood friend Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who carries a gun along with a potentially lethal grudge against a neighbor? Ms. Ferlito and Mr. Hernandez lend the movie a smidgen of heat.  The most engaging moments of “Nothing Like the Holidays” are the festive party sequences in which the characters throw off their troubles to dance in the bodega and pour into the street in their Christmas finery. Their troubles momentarily forgotten, the residents of Humboldt Park really know how to enjoy themselves.  “Nothing Like the Holidays” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a little violence and sexual situations.

After getting past the awful title, which evokes images of madcap Christmas mayhem, "Nothing Like the Holidays" proves a mildly efficient holiday stocking-stuffer, albeit one whose one truly distinctive characteristic is its predominantly Hispanic cast. So "The Family Stone" becomes "The Family Rodriguez," and to their credit, the able performers wring as much mileage as they can from such familiar material. Box office should fare best in urban niches, but pic's real afterlife could be as a de facto pilot for another stab at a Latino-themed TV series.
Producers Robert Teitel and George Tillman Jr. certainly know that route, having taken both "Barbershop" and "Soul Food" from theatrical runs to pay-TV spinoffs. Here, with "Washington Heights" director Alfredo De Villa calling the shots, they've delivered another robust slice of ethnic life -- focusing on a large, boisterous clan within Chicago's Puerto Rican community.
This Christmas reunion, however, brings not only old faces but some pretty tired storylines to the home of Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina), a bodega owner, and his wife, Anna (the wonderful Elizabeth Pena).
Son Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) is home from Iraq, bearing scars both visible and not, while pining for the girl (Melonie Diaz) he left behind. Daughter Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) has become a "star" in Los Angeles, but she's really not, and spends the entire holiday waiting for a call regarding whether she's landed a long-awaited part. (Her agent calls back during the holidays, so there's obviously an element of fantasy here.)
Finally, there's successful attorney Mauricio (John Leguizamo) and his banker wife, Sarah (Debra Messing), who are both so career-driven they've yet to fulfill Anna's yearnings for grandchildren. "She won't cook or eat," the older woman mutters in Spanish about her rich, white daughter-in-law, while family and friends paint him as a sellout and wonder why he and the missus haven't produced a "Sorta Rican."
While there are several amusing lines in Alison Swan and Rick Najera's script, there's nary an unexpected moment. Indeed, the family Christmas devolves predictably into an unintentional version of the "Seinfeld" holiday Festivus, including feats of strength and a conspicuous airing of grievances.
The saving grace comes from the earnestness of the performances -- most notably from Pena, who, despite the sprawling ensemble, uses her limited screen time to render Anna a powerful matriarch invested with an assortment of qualities, from imperious to wounded to fraught with concern about Jesse putting his life at risk.
If only the movie itself took even a marginal risk. As is, it's a thin, almost claustrophobic tale, with the family spending so much time inside the house bantering, arguing and reconnecting that the occasional exterior forays onto the neighborhood's snow-covered, wintry streets prove especially welcome. Paul Oakenfold does aid matters with his widely varied score.
Given that an inferior holiday comedy, "Four Christmases," is presently bringing Warner Bros. Yuletide cheer, perhaps there's heightened appetite right now for cinematic comfort food. Beyond that, "Nothing Like the Holidays" is sorta Rican, sorta OK, and exactly like any number of family tales, just with a different accent.


The Rodriguez kids, spread far from their native Chicago, reunite for Xmas under the roof of their voluminous burgher patriarch (Alfred Molina ). Spruce with superficial ethnic color—as opposed to intimacy with a specific social reality—and you've got yourself a real niche-filler. Recast, with script retouches and plantains traded out for eggplant Parmesan or kielbasa, the movie would "work" just the same. Feasible family resemblance was no concern in negotiating together the supergroup of Puerto Rican (well, mostly Latino) actors. There's John Leguizamo , a yuppie whose defensive prig wife (Debra Messing , recipient of "Oh, white people" eye-rolls) refuses, to his parents' horror, to lie down and multiply like a proper Catholic; Vanessa Ferlito , aspirant actress; and velvet-eyed Freddy Rodríguez , the returning Iraq  vet who, with his welled-up, squelched hurt, seems a refugee from a better movie. Conflict is served up buffet-style, with portions of infidelity, impending divorce, career crisis, fatal illness, survivor guilt, and gangbang blood-fueds, with almost every scene according to a recipe done better elsewhere before. (Even when painstakingly explained, the central plot twist doesn't make sense.) The cast is appealing enough, though, and those looking for seasonal warm fuzzies can find them, as predictably touching as a muddled-through "Auld Lang Syne."
