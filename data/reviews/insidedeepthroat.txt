When it opened in midtown Manhattan during the summer of 1972, "Deep Throat" showed moviegoers things experienced, for the most part, only in their own bedrooms. The movie was a dingy work of porn that told the tale of a sexually underwhelmed woman who's shown by a doctor that the reason she's dissatisfied is because she's been doing it all wrong.
The film and the scandal it caused is the subject of "Inside Deep Throat," the sniggering new documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. "Deep Throat" prompted government hearings, nationwide police crackdowns at adult theaters, scientific studies about the effects of pornography on the adult mind, and hyperventilating non-scientific rebuttals. It created a commercial porn industry and inspired millions of Americans to traipse to their local dirty movie houses (albeit with their hat brims pulled low) to find out what the devil was going on.
The documentary has no great overriding argument it wants to make -- neither about the politicians-turned-censors who thought the world was coming to an end nor about those who saw "Deep Throat" as the apotheosis of American liberty. It's an unfocused overview that intersperses choppy interviews and observations with clips from "Deep Throat," including some of its most notorious and explicit scenes.
"Deep Throat" cost about $25,000 and grossed $600 million, most of which wound up going to the movie's mob backers. Linda Lovelace, the movie's 23-year-old lead actress and stuntwoman (there's no other way to put it), became a star, then a media figure who went on to denounce her participation in the film. Harry Reems, the movie's male lead, was brought up on porn-related obscenity charges but continued a long career as an adult film star. The director, Gerard Damiano, went on to make dozens more pictures, including "The Devil in Miss Jones" and "Joint Venture."
Bailey and Barbato, meanwhile, have made a name for themselves as kitsch-ologists, having made movies about Tammy Faye Baker and murderous nightlifer Michael Alig. They have a habit of over-applying their teasing camp sensibility, making their work look cheap, like a debutante with too much eyeliner. Meanwhile, their production company, World of Wonder, cranks out one glib offering after the next: maybe you've seen "The Reality of Reality" or "The Christmas Special Christmas Special." Their interest in "Deep Throat" is appropriate: They make porn for pop-culture fanatics.
Narrated by Dennis Hopper, "Inside Deep Throat" speaks in the idiom of the VH-1 popumentary. It features a jukebox of evocative hits (the ones here appear to be on loan from the "Boogie Nights" soundtrack); entertaining archival footage (elderly and enthusiastic post-screening "Deep Throat" patrons); and a load of talking heads willing to say anything to avoid the proverbial cutting room floor.
The film tracks down, among many others, Norman Mailer, Susan Brownmiller, Hugh Hefner, Larry Flynt, Camille Paglia, Erica Jong, John Waters, Bill Maher, Alan Dershowitz, and Dr. Ruth. Some have a connection to "Deep Throat" (Dershowitz defended Reems against those obscenity charges); some just want to talk about it. The movie often feels like an episode of VH-1's "Best Week Ever" circa 30 years ago.
The movie tumbles forth in patchily edited sequences that obscure any sort of provocative momentum, and the opening third is awash in '70s Time-Life cant ("As the sexual revolution was taking the country by storm. . ."). Many of the original "Deep Throat" players, who are interviewed, come off as jokey and utterly delighted that someone still wants to put a camera on them. Only when the film's content is deconstructed does a ray of insight appear.
Like the specials Bailey and Barbato produce, the frissons and frills are fun. (Jong, for instance, who's among the least grotesque people in the film, dispels the myth of the vaginal orgasm.) But an attempt to say something about the zeitgeist of an era has to go somewhere, and this film doesn't. "Inside Deep Throat" doesn't want to be arch or insensitive. A lot of its material is played straight, but twitches of tabloid and camp afflict the film's tone like a nasty tic.
For instance, the documentary is neither mature enough to cut an interview with Dick Cavett -- who admits to never having seen "Deep Throat" -- nor patient enough to devote more time to the sad story of Lovelace, who died three years ago at 53. She was used by her director, her abusive boyfriend, and, to an extent, by some feminists who took up her cause. Later in life, with nowhere else to turn for an income, she exploited herself, posing for adult magazines. Bailey and Barbato appear to recognize Lovelace's human tragedy, but like any decent pornographers, they seem to prefer a bared bottom to a bared soul.


         By turns funny and sobering, sweeping and intimate, the consistently entertaining "Inside Deep Throat" plays like a giddy prance through the minefield of the last three decades of American sex and politics. It's a timeless story, really. Bawdy, can-do upstarts raise the vengeful ire of the cynically pious. Swap the X-rated 1972 comedy with a clever 18th century foundling and you'd have "Tom Jones." Minus the happy ending, of course.
 
  "Inside Deep Throat" was produced by Brian Grazer, whose introduction to the once outrageous, now rather quaint blue blockbuster came, fittingly, via his grandmother. It was directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato ("The Eyes of Tammy Faye," "Monica in Black and White"), who have a nose for sniffing out consequence in the outwardly ridiculous. The documentary doesn't plumb the depths of the movie that inspired it (there are none) so much as it explores the uses to which it was put by interests as diverse and contradictory as the Nixon administration, a newly politically active Christian right, the mob, lefty feminist activists and the then-burgeoning porn industry. It examines "Deep Throat's" lasting cultural effect and finds it to be not unlike the fertile crescent of the modern culture wars. Both the current zeal to legislate "moral values" and the cynical modern porn industry can be traced to the same event — the release and unlikely success of what must be the pluckiest and dumbest, in a cute way, porn movie ever made.
 


         






    An essay constructed from interviews, vintage television footage, movie scenes and cultural ephemera, much of the story is told through the oral histories of people who were involved in the making of "Deep Throat," the prosecuting of "Deep Throat" and the talking about "Deep Throat" when it was chic to do so. Prominent cultural figures of the era, including Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, Hugh Hefner, John Waters, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Alan Dershowitz and Erica Jong, reminisce about the days when the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy could be seen queuing up for a screening of "I Am Curious: Yellow." Also, the movie's rather more bewildered director, Gerard "Jerry" Damiano, and his cast and crew (the hilariously debauched production manager, Ron "I approached those films like I was Luc Godard" Wertheim; potty-mouthed location manager, Lenny Camp; and male lead Harry Reems) puzzle over what happened to their lives and careers in the aftermath of the movie's success. Famed fellatist Linda Lovelace appears only in found television footage; talking to reporters after the smash success of the movie, appearing on Phil Donohue alongside new best friend Gloria Steinem.
 
  The notion that modern independent filmmaking was born out of homegrown porn movies like "Deep Throat" and that the genre itself was a training ground for aspiring filmmakers (which, as Damiano points out, was a new word at the time, especially when linked to the word "independent") is also trotted out with some bemusement, as are the then young and naive artists' ideals. In fact, the movie's soundtrack is made up of '70s funk and disco hits that have the effect of both gently mocking their ebullient sexual revolution dreams and taking the air out of blowhards like Charles Keating, an antiporn crusader turned convicted criminal. Not much can be done to make the interviews with the U.S. prosecutor, Larry "I am the Piper" Parrish, funny, unfortunately; or the chilling, ironic familiarity of statements like the one closeted right-wing crusader Roy Cohn hurled at Reems during a TV screamathon: "You talk as though the Bill of Rights was made just for you!"
 
  That, ultimately, it was the stars who suffered in its aftermath (and profited materially not at all) should come as no surprise to devotees of "Behind the Music" and other price-of-fame bio shows. Lovelace, who made about $2,000 for her participation in the film, left an abusive marriage following the release of the movie, remarried, had children, became an antipornography crusader (her testimony for the Meese Commission helped win judges the right to know indecency when they see it, without being held to national standards), attempted a porn comeback in her 50s, struggled to hold down jobs and died following a car crash in 2002. Reems became the first actor ever to be prosecuted by the U.S. government for his connection to the film, hit the skids and found redemption in Jesus Christ and high-end real estate. The now marshmallow-haired, mantis-limbed Damiano, who made the movie with $25,000 in financing secured from organized crime, never saw a dime of the $600 million the film went on to gross.
 
  Bailey and Barbato's sympathies are clearly with them, the naïfs of the story and the big losers in the politically created, media-disseminated morality tale that was "Deep Throat." For all the ribbing they and other subjects receive at the hands of the filmmakers — Damiano is shown sitting on his leopard-print duvet, his fragile back to the mirrored wall; the now septuagenarian "swinger count," Sepy Dobronyi, who lent his mansion as a location, is shown trying out humorous poses while Gary Glitter's "Oh Yeah" blares — "Inside Deep Throat" makes it clear that it considers itself both an important lesson in recent history and a cautionary tale. Lately it seems documentaries have been criticized for interpreting events and for trying to make some logical sense out of the glut of disconnected information we're submerged in every day. To enjoy "Inside Deep Throat" as I did, though, is to be thankful that someone even bothers to try.

In 1972, Americans shocked no one so much as themselves when they lined up at movie theaters across the country to see Deep Throat , a grimy little hardcore porn film that consisted of a pretty, mildly bedraggled brunette named Linda Lovelace (née Boreman) doing things that even most bad girls had never seen. The sociocultural earthquake that was ''porno chic'' would have been astounding even if the movie that set it in motion had been utterly routine. Deep Throat , however, was far from ordinary; it was one of the most idiosyncratic porn films ever made. It had that goony Mickey Mouse theme of a title song, not to mention a so-idiotic-it's-brilliant gimmick  a woman with a clitoris in her throat!  that gave the audience something to chortle over. As Norman Mailer observes in Inside Deep Throat , a sensational (in every sense) documentary about the porn film that changed the world, the effect of Linda Lovelace's outrageous oral acrobatics was to shift the entire culture's erotic spotlight from intercourse to...a different range of activity. Suddenly, a porn film wasn't just showing sex. It was expanding what was allowed, and inviting the audience to follow.
Inside Deep Throat  is nimble, engrossing, and journalistically eye-opening, a movie that pulls into focus 30 years of porn in America. It also pulls no punches: Since the rating is NC-17, we see all the skin that we need to, including several explicit clips of Lovelace's still-startling abilities. The codirectors, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (The Eyes of Tammy Faye ), work in their rigorous yet playful informational style, and the producer, veteran Hollywood player Brian Grazer, has ensured that the filmmakers got all the freedom they needed. Inside Deep Throat  packs in the entire porno-puritan American circus: the lines around the block in the early '70s; the winking wisecracks on late-night TV as Deep Throat entered the national bloodstream; the anxiety that still lingers over the Mob's dominance of the burgeoning triple-X industry of the early '70s; the shutting down of theaters as the nation's prosecutors and censors went to work  helping, of course, to publicize the very phenomenon they wanted to crush.
Just about everyone connected with Deep Throat  comes off as a mere witness to something far larger than themselves. Gerard Damiano, the former Queens hairdresser who directed the film, is now an avuncular Florida geezer in high-waisted pants who barely saw a dime for his efforts. Lovelace, who died in 2002, is seen in a variety of clips, including her '80s testimonials as an anti-porn crusader, and what comes across in every one of them  including those from Deep Throat   is her blurry vulnerability, her eagerness to do what others told her.
Porn docs often play at film festivals and nowhere else, but Inside Deep Throat  could turn out to be a one-shot porno-chic revival. I suspect many viewers, living in a world where virtually nothing happens in pop culture that isn't planned, will want to discover (or relive) the story of one of the flukiest revolutions of the 20th century: how the seamy sex-film underground turned mainstream. The enforcers who went after Deep Throat  come off as the sternest of puritans, but, as Mailer points out, sex is like lava, and maybe porn is too. Once it erupts, you can't stop the flow.

t was the image seen - cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized - around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie "Deep Throat," played the role that would bequeath on her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old  became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from the lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary "Inside Deep Throat," Ms. Boreman  was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel  for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, who produced the film with the Hollywood big shot Brian Grazer ("A Beautiful Mind"), "Inside Deep Throat" is a "slam, bam, thank you, ma'am" trifle of an entertainment. Strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D., with rapid-fire editing, flash graphics and a breathlessly upbeat vibe, the documentary fuses a m�lange of stag-loop snippets, educational-film guffaws and television news reports with a hit parade of talking heads. Among the notables delivering generally less-than-considered opinions are hipster antiques like Norman Mailer, Hugh Hefner, Xaviera Hollander and Dick Cavett, who claims never to have seen "Deep Throat." The most entertaining? The Cosmo senior Helen Gurley Brown, who happily volunteers that ejaculate is good for the complexion. These veterans of the sexual revolution certainly give good talk, but far more entertaining are the men and women who occupied the revolution's front lines, including the director of "Deep Throat," Jerry Gerard, the nom de porn of the hairdresser turned hard-core auteur Gerard Damiano. The man who immortalized Linda Lovelace or at least her singular talent, Mr. Damiano shot "Deep Throat" for around $25,000 (the final cost was $40,000), money furnished by Anthony Peraino Sr. and his son Louis, associates of the Colombo crime family. As The Los Angeles Times reported in a 1982 article, information the documentary conspicuously glosses over, the elder Peraino entered the pornography industry in the late 1960's, becoming a leader in "organized crime's most profitable new business venture." No kidding: "Deep Throat" raked in millions. But that's getting ahead of the story, or at least the high-minded narrative of release  and repression that the filmmakers go to such pains to construct. Superficially framed as a lighthearted, fun-loving pr�cis of this pornographic phenomenon and its fallout, "Inside Deep Throat" is at its core an argument for freedom of expression and a somewhat cautionary tale. For Mr. Bailey and Mr. Barbato, and one imagines for Mr. Grazer as well, it appears that "Deep Throat," and its 62 minutes of parlor tricks, bodily fluids, cartoon performances and ear-achingly bad music, is more than a skirmish in the culture wars that, as the documentary's narrator, Dennis Hopper, gravely intones, "divides us as never before." For them, it represents a historic battle of epic proportions. That seems an awfully heavy burden for this cheap little movie to carry, not that it didn't make a splash. On its release in June 1972, "Deep Throat" produced an instant uproar and an apparently insatiable audience more diversified than pornography's previous dirty-old demographic. In a 1973 article in The New York Times Magazine headlined "Porno Chic," the reporter Ralph Blumenthal described how the patronage of Truman Capote and others helped turn this grind-house quickie into a fad and detailed how the courts were helping turn it into a First Amendment cause. The same summer that "Deep Throat" opened, the movie was found obscene and seized, only to be returned to theaters the next day. The money continued to flow, as did the legal and cultural debates. During one of the obscenity trials involving the movie, Arthur Knight, a film critic for Saturday Review, testified that "Deep Throat" had redeeming social value because, as Mr. Blumenthal wrote in The Times, "it helped people to expand their sexual horizons and particularly emphasized that a woman's sexual gratification was as important as a man's." Notwithstanding, as this detail-oriented reporter noted, of the film's 15 sex acts, exactly 7 involve fellatio and 4 involve cunnilingus. As was the case with many early pornographers, female pleasure was not especially on Mr. Damiano's mind when he trained his camera on Ms. Boreman and her jocular co-star, Harry Reems. As it turns out her welfare wasn't a factor either, as Mr. Damiano acknowledges in a new book on the history of the pornographic film industry, "The Other Hollywood," by Legs McNeil and Jennifer Osborne. The more depressingly sordid details of Linda Boreman's transformation into Linda Lovelace do not register as meaningfully in the documentary as all those high times and all that big money. The filmmakers draw attention to a large bruise splayed across one of her thighs in "Deep Throat," which was probably inflicted by her husband, a gutter Svengali named Chuck Traynor. But there is little in the documentary to make you wince, as is not the case with "The Other Hollywood," which recounts regular beatings of Ms. Boreman by her husband and includes a repulsively ugly account of their life together in pornography. (Both have since died.)  The problem, of course, is, that like pornography's early ties to the mob, which the filmmakers use for some comic relief, Ms. Boreman's life was a serious downer. Poor Linda - what a buzz kill. The same goes for those pesky feminists who eventually declared war on pleasure and helped bring the great porn utopia to an end. Or so Mr. Bailey and Mr. Barbato suggest with some historical reductionism that insults feminists who enjoy pornography, as well as those who work in its industry. Given the current political and cultural climate - just days ago a House panel voted to increase broadcast indecency penalties - there is something to be said for anything that celebrates our right to enjoy really lousy pornography. Too bad that in the process of building their case, the makers of "Inside Deep Throat" didn't work harder to understand why hard-core pornography sent some women into the streets and others behind cameras, or why Anthony Comstock is as much with us today as he was in the late-19th century. "Inside Deep Throat" is rated NC-17 (No one 17 or under admitted). It has hard-core, sexually explicit material, including images of Linda Lovelace in "Deep Throat" performing, as she later put it, "like a sword swallower.
A famous Andy Warhol  movie consists solely of a man's face in close-up as he's fellated by an offscreen partner. The HBO  documentary Inside Deep Throat  doesn't have nearly that much conceptual elegance, but it too focuses on a reactionnamely the convulsions that shook the American body politic in the wake of the porn film Deep Throat . Call this doc, written and directed by Fenton Bailey  and Randy Barbato , "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blowjob." Deep Throat  was a media event, a battle in the culture wars, a show business landmark. Shot in a Miami motel for $22,000, it would eventually gross $600 million. Its originality is not difficult to fathom. Whereas Warhol's Blow Job  was conceptual, Deep Throat  was high-concept: A woman whose clitoris is somewhere near her tonsils seeks sexual gratification through (copious) oral sex.
Deep Throat was created by Gerard Damiano , an erstwhile Queens  beautician, as a vehicle for the so-called Linda Lovelace ; daughter of a New York City cop, she had been pimped by her husband for her extraordinary ability to suppress her gag response. "When I saw what she could do, I said, 'Stop the cameras,' " Damiano tells Bailey and Barbato. The main recipient of her favors, on-screen, was an actor whose nom de porn was Harry Reems  and who, his director recalls, "could get an erection at the sound of the camera."
Opening near Times Square  in June 1972, Deep Throat  was the first hardcore porn film to draw dating couples and groups of women. The times had definitely changed. As film historian Jon Lewis , briefly interviewed, argues in his Hollywood v. Hard Core , Deep Throat  belongs among those independent and foreign films, many rated X, that challenged Hollywood  hegemony in the early '70s. It was a phenomenon that fed on its own notoriety. (See the lengthy dinner table discussion in Philip Roth 's American Pastoral .) By January 1973, Deep Throat  was a Johnny Carson  joke; it had been analyzed in The New York Review of Books   and declared "porno chic" by The New York Times  , which characterized Lovelace as "a vivacious, gifted sexual performer."
Deep Throat  was the perfect commercial expression of the Orgy. Characterized by good-natured humor and (relatively) liberal tolerance of sexual diversityor at least do-your-thing-ismit made light of the porn pandemic that, then as now, preoccupied much of the nation. But driven by the spectacle of a supposedly free and unfettered female desire, the movie was less bawdy joke than remarkable displacement. Deep Throat  evoked, yet concealed, the source of female satisfaction; it privileged that satisfaction in the service of a phallocratic regime. No wonder even libertarian feminists were appalled.
Newly re-elected, Richard Nixon  declared war on porn. What goes around comes around: The source who helped Woodward and Bernstein nail the president to his Watergate cross was named for that movie. (But he who laughs last: Was it not the dinner-table-discussable Deep Throat  that ultimately enabled Bill Clinton 's impeachment?) Deep Throat  was investigated by the FBI  and banned in 23 states. In New York City, the case was heard by a judge who, Bailey and Barbato point out, was dumbfounded by the concept of clitoral orgasm.
Damiano, who was cut out of Deep Throat 's profits by his mob partners, was left dreaming of a Hollywood-porn merger that never happened. Still, Lovelace had her 15 minutes of fame as a magazine cover girl and the star of more softcore movies, including Linda Lovelace for President . Later she would join the anti-porn feminists and maintain that she'd been hypnotized by her husband. In a Kafkaesque turn of events, Reems was the fall guyfacing prison, he became a Hollywood cause célèbre. Inside Deep Throat  includes footage of him partying with Jack and Warren and debating Roy Cohn  on TV.
Recent porno-dramasBoogie Nights , Auto Focus , Wonderland have followed the same formula: The Orgy was great, then it all went bad. The People vs. Larry Flynt   put a bizarre Frank Capra  spin on this saga, but Inside Deep Throat  is, by comparison, more a Preston Sturges  movie. The principals are wildly photogenic archetypesDamiano the amiable satyr, Linda the frizzy-haired hippie goddess, Harry the unlucky Lucky Pierre . Beneath these cartoon floats marches a parade of greedy goodfellas, scheming exhibitors, idiot politicians, swanning celebs, and frothing religious fundamentalists.
Filled as it is with punchy montage sequences, Inside Deep Throat  might have been edited by Damiano. It might also have been twice as long. And who wrote the script? Look inside Deep Throat  and you'll find "The Star-Spangled Banner" and Sugar Frosted Flakes , Disneyland  and the Dallas Cowboys . It's the Real Thing, it's Elvis , it's us.
