First-time writer/director Bertino scares up a solid genre success with this debut outing. The Strangers
 covers familiar horror turf with its story about an inexplicable home invasion in the middle of the night, in which masked human ghoulies torment the baffled young lovers who reside within. There�s little that distinguishes this movie�s basic plot from scores of other fright films over the decades, but The Strangers
 is more effective than most because of Bertino�s deft manipulation of the storyteller�s tools. University of Texas filmmaking alum Bertino creates a palpable sense of fear through the shrewd use of sound, imagery, and performance � often using the bare essence or absence of these rudiments to scare up some truly visceral viewer responses. The Strangers
' images are bereft of the virtuoso visuals, bloody effects shots, and pure "torture porn" of the Saw
 franchise, and the crux of the film has none of the moral engineering of Michael Haneke's Funny Games
 movies. Instead, Bertino creates untold frights with things like the offscreen sounds of running, clanking, dragging, and slammed doors � sounds detached from their source. A smoke alarm going off or a phonograph starting up in another room is enough to alert the protagonists that they are not alone. Kristen McKay (Tyler) and James Hoyt (Speedman) are a young couple spending the night in Hoyt's vacation home in a remote country area. The drama builds slowly as the two arrive rather wordlessly, conveying relationship trouble that does not jibe at all with the romantically rose-petal-strewn and candlelit house. A sudden, middle-of-the-night knock on the door is weird but not upsetting. But soon, as the interruptions continue, the masked tormentors begin to make their presence felt. The utter creepiness of two people in China-doll masks and another with a gunny sack over his head cannot be underestimated. Add in kitchen knives, rifles, and other objects of mayhem and the horror turns full-blown in the blink of an eye. Tyler (who turns out to be a darn good scream queen) is not a buff mama like Jodie Foster in Panic Room
 or an effete dowager like Olivia de Havilland in Lady in a Cage
. Her Kristen is simply a beautiful young woman who tries to cope with and make sense of this random occurrence. "Why are they doing this?" she frequently wails. "Because you were home," comes the eventual answer. Younger viewers who've cut their teeth on the instant horrors of modern "torture porn" may find The Strangers
' pace and psychological upsets more slow going than they might like. Yet a film like this may be just the bracing corrective the modern horror film needs. (For more on the film and an interview with Bertino, see "Guess Who's Coming to Terrorize Your Night

"The Strangers" is a horror film with a moral. No matter how nasty a gang of murderers is, the moviemaker calling the shots is ultimately worse. Bryan Bertino, in his directing debut, set out to make one of those home-invasion chillers whose terrors never let up. But he just seems interested in outdoing the grisliness of his peers. "The Strangers" is not more violent than the average horror movie. But it has a realist style meant to call attention to its maker. Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under our skin with a pile driver.
Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman play James and Kristen, a couple tormented by three masked killers - a young man and two young women - in the dead of night, in the middle of nowhere. Before introducing the tormentors, the movie tries to make us care about the couple. Bertino demonstrates that he knows how to use flashbacks: James asked Kristen to marry him. She said no. The mood for love obliterated, they arrive at the house he borrowed and decorated with rose petals in celebration of their engagement. Oops. Now we're trapped in an extra-mopey episode of "Grey's Anatomy." Neither Tyler nor Speedman seems to mind being turned into a gorgeous knife block.
The house looks like a set from 1972. It even has a child's record player that magically includes an LP by the woodland fairy Joanna Newsom. Eventually, there's a knock at the big wood door. The voice on the other side asks, "Is Tamra home?" And the fun is supposed to begin. The killers do things like fire shotguns, heave axes, write on windows, and destroy cellphone chargers. But the frights in the movie are more for us than the characters. Our assailants loom blurry in the background and do such things as watch Kristen make her way from one shot to another. Then they disappear without a sound or a trace. They're bogeymen, whose faces Bertino never shows us. It's "In Cold Blood" for dummies.
Earlier this year, the Austrian director Michael Haneke released a remake of his own home-invasion nightmare, "Funny Games." The movie was charged with intellectual fraudulence: It rubbed our noses in the very violence it purported to critique. But Haneke meant to distance us from the horrors so that we could see them clearly. The movie respected its (puny) audience.
"The Strangers" is too pornographically self-impressed to care what you think. And it's too ignorant of the mechanics of suspense to really freak you out. The histrionic sound design, with its bangs and crackles and slams, works harder than everybody else. The scariest thing in the movie itself, aside from how contemptuously made it happens to be, is the narration. It comes on in the opening minutes and alleges that what we're about to see is based on a true story. But what actually happened - whatever it was - couldn't have been this banal.


Crashing at a suburban ranch house, a couple (Liv Tyler   and Scott Speedman  ) is menaced by a trio of masked psychos. It sounds stupid enough, and ultimately is, but the director, Bryan Bertino, stages The Strangers ' early scenes with spooky panache. The first killer, in his burlap disguise, creeps into the painterly, low-lit frame with ghostly quiet; for a while, the fear is vivid in a J-horror knockoff way. But then comes the blood, the shrieking midnight chase scenes, the anything-goes over-the-top-ness. In other words, everything that we liked the movie for  not being.

 From Sam Peckinpah’s “Straw Dogs” to Michael Haneke’s “Funny Games,” the home-invasion thriller has proved adept at eliciting the fear and dislocation that accompany the violation of our most sacred space.  “The Strangers” is no exception, raising the stakes with a bloody preview of the  ending before flashing back to the horrors that precede it. But this is no splatter movie: spare, suspenseful and brilliantly invested in silence, Bryan Bertino’s debut feature unfolds in a slow crescendo of intimidation as a young couple (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, both terrific) arrive at a country getaway after a friend’s wedding.  While navigating a tense crossroads in their relationship, the pair are interrupted by a sinister threesome whose identities and motivations are concealed. Alternately innocent and threatening, the intruders bang on the door and manifest as masked, blurred shapes behind the unwitting lovers. But even as the campaign of terror escalates, the movie remains levelheaded, smartly maintaining its commitment to tingling creepiness over bludgeoning horror.  Claiming inspiration from true events, “The Strangers” builds tension with tiny details — a moved cellphone, a looping song on the record player — and empathy with victims whose intimacy is affectingly real. Like Nimród Antal’s recent “Vacancy,” this highly effective chiller suggests that a relationship in extremis is the most honest of all.  “The Strangers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Coitus is interruptus and killing is not.

A young couple at a remote house get some very-latenight, highly unwelcome visitors in debuting writer-director Bryan Bertino's effectively stripped-down thriller "The Strangers." Offering home invasion horror on a less intellectualized plane than the recent "Funny Games U.S.," "Strangers" should court correspondingly more robust patronage from mainstream fright fans -- even if this exercise, too, might leave some viewers wondering what the point is at the punishing journey's end. 
In an opening that appears to reprise, with seriousness, '70s genre cliches parodied in "Grindhouse's" mock horror trailers, a male voice grimly reads onscreen titles informing us that the events we're about to see actually took place at 1801 Clark Road on Feb. 11, 2005. (This is a ruse, as Bertino has said the story isn't based on any particular case.) We then see two boys on bicycles bearing Christian literature cautiously step into a home whose destroyed front door is just the first sign of violence.
On the soundtrack, a woman's hysterical call to 911 is heard.
Rewind to the night before, as Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) silently drive back from a wedding reception, she in tears. Reaching his family's old vacation home -- strewn with candles and rose petals in anticipation of a now-unlikely romantic finale to the evening -- it gradually becomes clear he proposed, and her answer was not the one expected. Nonetheless, they're about to embark on some make-up sex when there's a knock at the door, which is odd, since it's 4 a.m.
Porch light out, they dimly spy a blond girl outside, asking "Is Tamara here?" She's assured she has the wrong house. Later, needing a drive to settle his nerves, James goes to get Kristen some cigarettes, leaving her alone in the isolated house surrounded by woods.
She isn't alone for long, though.
Separation of leads, personal injuries, a friend's untimely arrival and other invariably dire turns of fate keep the action, which more or less plays out in real time, taut. Bertino, lenser Peter Sova and editor Kevin Greutert make things queasily simple: There's a distinct absence of the usual shock cuts, false scares, or even gore f/x, though things get bloody enough.
The disturbingly unemotional antagonists played by Gemma Ward, Kip Weeks and Laura Margolis are just fleetingly glimpsed until quite late.
Quiet is used to unsettling effect, with tomandandy's near-musique concrete score as well as what's supposed to be old vinyl folk/country records (but are in fact mostly new alt-country tracks by the likes of Gillian Welch and Wilco) sparsely deployed.
It's all efficiently nerve-jangling, with Tyler and Speedman credibly registering every hue of panic. Still, after such a long, creepy, cannily restrained buildup (in order to look more action-packed, the pic's promos cannibalize bits from right up toward the end), it must be said the resolution is rather flat, a full-circle postscript rote. Instead of the chill atmosphere following one out of the theater, these last moments instill a more "Yeah, whatever" aftertaste.
Shot in South Carolina, the production's tech and design elements are all on the money.


Suggesting an American remake of David Moreau  and Xavier Palud 's Them, The Strangers  is practically an abstraction: an old-school spooker spun from the blood splatter on a wall, a nearby record player scratching an oldie, a CB radio in the garage, a creaky swing set in the backyard. First-time helmer Bryan Bertino  is beholden to genre quota, skidding the relationship of pretty young couple Kristen and James (played by Liv Tyler  and Scott Speedman ) before subjecting them to an after-dark home invasion. But he offers no profound rationale for why she refuses his marriage proposal; like the shadowy stranger that comes knocking at their door (eerily asking, "Is Tamara home?"), it's something that just happens . What's up with the bemasked ghoulies of the film's title? Why all the door-slamming? Who's Tamara!?! Plying an old-school artistry that begins with a creepy montage of bumblefuck houses and holds up almost without fail until the strangers offer a creepy non-justification for their transgressions, analog-man Bertino teases with the unknown until he's left no pimple ungoosed. Sometimes avoiding the synapse-raping bad habits of splat packers Eli Roth  and Alexandre Aja  is its own reward; doing so without also submitting to Michael Haneke –style hand-slapping is nearly monumental.
