A top-notch cast was gathered and then wasted in this atmospheric but prosaic hoodoo spooker. Although it's nice to see Hudson break from the string of wan romantic comedies she's starred in since earning her Oscar nomination for Almost Famous
, she achieves no career breakthrough here as the plucky heroine Caroline, a hospice worker who takes a live-in job in a haunted old plantation home in the Louisiana bayou. She's hired by the Devereaux family attorney Luke (Sarsgaard, in his first screen role where he makes little impression) to attend to elderly Ben (Hurt), who's been hobbled by a stroke. But she also has to deal with Ben's dotty spouse Violet (Rowlands), who appears to be harboring secrets. The durable Rowlands never quite becomes fully believable as a Southern hoodoo practitioner, and it's actually rather sad to see this veteran perhaps heading down the elderly Bette Davis scream-queen path. And casting the multidimensional Hurt as a semicatatonic begs us to call into question the basic acumen of the filmmakers. As scripted by Ehren Kruger (Arlington Road
, Scream 3
, the American Ring
 remakes, and the upcoming John Carter of Mars
 and The Brothers Grimm
), The Skeleton Key
 presents  a mishmash of tired horror clich�s that steadily accumulate while forestalling the film's final twist. Like good horror heroines, Caroline of course goes into the attic where she hears strange noises and plunges ahead with her own investigation instead of going to the police when Ben writes "Help me" on his bedsheets and then climbs out on the roof in the rain and falls. And, yes, it's always raining. As for how the invalid Ben gets from his bed to the roof, the answer is hoodoo (narrative pains are taken to differentiate hoodoo, an American folk magic, from voodoo, a religious tradition). Director Softley (Backbeat
, Hackers
, The Wings of the Dove
, and K-PAX
) again shows his gifts for creating atmospheric milieus that emphasize the visual over the literal. His Louisiana feels humid and ancient. Yet the movie, overall, lacks tension and suspense, and some of its key emotional moments were found by the audience to be laugh-out-loud risible. To paraphrase the popular song, "Hoodoo?! Who do you think you're fooling?"


The credits for the new Kate Hudson voodoo thriller, ''The Skeleton Key," say the screenplay is by the horrorsmith Ehren Kruger and the direction courtesy of the art-film practitioner Iain Softley. But all signs suggest that the film's true maker was a particularly spiteful Ouija board. This nasty little movie is communicating with regional and racial cliches from beyond the grave. Yet, come the final act, it manages to be insulting and, somehow, playfully absurd at the same time.
Hudson plays Caroline, a New Orleans nurse who takes a job caring for a pair of seniors in their ancient manse out in the swampy bayou. The proprietress is a bitter old lemon named Violet Devereux, whom Gena Rowlands plays in a cantankerous state that feels like a sequel to the retirement-home wilding out she did in ''The Notebook." Caroline's responsibilities require her to bathe and clothe the droopy soul often slumped over in a wheelchair. The man's name is Ben. He's Violet's husband, and the esteemed English actor John Hurt inhabits the character's drooling catatonia with troubling professionalism.
Caroline tells her understandably skeptical gal pal (Joy Bryant) that she has accepted the job because it'll earn her money and credits for nursing school. But really, the job is good practice for her detective skills, for Caroline does a lot of snooping and spying. She finds the locked door in Violet's attic that the titular key opens. On the other side is a room full of antiques Violet has banned from the rest of the house. (Something in that room gave Ben his crippling fright.) But, crucially, Caroline learns that people in the swamps of Louisiana practice a little something called voodoo.
Caroline is a white girl from Hoboken, so you'll have to forgive her for not knowing that if you pull into a filling station where there are shucked oysters teeming with flies and alligator heads hanging from the ceiling, you peel off. There's voodoo in the offing. Instead, she waits for a pair of scary-looking black people to materialize from a back room to let her know that something ain't right.
To explain what is ultimately inexplicable, ''The Skeleton Key" trots out the back story of two black servants from many decades ago who caused an uproar with their witchy ways. At a big mansion soiree, the butler, Papa Justify (Ronald McCall), and the maid, Mama Cecile (Jeryl Prescott Sales), are caught ''conjuring" on their masters' cute blond tykes, who appear to be having a ball sitting amid certifiable evil. (Alas, black magic.)
The appalled white party guests promptly lynch and then burn the help, and the news is presented to us in a scratchy, black-and-white flashback that looks like a D.W. Griffith music video, complete with Justify and Cecile's beckoning to the camera, their eyes rolling back in their skulls, and their bodies shivering with erotic possession. In the present, no time is wasted (even if quite a bit of money and talent were) to show us a lot of chicken bones, brick powder, and sweaty, suspicious black people, all of which has some lurid bearing on Caroline and her new job.
What specifically, I'm not at liberty to say. But the movie contains what feels like a bad satirical joke on Hollywood's timeless casting philosophy when it comes to race. The gag shows up in the last 10 minutes and is stuffed in a plot twist that pops out like an airbag after a car crash. The filmmakers shove their way right past the flagrance of the racial images, as if they'd lost their power to hurt or annoy. (They haven't.) Yet the movie might have justified some of its offenses had the star been Bryant, an alluring, young African-American actress who isn't hired enough. Come the last 10 minutes, it also would have made more narrative sense.
In any case, the movie just has fun reducing loaded racial imagery to commercial silliness. Caroline winds up squaring off against Violet, and the estimable Peter Sarsgaard is dragged into the mounting hilarity as Violet's attorney. (Until the finale, Hudson's participation remains uncharacteristically zestless.)
None of ''The Skeleton Key" is scary or necessarily suspenseful. But Softley, who pulled off an improbably inspired adaptation of Henry James's ''The Wings of the Dove" in 1998, appears to be enjoying himself with this slummy little movie. It has the wild, rancid atmosphere of a garbage bag that a raccoon has ripped open.
The filmmakers find their footing the last 20 minutes. Its trashy ominousness is best captured when Rowlands comically tells a wary Hudson, ''You haven't touched your gumbo." That she hasn't amounts to the only twitch of common sense in the whole film.

         With her light yellow hair, clear eyes and purposeful stride, Kate Hudson cuts through the boggy gloom of "The Skeleton Key" like a beam of reason. But even she is no match for the lugubrious vegetation of the Louisiana bayou outside New Orleans, which fairly quivers with dread and swampy portent. Mind you, there's also the hoodoo, which is described as a sort of DIY voodoo and is clearly something no rationalist Yankee will be able to resist. Toss in a remote, crumbling antebellum mansion full of religious iconography, a creepy attic, a permanently locked door and an all-access skeleton key and, well, I don't have to tell you
.
 
  Caroline Ellis (Hudson) is a dedicated hospice worker saving up for nursing school when she answers an ad to care for stroke victim Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) at his home on the bayou. Ben's wife, a prickly clever-goose named Violet (Gena Rowlands, in a delightfully goofy nefarious turn), tries her best to make Caroline not at home, but Luke Marshall (Peter Sarsgaard), the molasses-voiced lahw
-yuh to the Devereaux estate, talks her into the gig. Caroline moves into the house, which is garlanded in Spanish moss and slick with moisture, against the sound advice of her best friend and soon finds herself creeping tremulously along the edges of classic gothic horror, often in her underwear, late at night. Not that she doesn't look fabulous doing it.
 


         






    Director Iain Softley ("The Wings of the Dove," "K-Pax") and screenwriter Ehren Kruger (who wrote "The Ring" and the unfortunate "The Ring Two," based on a pair of Japanese films) have fashioned a tremulously lush occult mousetrap for Caroline, unabashedly milking every convention of the genre to deliciously melodramatic effect. Caroline, who is not the first nurse to visit the Devereaux house, soon surmises that Ben's condition may be other than what it seems — it may have to do with something he saw in the attic and what exactly he believes that to be. Once she learns the history of the house, which involves a vicious banker and a pair of conjuring servants (whose story is told in artful flashback that mixes sped-up and slowed-down footage to dreamlike effect), Caroline sets out to trick Ben into believing himself cured — a ritual that involves a candle in a bowl of water, some herbs and a spell jotted down for her like a gumbo recipe by a sorceress in back of a laundromat. Next thing you know, she's getting into some hoodoo of her own, sprinkling protective red brick dust around her like a bayou Gretel.
 
  Hudson holds her own among impressive company. Not that Hurt has a whole lot to do other than grab an occasional wrist and recoil at his face in the mirror, and the usually measured Sarsgaard oversells it a bit, but Rowlands takes to the part like a fly to a shucked oyster. The story turns on its own logic, so it's no use asking why Caroline doesn't split on sight. (The annoying, familiar back story about her father dying alone doesn't cut it, either.) But "The Skeleton Key" is tightly plotted and suspenseful enough to keep you guessing until the satisfying, unexpected end, which is worth suspending disbelief for. After all, as they point out in the movie, "It doesn't work if you don't believe it."

Zombies are, if anything, overrepresented in today's movie marketplace. Yet the spiritual tradition that invented them  Afro-Caribbean voodoo  rarely gets the spotlight, serving mostly as a genre backdrop for all-too-familiar stories about good-looking white people in over their heads (e.g., Angel Heart ). Naive hospice caretaker Caroline (Kate Hudson) certainly falls into that category, but The Skeleton Key , a basic bayou thriller distinguished by a very self-conscious subversive streak, rises nicely above C-level.
''Hoodoo,'' we're informed, is different than voodoo. (It's à la carte folk-magic, whereas voodoo is a bona fide religion.) All of this is news to Caroline, a caretaker who's taking a crash course in ''conjuration'' because she believes it's connected to the catatonia of her latest sickly charge, Ben (John Hurt). Blocking her path is Ben's wife, a honey-tongued battle-ax named Violet (Gena Rowlands, having a blast), who complains, rightly, that this Yankee interloper doesn't ''understand the house.''  Because the house, of course, has a past. That's clear from one look at its rotting plantation colonnades. It comes as no surprise to learn it might be haunted. Ditto the revelation that, once upon a benighted time, a pair of black servants were terminated, shall we say, with prejudice. But what comes next, depending on your point of view, is either a canny manipulation of racist movie tropes or an exercise in facile genre-flick reductivism. The distinction may not matter: For anyone zombified by creaky thriller clichés, Skeleton  is a fine little shot in the head.

 One of the all-too-uncommon joys of summer is the movie that is so flat-out ridiculous that you can't help  enjoying it. Summer has long been the season for disposable entertainments, the time when air-conditioned comfort means more than what flickers onscreen. The recent drift toward seriousness, though, may have complicated matters somewhat, since big, smart movies like "Batman Begins" and big, sober movies like "War of the Worlds" may be making it tough for scraps of fluff like "The Island" to find their audience.  Still, if the box-office woes of "The Island"  suggested that popcorn movies had gone totally gourmet, "The Skeleton Key" offers sound proof that summer remains as down-market and nutrition-free as ever. One of the most enjoyably inane movies of the season, this faux Southern Gothic offers an embarrassment of geek pleasures: Kate Hudson running around in a T-shirt and underwear, a scenery-chewing villain, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South. All this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too, a divine troika who look perfectly content to be neck-deep in so much Spanish moss and hooey.  Ms. Hudson is the star of this show and as a New Orleans hospice worker named Caroline she fits the plucky-heroine-in-panties role with determination, or perhaps just resignation. Scarred by her father's death, which she missed because she was on the road with a band (an odd plot point, given that Ms. Hudson played a rock groupie in her best movie to date, "Almost Famous"), Caroline wants to find a more meaningful job, one in which she will make a difference. To this end she hires on as a private nurse, a well-paying gig that ushers her into the strange company of Violet Devereaux (Ms. Rowlands) and her husband, Ben (Mr. Hurt), who is apparently on the fast track to the sweet hereafter after a debilitating stroke.  Caroline's new job also puts her smack dab in the middle of the bayou, a location that inspires the director, Iain Softley, and the screenwriter, Ehren Kruger, to indulge in almost every conceivable regional and genre cliché. In addition to the aforementioned Spanish moss, the touristic tableaus of the Big Easy, the blues and requisite beads of sweat, the filmmakers also trot out an old blind lady with a milky stare, a handsome stranger (Isaach de  Bankolé in a sliver of a part) who, rather bewilderingly, asks Caroline if she speaks French, and the usual frightful accouterments. Pickled body parts? Check. Faded photographs of unhappy people in period dress? Check. A stuffed dummy in a blond wig? Check. A magical circle in chalk and blood? You bet.  It takes Mr. Softley a while to get the film in gear, which is understandable since it doesn't make much sense. Apparently, the Devereaux mansion was once home to some bad people and may now be haunted or just in need of structural repair.  It would spoil the film's meager pleasures to say more, though it must be said that the film contains a jarring scene of a double lynching. Like some directors who only dip into horror (until they can get back to making serious movies), Mr. Softley oversells his scenes with fussy visuals, as if such filigree could obscure what lies beneath. The lynching occurs in a flashback that oscillates between color and black and white and contains more tilted camera angles than the entirety of "Titanic." It's all very arty, as if lynching were just an empty shock tactic.  That scene tears a hole in the story that might be difficult to repair if "The Skeleton" were not such a throwaway. Happily, thanks to the game supporting cast and a plot that grows progressively more harebrained, the film soon returns to its business of making you jump in your seat while you laugh at your own gullibility. Given Ms. Rowland's part in goosing those jumps, a note to her management team seems in order: Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper, among many other purveyors of modern dread, would probably be happy to know that Bette Davis, the great scream-queen from horror classics like "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?," finally has a credible successor. All Ms. Rowlands needs now is a picture worthy of her splendid menace.  "The Skeleton Key" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It features a disturbing double lynching and the usual haunted-house boos.

Stirring up a humid Gothic mood and amassing a gifted roster of actors, "The Skeleton Key" is unable to ward off the nasty spirits of formula screenwriting. Recipe mixes equal parts Deep Southern hoodooand Stephen King lite in one messy gumbo pot, while undermining scientific reason for a few scares. Fright show tilts more toward psychological terror than the paranormal themes of most of the recent horror wave, but B.O. results will be similarly scary, with a good opening frame followed by a precipitous drop-off to a vid landing. 
Like most of director Iain Softley's work ("K-PAX," "Wings of the Dove"), his latest film, centering on the clash between a hospice nurse and a dogged old lady in a possibly haunted New Orleans plantation home, looks fabulous and feels empty at the core. Much of the hollowness derives from a script by Ehren Kruger (author of "Arlington Road," the pair of Yank remakes of "The Ring" and the upcoming "The Brothers Grimm") so slavish to standard storytelling devices and plot points that it plays more like a Robert McKee class assignment than an organic, authentically told yarn.
Fed up with the hospital practice of treating deceased patients like cargo, 25-year-old nurse Caroline (Kate Hudson) answers an ad for a hospice nurse at a mansion in the furthest depths of the bayou. There, she finds aged homeowner Violet (Gena Rowlands) taking care of her stroke-victim husband Ben (John Hurt). Violet is instantly doubtful of Jersey-born Caroline, whom she says "wouldn't understand the house." The family's sneaky-looking estate lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard), urges Caroline to stay, despite past nurses having quit or been fired. 
Caroline finds herself in a community infused with believers of the American folk magic tradition known as hoodoo (not to be confused, Caroline's helpful friend Jill (Joy Bryant) reminds, with voodoo).
Violet gives Caroline an old-fashioned skeleton key that can open every door in the 30-room house, and Caroline finds an attic stuffed with hoodoo paraphernalia, including old recordings of a fellow named Papa Justify casting a "sacrifice" spell. One of several clumsy expository asides -- this one from Violet -- informs Caroline about the house's history of murder, suicide and the lynching of house servant Justify, caught teaching hoodoo secrets to the owner's children. 
Ben aptly observes -- long after it's clear to auds -- that Caroline behaves more like a detective than a nurse, and her visits to him mostly involve calming him down. Still, despite his supposed stroke, Ben manages to crawl out of his bedroom window and fall off the roof.
Reading Ben's behavior and various clues as signs he's actually under a vicious spell cast by Violet, Caroline bones up on hoodoo. Yet there's a paradox the movie can never quite square: The folk magic works only if one believes in its power, but as a medical worker, Caroline trusts in scientific reason. Still, she reckons, if Ben believes in the hoodoo hooey, then anything that can break Violet's spell may work.
Pic grows exhausted even while developing a more jittery tone (stoked by composer Edward Shearmur's shock music) as Caroline meets Violet in a ludicrous pitched battle during a torrential nighttime rainstorm. After being drugged, pushed over a railing and down a long flight of stairs, the old gal is up for one more fight -- leading the viewer to the conclusion that hoodoo potions must also include a dash of Wheaties.
At the heart of "The Skeleton Key" is a disbelief, not in magic, but in the power of movies to set mood. Pic's dependency on a hamfisted plot handicapped by too much exposition and obvious character types works against the ominous atmospherics Softley, cinematographer Dan Mindel (working in crystalline widescreen) and production designer John Beard conjure up in infinitely more convincing and visceral ways.
Even the guilty pleasure of watching world-class actors slum it up in a summer entertainment grows thin after a while, starting with Rowlands, who not only never seems thoroughly convincing as a decaying Louisiana matriarch but is forced into some literally embarrassing positions. Working up some real tension and sweaty stress, Hudson takes a welcome break from her usually sunny persona, while more and more resembling mother Goldie Hawn as she matures. Hurt almost too intensely delivers the equivalent of a silent film perf, while Sarsgaard is allowed to telegraph his character's real intentions much too soon.

The haunted-house frightener has traditionally depended on the impaired IQ of both its characters and viewers, and The Skeleton Key 's Caroline (Kate Hudson ) has the emptiest head in town. A New Orleans hospice orderly hired by a courtly estate lawyer (Peter Sarsgaard ) to care for a mute, paralyzed "stroke victim" (John Hurt ), Caroline never thinks to call in a doctor or a cop when the poor guy grips her wrist in a vise-like fist, scrawls "Help me" on his bedsheets, or escapes onto the rain-pelted roof of his manor-by-the-swamp. Tantalized by stories of century-old hoodoo intrigue spun by the patient's dotty wife (Gena Rowlands ), Caroline investigates every creak, groan, and bump in the house, forever asking, "Is anyone there?" and discovering all manner of skulls, covered mirrors, and jars of pickled animals, each of which gets its own portentous orchestral thump and crackle of lightning. Creaky in its mechanics and numbingly protracted, this is basement B horror that fancies itself a prestige chiller. As she self-tutors in folk magic and writhes alluringly in her skivvies during her many nightmares, Caroline freely submits to the choke hold of superstition, when all she ever had to do was find another job.
