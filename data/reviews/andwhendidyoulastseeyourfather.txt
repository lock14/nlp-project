The great British actor Jim Broadbent "  has always had a rude, spiky force that seems to emanate from his slightly odd-duck features  the ski-slope nose and zonked leer of a grin, the eyes that bulge with gleeful impropriety, as if to let you know how much of the world he can take in with them. It was a shrewd stroke to cast an unruly presence like Broadbent in When Did You Last See Your Father? , the wee and intimate tale of a son who must come to grips with the death of his difficult, domineering, lust-for-life dad.
Based on Blake Morrison's 1993 novel, the movie shows us Arthur Morrison (Broadbent) at several key ages. At the end of his life, he's lying in bed at home, dying of cancer, attended to by his wife (Juliet Stevenson) and his dutiful but distant and morose son, Blake (Colin Firth  ). From here, the movie keeps flashing back to decades earlier, when Blake was a sensitive 14-year-old boy (Matthew Beard) who saw his father as a selfish cad and came to hate him for it. (There are also scenes with Blake at 8, played by Bradley Johnson.) We can see what a blustery old goat Arthur was, always wanting others to share in his fun. The boy, in response, cultivates his own gentleness  a fine thing, except that it's also his way of rationalizing his fear of girls, pretending that his anxiety puts him on a higher moral plane.
When Did You Last See Your Father?  is a wistful miniature of a movie, yet it creates a provocative balance in the viewer. The director, Anand Tucker (Shopgirl  ), lines up the audience to be on Blake's side. In every frame, though, Broadbent captures how Arthur, this monumentally imperfect man, exudes love in his very flaws. Firth's Blake, coming to terms with that ambivalence as he holds Arthur's ravaged body in his arms, is perhaps a little too closed off in a rote stiff-upper-lip way. Yet by the end, we see what he's holding back. When Did You Last See Your Father?  taps into the conflicting feelings so many of us can have about parents who haunt us because they're difficult, which is part of what makes them irreplaceable.

 A gentle tale gently told, “When Did You Last See Your Father?” is grown-up, civilized fare. If that sounds like a compliment, it is, even though the whole thing might have been improved with a bit of messiness, a little vulgarity to leaven its tastefulness and tact. This isn’t a groundbreaking work; just a smartly played story, enlivened by drama and spiked with passion,  the very thing that thinking audiences pine for, especially during the summer spectacle season when theaters are clogged with sticky kids’ stuff and television reruns.  Colin Firth, one of the few screen actors who make male decency seem sexy, plays Blake, a successful poet and resentful son. The story, adapted from the British author Blake Morrison’s nonfiction best seller of (almost) the same title, takes the measure of that resentment, which gurgles to the surface when the son learns that his father is dying. Working from David Nicholls’s  screenplay, the director Anand Tucker (who made the wonderful “Hilary and Jackie”) approaches the material from the inside out. He  takes us deep inside Blake’s thinking — both in the present and in childhood flashbacks — to show how this sympathetic, otherwise temperate man developed such prickly, seemingly petty feelings toward his father, Arthur, who seems perfectly harmless if for no other reason than he’s played by Jim Broadbent.  Though often called upon to play blustery charmers (you can imagine him sleeping in tweeds and searching for the bowler already parked on his head), Mr. Broadbent is a sly puss, a nimble  stealer of scenes. He has a great, jowly face for comedy, as his estimable work with Mike Leigh and other directors attests, but there is something about his shrewd eyes that suggests a darting, penetrating intelligence. He uses that face and those eyes to very good effect in “When Did You Last See Your Father?,” creating a complex portrait — executed in broad strokes rather than detailed lines — of a needy, somewhat desperate man whose bullying ways and boorishness obscure his other qualities, particularly from his only, increasingly estranged son.  The movies are filled with epically bad fathers, legendary monsters, destroyers of women and children alike. One reason may be that monsters are inherently dramatic and cinematically easy: A shaking fist or a smack across a downy cheek can goose up even the flattest scene. One of the nicest surprises here is that Arthur isn’t a monster, simply careless, sometimes cruel. He routinely calls the younger Blake fathead and blunders into his son’s private life whenever it suits him. He lies and flirts and, worst of all, routinely and publicly humiliates his wife, Kim, a monument to connubial patience, played by the stellar Juliet Stevenson. It’s no wonder that the adult Blake can’t see his father as just a man — the child never did, never could.  Fluidly edited, the film regularly shifts between the present, with the adult Blake confronting death, and the past, with the younger Blake confronting life. For the most part this oscillation between time frames and emotional registers works well, even if Mr. Tucker, whose sensitive touch with actors is his greatest strength as a director, tends to clutter up the scenes with too much fussy, self-conscious camerawork. It’s a pleasure to watch Mr. Firth — a supremely controlled actor who makes each developing fissure visible — show the adult Blake coming to terms with his contradictory feelings, letting the love and the hurt pour out of him. If only Mr. Tucker had let the tears flow and kept his whirling dervish of a camera on a much shorter leash.  “When Did You Last See Your Father?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for salty language and chaste fumbling. 

Immaculately acted, professionally helmed and saturated in period British atmosphere, �When Did You Last See Your Father?� is an unashamed tearjerker that�s all wrapping and no center. Showcase for English vet Jim Broadbent, as a charismatic dad whose son feels perpetually overshadowed, just about manages to go its hour-and-a-half distance by dint of its performances. Undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings, pic should find a specialty welcome among fans of Blake Morrison�s 1993 memoir, offshore Brit-fare enthusiasts and distaff auds of a certain age.
Skedded for release in Blighty Oct. 10, and Stateside through Sony Pictures Classics in February, the film should also figure into the upcoming awards season (following its Toronto screening) as the kind of tony Brit-lit picture older voters go for. But by never getting to the heart of the matter, nor having even one scene where father and son really talk
, the movie has a big black hole at its core. In the smorgasbord of father-son relationship pics, this one is very low-cal.
Film opens exactly as Morrison�s memoir does: with boyish Blake (Bradley Johnson) stuck in a country traffic jam with his dad, Arthur (Broadbent), and mom, Kim (Juliet Stevenson), during a summer in the late �50s. As a voiceover by the adult Blake (Colin Firth) explains, �My father could talk his way into, and out of, anything.� Soon, the irrepressible Arthur has managed to skip the car queue and parlayed his way into reserved seating at the races.
It�s the first of several set pieces in which Arthur, a country doctor whose bragadaccio masked a real love for his wife and children, shows not the slightest embarrassment for those around him. Cut to London in 1989, where Blake is having some quick nooky with his wife, Kathy (Gina McKee), and their lovemaking is interrupted by dad�s knock on the door. �The sex police,� mutters Blake, a phrase that is shown to resonate from his teenage years, when dad was always interrupting his fumbling attempts at sexual congress.
Soon afterward, Arthur is diagnosed with terminal cancer and, as Blake visits him in the family home, the script starts freely moving among three timeframes: the late �50s, with Blake as a kid in short pants; through the �60s, in which Matthew Beard plays Blake as a hormonal teenager; and 1989, when Blake is a grown adult with his own career as a writer-poet. 
Collection of episodes, mostly from the �60s, contain some amusing stuff: Blake and Arthur getting waterlogged on a camping expedition; Blake falling head-over-heels for their gutsy young Scottish au pair (Elaine Cassidy, in pic�s standout support); and Blake�s clumsy attempts to chat up Rachel (Carey Mulligan), a girl he meets on holiday who�s more interested in his dad. This is just as well, as there�s precious little happening onscreen in the relationship between father and son.
Morrison�s memoir managed to sustain a fairly ordinary story through the easy grace of its writing. Divorced from the page, and with little backgrounding on any of the characters, the yarn lacks the drama and conflict necessary for a feature film, and largely ambles along on good performances. 
Things aren�t helped any by Firth�s dour perf, as his Blake comes across as a self-centered whiner, a latter-day Me Generation figure who�s obsessed with finding problems when there really aren�t any. And with Broadbent playing Arthur as a charming blusterer who wouldn�t hurt a fly, there�s no true conflict at script�s heart.
Supporting performances are strong, with Stevenson aces as the underplayed mom, Beard good as the teenaged Blake and Mulligan ditto as the elusive Rachel. McKee, who�s really developing as an actress in her middle years, is notable as Blake�s wife, as far as her part is written.
Period flavor -- with saturated colors in the �50s scenes that grow duller in subsequent timeframes -- is strongly detailed in Alice Normington�s production design and Caroline Harris� costumes, both heightened a notch beyond naturalism. Composer Barrington Pheloung�s chordal washes flood the yarn with wistful emotion.


Directed by Anand Tucker  with the same intelligent tact he brought to Hilary and Jackie , and cleanly adapted by David Nicholls  from a brutally frank memoir by British writer Blake Morrison , this minor pleasure of a drama about an aggrieved son (Colin Firth  in the Blake role) re-evaluating his relationship with his cantankerous old sod of a dying father (Jim Broadbent  as Arthur Morrison) is the kind of superior middlebrow filmmaking at which the Brits excel. Excellent team-player acting from the likes of Juliet Stevenson  as the put-upon wife and Sarah Lancashire  as the reflexively carnal other woman rounds out Broadbent's characteristically elastic performance as a father more heedless than cruel. But the star is gangly young Matthew Beard , who gives a wonderfully precise reading of the teenage Blake, trapped in a morass of self-righteous arrogance and confusion, yet woefully lacking the experience to fill in the bigger picture. Arthur Morrison 's death is as graphically physical, as comically banal, and, finally for Blake, as profound as life itself. The scattering of the ashes allows Arthur's family to celebrate the dead by remembering what a cheap bastard dad was, and allows Blake to move on from his Big Sulk.
