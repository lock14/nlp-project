In their first feature, former Austinites the Duplass brothers � Jay directs, Mark acts and produces, together they write � have made a near-perfect relationship-trauma comedy. It�s ragged in all the right ways, just like the way we love and wake up to the realization that that love has gone sour. It hasn�t soured completely for Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Aselton), but something�s off for sure. They�ve been together for years, and, now in their mid-20s, they�re treading water. She�s wants a proposal; Josh, as his father puts it, is waiting for something either really good or really bad to happen to make the decision for him. They get good and bad and everything in between when they embark on a road trip from New York down to Atlanta with the goal of picking up a purple fabric La-Z-Boy recliner that Josh bought off of eBay. It�s a replica of the puffy chair his father owned in the Eighties; they plan to deliver it to Josh�s father in Atlanta as a birthday present. Sounds simple enough, but from the moment they stop to pick up Josh�s neo-hippie brother, Rhett (Wilkins), they meet one complication after another, most of them the result of Josh�s well-meaning but relentless ineffectualness. He�s a particular brand of hipster-in-a-hoodie, one who used to be a rocker but settled into being a booking agent; it�s hinted that Emily pressured him to abandon his band and, most significantly, the brutal touring schedule that kept him away from her. Their relationship is a house of cards of hints like this, artfully mimicked in the sometimes-fidgety camerawork that shifts in and out of focus, much like the balance of power in their relationship. They�re mired in the universal ways of dysfunctional couples � the doublespeak and hidden agendas � but the film works so well and cuts so close to the bone because Josh and Emily are at once immediately recognizable and entirely unique. They have their own language, hard-earned after years together, their own way of communicating (an amalgam of baby talk and an old-man-gumming that seamlessly trips between endearing and aggravating) and their own way of rocketing the other into giggle fits or blind rages. It�s all so goddamn realistic and reminiscent of real-life love (and how often does that happen onscreen?) that The Puffy Chair
 would be hell to watch if it weren�t so funny. There�s comedy gold in the many indignities the puffy chair must suffer, and even more to be mined in the abuses the three travelers hurl one another�s way. The film is scored to a hell of a road mix, an indie rock wet dream of a soundtrack (Matt Pond PA, Of Montreal, Death Cab for Cutie) that�s never used indulgently � no �this song will change your life� cringe-isms to be had here. The Puffy Chair
 would never presume so much, and it�s in that unassumingness that this little charmer wins your heart, even as it�s breaking it. (For an interview with the filmmakers see

The sly ultra-low-budget film ``The Puffy Chair" fits right in with recent news reports about college graduates refusing to grow up already. If 30 is the new 20, as the headlines say, this movie insists that 25 is the new 12.
Directed by Jay Duplass from a script by his brother Mark, ``The Puffy Chair" stars the latter as a young slacker named Josh, who's already in denial about the way his life isn't going. His rock band a failure, Josh has disinterestedly turned to music promotion, and his relationship with winsome longtime love Emily (Kathryn Aselton) is feeling the strain. She wants to talk marital commitment, which may simply be asking too much of a guy who calls his girlfriend ``dude."
The film puts us right at the chipped kitchen table with these two, avoiding context or larger framework, and it assumes (rightly) that self-absorbed 20-somethings will recognize the psychic terrain as their own. A delicate vibe of romantic dinner-a-deux is quickly spoiled when Josh takes a cellphone call from one of his buds and Emily storms out. Dude!
Whatever inarticulate demons are gnawing at Josh, he'll do anything to steer clear of them. Instead he talks bravado and plows his insecurities into a weekend car trip to pick up a secondhand purple La-Z-Boy
 -- the puffy chair of the title -- which he plans to deliver to his dad in time for Father's Day. First mistake: Never trust the photos you see on eBay
.
Emily comes along for the ride -- she rather touchingly takes his invitation as a sign of love when it's really just a way to shut her up -- and the two make an overnight stop with Josh's kid brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins). Here's where the film starts showing its teeth. Rhett's one of those earnestly crunchy young men who loves to lecture people on their insensitivity while remaining blind to his new-age caddishness. Why bother with a puffy chair, he wonders, when the brothers can be
 their own surprise gift to dad? He has a point, but he's still insufferable.
Ostensibly a road-trip farce, ``Chair" really depicts the highway to man-child hell: The laughs come from the gulf between how mature the characters think they're being and what emotional toddlers they are. A scene where Rhett woos a small-town free spirit (Julie Fischer) and cements their instant eternal love with impromptu wedding vows supplied by Josh is funny, telling, and ruthless. ``I promise to always support you in what you want, even when you don't know what you want" -- a divorce lawyer couldn't come up with a better escape clause.
``The Puffy Chair" is part of the wave of no-budget human comedies made by up-and-coming filmmakers such as Andrew Bujalski (``Funny Ha Ha") and Joe Swanberg (``LOL"): rough-hewn narratives of the hip and clueless. The found sound, wobbly camerawork, and throat-clearing performances all aim to replicate ``real life" as it's experienced in underdecorated first apartments three blocks from campus.
In many ways, of course, these movies are just as navel-gazing as their antiheroes. There's no reference to a larger world of other people's problems and pleasures, no sense that life exists outside the postcollegiate playpen. When we finally meet Josh and Rhett's parents, they're stick figures who offer few insights into why their sons are such big babies. ``The Puffy Chair" is an act of self-critical solipsism.
At least the Duplasses don't soft-soap us. The final scene is sad, abrupt, and more caustically on target than anything in the big-budget Jennifer Aniston relationship comedy that opens today. Breaking up is hard to do, says this movie, but growing up may be impossible.
