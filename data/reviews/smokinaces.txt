Follow closely: A cheesy Vegas illusionist turned mafioso (Piven) is marked for death after striking a prosecution deal. Enter the stalwart federal agents (Garcia, Liotta, and Reynolds), the bail bondsmen (Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, and Peter Berg), the hookers, the entourage, the attorneys (Bateman and Curtis Armstrong), and myriad assassins who blow shit up real good. Ignore the limp dramatic bits involving a character�s mysterious backstory, and a person could have a reasonably good time with this Tarantinoid actioner. On the plus side, it�s got sleek European styling, cutesy contrapuntal cuts, and a whole lot of heavily armed people in one location. The actors get to riff � Matthew Fox all but dissolves into the minor role of a geeky security guard � and there�s a certain spirit of fun afoot, but Bateman carries the whole thing away in his two scenes: one with a giant disembodied bunny head and one in ladies� lingerie. Half the time the movie wants to be balls-out weird, and it is. But the other half � the half with the good guys � is plodding procedural fare. The star attractions are the Tremor Brothers (Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, and Maury Sterling) � Mad Max types who, I�m happy to report, eventually come blazing out of a smoke-filled hotel elevator waving machetes and chain saws; a chandelier takes it, even. It�s a breathtaking set-piece, but there�s not actually much tension in the movie besides that which Carnahan achieves by cutting between his multiple subplots, and if you�re going to put a torturer in your film, someone should actually be tortured. (No, the expository montage at the beginning doesn�t count.) I�m still puzzling over the �foxy� assassins (Keys and Taraji P. Henson of Hustle & Flow
), whose frustrated lesbian attraction takes the shape of Henson blasting holes in a hotel with heavy artillery while Keys gets carried off by Common.


What are we to do with "Smokin' Aces" ? A first impulse is to give this alarmingly trigger-happy movie a bath. Jeremy Piven , playing a magician-turned-gangster, spends nearly every scene in a cold sweat, with dark, dilated eyes that make him look like an anime cokehead. (A bath would wash off that horrendous hairpiece, too.) And is there any room in the tub for Ben Affleck as a bail bondsman with a Windy City brogue or the trio of oversexed backwoods Nazis or the Ritalin-fueled karate kid who seems like an escapee from "Gummo" ? This movie would leave several rings around any bathtub.
More to the point, Joe Carnahan's shoot-'em-up is an unreasonable provocation. It teases us with action-movie frivolity, then rubs our noses in grisly bloodletting, all in the service of a plot hinging on a million-dollar bounty for Buddy "Aces" Israel . Buddy is about to rat out his Cosa Nostra mentor for the FBI, which has placed him under witness protection. At least four different cash-hungry mob factions plan to find Buddy in his federally protected sky suite at a Tahoe luxury palace, shoot him, and rip out his heart, per his affronted mentor's instructions.
Sadly, more than an hour of this movie is given over to talking. And not the wink-wink Quentin Tarantino kind, either. There are no sweet observations of the mundane. The characters speak in clumps of exposition. It's like being at a table reading for some pulp series whose first installments we've missed. The feds, the hired guns, the bails bondsmen all fill us in by filling each other in.
Some of the talkers include a clothed and almost-human Ryan Reynolds as a fed; as his partner, Ray Liotta , who was so scary in Carnahan's previous movie "Narc"; an excellently hopped-up Jason Bateman as a kinky yuppie; and the rapper and Gap pitchman Common , who, as one of Buddy's bodyguards, contributes a smoldering menace that's the hottest thing in the movie. Despite a few of these people and because of others, at some point you're all talked out and eager for something to happen. The movie flirts with kitsch, blaxploitation , and camp, but Carnahan nudges things along without much of a bark. Where, oh, where is the foaming Rottweiler relentlessness of "Narc"?
Well, it's waiting in the last 50 or so minutes, where the competing sides of this film are sucked toward a grisly hotel climax like debris into a vacuum bag. The plot is a little "True Romance" with a twist of "The Usual Suspects." But really, "Smokin' Aces" is the junkyard cousin of Steven Soderbergh's "Ocean's" movies, the first of which was set in Vegas hotels. (They also have a terrible Andy Garcia in common.) Soderbergh's capers are action movies where wit stands in for violence. The violence in "Smokin' Aces" stands in for wit. The characters are interesting only when they aim to kill.
And in that hotel sequence the mayhem feels disturbingly like combat. In a hotel across the way, the fabulous Taraji P. Henson (that singing hooker from "Hustle & Flow") sits behind one of the biggest guns I've ever seen. It stands on a tripod, and when she uses it to cover her girlfriend and co-hit-lady (an icy Alicia Keys ), her targets are flung across hallways. There's a shoot-out where the spray of bullets make an elevator look like a strobe-lit disco number from "Dreamgirls." And the wild Nazis wield their chainsaws and cutlery with obligatory glee.
In this sequence, "Smokin' Aces" becomes appalling, perhaps intentionally: rival factions competing to take out a man conveniently -- or perhaps just carelessly -- named Israel? It's not an allegory for war. It's a version of the real thing. Yet watching the mad abandon of the combatants and the modernity of the artillery it's impossible not to think of the bellicose factions in the Middle East.
The movie isn't exactly smart. Nor is it stupid. We're meant to take the brutality seriously. Blood is spilled and tears are shed over it. But like too many Hollywood directors Carnahan seems to get a charge from staging destruction. That hotel sequence is sexy filmmaking: All the movie's panache comes barreling out.
When it's over, the pointlessness of the carnage becomes the movie's backhanded point. You might even ask: Irresponsible action flick or treatise on the futility of war? But since the moral underpinnings don't stick, these are bogus questions. The bang is strictly for a buck.
.


         It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world of hit men, hookers and assorted crazies that writer-director Joe Carnahan has compiled in the willfully incoherent action-comedy "Smokin' Aces." The filmmaker spins a violent, cartoonish tale about a Vegas illusionist moonlighting in organized crime, an aging Mafioso who wants him dead, the FBI agents investigating them and the swarm of hired killers and bounty hunters who descend like locusts on his Reno hideout in pursuit of $1 million.
 
  Carnahan begins the film by dumping a truckload of exposition and clumsily handled back story on us, then spends the next 90 minutes or so assaulting us with over-the-top carnage and non-sequitur-driven gags. There are nuggets of humor and flashes of hilariously choreographed brutality among the splatter patterns, but his reluctance to develop any of the ideas beyond the vignette level makes for an unsatisfying whole.
 
 


         






   FOR THE RECORD:

  'Smokin' Aces': The review of the movie "Smokin' Aces" in Friday's Calendar section misstated one of the locations as Reno. It should have been Lake Tahoe, Nev. Also, the review misspelled the last name of actor Maury Sterling as Serling. —
 

 
  Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta (the latter starred in Carnahan's breakout 2002 cop drama, "Narc") play FBI agents performing surveillance in a van outside the home of Primo Sparazza, the vengeful godfather. When a rumor spreads through the underworld that Sparazza has put a price tag on the head of Buddy "Aces" Israel — the headlining entertainer with crime boss aspirations who's about to sing like a canary and enter the witness relocation program — potential executioners besiege the Biggest Little City in the World to try to claim the prize.
 
  Played by Jeremy Piven, Buddy is a card-flippin', coke-snortin', sleazeball head case holed up with a collection of high-end prostitutes in a hotel penthouse on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe while his attorney negotiates a deal with the deputy director of the FBI (Andy Garcia, sporting an unconvincing Southern twang). For the assassins lining up outside, the penthouse setup is like shooting fish in a barrel.
 
  Among the killers falling over one another in the hotel lobby and hallways are Georgia (Alicia Keys) and Sharice (Taraji P. Henson), a sexy but lethal pair straight out of a blaxploitation flick; the apparently inbred Tremor brothers (Chris Pine, Kevin Durand and Maury Serling), who'd be right at home in a Rob Zombie movie; the latex-masked, shape-shifting Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan); and Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell), a sadist so depraved he chewed off his own fingertips to avoid being ID'd. Ben Affleck, Peter Berg and Martin Henderson also show up briefly as skip tracers hired by a scene-stealing Jason Bateman, the only character in the film whose screen time is regrettably short.
 
  The degree of overkill these characters bring to the proceedings with their rocket-launchers, assault weapons and devices of torture is part of the blueprint. The unrelenting tenor, however, and blitzkrieg of a soundtrack are a cumulative drag.
 
  Logic and plot are convoluted afterthoughts in the world of "Smokin' Aces," but Carnahan takes great pains to conclude things with a shaggy dog ending and a twist that will only be surprising if you nodded off or dropped your Red Vines early on. It's a grindhouse-inspired concoction that may not contain a shred of originality, but it is executed with unbridled bombast and glee.
 
  If you poured "Oceans 11, 12, etc ... " and the "Kill Bill" movies into a blender, added some tomato juice and a shot of Tabasco — then threw it against a wall — it might look something like this.
 

 
  "Smokin' Aces." MPAA rating: R, for strong bloody violence, pervasive language, some nudity and drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 47 minutes. In general release.   

January used to be Hollywood's official doldrums month. It still is, only now it's a snazzier, more depraved wasteland. It's when audiences flock to ultraviolent hip trash to slap themselves out of the art stupor brought on by the season of Important Awards Films. The latest adrenaline shot to the solar plexus is Smokin' Aces , a cheerfully disposable gangland freak-show thrill ride that's been directed by the gifted Joe Carnahan (Narc ) as if he were trying to give the audience a seizure.
Early on, a couple of federal agents, Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta), sit in a surveillance van, punchy with boredom, eavesdropping on the late-night conversation of an ancient, prune-faced mobster across the street. The scene is edited so fast, with so many sound layers competing for your attention (I was still trying to digest the fact that Reynolds, the comic star of National Lampoon's Van Wilder  and Blade: Trinity , had graduated to playing furrowed crime investigators), that even the laziest action-junkie couch potatoes may find themselves leaning forward, working to take it all in  a not unpromising sensation for an underworld movie.
Cross-cutting as if on a cinematic crank jag, Carnahan leaps between tiny, glinting flashbacks, with half a dozen minor deadbeats  including the droll Ben Affleck as a mook of a bail bondsman  passing the narration to each other like a baton. It seems that Buddy ''Aces'' Israel (Jeremy Piven), a Las Vegas stage magician, became a noted underworld mascot, a leech who liked to hang out with gangsters, digging the drugs, the money, the girls, and finally  big mistake  the delusion that he was a gangster, too. He began to hatch criminal schemes that went wrong, and now, to extricate himself from the mess he made, he has agreed to rat out his Mob connections to the FBI.
As Buddy sits in the penthouse of the Nomad, a crystal-chintz-and-speckled-mirror casino in Lake Tahoe, a collection of freelance assassins, four in all, each more gonzo than the last, converge upon the city, trying to be the first to kill Buddy and cut out his heart (literally). Piven, more than any actor alive, can play high anxiety and mock it at the same time. I do wish Buddy were less of a patsy, though. There's a bizarre sequence where he wakes up in the penthouse after a wild night, surrounded by a dozen hookers passed out on the floor. It's like the aftermath of an explosion in a mannequin factory, and the joke  a tweak at Buddy's excess  is itself overdone.
Carnahan's sense of comedy, evident in just about every line of his Tarantinoid here's-the-fact-Jack repartee (''We wait any longer, someone's going to dead this fool!''), tries too hard to be cool; it's his cornball assertion of hard-boiled masculine style. Yet Smokin' Aces  has a catchy, pungent spirit, with an invention that seldom lets up. Carnahan will start a scene out of nowhere, with, say, a Rastafarian in a wheelchair machine-gunning half a dozen people in a downtown street (the punchline is the getaway), and his assassins keep upping the ante on sociopathic irreverence. The most enjoyable of these killers are a scar-faced master of disguise, embodied by Tommy Flanagan with a nearly Lecter-like wit and fluidity, and a tag team of lesbian homegirl sniper divas. They're played by Alicia Keys, who has just enough sleek attitude to evoke the young Pam Grier, and Taraji Henson, who convincingly mans  or, should I say, womans  a weapon powerful enough to have Donald Rumsfeld muttering with envy.
Smokin' Aces  is one of those movies in which criminals lock and load their guns as rhythmically as rock drummers, and the camera work is so fetishistically propulsive that it's like the filmmaker's own glorified form of gun-cocking. Each time a new unhinged killer walks onto the screen, he or she may be hero or villain  in this movie, it's hard to tell the difference  yet either way, you're invited to revel vicariously in the power, the surge of aggression served up raw and uncut. Carnahan, who gave Narc  unusual gravitas for a police thriller, is having his overbaked action jollies, and yet, in his so-passé-it's-almost-fresh Tarantino gloss, he's also a one-man pop culture vacuum cleaner. Smokin' Aces  is like a Cuisinart mash-up of Reservoir Dogs , Ocean's Eleven , GoodFellas , The Usual Suspects , and a Rob Zombie psycho horror flick. You can't take it seriously, but the movie is as lively as it is debased. The most decadent thing about it is that it's the sort of entertainment that people with genuine talent now make.

 “F.B.I.! F.B.I.!” Blam blam blam blam. “[Expletive]. [Expletive].” Blam blam blam. Spurt of blood. Plot twist. “F.B.I.! F.B.I.!” “[Expletive].” Blam blam blam blam blam. “[Expletive].” “F.B.I.!” “Hotel Security!” Blam. Exploding skull. Guy sits on a chain saw. Montage. [Expletive]. Plot twist. Roll credits.  Yes, I condensed a bit, and I’m sorry if I spoiled anything, but the above is a fair summary of Joe Carnahan’s “Smokin’ Aces,” a Viagra suppository for compulsive action fetishists and a movie that may not only be dumb in itself, but also the cause of dumbness in others. Watching it is like being smacked in the face for a hundred minutes with a raw sirloin steak. By the end, there’s blood everywhere, a bad smell lingering in the air, and vegetarianism — or starvation or blindness — starts to look like an attractive option.  Mr. Carnahan’s previous film, “Narc” (2002), with Ray Liotta and Jason Patric as a pair of hard-bitten Detroit detectives, won some respect for its brutal, pulpy integrity. It’s a mean little picture with reverberations of urban decay and masculine defeat.  “Smokin’ Aces,” breathless to be more — meaner, bloodier, funnier, cooler — manages to be quite a bit less. Arriving at least a decade too late to blend in with the other mid-90s “Pulp Fiction” wannabes, it jacks up the body count and wears its stylistic pretensions on its blood-stained sleeve.  More than anything else, the movie struggles desperately to achieve a transcendent state of hard-boiled pop-culture knowingness, to mash up a whole dictionary of poses and allusions in a gory, syncopated pastiche. Vegas mobsters! Topless hookers! Blaxploitation hit-chicks! Redneck bounty hunters! Not to mention the F.B.I. guys and also the hyperactive pipsqueak ninja whose grandma has clearly let him watch too many movies like this one.  And that’s not all. All these folks (minus the ninja and his granny) and a good many more (I forgot to mention the cretinous white supremacist punk-rock contract killers, the Latino torturer and the ruthless master of disguise) converge on a hotel in Lake Tahoe, where a coked-up sleazeball named Buddy (Aces) Israel has taken up temporary residence.  Does his surname make “Smokin’ Aces” a Zionist allegory about a scrappy underdog under siege from numerous enemies? Probably not, but the role does give Jeremy Piven, who plays the agent Ari Gold on “Entourage,” a chance to explore levels of sleaziness that make Ari look as righteous as a biblical prophet. He also throws playing cards (Buddy is a nightclub magician as well as a gangster) and weeps at the piteous waste of it all.  The F.B.I., represented by Ryan Reynolds and Mr. Liotta, with Andy Garcia as their buttoned-up boss, wants to bring Israel in alive so he can spill the beans on a mob boss named Sparazza. A trio of bounty hunters, led by Ben Affleck (nice mustache!), are also on the case.  Meanwhile, the million-dollar price that Sparazza and company have apparently put on Aces’ head attracts a diverse assortment of murderous free-lance talent, including Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson (“Hustle and Flow”), who bring some serious high-tech weaponry and a Sapphic vibe sure to titillate the mouth-breathing dudes for whom this movie was devised.  The babes, in any case, are secondary to the hardware. What makes “Smokin’ Aces” so bad is not the extremity of the violence, but Mr. Carnahan’s formal sloppiness and lack of imagination. The editing scheme, jumping from one set of characters to another, with cute juxtapositions of image or dialogue, is annoyingly literal-minded, and the climactic surprise manages to be both predictable and preposterous. The players are introduced with great fanfare, helpfully identified by on-screen nametags, but by the time they’re blown away (and most of them are), you don’t really care who they were.  Mr. Carnahan puts quite a few perfectly good movies through his genre meat grinder, and comes up with something like “The Departed” for dummies, with some slack-jawed nods to “Goodfellas” thrown in for good measure. No disrespect to Martin Scorsese, but I would like to propose a moratorium — it’s long overdue — on allowing up-and-coming male directors with something to prove free access to his oeuvre.  Or, at the very least, as penance for this lame, swaggering botch, Mr. Carnahan should be required to pitch his next movie as an homage to “The Age of Innocence,” or maybe “Kundun.”  “Smokin’ Aces” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). See the first paragraph above.

"Smokin' Aces" blows some cool smoke rings until it makes the very un-cool mistake of overstaying its welcome. Style and attitude, pegged to a baroque plot concerning an FBI plan to snare a key mob witness that attracts a virtual convention of world-class killers, burns up a lot of screen time but amounts to little more than some sensational scenes. However, as exemplified by strong U.K. returns last week bucking nay-saying critics, hungry young auds looking for fresh goods in January will flock to the mayhem, ensuring aces first-week B.O.
Much anticipated by fans of writer-director Joe Carnahan's Sundance hits "Narc" and "Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane," pic is far more under the sway of Quentin Tarantino's color-saturated bang-bang cinema than the helmer's previous work. Tarantino's shadow can be a dangerous thing: A better influence on Carnahan might have been author Elmore Leonard and his flair for weaving terrific story strands with vividly wrought characters.
Title cards misleadingly suggest pic is a true-life tale of the FBI's efforts to bring down the Mafia by getting to Vegas entertainer Buddy "Aces" Israel (Jeremy Piven) before the mob gets him first. In fact, though grounded superficially in the reality of organized crime's ties to Nevada showbiz, "Smokin' Aces" is pure gun-toting fantasy, daring auds to keep up with its high-speed narrative flow.
Placing surveillance on Mafia boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin), fed agents Carruthers (Ray Liotta, "Narc") and Messner (Ryan Reynolds) listen in on his plans to get rid of Buddy and remove his heart.
Meaning of this detail isn't addressed until a completely impenetrable wrap-up. But Buddy's importance -- he's at war with Sparazza for control of the Nevada mob -- is explained in a slickly assembled daisy chain of dialogues among the agents and their FBI topper Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia); bail bondsmen Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck), "Pistol" Pete Deeks (Peter Berg) and Hollis Elmore (Martin Henderson); and hired killers Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and lover Loretta Wyman (Davenia McFadden), who are aiming to bring Buddy down before the feds nab him.
This presumes, of course, that a second-rate Frank Sinatra could actually vie for a high Mafia position, but pic skips past this question and observes Buddy in his Lake Tahoe casino penthouse suite -- a diorama of coke-saturated, post-coital sleaze and decrepitude that says more about Buddy than any smart-ass dialogue could hope to.While Buddy spins his wheels, Carruthers and Messner's team moves in -- as do Dupree's crew, Georgia and Loretta, a crazed neo-Nazi trio called the Tremors, a legendary torturer/killer named Acosta (Nestor Carbonell) and master of disguise Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan).
Watching all these moving parts approach their target can be giddy fun, especially since Carnahan knows where to place his camera and, with editor Robert Frazen, when to cut for maximum effect. For sheer visceral buzz from opening to mid-section, pic delivers a lot of kick.
But the often-stunning set pieces (including a dazzling shootout involving at least three different parties) lead to a dead end before Buddy is ultimately removed from the scene. His dispatch is for different reasons than Reynolds' flummoxed Carruthers assumes, and the longer Garcia's Locke takes to explain, the deeper nonsense the film drifts into, as a bullet ballet turns into a jumble of whatsit devices that mean very little. Cinematographer Mauro Fiore pushes the widescreen image to extremes of color and texture, using the Tahoe sun and the casino's indoor artificiality to overwhelming effect. Carnahan's direction particularly well serves the effectively hyper Piven, Liotta, Affleck, Carbonell and Keys, who brims with sexy confidence. Tahoe provides a refreshing change of location from the now-common Vegas backdrop, and the soundtrack gathers up a bric-a-brac of music sources, including a relatively obscure Ennio Morricone cue from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."

New-school genre junk food: Take a Tarantino wannabe with Sundance credentials, add a large, famous-enough cast and a show-biz backdrop, season the violence with references to Sergio Leone  and Takeshi Kitano , serve cool, and garnish with a cynicism beyond irony.
Smokin' Aces is writer-director Joe Carnahan 's third and most elaborate featurefollowing his 1999 micro-indie calling card Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane  and well-received 2002 Independent Spirit nominee Narc . It presents as its anti-hero a glitzy stage-magician cum mobster mascot turned mob kingpin then FBI  informer. Buddy "Aces" Israel  (Jeremy Piven , who plays the equally egregious "super-agent" on Entourage  ) is, as someone in this overstuffed baloney and ketchup sandwich puts it, "the great white whale of snitches." Everyone wants a piece of this joker's hide, which, given its rumored million-dollar price tag, makes the Lake Tahoe  penthouse suite where he's laying low something of a magnet for a gaggle of competing hit squads. To add to the barbarism, the killers have orders to not just ice Israel butpace Mel Gibson to cut out his heart.
Let the games begin: A world series of assassins may be the movie's five-word pitch but, burdened with an unnecessarily complicated and aggressively insistent backstory and hence immediately unintelligible, Smokin' Aces is one busy-busy-busy movie. Israel is a compulsive card-shuffler and so is Carnahan. The screen splits, the action jumps, the FBI surveillance guys in the van outside are buzzed by superfluous static. There's no shortage of parallel action although Carnahan doesn't cut so much as switch channels in building up to the inevitable super-colossal shootout in Israel's supremely trashed suite.
Posturing is universal, with performances in this talky, degenerate Ocean's Eleven  ranging from the hyperactive to the uninflected. The obscure object of desire, his digs strewn with spent hookers, Piven's Israel is distinguished mainly by a frazzled lack of conviction. (He's a hustler without hustle.) Guest-star Ben Affleck  makes a mildly amusing low-rent bail bondsman; Andy Garcia , fighting through a mush-mouthed drawl as a soulless FBI bureaucrat, is rather less so. And, in a flash frame of cinema verité, Wayne Newton  himself gets a cameo.
A few livelier perfs may be found around the movie's edges. As a junior FBI agent on an increasingly perilous stakeout, Ryan Reynolds  stands out by just keeping focused and pretending to care about his buddy Ray Liotta , the film's unlikely elder statesman (and also a veteran of Narc ). Similarly, Alicia Keys  parlays a fetchingly bored attitude and hoochie-mama hot-pants into a credible movie debut; as her partner in crime, Taraji Henson  stops the show by stupefying an affably clueless desk clerk with her motor-mouth feminist rap.
Smokin' Aces  has no particular narrativeit's basically a study in convergence as a vast assortment of FBI guys, hotel security men, SWAT teams, and killers of all varieties, including a clan of lunatic chainsaw neo-Nazi mohawk-coiffed punks, fight, claw, and swarm their way up to Israel's suite. The get-ups are fun and, to add to the party, new characters keep arriving on the scene up until the very endit's nearly impossible to keep them all straight, particularly once they start shape-shifting and coming back to life. This is not necessarily a bad thing (Richard Kelly 's Southland Tales is a kindred, albeit far richer, example of shaggy-dog phantasmagoria.)
Self-important but not untalented, Smokin' Aces  is tonally consistent from beginning to end, and, for all its bloody mayhem, kinetic nihilism, and jive minstrelsy, has a surprisingly light touch. The laugh count is low, Henson's solo and a scene of Israel negotiating with the FBI through his agent notwithstanding, the best running joke is simply the gorgeous, indifferent Tahoe landscape. Carnahan does, however, have an oddball sense of comic timing; what his picture lacks in hilarity it recuperates with a well-developed, albeit mumbling, sense of the absurd.
