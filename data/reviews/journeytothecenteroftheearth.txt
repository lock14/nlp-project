Make sure to catch this latest iteration of the Jules Verne novel on a screen projecting it in 3-D format (some prints are 3-D, others regular 2-D), because without all the fun visual effects of stuff "comin' right at ya," this journey's center will not hold. Seemingly created to whet the audience appetite for a new age of digital 3-D (technological advances have recently improved the 3-D landscape � and the studios and exhibitors sure like the opportunity to remind us they have some big-screen tricks up their sleeves that can lure us away from our home-entertainment consoles), the filmmakers have paid little attention to character development or the screenplay, trusting Verne's far-fetched fantasia about the inner-Earth biosphere to carry the day. And for the most part, it does. Early scenes accustom the viewer's eyes to the 3-D phenomenon with yo-yo tricks and a memorable spit take shown from the point of view of the sink drain. These moments prepare us for the eventual experience of such things as 3-D dinosaur drool, carnivorous plants, piranhalike fish incisors, roller-coaster runs down mining transport tracks, an iridescent flock of birds, general free falls to the center of the Earth, and more. When the action is in the foreground, the film's visual thrills provide fun gasps and the feeling of a genuinely collective moviegoing experience. But the backgrounds generally look like 2-D matte paintings, and when combined with the hellzapoppin' happenings in the foregrounds, the finished look appears dull and desaturated. Brevig, a visual-arts coordinator making his first film as director, has been handed the reins of this sci-fi classic, a job appointment that probably predetermined the film's balance in favor of its graphic aspects. Verne, despite his visionary insight into so many futuristic things, kind of missed the boat with his goofy concepts about what resides at the center of the Earth. The dinosaurs and parallel, navigable tunnels alongside the magma are all Verne and can't be blamed on the imaginations of the overeager filmmakers. Perhaps the utter nonsense of it all is what makes the story ripe for eternal retelling. In Brevig's version, three central characters carry essentially the whole movie on their own: scientist Trevor Anderson (Fraser, who's become the studios' favorite go-to guy for family-friendly fare that nevertheless needs a muscular male hero), Trevor's nephew Sean (well-played by Hutcherson), and beautiful Icelandic mountain guide Hannah (Briem). The threesome often face their peril like some kind of chipper Swiss Family Robinson below the Earth's crust, but the quick 92-minute running time keeps the action moving chockablock forward to every new set-piece. No follow-up to Middle-earth, this Journey to the Center of the Earth
 provides tepid but fun entertainment.


For a harmless "Indiana Jones" knock-off, "Journey to the Center of the Earth" has an awful lot riding on it. The new film - the umpteenth screen iteration of the 1864 Jules Verne sci-fi novel - is also the latest movie to try to take 3-D technology mainstream.
Using plastic polarized glasses (rather than grandpa's red-and-green paper specs) and filmed with a camera invented by James Cameron for his own 3-D spectacular, "Avatar" (due in late 2009), "Journey" arrives in 800 US theaters that have been hastily fitted with the RealD digital projection system. The Regal Entertainment
 theater chain recently contracted with RealD for 1,500 more. DreamWorks and Disney/Pixar have vowed that all upcoming animated films will be released in 3-D. The paradigm shift is upon us.
What that immediately translates into is: Duck, you suckers - we're throwing more stuff at your heads. "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is perfectly engaging in a low-rent Saturday-matinee way, but when Brendan Fraser spits toothpaste at the camera about five minutes in, you know the spirit of 1981's "Comin' at Ya!" - the silliest entry in the last major 3-D push - lives on.
Fraser imports his amiable charisma from the "Mummy" movies to play Trevor Anderson, a hapless scientist whose brother Max (Jean Michel Pare) disappeared while exploring volcanic tubes that allow access to the earth's core. Max was a "Vernean," and so is Trevor: He believes Verne's book wasn't speculative fiction but a Lonely (Inner) Planet travel guide.
He's about the only one. The hero's teenage nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson, the go-to sensitive toughie of recent family films) hasn't read Verne and can barely be pried from his Sony
 PSP after mom drops him off with goofy Uncle Trevor. He scoffs and so does Hannah (Anita Briem), the fetching Icelandic mountain guide who agrees to take the two to the last of Max's tectonic sensors on a remote mountainside. There, of course, is the highway to hell Trevor has been looking for.
Well, it's not hell, but it's almost as hot. After a tumble down the tube, a rocketing ride in mine carts, a plummet through a thin sheet of muscovite, and another endless fall, the three wind up in a center of the earth that looks like the world's biggest unfinished basement. Which, in a sense, it is.
Except that unfinished basements don't have bioluminescent songbirds and galloping T. Rexes. "Journey to the Center of the Earth" sends Trevor, Sean, and Hannah traversing the core toward a hoped-for exit hole before rising temperatures vaporize them, and it throws what Sean calls Verne's "dangerous bits" at them, and us, with regularity. Toothy prehistoric fish, carnivorous plants, rampaging plesiosaurs all put in an appearance, and the movie buckets along with the pleasurable pause-eek-pause of an above-average theme park ride.
The movie feels weirdly underpopulated, though - a bare-bones approximation of epic splendor. The 3-D visuals, almost all in unappealing shades of brown, give the underground caverns clarity and depth but little weight; they're painterly vistas with small humans daubed into a corner. The only scene that breaks through into magic comes early, when the heroes' fall down a vent is broken by rising water droplets that slowly coalesce to form an underground sea. For a brief moment, we're not sure which way is up, and the disorientation feels delicious.
The rest of "Journey" remains earthbound. There are worse places to be, I suppose, since the cast is good company, and the action is steadily paced by Eric Brevig, a special effects craftsman getting his first shot at directing. He uses 3-D mostly for ambience, and he goes easy on the gotcha shots, but they're there, of course, since what 3-D movie would be complete without a yo-yo flying toward your head at high speed? (That bit, I'm guessing, is a tip of the hat to the paddleball man in 1953's pioneering "House of Wax.")
"Journey" is fun for the kiddies but it hardly represents an advance: As before, the gimmickry can't lift the boats of a threadbare storyline. What the proselytizers and the investors forget is that if the characters and emotions aren't three-dimensional, the rest of the movie will always look flat.


When I was a kid, the 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth , with James Mason, Pat Boone, and a lot of slithery cool dinosaurs, was one of my favorite movies to catch on Saturday-afternoon TV. It had a certain odd gravitas, with its crew of explorers getting increasingly desperate in their attempt to survive. (The sight of an actor as refined as Mason running around in rags was a shock.) The new Journey to the Center of the Earth , whether or not you see it in 3-D, has about as much gravitas as a helium balloon. Brendan Fraser  , as a floppy-haired academic looking for holes in the planet, takes his 13-year-old nephew and a pretty Scandinavian guide along with him, and the three never stop moving  rocketing around on diamond-mine carts; plunging through a muscovite floor and falling down, down, down; scurrying away from a T. rex (him again!) and other familiar terrors. Last year's Beowulf    employed 3-D with a certain fairy-tale savvy, but Journey  is just the new version of a 1950s comin'-at-ya roller coaster, with a tape measure, trilobite antennae, and giant snapping piranha thrust at the audience. Yet wandering around the earth's stalactite-dripped core exerts a primal appeal even in a dumb kiddie joyride like this one. In the best scene, Fraser's nephew clings to floating magnetic rocks above the deepest abyss you've ever seen, a situation that could give even jaded videogame kids vertigo.

 Like any conscientious movie critic, I do what I can to avoid clichés, and since I am only human I don’t always succeed. But I have long vowed never to stoop to what I regard as the lowest kind of hackery, which is to describe a motion picture as a thrill ride, a heckofa ride or any other kind of ride.  So what am I supposed to do about “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” a new movie that shares its name with a beloved Jules Verne novel, copies of which occasionally appear on screen? On their way to the titular destination, the three main characters — a geologist (Brendan Fraser), his young nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and an Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem) — speed down steeply inclined tracks in wheeled cars, rather like a roller coaster. A bit later, as they fly through the subterranean air, one of them predicts that they will descend into something “just like a water slide.” Near the end, after they have parasailed, fled from beasts and surfed on magnetic rocks, they whiz down a green hillside on a sled improvised from the jawbone of a dinosaur. If this movie is not a ride, then what is it?  One thing it may not be, quite, is a movie. The 3-D technology, which you experience (in the theaters where it’s available) through spiffy gray-tinted glasses, does provide a few “Wow!,” “Eww!” and “Yikes!” moments, though the most impressive of them are also the least spectacular, as when Mr. Hutcherson  swings a yo-yo or Mr. Fraser, after brushing his teeth, spits into the sink. Otherwise the effect messes with your ability to see clearly what is in the frame, so that the actors look like cutouts arranged in a snow globe.  Not that they have much dimension to work with, since the script, by Michael Weiss, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin, is as functional as the direction, by Eric Brevig, is fussy. The geologist, whose brother vanished trying to prove his Vernean hypothesis, takes the brother’s adolescent son to Iceland, where they meet the  mountain guide, whose father also vanished into the center of the Earth. A lot of scientifically preposterous, mildly diverting stuff happens down there, and then, just like that, the ride is over.  “Journey to the Center of the Earth” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few mildly upsetting and potentially scary encounters.

With a principal cast of only three, the new 3-D �Journey to the Center of the Earth� probably has the highest screams-per-capita ratio in the history of action-adventure pics, and a better thrill-per-minute deal than most. Visual-effects vet and debuting helmer Eric Brevig makes clever use of the 1864 Jules Verne novel and its fantastical, subterranean wonderland, and fortunately has on hand thesp Brendan Fraser -- whose mission in Hollywood seems to be to humanize the most f/x-besotted adventure. Boisterous action, 3-D visuals and equal doses of humor and chills should rocket the deep-dwelling tale into strong B.O. orbit.
From space travel to submarines, the writings of French sci-fi pioneer Verne predicted much of what would be discovered and invented in coming years. But �Journey to the Center of the Earth� was uncharacteristically wrong about ... well, everything, but especially the Earth�s interior, which Verne imagined as a realm  of dinosaurs and secret oceans, and a maze of natural phenomena.
Henry Levin�s 1959 adaptation featured pop idol Pat Boone (singing and shirtless), an operatic Arlene Dahl and the campiest-ever performance by the great James Mason. Levin moved the story from Hamburg to Edinburgh, added a subplot in which the explorers were being pursued by rivals and otherwise followed the Verne-ian itinerary -- heroes enter the Earth in Iceland, experience the terrible, the perilous and the prehistoric, and emerge happily in Italy.
Following a mercifully updated script by Michael Weiss, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin, Brevig puts the Verne book itself in the hands of hero Trevor Anderson (Fraser), an American professor and seismological prophet, whose brother Maxwell disappeared mysteriously some years earlier. 
When Max�s son, Sean (Josh Hutcherson) -- predictably, a miserable, materialistic and bored adolescent -- comes to visit for 10 days, he brings along a box of Max�s papers. Inside is a copy of �Journey to the Center of the Earth,� with notes indicating Max�s Verne-ish theory that volcanic tubes -- bypassing the magma one would expect to find below the surface -- could provide entree to the core of the planet. Like every �Journey� hero, Trevor impulsively drops everything and heads for Iceland, taking along the 13-year-old he�s supposed to be babysitting.
Fraser is an interesting commodity: Good-looking, charming and possessed of great comic timing, he seems capable of doing it all (see �The Quiet American�) and is certainly a refreshing ingredient in �Journey,� which could have dispensed with humanity altogether in its headlong pursuit of CG pyrotechnics. What the film needs -- the book had it, and the 1959 film had it inadvertently -- is humor, which Fraser provides. That�s a lot more than one gets from the stiffly Scandinavian Anita Briem, who looks beautiful, much like a glacier.
Conveniently, Briem�s character, Hannah, is a mountain guide whose late father was, like Max, a �Vernian� -- someone who believed Verne was writing fact rather than elaborate fiction. Hannah finds this all very embarrassing but agrees to take Trevor and Sean to the mouth of the volcano for 5,000 kroner a day. One anticipates the frostiness between Trevor and Hannah will thaw, which it does, as Sean looks on with adolescent envy/yearning/disgruntlement. But it takes a while.
In the meantime, the trio perform alternately dangerous and ridiculous feats of derring-do -- jumping into a couple of handcars on a decrepit mining rail line, by which they plummet miles below sea level to a jewel-encrusted cavern floored with fragile muscovite. This, of course, collapses spectacularly, after several seconds of will-it-or-won�t-it, sending our heroes to even greater depths. There, they find carnivorous plants, �Alien�-like fish and Tyrannosaurus Rex. Who knew?
What �Journey to the Center of the Earth� emphasizes is how technology ends up dictating content: Helmer Brevig seems compelled to remind us, now and again, that we�re in 3-D, so something flies at our faces for no apparent reason except to justify the ad budget. It�s ornamental, gimmicky and wholly unnecessary in a film where the narrative and 2-D effects would have been absorbing enough on their own.
A more unavoidable obstacle here is that there�s not much in the way of plot -- the story is in the tour through the labyrinthian intimacies of inner Earth. As such, it�s an f/x wizard�s dream, and Brevig makes the most of it.
Production values are first-rate. 


Let's be clear about one thing: Journey to the Center of the Earth  is more a demo reel than a narrative feature. It's a decent, if overly familiar and yawningly obvious compendium of look-at-me moments intended to show off the latest and greatest in stereo 3D filmmaking, in which the same thing's shot twice, more or less merged into a blurry single image and rendered almost-kinda-sorta-not-really lifelike through the polarized shades of the RealD glasses you get to wear (and keep!). It's successful enough to merit further exploration into 3D filmmaking, where, till now, the greatest advancement has been that, well, 3D no longer hurts your eyes as much as it used to. Seriously, to the director and his team of assemblymen, a pat on the back—look forward to what you come up with when blessed with a real screenplay, a few more dollars for special effects that don't look for total shit, and an actor who hasn't played against green screens for so long he's forgotten how to relate to people. Should be interesting.
Till then, we're stuck with another in a long line of remakes of Jules Verne 's 1864 novel—which hit its apex for those of us in our late thirties with the Saturday-morning cartoon and Rick Wakeman 's epic-length prog-rock retelling, the first  to do so in stereo. The new Journey  is more or less a remake of director Henry Levin 's 1959 offering, in which James Mason , as precursor to both James Bond  and Indiana Jones , drags Pat Boone  and Arlene Dahl  down to a prehistoric art gallery stocked with assorted matte paintings and papier-mâché sculptures that give the earth's core a groovy, lived-in vibe. Levin's was a template for the innerspace sci-fi films of the late '50s and early '60s, and here, director Eric Brevig —a visual-effects coordinator finally taking his seat in the director's chair—is just tracing old footsteps, with Brendan Fraser  filling Mason's sturdier boots.
Oh, but it's in 3D this time—the best thing about which you can say is: "Hey, no headache!" With a catering budget to cower his predecessor's special-effects outlay, Brevig's version still feels astoundingly less ambitious than Levin's, which made more with less. If the 3D here is better than average, slightly , the rest of the movie brings it way, way down—not quite to the center of the earth, but at least a good six feet under.
Fraser, about to appear once more shouting for his Mummy  in a googolplex near you, has completely forgotten how to speak to other actors; it no longer looks like the guy's reading from cue cards, but shouting from them. As Trevor Anderson , a disheveled science professor mourning for a brother who died looking for the center of the earth, Fraser's so wide-eyed that he's blank-eyed, marching from one scene to the next, plot-plot-plotting along till, whoops, that's a mighty deep hole .
The movie takes its time arriving at the earth's core—there's another visitor to pick up, love interest Hannah (Anita Briem ), the Icelandic tour-guide-slash-model—and then rushes to escape from it, almost in embarrassment. There's good reason not to linger downtown: All the filmmakers summon from their collective imaginations is a dingier version of Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory, replete with giant mushrooms and glow-in-the-dark birds that, close up, look like Mr. Bluebird escaped from Song of the South .
Episodes of Land of the Lost  were more inspired.
