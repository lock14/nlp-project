For fans of lousy seasonal cheer, Dec. 25 comes early. "The Perfect Holiday" has tumbled down from the North Pole and landed under the megaplex tree. Gabrielle Union plays Nancy, a single mother of three whose only Christmas wish is a compliment from a man. Her daughter shares this with Benjamin, a shopping mall Santa who by night is an aspiring songwriter.
This man is played by the redoubtably handsome Morris Chestnut. He gives Nancy her compliment and proceeds to date her while having to fib about his Santa job and music dreams. One of her little darlings, John-John (Malik Hammond), disapproves, going so far as to tell Santa (the boy doesn't know they're the same guy) that Santa needs to break up the relationship. He's rooting for mommy to get back together with daddy, a mock-lascivious hip-hop star called J-Jizzy (Charlie Murphy).
Murphy, along with the corpulent Faizon Love, as Benjamin's buddy, and Katt Williams, as J-Jizzy manager-producer, win all the laughs. Rachel True and Jill Marie Jones play Nancy's pals.
The idea that a woman as decent as Gabrielle Union would give J-Jizzy one baby let alone three seems preposterous - yet something like that happens every day. What doesn't happen that often is Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard showing up in the same movie. Yes, here they are playing a pair of guardian angels. She's sweet, he's spiteful, and they're both scathed - the Queen even more so since that's her name under the producers' credit, and she does all the talking. When she looks at the camera and says, "Better watch out, girlfriend. Santa's comin' to town," it sounds like a jolly threat. Howard, for his part, just looks really high.
Meanwhile, the direction - a term used here only out of habit - is courtesy of Lance (formerly "Un") Rivera, the hip-hop executive whom Jay-Z notoriously stabbed several years ago. Rivera demonstrates an allergy to storytelling (there's a cream for that) and tries about four different tones - Terry McMillan exhalation, "Pootie Tang" showbiz farce, romantic comedy, and, my favorite, family TV-movie drama.
The wild indifference to quality is accidentally entertaining until it's demoralizing. How can so many talented, powerful-enough black people turn out a movie this dingy? Looking for an upside is like finding good produce in certain urban supermarkets: very hard. You want to make lemonade from this, but even the lemons stink.


In The Perfect Holiday , Benjamin (Morris Chestnut) is a struggling songwriter and part-time mall Santa; Nancy (the ever-winning Gabrielle Union) is a divorcée whose daughter asks Santa to bring Mom a man. Will they find love for Christmas? Well, duh. So why throw in a bizarre device involving Queen Latifah as a narrating angel and a creepy, sallow Terrence Howard as her adversary? Their A-list names may be a draw, but it's too bad no one thought the endearing performances in this charming (if cliché) family romance would be enough.

 In “The Perfect Holiday” Nancy (Gabrielle Union), a divorced mother of two boys and a girl, glumly faces Christmas in New Jersey without a man in her life. Rubbing salt in her wounds is her ex-husband, J-Jizzy (Charlie  Murphy), a preening rap star with whom she is locked in a custody battle. Swathed in chinchilla, he is stymied on his current project, a Christmas album that includes gems like “I Love the Ho Ho Hos.”  When Nancy’s daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), overhears Mom confiding to a friend that all she wants for Christmas is a compliment from a man, she passes along the wish to the handsome Santa at the local mall. In real life he is Benjamin (Morris Chestnut), a conveniently unmarried, struggling songwriter whose latest opus, a squishy mound of seasonal goo of the sort J-Jizzy could never write, reaches the rapper’s hands at an opportune moment.  Benjamin, who noticed Nancy at the mall, takes Emily’s cue, tracks down the mother and delivers the requested compliment, then disappears. Nancy and her posse eventually find him, and romance blossoms. The only obstacle to happily-ever-after is Nancy’s older son, John-John (Malik Hammond), who takes an instant loathing to Benjamin. But the chances that Santa is Mr. Right are about as good as those of hearing “Jingle Bells” in a department store during the Christmas season.  Santa and J-Jizzy each have comic sidekicks. Santa’s is Jamal (Faizon Love), a plus-size elf who, when called upon, has trouble squeezing into a Santa suit, and Jizzy’s is his exasperated manager, Delicious (Katt Williams).  Lurking on the sidelines are Queen Latifah as the unctuous Christmas angel who narrates the story, and Terrence Howard as her troublemaking opposite, Bah-Humbug.  “The Perfect Holiday,” directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn’t believe in itself. The farcical contortions are stiff, the jokes flat, the romance half-baked, the acting rote and the familial bonhomie lukewarm. Watching the movie is like reaching into a Christmas stocking and pulling out handfuls of cheap plastic toys that are broken.  “The Perfect Holiday”  is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mildly off-color humor.

There's a lot of sap in this Christmas tree. The self-proclaimed "first African-American ensemble comedy" of the season (despite following November hit "This Christmas"), helmer Lance Rivera's romance "The Perfect Holiday" is neither perfect nor much of a holiday, more like a fruitcake passed around from arthritic aunt to demented uncle -- stale, predictable and made with fossilized ingredients. Box office will be healthy enough, given its aim at an underserved audience, although pic can't quite be called much of a service to anybody.
Seizing upon that perennial yuletide staple, divine intervention, "The Perfect Holiday" opens with Queen Latifah as some kind of angel (she's identified only as the "narrator"), trying to catch the first snowflake of the winter on her tongue. It's an appealing image. Belittling her efforts is Bah-Humbug, her antithesis in Christmas cheer (played by Terrence Howard, who seems to have lost a bet).
The mortals they'll be following are Nancy (Gabrielle Union), a single mother of three who's in the midst of a nasty custody battle with her ex, rapper-producer J-Jizzy (a delightfully obnoxious Charlie Murphy). How these two got involved in the first place is the great mystery of the movie, since Nancy is womanly perfection and Jizzy makes Snoop Dogg seem like Noel Coward. Anyway, all Nancy would like is for a normal man to pay her a compliment and then go away. When her daughter Emily (Khail Bryant) pays a visit to the local department store, she tells Santa her mama's Christmas wish.
In the movie's second major implausibility, Santa is being impersonated by aspiring singer-songwriter Benjamin Armstrong (Morris Chestnut), who' so good-looking that any store manager with half a brain would have at least moved him to fragrances. But no, he's got a lap full of kiddies and a heart full of love: As Latifah has shown us, he'd give his last five bucks to the homeless and is so touched by Emily's plea that he sets out to pay Nancy a compliment. Which he does. And then walks away.
This, of course, is the equivalent of an all-points bulletin to Nancy and her two BFFs (the wonderful pair of Jill Marie Jones and Rachel True). Like drug-sniffing dogs at the airport, they track down Benjamin, in the meantime encountering his fat friend Jamal (the ever-funny Faizon Love) and hooking Nancy up with Benjamin in a scene that would give auds diabetes even if it weren't staged in a candy store.
With the exception of Chestnut, who seems to be under the impression he's in a Bloomingdale's catalog rather than a romantic comedy, the cast is good -- including the kids, even though they serve rather perfunctory duties: The oldest, John-John (Malik Hammond), develops a virulent allergy to Benjamin, hoping instead his parents will get back together and sabotaging an otherwise dare-we-say-it-perfect affair of the heart. Complicating matters is Benjamin's enlistment by Jizzy's manager, Delicious (a terrifically droll Katt Williams), to help out with Jizzy's Christmas album, which at that point consists only of such surefire hits as "I Love the Ho Ho Hos" and "I Saw Mommy Capping Santa Claus."
The device of having Howard and Latifah (one of the film's producers) only occasionally enter the picture to perform some kind of idle magic feels so tacked on, it's ludicrous (not Ludacris). But from the opening credits, which have the retro look of an old "Lucy Show," nothing here seems to have been sufficiently thought out.
Adding to the pic's lack of seasonal cheer is the blandness of the cinematography and production design.

Nancy (Gabrielle Union ) is a normal suburban mom who wears sweatpants as she shuttles her kids to and from ballet class. She's also trying to move on from an ill-fated marriage to rap star J-Jizzy (Charles Q. Murphy , flashing his teeth and his bling). When her angelic daughter (Khail Bryant ) tells a shopping-mall Santa that all she wants for Christmas is for her mommy to be happy, Santawho turns out to be a regulation hottie underneath all that cotton woolgets to work. His real name is Benjamin (Morris Chestnut ), and he falls hard for Mommy. Unfortunately, Benjamin is also an aspiring r&b singer whose greatest desire is to have a record produced by J-Jizzy. During the ensuing hour of pratfalls and mistaken identities, the actors distinguish themselves mainly by their ability to make the material, directed and co-written by Lance Rivera , seem even more painfully awkward and unfunny than it already iswhich is very.
