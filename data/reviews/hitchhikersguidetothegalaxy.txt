Forget about race, class, and politics. The world is more simply divided into two distinct groups, those who get Douglas Adams and those who don�t. The British author, who died in 2001 while working on the second draft of this film�s screenplay, was and is wildly influential (Terry Pratchett�s million-selling Discworld
 novels are a direct descendant), and this long-awaited adaptation of Adams� main claim to literary fame arrives in a fog of expectation, and, in some quarters, dread. It�s good to report, then, that director Garth Jennings, one half of the duo Hammer and Tongs (best known for their music video for Britpop act Blur�s "Coffee and TV" single) has gotten Adams� comic sensibility � which on the page involves much geeky wordplay, extreme puns, and an absolute inability to take anything seriously � down pat. Fans of the novel can exhale, finally; panic is unwarranted. On the other hand, audiences unfamiliar with Adams� bizarre world may find themselves wondering what all the fuss was about and what, exactly, is going on in the film. Freeman (of the original, British version of The Office
) plays Arthur Dent, who awakes one morning to find his home about to be demolished to make way for a freeway bypass. Luckily, his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), in reality an alien travel writer, pops �round to inform him that the world is ending in a matter of minutes, targeted for demolition by a group of interstellar bureaucrats to make way for a hyperspace bypass. (This is the sort of ramrod irony Adams favored; it tends to work better in print than on the screen.) Ford and Prefect escape certain death by thumbing a ride on the alien�s ship, and from here on out it�s one loony adventure after another, all with a decidedly Monty Python
-esque edge. Eventually, and through plot contrivances far too byzantine to get into here, the duo land in the company of Zaphod Beeblebrox (Rockwell), the narcissistic, double-headed president of the Universe, who comes across as a cross between all the bad Seventies hard-rock bands you can recall and seminal movie stoner Jeff Spicolli. Rockwell is blatantly over-the-top and he deserves his own film; when he�s off the screen the film loses much of it antic spark. There�s a love story in here, too, between former easy Earth girl Trish McMillan (Deschanel), who says she rechristened herself Trillian "because it sounded more spacey," and Arthur, the spineless British everyman who wins out (sort of) in the end. The real star of the film, however, is the Jim Henson Creature Shop artists, who manage to make the many elaborate and decidedly old-school creature effects come to hilarious life. Jennings should be commended for sticking as closely as he does to, if not the letter, then the tone of Adams� work. One sequence involving a spaceship�s "infinite improbability drive" and an alternate reality in which everything appears to be made of yarn is worth the price of admission on its own. Still, if you�re not already an Adams fan, this film is unlikely to make you a convert. It�s nonstop chaos, and the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink style of comedy is taxing despite the frequent moments of pure comic genius. Familiarizing yourself with the book in advance � and Adams� unique wit � is highly recommended.


Don't panic: The long-awaited film adaptation of Douglas Adams's beloved science-fiction cult novel is not the disaster it might have been. There are inspired performances and belly laughs. Adams's tricky tone -- imagine the Pythons rewriting ''Star Wars" -- has made it onto the screen. The answer to life, the universe, and everything is still 42.
Yet ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is not the interstellar home run it might have been. Some of the film's most inspired scenes involve an Infinite Improbability Drive, which pops travelers from one side of the universe to the other and briefly transforms their spaceship into a giant apple, or a rubber duck, or a chrysanthemum, before letting it resume its normal state. The movie's like that, too: visually playful and often good fun, it never settles on a convincing narrative shape.
Still, it's impossible to dislike a film where the hero, a mild-mannered Englishman named Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman, from the BBC's ''The Office"), traverses the universe in his bathrobe because Earth was destroyed before breakfast. It turns out that while Arthur was fretting about a planned highway bypass running through his house, a Vogon Constructor Fleet is about to put a galactic bypass through the planet as a whole. Earth perishes not with a whimper or a bang, but a soft, silvery whoof
.
By good chance, Arthur's best friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is an alien researching Earth for the famous Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and so pulls the hapless human into space and onto a Vogon ship. The Vogons look like slimy potato sacks designed by the Henson Creature Shop -- which is pretty much what they are -- and they write poetry bad enough to liquefy a listener's brain.
How Arthur and Ford come to travel on the Heart of Gold, a spacecraft commandeered by galactic president and preening idiot Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), will be overly familiar to anyone who has read Adams's 1979 novel and its four sequels in the ''increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy" or listened to the late-'70s radio series or watched the 1981 BBC miniseries or played the 1984 videogame or read the early-'90s DC comics. Those without a clue may be better off.
Adams had the gall to die in 2000 after completing a first draft of the script; Karey Kirkpatrick (''Chicken Run") finished the job and music-video director Garth Jennings shepherded the results to the screen. Which means that while ''Guide" is infused with the profound playfulness of its creator, there's frustratingly little follow-through. The film opens with the transcendent dolphin musical number ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" and shortly thereafter presents us with an all-yarn action sequence. These scenes put a manic grin on your face that slowly and surely fades.
But what's good about the film is good indeed. The animated Guide sequences, designed by the London-based design outfit Shynola, are fast, clean, and clever -- just the sort of crisp anarchy Adams relished. The oddball casting by veteran Susie Figgis pays off: I'd never thought of rapper-turned-actor Mos Def as a slapstick comedian, but he gets Prefect's hapless aplomb just about right, and he does a mean double take. Alan Rickman provides the clinically glum voice of Marvin the Depressed Robot, even if that's Warwick Davis running around in the suit, and John Malkovich shows up briefly as a religious leader named Humma Kavula. Jason Schwartzman literally channel-surfs by in one scene.
''Guide" fanatics may be outraged, however, that Zaphod doesn't have two heads, side-by-side, as in the book; instead, they're stacked one atop the other, with the bottom one popping out like a yammering id every so often. (The effect is like having Owen and Luke Wilson in the same body.) The upside is that Rockwell pulls out all the stops as a fatuous galactic leader with half a brain, a down-home accent, and the knowledge that elected presidents are mere political diversions. Any similarity to current world leaders is a matter of your own convictions, but the sting's there if you choose to feel it.
Elsewhere, the sting is sadly missing. ''Guide" loses momentum as it boinks from planet to planet, and the romance between Arthur and his fellow earthling Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) is actually allowed to become serious. Perhaps this represents kowtowing toward box-office inevitability, but it also represents kowtowing away
 from Douglas Adams, who never in his life allowed sentiment to gum up the works.
But Deschanel is a sweetie, as always, and there are rich scenes amid the clutter, one involving a ''point-of-view" gun that does just what it says (threatened with it, Deschanel gets off one of the best slow-burning one-liners I've heard in a while). And, startlingly, ''Guide" trips into a moment of honest grandeur when Slartibartfast (a rather hesitant Bill Nighy) gives Arthur a tour of the factory floor where planets are built, and, for an instant, the movie becomes something more than the sum of its amusing, distracted parts.
''Hang the sense of it and keep busy," says Slartibartfast, diffidently offering Arthur his guiding philosophy of life. ''I'd rather be happy than right." Off beyond the edge of the universe, you just may hear Douglas Adams laughing.

         There's not much of the blithe spirit in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" that made "Star Wars" and even old "Flash Gordon" serials such fun. Amid a stupefying barrage of fantastic images involving all manner of special effects, spectacular production design and amazing creatures, there's a torrent of talk, much of it of an obscure scientific nature and all of it delivered with a parched, insouciant British wit.
 
  There are some inspired off-the-wall moments, but they are more than offset by a pervasive aura of tedium and the lack of any sense of the forward momentum necessary to sustain an adventure of this kind.
 


         






    Bringing to the screen the popular iconoclastic space adventure novel by the late Douglas Adams — he died after completing the second draft of the script — would be a massive undertaking, but surely first-time director Garth Jennings and his large cast and crew did not intend for the strain of their efforts to show so clearly.
 
  For all the shape-shifting and zany detailing and constant complications there is a fairly straightforward narrative thread linking all the adventures and episodes. The disappearance of the world's dolphin population signals that the destruction of Earth is imminent. Nebbishy Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) wakes up to find his farmhouse in England about to be bulldozed for a freeway, but up pops his pal Ford Prefect (Mos Def) to tell him to forget about it.
 
  Confessing that he is actually an alien, he reveals that Earth itself is about to be demolished by the Vogons of the planet Vogsphere, and Arthur had better hurry off with him to hitch a ride on a Vogon spacecraft if he is not to be blown up with the planet to make way for a space expressway. The two escape only to have to plead for their lives with the commander of the Vogon Constructor Fleet (voice of Richard Griffiths), a gigantic rhinoceros-like creature in whom Arthur discerns a poetic soul and a longing for love. This is the first of many tests and narrow escapes.
 
  When they come face to face with the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), Arthur realizes he's the smooth talker who lured saucy Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) away from him, as he hesitated to rush off with her to Madagascar — instead she rushed off into space with Zaphod.
 
  The movie is not without its pointed observations. The sexy but dim Zaphod, who at times is literally two-faced, speaks with a twang and admits he absentmindedly signed off on the destruction of Earth ("I haven't much time to read") and knocks back a supercharged cocktail, explaining that being president requires only half a brain.
 
  The brightest presence is the always fresh Deschanel, who has a light touch otherwise absent. Bill Nighy shows up late but most welcome as a wistful planet architect (his contribution to Earth was the design of Norway); John Malkovich plays a shrewd, half-bodied spiritual leader with Richard Simmons curls; and Helen Mirren supplies the voice for Deep Thought.

n the hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. It isn't that Arthur Dent, the hero of our charmingly bent story, has no feelings for this cursed plot, this Earth. But being English - and played by Martin Freeman, the lovesick sales representative from the original British television series "The Office" - he generally faces even the most perilous bumps during his intragalactic tour with a degree of resignation. On one occasion, though, he does steady himself with a cup of tea. Dent, it happens, has been saved from extinction by his alien buddy Ford Prefect (Mos Def), a smooth operator in a snow-white suit who fends off trouble with an ordinary bath towel and knows how to hitch rides on passing spaceships. Arthur and Ford initially land on such a ship, operated by the Vogons, an unpleasant race that constitute the bulk of the galaxy's bureaucracy and come equipped with expansive girths and lumpy porcine faces with smushed-in snouts. Beautifully constructed by the Jim Henson Creature Shop with an attention to expressive detail that recalls the political caricatures of Honor� Daumier, the Vogons function as the villains in this tale, though it is a measure of Adams's dry, gentle humor that the creatures' most devastating weapon is their exceptionally bad poetry. Adams's ever-expanding "Hitchhiker" universe began in 1978 as a BBC radio series that went on to spawn a novel, still more radio episodes, albums, a television series, four more novels (the author called the books "a trilogy in five parts"), a stage play, comics and a computer game. For years, Adams and various would-be collaborators tried  to add a movie to this list, but only after the writer died of  a heart attack in May 2001 at age  49 did the project start to take real shape. Among the directors approached was Spike Jonze, an inspired choice given that all his films feel as if they take place on another planet. He demurred, but recommended two British music video and commercial directors who work under the impossibly severe name Hammer and Tongs. Hammer and Tongs are actually Garth Jennings, who directed "Hitchhiker," and Nick Goldsmith, who served as one of the film's producers. Given their work's breezy mixture of high and low tech, geek-chic style and lightly skewed humor - their "Coffee and TV" music video for Blur features a walking, waving and smiling cartoon milk carton - it's easy to see why these unknowns received the nod (I suspect they were also comparatively cheap to hire). Like the other cinematic post-ironists, whose brightest lights include Mr. Jonze and another music director turned feature filmmaker, Michel Gondry ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"), Mr. Jennings and Mr. Goldsmith have held onto a genuine sense of childlike wonder, which works as a nice corrective to what might otherwise come across as an overabundance of hip. Artless, casually knowing and deeply goofy, the first "Hitchhiker" book may have been hip at one time, but what stands out today is just how much Adams seemed to have been enjoying himself. (It is a condition of hip  never to admit to be having a good time.) The novel is zany, but its humor is remarkably unstrained and, for the most part, the same goes for the movie. "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," the name of the travel book Ford lends Arthur and which furnishes loads of practical information about the universe, has on its cover the legend "Don't panic." Mr. Jennings seems to have absorbed this sound advice. His filmmaking style is unrushed and - for a film stuffed with special effects - not overly busy, notwithstanding the Japanese schoolgirl with five torsos and one pair of knee-socked legs. The hydra-headed schoolgirl pops up on a foggy planet, where Arthur, Ford and two other space travelers -  an easygoing Earth girl with the moniker Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (a sensational Sam Rockwell, riffing on Elvis and the current President Bush)  -  drop by for an atmospheric visit. This brief sojourn, which builds on a bit lifted from the second "Hitchhiker" book, doesn't really serve the plot, which is a relief, given that plot isn't the point. (The point of this particular episode is a patently freaky turn by John Malkovich.) The screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick, who shares credit with Adams, has written that the novelist admitted that his first book is a story with "a long beginning and then an ending." The same is more or less true of the movie. This narrative bagginess is partly what makes the film feel true to Adams, if not in precise letter then certainly in mellow spirit. One of the pleasures of this loopy adventure - along with its gloriously singing dolphins and knit puppets - is that what keeps the story in gear are the moments when its four space trekkers - and Marvin, the depressed robot mellifluously voiced by Alan Rickman - are chattering about all manner of cheery nonsense. In the years since "Blade Runner" cast its long dark shadow, most science-fiction cinema has set a course for dystopia. When he blew up the planet in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," Douglas Adams knew that despite everything, there were a few things about human beings worth keeping - friendship, laughter and, of course, those exceedingly useful opposable thumbs. "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has gentle scares, fantastical monsters and some zap gun action.

Whimsical, low-tech and doggedly British in tone despite Tinseltown touches, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" reps the long-planned movie version of scribe Douglas Adams' cult story of interstellar hitchhikers. Inheriting baggy source material, talky pic remains more smile-inducing than laugh-aloud funny and has pacing and coherence problems. Thankfully, strong visuals and sight gags punch up the package, and high public awareness of the brand name should ensure a robust opening in Blighty and other Commonwealth countries. Stateside, however, pic will need to thumb a ride on upbeat word of mouth to catch on theatrically. Home format afterlife looks heavenly.
 Having been a radio show, a 1981 TV series, and several bestselling novels, Adams' epic is an established property with an intense following among those who appreciate its unique combo of "Monty Python"-style silliness, self-mocking satire of Brit manners, and Sci-Fi for Beginners that goes whizzing off in all directions.
Its core narrative is not so much a shaggy dog story as it is a litter of straggly-maned pups. Script credited to Adams, who died in 2001 at age 49, and Karey Kirkpatrick ("Chicken Run") deserves kudos for adept wrangling of the first novel's fitful plot and many digressions into a semi-lucid storyline that's largely faithful to original's spirit.
In contempo rural England, morose hero Arthur Dent (a well-cast Martin Freeman, from the original U.K. "The Office") is awoken one morning by bulldozers about to destroy his house for a freeway bypass. However, his best friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), reveals more shocking news: First, that he, Prefect, is actually an alien from outer space, and second, that Earth is about to be destroyed by the Vogons, a race of repulsive bureaucratic aliens (marvelous-looking leathery puppets designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop), who are making way for a hyperspace bypass.
Prefect's real job is as a researcher for the universal bestseller "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." This is a sort of souped-up Tablet computer/encyclopedia, whose entries and stories are unspooled as stylized, 2-D animations throughout with clipped accompanying voiceover by Brit thesp Stephen Fry.
Using the Guide and a special hitchhiker's ring, Prefect and Dent stow away aboard a Vogon ship seconds before Earth goes kerblooey. They then escape Vogon torture-by-poetry by hitching another ride on the Heart of Gold, a passing space vessel manned by Prefect's cousin, the galaxy's smarmy but charming two-headed, three-armed president, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell).
Also aboard the Heart of Gold are: Earth girl Trillian, aka Tricia MacMillan (Zooey Deschanel), whom Dent had once fallen in love with at a London party just before Beeblebrox whisked her off; and Marvin the Paranoid Android (diminutive Warwick Davis in robot suit, voice by Alan Rickman), a lugubrious, mechanical passive-aggressive whose morose line in self-pity reaps some of pic's biggest laughs.
With the characters thus established, the crew goes off adventuring in a rather messy mass of subplots. Some of these will make better sense to fans familiar with the original material, such as the Guide's crucial skit about a supercomputer (voiced by Helen Mirren).
However, fans may not be so pleased with a love-triangle subplot -- between Beeblebrox, Trillian and Dent -- that's been invented for the movie. This was presumably designed to make the nerdy, male-skewed original more appealing to distaff auds. When Trillian is eventually captured by the Vogons, who wrongly believe she's kidnapped Beeblebrox, Dent leads a rescue mission that succeeds because he understands the fine British art of "queuing," aka getting in line.
Seg in which Dent & Co. must fill out a Vogon form in triplicate and return repeatedly to the hatch of a bored female Vogon pen-pusher to secure a repeal of Trillian's death sentence encapsulates pic's offbeat Brit humor at its best. Here, the universe is imagined as a kind of vast equivalent of Blighty -- or, rather, the country as it thought of itself in the late '70s-early '80s. Though the place is riddled by bureaucracy, inefficiency, and a service culture that doesn't quite work, politeness is still maintained, even by a voicemail message that informs the caller, "Your death may be monitored for training purposes."
However, in pic's midsection, the pace becomes somewhat sluggish due to an overload of asides from the Guide -- pure Adams material that will please fans but which sounds less funny onscreen than on the printed page. In an effort to up the laugh count, first-time feature helmer Garth Jennings inserts some cute slapstick biz.
Surfaces of sets and costumes are so intricately tricked out that they almost distract from comprehension of what's going on, as in a cameo appearance by a digitally-enhanced John Malkovich as a half-man, half-mechanical preacher alien (another of the script's inventions).
Nor does it help that some of the cast, particularly Def and Deschanel as Prefect and Trillian, look lost in space without direction, and phone in underwhelming perfs. Still, Rockwell's manic gurning as Beeblebrox, and the smattering of veteran Brit thesps in minor roles (particularly Bill Nighy as a planet designer specializing in fjords), makes up for some of the shortfall.
Decision to go more for lower-budget special effects, favoring puppets and plasticine instead of CGI, pays dividends, adding a nostalgic, old-school feel that harks back to the original, on-the-cheap TV series, as well as to vintage "Dr. Who." Relatively small amount of CGI is used with precision -- to create Beeblebrox's second head or vast, thoughtfully designed sets.
Other tech credits hold their own, although sound was initially muddy at screening caught.

Radical atheist and devout science geek Douglas Adams  died of a heart attack at the ridiculously early age of 49 in May 2001. He thus missed ringside seats at the advent of blockbuster Islamofascism and the modern Crusades, born-again science junking, the passions of the Wojtyla and the Schiavothe most infuriatingly inspirational epoch imaginable for the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , a tour of the cosmos wherein God "vanishes in a puff of logic" during chapter 6. A BBC  radio play turned novel and television series, H2G2  celebrates the felicities of chance and mutation, confronting the mysteries of Life, the Universe, and Everything with discursive absurdism, improvisatory castle building, and off-the-cuff erudition that suggests Monty Python  hijacking the Starship Enterprise , ardent base of former and actual fanboys included.
Studiously harmless, Disney 's long-in-development film rendition pasteurizes the book's renegade verve with typical means: special effects and gooey romance. (Adams had recently completed a second draft of the screenplay at the time of his death.) Pinballing around the universe with rumpled Englishman Arthur Dent  (Martin Freeman , a/k/a Tim from The Office ), the movie is amiable and eager to please, but its puppyish energies still rack up Hollywood  overkill. (Just take the overture, which turns on a quintessentially Adams-esque joke about the generous intelligence of dolphins, and then clubs the punchline to death with an aggro-operetta theme song.) Befuddled in his bathrobe, last surviving Earth man Arthur is raptured off his home planet by best pal Ford Prefect (Mos Def ) just before the galactic planning council vaporizes Earth with a whumpf . Their titular trusty handbook updated to Macromedia Flash, they hitch a ride aboard the Heart of Gold  spaceship with Arthur's female counterpart, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel ), and galaxy president Zaphod Beeblebrox  (Sam Rockwell ), a dim yet groovy playboy with a surfer dude's cadences, a Texas oilman's charm, and a retractable, id-like second noggin where his neck should be. His auxiliary brain's Tourette's-strength outbursts wear out their welcome almost immediately, so it's a relief when cult leader Humma Kavula (John Malkovich ) takes the head hostage.
Befitting an adventure largely propelled by a mechanism called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which can and does turn a nuclear missile into a bowl of petunias, H2G2  proceeds like a hit-or-miss series of interconnected Python-style skits. But Hollywood is always a stickler for the narrative arc and here pours on the treacle-thick glue of the thwarted love interest, though Arthur's sad-sack pinings for Trillian are altogether less compelling than his galaxy quest for a nice cup of tea. (The end point of his search, in fact, earns the deepest laugh.) The hallucinogenic random variable is the film's best friend, as when Arthur finds opportunity to deadpan, "Ford, I think I'm a sofa," or the whole crew transforms into stop-motion yarn creatures, occasioning a strangely beautiful flourish of yarn vomit.
Though their performances are inevitably drowned out by the flurry of incident and CGI, Def and Rockwell both prove themselves splendid physical comics, wittily embodying straight-A students of earthling behavior, whether Ford is giving freaked-out Arthur an overdetermined pat on the shoulder or Zaphod is mechanically flashing his tickled-ivories smile. The latter vagabond is cut from Dubyan cloth, dispensing glib apologia such as "You can't be president with a whole brain" and "I'm president of the galaxy; I don't get a lot of time for reading." Unfortunately, despite its merrily subversive pedigree, that's as audacious as the movie gets: daring to depict the leader of the known universe as a big dumb jerk.
