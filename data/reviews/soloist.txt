With all the hallmarks of a prestige picture, chief among them a great cast and creative crew and an �important� message, The Soloist
 plays its tune with a frequently heavy hand. Director Wright, who scored such great success with the British costumers Pride & Prejudice
 and Atonement
, seems on less sure footing in his first American feature. Foxx and Downey Jr. are superlative, as usual (and Keener is thoroughly wasted, as is too often the case), but the actors� performances take on a shambling quality, as though the actors were lacking a clear through line. Based on a book by Los Angeles Times
 columnist Steve Lopez and adapted for the screen by Erin Brockovich
 screenwriter Susannah Grant, the movie brings to life the journalist�s experiences while befriending a homeless man with schizophrenia who is a Juilliard-trained cellist. Steve Lopez (played by Downey Jr., who is here cast for at least the fourth time in his career as a journalist: Zodiac
;  Natural Born Killers
; and Good Night, and Good Luck
) first happens upon Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx) while trolling for a topic for his column, �Points West.� His discovery of this semicoherent, colorfully attired street tramp proves a gold mine, which provides a wealth of columns that recount his experiences getting to know Ayers while trying to provide him with help and friendship. This is the more likable aspect of the movie�s progression. The film exposes the dual-edged sword of good intentions as it shows the obstacles people experience while trying to remain honest and honorable in their dealings with the minions of the street, both sane and insane. What begins as an unequal relationship, perhaps even exploitative, takes on more dimensions as Lopez finds his desire to do good becoming overwhelmed by his fear of total responsibility for and possible harm by the unpredictable Ayers. That�s the kind of nuanced relationship that can thrive onscreen, and Downey Jr. is the right actor to deliver that blend of cocksureness and intellectual turmoil. Would that Wright trusted his actors to do more of the film�s heavy lifting. Instead, he literalizes a great deal of Ayers� dementia in ways that add nothing substantial to our understanding of his plight and that seem to be simply the filmmaker�s frills. Cutaways to scenes of Ayers� childhood and Juilliard years seem like interruptions in the storyline and reveal few insights. Worse is the abstract sequence in which we get to see the amoebic light show that is Ayers� mind when he listens to music. (Implicit warning: There but for a tab of acid go you and I.) The Soloist
 should be appreciated for hewing to the truth in its reluctance to sign off with a conventionally happy ending, even if it does so with a pointed message about the problem of homelessness in America. In the end, The Soloist
 can take a bow for its effort but shouldn�t be expecting any encores.

In "The Soloist," Jamie Foxx lets his hair go nappy and swaddles himself in layers of filthy cast-off clothing as Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless and mentally ill Los Angeles street musician. Avoiding eye contact, Nathaniel chatters on in paranoid schizophrenic arias of dysfunctional connection, and you can practically smell the self-righteous Hollywood funk rising off the character.

It's director Joe Wright, though, who brings that funk more than Foxx or Robert Downey Jr., playing the real-life LA Times columnist who befriends Nathaniel and tries to help him. If you've seen the trailer for "The Soloist"  - and you probably have, since the film was originally slated for release during last year's Oscar season only to be pulled at the last minute  - you may be expecting an inspirational tale in the vein of "Shine," another film about a lost artist who gets his groove back. And you may be expecting the sort of self-congratulatory star gambit wickedly exposed by Downey's monologue last year in "Tropic Thunder," about actors who shoot for awards-season glory by going "the full retard."

Things swiftly sort themselves out, however. Seasoned pros that they are, Foxx and Downey attend to their charac ters and leave the overreaching to Wright. Foxx in particular understands that since Nathaniel can barely deal with the other people in the movie, he can't possibly play to the audience in the seats. It turns out that "The Soloist" isn't so much a story of perseverance and musical triumph as it is of despair, acceptance, and social commitment. The movie's a call to arms: We are our brothers' keepers, it says, and our brothers are in terrible shape.

Nathaniel attended Juilliard, which right there spells a story for Downey's Steve Lopez, banged up from a recent bike accident and himself isolated from his fellow man (and fictional ex-wife, editor Catherine Keener). The movie hints that one of the reasons the nation's newspapers are in such a fix is that they pursue gimmicky human-interest journalism instead of the underlying issues of poverty and societal neglect; it chides us for wanting the feel-good movie the trailer promised us. (I still say it's the Internet.)

So Lopez's initial story results in a reader donating a cello  - a trained double bassist, Ayers has been getting by on a violin with two strings  - and both the journalist and we sit back, content that genius will reestablish itself. "The Soloist" has more on its mind, though. The script by Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") sees Ayers, problematically, as a wild animal lost in the city, terrified and incapable of acting in his own interests. Lopez and a well-meaning Philharmonic cellist (Tom Hollander) arrange a concert; it doesn't go well. An apartment is rented; Ayers peeps in at the door like a coyote asked to come inside. Just to sock the metaphor home, the film has Lopez's own home under assault from raccoons, and mines comedy from the bags of coyote urine he hangs around his yard.
Following the bread crumbs of his subject's daily wanderings, the columnist comes into contact with the city's vast homeless population and the understaffed, underfunded support structure trying to alleviate its suffering. Lopez has Ayers store the cello at the real-life Los Angeles Men's Project (LAMP) on skid row, and through his dealings with one of the LAMP social workers (Nelsan Ellis) Lopez is tutored in the project's message: Provide the homeless with food and shelter, respect their lives, don't try to medicate their problems out of your guilt. See them as people.

Yet the movie itself sees them as sympathetic monsters. The skid row sequences are filmed like a full-on horror movie  - Fellini doing "Night of the Living Dead"  - and while some of LA's homeless population have been cast as themselves, the filmmaking grinds our faces in their physical afflictions and oogedy-boogedy weirdness. There's a line between forcing us to see the American underclass and exploiting them as freaks, and this movie dances all over it.

The problem is that Joe Wright is an extremely skilled filmmaker who is still getting off on that skill. The self-consciously "difficult" traveling shot of Dunkirk in "Atonement" finds its equivalent here in the epic vision of downtown Los Angeles as a modern Bedlam and in the soaring shots of computer-generated pigeons that take flight with Nathaniel's cello solos. Look! says "The Soloist," in the middle of our wealthy nation is a Third World country! Yet the view is that of a horrified tourist goggling through the windows of a passing bus.

The film's title nudges us that we're all soloists by cautious nature and urges us to join together in the human orchestra, much as "Crash" did and with a similar misguided air of apocalypse. What makes "The Soloist" the better movie is that it focuses on only two characters and lets the men playing them dig deep. Downey may be the only Hollywood actor who could portray the mellowing of Steve Lopez without patting himself on the back; Lopez is much the same smart, funny jerk he was at the beginning but with a larger sense of responsibility.

Neither the screenplay nor Foxx, to his great credit, ever "explains" Nathaniel to us, even during the distressing flashback scenes at Juilliard. Ayers had great talent, he heard voices, no one was there to catch him. The movie, for all its flaws, reminds us that everyone is worth catching, but it's the actors who best embody that message. They go the full human being.



On paper, The Soloist  sounds like a classic softhearted middlebrow awards-bait movie. Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) is a homeless schizophrenic on the streets of Los Angeles whose outward dementia  mismatched clothing topped by full sequined jacket; hair plastered down on either side; a mode of ''talk'' that's really a jumble of word salad  conceals a delicate, refined soul obsessed with the beauty of music. Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times  who meets Nathaniel on the street and learns, after a bit of investigating, that he was once a budding cello virtuoso at  Juilliard. He writes a column about him, and as Nathaniel starts to gain a bit of notoriety, the two men redeem each other. Or not.
The Soloist  is based on a true story, but it takes pains not to sweeten the facts. And so the film, directed by Joe Wright (Atonement ), draws us in without offering the expected ''inspirational'' catharsis. It's all a bit shapeless, yet made with sincerity and taste, and the two actors seize your sympathy. Downey plays Lopez with a missionary zeal but never sanctifies him, and Foxx gives a lyrical performance as a man so trapped in a whirlpool of feeling (there's a hint that the inner voices he conjures up are racial demons) that he can't connect with anything but Beethoven. His madness has removed all impediments to bliss, and Foxx is such a good actor you can just about hear the music in his head.

 Some of the lost souls in “The Soloist,” a big studio movie about a one-man rescue mission, look as thin as the crack pipes clamped between their lips. These are a few of the ghosts who haunt Los Angeles, that Mecca of Fabulousness where you can go for weeks (and invariably by car) without smelling the reek of other people’s desperation. That helps explain why Hollywood types tend not to set their camera sights on homeless men, women and children, unless they’re good for a little uplift (as in the Will Smith vehicle “The Pursuit of Happyness”). Homeless people are generally, pardon the pun, bummers —they also can’t afford tickets.  Based on a book by the Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez,  “The Soloist” recounts what happened when one of the city’s more privileged denizens  (Robert Downey Jr. as the newsman) met one of its least fortunate (Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers). A Juilliard dropout, Mr. Ayers ended up on the streets, where he pushed a shopping cart filled with trash and bedded down next to rats. This isn’t a milieu in which you might expect to find the British director Joe Wright, last seen exploring class and other catastrophes in “Atonement.” Yet he fits fine with “The Soloist,” perhaps because he brings an outsider’s perspective to the material or is just accustomed to navigating the divide between the haves and have-nots.  Polished to a high gleam by Mr. Wright and written by Susannah Grant (whose credits include “In Her Shoes”), the film is imperfect, periodically if unsurprisingly sentimental, overly tidy and often very moving. It works hard to make you feel good, as is to be expected, even as it maintains a strong sense of moral indignation that comes close to an assertion of real politics. Outrage would be too much for a mainstream entertainment like this one to manage. Like its muckraking journalist guide, it exploits its subjects for its own purposes.  But its commitment to the material feels honest, nowhere more so than in Mr. Downey’s darkly shaded, nuanced performance, one that deepens this film with its insistence on the fundamental mysteries of human character.  It’s no surprise when  Lopez, taking a break from the newsroom roar, stops to listen to a disheveled man playing a two-stringed violin. In journalistic fashion, wonderment morphs into curiosity and then dogged pursuit as he quickly grasps that he’s discovered the makings of a great story. Although Lopez cooks up a column soon after they meet, the full account of how Ayers went from a happy childhood in Cleveland to bright promise in New York and then to his Los Angeles hell emerges through seamlessly interspersed, economical flashbacks. Lightly tinted, as is often customary in movies that return to the past (it’s as if happy childhoods were bathed in honey), the flashbacks are pieces of a puzzle that Lopez becomes increasingly hesitant to solve.  It is, he discovers, difficult to deal with people in pain. Although they meet cute in the shadow of a looming statue of Beethoven (dedicated to the founder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra),  the journalist and his story don’t settle into predictability, largely because Ayers is intrinsically volatile. Given to verbose bursts and abrupt silences, he doesn’t so much talk to Lopez (he doesn’t always make eye contact either) as just talk and talk, the words pouring out like water until something (rage? fear? chemistry?) stops the flow. Mr. Foxx often seems uncomfortable in his role, wavering between pathos and something harder and truer, but his scatlike delivery of some of Ayers’s twisting ropes of words can be mesmerizing.  In Los Angeles homeless people are more likely to get sunburns than die freezing in the streets. Because of the city’s sprawl and dependence on automobiles, they also tend to be less visible than they are in more geographically compressed urban areas like Manhattan. In 2005, the year Mr. Lopez wrote his first column about Mr. Ayers, an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 were living in a 50-block skid row downtown, not far from the Los Angeles Times building, City Hall and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry-designed music center that sits on a hill like an enormous silvery flower far from the reach of the Nathaniel Ayerses of this world.  Over the course of “The Soloist,” Lopez helps Ayers reconnect with his music and, in tentative fashion, a more dignified way of living in the world. There are triumphs and setbacks, but these arrive fairly quietly, with none of the 101 weeping strings that often come with stories as emotionally fraught as this one (though Beethoven does shake the speakers).  Helping someone off the streets is no small thing, but the story of one man is just that: the story of a single individual, a point that Mr. Wright underscores repeatedly. Again and again the film plunges into the streets, diving into a brackish humanity only to then drift amid the lost and forgotten. In the restrained voice-over that wends through the film, Lopez gives witness to what he has seen.  “The Soloist” wouldn’t work half as well without Mr. Downey’s astringent, bristly take on a man whose best intentions eventually collide with difficult truths. The actor is a wonder,  but he has solid support from Catherine Keener as Lopez’s former wife and editor and Nelsan Ellis as a counselor working in the skid row trenches. Both characters exist mostly to push back at Lopez: they wag an occasional finger and dole out tough love and advice. Mr. Wright might be tempted to indulge in lofty symbolism (there are some unfortunately high-flying pigeons), but these three actors, along with the homeless people who worked as extras, help keep him tethered closer to the ground. It’s amazing what you can see when you get out of your car and walk: other people, for starters.  “The Soloist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There’s nothing here that a 13-year-old hasn’t heard.

Neither rarefied art film nor widely accessible inspirational drama, "The Soloist" falls between the cracks both creatively and commercially. Based on the real case of a newspaperman finding a former musical prodigy homeless on the streets of Los Angeles, Brit director Joe Wright's first American feature has moments of power and imagination, but the overworked style and heavy socially conscious bent exude an off-putting sense of self-importance, making for a picture that's more of a chore than a pleasure to sit through. Delayed from an original late 2008 release to an April 24 opening, this DreamWorks/Universal co-production, released Stateside by Paramount, will ride a short time on the names of co-stars Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr., but is an unlikely bet to stir up significant B.O.
Charismatic and dynamic as they've been on any number of previous occasions, both Foxx and Downey seem to labor here as they grapple with roles viewers will find difficulty warming to. Downey, in particular, fails to find either outer charm or inner soul in Steve Lopez, the real-life Los Angeles Times columnist whose book (and prior columns) served as the basis for Susannah Grant's ambitious but short-falling screenplay. Ever distracted and preoccupied over his next deadline, the screen version of Lopez provides little in the way of a portal through which to view the outside world, and what's going on in his mind remains a mystery across two hours; crucially, given the melodious bombardment to come, we don't even know what he thinks of classical music.
Always choosing to over-elaborate rather than to simplify, the pic gratuitously opens on Lopez getting half his face grated by concrete in a bicycle accident, the better that he should look like a street guy himself when he encounters Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx) near the Times offices downtown. A motormouthed fellow in funny clothes whose stream-of-consciousness commentaries are sometimes coherent and sometimes not, Ayers would seem like someone to steer clear of but for the fact that he produces wondrous sounds from a two-stringed violin.
Lopez learns his discovery once studied at Juilliard and was a precocious cellist rather than a fiddler, while flashbacks reveal a budding teenage virtuoso whose adoring mother advises him that, "There is a whole world waiting for you." Lopez gets a good column out of it -- so good, in fact, that a reader is inspired to send along an unused cello, which Lopez duly presents to Ayers virtually in the shadow of Disney Hall.
Pic's overwrought nature is best exemplified by the scene in which the bereft man takes bow to cello for the first time in years. Ayers' pure, simple notes are soon accompanied on the soundtrack by a full orchestra in booming accompaniment, along with noble birds soaring above Los Angeles onscreen.
Unfortunately, what should at this point become a full-bodied story digresses and devolves into something closer to a case study. While hints of his incipient mental problems are divulged in flashbacks, a reluctant Ayers is dragged by Lopez to a skid-row shelter that's always surrounded by junkies, crazies and surlies. Lopez further arranges for cello lessons (with the principal cellist of the Los Angeles Symphony, no less), as well as an apartment where his uncertain cohort can practice and an entree to an L.A. Phil rehearsal that provokes in Ayers a photo-chemical reaction, resulting in his own private version of the Star Gate sequence in "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Relations between the two men fray as Ayers' resentment at being a charity case erupts into outright rebellion against his enabler, who himself decides he's had enough. At the same time, the pic strays precariously close to becoming a semi-documentary about the rehab center, reaching its embarrassing nadir when it shows a beaming Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (Marcos De Silvas) promising a ton of city money to the facility.
More agreeably, Esa Pekka-Salonen is fleetingly seen conducting at Disney Hall, which gets an impressive, if brief, bigscreen outing. Although partly shot in Cleveland (which scenes it's hard to tell), the action never leaves downtown Los Angeles. As in the recent "Crossing Over," overhead shots looking down at the city's concrete arteries crank up the portentous omniscience.
With an utterly different sort of character, Foxx, like Downey, seems locked in a box by Ayers; the actor capably catches all the outward manifestations of the genuinely debilitating mental illness that has thwarted a potentially brilliant musical career, but neither he nor the script offers anything beyond that to lend the man full dimension. The latent tragic resonance of art both achieved and lost has been sacrificed at the altar of prosaic, politically correct news reporting about the plight of the homeless, a choice underlined by end-credits statistics about the number of street people in Los Angeles.
At individual moments, Wright's direction has snap and precision, but the big-picture focus seems bifurcated and, ultimately, uncertain. Seamus McGarvey's widescreen lensing is bold and clear, while music and sound elements are ear-filling.


An old-fashioned tale for a new-fangled world, Joe Wright 's overwrought drama turns on a series of columns begun in 2005 by Los Angeles Times  reporter Steve Lopez , an old-school vox populi whose writing about his friendship with Nathaniel Ayers , a musically gifted, schizophrenic homeless black man on the city's Skid Row, drew an outpouring of reader sympathy. Wright, who brought us the ghosts of upper-crust England past with Pride & Prejudice  and Atonement , seems an odd choice to direct a movie set in the Other Los Angeles, and he vulgarizes Lopez's intelligent populism. Using local non-pro actors, he pumps up Lopez's laconically described Skid Row into a Ken Russell  hellhole of social outcasts, a florid backdrop for Lopez's steep learning curve about the man he wants to save from himself. Screenwriter Susannah Grant  has turned the happily married Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.)  into a barely socialized basketcase divorced from his wife and boss (Catherine Keener ). Stalwartly resisting the overkill, Downey delivers his lines in a flat mumble that's astutely complemented by Jamie Foxx , whose beautifully modulated performance as Nathaniel catches the way people with psychotic illnesses slip in and out of rationality. Foxx and Downey's disciplined duet come close to redeeming The Soloist  from its visual excesses, but Wright leaves us with a parting shot of the dancing homeless that shamelessly exploits the very people he means to champion.
