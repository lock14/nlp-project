How does an actor tap his inner psycho baddie? The novel answer this year is: by disguising himself as an ugly bald man. Tom Cruise got his freak on by playing the corrupt studio boss of Tropic Thunder  as a repulsive chrome-dome nerd, and now the wily Tom Wilkinson  so brilliant as the lawyer who went out of his gourd with guilt in Michael Clayton   goes bald, pudgy, and horn-rimmed as a gnashing cockney mob boss in Guy Ritchie's decadently entertaining RocknRolla . For these actors, grotty makeup is liberation  the freedom to hurl themselves into disgusting behavior. As Lenny Cole, a gangster who rules the thriving real estate market in London by bribing politicians, and muscling them, too (whatever it takes to send his deals flying through the bureaucracy), Wilkinson spews his lines with the frothing relish of an angrier Michael Caine. He's the rare actor who can telegraph joie de vivre while lowering his enemies into a pool of hungry crawfish.
The thing is, Lenny isn't even the film's heart of darkness. Early on, he brokers a deal with a dead-eyed Russian billionaire (Karel Roden), and it's the Russian  a monster of global capitalism  who represents anarchy; Lenny, by contrast, is a brute with a code. Up till now, I've more or less hated Guy Ritchie's piston-pumping music-video approach to crime. His thrillers, like Snatch  and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , are so laminated in blood and poses and stylistic frosting that they're not hip, they're numb. But Ritchie, in RocknRolla , dials down the Kewl Ultraviolence and finds the discipline to tell a good story.
As a hood who works for Lenny (and fearlessly rips him off), Gerard Butler, from 300 , uses his burly, earthy gruffness to ground the film, and he's surrounded by terrific actors like Thandie Newton, cold as dry ice as a mob accountant, and Tony Kebbell, who plays a junkie rock star with feral energy and the hungriest of eyes. Ritchie cribs shamelessly from GoodFellas  and Tarantino, but he also riffs on gangster homophobia, the mechanisms of urban sprawl, and the evil ways of addiction. He concocts a crime-jungle demimonde that's organically linked to the real world, and it's a damn fun one to visit.

 Guy Ritchie reshuffles a worn-out deck in “RocknRolla,” a return to the shady stylings that characterized his earlier flicks “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch.” The on-screen names have changed, and the edited rhythms have been somewhat slowed, but more or less everything else follows formula: pump up the volume, tilt the camera, flex the muscle, strut the stuff, bang bang, blah blah.  There are the usual villains with funny names — a nice-and-easy Gerard Butler plays One Two, while the underdeployed Idris Elba plays his partner in London crime, Mumbles — committing the usual villainy while spouting the usual argot. There’s the big, bad boss, Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), a thug in bespoke pinstripes who comes with an iron fist in a velvet glove called Archy (Mark Strong). There are drugs and a rock ’n’ roll druggie, Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell). There’s the requisite femme fatale in stilettos, Stella (Thandie Newton), and the de rigueur scary, scarily rich Russian, Uri (Karel Roden). There are double-crosses and right hooks and ha-ha scenes of grim torture that come with throbbing musical accompaniment.  It isn’t all bad — many of the lads look lovely, and there’s a chase sequence that nicely devolves into an impressionistic blur of herky-jerky faces — but there isn’t much to chew on or mull over. The violence is idiotic and brutal (the story is just idiotic), but it’s also so noncommittal  that it doesn’t offend. Like the filmmaking itself, the violence has no passion, no oomph, no sense of real or even feigned purpose. For Mr. Ritchie, a man who clearly appreciates fine tailoring (and kudos to the costume designer, Suzie Harman), a fist in the mouth or a bullet in the head is just a stylistic flourish, some flash to tart up the genre clichés he never seems to have bought in the first place.  But that’s the thing about genre clichés: you need to believe in them before you can twist, upend or abandon them. To judge from his crime flicks, Mr. Ritchie seems to have gravitated to the underworld primarily because of some misbegotten and vague sense of cool. The history of real and imaginary British crime certainly gives him fodder, including the real East End criminals the Kray twins (who were put out of nasty business in 1968,  the year Mr. Ritchie was born)   and the nattily dressed, lethally armed Michael Caine in Mike Hodges’s vicious “Get Carter” (1971). American criminals have the bigger guns, but the Brits lock and load like dandies, a fact that, more than any other, seems to have shaped Mr. Ritchie’s oeuvre.  “RocknRolla” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloody gun violence and crustacean-involved torture.

After shipwrecking with "Swept Away" and misfiring with "Revolver," Brit filmmaker Guy Ritchie bounces back to top form with "RocknRolla," a cleverly constructed, sensationally stylish and often darkly hilarious seriocomic caper. Marginally more restrained than his attention-grabbing breakthrough efforts -- "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" -- his new pic proves just as aggressively exciting while zigzagging through an intricate maze of plots and counterplots, dirty deals and double-crosses. Commercial prospects are generally bright in all media, although thick accents and unfamiliar slanguage employed by the predominantly Brit cast may impede pic's appeal to mainstream U.S. ticketbuyers.
Gerard Butler emerges as first among equals in an impressive ensemble cast as One Two, a small-time hustler hoping to become a big-time entrepreneur by entering the booming London real-estate market.
Along with partners-in-crime Mumbles (Idris Elba of TV's "The Wire") and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy), One Two attempts a bit of property speculation with a loan from Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), an influence-peddling, bureaucrat-bribing crime boss who knows where all the bodies are buried (largely because he buried many of them himself). Cole duly pulls the right strings -- but only so he can stealthily lasso the property for himself and still demand repayment from One Two.
Not surprisingly for a Ritchie pic, the deception sets off an interlocking chain of contrivances, coincidences, intricate plans and desperate improvisations. To repay Cole, One Two and his crew sign on as heisters for Stella (Thandie Newton), a curvaceous and very crooked accountant working for criminally inclined Russian billionaire Uri Obamavich (Karel Roden).
The busy plot grows exponentially more complex each time writer-helmer Ritchie drops another colorful character into the mix. Among the more significant complicating factors: Archy (Mark Strong), Lenny's resolutely loyal and fiercely unforgiving right-hand man; Roman (Jeremy Piven) and Mickey (Chris "Ludacris" Bridges), American rock promoters who are inadvertently involved with the hunt for a stolen painting; and Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), a spectacularly wasted punk rocker who's the black-sheep stepson of -- yes, you guessed it -- Lenny Cole.
"RocknRolla" barrels along at a brisk clip that's never noticeably decelerated by the occasional inclusion of flashbacks and flash-forwards. In a pic chockfull of kinetic set pieces, it's almost unfair to single out individual sequences. But it's safe to say that auds may get giddy watching a robbery that begins with a purposeful collision of car and truck, continues with a frenzied battle involving golf clubs and automatic weaponry, and climaxes with an audaciously extended foot chase. Through it all, Ritchie steadily ratchets up the thriller-diller quotient by suggesting two Russian thugs (who resemble refugees from "Eastern Promises") are, quite literally, unkillable.
Pic frequently borders on the cartoonish -- or, during the rapid-fire opening-credits sequence, the graphic-novelish -- but also offers touches of cheeky drollery. (Note the smooth moves and scene thievery of Nonso Anozie as a soft-spoken, plus-size underworld type fond of Whistler paintings and Merchant-Ivory movies.) Final wrap-up isn't exactly airtight, but the entwining of the various plot threads is genuinely amusing.
Thesps across the board are well cast and, more important, well attuned to Ritchie's style of carefully calibrated exaggeration. (Kebbell is particularly adept at handling the writer-helmer's trademark sardonic monologues.) Standout tech values include gritty-glossy high-def lensing by David Higgs and razor-sharp editing by James Herbert.


What do you have to do to get your career revoked in England, short of being Gary Glitter ? After a box-office-catastrophic two-movie run, Guy Ritchie  takes another mulligan and returns to "form"—though his tics and tricks have never added up to more than cockney-accented novelty mixed with 2 Days in the Valley  dross. A new pack of capering yobs (some guy from 300 , Ludacris ), including a Pete Doherty –esque crackhead savant, run off with one another's loot, their various storylines cut together and the scenes temporally shuffled with enough sleight-of-editing to keep up a semblance of kineticism. Brick-shithouse-built rough boys are given "unexpected colors" (something that, in productions of this nature, is entirely to be expected), such as a taste for Merchant-Ivory  films. Digressive soliloquies casually linger on such ephemera as American crayfish and the semiotics of a pack of cigarettes, belying looming violence. Why should a movie so titled have one of the most indifferent soundtracks in recent memory? Because Ritchie is a pop tart at heart (see: wife), for whom "rock 'n' roll" has nothing to do with the weight of riffage, and everything to do with dandyish tailoring and pub-belligerent 'tude. Sum total of scenes that deserved to stay in the final cut: Thandie Newton  doing a little shimmying frug.
