Laurence Sterne's bawdy, untamable, altogether astonishing 18th-century novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy , Gentleman  stands proud on the shelf of great books famous for being owned wisely but not read too much. Posited as the fictional autobiography of an eccentric English gent, the book is a cavalcade of digressions, narrative fractures, and formal messing-about that predates (and outdazzles) postmodern literary gamesmanship by centuries and miles. It is, safe to say, unfilmable. And yet here it is, filmed to perfection by Michael Winterbottom as Tristram Shandy: A Cock & Bull Story   the first great, mind-tickling treat of the new movie year.
But, as the carnival barker promises, that's not all! In a fit of irresistible playfulness, the filmmaker operates at a level of addictive challenge known to Sudoku puzzle players as ''diabolical.'' Working off a wonderfully sparkling screenplay, Winterbottom creates a narrative not only about the loquacious Tristram Shandy (Steve Coogan), who tells the story of his own birth and odd family, but also about the making of the very movie we are watching. Coogan (a brilliant Brit comedian known in the U.S.  as that actor from Coffee and Cigarettes , but a certified comic genius and celebrity at home, forever identified with his shallow fictional chat-show alter ego Alan Partridge) plays actor Steve Coogan, a certified comic genius and celebrity, etc. The fictional star is as vain, shallow, pompous, and distractable a showbiz fellow off camera as his Tristram is in waistcoat and wig; for him, a half-inch height advantage, built into his shoes, is crucial to his notion of character development.
This Steve Coogan ignores his gentle girlfriend (Kelly Macdonald) and their infant son who visit him on location, argues with the director (Jeremy Northam) and screenwriter (Ian Hart), and competes childishly with his costar Rob Brydon (hilarious fellow comedian Rob Brydon), who plays the role of Tristram's Uncle Toby. His character has, it's safe to say, never bothered to read the book on which his movie is based.
This Steve Coogan is a petty man who represents the movie biz at its most risible, an industry type ripe for parody; he's also a marvelous  indeed deeply apt  incarnation of everything Sterne's fictional hero embodies, all appetites, insecurities, and vigors.
The movie-within-a-movie conceit isn't new, and neither is the parodic notion of the movie-about-the-business-of-making-movies. But rarely has such meta-ness been put to such deep and insightful literary use, or handled with such heart. A knowing chronicle of cock and bull in all its forms and charms, the movie swings with inventive pleasures, the work of a protean filmmaker who thrives on experimentation (9 Songs , In This World , 24 Hour Party People , Welcome to Sarajevo   no Winterbottom project is like any other). Eventually, Gillian Anderson shows up as Gillian Anderson, cast last minute for a romantic subplot. A real New York Times  reporter on set to interview Winterbottom about 9 Songs  gets cast as a NYT  reporter. And the prospect of reading Laurence Sterne beckons as a reward  the very opposite of homework.

 "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman," a staple of college English Literature surveys, is so widely believed to be unfilmable that you can almost imagine that when Laurence Sterne wrote it in the middle of the 18th century, one of his intentions was to flummox future cinéastes enamored of wigs, breeches and quill pens. This may not be as farfetched as it sounds, since there is something uncannily ahead of its time about Sterne's novel. In Michael Winterbottom's "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" — not a movie version of the book but rather a movie about a movie about the book — one of the characters describes the original as "a masterwork of postmodernism before there was any modernism to be post."  An irritatingly glib description, to be sure — all the more so since the character in question has not read the book — but not altogether inaccurate. The 600-odd (sometimes very odd) pages of "Tristram Shandy" abound in digressions, chronological displacements and self-referential stunts, all of which seem to prophesy later innovations in novel-writing, as well as guaranteeing failure for even the most imaginatively resourceful filmmaker.  Which might be an apt way to characterize Mr. Winterbottom, who is apparently capable of anything except repeating himself. Since the decade began, he has veered from Thomas Hardy ("The Claim") to hard-core pornography ("9 Songs") and from quasidocumentary realism ("In This World") to dystopian science fiction ("Code 46"). His wily, tongue-in-cheek "Tristram Shandy," far from refuting the idea that the novel could never be adapted for the screen, proves it in the most ingenious and entertaining manner.  This is not just a movie-within-a-movie, but a movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie, something that sounds unbearably arch but that is swift, funny and surprisingly unpretentious. At a stately English manor house, a motley, harried crew is grappling both with the intricacies of their ill-chosen literary source and with the hourly chaos of setting up shots, adjusting makeup and costumes and managing egos.  The largest of these belongs to Steve Coogan, the onetime British television star who also appeared in Mr. Winterbottom's "24 Hour Party People." Mr. Coogan plays Tristram Shandy; his father, Walter; and most impressively and obnoxiously, himself. That character — let's call him Steve — is vain and insecure, an utterly believable caricature of movie-star self-absorption. His co-star and rival, who plays Tristram's Uncle Toby in the film-within-the-film, is Rob Brydon (Rob Brydon), and there is no matter too petty for them to compete over. Rob is eager to promote himself from sidekick to second lead, and Steve is anxious to protect his dominant position on the marquee. He badgers a costume designer to build up the heels on his buckled shoes so that he will be taller than Rob — not for any selfish reasons, of course, but in the interest of artistic integrity. When he asks for regular coffee and Rob requests "a macchiato," Steve quickly changes his order, though there is no macchiato to be found.  Meanwhile, Steve's girlfriend, Jenny (Kelly Macdonald), has arrived on the set with their infant son, hoping for some intimate conjugal time with her mate. He, however, is distracted by a flirtation with a production assistant, also named Jenny (Naomie Harris), who is apparently the only person in "Tristram Shandy" who has actually read "Tristram Shandy." She also seems to be the only person who knows or cares anything about cinema.  Except, of course, Mr. Winterbottom, who lives, breathes and thinks through his camera. "Tristram Shandy" moves so rapidly and easily along its hectic, tangled course that it seems effortless. Its on-the-fly, pseudodocumentary style owes something to trompe-l'oeil inside-show-business movies and television programs like "Extras," "The Larry Sanders Show," "Day for Night" and "The Player." The feeling of being behind the scenes is captured in hurtling tracking shots and a sound mix that embeds delicious jokes in clipped, offhand snatches of dialogue.  Quite a few reasonably well-known, mostly British actors flutter across the screen, including Shirley Henderson, Gillian Anderson, Ian Hart, Stephen Fry and Jeremy Northam, who stands in for Mr. Winterbottom as the busy, impressively unflappable director. His production must contend not only with the obstinacy of Sterne's book, but also with pushy journalists, financial pressures and a historical consultant whose concern with accuracy verges on the pathological.  In the midst of it all, Mr. Coogan, Mr. Winterbottom and the screenwriter, Martin Hardy, mischievously conspire to shape a dog's breakfast of riffs and gags into a coherent and at times touching story. Steve is an appalling jerk, but it is possible to detect a hint of vulnerability beneath his preening, sarcastic put-upon manner, and also a secret, almost shamefaced desire to prove himself a serious artist and a decent person.  Mr. Winterbottom, meanwhile, has performed a valuable service both to movie audiences and to devotees of classic literature. He has, for one thing, inoculated Sterne's "Tristram Shandy" against the depredations of earnest, prestige-minded adapters, while preserving a lot of the book's insouciant, inventive spirit (and some of its best moments). He has also paid loving, knowing tribute to the crazy enterprise of film-making, a torment to those mad enough to pursue it and a delight, at least in this case, for those of us lucky enough to sit and watch.  "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" is rated R (Under 17 requires parent or adult guardian). Its naughty, bawdy humor is appropriate to both the 18th century and the 21st.
To dream the impossible film: Brit versatilitist Michael Winterbottom  follows his hardcore art-porn 9 Songs  with a strenuously eccentric adaptation of Laurence Sterne 's comic masterpiece of 18th-century postmodernism, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman .
One of the most admired, if least read, works in English literature, Sterne's convoluted satire presents problems that might pretzel-knot Charlie Kaufman 's brain. No book has ever been more about itself. When the critic Viktor Shklovsky  called Tristram Shandy  "the most typical novel in world literature," he meant that in its compulsive digressions, obtrusive narrative voice, and seemingly arbitrary chronological structure, it was the most novelistic of novels.
Winterbottom's Tristram Shandy  references the novel throughout, but it's essentially a movie about making a movie. Indeed, it seems to pick up where 24 Hour Party People  left offa cast of comedians headed by Steve Coogan , rolling back time and regaling the camera. More droll than hilarious, Coogan plays Tristram and his father, as well as "Steve Coogan," the actor who plays them. Rob Brydon  similarly plays himself and Tristram's Uncle Tobyhe of the mysterious groin woundwith Gillian Anderson  as the star imported for the role of the Widow Wadman .
One of the movie's running jokes is the love the actors profess for their unreadable sourceacting! And as in the book, various events are revisited: the hero's accidental circumcision, the conditions of his conception, and most frequently, the circumstances of his birth. Winterbottom uses that crucial scene to introduce the crew and segue into a narrative situationthe birth of his movieconcerning a weekend visit from Steve's girlfriend (Kelly Macdonald ) and their infant baby.
Made literal, many of Sterne's japes cease to be funny, but the viewer is carried along by the backstage plot. Winterbottom's Tristram Shandy  resembles Olivier Assayas 's meta-movie Irma Vep with less at stake. Assayas was making a serious comedy about film history; Winterbottom is demonstrating his own cleverness, although the editing shenanigans that intermittently parallel Sterne's narrative strategies are not that far from the 18th-century "new wave" of Tony Richardson 's manic Tom Jones  .
Sterne continually steers the reader away from the described action to the moment the action is described; Winterbottom, necessarily less rigorous, focuses on the (fictitious) time of its filming. Rushes are viewed, producers soothed, agents contacted, interviews granted, flirtations pursued. Coogan plays himself as narcissistic, vain, and easily bored. Much humor depends on his capacity to maintain his cool under absurd circumstanceslowered upside down and naked into a giant model womb.
The funniest thing in this Tristram Shandy  is Coogan's put-upon sense of noblesse oblige. Why should he shoulder the burden of narrative when he can just be . . . himself? For all the on-set antics, appropriated Fellini music, and throwaway gags, the movie is most successful when Coogan is pulling faces for the mirror, aimlessly trading Pacino imitations with his sidekick Brydon, or riffing on the color of the latter's teeth.
