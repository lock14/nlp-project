Even when he isn't being the dogmatic scold of the Dogville  trilogy, Lars von Trier fashions his cinematic pranks like daggers. In The Boss of It All , though, the blade could use some sharpening. An executive (Peter Gantzler) hires an actor (Jens Albinus) to impersonate his company's (nonexistent) Mr. Big. The actor's inept performance is not only believed  it purges the company's sins. This satire of empty-suit capitalism has scalding moments, but most of it suggests Being There  meets The Office  gibberized into theater of the absurd.

 To describe “The Boss of It All,” Lars von Trier’s acidic corporate comedy, as “ ‘The Office’ Viewed Through the Looking Glass” only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. At the outset Mr. von Trier, shown standing behind a window, disingenuously announces that the movie is “a comedy and harmless as such: no preaching or swaying of opinion.”  Strictly speaking, that may be true, although throughout the movie you sense a diabolical aesthetic anarchist scheming to upend your expectations.  Unlike his recent pseudo-epics,  “Dogville” and “Manderlay,” “The Boss of It All” is not a nose-thumbing critique of American history filtered through a left-wing European perspective by this Danish director and writer. Mr. von Trier’s first film in Danish since “The Idiots,” it is a small, inexpensive movie without marquee names. Its politics, such as they are, remain safely across the Atlantic and have to do with the supposed antipathy between sentimental Danes and chilly Icelanders.  As this layered satire of power and the relationships of bosses and employees, directors and actors unfolds, Mr. von Trier pops up two more times to assert his supremacy as the movie’s Brechtian puppetmaster. Although the characters wonder out loud about the identity of “the boss of all bosses” of a company that is on the verge of being sold, the honcho in chief is really Mr. von Trier gleefully pulling the strings of a story whose tone he manipulates at his whim.  The movie is organized around a structural joke. It uses a new camera technique called Automavision, whose purpose is to limit human control over cinematography. Shots that begin from a fixed camera position are randomly tilted, angled and zoomed by a computer. A character may suddenly disappear from the frame. The technique is a metaphor for the movie’s vision of a corporate culture running amok in its own insane rules.  But the implications are double-edged, for in human terms there is no boss; technology rules. The screenplay is clotted with jargon that makes little sense, and there is no attempt to explain it or to describe what the company produces,  beyond the clear suggestion that it is a high-tech outfit.  The games begin with the hiring of Kristoffer (Jens Albinus), a sour, unemployed actor, by the company’s director, Ravn (Peter Gantzler). Kristoffer’s job is to impersonate Svend, the company’s top executive, who supposedly runs its day-to-day operations from the United States and communicates only via e-mail.  This nonexistent boss was invented by Ravn to deflect  the heat from disgruntled employees onto someone else. But since the company’s prospective buyer, Finnur (Thor Fridriksson), a hard-nosed Icelandic mogul, insists that Svend appear in person to sign the papers, someone has to play the role.  Kristoffer is a funny caricature of the kind of humorless actor, steeped in theory, who takes his job much too seriously. A slavish devotee of a fictional Italian playwright and madman named Gambini, he sinks into his task with an alarming intensity, trying out various line readings. Initially unaware that he been thrown into a rats’ nest, he treats his encounters with the six senior employees under Ravn as improvisations.  Ravn has told him nothing about the six, who lent him the money to establish the company, and whom Ravn plans to fire without giving them their fair share of profits, once the papers are signed. Lise (Iben Hjejle), an employee who was led to believe that Svend was gay, immediately recognizes the lie  and pressures Kristoffer into having sex on a desk.  Kristoffer discovers that Ravn has represented Svend differently to each of the six, and “The Boss of it All” turns into a deadpan farce of misunderstandings and embarrassments, as several refer to inappropriately intimate communications from Svend about which Kristoffer knows nothing. The story takes another mean twist when Finnur’s lawyer shows up and turns out to be Kristoffer’s scornful ex-wife, Kisser (Sofie Grabol).  Like all of Mr. von Trier’s films, “The Boss of It All” is a cold, misanthropic work that places no faith in institutions and in humanity itself. But it’s also very funny. Those at the top of the corporate pecking order, like Ravn and Finnur, are liars and manipulators. Below them are self-important fools, the blind leading the blind, playing walk-on parts that they delude themselves into believing are starring roles.

With the low-budget comedy "The Boss of It All," Danish helmer Lars von Trier takes a break from the international casts, bare-stage aesthetic and the self-described "sermonizing" of his past two features, "Manderlay" and "Dogville." Plot, about an actor hired to impersonate a fictional company owner to help the real proprietor sell the firm, shares thematic DNA with much of von Trier's earlier work. Tone, however, is so breezy an exit-door draft could blow it off the screen. Theatrically, "Boss" will make negligible profits, even locally, but it should pay its way on ancillary with sales to von Trier completists.
Opening crane shot scans the outside of an office block in an unnamed Danish town. In the windows, the helmer himself is visible behind the camera rig. "You can see my reflection," intones von Trier's voiceover. "But this film won't cause you more than a moment's reflection." Indirectly acknowledging that auds and critics might have found some of his earlier films heavy weather, helmer promises that this one is "a comedy, but harmless as such."
In fact, the humor has some bite. Those aware of von Trier's rocky relationships with actors on past pics (Bjork in "Dancer in the Dark," Nicole Kidman in "Dogville") could easily read this one as an allegory of the mind games helmers play with their actors, as well as a send-up of thespian pomposity. More industry-savvy auds may read pic as a good-humored spoof of von Trier's relationship with his longserving producer and biz-partner Peter Albaek, with all the good cop/bad cop role-playing involved in running a company.
For years, company director Ravn (Peter Gantzler) has let his staff think the firm has a perpetually absent "boss of it all" named Svend E., who makes all the unpopular decisions. He communicates his desires, and sometimes conducts whole long-distance relationships with the staff, via email.
Ravn now wants to sell the company to temperamental Icelander Finnur (helmer Fridrik Thor Fridriksson), but Finnur will only do business with Svend.
To nail the deal, Ravn hires small-time legit thesp Kristoffer (Jens Albinus) to incarnate Svend for just one meeting with Finnur and his interpreter (Benedikt Erlingsson). However, Kristoffer's overacting, and announcement that he's given Ravn power of attorney, annoys Finnur so much he walks out. Finnur insists Kristoffer/Svend must be the one who signs the papers in a week's time.
Caught up in his role, Kristoffer introduces himself as the boss to some of the company staff -- which means he'll have to go through with the charade for the next week. Afraid of confrontation, Ravn throws Kristoffer in the deep end without telling him anything about his "character" (as the thesp insists on calling the Svend fiction).
This leads to a series of amusing skits as Kristoffer struggles to keep up the pretence when he meets the company's six founding members. Pic starts to enter realm of screwball comedy when Finnur's lawyer shows up. She just happens to be Kristoffer's ex-wife, Kisser (Sofie Grabol).
At Copenhagen fest preem, helmer semi-joked he's been remaking the same story throughout his career, one in which an idealist enters a situation and then screws it all up through good intentions. On the surface, "Boss" looks different from the highly stylized pics that von Trier is best known for. But pic's storyline fits the above template as Kristoffer wreaks havoc through his commitment to his craft and his growing belief that Ravn is not treating his staff right.
With its Danish setting, naturally-lit look and theater-workshop vibe, pic most resembles von Trier's "The Idiots," in which a group of anarchists pretended to be mentally deficient to confront suburbia. Albinus played the group's ringleader, also named Kristoffer, in "The Idiots."
Actors seem to be enjoying themselves, and display sharp yet underplayed comic timing, with Albinus and Gantzler making a likeable double-act. English-speaking auds will see some similarities with the TV series "The Office," although von Trier claims never to have seen the show.
Pic is being marketed as the fruit of von Trier's recently announced aim "to reduce the scope of productions in regard to funding, technology, the size of crew and particularly casting." But it still showcases his liking for tech-tinkering, here by using a new camera system, Automavision, which gets pic's sole credit for cinematography.
Process involves a camera's tilt, pan, focal length and/or positioning being randomly offset by a computer. A similar randomization applies to the sound recording. Result is a lot of off-kilter compositions, sometimes with subjects' heads at the bottom or side of the screen. This just about fits the material, creating a comic, world-out-of-joint atmosphere.
Likewise, editing credited to Molly M. Stensgaard and supervised by von Trier favors constant jump cuts, creating a jittery effect that some motion-sensitive auds might find disconcerting. Blowup from 16mm is OK.
For all its slightness, pic is helmer's least pretentious and most sheerly enjoyable for years, despite its very limited commercial appeal.

America, that recurring object of Lars von Trier 's long-distance disaffection, figures only in passing in The Boss of It All , as the adopted home of the title character, the president of a Copenhagen -based IT company. Except, as we discover early on, this Oz-like figure, whom none of his employees has ever actually met, doesn't live in the U.S. at all. In fact, he doesn't even exist.
No, the real boss here  is a man called Ravn (Peter Gantzler ), who started the company a decade ago and in a bid to be loved, not feared, invented a phantom to shoulder the blame for his executive decisions. Now, as he plans to sell the company to a surly Icelandic businessman, Ravn must make that phantom appear in the flesh. So he hires an out-of-work stage actor (Jens Albinus ) to play the part, and The Boss of It All is about how that actor, as actors have been known to do, comes to identify a little too strongly with the role.
However one felt about Dogville  and Manderlay and I happened to like them boththey undeniably represented von Trier at his most polemical, whereas The Boss of It All finds him in a more playful mode. He even appears on-screen in the movie's opening frames, impishly informing us that there will be "no preaching" in what follows, "just a cozy time." Thanks, Lars, but surely we know well enough by now not to take anything in one of your films at face value. As its farcical situations fall into place, The Boss of It All turns out to have quite a lot to say, actually, about loyalty, the temptation of the almighty dollar, and corporate buck-passing as a kind of Olympic sport.
It also feels like a revealing checkup on its creator's career. Von Trier turned 50 while making The Boss of It All , parted ways with his longtime producer, and returned to working in Danish with a predominately Danish cast following three consecutive star-studded English-language productions. But despite its small scale, a premise that recalls (of all things) the 1993 Ivan Reitman  comedy Dave , and the best efforts of its own maker to disparage its significance, The Boss of It All finds von Trier once more staking out new if somewhat troublingformal ground.
A decade after von Trier and a cabal of film- making countrymen took a semi-infamous "vow of chastity" and a movement known as Dogme was born, The Boss of It All was made in accordance with a new set of Larsian dictates. Called Automavision and described in the press notes as "a principle for shooting film developed with the intention of limiting human influence by inviting chance in from the cold," the process hands over control of a film's images and sound mixing from trained technicians to a computer program designed to randomly change settings at the touch of a button. (To wit, Automavision is credited as the film's cinematographer.) Colors and angles and sound levels don't match from one cut to the next. The movie is ugly as sin to look at. But it's all intentional on the part of von Trier, who once told an interviewer that moviemaking had become too easy because "all you have to do is buy a computer and you have armies rampaging over mountains; you have dragons." Now he's showing us how close we are to the time when movies will be directed by machines instead of artists. Perhaps he's telling us that we're already there.
