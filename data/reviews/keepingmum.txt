 The dark British comedy “Keeping Mum” exudes the comfy familiarity of a vintage episode of “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” stretched into a feature-length film. All that’s missing is a mordant epilogue by the master of suspense himself reassuring us with lofty comic hauteur that justice will eventually be visited upon the guilty. This particular story trafficks in the same black humor as the episode in which a mischievous murderess (played by Barbara Bel Geddes, if I remember correctly) ends up serving the murder weapon (a leg of lamb) to the police.  In “Keeping Mum,” Maggie Smith, her tongue digging a hole in her cheek, is Grace Hawkins, a seemingly angelic old lady who materializes almost Mary Poppins-like in the English village of Little Wallop, population 57. No sooner has she begun working as a housekeeper for the local vicar’s troubled family than she sets about solving their problems, large and small.  The stuffy vicar, Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), has grown too pious by half, and his marriage to his beautiful wife, Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas), is withering from lack of attention. Sexually frustrated, she is considering an invitation from her sleazy American golf teacher, Lance (Patrick Swayze), to run away with him to Australia. Meanwhile the couple’s boy-crazy daughter, Holly (Tamsin Egerton), is on the verge of running wild, and their adolescent son, Petey (Toby Parkes), is the target of school bullies.  The first indication that a miracle worker has arrived in the Goodfellow household is the sudden disappearance of a dog in the next yard that has been keeping Gloria awake at night. Other blessings quickly follow. Grace invites Petey to watch what happens when his tormentors pursue him on bicycles after school one afternoon. When the gang members appear, pedaling furiously, and try to stop, their brakes fail. Earlier we have seen Grace wielding shears and wearing a secret smile.  Grace revitalizes the Goodfellows’ marriage by visiting Walter in church and reacquainting him with the Song of Solomon, which sets his juices flowing. Suddenly Walter and Gloria are all over each other. Grace also introduces Walter to an ecclesiastical joke that leads him to pepper his sermons with religious humor gleaned from an Internet site, and his jokes make him the star of a clerical convention.  None of this is at all surprising. In the movie’s opening scene, set four decades earlier, the young Grace (Emilia Fox) is shown aboard a train on which her enormous trunk begins leaking blood in the baggage compartment. Approached by the police, she proudly confesses to having killed and chopped up the bodies of her unfaithful husband and his mistress and is sent to a prison for the criminally insane. Newly discharged after four decades, she appears in Little Wallop toting the same trunk.  It’s refreshing to see Dame Maggie in a lighter mode than usual. The role of a genteel psychopath is a piece of lemon tea cake she consumes in one delicate bite. Ms. Scott Thomas matches her in the ease with which she carries off the latest variation of her stereotype: the chilly English beauty with a volcanic libido. Mr. Atkinson embellishes the vicar’s ludicrous overnight metamorphosis from prune to plum with amusing comic touches.  “Keeping Mum,” directed by Niall Johnson, doesn’t pretend to have anything to do with reality. Except for the glaringly overwrought performance of Mr. Swayze, it is as determinedly British and old-fashioned as an Agatha Christie mystery consumed with cucumber sandwiches and a spot of tea.  “Keeping Mum” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

Rather dark, decidedly English and exceedingly well played, "Keeping Mum" is a neatly crafted black comedy with more than a nod in tone toward the Ealing classic "The Ladykillers." Strongly cast, with Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith both at the top of their game, yarn about a murderous old housekeeper who solves the problems of a village vicar and his dysfunctional family is, ironically, too well acted and subtly directed for mass B.O. appeal. When pics were allowed to build by word-of-mouth, this slyly humorous item, released wide in Blighty Dec. 2, could have become a cult hit.
Forty-three years ago, a beautiful young blonde, Rosie Jones (Emilia Fox), boards a train with a large leather-bound trunk, from which a large pool of blood slowly issues. Arrested, Rosie's sentenced to life in a prison for the criminally insane, for murdering and chopping up two people.
Cut to today and the genteel village of Little Wallop (pop. 57), where the Goodfellow family resides. Dad Walter (Rowan Atkinson) is the local vicar, somewhat forgetful and endlessly harried by an aged nosy neighbor, suitably named Mrs. Parker (TV vet Liz Smith). Mom Gloria (Scott Thomas) is bored out of her brain and hasn't had sex in ages, unlike her 17-year-old nympho daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton). Younger son Peter (Toby Parkes) is bullied at school.
Gloria is flirting mildly with her Yank golf coach, the studly Lance (Patrick Swayze). However, Lance also has eyes for Holly.
Enter the aged Grace Hawkins (Maggie Smith), the family's new housekeeper, who has a leather-bound trunk just like Rosie's. Think Mary Poppins crossed with Nanny McPhee without the warts.
Almost immediately, the Goodfellows' life changes for the better. A barking dog that's been keeping Gloria awake suddenly stops barking. Peter's bullies take a tumble from their bikes. And even Holly takes an interest in baking cakes. That leaves just Gloria and Walter's marriage to fix.
As the slightly dotty vicar and tart-tongued housekeeper, Atkinson and Smith are cast in roles where it would be easy for them simply to trot out their usual shtick. Both, however, rein back, giving the third act, which goes for warm character development rather than a comedic Big Finish, a satisfying -- if, in popular terms, low-key -- glow.
Neither Grace nor Walter swamp the picture's true lead, loving but frustrated housewife Gloria. In a very different role from usual, Scott Thomas is aces here, handling her sexy (but unconsummated) liaisons with Swayze's coach with a mixture of well-bred common sense and oh-my-god longing. 
Swayze is more of a Yank cliche, but OK in the circumstances. Egerton nicely underplays the leggy, confrontational daughter.
In his third feature, Niall Johnson, who also scripted this year's "White Noise," directs smoothly in widescreen. Southern English setting is actually a convincing meld of locations in the Isle of Man, Cornwall, North Yorkshire and Kingston-upon-Thames, with studio work at Pinewood.
With only one script surprise to power the third act, pic would benefit by slight tightening in the last half-hour. Other credits are fine, with Vicki Russell's slightly tweaked costumes and d.p. Gavin Finney's burnished colors creating a mildly exaggerated rural look. Small slip in a dated prop would seem to place the opening 41 years ago, rather than 43.
Film is dedicated to the late James Booth, who plays the crusty old dog-owner. Best known for '60s roles in movies like "Zulu," thesp died in August, at age 77.

Exactly the sort of coy, patronizing pap you'd imagine actors like Kristin Scott Thomas  and Maggie Smith  take merely to pay debts or mortgages, Keeping Mum  involves a country vicar (Rowan Atkinson ), his sexually frustrated wife (Thomas), and a dotty busybody maid (Smith) who seems to solve the family's various problems with just a twinkle of her watery eye. If the exquisite, heather-thatch -and-old-churchyard village ambience doesn't assail your blood sugar, Dickon Hinchliffe 's nonstop, abusively rosy-cheeked soundtrack will. But we know thanks to an opening flashback that Smith's coot is actually a quiet sociopathic husband-killer, and the bodies begin to primly drop. (One of them, thank Christ, is Patrick Swayze , as a seductive-lech golf pro jeopardizing the family's struggling equilibrium.) Obvious, simplistic, and never funny, Johnson's movie may be useful only as real estate pornCornwall  and the Isle of Man  never looked so super cute. Michael Atkinson
