It�s a testament to the talents of Bardem that he can currently be seen as both one of the most romantic heroes in modern fiction (Florentino Ariza in Love in the Time of Cholera
) and one of the most violently sociopathic (Chigurh in No Country for Old Men
). Sadly for moviegoing audiences, the former performance cannot save what is otherwise a painful mess. Adapted from Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez�s masterpiece, the film stays true to the novel�s story. Set primarily in Cartagena, Colombia, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the movie follows the unrequited obsessive love of Florentino over the span of 50 years. Opening in 1930 with the death an aging doctor (Benjamin Bratt), the film unfolds as a gray-haired Florentino professes his everlasting love to the doctor�s widow, Fermina (Mezzogiorno). The story then flashes back 50 years to the youthful secret romance between Fermina and Florentino (now played by Ugalde). After Fermina abruptly ends their relationship, Florentino (back to Bardem) is beyond heartbroken. A swooning poet, he is incapable of composing even a simple business letter without writing romantic prose. While Fermina meets and marries the successful young doctor, Florentino subdues his pain through random yet frequent sexual encounters as he continues to pine for his love. As decades pass, Florentino remains obsessively devoted to Fermina. It�s a challenging task to translate any novel (let alone a classic one) into film. And while this adaptation (the first attempt by Hollywood to translate M�rquez) makes many mistakes, the most glaring may be its obsessive desire to stay true to the book. The best novel-to-film adaptations (The Shining
,  Blade Runner
) become something completely different from the original text. But director Newell (Mona Lisa Smile
) and writer Ronald Harwood (The Pianist
) adapt M�rquez�s work quite literally, and the effect is stifling. Trying (where M�rquez succeeds) to convey romance, social commentary, and comedy, the film becomes a muddied blend of emotion. Funny when it�s supposed to be serious, confusing when it�s supposed to be poetic, and awkward when it�s supposed to be romantic, every twist is a near miss. On the page, Florentino�s affairs are heartbreaking, comedic, and surreal, yet onscreen, his incessant sexual encounters caused one audience member behind me to remark, �That was like a period-piece Porky�s
.� Not surprisingly, it�s better to just read the book.


During a moment intended as poignant in the silly new film of "Love in the Time of Cholera," 70-something Fermina Daza (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) asks her long-lost love, Florentino Ariza (Javier Bardem), to avert his eyes as she disrobes. Why, he asks. Because you won't like what you see, she replies. Are you kidding me? For a woman described as "ravaged by age" in Gabriel García Márquez's novel, her naked body still looks relatively ravishing. Which, of course, is the central problem with the conceit of this adaptation: Everything is gussied up.
García Márquez's 22-year-old book asked, and captured rather explicitly, what sex would be like between two old people who've waited more than 50 years to get it on. The brutal truth of the novel has been perfumed with an artificial beauty. The movie is knowingly and accidentally funny and has been made with the kind of tastefulness and professionalism that dip into ribaldry just to prove it's not as stodgy as you expect it to be (Shakira even bleats and ululates on the soundtrack). This is all to say it's often watchable (and listenable) without ever being good.
The longtime screenwriter Ronald Harwood (Roman Polanksi's "The Pianist" and "Oliver Twist") and the director Mike Newell ("Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Donnie Brasco," and the fourth of the Harry Potter movies) cut right to the chase. In turn-of-the-last-century-ish Colombia, young Fermina Daza (Mezzogiorno, again) and Florentino Ariza (Unax Ugalde) fall in what García Márquez called "devastating love." It's also forbidden. Her shady businessman father (John Leguizamo) wants Fermina to marry someone more respectable than a telegraph operator. So he pushes on her Juvenal Urbino (Benjamin Bratt), the handsome, unreasonably dapper doctor who helped saved thousands from a cholera epidemic.
Her heart belongs to the telegraph boy, but the heroic doctor wins it with hilarious persistence. Bratt plays Urbino with passive-aggressive lasciviousness (see him open Mezzogiorno's nightgown to "examine" her chest). If Billy Dee Williams were doing Pepé Le Pew, it'd go something like this. Bratt's outdone in the shamelessness department only by Leguizamo, who seizes the role as an opportunity to practice his keyed-up Warren Oates and Vito Corleone impersonations, often at the same time. You have to wonder how much less cartoonish and more authentic the movie might seem were it actually in Spanish. Maybe it would have just been an authentic cartoon, but even that would have been an improvement.
In any case, poor heartsick Florentino grows into the reliably entertaining personage of Bardem and spends the next five decades filling the void in his heart with the empty romantic calories of less meaningful sex: 622 times. The movie gives us a thumbnail version as it flits between his half of the film and Fermina's. But as a distillation of a densely woven novel, the movie exposes the book as rather soapy. It brings out the comedy, mostly involving the sex. Hector Elizondo, as Florentino's uncle, delivers the biggest laugh in the movie when he catches Bardem in flagrante delicto - it feels like an outtake, and yet it's funny, all the same.
But the movie doesn't work, because Harwood and Newell never figured how to transport the book's moving ironic essence: that love blooms amid so much corporeal decay. The heart may want what the heart wants, but the body - stinky, spotted, and unreliable after all those years - has a different agenda. Little of the fragile wisdom with which García Márquez imbued that idea has survived this timid Hollywood treatment.
The casting speaks to that, too. Having 33-year-old Italian Mezzogiorno play Fermina Daza as a young woman and as an old one confirms a lack of courage. She's not bad, particularly as a besotted adolescent who can turn on the waterworks with ease, but she doesn't seem experienced enough a person to make me believe her as a matron in her 70s. Nor is she as fascinating to watch as either Catalina Sandino Moreno or Ana Claudia Talancón, who have smallish parts.
The conceit, of course, is that within those seasoned bodies are youthful spirits. But you never believe that. For a sense of what the movie is afraid of, you don't have to search hard. The great Fernanda Montenegro, who's a year older than García Márquez, turns up as Florentino's protective mother. No makeup can create the years that line her face or the heft that fills out her body. She's eventually turned into a sad grotesque, but the authority of age she brings - not to mention her age's countenance - leaves a deep impression, anyway. Under the prettified circumstances, she's pure magic realism.


Those who have read Gabriel García Márquez's glowing and sexy 1988 novel about one man's grand love for a woman who marries another are bound to be peevishly disappointed by Love in the Time of Cholera . And those who haven't read the book will now never understand the ardor of those who have  at least not based on all the hammy traipsing and coupling and scene-hopping thrown together here.
Either way, literature is poorly served. But then, so are moviegoers numbed by all the elaborate costumes and distracting stunt-aging makeup in this turgid and lifeless movie adaptation. As for the splendid Spaniard Javier Bardem, now knocking socks off in No Country for Old Men , his lot is worst of all. He's miscast as the romantic Florentino, doggedly devoted to his ''crowned goddess,'' Fermina (Italian actress Giovanna Mezzogiorno, unexceptional except for her facial resemblance to Debra Winger), even after she spurns him to become the wife of a doctor (Benjamin Bratt). And not knowing what else to do with his earthiness, Bardem squishes his natural confidence unconvincingly under Florentino's dorky hat and makes moony eyes of longing.
Given free rein to make a freewheeling television miniseries, a filmmaker like Alfonso Cuarón might have known what to do with García Márquez's muchness. But working with a toneless movie script by Ronald Harwood, fellow Harry Potter  director Mike Newell, alas, doesn't.

 “Love in the Time of Cholera” sets itself the elusive task of translating Gabriel García Márquez’s masterpiece of magical realism into an upscale art film with popular appeal. Faithful to the outline of the novel but emotionally and spiritually anemic, it slides into the void between art and entertainment,  where well-intended would-be screen epics often land with a thud.  Stripped of multiple layers of philosophic and poetic implication, the metaphorically loaded story of a man’s lifelong passion for a beautiful woman who marries another man emerges as a weightless, picturesque gloss.  Florentino Ariza, a latter-day  Colombian Don Quixote, is one of the greatest fools for love in modern literature. Javier  Bardem, the movie’s primary asset, imbues this soulful, eccentric poet with the appropriate tragicomic balance of nobility and absurdity.  But one sure-footed performance can’t salvage the movie. The literary texture that elevates Florentino’s story   to epic proportion on the page is missing here. Although the screenplay by Ronald Harwood (“The Pianist”) dutifully quotes and paraphrases Mr. García Márquez, Florentino  comes across as a pallid Xerox copy of the author’s creation.  One  fundamental problem is the disconnection between  the novel’s Colombian-born author and the movie’s creators. Mike Newell (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”), who directed, is British, and Mr. Harwood, who was born in South Africa has a background in British theater, which may explain why the film’s characters, even those played by  Hispanic actors, come across as relocated Dickensian caricatures.  The novel is a  time capsule about the turn of the 19th into the 20th century, in which Florentino represents an impractical and superstitious 19th-century dreaminess. Juvenal Urbino (Benjamin Bratt), the handsome European-trained doctor who marries the object of Florentino’s lifelong obsession, Fermina Daza (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), is his 20th-century counterbalance. Juvenal represents the new era of science, technology and pragmatic problem solving. If romantic love is a disease like cholera, Juvenal has the knowledge and wherewithal to cure it. But the  movie  makes the doctor a shallow, self-important know-it-all strutting around in a cream-colored top hat and tails.  Ms. Mezzogiorno, the Italian actress who plays Fermina, is attractive and sultry. The character has the temperament of a heavy thunderstorm; the actress  conveys only  distant rumbles and flickers of lightning. As Florentino and Fermina age more than 50 years Mr. Bardem’s Florentino visibly shrinks and withers into a stooped old man whose cow-eyed gazes soften into a doting, faraway twinkle. Ms. Mezzogiorno’s much less convincing decline reminds you of the bluish-haired Elizabeth Taylor at the end of “Giant.” Although he has bedded more than 600 women, Florentino saves his essential self for Fermina. One of the novel’s most seductive notions is the idea of virginity of the soul,  of the essential self  reserved for  one’s true love.  The film follows Florentino from his youth (Unax Ugalde plays him as a wide-eyed, trembling teenage suitor) who woos Fermina and initially wins her heart. But he loses her when her socially ambitious father, Lorenzo Daza (John Leguizamo, in a near-apoplectic one-note performance), bans him from the house and promotes her marriage to Juvenal. It ends in the 1930s, after Florentino has ascended from telegraph operator and writer-for-hire of flowery love letters, into a wealthy ship owner under the tutelage of his uncle, Don Leo (Hector Elizondo).  The story’s circular structure begins in 1930s Cartagena with the death of Juvenal, which at long last gives Florentino license to resume his pursuit of Fermina after 50 years of pining, then doubles back to 1879. It ends with Florentino’s and Fermina’s voyage on a riverboat, which has dropped anchor in the Magdalena River.  The movie pushes this fable of  endless love in the sentimental direction of “On Golden Pond.” In the novel’s  vision of undying romantic obsession, Florentino is both the embodiment of passion ennobled by suffering and a ridiculous clown afflicted with the disease of passion, for which cholera is a pungent metaphor. In awkwardly illustrating this paradox the film teeters between slapstick (several scenes of Florentino’s frenetic sex life) and soap opera. The book’s philosophic content is reduced to a few scattered asides. The magical realism, in which the past pervades the present and the dead haunt the living, is suggested by the fleeting appearance of a ghost in the background.  The crucial missing ingredient, for which no amount of lush scenery can substitute, is the  voice of Mr. García Márquez’s omniscient narrator. The language of “Love in the Time of Cholera” is its lifeblood. While reading the novel you can almost smell the stink of illness and death as well as the  flowers and  fecundity of life in a tropical climate. Where the novel wraps you in an intoxicating sensuality, the movie shrinks from the overwhelming physicality of Mr. García Márquez’s imagination. In its scenes of disease it politely wrinkles its nose before hurrying on.  That intimate proximity of life and death, the looming sense of fate that pervades Latin American fiction and in particular Mr. García Márquez’s writing, are absent. Perhaps a bolder director (Alfonso Cuarón? Guillermo del Toro? Alejandro González Iñárritu? Pedro Almodóvar?) more culturally attuned to this author and his voluptuous imagination might have found an appropriate cinematic language to tell the story. “Love in the Time of Cholera” has no voice of its own.  The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations.

While seemingly impossible-to-film novels are being gracefully nurtured for the screen this season ("Atonement," "The Kite Runner," "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"), Gabriel Garcia Marquez's much-adored "Love in the Time of Cholera" has been given a translation�by helmer Mike Newell that's both too literal and too thorough. Despite a magnificent performance by Javier Bardem, the film not only falls short of the novel's magic, but fails to generate much of its own. Fans of the author, perhaps enlisted through the book's enshrinement in Oprah's Book Club, will be seduced. But serious filmgoers -- "Love's" target aud -- will be neither seduced nor amused, making for an arduous B.O. trek on the upscale specialized circuit.
It's the fault of neither Bardem nor screenwriter Ronald Harwood's faithful, if necessarily condensed, adaptation that Newell's movie can't replicate the kind of spell Garcia Marquez wove into a novel that spans 53 years over the late 19th century and early 20th century. In telling the tale of Florentino Ariza (Bardem) and Fermina Daza (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) -- two Carthaginians who fall in love as teenagers but don't reunite until they are "two old people about to be ambushed by death" -- Garcia Marquez showed an avuncular tolerance for the romantic foibles and feckless caprice of his characters.
Florentino, after all, falls in love with Fermina and remains that way for his entire life. She, however, rejects him after an enforced separation, and it's the most knowing scene in the film: She looks at his lovesick face and knows at once she doesn't love him.
Florentino is devasted and embarks on a life of enforced loneliness, despite the hundreds of women he beds (and records in his trusty notebook). Fermina, meanwhile, marries Dr. Juvenal Urbino (Benjamin Bratt), has children and is betrayed, all the while still loved by Florentino -- who is there for her the moment she's widowed. "I've remained a virgin for you," he tells her on their inaugural night, and it's a line guaranteed to get a laugh. For Garcia Marquez's readers, however, the reaction was an ache and a pang for Florentino's poignant realization of his lifelong solitude.
Pic shoehorns a story that requires nuance and a high tolerance for human ridiculousness into a far too conventional sensibility, and its characters are unavoidably diminished by their purposefully fractured English, rather than the eloquent Spanish their words and emotions require. Garcia Marquez's characters may be children, but they aren't childish; even in their most ludicrous moments, they maintain their dignity -- something of which the picture deprives them by finding an overabundance of humor in oft-tragic circumstances.
That said, Bardem is a noble presence, and the film has been shot and scored with eloquent understatement by Affonso Beato and Antonio Pinto, respectively (a couple songs by pop songstress Shakira are included, for all those teenagers who won't
 be flocking to the movie).
Portraying Florentino from young manhood to old age, Bardem is a chameleon. Impersonating an elderly man is one thing, and thanks are due to John E. Jackson's makeup and prosthetics. But when the actor plays the younger Florentino -- a man younger than Bardem himself, in other words -- he makes the transformation largely through weight loss, a wide-eyed countenance and an air of guilelessness unknown to anyone over the age of 20. It's not as if you can't see through it, but it's so honest, you don't want to. The rest of the film might have benefited by example.
Around Florentino and Fermina gambol a herd of hams. John Leguizamo, as Fermina's social-climbing father (who, of course, hates the working-class Florentino) seems to be channeling Don Corleone. Hector Elizondo, wearing what must be a pelt around his face, channels himself as Florentino's uncle Leo. And Bratt, as Fermina's philandering husband, simply lacks the gravity to bring his character to life.
There is also the problem of compression; the filmmakers want to touch all the bases, but in doing so, they have completed a blueprint rather than a building.� Mezzogiorno is a haunting, gray-eyed beauty, and Florentino, in his worship, is a sympathetic hero. But the performances can't compensate for the lack of meaningful connections in a movie that might have been great.
Production values are muy bueno.

Easily the worst adaptation of a major novel by a Nobel Prizewinning author. Easily . Director Mike Newell  and writer Ronald Harwood  have rendered Gabriel García Márquez 's novel little more than a sudsy telenovelaLifetime by way of Telemundo . Not that the material didn't teeter and totter in that direction to begin with: The story of Florentino Ariza 's 50-year crush on Fermina Daza  was always little more than a variation on Romeo and Juliet , only tinged with the flowery scent of magical realism. But there ain't a damned thing realmagical or otherwiseabout this abomination, which stars a wasted Javier Bardem  as Florentino and Giovanna Mezzogiorno  as Fermina, who ditches Florentino for a doctor (Benjamin Bratt , who's always been a little made-for-TV anyway). From the hoot-worthy dialogue ("I don't need a medical lesson." "No, this is going to be a lesson in love") to the atrocious makeup, to the dead rats taped to the side of Hector Elizondo 's head, the entire thing's a wreck. Unless it was trolling for sneering chuckles, in which casesuccess!
