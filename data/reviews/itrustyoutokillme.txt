 There is surely no shortage of aspiring rock bands, logging lonely hours of rehearsal and traipsing from one club date to the next in search of the big break. Not many of them, however, have famous actors serving as their tour managers, roadies and record-label bosses. That Rocco DeLuca and the Burden are attached, in these ways and more, to Kiefer Sutherland — son of Donald and star of “24” — may not be their only claim to distinction, but it is the only discernible reason for the existence of “I Trust You to Kill Me,” Manu Boyer’s inconsequential documentary about the band’s brief first tour of Europe.  Mr. DeLuca, whose wailing voice and anguished songwriting drives the Burden, is an intense, skinny 28-year-old who takes himself very seriously as an artist. His music is a bit droning and sludgy for my taste, but his own taste in music —  John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Appalachian murder ballads —  can hardly be argued with.  Mr. Sutherland, in any case, believes mightily in his protégé and lends his time and celebrity to the cause of promoting Mr. DeLuca. Mr. Sutherland unloads equipment outside a London nightclub on a freezing-cold day and hands out free tickets on the streets of Dublin (and inside a few of the city’s pubs). “Are you somebody famous?” one Dubliner asks. “Well, I’m working as an actor now,” he coyly replies.  As it follows the band from one city to another, “I Trust You to Kill Me” becomes less about Mr. DeLuca and more about his sponsor. Chronicling the ups and downs of the band gives way to charting Mr. Sutherland’s vaguely defined personal journey, one that involves tattooing the song lyric that gives the film its title onto his forearm in Icelandic runes.  Mr. Boyer shows up in the actor’s hotel room from time to time asking nosy questions, and Mr. Sutherland stays up late drinking and carousing, at one point flinging himself into a Christmas tree in the lobby of a London hotel. At the end we learn that the Burden later relieved him of his duties as tour manager, sending him back to his day job of pretending to save the world from terrorism.

Deftly mixing alternating tracks of playful rowdiness, thoughtful introspection, ferociously slamming rock and not-so-quiet desperation, helmer Manu Boyer scores impressively with "I Trust You to Kill Me," arguably the best rockumentary since "Some Kind of Monster." Surprisingly compelling pic accompanies Kiefer Sutherland on tour as road manager for Rocco DeLuca & the Burden, up-and-comers signed to the actor's Ironworks Music indie label. But even though Sutherland figures prominently, and confides revealingly, doc's theatrical and homevid prospects may rely more heavily on whether DeLuca and his group can achieve breakout chart and concert-hall success.
Frequent performance sequences showcase the dynamic DeLuca -- wailing Robert Plant-style vocals to sliding Dobro guitar riffs -- as a soulfully intense talent who fuses jazz, rock, blues and folk elements to potent impact. Off-stage, however, the sad-eyed singer-songwriter comes off as far more reserved, if not downright melancholy, as he candidly discusses his ambivalence about the music industry, and recalls an unhappy childhood spent neglected by distant parents. 
Without ever pushing too hard, helmer Boyer pointedly suggests that Sutherland's own mixed feelings about his famous father, Donald Sutherland, may have led him to view DeLuca as something of a kindred spirit. Sutherland virtually admits as much during interview sequences shot in moody black-and-white.
Pic is appreciably livelier when it is more colorful, literally as well as figuratively, while detailing the difficulties faced by any unknown band -- even one backed by a widely recognized film and TV star -- during its first international tour. 
"I Trust You to Kill Me" (the name of group's first CD) is consistently amusing, and occasionally hilarious, as it follows DeLuca and bandmates Ryan Carman (drums), Dave Beste (bass) and Greg Velasquez (percussion) through a series of demanding gigs in small clubs scattered throughout London, Dublin, Reykjavic and Berlin. A highlight is their performance of "Soul," the best tune on their debut CD, which nearly blasts the paint off the stage in a Berlin basement club. 
At every stop, Sutherland exploits his celebrity as star of worldwide TV phenom "24" to grant timely interviews that will enable him to plug the band. And whenever that proves inadequate, he's not ashamed to simply patrol the streets outside a club and give away tickets to amazed passers-by who can't believe they're seeing who they're seeing.
Sutherland's avid support for the band borders on the obsessive -- at one point, he gets an elaborate tattoo to express his zeal; in fact, his willingness to risk look ridiculous on camera emerges as his most engaging trait during the pic.
Cynics might be tempted to dismiss "I Trust You to Kill Me" as a feature-length promotional tool. But pic can be enjoyed, and respected, by auds who care little for DeLuca's music. At its frequent best, the artfully crafted doc earns respect as an insightful and arresting behind-the-scenes look at what any band must endure to make that first lunge at the brass ring.

Perhaps you are wondering why a little-known band called Rocco DeLuca and the Burden  merits a glossy feature-length documentary of its whirlwind European tour. After watching Manu Boyer 's film, you may still wonder: This could be the first film in the annals of rock docs in which the star power is supplied by the tour managera fellow named Kiefer Sutherland , who chose DeLuca as the first signing on his new label. Charmingly lacking in Jack Bauer 's surly sangfroidhis tipsy tackling of a hotel lounge Christmas tree is an instant YouTube keeperSutherland flogs DeLuca's music from dingy London dives to Scandinavian TV: His ultimate goal is to get out of the group's way, but his fame is inevitably the currency that gets anyone to pay attention. Especially since DeLucaa scruffy, brooding sort given to chipped black nail polish and pronouncements like "The most beautiful instrument in the world is a black woman's voice"is a less than compelling stage presence whose bluesy coffeehouse alterna-rock makes Sutherland's passionate devotion a mystery. (A London booking agent nails it when he says the band needs to "play at least another 200 shows.") Boyer does a slick recital of rock-doc greatest hits, from black-and-white interviews to roughed-up basement performance footage, and the rousing finale catches the band at its liveliest. Even so, when Sutherland gets the movie's title engraved on his arm in Icelandic runes, you can't help but feel you're watching the most ill-advised megastar tat since Johnny Depp 's "Winona Forever."
