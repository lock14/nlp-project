 “Dynamite Warrior,” a Thai martial arts film, starts with a bang, which is to say a fight: It’s fast, colorful, well choreographed and, when the masked hero surfs through the air on a homemade rocket, giddy and odd.  The film is set in Thailand, just as the country begins to industrialize. The evil Lord Waeng (Puttipong Sriwat) wants to replace buffalo with the tractors he sells. The result: lots of fighting. On a parallel track, the hero, Jone Bang Fai (Dan Chupong), is avenging the death of his parents. The result: lots of fighting.  “Dynamite Warrior” is a genre confection with more than a passing resemblance to Hong Kong martial arts movies of the 1980s. It opts for comedy over character, and action over everything.  The film’s next-strongest allegiance is to keeping the strange quotient high: Lord Waeng, his hair a lacquered exclamation point, is from the giggling psychopath school of villainy. There is also a midget, a cannibal gnawing on an enemy’s arm, ghosts, demons, the oft-invoked menstrual blood of a virgin (tee-hee) and those homemade rockets, which look like a cartoon storm of flying logs.  The nonstop action can be wearying, and the nonstop weirdness forced. But there is plenty to look at in “Dynamite Warrior,” and the skillful director, Chalerm Wongpim, keeps it all moving along at such a clip that you’re more likely to leave the theater smiling than yawning.
For everyone who saw Tears of the Black Tiger  and thought, "This could really use some rocket-surfing, a leap-frogging tiger man, and a wizard dude with Astro Boy hair who can only be defeated with virgin-pure menstrual blood," your wishes have been granted. OK, maybe just mine: This wacko Thai import means to annihilate whatever brain cells survived all those sixth-grade viewings of Infra-Man . Another blast of Muay Thai mayhema martial art which to these untrained eyes looks like the ol' knee-in-the-groin applied liberally to every other part of the bodyfrom the makers of the mighty Ong-Bak , this one's a som tum Western about a bandanna'd bandit (Dan Chupong ) who busts out his buffalo-rustling skillz to defeat an epicene lord (Thai pop star Leo Putt, not exactly rocking his Ed Grimley  coif). And not a moment too soon: The bad guy, who's prone to Liberace -style capering, intends to dominate the country with. . . tractors! Although snazzed up with some wire work and primo gunpowder fu, the fights are staged with all the grace of backyard wrestling, if the backyard's in Snakebite, Ala. But director Chalerm Wongpim's skull-buster makes up in wild-eyed insanity (and excessive, arbitrary slow motion) what it lacks in acting, pacing, and coherence. Only one word describes a national cinema capable of producing Apichatpong Weerasethakul , Wisit Sasanatieng , Tony Jaa , and now a flying monkey man chasing a rocket-powered covered wagon: ideal.
