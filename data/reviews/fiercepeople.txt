 When F. Scott Fitzgerald remarked that the rich “are different from you and me,”  he might have been thinking of someone like Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland), the reclusive, moody billionaire who casts a long shadow in Griffin Dunne’s film “Fierce People.” With his blue-eyed, wide-as-the-sky stare, white beard and patriarchal rumble, Mr. Sutherland is the embodiment of a proud old aristocrat, slowly going to ruin, who knows too much about the dark side of human nature for his own comfort. He knows, for instance, that many if not most fortunes begin with crimes.  That’s why a thoughtful response to Fitzgerald’s statement is not as simple as repeating Ernest Hemingway’s disingenuous retort, “Yes, they have more money.” Great wealth confers power, and power changes people. Ogden presides like Louis XIV over his sprawling private kingdom of woods and fields in Vlyvalle, N.J. His wealth not only entitles him to do pretty much as he pleases but also exerts an irresistible force on everyone living within his radius. In “Fierce People” that force is like an invisible toxic gas with a seductively sweet scent that immobilizes people and poisons their souls.  The film, adapted by Dirk Wittenborn from his novel, follows a working-class mother and her teenage son from New York into Ogden’s magic kingdom for a season of disenchantment in the summer of 1980. Liz Earl (Diane Lane), a physical therapist who once treated Ogden, has a drug and alcohol problem. She and her son, Finn (Anton Yelchin), are sheltered in a guest house on his estate after Finn is arrested when he buys cocaine for her. With one phone call to Ogden, who adores her, Liz makes their troubles disappear, and they are whisked away in a limousine driven by a policeman.  Until the drug bust, Finn had planned to spend the summer with his father, “the Elvis of anthropologists,” studying the Ishkanani, a primitive people in the Amazon rain forest known for their cruelty and barbarism. The intriguing conceit of “Fierce People” is that the idle superrich and the Ishkanani, whose rituals are shown on reels of film sent from South America by Finn’s father, are equally vicious.  This is a nifty idea that is laboriously overworked. As “Fierce People” nervously skitters between documentary scenes of the Ishkanani and the story of a mother and son absorbing the tribal customs of the New Jersey gentry, your instinct is throw up your hands and shout, “Enough already; we get it!”  Living on the Osborne estate are Ogden’s terminally sour daughter, Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins, whose character is even more rancid than the detestable Celia Hodes, her character on the Showtime series “Weeds”), and two seemingly golden grandchildren, Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Viewed through Finn’s eyes, the pretty heir and heiress (with whom Finn has an affair) metamorphose from a storybook prince and princess whom Finn observes with awed fascination into monsters whose sense of entitlement permits them to break any rules they please.  The insistent tribal comparisons render the movie choppy and undermine its narrative momentum. One brief scene of the Ishkanani and another of the young people on the estate playing with body paint and trying on headdresses would have sufficed to establish the analogy. The crucial dramatic turning point, a brutal assault that wrenches the movie in a different direction, is so mishandled that its full horror never registers. The subplot of Liz and Ogden’s relationship, which everyone (including Finn) assumes to be sexual, is underdeveloped, and a sub-subplot involving Liz’s romance with a handsome doctor she meets in Alcoholics Anonymous should have been discarded.  Ms. Lane, as always, is wonderfully complicated to observe. Liz is beautiful and tense but unstable. As she tries to clean up her act, her insecurity registers in subtle twitches of the mouth and glances of stifled anxiety. Mr. Yelchin’s Finn, however, is problematic. The actor infuses Finn with the same Quiz Kid  know-it-all attitude he brought to Byrd Huffstodt, the precocious son of a psychiatrist he played in another Showtime series, “Huff.” A little of his whiny voice musing out loud in a too-deliberate tone goes a long way.  “Fierce People” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, drug use, nudity and sexual situations.

Griffin Dunne's "Fierce People," a 1980-set coming-of-age tale, struggles with different types of symbolic representations in its depiction of a teen's fateful summer at a palatial East Coast estate. Pic's portrayal of the upper crust sometimes bogs down in anthropological metaphor but, happily, Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland, as the boy's mother and mentor respectively, generate enough genuine mythic power between them to reduce even symbolic naked tribesmen to mere ancillary props. Lane's and Sutherland's bravura perfs should carry Lions Gate fall release onto solid box office ground.
Finn (Anton Yelchin), a responsible, curly-headed, 15-year-old New Yorker, is all set to travel to the Amazon jungle to meet his famous anthropologist dad for the first time and join him in observing the fierce Ishkanani people. But, Finn's plans are altered dramatically when he's nabbed by the police for scoring his mom's morning cocaine.
His loving but feckless mother Liz (Diane Lane), living hand-to-mouth in the city, calls in her markers with reclusive white-haired billionaire Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland). Soon mother and son, all charges dropped, are on their way to Osborne's estate in the country, chauffeured by Osborne's personal NYPD cop (Blu Mankuma).
Once ensconced in an opulent guest house, Liz, employed as Osborne's full-time masseuse, gets busy attending AA meetings, defusing the well-bred hostility of Osborne's daughter (Elizabeth Perkins), and starting up a romance with a hunky but respectable doctor (Christopher Shyer).
Finn, freed from his usual co-dependent caretaker role, is gradually drawn into the Osborne fold; Osborne's grandson Bryce (Chris Evans), then Osborne himself take the young man under their wings. Soon the teenager is ascending the mansion's manicured lawns in a hot air balloon, RSVPing to black-tie dinners, and trysting in the gazebo with Osborne's nubile young granddaughter Maya (Kristen Stewart). Until, one night, Finn is beaten and savaged by an unknown assailant and paradise is lost.
Helmer Dunne and Dirk Wittenborn, adapting his own novel, set up increasingly explicit parallels between the monied classes and the Ishkanani tribesmen. Reels of 16mm film shot by Finn's father of Ishkanani rites and customs start unspooling with increasing regularity, while body paint and primitive accoutrements pop up all over the estate.
Whenever Sutherland comes on scene, any inadequacies in the film's depiction of the well-to-do become irrelevant. Osborne, as strikingly incarnated by Sutherland, is
 the rich, the product of generations of power, intelligence and enlightened self-interest. Lane and Sutherland, at opposite ends of the social scale, balance the film, with Lane's unaffected warmth and go-with-the-flow sensuality counterpointing Sutherland's sardonic, forward-thinking brilliance.
Yelchin's Finn, managing to convey both a true personality and malleability simultaneously, seems perfectly poised between the film's two reigning deities.
Tech credits are excellent, disguising pic's extremely modest budget. Mark Ricker's production design and Monique Prudhomme's costumes bespeak money without billboarding it, with enough unobtrusively lived-in details to avoid making the ambiance look reconstructed. Lensing by William Rexer favors deep rich colors and textures that enhance locale's cultivated landscapes even in moonlight.

When 16-year-old Finn (Anton Yelchin ) gets busted scoring drugs for his coke-snorting, alcoholic masseuse of a mother (Diane Lane ), Mom decides what the family really needs is a summer vacation on the estate of a wealthy client, Mr. Osborne (Donald Sutherland ), whose sprawling, Kennedy-like New Jersey compound offers the anthropologically minded Finn a chance to observe the moneyed elite in their natural habitat. Until, that is, he gets a little too close for somebody's comfort to Mr. Osborne and his two grandchildren (Chris Evans  and Kristen Stewart ), which earns him a brutal beating and anal rape from an unidentified assailant on the Osborne grounds. In one of those karmic quirks of the film-releasing calendar, Fierce People , which was directed by Griffin Dunne  and written by Dirk Wittenborn , is finally staggering into theatersafter more than two years on the shelfbarely a fortnight after The Nanny Diaries , that other cautionary tale about a proletariat pea that works its way under the mattress of the sockless-loaf er crowd. Adding to the déjà vu is the presence of Evans as a kind of anthropomorphic Ralph Lauren  ad. But whereas most of the injustices suffered by Nanny 's nanny are of the skin-deep variety, the hopelessly reductive Fierce People  ups the ante: It says, in effect, tangle with these crazy rich, white folks and they willquite literallyfuck you up the ass.
