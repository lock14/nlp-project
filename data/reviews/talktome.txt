In "Talk to Me," Don Cheadle plays a scrappy little explosion by the name of Petey Greene, and every moment he's hot-wired with the joy of running his mouth. Greene (real name Ralph Waldo Greene ) was a disc jockey and activist in Washington, D.C., starting in the mid-1960s, hosting a morning show beloved by the black community and feared by the FCC. He had a local TV show, too; you can find a clip on YouTube, and it's outrageous.
Before that, he was in prison. The movie, which has been directed by Kasi Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou") is smart, conflicted, and immensely entertaining, and it's about that moment in African - American culture when the street voice became the only one saying anything close to the truth. "Wake up, goddammit!" was Petey's sign-on of choice decades before Spike Lee shouted sim ilar sentiments from the opening frames of "Do the Right Thing ."
Cheadle's character is only half of "Talk to Me," though. On the other side of the glass is Petey's producer, WOL program director Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor ), who has made every compromise his star has rejected. A kid from the projects who put himself through school, Hughes wears a suit, speaks crisply, and is determined to bring his people through the front door of the white-owned media.
Petey just looks at this guy and cackles. Actually, he scorns Dewey as "nothing but another white boy with a tan," "Mr. Tibbs," and several things not suitable for a family paper. Yet the two men are joined by a shared sense of mission. "I guess I need you to say the things I'm afraid to say," says Dewey, "and you need me to do the things you're afraid to do."
If that line sounds didactic (and it is), know that it comes at the end of a bar room pool game that's one of the most exhilarating movie sequences of the year, a scene so beautifully written, staged, played, and edited that you sit there in the dark with a fool grin on your face. The newly paroled Petey is playing the producer for a chance to get on the air -- he was a hit with the convicts as a prison DJ -- but they're actually competing to see who's the real black man. The scene ends with a satisfying bang, upending our assumptions about both characters.
The first half of "Talk to Me" is similarly alive with filmmaking skill and the rush of taking chances. The delight is infectious, buoyed by a soundtrack of irresistible soul classics that comment tartly on the narrative and by a cast that just won't quit. Cedric the Entertainer has a few choice scenes as a fellow DJ called The Nighthawk , whose melted-butter tones, like Barry White's , are at odds with his bulk. Martin Sheen turns the station owner into a figure of perplexed and intelligent decency.
Especially wonderful is Taraji P. Henson as Petey's longtime girlfriend Vernell , a vision in Foxy Brown period clothes with a pixie smile, lollipop legs, and a filthy mouth. After "Hustle & Flow ," this is at least the second movie Henson has stolen, and will Hollywood please
 do something about it?
After a while, "Talk to Me" pivots into a different movie. The turning point is the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, when black Americans fully understood that a change wasn't going to just come, that they'd have to take it. Cheadle plays Petey's on-air performance that night, when the disc jockey almost single-handedly calmed the rage of D.C. rioters, as furious and sorrowful and absolutely certain this wasn't what the Reverend wanted. It's a tricky tone and the actor nails it; when the other characters applaud Petey at the end of his stint, you feel they're praising Cheadle, too.
After this, the movie becomes obsessed with the theme of "keeping it real," which is Dewey's battle more than Petey's. (Not surprisingly, co-screenwriter Michael Genet is Hughes's son.) The producer learns a new sense of pride from his DJ's bluntness -- cue the afro and dashikis -- but he also thinks he can sell it to white America. He becomes Petey's manager, books him on the comedy circuit, and aims for the big time.
That's where he, and to a lesser extent the movie, get into trouble. How do you mass-market a voice of dissent? Dewey thinks he knows, but the deepening anxiety on Petey's face says it all. Maybe he looked into the future and saw what happened to Richard Pryor .
So Cheadle recedes from "Talk to Me," as Petey walks off "The Tonight Show" and dwindles into inconsequence (he died of cancer in 1984). Ejiofor, an extremely smart actor, does what he can to enliven Dewey's progress toward racial self-respect, but the character's too compromised. Worse, he's too dull. The movie bets on the big picture but puts its money on the wrong horse.
In a closing title, we learn that Dewey Hughes went on to buy WOL, which is now a cornerstone of Clear Channel Communications
 -- the faceless corporate behemoth that has successfully packaged individuality right off the airwaves. "Talk To Me" apparently wants us to think that's progress. I could tell you what Petey Greene might call it, but I can't print it.


         "Talk to Me," which stars Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor, hearkens to another era, to a time before shock jocks bestrode morning drive time like colossal blowhards. Cheadle plays Ralph Waldo "Petey" Greene, an ex-con turned Washington, D.C., radio and television talk-show host, beloved local icon and Howard Stern role model. Ejiofor plays the straight-laced Dewey Hughes, who put him on the air when nobody else would have. Their unlikely friendship and partnership, founded on a shared commitment to speak out against injustice, is the focus of director Kasi Lemmons' film, which observes the fervor of a bygone activist culture longingly, as if to ask, what's with everybody now?
 
 Greene and Hughes met in 1966 at the Lorton correctional facility, where Greene was serving a 10-year sentence and Hughes was paying regular visits to his brother Milo (Mike Epps). As part of a work program, Greene had been allowed to host a show from the prison radio station and discovered he had a talent and passion for it. Hughes was then the program director for KWOL, a small, D.C.-based R&B radio station.
 


         






   Eventually, Greene talked his way out of prison early, talked his way into a job as a morning-show host at KWOL and, after blowing his initial shot, commandeering the airwaves under threat of arrest. Whether these events transpired as depicted — flamboyant displays in the reception area, locking station manager and morning show DJ in their offices — is open to interpretation, but the upshot was that Hughes cemented his position in the business and Greene established himself as the voice of the "other" Washington, D.C., a beloved and galvanizing figure in the community.
 
 Most of the action of the film takes place in the late '60s and early '70s (Greene died of cancer in 1984) against the backdrop of the civil rights and antiwar movements, and Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou") makes liberal use of protest and riot footage, occasionally using it as a literal backdrop for Greene's on-air riffs.
 
 Part of what drew Lemmons to her subject was the contrast between Greene's uncensored candor, emblematic of the era, and the mealy mouthed timidity of today, so you don't begrudge her the occasional image mash-up, hammy though they sometimes are, or even the way she drives the message home at the movie and then walks it to the door.
 
 Mostly, Lemmons and screenwriter Michael Genet (Hughes' son) focus on the passionate and volatile friendship between Greene and Hughes, which Cheadle and Ejiofor (who have yet to make a false move between them) bring vividly to life.
 
 Other characters, such as Greene's flamboyant girlfriend Vernell (Taraji  P. Henson) and station owner E.G. Sonderling (Martin Sheen), are appealing but one-note, though Cedric the Entertainer and Vondie Curtis-Hall make funny, note-perfect appearances as the velvet-voiced, "quiet storm" late night DJ, Nighthawk, and the ousted chipper morning-show guy, Sunny Jim, respectively.
 
 But this is a love story, after all, so it makes sense that the others would recede indistinctly into the background. Cheadle's Greene is as heavy-lidded, mercurial, self-destructive and free-spirited as Ejiofor's Hughes is alert, focused and disciplined. Convinced at first that they have nothing in common, they eventually bond over their shared roots and commitment to the cause, and the marriage of their particular strengths creates something new and strange. If Cheadle and Ejiofor's command of the characters is compelling and precise before the friendship takes hold, it takes on another dimension afterward as we come to see them through the appreciative eyes of the other.
 
 The odd-couple relationship adds another layer as a lively argument on identity politics. The ongoing debate between Hughes and Greene also seemed to encapsulate a moment in African American history when identities were being redefined and roles debated.
 
 Like Greene, the straight-laced, be-suited Hughes grew up poor and disenfranchised, seeing his older brothers go to prison. Unlike Greene, he put himself through school hustling pool and studied poise and carriage under the nightly tutelage of Johnny Carson. If Greene was outrageous and impolitic, fearlessly speaking out against poverty and racism, the restrained and polished Hughes worked effectively within the system, making it possible for someone like Greene to get on the air in the first place.
 
 With its R&B soundtrack and footage of civil unrest, "Talk to Me" might seem to cover familiar ground. But as an intimate portrait of the complex, fruitful and extremely volatile friendship between trailblazing African American men whose daring came to redefine an industry, it's fresh and revelatory.

You can love Don Cheadle's acting and still feel that there's a pesky reticence to him, that he's too haunted by the ghosts of respectability to let go. In Boogie Nights , he played a guy who was a porn star and a stereo salesman, and he still came off as the one upright person in the movie; in Traffic  and Crash , his California lawmen had spines that were sticks of rectitude. Cheadle hasn't really taken a role and walked on the wild side  until Talk to Me , a rowdy, richly offbeat biopic that casts him as a trash-talking, hard-living hustler of a disc jockey who just happens to be fast and nasty enough to make himself into a star.
As Ralph Waldo ''Petey'' Greene Jr., who became a one-man inner-city media explosion in Washington, D.C., starting in the late '60s, Cheadle wears a mustache and an Afro that evoke Richard Pryor in his early heyday, and he's got a shoot your mouth off first and apologize later  ferocity that's Pryoresque, too. When Cheadle spits out the word motherf---er , it's with Pryor's percussive flair. Petey doesn't just say that word  he means  it. When we first see him, he's behind bars, doing an on-air rap for his fellow inmates, and the prison sets the stakes: Petey can say whatever he wants because he's got nothing to lose. On the street, he dresses in things like red velvet jackets with paisley lapels, and it's a testament to Cheadle's presence that he never looks anything but badass in those mack-daddy clown suits.
Being a DJ, says Petey, is the only thing he's good at that isn't against the law. To land a job at WOL, a local R&B station that has seen better days, he has to win over Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the slick, smart program director who, in a terrific pool-hall scene, is revealed to be a lot less of an Oreo than he appears. The first time that Petey goes on the air, he takes a hilarious swipe at Motown's Berry Gordy, and the only thing funnier is his apology. The station owner (Martin Sheen) orders him yanked, until he sees that Petey's candid rant is what the people want. It's the prattle of bars and barbershops  the folk wit of the streets that he turns into a DJ's patter.
Directed by the gifted Kasi Lemmons (Eve's Bayou ), Talk to Me  could have been Good Morning, Vietnam  in the ghetto. Instead, it digs into the relationship between Petey and Dewey, whose love/hate, street/suit tension expresses what the movie presents as the central emotional rift in African-American life. I wish Talk to Me  were less episodic, but the two actors are marvelous. The elegant, magnetic Ejiofor makes Dewey a complexly divided man, embodying the vast contradictions of a reformed player who models himself on Johnny Carson. Cheadle plays Petey as an antic hedonist, fueled by booze, rage, and fear: When he appears on The Tonight Show , it's a devastating sequence  a crossover dream turned nightmare  yet Petey's inability to be anyone but himself is the thing that gives him soul. That's the movie's audacity: It makes you see why his failure is essential to his success.

 In 1966, when we first meet them, Petey Greene (Don Cheadle) and Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) present an easy, obvious contrast. Dewey, rising fast in the management ranks of a Washington R&B radio station, favors trim suits and dark ties. When he speaks on the air, listeners are apt to mistake him for a white man. Petey, serving 10 years for armed robbery in a Virginia penitentiary, is a man of an altogether different — and, to Dewey, much lesser — sort. His speech is laced with profanities and put-downs, and he manages to look flashy even in prison, where he accessorizes his state-issued denims with bright red shoes and a flowery neckerchief.  Their subsequent friendship, which spans an era of social upheaval and fashion turmoil, is at the center of “Talk to Me,” Kasi Lemmons’s funny, earnest, affectionate new film. Ralph Waldo Greene, as Petey was called on his birth certificate, was a beloved figure in Washington’s African-American community from the late 1960s until his death in 1984 of cancer. A radio D.J., nightclub comedian and television host, he put himself forward as a no-nonsense voice of the streets, a funny, sometimes angry mix of trickster, prophet and provocateur. As portrayed by Mr. Cheadle, Petey Greene is a person of quick wit and tender heart, an irrepressible hustler whose fundamental integrity is never in doubt.  In its early scenes, the film, a long-gestating project made with the participation of the real Dewey Hughes and his son, Michael Genet (who conceived the story and shares screenwriting credit with Rick Famuyiwa), seems to be setting up Dewey and Petey as simple foils. When Petey, fresh from prison, arrives at Dewey’s station to claim the job he thinks was promised to him, the encounter plays out in bold sitcom strokes.  On one side is the uptight, upwardly mobile black man, eager to win favor with his even more uptight boss, E. G. Sonderling (Martin Sheen). On the other is Petey, rolling in on a tide of ghetto attitude, accompanied by his girlfriend, Vernell (Taraji P. Henson), a woman with a very big Afro and a very small dress.  This kind of standoff between hip and square — Sonderling purses his lips and says “What in blue blazes?”; Petey rolls his eyes and utters words you can’t say on the radio — was probably a cliché even in 1967. And of course Dewey, whom Petey calls Mr. Tibbs in mocking reference to Sidney Poitier’s role in “In the Heat of the Night,” is an easy target for blacker-than-thou derision. His demeanor and ambition mark him as an inauthentic black man, an Oreo, a sellout.  But “Talk to Me” starts out broad and schematic only to surprise you with its subtlety as it unfolds. Conveying the passage of time through the usual shorthand of clothes, hairstyles and vintage pop music, the movie nonetheless steers clear of the usual biopic conventions. Petey may be the charismatic, self-destructive center of attention — and Mr. Cheadle is as engaging and resourceful as ever — but the drama resides in his sometimes volatile, always closely observed partnership with Dewey. “You say the things I’m afraid to say,” Dewey remarks, “and I do the things you’re afraid to do.” While Petey brushes this off as greeting-card hooey, “Talk to Me” explores the idea of their symbiosis in a nuanced and insightful manner.  As soon as he takes the microphone as a morning disc jockey, Petey connects with his listeners, and his breakthrough moment comes when he helps to calm the city’s streets after the rioting that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dewey, who becomes Petey’s manager, pushes his friend and client toward ever bigger stardom.  His ambition causes a rift between them, and their relationship captures a basic tension within  African-American popular culture. Dewey, you might say, is eager to cross over, a desire represented by his dream of seeing Petey on “The Tonight Show” with Johnny Carson. Petey, for his part, is uncomfortable straying too far from the local public that sustains him. His mantra is “Keep it real.”  But to quote a song that appears in two versions on this movie’s superb soundtrack, compared to what? The sentimental way to tell the story would be to sneer at Dewey while painting Petey as an uncompromising hero. The filmmakers and the actors, thankfully, are too smart and too honest to go that route. While they pay homage to Petey’s militant, confrontational stance and to his hometown loyalty, they also respect Dewey’s discipline and his drive toward self-improvement. To its great credit, “Talk to Me” doesn’t ask the audience to choose a side, but rather invites us to appreciate the strengths and limitations of both men.  The result is a movie that offers uplift without phoniness, history without undue didacticism and a fair number of funny, dirty jokes. And Cedric the Entertainer in a plum-colored suit and Ms. Henson teetering on the brink of self- parody in platform shoes and skimpy skirts and never once surrendering her dignity.  “Talk to Me” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has abundant profanity, vulgar humor and sexual situations far beyond what the F.C.C. would approve.

Don Cheadle gets a role to shake loose and revel in with Petey Greene, the loose-cannon deejay hero of Kasi Lemmons' energetic biopic "Talk to Me," which alternates too deliberately between jaunty comedy and serious message-making. The more Petey is allowed to live and breathe as a '60s streetwise hustler who literally barges his way into a D.C. radio station, the better pic handles its various agendas. But as Petey becomes a symbol of black liberation, the movie turns obvious and parched. Focus' hopes for a summer counter-programmer will likely be only half-realized, with mild B.O. and fair ancillary biz.
A distinct shift from Lemmons' more classically mounted "Eve's Bayou," "Talk to Me" displays the helmer's range and taste for everything from broad ghetto comedy to two-hander drama to period storytelling. But this also exemplifies how pic juggles too many things at once, compounded by the paradox that the lighter passages actually carry more substance than the overly emphatic ones.
WOL-AM program director Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor, in characteristically superb form) first encounters Petey in the prison where Dewey's brother Milo (Mike Epps) is doing time, and where Petey does a daily in-house, free-form broadcast, dropping F-bombs right, left and center. Dewey suggests Petey look him up when he gets out, and, soon, Petey, ever the operator, uses his close ties to the warden to get an early release.
Assigned by owner E.G. Sonderling (Martin Sheen) to revive the station's sagging ratings and tired pop profile, Dewey decides morning guy Sunny Jim Kelsey (Vondie Curtis Hall) has to go, but he doesn't count on Petey bursting into the station with his loud and flamboyant g.f. Vernell (Taraji P. Henson).
When Petey's attempts to go through the front door fail, he stages a one-man picket of the station as "unfair," embarrassing Dewey in the eyes of the community and leading to his supposed big break. When Petey shows talent but comes off too raw and untrained, this particular American Dream would appear to be over.
Cheadle and Ejiofor carry the movie on their shoulders with gusto. Their valiant efforts during the sequences when Petey manages to get back on WOR (against Sonderling's express orders) and is a smash with listeners rep a fine example of great performances covering severe script issues.
Early on, Lemmons suggests radio broadcasting is barely contained chaos, with Dewey as the straight "Negro" keeping it together and Petey as the emerging face of a freer black-is-beautiful ethos. Together, according to "Talk to Me," they nearly revolutionize not just the airwaves, but D.C. itself. Petey's running monologue of streetwise soul and justice connects with locals, which proves to be a blessing when he's able to cool community anger and fears of a riot in the wake of Martin Luther King's assassination.
Pic is considerably less assured during these and other, grimmer sections, not only because the riot never feels like a real danger, but also because the shifting focus -- as Dewey tries to steer Petey's career into a multimedia business, culminating in an appearance on "The Tonight Show" -- is excessively on-the-nose, the stuff of trite showbiz tragedy.
Rarely, if ever, has Cheadle seemed so unleashed and uncontained as he does inside Petey's persona, playing him as a real-life id running rampant through the proper channels of pop culture. The funniest aspect of Cheadle's grand, profane portrayal is how his Petey openly announces himself as a con, seducing Dewey and the audience, and then looks shocked at his own success. This crafty bit of cocky vulnerability reps a truly astonishing perf.
A weaker actor playing Dewey would have merely reacted to Petey, and, indeed, as written, much of Dewey's role is set in Petey's long shadow. But Ejiofor is far too potent to stick to such parameters, crafting a character of fascinating depth and contradictions. Support from Sheen and a brief appearance by Cedric the Entertainer as a WOL deejay are solid, while Henson as Petey's g.f. with attitude is too much for the room.
Early, mid- and late '60s periods are rendered reasonably well by Warren Alan Young's production design, but Lemmons' two top collaborators are cinematographer Stephane Fontaine (Arnaud Desplechin's regular ace d.p.) and music supervisor Barry Cole. Latter constructs a blow-out soundtrack of great tunes from the era, including dazzling use of Sam Cooke's classic "A Change Is Gonna Come" and both Les McCann's original and Meshell Ndegeocello's fresh cover of Gene McDaniel's immortal "Compared to What," which the movie turns into an anthem for Petey.

Having ascended to genre supremacy, the biopic has long since reached its imaginative lowso much so that the banality of Talk To Me  is only half disappointing; at least it babbles clichés with conviction. Directed by Kasi Lemmons  (Eve's Bayou ) from a screenplay by Michael Genet  and Rick Famuyiwa , this earnest, ineffectual history lesson stars Don Cheadle  as Ralph Waldo "Petey" Green, an ex-con turned Washington, D.C., radio phenomenon who electrified Chocolate City in the 1960s with his streetwise populism. Chiwetel Ejiofor  co-stars as Dewey Hughes , a sympathetic producer at the complacent soul station WOL-AM; Martin Sheen  appears as The Man. Textured by ego trips, boozing, red velvet tuxedos, and a soundtrack jammed with rousing, if predictable hits of the era, Talk To Me lacks every kind of specificity (historical, psychological, socio-cultural) but redeems itself through the dedication of its Cheadlicious lead. As in the overrated Hotel Rwanda , Cheadle is a live wire in dead air, shimmering with vitalityand silk paisley blousesagainst his oppressively formulaic context.
