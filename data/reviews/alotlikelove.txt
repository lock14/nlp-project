A Lot Like Love
 takes place over the course of seven years, but it feels like real time. It�s as if the script (by actor Colin Patrick Lynch) were pinched from Richard Curtis� wastebasket: Strangers Oliver (Kutcher) and Emily (Peet) bump fuzz in an airplane lavatory and spend the rest of the film bantering cutely and coming thisclose
 to a real relationship, only to be thwarted by chance and putatively delightful misunderstandings. Will they get together? It�s hard to care, not because the answer is obvious � the answer is always obvious in the mass-market romantic comedy � but because the characters are so generic and tiresome that it�s like watching a long-form Taster�s Choice commercial punctuated with peppy AAA needle-drops, dorky montages, and creaky dialogue, delivered leadenly. ("Let go. Smile. You�re with me," the lovebirds entreat one another repeatedly.) These are people who stick things up their noses and spit water in restaurants to amuse one another, who chew with their mouths open for a laugh, who have tender moments while surrounded by product placement, who make continual reference to something called the "plan" (make money, buy a house, find the right person, create babies) without irony. They in no way resemble actual human beings; they are the chimera fabricated in story meetings at which takeout is served. There�s a wearisome coincidence waiting for them around every corner, and they�re surrounded by the kind of helpful meddling friends who flock about Bridget Jones. (One, a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy, calls her partner by the nickname "Sexy" � which is proof enough that these people exist only in movies.) When Oliver and Emily took off for a romantic interlude in Joshua Tree National Park, I scribbled in my notebook, "Are they going to be mauled by bears?" Sadly, this did not happen. When Oliver serenaded Emily in a scene, a small boy in the audience began wailing to his mother, "I don�t want to be here! I don�t want to watch this!" I could go on. Fortunately, Penn (the latter half of the Harold & Kumar
 duo) arrives as a dot-com asshole, puncturing the movie�s inflated air of cloying sweetness, and musician-actress Manning (who actually has a nice, scrappy quality) shouts repeatedly at Oliver, "You�re a dick!" I can buy Kutcher as the puppyish recent college graduate he plays as the film begins, but in a later scene with Emily, his pained declaration of "I�m almost 30!" brought titters from the audience. Peet, on the other hand, begins the film as a black-clad New York City punkish grrrl (albeit in a T-shirt for the Cult) and transmogrifies into a generic Brentwood singleton with yoga pants and Starbucks. The movie offers no explanations for this development aside from her association with a better class of men, which is evidently the sum total of female maturation. It�s tempting to blame the actors (who, shall we say, lack range?) for this debacle, but the whole production is simply as mediocre and half-baked as Hollywood gets.

There are people who find Ashton Kutcher's every doe-eyed smirk adorable. That would be the college girl in the sorority sweatshirt sitting behind me at the sneak preview for ''A Lot Like Love." There are people who find Ashton Kutcher intensely irritating, like a painful skin condition that just won't go away. That would be me.

The producers of this stillborn romantic comedy are betting there are many more college girls than there are testy movie critics, and they're doubtless correct. That doesn't change the cold, hard fact that their movie is a dog, with fleas.

''Love" doesn't have a plot so much as it has a concept, scribbled in crayon: Boy and girl meet cute and continue to meet cute for seven long years. During that time they bicker and spoon and date other people and move to other cities, but always, in the back of their heads, is the notion of this one person who might complete them if they could only get their acts and priorities together.

It's a good idea for a movie -- that movie being ''When Harry Met Sally," which came out in 1989. ''A Lot Like Love" is a lot like ''Harry," except that the new film's characters are grating, the dialogue inane, and the romance tedious.

''Love" gets off to a mildly rousing start when LA punkette Emily (Amanda Peet) spontaneously jumps the bones of yuppie-slacker Oliver (Kutcher) in the bathroom of a cross-continental flight. Emily wants nothing more than a quick shag, but Oliver tails her around downtown Manhattan and gets to know her, after a fashion. She scorns him as a mama's boy; he replies that he'll be successful in business and love, and dares her to call him in six years to prove it. End of Act 1.

Perversely, Act 2 begins only three years later, when Emily -- now a neurotic Los Angeles actress -- impulsively calls Oliver after a breakup with her boyfriend (Gabriel Mann, passing expressionlessly through the film like a visiting foreign dignitary). The couple seem prepared to connect, but now Oliver is moving to San Francisco to start up an Internet diaper-delivery service with partner Jeeter (Kal Penn).


That's right, Kumar from ''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" is here, and while ''Love" desperately needs the sort of withering scorn Penn can deliver, the movie sticks him in the best-pal role and forgets about him. Similarly, Ty Giordano offers a refreshing note of naturalism as Oliver's deaf brother, but the character's on hand merely as a signifier of the hero's depth. (Hollywood Rule No. 473: To give your lead character added sympathy, provide him with a friend or relative who has a physical impairment. Or with an ethnic minority. It's all the same.)

Oliver and Emily play relationship tag for a number of years, with hairstyles, period pop songs, and Emily's persona changing throughout. By the fourth act she's a successful photographer, and the only common thread is a flaky self-absorption that would have most men signaling for the check within minutes. Peet can be interesting in films like ''Igby Goes Down" and ''The Whole Nine Yards" -- she's a beauty who's pushy and doesn't care if it makes her look bad -- but the character's small-mindedness here defeats her. Either the filmmakers think it's charming when Emily tailgates an old lady driver and yells ''Get off the road, Grandma!," or they've just stopped caring.

But I'm not sure Pacino and Streep could do anything with Colin Patrick Lynch's dreadful screenplay, which mistakes attitude for wit and keeps setting up punch lines that never arrive, or with the flaccid direction by Nigel Cole (''Calendar Girls," ''Saving Grace").

As for Kutcher, the less said the better. He has yet to give a performance that isn't a dude-acious commentary on his own unwillingness to give a performance, and what once looked like slacker irony is more and more plainly lack of ability. Toward the end of ''A Lot Like Love," Oliver plays Emily a love song on a guitar; the scene seems to consciously ape the ending of last year's ''Before Sunset," except that Kutcher sings in a comic off-key warble that forestalls any actual commitment on the part of the characters or the audience. Like the title says, ''A Lot Like Love" is a romance for people who aren't remotely ready for the real thing.


         With realistic dialogue and no far-fetched misunderstandings, 'A Lot Like Love' bucks the genre considerably.If in fact it were true that modern life doesn't provide the obstacles that make for decent barriers to romance, then finding love would be as glitch-free as a smooth slide into bitterness. But the disappearance of traditional obstacles has only led to a rise in creative barricading. We have DIY love problems now, and Nigel Cole's "A Lot Like Love," written by Colin Patrick Lynch, has the decency to acknowledge them and deem them sufficient.
 
  Emily (Amanda Peet) and Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) first cross paths at the airport just before flying from L.A. to New York "seven years ago." It seems longer ago than that: Amanda is a grunge girl in combat boots with a weakness for guitarists, Oliver is a flop-haired doofus who dreams of starting a dot-com diaper delivery business. For twentysomethings of the era — or for her, anyway — their aesthetic differences are deal-breakers. Despite a tryst at 30,000 feet and a fun-filled day together in Manhattan, she more or less writes him off. Oliver, though more confident in his interest in Emily, has a five-year plan (you know the type) that doesn't include having a girlfriend until all his "ducks" are "in a row." They part ways, half-jokingly agreeing to settle their bet over whether Oliver's life will have gone exactly according to plan in seven years.
 


         






    From there, the movie brings them together sporadically, always on the cusp or aftermath of some major change. Emily calls Oliver three years later, after getting dumped by her slickster boyfriend, and they spend New Year's Eve together, but Oliver leaves for San Francisco the next day. Oliver shows up on Emily's doorstep a few years after that having been dumped by his 
shallow girlfriend, but his company is starting to take off, and so on. The story unfurls in short bursts erupting years and miles apart, so the time Oliver and Emily spend apart — that is, most of the time — gets reduced to the merest symbolic nutshells. Minor but pivotal characters, such as Emily's ex, Peter (Gabriel Mann), Oliver's ex, Bridget (Moon Bloodgood), and Emily's next
, Ben (Jeremy Sisto), whiz past like dodged bullets. (When Emily tells Oliver that she's met someone, I'd forgotten all about the guy she met in a record store a few scenes earlier.)
 
  Not that this wouldn't be a tricky story to assemble — but the script wastes valuable time on such creaky, "character development" tangents as Oliver's deaf brother (he even looks like the brother from "Four Weddings and Funeral") and Emily's dead mother — graveside moonings and filial tête-à-têtes could have been easily tossed aside to make room for more on Oliver and Emily's alternate love lives, which might have given the romance some kick. Or maybe not so easily. The deaf brother and dead mom devices do 
smack of studio script notes.
 
  Despite a title that sounds a lot like everything that's bland and forgettable about romantic comedies, "A Lot Like Love" bucks the genre considerably, never straining itself or trumping up the drama with far-fetched misunderstandings. Instead of forced comedy — you'll be gratified to learn that nobody does the "butter churn" or 
"the robot" at any point throughout the film (dolce miracolo!
) — the movie goes for bittersweet romance in the vein of "Manhattan." If the script isn't as well-structured as it could be, the dialogue is refreshingly natural. Kutcher is surprisingly well cast as the awkward, somewhat dorky Oliver, and Peet is charming and charismatic without being cloying or artificial. Together they drum up some believable, low-key chemistry and an easy, funny rapport that is pleasant, if not transcendent, to watch. Emily's character, in particular, visibly matures over the course of the film, and watching her, you believe that it would take her seven years to realize that what she feels for Oliver is love. Despite their sporadic attempts to get together, they're realistically passive when it comes to grand gestures or big decisions.
 
  Beautifully shot by John de Borman and designed by Tom Meyer, "A Lot Like Love" never veers into visual fantasy and avoids defining its characters (excessively) by their sofas. Los Angeles, in particular, looks lovely and real, and it's quietly thrilling to watch Emily and Oliver haunt specific, identifiable corners of the city and environs. The dialogue and some of the situations (if not the general thrust of the story) tend toward contrivance at times, but despite its flaws, "A Lot Like Love" is a winning, unassuming little movie that, despite an obviously lush budget, avoids many of the pitfalls of the traditional big-budget romantic comedy.

People in the first blush of romance can get a little satisfied with themselves (they develop an I'm worth it! glow). That attitude reaches a painful state of insularity in A Lot Like Love . Ashton Kutcher, with his studious dearness, and Amanda Peet, with her shark-grinned hauteur, may not set off sparks, exactly, but they have the chemistry of star-on-the-rise narcissism. They're a mutual admiration society passing themselves off as lovebirds. In what may be the world's first zipless meet-cute scene, Emily (Peet), a punkette who treats men like objects, lunges for Oliver (Kutcher), a shaggy sweetheart with an alt-rock wardrobe, by squeezing into an airplane lavatory with him, despite the fact that they've barely spoken. Over the next seven years, he cuts his hair and starts an Internet company, she knocks the postfeminist chip off her shoulder, and they continue to meet cute, flirt cute, and wistfully say goodbye cute.
So what's standing in the way? For one thing, they live in different cities and appear incapable of carrying on the sort of conversation that involves things like phone numbers, frequent flier miles, and, you know...plans. They fall into other relationships  bad ones. Yet each new reunion leads them to a fresh apotheosis of puppy love. There's the tee-hee wordless date in the Asian restaurant, the nude desert photo session, the Say Anything  climax in which Oliver wails along with his guitar. (No scene has ever made you yearn so much for a boom box.) A Lot Like Love  is a lot like a romantic comedy, except that all that's keeping these two kids apart is the trivially insufferable movie they're in.

oday's ontological question: what is Ashton Kutcher? A party boy, a girl-toy, a smirking overage pinup for the drooling underage set or a would-be serious actor caught in a welter of lazy tics and the smog of fame? Having missed out on working with stellar directors like Cameron Crowe and Steven Soderbergh, both of whom have turned pretty faces into real actors, the inquiring dude from "Dude, Where's My Car?" has largely sustained his remarkably high profile with a vulgar cable television show ("Punk'd") and a babe of a certain age (Demi Moore), yet another celebrity without portfolio. All this passed through my mind as I began watching the new romantic comedy "A Lot Like Love" in which Mr. Kutcher stars alongside Amanda Peet, a fine young actress with a perilously long list of rotten movies to her name. But the dark thoughts didn't linger because, as it happens, "A Lot Like Love" isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. If nothing else, "A Lot Like Love" is a pleasant reminder of a Hollywood time, seemingly long gone, when boy met girl in a midlevel romantic comedy without arty aspirations (half of Woody Allen's "Melinda and Melinda") or low-brow yucks (paging Brittany Murphy). Directed by Nigel Cole, who previously steered the ingratiating British comedies "Calendar Girls" and "Saving Grace," and written by the actor Colin Patrick Lynch, "A Lot Like Love" tells the story of a would-be couple who fail to get it - and themselves - together time and again. The story opens seven years ago,   when Oliver (Mr. Kutcher) spies Emily (Ms. Peet) at a Los Angeles airport. Wearing a scowl and a plaid miniskirt that gives her the look of a delinquent schoolgirl, Emily seems like trouble, which makes her irresistible to the wide-eyed Oliver. Booked on the same flight to New York, the two join the mile-high club in an airplane bathroom, but while he sees their assignation as a potential beginning, she sees it as the end. Later, the two briefly hang out in the city, even pausing next to a Manhattan bridge, in apparent homage to Mr. Allen's famous romantic comedy,  then part ways, laying the foundation for a lengthy hit-and-run almost-relationship. Structured as a series of chapters that take place at a turning point in each character's life, the story moves from seven years in the past to three years then two, until it finally catches up to the present. As time passes, sometimes a bit too leisurely, Oliver and Emily separately try to find themselves with different lovers and jobs. She tries to make it as an actress while he struggles to get a silly Internet diaper service (BabyRush.com) into profitability. Life goes on, but tinged with a wistful melancholy that is usually absent from American romantic comedy. Mr. Kutcher and Ms. Peet have radically dissimilar screen styles  - she pushes you away, he pulls you in -  they shouldn't make sense together. But they do, at times very nicely. Smiling doesn't seem to come easily to the spiky Ms. Peet, who brings intensity to her character and real acting chops to the film. Unlike his co-star, Mr. Kutcher can't yet put across heavier emotions; he's still better for giggles and goofs. But the actor has enough natural charm to hold the screen without effort and, more interestingly, can tap right into a quintessential American type  - the beautiful hayseed. It's a type familiar from, say, the character of Joe Buck in "Midnight Cowboy" and one that the actor Owen Wilson raised to an art form in Wes Anderson films like "Bottle Rocket" and  "The Royal Tenenbaums." The male equivalent of the dumb blonde, the beautiful hayseed always has a core innocence that can come awfully close to stupidity but  also serves to make the character far less dangerous than those good looks might suggest. One of the best things about "A Lot Like Love" is that this is one of the few mainstream romantic comedies in memory in which innocence isn't a sucker's game. Part of what keeps Oliver and Emily in each other's orbit, despite the myriad complications, is that they never become captive to cynicism or morph into alien beings in some urban "lifestyle"  fantasy. Seven years into this romance, Emily was still driving a wreck, Oliver was still struggling and, against all expectation, I was still happy to be along for the ride. "A Lot Like Love" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some discreet partial nudity, sexual situations and mild adult language.

Ashton Kutcher's second romantic comedy of the spring is far more appealing than "Guess Who" -- and pairs him with a beguiling Amanda Peet -- but it's also more difficult to market, featuring a nondescript premise and almost languid pace. In essence, British director Nigel Cole has brought a breezy arthouse sensibility to this tale of fated love, which proves pleasant company but doesn't offer a lot of flourishes to highlight in a 30-second TV spot. As such, pic's happiest ending should be as a rental, although favorable word of mouth could yield some surprise box office bounty.
The movie's structural conceit is intriguing but also episodic enough to be somewhat confining. Beginning "seven years ago," we meet just-graduated Oliver (Kutcher) and Emily (Peet) when she impulsively inducts him into the mile-high club. The two spend an afternoon together, but his interest in extending the relationship is cut short when Emily warns him that to pursue things further would "ruin it."
Three years later he's pursuing his entrepreneurial dreams when Emily rings him up in search of a New Year's Eve date after being dumped by a boyfriend. The relationship thus continues to unfold in one- or two-year intervals, each time finding them at different places in their lives, counting down to a present that one needn't have seen "When Harry Met Sally" to anticipate.
Yet as familiar as that sounds and mostly feels, Cole ("Calendar Girls") milks considerable charm and unforced laughs from his leads, whose natural performances and easy rapport make for a hard-to-resist combination. "You and I will never become a thing," a punked-out Emily tells Oliver after their first tryst, and if it's pretty obvious that's untrue, it's still rather fun watching them make it so.
It would help, no doubt, if the well-cast supporting players registered more strongly, but at its core this is a two-character piece, and Colin Patrick Lynch's screenplay labors a bit to keep the two apart, if only to keep putting them back together. That includes encounters in New York and Los Angeles, as well as Oliver's stint launching a dot-com in San Francisco, the underlying thread being whether he can incorporate love into his carefully plotted ambitions.
Nevertheless, there's a gentle quality to the film that's too rare these days -- a tone aided immeasurably by Alex Wurman's score and a fine song soundtrack. Emily and Oliver's impromptu rendition of Chicago's "If You Leave Me Now," in fact, yields one of the movie's brighter moments -- one of two occasions in which Kutcher demonstrates that he should stick to his day job.
Granted, "A Lot Like Love" is a lot like any number of romantic comedies, but there should always be room for another good one, even if it follows a bassackward and well-beaten path from "Seven years ago" to "Happily ever after."

At long last love: Kutcher and Peet take forever to connect
A Lot Like Love  exemplifies the happiness-deferred romance, in which two friends-but-should-be-paramours repeatedly convene, separate, and reconvene over several years, finally staying together only after feature run-time has elapsed. Skimming through lonely stretches and careerist angst, the movie focuses on incidents that threaten the final hookup. But the chemistry between diaper salesman Ashton Kutcher  and photo hound Amanda Peet  is so off that the pairing scans as an alienation effectone enhanced by their age difference, as well as Peet's resemblance (in her goth, graduate-age New York scenes) to an unwaxed Demi Moore . The banter soon develops a rhythm: Hurting from a breakup, Peet gets too drunk to nuzzle and Kutcher doesn't complain; years later, on a car trip, Kutcher whines about his ex and Peet shrugs it off. Interjections from perennial second bananas Kathryn Hahn  (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ) and Kal Penn  (winning even when not conjuring vivified bags of pot) generate the only sparks.
