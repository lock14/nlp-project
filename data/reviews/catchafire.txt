Australian director Noyce continues to explore the havoc and repercussions caused by white interlopers toward indigenous peoples in this straightforward account of real-life black South African activist Patrick Chamusso (Luke) and white Boer police agent Nic Vos (Robbins), who hunts him with Terminator
-like zeal. Of course, one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist, and in 1980s Johannesburg, the demarcation between the two was particularly vague (to the ruling whites, anyway). When law-abiding oil-refinery foreman Chamusso � and later his beautiful, apolitical wife, Precious (Mbuli) � is rounded up and tortured by Vos' men in the wake of a botched bombing plot, this mild-mannered family man discovers untapped wells of transformative vengeance and revolutionary fervor in his veins. He promptly joins then imprisoned Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and exits the country, returning only after his Soviet-sponsored warfare skills have been honed to a razor's edge. Catch a Fire
 benefits from some stellar performances, particularly those of its two leads. Chamusso, who is depicted as both a hero and as a flawed man who keeps a big secret from his loving wife, comes off as something of an activist archetype: the ordinary man caught up in the extraordinary riptide of his nation's turbulent history. Robbins, despite the fact that he's playing a man who easily could have come off as a sadistic bastard (the torture of both innocent and not-so-innocent South Africans plays an emotionally critical role throughout the film), imbues chilly Vos with the vagaries of self-doubt, however slight, ultimately rendering him as ensnared in history's pull as his quarry. It's always odd to see Robbins, a political activist in his own right, playing at villainy (see Arlington Road
, Bob Roberts
), but here he descends into the role so thoroughly that the lopsided smile becomes less a notation of cockeyed boyishness than a treacherous Cheshire smirk. The impossibly catchy "revolutionary songs" of the time (which sounded, to white ears, like nothing more than cheery workers' tunes � the South African version of "Hi Ho, Hi Ho" � but were, in reality, a cunning way to transmit information and rally the revolutionary spirit) and some well-placed Bob Marley buoy this period film. Catch a Fire
's only failure is its inability to provide a larger context for the events it depicts. That said, if you already know the lyrics to UK ska outfit the Specials' "Free Nelson Mandela," you'll do fine. Others may want to stop off at Wikipedia's ANC page before catching this particular fire.



Phillip Noyce's "Catch a Fire" shares its name with the classic Bob Marley record. The record is better, but the movie, which is set in apartheid-era South Africa, strives to be as politically agitated and impassioned.
Noyce is the sort of director who gets better with age. Even if his taste for action hasn't changed, it's certainly matured. The brute force of, say, "Patriot Games" was deepened with conscience and soul in "Rabbit-Proof Fence" and "The Quiet American," his two previous films. In "Catch a Fire" Noyce has caught the holy spirit. The movie is a thriller that wants to lift you up.
Written by Shawn Slovo, the film tells the real-life story of political prisoner-turned-freedom fighter Patrick Chamusso, whom Derek Luke plays with smiley contentment interrupted by fits of despair. Patrick is probably a decent man, but when the film calls for righteous fury, Luke brings nothing but decency to the part.
Patrick is an oil refinery foreman who had avoided getting mixed up in any anti-apartheid business. Life is fine for him, his wife, Precious (Bonnie Mbuli), and their children. One night, driving home from a soccer match with the youth team he coaches, Patrick witnesses the refinery on fire. The police nab, torture, and jail Patrick and two of his black co-workers. And when Patrick won't cop to the charge, the police do the same to Precious until he confesses, even though he'd taken the day off from work for the match and to visit the mother of another of his children, whom his quick-tempered wife knows nothing about.
The lead investigator on the case, Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), thinks the confession is bogus and lets Patrick go. But the damage has been done. Shedding his apolitical nature, Patrick joins the African National Congress and heads to Angola for an education in victimless terrorism. He emerges with a plot to blow up the same refinery, which was a symbol of the nation's economic inequality.
Despite being set in the early 1980s, "Catch a Fire" functions best as a movie of our moment, when torture, indefinite detention, and questions of legal representation are in the news. Patrick is abused into becoming the terrorist he tried not to be. But Noyce and Slovo, whose father was the rare white member of the then-outlawed ANC, have a tough time gaining any dramatic traction from the parallels the movie implies. They even attempt to make someone complex of Robbins's glowering apartheid colonel, a man whose senses of patriotism and morality are at odds. But Vos's intent is confused. He lets Patrick go, yet insists his two daughters learn to shoot guns. (The training comes in handy.) "We're the underdog," he says. "We're the ones under attack."
The attack is set to a beat. "Catch a Fire" relies on symbolic musical eruptions rather than direct political urgency to carry it along. There's enough marching through the streets with flags waving and fists in the air to qualify a number of scenes as production numbers. Obviously, protest songs imbued the anti-apartheid movement, and you get the sense that the movie wanted to approximate the "musical stampedes" Marley once sang about. It's a noble try, but because those moments seem detached from the story's driving action, they also feel glib.
The movie's final shot undermines its toughness, too. Luke and the real Chamusso, who now runs an orphanage for kids with AIDS and HIV, dribble a soccer ball together. A nice moment for the scrapbook, perhaps, but it makes " Catch a Fire" feel like the mawkish tribute it worked hard not to be.


         "Catch a Fire" sounds like an awfully familiar story, and in some ways it is. Movies on the nightmare that was South Africa under the apartheid system and the heroic efforts made to resist it are hardly new, and it is difficult to avoid a sight-unseen dismissal of this latest example as too familiar and too late. Which would be a mistake.
 
  What that analysis doesn't count on, though this story is way more than twice told, is that it has never been told by Derek Luke. The young American actor gives such an intense, passionate performance as South African Patrick Chamusso that he just about dares you not to be involved with the tale he is telling.
 


         






    Also true is that stories of South African resistance, like stories about the Holocaust, are so various and so simultaneously disturbing and heartening that they bring a built-in viewing interest with them.
 
  Yes, as written by Shawn Slovo, some elements of Chamusso's story feel facile, even schematic. But despite the occasional blip, when Luke's performance is joined to the confident direction of veteran Phillip Noyce ("Rabbit-Proof Fence," "The Quiet American"), "Catch a Fire" does not fail to ignite.
 
  More than that, this story set in South Africa a quarter of a century in the past turns out to have pointed parallels to the world situation today. The use and value of questionable interrogation techniques, the arrogance of those in power and how those elements combine to politicize innocents and create opposition where none existed before are all touched on here.
 
  After a brief prologue set in 1991, "Catch a Fire" spends most of its time in 1980, when Patrick was a cheerful young South African who gave the political situation in his country not so much as a second thought.
 
  Happily married to the beautiful Precious (Bonnie Henna), with two young daughters and his mother to support, Patrick is a classic go-along-to-get-along guy, fully engaged by his family, his love of soccer and his job as a foreman at the critical Secunda oil refinery.
 
  In fact, Patrick is shown having such a good time at a wedding that it's clear something bad is going to happen. Driving home, he is stopped at a police roadblock set up after a bombing and needlessly humiliated in front of his family.
 
  Intercut with scenes of Patrick's life and work are glimpses of the public and private Col. Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), a member of the Police Security Branch's anti-terrorism squad. The colonel, who considers his country and his family to be in immediate danger from the Moscow communists he is sure are running the African National Congress, is both proud of his job and quite good at it.
 
  In movie terms it's inevitable that the paths of the these two men will cross, and that is what happens when a bomb goes off at the Secunda refinery and Patrick is arrested as the terrorist who did the deed.
 
  "Catch a Fire" has taken pains to show that Patrick is innocent and also to reveal the glitch in his personal life that compromises his alibi. The colonel, a specialist in mind games who treats suspects like lab animals to be manipulated, is sure he's got his man and acts accordingly.
 
  Robbins does as well as anyone could playing the equivalent of the sympathetic Nazi, but despite obvious attempts to humanize him, the colonel's emotional range as a man firmly on the wrong side of history is finally too narrow to allow for a fully realized character.
 
  Derek Luke, on the other hand, best known for his Independent Spirit Award-winning lead performance in "Antwone Fisher," brings a maturity, gravity and even fury to his richest role to date.
 
  It is difficult to say whether it was intentional or not, but to see how the techniques of state-sanctioned torture turn this innocent into a revolutionary activist surely has a message for those in power today.
 
  Adding this to Forest Whitaker's marvelous performance as Idi Amin in "The Last King of Scotland," fall 2006 has turned into a season of African American actors doing great work in African roles. We should all be grateful it has.

Although we're freely encouraged to draw parallels to the making of present-day insurgents, the events dramatized in the sleekly tidied-up biopic Catch a Fire  are specific to South Africa in 1980, when desperate white-minority defenders of apartheid were employing outrageous tactics to subdue the country's increasingly politicized black majority. That's when Patrick Chamusso (Derek Luke), a cautious, resolutely apolitical black oil-refinery worker who saved his cheering for his son's soccer team, first felt the flames: Wrongly suspected of sabotage on the job, he became the unyielding obsession of antiterrorism investigator Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), a religious family man himself who, in his misguided zeal to defend a crumbling, racist way of life, lit the match that ignited Chamusso's radicalism. Enough harassment, disruption, abuse  including the torture of Chamusso's wife (Bonnie Henna)  and the once-docile citizen did molt into an insurgent, the very rebel Vos and his kind feared in the first place. (The real Chamusso spent a decade in prison.)
It's a sign of apartheid wounds healing and moviegoing expectations maturing that Catch a Fire  is as morally complex as it is  and that I wish it were even more rigorous; perhaps Shawn Slovo, the daughter of famous white South African  activists (she told her murdered mother's story in A World Apart ), was not the best screenwriter for the job of grappling with ambiguity. At any rate, Robbins tamps Vos into a muted man who can never be written off as a cartoon devil, and Luke, in a passionate performance reminiscent of his work in Antwone Fisher , doesn't hide Chamusso's flaws. With the same affinity for stories of culture clash he showed in The Quiet American  and Rabbit-Proof Fence , director Phillip Noyce embraces the tale with gusto, lighting up a picture that is as much a taut action saga as it is a cautionary history lesson.

 The past collides with the present in “Catch a Fire,” the story of a man who was simultaneously hailed as a freedom fighter and damned as a terrorist. The director Phillip Noyce, working from a screenplay by Shawn Slovo, revisits the ordeal of Patrick Chamusso, an ordinary black South African who, after being wrongly accused of crimes against the racist government in the early 1980’s, became a foot soldier in the war against apartheid. It’s a film that wants to play  as if it were ripped from today’s headlines, but has been shredded into near incoherence.  The appealing young American actor Derek Luke (the heartbreak kid in “Antwone Fisher”) plays Patrick, a family man who works as a foreman at a fuel refinery some 80 miles southeast of Johannesburg. Avowedly apolitical, Patrick goes along to get along with his white bosses and black colleagues, earning decent-enough wages to support his two daughters, taciturn mother-in-law and well-named wife, Precious (Bonnie Henna), a beautiful pixie who yearns for better furniture for their small home. When white soldiers stop the family on a dusty highway, ostensibly to search for saboteurs, Patrick quickly raises his hands in a gesture of accord. For him, cooperation means survival, no matter how dehumanizing.  His awakening comes in the aftermath of a guerrilla attack on the refinery. Along with two other workers, Patrick is hauled off by the police, who are led by the vicious Col. Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), accused of espionage and subjected to appalling torture. For a man like Vos, whose dedication to the racist regime seems to border on the religious, the color of Patrick’s skin has already marked him as guilty. But in trying to soften Patrick up, using barbaric methods that Mr. Noyce reproduces in squirmingly vivid detail, the police only harden his heart and his resolve. The man spirited away, blindfolded, brutalized and never officially accused bears seemingly little resemblance to the casualty who eventually stumbles back home.  In its rough outline, “Catch a Fire” has all the makings of a gripping tale. Soon after he is released by the police, Patrick ends up first in neighboring Mozambique and then Angola, where he sings songs of freedom under the auspices of the African National Congress. He also learns to march in place and, alongside other anti-apartheid fighters, echo the chant of “Kill the Boer Soldier!” The pulse-quickening music and the righteousness of the anti-apartheid cause might have made this revolutionary fervor feel terribly rousing if the film’s anemic politics and calamitously overwrought editing didn’t, at regular intervals, force you out of the story and down some exceedingly distracting avenues of thought, like: what would it mean if you replaced the word Boer with American?  This nasty game of substitution is all too easy to play in “Catch a Fire,” partly because the film fails to dig into the specifics of Patrick’s story or that of South Africa, and partly because the filmmakers don’t seem to have much faith in the audience’s ability to tell the good guys in this story from the bad. This, at least, seems the most charitable explanation for a scene in which one member of the African National Congress announces, as much to the last row in the movie theater as to the other characters, “We don’t kill indiscriminately.” For those hard of hearing, the same message is more or less repeated when Patrick, newly anointed Hot Stuff, straps on some explosives to do his part for the cause.  Mr. Noyce, whose career ranges from hack work like “The Bone Collector” to thoughtful efforts like “The Quiet American,” knows how to keep the action in high gear. In “Catch a Fire,” however, the action doesn’t just move; it rushes with such chaotic speed that the scenes don’t have time to develop. They play like commercials for a film that never materializes, as if someone had tried to fix a problem in the editing and forgotten to take a breath amid the slicing and dicing. Despite being reduced to hieroglyphs of gesture and grimace, Mr. Luke’s and Mr. Robbins’s performances nonetheless suggest a more interesting story than the one here, even if the cross-cutting that often brings them together does much to tear the film apart.  “Catch a Fire” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has graphic and suggestive violence, including scenes of torture.

Director Phillip Noyce capably applies the polished technique of his '90s Hollywood action films to the sort of political material that has attracted him of late in "Catch a Fire." But the question nags as to what pressing need there is, 25 years after the fact, for a thriller that hinges on apartheid in South Africa when there are so many new pressing and pertinent political and cultural issues. Stories of resistance to oppression will never become obsolete, but this feels like a picture that should have been made a long time ago, creating a tough marketing challenge to reignite much public interest in this particular cause.
Pic tells the true story of Patrick Chamusso, an apolitical oil refinery foreman who, during a period spanning 1980-81, was radicalized after having been wrongly accused, imprisoned and tortured for a plant bombing, then carried out a successful sabotage mission of his own that landed him in a cell on Robben Island for a decade.
The would-be relevance of the tale today lies in its account of a home-grown terrorist, a citizen awakened by intolerable conditions to activism and unsuspected extremes in his own behavior. But the situation born of apartheid was very specific of the local phenomenon of 3 million whites lording it over 25 million blacks, so it would be very difficult to apply the rationale for terrorism used here to the conditions provoking it elsewhere today.
Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher") engagingly plays Patrick, whose good work and ability to keep his nose down has resulted in a quick rise up the ladder at the Secunda oil refinery in rural South Africa. He's also popular as a kids' team soccer coach. But when the oil installation is bombed, Patrick, suspected of having given access to the outlawed African National Congress, is detained at an anti-terrorist interrogation center and grilled by Security Branch Colonel Nic Vos (Tim Robbins).
For what it's worth, Nic is not portrayed as a simple monster. A family man who, like Patrick, has two daughters, he is soft-spoken, thoughtful and, in a nice touch, even invites Patrick to join his family for a Sunday meal. The wrinkle in the plot is that Patrick does not want to confess to his true whereabouts on the night of the bombing because it would reveal his adulterous relationship, something that could destroy his family.
But when his wife, Precious (Bonnie Henna), is herself arrested and tortured, Patrick crosses the line. Leaving his family behind, he returns to his native Mozambique to join and train in the MK, or military wing, of the ANC, run by Joe Slovo, the late father of present screenwriter Shawn Slovo. When the first cell is attacked by South African troops (whites wearing blackface, no less), Patrick moves on to Angola for further training before surreptitiously returning to Secunda to attempt a daring mission by himself.
Pic downplays the communist backing of these ANC activities, attributing that view only to Nic, and can't help but slip into thriller gear once Patrick undertakes his solo commando raid on the facility he knows so intimately. Given the current distance, a more dispassionate presentation of the same events might have emphasized both the complexity and the sadness of the situation on all sides; as with most other screen representations of South Africa, however, the emotion attached to the injustice is paramount.
Luke is winning as Patrick, an obviously sympathetic figure who appears in real-life docu footage at the end running the Two Sisters orphanage where he and his wife have foster-parented 80 orphans. Robbins is almost too subdued as the increasingly conflicted heavy, and the American thesps evince variable accent problems.
Local production elements are strong, as the natural sights and sounds of Africa have been vibrantly captured.

There's a scene about halfway through Catch a Fire  during which freedom fightersmen and women, each boasting such nicknames as "Pete My Baby" and "Hot Stuff"are being trained at an African National Congress  safe house in Mozambique . Their ranks consist of South Africans who've been politicized by cruel life under apartheid rule, where, at any moment, they can be snatched from their homes and beaten for crimes they're only suspected of having committed. In Mozambique, these regular folks become reluctant soldiers. "Are you ready to die?" barks their commander. He repeats the question, over and over. In unison, they all finally and forcefully shout, "Yes!"
Director Phillip Noyce  initially considered removing the scene. He fretted that perhaps it would be misinterpreted in "our current context," by which he means he was worried that audiences would think he was trying to compare South Africans brutalized by apartheid with suicide bombers martyring themselves in the name of religious fundamentalism. The South Africans did not want to diethey didn't strap bombs to themselves and walk into crowded marketplacesbut were prepared to. And so the scene was left in.
Yet no matter its intention, Catch a Fire  can't help but be viewed as a metaphor. A true story about the wrongful imprisonment and prolonged beatings that led to the radicalization of Patrick Chamusso  (Derek Luke ) in South Africa , it also feels at home in the company of The War Within  and Paradise Now , two films that asked the audience not to empathize with terrorists, but to understand a little of what drives them to suicide.
When first we see him, Chamusso is a foreman at the Secunda oil refinery. He has a wife, Precious (Bonnie Henna ), and two kidsand, a few miles away, a mistress with whom he has another child. He's lived his whole life keeping his mouth shut and his head down. He forces his mother-in-law to turn down ANC radio broadcasts; he defers to white police officers, referring to them as "boss"; he reprimands his own people for using whites-only facilities, if only to keep the authorities off his own back.
But when the Secunda plant is partially destroyed, Patrick's arrested, detained, and severely beaten by thugs who work for Colonel Nic Vos  (Tim Robbins ), a fictional representation of two officers who nearly killed Chamusso during his nine months in prison. Vos is more monster than man, though Noyce and screenwriter Shawn Slovo  (whose parents were two of South Africa's most beloved anti-apartheid activists) try to keep him from slipping into gross caricature. We're meant to see him as a man merely doing his duty and protecting his family.
In the end, Catch a Fire  plays like some weird hybrid on the crazy-quilt filmography of Phillip Noyce, which includes small productions made in his native Australia and the Sharon Stone  sexcapade Sliver . What it's definitely not is the standard-issue movie about apartheid; there's no white protagonist, no pale-faced hero riding in on his high horse to save the oppressed black man. It's the story of Patrick Chamusso, who intended no harm till harm was done to him. Fact is, he could be just about anyone anywhere South Africa, the Middle East, right next door.
