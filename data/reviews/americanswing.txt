A shrewdly made documentary about the rise and fall of Plato's Retreat, the infamous Manhattan sex club of the '70s and '80s.   A lot of the patrons were suburban schlubs, and the movie does justice to their odd... normality. The least classy person there  was owner Larry Levenson, a nudnick who  made the nightly bacchanals feel as friendly   and about as sexy  as a bar mitzvah. American Swing  drolly evokes this Romper Room of middle-class exhibitionism, with its petri dish of a swimming pool and its icky lasagna- and-chicken buffet. Plato's Retreat was a buffet of bodies, and the film catches the moment America could think that was tasty. A–

 “A bucket of worms.” That is one eyewitness description in Mathew Kaufman and Jon Hart’s documentary “American Swing” of the orgiastic inner sanctum known as the mattress room in Plato’s Retreat, the notorious Manhattan swingers’ club that opened in January 1977 and closed on New Year’s Eve in 1985. A vintage clip in the documentary, which is based on a 2002 article by  Mr. Hart in  The New York Times, confirms that image. The sea of naked bodies observed from a middle distance resembles nothing so much as a heaving sea of termites.  This fleeting glimpse of a mass orgy is the only genuinely disturbing image in “American Swing,” which interweaves reminiscences of onetime patrons with grainy, bleached-out scenes of party life inside the club at various points in its history along with the story of its founder, Larry Levenson. At the peak of the club’s popularity, Mr. Levenson, who boasted of having sex with as many as 10 women a night, was nicknamed the King of Swing.  In clips from television interviews with Phil Donahue and David Susskind, Mr. Levenson comes across as a cheerfully messianic promoter of orgy-porgy freedom and enlightenment.  Like the owners of Studio 54, which flourished during the same era, Mr. Levenson and two other owners were  convicted of  tax evasion in 1981. After serving three years in Allenwood Federal Prison, he returned to Plato’s, which in 1980 had relocated from the Ansonia  on the Upper West Side to a warehouse on West 34th Street. By this time its novelty had faded, and it had become a hub of prostitution. The AIDS epidemic was the final nail in the coffin. Mr. Levenson fell on hard times and died in January 1999.  Although “American Swing” pointedly goes out of its way to include positive testimonials from several women who patronized the club, it leaves you feeling queasy. Memories of hot times, after all, are just that: memories.

"American Swing" memorializes "the poor man's Playboy Mansion," the late-'70s/early-'80s Manhattan sex club Plato's Retreat. This flashback to one of the sexual revolution's symbolic highlights and flameouts can't help but grab attention, abetted by recollections of assorted former staff and regulars (who are more entertaining than the celebrities interviewed). That said, Mathew Kaufman and Jon Hart's docu is just functionally assembled, lacking the style or larger social context that distinguished similar studies like "Inside Deep Throat." Also, poor quality of early vidcam clips means this planned Magnolia release will look considerably better on the smallscreen.
While gay bathhouses flourished in 1977, there was no regular public venue for hetero swingers until Larry Levenson decided to open one. He reveled in his role as "King of Swing" for "free-thinking, free-loving young couples." The mostly very ordinary, working-class Noo Yawkahs who comprised Plato's core clientele (and employees) recall its nonjudgmental, liberating atmosphere. But by 1984, the party was over, due to murky finances, IRS investigation, NYPD busts, AIDS and other factors. Anecdotes, archival materials et al. are all amusing, but the pic could have used more packaging and editorial invention.

A het-humping parallel to 2005's Gay Sex in the 70s , Matthew Kaufman and Jon Hart's doc on Larry Levenson's raunchy hideaway, Plato's Retreat, unwittingly reminds us that homos were getting it on to much better music back then. Levenson, a genial, schlubby horndog from Long Island (like several of his establishment's habitués), operated the XXX playpen from 1977 to 1985, first in the basement of the Ansonia and then at a warehouse on 34th Street and Tenth Avenue. Talking heads (sexperts, journalists, patrons, Plato's staff, Ed Koch) recall, with varying degrees of fondness, the bar-mitzvah-like atmosphere, the $25 all-you-can-eat buffet, and the Mattress Room, where people "writhed together like a bucket of worms." As Al Goldstein succinctly puts it, "Larry was boring; his whole world was genitalia. He never read a book." Likewise, American Swing  never really gets it up, rarely mentioning what was happening in either New York City or the culture at large in the '70s and '80s. Though sweetly reminding us that some outer-borough suburbanites did find liberation at Plato's, the film tries—and fails—to swing both ways, nostalgically glorifying its subject only to smugly revel in Levenson's ignominious demise.
