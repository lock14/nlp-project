�There should be more movies like this,� opined one grandmotherly type to another at our screening. Based on Christianna Brand�s Nurse Matilda books and featuring an A-list cast of British character actors, Nanny McPhee
 is indeed something of a rarity: a movie for children that is about children and their world. There are no aliens in it, no cartoon animals, and no fast-food restaurants. (Partly this is due to the turn-of-the-century setting, but it�s also a matter of the film�s tone.) And while the kids � seven of them � are pretty much wisenheimers, they are not cooler-than-thou, and the adults in their lives aren�t blithering idiots, but flawed people who make mistakes until they reach a point of reckoning. However, to reach the movie�s very old-fashioned message � that families must cooperate, listen to one another, and respect one another, children and adults alike � the viewer runs a gauntlet of Edwardian slapstick, and I am sad to say that there are pigs dressed as women and a mule �cutely� animated with CGI. (The children in my audience were less obviously entranced by these antics than the filmmakers might have hoped.) And per the custom of children�s entertainment, we�ve had to Kill Off the Mother, and please don�t get me started about that. I am not familiar with the Nurse Matilda books, but Nanny McPhee (Thompson) resembles Betty MacDonald�s Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle more than she does Mary Poppins: She�s darkly magical, and her discipline techniques involve extending the children�s behavior to their consequences in extremis
. Faked illness gets magically enforced bedrest and vile medicine that wriggles around on the spoon like Flubber. (In one scene, a baby is mildly endangered, causing prolonged distress to a 3-year-old next to me.) After she swoops in to the rundown manor of a widowed mortician (Firth) and starts kicking magical ass with his seven hellions, Nanny McPhee�s likewise magical warts vanish, and by film�s end Thompson looks hot, younger, and thin again; if this notion offends, parents could turn it into a teachable moment with wee viewers. The kids are all fine, and I particularly liked Thomas Sangster (Love, Actually
) as the oldest, but it�s the adults who are having a field day. Lansbury is a hoot as the detestable Aunt Adelaide (�What are we doing milling about this dreary vestibule?� she shrieks. �Sherry at once!�), and there are no words to describe the estimable Imelda Staunton as the family�s excitable cook. The film�s producers � the prolific Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan of Working Title Films � have tried family-film adaptations before (2004�s Thunderbirds
 and 1997�s The Borrowers
), but this is probably their most watchable all-ages effort to date. Parents might appreciate a lighter hand with the barnyard whimsy and food fights, but overall the movie doesn�t condescend about heavy matters (grief, healing, and blended families) and is pleasantly diverting.


Whenever I'm asked if there's a genre of movie I dislike, I usually claim to be "open to anything." I'm lying, apparently. Sitting through the first 15 minutes of "Nanny McPhee," I realized I hate movies about bad kids.
Specifically, kids whose dead or divorced parents give them license to terrorize a movie audience. Ultimately, though, the films impart to them a balmy family lesson. "Are We There Yet?" and "Zathura" are that sort of picture. And, to some extent, so is "The Chronicles of Narnia."
"Nanny McPhee" is more of the same, but with a pleasing difference: The children are tortured right back, which makes for a jolly time at the movies.
The Browns -- six insolent monsters and one helpless infant living in the English countryside -- are an obnoxious brood indeed. Since their mother died, they've scared off 17 nannies. Each new conquest is posted on a chart, and the kids' useless mortician father, Cedric (Colin Firth), must go begging for a new one.
Just as the children set about destroying the kitchen and pouncing on my last nerve, the Browns' doorbell rings and in steps Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee, a severe, stupendously unappetizing woman. She has two warts, a bulbous snout, a blotchy complexion, and one snaggletooth. More crucially, she also has a psycho-killer gleam in her eyes.
With a stamp of her walking stick, the children's pointless horseplay is given a functional hyperactive twist. Vegetables fly violently into a boiling caldron, and Simon (Thomas Sangster), the brood's recalcitrant leader, can't stop maniacally stirring.
Nanny has five lessons of obedience to share, but it won't be easy.
"I never say please," exclaims Simon. Of course, the kids act up for a reason. They're mad that their father never makes time for them because he's obsessed with finding a new wife. They're not the only ones. The family's angelic housekeeper, Evangeline (Kelly MacDonald), has a crush on her boss and can sense the good in his children, which, given their behavior, is impossible, like Superman being able to see through lead.
Cedric has reasons for obsessing over a replacement, mostly owing to a Dickensian arrangement with his aunt-in-law, played by a hawk-nosed Angela Lansbury with a disdain that makes Judi Dench seem warm. Great-Aunt Adelaide has been supporting the Browns and will cut Cedric off unless he remarries. Barring that, she'll take one of his daughters.
The scheme to avoid losing one of the girls and the frantic search for a wife turns up Celia Imrie as an outlandish widow and puts lots of farm critters to work in a way that always leaves kids tickled. Adults, meanwhile, will appreciate the cast's gusto. The child actors are unusually good, much better than the tykes in "Narnia." Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow, playing Cedric's co-workers, are the Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum of undertaking. And Imelda Staunton is a riot as the Browns' frazzled cook.
Thompson adapted the screenplay from Christianna Brand's "Nurse Matilda" books, and she and director Kirk Jones balance the slapstick and levity with darker enchantments. At its most enjoyable the film feels like Roald Dahl's idea of "Mary Poppins" -- and on occasion, "The Sound of Music." Who else are the Browns if not a devilish edition of the von Trapps?
I wish Thompson were in more movies. Here she sends up both of Julie Andrews's governess roles, but not heartlessly. Thompson is steely where Andrews was huggable. She's tough because tough is what spoiled kids need. She won't spare them her rod. When her work here is done, I know some kids in Narnia who might deserve her services.

         The exotic, antic ground that "Nanny McPhee" treads has been well-traveled by such diverse products as "Beetlejuice," "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" (both versions), "James and the Giant Peach," "The Witches" and, most especially, "Mary Poppins." While this adaptation of Christianna Brand's deadpan "Nurse Matilda" series of books may not quite stand at the same level with such impressive predecessors, it's still a spicy little pastry with just the right proportions of flakiness and gooeyness.
 
  Among the movie's small but welcome dividends is having Emma Thompson not only writing the script but pouring the full measure of her witty, borderline-wicked self into the title role: a sort of Mary Poppins with fangs — or, more accurately, warts and a protruding tooth. You're so glad to see Thompson being funny on screen that you welcome the movie's running gag in which she unexpectedly materializes in a room, explaining dryly to her fretful employer Mr. Brown (Colin Firth), "I did knock."
 


         






    Nanny McPhee materialized in Mr. Brown's life as a last resort in controlling his seven smart-aleck children, who have found ways to drive away 17 nannies through vile mischief. (They once pretended to have cooked and eaten their baby sister.) The widowed Mr. Brown, a doting if clueless parent, enjoys custody of his unruly brood through the financial support of his great-aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), who warns that if he doesn't marry within the month, he'll go to debtor's prison and the kids will be scattered to various workhouses. (This is set, after all, in Victorian England.)
 
  Anyway, Nanny McPhee, warts and all, manages the unlikely trick of winning the Brown children to her side, especially after she temporarily gets Adelaide off their backs by making the farm animals dance and passing off their simpatico housekeeper (Kelly Macdonald) as a Brown daughter in need of "proper" schooling. But whatever will the kids do after Father desperately proposes to a greedy vixen (Celia Imrie) who says yes?
 
  The movie's kooky veneer is almost oversold by a production design intoxicated with garish colors. And as with many family-oriented features these days, "Nanny McPhee" can't resist advancing its little lessons about courtesy, attentiveness and honesty between parents and children. But among the movie's pleasant and unobtrusive ironies is the manner in which its more astringent touches provide (dear me, how can I bear to say it?) the spoonful of sugar that makes such medicine go down. I did warn you.   

Nanny McPhee  is one of those raucous, hyperactive kiddie flicks that knocks you upside the head from its opening frame. In England, a handsome widower (Colin Firth) lives with his seven children, who are such brats that they've driven away 17 nannies, and the British toddler mischief gets shoved at the audience with wide-angle-lens coarseness, for that maximum annoying impact. Then, as the storm clouds gather, a magical new nanny arrives from up in the air. We're cued to expect Mary Poppins, but instead, in walks Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson), who has a witchy pair of facial warts, a hideous unibrow, a nose scuzzy and bulbous enough to belong to an ancient drunk, and a single bucktooth that hangs over her lower lip like a misnailed floorboard.
Yes, it's the tough-love Mary Poppins. When the children fake measles, their new governess bangs her polished tree branch of a walking stick on the ground, and voilà!  they really get measles. The only cure is to swallow a supergross spoonful of what looks like squirmy live castor oil.
Thompson wrote the script for Nanny McPhee, adapting it from Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda  books, and she plays the title role with her familiar saucy inflections, letting that voice undercut McPhee's ugly-duckling appearance. Each time she teaches the kids a new lesson, a different flaw vanishes from her face. Yet there remains an odd glimmer of masochism to Thompson's portrayal. After a while, the film introduces a new cartoon wretch  a powdered harridan who seems to have wandered in from a road production of Barry Lyndon: The Musical . She's out to make Firth into her husband, and the movie, which is already too repetitive and too damn grotty, becomes about as appealing as a stale crumpet.

 In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film "Nanny McPhee," Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of Mary Poppins as conceived by the author P. L. Travers and the illustrator Mary Shepard. Created in 1934, three decades before Disney and Julie Andrews got hold of her and dipped her in saccharine, the original Mary Poppins was a forbidding,  tight-lipped disciplinarian who dressed in black, rarely cracked a smile and wouldn't think of bursting into song.  The title character in "Nanny McPhee," loosely adapted from Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books (written in the 1960's), is a severe, unsmiling crone who wields a crooked walking stick that she raps hard on the floor to conjure magic. McPhee also has an alarming habit of materializing out of thin air while always insisting (in one of the movie's running jokes) that she knocked beforehand. Ominously reassuring, she promises she will be there "when you need me but don't want me."  Unlike Poppins, McPhee is a clownish figure with a bulbous nose, facial warts and a buck tooth that droops over her lower lip. As she shapes up a chaotic brood of seven children who have driven their widowed father, Mr. Brown (Colin Firth), to his wits' end, her physical flaws melt away, one by one.  The day she arrives on the doorstep out of the blue, Mr. Brown, who works in a funeral parlor, is facing imminent financial ruin and the breakup of his family, having run through 17 nannies, who all  were driven out of the house by his impossible brood. He has been put on notice by his  wife's wealthy, imperious Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), who has been supporting the family, that unless he remarries within a month, she will cut them off. The role of the dithery, harried dad is well off the beaten path for Mr. Firth, but he dispatches it with unassuming ease.  Just as she arrives, the children are gleefully destroying the kitchen and have tied up the family's good-hearted cook, Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton). McPhee sets to work immediately: her strategy is to let the children have their way until she conjures a magical moment of reckoning. Once they've started making mischief, the children are unable to stop what they've started until they beg "please," and she calls a halt to the spell.  "Nanny McPhee," directed by Kirk Jones ("Waking Ned Devine") from a screenplay by Ms. Thompson, is a movie whose twisted visual imagination is more forceful than its wobbly, zigzagging narrative. The story goes off on tangents. After visiting the funeral parlor where Mr. Brown works with two assistants, Mr. Wheen (Derek Jacobi) and Mr. Jowls (Patrick Barlow), the movie largely forgets about them. And, under closer scrutiny, McPhee's techniques of behavior modification don't always make sense.  Against the magical goings-on, the movie awkwardly juxtaposes an undernourished love story about the secret crush shared by Mr. Brown and his sweet, shy scullery maid,  Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), who is whisked away by Aunt Adelaide, taught elocution and  returned to the family speaking like a lady.  The movie's boldest stroke is its garish visual palette, which paints late-Victorian Britain in psychedelic Day-Glo hues. Much of the visual excess is heaped on the odious Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), a snobbish, carnivorous widow to whom Mr. Brown, to meet the marriage deadline, becomes engaged. Outfitted in glaring fuchsia, she strolls around with two pet sheep, each dyed a different hideous color.  Delightful performances buoy the movie immensely. Ms. Lansbury's frosty Adelaide is as intimidating as any snobbish grande dame embodied by the mistress of hauteur, Dame Judi Dench. Ms. Macdonald blossoms like an English rose in the sunlight. Ms. Staunton's Mrs. Blatherwick is as spluttery and sentimental as Angela Baddeley's Mrs. Bridges from the television series "Upstairs, Downstairs." As Simon, the oldest and most diabolical of the holy terrors, Thomas Sangster wears the Mephistophelean grin of a pubescent Mick Jagger plotting mischief.  Richest of all is Ms. Thompson's McPhee, who conveys with a thousand subtle hints that just behind her affronted snaggletoothed glare lies a reservoir of affection and good will.  "Nanny McPhee"  is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).  It has some strong language.

Working Title's latest attempt to crack the lucrative family market after the sputtering "Thunderbirds," "Nanny McPhee" finds the Brit shingle returning to a cozy comfort zone with a "Mary Poppins"-like tale of naughty well-heeled tykes tamed by a magical child-minder. Even with its clipped English accents, "Nanny" should prove a lucrative (especially on ancillary) and exportable property with its name cast led by Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, a spoonful of sugary morality and a kidcentric mindset suitable for female tots. 
Pic opened wide in Blighty Oct. 21 with a $4.6 million opening weekend, good for second place between "Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" and "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride." Universal has pegged U.S. bow for Jan. 27.
Film, based loosely on Christianna Brand's "Nurse Matilda" children's books of the 1960s, is set in a fantasy version of the late Victorian period. However, script by Thompson often feels like a G-rated version of one of Working Title's contempo, adult-oriented successes, with its single-parent set up ("About a Boy") and subplot about a cross-tracks romance ("Love Actually," "Bridget Jones's Diary") between lead grown-up Mr. Brown (WT regular Firth) and scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). Even the slapstick recalls WT hits like "Johnny English" and "Bean."
Funeral director Mr. Brown (Firth) -- recently bereaved, good-hearted but hopeless inept at parenting -- has been left with seven children, from pubescent Simon (Thomas Sangster, "Love Actually") down to infant Agatha (twins Hebe and Zinnia Barnes). Since mom died, the Brown brood has gone through 17 nannies due to unruly behavior and such antics as pretending to have eaten the baby.
What the pint-sized hooligans don't know is that, if dad doesn't marry within a month, his late wife's Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury, channeling Joyce Grenfell but with a beaky nose) will cut off a much-needed allowance, forcing the family to be split up. Propriety keeps Brown from proposing to the object of his affection, comely domestic Evangeline (Macdonald), who clearly (if mutely) returns his regard.
The only plausible candidate Brown can think of is mite-too-merry widow Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie, in a ripe turn, whose corseted embonpoint amply fills the widescreen frame). In the meantime, a new nanny must be found.
One evening, the frightening physiognomy of Nanny McPhee (Thompson, festooned with warts and a monobrow, plus padding under her black dress) turns up on the Browns' doorstep. A rap of her magic walking stick on the floor forces the rioting rugrats in the kitchen to free the cook, Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton), who they've trussed to the table.
Thus endeth Nanny McPhee's first lesson: Go to bed when you're told. In due course, the Brown family, and not just the children, learns four further lessons -- from the prosaic "dress when you are told" to the more homiletic "listen" -- plus more, in true movie fashion, about themselves. After each lesson, Nanny McPhee loses a wart or blemish as her beauty blossoms out of the children's growing love for her.
Fable's didacticism is right up there on the surface, and some auds may cringe at the way pic needles middle-class anxieties about parenting skills -- a fashionable topic on TV these days. But under the surface, the movie has a streak of Roald Dahl-style darkness that dilutes the sugar.
Helming by Kirk Jones is as brisk and efficient as in his previous comedy, "Waking Ned Devine," and he shows the same skill at keeping perfs on a fine cusp between British pantomime and standard cinematic clowning. Kiddie cast's cut-glass drama-school diction fits the characters' well-to-do milieu, although non-British viewers may find it more charming than indigenous auds.
Supporting players like Staunton, Imrie, and Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow (as Brown's oleaginous assistants) appear to be having a ball.
Pic utilizes a lurid palette of colors -- acid greens, flaming fuchsias and eye-popping purples -- to create a look of comfy suburbia on acid. Almost headache-inducing effect is achieved through a diabolical pact between Michael Howells' cluttered production design, Nic Ede's gloriously over-the-top costumes and special grading of Henry Braham's lensing. Use of special and visual f/x is restrained compared with most family films nowadays and deployed mostly to make Nanny McPhee's warts disappear and, in one of the most winning sequences, make a donkey dressed as a lady dance.

Emma Thompson 's first screenwriting effort since the Oscar-winning Sense and Sensibility  is another literary adaptation, allegedly of Christianna Brand 's Nurse Matilda books. But honestly: a Victorian setting, ill-behaved children, a distant father, and a magical nanny? It's Mary Poppins ,  if there were seven children instead of two and all were evil geniuses. Fortunately, this nanny isn't above using her powers for retribution, humorously making the punishments fit the crimes for the willful children. The child actors in question are appealing, although someone had the bad sense to CGI moving lips onto the baby. As the titular character, Thompson is amusingly dour, and Colin Firth , as the distracted father, is less wooden than usual. If you have someone under 10 to take to the movies, this one is charming and painless. Plus, you get the perverse delight of seeing such dignified thespians as Derek Jacobi , Imelda Staunton , and Angela Lansbury  involved in a food fight.
