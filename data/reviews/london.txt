 A misfired attempt at provocation and the exploration of philosophical thought, "London" is little more than an immature display of male bonding on speed. Bateman (Jason Statham) and Syd (Chris Evans) are two strangers — a drug dealer and his customer — who spend an intense evening, mostly holed up in a bathroom, ingesting suicidal levels of alcohol and cocaine, shouting obscenities and engaging in some quieter, supposedly revelatory guys' talk that hits upon S-and-M, impotency and the meaning of life. They are interrupted by flashbacks chronicling the explosive relationship of Syd and his "ex-chick" London (Jessica Biel), whose going-away party Syd and Bateman have crashed, and the occasional trashy woman wanting in on the drug action so badly that she doesn't seem to mind that she's in the company of serious misogynists.  The writer and director Hunter Richards's debut film features a thoroughly unsympathetic cast of characters, weak performances (though the supporting actors fare better than the leads) and a script that is laughable, minus a few exceptions, in all the wrong places. Though the action moves along at a decent pace — a somewhat honorable feat, considering the film's setting — there is not one character you'd wish to meet, much less spend the duration of a movie with.  "London" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has excessive drug use, sex, harsh language and some violence.

For those who enjoy fashion-model-looking twentysomethings yelling at each other in bathrooms while doing too much cocaine, voila! Heaven is a place called "London." Everyone else will want to maintain a wide berth around this noxious debut feature for writer-director Hunter Richards, whose apparent views on the battle of the sexes suggest anger-management counseling is needed. Given recent rises in the career fortunes of leads Chris Evans ("Fantastic Four"), Jason Statham (the "Transporter" films) and Jessica Biel ("Elizabethtown"), one suspects this decidedly minor project has been sitting on the shelf, waiting for a hook. Next stop, rental limbo.
Waking from his latest stupor, shaggy-maned Syd (Evans) is displeased to learn the girlfriend who left him some months ago is leaving New York City tomorrow to move in with her new b.f., following a going-away party to which he has not been invited. He does the natural thing: Scores a ton of coke, and drags the dealer (Statham as Bateman) to the high-rise apartment fete, where they arrive early and unwelcomed. 
Duo repairs to the cavernous bathroom and, incredibly, keep us there for most of the movie -- snorting blow off a Van Gogh reproduction, sharing the wealth with Lolita type Maya (Kelli Garner) and bartender Mallory (Joy Bryant) while discussing the existence of God, their own horrible relationship track records, and who's suffered the most as a result. Their tasteless insights are treated with shrill gravity. 
Finally, Syd gathers the nerve to go downstairs and face guest of honor London (Biel), managing to cause a melee in the process. Incredibly, the not-so-dumb-looking yet only somewhat exasperated ex-g.f. then leaves the party with him for a one last night of good sex.
Perhaps the strangest thing in this movie -- one that could only be loved by other macho cokeheads who confuse loving women with controlling them --is that it assumes the aud cares about protags' future. It ultimately posits Syd as a hopeless, one-chick-forever romantic, when one might more naturally view him as a childish man-boy beggin' for a restraining order.
The actors should not be faulted for the fact that their characters make pretty horrible company, since they have been urged toward hysteria at every opportunity. Evans gets the worst deal, forever shrieking variations on "I just wanna turn the pain off!" Statham's slightly psycho Brit buddy feels like less an organic character than a homage to those he played in Guy Ritchie movies. No amount of edgy personality can work magic on some of the questionable lines Bateman is required to utter. Biel and the other women narrowly preserve their dignity.
Hardly anyone onscreen seems to have a job, yet they all live in spacious upscale Manhattan abodes that, abetted by Jo Willems' widescreen lensing, help offset viewer claustrophobia within a basically non-cinematic concept. Tech aspects are slick. Print screened at Montreal lacked closing credits, with the image ending at 87 minutes while music continued to 90.

The garrulous London  takes place in New York, but it might as well be Wichita Falls  for all the time we spend out and about. Most of the action unfolds in a swanky apartment's capacious, concrete-themed bathroom during a farewell bash for the titular head-turner (Jessica Biel ). She's bound for the West Coast to be with her boyfriend. But London flickers to life mostly in flashback, as her scruffy ex, the brokenheartedand annoyingly verboseSyd (Chris Evans ), replays scenes from their tumultuous relationship, a bleak panoply of jealousy, sexual humiliation, andworst of allexistential arguments in cleanly appointed beach houses.
Having crashed the party with newfound British drug dealer/buddy Bateman (Jason Statham ), after an all-day bender, Syd resists confronting London one last time, instead skipping to the loo and snorting approximately one third of Colombia 's GNP. Syd's emotional tailspin is embarrassingly banal, and his assertion that "everybody here hates me" quickly applies to the audience as well. Mercifully, Bateman is a slightly more interesting figure, a currency trader with a sideline in coke and an appetite for elaborate s/m. Alas, his deep dark secret, when finally revealed, is laughably not up to its preface ("Where you're trying to push me is not a place you want to go," he sternly advises Syd). Shouldn't someone so pharmaceutically inclined have heard of Viagra ?
During an early monologue by a stoned high schooler (Kelli Garner ), first-time director Hunter Richards  displays a playful visual sense that's rarely tapped thereafter. We know little about Syd's lifejob, education, interestsapart from his fixation on London and adamant refusal to admit to his own considerable flaws. Indeed, it seems Richards himself is more than a little sick of his main man. As London puts it, "You keep going and going and going until people just want to bash your head in."
