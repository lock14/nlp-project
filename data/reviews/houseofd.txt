         "House of D," which marks David Duchovny's writing and directing feature debut, is a heartfelt coming of age story, set in 1973, that takes its title from the old Women's House of Detention in Greenwich Village. On the cusp of 13, Anton Yelchin's Tommy strikes up an acquaintance with one of its inmates (Erykah Badu), who shouts down advice to him from her solitary confinement in the massive, now demolished Romanesque Revival landmark.
 
  Tommy needs all the advice he can get. His father died a year earlier, leaving his mother (Téa Leoni), despondent enough that he regularly checks her sleeping pill supply to make sure she's not overdoing it. His best pal Pappass (Robin Williams) is a middle-aged, mildly retarded man who works as a janitor at Tommy's parochial school and with whom Tommy delivers meat for a local butcher. Tommy is beginning to notice girls and is dreaming of a future as an artist. This is where Badu's streetwise, no-nonsense encouragement counts.
 


         






    Much that takes place in "House of D" is a bit of stretch, to say the least, and a lot of it verges on the saccharine, but it's clear that Duchovny wants his film to be seen as a rite of passage fable about how boys must discover what it means to be a man and what it takes to become one. In this Duchovny is on the right track, just as he is in showing how fragile day-to-day existence is for Tommy and his mother.
 
  "House of D," which benefits from Michael Chapman's typically fresh, flowing camerawork, is framed by a present-day prologue set in Paris, where the impending 13th birthday of his son (Harold Cartier) causes the adult Tom (Duchovny) to look back at the life-changing events that occurred around his own 13th birthday. There is a matching epilogue depicting Tom's return to Manhattan after three decades.
 
  Even though Williams gives a restrained performance, his casting is perhaps a little too obvious, with the wistfulness and pathos he brings to Pappass a tad too predictable. Zelda Williams as Tommy's first crush, Frank Langella as the priest in charge of the parochial school and Magali Amadei as Tommy's French wife are among those rounding out a reliable cast.
 
  A film that takes a steadfastly gentle look at some of life's harshest moments while not overlooking its joys, "House of D" deserves a chance to find an audience.

The Women's House of Detention in New York's Greenwich Village, an urban prison that did a brisk business locking up hookers, was torn down years ago, the land raked and planted to create the verdant community garden that blooms today. But the nostalgic memory of a lovably raggedy Village in Manhattan's roughrider 1970s colors House of D , an overly picaresque first feature written and directed by David Duchovny, who also co-stars. The former X-File r is himself a kind of Davey From the Block who grew up within littering distance of the landmark slammer, and he fills his coming-of-age melodrama, told in flashback, with purple flights of raised-in-the-hood fancy  the script is more of a florid novella than a cinematic drama.
Duchovny plays Tom Warshaw, an expat artist living in Paris married to a French beauty and father to a 13-year-old son. The adult Tom looks back to the 13-year-old boy he himself once was (played with sincerity by Hearts in Atlantis ' Anton Yelchin), then living with an emotionally unstable mother (Téa Leoni), hanging around with his best friend (more on him in a moment), and turning for comfort to the tough wisdom offered by a nameless inmate (singer Erykah Badu) through a prison window.
Tom's friend in House of D , I squirm to report, is a janitor named Pappass, self-described (in the movie's pre-PC 1970s lingo) as retarded. The friend, I cringe to explain, is played by Robin Williams, who jokes and cries while wearing prosthetic teeth that shape his mouth into a rictus smile out of a Wallace & Gromit  cartoon. This information is offered for the benefit of those wagering which version of the Williams persona appears: It's the soppy-simpleton one.

he reasons to avoid "House of D," David Duchovny's earnest, unwatchable coming-of-age drama, can best be summarized in a simple declarative sentence. Robin Williams plays a retarded janitor. For some reason, Mr. Williams, a comedian of prodigious gifts who occasionally shows himself to be a more than capable character actor, is fatefully drawn to a particular kind of sentimentality. The character of Pappass, a wise, kindly, mentally disabled man who helps guide a troubled boy on life's difficult journey, must have been irresistible to him, given his track record of crinkly, heartfelt mugging. "House of D," for its part, will be irresistible to those hardy, wet-eyed souls who cherish "Patch Adams," "Bicentennial Man" and "Jakob the Liar." Enough said. Mr. Duchovny, directing his first feature film (which he also wrote), revisits New York in the scruffy, neighborly 1970's, when Greenwich Village, where most of the story takes place, was apparently more like an actual village than it is today. On his son's 13th birthday, the narrator, Tom Warshaw (Mr. Duchovny), an American artist living in Paris, tells the story of his own adolescence, a tale of mischief and first love that culminates in heartbreak and that is meant to explain the man he has become. That man, married to a lovely French woman (Magali Amadei), is moody, soulful and perpetually late, but the stunning narcissism of his birthday gift to his son is met with mawkish, wide-eyed gratitude. In the flashback that occupies most of the film, Tom (who is played as a teenager by Anton Yelchin) lives in a brownstone apartment with his mother (T�a Leoni), whose drastic mood swings are explained by the sudden death of her husband a few months before. Pappass, simple-hearted and amiable, serves both as Tom's little brother and his surrogate father. The boy also receives valuable life lessons from an incarcerated woman (Erykah Badu) who shouts down-home wisdom through the bars of her cell in the women's House of Detention on West 10th Street, a vanished  edifice that gives the movie its title. Pappass and Tom earn some extra money delivering meat for a local butcher, and their days are a carefree ramble through a city full of lovable eccentrics, a few of them played by semi-well-known actors. Tom, who attends a starchy all-male private school (presided over by Frank Langella in a clerical collar), develops a crush on a cute Upper West Sider named Melissa (Zelda Williams), and their romance unleashes a wildly improbable avalanche of trouble. As is true of many actors who turn to directing, Mr. Duchovny is generous with his cast, and some of the scenes, in particular those involving Mr. Yelchin and Ms. Williams, have an easy, lived-in rhythm. (The scenes with Mr. Williams are another matter entirely.) Mostly, though, the burden of the story, which is maudlin and entirely unbelievable, weighs down even the more credible performances. "House of D" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references, occasional profanity and some drug use.

In his first stab at feature filmmaking, "House of D," David Duchovny scores considerably higher as director than as screenwriter. Seriocomic fable of a grown man prompted by his son's 13th birthday to revisit his own painful adolescence feels false and platitudinous -- a calculated crowd-pleaser that, despite being an original story, plays like a poorly condensed novel with a scripter unable to make choices. Technically polished and intermittently touching and witty, this Lions Gate pickup looks destined for only brief theatrical residence before settling into its ultimate address on television.
Duchovny appears in the framing sequences that bookend the main coming-of-age story as Tom Warshaw, an American artist living in Paris with his French wife Coralie (Magali Amadei) and son Odell (Harold Cartier). Voiceover-heavy intro ruminates on how turning 13 opens a door to self-discovery, but Tom's door closed at that age instead. Wanting to reveal more of himself to his wife and son, he returns home late on Odell's birthday after much soul-searching and launches into the story of his youth.
Forced setup segues to New York City 1973, when Tommy (Anton Yelchin) lived in Greenwich Village with his mother (Tea Leoni), a nurse battling depression after her husband's death from cancer. Tommy's best friend is Pappas (Robin Williams), a mentally challenged school janitor with whom he operates a delivery service for a local butcher. Saving to buy a new bicycle, the two friends hide their earnings in a secret place outside the walls of the Women's House of Detention.
When Tommy begins showing romantic interest in schoolmate Melissa (Zelda Williams, daughter of Robin), Pappas feels shut out, smashing a store window and stealing the coveted bicycle in a bid to win back his friend's affections. Tommy turns increasingly for advice to a woman he knows only as Lady (Erykah Badu), incarcerated in the House of D, who doles out courtship and life lessons from her cell window while unsuccessfully pushing the boy to score her a bag of weed.
Tommy takes the fall for Pappas' misdemeanor and is suspended from school, but the incident distances Melissa and pushes the boy's fragile mother over the edge. His final words of guidance from Lady prompt Tommy to take drastic steps, erasing a past he's forced to reassemble later as an adult.
Having previously written and directed episodes of "The X-Files," Duchovny acquits himself well enough with the physical side of filmmaking, backed by a sharp creative team. Michael Chapman's crisp lensing deftly captures the lazy feel of a New York neighborhood in summertime; production designer Lester Cohen and costumer Ellen Luter nail the early-'70s look without the usual overstated retro fuss; and composer Geoff Zanelli's unintrusive score (exec produced by Hans Zimmer) is smoothly integrated with period hits to evoke the mood of the time.
But despite what appears to be a personal connection to the material (Duchovny grew up in the East Village), the writing pushes every pre-programmed emotional button imaginable. The story of love, friendship and the crushing encounter between youthful inexperience and harsh reality feels especially artificial in the final stretch when the adult Tom returns from Paris to laboriously reconnect with his past. The entire story is built on relationships, conflicts and resolutions that rarely ring true.
Yelchin ("Hearts in Atlantis") gives the movie much of its limited charm in a performance with humor, sensitivity and spirited intelligence.
Wanting to have it every way possible in an irritatingly self-conscious turn that's really just a series of untethered tics, Williams shifts between grinning idiocy, cute antics, humorous hipster mimicry and solemn Chauncey Gardiner-style innocent wisdom.
Leoni is saddled with a character given zero grounding in reality, but Badu's seen-it-all sistah supplies some enjoyably tart moments, and Frank Langella puts a droll spin on the stern cleric principal of Tommy's school.

David Duchovny s dreary directorial debut doesnt deliver
Like the new Jonathan Safran Foer  novel, David Duchovny's directorial debut, House of D , uses a flipbook in the service of wishful thinking. Duchovny plays Thomas, an American artist in Paris who dwells on the events of his 13th year, as a Greenwich Village  kid circa 1973, upon the occasion of his own son's 13th birthday. Marred by a rambling voice-over at one end and a pat therapeutic resolution on the other, the film has a nice half-hour patch somewhere in the middle, in which the younger Tommy (Anton Yelchin , smart and sensitive) navigates prep school and puppy love before entering a downward spiral.
His best friend is Pappass (Robin Williams ), the school janitor and a fellow butcher-store employee. Selectively retarded, Pappass can sagely remark that "Places change like people change," yet can't help himself from blurting things like "I have a huge penis." Duchovny spouse Téa Leoni  plays Tommy's mom (paging Dr. Freud!), a depressed widow who leaves her cigarettes in the toilet, targets for Tommy to pee on. For advice on girls,
Tommy yelps his woes to "Lady" (Erykah Badu ), an upper-floor resident of the Women's House of Detention. The concatenation of setbacks following Tommy's attendance at a school dance is swift and hysterical. The extended soul-hug (spurred by Thomas's French wife, who says, "A man ees a man only when 'e can be eemself wherever 'e ees") approaches the grotesque, but at least Yelchin occasionally lends this too heartfelt film an actual heart.
