One hesitates to use a term like symbolism in relation to "Max Payne." But mustn't it mean something that no one in the movie who's armed (which is just about everyone) seems able to hit the target? "Max Payne" is based on a video game of the same name, and the only character any good at playing is Max himself.
Mark Walhberg sulks relentlessly in the title role, a miserable New York City detective, and he brings extra-strength solemnity to the part. On the one hand: Who killed Max's wife and baby? On the other: Who allowed him to stop dressing like a cop and start dressing like a bouncer at a strip club in Saugus? Black on black on black on black? Dude, we get it - you're tough, you're depressed, you're tired of checking IDs.
Max spends his movie trying to find out who murdered his family while being a suspect in a different murder. But it's hard for us to be as committed to justice as he is when the search turns so chaotically brutal so often. We are, however, handed an odd grab bag of actors to sort through. Chris "Ludacris" Bridges snarls as the detective following Max. Kate Burton sits in the back of a Town Car and looks guilty. Poor Chris O'Donnell looks foolish while trying to look guilty. Jamie Hector, the actor who was so good as Marlo, the ambitiously cold-blooded kingpin on "The Wire," tries a voodoo accent. And Beau Bridges, as a security chief, is perfectly unembarrassed even as he appears to be one missed eyebrow trim away from becoming a giant owl.
But mostly the movie orbits around Wahlberg. Perhaps he took the part for its fitness value. One sequence requires him to run, shoot, and leap through the air while shooting. Another requires him to leap then run and shoot. He's all business here, refusing the advances of a sexed-up junkie and ignoring the junkie's spiky, vampy sister (Mila Kunis), who enters his life after the junkie turns up dead.
This is not a movie that has great passion for pleasures of the flesh. Its sexiest scenes involve bullets cutting through the air in the slowest motion possible and the men who cock their shotguns, extravagantly leaping backward, to fire them. Restaging mayhem from old John Woo movies is all director John Moore cares to do. In his last outing, a contemptible remake of "The Omen," Moore whipped fake hellhounds into a frenzy and sent Julia Stiles plummeting to her death. This time he gets to show demons with 30-foot wingspans and orchestrate a shootout in a pharmaceuticals office. (Watch the Post-Its fly!)
Eventually, we hear news of a drug that makes our troops invincible (yes, that story line again), but the conspiracy goes nowhere. The filmmakers aim their cynicism more at us than at any government or drug company. They seem far more excited about the giant graphically designed gun that stars in the closing credits. It gets a much better close-up than Wahlberg does.


Movies based on videogames, like the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider   or Resident Evil   franchises, tend to be hollow, hyperactive FX-laden blowouts. Max Payne  has the hollow part down pat, but there's nothing active about it. It's just a grindingly inert death-wish thriller in which Max (Mark Wahlberg ), a stone-cold detective whose wife and infant were mysteriously murdered, tries to solve the crime and exact his revenge. The movie is a series of glum interrogation scenes that lead nowhere special, with a not-quite-sci-fi urban murkiness that makes it look like someone was trying to shoot Blade Runner   in Cleveland.

 I think it was when bursts of flame filled the Manhattan night and giant winged creatures smacked against skyscraper windows like bugs on windshields that I began to lose the narrative thread of “Max Payne,” a somber, stylized new action movie derived from a video game.  Up until then it seemed more or less clear. Some people had wings tattooed on their arms, and they all seemed to be hooked on a blue liquid developed by a pharmaceutical company where the hero’s wife worked before she was murdered, along with their child, by some people with wings tattooed on their arms. The weather in New York alternated between fluttering snow and driving rain, and every time someone fired  a gun the images slowed down and the sound mix cleared out so you  could hear the plink of a bullet casing as it  hit the ground. Meanwhile, Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is an action hero so melancholy that he can’t even muster a quotable catchphrase.  Which gives “Max Payne,” directed by John Moore from a script by Beau Thorne, a measure of integrity. It’s not an especially good movie, but such a judgment is not really relevant to its ambitions. It is content to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of a familiar range of sensations, some of which almost rise to the level of feelings. Though a sexy woman in a skimpy dress (next-wave Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko) shows up to tempt Max, lust is not really on the menu. Instead, the film’s momentum is derived from the grim, ruthless self-pity of the lone avenger.  Max Payne, a solo shooter moving through hallways, alleys and empty rooms, is a figure handed down from movies to video games and nowadays, increasingly, handed back. Mr. Moore does a fairly good job of adapting the cinematic aspects of first-person shooter games back into cinema, and in devising a coherent color scheme and sound design for Max’s escapades.  A coherent story would be a lot to ask, and would in any case slow down the movie’s rhythm. Max’s righteous anger finds various allies and targets, though it is not always clear who is which. They are played by Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges and Ludacris with just enough panache and expressiveness to uphold the (increasingly irrelevant) distinction between a movie and a video game.  “Max Payne” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The brutal violence has been cleansed of blood, the swearing avoids the really bad words and when Ms. Kurylenko is topless she is filmed from the back.

Stylishly made, armed to the teeth and ludicrous in the extreme, �Max Payne� sends its eponymous antihero into New York�s underbelly on a deranged quest for revenge. Along the way, director John Moore unleashes every visual trick in his arsenal, the flashiest being a hail of bullets that whoosh across the screen in delirious slow-motion -- no doubt to distract auds from an increasingly risible story involving tattooed corpses, Norse mythology, demonic hallucinations and perhaps the weirdest cinematic reference yet to the �war on terror.� Fans of the popular vidgame franchise and Mark Wahlberg should ensure brawny B.O. and ancillary returns.
As reconceived for the screen by first-time scribe Beau Thorne, New York detective Max Payne bears some temperamental similarities to the gifted sniper Wahlberg played in last year�s �Shooter.� Like Bob Lee Swagger, Max is a laconic, disgruntled badass who�s handy with a gun, lives in self-imposed exile (he�s transferred himself to the NYPD�s cold-cases department) and winds up on the run, accused of a murder he didn�t commit.
Make that two murders. The first victim is a voluptuous Russian babe, Natasha (Olga Kurylenko), whose unique body art provides a clue as to who, or what, was responsible for her brutal dismemberment. The second victim is the cop (Donal Logue) who was assigned to the still-unsolved murders of Max�s wife, Michelle (Marianthi Evans, seen in flashback), and their young child.
Determined to avenge his family, Max teams up with Natasha�s less trashy, more trigger-happy sister, Mona Sax (Mila Kunis, �Forgetting Sarah Marshall�) and seeks sympathetic advice from ex-cop BB Hensley (Beau Bridges), now a top exec at Aesir, the major pharmaceutical company where Michelle used to work. It�s here that �Max Payne� goes quite literally to Hell, as the disillusioned detective realizes a link between Aesir and the pushers of a powerfully addictive drug that induces fiery visions of winged, Valkyrie-like demons. And you thought �The Constant Gardener� was scary.
Before it derails with a climax that seems to have borrowed a few scenes from the �The Incredible Hulk,� �Max Payne� strives valiantly to imbue its hoary vigilante-thriller cliches and police-procedural tropes with authentic grit and emotion. But a fleeting mention of the Iraq War amounts to little more than a pseudo-topical feint (proof that the U.S.-Mideast conflict is officially ripe for action-pic exploitation), and scenes meant to emotionally anchor the drama are dashed off with perfunctory haste. Not helping matters is Wahlberg�s guarded performance, which (somewhat surprisingly, given the subtle shadings of personality the actor displayed in �Shooter�) fails to make Max Payne the character much of an improvement on Max Payne the avatar.
The 2001 videogame and its 2003 sequel were notable for their innovative third-person-shooter interface -- heavily influenced by the balletic action on display in �The Matrix� and the films of John Woo -- which allowed players to slow down time while firing and dodging bullets. Fans will be duly impressed with how the pic incorporates the gimmick, though needless to say, it�s not nearly as much fun as actually playing the game.
Moore, whose strong compositional eye enlivened such otherwise routine action fare as �Flight of the Phoenix� and �Behind Enemy Lines,� artfully blends vidgame and film-noir aesthetics (dramatic overhead camera angles, intense use of chiaroscuro, bursts of red onscreen to emphasize the impact of the violence), while editor Dan Zimmerman�s measured rhythms yield a more coherent, less frenzied work than one might expect from the source material. 
Daniel T. Dorrance�s urban-grunge production design and Jonathan Sela�s shadowy widescreen lensing of various Toronto locations add up to a reasonably convincing and atmospheric simulacrum of the game�s interactive environment before the visual overload of the final scenes. Post-credits sequence promises the obligatory unrequested sequel.
