In the arch make-believe documentary “Paper Heart,’’ actress-comedian Charlyne Yi crisscrosses the country interviewing average Americans about love. These sequences are ostensibly real, but Yi’s director, Nicholas Jasenovec, is played in front of the camera by actor Jake M. Johnson, and the scenes documenting Yi’s growing romance with actor Michael Cera, playing himself, are patently staged. The movie’s a platypus: cute as the dickens but what the heck is it?
The hook is that Yi doesn’t believe in love, or says she doesn’t  - who knows what’s really part of the act? She’s a drolly funny figure, though, a young woman with the thick glasses and asocial slouch of a stereotyped Asian-American nerdgrrl but the antic rebel grin of a gremlin. You saw Yi in a small role as the stoner girlfriend in “Knocked Up’’ and we see snippets of her stage act here; in one bit, she tells the audience she’s wearing a wig, then teases them for being so gullible, then teases them further by removing a wig that looks exactly like her own hair.
That about sums up the movie, a shell game of reality and put-on. The interview segments are pleasant enough, if not exactly groundbreaking. Yi quizzes college science professors on the chemistry of infatuation, talks to a romance novelist, visits an Elvis wedding chapel in Vegas, gets scammed by a psychic. “Paper Heart’’ provides a sideways glimpse of the industry that feeds off our endless love of love; a tougher documentarian might want to come back here someday for an extended dig.
Yi’s travels to the heartland are similarly calorie-free and charming. In listening to a couple married 50 years, a divorced man, a pair of high school sweethearts, a gay couple, and so on, we learn that, well, love’s a mystery but you know it when you feel it. The sweetest parts of these sequences are the tatty marionette shows Yi fashions out of the interviewees’ back stories  - true-romance puppet theater. She created them with the help of her dad, Luciano Yi, and the little we see of her parents’ relationship makes the viewer wish for more. But perhaps that would hit too close to home.
Yi’s romance with Cera is pussyfooted around in similarly opaque ways. The actor drifts into view as part of the larger funny-young-Hollywood circle surrounding Yi, then turns up on the set, at which point the director (or the actor playing him) decides the growing relationship should be filmed as much as possible. This causes dramatic conflict, or it would if the conflict didn’t seem so hopelessly cooked up. Yi and Cera are adorable together but in no way are we getting the truth of what they feel for each other (or what may have led to their recent breakup).
In a way, that’s the point: Whatever love may be, you’ll never capture it on film. Still, the stylistic games reflect Yi and her generation’s larger dilemma. “Paper Heart’’ is a movie that can’t commit about people who don’t know how to.

         "Paper Heart." The name conjures up kindergarten sweetness -- love celebrated in construction paper cutouts, before puberty, dating and disappointments begin to color the picture. 

You get something close to that in this clever hybrid of a film as it swings between comedy, documentary and puppet reenactments with the slightest push from stars Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera, as variations on themselves, and Jake Johnson, as the film's director, Nick Jasenovec.



         






  As much as the subject at hand is love, this is also very much a meta story about young artsy Hollywood, which makes it ripe for tedious self-referential excursions. But "Paper Heart" manages to work the meta mostly magically thanks to the sensibility brought by Yi, whose stand-up persona blends a childlike naiveté with an almost perpetual state of shy embarrassment. 

This romantic fable begins with the notion that Yi, who would seem a natural for fairy tales, doesn't believe in them when it comes to love. Yi, who co-wrote the movie with her director friend Jasenovec, decides to confront her sad state of disillusionment with a cross-country search for what loves means to all types of people.

But "real" life, in the form of Cera, who suddenly emerges as possible boyfriend material, begins to complicate everything. Does it destroy the premise if Yi falls in love? Can their new relationship survive if the camera and crew are always there? 

Johnson, who plays the director on screen, keeps forcing the issue, and we watch as the relationship gets tested, with their emotions running parallel to the work Yi is doing to document those same emotions in the real people she encounters. It all feels very whimsical and very un-Hollywood, if for no other reason than the niceness of its characters, real and fabricated.

But then virtually nothing is conventional about the way the film is constructed. Most of the scenes with Yi and Cera and Johnson were improvised, giving those moments a raw believability. Nothing feels polished or planned about Yi's man-on-the-street interviews either, though it's the kids in the playground who turn out to be among the most astute.

An especially nice touch is the choice to use puppets to reenact the love stories the subjects tell Yi as she and the crew make their way into a Vegas wedding chapel, a biker bar and the living rooms of countless couples. There are just a few cutaways to photos of the lovers in earlier times; mostly their stories play out in a papier-mâché, paint and pipe cleaner world built by Yi and her father after the filming was finished.

If you're expecting the documentary segments to shed anything new on the subject of love, you'll be disappointed. At best, they entertain in a "people say the darndest things" kind of way. But they do support the notion that people still fall in love and find a way to make it work for a lifetime, which is about as happy an ending as you could wish for. 



   

Impish performance artist Charlyne Yi  yet another talent hatched from the Knocked Up  comedy incubator  says she doesn't believe in love. In Paper Heart , the winsomely weird and original comic performance piece she co-wrote with director Nick Jasenovec, Yi travels across the country interviewing real fellow humans, looking for insight into what she's missing. It's more than possible that her attitude toward love is a posture  a stance of presexual girlhood as expertly chosen as her gum-colored thrift-shop wardrobe. Or not. This diverting riff is as much a spoof of film-school self-seriousness as it is a sincere art project, enhanced by Yi's great, homemade puppets.
Likewise, the romance that develops   unexpectedly between Yi and Michael Cera in the course of making her movie, captured by her "documentary crew" on camera (um, director Jasenovec is played by actor Jake Johnson), is another game of true-or-fake. (Yi and Cera were once actually linked in the past  I think.) In that way, the movie's hide-and-seek attitude toward truth mirrors the intricacies of one lover getting to know another  an arresting notion of the heart that's much more than paper-deep.



 At the outset of Nick Jasenovec’s “Paper Heart,” the actress and comedian Charlyne Yi (playing a purportedly fictional version of herself) claims neither to need nor believe in romantic love. Over the course of the movie, however, she will be nudged toward conformity by two parallel forces: the actual testimonies of firm believers and the fictional unfolding of a fumbling affair. And since this is an American story, Ms. Yi’s conversion will come about in the quintessentially American way: as the result of a road trip.  An unconvincing mash-up of the real and the fake, “Paper Heart” wavers between identities to no clear purpose and to its considerable creative detriment. The clumsy premise follows Ms. Yi and a director (named Nick Jasenovec but played by Jake Johnson) as they solicit love stories from a variety of regular Americans, most of whom are delightful and none of whom appears to be in on the movie’s meta-joke. Rather these segments, cherry-picked to enhance a loosely predetermined narrative (by Ms. Yi and Mr. Jasenovec), serve chiefly as props for a scripted romance between the leading lady and the actor Michael Cera, an attachment so tentative and pathologically gawky that it’s almost painful to watch.  Your enjoyment of “Paper Heart” will hinge almost entirely on your receptiveness to Ms. Yi and the extreme iteration of social awkwardness she represents. Either naturally or as a manufactured comic persona (there’s really no way to tell), she appears to be 23 going on 12. (When she dons a wedding dress, she’s like a little girl playing dress-up.) Wearing a permanently baffled expression and a succession of androgynous jeans and hoodies, she shuffles through the movie without acting ability or, it seems, basic survival skills. Lost in the aisles of a supermarket, she and Mr. Cera  (who have been romantically linked in real life) are as helpless as kittens;  you would think neither had seen packaged food before. Their extreme lack of sophistication is faintly disturbing, like a real-life example of one of Al Franken’s “lowered expectations” skits from an old “Saturday Night Live.”  Aggravatingly self-aware, “Paper Heart” achieves focus only in the engagingly candid, no-frills interviews. “I originally wanted to shoot a documentary because I felt the interview subjects were more interesting than me,” Ms. Yi explains in the press notes. She should have followed her instincts: from a judge in Texas to bikers in Oklahoma City, from a wedding-chapel proprietor in Las Vegas to a wryly affectionate gay couple in New York City, the interviewees are by turns funny, earnest and effortlessly touching. Illustrated by occasional snippets of charmingly primitive puppetry, their contributions cry out for the embrace of an authentic nonfiction film. Too bad no one was listening.  “Paper Heart” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Adult language and infantile behavior.

Part documentary, part (almost undetectably) scripted, "Paper Heart" blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction cinema. However, there may be a fairly sharp line dividing those who find the whole delightfully odd, and those irked by what could be read as a faux childlike simplicity to the enterprise, particularly in subject/lead/interviewer Charlyne Yi's uber-geek-girl persona. Sure to stir plenty of fest interest, the pic will intrigue buyers, but definitely reps a marketing and placement challenge.
Yi is best known to general audiences as the weird lone girlfriend in "Knocked Up's" house of stoner dudes. In Los Angeles and beyond, she's acquired a following for very quirky standup that has little to do with jokes or storytelling. Wearing glasses, ponytail and schlumpy clothes, laughing and speaking in ways that might suggest she's a bit "special," Yi cuts an exaggeratedly nerdy figure. So much so that it's hard to gauge just how much of it is an act.
Premise here is that Yi agrees to make a documentary with director Nicolas Jasenovec chronicling her search for the meaning of love -- primarily via other people's wisdom, since she doesn't quite grasp the concept or expect to ever experience true love herself.
She and the small crew do a fast tour around the nation asking real people their thoughts on love. Geographically scattered interviewees range from newlyweds to golden-anniversary couples, plus a chemist, biologist, romance novelist, psychic, Atlanta playground full of kids, Las Vegas Elvis-imitator minister, divorce lawyer, biker-bar patrons, and more.
These people are touchingly, often humorously frank about their most profound interpersonal connections, offering a range of definitions of love -- although the pic stacks the deck by keeping Yi the only real skeptic on hand. When subjects reminisce, their stories are briefly illustrated by extra-primitive puppetry segments.
These are the clearly docu aspects of "Heart," which elsewhere raises many questions as to whether what we're seeing is staged or not. Does Yi really become reluctantly involved with Michael Cera (as himself), young-geek-male du jour of "Juno" and "Superbad," or is the relationship scripted and/or improvised to provide an eventual narrative engine? (Their discomfort with the camera crew's constant presence becomes a primary conflict.)
Then there's the fact that the onscreen Jasenovec -- even more Yi's co-star than Cera -- is actually played by an actor, Jake M. Johnson, as closing credits reveal.
Perhaps realizing that a little too much Yi might get old fast, Jasenovec and editor Ryan Brown's deft package rarely lets her occupy the spotlight without someone else to play off. To whatever extent he's winging it, Cera remains a wryly comic presence.
Tech aspects are above the documentary norm.

A documentary except when it's a mockumentary, this is all kinds of adorable and heartbreaking—the doc part, at least, in which Charlyne Yi  (Martin Starr 's girlfriend in Knocked Up ) sets out to cross the country and find the meaning of True Love because she's pretty damned sure she'll never experience it herself. Sad, right? Except it isn't: Along the way, Yi bumps into Movie Stars  who don't buy her bull (Seth Rogen  tells Yi her "love glass is half full") and True Believers whose fairy tales she recounts using crude, whimsical homemade puppets. It's like those old folks' interludes from When Harry Met Sally  as interpreted by a sweet hipster naïf. The mock part, though, feels a little too  mock: At a bold-faced Hollywood  house party, Yi bumps into Michael Cera , and his instant crush on the gawkward comic turns into the love affair Yi never thought within her grasp. The scenes with Cera play a bit darker than intended as Cera's crush evolves into full-on stalking, but director Nicholas Jasenovec  plays the thing with so much deadpan earnestness that it's easy to miss the high "creepy" factor. Cera begins ingratiating himself into Yi's quest, but that part of the story is doomed from jump: It's entertaining for a moment, but hardly as enlightening or endearing as the from-the-heart moments surrounding it. Yet again, real people are more interesting than fake ones.
