It�s been 15 years since Jane Fonda�s last film (Martin Ritt�s ode to middle-age, blue-collar love, Stanley & Iris
), which, you�d think, would be time enough to find a comeback script worthy of Fonda�s edgier talents. Apparently not. Monster-in-Law
 is a banal and lukewarm slice of romantic comedy and family histrionics that is as soft and ephemeral as any colorized Ted Turner outing. Its breezy, pointless take on the old saw about mothers-in-law being such irascible harpies is as long in the tooth as Fonda � more so, actually. And while it�s apparent that the actress can more than hold her own against Lopez � and honestly, how hard can that be after the career torpedo that was Gigli
? � and is having something approaching a gas playing the shrewish, smothering Viola Fields, by film�s end Fonda fans will more than likely be scurrying to the nearest video outlet to mainline Klute
 or Julia
 or even The Electric Horseman
. (The oddball Barbarella
, of course, screens so often on AMC that it�s already in everybody�s guilty pleasure collection.) Fonda�s Viola is a Barbara Walters-esque TV personality who checks into a mental institution after an on-set freak-out triggered by the news that she�s being replaced by a much younger, blonder, and more vapid talking head. (She also has something of a drinking problem, but the film glosses over this and uses it only to comic effect.) Her M.D. son Kevin, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Lopez�s dog-walking artist-caterer Charlie. After a courtship so whirlwind I�m still not sure what on earth attracted the two to each other, Kevin brings his new paramour home to meet mom, with results so predictable that it�s a testament to Fonda�s enduring screen presence that anyone would bother sitting through the entire film. Viola and Charlie commence an ever-escalating battle of ownership over the clueless Kevin, using tactics such as sleeplessness, and later, attempted poisoning by walnut (Charlie�s allergic to them). The denouement, in which Viola comes to her senses (and I hardly think I�m giving anything away here) and relents her hold on her prized, utterly unengaging offspring, is as hackneyed as you�d think. What�s more annoying about Monster-in-Law
 is what it has to say about the dynamics of mother-son relationships, which is not good, and also how it views middle-aged women, particularly those in positions of societal power. Viola�s first-act breakdown and her incessant drinking have an oddly misogynistic feel about them, this despite the fact that the script is penned by first-timer Anya Kochoff. Monster-in-Law
�s saving grace is Wanda Sykes, who plays Viola�s catty, smartass assistant. It�s not enough to save the entire film, however, which ultimately rests on the tipsy notion that powerful women deposed of public throne and private offspring become raving, literal maniacs. How much better this would have been had someone like Brian De Palma stepped behind the camera.


Lately, Jane Fonda has been doing a lot of apologizing. She's sorry for being so cavalier during the Vietnam War. She's sorry for Ted Turner. She's sorry for the cosmetic surgeries and the bad mothering and the eating disorders. She recently put her sorrys in a memoir big enough to choke a T. Rex.
The only thing she's not apologizing for is her new film, "Monster-in-Law," the mediocre prenuptial comedy that she hijacks from Jennifer Lopez. And really, why should ol' J.Fo apologize when her performance is the best thing in it?
The movie lets Fonda -- who hasn't acted on film in 15 years -- skewer her usual seriousness. She's accepted a part that calls for her to choke, slap, poison, kick, lie, punch, curse, shriek, and be generally loathsome, all while looking more fabulous as the movie wears on. She's a riot.
She plays Viola Fields, a domineering Los Angeles TV host who has just been replaced by a woman a third her age. Her demotion pushes her over the edge and lands her in a ritzy mental facility, which she exits just in time to meet Charlie (Lopez), the new girlfriend of her doctor son, Kevin. He's played by Michael Vartan, who's merely a handsome piece of scenery.
Kevin and Charlie are in love, and right in front of his disgusted mother he asks Charlie to marry him. Desperate to destroy her son's relationship, Viola launches a one-woman shock-and-awe campaign designed to expose her future daughter-in-law as an impatient rube and unrepentant slut. Neither shoe fits. So Ms. Fields switches tactics, aiming to drive Charlie crazy by trying to plan the wedding and moving from her estate into Kevin and Charlie's house.
Viola is so relentless and deranged in her offensive to taint Charlie's reputation that you half-expect her to turn up photos of Charlie on the arm of Sean Combs or Ben Affleck.
But Charlie's past (and her credit report) is dirt-free, and part of the pleasure in watching Fonda lay into her younger opponent is waiting for Lopez to snap back. The truth is she bends more than snaps. Lopez is not a very dynamic screen presence, though she does appear to enjoy herself more than she has in any movie since "Out of Sight." Not that her work in "The Cell," "Enough," or "Maid in Manhattan" is particularly hard to top.
Charlie is a dog-walking, dress-making, feel-good bohemian, the sort of free-spirited dabbler that, once upon a time, Goldie Hawn might have played. Lopez takes a similarly chirpy tack to her character's self-defense. At one point, Charlie drugs Viola, and Lopez politely pumps her fist while Fonda is face-down in a plate of tripe. She seems afraid that we won't like her if she demonstrates a trace of meanness, and that insecurity inhibits her credibility as an actress. Lopez could learn from Fonda's film persona that not caring what people think about you is freeing.
The movie feels adapted from a piece of chick lit. It's not. But all the same, the screenwriter Anya Kochoff seems naively inspired by the modern-fantasy spirit of those books. Charlie's hippest accessory, for instance, is her gay buddy, Remy (Adam Scott).
Director Robert Luketic brings the same intermittent hilarity, deadly pacing, and uncertainty to "Monster-in-Law" that he did to "Legally Blonde." He desperately turns to wisecracking Wanda Sykes, who plays Viola's exasperated servant, for punch lines even when she's not that funny. Incidentally, Sykes is a black woman whose loyalty to such a narcissistic white lady is an outlandish throwback, to say the least.
But "Monster-in-Law" has a hard enough time justifying its antagonist's monstrosity. It's ridiculous that a woman like Viola, who has pictures of herself with Oprah Winfrey, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama, has to resort to face smacks and crocodile tears to get her way.
It's also insane that Fonda's first big part in so long is so grotesque. But by Hollywood standards, a movie carried with such gusto by a 67-year-old woman has to be considered a miracle. And I'm not sorry to say I enjoyed watching her do it.

         For some reason, probably because I missed "Jersey Girl," "Gigli," "Maid in Manhattan," "The Cell," "Angel Eyes" and "Enough," all I could think about while watching Jennifer Lopez prance through "Monster-in-Law" was how cool and poised she was in "Out of Sight," wrapped in caramel leather and releasing more heat than a polar ice cap. But that was a long time ago. In "Monster-in-Law," directed by Robert Luketic ("Legally Blond," "Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!"), she just gets tangled in her dog leashes and pretends to be Hilary Duff.
 
  So it goes, I guess, with female stars in romantic comedy roles; it's tween's world, etc. But this particular role, as written by development executive turned screenwriter Anya Kochoff, is such a congealed pudding of studio clichés it borders on parody. An aspiring fashion designer, Charlotte "Charlie" Cantilini is a plucky orphan who apparently earns a great living walking dogs and temping. She lives in a bright airy apartment that comes equipped with a quippy gay best friend next door, and she generally dresses like a seventh-grader on her first day of school. She also favors a cutely androgynous nickname. "Charlie" may sound like a simple diminutive, but it's actually romantic comedy code — like "Alex" or "Andy" — for "deeply unthreatening woman-child who is almost like one of the guys, but hot."
 


         






    It's no surprise, then, that Kevin (Michael Vartan), a surgeon in the shape of a Norse sex god, falls in love with Charlie almost instantly after jogging past her on the beach in slow motion. They run into each other again at a party in his honor, where Charlie is passing around appetizers for her friend, the sarcastic caterer. Kevin's evil ex-girlfriend, a slinky blond played by Monet Mazur, tries to throw a wrench in the romance by telling Charlie that Kevin is gay, but mostly the obstacles evaporate like morning mist.
 
  Soon, it's time to take Charlie home to meet mother. Up to this point, Kevin has displayed as much personality and intelligence as a custard, so it's no real surprise that his timing is putrid. Mom happens to be Viola Fields, a famous broadcast journalist who was recently and unceremoniously dumped from her job in order to make way for an airhead decades her junior. Moments after getting fired, Viola lunges for the throat of a Britney Spears clone on the air and lands herself in the loony bin for an extended rest. She's in no mood to meet her son's new girlfriend, who she considers beneath him, and is appalled when he proposes right then and there at tea time.
 
  In her comeback role after a 15-year absence from the movies, Jane Fonda digs into the part of the twinkie-threatened diva in decline with a zeal that suggests she knows the feeling. We're meant to loathe Viola for her snobbery, selfishness and careerism, but it's easier to share her frustration at the triumphant ascendancy of tarted-up mediocrity all around her. Hers is the only speck of emotional honesty in this otherwise insipid and casually insulting fantasy, and you get the feeling Viola would collapse in helpless exasperation before a movie like this one. After all, what is Charlie if not her third up close and personal encounter with the embodiment of everything Viola hates?
 
  The set-up is all very "All About Eve," with Viola and her assistant, Ruby (Wanda Sykes) in the Bette Davis-Thelma Ritter roles and Charlie as the upstart who is trying to steal her life. In another era, Viola and Ruby would have been the stars of the movie, but this being a romantic comedy starring a bankable star, it was not to be. Viola sets out to drive Charlie away by driving her crazy, and when Kevin fails to notice that anything is up, Charlie begins her own campaign of retaliation.
 
  Viola humiliates Charlie at her own engagement party? Charlie picks out a horrid peach gown for her to wear as her matron-of-honor. Viola tries to take over her wedding preparations, then fakes a nervous breakdown when Charlie puts her foot down? Charlie feeds her tripe. Viola keeps her up all night, affecting her pet care career? Charlie lets the dogs loose on her Gucci. And so forth. Things get so hot and heavy between them, that after a while you forget who they're fighting for.
 
  If the vaporous Vartan seems slightly disoriented throughout the movie, he might just be wondering who did Charlie's makeup, and whether charges should be pressed. The one thing it's clear he's not wondering is what's going on between his beloved mother and the girl of his dreams. It would be something, these days, to see a comedy centered on a couple of worldly middle-aged broads having some fun at the expense of a pair of vapid saps. But "Monster-in-Law" is loyal to its lovers to the end. Viola may get a few slaps in (which Charlie gamely returns), but, in the end, she learns a valuable lesson. What do socio-economic differences, career discrepancies, basic incompatibilities and a teenage wardrobe on a thirtysomething matter when there are movie tickets to sell?

 MPAA rating:

 Times guidelines:
 Some mildly saucy language and face-slapping, plus plenty of innuendo A New Line Cinema release. A Robert Luketic film. Director Robert Luketic. Producer Paula Weinstein. Produced by Chris Bender, J.C. Spink. Screenplay by Anya Kochoff, Director of photography Russell Carpenter, A.S.C. Editor Scott Hill, Kevin Tent, A.C.E. Costume designer Kym Barrett. Music David Newman. Art director James F. Truesdale. Running time: 95 minutes. In wide release.   

For her return to screen acting after an absence of 15 years, Jane Fonda has followed instincts analyzable only by Sigmund Freud and Gloria Steinem: To prove that she's still got game, the best-selling autobiographer of My Life So Far  has chosen to play a narcissistic bitch who wages war on a younger woman before undergoing tit-for-tat humiliation in a punitive comedy that tramples on decades of feminist progress with a blithering giggle. In Monster-in-Law , the erstwhile Barbarella, Hanoi Jane, political activist, fitness-tape mogul, and Oscar winner plays Viola Fields, a seasoned former TV journalist who, in one of the many skirmishes she engages in with Jennifer Lopez as her prospective daughter-in-law, passes out at the dinner table, facedown into a plate of tripe.
In doing so, Fonda joins a select sorority of mature, serious actresses made silly by the movies, including Candice Bergen (dropped by a right cross in Sweet Home Alabama ), Isabelle Huppert (covered in mud in  I Heart Huckabees ), and Barbra Streisand (riding Robert De Niro in Meet the Fockers ). Who's come a long way, baby?
At first, Fonda's Viola is one of those career-obsessed, ripe-for-chastisement media-biz news hens who have been around since His Girl Friday  (and Network , and To Die For ). A steely Barbara Walters type, she rules the TV roost until she's axed to make way for a younger and more cleavage-based talent. Then the imperious broadcaster breaks down, takes a rest cure, and returns as a pampered, bitter, drink-prone neurasthenic, tended to by her wisecracking assistant (Wanda Sykes) and absorbed by a possessive (psychologists would diagnose the condition as ''icky'') fixation on her marriageable adult son, Kevin (Michael Vartan), for whom no girl is good enough. That Kevin, ostensibly an upstanding member of the medical profession, is oafishly unaware of his mother's crazy-making manipulations and mischief is his own damn problem.
It's Kevin's reasonable announcement that he, apparently like millions, is in love with La Lopez (I mean, that he wants to marry Charlotte ''Charlie'' Cantilini, a freelance dog walker and would-be fashion designer) that turns Viola into a grotesque she-devil. It's an older woman's acrid jealousy toward a younger one that threatens to sabotage a son's happiness by torturing his girlfriend. And it's Charlie's plucky knack for self-defense (at one point she drugs Viola to outwit the old cow) that leads to the sight of the 67-year-old Fonda glopped with guts and gravy. With comedy like this, who needs Ann Coulter?
And if vapid characters like Charlie are on the ascent as models of girl power, what hope is there for the younger, female contingent in the audience? That Viola actually socializes with world leaders is presented as an act of pretentious intellectual snobbery. Charlie don't know much about history, don't know much geography (she's also a yoga instructor and party waitress when not sketching designs for gowns influenced by Bob Mackie), but what matters is that she's nice. She's sweet. She's got a gay best friend. She's feisty and down-to-earth and unaffected and moderately talented, yet another variation on the dewy Jenny-from-the-block conceit on which the glossy entrepreneur has built her empire: Required to love the bride-to-be, everyone does  or else. (Sykes the resourceful comedian sprinkles what salt she can on the proceedings, but even she is defeated by the inevitable.)
The makers of Monster-in-Law   which was written, with little grace, by first-timer Anya Kochoff and directed by Robert Luketic with the same insistent zest for girl-on-girl warfare he brought to Legally Blonde   have their sights set on hitting the four-quadrant sweet spot, pulling in younger and older, male and female viewers. But in their eagerness to replicate the Meet the Parents  formula for box office success (and in the summit-level negotiations required to accommodate the goals of both Fonda and Lopez), more harm is done than good. Looking marvelous as she does  hurt blue eyes even more luminous, figure trim, self-presentation royal  Fonda is readier than ever to acknowledge the striking, serious artist of Klute she still has it in her to be. She could play tough if she wanted to, or powerful, or dangerous, or sexual  easily imaginable as a politician, a lawyer, a businesswoman, a force who triumphs.
And if the movies don't offer those roles to actresses over 50, well, then, screw the movies: Get thee to television drama, where seasoned actors of both sexes are the real stars. Law & Order , CSI , The Shield  (viva Glenn Close!), and any drama on HBO would benefit, and benefit from Jane Fonda, untroubled by a face full of gravy. As for Monster-in-Law , it's tripe on a plate.

ane Fonda's duplicitous character in "Monster-in-Law" mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid any possible offense that it flees in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. Her screen alter ego, Viola Fields, is a Los Angeles television interviewer of Barbara Walters stature, who goes bonkers and lands in rehab after she is unceremoniously put out to pasture by her youth-obsessed network bosses. Foremost on Viola's list of obsessions is her determination to derail the marriage-bound relationship of her beloved only son, Kevin (Michael Vartan), a handsome surgeon, to Charlotte, a k a Charlie (Jennifer Lopez), a spunky office temp and part-time caterer and dog walker whom Viola considers unworthy of her darling boy. Ravenously biting into her first screen role in 15 years, Ms. Fonda plays Viola in the only way that makes sense, as a self-mocking, comic caricature of the same conflicted personality the actress reveals in her autobiography, "My Life So Far." The role throws crumbs to Ms. Fonda's fans (Viola is a serious, venerated journalist, staunch feminist and ageless beauty on a first-name basis with many world leaders), and slices of cake to her detractors (professionally unmoored, Viola morphs into a bitter, psychopathic control freak and vicious snob). The movie's portrait of an older, unmarried career woman who, having run through four husbands, is pathetically clawing for exclusive possession of a young man who happens to be her son is a demented nightmare vision of modern maturity; one step further and we would be in "Sunset Boulevard" territory. Winking broadly every step of the way, Ms. Fonda infuses her disagreeable character with a zany, good-natured verve that makes Viola palatable even when she is behaving atrociously, which is much of the time. Although the star carries off this balancing act, you have to wonder why Ms. Fonda decided to choose for her return to the screen a comedy so one-dimensional and craven that it makes "Meet the Parents" look avant-garde. Directed by Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde," "Win a Date With Tad Hamilton") from a screenplay by Anya Kochoff, "Monster-in-Law" has just enough laughs (three or four is all it takes nowadays) to make it a likely box-office success. The nerviest joke comes early in the movie, just after the ax has fallen on Viola, when in her final television interview she angrily grills an air-headed Britney-Jessica-Lindsay-Hilary clone. The teenage chirper, when asked what she thinks of Roe v. Wade, replies that she doesn't follow boxing. Viola goes ballistic and lunges at her throat. "Monster-in-Law" suggests that the time has come for Ms. Lopez to abandon romantic comedy for something edgier. At 35, she is too long in the tooth to keep playing Jenny From the Neighborhood, a blushing blue-collar ing�nue tapped to be Cinderella. As she ambles joylessly through the role of Charlie, her heart is obviously not in it. Prince Charming, when first glimpsed jogging on the beach, causes Charlie to gasp with longing, although the couple, when they finally smooch, exhibit no romantic chemistry. A typical modern Hollywood prince, Kevin is a cipher with a cleft chin, carefully groomed stubble and flashy teeth. In the one bizarre instance where he shows signs of a personality, Kevin falls to his knees and proposes marriage during the initial meeting of his sweetheart and his mom. The movie would like to imagine that this Right in Front of Mommy business is cute; to me, it looks sick. In her campaign to destroy Charlie, Viola throws a fancy party engineered to reveal Charlie as a peasant who looks foolish to royalty. When the plan fails, Viola fakes a nervous breakdown, barges into Charlie and Kevin's love nest (while Kevin's away), and tries to drive Charlie crazy with her histrionic neediness. But Charlie quickly catches on to Viola's scheme and fights back. As the two women do battle over clothes, recipes and wedding plans, each plays dirty tricks on the other. Viola has Charlie secretly investigated (Cinderella, of course, is beyond reproach), while Charlie doses Viola with a heavy tranquilizer. Their conflict culminates with a bout of face slapping that offers no comic release, because  the skirmishes preceding it are so petty. You long for the kind of scary domestic battles waged in "The War of the Roses," a comedy that went over the top in the best way. Late in the game, Elaine Stritch drops in to the movie as Viola's horrifying mother and role model for domestic terrorism. If "Monster-in-Law" had a mind and a modicum of courage, it wouldn't run away from the issues of class, ethnicity and age built in to its scenario. The movie's voice of semi-truth belongs to Wanda Sykes, as Viola's wisecracking, not-too-loyal assistant, Ruby. Although Ms. Sykes gives her classic Thelma Ritter role a sassy comic bite, the character's seen-it-all cynicism is diluted with a spoonful of sugar. "Monster-in-Law," despite Ms. Fonda's animated comic presence, is a shrunken, cowardly movie in deep denial of its true nature, which is far uglier than it is ever willing to admit. "Monster-in-Law" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language.

Jane Fonda returns to the screen after 15 years as more a high concept than an actual character in "Monster-in-Law." This shrill, undermotivated, feature-length catfight between Jennifer Lopez's demure prospective bride and Fonda's unhinged prospective mother-in-law makes sure to underline, boldface and exclamation-point every plot turn and line of dialogue. No matter how undernourished the comedy and credibility may be, however, the allure of this star combo enacting this premise will prove irresistible to femme-driven mass audiences, who will make New Line's gaudy romantic farce a big early summer winner.
Revealing instincts more attuned to commercial hooks than to character insight or plausibility, first-time scripter Anya Kochoff's story recycles fairy tale motifs from such previous Lopez vehicles as "The Wedding Planner" and "Maid in Manhattan." And by casting Fonda as a Barbara Walters-like TV host, the film acknowledges the fact that Fonda may be more familiar to young contempo viewers as a celebrity wife-social activist-workout queen than as a thesp.
Fonda's grand entrance is preceded by 15 minutes of innocuous table-setting in which Lopez's Charlie is established as a good girl who juggles jobs as a dog walker, medical receptionist and caterer to make ends meet -- and finally meets her dream man in the person of Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan), a successful young surgeon never lacking for three-day male model stubble.
Within a minute of being introduced, Fonda's Viola Fields, the very picture of an ultra-professional broadcast veteran, is brought low by being summarily fired. On her final show, she deliberately humiliates a dimwitted Britney Spears type by asking her serious questions about subjects like Roe v. Wade (the singer responds by claiming she doesn't follow boxing) before attempting to strangle her interviewee, a move that sends Viola into therapy for months.
Pic could have done with a little of Viola in her prime before the fall; as it is, she's just a madwoman desperate to exert a semblance of the control and authority she formerly wielded. As it is, the only target for her iron whim is her son Kevin's new girlfriend. In a strange scene, Kevin seizes the occasion of the first meeting between Viola and Charlie to get down on his knees and ask Charlie to marry him right in front of his mother.
Notwithstanding the preceding gossip about how Kevin might be gay, this is carrying the notion of a mama's boy to unprecedented lengths. More to the point, however, is how the scene points up Kochoff's having neglected to develop a personality for Kevin at all; for the only child of a fabulously wealthy, career-obsessed celebrity who's just emerged from rehab, Kevin has no issues at all. He's a bland dreamboat, enacted as such by Vartan.
Which leaves things to the two women. Viola goes after Charlie because, in her unfocused fury at the world, she has nothing better to do; "I am going to save my son," she declares.
First she throws a glamorous party meant to make the mere "temp" feel totally out of place. Failing at this, Viola swings in the other direction by dictating every detail of the proposed wedding. At one point, Viola demeans Charlie as a "Latina," unconvincingly so in that this sort of prejudice seems alien to her makeup.
Finally, the sparring becomes physical in a literal bitch-slapping contest that comes off as more inevitable than particularly outrageous or entertaining. When Viola's onetime mother-in-law, played by the ever-formidable Elaine Stritch, at length turns up to restore order, the effect should be far more satisfying than it is. But the sense is, if Charlie can handle Viola, she's going to roll right over the terminally tame Kevin, now that she's got him all to herself.
Looking tip-top and attractively photographed by Russell Carpenter, Fonda brings a businesslike approach to her portrayal of irrationality and hysteria. Certainly she's the main attraction here, as Lopez delivers her customary low-key, emotionally open perf that provides easy but uncompelling access. Wanda Sykes provides verve to the borderline anachronistic role of Viola's sassy black assistant who always has a remark to make about her boss's antics. Charlie has her own sidekick, gay neighbor Remy (Adam Scott), to deliver quips about her choices.
"Legally Blonde" helmer Robert Luketic is content to make the proceedings bright and snappy and leave it at that. Making things feel even more contrived and cutesy than they already are is David Newman's score, a noodling creation that doesn't offer music so much as mood punctuation.

"I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive," intones the luxuriantly dissolute matriarch to her teenage son in Georges Bataille 's 1966 novella Ma Mère . This week's pair of formidable mothers superior turn cartwheels on the thin line between love and hate, transforming into rapacious gargoyles in a fiery apotheosis of self-abnegating devotion to their flummoxed mama's boys (only children both!). They're also, as embodied by Jane Fonda  and Isabelle Huppert , smolderingly fine, twin ideals of burnished autumnal womanhood. In the jackbooted farce Monster-in-Law , Fonda's suddenly jobless TV news queen channels all of her displaced type-A mania into derailing her son's engagement, while in Christophe Honoré 's literal-minded Bataille adaptation, Huppert's recently widowed lady of leisure works through her grief by inducting junior into her nightclub society of sordid sexual compulsion. As British talk show axiom Trisha Goddard  would quip, "That's mothering with a capital S ."
Essentially Meet the Parents  redux with Fonda in the scarifying De Niro role, Monster-in-Law  marks a continuation of Jennifer Lopez 's affinity for chaste, earthy gals in low-level employment who innocently snag pale males with fat wallets. Her Charlie is a cheerful, unambitious temp who always awakens in full makeup, a believer in karma and walker of dogs. Perhaps mindful of any dissonance with her supersize public persona, Lopez overcompensates with a squeaky little-girl cutesiness that may divert more sympathy to the titular she-beast's corner than intended. Apparently, J.Lo also has a clause in her contract obligating each of her directors to a Bottom-Dollar Shot, here occasioned when Charlie's prospective mother-in-law cruelly gives her a tiny frock that fits like a sausage casing over her lingeringly showcased derriere. "I have two asses," wails Charlie. If only! One could launch Lo's latest fragrance while the other tours with Marc Anthony .
Sabotage by couture is the least of the guerrilla tactics deployed against Charlie by Fonda's Viola, a Walters-esque media doyenne left with far too much time on her bejeweled hands after she's toppled from her throne by a demographically correct bimbo. Millionaire Viola is enraged that her blandly handsome surgeon offspring, Kevin (Michael Vartan ), is marrying down; he impulsively asks for Charlie's hand in front of Mom, a decent indicator of just how close these home fires burn. Handy with her fists, possessed of a soul-freezing witchy cackle, the single-minded Viola guzzles cough syrup at crisis moments and doesn't blanch at photo surveillance or poisoning the gravy. (Fonda says she based the character on ex-husband Ted Turner .)
Legally Blonde  director Robert Luketic  bumbles along with typically clumsy blocking and framing, and the misogyny inherent in the three-ring spectacle of bitch slaps, barbiturate covert ops, and wedding plan hysteria does rankleCharlie really loses her shit when Viola arrives at her ceremony wearing white . All the same, hail the conquering heroine Fonda, absent from the big screen for 15 years, looking supernaturally fabulous at 67those eyes! those legs! and delivering a relaxed yet utterly committed performance in humble service of a little marketing synergy with her autobiography. Tapping comic gifts that have lain fallow for the quarter-century since 9 to 5 , Fonda forges a spirited rapport with an ad-libbing Wanda Sykes ; as Ruby, Viola's long-suffering personal assistant, the redoubtable Sykes coolly dismantles her Sassy Black Sidekick role with a level gaze and killer timing.
"I always thought that Kevin looked like Jesus," Viola muses in just one of many lines calculated to send Charlie screaming for the hills. In Ma Mère , the churchgoing good son Pierre (Louis Garrel ) endures a passion of sorts, dragged along on a self-mortifying, crypto-religious quest for ultimate transgression and totalized carnal abjection, as personified by his godlike Maman, all-knowing in her "perfect depravity." That's at least the arguable gist of Bataille's perhaps unadaptable book, which director Honoré translates on-screen as an interminable back-and-forth of joyless orgasmic frenzy and postcoital vacationers' lull. On holiday in the Canaries, Pierre's sad-sack father dies, and red-hot Mom (Huppert, sleepwalking through another affectless-hedonist role) responds with a series of assignments for her son: Clear out Papa's office, fuck this girl in public while I watch, etc.
Lurching toward its inevitable incestuous showdown, Ma Mère  makes a few hilarious attempts at the cerebral (one philosophical inquiry begins, "If I love Hansi's ass so much . . . ") but can't transcend its own suffocating milieu, a moneyed purgatorio  where spoiled brats exorcise their demons by pissing on Dad's nudie-mag stash and firing the help in a drunken snit. Like Monster-in-Law , Ma Mère  goes down easiest as a strong antidote to class envyit's a relief to discover that idle wealth is an intractable state of miserable, deranging torpor.
