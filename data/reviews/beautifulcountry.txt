         "The Beautiful Country" is a grueling epic about a young man (Damien Nguyen), born of a Vietnamese woman and an American soldier, who becomes determined to make his way to America and locate his father in Texas. It is a straightforward, conventional narrative, charting seemingly endless cruelty and hardship, but rewards the patient with an eloquent climactic sequence that is impossible to predict and in which Nick Nolte, arriving late in the picture, reminds viewers just what a strong, expressive presence he is.
 
  The time is 1990, and Nguyen's Binh is living in the countryside with a family to whom he may actually be related. He stands out for his height and his striking looks but has suffered abuse and discrimination for his mixed ancestry. His elderly foster mother — who may in fact be his grandmother or great aunt — tells him he must leave if her daughter is to marry, revealing for the first time that his mother, Mai (Chau Thi Kim Xuan), is alive and living in Ho Chi Minh City. A beautiful but worn woman, Mai is more slave than servant for a rich and nasty grande dame who is persuaded to take on Binh as a houseboy only to suffer a fatal accident for which Binh is sure to be blamed.
 


         






    Mai just happens to know about a fishing vessel, which takes on "boat people" refugees, and presses on her son $2,000 she has saved, insisting that Binh take his little half brother Tam (Tran Dang Quoc Thinh), whose father may well be that grande dame's even nastier son. She also gives Binh her marriage certificate, which lists her husband's Houston address.
 
  Seemingly endless misery and villainy loom for Binh and Tam — worst of all aboard a Manhattan-bound freighter. Along the way Binh meets a hooker with a heart of gold (Bai Ling), a hardened human trafficker (Temuera Morrison) and a heartless but intelligent ship captain (Tim Roth). Binh encounters kindness in hitching rides to Houston, where there's more grief in store for him.
 
  None of the inhumanity Binh experiences defies credibility, but writer Sabina Murray surely piles it on, and director Hans Petter Moland's straight-ahead approach does nothing to alleviate the heavy going that makes up most of the film. To his credit, Moland knows how to change course when at last the film's mood begins to lighten — like the sun's rays starting to poke through after a storm.
 
  Newcomer Nguyen is convincingly resilient as a young man who early on learns how to live deep within himself. In its workmanlike way, "The Beautiful Country" plows through adversity like its hero — and like him, ends up getting somewhere.

Handsomely photographed yet relentlessly grim, The Beautiful Country  tells the story of Binh (Damien Nguyen), the Vietnamese son of an American GI father, who is despised by his foster family as bui doi  ''less than dust''  for his parentage. And as the story begins in 1990, the young man sets out, against every odd imaginable by screenwriter Sabina Murray, first to find his mother in Saigon, and then his father in Texas. (Dad is played with random eccentricity by Nick Nolte.)
Hans Petter Moland's stern instructional drama about gentle resolve in the face of inhumanity puts Binh through a litany of miseries (including internment in a Malaysian refugee camp where he befriends Bai Ling as a Chinese prostitute, and a harrowing ocean voyage on a ship of evil with Tim Roth as captain). And America  the beauty in the title is bitter  barely provides a respite, particularly in the bowels of New York's Chinatown. (Texas, at least, with its nice Mexican immigrants, is A-OK with Moland.) Inside the Norwegian director's glove of empathy is a fist of unappeasable anger.

 The title of "The Beautiful Country," an earnestly humane film by the Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland, refers both to Vietnam, where the story begins, and to the United States, where it concludes. Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography testifies to the truth of the description in both cases, beautifully capturing the humid, verdant landscape of the Vietnamese countryside and the dry, craggy plains of west Texas, as well as the bustle of Hanoi and Manhattan. The hero, Binh (Damien Nguyen), belongs to both countries, and therefore to neither. The son of a Vietnamese woman and an American G.I., he lives as a pariah in postwar Vietnam, performing menial labor and enduring the contempt of the relatives who grudgingly allow him to live with them.  The year is 1990, midway between the fall of Saigon and the present day, and Binh, like a cast-off stepchild in a Grimm fairy tale, sets off to find his way in the world. In the city, he finds his mother, Mai (Chau Thi Kim Xuan), who works as a household servant for a wealthy family, and a young half-brother named Tam (Tran Dang Quoc Thinh). The victory of Communism has apparently not entirely done away with class divisions, and Mai is bullied by the imperious lady of the house and manhandled by her loutish son. After a somewhat improbable household accident, Binh must flee again, this time to America, with Tam in tow and with Mai's faded marriage certificate as Binh's only clue to his father's whereabouts. (The opening titles offer a hint that the father will turn out to be Nick Nolte.) Binh and Tam land first at a refugee camp in Malaysia, where they befriend Ling (Bai Ling), a Chinese prostitute who accompanies them on the next leg of their journey, aboard a dilapidated boat carrying a human cargo of desperate souls from all over Asia.  The basic narrative of "The Beautiful Country" is powerful and timely. Relations between the United States and Vietnam may have evolved in the last 15 years, but the global traffic in human labor is, if anything, a more acute and pervasive problem today, and the middle section of the movie presents some of its cruelties without blinking. While Sabina Murray's screenplay is hardly immune to sentimental excess, it does, like Binh himself, succeed through a kind of clumsy stubbornness. At first, Binh does not seem especially resourceful. He is quiet and slow-moving, and the height he has inherited from his Texas father makes him look especially awkward next to his smaller Vietnamese countrymen. Mr. Nguyen is an actor of more determination than range, and he is forced to say some pretty corny lines in halting, heavily accented English. After a while, though, a patient charisma emerges, and his performance overcomes some of the obstacles placed in its path by the script.  These consist mainly of speeches that spell out themes and emotions grander than anything dramatized on screen. It is never a good thing when characters philosophize about their misery, and worse when those responsible for that misery take their turn. The worst culprit in this regard is Tim Roth, who plays the scarily soft-spoken captain of the ship that carries Ling, Tam and Binh to New York. "You have an independent mind," the captain says to Binh. "Some people admire that. I'm not one of them."  Still, it is hard not to admire the independence and ambition of "The Beautiful Country," even if the film does fall short of its epic intentions. Its best parts are not the overwrought, underwritten scenes in which Binh and Ling pour out their hearts in English that is meant to be all the more poetic for missing articles and auxiliary verbs, but rather those quieter moments that light upon odd, telling details. In their cargo hold, for example, the migrants pass the time by conducting a tournament, complete with side bets, in which contestants compete to see who can rattle off more brand names, sports teams and other useful bits of contemporary American commercial jargon.  Mr. Nolte, appearing in a few scenes at the end, brings a rugged gravity to the story's gentle, elliptical conclusion. Like much else in the film, the reunion between Binh and his father exists on the far edge of credibility, but its overall delicacy and sincerity of feeling make its faults forgivable. Which is fitting enough, since forgiveness, after all, is both the movie's subject and its guiding spirit.  "The Beautiful Country" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some violence and strong language.

The knockout punch is a long time coming, but it's worth the wait in "The Beautiful Country," tale of a young Vietnamese-American's odyssey to find his former-G.I. father stateside. Sidestepping most of the Asian and search-for-roots cliches inherent in such material, and buoyed by a low-key perf from Tim Roth en route and a splendid showing by Nick Nolte in the powerful final reels, film reps a qualified success by Norwegian helmer Hans Petter Moland in his second offshore "road" movie after "Aberdeen" (2000). Cutting by at least 20 minutes could equip this for warm specialist distribution in upmarket locations.
In Hoa Nam, Vietnam, 1990, 20-year-old mixed-race Binh (Damien Nguyen) lives with foster parents in a village. Treated like a servant, Binh spends his days doing agricultural chores, catching fish with his bare hands and dreaming of finding the parents he never knew. The only clues he has are a photo of himself as a baby, with his mom and dad in front of a Saigon hairdresser's, and the description that his father "had very big feet."
Early scenes are almost impressionistic, sketching village life in a restrained, unexotic way. Told that his mother, Mai (Chau Thi Kim Xuan), is still alive, Binh sets off to track her down in Ho Chi Minh City (present-day Saigon), where she's now employed as a servant in an upper-class home.
The restraint that is to pay major dividends in the final stages is evident early on, as Mai greets her long-lost son with simple emotion, feeling him with her hands as if to register his actual presence. Weak from years of hard work, and with a baby son, Tam (Tran Dang Quoc Thinh), Mai manages to convince the stern materfamilias
, Mrs. Hoa (Anh Thu), to take on Binh as a handyman. But when Hoa accidentally dies in a tussle with Binh over a jade artifact, Mai and her two sons go on the run.
Knowing she's dying, Mai gives Binh all her savings and tells him to take himself and Tam to the U.S. She also gives him her wedding certificate, which has the address of his father in Houston, Texas. She cautions Binh to "ask for nothing" if he succeeds in his quest.
Joining a group of boat people, Binh is eventually put ashore in Malaysia, where he's incarcerated in a refugee camp with a motley group of other Asian illegals, including a Cantonese huckster, Chingmy (Hong Kong comic thesp Chapman To), and a hard-nosed young woman from northern China, Ling (Bai Ling). A bond forms between Binh and Ling that leads them to escape during a camp riot; they board a rusty tanker, captained by the morose, ruthless Oh (Tim Roth), that's transporting illegals to the U.S.
Almost an hour in, the movie has vacillated between an intriguingly offbeat take on its protag's spiritual journey -- one remarkable sequence, recalling co-producer Terrence Malick's own filmmaking bent, shows just Binh and Tam silently enjoying landfall on a Malaysian beach -- to more cliched fare like Mai being abused by Mrs. Hoa's evil son (Khuong Duc Thuan) or Ling as the ambitious camp tart.
One prime candidate for cutting is a sequence where Ling entertains the increasingly love-struck Binh with a private perf of a Mandarin song.
Helmer Moland shows his Scandi roots in the long second act set aboard Oh's rust-bucket, as it chugs along through cold seas and colder light. Pic's propensity for scenes set either at night or in darkly lit interiors reaches its apogee here, as the human cargo in the ship's hold is subjected to bullying, near-starvation and even death. Oh takes a liking to Binh, and even offers him a permanent job on his boat (which Binh turns down).
At the 90-minute mark, Binh finally makes it to the U.S. as an illegal immigrant. But it's only here that his personal story really begins, with several surprises en route to finding his dad (Nolte), and a finale that's as emotionally wrenching as it is unexpected and restrained.
Refreshingly, Moland and d.p. Stewart Dryburgh, while taking advantage of the widescreen ratio, hardly exoticize either East or West, lensing Ho Chi Minh City and New York in exactly the same way. Similarly, Hoa Nam (with its characteristic islands) and Texas (with its big open skies and plains) are contrasted, but not over-beautified. Point seems to be that for Binh, a handyman with no special skills, these environs are all much the same -- places to earn a living and survive as he seeks personal closure.
Film's major weakness, exposed by length, is the main protag, who, in Nguyen's downcast, dog-like perf, doesn't involve the viewer enough in much of the pre-Stateside material. Early going is enhanced by Chau Thi's quietly moving playing as Binh's mom; and the middle section by Roth's deceptively edgy portrait of the tanker captain, a lonely mariner who, when he berates Binh for falling for the lure of America ("I offer you a new life; you choose an old dream"), can't name an alternative.
Standout performance, however, is by Nolte who, in the final 20 minutes, draws on a deep reservoir of playing broken romantic heroes to portray Binh's father. The subtle, resonant scenes between the two men are worth the price of admission.
Technically, the production is pro at all levels, though some of the pidgin English by Asians is indistinct.
Pic's title, from an unexplained remark by Ling, refers to the Chinese name for America: This literally means "beautiful country" (mei guo
). In a neat irony, for Nolte's character (as for Roth's) "the beautiful country" is actually someplace else.
