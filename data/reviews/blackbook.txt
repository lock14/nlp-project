         Like many of its characters, "Black Book" is engaged in acts of deception. It appears to be an old-fashioned World War II movie, but that turns out to be a ruse. As epic as its two-hours-and-25-minute running time indicates, "Black Book" is as subversive as it is traditional, both enamored of conventional notions of heroism and frankly contemptuous of them.
 
 All these pleasantly dizzying contradictions, as well as the film's great energy and breakneck speed, come courtesy of director Paul Verhoeven, making his first film in his native Holland in more than 20 years and returning to the subject matter of his premier international hit, 1977's "Soldier of Orange."
 


         






   In the years since, Verhoeven has made quite the splash in Hollywood, directing, among others, "Basic Instinct," "RoboCop" and the ever-notorious "Showgirls." But fearful, he has said in interviews, that he was "losing my soul" through involvement in standard studio projects (anyone who's seen his "Hollow Man" will sympathize), Verhoeven reunited with his longtime Dutch collaborator, screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, in a project about a beautiful Jewish spy infiltrating the highest echelons of the Nazi occupation. It's a project the two men have been tinkering with for decades.
 
 Now that it is on the screen, "Black Book" reinforces the notion that World War II is the subject that suits Verhoeven best. It's a canvas large enough to contain his various manias, excesses and idiosyncracies  and keep them from overwhelming the story. It also showcases his gift for involving action. This is a film in which everyone is on the move at all times,  incident piles on incident and, as shot by Karl Walter Lindenlaub and edited by Job ter Burg and James Herbert, more can happen on the screen in five minutes than other pictures manage in hours.
 
 It's not just that things happen; it's the way they take place. As viewers of "Starship Troopers" can testify, Verhoeven has the ability to make things especially visceral and intense. His occupied Holland has a sensibility a world apart from "the greatest generation" pieties: It's a terrifying, unsettling location where expectations are always reversed and interlocking webs of secrecy and betrayal leave everyone always on edge.
 
 There are claims on all sides for the moral high ground, and the Nazis' insistence that they are "fighting against terrorism for a free Europe" is the script's clear nod to the current situation in Iraq. Despite the claims, the occupation and its aftermath are unapologetically viewed by "Black Book" as a distinctly anarchic and amoral time  in which heroism and treachery are hard to tell apart, a time in which the director, who is clearly disgusted by moral smugness and "to the victor go the spoils" triumphalism, couldn't be more at home.
 
 Given that it is a Verhoeven film, along with the amorality goes considerable sexual energy. "Black Book" does not stint on either nudity or candid bedroom scenes, and it is likely the only World War II drama ever where the heroine is shown dying her pubic hair blond to better fight the Nazis. Thank God John Wayne didn't live to see this.
 
 That intrepid young woman starts out in 1944 as Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a dark-haired Jewish singer hiding from the Nazis with a Christian family who delight in telling her, "If the Jews had listened to Jesus, they wouldn't be in such a mess now."
 
 Grim as it is, that situation doesn't last long, and neither does a lot of the rest that happens to Rachel early on. Suffice to say that after several catastrophic encounters, she ends up a member of the Dutch Resistance. There her assignment is to turn herself into the blond Ellis de Vries, the better to vamp high-ranking German officer Ludwig Müntze and gain vital information. Asked how far she is prepared to go, this determined young person doesn't hesitate for even a second.
 
 Because Müntze is played by the sensitive-looking German actor Sebastian Koch, who was the playwright in "The Lives of Others," we get an early hint that this stamp-collecting Nazi is not going to be a leering sadist of the "Hangmen Also Die" variety. And his relationship with Rachel/Ellis turns out to be more complex than either one expects at the outset.
 
 The supporting actors in "Black Book" (including Koch, Halina Reijn as party girl Ronnie, Thom Hoffman as Resistance stalwart Hans Akkermans and Waldermar Kobus as evil Nazi officer Günther Franken) are uniformly strong, but it is the breakthrough work of Van Houten that truly carries the picture.
 
 An award-winning performer in Holland, Van Houten carries off this complex role with aplomb. Unselfconsciously flirtatious, with an intoxicating smile, Rachel is a hellion with nerves of steel, someone who simply won't be kept down. She is Verhoeven's representative on screen, the life force that has helped give a renewed sense of purpose to both the veteran director and the venerable World War II genre he's taken on.

Psssst, want to see a dirty picture about good Nazis, bad Resistance fighters, and a fast-thinking, quick-stripping Jewish woman happy to dye her pubic hair blond and sleep with the enemy in the name of freedom? Have I got a lulu for you: Black Book  may be the looniest use of the Holocaust as a playground since Roberto Benigni served up his infernal clown act in Life Is Beautiful. The difference is, Benigni turned cartwheels for laughs, while Paul Verhoeven  yes, that Verhoeven, the Dutch filmmaker whose Hollywood résumé includes Basic Instinct, Showgirls , and Starship Troopers   approaches his historical soap opera with cold-eyed seriousness.
The result isn't without its queasy fascinations. By the time she has joined the Dutch Resistance, changed her name, dyed her nethers, and accepted the assignment of seducing a Nazi bigwig (The Lives of Others ' magnetic Sebastian Koch) in order to spy on his headquarters, young Ellis de Vries (Carice van Houten, comely and abundantly naked) has already survived more than her share of perils, including the murder of her family. Then, once Ellis is on the inside, Verhoeven and his screenplay collaborator Gerard Soeteman indulge their basic instincts for sexual and political power games: Who's dominant, who's submissive, and who's due for a reversal of fortune. Yet for all the moral rug-pulling  the Nazi who turns out to have a conscience, the partisans who betray one another  there's little collective value to the assembled transgressions. Relentless plot twists only guarantee that nearly every character experiences some sort of triumph, as well as some sort of shame or humiliation. (Only one, however, is punished with a torrential shower of human excrement, the kind of baroque Verhoevenian invention that keeps audiences murmuring, ''How European!'')
Black Book is the first picture the director has made in his native country in two decades, and the furlough from Hollywood has reinvigorated him. He's now energized to declare  with devilish skill  that Life Is Ugly.

 Paul Verhoeven’s supremely vulgar romp “Black Book” takes off in September 1944. A young Jewish woman, the unsinkable Rachel Stein — played with ferocious energy by the Dutch actress Carice van Houten — has been squirreling herself away with a Christian farm family when an American bomber blows their house to smithereens.  Not one to let an Allied payload cramp her style, Rachel picks herself up, dusts herself off and flings herself into the open arms of a passing swain,   the first in a series of dashing rescuers who will accompany her through tangles of intrigue and steamy romances in a Holocaust story like few others.  Having first earned international attention with crudely effective Dutch entertainments like “Soldier of Orange,” Mr. Verhoeven went Hollywood, starting in the late 1980s, with increasingly slicker, steadily less effective entertainments like “Basic Instinct”  and “Showgirls.” “Black Book” is the first film he has shot in his native country in more than 20 years, and it shows in its vigor, in the strained seams of its construction and in its willful irreverence toward its subject — particularly its insistence that there are no obvious villains, even in the middle of a Nazi occupation. Written by Mr. Verhoeven and his sometimes screenwriter, Gerard Soeteman, “Black Book” encompasses the best and very worst of its director’s signature pulp brutalism, which means it’s pretty much a hoot.  Despite the non-Hollywood genesis of   the project, “Black Book” relies on the same formula that has fueled Mr. Verhoeven’s big-studio career, namely frenzied sex and violence, bodies thrashing with the ecstasy of coitus and thrashing into paroxysms of death, sometimes at the same time. The thrashing rarely lets up in “Black Book,” a film in which a Jewish woman’s body is saved from the off-camera death camps, gas chambers and ovens to become a site of negotiation, a means of survival and an erotic spectacle. Abused and misused, stripped and stripped again, Rachel — named, it’s worth noting, for the mother of Israel — survives by masking that body with a putatively Aryan disguise.  She also falls for a Nazi.  Not any old Nazi, but the head of the Gestapo in The Hague, where Rachel has landed after fleeing an ambush that claims her brother and parents. Now working for the resistance, Rachel signs up for the ultimate Mata Hari assignment and agrees to bed Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch) so she can uncover Gestapo secrets. She does that and more. After dyeing her hair a brassy blond, Rachel insinuates herself into the superdashing Nazi’s confidences and, soon enough, his bedroom. It takes just one glance at the top of her head with its creeping dark roots for Müntze to guess the truth. Grasping her naked breasts in her hands, Rachel pleads her case with Shakespearean gravitas, “Hath not a Jew, er, eyes?”  Yowza! In truth, Rachel — now called Ellis — asks of her breasts and then her hips, “Are these Jewish?” Seduced by the pertness of her argument or perhaps that of her physicality, attractively framed by black garters and stockings, Müntze answers her question silently but firmly. Taken in by his sensitivity and, no doubt, his decision to spare her life — during one pillow talk, this nice Nazi shares how his wife and children died in an Allied bombing — Rachel finds herself forced to navigate an increasingly ticklish line between duty and desire. It’s a line made all the more wobbly by the pileup of plot complications that Mr. Verhoeven wildly races through, giving the film the frantic feel of an old-time movie serial on methamphetamine.  Mr. Verhoeven’s cartoon realism, accentuated by the sitcom lighting,  the primitively staged gun battles,  the gnashing teeth, whizzing bullets and thundering score, has its hard-surface appeal. Designed for distraction (the frequently timed gunfights suggest as much), “Black Book” works only if you take it for the pulpiest of fiction, not a historical gloss, its stated claims to “true events” notwithstanding. It also helps if you don’t worry about its loosey-goosey moral relativism, which, among other things, involves one character’s stating that at least some of the Dutch are no better than the Nazis, a point that Mr. Verhoeven tries to enforce by reconfiguring an outrage from Brian De Palma’s horror classic “Carrie.” Dumping a bucket of human feces on your heroine certainly makes a point, however foully.  Given the signal-to-noise ratio here, it’s too bad that Mr. Verhoeven doesn’t spend more time on the film’s most provocative image, which shows a Holocaust survivor tucked behind a barbed-wire fence on an Israeli kibbutz in 1956 and indicates that Jewish survival remains a never-ending story.  “Black Book” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes many gun battles, a big container of upended human waste, crude language and full-frontal nudity.

Hollywood-honed tech smarts and European character sensibilities mesh entertainingly in pacy WWII resistance thriller "Black Book," helmer Paul Verhoeven's first feature in his native Netherlands for more than 20 years. Fictional tale, about a young Jewish woman who falls for a Gestapo officer while seeking revenge for her family's murders, moves like an express train across almost 2� hours without any sense of rush and with strong, empathetic characters etched en route. Pre-sold to 50 territories (though so far not the U.S.), pic should easily slide into the black in non-Anglo territories, where the largely Dutch-German dialogue won't be a problem.
Anyone expecting a return to the rough, socially transgressive pics that Verhoeven first made a name with in the Netherlands will be disappointed by "Black Book." Film plays like a Euro version of his Stateside movies -- a technically slick, mainstream production that toys around in subtle ways with the genre in which it moves.
This could prove a problem in the U.S., as the film defiantly doesn't fall into the normal Hollywood-style, heart-on-sleeve template of nasty Nazis, persecuted Jews and unconflicted resistance warriors. It's also many notches above his earlier WWII drama, the heroic "Soldier of Orange" (1977), in complexity and production values.
Reunited with Dutch scripter Gerard Soeteman, with whom he made cheeky early classics like "Turkish Delight," "Spetters" and "The Fourth Man," Verhoeven has seemingly rethought all the usual cliches of WWII dramas. And as usual, he decided to mess a little with his audience's head.
There are no simple heroes or villains in the fast-paced, heavily plotted pic. And though there's little out-and-out comedy, there's still a sense of Verhoeven and Soeteman having some fun while keeping viewers on their toes and occasionally letting rip with gunfire and action. (Latter is always explosively staged, with granite-hard bullet play.)
Story is bookended by scenes on an Israeli kibbutz in 1956, where Rachel Rosenthal, nee Stein (Dutch thesp du jour Carice van Houten), accidentally meets former wartime friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn, spirited). This spurs one long flashback to WWII. The brief return to Israel at pic's end contains one rapid visual trope that may pass many auds by.
Main story, starting in Holland in September 1944, plunges straight into the action, with Rachel hiding out in the countryside with a strict Christian family. From the off, Soeteman keeps the dialogue loaded -- "If the Jews had listened to Jesus, we wouldn't be in the state we're in now," quips the family's sour-faced paterfamilias (Bert Luppes). But mostly he keeps the story moving forward in rapid brush-strokes.
Rachel narrowly escapes being blown to smithereens, is reunited with her family as they're shipped south by mysterious resistance worker Van Gein (Peter Blok, ghoulish), and is the only survivor when their boat is ambushed by an SS craft commanded by leering Guenther Franken (Waldemar Kobus, earthy).
Assigned the name Ellis de Vries, she gets work in a food plant run by communist resistance worker Gerben Kuipers (vet Derek de Lint), and five months later is involved in undercover missions.
During one of these, she gets to know local Gestapo chief Ludwig Muentze (Sebastian Koch), whom she first beds on resistance instructions and then falls for while working in his office. In the same office is Franken, whose sexual needs are catered to by co-worker Ronnie, an easy-come, easy-go girl.
That's just the first hour of an incredibly dense plot that sees Muentze morph into a sympathetic character -- and not through any simple conversion. Also, the loyalties of the resistance workers all come under suspicion when an opportunity to rescue Kuipers' imprisoned son goes horribly wrong. When peace is declared, the story is far from over, with multiple twists in the tale.
Notably, film uses no docu footage or devices like newspaper headlines to bolster the ongoing sense of the war and Nazi power waning. Focus is always on the (sizable) cast of central characters, and even Rachel/Ellis' Jewishness becomes almost peripheral to the action. Both that and all the characters' conflicted emotions are treated in an unsentimental, practical way as the tumblers in Soeteman's tightly constructed script click into place.
Rarely off-camera, Van Houten, only 29, throws herself into the part of a lifetime, with a face that can spin on a dime between fear, defiance, caprice and caring. But for all of Verhoeven's technical skills, the film still wouldn't work without her on-screen chemistry with Koch (the writer in "The Lives of Others"), who makes Muentze a tragically flawed figure rather than simple villain.
All the film's reported $22 million budget -- largest ever for a majority Dutch-language production -- is up on the screen, with costumes and production design having a convincingly lived-in feel. Anne Dudley's big orchestral score is too generic and themeless, but, along with the trim editing, does keep the full-bodied widescreen lensing by d.p. Karl Walter Lindenlaub ("Independence Day") moving.
Film will rep the Netherlands in the next Academy Awards' foreign-language category.

Holland 's gift to world cinema, Paul Verhoeven  can be a very bad boy and a very good filmmaker. Any of his movies could have been titled Basic Instinct not least his epic World War II thriller Black Book , in which a Jewish chanteuse, who watched the Nazis massacre her family, struggles to survive in occupied Holland, joining the Dutch resistance and romancing a suave SS commandant .
Black Book , which takes its title from a secret list of Dutch collaborators, is an impressively old-fashioned yet fashionably embittered moviethe most expensive Holland has ever produced. Copious cheap thrills are presented with high-noon clarity, despite the misty moral confusion that renders many Dutch characters no better than their German conquerors. Bringing it all back home, Verhoeven has created the antithesis of his last World War II saga, the rueful, civilized resistance drama Soldier of Orange  (itself once the most lavish of Dutch movies). Two decades in Tinseltown, with prolonged exposure to the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger , Michael Douglas , and Joe Eszterhas  surely honed Verhoeven's perversity. Some found the monstrous bugs in his intergalactic raid campaign Starship Troopers  more sympathetic than the film's humanoids (and, even in Black Book , the Germans are scarcely worse than Verhoeven's adopted countrymenit's hardly coincidental that the Gestapo  rails against "negotiating with terrorists," or that the most extensive scene of torture would involve waterboarding).
Moral relativism reigns, but blessed with a resourceful and attractive protagonist (Carice van Houten  as Rachel Stein ), Black Book  doesn't dwell on it. There's as much pandering as pondering. The movie whips along, unafraid of narrative excess or hairpin plot turns. Verhoeven, 68, was an impressionable child during the Nazi occupation ("It was like big special effects in the sky," he told The New York Times  ), and the war is explicitly presented as a remembered welter of sensationsmeant to break your heart before it even begins. The movie opens in October 1956 with a busload of Holy Land tourists stopping by the Sea of Galilee  for a glimpse of "what is called a kibbutz." There, a Dutch woman, now married to a Canadian, recognizes Rachel: "You're Jewish?!"
The two exchange awkward pleasantries, the tour bus pulls out, and with indescribable sadness, Rachel sits alone at the edge of the water to relive the movie we now watch. A dozen years earlier, she was hiding with a Dutch farm familyforced to recite from the New Testament in order to get her dinner. ("If the Jews had listened to Jesus . . ." the farmer muses.) Verhoeven, whose anti-clericalism is a given, has his own sense of cosmic justice. Five minutes later a German bomber sheds its payload on the farmhouse and Rachel is on her own with no direction known.
Cool, courageous, free-spirited, totally affirmative, and loyal to a fault, Rachel is compared at various points to Jean Harlow  and Greta Garbo ; she's pure life force as well as a starlate in the movie she hurls herself off a balcony as if into a mosh pit. This character may be the only Dutch Jewish heroine since Anne Frank  (although both were actually German Jewish refugees). But against all odds, this Jewess refuses to die. She alone survives a horrific bloodbath, smuggled to safety in a coffin, and enlists with the underground as a courier. In the course of her duties, she meets and vamps a handsome Gestapo officer (Sebastian Koch , here, as in The Lives of Others , the lone Good German in a schweinehund  world).
Rachel's comrades assign her to first infiltrate the officer's bed and then his headquarters. In an unmistakable Verhoeven touch, she bleaches her pubic hair blond; in another characteristic twist, the SS man immediately figures out that this curiously obliging cutie must be a Jew. Desire wins out (and ultimately love). As Rachel is unburdened by Calvinist guilt or Communist sanctimony, her instincts, per Verhoeven, are basically healthy; this affair is less an example of Night Porter ish s/m than the recognition of mutual loss. Indeed, from Rachel's perspective, far worse than sleeping with the enemy is the nightmare of entertaining an SS partyparticularly when Rachel recognizes the pasty-faced, dead-eyed beast banging away on the piano as the man who butchered her family.
Verhoeven has insisted that Black Book , which he and his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman  began working on 20 years ago, is based on historical cases. No specific sources are given, but the movie is underscored by two discomfiting facts. First is the relatively late and weak Dutch resistance to the Germans; second is the dramatically low percentage of Dutch Jews who survived the war. Both perhaps are related to the Nazi classification of the Dutch as a "Germanic people" and a corresponding Dutch willingness to collaborate. With few exceptions, Rachel is exploited, vilified, and sold out by her gentile countrymen. Anti-Semitism is never far below the surface: "The bitch betrayed us. What a sneaky Jewish trick!"
Shit floats on the Day of Reckoning, and Rachel nearly drowns in it, stuck in an impromptu Dutch detention camp staffed by a drunken hymn-singing rabble. "I never thought I'd dread liberation," she says. That's the movie's melancholy moral. Repeatedly buried and resurrected, Rachel is a miraculous survivor. But as the final shot makes clear, resettlement in Israel  hardly marks the end of her travail. Like the hero of RoboCop  and Verhoeven's planned Jesus movie, she's another one of his non-Christian Christs.
