It's hardly the most gracefully made indie on the block  more like a whole season of a sitcom crammed into one feature. But Breakfast With Scot  deserves sympathetic attention, if only for the family-values specifics loaded into the story, and the way mildmannered stars Ben Shenkman (Angels in America ) and Tom Cavanagh (Ed ) embrace their instructional roles: They play a ''straight-style'' gay couple (one's a former hockey pro) who become the temporary guardians of an orphaned 11-year-old boy (Noah Bernett). Bad news for the low-profile duo: The kid's a natural-born sissy. Good news from the National Hockey League: They like the movie.

 In “Breakfast With Scot,” an effeminate 11-year-old boy who loves boas, beads and Broadway musicals is taken in by a semi-closeted gay male couple, Eric (Tom Cavanagh) and Sam (Ben Shenkman), after his mother dies of a drug overdose. That mother was the common-law wife of Sam’s wastrel brother, Billy, who has left for Brazil promising to return and leaving the boy, Scot (Noah Bernett), in the custody of child services.  Because Eric is a former hockey star turned sportscaster, the presence in his home of an auburn-haired girlie-boy with a flouncing gait and a fondness for Christmas carols threatens his masculine self-image, not to mention his reputation as a macho sports hero.  For its courage to address a ticklish subject with warmhearted humor, “Breakfast With Scot,” adapted from a novel by Michael Downing, deserves a light round of applause. In the novel the couple are a chiropractor and an editor at an Italian art magazine in Cambridge, Mass. The movie, directed by Laurie Lynd from a screenplay by Sean Reycraft, changes their occupations and moves the story to Toronto (Eric’s former team is the Maple Leafs).  “Breakfast With Scot” is really an extended sitcom in the “Will and Grace” mode. Eric and Sam, a sports lawyer, might as well be straight roommates for all the affection they display, even when alone. The impulsive little peck that Eric dares to plant on Sam’s lips at a party late in the movie comes across more as an expression of terror than as a sign of his imminent liberation from internalized homophobia.  What makes Eric’s situation more confusing is that his colleagues in broadcasting all know he is gay. Eric even admits that during his years as a professional player he was nicknamed Erica. Yet elsewhere the charade of ignorance and denial continues for as long as he encourages it.  Mr. Cavanagh gives a convincing performance as a frightened man trying to be cool by tolerating behavior that raises his hackles. He doesn’t begin to bond with Scot until he discovers that the boy can skate. At last he can both play surrogate father and demonstrate traditional manhood by channeling the boy’s twirling and dipping figure-skating talent toward hockey.  Sam observes Eric’s inner drama with a raised eyebrow. But beyond being the common-sensical domestic partner, Mr. Shenkman’s thankless role is that of the supportive spouse, a male Myrna Loy pouring oil on troubled waters.  The bulk of the movie’s heavy lifting falls to Mr. Bernett, an endearing young actor who imbues Scot with a cheeky I-am-what-I-am attitude toward his temporary surrogate parents and his persecuting peers. He knows that Eric and Sam are gay but doesn’t really know what gay means. Whether Scot is homosexual beneath his mannerisms is left open to question.  Sam believes Scot’s fondness for dressing up in his mother’s clothes and jewels and donning make-up is an unconscious expression of his grief and loneliness, a way of staying by her side. It is the most original notion in a small, good-hearted movie that wouldn’t hurt a fly.  “Breakfast With Scot” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Suffused with the bargain-basement blandness of an Afterschool Special, "Breakfast with Scot" is the kind of gay-themed pic that won't ruffle the feathers of a granny in Manitoba, though it's bound to make more discerning auds groan. Weaving professional hockey into the story of a painfully "normal" (i.e., straight-acting) gay couple forced to look after an effeminate 11-year-old, helmer Laurie Lynd determinedly eliminates any edge, while Sean Reycraft's stale script adds to a "Breakfast" not worth the calories.
Pic caused a stir pre-release back in the fall when the National Hockey League and the Toronto Maple Leafs granted use of their names and logos, creating a ruckus among antigay activists who accused the organizations of "promoting homosexualization of small children." While the NHL's stance deserves praise, it's a shame the vehicle for their amenability is so weak.
When an injury forces professional hockey player Eric (Tom Cavanagh) off the Maple Leafs, he turns to sportscasting, continuing to hide his homosexuality from most co-workers. His equally colorless partner Sam (Ben Shenkman) learns that irresponsible brother Billy (Colin Cunningham) has been made guardian of an orphan, but the kid is in social-services limbo until Billy can be coaxed back to Toronto from Brazil. In the meantime, Sam convinces the reluctant Eric to welcome Scot (Noah Bernett) into their home.
Much to Eric's embarrassment, Scot dresses in girlish clothes, favors jewelry and makeup, and loves musicals: in other words, the polar opposite of Eric and Sam's version of "gay." Naturally there's friction, but bonding begins when Scot agrees to join the school hockey team, more as a way of getting closer to neighbor Ryan (Dylan Everett) than for any affinity to the sport. By the time Billy arrives at Christmas, no one is ready for Scot to leave.
There's zero chemistry between Cavanagh and Shenkman, whose outward displays of affection are limited to one extremely chaste kiss -- nothing to trouble, let alone shock, the most macho of hockey fans. Is reducing a gay couple to the wettest of personalities the way to counter homophobia? Even more embarrassing is the half-hearted sissifying of Scot: throwing a feather boa on Bernett and making him unconvincingly spout convoluted lines hardly makes him convincingly swish.
Visuals mimic a drab suburban dullness -- Lynd showed more flair in some of his award-winning shorts -- and topping it all with a feel-good family values Christmas adds additional tons of processed sugar onto the already overly sweet filling. Music, including disco themes, increases the sense that the pic was shot sometime in late 1970s, with a concomitant degree of unsophistication.

Like a diva in training, 11-year-old Scot (Noah Bernett ), spells his name with one "t," wears a feather boa, and isn't shy about kissing boys at school. None of this amuses his uptight new guardian, Eric (Tom Cavanagh ), a professional hockey player turned sportscaster who's gay but in the closet—despite having lived for years with a lawyer named Sam (Ben Shenkman )—and is the only relative who can take in the newly orphaned Scot. In this often quite funny adaptation of Michael Downing 's 1999 novel, screenwriter Sean Reycraft  and director Laurie Lynd  move the action from Massachusetts to Canada, and accentuate Eric's machismo, which gives his discomfort over Scot's tendency to wear belts with puppy decals an added edge. Cavanagh, best known for the TV show Ed , is terrific—as is young Bernett, who steals the show without hogging it. The odd man out is Shenkman, whose character never gets a bonding scene of his own, and instead is made to stand dutifully by as his partner corners the kid's love, even during the big let's-be-a-family finalé. Ignoring one half of the parental unit is a disconcerting misstep in an otherwise sharp little movie.
