It�s back to the future for Richard Linklater in his animated film version of Philip K. Dick�s 1977 acclaimed novel, A Scanner Darkly
, a near-30-year-old work of prescient science fiction, whose film setting is seven years in the future. In other words, events in the film are happening in the great big now, similar to the way they occurred in the past, will unfold in the future, and always will be as long as there are governments, and citizens, and drugs that fuel the paranoaic fears intrinsic to all sides of the equation. The look of the film expands on the technique of interpolated rotoscoping from live-action video that Linklater and company used to animate his film Waking Life
. (For more on the labor-intensive animation process, which was conducted right here in Austin, see austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2006-07-07/screens_feature.html

.) Animating the film proves to be a terrific strategy, as it enhances the story�s mood of squinty surveillance and ubiquitous uncertainty. Nothing can be trusted to appear as it is, no one can be trusted to be who he or she claims. The film�s central figure, Bob Arctor (Reeves), is a drug dealer who also takes huge quantities of Substance D � a lethally addictive drug about which it�s said, �You�re either on it or haven�t tried it.� Bob is also one of the manifestations of Fred, the government agent who is assigned to spy on Bob and his friends. Bob is essentially conducting surveillance on himself. To what extent he�s even aware of his deeply divided identity is uncertain. Then there�s also his (amusingly cast) Substance D-using roommates Jim Barris (Downey Jr.) and Ernie Luckman (Harrelson); another longtime user and bug-haunted pal Charles Freck (Cochrane); and Bob�s sometimes girlfriend Donna Hawthorne (Ryder), who is also suspected of dealing. The plot becomes very dense and confusing as the overall paranoia mounts, and there�s no clarity as to who�s spying on whom or what�s real and what�s drug-induced. In this regard, the movie, like Dick�s book, is one of the best depictions ever offered of the drug-addled state. However, its accuracy doesn�t fully compensate for the viewers� experience of confusion while watching the film (although a second viewing, which, granted, shouldn�t be necessary, does sharpen comprehension). The constant patter of these characters is amusing and provides lots of flavor (at times, it�s almost as if these chattering creatures have crept in from Linklater�s Slacker
 rather than this cutting-edge science-fiction work), but as a whole, the film has too little character and/or plot development to sustain narrative interest. What A Scanner Darkly
 excels at is mood and tone, and Dick�s mixed-up story about there being no difference between cops and criminals in a world of pervasive surveillance is as cautionary a tale today and tomorrow as it was 30 years ago. Terrifically good performances are turned in by the cast, especially by Downey Jr., who owns the screen in every one of his scenes, and a suitably trippy music score by Austin�s Graham Reynolds also supplements the film�s tone. As the title implies, there�s a certain opacity to A Scanner Darkly
, but at times it can be as naked as the lunch on the end of your fork.


``A Scanner Darkly" is the latest movie to be adapted from a novel by the late science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick , whose previous books have become ``Blade Runner," ``Minority Report," and ``Total Recall." Hollywood tends to turn Dick's work upside down and drain the dread out, then slap a macho matinee idol on the poster and call it a day. Not this time.
The star of ``Scanner" is the decidedly soft-focus Keanu Reeves , and the director is Richard Linklater , the Austin-based maverick who gave us ``Dazed and Confused," the ``Before Sunrise"/``Before Sunset" duo, and, in a brief mainstream fit, ``School of Rock." The novel, too, is Dick's most personal, a barely disguised sci-fi parable of his own troubles with drug addiction. (The novel came out in 1977 ; the author died of heart failure in 1982. )
So what we have here is a junkie movie with a generous dose of future shock. The closest antecedent is David Cronenberg's underrated 1991 adaptation of William S. Burrough's ``Naked Lunch," and like that film ``Scanner" finds squishy metaphors for addiction everywhere it turns.
Set ``seven years from now," ``A Scanner Darkly" follows the rapidly crumbling life of one Bob Arctor (Reeves), a California layabout who appears to do nothing but hang out with his loser buddies and pop regular hits of Substance D, a narcotic to which, we're told, 20 percent of the US population is addicted.
In reality -- or what passes for reality in the movie -- Arctor is a narc who works for a faceless government bureaucracy, regularly reporting to a nondescript office building to drop the dime on his housemates, Barris (Robert Downey Jr. ) and Luckman (Woody Harrelson ). Since the secrecy of his identity is paramount, Arctor must don a ``scramble suit" that randomizes his facial features a thousand times a second: It's like one of those old mix-and-match children's books gone nuclear.
Code-named ``Fred," he takes orders from ``Hank," who informs him that the most suspicious character in the house is this Bob Arctor fellow and they had best set up a full-scanner surveillance system immediately. This means that Arctor is now charged with narcing on himself, which might be manageable if his own increasing reliance on Substance D wasn't doing a number on his frontal lobes. (It also wreaks havoc with his attempts to romance Winona Ryder's Donna , a possible dealer and the only thing in his world that hasn't been strip-malled, overdeveloped, or ground down.)
PHILIP K. DICK PHOTO GALLERY 
Oh, wait, I forgot to mention something: The entire movie is animated. Rotoscoped, actually -- a process in which footage of live actors is drawn over so that it resembles a quasi-realistic cartoon. Linklater has used this technique before, in his wild and woolly 2001 head trip ``Waking Life, " but here he yokes it to a story line and an A-list cast, with spooky if not always convincing results.
The effect is painterly. Characters' hair becomes fluid strips of highlights, their jaws outlined with crisp black strokes. Features seem to float atop faces. At times, the interplay of tones and hues and shades mesmerizes you right out of the movie, and given the preponderance of stoner monologues, you welcome the diversion. Linklater and his effects crew turn the film into a brooding comic book, naughty thought balloons, human-size insects, and all. It helps that some of the actors -- Downey as a manipulative chatterbox, Harrelson as a big, drugged-out sheepdog -- are cartoons already.
Would ``A Scanner Darkly" be as interesting if it were shot normally? Probably not, but that's beside the point; the visual surrealism matches the characters' free-floating anxiety. This is a movie about losing one's grip -- about the practical part of your brain watching the irresponsible part grab control of the helm and take the ship straight to the bottom -- and like any addict's story, it's boring, ugly, sad, and terribly human.
And surprisingly funny. Dick captured the slaphappy companionability of the user's life as well as the loneliness, and Linklater, sticking closely to the novel, gets it too. There's a loopy Lewis Carroll logic to the banter here -- an 18-speed bicycle that's suddenly 11 speeds because the guys are doing the math wrong, or Barris's snare for the cops that consists of leaving the front door open and a note saying ``Come on in." As junkie comedy goes, this is pretty good, and Harrelson and (especially) Downey play it like a wacked-out Abbott and Costello.
Reeves plays it straight, as a man desperately trying to hold it together would; it's a quiet, smart performance, and possibly his most animated (sorry, I just had to). Eventually, Bob Arctor's narrowing world constricts to a single point, and the semblance of a plot kicks back in. There's conspiracy here, as there is in all of Dick's books, and it wraps the film up with a moving but somewhat neat bowtie.
The actual finale -- and Linklater makes sure it's the last thing we see -- is the list of the author's real-life friends who fell to drugs, a list that included himself. Moralize if you want, but Dick knew about human frailty and wrote about it with pitiless clarity. ``A Scanner Darkly" quite literally draws the same conclusions he did.


Richard Linklater's trippy and sinister bad-vibe whatchamacallit A Scanner Darkly  might be described as an animated movie, only the animation consists of live-action footage that's been painstakingly drawn over, a method known as ''interpolated rotoscoping.'' The actors, such as Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, look more or less like themselves, and so do the settings (scuzzy stoner living rooms,  fluorescent surveillance offices), but every surface, every face, has been heightened with pastel blotches that melt and shift like liquid shadow; the effect is akin to paint-by-numbers stained glass that moves.
This is the technique Linklater employed in his 2001 dream fantasia Waking Life , and using it, for the first time, in a narrative feature, the director proves, at least technically, a canny mainstream experimentalist. A Scanner Darkly  has a sensuous heat-scan surface; you feel you could almost read the blood pulse in those faces. Yet that's more or less all there is to do at the movie, since once you get past the images you realize that what's beneath the rotoscoping is a bleary-eyed talkfest of psychotic sci-fi gloom.
In a vaguely fascist suburban dystopia, a fellow (Rory Cochrane) with bugs crawling all over him tries to wash them off, only he can't, since they're a hallucination brought on by Substance D, a drug as perilously destructive as meth. Robert Downey Jr., as a yammering dealer of the stuff, talks sinister fey circles around himself, and Keanu Reeves, as an undercover cop, gets hooked on Substance D. Ordered to spy on (or ''scan'') himself, he finds his sanity in splinters, as the two hemispheres of his brain begin to compete with each other.
Are you with me? Neither am I. A Scanner Darkly  has a few wondrous conceits, like Reeves' disguise  a blurry suit that's a collage of morphing identities. It's surely a metaphor of some sort, but I confess I could barely make heads or tails out of anything in A Scanner Darkly . Linklater, adapting Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel, has stayed true to its paranoid conundrums, adding a shaggy counterculture indolence all his own. We stare at the actors as they sit in decaying rooms, yapping in a stoned torpor, and the film keeps introducing motifs  Reeves at the surveillance monitor, sex with a girl who shifts identity  that go nowhere. It's as if the controlling forces at work were destined to remain oblique and out of reach. Some would say that's the essence of the Dick universe. Yet this celebrated writer may be more fun to think about than he is to experience.
Dick, who may have struggled with schizophrenia, wove his mental torment into a vision of a government that tampers with minds and souls, and there's a glum stupefaction to his whole are-we-android-or-human?, my-brain-is-eating-me! circularity, which isn't that far removed from what certain homeless people gibber about on the sidewalk. In A Scanner Darkly , we're watching other people freak out, but the film is maddening to sit through because their freak-outs never become ours.

 Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of "A Scanner Darkly," a look at a future that looks an awful lot like today. Based on a 1977 novel by the science fiction visionary Philip K. Dick, the semispeculative story involves a cop (call him Officer Fred) who, by assuming an undercover identity (call him Bob Arctor), is inching his way up toward a big drug bust, score by score. But there's a little problem: Fred is starting to forget he's Bob, or maybe vice versa.  Given that Fred/Bob has been regularly dropping Substance D, as in Death, tab by tab, it's no wonder he's feeling a bit off; no wonder, too, given that this is the world Philip K. Dick made. Like the writer's other worlds, that of "A Scanner Darkly" is one in which drugs predominate and reality tends to be a big question mark, hovering like an electro-colored thought bubble above characters who are more everyday normal than super-this or  -that. Ordinary guys who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances like Fred/Bob, who in Mr. Linklater's film has been given seductive voice and corporeal outline by Keanu Reeves, an actor whose penchant for otherworldly types and excellent adventures make him well suited for vision quests like this one.  Mr. Dick wrote "A Scanner Darkly" after several years of firsthand experience with what he called the street scene in the early 1970's. By 1971 he was ingesting  a whopping  1,000 hits of speed a week, along with plentiful daily doses of tranquilizers. "The happiness pills," he admitted around that time, "are turning out to be nightmare pills." He entered a rehabilitation center shortly thereafter and in 1972, in a letter to a drug treatment center in Southern California, even offered his services as a counselor, having had, as he wrote, "five friends kill themselves on or as a result of acid trips  — and seen many fine brains burned out on narcotics." The novel "A Scanner Darkly," which drew on his memories of that time, followed.  As in the book, the film finds Bob Arctor pursuing his drug-and-love connection, Donna (voiced by Winona Ryder), while Fred puts in time in front of a bank of video monitors, watching surveillance images  of himself as   Bob Arctor and   his housemates, the prankster Barris (Robert Downey Jr.) and the joker Luckman (Woody Harrelson), vegetating amid their collective chaos and broken-down furniture. To protect his undercover identity, Fred often wears a "scramble suit," which turns him into a "vague blur" not unlike all the other vague blurs to whom he delivers antidrug speeches at the local  Lions and Elks clubs. Not unlike the vague blur that Fred was once upon a married time, before he conked his head and, as Bob, started to turn on, tune in and drop out.  On its most basic level, the novel serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of drug abuse and indeed closes with a poignant roll call of Philip K. Dick's friends who had been lost, "punished"  — as he wrote  — "entirely too much for what they did." That said, to reduce the novel to a "just say no" diatribe would be to greatly miss one of its and its author's sustaining points. Drugs are generally a bad idea in "A Scanner Darkly," in the book and film both, though in the novel it's the real world or what we perceive the real world to be that makes for the more obviously bad trip, not scary little  pills. "So-called 'reality,' "  as Mr. Dick once said, "is a mass delusion that we've all been required to believe for reasons totally obscure."  Mr. Dick searched long and hard for those reasons, as both his frenetic work output (more than 40 novels, zillions of stories) and recreational drug use suggest. In 1980, two years before he died at 53 from a series of strokes, he described himself as  an " 'acosmic panenthiest,' which means that I don't believe that the universe exists. I believe that the only thing that exists is God and he is more than the universe. The universe is an extension of God into space and time." Whether he was having some fun with his interviewers matters little; he had found a reasonable way to puzzle over those ballooning question marks that didn't require him to stay awake for days at a time with eyes and brain bugged and bugging.  As he did in an earlier film, "Waking Life," Mr. Linklater uses the animation technique called rotoscoping to translate Mr. Dick's worldview, mostly to fine expressive effect. With this technique, a version of which was used by early giants like Max Fleischer and even in the old Disney factory, animators directly trace over live-action images of performers. (What was once achieved through ink and paint is now accomplished through software.) The results tend to look fluid, almost as if the bodies were floating above the background visuals —  an effect that appears to have been pushed in "A Scanner Darkly," where the bodies can appear almost liquid, as if the characters had been recently poured and had yet to harden into final shape.  Rotoscoping makes certain sense for a film about cognitive dissonance and alternative realities, though both the vocal and gestural performances by Mr. Reeves, Mr. Harrelson and, in particular, the wonderful Mr. Downey make me wish that we were watching them in live action. "A Scanner Darkly" has a kind of hypnotic visual appeal, and there's something very appropriate in how a chair in Bob Arctor's kitchen appears to hover above the floor, replicating the kind of time-space visual dislocations that can be produced through the consumption of hallucinogens. Even so, considering that the animation is not transcendently  beautiful and that Mr. Downey has been pretty much out of commission lately, in part because of his own drug troubles, it would have been nice to see real shadows crossing his face.  "A Scanner Darkly" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has drug use, adult language and animated bare breasts.
"What does a scanner see?" a character muses toward the end of "A Scanner Darkly." Whatever the answer is, audiences may find there's less than meets the eye in Richard Linklater's deeply intriguing but almost too-faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's nightmarish 1977 novel about government surveillance, fractured identity and dope-fueled paranoia. Shot in live-action and animated via the same interpolated-rotoscoping techniques applied to the director's 2001 fantasia "Waking Life" -- albeit to markedly different aesthetic effect -- pic feels almost self-consciously geared toward cult status. Mainstream viewers will likely prefer their head-trips less talky and more self-administered.
Premiering in Un Certain Regard before its July 7 opening (the complex rotoscoping process delayed the pic from an original September 2005 release), "A Scanner Darkly" has in common with Linklater's other Cannes entry, "Fast Food Nation," the feeling of a valiant missed opportunity.
Though it shares some obvious chromosomes with "Waking Life," "Scanner's" dystopian tale is light years removed in temperament from the earlier film, whose delirious verbiage and constantly mutating palette radiated a sense of boundless optimism and possibility.
Dick's cynical universe proves much more hermetic, leaving surprisingly little room for the kinds of surrealist touches and visual fillips one would expect. Plot point by plot point, the film seems more concerned with achieving a lucid retelling of the novel's events, resulting in an almost disappointingly well-behaved sci-fi noir that's mildly provocative rather than visionary.
Set in an Orange County suburb in the near future, the pic kicks off with one of its most eye-popping sequences, as seriously messed-up junkie Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane) tries in vain to get rid of the bugs that may or may not be crawling over his body.
Freck isn't the only one strung out on the mysterious drug known as Substance D (so named for causing "dumbness, despair, desertion and death"). Robert Arctor (Keanu Reeves, plugged into yet another matrix), owner of the Anaheim tract home where hangers-on Freck, Jim Barris (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson) have taken up residence, works as an undercover narcotics agent -- one whose infiltration of the drug world has turned him into an addict.
The secretive nature of Arctor's profession serves as the catalyst for the fiendishly complex network of relationships, hidden identities and double-crosses that eventually come to the fore. Arctor is romancing drug dealer Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder), hoping to learn her supplier's identity; meanwhile, at work, he's ordered to run surveillance on his own home, as one of the four (guess who) is suspected of being Donna's top customer.
Labyrinth of deceit only deepens when Barris, a flippant opportunist played to the hilt by Downey Jr., turns informant against Arctor. Barris is unaware, of course, that he's feeding this information to none other than a disguised Arctor himself.
As Arctor's incessant pill-popping and juggling of dual lives rapidly facilitate his psychic breakdown, Linklater's screenplay unspools at a fleet rhythm that keeps total comprehension just out of reach. To judge by the surprising number of walkouts during the pic's Cannes press screening, the material may still be too densely convoluted for all but the most attentive.
Though it gets around to addressing all of Dick's pessimistic ideas concerning the cyclical nature of addiction and the erosion of individual privacy, the pic arguably misses the boat by not linking its themes more explicitly to the political realities of the present, particularly when issues of unlawful surveillance have rarely been more relevant. Technological advances aside, this feels very much like a film that could have been made in 1977.
While it doesn't manage the unity of form and content that "Waking Life" did, rotoscoping (which took a painstaking 15 months) allows for the dazzling realization of set-pieces that live-action could not accommodate. Among the highlights are a Kafka-esque hallucination and Arctor's "scramble suit," an amorphous hologrammed outfit he wears to keep others from recognizing him.
Less successfully, the animation layer has a slightly flattening effect on the actors' faces, leaching them of some depth. Graham Reynolds' music is eerily evocative without quickening the pulse.

Stoned babble and decomposing reality, A Scanner Darkly Richard Linklater 's animated version of the 1977 novel by Philip K. Dick is the most literal of Dick adaptations and also, in a perverse way, the most literary.
Dick, as tactfully pointed out by his Polish colleague Stanislaw Lem , was less a writer than a man cursed with prophetic sight who "does not so much play the part of a guide through his phantasmagoric worlds as he gives the impression of one lost in their labyrinth." What's extraordinary about Linklater's animation, computer-rotoscoped in the fashion of his 2001 Waking Life , is just how tangible the Dickian labyrinth becomes.
Linklater renders coherent Dick's amorphous account of SoCal dopers addicted to the brain-destroying Substance D, the narcs who police them, and the shadowy corporation stage-managing the seedy drama. This straightforward version of Dick's anguished vision of drug-addled addiction makes Naked Lunch  seem positively romantic. (Indeed, Linklateror is it Dick?even seems to be specifically mocking the "blue flower of romanticism.") The skin-crawling opener has D-generate Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane ) frantically fending off a plague of nonexistent aphids erupting out of his scalp; like the book, the movie ends with Dick's dedication to his drug-casualty friends.
Animation allows Linklater to efface the distinction between hallucination and "reality," as well as unmediated reality and video surveillance. Everything has the same somber palette and heavy outlines. Faces disintegrate into paint-by-numbers light patterns; interior planes shift and slide. The nominal hero, an undercover cop posing as one Bob Arctor  (Keanu Reeves ), is introduced addressing a businessmen's lunch from the safety of an identity-blurring "scramble suit." This shape-shifting outfit is made for animation and it's also the movie's ruling metaphor. Midspeech, the copwho has, of course, been dabbling in the brain-fissuring Dsnaps into his other personality.
Dick's novel may be a morass of unplayable dialogue, but Linklater, who has been orchestrating spaced-out riffs since Slacker , has a connoisseur's appreciation for druggy logic and crackpot conspiracy. At least half the movie involves Arctor rapping with his pals, motor-mouthed Barris (Robert Downey Jr.)  and hysterical Luckman (Woody Harrelson ), as well as their dealer Donna (Winona Ryder ), whose source he is trying to ascertain. Most scenes are set in Arctor's living room and the movie is characterized by superbly putrid crash pad mise-en-scénecigarette butts and dirty dishes on every surface, hand-scrawled signs ("Time to Thaw Walt Out," "Just Keep Keeping On") on the wall, an American flag stapled to the ceiling.
As an exercise in brain-fried absurdism, A Scanner Darkly  is far darker than Dazed and Confused . The psychedelic stooges are perpetually paranoid while Donna, Arctor's nominal girlfriend, is viscerally so. Recoiling from Arctor's touch, she unconvincingly explains: "I have to watch it because I do so much coke." The bizarrely conceited Barris, his mind in perpetual overdrive and ears ringing with "news from the guinea-pig grapevine," has the best theorieseven as Downey, who, having grasped that he's playing a cartoon character, delivers the most animated performance. (Midway through 2006, this supporting turn is the performance to beat in what seems the year's American movie to beat.)
It's Luckman, however, who has the key bit of jabber, droning on ad nauseam about a celebrated impostor who decided that, rather than impersonating all manner of individuals, it would be far less taxing to simply impersonate a celebrated impostor. This inevitably brings up the subject of cops disguised as dopers and leads Arctor, through a stoned non sequitur, to ponder his own fissured situation: "Shit, I'm spacedposing as a narc, wow!" Dick's idea of a tragic modernist paradigm, Arctor is the character who suffers most acutely the loss of identity. (His name, realistically enough, sounds like "actor" on quaaludes.)
Once the D kicks in, Arctor is both beset by false memories and pathetically unaware of his current situation. He lives his junkie life and then goes to work to watch himself living it (hence the title), dutifully informing on his vegetative friendsat least one of whom is reporting on him to him. Arctor briefs his superior, each wearing a protective scramble suit; he's only himself when submitting to the required psychological tests that, indicating cross-chatter between his brain's two hemispheres, suggest he has no "self" at all.
After he no longer seems to realize that he is Arctor, nothing remains beyond a sad spiral through bogus rehab and meaningless group therapy. "Living and nonliving things are exchanging places," someone, possibly the bugged-out Freck, explains. Speaking of the group: People will complain that A Scanner Darkly is hard to follow. True, there's no use dropping bread crumbs in this maze. Just remember that everything in this grimly amusing world is its oppositeexcept, that is, when it's not.
