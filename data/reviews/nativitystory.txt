Hollywood does love an epic. Try this on for size: A teenage girl learns she�s giving birth to the son of God; a king so fears the coming of God incarnate that he orders the slaughter of newborn babies; and a trio of astrologers travels more than 1,000 miles to see the realization of centuries-old prophecies. Yes, it�s the story of the birth of Jesus. And religious affiliations aside, the setup has potential for some badass epic filmmaking. Sadly, the tale is presented with a yawn-inducing neutrality more reminiscent of a community-center Christmas pageant than an epic story of divine humanity. Best known as director of troubled-teen movies, Hardwicke (Thirteen
, Lords of Dogtown)
 paints her picture from the perspective of young Mary (Castle-Hughes) and her new husband, Joseph (Isaac). The film follows the teenage bride from the time an angel appears with news of her fate through the couple�s journey to Bethlehem and, ultimately, to Jesus� birth. In the interim, Mary must explain to her parents and new husband that an angel of God visited her, that she has remained true to her promise of chastity, and that she�s not completely insane. Unfortunately, Castle-Hughes gives such a stone-faced performance, it�s difficult to experience the humanity of the person. Despite her charming breakout in Whale Rider
, Castle-Hughes� restrained Mary becomes an ethereal stoic instead of a frightened teenager approaching an unfathomable challenge with growing faith. Isaac is endearing as the selfless Joseph, but his noble character is so beyond reproach that he seems completely unreal. Furthermore, where�s the fear and the nail-biting? What about the utter astonishment and disbelief? In effect, where�s the messiness? Enter King Herod (Hinds) who snarls through his scenes like a first-century Hitler. Every appearance of the curly-haired menace is accompanied by pounding drums but no exploration into his motivation. Amusing liberties are taken with the three wise men: oddly placed comic relief presented as bickering codgers. Meanwhile, a few moments of intimacy between Joseph and Mary resonate as powerful. But in the end I was just plain bored. The story is good, but the execution favors the safe over the challenging. Personally, I�d rather just read the Bible.


"The Nativity Story" is the first major Christian-themed film since "The Passion of the Christ" commercially revived the genre two years ago. It's also from the director of the 2003 lock-up-your-rampaging-daughters melodrama "Thirteen." One thus approaches this new telling of Jesus' birth with trepidation, especially given the news that its 16-year-old star has since gotten pregnant (by her boyfriend, not God). Is this the story of Mother Mary, Riot Grrrl?
Hardly. The devoted can breathe a sigh of relief and bring the kids; the curious will find a handsome, disarmingly tender visualization of the original Christmas that relies more on faith than on filmmaking inspiration. If "Passion" was the Gospel According to Mel, "The Nativity Story" is strictly by the Book.
As such, your engagement with the movie will depend on your own level of belief; at the very least, it's refreshing to see a holiday film that doesn't involve Tim Allen wearing 80 pounds of rubber padding. Earnest, stilted, rapturous, "Nativity Story" takes advantage of the new biblical realism pioneered by "Passion" -- Mary is appropriately adolescent, the setting appropriately harsh -- while keeping one foot in the cliches of the old Hollywood epics. It's "The Song of Bernadette" for the iPod generation.
As played by Keisha Castle-Hughes ("Whale Rider"), Mary of Nazareth is just one of the teenage girls and boys helping their parents dig out a hardscrabble existence in the stony landscape; more somber than most, she ducks the ardent glances of Joseph (Oscar Isaac) even after her father (Shaun Toub) betroths her to the young man.
Over in Jerusalem, King Herod (the fine Irish actor Ciar�n Hinds, making with the crazy eyes and generally behaving as if he were in a Cecil B. DeMille silent) wants to nullify the prophecy of a coming Messiah for all mankind; he bides his time while his soldiers bleed the poor to pay for the king's gold-tiled waterfalls. And in far-off Persia, three wise men named Balthasar (Eriq Ebouaney), Melchior (Nadim Sawalha), and Gaspar (Stefan Kalipha) fiddle with their astrolabes and, predicting the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, saddle up their camels.
These are sideshows; the Magi come off as a sort of sandy, agreeable Manny, Moe, and Jack. "Nativity Story" focuses mostly on the drama of a young woman who has been told by the Angel Gabriel (played by Alexander Siddig when not being played by a hawk) that she's bearing the Son of God.
Castle-Hughes gives an initially passive performance that broadens and deepens as Mary acquires a sense of divine mission and a will of her own -- among other things, the movie's about a girl growing away from her small-minded community while facing her own doubts. "Why is it me God has asked? I am nothing," Mary says before coming to understand that's exactly why.
It helps that her husband's a mensch. Even before Gabriel appears to Joseph, this sensitive spouse -- Matthew's "just man" -- is inclined to trust his new wife's claims of godly impregnation. When the couple makes the 90-mile trek to Bethlehem (the Emperor Augustus's census requires Joseph to return to the village of his birth), the ordeal is shared by the two in body and spirit, the couple worrying about their unborn child like any expectant parents.
Here's where director Catherine Hardwicke does try for something new: "Nativity Story" understands that the larger miracle is that of reproduction and birth -- not just that Jesus is born, but that any child is born. Mary is the film's heroine and so are all women, including her mother, Anna (the great Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass), and her aunt Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo). In a real sense, " Nativity Story" is the female other to Gibson's "Passion": Dedicated to life rather than death, it's suffused with a sense of the womanly divine.
The filmmaking feels increasingly hemmed in, though, perhaps by a fear of giving offense to the touchy evangelical audience. "Nativity Story" rolls forward with Classics Illustrated fidelity and never strays far from the Gospels, and after a while it becomes more pageantry than cinema. (Or maybe it's just that Gabriel's summons to the shepherds of Bethlehem reminded me of Linus giving the Bible reading in "A Charlie Brown Christmas.")
Elliot Davis's cinematography is picture-postcard gorgeous; Mychael Danna's score is reasonably subtle when it's not weaving in Christmas carols. The movie's going to make a bundle because it doesn't challenge anything, and certainly the moviegoers who will be most moved by it don't want it to. They want splendidly produced orthodoxy.
Good moviemaking challenges by its very nature, of course, and that's beside the point here. By the time Mary and Joseph reach the manger -- a small cave, really -- and the Christmas star beams in through the hole above, "Nativity Story" has officially turned into a creche.


         As Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" powerfully demonstrated, lots of people are willing to spend serious money to see films with Christian subject matter. "The Nativity Story" is attempting to tap into that market by Leaving to Mel the Things That Are Mel's and concentrating on the uplifting beginning of Jesus' life rather than the violent close.
 
  Unfortunately for potential viewers, the trailer for "The Nativity Story" has gotten this film's nature exactly wrong. This is not a chance to "experience the most timeless of stories as you've never seen it before" but just the opposite: an opportunity, for those who want it, to encounter this story exactly the way it's almost always been told.
 


         






    For though one of the film's producers has said that Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct "because she cuts across the grain of the picture-book version of the movie that could have been made," that's just what the filmmaker and her team have come up with.
 
  Hardwicke, whose work includes the fake-transgressive "Thirteen" and "Lords of Dogtown," has made a super-earnest Classics Illustrated version of the Nativity story, a cinematic Bible class that flatters the chosen but has little to offer anyone who is not already a believer.
 
  This is a pity for several reasons, not the least of which is that, as Pier Paolo Pasolini's "The Gospel According to St. Matthew" beautifully demonstrated, truly transcendent films can be made from the story of Jesus' life.
 
  It's also regrettable because "The Nativity Story" wastes the strong performance of 16-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary. An actress who projects perfect naturalness, Castle-Hughes shows that her Oscar-nominated work in "Whale Rider" was not a fluke by serving as the film's calm center.
 
  Perhaps Castle-Hughes' most difficult challenge is making the best of Mike Rich's painfully sincere dialogue, lines like "Why is it me God has asked? I am nothing."
 
  This script was apparently a labor of love for Rich, who has done similar work for "The Rookie" and (uncredited) on "Miracle." But his type of gee-wilikers writing does not combine well with Hardwicke's less innocent, more conniving sensibility and results in situations that will make viewers wince.
 
  Having an even harder time than Castle-Hughes is the normally excellent British actor Ciarán Hinds ("Munich," "Persuasion"), who is stuck with an oily manner to go with his oily hair and beard as the perfidious Herod, king of Judea. This is one worried monarch, never smiling and obsessively asking anyone he meets, "And what of the prophecy, the awaited Messiah?"
 
  Meanwhile, back in Nazareth, young Mary is being a typical teenager, flirting in the fields with cute guys and pitching in around the house. She is hardly prepared for being told by her parents that she is betrothed to the slightly older Joseph (Oscar Isaac), and, in true "Thirteen" fashion, she gets a little pouty about it.
 
  Things change radically, however, when the Archangel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) arrives and tells Mary what is in store for her. She visits her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo), and when she returns visibly pregnant, she gets to play the ultimate misunderstood teen, telling her parents and her fiancé, "I have broken no vow, I have told the truth."
 
  While this is happening in earnest, "The Nativity Story" periodically checks in on the three wise men, who whine and bicker and are in general played as much for comic relief as anything else. One of them is fond of saying, "If I am right, and I usually am," and threatens not to go to visit the newborn Jesus because he can't move a muscle without his dates and nuts and wine. There's even a line about forgetting the map, but you get the idea.
 
  As Herod glowers and insists "I will end this threat to my rule" and the wise men schlep through picturesque deserts, Joseph and the pregnant Mary return to Joseph's hometown of Bethlehem for a Roman census, bonding with each other over the difficulties of the trip.
 
  And when Jesus is finally born, the star the wise men have been following illuminates the manger like a massive searchlight at a big studio premiere. When Hollywood faces off against religion, you don't even have to ask which force will come out on top.

Back in high school, where I fancied myself a bit of a class clown, I would often subject friends to jokes that relied on my hi -larious Funny Accent. It wasn't French, it wasn't Italian, it wasn't Yiddish or Bulgarian or Swahili  it was some ungodly mixture of all of the above, a pidgin foreign sub-Arte Johnson mishmash that a much wittier pal of mine dubbed my ''Esperanto accent.'' That's the way the characters talk in The Nativity Story . They speak in Serious Ancient Movie-ese  a vaguely Middle Eastern, vaguely Borat-ish sound in which the word God  comes out as ''goat,'' gift  is ''geeft,'' dark  is ''dod-k,'' and so forth. The accents are meant to carry a ring of authenticity, but given that the mostly Jewish characters are speaking English, rather than Hebrew or Aramaic, you really do have to wonder what difference it makes that the stiff-backed dialogue is uttered like something you would expect to hear at an international fusion yogurt restaurant.
The accents, like the rest of The Nativity Story , are a come-on, a token of middlebrow highmindedness. They're Bible-movie decor, like the dirty rumpled robes and head scarves, the rocky-road villages. Dear God, it is all so respectable and dull! I went into The Nativity Story , which is drawn from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, as a fan of the director, Catherine Hardwicke, who has made two startlingly close-to-the-bone youth-rebel pictures, the brilliant, lacerating Thirteen  and the '70s skate-punk fantasia Lords of Dogtown . I figured, or hoped, that Hardwicke might apply her antennae for the troubles of teen misfits to the tale of Mary and Joseph, and when we first glimpse the face of Keisha Castle-Hughes, the 16-year-old New Zealand star of Whale Rider  (she's like a tough-nut Jennifer Beals), there is much promise in her olive-skinned, beatific yet sloe-eyed look  the image of an ancient statue that has come to life. In Nazareth, Mary is told that a husband, an eager carpenter named Joseph (Oscar Isaac), has been chosen for her, and her prickly, sullen response feels bold, right. This is the way to draw an audience to a Bible spectacle  to humanize and, yes, modernize Mary, lending her a streak of vibrant stubbornness, the quality she'll need to carry the son of God in her womb.
To our surprise and disappointment, though, Castle-Hughes never finds another shade, another nuance  heck, another facial expression  within that stoic riot grrrl of Judaea resolve. The old Hollywood biblical epics had a kitsch eroticism, with actors like Charlton Heston and Hedy Lamarr turning scripture into a chaste pinup parade. The Nativity Story , as if embarrassed to fall into that trap, reduces its heroine, after a few token rebel gestures, to a saintly cipher. Having learned of her arranged union, Mary, according to the film's press notes, ''takes refuge in an ancient olive grove to collect her thoughts,'' and if ever I wished that press notes were less accurate, it's here: Mary spends the entire movie  collecting her thoughts. In that olive grove, she's visited by the angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig), who looks disarmingly like Cat Stevens as he delivers the prophecy that Mary will give birth to the Messiah, and that her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) is about to become miraculously pregnant as well.
If Scorsese's wrenching, faith-splattered The Last Temptation of Christ  portrayed Jesus' relationship with his divinity as a profound human struggle, then surely Mary, as a mere mortal, a naive and parochial village girl, might greet the knowledge of her holy destiny with confusion, or even a note of distress. But no: Hardwicke and Castle-Hughes make her a coolly blank and passive soul. The movie that results isn't inept, but it's about as dramatic as a wall calendar. When the dastardly egotist King Herod (Ciarán Hinds) orders Mary and Joseph, along with everyone in their region, to return to the place of their birth for a census, the couple, now united, must journey to Bethlehem. And journey they do: on horseback, through deserts and valleys, along beaches. Yet that's all that happens. They ride. It's a trek to test the patience of the faithful, relieved only by the three magi, who are like infomercial astrologers.< /p>
Hollywood now has a paradoxical relationship with evangelical America. The movie industry is eager to beckon and serve Christian viewers, yet as long as it thinks of those viewers as another market slice, a demo, it may end up pandering to them with cautious and stultifying reverence. The Nativity Story  is a film of tame picture-book sincerity, but that's not the same thing as devotion. The movie is too tepid to feel, or see, the light.

 It’s best to think of “The Nativity Story” as a Hollywood version of the kind of Christmas production some of  the “Peanuts” kids put on in “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” This is not meant as a criticism. Quite the contrary.  Directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a script by Mike Rich, “The Nativity Story” sticks to the familiar details of the narrative and dramatizes them with sincerity and good taste. There are no flights of actorly or cinematic bravura — though  all of the performances are credible, and some better than that — and very few big, showy, epic gestures. Rather than trying to reinterpret or modernize a well-known, cherished story, the filmmakers have rendered it with a quiet, unassuming professionalism.  The challenge in producing a movie like this is to find enough conventional movie elements — suspense, realistic characters, convincing dialogue — without selling out the scriptural source. How do you make piety entertaining without seeming impious?  A certain degree of kitsch is inevitable, and perhaps even desirable.  The Bible supplies a ripe villain in the person of Herod, who is impersonated here, with a stagy frown and magnificent hair, by Ciaran Hinds.  The three wise men (Nadim Sawalha, Eriq Ebouaney and Stefan Kalipha) provide some comic relief along with the gold, frankincense and myrrh. They quarrel and kvetch their way across the desert like Hope and Crosby (or Moe, Larry and Curly) on the road to Morocco (which happens to be where much of “The Nativity Story” was filmed).  The movie has been cast with an eye toward authenticity rather than renown, which spares audiences the distraction of seeing familiar movie stars in robes and sandals. Instead  we have an impressive sampling of international actors; they come from Northern Ireland, Guatemala, Cameroon, Iran and even, aptly enough, Nazareth. Their accents sometimes clash — the ancient Israelites have apparently been instructed to sound like modern Israelis when they speak the English dialogue — but this could hardly have been avoided.  Several plots are threaded together, as the film synthesizes the plain, step-by-step storytelling of the Gospels according to modern screenwriting conventions. (It starts with the massacre of the innocents and then flashes back “one year earlier” to the story of  Zechariah and Elizabeth, parents of John the Baptist.) Political events — Herod’s paranoid cruelty and the brutality of the Roman occupation — are juxtaposed with the more intimate story of Mary and her family.    Keisha Castle-Hughes, the 16-year-old New Zealand actress (and the youngest-ever  best-actress Oscar nominee, for “Whale Rider” a few years ago), seems entirely unfazed by the demands of playing Mary. She has the poise and intelligence to play the character not as an icon of maternity, but rather as a headstrong, thoughtful adolescent transformed by an unimaginable responsibility. Mary’s stubbornness and her honesty make her entirely believable, and the film’s most subtle and lively dramatic thread concerns her maturation from an ordinary Nazareth teenager into a wife and expectant mother.  In “Thirteen” and “Lords of Dogtown,” Ms. Hardwicke’s previous films as a director — a role she took up after a long career as a production designer — she   showed an unusual sensitivity to the feelings and motives of young people growing up too fast, and a similar sympathy infuses her understanding of Mary. Without making the character into an anachronism, she and Mr. Rich try to imagine what Mary’s experience must have felt like. The daughter of loving, worried parents (Shaun Toub and Hiam Abbass), she must absorb first the shock of an arranged marriage (to Oscar Isaac’s Joseph) and then the startling attention of the Archangel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig).  One of the vivid memories of my earlier life as a movie-mad college student is of the protesters picketing a theater showing Jean-Luc Godard’s “Hail Mary,” a film whose retelling of the Nativity story was presumed, sight unseen, to be blasphemous. Ms. Hardwicke’s version, aimed at a global mass audience in the Christmas season, steers clear of both  Mr. Godard’s provocations and the confrontational style of Mel Gibson’s “Passion of the Christ.” At its best, though, “The Nativity Story” shares with “Hail Mary” an interest in finding a kernel of realism in the old story of a pregnant teenager in hard times. Buried in the pageantry, in other words, is an interesting movie.  “The Nativity Story” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There is some violence, most of it implied rather than graphically shown.

Memories of dreary Sunday school classes come flooding back courtesy of "The Nativity Story." Earnestly Hallmark-worthy to a fault, this stodgy addition to the cinematic religious revival gravy train offers only a bit of Year One location realism to distinguish it from films of its kind made in the '50s and early '60s, though at least then it might have had the advantage of a score by the likes of Miklos Rozsa, Franz Waxman or Alfred Newman. All the same, New Line should be able to sell this pic effectively to the faithful over the holiday season, and B.O. could be very strong indeed in Catholic territories such as Latin America, where devotion to the Virgin Mary runs high.
Admirers of Catherine Hardwicke will be particularly surprised that the director of "Thirteen" and "Lords of Dogtown" could make something this conventional and unspontaneous. Despite the presence of young, vital actors, the humdrum lines in Mike Rich's script are spoken in a stilted, pan-Mediterranean/Middle Eastern accent and with a stiffness that stifles all vitality and emotion, resulting in a dry run-through of events plausibly extrapolated from the little actually known about the family of Jesus Christ.
Just two of the four gospels, Matthew and Luke, include the story of the nativity, and only the former notes the difficulty Mary's intended husband, Joseph, and others in Nazareth may initially have had accepting the young woman's claim of purity despite her pregnancy. Aside from this, most of the drama stems from the threat posed by King Herod (Ciaran Hinds), who is obsessed with an ancient prophecy concerning the birth of a future Jewish king.
Inspired by Matthew, screenplay foreshadows Mary's immaculate conception with the surprise pregnancy of her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo), a woman past childbearing years. Unfortunately, the promise of this miracle is announced in a vast temple to Elizabeth's husband, Jewish elder Zechariah (Stanley Townsend), in a manner that recalls nothing so much as the wizard speaking to Dorothy & Co. in Oz.
As for Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes), the serious-visaged teenager is none too thrilled to be abruptly thrown into an arranged marriage with the admiring Joseph (Oscar Isaac), who's at least a decade older. But no sooner is Mary told to remain chaste for a year than she is visited by the angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) in an olive grove and informed, "You have found favor with God." There's no question what this means.
Mary goes to Jerusalem for a spell to bond with Elizabeth and figure out how to explain all this to Joseph, who needs a holy visitation of his own to embrace his fate. In due course, Joseph is obliged by the coming Roman census to return to his native Bethlehem, which is so crowded that he and the ready-to-burst Mary are forced to make do in a cave artfully graced with a hole in the top to allow in celestial illumination.
This guiding light proves invaluable to the Three Wise Men, lightly comic figures who spend months making their way from Persia to Judea in order to attend the birth of the promised messiah.
Hardwicke's background as a production designer asserts itself in the vivid, if fleeting, depiction of quotidian life in Nazareth, the maze of one-story stone huts that comprises Bethlehem and the imposing temple of Jerusalem.
Otherwise, however, she evinces no feeling for antiquity, the epic format or the dramatic presentation of epochal events. In addition to the mundane realism, pic sorely needs some visual heightening to exalt its images and characters, to suggest a spiritual dimension.
Instead, the film's banal sensibility is suggested by its dependence upon "startling" transitions, such as cutting away pointlessly to exotic animals or loud sounds, and upon the recurring motif of heavy drum beats to signal the arrival of Roman soldiers.
Castle-Hughes, so effective in "Whale Rider," spends nearly the entire film furrowing her brow to express a mixture of anxiety and determination. Isaac seems ready and eager to combust at any moment but never gets the chance, while Hinds, all uptight paranoia as the Judean monarch, no doubt becomes the first actor to portray both Herod and Julius Caesar in as many seasons.
Visuals have been drained of vibrant colors, which may serve to accommodate the extensive CGI backgrounds but dulls the overall look. Locations are very good; Matera, the ancient southern Italian town used in "The Passion of the Christ," again fills in evocatively as Jerusalem and environs, while Ouarzazate and other Moroccan locales provide diverse topography for the major treks involved.

No, the Virgin Mary  doesn't get high on aerosol fumes, and Joseph doesn't ride in on a skateboard, but in most other respects, The Nativity Story is less of a departure for Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown  director Catherine Hardwicke  than one would have imagined. From our first glimpse of Nazareth  teenagers making goo-goo eyes at one another while going about their chores, Hardwicke wants us to know that she's making her third film in a row about the difficulties of adolescence, whether the time is now or B.C. And when young Mary (Whale Rider 's Keisha Castle-Hughes ) comes to her parents in the first stages of pregnancy, it's clear that underage moms having babies out of wedlock was no more fashionable back then than it is today, even if the father did happen to be The Father. You try convincing Mom and Dad of that.
Little moments like those are Hardwicke's way of making The Nativity Story seem less ossified for a contemporary (read: young) audience than the Hollywood  religious epics of yesteryear, and she tries to put her mark on the material in other ways too. Taking her cue from such post-neorealist Italian directors like Pier Paolo Pasolini  and Ermanno Olmi  (whose Cammina, cammina remains the greatest screen version of the Nativity that I know of), Hardwicke downplays mysticism and spectacle in favor of a more earthy view of how life may have been lived two millennia ago. Even when the archangel Gabriel appears in visions to Mary and Joseph, he seems less like a special effect than, you know, some guy who just happens to be standing there.
Hardwicke's most radical conceit, however, at least for a movie positioned as a red-state holiday perennialthere is already a soundtrack album featuring "Christian & Country artists" performing "Christmas favorites inspired by the film"is that most of the major roles are acted by performers of Algerian, Iranian, Israeli, and Sudanese descent. Castle-Hughes is Maori, of course. The powerful young actor Oscar Isaac , who plays Joseph, is Guatemalan. And one actress, Hiam Abbass  (who plays Mary's mother, Anna), was actually born in Nazareth. In short, their skin is dark, which makes The Nativity Story the first Hollywood religious picture in memory (if not ever) to imply, for most of its running time, that Jesus Christ  probably looked more like Jim Brown  than Jim Caviezel . Until, that is, the newborn Lord makes his cameo appearance at the end, bearing a decidedly milky complexion.
Still, The Nativity Story does only so much to enliven a drama that has been playing out in Sunday schools and on suburban lawns for centuries, and which Monty Python  neatly consigned to the pre-credits sequence of Life of Brian . Hardwicke, who began her career as a production designer, has a wonderful eye for detailpossibly too wonderful, for there are so many shots of Nazareth villagers making artisanal cheeses that the movie may become uncomfortable for the lactose intolerant. Would that she brought the same intimacy to her handling of animate objects. There are a few quietly affecting scenes here, in which we see Mary and Joseph as the terribly frightened newlyweds they probably were, unsure of what to make of their extraordinary circumstances. But too often, the actors register as little more than set dressing and, despite Hardwicke's resolve to give us the real Nativity as we've never seen it before, much of the movie smacks of conventionfrom the three wise men being played for comic effect to the thunderous drumbeats that portend each arrival of the shekel-hungry Roman soldiers to the CGI-darkened skies that precede King Herod 's slaughter of the innocents. Finally, the stars align. A shaft of heavenly light pours down upon the earth. The audience lets out a collective yawn.
