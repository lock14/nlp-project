I've seen a lot of troubled, urban youth learn teamwork, fair play, and self-respect from a hardass sports coach. The coach uses unconventional methods and stands alone against a bureaucratic status quo. Would-be players will quit the hard work, then glower from the sidelines while the rest of the team faces rich, smug opponents from the right side of town. (Think: Coach Carter
 or even Akeelah and the Bee
.) On the page, there's nothing special about this football yarn, based on an eponymous television documentary filmed inside California juvenile detention center Camp Kilpatrick, so audiences can be excused for underestimating it; nor does the pairing of a wrestler and a rapper with Joanou (Final Analysis)
 at the helm necessarily inspire confidence. Yet the film is a pleasant surprise � a swift, sure-footed, and gritty melodrama that plays to the strengths of its formula and elicits empathy for its kids. A probation officer (Johnson) starts a football team in hopes of lowering the camp's rate of recidivism, grimly training them to take on the snot-nosed pricks of a Christian youth sports league. There's some comic relief (Brandon Smith as the team's tiny, loudmouthed waterboy), but mostly the movie barrels toward you, stiff-armed. Joanou mounts the game sequences with gladiatorial grandeur � granular, slightly accelerated handheld footage slashed together in montage � and every sack echoes with a sickening crunch. These kids aren't contestants but combatants, the field of play a crucible of race and class war. A stunning action set-piece of street violence early in the film likewise unspools at a breakneck pace with the savage, horrible beauty of a Peckinpah shoot-out. Some reviewers have chastened the filmmakers for glamorizing thug life, but the complaint is misguided; its juiced-up style reflects the teenage adrenaline and hair-trigger fury of young men raised fatherless in poverty. The PG-13 rating, however, is too low. As for the Rock? Well, he's the Rock, yelling as if from outside the ropes of World Wrestling Entertainment, but sensibly enough cast as a guy yelling from outside the sidelines.


As long as there are young men dying on America's streets, Hollywood will continue to promise that the key to salvation includes basketball, spelling, or the unstoppable wisdom of Michelle Pfeiffer. Sometimes, in the case of last spring's neglected "Akeelah and the Bee," or "Gridiron Gang," which opens today, the inspirational hogwash takes a back seat to the realities of the crisis at hand.
Good filmmaking and complex characters cut away at the contempt familiarity breeds for based-on-a-true-story tales. And "Gridiron Gang" is well enough made to not leave you too terribly rankled when the pallid documentary footage that plays during the closing credits suggests that this healthier-looking football movie appears to be a shot-for-shot remake.
Still, despite the shameless cutting and pasting, it's hard to argue with the movie's intentions. ``Gridiron Gang" is set at Camp Kilpatrick, a Los Angeles County juvenile detention compound whose delinquents are merely waiting to rejoin their street gangs or resume their lives of petty crime.
Having lost his last recidivist gang banger in a drive-by, probation officer and former high-school football star Sean Porter (Dwayne ``The Rock" Johnson) decides to impose the sport's discipline on his young charges. The administrators are expectantly resistant (Porter is setting them up to fail, goes the argument), and the kids are self-doubting and skeptical. Obviously, it all works out: the Kilpatrick Mustangs have a pretty good maiden season.
But the movie's inevitabilities (the humiliating loss, the ebb and flow of camaraderie, the triumphant finale) have deep resonance. If the actors playing the Kilpatrick residents are tough and charismatic, they also have stores of hurt. These are young men who know the odds are against them, and not because this is the sort of movie that beats you over the head with grim statistics (although it is just that sort of movie).
Porter takes an interest in Willie (Jade Yorker), whose slain cousin was one of Porter's old causes, while taking time to escort his own gravely ill mother (L. Scott Caldwell) to her hospital appointments. Those developments would leave any other movie feeling hopelessly rigged, but this flinty picture needs whatever teary release it can get, however cheap. Not that Johnson is immune to feeling. His masculine sensitivity holds the film together.
The veteran director Phil Joanou and screenwriter Jeff Maguire refuse to keep the kids' outside worlds from intruding on their reasonably safe prison life. Porter and his assistant Malcolm Moore (Xzibit, the rapper and host of ``Pimp My Ride") are paternal saints compared with the inhumanity outside Kilpatrick. The gang bangers we see are like terrorists. Indeed, contrary to most uplifting sports dramas, street life in this movie is meaner and scarier than any of the football plays.


A word of advice to Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson: If you want to be a movie star, change your hair, your man-of-steel body, your indomitable coolness  change something. Surprise us. In Gridiron Gang , the Rock plays the kind of tough-love drill-sergeant sports coach that can be sugared ham for an actor. Recently, performers as diverse as Samuel L. Jackson and Josh Lucas have run with this sort of part, and Greg Kinnear, in Invincible , gives it a geek-chic twist, playing one of those pro football coaches who are personally about as athletic as a weekend golfer but who somehow hold sway over a team of human wrecking machines.
The Rock, on the other hand, takes this perfect handoff of a role and fumbles it. His look is a big problem. He's supposed to be a counselor in the grittiest of youth incarceration centers, but the delinquents have all been cast to appear scruffy and raw and real. Next to them, the Rock, with his chiseled angles, is like something out of a Japanese anime. (We see the true-life counselor the movie was based on over the closing credits, and he's got a mustache and a mullet; he looks like a true dude.) It doesn't help that his dialogue is a wearying chain of inspirational slogans: Go for your dream, don't give in to violence, choose to be a winner. After a while, I thought I was watching Tony Robbins on GNC protein supplements.
Gridiron Gang  parades itself as an ''honest'' message movie, a call for troubled kids to choose life over street nihilism, but the picture is so earnest that it leaves out the easy, old-school pleasure conjured by the last few years of Disney sports flicks (Invincible , Miracle , The Rookie ). It makes going for your dream a slog.

 At Camp Kilpatrick a juvenile detention facility in the Santa Monica Mountains, there’s not a lot for inmates to do besides eat, sleep and beat up rival gang members. So when Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson, a k a the Rock), a probation officer and former delinquent, decides to form a football team, teaching the kids sportsmanship is the least of his problems. First they have to learn how to spell their team name.  “Gridiron Gang,” based on Lee Stanley’s 1993 documentary of the same name, is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its lawlessness and cure it too. Seething with violence — domestic, street and institutional — the movie jumps from heartwarming to murderous without ever convincing us that all these guys need is a coach who cares. They may have learned there’s no “I” in team, but breaking an opponent’s face is still in the playbook; and when a local Christian school agrees to a game, you know that Christians haven’t been in this much peril since ancient Rome.  Directed by Phil Joanou and filmed at the real Camp Kilpatrick, “Gridiron Gang” gains significant momentum from Jeff Cutter’s amped-up photography, most notably on the gridiron itself. But the movie’s good intentions are consistently undermined by its simplistic notion of redemption, and its inspirational thrust is diluted by an epilogue that suggests the program still has a ways to go in the life-altering department.  “Gridiron Gang” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has shootings in the street, brawls on the football field and swearing just about everywhere.

"All inspiration, all the time" is the ethos of "Gridiron Gang," a crowd-pleasing, uplifting, feel-good and not-so-rare hybrid -- the sports/prison movie -- in which Los Angeles gangbangers are taught the virtues of trading violence on the streets for violence on the field. Auds will respond, either to the uplifting message and the solid action sequences. Or, they'll simply wither under the power of the Rock's stentorian delivery of writer Jeff Maguire's motivational lines, each of which should be accompanied by a rimshot.
Compared with the Rock, Charlton Heston's Moses was Wallace Shawn. But the Rock's reality-based character, Sean Porter ("Gridiron Gang" is based on the 1993 documentary of the same name) has his hands full. Disillusioned by the 75% recidivism rate at the juvenile correctional detention center where he spends his days keeping kids from killing each other, Porter decides to put together a football team.
However, the team has no real facilities, no uniforms, no opponents and no support, not even from Porter's colleagues (Leon Rippy and Kevin Dunn). The kids, for that matter, don't really want to play. But Porter is determined. And when he says run wind sprints, people ask, "How fast?"
D.p. Jeff Cutter's shooting gives a muscular authenticity to the camp, where members of warring gangs are kept in dangerously close proximity; and to the playing field, where the once-troubled youth find their way into self-awareness and teamwork.
The process isn't without its hitches: In their first game, Porter's team, the Mustangs, are humiliated, and Porter humiliates himself by losing his cool and berating his players, who, for all their street-toughness, can't handle loss of face. The football program teeters, but small victories ensure that boys will become men, and the coach will become a leader.
A good looking film and a well-executed production, "Gridiron Gang" spends little time getting down to business -- the first 20 minutes include a drive-by shooting, near-assassination, domestic killing, several assaults and the sense that the gang warfare outside could erupt inside at any minute.
Director Phil Joanou ("State of Grace," "Heaven's Prisoners") has a fine story to work with, and the Rock is a charismatic presence, but no one seems confident enough in the material or the audience to allow anything natural to occur. Each little triumph is greeted like the arrival of the wheel and Porter comes across as a little bit Placido Domingo, and a little bit Dr. Phil.
The supporting players are uniformly fine, particularly Jade Yorker and David Thomas as Willie and Kelvin, whose enmity as opposing gang members melts just as the Mustangs cohere as a team. Xzibit is notable as Porter's assistant; he gives a measured performance that's a welcome antidote to so much overstatement of motivation and message.

Former pro wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson , who always made a good show of selling fake violence, stars in Phil Joanou 's well-meant trifle as an idealistic corrections officer who starts up a football team at a juvenile detention center in L.A. Never mind the obvious parallels to The Longest Yard  and Remember the Titans ; what we get here is one huge, indigestible sports movie platitude. The troubled, belligerent teenagers are variously appealing but the movie is another overdose of inspiration, pure and simple, about Winning and Losing. As The Rock himself would have to acknowledge, it means to be the Charging Double-Leg Spinebuster of football-coach hero stories.
