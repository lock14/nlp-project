he familiar visual signposts of alienation are spiffily arrayed in Siegrid Alnoy's handsome but empty film debut, "She's One of Us." The reflective glass surfaces, the anonymous office buildings and the shopping mall where Christine Blanc (Sasha Andres), the movie's central character, spends hours sitting alone and gazing blankly (or "blanc-ly") into space, signify anomie with a capital A. Christine, who is 35 and resembles a fleshier Celine Dion, works as an office temp in a shabby provincial town in the Rh�ne Alps. Her dissociation from others is symbolized by any number of portentous cinematic maneuvers. The protracted silences, the lingering studies of pensive, unreadable faces and the shuffling of the actors into nearly motionless tableaus reveal Ms. Alnoy's enormous debt to Michelangelo Antonioni, who did similar things with a lighter touch and more metaphysical resonance 40 years ago. If the movie's severe visual style is hypnotic, once the elliptical story totters into motion it begins to mean less than meets the eye. At least Ms. Alnoy borrows from the best. The influence of Bruno Dumont, the brilliant director of "L'Humanit�," is also apparent in the meticulous soundtrack, which emphasizes uncomfortable noises, like Christine's heavy breathing. Like Mr. Dumont, Ms. Alnoy favors abrupt shifts of perspective in which characters whose faces have been clinically scrutinized are suddenly viewed from afar. And the scenes of Christine driving through a bleakly lovely winter landscape recall similar moments in Laurent Cantet's "Time Out." Ms. Andres's subtle portrayal of an attractive middle-class woman who can't fit into her surroundings except as an efficient cog in the corporate workplace goes as far as it can to lend the character a larger symbolic weight. Christine is so protective of her privacy that she lies to people about her living circumstances. For no apparent reason, she tells a live-in boyfriend that her father is dead. The drama revolves around Christine's sudden, awkward friendship with Patricia (Catherine Mouchet), the kindly woman from the employment agency that dispatches her on job interviews. After a casual conversation one afternoon, Christine impulsively invites Patricia home to her Spartan apartment for what she calls a potluck dinner but that turns out to be an elegant feast. Knowing Patricia collects ceramic owls,  Christine buys an entire collection ahead of time and presses one on her protesting guest. Christine's pent-up tension explodes when the two women visit a public swimming pool. During a minor altercation Christine pushes Patricia to the slippery tile floor where she cracks her head. Patricia's screams of agony drive Christine to silence her by lethally assaulting her with a fire extinguisher. The rest of the story is a halfhearted cat-and-mouse game in which Christine is pursued by two bumbling policemen and befriended by Degas (Carlo Brandt), a senior police officer who suspects her of homicide but is also attracted to her. Mr. Brandt's wide, radarlike gaze conveys the aura of a man who has seen too much horror. In the wake of the murder, Christine prospers. She lands a full-time job in the accounting department of a trucking company, wins the admiration of her boss, Danjard (Jacques Spiesser), is befriended by a co-worker, Pascale (Mireille Roussel), and finds an eccentric soul mate in her glum assistant, S�bastien (Pierre-F�lix Gravi�re). But these relationships, in which Christine covertly wreaks great harm, are too sketchy to make psychological sense. As it reaches an ending whose ambiguity recalls the conclusion of "Unfaithful," "She's One of Us" leaves you wondering what the point is. Is it a clinical portrait of a quirky sociopath? Or, as seems more likely, is Christine a symbol of the soul-deadening sterility of the modern corporate workplace? If it's a character study, the film is lost in vagueness. If Christine is a metaphor, she's a very tired one.
Along with such recent Gallic offerings as Jacques Audiard 's Read My Lips , Marina de Van 's In My Skin , and Jean-Claude Brisseau 's Secret Things , She's One of Us exposes the inexorable soul suck and barely veiled pathology of the office environment. Siegrid Alnoy's occasionally affecting but overdetermined debut feature mines the most unstable sector of the white-collar class: the temp. Registered with the Worktech 2000 temp agency, Christine Blanc  (Sasha Andres ) shuttles from one deadening three-week assignment to the next at companies with names like Promocash. She dresses as if her entire professional wardrobe came from a Daffy's outlet in the Rhône-Alpes  region: Her ensembles consist of garish reds, bulky shoulder pads, and ill-hanging scarves. Christine's surname is a none-too-subtle description of her affect; years of compiling invoices and photocopying for scores of chilly, indifferent corporations have made her borderline autism a survival skill. Referred to as "Sandrine" by a thoughtless boss who then asks her to fetch her some coffee, Christine endures the indignities with glassy-eyed imperviousnessbut each slight cuts deeply. "It can't be easy to go from job to job," one vacant supervisor says with feigned empathy. "Oh, I like to move around" is Christine's equally lukewarm response.
Unmoored and unhinged, Christine, when not on the clock, drifts from remote wooded areas to food courts, her fragility conveyed by Gabriel Scotti 's anxiety-inducing score. "I love the outskirts and the mallthey don't ask anything of me," she says. Living alone, she makes up a phantom boyfriend; with few interlocutors, she steals overheard bits of conversation and recycles them as her own. Her cathexis is her supervisor at Worktech 2000, Patricia (Catherine Mouchet ). Like Sissy Spacek 's slow-burning crush on Shelley Duvall  in 3 Women , Christine's attachment to Patricia is full of odd, obsessive gestures: Discovering that Patricia has a passion for porcelain owls, Christine quickly amasses her own collection of the tacky figurines. The halting quality of this friendship is the richest part of Alnoy's film, deftly capturing the pivotal moments when stiff unease segues to delicate flirtation.
But when the friendshipand Patriciaare terminated by Christine's murderous rage, She's One of Us  quickly nose-dives into the ridiculous. Now with blood on her hands, the timid temp soon becomes a bloodless permanent employee at a trucking company, complete with a smart chignon, sleeker suits, and a cute boyfriend. As ruthless as Faye Dunaway  in Network  or Joan Crawford  at a Pepsi  shareholders' meeting, the office killer cruelly manipulates an eager colleague hungry for her friendship and approval and orally services the personnel manager.
At times, Alnoy lucidly displays the humiliating aspects of workplace culture, particularly its sense of forced camaraderie, as in a painful scene when Christine's co-workers take her out for drinks (which rivals the cringe-worthy moments of the office Christmas party scene in Il Posto ). But by suggesting that a psychotic break is the necessary precursor to ladder climbingif not basic job securityshe jettisons her nuanced, thoughtful observations for obtuse, overarching ideas about corporate evil. "I'm very sensitive. I know what people feel," Christine oddly confesses to the police inspector (Carlo Brandt ) investigating Patricia's murder. Her own sensitivities dulled by sociopolitical posturing, Alnoy loses sight of what people feel to give them what she thinks they want to hear.
