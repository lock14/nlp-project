Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten  opens with startling black-and-white footage of Joe Strummer in the studio, singing ''White Riot.'' We don't hear any music, just his voice  that strangled lumpen rasp, all ferocity and barbed wire, not so much singing as spitting the lyrics ( ''Whah! Riot! I wanna riot! Whah! Riot! A riot umah own!'' ). Then the sound of the Clash crashes in behind it, and you realize with a shudder that you haven't in a long time heard anything like this rock & roll earthquake. As the song plays, we see footage of the young Joe, the diplomat's son who grew up to do more than just attack ''authority''  he would try to remake the world, declaring that the real authority was you .
The Future Is Unwritten  captures the Joe Strummer who, in the late  1970s, just about firebombed the rock establishment with his fury. On stage, with his sideburns and rockabilly pompadour, which hung down into an early-'60s Brylcreem curl, he was like a scrawny, punk-Marxist James Dean; along with the other lean and hungry members of the Clash, he made rock-as-activism seem sexy. Directed by Julien Temple, The Future Is Unwritten  is styled as a companion piece to Temple's Sex Pistols documentary, The Filth and the Fury  (2000), but it lacks that film's blistering sweep. This one, though, has an intimacy that's rare to encounter in rock docs. It's full of amazing home-movie footage  Joe as a roots-rock London squatter, figuring out his image before punk hit; Joe jamming with the Clash for virtually the first time; Joe partying backstage, puking out a window, or ripping into a journalist for not being ''serious.''
In that tantrum, you see what was great about Strummer and also what, at times, was annoying  the righteousness that could make rock & roll seem like homework. (I still cringe when I think of my lefty college pal nattering about ''the only band that matters.'') A crusader for truth, he wasn't above bedding his bandmates' girlfriends; his post-Clash career, in which he led the party band the Mescaleros, shows the man growing up, but it was also meandering and a little sad. He had already given everything he had. The Future Is Unwritten  made me long for the era when a rock star could burn  and even burn out  this brightly.

 When the Clash was labeled “The Only Band That Matters,” it may have been record company hype, but when I was a teenager,  there was probably no band that mattered more to me. The idealism, the earnest anger, the democratic, sometimes clumsy way of mixing styles and sounds — I am almost as susceptible to it now as I was at 15. This is all by way of disclosure: It’s likely that I would have been stirred and moved by “Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,” even if it were the straightforward, VH1-ready rock star biography it might, at first, appear to be. The film, however, is much more than a biography of the Clash’s guitarist and lead singer: It’s history, criticism, philosophy and politics, played fast and loud.  Directed by Julien Temple,  an able and tireless chronicler of the pop life, “Joe Strummer” assembles clips and interviews into a fast-moving timeline. Mr. Strummer’s voice, captured from radio broadcasts and old conversations, provides narration and companionship. That his presence is limited to audio and archival material provides a sad and subtle reminder of his absence, of the void left by his sudden death at 50, from a heart attack, in 2002.  Like Mr. Temple’s two movies about the Sex Pistols — the eyewitness “Great Rock ’n’ Roll Swindle” (1980) and the revisionist “Filth and the Fury” (2000) — “Joe Strummer” is not so much a portrait as a collage. Sometimes the images are conventionally documentary, serving as literal illustrations of the story. But just as often they provide a kind of free-associative context, reminding us that an individual’s life is made up not only of experiences and events but also of ideas, dreams and possibilities. So while we are treated to marvelous and rare footage of the Clash in rehearsal and Mr. Strummer’s previous bands in performance, we also sample news video and snippets of the cartoon version of “Animal Farm.”  And we hear abundant testimony from Mr. Strummer’s friends, lovers, colleagues and admirers. They are not identified in the course of the movie, though some (Bono, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) are not hard to recognize. Mr. Temple gathers them around campfires with other, less well-known people, and by the time the metaphorical significance of the fires is explained, late in the film, it’s clear that they represent Mr. Strummer’s egalitarian, bohemian spirit.  The story Mr. Temple tells is, like most rock ’n’ roll biographies, one of self-invention. Joe Strummer was born John Graham Mellor. His father was a diplomat, and Joe’s youth was more cosmopolitan and more privileged than his scruffy, proletarian musical persona might suggest. An art school dropout in the best British rock ’n’ roll tradition, he spent the early 1970s as a hippie vagabond, taking the name Woody (as in Guthrie) and bumming and busking around London and other English cities. He was part of the West London squatter scene and the leader of a band called the 101ers when punk rock arrived.  The Clash did not invent punk — who did is the subject of endless argument among partisans of Malcolm McLaren, John Lydon and the Ramones — but the band was decisive in infusing its raw, raging energy with a sense of ethical integrity and political commitment. The heart of “Joe Strummer” is the narrative of the band’s rise, triumph and eventual unraveling, a tale told by survivors, participants, hangers-on and fans and animated by performances that have lost little of their immediacy or force in the intervening years.  The usual rock-doc motifs are there: trouble with management; drug problems; tensions between Mr. Strummer and Mick Jones, the band’s other guitarist and creative force. Once the Clash has broken up, in the mid-1980s, there is a long denouement — for me, I guess it’s called adulthood — during which both Mr. Strummer’s career and Mr. Temple’s film lose a bit of steam. But the waning of punk’s heat leaves behind a surprising afterglow and allows you to appreciate Joe Strummer’s warmth.
Punk died, the Silver Jews  sang, the first time a kid shouted "Punk's not dead!" The words are never uttered in Julien Temple 's Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten , and maybe that's why you come away from this epic doc feeling hopeful about the health of punk's lingering ideals. Piecing together snippets of everything from Raging Bull  to an animated Animal Farm , along with archival scraps, performance clips, and a mosaic of witness testimonies, Temple's engrossing portrait of the Clash 's late frontman uses endlessly suggestive montage to show how he kept punk's precepts alive, even after he left the music and eventually the earth itself.
Was there ever any question about Strummer's cred? Yes, children, depressing as it is to say, people have been arguing what is or isn't or wasn't or shouldn't be punk since Green Day  was in Romper Room. The '70s start, and suddenly you're not the only one who wears rip-kneed jeans, loves three-chord bubblegum played by knock-kneed Bowery hoodlums, and thinks, "Hey, maybe I could do this, too!" The '70s endand suddenly the shapeless horde you found by accident is as regimented and exclusionary as any country club.
A musician in a militantly artless movement, a star who was supposed to disdain celebrity, Joe Strummer didn't so much embody punk as transcend it. Sure, the Sex Pistols  were the bomb throwersin The Future Is Unwritten , their arrival on-screen is greeted with an explosion. But in Strummer, punk got an ambitious (and unironic) generalissimo with the stage presence, the songwriting skill, and the rhetorical firepower to take the revolt over the barricades. And in the quantum leap from the self-titled Clash album to London Calling , punk got exactly what it wasn't supposed to have: a future.
The Future Is Unwritten  doesn't smooth over the contradictions in Strummer's story: It leads with them, intercutting shots of the singer snarling the classic "White Riot"that electrifying hoarse barrage of accusatory verbal eighth-noteswith glimpses of a fresh-cheeked lad enjoying his well-off boyhood. A career diplomat's son, the young John Mellor  got the best education that posh British schools could providein class resentment. He retained the lessons well. Like Bob Dylan , he initially modeled himself on Woody Guthrie , the man whose guitar was a machine that killed fascists.
Temple heralds the awakening of Strummer's political conscience with the schoolyard uprising of Lindsay Anderson 's If . . .  and the meat-grinder chords of the MC5's "Kick Out the Jams"a juxtaposition that packs a page's worth of high/low cultural analysis into a few fleeting frames. In his school days, Strummer says on the soundtrack, he learned "you either formed a gang or were crushed." After attempts to reinvent himself as a busker and a quasi-rockabilly cat, he found his gangand with it his destiny as the bullhorn for Britain's roiling underclass.
Templewho directed Johnny Rotten & Co. in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle , then made up for it 20 years later with the superior Pistols doc The Filth and the Fury has compiled the testimony of adoring fans, from the inevitable (Bono, Jim Jarmusch ) to the inexplicable (ahoy, Captain Jack Sparrow !). He's gathered pungent drugs-to-fistfights dish from Clash mainstays Mick Jones , Paul Simonon , and Topper Headon ; he's found sizzling concert clips that chart the band's bewildered rise to top of the pops, along with their desultory breakup. Factor in the bittersweet triumph that caps Strummer's storyhis success with the roots-rocking Mescaleros after years of indirection, and a surprise Clash mini-reunion before his death in 2002and the film has all the ingredients for DIY pop hagiography.
But that's not what Temple ends up with. The Future Is Unwritten  is less a eulogy than a wake, and one in which the subject is startlingly present. Strummer started revising his epitaph in the mid-'80s, after his success began to feel like a cosmic joke: He wanted no part of singing "Career Opportunities" to a sold-out stadium, or watching as U.S. bombs labeled "Rock the Casbah" rained on the Middle East. He's shown here in later years, mellow and heavier, presiding over a different kind of tribal bonding: a campfire ritual at the Glastonbury fest  that served as a meeting ground for kindred spirits, much as punk first mustered its ragtag army of squatters and misfits.
These campfires continued after his death and give The Future Is Unwritten  its shape as well as its spirit. From Los Angeles to New York to Ireland , friends, family, and fans gather around the fire pit to remember Joe as the glow fades into dawn. It's Strummer's own voicea radio-show track filled with warmth and optimismthat threads together the separate locales, along with snatches of favorite songs. Temple's punk-bred refusal to identify (and thus privilege) any of his interview subjects on-screen can be maddening. But in the final shots of these makeshift gatherings silhouetted against the lightening sky, the individuals combine into a joyous, vibrant community larger than any one component. As a definition of punk, that probably would have worked for Joe Strummer.
