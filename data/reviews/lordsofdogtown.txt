The skateboarders in ''Lords of Dogtown" rush the camera. They spin around it, speed toward it, then swerve away. On several occasions, they wear black T-shirts that make it tough to tell them apart. On skateboards, they're less a gang of hormonal teens than an entrancing, almost hallucinogenic athletic swarm -- the constellation of dark stars you see after you've pressed your hands into your eyes.
The movie is like a daydream, and it's most infectious when the characters are in motion or misbehaving, which is often.
By the mid-'70s, skating was primarily a recreational activity. The appearance of concrete-gripping urethane wheels serendipitously timed with a Southern California drought that left swimming pools empty allowed adventurous kids to discover that they could, in effect, surf them with their skateboards.
The boys in this film are addicted to dry pools, which they'll do anything to get to -- scale fences, risk breaking the law, even seduce girls. There's a terrific sequence in which a hot new girl appears at the edge of one of these waterless pools, and the boys take turns skating up the side, as the frame slows down, to say, ''Hi." I doubt I'll see anything more evocatively sexy all summer.
Written by the skate legend Stacy Peralta, ''Lords of Dogtown" recalls how three of these Venice Beach teens, Peralta among them, helped infuse verve into an American backyard hobby, turning skateboarding into the sort of activity that spawns groupies. Peralta made ''Dogtown and Z-Boys," a likable documentary, out of these reminiscences a few years ago, and the guiding model for this new Hollywood version isn't really sports at all, it's rock 'n' roll.
A lot of the bickering and back-stabbing and breaking up and fence mending we've seen before. Envy and fame predictably encroach on the friendships among some of the Z-Boys -- straight-arrow Stacy (John Robinson), bad-boy Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch), and hotheaded stud Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk).
The movie feels like a washed-out, pseudo-stoned Beatles movie, with the skateboard as both the boys' yellow submarine and their Yoko. Heath Ledger as Skip, the surfer whose Zephyr board shop is sponsoring the Z-Boys at competitions, is their George Martin, and Sid (Michael Angarano), the most hapless Z-Boy, is Ringo.
Directing all this is Catherine Hardwicke, whose enthusiasm for the antics, the sport, its practitioners, and their personalities calls to mind the cockeyed glee of Richard Lester, the man responsible for ''A Hard Day's Night" and ''Help."
Hardwicke seems intimately familiar with the movie's Venice locales, and the scruffy and exuberant folks who populate the screen seem well in her control, much more so than in her first film, ''Thirteen," which traveled in similar geographical, sexual, and social terrain, but was desperate to shock.
Yet ''Thirteen" and ''Lords of Dogtown" are of a piece. Both films redolently capture aspects of adolescence -- the trippy house parties, the palpable sensuality, the melange of skin colors. Outside one party, Jay does a primitive seduction dance to Jimi Hendrix's ''Fire" for Tony's sister (Nikki Reed, the young co-writer and costar of ''Thirteen") right after her boyfriend, Stacy, leaves. It goes on long enough for a little naughtiness, and a little voodoo to creep in. It works.
Hardwicke, editor Nancy Richardson, and cinematographer Elliot Davis certainly treat the skating with awe, but the movie is serious about its characters, too. Going in, I was worried that Hardwicke would be a prurient and creepy voyeur of youth culture, the way photographers-turned-filmmakers Bruce Weber and Larry Clark can be. Could this woman really identify
 with these boys? She's about 50. Whatever: The movie has soul, and it stays plugged into the class realities in Peralta's script, which doesn't stint on the boys' complicated home lives.
Jay's mom is a burnout who can't keep a man and is somehow a more ineffectual parent than the one Holly Hunter played in ''Thirteen." Rebecca De Mornay gives the part her tweaked-out all, but her glazed-over blankness makes skater moms look too daffy.
The actors playing the boys, meanwhile, are spirited performers. Rasuk is pure unbridled energy and sex appeal, just as he was in ''Raising Victor Vargas." Robinson (the boy with the curious look on his face in Gus Van Sant's ''Elephant") plays Stacy with relative decorum, all while looking very much like an Arquette sister. Peralta may have portrayed himself as the squeaky cleanest of the crew, but Jay is the role of a star, and Hirsch, who was recently in the smarter-than-it-seemed sex comedy ''The Girl Next Door," gets better with every movie.
Ledger, though, delivers the greatish performance, even while mumbling through prosthetic teeth. Skip is blond and out of it. His attempts to make names for the Z-Boys are undermined by sponsors with more money. But Ledger doesn't go pitiful. He plays every scene for comedy, knowing the best way to break our hearts is to crack us up first.
I'm still not sure the man is a great actor, but here Ledger has shown us something completely unexpected: the finest work that 
Val Kilmer has never done.


         The rowdy and sometimes painfully raw "Lords of Dogtown" is a perfect marriage between film and skateboarder, and the way in which the camera tracks every incredible move of the movie's virtuosos gives it a dynamic, exhilarating energy.
 
  But the film offers much more than that, for as a narrative it allows for more dimension and involvement than the 2001 documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys," directed by Stacy Peralta, who in the '70s became a pioneering skateboard superstar along with his pals Tony Alva and Jay Adams.
 


         






    Now Peralta has turned screenwriter, dramatizing their story in no-holds-barred fashion but entrusting the film's direction to Catherine Hardwicke, an inspired choice, given the insight and compassion for troubled, reckless teens she revealed so memorably in "Thirteen."
 
  Two events coincided in the mid-'70s that would allow these three teenagers and their friends to transform a pastime involving nothing more spectacular than endless handstands and 360-degree spins into a dazzling, dizzying precursor of extreme sports. First was the invention of urethane wheels and, second, the drought that emptied swimming pools all over Westside L.A. This meant the skateboarders now had wheels that could grip concrete, leading to "the birth of the vertical," with these budding stars able to skate up the curved sides of pools.
 
  With the exception of their rich kid cohort Sid (Michael Angarano), Stacy (John Robinson), Jay (Emile Hirsch) and Tony (Victor Rasuk) live in or near Dogtown, composed of parts of Venice, Ocean Park and south Santa Monica. For their skating style, they took inspiration from surfers, who wove in and out of the pilings of the rotting Pacific Ocean Park pier, closed in 1967. They hung out at the Zephyr Surf Shop, run by Skip (Heath Ledger, in a sometimes wavering "dude" accent), a hard-living hell-raiser. He organized the skateboarders into a team, the Z-Boys, and entered them into competitions that made them virtually overnight sensations.
 
  At this point, the picture exalts in the Z-Boys' carefree, nervy lifestyle, in which these teens' daring stunts on wheels matched the intensity of their partying and girl-chasing.
 
  Differences in the key players' personalities emerge subtly. Stacy is decidedly the most serious of the triumvirate, while Tony craves the better life he believes the riches of stardom will bring. The most impoverished and troubled of the three, Jay above all wants to be able to take care of his mother (Rebecca De Mornay), a loving but ineffectual woman, an aging California Girl who has endured too much partying and too much sun.
 
  Hardwicke and Peralta deftly begin moving past this period in the Z-Boys' lives, which in hindsight appears innocent and idyllic, as they become targeted by promoters out to exploit them — with Stacy and Tony but not Jay ultimately able to outsmart their exploiters. "Lords of Dogtown" at this point takes on a satirical edge, as the marketeers, merchandisers and media turn the three into superstars — Stacy even lands a guest spot on "Charlie's Angels."
 
  The film never loses its heart, as the limelight and spiraling competition strain friendships and incite ugly behavior but reveal a youthful vulnerability that makes the three engaging and their sometimes obnoxious, self-defeating behavior understandable under the circumstances. As in "Thirteen" Hardwicke has been able to inspire unsparing portrayals from young actors, and Robinson, Hirsch, Rasuk and Angarano are completely winning. William Mapother is incisive, as usual, as one of a number of slick types eager to cash in on the Z-Boys.
 
  "Lords of Dogtown" is as beautifully structured as one of the Z-Boys' graceful and intricate maneuvers. It is economic yet possesses depth and is visually striking, capturing an idea of what life is like in a very fast lane. Elliot Davis' camerawork is a marvel of fluidity, yet its flourishes serve the story and never merely call attention to themselves.
 
  Recent decades are always a challenge to evoke, because of their inherently dated effect, but production designer Chris Gorak and costume designer Cindy Evans move the audience back three decades without a trace of self-consciousness or caricature. The same goes for Mark Mothersbaugh's score.
 
  "Lords of Dogtown" isn't nostalgic — it's too clear-eyed for that; it's happening right now.

When the sullen and fearless blond teenage boys in Lords of Dogtown  ride their skateboards, never pausing to think about anything that isn't  directly in front of them, the movie joins them right on the pavement, racing forward with grungy velocity, showing us what the skaters are seeing and feeling as they ride along back alleys, dilapidated asphalt playgrounds, and any other available surface: a world of trash transcended. The camera, sharing the high, threads its way through a double row of cars, and it's like a moment out of a Jerry Bruckheimer chase thriller, except that there's nothing at all fanciful or exaggerated about it. The sequence gives you a charge because it's entirely real  a God-on-the-street's-eye view of skateboard heaven.
The year is 1975, and the daredevil boarders  Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch)  are the original skate punks. They're from Venice and Santa Monica, a.k.a. Dogtown, a rough-and-tumble ''ghetto by the sea'' that's nevertheless been touched by the stoned karma of surf culture. The surfers, macho as bikers, are a fading breed, but the skateboarders are too young to have tasted the '60s. They're disaffected hippie fallout, the long-haired sleepy children of divorce and drugs, and they translate surf moves  the extremes of balance and plunging bravado  from water to concrete. They take a pastime that's little more than a hula hoop novelty and turn it into a sexy, thrashing assertion of underground style.
Lords of Dogtown  is a docudrama, rare in its grit and authenticity, that also strives for the mythical youth-rebel excitement of something like 8 Mile . The film was written by Peralta himself, and it stays extremely close to the events laid out in his superb 2002 documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys . We see the introduction of urethane wheels, which allow the skaters to grip any surface, and we meet Skip Engblom, the bedraggled burnout of a surf-shop owner who organizes the kids into the Zephyr Team, which becomes their debauched surrogate family. Skip is played by Heath Ledger, who gives a witty performance as a sloshed old lion who still has some bite left. The first time the Z-Boys show up at a competition, skating to Black Sabbath, it's hilarious  they're like devil hooligans invading a garden party. But they become a sensation. You might say that they're escaping the reality of their lives, except that the director, Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen ), shows you how skateboarding, for these kids, is reality  the only one they care about. When they sneak into emptied-out swimming pools during a Southern California drought, riding their boards up and over the walls of the curvy smooth basins, it's because they're looking for a more bone-jangling rush, a way to cut through the numbness, to vent their aggression as they soar. The pools become bowls of vertical bliss.
Hardwicke is the rare director whose work is at once kinesthetic and delicate. She stages Lords of Dogtown  with a rushing, caught-on-the-fly realism that may, in the end, prove more artful than commercial, yet she makes her characters vibrant and full. The contrasting temperaments of the brash, moonstruck Tony, the chivalrous Stacy, and the moody, troubled Jay come to the fore gradually, as they're confronted with success. The three become stars, boy kings of the '70s media/endorsement culture, and in different ways  it tears each of them apart. But that, the movie says, is tied to the nature of what they invented: a sport that never had any motive beyond the go-for-broke impulse of flying off the next curve.

ords of Dogtown," directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a script by Stacy Peralta, is about a minor pop-cultural earthquake made possible by the serendipitous convergence, in Los Angeles in 1975, of two otherwise unremarkable events. One was a drought that emptied the region's swimming pools, leaving their smooth, curving concrete interiors available for other uses, and the other was the arrival, in a Santa Monica surf shop, of a paper bag full of urethane wheels. Attached to a skateboard, these wheels enabled a skilled rider to execute hard turns; long, easy glides; and quick changes of direction. In an empty swimming pool or along a section of concrete pipe, skateboarding could at last realize its potential to become the land-based equivalent of surfing, with its own ethos, its own stars and its own marketing possibilities. Mr. Peralta, one of the founders of this legend-shrouded subculture (played in the film by John Robinson, a slender, pretty young actor introduced to movie audiences in Gus Van Sant's "Elephant"), has lately emerged as its leading cinematic historian. "Lords of Dogtown" represents both a dramatic expansion and a narrative compression of the story he told in "Dogtown and Z Boys," an energetic documentary released in 2002. This film follows the knot of teenage boys at the center of the Venice, Calif., skateboarding scene - Mr. Peralta, Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Sid Gianetti (Michael Angarano) - as they grapple with rivalry, family problems and the consequences of sudden fame. They must also struggle with their shaggy mentor, Skip Engblom, owner of the Zephyr surfboard shop and a less than ideal role model. Played by Heath Ledger in what seems to be a demented tribute to Val Kilmer's performance in "The Doors," Skip is always volatile, frequently drunk and consistently the most entertaining figure in the movie. Which is saying something, since "Lords of Dogtown," from start to finish, is pretty much a blast. Ms. Hardwicke, whose previous film as a director was "Thirteen," shares with Mr. Peralta an enthusiastic interest in young people that is neither condescending nor exploitative. Drawing on her long experience as a production designer (and on the skills of her director of photography, Elliot Davis, who also shot "Thirteen"), she has given the movie an appropriately scruffy, unpolished look consistent with the resourceful, do-it-yourself aesthetic of the place and time it depicts. She and Mr. Peralta are more interested in evoking a milieu than in telling a story, and their scenes have both the loose, stop-and-start rhythms of a long summer day and the restless, competitive energy of young men in the heat of adolescence. What plot there is consists of a set of familiar signposts and crises - girl trouble, family trouble, emotional trouble, skateboard trouble - but the filmmakers nonchalantly weave through them, subordinating the predictability of narrative to the spontaneous pleasures of style. The acting is appealingly low-key, in keeping with the skaters' code of cool, watchful reserve, but the distinct and contrasting personalities of the main characters emerge all the same. Tony, with his caramel skin and curly blond mane, is vain and ambitious, eager for the stardom that awaits him and perhaps willing to betray his friends to achieve it. Jay, perhaps the most talented skater, is also the least able to cash in on his skills. Stacy, the straight arrow, is at first left off the Zephyr team because he is unwilling to let go of the responsibilities of job and school. Sid, a rich kid whose inner-ear troubles prevent him from doing much on the board, serves as an all-purpose sidekick. The main women in the story are Jay's sad, burnt-out mother (Rebecca De Mornay) and Tony's sister, Kathy (Nikki Reed), whom both Jay and Stacy have a thing for. And there is a louche promoter (Johnny Knoxville) who makes Skip look like a scoutmaster. What unites the younger characters, and what gives "Lords of Dogtown" its buoyant, rebellious kick is the combination of recklessness and discipline that defines their approach to skateboarding. Their lives are a complicated and perhaps typically Southern California blend of hedonism and striving. Apart from Sid, they have all grown up pretty hard: Kathy and Tony are the children of a tough, working-class Mexican-American father; Jay's mother, perpetually sunburned and a little unstable, works in a lamp factory and lives with her son in a tiny, cluttered apartment near the beach. But the climate and their own rambunctiousness combine to give these kids a sense of freedom and possibility that is at once antisocial - they throw punches, trash restaurants and break into suburban homes - and upwardly mobile. Not having been there, I can hardly vouch for the movie's accuracy, but there is something about it that feels right - the looseness of its construction, the eclectic welter of its soundtrack, the faces of its cast. Mr. Peralta, having sustained his youthful obsession into middle age (and turned it into a varied and lucrative career), looks back without nostalgia, and Ms. Hardwicke makes you feel as if it's all happening now. "Lords of Dogtown" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some bad language, sexual situations and mild violence.

As long as the skateboarding rules in "Lords of Dogtown," this saga stays close to the essential vibe of the exploits of a rag-tag Venice crew profiled in Stacy Peralta's scintillating docu, "Dogtown and Z-Boys." But it's a wipeout once the pic skids into melodrama and an overly schematic sense of how success tore the group apart. That Peralta wrote the script -- his first drama after a series of fine docs -- will have cache among the alternative sports crowd. But will such an aud bother showing up at theaters, or will it just wait for the video? 
The irony within the gang of surfers/skateboarders who hung around Skip Engblom's Zephyr surf shop in 1975 is that, despite their refusal to follow society's rules, they were just as easily sucked into dreams of material success as the next guy. Any dramatic re-telling has to be about more than just this, yet "Lords" remains superficial and disconcertingly conventional.
Rags-to-riches ride starts in 1975, as Stacy (John Robinson, in long blonde locks as Peralta's younger self), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) vie for space on the waves crashing dangerously close to the Pacific Ocean Park pier near Venice, Calif., a ruin of a once-splendid oceanfront amusement park. Proving themselves on the pipe to grizzled vets including Skip (Heath Ledger), the trio also leads a pack of skateboarders, applying the principles of surfing to the street.
This crucial concept of surfing culture defining skateboarding culture, so evocatively explained in Peralta's docu, is only implied here, so that we see the natural flow from water to concrete as little more than dudes with all the time in the world pulling outrageous stunts in alleys and thoroughfares. Skip's breakthrough is scoring some polyurethane tires that allow the guys to go vertical, and it's hard to know who's more excited -- the Pied Piper-like Skip and his merry band, or director Catherine Hardwicke, whose cameras are right there, with bonus cutaways to p.o.v. shots from the wheel's angle.
Hardwicke's filmmaking deliberately recalls a loose, even agreeably sloppy style common to '70s pics by Jerry Schatzberg and Monte Hellman about characters on the social margins. When the Zephyr team (or Z-Boys) blow away the plodding competition in a Del Mar tourney, the sequence is like a celebration of radical and sexy sports bravado winning over hearts and minds.
Piece de resistance, though, is a rollicking section devoted to the clan's discovery of backyard pools, drained during a mid-'70s Southern California water shortage, and how the kidney shape and sharp bowl design is the perfect skating rink for some unbelievable moves (all of them superbly cut and shot to match famous photos of the time, and seamlessly blending stunt doubles and thesps).
But various personal dramas are fitfully developed, and pic's energy dissipates. Jay's character dominates, from his inability to hook up with Tony's foxy sister Kathy (Nikki Reed, who debuted in Hardwicke's "Thirteen") to his growing alienation as Tony and Stacy cash in on their newfound fame as skateboarding stars. Peralta fails to give his autobiographical self any identity at all, except as a dude who has to prove himself to earn a spot on the squad.
As Tony, Stacy and other Zephyr kids (most of whom aren't sketched in) land on magazine covers and score top-dollar contracts, Jay and Skip plunge into depressed stasis. Jay's inability to parlay the Z-Boys winning streak into a pro career is a key element the film fails to explore in a satisfying way. He may be dragged down by his impoverished hippie mom Philaine (Rebecca De Mornay, in a wonderfully committed perf) more a friend than a mother, but at least he has her support -- which is more than can be said for Tony, whose father (Julio Oscar Mechoso) is a nearly comical stereotype of the brutalizing macho Latino patriarch.
With so little to draw from their written characters, Hirsch, Robinson, Rasuk and Michael Angarano as team mascot and hearing-impaired weakling Sid, impose their own sense of youthful desire and anger to the episodic events. Nearly unrecognizable at first, Ledger's Skip goes from gruff stoner boss to a pathetic shell of a man, but the change isn't always convincing. Giving the pic life when it needs it most is a blond-haired Johnny Knoxville as flashy impresario Topper Burks.
Grimy, rough working-class beach hoods are thoroughly captured by production designer Chris Gorak and Elliot Davis' ceaselessly roving camera, guided by the same understanding of place and design that former production designer Hardwicke brought to "Thirteen." From Hendrix's "Voodoo Child" to Neil Young's "Old Man," KCRW deejay and music supervisor Liza Richardson knocks herself out with a brilliant selection of period tunes.

Catherine Hardwicke  turns from girl problems to boy problems for Lords of Dogtown , translating Thirteen 's Angeleno teen ennui into a narrative account of the early days of skateboarding, adapted by screenwriter Stacy Peralta  from his documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys . Leaner and sharper than its fast-and-furious TV spots would let on, Lords  follows the fortunes of four skating pioneers: strutting Tony Alva  (Raising Victor Vargas  's Victor Rasuk , turned West Coast bro), brooding badass Jay Adams  (Emile Hirsch ), nebbishy runt Sid (Michael Angarano ), and teen Peralta (Elephant 's baby-faced John Robinson ), scripted by his adult self as an uptight skate wonk.
The crew starts as a gaggle of miniature beach punks, incubating in a Venice Beach  of rotting piers, zonked-out hippie parents, and the chaotic surf shop of low-rent entrepreneur Skip Engblom portrayed by Heath Ledger  as a humanoid Spuds MacKenzie  with a fly-catching SoCal drawlwho assembles the Z-Boys into a ratty competition team. Once they're recognized for their street-savvy innovative skills by the impresarios of the nascent pro circuit, Alva and Peralta zip vertically into scene stardom, while Adams descends into poorly sponsored cholo -esque delinquency, complete with bandanna and flannel.
Punctuated with legitimately engagingaction bits, grimy pavement-level sound recording, and the occasional blink of wheel-cam, the film's well-cast character study counterbalances its function as self-hagiog-raphy; Peralta carefully paints his generation with kindly brushstrokes (after positioning himself as good-kid center, whose only sin is working too hard) while skate-culture cameos by Tony Hawk  and Johnny Knoxville  (as usual, dealing instant scene death with every line) provide expected insider fan service. Channeling Amy Heckerling  for the post-emo era, Hardwicke's pop-Cassavetes melodrama nevertheless rides as smoothly as a big-budget after-school special, capturing youth struggles from an appropriately blown-out teen's-eye perspective. Parents and their professional analogues are fallible agents of love, handicapped by their own eternal West Coast adolescence. The director stagflates the film's hardscrabble '70s environs until one can almost hear the dull clinking of food stamp tokens inside a macramé purse, providing the protags with a survival-level rationale for selling out as fast as their little urethane wheels will take them.
Such is the logic of the sports biopic, in which flights of talent and ambition need best be undergirded by a morally correct narrative engine, powered by existential necessity; audiences forgive the rumbling of a stomach before the feeding of an ego. So Dogtown  's grubby recession looks like a playground romp next to Cinderella Man 's ashen Depression-era setting, an all the more appropriate motivation for its boxer-hero's brutally agonistic slugfests. Russell Crowe  updates his Gladiator  role to the 20th century, portraying real-life prizefighter Jim Braddock  as a ringside messiah whose own late-career comeback from washed-up working-class punching bag to world champeen not only feeds his starving family, but provides the sallow-fleshed masses withcoughsomething to believe in.
Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard  spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment. Paul Giamatti  fast-talks as Braddock's suspendered manager, Joe Gould , playing the role of supportive man-spouse, after his real wife (Renée Zellweger ) hennishly urges him away from pugilism. Beat down by the nation's economic bottoming-out, Braddock lets out his class rage on the bodies of fellow travelers (in the ring, he says, "at least I know who's hittin' me") until he reaches the ultimate anger object: hulking pretty-boy Hollywood -type Max Baer  (Craig Bierko ), complete with flossy showgirl entourage and the acme of '30s rich-male villain wear, a leonine fur coat. Having killed two opponents, Baer long-arms his literally deadly head blows with a showy grin; he's a mere monocle away from functioning as a populist caricature of ruthless capitalism itself.
Howard keeps the action tight, with most of the plot used as elaborate and efficient setup for the film's climactic 20-minute battle. A few period details go a long way: Gould's barren upper-middle-class apartment, emptied of all but the attitude of wealth; sports reporters jamming on stand-up typewriters flush against ringside; Zellweger and kids stealing wood from an Esso sign after their electricity has been shut off; a boxer with a gnarly, potato-like face straight out of a WPA painting. Aside from a handful of fairy-tale motifs, riffing on the Damon Runyon -coined title, the most enigmatic reference seems to be thrown in for obscure historical touch: a bank of coming-attractions posters advertising S.O.S. Iceberg , a Leni Riefenstahl  mountain film. Not quite enough for a WW II omen, they might hint at seeing Cinderella Man  as a mythic-democratic Triumph of the Will .
Future analysts of American culture may be just as perplexed at the Adam Sandler -Chris Rock  remake of '70s comedy The Longest Yard , in which a ragtag football team of multicultural prison inmates is assembled to hit the gridiron against a steroided phalanx of Aryan Southern guardsand will no doubt ponder why an incarceration-crazy society ends up rooting for the objects of its own control anxiety as comedic underdogs. Add to this otherwise painless comedy an unmysterious obsession with feminized men as objects of ridicule, from a cleverly grotesque troupe of prison bitch cheerleaders to a tedious peppering of fops and faggots. No uplifting populism here: In a man's world, even the underdogs get their own underdogs to piss on.
