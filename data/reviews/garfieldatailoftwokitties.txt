It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of computer-animated summer movies for children, it was the age of bland and perfunctory sequels with phoned-in voice work. It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity that the first Garfield
 movie made $75 million and generated a second � a second with not one but two
 CGI cats and an overseas location. Viewers have everything before them (talking farm animals! a sneering villain! topiary hedges! London scenery!) and nothing before them (Meyer and Hewitt are virtually nonexistent, even when they�re onscreen together). There is a cat with a large belly and a love of lasagna (and the voice of Murray) on the throne of his master�s house; there is an identical cat (voice of Curry) on the throne of Carlyle castle, an estate on the upper Thames. There is an inevitable prince-and-the-pauper mix-up; there are fart jokes and lengthy musical interludes to pad the film. There is a Rottweiler to bite repeatedly the crotch of the cats� nemesis (Connolly), a mustache-twirling royal pretender who also takes a ferret up the trousers. All these things, and a thousand like them, come to pass in the film�s 90-minute running time with nary a moment of pleasure. Perfectly respectable English thespians � Bob Hoskins, Jane Horrocks, Richard E. Grant, and Vinnie Jones � are laid to waste voicing the flesh-and-blood animals (Rhys Ifans fares the best as a Scots bunny) while Garfield breakdances. A children�s movie about wily farm animals besting their human enemy and saving their manor might have been worth watching, but what is Garfield doing here? Jim Davis� cartoon strip (and its television incarnations, with voice work by the deadpan Lorenzo Music) isn�t high art, but it at least has a sly charm and a point to make: People are whipped by their pets. It�s about the loving but contentious relationship between cat and man, not about cramming a frame with as many talking animals doing as much wacky shit as possible. A Tail of Two Kitties
 couldn�t care less about its human principals, and all it wants its animals to do is air-guitar to �Cat Scratch Fever� and wear silly sunglasses. It�s sort of the Hollywood equivalent of a Tijuana donkey painted to look like a zebra, but not quite as funny.


Maybe you've been waiting all your life for a kids' movie that makes room for a word like ``doppelganger." Or maybe you're a Bill Murray fan who's become so nostalgic for the actor's goofier side that he's even appealing as a fat, sarcastic, butterscotch-colored feline.
But probably you'll only be attracted to ``Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties" if you're very young, you're very easily entertained, or you just can't get enough of Jim Davis's lasagna-scarfing cartoon cat. And even then, you might want to wait till the movie comes out on DVD so you can skip over the drippy Breckin Meyer/Jennifer Love Hewitt parts.
To be fair, this Tim Hill-directed sequel isn't really any worse than 2004's toothless ``Garfield" (directed by Peter Hewitt), and there's about as much mild amusement in its screenplay, co-written by the returning team of Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow. Once again, the story stars a computer-generated version of the popular comic-strip cat, who talks, sings, dances, and makes fun of most everyone around him in a live-action landscape where he's the only animated character.
Well, almost
 the only animated character. This time out, Garfield (voiced by Murray) has a snooty look-alike named Prince (voiced by Tim Curry), who's living the pampered life on an English estate.
The two cats meet when Garfield's owner, Jon (Meyer), travels to London to propose to his veterinarian girlfriend, Liz (Hewitt). Garfield and his nonverbal canine housemate, Odie, smuggle themselves across the pond, eventually landing at tourist sites from Big Ben to Buckingham Palace, where Odie's high point is peeing on a guard.
Meanwhile, over at the Castle Carlyle, Prince's owner has just died and left him the property, much to the dismay of greedy Lord Dargis (Billy Connolly), the next in line. Dargis tosses Prince into a river that winds its way to London, and before long the two identical cats find themselves swapping places a la Lindsay Lohan in the ``Parent Trap" remake.
Scooped up by the castle butler, Garfield discovers what it's like to live in the lap of luxury while also missing no opportunity to insult his English hosts, including a bulldog voiced by Bob Hoskins and a goose with the honk of Sharon Osbourne. Prince spends his time torturing Odie and discovering the joys of lasagna, which stopped being a funny food about two minutes after it first appeared in Davis's decades-old strip.
Other than Murray's vocal showboating, the thing that won over fans of the first ``Garfield" movie was seeing their favorite grumpy cartoon pet remade as a cuddly special effect. That fascination has probably worn off in this sequel, and though Murray and Curry gamely deliver some chuckle-worthy one-liners along the way, they're mostly leashed to material as moldy and uninspired as the ``Jeffersons" theme song.
Movin' on up? Not this cat.


Sad tidings, Dickens scholars: Despite its title,  Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties , this unnecessary sequel to 2004's unnecessary Garfield: The Movie  has little in common with A Tale of Two Cities . It's closer to The Prince and the Petit Bourgeois : The furry bag of CG jelly strenuously billed as ''the world's favorite cat'' trades places with feline royalty, giving a host of British thesps (Bob Hoskins, Tim Curry) the opportunity to debase themselves as animal voices. In the ''flesh,'' Garfield himself (voiced by Bill Murray) is once again strikingly unlikable, a bloated, bingeing fascist.

 It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, albeit in Britain, not France, when I heard that my beloved aunt had left her estate to her pampered feline, Prince. One in a long line of indulged cats that have sat mewling at the feet of our royal line, Prince had all but squandered my aunt's fortune with his profligate ways by the time she shuffled off this mortal coil.  While the estate's ragged bestiary was forced to live in cramped outdoor quarters, Prince was slavishly tended to indoors by a sycophantic bulldog, Winston, and scores of human servants, who dropped everything at the tinkling of his bell.  Determined to right this wrong, I, Lord Dargis  — my aunt's only human heir and a gentle man unfairly branded  'nefarious'  by shadowy agents  — borrowed a chapter from the Book of Moses. Taking enormous care, I set the animal afloat on the Thames in a sturdy picnic basket, knowing that providence looks after all creatures great and small.  Alas, through a series of inexplicable events, an obese American hairball named Garfield wrecked my campaign. Accompanied by a pallid human, Jon, and a charming canine named Odie, this monstrous orange tabby, after running amok in the castle, helped engineer the return of his look-alike.  And so, once again, the animals of the estate have been forced into servitude by this wretched beast. The noble horse is forced to bow to Prince on what looks to be painful bended knee, while the geese are forced to trumpet the cat's arrival as if announcing the entrance of the Queen herself. The indignities are as enormous as the food bills, the American cat having only encouraged Prince in his native gluttony.  As for me, after attempting my humble palace coup, I was hauled off by the authorities, my bespoke clothes and dignity in tatters. But I know all is not lost. To borrow and slightly emend the words of Shakespeare:  That cat will mew, but this dog will have the day.    "Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Good kitty! Superior in every way to its underwhelming predecessor, "Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties" is a genuinely clever kidpic that should delight moppets, please parents -- and maybe tickle a few tweens. The Fox release faces a real catfight at the box office, however: In addition to "Cars" and "Over the Hedge," the surprisingly child-friendly "Nacho Libre" also is competing for family auds. But, if the disappointingly tepid "Garfield: The Movie" (2004) could gross nearly $200 million worldwide, this frisky follow-up may could claw its way toward even more impressive grosses before it catapults to the top of homevid sales charts. 
Much like the previous "Garfield" opus, new pic offers a seamless juxtaposition of a computer-generated title character with flesh-and-blood co-stars and digitally-tweaked quadrupeds. But the sequel doesn't merely coast along on the novelty of having Garfield, the indolent orange tabby of comic-strip fame, interacting with real people (and mostly real animals).
It helps that Bill Murray, once more voicing the lasagna-loving feline, seems appreciably less arch and more engaged in his second go-round as Garfield. But it helps even more that scripters Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow have devised a slightly more complex plot -- the title might suggest Charles Dickens, but the real inspiration is Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper" -- and much funnier funny business.
Garfield is a slackerish, wisecracking cat who easily manipulates Jon (Breckin Meyer), his affable but clueless owner. (Once again: We can hear Garfield talk -- indeed, we can hear just about every animal in the pic talking to each other -- but Jon and other on-screen humans can't.)
When Jon attempts to propose to veterinarian g.f. Liz (perky but underutilized Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield deftly sabotages the poor guy's plans for a romantic evening. But Jon isn't easily thwarted: He impulsively flies to London while Liz attends a Royal Animal Conservatory conference there, to take a second shot at popping the question.
Of course, Garfield stows away in Jon's suitcase, with Odie, Jon's spirited but mute pet dog, also tagging along. Through a fortuitous twist of plot contrivances, Garfield winds up trading places with his exact look-alike: Prince (voiced by Tim Curry), a singularly spoiled tabby who has inherited a vast fortune and palatial estate.
While Prince slums with commoners Jon and Liz, Garfield enjoys a life of luxury under the dutiful care of Smithee (Ian Abercrombie), a faithful butler, and Winston (voiced -- terrifically -- by Bob Hoskins), an obsequious bulldog.
Trouble is, that luxurious life may be cut short: The snidely duplicitous Lord Dargis (Billy Connolly), next in line to inherit the estate, is plotting a catastrophic quietus for Prince/Garfield.
With Murray tossing about impudently rude remarks like so much confetti, and Connolly appearing to channel a "Fawlty Towers" era John Cleese in his verbal and physical tomfoolery, "A Tail of Two Kitties" remains sufficiently comical to captivate auds of all ages. (The funniest bit for movie buffs: An inspired allusion to the Groucho/Harpo mirror scene in "Duck Soup.") Hoskins adds to the fun as a gruff-spoken straight man -- or, more precisely, straight dog -- and there are similarly deft vocal performances by such notables as Curry, Richard E. Grant, Rhys Ifans and (perfectly cast as an intimidating but dim-witted attack dog) Vinnie Jones.
Helmer Tim Hill ("Muppets From Space") maintains a suitably zippy pace, even during stretches of exposition, and achieves an uproarious level of lunacy while Garfield, reveling in the good life, offers his own version of "Movin' on Up" (aka TV's "The Jeffersons" theme song).
Tech values are exceptional across the board. Best of all, Rhythm & Hues f/x wizards surpass their work on the previous pic with an even more animated Garfield.
