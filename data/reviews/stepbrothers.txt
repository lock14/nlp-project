Will Ferrell's newest is a lot like Will Ferrell's oldest, which is to say it feels like an old-school (no pun intended) Saturday Night Live
 skit amped up on a heaping helping of sugar-infused Count Suckula breakfast meth. It's all over the place, and it will make you laugh when you least expect it, but maybe not so much when you do. Ferrell's career thus far has been downright stratospheric in its yet-to-apogee arc. Gems like Elf
 and the genuinely affecting Stranger Than Fiction
 have expanded on his clueless man-child schtick much in the mold of former SNL
 cohort Adam Sandler. But whereas the latter tends too often to wander into the quagmire of oozy sentimentalism, Ferrell apparently has been letting story and gag ideas drip osmotically into his nicely warped brain pan via some sort of surrealistic pillow (so much so that he's now a prime � scratch that, the only
 � candidate to host my dream game show Who's Your Dada?
). There's a thin blah line between childlike and childish, and Ferrell has permanently blurred that little bastard. It's so blurry in Step Brothers
, however, that it keeps you off balance, stuck waiting for the next scrotal joke or explosive display of Ferrell's freshly struck but clich� freak-out moment, which can feel like a chore. Step Brothers
 arrives with assorted choice crew members from Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
 and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
 in place, including writer/director McKay, cinematographer Oliver Wood, and current comedy godhead, producer Judd Apatow. Ferrell and Reilly play Brennan and Dale, slacker layabouts with the hypercompetitive temperaments of 12-year-old bully-magnets who reluctantly become best stepbrothers forever when Brennan's mom (Steenburgen) marries Dale's dad (Jenkins). Hilarity ensues, obstacles are overcome, and life lessons of the socially inept variety bubble up all over the place like magic mushrooms after a rainstorm. (Come to think of it, Step Brothers
 may well double as a religious experience for those inclined to arrive in an altered state of mind.) But Ferrell and Reilly's infantilism grows wearying for those of us who've had our fill of dick jokes and child-men run amok. Step Brothers
 has comic fuel to burn, some of it unashamedly non sequitur and stupid-brilliant, but it still feels like a post-Talladega
 flameout.


A clarification is in order. Despite the movie's R rating, the trailers for "Step Brothers" make it look like fun for more or less the entire family, what with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly pouting and sissy-fighting and building a bunk bed that collapses in on itself like an end-stage dark star.
What the ads don't show you is Reilly crowing about his "chest pubes" and "bush 'fro," f-bombs detonated every five seconds, and - la piece de anatomical resistance - Ferrell rubbing his testicles all over Reilly's prized drum kit. I'm assuming - actually I'm praying - that stunt testicles were involved, but still. Take the kids at your peril.
Mismarketing aside, "Step Brothers" is crudely funny, which means that sometimes it's crudely hilarious and more often it's just crude. The movie, directed by Ferrell's "Funny or Die" web partner Adam McKay and written by him with the stars, has one joke that it beats into the ground: 40-year-old men acting like petulant 9-year-olds. Luckily, Ferrell and Reilly were born with no shame or sense of personal dignity, and they give good tantrum. Remember the old cartoon character Baby Huey, a gigantic infant duck in a diaper? Now picture two of him.
The movie pushes the notion of the "boomerang generation" - kids who graduate, return home, and never, ever leave - until it breaks into slaphappy pieces. Ferrell plays Brennan Huff, a flabby mama's boy; Reilly is his spiritual twin, Dale Doback. Brennan's mom, Nancy (Mary Steenburgen - nice to see her back, but what's with the spray-on tan?), meets Dale's dad, Robert (Richard Jenkins, gleefully working the opposite side of the street from his subtle turn in "The Visitor"), and after bonding over their mutual love of Rob Reiner movies, the two professionals are smitten with late-life lust. Marriage ensues and the "kids" are forced to share a bedroom.
In no universe can I imagine Will Ferrell ever issuing from Steenburgen, but Jenkins and Reilly do make a plausible, craggy-faced father and son. The comedy comes from the patient slow burn of the parents as they try to ignore the explosive belligerence of the boys, which escalates early into a marvelously unhinged front-yard free-for-all. "Today I saw my own son use a bicycle as a weapon," murmurs Nancy in shock and awe.
Eventually the filmmakers have to come up with a plot of some sort, which leads to the appearance of Brennan's successful younger brother Derek (Adam Scott), still a vengeful little sneak under the power suit. Not that you go to a movie like "Step Brothers" for its believability factor, but when Derek's repressed wife (Kathryn Hahn) goes aggressively gaga for Dale, the movie starts sliding off the rails. The "Funny or Die" mantra of quick-hit comedy threatens to die on the vine when extended to feature length.
For every gross-out laugh that works, then, there's one (or three) that just lie there. The best bits rise out of the characters' belief that they're entitled to sit on the couch all day and scratch their crotches while dreaming footie-pajama dreams of fame. Ferrell paints the walls with his usual cross-eyed egotism while Reilly works the corners and gets the bigger guffaws. Occasionally "Step Brothers" delivers with such random drive-by surrealism that you have to laugh, such as the scenes in which Dale and Brennan sleepwalk in tandem, muttering non sequiturs and breaking the crockery.
Actually, the funniest person here just might be Rob Riggle as Derek's corporate second-in-command, a blockheaded bully who yells cryptic team-spirit phonemes with desperate urgency. Elsewhere, "Step Brothers" is content to push the giggles that come from shock. It's an "Oh, no, they didn't" comedy and proud of it: A film made by little boys, starring little boys, and aimed at a culture of little boys of all ages and genders. As such, it will prosper.


Even if Will Ferrell  didn't keep returning to the same comedic topics (sports, the '70s, those odd fuzzy hairballs that dot his potbelly like ants), it would be easy to feel that he's begun to repeat himself, because he revs so many scenes to the exact same pitch of satirical hysteria. In Step Brothers , though, he does something new. He plays a guy even further down the developmental food chain than usual  a 40ish loser who still lives with his mother  and he makes this walking punchline a hostile, cussed mess, with four-letter words shock-popping out of his mouth. Ferrell's Brennan Huff is an overgrown 9-year-old who's always in mid-tantrum, and so is John C. Reilly 's Dale Doback. The two become bunk-bed stepsiblings when their divorced parents (Mary Steenburgen  and Richard Jenkins ) marry, and for a while they're mortal enemies, and then (of course) buddies. At which point they really  get cretinous.
Step Brothers   is a Judd Apatow  production (though directed by Ferrell's regular co-conspirator, Adam McKay ), and it's the closest that the Apatow factory has come to spitting out a dumb-and-dumber high-concept comedy. Yet it's not just an idiot revel: It's nutty, profane, and  caustically heartless. After Dale orders Brennan not to touch his drum set, Brennan doesn't just sit down and play those drums  he...well, touches  them. (Yes, you see it all.) There are other yeasty bits, from Brennan's vile perfectionist of a biological brother (played with amusing Tom Cruise mannerisms by Adam Scott) leading his family in a hyper-controlled chorus of ''Sweet Child O' Mine'' to the job interviews and therapy sessions that Brennan and Dale turn into kamikaze acts of self-sabotage. Step Brothers  is hit-and-miss, but it made me wish that the usual American comedy of how stupid can we get?  had this much rage.

 “Step Brothers,” which was produced by Judd Apatow and his and Will Ferrell’s manager, Jimmy Miller, is nowhere near as good, funny or  polished as “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” the Nascar spoof directed by Adam McKay, which was also produced by Mr. Apatow and Mr. Miller. In that movie, Mr. Ferrell and John C. Reilly play best, not terribly bright, friends. Here, again directed by Mr. McKay, they play not terribly bright slackers turned brothers turned friends, who, after their parents wed, generate a lot of noisy, fitfully amusing, ultimately tiresome havoc. They’re losers that only a mother, an entertainment manager or a gang of self-satisfied comedy insiders  could love.  The idea of two men of around 40 still living with their folks and addicted to nominally juvenile pursuits (toys, pornography, “Star Wars”) seems like grist for the comedy mill or a newspaper trend piece. Mostly, though, it sounds like an idea that was hatched (Mr. McKay?) in waggish reaction to yet another movie review carping about how American comedies are stuck in adolescence. They are, and have been. (“Hey Abbott!”) What’s distinct about the recent cycle of comic juvenilia are its contemporary contours — male camaraderie and self-actualization combined with raunchy guffaws and a preoccupation with women that doesn’t extend to giving them interesting roles — and the ease with which its prominent practitioners are willing to recycle their own laughs to increasingly diminished ends.  So, once again, there is the spectacle and pathos of the sexually stunted immature male, here times two: Brennan (Mr. Ferrell) and Dale (Mr. Reilly). Richard Jenkins plays Dale’s crinkly father, Robert, while Mary Steenburgen, as Brennan’s mother, Nancy, takes the fantasy parent role: she’s saintly, sexy — her relaxed, ready smile telegraphs satisfaction — and endlessly patient. She looks good for a woman who would have had her youngest at about 14. Brennan and his insufferable brother, Derek (Adam Scott), both strong arguments for adolescent birth control, provide some of the crueler sport in “Step Brothers,” evincing mutual hostility that spills over into sadism. It’s hard to reconcile this nice woman with either Brennan or Derek, with his wolfish grin and winner-takes-everything mania.  That few girls and fewer credible women are allowed in the Apatow boys’ club is old news. The only distaff comedy here is provided by the enthusiastic Kathryn Hahn, who as Derek’s pitifully desperate wife, Alice, makes dexterous use of a bathroom urinal. Despite this bit of physical comedy, potty humor doesn’t play a large role in “Step Brothers,” which, like all of Mr. Apatow’s films, is firmly, perhaps self-consciously, rooted in what Freudians term the phallic stage of human development, not the anal. The phallic stage is supposed to be the time when little boys realize that little girls are built differently, which leads them to see their fathers as rivals for their mothers and in turn leads to castration anxiety.  Castration anxiety, at least in this movie, may explain the startling sight of Mr. Ferrell placing his scrotum (or a remarkably persuasive prosthetic) on a drum during one of Brennan and Dale’s full-rattle battles. The penchant for Apatow men letting it all hang out has become a familiar and much-discussed part of the factory formula. Dudes, I understand: You have penises. You’re nice and sort of blobby and you don’t look like Tom Cruise, but you’re real men. Hot-blooded, anatomically correct men, and no one should ever forget it, least of all the ladies that you can’t stop talking dirty about and hope one day to marry because, well, that’s the kind of good, hot-blooded, anatomically correct guys you are.  That’s fine as far as it goes, but recently it hasn’t gone anywhere new. Mr. Ferrell has made a big-screen career riffing on dimwitted innocence, sometimes aided by Mr. McKay’s sitcom styling. Some of their movies have been funny, others less so. Yet successful or not, these characters fit right in with Mr. Apatow’s band of horny and virginal (in spirit if not in flesh) boys and men. In “Step Brothers,” Brennan and Dale almost bring down the house by clinging to a delayed adolescence that makes them seem angry rather than playful and joyous. There’s a shadow of darkness to all their thudding blows and sputtering epithets, but is it the characters who are so fearful of growing up or is it their creators?  “Step Brothers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). R for raunch.

Seesawing from the gleefully stupid to the desperately stupid, �Step Brothers� is an indicator that the Judd Apatow juggernaut -- which often includes star Will Ferrell and helmer Adam McKay (�Anchorman,� �Talladega Nights�) -- has made one too many trips to the well. With Ferrell and John C. Reilly trying to outdo each other in impersonating self-absorbed, middle-aged 6-year-olds, the film is funny at times but lapses into the reflexive vulgarity that seems to be the default mechanism of the Apatow machinery. However, the Sony late-summer entry should enjoy a decent opening.
Despite the comedy, �Step Brothers� has a rather tragic subtext: Two accomplished professionals, Nancy Huff and Robert Doback (a wonderful pairing, Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins) discover the kind of passionate love at first sight that�s normally the purview of movie teenagers. They�re wildly attracted to each other, and have a lot in common -- including 40-year-old sons who still live at home.
How did these two nice people raise two cretins? Some questions have no answers. Despite a few promising gestures in the general direction of wit, the comedy quickly becomes an exercise in antics that wouldn�t even qualify as adolescent. The core of the humor in �Step Brothers� -- as it is in many Ferrell vehicles -- is all about a grown man acting juvenile. If Nancy�s son, Brennan (Ferrell), were still going to school, he�d be riding an abbreviated yellow bus.
Likewise, Robert�s son, Dale (Reilly), dropped out of college to join the family business -- despite being told repeatedly by his physician father that Dale would need to be a doctor
 to do so. When Brennan moves into the Doback house and Dale refuses to move the inevitable drum set out of the one spare room, the two are forced to bunk together, becoming antagonists and fellow sleepwalkers. The first time they somnambulate together and trash their parents� house is hilarious -- not so much the second time. And almost everything in �Step Brothers� is done a second time.
Pic boasts an unpredictable element, in that you never know what the two brothers are going to say. (The script is by Ferrell and McKay, but much of what Ferrell and Reilly blurt out seems ad-libbed.) On the other hand, it�s predictable in the way it brings two enemies together -- mutual hatred of Brennan�s overachieving, insufferable younger brother Derek (Adam Scott) plays a part -- and redeems them as semi-solid citizens. 
To be fair, the unrelenting imbecility of Dale and Brennan generates a certain affection. There�s something going on in society that has to explain the popularity (and proliferation) of movies in which men play boys, such as Apatow productions �Knocked Up� and �Superbad.� There�s probably some deep answer to all this, but don�t ask Dale or Brennan. One will look at you blankly. The other will make armpit farts. 


I haven't seen much at the movies in the past two years that has given me as much unbridled comic pleasure as the sight of Will Ferrell  as the win-at-any-cost NASCAR  driver Ricky Bobby , calling on Jesus, Tom Cruise , and Oprah Winfrey  to put out the psychosomatic flames engulfing his body in director Adam McKay 's 2006 Talladega Nights . Until, that is, I saw Ferrell's Brennan Huffa 39-year-old, live-at-home mama's boy with dreams of a professional singing careerbelt out a heartfelt rendition of Bonnie Raitt 's "Something to Talk About" midway through the new Ferrell-McKay collaboration, Step Brothers .
In terms of show-stopping musical interludes, that one turns out to be but a prelude to the scene where Brennan and his 40-year-old stepbrother, Dale Doback  (John C. Reilly ), take to the stage and perform their cover of Andrea Bocelli 's "Por Ti Volaré." Complete with an extended drum solo. During an important networking event for a corporate helicopter-rental company. I could attempt to describe how, in the course of 90-odd minutes, Step Brothers  manages to go from point A to point B, but that would be about as useless as trying to explain how Alice managed to pass through the looking glass.
McKay and Ferrell, both Saturday Night Live   alumni whose first big-screen collaboration was the 2004 TV-news parody Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  , relish working on an absurdist high wire, and the whole point of their movies isn't how any one scene relates to another, but rather how much they can chip away at the logic that holds most ordinary movies together without causing the audience to revolt. The most inspired/quotable moments in their workI'm thinking of Anchorman's rival-anchorman rumble and impromptu jazz-flute solo, or the TV commercial that suddenly appears in the middle of Talladega Nights ' checkered-flag climaxare exercises in a kind of virtuoso lunacy where anything goes and nothing is sacred. In the specific case of Step Brothers , this means not one but two scenes of violent physical confrontation between Brennan and Dale and a pack of unruly pre-teen playground bullies. If the thought of that doesn't at least bring a smile to your face, this is definitely not the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you've always secretly wanted to see a woman making industrious use of a urinal, you've come to the right place.
Step Brothers , which Ferrell and McKay co-wrote after conceiving the basic premise together with Reilly, doesn't offer much in the way of explanation as to why its newly minted step-siblings, brought together under one roof after the union of their single parents (Richard Jenkins  and Mary Steenburgen ), have never left the nest or held a steady jobor, more to the point, why they seem to have stopped developing emotionally somewhere around the age of 12. But Ferrell and Reilly are quite a sight in their '80s-era T-shirts and too-short shorts, jerking off (in Ferrell's case) to a TV exercise infomercial or ruminating (in Reilly's) on what it means to be a man: "We like to shit with the door open, talk about pussy, and go on riverboat gambling trips." This is well-traveled terrain for Ferrell, who has been cast as varying degrees of man-child in the likes of Old School, Elf , and Wedding Crashers . But here, he and Reilly aren't playing characters so much as they are personifying the ids of all those American males who either never learned to put away childish things, or did and wished they hadn't. Besides, if adulthood means turning into Brennan's asshole alpha-male brother (played to preening, carb-free perfection by Tom Cruise look-alike Adam Scott ), who wants to relegate that rubber Chewbacca  mask to the dark recesses of some closet in the first place?
Not to wax too serious here (since this is, after all, a movie in which two nearly middle-aged men beat each other over the heads with blunt instruments on their front lawn), but ticking away just beneath Step Brothers ' freely associative surface is a fairly astute commentary on how we define such abstract concepts as "growing up" and "making something of yourself," whether it's a wife and 2.5 kids, a six-pack of rock-hard abs, or a seven-figure bank account. Does that make Step Brothers  terminally juvenile or borderline profounda movie for the masses or a stealthy mockery of them? It's par for the course in Ferrell and McKay's comic universe that just as we seem poised to figure it all out, we receive a freshly made whipped-cream pie to the face. Only, instead of whipped cream, it's avocado. Andwait a secondit's not even a pie.
