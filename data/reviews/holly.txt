There has been one great humanist drama about the evils of sex trafficking  Lukas Moodysson's Lilya 4-Ever   but audiences steered clear of it, so why would they now show up for Holly , a dawdling, myopic drama about an American drifter (Ron Livingston) in Cambodia who tries to save a 12-year-old virgin (Thuy Nguyen) sold into prostitution by her family? The film sees the naïvetéof its hero's quest, but not its creepy narcissism: His fixation on singling out one pretty girl to rescue is so arbitrary, it becomes the ''saintly'' offshoot of Western entitlement.

 There’s a riveting story lurking inside “Holly,” a documentary-fiction hybrid about sex trafficking in Cambodia. It’s just not the one the filmmakers want to tell.  One of three films of the K11 Project (named for Phnom Penh’s red-light district and designed to raise awareness of child prostitution), “Holly” continually douses its drama with the cold water of education. In Patrick (Ron Livingston), a numb American expat and smuggler, the film has a fascinating protagonist: a man without country or comfort. Yet when he becomes improbably obsessed with rescuing a 12-year-old Vietnamese virgin (Thuy Nguyen) from the clutches of traffickers, what could have been a gripping study of emotional resurrection devolves into a blurred odyssey of white guilt.  Shot on location in the brothels and alleys of Phnom Penh, “Holly” has a grubby authenticity that fails to compensate for slack plotting and a monotonous tone. Udo Kier is dependably sleazy in the thankless role of an unrepentant pedophile, while the great Virginie Ledoyen is wasted as a human-rights worker whose only task is to remind us of the facts and figures of the under-age sex trade.  Countering the clumsy cross-pollination of drama and philanthropy, Mr. Livingston performs with increasing intensity and motivational ambivalence. In his hands Patrick is an irretrievably lost soul, as confused by his savior impulse as its beneficiary is.    “Holly” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is on-camera solicitation and off-camera acceptance.

A ne'er-do-well American drifter tries to save a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl sold as a Phnom Penh prostitute in capable social issue pic "Holly." Though treading a firm, clear-eyed line between education and exploitation, the well-acted and technically proficient drama -- too chaste to scandalize, too dark for general audiences -- works as a mobilizing tool for its cause, but is iffy for all save specialized playdates and ancillary biz.
A card shark going from scheme to scheme in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, American hustler Patrick (Ron Livingston) is enlisted by cynical, Bangkok-based crime boss Freddie (Chris Penn, in one of his last performances) to move stolen artifacts across the border. The job's barely underway when Patrick's motorcycle breaks down in the notorious K11 red light village. Stuck there overnight, he's educated on the nature of the place by dissolute attorney Claus (Udo Kier), who summarizes Man's basic urges by explaining that in the company of the brothel's women, "I never felt so close to heaven."
Patrick's revulsion turns to idealism when he befriends 12-year-old Holly (newcomer Thuy Nguyen), sold by her Vietnamese family into the sex trade and highly prized for her intact virginity. He discovers a clever, stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her -- though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet.
But between Holly's instinctual contrariness and Patrick's blatant violation of the unwritten rules of organized vice, the deck's stacked against them. As a rudderless cad transformed by a righteous indignation he didn't know he possessed, Livingston's increasingly anguished perf reps the pic's heart and soul.
Newcomer Thuy Nguyen, only 14 during production, holds her own with natural aplomb. Penn and Kier provide dependably pungent support, though French star Virginie Ledoyen is underutilized in a sparse part that requires her to pop up at key moments to recite the heartbreakingly bleak statistics of child prostitution in the region.
Nevertheless, credit debuting helmer Guy Moshe for not only marshaling these disparate acting styles into a cohesive whole, but in laying out the fundamental contradictions of relief efforts -- to save Holly, Patrick must buy her, thus supporting the bad guys -- in a film that never stoops to sensationalism or skin to make its heartfelt points.
Tech package is handsome, led by Yaron Orbach's crisp widescreen lensing and Ton-that Tiet's atmospheric score. Co-producer and co-writer Guy Jacobson is a New York lawyer who formed the K11 Project, a charitable foundation, after being propositioned by young girls during a 2002 trip to Phnom Penh. Pic is the first of three on their announced slate, to be followed by docus "The Virgin Harvest," on the issue of child trafficking, and "The K11 Journey," chronicling the filmmakers' adventures. Per Moshe, Penn completed last ADR work six months prior to his January 2006 death.

Shot concurrently with a "raising awareness" documentary on child prostitution in Southeast Asia  (by the tellingly named Priority Films), Holly  snatches images out of soiled Cambodian red-light districts, slips figures on sex trafficking into its screenplay, and numbers a reformer heroine and unrepentant pederast evildoer among its cast of characters. The titular Holly (Thuy Nguyen ) is an abandoned preadolescent Vietnamese with her virginity up on the auction block; Patrick (Ron Livingston ), the Westerner's entrée into her universe, is an unmoored American expat with neither past nor future who suddenly grabs onto the idea of saving her. Livingston initially seems unable to shoulder his share of the moviehis pale, undistinguished handsomeness suggests something undercooked, and as a boozy card sharper, he doesn't exude enough attritionbut shades of ambiguity gradually suggest depths beneath his blankness. And though the storytelling is haphazard, artistry often transcends mere good intentions. Director Guy Moshe  scavenges color from the torn fringes of Phnom Penh , and the composer Tôn-Thât Tiêt provides a spare score, laying bleary sadness over the art-house muckracking.
