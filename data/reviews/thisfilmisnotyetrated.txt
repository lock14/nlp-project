         Since 1968, when the MPAA ratings system was created as a successor to the more censorious Hays Code, the Motion Picture Assn. of America has wielded enormous power over movies. Foreign, art and independent films, which can be stopped in their tracks by the dread NC-17 rating, have been particularly vulnerable to the board's mercurial decisions.
 
 The inherent hypocrisy a system that routinely restricts films containing naturalistic sex scenes while approving films containing extreme or "cartoonish" violence, especially violence against women, for teen and young adult consumption, has long been apparent to most.
 


         






    But as is suggested in Kirby Dick's documentary, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated," the MPAA is a lobbying organization for the entertainment industry, and as Theresa Webb, a UCLA researcher who has cowritten studies on violence in movies, points out, "violence sells, especially to their target demographic," even though "it's their target demographic that's most at risk for violence."
 
 Webb is among about a dozen writers, filmmakers, lawyers, critics, former MPAA raters (the only two to break their silence since the organization's inception) and industry professionals interviewed in the movie, an impassioned piece of activist filmmaking that's as persuasive and entertaining as it is disturbing.
 
 The suggestion is that film censorship is alive and well, if adorably dressed in sheep's clothing, and the film makes a strong — if occasionally bratty — case for change. Under the old system overseen by former U.S. Postmaster Will Hays, who was hired by the studios to keep the government's nose out of Hollywood's business, studios were required to submit scripts for approval. Under the new system, implemented to, among other things, create a single set of voluntary guidelines to replace far-flung local censorship boards such as the ones in Boston, Dallas and other cities, filmmakers are presumably free to make movies as they see fit. They submit the finished product to the board for a rating they may choose not to accept.
 
 Actually, the process is not so benign. The difference between an NC-17 and an R can mean a difference of millions of dollars in revenue, essentially dooming a movie's prospects. Filmmakers are at the mercy of the board, made up of mysterious "parents," which does not make specific editing recommendations (that would be censorship) nor adhere to precedent but forces filmmakers to scour their films (and their consciences?) for potentially offending material.
 
 Chronicling the organization, whose founder and longtime head, Jack Valenti, has been instrumental in passing draconian anti-piracy laws, Dick, whose previous films include "Twist of Faith" and "Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist," delves with hilarious difficulty into the MPAA's mysterious methods, which the film demonstrates to be arbitrary, tendentious and Kafkaesque in their dark absurdism. Mary Harron, who directed "American Psycho," assumed her NC-17 was for her movie's brutal chain-saw scene or perhaps its equally gory ax murder. It turns out the offending scene was the one in which Christian Bale gets it on with two hookers — and that was problematic mostly because of the sexual position. Jamie Babbit, who directed the lesbian-themed teen comedy "But I'm a Cheerleader," discovered that Jason Biggs violating a pastry in "American Pie" got an R, but Natasha Lyonne pleasuring herself (while thinking of a girl) got an NC-17. "Boys Don't Cry" earned the scarlet rating not for the rape of Hilary Swank's character but the extended orgasm of Chloë Sevigny's.
 
 If the subject seems, at first glance, to be of interest mainly to filmmakers, it quickly becomes clear that the issue at hand has larger implications. Packed with revealing interviews with subjects including directors Harron, Kimberly Peirce, John Waters, Matt Stone and Kevin Smith and punctuated with punch-packing nuggets of graphic information, the film is organized like a mystery in which Dick hires a private investigator to discover the identities of the raters as well as their parental status. The results are at once surprising and not. Eventually, he submits the film for a rating. Not surprisingly, it receives an NC-17, which the filmmakers then appeal, leading to a surreal review process.
 
 Clearly, Dick is on a crusade — and as such the film occasionally dips into mean-spiritedness, mocking the head of the ratings board in caricature and capturing other raters in unflattering shots. But the skewering tone seems only fitting in dealing with an organization that purports to work for the public but doesn't deign to answer to it. As singular as the MPAA's methods are, its ideology will be familiar to anyone who has ever felt bullied by the mythical "average American parent," whose prudery seems matched only by tolerance for gore and whose corporate-sanctioned "values" exert insidious power over public opinion and to some extent determine what the public is allowed to see.
 
 What "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" ultimately reveals is what has come to stand for morality; a morality divested of all reason and humanity, speciously reduced literally to counting hip thrusts and obscenities. Dick and his subjects shed light on a group that is comfortable with violence as long as its consequences are never shown, considers even mild depictions of consensual homosexual sex more threatening than nonconsensual heterosexual sex, and a horror scene in which a woman's fake breast is cut out less damaging than a glimpse of pubic hair in a love scene.
 
 After losing the appeal of its NC-17, Dick opted to release "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" unrated. I don't know what that means for under-17-year-olds interested in seeing it, but it sure would make for an instructive high school field trip.

This Film Is Not Yet Rated , Kirby Dick's cunningly outraged documentary about the Motion Picture Association of America and its infamous, dogged ratings board, is a movie that might just shake up the world of movies. People have been complaining about the MPAA for so long, and the gripes are by now so familiar  the system is arbitrary! Sex is judged more harshly than violence! The stigma of the X rating was never resolved by NC-17!  that it can seem a little like grousing about dorm food or campaign finance law. There may be good reasons to object to the status quo, but that doesn't mean that anyone expects anything to change.
Yet This Film Is Not Yet Rated  has a bright, dishy spirit, an eagerness to provoke of the very sort that the MPAA has always tried to put in its place. Filmmakers like Kimberly Peirce, John Waters, Mary Harron, Kevin Smith, and Atom Egoyan share their inside-the-star-chamber horror stories about the relatively unsensational scenes (a lengthy female orgasm in Boys Don't Cry ; a mention of the word ''felching'' in A Dirty Shame ) that resulted in their films being threatened with the box office oblivion that is NC-17. We're made privy to the ratings board's obsession with pelvis thrusts, as well as details of its hypocritical double standards  the preferential treatment given to studio over independent films, and to straight over gay sex. Matt Stone, of the South Park  duo, is quite amusing  recalling his experiences with the indie midnight movie Orgazmo  versus the big-studio Team America: World Police , which was submitted with a great deal more sick puppet sex than the filmmakers ever intended to use (so that the board could pat itself on the back for nixing something naughty).
The liveliest gambit in This Film Is Not Yet Rated  was Dick's decision to hire a private detective to expose the identities of the ratings board members. Yanking these professional fuddy-duddies out of the shadows, Michael Moore-style, turns out to be just the hot poker this debate needed. As Dick and his investigator, Becky Altringer, who's sort of like Ann B. Davis with attitude, sit in a car in downtown Los Angeles, watching the board members drive out of the MPAA's slightly sinister mini-mall complex, with its tinted windows and security guard, the movie develops the cheekiness of a put-on conspiracy thriller. With a hidden camera, Dick, in a restaurant, photographs veteran rater Joann Yatabe, a 61-year-old mother of grown children who stares at him with her Imelda Marcos scowl. Yes, she has just been ambushed, but that pinched, joyless face speaks volumes. It's the face of a punisher, and it becomes the film's emblem of how the ratings board turned from a defensible watchdog into an executioner of art.
In 1968, when the MPAA's ratings system was created by Jack Valenti as a more enlightened successor to the Production Code, Hollywood films were just starting to grow violent, dangerous, and erotically explicit, and the groundbreaking ones, like Bonnie and Clyde  and Rosemary's Baby , were disturbing to just about everyone  even liberal film critics. The ratings board was conceived as a buffer for children, but also as a force to ward off government regulation, and that, more or less, is how it worked. So what changed? In the '80s and '90s, pop culture became more extreme (slasher flicks, porn on demand, gangsta rap, Basic Instinct ), yet Hollywood, in tandem, grew more homogenized, less enamored of raciness for the sake of creativity. The key point I'd criticize This Film Is Not Yet Rated  for failing to explore is the way that the gradually increasing puritanism of the MPAA now serves the consumerist priorities of a PG-13-centric Hollywood. If everything is blander, then in theory it becomes more marketable. Which is certainly why the industry has winked at the board's transformation into a vehicle of censorship.
There, I finally said it. The C-word! But does it truly apply? The ratings board's chosen mission is to protect children. That it undoubtedly does. Yet over the years, as This Film  stingingly captures, too many filmmakers of too much ambition have had to compromise or destroy too much of their work to now consider this organization the safeguard of an open society. As the raters sit in their screening rooms, in dour anonymity (at least until now), toting up the bad words and the body parts, timing orgasms, turning the very force of their reactions into a strike against the movies they're watching, they have become bureaucrats of oppression, starkly out of touch with their era. To save the children, this agency of white-rubber-glove lab technicians now treats adults the way the rest of Hollywood does, as if too many movies made in freedom could kill them.

   If you’re a regular reader of movie reviews in this newspaper, you’ve no doubt noticed that most of them end with a brief italic note, written by the critic, explaining (and occasionally mocking) the film’s rating. For some readers, this is the most important part of the review, and for this critic it is often the hardest to write. The little boxes that appear at the bottom of the print advertisements are sometimes helpful — we all know nudity or drug use when we see it — but they can also be mystifying. What is “intense adventure violence”? Are “thematic elements” harmful to children? When the box says “some language,” just how much language does it mean? And which language? Would a movie with no language be less dangerous?  “This Film Is Not Yet Rated,” a feisty, intellectually engaging new documentary by Kirby Dick (“Sick,” “Derrida,” “Twist of Faith”) does not so much answer these questions as explore just why they are so difficult to answer. The Motion Picture Association of America, which devised the current rating system and administers it, can be a remarkably secretive organization. Founded by the major Hollywood studios to head off the threat of government censorship and run for most of its history by Jack Valenti, a former staff member in Lyndon B. Johnson’s White House, the association often seems more arbitrary and less transparent in its workings than any federal agency this side of the C.I.A.  To find out who serves on the ratings board and what criteria they use, Mr. Dick hires private detectives, who park outside its nondescript offices in the Encino section of Los Angeles, scribbling down license plate numbers and taking pictures of employees on their lunch breaks. Mr. Dick even rummages through trash bags and discovers important, if puzzling, clues about why “Memoirs of a Geisha” qualified for a PG-13.  These whodunit elements are interspersed with more conventional documentary material: interviews with filmmakers and scholars, clips from movies that have run into trouble with the board, and occasional sound bites from the irrepressible Mr. Valenti, who tells us that the folks who hand out the ratings are “neither gods nor fools.” That narrows it down a bit, though not enough for Mr. Dick, who uncovers some curious inconsistencies in the association’s accounts of its procedures. Do the clergymen who sit in on appeals board meetings — along with representatives of theater chains and film sales companies — have a vote or not? No clear answer is forthcoming. Does the ratings board take a harder line on sex than on violence? On gay sex than on straight?    The evidence Mr. Dick gathers and the testimony of directors like Kimberly Peirce (“Boys Don’t Cry”) and Matt Stone (“South Park”) paint the Motion Picture Association as an outpost of prudishness and repression. (Bingham Ray, former president of United Artists, goes further, describing it as “fascist.”) The record of its recent decisions suggests a special squeamishness about depictions of female sexual pleasure and a picayune fastidiousness about certain body parts. A glimpse of Maria Bello’s pubic hair, for instance, threatened to doom “The Cooler” to an NC-17. But then again, “A Dirty Shame,” John Waters’s 2004 film, received the same rating just for talking about certain outré practices while showing almost no skin at all. (When Mr. Dick submitted a cut of this film, it was slapped with an NC-17, an unsurprising outcome that led to some hilarious, Kafkaesque telephone conversations between him and Joan Graves, the chairwoman of the ratings board. IFC Films, which is not owned by a major studio and therefore not required to submit its releases to the association, is distributing the film without a rating.)  These decisions have commercial as well as artistic consequences, since some of the biggest theater chains, retail stores and video outlets avoid the NC-17 rating as a matter of policy. Filmmakers who want their movies to be seen — and who often need to fulfill contracts requiring that they deliver a film with a certain rating — are thus compelled to cut their films to the association’s standards, a process that often involves guessing just what those standards are.  Mr. Dick, unabashedly on the side of the filmmakers, is particularly concerned with art films — movies obviously intended for grown-up viewing that are nonetheless subjected to a regime ostensibly designed to protect children. But — at the risk of sounding like Maude Flanders — what about the children? How are parents supposed to navigate the flood tide of popular culture that engulfs their kids at younger and younger ages? Does this ratings system help? Could it be improved?  Mr. Dick’s lack of interest in these questions is frustrating, and the narrow scope of “This Film Is Not Yet Rated” makes it more of a culture-war broadside than a nuanced work of cultural inquiry. It is, nonetheless, an engaging and entertaining movie, one that tries to illuminate an aspect of moviemaking — and moviegoing — that is deliberately left in the dark.

"This Film Is Not Yet Rated" constitutes a ballsy expose of the notoriously secretive methods of the Motion Picture Assn. of America's ratings board; the guerrilla enterprise takes, and provokes, gleeful fun at outing the heretofore anonymous panel that decides who can see what and how far filmmakers can go with sex and violence. And yet, for all the important issues raised and pissed-off feelings unleashed, Kirby Dick's latest confrontational doc never really addresses why aspects of the ratings don't work, proposes concrete improvements or compares the system to those in other countries. Still, pic's bracing, hilarious and out-there elements make it a landmark, which will translate into heavy attention in all situations, including fests and theatrical release (rights are available), on through planned fall IFC cable broadcast.

And yet, for all the important issues raised and pissed-off feelings unleashed, Kirby Dick's latest confrontational doc never really addresses why aspects of the ratings don't work, proposes concrete improvements or compares the system to those in other countries. Still, pic's bracing, hilarious and out-there elements make it a landmark, which will translate into heavy attention in all situations, including fests and theatrical release (rights are available), on through planned fall IFC cable broadcast.

Driving the film is Dick's zealous quest to do what's never been done before: To identify the individuals who pass judgment on most American movies' suitability for different age groups. To this end, he hires a private investigator, the jovially engaging Becky Altringer, who works with her partner Cheryl and latter's daughter Lindsey.
This team sets up surveillance outside the MPAA's HQ on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, Calif., observing cars as they come and go, trying to read license plates and following workers to lunch to eavesdrop. When they get a glimpse of the staff roster hanging in a vacant guard station, the names start to fall into place. What this actually accomplishes is highly debatable, but the score produces an undeniable exhilaration.
While this is going on, Dick serves up a lively, funny and patchy survey of MPAA ratings hijinx over the years, one bolstered by clever animation and abundant anecdotes offered by filmmakers who have felt screwed over by the ratings system instituted in 1968.
"Boys Don't Cry" helmer Kimberly Peirce voices the commonly held charges that the board is lenient toward violence (main suspected reason: its appeal to the huge young male audience) and uptight about sex in general and female gratification in particular (the long orgasm scene with Jane Fonda in "Coming Home," which was rated R, goes way beyond what is shown to be permissible with the same rating today).
"The Cooler" director Wayne Kramer and thesp Maria Bello go off about how a glimpse of the latter's pubic hair in a sex scene earned the pic an NC-17, and Atom Egoyan shows the shot that got him the same rating for "Where the Truth Lies." Mary Harron explains the MPAA had no problem with chainsaw killing in "American Psycho" but couldn't abide a three-way sex scene. Michael Tucker, director of Iraq war docu "Gunner Palace," asks, "How do you rate reality?," and Matt Stone discusses how he and Trey Parker deliberately created NC-17 moments in their "Team America" puppet sex scene in hopes that the rest of it would be approved for an R.
Clever montages and cutting send up the MPAA's strictures about number of thrusts and distance from the camera in coupling scenes, demonstrate how the board seems much more comfortable with cartoon-like presentations of sex (like the ultra-leniently R-rated insanity of "Scary Movie") than with anything that seems tender or real, trap longtime MPAA topper Jack Valenti in multiple misrepresentations and amply show gross inconsistencies in the application of standards.
In the latter regard, the most startling revelations come from MPAA attorney Greg Goeckner, repped here in a vocal re-creation from a transcribed phone conversation with Dick prior to latter's appearance to appeal an NC-17 on "This Film Is Not Yet Rated." Goeckner informs the filmmaker he will not be told the identities of his judges, and will not be allowed to cite any precedents from previous films in his own defense.
What's at issue in all this is the ratings system's lack of transparency, of clear stated rules that are equally applied.
The need for improvement is undeniable. What's uncertain is how revealing the names and faces of the universally middle-aged, middle-class and average-looking parents who comprise the ratings board changes anything; only a moment's reflection causes one to shudder at how board members, were they prominently known, would be subject to endless lobbying, attempts at influence and even intimidation by distributors and filmmakers.
At pic's end, Dick manages to identify all the members of the ratings' appeals board; unlike the regular panel, this larger group is shown to consist mostly of exhibitors, along with a sprinkling of other industry reps (two clergy members also have a regular role).
Fine and well, except that Dick misses the cue to discuss the dominant role exhibition has played in preventing the NC-17 rating from working, along with such giant retailers as Blockbuster and Wal-Mart, as well as newspapers. Also unmentioned is how the unrated DVD now reps a massively popular market of its own.
Instead of offering constructive criticism, the film�s attack mode essentially encourages the impulse to just torpedo the MPAA. Basically ignored is the likelihood that, if the MPAA dropped out of the game, every state -- and many cities -- would decide to make its own censorship decisions, and religious and extremist orgs would press their own demands, just like 40 years ago.
A thoughtful assessment of the ratings would include a look at how other countries do the same thing. Politically oriented docus these days love to excoriate the United States while conveniently avoiding looking through other societies' dirty laundry.
As outrageous, and sometimes outrage-inspiring, entertainment, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" is a blast. As a fair-minded look at the MPAA, it's incomplete and rather off-balance.

Why we choose to watch the movies we watch is strictly personal, a matter of taste mediated by finance and geography. The nature of what we can watch is something else. As explicated by Kirby Dick 's snappy exposé This Film Is Not Yet Rated , it's a matter of public concern.
Dick (whose previous docs include Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate ; Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan , Supermasochist; and the Oscar-nominated Twist of Faith ) has an interest in outré content that This Film Is Not Yet Rated  pushes further into the social sphere. Establishing that the American movie industry has always been subject to political regulation, Dick notes the 1920s importation of Republican politician Will Hays  to police Hollywood  and the postwar witch hunt conducted by the FBI  and House Un-American Activities Committee , to focus on the current rating system implemented in the late '60s by D.C. insider and former Motion Picture Association of America  honcho Jack Valenti .
The rating system is secret and the ratersidentified by Valenti only as "parents"are sworn to secrecy. Dick studies the circumstantial evidence and interviews expert witnesses, including filmmakers Kevin Smith , John Waters , and Kimberly Peirce  (who hasn't completed another film in the seven years since her re-edited-for-R Boys Don't Cry ). His conclusion: The scarlet NC-17 is, as an economic kiss of death, reserved largely for independents. Also, so far as the MPAA is concerned, the representation of female pleasure is far worse than the depiction of violenceparticularly violence against women.
Any investigation into Hollywood inevitably mutates into a noir. Dick hires an affably hard-boiled private eye to discover who the raters are and how they operate. Assisted by her teenage daughter, she stakes out the MPAA's heavily secured Hollywood headquarters and takes license numbers. Selective garbology yields a rating sheet for Memoirs of a Geisha.  Although MPAA's anonymous minions dutifully tally the pelvic thrusts in a sex scene or total instances of the word fuck , their guidelines are secret; they pride themselves on not telling filmmakers what changes would be necessary to secure a PG or R. (They're not censors after all.) Mary Harron  recalls that although American Psycho  was rated NC-17 for "tone," she ultimately deduced that, for all the movie's violence, the most MPAA-offensive scene was a lighthearted threesome.
Inevitably, Dick goes to the interpersonal and submits his filmamply spiced with nudity, expletives, and pelvic thrustingto the MPAA. This ploy enables him to document the arcane process by which, denied a commercial rating, filmmakers can petition for reconsideration. The appeal board includes at least one (nonvoting) member of the clergy but is mainly staffed with industry biggies. Their rules do not allow citation of precedent. Ignorance is enforced; it is forbidden to even refer to any other film. Any such allusion would be, in the literal sense, obscene"not to be shown." And as Dick makes abundantly clear, so is the rating game itself.
