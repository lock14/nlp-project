Stuart Gordon, the mostly under-the-radar director of Re-Animator   , pops back into view with this amusing trifle  a piece of scuzzy tabloid noir. High on drugs, a nurse's assistant (Mena Suvari  , in fetching cornrows) accidentally plows her car into a sad sack (Stephen Rea) who has lost his job and then his home. He winds up wedged through the windshield, bloody but alive, trapped in the jagged glass. She hides him in her garage, and Stuck  unfolds from there, with the grisly, semi-logical, every-man-for-himself twistiness of a lower-rent Blood Simple   .

 There are no supernatural happenings, just people under extreme stress succumbing to their worst instincts, in Stuart Gordon’s grim, expert little thriller “Stuck.” Mr. Gordon has enjoyed a cult following since his 1985 horror hit, “Re-Animator.” And “Stuck,” while not strictly a horror film, is steeped in gore and carries a seam of mocking gallows humor as relentless as that of “Sweeney Todd.”  Set in the same seedy urban environment as Mr. Gordon’s   faithful 2005 screen adaptation of David Mamet’s play “Edmond,” this largely two-character nightmare unfolds in the hellish tenderloin of Providence, R.I., and its outskirts. Tom Bardo (Stephen Rea), like the title character of “Edmond,” is a white-collar victim of downsizing, brutally evicted from his shabby apartment, who finds himself alone in the middle of the night on a park bench. While pushing a shopping cart donated by a friendly homeless man on the way to a shelter, he is struck by a car. Tossed onto the hood, Tom crashes through the windshield, where he remains stuck and near death.  The driver, Brandi (Mena Suvari), a hard-working  nursing home employee,  is high on booze and pills after a hellish day at work and a night of clubbing. Seeing her future in jeopardy, Brandi panics, drives home and locks the car in her garage, leaving the barely conscious Tom still lodged in the windshield while she decides what to do.  Based on a notorious incident in Texas in 2001, “Stuck” is exceptional because its characters feel like real people plunged into a disorienting situation in which they behave like monsters. Brandi, who can’t bear to face what she has done, goes berserk and blames Tom for her troubles. Her smooth-talking boyfriend, Rashid (Russell Hornsby), to whom she turns for help, is a two-timing drug dealer and thug.  John Strysik’s screenplay, based on a story by Mr. Gordon, goes out of its way to portray ordinary people at the mercy of sadistic bureaucrats who secretly relish the power they wield. A scene in an employment agency where Tom is told, after waiting for hours, that there is no record of him in the computer is enough to make you scream in frustration. Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, playing a snippy supervisor in the nursing home, is a scary contemporary Big Nurse.  Mr. Rea, a wonderful actor, spends the better part of the movie howling and moaning as Tom tries to force himself through the windshield into the front seat and escape. For Ms. Suvari, who since playing a high school vixen in “American Beauty”  has found her niche as a millennial Linda Blair with good taste in sordid material, “Stuck” is the latest small, nasty triumph.  “Stuck” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, gore, nudity and sexual situations.

Inspired by a real-life incident so bizarre it's already been referenced in a "Law & Order" episode, "Stuck" is ingeniously nasty and often shockingly funny as it incrementally worsens a very bad situation, then provides a potent payoff with the forced feeding of just desserts. This darkly comical farce could command an enthusiastic cult during carefully calibrated theatrical rollout, especially if it generates want-to-see buzz in key regions of the blogosphere. But it's difficult to tell whether helmer Stuart Gordon's sardonically edgy pic will reach many mainstream auds before fast-forwarding to homevid.
Working from a crafty script by John Strysik, Gordon establishes a heightened-reality tone of bleak hilarity early on while introing two lead characters: Tom (Stephen Rea), a sad-eyed schlump who has lost his job to downsizing; and Brandi (Mena Suvari), a dedicated retirement-home caregiver who devotes far too much of her downtime to partying, drinking and drugging.
After enduring a long day of frustrations and humiliations --he's kicked out of his apartment, then brushed off by a state employment office clerk -- Tom thinks he's hit rock bottom when he's reduced to spending the night on a park bench. Unfortunately, he winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time just as Brandi puts pedal to the metal.
Brandi is understandably upsetwhen Tom's broken body flies through her windshield. Still, she has sufficient presence of mind to drive home, stow her car in her garage -- even as a semiconscious, sporadically moaning Tom remains stuck in place -- and, come morning, take a cab to work. She's really bummed out by what has happened, but she knows that spilling the beans about her hit-and-run accident might dampen her possible promotion.
So Brandi asks Rashid (Russell Hornsby), her drug-dealing boyfriend, to dispose of the inconvenient body. But there's a complication: The body isn't quite dead. Indeed, the longer he remains trapped in the windshield, the more time Tom has to gather strength for the slow and painful process of escape.
Given Gordon's notoriety as the cult-fave auteur of "Re-Animator" (1985) and "From Beyond" (1986), it shouldn't be surprising that "Stuck" includes a few quease-inducing scenes of messy mayhem and seriocomic suffering. But the pic is more unsettling -- and most hilarious -- when the violence is emotional, not physical, as Brandi gradually reveals the full measure of her sociopathic selfishness.
Gordon and Strysik advance their mordantly outrageous yet perversely logical narrative through the steady accumulation of unlucky breaks, impulsive decisions and ironic twists. Up to a point, auds may actually view the increasingly frantic Brandi as deserving of at least some sympathy. Once that point is past, however, "Stuck" kicks into overdrive, propelled by the giddy exhilaration always ignited when filmmakers more or less announce that all bets are off.
Suvari is fearlessly effective as she charts Brandi's devolution from distraught screw-up to unhinged harpy, making each step in the transformation seem at once unexpected and inevitable. She offers excellent counterpoint to Rea, whose pitch-perfect performance suggests that the best hope for a loser is to be placed in a situation where you have absolutely nothing left to lose. Hornsby earns his own share of laughs by playing tough-talking Rashid as no match for tougher-talking women.
Pic overall has the look and feel of a tawdry B-movie. Whether that's due to budgetary limitations or artistic inspiration, it serves the material well.

In October 2001, a Fort Worth , Texas, nurse's aide named Chante Mallard  struck 37-year-old Gregory Glenn Biggs with her 1997 Chevy Cavalier , lodging him in her windshield; she allowed him to remain there, and he died two hours later despite his desperate pleas for help. It's become the stuff of urban legend—this story of the woman who tried to ditch the body and burn the car to destroy the remnants of her horrific crime before she was sentenced to prison for 50 years. Hell of a true-life tale, which gets the extended remix from Re-Animator 's Stuart Gordon . Stuck  is both darkly comic and disgusting; the name alone reduces the crime to a sick joke. Mena Suvari  plays the Mallard stand-in as mean and empty—she'd rather fuck her boyfriend than help the dying man in her garage. Stephen Rea  is Biggs , more or less; he's older than the real guy, but still a broken-down, jobless mess wandering the streets when he gets tagged, almost begging to be put out of his misery. Gordon, of course, has taken substantial liberties with the story: The filmmaker wants revenge on the perpetrator, something more than just jail time. Still, he's got plenty of nasty laughs for those unwilling to see deeper into the bleak, tragic darkness; every dog finds a bone, turns out—you'll see.
