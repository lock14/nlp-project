In plotting her next career move, it makes sense that Sarah Jessica Parker, late of Sex and the City
, would want to avoid typecasting and steer clear of any flirty, free-spirit types like Carrie Bradshaw, whom she so winningly portrayed for six seasons. But methinks Parker may have tipped too far in the other direction: No one�s going to confuse this latest role � as Meredith, a woman meeting her boyfriend�s family for the first time � with the impish Carrie. One is meant to feel sympathy for Meredith as she is thrown to the den of lions (the title�s Stone family), but sympathy, let alone tolerance, is hard to muster when the character is such a tightwad and insufferable bore for easily the film�s first 40 minutes. (As if you didn�t know there�s a midmovie transformation coming.) But before Meredith can shake loose her pretty bun and, as one character urges her, "let her freak flag fly," first she must meet the family. Kelly (Nelson) and Sybil (Keaton) are pater- and mater-familias, welcoming home for Christmas their many children � deaf son Ben (Giordano), with his universally adored boyfriend in tow; pregnant Susannah (Reaser); the sweetly dopey, pot-smoking Ben (Wilson); and the baby of the family, Amy (McAdams), who gets the best entrance, shlepping out of her Volvo station wagon and swearing to herself as she wrangles an NPR tote and a big basket of laundry (in fact, those few details provide perhaps the strongest character sketch in this overpacked ensemble). And finally, the family�s golden child, Everett (Mulroney), who arrives with smart-suited, strait-laced Meredith on his arm and the intention of securing his grandmother�s wedding ring from Sybil so that he can then secure Meredith as his bride. But the Stones are a fiercely protective, clique-ish clan and none-too-impressed with Meredith, so the subtle sabotage begins, with snarky Amy leading the attack. There is some romantic intrigue, as well: The lingering question of "Do they or don�t they belong together?" is complicated by Ben�s long looks at Meredith and the arrival of Meredith�s little sis (an uncharacteristically blah Danes), casting doe eyes at Everett. But I�m disheartened to report that there�s not a lick of chemistry among the four, no matter how you pair them. The real love affair here is among the Stone family, a sharp and sparky bunch quick to call bullshit on one another, even quicker to smother it with a hug. There�s a lot to like here, including the nonissue of Ben�s deafness (characters often sign as they speak) and the consistent pleasure of the family dynamic. Writer/director Thomas Bezucha (Big Eden)
�s likable film runs the gamut of emotions � hitting tenderness, rage, remorse, and everything in between � but it�s something of a speed trial: There are just too many damn characters, with the best ones taking a backseat to the dullish love quadrangle.

In ''The Family Stone," Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) brings someone new home for the holidays. She's not a he. (The Stones already have a gay son, who, by the way, they adore.) And she's not black. (Been there, doing that: The gay son's partner.) She's Sarah Jessica Parker, playing an uptight white businesswoman named Meredith.
The Stones happen to be one of those upper-middle-class New England clans whose temperament runs toward the bohemian. So, naturally, Diane Keaton is the matriarch, Sybil Stone. Those of you expecting Peter Fonda as dad will have to settle for a perfectly nice Craig T. Nelson as her large puppy of a husband.
The movie is a holiday romantic comedy that wants to put the holiday romantic comedy out of business. Somebody is gravely (and secretly) sick. Food crashes to the floor. And the wrong people are in love. Yet the sweetness is doled out with a pint of vinegar, so the whole experience is not unlike one of those Hallmark Shoebox Greetings cards: Sarcasm leaking from the heart.
The problem is that no one in this liberal nest of turtleneck-wearing idealists thinks Meredith is right for Everett. She can't hug. Her demeanor runs conservative. She yells when she speaks to Thad (Tyrone Giordano), the gay, hearing-impaired son. And she doesn't handle the withering contempt of Amy Stone (Rachel McAdams) nor the flirting from Ben (Luke Wilson), the slacker-stoner Stone. Desperate for moral support, she calls in her more agreeable little sister, Julie (Claire Danes), to be at her side for the holiday. To Meredith's consternation, Julie fits in immediately.
The first half of ''The Family Stone" is several movies happening at once, and they're all simultaneously overwritten and not fleshed out enough. Writer-director Thomas Bezucha is often less a filmmaker and more a shepherd of pratfalls. You're no one in this movie unless you topple over. (This is his second film; his first was a wonderfully corny little romantic comedy called ''Big Eden," which came out in 2000.)
Nonetheless, most of the cast knows how to navigate the chaos. McAdams is an actress I like more with every movie. She's smart and sly. And Keaton knows how to finesse the movie's drama and comedy -- even though she spends the movie wildly overdressed and her hair has a terrible white streak in the front.
But a few of the actors never come around. As the movie goes on, Parker turns luminously alive, drunk and high with the engaging Wilson. Yet Mulroney mumbles to Danes until her otherwise natural performance is locked up in the halting mannerisms of ''Shopgirl."
It's to Mulroney's disadvantage that we find out almost too late why Everett so desperately wants his mother to give him a family heirloom to slip on Meredith's finger. His thinking suggests a psychologically richer movie.
Instead, ''The Family Stone" continues to beat up on poor Meredith, whose crime is that she's too much like Martha Stewart for this household. She's also required to be a little bit bigoted to Thad and his boyfriend, Patrick (Bryan J. White). The price they pay for not being mincing queens is that they have to be billboards for tolerance: We love our deaf, gay son and his black boyfriend, who are about to have a baby! Why can't you?
The urge to be progressive and politically correct short-circuits ''The Family Stone." This is ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" for Air America listeners.

         Hollywood is always making family comedies, but they are rarely about real families: relations who are as difficult as they are wonderful, people who both love and irritate the heck out of each other. Families like "The Family Stone."
 
  A contemporary version of the traditional screwball romantic comedy, "The Family Stone" is a film that's at times as ragged and shaggy as its family unit. But as written and directed by Thomas Bezucha, its offbeat mixture of highly choreographed comic crises and the occasional bite of reality make for an unexpectedly enticing blend.
 


         






    Bezucha, whose debut film was the independent feature "Big Eden," has been helped by a first-rate cast including Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T. Nelson, Luke Wilson and Sarah Jessica Parker in one of her first post-"Sex and the City" parts. Not only is this an especially strong ensemble, but the actors seem pleased with their roles and relaxed with one another. They are, individually and as a group, characters who can't help but be human, with all the irritating, caring, opinionated and irascible impulses that implies. "Family Stone's" main thrust is toward entertainment, toward providing the kinds of reverses and changes of expectation character comedies traditionally deliver.
 
  But the film also wants to remind us that family dynamics can be especially challenging over the holidays, when everyone is nominally trying to be jolly. And it is happy to point out how unpredictable falling in love is, how quixotic a process human attraction can become. It's no surprise that the family name of the genially bohemian New Englanders the film revolves around is Stone. But it's a very particular stone, an engagement ring that has been in the family for generations, that is critical to the plot's unfolding.
 
  The Stones' oldest son, New York businessman Everett (Mulroney), is headed home to the family Christmas with his girlfriend, Meredith Morton (Parker), in tow. The parental Stones have not met the young lady, but based on what they've heard father Kelly (Nelson) and especially mother Sybil (Keaton) are dreading Everett's inevitable request for that ring for Meredith's hand.
 
  Sharing that dread are Everett's siblings, initially presented as a lively, iconoclastic bunch. These include Thad (Ty Giordano), both deaf and gay; married Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser); wacky Ben (Wilson), a Berkeley-based film editor; and vocal Amy (the always engaging McAdams), a feisty troublemaker who always says what's on her mind. Meredith Morton, by contrast, coiled tighter than the hair in her bun, more pulled together than her tailored suits, doesn't have a relaxed bone in her body. Given this cultural clash, so many family members react badly to Meredith that the film's original title was "Hating Her." If "Family Stone" were a more conventional work, its thrust would be how Meredith learns to loosen up and enjoy life. But it's a little trickier here.
 
  For one thing, the film takes pains to show us that though Meredith is a difficult person, she is not a bad one. More than that, the Stones' callous treatment of her begins to present the family in a less than flattering light.
 
  Adding to the complications, a stressed-out Meredith calls out to her younger sister to come share the holiday with her, and when the attractive, empathetic Julie (Claire Danes in long blond hair) shows up, she changes the entire dynamic several ways. "The Family Stone" is not without its problems. Keaton never seems completely comfortable in her role, and the film has the tendency, visible in its giving deaf, gay Ty an African American partner, to push some things too hard.
 
  But Parker, who clearly relishes the opportunity to go through a variety of changes, and the key cast members make up the difference. "The Family Stone" has a gift for keeping its narrative balls moving along smartly. It's not a completely traditional romantic comedy, so we're never sure exactly how things will turn out — which is as close to an unexpected holiday reward as we're likely to get.

Which came first: the national yearning for an idealized Christmas gathering  and I do mean Christmas  in which photogenic, dysfunctional family members reunite in a nonsectarian Christian spirit of tolerance, compassion, and the swapping of perfectly wrapped gifts...or the Hollywood holiday movies that insist this outcome is universally attainable? Another year, another warmedy about the importance of improved parent-child relationships and artisanal sweaters is how I see it, with only the trend-sensitive specifics of dysfunction in doubt.
What's striking and, to my bloodshot eye, welcome about this year's edition, The Family Stone , is the rather chic urbanity with which writer-director Thomas Bezucha serves up the old genre standby. Maybe it's because his background is in product branding and store design that Bezucha's home-for-the-holidays fantasy is more like a beautifully styled cashmere throw draped on an Eames chair than a lumpy granny afghan tossed on a Barcalounger. But somehow, it dramatizes the attractive traps of bohemian-bourgeois aspirations (and snobbism) and, with a light comedic touch, also holds its ground as an old-fashioned and even sweet story about love  and the swapping of perfectly wrapped presents.
Of the five adult children who gather for Christmas at the New England home of their handsome parents Sybil and Kelly Stone (Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson), the oldest, Everett (Dermot Mulroney), is the polished corporate go-getter; Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) is the traditional wife-and-mother; Ben (Luke Wilson) is the SoCal loosey-goosey guy; Amy (Rachel McAdams) is the pretty rebel; and Thad (Ty Giordano) is the deaf one. Also the gay one, hoping to adopt a child with his black boyfriend.
The saving grace for the sophisticated clan in The Family Stone  is that Thad's sensitive-issue grand slam is not the story. Instead, what rattles the Stones is the introduction of Everett's buttoned-down, sleeked-up fiancée, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), whose tightly wound career-exec personality is at odds with the family's own proud sense of liberal outspokenness in general and Sybil's forceful plans for her son's happiness in particular. (The sly title refers as well to the disposition of an heirloom diamond ring.) The very bun on Meredith's head seems to annoy Sybil (and inflame Amy, so proudly unkempt), and Parker has a great time being the anti–Carrie Bradshaw while Keaton-as-matriarch is a particular joy  funny, beautiful, elegant, touching, and at ease with a familiar, get-out-your-hankies holiday subplot.
With the Stones doing a number on her self-confidence, Meredith buses in her sister Julie (Claire Danes) as an ally and that's where the romantic geometry gets fancy. Suffice it to say that at one point, Meredith does let her hair down and Parker gets to put in a performance as endearing as we like from her. How did Bezucha get this glam a cast into this traditional a pie? I don't know  it's a secret Christmas recipe.

 All happy families resemble one another, Tolstoy famously wrote, and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, but Tolstoy didn't know the Stones, who are happy in a Hollywood kind of way and unhappy in a self-help kind of way. This tribe of ravenous cannibals bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate the family's preening self-regard. Its most recent target is Meredith Morton, an executive played by Sarah Jessica Parker, who probably hopes to marry into the clan, little realizing that this will leave no Stone unturned and all aimed straight at her head.  Written and directed by Thomas Bezucha, "The Family Stone" opens inside a crowded department store, with Meredith talking nonstop into a cellphone while her boyfriend, Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney), buys a gift. Meredith steps out of her bubble only long enough to correct Everett's gift choice brusquely and make the salesgirl feel bad. (In some flicks, cellphones are the new cigarettes, a sure sign of incivility.) There are few character types Hollywood loves to hate more than the female business executive, what the movies once called a "career woman." And with her brittle efficiency and tight chignon, Meredith looks precisely like one of those types for whom comeuppance and a more relaxed hairstyle are right around the corner.  That corner and that comeuppance will be revealed inside the studiously tasteful Stone family manse, to which Everett squires Meredith home for the holidays. Located in a picture-perfect New England college town (actually, Madison, N.J.), the house looks more persuasively lived in than many big-studio interiors, perhaps because of all the books crammed onto shelves and piled on night tables. The Stone patriarch, Kelly (Craig T. Nelson), is a professor, and the family's vaguely bookish, boho vibe is reinforced by the Susan Sontag-style splash of white that punctuates the otherwise dark head of his wife, Sybil (Diane Keaton), a woman of multiple moods, if not personalities. If Kelly serves as the family's foundation, Sybil is a lot like the house itself, a warm womb in which each family member can seek refuge.  There is, of course, something irresistible about having a maternal womb of one's own, and not just as a pretext for cheap puns. The hitch here is that Mom is fairly monstrous, and most of her five kids fairly unbearable. The exceptions are Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), who, perhaps because she has her own family, is merely bland, and Ben (Luke Wilson), whose laid-back charm owes much to the actor playing him. Less appealing are the baby Stone, Amy (Rachel McAdams), and Thad (Ty Giordano), who is deaf and about to adopt a child with his partner, Patrick (Brian White). Shrouded in saintliness and as neutered as geldings, Thad and Patrick offer further proof that as far as pop culture representation is concerned, gay men are fine, as long as they're redecorating or straighter than straight.  It takes a while for Sybil's monstrosity to emerge, mainly because the reliably appealing Ms. Keaton, with her fluttering hands and gorgeous smile, radiates such likability. The film doesn't present the character as a monster; this is, after all, a paean to that beloved fiction called the sanctity of the family. More interesting, though, the film is also a clear attempt to bottle the manic energy and generous spirit of madcap classics like George Cukor's wonderful 1938 "Holiday." This partly explains Mr. Bezucha's unfortunate attempts at broad physical comedy (flying casseroles, etc.), which even a dexterous performer like Ms. Parker has trouble with. This actress fares better facing off against Ms. Keaton, whose character carries a dark secret that will be a secret only to those who don't notice the rampaging elephant in the room.  In a better movie, these strong-willed women would be ready-made friends rather than instant combatants. A better movie would also bring Amy, the second most unbearable family member, into a sisterhood, rather than turn her into the resident baddie. (Amy carries a National Public Radio tote bag, a red flag for intolerance, if ever there was one.) Like Meredith and Sybil, Amy is the other putatively difficult woman in this film, a shrew-in-training who spews bile at Meredith as readily as Linda Blair once spewed pea soup. Like Ms. Keaton and Ms. Parker, Ms. McAdams is such an engaging screen presence that she holds your attention and sympathy despite the handicap presented by her character's personality or, rather, sex, which here are one and the same thing.  The female troubles that bedevil "The Family Stone" are by turns exasperating and fascinating. Save for the boring sister, the women are pills, but they're also far more fun to watch than the men, who all are terribly kind and dull, dull, dull. (Ben is by far the most appealing, but he also seems permanently stoned.) The women make "The Family Stone," especially Ms. Parker, whose nimble performance is reason alone to see the film: not since Philippe Petit has anyone walked a tightrope with such finesse - and in high heels, no less. Of course, her character will eventually be added to the Stone pile, and like everyone else in this fairy tale, she will be paired with her ideal mate, as if she were set for Noah's Ark instead of one leaking, creaking vehicle.  "The Family Stone" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The language is lightly spiced.

The culture clash between a high-strung New Yorker and her boyfriend's free-spirited kin yields a smart, tart but mildly undercooked Christmas pudding in "The Family Stone." Writer-director Thomas Bezucha's lovingly mounted ensembler has many heartfelt moments and a keen ear for the rhythms of domestic life, which make the neatly gift-wrapped outcome somewhat disappointing. Delayed from a November opening, producer Michael London's "Sideways" follow-up reps a classy holiday release for Fox that should connect with auds of all ages, though Sarah Jessica Parker's distractingly out-of-sync performance will likely spur mixed reactions.
From its postcard-worthy opening credits, featuring wintry snapshots of a New England country house set to the tune of "Let It Snow," pic frames itself as a homage to that quintessential movie about family, holidays and the inevitability of change, "Meet Me in St. Louis."
But where Vincente Minnelli's 1944 classic spent a whole year with the family Smith, allowing for a beautifully rounded portrait of their resilience in the face of everyday crises, "Stone," which unspools over one dizzyingly hectic holiday, reps a comparatively ungainly blend of screwball comedy, romantic drama and Lifetime weepie. That it plays as well as it does is no small testament to Bezucha's palpable love for his characters.
The one character arguably exempt from that embrace is Meredith Morton (Parker), a chronically uptight Gotham career woman who dreads the prospect of spending Christmas with boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) and his family.
The Stones are her polar opposites -- a loose, slightly wacky bohemian clan, thoroughly accepting of their own quirks but less tolerant of others. The most critical of the bunch is Everett's mom Sybil (Diane Keaton), a cheerfully outsized personality whose hairstyle suggests a more matronly Susan Sontag.
Sybil and husband Kelly (a terrific Craig T. Nelson) have four other kids: gentle Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), married and pregnant with her second child; Ben (Luke Wilson), a droll slacker who dwells comfortably in Everett's shadow; prickly, tomboyish Amy (Rachel McAdams); and Thad (Ty Giordano), who is gay, deaf and completely lovable, and whose partner Patrick (Brian White) is also staying for the holidays.
From the moment she walks in the door, Meredith's stiff, don't-touch-me posture and her habit of saying the wrong thing cause her to be ostracized. Amy lays a series of surprisingly cruel psychological traps that drive Meredith to the local inn, while Sybil refuses to give Everett her blessing -- or his grandmother's ring, the other "stone" of the title -- when he announces his intention to propose to Meredith.
"What I don't understand is what he sees in her," Kelly wonders, and neither Meredith nor the script provides an answer. Meredith's more offensive faux pas border on social retardation and feel out of place coming from a sophisticated Manhattanite.
By contrast, the Stones, for all their eccentricities, essentially can do no wrong, and if they sometimes feel a bit too good to be true, they're pleasurable company regardless. Bezucha tosses the viewer into every conversation headfirst, deploying a rough, at times disorienting visual style that works in rhythm with the layers of overlapping dialogue to deliver a pleasingly antic, semi-improvisational feel.
Helmer also knows exactly when laughter should give way to a lump in the throat, handling an especially sensitive plot point -- which might have landed the film in perilous "Stepmom" territory -- with considerable tact.
But while individual scenes have an authentically off-the-cuff feel, the narrative structure as a whole feels a tad schematic, never more so than when Meredith's sib Julie (Claire Danes) drops by the house at her sister's request. Young, beautiful and artistically inclined, Julie charms the socks off the Stones, initiating a string of confrontations and switcheroos that carry pic through to its not entirely believable denouement.
Parker, in a brave but calculated departure from breezy "Sex and the City" territory, can't help but go overboard in her portrayal of a twitchy neurotic. Still, thesp gets to show some impressive range in the third act, when Meredith goes on an all-night bender and then must cope with the aftermath.
Keaton embodies the formidable Stone matriarch with an offhand sense of humor that cuts like a knife. As Amy, a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she's the real deal, delivering a deliciously feisty performance in an entirely different key from her work in "Mean Girls."
Nelson makes a wonderfully affectionate father figure whose anger, when provoked, is fearsome to behold. The usually stiff Mulroney does some of his best, least inhibited acting as Everett, while Wilson, as Ben, appears to have taken a few smart tips from older brother Owen.
Using tight compositions and closeups, cinematographer Jonathan Brown induces a pervasive sense of claustrophobia within the Stones' manse, itself a marvelously idiosyncratic piece of production design by Jane Ann Stewart. Michael Giacchino's score, inevitably more straightforward than his pulse-pounding orchestrations for "The Incredibles" and "Lost," is supplemented by a steady stream of vintage holiday tunes.

It's hard to fathom why anyone would voluntarily endure a holiday family reunion movie (hereafter HFRM)a genre devised solely to demonstrate how grotesque and how heartwarming families can bewhen actual holiday family reunions already exist for those very reasons. This season's HFRM, The Family Stone , settles in for a bromide-soaked Christmas with the vaguely bohemian titular clan in their shabby-chic New England  manse, and seems to have been written by the same computer program as any number of recent predecessors (Home for the Holidays , The Myth of Fingerprints , Pieces of April ). For those who can't afford the software, here are three easy steps:
1. Include an outsider. The most useful figure in the HFRM, the interloper serves either as counterpoint to the functionally dysfunctional family or as the tight-knit brood's common object of ridicule. Or both: In The Family Stone , the prodigal son (Dermot Mulroney , doing a reasonable impersonation of a concrete post) brings home a tense, frigid, multitasking city bitch with a constantly ringing cell phone and a severe bun (Sarah Jessica Parker ). Will the loosey-goosey Stones thaw out the WASP icicle? Will she in turn, once she literally lets her hair down, teach them not to be so judgmental? People who have never seen movies will be on the edge of their seats.
2. Add minorities. The HFRM is a bourgeois white preserve, but a sprinkling of Others conjures the illusion of social relevance. You can actually be  racist and hope no one minds, like Pieces of April  (your viewers will after all be mostly bourgeois and white). Or like The Family Stone , you can attribute bigotry to unsympathetic characters for comic foot-in-mouth moments. In Stone writer-director Thomas Bezucha 's all-of-the-above scripting masterstroke, the youngest son (Tyrone Giordano ) is (a) deaf, (b) gay, and (c) has a black boyfriend. The movie lavishes praise on the enlightened Stones for not treating these attributes like handicaps. Or maybe, since these are the two most boring, neutered homosexuals in film history, it's just that no one notices them (Tom Hanks  and Antonio Banderas  in Philadelphia  look like Genet sodomites by comparison). In the interest of realism, note that gays at holidays tend to behave more like Robert Downey Jr.  in Home for the Holidays  (or Robert Downey Jr. in any movie since Natural Born Killers ).
3. Give Mom cancer. Other illnesses with other family members work too, but this combo has a foolproof classicism. The HFRM is not generally an actor's showcasealmost everyone in the ensemble gets at best one characteristic each (amazing what some performers can do with this: Stone 's Luke Wilson , as if taking his cue from a Bresson model, fashions a paragon of beatific slackerdom from a single, mildly stunned expression). But for Mom, you'll need someone with presence: Patricia Clarkson  in April  or, better still, Diane Keaton  in Stone , looking like a Sontagian lioness and acting batshit. Don't play the terminal card before the second half, though. This gives you enough time to set her up as eccentric, unstable, even mean. The crazier the betterall will be weepily forgiven in due course.
