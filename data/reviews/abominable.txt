Not only are slasher/horror/splatter films enjoying a sharp spike in popularity, right now they're also where one can find the best comedy. "Abominable" goes completely over the top into an Ed Wood-meets-"Rear Window" subspecies of giddy, gory amateurish abandon. Inherent ridicule of the form and some absurdly violent moments will make it a draw among existing fans of the genre, and maybe win over some new ones. 
Directed by Ryan Schifrin, who obviously knows the tropes, "Abominable" is utterly unself-conscious in reworking horror conventions -- as well as the Sasquatch legend -- in ways that will inevitably get laughs from gore freaks.
A group of beautiful college-age girls have retreated to the California mountains, where bad things will inevitably happen. But how the violence plays follows a different morality play than we're used to: Sex usually determines who dies first, but in this case, the girl who admires the mountain view gets a reprieve, while the one who can't stay off her cell phone ... well, it isn't pretty.
Matt McCoy plays Preston Rogers, a man in a wheelchair who fulfills many of the necessary requirements of horror-movie heroism. He has a tragic past and is considered too unstable to be believed by the police when he reports a creature has been eating his neighbors. He can never seem to alert the surviving girls that their friends are disappearing. And he's remarkably calm, given that he's about to become Bigfoot Chow.
McCoy lays it on thick, as does Mike Deak as the monster, who looks like an intemperate Ernest Borgnine. Lance Henriksen, who's done enough monster movies ("The Terminator," "Aliens") that his mere appearance puts a spin on the proceedings, is among those who gets Sasquatched.
Objective of the expertly cheesy special effects is not to frighten as much as appall.
