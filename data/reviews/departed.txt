Watching this new film by Scorsese is tantamount to falling in love again with the brash, cinematic bad boy from New York City, the little "Italianamerican" who elevated the septic allure of the criminal life to something sui generis in Mean Streets
 and GoodFellas
, the guy who made the pale white underbelly of the city talk to you in an urban patois that is part wiseguy, part Brooklynese, and never, ever anything less than 100% pure immigrant-American dreamspeak. He was (and with The Departed
, confirms he still is) the most red, white, and blue filmmaker since another Italian-American, Frank Capra, washed up on Ellis Island. Which makes it all the more interesting that The Departed
 is a remake of the 2002 Chinese film Infernal Affairs
. Working from William Monahan's deeply layered, immensely satisfying script, Scorsese's film expands on the (already excellent) original, moving the action from the director's home base to the not-dissimilar mean streets of Boston, where, to this day, the Irish mobs duke it out with the Johnny O'Law in a hellish jig. Here it involves the sort of cross/double-cross mind games that ultimately leads to a morally confounding no-man's-land. DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a not-cop placed deep undercover in the Mob by his bosses (Sheen, Wahlberg) at the Massachusetts State Troopers in an effort to nail longtime kingpin Frank Costello (Nicholson). Costello, in turn, has his own, hand-groomed mole in the "Staties" in the form of Colin Sullivan (Damon). As The Departed
 clips along, punctuated by gunfire, bodies, and lies, these two become aware of each other's machinations within their opposing camps, and, under extreme duress, they warily circle each other like blind and bloodied sharks. This is a dream cast for both Scorsese and the viewer, and everyone is working at the peak of their craft. Nicholson's flawless performance as the increasingly unhinged crime boss is a marvel of manic, paranoid ruination, and the film's running metaphor of rats � literal, figurative, and otherwise � is only too accurate. It's this film's interwoven storylines, a cat's cradle of doubt and duplicity, that mesmerize, and give DiCaprio and Damon the best roles they've ever had. Damon's cunning womanizer, who eventually settles down (sort of) with a cop shrink (Farmiga, in the film's only underwritten role), is riveting in his epithet-littered and self-righteous falsehood. And DiCaprio, working with the director for a third time, obliterates any remaining trace of Titanic
's teen-pop appeal from his r�sum�. As Billy, he's like a depth charge under immense pressure, descending deeper and deeper into the criminal abyss while struggling to hold on to his own identity. When he finally collides with his doppelganger, the concussion reverberates across the entire film. Scorsese doesn't have much to say about the Irish mob, or how their immigrant experience echos that of their Italian counterparts in New York, but this isn't Gangs of New York
, or even gangs of South Boston: It's Them vs. Us, with no I to speak of.


Martin Scorsese won't be winning any Oscars for ``The Departed." The movie's too hard, too pulpy -- too good
. A relentlessly violent, breathtakingly assured piece of mean-streets filmmaking, the film shows the legendary director dropping the bids for industry respectability that have preoccupied him over the past decade and doing what he does best: burrow to the agonized heart of criminality and let the blood and guilt splatter where they may.
Adapted from the 2002 Hong Kong action film ``Infernal Affairs" by the Dorchester-born screenwriter William Monahan , ``The Departed" is also the closest we've come yet to The Great Boston Movie, a beast that requires more honesty than filmmakers (and audiences) have been willing to grant. The film's only serious flaw is that it establishes a venal and local moral wasteland, crisscrossed by scummy realities of class and race, that it never follows up. What begins as a blood-soaked tragicomedy about our fair town's tribal warfare turns into merely a brilliant B movie. Don't let that keep you away.
``I don't want to be a product of my environment -- I want my environment to be a product of me
." So says Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the satanic South Boston mobster who could be Whitey Bulger's even more evil twin. Narrating the film's opening passages against a backdrop of news footage of the 1974 anti-busing violence, Costello lays out his version of ethnic realpolitik
: ``That's what the black chappies never realized. No one gives it to you. You have to take it."

ABOUT ``
THE DEPARTED" 
Frank does, however, give a leg up to a starstruck neighborhood kid named Colin Sullivan, whom he grooms for a long-term project: grow up straight, join the police, be my in-house mole. By the time Colin is played by Matt Damon, he's a canny customer on track to department success -- a rising star with the State Police's special investigative unit headed by the glib, hard-driving Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). Their mission: Bring down the Irish mafia in general and Costello in particular. Colin's mission: keep ``dad" apprised of any incoming busts.
A separate undercover unit run by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his hotheaded deputy Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) recruit their own L Street Brownie: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a police academy misfit with a crooked family he wants to live down. In short order, Billy is jailed on a cooked-up assault, sent back on the streets, and works his way into Costello's mob as an informer.
That's the snappy mirror gimmick that drove ``Infernal Affairs" -- two rats reporting on their compatriots and, increasingly, each other -- and ``The Departed" takes the chess match to insanely complex levels. Both groups begin frantically seeking the traitor in their midsts, and when Colin is put in charge of the department search, he grimly realizes that he has to find himself.
At one point Billy stalks his opposite number to a meeting with Costello, and the sequence becomes a sadistic game of now-I-see-me/no-you-don't. Good and bad bleed into each other as these two sons of Southie come to understand they're brothers in battered spirit, and that only the other man can understand what each is going through.
Eventually the plot spins into free fall and the bodies start piling up. You don't mind because Scorsese is so in command of his medium, because the performances are juicy and committed, and because the violence feels viscerally real. When people throw punches in ``The Departed," they break their hands; when one character falls several stories to the pavement, the blowback is defiantly unpretty. Costello toys absent - mindedly with an anonymous severed hand before asking an underling to ``get rid of this." ``The Departed" follows the consequences of bloodshed and betrayal all the way to the ugly end, and you won't feel like celebrating afterward .
Monahan's dialogue is filthy and funny, bristling with tabloid poetry: ``Your family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks"; ``You're a black guy in Boston -- you don't need my help to be completely [expletive]." The central performances are tremendous, too, and for once the local accents are spot-on (mostly; Sheen's still doing the Kennedys). This is DiCaprio's best work in a long while, and he makes you feel the suicidal craziness of ``having to be a different guy every day." Damon's playing a more multi-leveled game, though, and under that mashed pretty-boy face we glimpse a whole spectrum of rat emotion: greed, ambition, cowardice, and a pathetic sort of loyalty.
Wahlberg almost steals the film as a pit bull of a Statie -- every time he shows up you start grinning -- and Nicholson does
 steal everything that's not nailed down. Frank Costello could be Jack Torrance from ``The Shining" given a new lease on life and scraped clean of all human scruple. He's a joyfully vulgar psycho, a creature of pure id. You don't try to understand this guy -- as someone says, quoting Sigmund Freud, the Irish ``are the only people impervious to psychoanalysis" -- you just run like hell.
For all the excellence of the performances (which includes Vera Farmiga as a police shrink drawn to both Damon and DiCaprio; her accent's wobbly but the acting's right), this is a director's return to form. When Scorsese misfires here, cueing the Rolling Stones' ``Gimme Shelter" on the soundtrack yet again or giving Colin a high-rise apartment with a patently fake view of the State House dome, you're inclined to forgive him. When ``The Departed" roars to life, as it does in so many of its scenes, you feel like nobody understands movies -- the delirious highs, the unforgiving moral depths -- as well as this man does. Welcome back, Marty.


         Frequently excessive but never dull, "The Departed" is a little too much of a lot of the things that define Martin Scorsese films but it's also almost impossible to resist. Too operatic at times, too in love with violence and macho posturing at others, it's a potboiler dressed up in upscale designer clothes, but oh how that pot does boil.
 
  The key to the success of "The Departed's" cops-and-robbers tale of connivance, duplicity and deception is a crackerjack premise that comes courtesy of Hong Kong's 2002 "Infernal Affairs." Written by Alan Mak and Felix Chong, that film was a monster hit both at home and throughout Asia that spawned two sequels and was acquired by Miramax but never released theatrically in Los Angeles.
 


         






    The idea is that in the midst of a war between the police and organized crime, each side succeeds in placing a clever mole in the heart of the other camp. Gradually, each spy discovers the existence — but not the identity — of his opposite and, as the noose tightens and the tension ratchets past the cracking point, each man struggles furiously to unmask his rival before he himself is revealed and destroyed.
 
  Scorsese's film, set in Boston and starring the powerhouse combination of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, duplicates several of the themes of "Infernal Affairs" and borrows numerous key scenes and even a few lines of dialogue from the original.
 
  That said, screenwriter and Boston native William Monahan (who did Ridley Scott's underrated "Kingdom of Heaven") has done a persuasive job lengthening and deepening the Hong Kong story, adding plot and character complexities and ending up with a film that is a full 50 minutes longer than the original. A cross between a B picture and grand opera, "The Departed" features dialogue that alternates between unblinkered obscenity and tangy lines like "he'd kill seven people to cut my throat, and he could do it."
 
  Having a strong story and script has energized both Scorsese (returning to the gangster genre for the first time since 1995's "Casino") and his actors. In addition to its trio of marquee names, "The Departed" showcases excellent work from a wide range of performers, including Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and, in the role that may finally break her through to the wider recognition she deserves, Vera Farmiga.
 
  But even though it has a lot that's worth showing off, "The Departed's" florid determination to be showoff-y, to take pride in bravado, is periodically worrisome. Though a story like this has to traffic in excessive violence and unsettling language, it's not essential to flaunt those elements. Unlike Clint Eastwood in "Mystic River" (a similarly dark story with the same Boston locale), Scorsese has a need to periodically go over the top that will either be to your taste or not.
 
  The same is true for Jack Nicholson's central performance as criminal kingpin Frank Costello, a.k.a. Mr. C, the Irish godfather of his Boston neighborhood. Introduced with a voice-over monologue that practically drips aphorisms ("People say you're a product of your environment; I want my environment to be a product of me"), Costello is the kind of boss who knows everyone's secrets and takes care of his own.
 
  It's the intention of "The Departed" to mythologize Costello, to see him as a criminal lion in winter charismatically unconcerned about his frazzled hair and questionable taste in clothes. The film trades successfully on Nicholson's legendary presence to do this, perhaps too much so. For every moment when Nicholson gets it just right, and there are plenty of those, there are others where the performance feels indulged more than is good for it.
 
  Costello is introduced taking a paternal interest in a young neighborhood boy. A decade passes in moments and the boy is Colin Sullivan (the always reliable Damon), a new member of the Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Special Investigations Unit under Capt. Ellerby (a gleefully profane Baldwin). He's supposed to be investigating Costello, but he's actually on the man's payroll, tipping his mentor off to what is going on.
 
  The other "statie" in the film is Billy Costigan (DiCaprio). We meet him being verbally taken apart by Capt. Queenan (Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Wahlberg, with the film's most authentic Boston accent) of an undercover unit. They want to know what's inside Costigan because they want him to go so deep undercover in Costello's organization even he will have trouble remembering what side he is on. Which is pretty much what happens.
 
  Most of "The Departed" is gainfully employed with these kinds of cat-and-mouse maneuvers, as the two men, different sides of the same coin, play out their double and triple games in an exceptionally violent world. Whenever one of the film's numerous indulgences threatens to disrupt things, strong acting and the wheels-within-wheels plot don't let it happen.
 
  Though he is not without competition, the best of the film's male actors is DiCaprio. Moviegoers used to his eternal boyishness will be pleasantly surprised at this, his first fully adult role, at the genuine substance and maturity he brings to this part without losing any of his trademark vulnerability. As Scorsese told Entertainment Weekly, "his face is a battlefield of moral conflicts."
 
  Another revelation for some viewers will be the critical performance of Farmiga as Madolyn, a psychiatrist with links to both Costigan and Sullivan. An actress who has been quietly knocking roles out of the park for half a dozen years, Farmiga handles this tricky part with aplomb, convincingly bringing different emotions to her scenes with both men. It would be a heck of an irony if this super-macho film was remembered as the one where this splendid actress finally got her due.
 
 
 'The Departed'

  In general release.   

The argot of New York's Little Italy is Martin Scorsese's first language, but the filmmaker speaks fluent, pungent Bostonese in the terrific cops-and-mobsters tale The Departed . And no wonder: That old Southie nabe, in the shadow of downtown bureaucracy and yet a world apart from it, is not so different, in its clannish insularity, from Scorsese's. Boston scrod or Elizabeth Street scampi, what's the diff?
In embracing this new locale, Scorsese creates a movie built on the foundations of GoodFellas  and Mean Streets  but not chained to it, a picture that feels as effortless as The Aviator  and Gangs of New York  felt effortful. Like many a smart urbanite, Scorsese appears to have used travel to another city to broaden his vistas. (After visiting London for Match Point , Woody Allen must know the feeling.) And that unclenching brings out the best in his instincts, which in turn allows him to bring out the best in his actors: Complicated, compelling Leonardo DiCaprio, for one, reaches a new career high in this, his third Scorsese picture.
Consider the setup: The Massachusetts State Police (in Beantown slang, they're ''Staties'') are intent on bringing down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a Boston Mob boss impervious to the inconveniences of the law. To that end, Southie-bred police cadet Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is sent undercover to infiltrate Costello's organization. Aside from Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), no one on the force knows of Costigan's assignment.
But moles burrow both ways. Rising young sergeant Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) falls in with the Staties' Special Investigations Unit, reporting to his own unit commander, Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). Colin is as snappy and upwardly mobile as Billy is scruffy and dead-end, a status-conscious yuppie. While he appears to be investigating Costello with zeal, it just so happens that since altar-boy childhood, this particular homey has been secretly loyal to Costello, who essentially groomed Sullivan to work for him on the inside  tipping him off to police maneuvers, that sort of thing. And to make matters even more complex, Colin's classy girlfriend, Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a police psychologist, is also involved with Billy  he's her patient.
The Departed  comes by its puzzle pieces honestly  the movie, with an outstanding script by Kingdom of Heaven  screenwriter William Monahan, is a relatively direct adaptation of Infernal Affairs , a great 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller steeped in Chinese conundrum and Hong Kong aesthetics. But where Infernal Affairs  is less interested in psychological nuance than in Eastern-style elegance of action, Scorsese and Monahan showcase Western-style, actorly character building at its most enjoyable. DiCaprio's adult intensity as a young man agonizing over the disappearance of his real identity under the weight of playing someone he isn't is matched by Damon's thoughtful restraint. Wahlberg  a charismatic, always underrated natural  digs into his own Mean Beantown Streets background and comes up with surprising fury. Sheen, freed from West Wing  presidential responsibilities, imbues his cop captain with a surprising pathos. As the one woman in an all-male saga, Farmiga's Madolyn hints at female secrets and personal sadnesses probably not necessary to the film but welcome nonetheless. The learned (or, in the case of Wahlberg, resumed) Boston accents sound ripe but right, with Baldwin adding his own audience-pleasing oomph to the exercise.
And lest anybody's wondering, The Departed  is splattered with moments of pure, dead-eyed, blood-soaked Scorsesean violence  the pop-pop of bullets and oof-oof of beatings that explode skulls and smash faces. (Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristi Zea give the whole enterprise, which shot mostly in NYC, a grimy, gray, Bahston Hahbuh look.)
I'm not sure what Nicholson is doing in two rococo scenes, one with a rubber sex toy and another entertaining two women at the opera  goofing around, I think, with more Jack-ness than the director should have put up with. On the other hand, Costello is  the flashiest guy on the street, as well as the most dangerous. Working with Scorsese for the first time, Nicholson provides a menace that's half silky, half seedy. The very title The Departed  suggests a James Joycean take on Irish-Catholic sentiment when, of course, this story is anything but: It's Scorsesean, and he's in full bloom.

 There are almost as many films fighting in “The Departed” as there are guys slugging it out. First among those films is Martin Scorsese’s cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves. Hovering above that film like a shadow is “Infernal Affairs,” the equally sleek Hong Kong assemblage on which it is based and which serves as one of its myriad doubles. And then there is the film conjured up by Jack, as in Jack Nicholson, who when not serving Mr. Scorsese’s interests with a monstrous leer all but subverts those interests with a greedy, devouring hunger.  Each Scorsese film comes freighted with so many expectations, as well as the enormity of his own legend, that it’s a wonder the director can bear the weight. Compared with his last fictional outings, the period story “Gangs of New York” and the Howard Hughes portrait “The Aviator,” this new work feels as light as a feather, or as light as any divertissement from a major filmmaker who funnels his ambitions through genre. What helps make “The Departed” at once a success and a relief isn’t that the director of “Kundun,” Mr. Scorsese’s deeply felt film about the Dalai Lama, is back on the mean streets where he belongs; what’s at stake here is the film and the filmmaking, not the director’s epic importance.  In “The Departed” the camera work and cutting feel faster, lower to the ground, more urgent than they have in his recent films. (Michael Ballhaus shot it; Thelma Schoonmaker edited.) The speed and Mr. Scorsese’s sureness of touch, particularly when it comes to carving up space with the camera, keep the plot’s hall of mirrors from becoming a distraction.  There simply isn’t time to think about the story and whether any of it makes sense, including the astonishing coincidences involving its stealth doppelgängers: Matt Damon’s Colin Sullivan, a bad guy who  goes undercover in Boston as a state police officer, and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Billy Costigan, a state cop who infiltrates the underworld. Strangers to each other, Colin and Billy are brothers of a kind when it comes to Frank Costello, the gangster played by Mr. Nicholson. The evil this man does and portends is laid out with  precision timing in the hair-raising opening minutes.  As the Rolling Stones wail on the soundtrack (“War, children, it’s just a shot away”), Frank moves through the shadows, his face almost entirely obscured. Dispensing Sun Tzu-like truths  as if they were Pez candies, he sets his sights on little Colin Sullivan who, with eyes wide as plates, listens rapt. Frank buys the boy groceries, then leans into the girl behind the store counter, whispering something in her ear. (Her face says it’s something dirty.) Minutes later Colin (now played by Mr. Damon) has graduated from the police academy and is thanking Frank for his graduation gift. With a bag of food, the bad man has bought a soul.  Mr. Damon enters the story about the same time that Mr. Nicholson exits the shadows. Too bad he doesn’t stay there until the final credits. This Janus-like actor has long presented two faces for the camera, the jester called Jack and the actor named Nicholson. He has worn both faces for some of his famous roles, but over time he has grown fond of the outsize persona called Jack, with his shades and master-of-ceremonies sneer, and it’s hard not to think that the man has become his mask. Mr. Nicholson has some choice moments in “The Departed”: he owns the thrilling opening minutes and is persuasively unnerving in his early scenes with Billy, whom he only knows as a neighborhood loser ripe for the plucking.  But as the story twists and twists some more, Mr. Nicholson begins to mix too much Jack into his characterization. In Alexander Payne’s “About Schmidt,” he plays a man whose tamped-down disappointment meant that he had to pull the performance from deep inside; he committed to the part without the help of his sidekick persona. In “The Departed” he’s playing bigger and badder than life with engines roaring. It’s a loud, showy performance. Frank even comes equipped with a trove of gaudy accouterments: a goatee like an arrow, a leopard-print robe, a bevy of babes, a severed hand and a ridiculous fake phallus. Another actor might wear these accessories; Mr. Nicholson upstages them.  Mr. Scorsese, no wallflower himself, spends a lot of time vying for attention with his famous star. Mr. Damon and Mr. DiCaprio serve him better. Mr. Damon does some very good work as the buttoned-down gangster hiding a world of darkness behind a facade of normalcy; his boyish looks have rarely looked creepier than when Colin is eagerly doing Frank’s bidding. And Mr. DiCaprio’s own callow looks fit better with his role than they did in either “Gangs of New York” or “The Aviator.” He falls apart nicely, and in the scene in which he stands, anguished and wrung out, over the body of a fallen colleague, you see what Mr. Scorsese might have seen all along: a vulnerability that seems animal-like in its unknowing.  The role generally works to Mr. DiCaprio’s strengths since he has to keep a lid on the character and his own tendency to go overly big; even his physical performance, the way his arms and legs jangle, is more controlled. Billy melts down, but he melts slowly, his panic leaking through the cracks opened up by his escalating fear. Terrified that Frank will discover his identity, he unloads on a police shrink (Vera Farmiga, working hard to make a nothing role count), who also happens to be Colin’s girlfriend. The plot thickens, then reaches full boil among further complications, dirty dealings, blood on the floor and excellent performances from Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg (as detectives), who own their every scene. As do the rest of the actors, they prove that what really counts here, in the end, isn’t the film, but all its swaggering men.  Fine as Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Damon are, neither is strong enough to usurp memories of the actors who played the same roles in the original  — Tony Leung as the good guy, Andy Lau as the bad — both of whom register with more adult assurance. That’s an observation, not an indictment. Comparisons between “Infernal Affairs” and its redo are unavoidable given how closely the screenwriter William Monahan follows the first film’s beats and scenes. But as fans of “Infernal Affairs” (and its two sequels) know well, the Hong Kong film owes an enormous debt to Mr. Scorsese, whose imprint, along with that of Michael Mann, is all over the trilogy. The Hong Kong and Hollywood action films are themselves doppelgängers of a sort, and Mr. Scorsese, himself larger than life, is one of their biggest, baddest daddies.  “The Departed” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The language is dirty and the action bloody.

Mixing it up with modern mobsters for the first time since "Casino" 11 years ago, Martin Scorsese cooks up a juicy and bloody steak of a movie in "The Departed." Different from the director's earlier crime dramas in its shared focus on cops rather than on just the goodfellas, this reworking of a popular Hong Kong picture pulses with energy, tangy dialogue and crackling performances from a fine cast, combining to give Warner Bros. a winning hand commercially in all markets.
After the elaborate exertions of the period pieces "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator," it's good to see Scorsese back on home turf, at least in a figurative sense, since the setting this time is Boston rather than New York. Not that he's especially scaled down this time out; the complexity of the crises, formidable dramatis personae, hefty running time and long-arc drama make this a big picture. But the film intensely concentrates on conflict and character, thereby sweeping the viewer up in a tale of epic deceit in which nearly everyone is compromised and comes to no good.
From a plot point of view, "The Departed" closely follows its 2002 progenitor, "Infernal Affairs," a big Asian hit and crime buff fave which, like its follow-up prequel and sequel, remained little seen in North America. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan ("Kingdom of Heaven"), who has stated he made a point of not watching the original film and worked only from a translation of the Chinese script, make the material their own by anchoring the story deeply in the Irish South Boston mob, in the milieu's particular culture and societal attitudes.
For those who want reassurance Scorsese is re-embracing the "GoodFellas" aesthetic, it's there right at the outset. With the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" setting the mood, an imposing man addresses a nice Irish kid at a working class soda fountain and presses money into the kid's hand, enticing the boy into his circle.
Some years later, the older man comes into focus as crime kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), while the kid has grown into a rising star of the Massachusetts state police force, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) -- long since placed on this path as a mole by Costello.
The police, repped by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his right arm, Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), long frustrated by their failure to nail Costello, carefully pick a candidate to infiltrate Costello's inner circle. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a ballsy cadet who has had no advantages in life. They stick him in jail for a time to give him credentials that may pass Costello's muster.
Thus are two shrewd, steely young men, unbeknownst to one another, placed within the same milieu with the same contacts but at dueling purposes. It's a wonderful set-up for a pressurized, high-wire drama with ample psychological overtones, one that's been impressively constructed like a trap and pays off with appropriate, bitter tragedy.
Along the way, there is plenty of room for tantalizing confrontations, consideration of human beings' capacity for courage and corruption, and stylistic doodling. Of all the ingredients in the pot, the one that jumps out and grabs you is the language. Man, can Monahan write dialogue, and not just goombah threats and vulgarities, although he's great with those. Wahlberg, playing his boss's bad cop other half, delivers outrageously insulting tirades faster than Rodney Dangerfield could spit out self-deprecation and has half of the script's best lines.
Most of the rest belong to Nicholson, whose old devil likes to crudely ruminate on sexual matters -- he upbraids two priests and a nun in a restaurant for their would-be perversions -- and is also capable of succinct philosophizing; when told by an associate that his mother is "on the way out," Costello replies, "We all are. Act accordingly."
But the heart of the film belongs in the conflicted, ambiguous middle between the outright criminal and the occasional righteous, uncorrupted cop. Sullivan, who is the picture of the savvy, red-blooded, sometimes less-than-principled Irish big-city cop, is able to shine at his job while still managing to tip his patron off to any threat. He puts engagingly brash moves on a shrink, Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), who treats traumatized cops as well as criminals, and they soon become a couple.
But if, through lifelong preparation, Sullivan has largely learned to cope with his double life, for Costigan it's a daily struggle. He passes Costello's brutal are-you-a-cop tests with remarkable strength, and never cracks under the watchful eye of the boss's untiringly suspicious enforcer, Mr. French (Ray Winstone). Costigan also enters Madolyn's life, putting her at the intersection of an eventual showdown one imagines would send her to a shrink as well.
The propulsive movement and sweat-inducing situations inevitably recall "GoodFellas," but the sensation here is somewhat different. The earlier film felt like it was on speed itself. "The Departed" has a exaggerated Grand Guignol quality to it, in the way it combines rock 'n' roll and opera on the soundtrack and in its accommodation of the play-acting at its core.
The heightened style may also be a way of making room for Nicholson's performance, which is theatrical in a very entertaining way. At times he's right on the money, conveying as convincingly as anyone could the attitudes of a tough old bastard who's had things his own way all his life, while at other moments he flies off into an uncharted orbit for which the director tries to make room.
Operating a bit closer to terra firma, DiCaprio is outstanding as the audience's main point of emotional contact, a man gravely at risk every moment of his life (one minor issue is an uncertainty over how much time the main action encompasses). In his third collaboration with Scorsese, DiCaprio has rarely been this vital, energized or passionate.
Damon delivers impressively as well. Thesp's receding boyish qualities merge well with the role, just as a hint of his Jason Bourne hardness adds the necessary ruthless edge to the repellently interesting character.
Supporting cast is sparkling down the line, led by Wahlberg, who steals every base on the field and takes them home. Boston boys Damon and Wahlberg set the bar with their accents, while some of the interlopers, notably Nicholson, are in and out.
Craft contributions are superb. Michael Ballhaus' widescreen lensing has a wonderful clarity to it and an unforced sense of composition, while Thelma Schoonmaker's editing nimbly juggles the numerous characters and potentially confusing events without fuss. Kristi Zea's production design, particularly the open look for the police h.q. and the modernism she brings out of old Boston, plays a major role in shaping the film's character.

No studio director was a greater hero to the Hong Kong new wave than Martin Scorsese . John Woo  dedicated The Killer  to him; Wong Kar-wai  modeled his first feature, As Tears Go By , after Mean Streets ; Taxi Driver 's rain-slicked slo-mo urban stylistics worked their way into countless lesser HK films. With The Departed , Scorsese returns the complimentstriving to bring it all back home by remaking the strongest Asian action film of the past few years.
Andrew Lau  and Andy Mak 's 2002 Infernal Affairs  has a scenario so excellent it's amazing it didn't appear until movies entered their second century (and readers are invited to let me know if it had): A powerful mob boss grooms a follower from childhood to join the police even as the police plant an undercover agent within the boss's crime family. Each organization realizes that it has been infiltrated, but it's not until the movie approaches its climaxand after each mole has been enjoined to, in effect, find himselfthat the deeply buried parallel informants figure out each other's identity.
Its key dramatic roles assumed mainly by cell phones, Infernal Affairs  is one of those rare movies in which the premise is the star; Scorsese, however, has necessarily packed his remake with names. Matt Damon  plays the rogue cop (Andy Lau 's role in the original), with Leonardo DiCaprio  as his undercover counterpart (embodied with soulful vulnerability by Tony Leung ). Towering over both youngsters, Jack Nicholson  has the meatyand here vastly inflatedrole of the patriarchal crime boss. Eric Tsang  stole Infernal Affairs  with his high-spirited moonfaced malevolence; Nicholson is handed the keys to the kingdom in his first scene.
The Departed  is a wildly commercial project, but let no one imagine it a work for hire. The opening burst of rock 'n' roll mayhemflashback street fight scored to the Rolling Stones is instant Scorsese. Transposing the action to the mean streets of South Boston , the filmmaker gets to refresh his stock-in-trade: The foulmouthed protagonists are cops rather than wiseguys and, as the gangsters are Irish, the colorful ethnic invective can encompass Italians. The Deuce is here the Combat Zone; the resident, porn-haunted madman is a crime boss; the John Ford  movie that's quoted isn't The Searchers  but, inevitably, The Informer  (it's shown on TV). Catholic guilt, however, is a constant.
Infernal Affairs  was surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action, but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction. The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near-Tarantinian levelsappropriate as he's staking a claim to QT's turf. Screenwriter William Monahan  (responsible for last year's Ridley Scott  crusades spectacle Kingdom of Heaven ) provides some choice insults: "Hey, go save a kitten in a tree, you fuckin' homos," Damon taunts his rivals in a police-fireman football game. No opportunity is missed to call a priest a pederast. (In addition to a flair for the schoolyard bon mot, Monahan's major contribution is combining the spies' two love interests into one very, very nervous shrinkplayed by Vera Farmiga thus creating the possibility for yet another betrayal.)
The film craftwhich is to say, the camera placement and Thelma Schoonmaker 's slam-bang editingis first-rate, at least at first. Running two and a half hours, The Departed  is 50 minutes longer than the original; the set pieces are more baroque than suspenseful, and the texture overwhelms the premise. (By the time of the not-even-climactic mondo bloodbath car-crash shoot-out, the story's a sodden mess.) Farmiga's role notwithstanding, psychology is primitive: Damon's rogue cop starts to crack under the strain of his charade as DiCaprio's volatile, Valium -gobbling fake mobster grows increasingly anxious. (DiCaprio's character is never sufficiently motivated, but his stolid nonperformance is ultimately more affecting than Damon's one-note interpretation.) In a movie characterized by broad accents and broader characterizations, Mark Wahlberg  has the distinction of delivering the least nuanced, most sympathetic (and funniest) turn, as the mouthiest cop on the force.
Of course, the Damon and DiCaprio characters are supposed to be acting. Not so, Nicholson's, but never to be ignored, the star skews crazier and crazier, appearing with stage blood up to his elbows, playing pointless drunk scenes, pulling whimsical rat faces, reprising his satanic role in The Witches of Eastwick  after a night at the opera. (For all the sulfur, Ray Winstone  is far scarier as the mobster's second in command.) Scorsese has a long history of burdening films with unpleasant and even atrocious central performances, and Nicholson seems bent on twirling the mustache off Daniel Day-Lewis 's heavy in Gangs of New York a role that really belonged to producer Harvey Weinstein .
Neither a debacle nor a bore, The Departed  works but only up to a point, and never emotionallyeven if the director does contrive to supply his version of a happy ending. "I don't want to be a product of my environment," Nicholson boasts at the onset. "I want my environment to be a product of me." Yeah, yeah, and that's the problem. Overwrought as The Departed  may be, it's nothing that wouldn't have been cured by losing Jack (and maybe half an hour). Too bad the bottom line meant Scorsese had to sell that hambone Mephistopheles his soul.
