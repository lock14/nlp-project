Oh, dear Lord, where to begin? Bono in a fright wig as Dr. Robert, singing "I Am the Walrus" on his way to meet the giant blue puppet people? "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" set to an image of US soldiers struggling to carry the Statue of Liberty to Vietnam? "I've Just Seen a Face" as an upbeat dance number set in a bowling alley?
How to describe the blinding combination of artistic ambition, excess, and plain old bad taste that is "Across the Universe"? Director/conceptualist Julie Taymor brought Disney's "The Lion King" to Broadway and Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus" to the multiplex, but with her latest extravaganza, she merely brings the Beatles to grief. Improperly approached, the movie's a howling camp masterpiece.
Remember the TV miniseries "The '60s" of a few years back? The one that strained all the social, political, and cultural changes of the decade through the life and times of one American family? "Across the Universe" is like that, only with characters who open their mouths and sing Beatles songs.
A Dayton, Ohio, high school girl (T.V. Carpio) turns "I Want to Hold Your Hand" into a downtempo torch song aimed at the blond cheerleader on whom she has a forbidden crush. A Liverpool lad (Jim Sturgess) bound for America croons "All My Loving" to the dollybird he's leaving behind. A girl (Evan Rachel Wood) awaits her soldier boyfriend's return with "It Won't Be Long." And so on.
The idea is that the Beatles' music is so universally known and loved - so tattooed onto our cultural DNA - that it's the bedrock soundtrack of its era. There's some truth to that: If you were alive and had a radio in the '60s, there were the Beatles and there was everyone else. By coursing a half step ahead in musical exploration, the clothes they wore, the drugs and political stances they took, the Fab Four seemed to pull the entire decade along in their wake.
Curiously, "Across the Universe" envisions the Beatles' era without the Beatles actually present - an alternate universe where songs like "Girl" and "All You Need Is Love" are just hanging on the trees, ready to be plucked. It's an interesting notion, and it might work if the movie stuck to the chronology. Lennon and McCartney's tunes evolved in tandem with the cultural explosions they charted - the majestic exhaustion of "Let It Be" could only come after the uneasy fire of "Revolution," not the other way around.
Taymor and her writers mix up the songs, though, and they work in the most groaningly literal manner possible. The artistic Liverpudlian lad is named Jude; the sweetheart awaiting her soldier boy is Lucy. They're star-crossed (Starr-crossed?) lovers introduced by her raffish brother Maxwell (Joe Anderson), who's seen wielding a hammer at one point.
The girl with the crush on the cheerleader is named Prudence; in one scene she clambers through a New York apartment window over the bathtub, and I thought, "Right, she came in through the bathroom window - but no one's actually going to say that, are they?" Oh, yes, they are.
There's sexy Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a brassy belter in the Janis Joplin mode, and her guitarist boyfriend Jojo (Martin Luther), who morphs into a Hendrix type. The movie keeps piling it on, trying to address selling out, turning on, resisting the draft, fighting the man, running away from home, and every other development that merited a Life magazine cover between 1963 and 1970.
The dialogue, accordingly, is the stuff of soap operas and protest signs, and poor Wood gets the worst of it. "Paco says we have to radicalize," Lucy breathlessly informs Jude, shortly after he has designed a hip corporate logo shaped like a strawberry (a la Apple Corps) that somehow leads into "Strawberry Fields Forever." Later she says, "We're in the middle of a revolution, Jude, and you're doing doodles."
A doodle like this, chowderheaded from the get-go, has to be more than a little crazy if it's to work, and at its sometimes best "Across the Universe" dives off the deep end without fear. The results can be inspired: a surrealistic/militaristic dance number to the first part of "I Want You," or, later, a biting fantasia to "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" set among VA hospital beds, morphine drips, and a vision of multiple Salma Hayeks as mother superiors jumping the gun.
Other sequences are just a pox upon the brain and eye: Eddie Izzard in a hideous acid-freak-out version of "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite," for example. Anyway, why this song? Why so few from the enlightened pop craft of the Beatles' best albums, "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver"? Because they're less "important" than what came after? Because they don't lend themselves to Taymor's potted narrative?
In the end, "Across the Universe" is hobbled by its vaguely insulting comic-book version of the '60s and by a humorlessness that can only come from talented people convinced they're creating work for the ages. The obvious comparison is to Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge," and, like that movie, "Universe" may find favor among impressionable young audiences who weren't there. Luhrmann has a wicked sense of fun, though, while Taymor only has her love for the music and the era. Contrary to what you may have heard, love isn't all you need.


The Beatles already survived one attempt by Hollywood to turn them into kitsch  1978's infamous Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band   and so you have to wonder what they did to deserve Across the Universe , Julie Taymor's goofy, pompous, annoyingly boomer-myopic Fab Four musical. It's the sort of movie in which a young rebel reports for the draft, and Uncle Sam, glowering down from an ''I Want You'' poster, starts to sing  yes  Abbey Road 's ''I Want You.'' Then, just as you're in mid-jaw-drop, the number cuts to a group of soldiers in Vietnam carrying the Statue of Liberty as they sing, ''She's so heav-ayyyyy ...''
Watching Across the Universe , it's almost fun to pick out which use of the Beatles makes you gag the most. Taymor serves up the songs in sludgy marzipan renditions, cramming them into her god-awful shopping-mall rehash of the late '60s. There's ''With a Little Help From My Friends'' turned into a frat-house ditty (why not?); ''Helter Skelter'' slathered across counterculture riot footage in the style of a bad TV movie; and songs like ''If I Fell'' pasted onto romances that haven't been remotely dramatized. The story is all protests, rainbow crash pads, and solarized acid trips  a Hair y cliché fest, all reflected through the tale of a guy named Jude (Jim Sturgess) and a girl named Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). I did like the underwater kissing to ''Because,'' plus Bono doing ''I Am the Walrus.'' He has presence (more than you can say for anyone else). But the thing about the Beatles is, their songs already are  movies. They hardly needed to be fixing the hole of this one.

 From its first moments, when a solitary dreamer on a beach turns to the camera and sings, unaccompanied, the opening lines of the Beatles’ song “Girl,” Julie Taymor’s  ’60s musical fantasia, “Across the Universe,” reveals its intention to use the Beatles’ catalog to tell two stories at once, one personal, the other generational. That young man, Jude (Jim Sturgess), is a cheeky Liverpool dockworker with a twinkle in his eye. He quickly emerges as a winsome vocal composite of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, with a personality to match.  From here the movie only gets better. Somewhere around its midpoint, “Across the Universe” captured my heart, and I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you’ve tumbled.  That surrender is the kind of commitment that Ms. Taymor, a true believer in the magic of art, asks of an audience. And as the movie intensifies, and she brings in a fantastic array of puppets, masks and synergistic effects, you may find yourself in a heightened emotional state, even as you realize that what you’re seeing is unadulterated white, middle-class baby boomer nostalgia.  This risky hybrid of long-form music video and movie musical with clearly drawn characters tells the story of Jude’s star-crossed love affair with Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a girl from upper-crust East Coast suburbia. It follows the couple as they are swept up and come apart in the evolving counterculture of left-wing politics, sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.  The story, briefly: Jude, visiting the United States in search of his long-lost father, meets Lucy through her brother, Max (Joe Anderson), a student at Princeton, where the father is discovered working as a janitor. Max takes Jude home to his stuffy family for Thanksgiving, during which Max shocks his parents by announcing that he is dropping out of college. He and Jude drive to New York and settle in a sprawling East Village tenement and are soon joined by Lucy.  Their landlady, Sadie (Dana Fuchs, who played Janis Joplin in the Off Broadway show “Love, Janis”), is the movie’s resident earth mother. An aspiring rock singer, she sounds like a warmer, more controlled Joplin. Her triumphal “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?” announces Lucy’s arrival in New York, and later in the movie, her voice hoarsely shouting “Helter Skelter” rises above the mob during a Columbia University riot at which Jude is arrested.  Rounding out the bohemian household are Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy), a guitarist who arrives from Detroit by Greyhound after his younger brother’s death in the Detroit riots, and Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian-American lesbian cheerleader who hitchhikes to New York from Dayton, Ohio, and (in a joke on a Beatles song title) crashes into the house through the bathroom window.  Jo-Jo, who suggests a softened Jimi Hendrix, becomes Sadie’s on-again-off-again boyfriend and sometime lead guitarist. Prudence, who early in the film sings “I Want to Hold Your Hand” while gazing wistfully from afar at a blond cheerleader, develops a secret crush on Sadie. While Jude embraces art, Lucy, who lost her first boyfriend in Vietnam, gravitates toward antiwar activism after Max receives his draft notice and reluctantly leaves to fight in the war.  If the young lovers are familiar ’60s archetypes, the actors’ natural performances and the easy, colloquial dialogue by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (“The Commitments”) allow the characters to transcend the generic. When Lucy, gazing at Jude, sings “If I Fell” very slowly, in a sweet, trembling voice, she is one girl worriedly fantasizing about one boy.  Most of the historical events are lightly fictionalized in a movie that maintains only the fuzziest of timelines. Its 33 Beatles songs (two without words) have been re-recorded and sung by the actors. Yet “Across the Universe” feels emotionally true both to the Beatles, whose music today seems to exist outside of time, and to the decade it remembers. Smart, uncluttered musical arrangements help reposition the songs to address the situation at hand. As a result, music that has congealed in collective memory  — especially the clever, breezy early Beatles songs — emerges refreshed.  A visceral peak arrives with “Strawberry Fields Forever.” In this gorgeous production number, an artwork by Jude in which rows of bleeding strawberries are pinned to a white surface transmutes into a hallucination of strawberry bombs raining over Southeast Asia. Then the artist, in an anguished frenzy, begins smashing strawberries on the walls and floors and destroys his work.  This happens around the time that Lucy, who works for a militant antiwar organization, angrily dismisses Jude’s art as “doodles and cartoons.”  He charges into her office, snarls the  song “Revolution” and instigates a brawl. It is one of several moments in which “Across the Universe” grasps a central emotional duality of a culture in which rage and ecstatic idealism clashed and played into each other at the same time.  Another extraordinary scene follows Joe to a United States Army induction center at which an Uncle Sam poster comes to animated life, leans down, points a giant finger and growls, “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” Inside the center a choreographed sequence finds inductees in their underwear sliding involuntarily along the floor through lines of Army officers in grim Expressionistic masks, marching in robotic formation. The new recruits are next shown, still in their underwear, lugging a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty through the Vietnamese jungle.  The dreamiest reverie, set to  “Because,” begins with a tableau of nine friends blissfully lying on their backs in the grass in a mandala pattern. The circle disperses as Jude and Lucy find themselves in a watery blue sky where clouds melt into liquid, and the entwined lovers are themselves floating underwater. Most fanciful of all is a largely animated sequence in which Eddie Izzard is Mr. Kite, the ringmaster of a psychedelic circus with a dancing chorus line of “the blue people.”  Amid the phantasmagoria are several star cameos. As Max recovers from war injuries in a veterans’ hospital, he has a morphine-induced fever dream in which the beds in his ward rear up from the floor to the song “Happiness Is a Warm Gun,” and he is tended by five Salma Hayeks. Bono appears as the acid guru, Dr. Robert, a Ken Kesey-Neal Cassady fusion who sings “I Am the Walrus” at an acid-drenched party and conducts Jude, Lucy and a roiling band of Merry Pranksters on a delirious bus journey through a rainbow-colored countryside.  “Across the Universe,” in the spirit of the counterculture, goes with the flow. Its scenes, songs and witty roughhouse choreography, spun off from the Beatles’ movies “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Help!,” dissolve into a stream of consciousness with only occasional punctuation.  Because of its oh-wow aesthetic, its refusal to adopt a critical distance from the ’60s drug culture, its tacit approval of the characters’ antiwar activism and its token attention to the decade’s racial strife, “Across the Universe” leaves itself wide open to derision, complaints and endless nitpicking. But it couldn’t have succeeded any other way. The movie is completely devoid of the protective cynicism that is now a reflexive response to the term “the ’60s.”  “Across the Universe” believes wholeheartedly in the quaint,  communitarian spirit it exalts. You share the joy of its blissed-out hippies in the grass. You feel the deepening friendship between Jude and Max that is sealed in Max’s incandescent performance of “Hey, Jude.” And during the time it lasts, the intoxicating passion of Jude and Lucy, both innocents by today’s standards, convinces, for a moment, that love is all you need.    “Across the Universe”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has nudity, sexual situations,  drug use, mild violence and some strong language.

All you need is love -- for the Beatles, for psychedelic visuals, for ideas about being young in the �60s -- to fully enjoy �Across the Universe.� Julie Taymor has delivered an audacious, idiosyncratic creation that plays like a riff on �Hair� with Fab Four cachet, stretching a thin love story across one tumultuous decade. It�s all played with such conviction, that it�s hard to dislike but hard to take seriously. Pic�s commercial prospects look more in line with those of �Rent� than of �Chicago,� though the Taymor touch achieves enough sporadic moments of invention and punch-drunk romanticism to steal the hearts of baby boomers and young female auds in particular.
The flaky, freewheeling tuner features a cast of relative unknowns delivering fresh renditions of 33 classic tunes. The studio paid $10 million for use of the Beatles songs, which didn�t include rights to use the original recordings (and the group is not even mentioned in the ad campaign).
After her Broadway smash �The Lion King� as well as her feverishly operatic pics �Titus� (1999) and �Frida� (2002), it seemed inevitable that Taymor�s visual imagination and flair for spectacle would lead her to direct a movie musical.  
Purists may not appreciate what Taymor and scribes Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have wrought -- a cute romance set against an overly familiar backdrop of Vietnam War protests, mind-altering substances and tortured-artist navel-gazing -- in which spoken dialogue is minimized, allowing the music and lyrics to shape the narrative. 
Main characters� names offer immediate clues about song offerings: Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a beautiful American teen who just kissed her Army-bound boyfriend goodbye, while handsome Jude (Jim Sturgess) hails from (where else?) Liverpool. (Surprisingly, no one pops up with the name Eleanor Rigby.) Jude quits his shipyard job, heads for the U.S. and finds himself at Princeton, where he befriends Lucy�s smart, rebellious older brother, Max (Joe Anderson).
Unwilling to follow the blueprint laid out for him by his rigidly upper-crust parents, Max moves with Jude to New York, where they rent a room from foxy musician and mother hen Sadie (Dana Fuchs). Also joining the burgeoning bohemian enclave are the sexually confused Prudence (T.V. Carpio); soulful guitarist Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy), who gets a dynamite entrance courtesy of Joe Cocker on �Come Together�; and Lucy, whose blossoming relationship with Jude forms the heart of the movie.
All this plays more compellingly (if not coherently) onscreen than it sounds on paper, thanks to a musically driven storytelling style that leaps from song to song, with occasional dialogue snippets serving as connective tissue. Whatever their reservations, viewers will be curious to see how Taymor (with song producers T-Bone Burnett, Elliot Goldenthal and Teese Gohl) adapts and reinterprets a classic repertoire.
If Taymor�s choices sometimes border on the obvious, they can also be weirdly arresting. Carpio�s lovely, quavering rendition of �I Want to Hold Your Hand� becomes an ode to unrequited lesbian longing; �Let It Be� is reimagined as a gospel-infused elegy for slain U.S. troops and victims of the 1967 Detroit riots; and �Because,� sung by multiple individuals writhing nude underwater, achieves a haunting, frozen-in-time lyricism.
Not all the numbers are equally inspired, and some early perfs, such as buddy anthem �With a Little Help From My Friends,� feel stranded between naturalism and artifice. Taymor is more assured in her bold strokes; her most intricately staged number, �I Want You (She�s So Heavy),� grimly surveys the war recruitment effort as Max and other unwilling conscripts are stripped, physically examined and expelled into the jungles of Vietnam.
As the war takes centerstage and contempo parallels loom large, Lucy�s increasingly radical activism forces a wedge between her and aspiring painter Jude. But the dramatic conception here is predictable and generic.
As if to compensate, the musical numbers become progressively more flamboyant and visually unhinged. A cameo by Bono as a sort of godfather among hippies (delivering a forceful cover of �I Am the Walrus�) shifts the movie into a hallucinatory realm, with a tie-dye color scheme that suggests scenes were shot during an acid trip with Baz Luhrmann. Viewers who like movies to reflect their out-of-body experiences will gladly inhale, but for others, the excess may seem off-putting. Call it �Flabby Road.�
The widely publicized clash between Taymor and Revolution Studios topper Joe Roth over final cut will be blamed by some for the production�s disjointed feel, though coherence doesn�t seem to have been a top priority from the get-go. With its truncated performances and their sometimes arbitrary placement within the narrative, �Across the Universe� rarely achieves the organic flow, the sense of characters expressing themselves through unimpeded song, exemplified by two very different recent musicals, �Dreamgirls� and �Once.�
Thesps acquit themselves admirably on both singing and acting fronts. Sturgess� soft eyes, even softer voice and winning demeanor make this an auspicious leading-man debut, while Wood, who had no prior singing training, impresses with a soprano that matches her acting in emotional directness. Eddie Izzard and �Frida� star Salma Hayek have fleeting cameos.
Production elements are intensely stylized, with art direction and costumes delivering a gaudy approximation of �60s counterculture. Goldenthal, Taymor�s partner and frequent collaborator, also composed the score. 


After Hair , Hairspray , and the mass marketing of tie-dye, can the '60s be shrunk to fit any further? Yes, indeed, here comes Julie Taymor  to run the revolutions of sex, class, and race through the PG-13 sieve. Not that one turns to musicals for deep thought, but John Waters  understood that the movements of this transgressively utopian moment were R-rated, at least until some of themblack power, the Weather Undergroundfell off a cliff into cut-rate noir. Across the Universe , which filters the cultural revolt through a blizzard of early Beatles  songs, ends up both reductive and smugly condescending to a presumptively know-nothing audience.
Taymor, queen of the high-concept arty spectacle, has always been a nervous popularizer, which may be why, in order to get down with the people, she's teamed up here with the happily vulgarian British writing duo of Dick Clement  and Ian La Frenais , who phone in a sloganeering screenplay that culls every tired buzz word in the countercultural dictionary, man. The story turns on a blossoming love affair between Jude (Jim Sturgess ), a sweet-faced Liverpool  dockyard worker who arrives on an American campus to find the G.I. father who abandoned him after World War II, and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood ), a sweet-faced, affluent co-ed fresh from the high-school prom. Micro-macro, macro-micro: With Lucy's hunky fiancé neatly consigned to an army body bag, the two innocents from across the class divide feed and water their love as they're swept into snapshots of seismic social change, from New York to California, with a brief and bemusing stopover in India.
You say you want a sexual revolution? Well, I wanna hold your lesbian hand. Student revolt, anyone? They get by with a little help from their friends, in a horribly choreographed twirl around campus. Vietnam ? Here comes Uncle Sam, leaping out of his recruitment poster to spit out a few threatening bars of "I Want You." Times of trouble? Let it be and so on and on, as Jude and Lucy, guided by capering gurus (Bono , Joe Cocker , and Eddie Izzard , all smirking), climb dutifully up the peak of infinite possibility, only to march grimly down the hill of disillusion and despair when it all falls apart.
Expository Taymorish spectacles lurk at every turnlest we not get the travesty of Vietnam, Lucy's conscripted brother Max (played by Brit Joe Anderson ) actually lugs a Statue of Liberty  though napalmed fields. In a lonely gesture at spontaneity, the main characters sing their own numbers. But it's a stretch to hinge the era entirely on Beatles songs, especially when the selection is Beatles-nice rather than Beatles-naughty. The '60s were a mess of disparate but loosely connected movements, each with its own nexus of idealism and hubris. But Taylor wants a tidy, bushy-tailed finale, and so, hey Jude, all you need is love.
Except that: We need much more, so rent the best account I've seen of the hopes and fears of that twitchy, narcissistic, wonderfully high-minded timeAlain Tanner's quiet little 1976 Swiss movie Jonah, Who Will be 25 in the year 2000 , whose disappointed hippies pin their hopes for the future on a little boy born into their failed commune. Wherever he is, Jonah has hit 32, and if he's not selling roach clips on Telegraph Avenue or something ineffably sad like that, I like to think he's joined the Greens, thus ensuring that his parents' great adventure will not, as it were, have gone to pot.
