"Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay" in record time - just one scene. But the Indian-American med-student stoner and his tense Korean-American roommate remain prisoners of the same cruddy filmmaking that made their trip to White Castle a cult hit in 2003. And the political punch the title promises goes largely undelivered.
Both comedies were written and directed by Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz, who demonstrate low-tech faithfulness to the movie's scatological pursuits: Almost every scene looks vomited up.
On his way to Amsterdam, Kumar (Kal Penn) is caught using a homemade smokeless bong in an airplane bathroom. The bong look likes a bomb, and, to the suspicious eye, Kumar looks like an Arab terrorist. The government presumes Harold (John Cho) to be his North Korean accomplice. And so they're dragged to Gitmo, where prison-movie sexual horrors await.
Once they break out, they never stop running. And the adventure they have is a sporadically funny gross-out picaresque. It stretches from a nude house party in Miami to a poor black Alabama neighborhood, to a backwoods Klan rally, to a whorehouse with Neil Patrick Harris reprising his role as a macho version of himself, to a Texas wedding where Kumar's ex is getting married.
As they make their way west, pursued by a homeland security Nazi (Rob Corddry), you realize that Harold and Kumar's brief nightmare incarceration hasn't made them rebellious or angry. It's made them more passive than ever.
Our lovable heroes are shameless cowards. The most impassioned moment involves the recitation of a math poem. Otherwise, Harold and Kumar don't rage against the machine. They get stoned with it, sharing a joint with George W. Bush and hearing his side of things. He sounds wise and a little holy, which is fair, balanced, and extremely surreal. Kumar gives airport security the business - not the president who more or less authorized the duo's imprisonment.
Which raises a concern: Is a truly political stoner movie even possible? The entire point of getting high is to take some of the sting out of life. The movie goes after easy targets and goes soft on the harder issues.
Corddry's character, who manages to cast certain parts of the current government as ruthlessly bigoted, is the film's best satirical device. But Harold and Kumar seem blissfully immune, safely ensconced in fantasyland. Escaping from Guantanamo is a wish only the best pot can grant.

Considering the legacy of Hollywood's genially blitzed stoner-slacker doofus-buddy teams (Bill and Ted, Wayne and Garth, the sweet idiots of Dude, Where's My Car? ), it's no exaggeration to say that Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn), with their big hormonal appetites and even bigger brains, are the thinking man's version of disreputable youth hedonists. They represent the smartening up of dumbing down. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle  was a most excellent adventure in which the two wanted little more than to chow down on a mess of midnight sliders, only to discover that their ethnicity kept getting in the way. The message  and, more important, the joke  was that no one they met could see that these two were as homegrown as American pie.
In Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay , a fitfully funny if somewhat less excellent sequel, Kumar tries to light up a homemade bong in an airplane lavatory  but the device gets mistaken for a bomb, which results in the two getting tossed into a grimy cell in Guantanamo. They escape quickly enough (do you get the feeling this movie is a bit less plausible than the first?), and once they're on the road, trying to outrun the authorities, it's not Harold and Kumar who keep getting misjudged by their appearance. It's everyone else  the redneck hunter who lives in a shack that's really a sleek yuppie lair; the scary-looking black man who is actually a mild orthodontist, and whom the chief government terrorist hunter tries to make talk by ''tempting'' him with a can of grape soda; our heroes' parents, grilled by the authorities as if they had just stepped through the gates of Ellis Island. Written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, who wrote the screenplay for the first film, Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay  milks the absurdity of prejudice in so many different ways that it threatens, at moments, to wilt into a didactic liberal fable. It's a mesh of the funny and the draggy, though the comedy is goosed along by little volts of shock and edge: a ''bottomless'' party at which people, quite graphically, wear tops and nothing else; the appearance of an even more riotously-self-loathing-than-before Neil Patrick Harris; an encounter with a daddy-fearin', dope-smokin' Dubya who seems, in his total aspect, at least faintly, halfway...plausible.
Harold and Kumar, fortunately, never lose their verbally relentless way of delivering raunch as pure common sense. Kal Penn, who knows just how to bounce his quick, affectless delivery off his mischievous features, never reduces Kumar to shtick  he plays him as a fully thought-out character  and John Cho gives Harold's constant exasperation vigor and snap. At the same time, the movie reveals both of them to be not-so-secret romantics: When Kumar recites a love poem, which turns out to be a science nerd's metaphorical plaint about the loneliness of the square root of 3, it's a real Hugh Grant moment. From the look of things, it won't be long before these two have to escape from adulthood.

 If you think the last seven years have been one long, dumb, dirty joke — or maybe if, sometimes, you just wish you could believe as much — then “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay,” written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, just might be the perfect movie for you. That it is, quite unapologetically, far from perfect in every respect almost doesn’t matter. The simple fact that a movie exists with the title “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” is cause for hope. Or maybe for alarm. In any case, for a few laughs.  Be warned that some of these are fairly cheap and crude, involving the standard motifs of R-rated male comedy: excrement, leering sexual aggression, hysterical sexual insecurity and drug use. Not much new ground is broken in this department, which doesn’t mean that the jokes themselves aren’t funny.  The idea of gay sex induces panic; the sight of unclothed female flesh causes jaws to go slack; and in a crisis someone is sure to whip out a joint. (I won’t spoil any surprises by saying just who.) At one point the movie’s titular heroes drop in on a friend who’s having a “bottomless” party at which there seem to be only female guests, and the movie loses some credibility when it declines to show the full extent of its stars’ eventual participation in the festivities. Dudes, if the dude in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” could put his business up on the screen, then so can you. It’s a whole new world.  But in other, more significant ways, the “Harold & Kumar” movies, of which this is the second (after the immortal “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle”) and I hope not the last, go further than most stoner raunch comedies in acknowledging certain realities of contemporary American life.  The simplest innovation, but also in a way the most radical, lies in Harold and Kumar themselves. Played by John Cho (he’s Harold Lee, the Korean-American investment banker) and Kal Penn (he’s Kumar Patel, the Indian-American would-be medical student), they are a postcollegiate multicultural odd couple in a world where ignorance and prejudice do battle with hypersensitivity and political correctness. They are at once nerdy achievers caught in the gears of meritocracy and stoner rebels against the machine. In their exasperated, half-baked (or, in the reefer-mad Kumar’s case, fully baked) way, these representative men mock all sides.  And just about everything else too. Their first adventure, four years ago, was simple and aspirational: they had the munchies and they wanted some burgers. But now times have changed, even though it is only a few days later in screen time. Paranoia is no longer an occasional, bong-induced side effect, but rather standard operating procedure at the highest levels of government.  Well, sort of. When Kumar is asked to step aside for a random security check at the airport, he blusters about ethnic profiling, which it turns out is less a matter of righteous outrage than an attempt to distract the security agents from finding the marijuana in his underwear. He and Harold are going to Amsterdam to find Maria (Paula Garces), the new love in Harold’s life, but rather than wait until they land in that paradise of legal vice, Kumar tries to fire up the pipe in the lavatory at 30,000 feet.  To their fellow passengers Kumar’s bong looks like a bomb, and to a zealous Homeland Security bureaucrat (Rob Corddry), its discovery exposes a terrorist conspiracy between Al Qaeda and North Korea. And so into United States custody, and then, post-escape, on another stoner road trip, to Texas, where Kumar’s college sweetheart, Vanessa (Danneel Harris), is about to marry a well-connected prepster named Colton (Eric Winter). On the way they meet people who challenge some stereotypes and confirm others, and they also, in a sublime pop-cultural in-joke carried over from the trip to White Castle, hook up with the great Neil Patrick Harris.  “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” offers a shambling series of hit-and-miss goofs, rather than incisive satire directed at Bush-era America. That is the job of Mr. Corddry’s erstwhile “Daily Show” colleagues Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Mr. Hurwitz and Mr. Schlossberg (who wrote but did not direct “White Castle”) instead rely on a general sense of good-humored exasperation that never reaches the boiling point of political indignation.  But precisely because their attitudes are so bluntly hedonistic and apolitical, Harold and Kumar manage to be fairly persuasive when they get around to criticizing the status quo, which the movie has the wit to acknowledge itself as part of.  “It’s people like you who make the rest of the world think Americans are stupid. But we’re not stupid, and we’re not going to take this anymore.” These lines are  spoken by an exasperated government official, and they could, I suppose, be directed at the makers and stars of “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.” But they’re not stupid, and to the extent that the movie is, its idiocy serves the cause of good sense and intelligence. And no, I’m not smoking anything.  “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has foul language, drug use and gratuitous nudity.

Radical Muslim terrorists, inbred Deep Southerners, Homeland Security xenophobes and President George W. Bush are among the primary targets bruised and battered by the sledgehammering satire of "Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay," an over-the-top and beyond-PC comedy that sometimes deftly, sometimes slapdashedly infuses party-hearty anarchy with hectoring moral outrage. An appreciably more politically charged follow-up to 2004's "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" (a piddling B.O. performer that nonetheless achieved cult-fave status on DVD), this raucous road-trip laffer, set for an April 25 release, should perform exceptionally well with auds primed by its predecessor.
Whether the pic can attract newcomers to the franchise --and score breakthrough success during its theatrical run -- depends on the willingness of the masses to accept a sex-drugs-and-rock-'n'-roll comedy so jeeringly critical of post-9/11 paranoia and so openly contemptuous of authoritarian excesses by U.S. government agencies charged with waging the war on terror.
It's like "Animal House" meets "Dr. Strangelove" -- although, truth be told, it's highly unlikely even Stanley Kubrick would have dared attempt a scene like the one here in which an insanely overzealous Dept. of Homeland Security chief literally wipes his backside with the Bill of Rights.
Not that the entire pic is a slapsticky, scatological remix of a Keith Olbermann tirade. Indeed, long stretches are simply variations of comic riffs from the first "Harold & Kumar" misadventure. Once again, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn), pot-toking twentysomethings with drastically dissimilar degrees of ambition, set out on a cross-country quest fueled by their taste for Cannabis. Also once again, the buddies manage to subvert stereotypes (even while playing them for laughs) during close encounters with strangers who range from seriously weird to downright dangerous.
And yes, once again, the boys cross paths with Neil Patrick Harris, who takes unseemly delight in playing himself as a drug-consuming sexaholic who exploits his "Doogie Howser" fame at every opportunity.
The big difference this time is that, instead of seeking a beloved burger joint, Harold and Kumar are on the run because, after being mistaken for terrorists while aboard an Amsterdam-bound plane and getting shipped off to Guantanamo Bay, they miraculously escape and flee to Florida. From there, they must somehow make their way to Texas and seek help from Harold's politically well-connected former classmate (Eric Winter) -- who just happens to be preparing his wedding to Kumar's former sweetheart (Danneel Harris).
Ron Fox (Rob Corddry), the aforementioned Homeland Security chief with the personal hygiene problems, leads the massive manhunt for the fugitives he assumes represent a link to a new nexus of Al Qaeda and North Korean terrorists. Corddry plays the wild-eyed zealot as a live-action cartoon who unthinkingly offends Jews, blacks and marginally less rabid colleagues (including an increasingly frustrated Roger Bart) in the name of keeping America safe.
In sharp contrast, President Bush comes off as affably easygoing, primarily because James Adomian plays him as a mild-and-hazy guy, much like ... well, Harold and Kumar. (It will be interesting to see which of these comic constructs incites the most vehement condemnation from right-wing bloggers and commentators.)
Subtlety isn't the strong point of this free-wheeling farrago written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, scripters of the previous "Harold & Kumar" opus. Most of the gags are almost entirely apolitical, and some of the biggest laughs are generated by brazenly gratuitous nudity, sniggering sexual activity and considerable consumption of illicit drugs, almost all of it with amusing consequences.
A similar what-the-hell attitude permeates the entire pic: While the production values are by no means sloppy, there is little sign anyone involved perceived slickness as a goal worth pursuing.
Here and there, however, the madcap zaniness and frat-house boisterousness are laced with something not unlike righteous rage about racial profiling, extraordinary rendition and government-authorized oppression. Auds will be left feeling that if characters as harmless as Harold and Kumar (engagingly replayed by Cho and Penn) can wind up unfairly imprisoned, even in the context of a broad comedy, something is terribly wrong with the system.
In its own wacky way, "Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay" is one of the ballsiest comedies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. No kidding.

It's been 20 years since Errol Morris  made The Thin Blue Line —a found "noir" that served to free an innocent man convicted of murder. Gathering evidence and dramatizing testimony, Morris's movie circled around a single, unrepresentable event—the death of a cop on a lonely stretch of Texas highway.
The Thin Blue Line  brooded on fate, illuminating the rules that govern a trial as a form of shared fantasy. But this masterpiece not only persuaded a judge to overturn the verdict, it apparently convinced its maker that 1) his penchant for people-collecting was an essentially political enterprise, and 2) the transparent reconstructions he used to illustrate the concept of a legal fiction were legitimate forms of documentary argument. Since The Thin Blue Line 's remarkable intervention, Morris's work has grown more public and more problematic—lofty yet snide, a form of know-it-all epistemological inquiry.
Standard Operating Procedure , Morris's film about a more recent crime, caps his atrocity trilogy. Mr. Death  (1999) offered a disturbingly facetious portrait of a "scientific" Holocaust denier; more sober, The Fog of War  (2004) presented that old devil Robert McNamara  with an all-too-human face, albeit allowing McNamara to put his own spin on his prosecution of the Vietnam  War. Standard  Operating Procedure  addresses Iraq—specifically, the infamous photographs of abused prisoners at Abu Ghraib  and the so-called bad apples who took them.
Morris doesn't use voiceover; he's a master at getting interviewees to pose certain questions on their own—like why did Abu Ghraib even exist? For one thing, this prison was where Saddam 's minions murdered 30,000 Iraqis. For another, it was located in a combat zone—and under frequent mortar attack. Common sense, if not common decency, would have suggested that the U.S. level this nightmare. Instead, as Morris's interviewees attest, Rumsfeld and his generals elected to "Gitmo -ize" the operation, torturing and otherwise brutalizing prisoners they dumped there—thus converting Abu Ghraib from Baathist  hell to international symbol of American occupation.
Standard Operating Procedure  is all about symbols. The Abu Ghraib images are hardly unfamiliar; Morris's mission is to interrogate them. How did these pictures come into existence? And what, if anything, do they reveal? The snapshots and videos are mainly annotated by interviews with four of the seven bad apples, all former MPs, as well as letters home written by the most diligent of the amateur photographers, Sabrina Harman . What emerges from this testimony—which also goes a bit up the chain of command to include Janis Karpinski , the former brigadier general who supposedly oversaw Abu Ghraib, and who has since been demoted—is the suggestion that whatever the CIA  was doing to extract dubious intelligence, the MPs were just entertaining themselves by producing their own show.
Bored, ignorant, and afraid, the bad apples were simply having fun. The prisoner photographed naked on all fours with a dog collar around his neck wasn't actually dragged by the leash. The hooded guy standing on a box, wires attached to his outstretched hands, was never really in any danger. These pictures were posed! For Morris, who seems skeptical that photographs can ever disclose anything, the issue is legalistic. Focusing only on the photographic evidence, he asks if these images prove the commission of criminal acts or simply illustrate what one MP calls "standard operating procedure"—that is, the acceptable methods of stress positioning, sleep deprivation, and the ordering of inmates to masturbate while wearing nothing but panties on their heads.
If there's a moral distinction, I must be too dense to grasp its significance. In either case, these photographs demonstrate the fascist thrill of dominating a helpless fellow human—although Sabrina says that hers were an intended exposé of prison conditions. (As evidence, however, they only served to send the bad apples to jail, while their superiors and the system that created Abu Ghraib went largely unscathed.) But whether one interprets these images as proof of torture or sadism or artistic expression, they attest to the gross objectification of the prisoners (who are scarcely less objectified in this film). The MPs may have given these men names—that's Gus on the leash and good ol' Gilligan on the box—but they were used as living props.
Credit where credit is due: By arranging Gilligan's mock crucifixion, Sabrina did create a poster boy for the Iraq  War. For his part, Morris fusses with the frame. He literalizes ghosts haunting the prison corridors. He introduces Gilligan with a flash of lightning. When one of Sabrina's letters makes reference to an exploding helicopter, the filmmaker obligingly visualizes it; he accentuates her account of finding a corpse in the shower with a low-angle shot of water exploding in super-slow motion from the showerhead. A description of dogs attacking naked prisoners is supplemented with close-ups of slavering hounds. This obtrusive mannerism is not only superfluous but, for a movie that aspires to be a critique of representation, bizarrely self-defeating.
Why so frantic? Does Morris fear that the faces, voices, and photographs he's assembled are insufficiently compelling to hold an audience? A vivid description of Fallujah 's nauseating stink doesn't require smell-o-vision to register. Is he, like his subjects, compelled to amuse? Diverting attention from the banality of his inquiry? Fielding questions after a screening at the Museum of Modern Art , the filmmaker blurted out an observation on the strength of Janis Karpinski's bladder—a non sequitur less revealing of her anxiety than his. Indeed, this admission exposed Morris's standard operating procedure: Attention must be paid—if not to the film, then at least to its maker.
