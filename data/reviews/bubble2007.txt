         The title of Israeli writer-director Eytan Fox's new film, "The Bubble," is a pejorative reference to youthful myopia, namely in the trendy Sheiken Street district in modern Tel Aviv, where twentysomething progressivism may feel more like a cool romantic spirit than something politically urgent.
 
 For the trio of mixed-orientation roommates -- romantically volatile T-shirt designer Lulu (Daniela Wircer), flamboyant cafe manager Yali (Alon Friedmann) and soft-spoken record store worker Noam (Ohad Knoller) -- who share a cramped apartment and a sexy liberal lifestyle, the Palestinian-Israeli crisis bites, but a turbulent love affair or bad taste in music is more likely to provoke an endless discussion.
 


         






   Of course, with a title like "The Bubble," something is going to burst, and it starts when Noam falls for Ashraf (Yousef "Joe" Sweid), a sweet-faced Palestinian man he first met as a weekend reservist on checkpoint duty. Spurred by the notion that Ashraf would rather stay in their love-one-love-all clique than with his conservative family in Nablus -- where his sister is set to marry a militant member of Hamas -- the three get him a Hebrew name and a job at Yali's restaurant and include him in their plans to throw an anti-occupation rave at the beach.
 
 Ashraf and Noam love each other, but as Ashraf's particular pressures mount -- being gay in a homophobic Arab culture, feeling caught between two nations, but perhaps more urgently needing to avoid capture as an undocumented Arab -- he starts to withdraw, and suddenly the frisky idealism of Noam and his friends begins to feel like a dangerous cluelessness.
 
 In one sharply conveyed sequence, Lulu and Noam pretend to be credentialed French journalists so they can get through a checkpoint and look in on a scared Ashraf hibernating in his Arab community. Although their ruse threatens to expose Ashraf's double life, their demeanor is that of role-playing children on a lark.
 
 Content to flit between light comedy, eroticism and relationship operatics for much of the time, director Fox -- whose previous films include the controversial gay Israeli soldier tale "Yossi & Jagger" -- gives his beautiful dreamers plenty of leeway to win us over. To that end, he's assembled a vibrant, brimming cast and given the talented Sweid a role that brings out all that is liberating and terrifying about a conflicted soul trapped in an ancient standoff.
 
 It's only when "The Bubble" takes a swift turn into domino-tipping tragedy in the final act that a tender, fraught love story feels casually discarded in favor of something psychologically pat and ham-fistedly earth-shattering. Ironically, for an otherwise engaging look at where politics and the personal confusedly intersect for a generation of youth trying their best to keep the grimmer realities of their world at bay, it's the only real false note.

 Vacillating provocatively between romantic comedy and political tragedy, “The Bubble” is photographed with a sunny brightness that belies the gravity of its intentions.  Set primarily in the fashionable Sheinkin Street district of Tel Aviv, the story follows  three   left-leaning 20-somethings  (two men and a woman) whose notion of political action is to hold a “rave against the occupation.” But when Noam (Ohad Knoller), a sweet-natured music-store clerk  and  reserve soldier, meets a handsome Palestinian named Ashraf (Yousef Sweid), their escalating affair forces everyone to face reality in the cruelest possible way.  Squeezing a lot of conflict — sexual, ethnic and intellectual — into its 117 minutes, “The Bubble” is about the appeal of self-delusion and the warmth of comfort zones. Noam’s best friend, Yali (Alon Friedmann),  a cafe manager, reproaches Noam for habitually  choosing unavailable men yet denies his own attraction to casually aggressive partners.  Meanwhile, Ashraf’s fond sister (Roba Blal) and her future husband,  a Hamas leader aptly named Jihad (Shredy Jabarin), negate Ashraf’s homosexuality by coercing him into a straight relationship.  Eytan Fox directs with compassion but also with impatience for his characters’ self-centered naïveté, veering somewhat uneasily between these tones and relying on the competence of his actors to smooth the transitions. And though his ending is more poetic than just,  it effectively diverts partisan sympathies toward a more general condemnation of violence.  Mr. Fox may be a romantic, but he understands that love is rarely all you need.

Again finding reflection of moral and political issues in the minidramas of everyday Israeli youth, Eytan Fox delivers another involving tale in "The Bubble." The last-act credibility strain that marred "Walk on Water" resurfaces here, however, and that plus a somewhat lighter, diffuse seriocomic focus make this less satisfying overall than "Water" or the helmer's breakthrough "Yossi & Jagger." Pic should follow their path to wide international exposure, though critical support may be more qualified.
Title refers to cosmopolitan Tel Aviv and, in particular, the hip Sheikin St. district, a "bubble" in which Westernized urban-hipster flavor can seem wholly removed from the racial and religious conflicts raging a few miles away. Three twentysomething flatmates are more concerned with dating and gossip than weightier issues.
Lulu (Daniela Wircer) works in a perfume shop and hopes withholding sexual favors from her latest b.f. (a magazine editor) might give their relationship some legs.
Her roomies are two gay men: Tall, bitchy Yali (Alon Friedmann)and earnest Noam (Ohad Knoller, in a very different mode from macho "Yossi") who's just back from a reserve-duty stint at an army checkpoint. There, he met young Ashraf (Yousef "Joe" Sweid) during an unpleasant incident where a hard-assed officer's search of several Palestinians led to a woman's miscarriage. Distressing though these introductory circumstances are, Ashraf and Noam connect, later meeting in Tel Aviv and falling into an immediate if casual live-in relationship -- Yali even gets the newcomer a job at his cafe, despite barely concealed jealousy and Ashraf's lack of an Israeli work permit.
Lulu and Noam are involved in a young anti-occupation group whose activities don't seem to extend far beyond mounting a "Rave for Peace" unlikely to draw a crowd more diverse than the usual local Israeli lefties. When they hand out fliers on the street, however, they get a sobering dose of mainstream opinion. Another reality check is provided when Ashraf, in danger of being reported as a Palestinian without necessary documentation, has to flee back home to Nablus on short notice. There, his sister is about to marry a man active in Hamas, whose views on homosexuality are not accommodating.
As in prior films, Fox's greatest strength lays in conveying genuine affection between youthful lovers and friends, which in turn lends eventual cruel twists of fate greater poignancy. But for all its appealing performances and persuasive individual scenes, "The Bubble" makes an uneven impression. Early half-hearted stab at balancing focus between the three roommates lends the pic a somewhat routine, almost frivolous romantic-comedy air, with Lulu and Yali's own romantic travails generating just modest interest. And climactic events that push the central gay Israeli-Palestinian pairing toward predictable tragedy feel over-contrived and psychologically less than credible.
Once again, Fox has heavily weighted the soundtrack with pop faves, in this case reflecting Noam's penchant for the Smiths, Belle & Sebastian, and other indie stars. Tech aspects are OK, though a bit more stylishness from Yaron Scharf's lensing wouldn't have hurt.

Had Israeli director Eytan Fox 's new film, about a passionate affair between two men on opposite sides of the Israeli-Arab conflict, been released in the early 1970s (when I was the same age as its twentysomething hipsters and living in Tel Aviv ), the movie would have attracted a smattering of furtive admirers in the peace movement and the tightly closeted gay community. Almost everyone else in what was then a homophobic society, riddled with anti-Arab sentiment after the Six Day War (and on the cusp of the Yom Kippur War), would have thrown rotten tomatoes.
Today, The Bubble which has fairly explicit scenes of gay sex between a young Jew and a Palestinian from the occupied territoriesis a local hit that's also proudly flagged on the New York Israel  Consul's website. Whether this means that Israel has grown more tolerant, or just more heterogeneous and steeped in Western pop culture, is an open question. But in Fox, an openly gay, American-born Jew who moved to Israel as a child, Israeli youth has found an enthusiastic killer of sacred cows whose movies happen to play like strung-together episodes of Friends . His is the voice of the new Israel hedonistic, narcissistic, yet also more innovative and accepting than the generation of ideologues who founded the state.
Already known in this country for his terrific 2004 thriller Walk on Water  and for the gay army love story Yossi & Jagger , Fox, with his long-time partner and co-writer Gal Uchovsky, makes slickly commercial Westernized dramedies whose sexual politics come inflected with a woozy pacifism that has brought him international attention and a reach well beyond gay moviegoers. Like his urban-chic protagoniststhree Tel Aviv roommates trying to shut out war by living in an escapist "bubble" of personal fulfillmentFox has eagerly absorbed the tropes of American situation comedy and reality television. But again like his characters, Fox knows that eventually the cocoon must tear: There's no escaping war or politics for long in Israel, where a suicide bomber can turn the trendiest watering hole into a hellhole in seconds.
Fox is a smooth filmmaker, but no one would call him a subtle one. The three roomiesNoam (Ohad Knoller ), a sensitive music-store clerk who unwillingly mans a checkpoint in the West Bank  on weekends; Yali (Alon Friedmann ), a soft-hearted queen who runs an upscale café with two beautiful lesbians; and Lulu (Daniela Wircer ), a mouthy nymph with the obligatory faulty taste in menwouldn't look out of place on a poster for The Hills . Barely has Noam laid eyes on Ashraf a handsome innocent from the occupied town of Nablus , who slips in and out of Tel Aviv without papersthan the two of them are going at it in Noam's bed. Before you can say jeux interdits , Noam's roommates bestow a Hebrew name on Ashraf (played by Yousef Sweid, a Christian Israeli Arab), spiff up his wardrobe, haul him off to a performance of Bent , and invite him to a rave for peace on the beach.
The scenario isn't entirely far-fetched (Sweid himself lives with an up-and-coming Israeli woman director), and in the current desolate climate, just about any warm contact between Jews and Arabs is cause for breaking out the bubbly. But if The Bubble 's bouncy joie de vivreit's a musical without the numbersis infectious, the trio's adoption of Ashraf is laced with a whiff of condescension that the director himself doesn't seem to see. And the subplot that unfolds on the other side of the checkpoint, where Ashraf's sister Rana (Ruba Blal ) is about to marry a rabid Islamic fundamentalist with the pointed name of Jihad, seems all too tidy. Still, Fox is as fearless in tackling Arab homophobia and hatred of Jews as he is frank about the Israeli army 's brutality.
About forbidden love he may be a hopeless romantic, but Fox also has the hopeless romantic's propensity for dystopia when idealism fails. Given the upbeat, tender rhythms of the movie's love story, the climaxa cry of bottomless despaircomes as a profound shock. It's meant to, and though the ending is touched by the goofy absurdities of melodrama, Fox's mix-and-match sampling of apparently incompatible genres nails the nervous blend of vitality and desperation that is Israel today.
