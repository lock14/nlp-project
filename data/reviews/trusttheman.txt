The cruelest moment in the intolerably smug relationship comedy ``Trust the Man" is very brief and probably accidental. A montage of Manhattan locales kicks off the movie, and one shot features the Cinema Village marquee, which announces that ``Funny Ha Ha," ``The Best of Youth," and ``Walk on Water" are playing. Those are movies from a recent yesteryear (ah, 2005
), and if they don't mean anything to you, you're much better off making their acquaintance than spending a minute with this new film.
That's a shame , because any movie with Julianne Moore, Maggie Gyllenhaal, David Duchovny, and Billy Crudup is one you want to say something nice about. Alas, ``Trust the Man," written and directed by Moore's husband, Bart Freundlich , leaves you feeling stingy with compliments. This is a movie that's built around characters the audience is bound to find more insufferable than anyone does in the movie itself.
Moore and Duchovny play Rebecca and Tom. They've been together for years. She's a well-known actress; he's just her husband. By his own estimation, he used to be somebody, but he recently left his lofty perch in advertising and is beginning to go stir-crazy as a stay-at-home dad. Tom's best friend is Rebecca's younger brother Tobey (Crudup), who lives with Elaine (Gyllenhaal).
Tom and Tobey are screw-ups. Tom starts contriving play dates with the flirty divorced mom whose kid is in his son's class. When Elaine wants Tobey to drive her somewhere, he tells her he can't. He says he needs to move the car out of its current parking space and into another one somewhere else on the block. (She asks him while he's watching ``Sports-Center." Shame on her!)
These are the kind of men who'll ogle a woman together in a restaurant while their partners are sitting across the table. And ``Trust the Man" is the sort of movie that wants you to find that a little bit charming. But how does one love such morons?
Eventually, both men's relationships hit the rocks -- or, rather, each man crashes his relationship into a tree. Watching them try to redeem themselves is embarrassing -- for the flailing men, the pitiful women who consider taking them back, and us. Freundlich probably didn't set out to chart new territory in the inexhaustible conversation between women and men. But the movie hasn't any insight or perception or imagination to enrich it. There are no epiphanies or surprises, just tired scenarios with American movies' favorite character trend: hapless men, unmoored and crude. (``Honey, it looks like I finally digested that corn!" Tobey announces.)
As Freundlich's presumable stand-in, Duchovny is unappetizing. Crudup is worse because he plays the part without a trace of believable humanity. I don't need to like a character in a movie, but I do need not to want to kill him. Together, these two seem to be playing sketches of the filmmaker's guilty id. With less notable casting, ``Trust the Man" could have been an episode of ``The King of Queens" or ``Yes Dear": mediocre marital fairy tales in which wives forgive their disappointing Neanderthal husbands.
In one of the single worst scenes in any movie this year, Elaine brings her new German lover (Glenn Fitzgerald) to Tom and Rebecca's for dinner, where Tobey is ready to snipe. The German, humorless and clad in tight black, is steadily mocked for seeming like the Dieter character in those ``Saturday Night Live" ``Sprockets" sketches. Later , in an adjoining bedroom, Elaine and Tobey argue about the German's penis size. Obviously, the walls are thin enough for everybody else to overhear and almost spit out their wine.
Is this farce, drama, satire? Who knows? Whatever Freundlich is up to, none of it is very convincing. This is the third time he's worked with his wife, but their previous movies, ``The Myth of Fingerprints" and ``World Traveler," are a lot less exasperating. In ``Trust the Man" the filmmaker appears to be both airing the laundry of his marriage to a famous actress and looking for validation as a talent in his own right. Instead, we're left thinking Moore has married a hack.


         Two New York couples work through their issues in Bart Freundlich's bizarrely off-key "Trust the Man," which stars Julianne Moore as a famous actress named Rebecca, whose husband, Tom (David Duchovny), a former copywriter turned porn-obsessed house-husband, cheats on her with a vamp from his mommy group. Tom is best friends with Rebecca's brother Tobey (Billy Crudup), who is having trouble committing to her pal Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal) after seven years of cohabitation. Elaine wants a baby, Tobey wants to be a baby. So you see the problems.
 
 Therapy could help, but Rebecca and Tom's counselor (Garry Shandling in a turtleneck and a single-scene part) appears to lean toward the aroma variety, and anyway they visit him only once a year, mostly so they can make cute jokes about that. Tobey, meanwhile, fixates on his car, his parking space and his newly married but still-interested ex-girlfriend (Eva Mendes), in that order. Eventually, Elaine gets sick of waiting around for him and hooks up with an amusing Eastern European who wears turtlenecks and talks funny.
 


         






   Underlying this teetering pile of complications is an upscale urban fantasy, set in an exquisitely curated Manhattan. The movie theater is playing "Funny Ha Ha" and "Kings and Queen." The bakery is Magnolia. The restaurant is Da Silvano. When Tom agrees to accompany the sexy divorced mommy (you know she's both by the way her lips recall a beached trout at all times) on an ice cream date with the kids, they take their scoops at Serendipity. Even an incidental street lunatic comes across as a colorful accessory. Watching "Trust the Man" is like walking around a gentrified neighborhood, taking in the heavily branded authenticity designed to reference what used to be there and becoming very confused.
 
 For about the first two-thirds, the movie drifts aimlessly from gag to gag, as its characters lunch, shop, host highly improbable dinner parties where Tom and Tobey get to make fun of the gay and foreign guests (which is cool, because everybody knows how pretentious gay and foreign people can be, especially in New York, especially when one's wife is a world-renowned thespian) and otherwise putter around the city wrapped in a flattering mist of self-absorption.
 
 Then out of nowhere the whole thing takes a flying leap into romantic-comedy land, culminating in a ludicrous scene at Lincoln Center. It wouldn't be a romantic comedy, don't you know, if the ladies weren't won back in the most antic and public manner possible or if there weren't a large audience on hand to applaud the heedless lovers. Sure, it's hard to imagine this particular theater-going crowd cooing sympathetically at this sort of romantic extroversion, but by then you'll have long since stopped expecting internal logic.
 
 The actors gamely keep up their spirits, but the male characters are too one-dimensional and the female characters too bizarrely divorced from reality to be at all engaging. Elaine's romantic ingenuousness knows no bounds. Not only does she let Tobey talk her into submitting her children's book manuscript with a snapshot of herself in a bikini, she can't connect one dot with another when interest is quickly expressed. At one point, Rebecca decides to set up Elaine with an old boyfriend of hers, a cheeseball folk singer-minister perfectly captured by James LeGros, who nails the urban outdoorsy horny spiritual leader type (you know you know one). But rather than pick him apart, Freundlich has the girls take him at face value. They giggle and make isn't-he-great faces at each other as he bows in Elaine's direction and generally makes a highly amusing fool of himself. When she chides herself for not bowing back, though, it's all you can do to keep from falling over.

Don't hate them because they're beautiful. On second thought, go right ahead: The attractive quartet at the center of the blithely self-involved relationship comedy Trust the Man  live lives of such comfortable, unoriginal neurosis that forbearance isn't an option; how about pies in the face?
Rebecca (Julianne Moore), a famous actress, withholds sex from her husband, Tom (David Duchovny), a loving stay-at-home father to the couple's two delightful children. Rebecca's boyish brother, Tobey (Billy Crudup), refuses to commit to aspiring novelist Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal), his longtime girlfriend. Can these banal relationships between undifferentiated lovelies be saved? Spoiler: Sure. But how to pad the waiting time? Perhaps with Woody Allen's oeuvre in mind, writer-director Bart Freundlich  himself married to Moore  offers Eva Mendes as a distraction for Crudup, James Le Gros as a comic foil for Gyllenhaal, Garry Shandling and Bob Balaban as ineffectual shrinks, and Ellen Barkin as a predatory lesbian publisher. Off on a maiden comedy adventure after his broody pieces The Myth of Fingerprints  and World Traveler , he can't resist a standard disastrous dinner-party set piece. And he throws in a stale psychobabble scene in which Tom attends a self-help meeting of sex addicts. But the wheel-spinning is evident in a story line that meanders from one swell Manhattan location to another, with little necessity. And, apparently, the actors had such a great time that one ending wasn't enough. Trust me, this movie's got many.

 First impressions count, even in film. That helps explain why an opening credit sequence that invokes Woody Allen’s “Manhattan,” though without the shimmering imagery (or the eventual payoff of midcareer Allen) is a bad idea. It also explains why opening a film with a small child straining on a toilet and talking about poop isn’t just a bad idea; it’s an invitation to unfortunate metaphor.  Thus “Trust the Man” is a strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, only one of which proves of interest to its writer and director, Bart Freundlich, perhaps because the woman in that couple is played by his own wife, Julianne Moore. She’s Rebecca, a film actress about to take the theatrical plunge at Lincoln Center. Rebecca is married to Tom (David Duchovny), who has ditched a lucrative advertising gig to trundle their little girl around town and flirt with a single mother lurking at his son’s school. Rebecca and Tom live in a West Village townhouse filled with light and tasteful appointments. Every so often they have sex; once a year they visit a therapist (Garry Shandling, having fun). They’re vaguely dissatisfied and crushingly dull.  Rebecca and Tom need our love to work as characters, but their kind of self-love leaves no room for outsiders. What it does leave room for are her brother, Tobey (Billy Crudup), and his girlfriend, Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the couple’s unmarried best friends who are experiencing their own relationship pains partly because she seems to hear her biological clock ticking and partly because he’s a jerk.  Elaine and Tobey are in meltdown because Mr. Freundlich subscribes to the theory that every Lucy-and-Ricky needs its Ethel-and-Fred, a cruder version of itself to mirror its ecstasies and agonies, no matter how banal. To that end, Elaine and Tobey ape their better-groomed pals while screeching and rattling the cage in which Mr. Freundlich has placed them. He also lights them badly.  Ms. Moore is nicely lighted, but she too is poorly served by Mr. Freundlich’s unfunny, unfocused screenplay, which basically stitches together a series of short scenes of four people whining in various combinations. Throughout the whining, Tom wears a small, amused smile that suggests he’s in on some cosmic joke, though it may just be that Mr. Duchovny knows that when you play what looks like the director’s surrogate you can’t help but come out ahead. Tom makes his wife weep, a little, and doesn’t share her limelight, but he turns out to be a great guy with hidden talents just waiting to be revealed. The final scene is meant to show those talents in full bloom, but everything that has come before suggests they died on the vine.  It makes you wonder why anyone bothered. Like a lot of American films made under the rubric of independence, “Trust the Man” lacks urgency and purpose; you never get a sense of why this story had to be made, much less shared. With its loud noises and costly effects, the typical Hollywood blockbuster at least tries to sell itself (and more films like it) to the audience.  “Trust the Man,” on the other hand, assumes that it has something the audience wants to buy. It’s an assumption that leaves a lot of talented actors hanging, the exception being James Le Gros, who makes a very funny, regrettably brief appearance as a would-be Lothario who turns a rueful caress of his mustache into an epic of smut.    “Trust the Man” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some adult language and suggestive scenes.

For those who appreciate the Woody Allen view of New York but would prefer fewer neurotics, "Trust the Man" provides a loving take on bourgeois Manhattan contentment that's usually only found in episodes of "Will & Grace." Unfortunately in this New York, no crisis is insurmountable, and no upscale downtown restaurant is deprived of product placement. Fox Searchlight will have to put in overtime to counter what will undoubtedly be fatal word of mouth, despite some very decent performances.
With characters who are far more endowed with problems than personality, writer-director Bart Freundlich's carousel of domestic angst stars his wife, Julianne Moore, as Rebecca, a celebrated film actress who's taken on a stage play at Lincoln Center. Her husband, Tom (David Duchovny), has assumed, apprehensively, the role of house husband in charge of their two kids.
The obvious dramatic fodder in such a setup is obscured by a Freundlich's penchant for easy jokes and painfully glib repartee between Rebecca and Tom -- and between Rebecca's brother, Tobey (Billy Crudup), and Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Elaine is a would-be children's author who wants children, and Tobey's a lay about who has turned alternate-side-of-the-street parking into a full-time job.
Crudup is the only cast member who really grabs his part -- and he also has the best lines. Tobey is happily askew to real life and expresses sincere disbelief that any one should expect anything of him, including Elaine.
Tom, on the other hand, is not unhappy in his fatherly duties, but would like a bit more bedroom attention from Rebecca.
The cinematography by Tim Orr ("George Washington," "Raising Victor Vargas") is first rate, as are the costumes by Michael Clancy, but the surfaces are so glossy they counteract the indie flavor that Freundlich ("The Myth of Fingerprints") is trying so hard to achieve.
While other recent films, notably "Half Nelson," have used New York with visual originality, "Trust the Man" is the city as envisioned by the same people who came up with "I Love NY."
The closing scenes of "Trust the Man" are so contrived and madcap, the viewer fully expects someone to start throwing pies. That they don't is a disappointment, all things considered.

David Duchovny  and Julianne Moore  play a married couple on the downside of their vows. He's a former ad man who's now a stay-at-home daddy, and she's a movie actress stooping to conquer the Lincoln Center  stage. She's lost all sexual interest in Tom, to the point where she flinches if he so much as touches her. Writer-director Bart Freundlich (Moore's husband) has nothing to say and nowhere to go with this material, except to the most contrived ending this side of a Will & Grace  episode. His characters don't mean anything because they don't say anything or do anything that feels rooted in the nitty-gritty of the everyday. They're stock schmucks and little moreunlikable twerps who don't earn or deserve their happily ever afters.
