 The mad and the sane take a leisurely spin around the dance floor in the Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer’s “Lunacy.” With thematic nods to Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade, this feature-length phantasmagoria relates the Mad Hatter adventures of a young man, Jean Berlot (Pavel Liska), who, on meeting an aristocrat simply called the Marquis (Jan Triska), tumbles down a very strange rabbit hole. But before this happens, the filmmaker appears, talking into the camera and cautioning (or, rather, taunting) us that what we are about to see is not art, but a horror film, with all the “degeneracy peculiar to that genre.”  Those seeking the usual charnel-house cheap thrills characteristic of so much modern horror will be disappointed; Mr. Svankmajer’s provocations skew toward the intellectual and the shivery rather than the pop and the visceral, and at his best, he doesn’t just get under your skin, but also deep in your head, too. Here, unfortunately, he does neither, despite some marvelous stop-motion animated sequences involving a literal moveable feast of severed animal tongues, loose eyeballs and errant brains. These peripatetic parts interrupt, though not often enough, the main event, which involves Jean playing horrified, seemingly captive witness to the Marquis’s elaborate follies, one of which is borrowed from Poe’s famous short story “The Premature Burial,” some of which are borrowed from Sade, though without the really nasty bits.  In the prologue Mr. Svankmajer states that “Lunacy” owes its “blasphemy and subversiveness” to Sade, by which he probably and principally means the scene in which the Marquis unleashes a harangue against God, while some half-dozen seminude actors execute a tame pantomime. Despite a little rough business with an effigy on a cross, this awkward tableau doesn’t seem all that blasphemous, particularly in view of artists like Andres Serrano, who have helped drain words like subversive of meaning. Luis Buñuel pulled off a better trick 40 years ago, and with more economy, by posing Catherine Deneuve as St. Sebastian and flinging mud at her in “Belle de Jour.” Though the reason Buñuel succeeded so brilliantly and enduringly is that he blasphemed a bigger modern god, that of celebrity.  To its advantage, “Lunacy” owes less to Sade and more to Poe, in particular the humorous story “The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.” Soon after making the acquaintance of the Marquis, Jean arrives at an asylum where the inmates and their keepers may have switched places, amid clouds of chicken feathers and lots of cackling (and clucking). Mr. Svankmajer hits his point too hard, though happily he also regularly sets loose those errant animal parts, which combine to create a shadow narrative that easily trumps the live-action sequences. As it happens, a pinch of Sade and a whiff of blasphemy are nothing compared with a cluster of brains crawling out of some tin cans like fugitives,  or a detached tongue creeping along a wall like an inchworm.

What could be more natural than cult helmer Jan Svankmajer pairing the poetic twins of decadence, Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade? Combining live action with the Czech director's wondrously inventive brand of animation, "Lunacy" is billed as a horror film, "with all the degeneracy of the genre," but refuses simple straight jacketing. Pic's real subject is Sade's exploration of freedom versus control, and while the Marquis of Perversion still works better on paper than celluloid, "Lunacy" has much to say about modern society. Arthouse travel is assured, and previous fans won't be disappointed.
Who is truly free, and who is truly mad are the questions asked, in a setting mixing 18th century trappings with contempo locations. Naive Jean Berlot (Pavel Liska) is on his way to an insane asylum where his mother has died. Plagued by recurring nightmares of men in white coats, Jean's nocturnal outbursts attract the attention of fellow traveler the Marquis (Jan Triska), who offers the hapless man a lift.
Hesitantly accepting the strange aristocrat's hospitality, Jean spies his host conducting a debauched orgy in a chapel, with an obviously unwilling Charlotte (Anna Geislerova) being forced to participate.
The following day the Marquis apparently expires in a fit of apoplexy, and is buried by Jean and mute servant Dominic (Pavel Novy). But the following morning the master enjoys a banquet in the crypt. The Marquis explains his theory of "purgative therapy": He feared being buried alive, so to rid himself of the phobia he had himself entombed.
The Marquis suggests Jean commit himself to end his fears of madness.
Edgar Allan Poe's frequently pilfered tale "The Premature Burial" serves as a key plot device, but Svankmajer simply uses it to lend atmosphere to his exploration of Sade's questioning of good and evil, asking auds to consider whether theories of freedom or harsh discipline function as equally repressive measures.
In glorious counterpoint are the strange animation sequences, full of cavorting raw meat, pig's trotters, eyeballs and, especially tongues, skittering along surfaces. More moving animal parts and less human pontificating would make a stronger case for a tale already rich in imagery. Another drawback is Liska, too one-dimensional to stand against Triska's overpowering performance.
Print screened in Rotterdam was often too dark, especially in the mausoleum scene when animated pigs' brains emerging from tin cans should have been more deliciously defined.

Connoisseurs of the disgustingly visceral will find Jan Svankmajer  hardly mellowed at 72. Lunacy  is dark, scary, and yuckyeven by the Czech animator's own standards.
Svankmajer is the last true surrealist and, as such, has little interest in making "art." (He animates objects; alchemy is more his line.) By way of a prologue, Svankmajer appears on-screen to warn that Lunacy  is no aesthetic exercise. Rather, it's a tract on the treatment of insanity, couched as an "infantile tribute" to Edgar Allen Poe  and the Marquis de Sade .
"La Marseillaise" blares and Lunacy 's luckless protagonist Jean Berlot (Pavel Liska ) suffers through a recurring dream in which two demonic attendants burst into his bedchamber to bung him off to bedlam. (Jean is betrayed by his shirt, which slithers off its chair to unlatch the door.) Given his violent responsesetting the room on firethe nightmare proves prophetic.
Another guest at the inn, namely the Marquis de Sade, takes the unstable young man under his protection. This does not inspire confidence (the Marquis is a capricious cynic with an obnoxious braying laugh), and the evening's entertainment chez Sadea black mass and prank premature burialdoes little to wipe the terror from Jean's face. It does, however, prompt his voluntary commitment to a madhouse administered according to a tolerant, Sadean regime.
Treatment includes wildly regressive "art therapy" (with the filmmaker among the patients) and, like the historical Sade, Svankmajer's Marquis casts the mad in theatrical presentations. A tableaux of Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" overstimulates the lunatics to assault their comely nurse Charlota, posed as bare-breasted Liberty, in an inmate revolt parodying the romantic schoolboy insurrection in Jean Vigo's quasi-surrealist Zéro de Conduite. Absolute freedom is followed by control and punishment: An authoritarian doctor escapes the asylum basement to seize power and Jean is further disillusioned when Charlota turns out just as depraved as the Marquis predicted.
Blatantly anachronistic, Lunacy  conflates 18th-century wigs with 21st-century bus tours and is actually two movies: Jean's misadventures are punctuated by hurdy-gurdy-scored, stop-motion interludes in which slabs of raw meatmainly wagging tonguesslither into glasses, scuttle through the mud, and crawl back to the maws of the bleached cow skulls that once housed them. Lunacy may be an ideological argument, but this cavorting, copulating chorus of mindless meat puppets provides the full Svankmajer flavoras well as a comic metaphor for human existence itself.
