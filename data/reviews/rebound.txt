As predictable as a sunrise, this Mighty Ducks/Bad News Bears
 clone is also entirely inoffensive, lacking even the most basic profanities and sophomoric japes usually associated with Martin Lawrence. As such, it�s a ready cinematic babysitter for harried moms and dads who need some weekend downtime detox from the brood. (Never mind that the kids are sure to theatre-hop on over to War of the Worlds
 as soon as their �rents are out of sight.) Lawrence plays Roy McCormick, a legendary college basketball coach who�s more interested in resting on his laurels and signing lucrative endorsement deals than he is in shepherding his team to victory. Saddled with an anger-management problem and an ego roughly the size of Eddie Murphy�s salary circa The Nutty Professor
, McCormick is served with a lifetime coaching ban after an on-court meltdown that results in the demise of the opposing team�s animal mascot. All is not lost, however, as his sleazy manager (Meyer) discovers a loophole in the NCAA rules that allows his charge one more shot at coaching. The catch is that the only team that will hire him is that of his old junior high school, a team so bad and ill-trained they only have five players, archetypes all. There�s Ralph (Lawrence), who throws up every time he gets jittery; One Love (Martin), a pint-sized Dennis Rodman-in-the-making; fat kid Fuzzy (Logan McElroy); Goggles (Gus Hoffman), whose face is a magnet for wayward foul balls; and the genuinely talented Keith (Williams), whose mother (Robinson) also happens to be the school�s resident sexpot teacher. Eager to please his NCAA overlords, McCormick revamps and reschools the team into a quicksilver dynamo, adding gangsta girl Big Mac (Correa) and introverted, gawky, 6-foot-2-inch Wes (Parker) to the mix, all the while unleashing his team�s inner sporting superstars and wooing Mrs. Robinson. It will arrive as a surprise only to those whose last cinema outing sported a piano player down front that McCormick�s new team comes out on top, as does his romance and his injured sense of fair play. What makes Rebound
 palatable is the film�s young cast, who are given fully developed characters to work within and some genuinely affecting moments of gymnasium pathos. Correa and Parker are particularly well-drawn characters, and their unexpected puppy love comes across not as a cynical addendum to the storyline but as a natural outgrowth of their yin and yang personalities. Rebound
 is never really much more than what it would appear, but director Carr, who helmed the similarly predictable Daddy Day Care
, keeps things moving, both on and off the court, with the sort of light, sweet humor you�re not likely to find in too many other summer movies.


In ''Rebound," Martin Lawrence plays Roy McCormick, a conceited basketball coach who deigns to train a team of middle school pipsqueaks after a freak tantrum during a game results in his expulsion from college sports. The kids are grossly unskilled, though not for long. The movie, meanwhile, remains painless but dull throughout.
Coach Roy winds up at his alma mater, a hapless underfunded public school, whose wry principal (Megan Mullally) is all too happy to have him. But the music teacher and mother of one of the players (Wendy Raquel Robinson) voices her objections: He's a maniac who could go off on the kids. So the principal has the concerned parent mind the crazy coach.
As it happens, Coach Roy isn't nuts, he's lazy, sending the kids playing for the Mt. Vernon Smelters into competition sinfully unprepared. While they shoot bricks, he reads the newspaper, having been unaware that that particular afternoon was indeed a game day. But his lax attitude in his new job is ruining any shot he has at regaining his old job in the college ranks. It's not until those prospective job offers dry up and his complimentary Escalade is repossessed that Coach Roy catches some Smelters spirit.
If only it were contagious. ''Rebound" is about as unmotivated as Coach Roy, doing nothing to distinguish itself from any other movie ever made about winless teams that learn to stop losing.
The movie takes care of any significant obstacles to triumph. The Smelters go from scoreless games to blowouts with amazing ease. Everything here comes easily. The movie could have had a much better time building the otherwise predictable romantic tension between Lawrence and the expressive Robinson, who could have a long career as the new Sheryl Lee Ralph. But the writing doesn't break a sweat trying. He's single. So is she.
It's the kids that keep the film afloat. There are seven on the Smelters and two extremely enjoyable girls keeping stats and providing color commentary. None seems especially trained, though they take to their roles with charm and flailing arms. Tara Correa, the young lady who plays Big Mac, a juvie veteran and the team's sole girl, has a sweet and engagingly mischievous face. Even Steven Anthony Lawrence, the congested-looking boy who plays Ralph (a character who, couldn't you guess it, vomits a lot), overcomes a silly part with professionalism, which Steve Carr's clumsy direction sorely lacks.
Carr previously brought us such equally mediocre entertainments as ''Doctor Doolittle 2" and ''Daddy Day Care," Eddie Murphy vehicles that found the comedian stuck in a thankless PG phase. It's a less natural fit for Lawrence, who often looks bewildered. And he should: He's just not believable as a family-movie man.


         Ziad Doueiri's "Lila Says" is a lyrically graceful story of first love, between 19-year-old Chimo (Mohammed Khouas) and 16-year-old Lila (Vahina Giocante), who has just moved into Chimo's picturesque predominately Arab neighborhood in Marseilles, France. Chimo, who lives with his loving, elegant mother (Carmen Lebbos), has such promise as a writer that his teacher wants to send him to a special school in Paris, but he already sees himself as a loser, hanging out with his layabout pals and drifting into crime. That Chimo is handsome is not lost upon the beautiful, blond Lila, who also rightly discerns in him a sensitivity and intelligence totally lacking in his aggressively boorish friends.
 
  Lila has just discovered the power of her sexual attraction, and the diffident Chimo is the perfect target for her teasing and endless tales of outrageous sexual exhibitionism. Boldly confident, she captivates Chimo but is longer on talk than action. She is at the same time recklessly indifferent to her effect on Chimo's pals, especially his hot-headed best friend, Mouloud (Karim Ben Haddou), who is jealous of her zeroing in on Chimo.
 


         






    In what may well be genuine innocence, Lila is a surefire troublemaker, yet her ultimate influence on the real-life Chimo was to spur him on to writing the novel on which this captivating film is based. Raw, earthy yet tender and perceptive, "Lila Says" marks a strong directorial debut for Doueiri, who was Quentin Tarantino's camera operator on "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown."
 
 "Lila Says,"
 unrated. Blunt sex talk, some violence, adult themes. 1 hour, 29 minutes. At selected theaters.
 
 With 'Rebound,' it's best to pass
 
 
If I were 6, I could enjoy "Rebound" without thinking about all the better movies made from its concept. It wouldn't matter that the central character, an egomaniacal college basketball coach named Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence) is so preposterously immature that he wouldn't get past his first timeout in the real world. Coach Roy's tantrums and attention deficit issues make the grown-ups who run college basketball mad enough to put him on probation — which, in this case, means he can't coach any games until he proves himself worthy. But if he can't coach, how can he prove himself? The answer to this Catch-22 arrives in a faxed cry for help from a middle school where Roy once starred as a player but whose team hasn't scored so much as a foul shot since the first Bush administration. Lawrence wants to make this his "Daddy Day Care," but he insists on hogging the ball, showing off in a small but annoying turn as Preacher Don, whose appearance has no plot function except to let the star play dress-up. If I were 6, it wouldn't matter. But I'm not, and it does.

 "Rebound,"
 PG for mild language and thematic elements. 1 hour, 33 minutes. In general release.
 
 Getting personal with the Wagners
 
 
For "The Talent Given Us" writer-director Andrew Wagner persuaded his parents, Judy and Allen Wagner, and his actress sisters, Maggie and Emily, to play themselves pretty much, and no doubt the film means much to him as a means of expressing affection and strengthening family bonds. It's difficult, though, to see how this picture — essentially chronicling a long car trip — could mean much to anyone but the Wagners and their friends and relatives.
 
 "The Talent Given Us,"
 unrated. Blunt language involving sex; adult themes. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd. (323) 848-3500.
 
 Zombie tedium
 
 
Peter and Michael Spierig's "Undead" is an ambitious but murky and overlong zombie picture that borrows motifs from "Night of the Living Dead," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "ET" and other movies. However visually striking, this Australian film is ultimately as tedious as it is derivative.
 
 "Undead,"
 rated R for strong violence and gore, and for language (standard zombie horror blood and guts). 1 hour, 40 minutes. Nuart through Thursday, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd. (310) 281-8223.   

It is a far more subdued Martin Lawrence we have before us in Rebound , mellower than the one who bounced around the Bad Boys  movies. Here he brings a sedate (at times sedated-looking) touch to college hoops coach Roy McCormick, whose early-career wins have been obscured by bad behavior and endorsement-mongering (something the brand-dotted film itself doesn't exactly eschew). Barred indefinitely from the game, Roy opts for a high-concept redemption: In a cynical PR ploy, he finishes the season as coach of his old middle school team. Naturally, perfunctorily, he's won over by his scruffy squad of bad-news ballers. The whole thing feels like a half-day of community service, which Lawrence walks through good-naturedly.

 "Courage is just well-concealed fear," declares Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence), a disgraced basketball coach banned from the Ohio college circuit after throwing one too many tantrums on the court. This sensible word definition is offered to soothe a 13-year-old scaredy-cat  who plays for the Smelters, the downscale junior high school team that the newly humbled Roy is reduced to coaching.  His overnight transformation of a group of scraggly losers (often by scores of more than 100 to 0) who barely know the basics of the sport into potential champions is the paint-by-numbers story of the innocuous family comedy "Rebound." Short on laughs, if supremely inoffensive, this sleepy nonentity of a movie finds Mr. Lawrence in his huggable teddy bear mode. A mischief-making fire may glint at the corners of his eyes, but it remains safely contained behind a veneer of niceness.  "Rebound" is a children's sports movie that runs on almost no adrenaline. Although it's about competition, energetically speaking, it can't get with the program. At times the movie, directed by Steve Carr, seems so bored with itself that it dozes off while still on its feet.  The gentle humor occasionally ripples up from the collision of pubescent stereotypes, who behave more like 8-year-olds than middle schoolers. Most of the jokes revolve around two useful oddballs recruited by Roy. The first to join, Big Mac (Tara Correa), is the only girl on the team and by far its most aggressive member. A stocky, pugnacious tomboy with the temper of a pit bull, she is failing at math until the other new recruit, Wes (Steven Christopher Parker), a geeky, 6-foot-2 bookworm, begins to tutor her. Pit Bull and Bean Pole develop a case of puppy love.  For good measure, "Rebound" is obliged to throw in some adult puppy love as well. Roy has eyes for Jeanie Ellis (Wendy Raquel Robinson), the attractive single mother of the Smelters' best player, Keith (Oren Williams). But to get a date, he has to jump through hoops to prove he's no longer a selfish, tantrum-throwing prima donna.  The strait-laced movie rewards its characters of all ages for behaving like nice little boys and girls who care more about the team than about themselves. The goody-goodies will feel that special little glow of getting A-pluses, being teacher's pets and, in the case of Roy, receiving an approving kiss from a curvaceous surrogate mommy.  "Rebound" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

Yet another feel-good sports comedy about a childish grownup who gets a shot at redemption while coaching kids, "Rebound" scores a few chuckles while following a familiar game plan. Pic has been drafted as family-friendly counterprogramming against opening weekend of Steven Spielberg's dark and stormy "War of the Worlds." Despite marquee allure of franchise player Martin Lawrence, however, lightweight Fox release isn't likely to break any B.O. records during theatrical preliminaries. But it's reasonably safe to expect a solid performance in homevid playoffs.
Lawrence is funniest when most ferocious in early scenes as Roy McCormick, a fiery-tempered college basketball coach -- think Bobby Knight, with a better fashion sense -- who devotes entirely too much time to commercial endorsements. When he does focus on hardwood action instead of TV huckstering, he's a hotheaded screamer who never met a ref he didn't loathe.
But when he accidentally kills a rival team's feathered mascot during a courtside altercation, McCormick finds that even a celebrity coach isn't immune from being suspended by the National College Basketball Assn. (Evidently, no real-life college sports authority deigned to lend its name to filmmakers.)
Advised by his semi-sleazy agent (Breckin Meyer) to attempt a radical image makeover, Lawrence agrees to accept a short-term coaching job at any school where he can "give something back to the community" -- and, not incidentally, generate good publicity while redeeming himself in eyes of NCBA officials.
But the only school willing to risk his presence on campus is Lawrence's childhood alma mater, Mount Vernon Junior High, where the hapless hoopsters haven't won a game since the Reagan administration.
Among the underachieving 13-year-olds playing for the sparkless Mount Vernon Smelters: Keith (Oren Williams), a talented but untrained ball hog; One Love (Eddy Martin), a dandy who dreams of shoe-endorsement contracts; Goggles (Gus Hoffman), who sports really, really big glasses; Fuzzy (Logan McElroy), a poster boy for Overeaters Anonymous; and Ralph (Steven Anthony Lawrence), a nervous type who tends to upchuck before, during and after every game.
It took no fewer than five credited writers to cobble together a scenario composed entirely of secondhand parts. Some may suspect helmer Steve Carr didn't work from a script at all but instead merely ticked items off a list of sports-movie cliches: Players are demoralized losers easily transformed into unlikely winners? Check. Blustering coach gradually reveals a heart of pure mush? Ditto. Attractive single mom (Wendy Raquel Robinson) overcomes initial dislike of son's new coach to strike romantic sparks? Got it. Climatic junior high championship game just happens to coincide with coach's must-attend meeting with college officials? Done.
The ultimate outcome of McCormick's third-act choice between a return to college coaching and a permanent job at Mount Vernon will surprise ... well, actually, no reasonably sentient human being. Indeed, coach's change-of-heart value shift is so thoroughly predictable, filmmakers obviously felt they didn't need to dramatize it. So they merely announce it.
Modest pleasures of "Rebound" have almost nothing to do with by-the-numbers plot. Lawrence wisely refrains from pushing too hard in easy-to-overplay role, and he's all the more effective for his relative restraint. (Unfortunately, his jokey cameo bit as an inspirational preacher adds nothing to pic.)
Two new team players -- fearsomely tomboyish Big Mac (Tara Correa) and awkward six-footer Wes (Steven Christopher Parker) -- are cleverly conceived characters played by promising newcomers. (That these opposites attract is a sweet touch.)
Other standout supporting players include Megan Mullally (of TV's "Will & Grace") as the sharp-tongued principal and Amy Bruckner and Alia Shawkat as Mount Vernon students whose enthusiastic play-by-play commentary is pic's best running gag. Horatio Sanz (as McCormick's assistant coach) and Patrick Warburton (as a rival school's rabid coach) appear sporadically in roles evidently diminished in the editing room.
Tech values are generally unremarkable, but Carr makes creative use of neo-retro screen wipes to signal scene changes. Pic includes several plugs for "The Best Damn Sports Show Period," Fox Sports Net series whose star commentators -- Tom Arnold, Bryan Cox, Chris Rose and John Salley -- are credibly cast as themselves.

Nobody, it can be said, has had as great an impact and influence on cinema history with as little filmless than three hours, all toldthan Jean Vigo, demi-surréaliste , anarchist's son, and Keats-like consumptive martyr. At BAM, the movies bearing Vigo 's footprint mostly reflect Zero for Conduct  (1933), an impetuous schoolyard revolution that was virtually remade, albeit with tommy guns, as Lindsay Anderson 's If . . . (1968), the still-underrated capstone to the British New Wave. But the imprint is also detected on Elia Kazan 's Splendor in the Grass  (1961)shot by Vigo DP Boris Kaufman, brother of Dziga Vertov and Bernardo Bertolucci 's Godardian-Marxist ode Before the Revolution  (1964). Individualizing Vigo's more generalized juvenile insurrection, Fran Truffaut 's The 400 Blows  (1959) seems a natural choice, but Ken Loach 's Truffaut-esque Kes  (1969) is, relatively speaking, out of left field. (Where's Heathers ?) But that's fine: Being a Vigoienne, I'd give Zero 's precious 41-minute rebel yell credit for molding most of 20th-century culture's genuine triumphs.
Frederick Wiseman 's High School  (1968) is a chilling answer to Vigo's utopian fantasia, but then, Columbia Revolt  (1968), a collectively made, hour-long document of the 1968 student uprising, could be said to answer Wiseman, with appropriate élan and fury. L'Atalante  (1934) may be Vigo's greatest work, but its dreamy ambivalence has been less iconic; here, Leos Carax 's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf  (1991) thieves from Vigo's riverboat odyssey, and Another Girl, Another Planet  (1992), by indie idiosyncrat Michael Almereyda  (who shares Vigo's real surname), transposes Vigo's romantic anti-romanticism to the East Village  by way of a Fisher-Price  Pixelvision camera.
