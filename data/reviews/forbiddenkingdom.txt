If you've shelled out dough for the last half-dozen films by the grinny, battered Chan � Hong Kong's kung-fu ambassador-in-perpetuity � then you can be forgiven for thinking that this, too, is yet another silly, flailing mishmash of comic battery. It's more than that, thankfully, and with a sure, swift kick to the mental palate, it dislodges not only the vile taste of Brett Ratner's crappily Americanized Rush Hour
 trilogy but also Chan's own lackluster outings of late (The Medallion
, The Tuxedo
, The Myth
). Pairing Chan with Li, the actor who once looked to be his heir apparent, is an undeniably smart casting move. Although nine years Chan's junior, Li's own output of late has been daringly rote (except for Hero
 and the UK version of Danny the Dog
, which was released stateside as Unleashed
). Pairing these two martial-arts legends in a story that is essentially one long homage to the great Shaw Brothers films of yore allows The Forbidden Kingdom
 plenty of leeway for comic moments (courtesy, as always, of Chan) and some seriously kickass fight scenes (choreographed by Kill Bill
's Yuen Woo-ping). There's also plenty of the traditional wirework and not nearly as much CGI (which almost always feels like a cheat in the fantastical world of traditional Hong Kong knockabouts) as you'd expect. The plot is negligible, but that's fine since it's really only a way to get from one set-piece to another. Angarano plays Jason, a bullied teen who miraculously finds himself back in ancient China via a magic staff, which he must restore to its rightful owner before he can return to his own time and wipe the floor with his 20th century tormentors. Yawn. Li, playing both a grave monk and the outlandishly entertaining Monkey King, and Chan, riffing on his own character of the Drunken Master
 of blotto-fu, play dueling Mr. Miyagis to Angarano's Kung-fu Kid (with a nod to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
 in the willowy form of Liu), and the results are respectable, if not classic. With its many, many references to Hong Kong's cinematic past (Zu: Warrior of the Magic Mountain
, the Drunken Master
 films, Li's Swordsman II
, The Bride With White Hair
), The Forbidden Kingdom
 comes off as an introductory course in genre ground rules for younger audiences whose only contact with Hong Kong bruisery comes from video games or, worse, Brett Ratner. And for longtime fans, it's no Police Story II
, but then neither was the straight-to-DVD effort New Police Story
.


With a combined 133 movies and 72 years in the business between them, Hong Kong action superstars Jackie Chan and Jet Li have put off appearing in a film together for far too long. Even the idea of them sharing the screen gets your neck hairs pricking. Li's mercurial grace and Chan's comic daredevilry, the ways in which each man defies gravity in his own carefree fashion - it's like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly having a smackdown.
What could be a breakthrough collaboration, though, ends up tasting like warmed-over fusion cuisine. "The Forbidden Kingdom" is a mild disappointment even as it clears a space for Chan and Li to bounce merrily off the edges of the screen. A US-Chinese co-production, the movie tries to retrofit the gaga airborne action of Asia's wuxia genre into a standard Hollywood "Karate Kid" storyline, adding a genetic graft of - get this - "The Wizard of Oz." Clearly, we're not in Hong Kong anymore.
The framing story casts Michael Angarano ("24") as Jason, a bullied kid in a South Boston that I can pretty much guarantee the Massachusetts Film Bureau had no part of. (It looks like, and is, a back lot at China's Hengdian Studios.) A devotee of classic martial arts flicks, Jason comes by a fighting staff that magically transports him to the ancient Middle Kingdom, where he's charged with returning it to the mischievous, hard-fighting Monkey King (Li).
Said king having been imprisoned in a statue by the evil Jade Warlord (Collin Chou), Jason joins up with a drunken fighting master, Lu Yan (Chan), and a traveling monk (Li again), both of whom teach him enough fighting skills to get through the movie alive. Along for the ride is a dart-tossing teenage love interest, Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei).
She's pretty adorable, but the film's bad girl wipes her off the screen: Li Bingbing as a sexy, trash-talking, white-haired witch hired by the Jade Warlord to stop the good guys. With her tresses whipping out like surly tentacles, she's Asia's Next Top Medusa.
The direction is credited to Rob Minkoff ("Stuart Little"), and in the pokier, more obvious parts of "The Forbidden Kingdom," that's easy to believe. The movie's action director, though, is the redoubtable Yuen Wo Ping, of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and dozens of HK classics. It's his work that stops your breath: an elegant, concussive choreography that goes past common sense into pure rhythm and movement.
So the movie's not the classic it coulda-shoulda-woulda been - a friend's 12-year-old son came out of the screening drily remarking that "it wasn't as good as 'Hero,' " and he speaks the truth. Yet "Forbidden Kingdom" is unashamed about giving its audience a good time, and the high spirits go a long way toward counterbalancing the cliches.
And there's Chan and Li - the comedian who makes the real look impossible and the dancer who makes the impossible look real. Their opposing fighting styles mesh and separate here, cruising side by side in syncopation then diverging for frenzied, beautifully confident action solos. Who cares if the rest of "Kingdom" is a Top 40 retread? What these two do is the stuff of jazz.


The worst part of martial-arts epic The Forbidden Kingdom   in which a kung fu master (Jackie Chan) and a monk (Jet Li) help a time-traveling teen (Michael Angarano) return a magical staff to its owner  isn't the stale story, the fortune-cookie dialogue, or the fizzled pairing of action legends Chan and Li, whose fisticuffs here have all the oomph of a high-speed game of pattycake. No, it's a moment near the halfway mark when there arrives a gag that involves Chan getting a face full of urine. This kingdom really should be forbidden.

 At first glance “Forbidden Kingdom,” the first movie to unite the martial arts action stars Jackie Chan and Jet Li, might be mistaken for a pastiche of its genre. Its main character, a Boston teenager named Jason (Michael Angarano), is obsessed with kung fu cinema, and the ways of modern Hollywood might lead you to expect the filmmakers to mock, travesty or wink at this obsession.  Instead they — the screenwriter John Fusco and the director Rob Minkoff — clearly share it. And though it is an English-language film (albeit a heavily accented one), “Forbidden Kingdom” is a faithful and disarmingly earnest attempt to honor some venerable and popular Chinese cinematic traditions.  These include a plot that is at times so convoluted as to teeter on the brink of incomprehensibility, a heavy brocade of martial honor and blurry mysticism, and above all a lot of wildly inventive fighting. The battles were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, one of the supreme masters of the art, and shot by Peter Pau, whose credits as a cinematographer include “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”  Filmed on Chinese locations and studio sets, the movie shows the lavish artificiality that is, in the currently booming Chinese film industry, a sign of authenticity. Mr. Chan made his name in scruffier, scrappier Hong Kong entertainments, but as he has aged into an international superstar, he has come to seem at home just about everywhere. Here he plays two roles: an elderly junk dealer in 21st-century Boston and an itinerant fighter, specializing in the “drunken fist” style of combat, in a mythic ancient China.  Mr. Li also plays two parts, both in the mythic past: the mischievous Monkey King (who uses  — what else? —  monkey kung fu fighting techniques) and a monk. After an inconclusive and thrilling battle — surely the high point of the movie — the monk and Mr. Chan’s character join forces to help Jason, who has been transported to their world by a magic staff that once belonged to the Monkey King.  An evil warlord (Collin Chou) stands in their way, as does a white-haired witch (Li Bing Bing). Accompanying the monk, the drunk and the kid from Boston is a young woman named Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei), a fearsome warrior in her own right, who seeks to avenge the death of her parents.  There is both a surfeit of motives and a dearth of momentum driving the narrative of “The Forbidden Kingdom,” which often drags in the expository sections between set pieces. But many of the set pieces are dazzling, even if, by now, audiences may be a bit jaded by high-flying wire work and artful blends of computer-generated imagery and traditional production design.  Still, the film works well enough as a primer for latecomers and a fix for insatiable martial arts lovers. If you’ve never seen a movie like this, it might satisfy your curiosity; if you can’t get enough of this kind of movie, nothing I say about it would keep you away.  “The Forbidden Kingdom” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many action scenes, some of them fairly brutal.

Those salivating at the thought of Jet Li and Jackie Chan going mano-a-mano are likely to be among the more disappointed customers for "The Forbidden Kingdom." While top-billed duo do indeed occupy plenty of screen time, this is basically the latest version of that post-"Star Wars" fantasy concept in which only a middle-class white teenage boy can save the universe from, y'know, Evil. On its own terms, it's a handsome albeit unexceptional juvenile adventure shot on some magnificent Chinese locations by d.p. Peter Pau. Biz should be healthy if unspectacular, with stars boosting Asian markets, and strong ancillary sales.
Script by John Fusco ("Young Guns," "Hidalgo") is loosely based on the classic Chinese epic "Journey to the West," incorporating nods to various other mythological and kung-fu movie conventions.
Apart from framing segs, animator-turned-live-action helmer Rob Minkoff ("The Lion King," "Stuart Little," "The Haunted Mansion") shot exterior and studio sequences entirely in China. Yet the cliche-ridden opening heralds this as a formulaic view of the exotic East through Western pop-culture-trained eyes -- specifically those of Jason (Michael Angarano), a Boston teen enamored with kung-fu movies.
He buys bootleg DVDs at the Chinatown pawnshop of Old Hop (a prosthetically aged Chan), and happens to spy an ornate golden staff in a back room. Later, school bullies led by Lupo (Morgan Benoit) force Jason back to the pawnshop for a robbery attempt that leaves Old Hop shot. While grasping the staff, Jason is magically whisked away, waking up inexplicably in what appears to be an ancient Chinese farming village that's promptly ransacked by soldiers of the tyrannical Jade Warlord (Collin Chou).
Jason is captured, then rescued by Lu Yan (Chan), an inebriated passerby whose drunk-fu nonetheless foils a passel of armed men. The two repair to a teahouse, where Lu Yan explains the Yank lad must be "the seeker" destined to fulfill a prophecy by returning the golden staff to its owner, the Monkey King (Li), trapped in stone centuries ago by his likewise immortal foe, the Jade Warlord.
Attacked again, the duo escape and are joined by Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei), an orphan determined to avenge her parents' murder by the Jade Army. Then white-clad Silent Monk (Li) turns up and endures a lengthy temple fight with Lu Yan before it's discovered he's on their side.
Now Jason has two masters -- poker-faced monk and wine-scarfing poet -- to pummel his hitherto nonexistent fighting skills into shape.
Among the perils the quartet face are crossing a desert and combating the Warlord's white-haired witch ally Ni Chang (Li Bing Bing). Climax takes place at the Jade Palace, amid a riot of CGI effects and Woo-Ping Yuen's fight choreography. Still, there's that Boston bully to be dealt with, in a groan-inducing epilogue.
While a professed Chinese cultural enthusiast and advanced martial-arts student himself, scenarist Fusco plays safe in multiplex terms, not reinventing or paying witty homage (a la "Kill Bill") to Hong Kong action conventions so much as bending them to fit routine Hollywood blueprints.
This material -- particularly its generic dialogue -- doesn't give the thesps much chance to shine past sheer physical exertion and iconic presences. While Chan and Li bring their accumulated charisma to the table, pic won't be remembered as more than a paycheck highlight for either of them. If the goal was to cast an all-American lead as ordinary as possible, Angarano (seen to much better advantage in indie drama "Snow Angels") fits the bill to a fault, despite his eventual athletic prowess.
On the upside, "The Forbidden Kingdom" is brisk and colorfully realized, with excellent contribs not only from Pau's handsome widescreen lensing and the impressive Mainland sites deployed but also from Bill Brzeski's splendid production design and Shirley Chan's costumes.


The plot is pure choose-your-own-adventure: A bullied wuxia  fanboy from South Boston  (Michael Angarano ) is teleported back into a LARP fantasia of feudal China, where he's singled out as the long-anticipated "Chosen One" prophesied to topple the despotic warlord. Our nominal hero then recedes behind the two Mr. Miyagis who adopt him: a Lisa Bonet –bewigged Jackie Chan  and warrior-monk Jet Li  (English line readings: 75 percent intelligible). This is the first collaboration between kung fu's Astaire and Kelly, and, as that, it disappoints. Like so much here, the fight arrangements by choreographer Yuen Woo-ping aren't so much bad as undistinguished: The camera placement is off, the tempo unvaried, and Chan's movements are obscured by his piled-on robes. The cinematography lacks storybook indelibility; Collin Chou 's Jade Emperor is a stock archvillain (though Li Bingbing 's bullwhip-toting "White Haired Demoness," announced with apocalyptic reverb, is lovely) . . . and then there's the scene where Li actually pisses in Chan's face—a degradation familiar to viewers incensed by the demographic-outreach casting of white-dude Angarano. Taken as a whole, though, it's an amiable lost-and-found of epic-adventure tropes. As I still illogically treasure Willow , many a 10-year-old who sees Forbidden Kingdom  will remember it fondly in spite of its flaws.
