In "Eastern Promises," David Cronenberg's hellacious new Russian mob movie, Viggo Mortensen finally comes of age as an actor and a movie star.
He plays Nikolai Luzhin, an underling in London's Vory V Zakone criminal organization and a man whose only asset would seem to be that he's best friends with the boss's son. That's only on paper, though. Although he has impressive skills in corpse disposal, Nikolai works as a driver, and when pressed he'll say that's all he is. In a sense he's right: Calm, alert, and frighteningly efficient, he's the figure who drives the plot and the fates of the film's other characters. He's the sudden death you don't see coming until it's too late.
Mortensen plays this role as if he had different blood chemistry than the rest of us. Nikolai remains eerily still until he's moved to act; then he glides forth with reptilian grace. Yet something still glows at the bottom of those half-lidded eyes - enough to suggest the cobra has a soul.
Enough, too, to attract Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), even when her instincts tell her to run the other way. British-born but of Russian descent, Anna is a midwife working at a North London hospital one night when a 14-year-old girl in heavy labor (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse) is admitted. The girl dies, leaving behind an infant daughter and a diary written in Cyrillic, which Anna can't read.
A postcard in the diary will lead her to Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl, the father in "Shine"), an aging and elegant restaurateur who doubles as the ruthless head of the Vory mob. This is also where Anna meets Semyon's excitable son and heir to the empire, Kirill (the French actor Vincent Cassel), as well as Nikolai, initially a sinister figure on the sidelines.
At the mention of the girl's diary, the kingpin's ears prick up and Mueller-Stahl's calculated foxiness comes into play. Of course, he's willing to translate it for Anna, and wouldn't it help to know where she lives? No dummy, she soon senses she's standing at the threshold of a very dangerous universe.
"Eastern Promises" is a genre movie, then - a gangland drama - and it doesn't break free into a larger contemplation of morals and metaphysics the way Cronenberg's last film, "A History of Violence," did. Still, it shows the Canadian filmmaker working at a whole new level of confidence in what must be the fourth or fifth phase of a long career. Rather like Nikolai himself, "Promises" is alluring but heavy with imminent threat.
This being a Cronenberg film (with a sharp script by Steve Knight), there's a scene of appalling violence early on. It's a palate cleanser of sorts and a reminder that civilization is a thin skin over our animal nature. Indeed, animal nature is everywhere in "Eastern Promises," from the periodic eruptions of bloody mayhem to the revealed fate of the dead girl, a teenager from Ukraine lured to London by promises of a new life (thus the title) that ended in slavery.
Cronenberg has always been a director whose screen violence actually hurts, and in this film he extends the pain to include man's inhumanity to women. The world of the Vory V Zakone is macho and sealed off, a hidden order of prison tattoos and sexual bravado. Kirill is probably gay under endless layers of denial, and Cassel nicely shows the character whipsawing between a desperate crush on his friend and a rich boy's insolence. The actor knows he's playing the movie's Fredo Corleone, but he gives Kirill some of the sweaty, dangerous energy of an early Warner Bros. gangster, too.
Mortensen's Nikolai, by contrast, could come out of a Jean-Pierre Melville movie of the 1960s - one of those French Zen crime sagas like "Le Samourai," where silence is sexy and lethal. Unreadable behind his wraparound shades, Nikolai slicks his hair back in a devil-horned quiff and just waits. It's a performance of almost unbearable tension, erotically and otherwise. As Anna slowly realizes the full depravity of the situation and her own peril, Nikolai has the chance to become her knight. The attraction is there, but it wars with duty and self-preservation.
The storm finally breaks in a fight sequence, set in a Russian steam bath, that's an instant movie classic. It pits the naked Nikolai against two knife-wielding Chechens who aren't about to play fair, and, staged for maximum audience reaction, the scene's outrageous, punishing, gory, exploitative, absurdist, and thrilling beyond all measure. A woman I was sitting near - a die-hard Viggo fan - kept turning from the screen with shrieks of dismay then turning back for a peek at the star's kibbles and bits.
As the film's bruised innocent, Watts is very good, but "Eastern Promises" isn't about her so much as it's about the lengths men will go to plunder or protect. (That also covers Anna's Uncle Stepan
, a bitter Russian émigré played by the great Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski.) Cronenberg and screenwriter Knight see brutality as the normal state of affairs, and fighting brutality as a mission that often works best in secret. The battle never ends, which perhaps explains why the movie's final scenes feel oddly abrupt and unsatisfying.
It's hard to leave Nikolai, though, burning a hole in the screen. Mortensen has played a king of Middle-earth and, for Cronenberg, a man with two lives. This is the first time, though, his performance seemed so much bigger than the film surrounding it. That he manages the feat with so few wasted gestures puts him in line with the greats.

         David Cronenberg has always had something to say about the grotesque transformations that result when science and technology transgress the flesh, and the ensuing social breakdown. But there was a time when he spoke about it in the language of experiments, infections, mutations, identity-altering drugs, malignant broadcast signals, genetic accidents.
 
 Lately, he's moved away from the altered body to focus on larger organisms. Now, instead of frail and pliant human bodies, it's innocent small towns and Western cities populated by ordinary, orderly people that play host to virulent foreign parasites, and the failed experiments are social.
 


         






   The director's career has in some ways been a reprise of the greatest fears of the 1950s, so it makes sense that technophobia and fear of the unrecognizable self have given way to xenophobia and fear of the unrecognizable society. Look out. The Russians are coming.
 
 Expertly realized and gunmetal slick, "Eastern Promises" whirs along with perfect efficiency, but doesn't stir much in the way of visceral horror despite its penchant for treating the human body like a chicken carcass on a block. (Squeamishness, yes.) The movie is in many ways a B-movie companion piece to "A History of Violence." Here, again, the mutating virus walks, talks and waves a gun around, infecting the body politic. And, again, the good guy is the guy who can be very bad when he needs to be.
 
 Set in the shadowy underbelly of the new criminal London, "Eastern Promises" right away throws various lambs -- a newborn baby, various teenage sex slaves, a Western European liberal with pure intentions -- to the Russian wolves. The movie begins with two ritual bloodlettings. First thing, a Russian is killed at a barber shop, his throat sawed open by an idiot kid with a dull knife.  Then a young Russian girl hemorrhages to death on a pharmacy floor shortly before giving birth to a baby.
 
 The baby is delivered by a half-Russian, half-English midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), who becomes obsessed with locating the infant's family. The dead girl has left a diary, which leads Anna to the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which leads her to the ultraviolent underworld of the Vory V Zakone, or Russian mafia, traffickers in girls, drugs and (because every crime ring needs a good front) surprisingly delicious borscht.
 
 It's here that Anna meets Nikolai, played by Viggo Mortensen, an actor who requires no tele-transport pod to appear more engineered than born. Nikolai works as a chauffeur and "undertaker" for a ruthless Russian crime boss named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel), a sort of Sonny-slash-Fredo of the Urals.
 
 When Kirill gets into trouble with a rival gang, Nikolai offers his assistance and Semyon replies with an invitation to join the brotherhood. The deeper Nikolai sinks into the world of the Vory, the more Anna discovers about the baby's past, the more Nikolai helps her in his unique menacing way. Is Nikolai essentially good? Is he evil? Is a good man required to be evil if it will protect the innocent from yet more evil? Does the long-term exposure to evil that results in fighting evil with evil  result in some kind of moral mutation? Honestly, I couldn't say. Cronenberg floats the possibilities but he doesn't dig in with his old relish.
 
 The much-discussed Turkish bath death-match scene, in which Nikolai, wearing a washcloth, is brutally attacked by a pair of fully clothed Chechens, is quite revealing. But as for its conveying the realistic "body-ness" the director was after, well, it's no nude "Borat" wrestling scene. The terrifying vulnerability and malleability of the flesh doesn't pack the same punch when the body in question is firmer than a boutique hotel mattress.
 
 For all its naked fighting, as well as its finger-pruning, eye-impaling, throat-slitting and childbirth hemorrhaging, the movie is much less corporeal than the Cronenberg films of olden days and considerably more hidebound. Whereas his films once expressed a fierce protection of the self against external, anti-humanist forces, they now seem to insist, compulsively, on the need for order and everyone in his or her place. Even the brave Anna, after falling in love with her cruel-to-be-kind Russian, gives up her beloved dad's motorcycle and her jeans and leather jacket for a floral-print dress and the pleasures of a backyard clothes-line. Who, exactly, is afraid of what?
 

 
 "Eastern Promises." MPAA rating: R for strong, brutal and bloody violence, some graphic sexuality, language and nudity. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. In general release.   

It can be a film-buff parlor game to try to decipher David Cronenberg's ideas, but in movies as diverse as A History of Violence , Crash , Spider , Dead Ringers , and The Fly , it's aggressively apparent that they are  films of ideas. That's what makes his new one, Eastern Promises , so intriguing. It's an academic meditation in underworld-thriller drag  a movie that looks about as close to a straight-ahead, down-and-dirty genre entertainment as anything the director has made since his exploding-head horror days. Just give it a while, though. In London, a dazed 14-year-old, with purple track marks on her arm, collapses in a bloody heap. Anna (Naomi Watts), a hospital midwife  she's English, but of Russian descent  watches helplessly as the girl dies in childbirth, then attempts to locate the baby's relatives.
Her one clue is a diary, written in Russian. It leads her to an elegant restaurant, in the city's Russian demimonde, run by Semyon, a grandfatherly gent played by the great sly dog Armin Mueller-Stahl with such soft-spoken benevolence that from the moment he volunteers to translate the diary, you just know he's bad to the bone. A thriller can lead us into the fascinating intricacy of a criminal subculture, and Eastern Promises  does that with the globalized Russian Mob. The whackings have their own brazen operatic flavor, and so does the ritual of becoming a ''made'' man (it involves special tattoos). A prostitute den is stocked with morose Slavic Valkyries  a relevant setting, since the film explores sex trafficking.
Even more vivid, though, are Semyon's son, the sneery, hotheaded Kirill (Vincent Cassel), and his driver, poker-faced Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), who is angling to move up in the family business. (Semyon treats him like a second son.) Both carry a beyond-cool mystique of solemnly heartless old-world machismo. Nikolai, toughened by his time in Soviet prisons, is a particular enigma: a dashing statue of a man, at once calculating hard case and noble knight. He woos Anna, who has no idea that he's a gangster, and begins to win her over with his frosty-eyed reticence.
Eastern Promises  unpeels like an onion of corruption, with double crosses and deceptions, and ordinary do-gooders (like Anna's crusty old uncle) in way over their heads. Cronenberg's craftsmanship is seductive, yet anyone waiting for a conventional resolution, or even a coherent one, will be soundly disappointed. The film's key sequence is an amazingly vicious fight in which Nikolai, naked, fends off two dagger-wielding assassins in a steam bath, grabbing their weapons and plunging them again and again. And again. Cronenberg, riffing on the strategy of A History of Violence , wants us to gaze at Viggo Mortensen and see not just a man but a paradox, a walking deconstruction of humanity's dual nature: good and  bad, immersed in a violence so brutal it can only have come from evil, even if it's being used for justice. But this is all a bit much to pile onto a conventional heart-of-darkness thriller. Eastern Promises  is a decent night out, but in delivering ''more'' than it promises, it also delivers less.

 The story told in “Eastern Promises” is a grim and violent one, set in London’s expatriate Russian underworld. The film, directed by David Cronenberg from a script by Steve Knight, revisits a number of themes and motifs that are staples of the genre: the ties of family and culture that bind criminal organizations; Oedipal drama; honor among thieves. The audience stumbles into this realm in the company of an innocent outsider (Naomi Watts) who finds herself at once fascinated and repelled by it, as well as in considerable danger.  But even as the turns of its narrative and the contours of its characters are recognizable, very little about “Eastern Promises” feels predictable or secondhand. From his early days making low-budget horror movies in Canada to his current ascendancy as a favorite of the international critical cognoscenti, Mr. Cronenberg has always been a master of estrangement. He and his cinematographer, Peter Suschitzky, shoot the dark, rain-slicked London streets in tones that turn the city into a sinister, palpitating presence. Mr. Cronenberg’s deliberate, almost stately pacing — the way he lingers in scenes for an extra beat or two, as if studying the faces of his actors for clues — transforms what might have been a routine thriller into something genuinely troubling.  Mr. Knight deserves a lot of credit as well, since he is clearly as interested in the social and ethical implications of the story as he is in its twists and reversals. Among the other screenplays he has written are those for “Dirty Pretty Things,” another peek into the murky byways of multicultural London, and “Amazing Grace,” a stirring biography of the 18th-century  British abolitionist William Wilberforce.  “Eastern Promises,” like those earlier movies, is fundamentally about the moral scandal of slavery, the traffic in human bodies and human misery that persists, in secret and in the shadows, even in the modern, cosmopolitan West.  The plot of “Dirty Pretty Things” turned on the sale of organs for transplant. “Eastern Promises” glances at the consequences of the global sex trade, particularly as it involves women and girls from the former Soviet Union. Ms. Watts’s character, Anna, is a midwife at a London hospital — the daughter of a Russian father and a British mother (Sinead Cusack) — obsessed with the background of a baby she has delivered. The infant’s mother was a teenage girl who died in childbirth, leaving behind a diary that chronicled her horrific exploitation and that may contain information about the identities of her tormentors.  Rather guilelessly, Anna follows a trail that leads her to an elegant Russian restaurant, whose proprietor, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), is a soft-spoken monster with twinkly blue eyes. When he is not decorating birthday cakes for exiled dowagers, Semyon leads a local chapter of the Vory v Zakone, the Russian Cosa Nostra, born in Stalin’s prison camps, whose members are known, like Japanese yakuza, by the tattoos that cover their skin.  Anna, who speaks no Russian, is innocent of the ways of the Vory, but her irascible uncle Stepan (played by the veteran Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski), warns her to steer clear of them.  Several forces combine to pull her into their orbit, though. In addition to her desire to honor the dead girl and protect the baby, there seems to be a trace of the sentimental curiosity that an assimilated, second-generation immigrant might feel about the old country. And then there is Nikolai, the well-mannered, ambitious ex-convict with slicked-back silver hair who serves as driver and wingman for Semyon’s impulsive, unhappy son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel).  Nikolai, who presents himself to Semyon as both loyal and ambitious, is played, with flawless control, by Viggo Mortensen. The immovable hair and the deep dimple in his slightly crooked chin suggest a young Kirk Douglas, but Mr. Douglas was never this quiet. In “A History of Violence,” Mr. Mortensen seamlessly impersonated an ordinary, decent small-town guy who was also a cold, professional killer. Nikolai is a similarly ambiguous — or perhaps divided — character. He is all hard, tense muscle, and yet an almost subliminal hint of compassion occasionally shines through his icy, impassive face.  “Eastern Promises” is itself an intriguing, not always stable mixture of moods and attitudes. There are, as usual in Mr. Cronenberg’s films, scenes of intimate brutality that you almost absorb physically, rather than with your eyes. (One, a grisly knife fight in a steam room, with Mr. Mortensen wearing only his tattoos, is likely to become a touchstone for cinema fetishists of various kinds.)  The rigor of Mr. Cronenberg’s direction sometimes seems at odds with the humanism of Mr. Knight’s script, but more often the director’s ruthless formal command rescues the story from its maudlin impulses. Mr. Knight aims earnestly for your heartstrings, but Mr. Cronenberg insists on getting under your skin. The result is a movie whose images and implications are likely to stay in your head for a long time.  “Eastern Promises” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, sex and extreme violence.

A superbly wrought yarn set in the milieu of first-generation Russian mobsters in London that is simultaneously tough-minded and compassionate about the human condition, "Eastern Promises" instantly takes its place among David Cronenberg's very best films. Same could be said for Viggo Mortensen, whose tightly coiled star turn recalls the magnetic work of Hollywood's greats of yore. Appreciation by the director's fans and a wide specialized viewership is assured, but there's enough intrigue and blood and guts here for Focus to have a shot at an ever bigger audience.
The tale, which takes place almost entirely between Christmas and New Year's Day, starts with two deaths and a birth. The first victim gets his throat gruesomely cut in a Russian gangland job, while the second is a Russian girl who expires in childbirth. Helping oversee the latter is hospital midwife Anna (Naomi Watts), who quietly takes home the unfortunate teenager's diary.
The way screenwriter Steve Knight ("Dirty Pretty Things") spirals and layers his story out from this simple beginning is thrilling to behold. Having just split with a boyfriend, Anna is living with her mother (Sinead Cusack) and her late Russian father's brother, the cranky Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski). Anna finds a business card in the dead girl's diary for a local Russian restaurant, which she visits in the hopes of having the Russian-language diary translated and learning something about the girl.
The warm, old-fashion eatery is presided over by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a soft-voiced, twinkly-blue-eyed gent with courtly manners but just a tad pushy when it comes to the diary. It doesn't take long to glean that old Semyon is the boss of the vory v zakone
, the Russian mafia, which operates from the restaurant. The gang was behind the opening murder, and working directly for the boss are his volatile son Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who drinks far too much, and Nikolai (Mortensen), a trim, sleekly dressed, self-contained man who's mostly a chauffeur but can do dirty work when needed.
The dead girl's diary turns out to reveal far too much about Semyon's criminal activities, about how he procures susceptible teens from the old country with promises of work, only to turn them into prosties and junkies, and about Kirill's misdeeds. It's all nasty stuff, and Nikolai, who has very gently expressed a certain interest in Anna, is eventually asked by Semyon to "deal" with her uncle Stepan, who has read the diary and doesn't hesitate to boast that he used to be affiliated with the KGB.
With Cronenberg spinning Knight's web at a cunningly measured pace, the insinuations, suspicions and threats grow knottier by the minute. The more Semyon becomes impressed with Nikolai's proficiency, the less confident he becomes in his wildman son. Russian-Chechen enmity, the breeding ground for criminals provided by old Soviet prisons, the degree to which Scotland Yard can deal with these immigrant gangs -- all are touched on while keeping the human drama to the fore.
Latter stretch features some great twists and turns-of-events, all the better for their subtlety, as well as an amazing set piece, a fight-to-the-death between two knife-wielding assassins and a nude Nikolai in an old London bathhouse. It's the one time Nikolai isn't prepared for what's happening, and the struggle seems so fierce, and the violence of it is so astounding in its realism, that it's breathtaking.
Another less showy but fascinating sequence has Nikolai being interviewed by mob hierarchy to determine his worthiness for promotion in the org, an event formalized by the application of star tattoos; one reason passed on for Russian mobsters' liking of bathhouses is that you can tell any man's status by his tattoos.
The surprises and revelations continue right up to the eminently satisfying ending; it's possible that Cronenberg has never made a film of such consistent tone and control. Helping enormously in this regard are the internationally diverse actors, who have been cast with brilliant imagination. Watts doesn't have any particularly showy scenes but again displays an emotional fluency and openness that invites instantaneous empathy.
Cassel is at the top of his game, unsurprisingly good at appearing out of control but very effective at conveying Kirill's insecurity and charged feelings for Nikolai. Mueller-Stahl might have been considered an unlikely candidate to play a Russian mob boss, but he's mesmerizing in his quiet authority, while Polish helmer Skolimowski was an inspired choice as the disagreeable but pivotal old uncle.
Still, it's Mortensen's picture, progressing from his work in Cronenberg's last film, "A History of Violence," to this riveting portrait of an observant man of few words who always bides his time, never shows his hand and at one point enigmatically says, "I live in the zone all the time"; in context, it makes sense.
Entirely shot in Britain, pic is beautifully crafted by mostly familiar Cronenberg hands, including longtime lenser Peter Suschitzky, production designer Carol Spier, costume designer Denise Cronenberg and editor Ronald Sanders. Howard Shore's score contributes mightily to the sense of intrigue and mystery.

I've said it before and hope to again: David Cronenberg  is the most provocative, original, and consistently excellent North American director of his generation. From Videodrome  (1983) through A History of Violence  (2005), neither Scorsese nor Spielberg, and not even David Lynch , has enjoyed a comparable run.
A rhapsodic movie directed with considerable formal intelligence and brooding power from an original screenplay by Steve Knight , Eastern Promises  is very much a companion to A History of Violence . Both are crime thrillers that allow Viggo Mortensen  to play a morally ambiguous and severely divided, if not schizoid, action-hero savior; both are commissioned works that permit hired-gun Cronenberg to make a genre film that is actually something else. As slick as it is, Eastern Promises  could, like A History of Violence , almost pass for an exceptionally well-made B-movie.
Graphic but never gratuitous in its violence, Eastern Promises  opens on a rainy December eve with a brutal gangland murder in a London barbershop and unfolds mainly in a demimonde of Russian émigré thugs and whore- masters. Anna (Naomi Watts ), a midwife in a central London hospital, delivers a baby as the mother, a 14-year-old prostitute named Tatiana, dies in childbirth. Half-Russian herself, Anna filches the girl's diary, hoping to discover who she is, and asks her irascibly inebriated uncle (Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski ) to translate. "Do you always rob the bodies of the dead?" he asks in a question that will hang over the rest of the movie.
A business card found in the diary brings Anna to the Trans-Siberian restaurant, administered by the grandfatherly Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl ). That this red and gold Nutcracker  wonderland turns out to be the headquarters for the London branch of the Gulag-spawned criminal fraternity vory v zakone  (thieves in law) is the least of the movie's surprises. In her attempt to fathom the origins of the orphan to whom she's given the seasonal name Christina, Anna is continually bamboozled by the Trans-Siberians, a tribe whose every pleasantry carries a threat. "This isn't our worldwe are ordinary  people," her anxious mother (Sinead Cusack ) warns her.
As usual in Cronenberg, the ordinary is severely contested terrain. (In a new scholarly treatment of the director, Mark Browning  notes that nearly all of Cronenberg's post-1982 movies are designed to "problematize exactly what constitutes 'normality.' ") However naïve and depressed Anna appears, she is on a seriousand seriously derangedquest. She's lost a baby through miscarriage and wants another one: Tatiana's. The means by which this might be achieved are at the heart of the movie, and also its strangeness.
Cronenberg's two previous works, Spider  and A History of Violence , have been murderous family dramas; Eastern Promises  continues this trend. Mueller-Stahl may be perfunctory in the role of the Russian paterfamilias, but Vincent Cassel  literally flings himself into the role of his wastrel son Kirill, particularly in the company of the movie's most compelling presence, the crime family's chauffeur, Nikolai (Mortensen). Here is the movie's love story; in fact, the coupling of Kirill and Nikolai has the potential to fulfill Anna's dream. Hair slicked back, eyes hidden behind wraparound shades, Mortensen is even more electrifying as Nikolai than in his History of Violence  roles; the actor speaks Russian as if he knows what he's saying, and his world-weary strut is at least as eloquent. Nikolai is a superbly complicated characterdark, diffident, cynical, hyper-alert, and tough enough to humorously stub out a cigarette on his tongue.
Garish yet restrained, Eastern Promises  has scarcely a wasted set-up. In a close middle shot that is pure Cronenberg, Nikolai's car eases in behind Anna's parked motorcycle, a vintage Ural that belonged to her father; it's a menacing gesture that stops just short of a flirtatious caress. ("Sentimental value," Nikolai repeats when she tells him why she treasures the bike. "I've heard of that.") Nikolai is not only the family driver but their mortician: He and Kirill retrieve a dead body from the killer's freezer. Nikolai softens the corpse with an electric hair dryer. "OK, now I'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers," he informs his comrades. "You might want to leave room." They do, and you might wish to as well, although Cronenberg insures that we stayat least for a few beats.
Eastern Promises  is a masterful mood piece with a surplus of atmosphere. Intermittently excerpted in voice-over, Tatiana's diary is the most awkward element in Knight's otherwise impeccable screenplayalthough it does introduce a current of unambiguous, otherworldly innocence in this misty, indeterminate world. Everything else is fluid. Blood flows; rain is near-constant. Corpses are tossed into the Thames, but secrets keep bobbing to the surface. Late in the movie, Eastern Promises ' homoerotic subtext bursts its banks and all but floods the screen in a steamy public bathhouse with an extraordinary action sequence that must have taken a week to film.
According to the movie's characters, the world is populated by angels, devils, and human wolves. (Indeed, Eastern Promises  is a Christmas story, complete with miracle.) Whenever possible, Cronenberg designs a wound that might have been inflicted by a fastidious insect from outer space, but mainly he uses a slightly wide-angle lens to keep the phantoms in sharp focus. Eastern Promises  suggests a naturalized version of the recent Russian horror flick Night Watch . The vory v zakone  are like a plague of vampiresgoverned by arcane laws and fearful superstitions. "You pronounced the name of my father," Kirill shrieks when confronted by an angry Anna. Liturgical music is heard as Nikolai kneels in his underwear, displaying his prison tattoos, for induction into the crime family. "I am already dead. I died when I was 15. Now I live in the Zone all the time," he assures his examiners.
