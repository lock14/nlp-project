Bertram Pincus (Gervais) is a misanthrope. His chosen profession is dentistry � ideal for cramming gauze or soft molds into the mouths of humans who would otherwise irritate him with attempts at the pleasantries, the chit-chats, even heartfelt stabs at connection so common to humans and their mouths. Pincus is a shit for a reason � there�s always a reason � and he�s the first one to admit that it�s a boring, ordinary story. But then something extraordinary happens to him: While under general anesthesia for a colonoscopy, he dies on the surgical table for seven minutes (in fact, just under
 seven minutes, a litigation-wary paper-pusher at the hospital enthuses). Upon resuscitation, Pincus discovers he can see dead people. But shaking hands with the reaper doesn�t make him any nicer; he gets even worse, actually, and is cruelly contemptuous of all the stuck-in-limbo souls who beg him to tidy up for them their loose ends. (I won�t spoil it, but the film has a neat twist on the plight of stymied ghosts.) Still, newly dead Frank Herlihy (Kinnear, perfectly cast as one part sunny, one part slime) is persistent, and he convinces Pincus to take up his cause, which is to steer Frank�s widow, Gwen (Leoni), away from a bad love match. It doesn�t take a rocket scientist, or a screenwriter certified in the School of Third-Act Redemption, to see where this is going: Pincus will fall for Gwen and in the process regain some kernel of humanity long buried under his sneer and silly DDS mock-turtleneck smock. Sounds a little bit cookie-cutter, but if you were going for cookie-cutter, you wouldn�t have hired pasty-faced Gervais, who�s best known for his brilliant bumbling idiocy in British TV�s The Office
 and Extras
. At first he seems an ill fit for leading man in a romantic comedy. Drawing from those previous roles, Gervais still plays a jerk, and he still lets loose with his astonishingly daft/deft monologues that stop and start in the most awkward, side-splitting of ways. But he�s also found a way to magnify the just-teased vulnerabilities of those earlier parts to craft a character that is both loathsome and endearing � a shit, sure, but with some reason and, yes, the faint hope of future redemption. Director and co-writer (with John Kamps) Koepp is also a surprise; he�s best known as the go-to screenwriter of movies of frenzy and bombast but very little quiet space, such as Panic Room
 and War of the Worlds
 and the most recent Indiana Jones
. But Ghost Town
 is perfectly content to burrow into those quiet spaces, where boring, ordinary adults live and fitfully try to love again. It�s a slow-burn kind of picture that doesn�t bend over backward to ingratiate itself and, in the process, quite surprisingly, does just that. It�s sweet and old-fashioned, a little bit hokey, its pacing a little bit pokey. But by the time this imperfect little film wends its way to one of the most winning exit lines I�ve heard in a long time, it�s turned into something, well, perfectly lovely.


Someone once said about W.C. Fields that he had the rare ability to despise amusingly. I can imagine no greater compliment than to say that Ricky Gervais seems, at his best, like a young Fields. They both have the same blocky bulldog head, for one thing, but where the older comic muttered, Gervais turns dithering into an art form. He expresses himself in stop-and-start arias of half-sentences, half phrases, half-words, half-phonemes, pirouetting here into rapier-edged insult and there into sublime high nonsense. Gervais's sensibility is that of a juggler, as Fields's was, and his malice toward all is just as graceful.
"Ghost Town" is an attempt to stuff this character into the box of a Hollywood leading man. Needless to say, that doesn't go very well. Yet the movie's a surprisingly pleasurable trifle, a formulaic but spry comedy-fantasy that runs into trouble only when it starts taking itself too seriously. The director and co-writer is David Koepp, who has written many blockbusters ("Spider-Man," "Jurassic Park," and so forth) and directed a few suspense stinkers ("Secret Window," "Stir of Echoes"); it's his breeziest work yet.
The setup is a rehash of "The Sixth Sense" by way of "Topper": Gervais sees dead people and he finds them tedious beyond measure. His character, Bertram Pincus, D.D.S., is a British-born Manhattan dentist and the kind of fellow who closes the elevator doors when he sees someone else rushing up. A nasty little man, and quite happily so.
After clinically dying for seven minutes during a routine colonoscopy (Kristen Wiig's his doctor, doing droll but thin "SNL" things with her part), Bertram develops the ability to see the thousands of undead who walk the streets of New York City. They look like you or me - or, to be precise, like familiar character actors such as Dana Ivey and Alan Ruck - and they're as shocked as he that he can see them.
The most persistent ghost is Frank (Greg Kinnear), a Master of the Universe type who was cheating on his wife before he died and who now wants Bertram to break up her pending remarriage. Tea Leoni plays the widow, an Egyptian mummy specialist named Gwen, and when the dentist gets a look at her, he's instantly smitten. Ricky Gervais in love? Say it ain't so.
It ain't and it is. Gwen's fiance is a fatally earnest human rights lawyer (Billy Campbell), and the minute Koepp gets these three at a dinner table (along with a Great Dane the size of a bison), we can see why Gwen might be attracted to this lumpy, middle-aged British misanthrope. Quite simply, Bertram gives her the giggles. The ever-underrated Leoni responds so delightfully to the star's acerbic flights of whimsy that the two carve out a subversive space within a conventional movie. They're a confederacy of goofballs.
As Frank and the other ghosts press Bertram to help them find closure, Kinnear and Gervais make an amusing if ultimately tiring comic team. Leoni and Gervais are far better company, but I regret to inform you that "Ghost Town" takes a turn for the somber in the final half-hour. The movie even suggests that a Ricky Gervais character might turn over a new leaf, discover he has a heart, and start dispensing the milk of human kindness.
To which I say: Heresy.
By the time Bertram's dental colleague (Aasif Mandvi) is pulling out his inspirational Albert Einstein posters and the dialogue has started ripping off "Tootsie" ("I was a better man with you as a woman" becomes "I was more alive with you after I was dead," etc.), you realize even Koepp has stopped believing in his movie. All that sustains "Ghost Town" by then is the afterglow of Gervais's marvelous, all-encompassing bile. Somewhere W.C. Fields must be applauding: Anyone who hates public-interest lawyers and dogs can't be all bad.


Ghost Town  is diverting enough, but it's also the kind of high-concept studio concoction Ricky Gervais might have ridiculed in his great backstage-showbiz sitcom Extras . The British comic plays Bertram Pincus, a misanthropic dentist in New York City who develops an ability to see dead people; to be specific, the dead are noodgy, solid-looking ghosts of the type that populated the Cary Grant movie Topper . Each has unfinished  business with the living for which they want Pincus to act as intermediary  and none  is noodgier than a slick businessman (Greg Kinnear) who was cheating on his wife (Téa Leoni) when he bit the dust. Now the remorseful dead cad wants the living dentist to stop the good widow's impending second marriage to an unsuitably dull fellow (Billy Campbell).
Gervais, who created (with Stephen Merchant) the inimitable original BBC version of The Office  and starred, unforgettably, as  incompetent boss David Brent, specializes in the hilarity of human discomfort; he's a performer who works best when supported by characters as sharp and fully drawn as  he is. Here, though, director David Koepp (the A-list screenwriter of Spider-Man , working from his own script) handles Gervais with nervous delicacy, as if the star is an odd import whose striking, foreign comedic  persona needs to be cushioned by squishier, more familiar American displays of mildness. (Kinnear and Leoni, too, are muted.)
Maybe now Gervais can do his own sitcom about a unique British comedian who comes to conquer Hollywood, only to find himself cast in a generic 1930s-type happy-ending romp about dentists and noodgy ghosts.

 A misanthropic dentist, a roguish ghost and a zany Egyptologist: as these unlikely companions  scamper around Manhattan in the buoyant comedy “Ghost Town,” they resurrect the spirits of classic movie curmudgeons like W. C. Fields and such romantic comedians as Cary Grant and Carole Lombard in Woody Allen territory.  It would be easy to make too much of this froth, directed by David Koepp (screenwriter of Spielberg blockbusters) from a script he wrote with John Kamps. A latter-day hybrid of “Topper” and “Blithe Spirit” and a visual ode to autumn in New York, “Ghost Town” is a screwball comedy with no big surprises or hidden metaphors. But if you comb through the ranks of recent Hollywood comedies that have tried to conjure the same mood of airy amusement, most of what you’ll find are strained, witless duds that get mired in sentimentality like flies in molasses.  As it draws to a close, “Ghost Town” tiptoes to the edge of that sticky mess, but it doesn’t get caught there. Its snappy dialogue and sharp comic timing, and the offbeat chemistry of Ricky Gervais (in his first feature-film starring role), Greg Kinnear and Téa Leoni, keep it afloat.  The dentist, Bertram Pincus (Mr. Gervais), is a grumpy transplanted Briton who declares that he doesn’t mind crowds, just the people in them, and shuts up his yammering patients by stuffing dental equipment in their mouths. Bertram is extremely annoyed when, after a seven-minute near-death experience during a routine colonoscopy, he suddenly finds himself a middleman  between the living and the dead.  On leaving the hospital he is besieged by anxious ghosts whom only he can see and hear. Trailing him around Manhattan, they pester him to take care of their unfinished business; only then can they happily disappear into the hereafter. As the living overhear him talking to the dead, the usual crossed signals and misunderstandings land him in trouble, but the movie doesn’t overdo it.  Mr. Gervais gives Bertram many of the same comic tics he brought to David Brent in “The Office” and Andy Millman in “Extras”: a stammering befuddlement that is simultaneously verbose and nonsensical; sickly smiles and joyless laughs in which his mirth curdles with self-doubt; a tongue-tied staccato; and his special mixture of clueless grandiosity, insensitivity and stifled humiliation.  Among the ghosts the most persistent noodge is Frank Herlihy (Mr. Kinnear), a slick yuppie go-getter with a cheating heart who in an early scene is struck by a bus while running away from a falling air-conditioner. Frank entreats Bertram to prevent his widow, Gwen (Ms. Leoni), from marrying Richard (Billy Campbell), a human-rights lawyer he believes is after her money, although the evidence he offers is flimsy. Gwen happens to live in the same Upper East Side apartment building as Bertram, and they have crossed paths many times. With each encounter Bertram has been monumentally rude, so befriending her is no easy task.  Mr. Kinnear, now that he has some lines on his face, is no longer a Ken doll exuding boyish naïveté. His genial martini-drinking charmer with a wandering eye and a raised brow is about as close as anyone has come in a recent movie to Cary Grant, who starred in the original “Topper” in 1937.  Most amusing of all is Ms. Leoni’s eccentric Egyptologist. Equally enamored of her enormous dog, which knocks her over now and again and whose odor triggers Bertram’s gag reflex, and a priceless mummy that is a centerpiece of a major exhibition she is putting together, Gwen solicits Bertram to conduct a professional examination of the mummy’s mouth.  Like Lombard’s and Jean Arthur’s plucky madcaps, Ms. Leoni’s Gwen is a gal who keeps a tight rein on her feelings. Crisp and self-reliant, she is all the more attractive for her apparent lack of interest in beauty, fashion and wedding bells. If the semiromantic connection she develops with Bertram (he’s smitten; she is interested but wary) isn’t totally convincing, theirs is a classic screwball relationship of sassy, openhearted combat. As Frank nags Bertram, and Bertram woos Gwen in his ridiculous way, the pace of mush-free repartee rarely flags.  “Ghost Town” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes racy dialogue.

It takes a good while for Ricky Gervais  to warm up in Ghost Town; it takes even longer for the audience to warm up to Ricky Gervais. During the opening minutes of the film—an occasionally effective mash-up of Ghost , The Sixth Sense , and The Frighteners —Gervais is nearly mute as Bertram Pincus, D.D.S. , a dentist who enjoys his work because it allows him the peace and quiet that comes with sticking cotton balls into his patients' mouths. He's a "sad little man," says one observer; "a fucking prick," says another. But following a brief period of death on an operating table, Bertram sees dead people. And the dead, of course, bring him back to life—especially Greg Kinnear 's tuxedoed Frank, offed while shouting down the realtor who revealed his affair. Frank latches onto Bertram in the desperate hope that he can bust up the remarriage of his widow (Tea Leoni ). If it sounds all so pale and predictable, it is. Director and co-writer David Koepp , more or less remaking his 1999 film Stir of Echoes with a romantic comedy's dopey grin this time, does little to break with the genre's conventions. But Ghost Town, dead on arrival throughout much of its first half, picks up as it slows down—when it ditches the decidedly dreary romantic slapshtick of the living and focuses, however briefly, on the needy, aching dead.
