There's probably a psychological term for obsessively returning to key moments of one's past, seeking renewed relevance and an illusion of youth.
For today's purposes, let's just call it "Rocky Balboa."
The sixth entry in the on-again/off-again saga of the Pug from Philly -- arriving 16 years after "Rocky V" -- is a surprisingly quiet affair for much of its running time. It harks back to the marble-mouth , proto-indie neighborhood sensibilities of the original 1976 "Rocky," before the series got hooked on steroids and went Hollywood. Like its hero, the movie is endearing, clumsy, and mawkish, and its joints creak alarmingly.
As nostalgic as this may be, it's probably necessary for no one but the man who made it. "Rocky Balboa" is about a 50-year-old boxer's last shot at glory, but it clearly represents the 60-year-old Sylvester Stallone's attempt to climb back in the ring after a career that has dwindled into inconsequence in the past decade.
Can you blame him for resurrecting his signature character? Where most aging jocks dust off their trophies, Stallone dusts off his training montage: the beef-carcass punching bag, the run up the museum steps. It's shameless, heartening, and fairly sad; the cinematic equivalent of a toupee that doesn't convince.
The law of sequels requiring one sacrifice per installment, everyone from the first "Rocky" is dead now except for the title character (Stallone) and his pal Paulie (Burt Young). This doesn't stop the ghost of Adrian from floating through, played by Talia Shire in sepia-tone clips from the earlier movies, or Rocky from tending her grave religiously. (That business about the crippling brain damage in "Rocky V"? Fuhgeddaboudit .)
Rocky runs a successful restaurant named after his dead wife; every night he poses for pictures and tells old stories. Philadelphians hail the Italian Stallion on the street but also take him for granted: He's a beloved cartoon. This chafes his yuppie son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), embarrassed of his pop and tired of living in his shadow, and it bugs Rocky, too.
It's a fertile subject for a movie -- the vanity and anxieties of an aging athlete -- but "Rocky Balboa" wants no part of it. Instead, the hero decides to start training again, spurred by a much-discussed computer simulation on TV that pits a young digital Rocky against current heavyweight champion Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver). The bout shows Balboa winning, and sometimes that's all an old man needs to start dreaming.
Rocky's appearance before the local boxing commission allows Stallone to write and perform one of the movie's Big Monologues about self-respect; like so much here, it's simultaneously noble and ridiculous. Much better are the scenes in which Rocky sort-of romances a single-mom bartender (Geraldine Hughes).
Stallone knows his "Marty" and "On the Waterfront" ready-mades, and these sequences have a gentle and genuine humor.
Don't ask how, but "Rocky Balboa" works its way up to an exhibition match between the aging lion and the young champ, a brassy Las Vegas affair with the crowd primed, once again, to cheer the underdog. Rocky has no knees, no speed, he can't spar; his only recourse, to quote one character, is "good old-fashioned blunt force trauma." Which is a pretty good description of the last third of the movie.
The first two rounds of the fight are taut and coherent, but then Stallone and editor Sean Albertson lose their grip, throwing every "Raging Bull" cutting-room trick at us in an endless, undifferentiated welter of images. It's a desperation move, and it reveals "Rocky Balboa" as the wishful fantasy it is.
This is no corporate project made to squeeze a few more dollars from a fading cash cow. No one else has been asking for another "Rocky," other than maybe Burt Young . No, this is a rarer beast -- an auteur sequel -- and it's so wrapped up in its maker's personal mythology and psychic needs that it becomes a hall of mirrors to which we're given a slack-jawed ringside seat.
The parallels between Rocky and Sly are everywhere, whenever Rock's son scoffs, "People will think you're crazy -- what are you trying to prove?" or when the old boy himself grumbles "There's still some stuff in the basement." This may be the first meta-movie for mooks. "Rocky Balboa" isn't a response to Stallone's late-life crisis, it is 
his late-life crisis, right up there on the screen. And if it doesn't do the trick, well, "Rambo IV" is in the works for 2008. No fooling. Can somebody break it to Sly that we all know it's a toupee?


         Think of "Rocky Balboa" as the "Rocky" film for those who can't be bothered counting up to six, or maybe for fighters who've taken so many punches to the head they need help remembering their hero's last name. Above all this is a film for gluttons for punishment, for those who never ever can get enough of Sylvester Stallone. Everyone else, please leave the building.
 
  Directed, written by and starring Mr. S, this "Rocky VI" by another name is a kind of Museum of Stallonic Technology, the equivalent of having a tour around the greatest hits of Rockydom personally guided by the man himself.
 


         






    Rocky running up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art? Check. Furiously pounding away at sides of beef? Check. Checking in on turtles Cuff and Link? Double check. There are even enough flashbacks of former costar Talia Shire as the Rock's late wife Adrian to get her a mention in the credits.
 
 
 FOR THE RECORD:

  'Rocky Balboa': The review of the movie "Rocky Balboa" in the Dec. 20 Calendar section said it had been more than 30 years since the character Rocky Balboa won his first heavyweight boxing championship. It has been 27 years. —
 

 
  It's been more than 30 years since Rocky Balboa won his first heavyweight championship, and time has hardly been kind to the ex-ex-ex-champion turned restaurateur. His middle is getting thick, his face thicker, and he spends so much time at Adrian's grave that he keeps a chair stashed in a nearby tree. Really.
 
  Though strangers still covet his autograph, Rocky's son Robert Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) wants as little to do with the old man as possible. Ditto his old pal Paulie (the inevitable Burt Young), who's turned into a sour and crabby Yoda. A woman named Little Marie (Geraldine Hughes) is somewhere in the mix, but even Rocky himself would be hard pressed to say exactly where.
 
  The Rock isn't paying too much attention, but the world has a new heavyweight champion in the person of a soulless technician named, no kidding, Mason "The Line" Dixon (former light heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver). "All of boxing," a sportscaster operatically laments, "is hoping for a warrior who thrills us with his passions."
 
  One guess who that might be.
 
  That's right, despite being something like 60 and so out of shape he could star in a remake of "Dead Man Walking," Rocky ends up in an exhibition match with The Line himself.
 
  The reason, in case you're interested, is that the old war horse feels he "still has some stuff in the basement." No, he's not talking about an old washing machine or a collapsed sofa. It's deeper than that. So the fight is on.
 
  This scenario may have sounded reasonable on paper, but to see it on film defines implausible. Truly, there is not enough suspendable disbelief in the world to convince us that an aged, decrepit Rocky could rehabilitate himself enough to go toe to toe with the champ, no matter how many stairs he climbs or sides of beef he pounds. But Rocky promptly does just that, daring us to do something about it.
 
  One of the odder consequences of this willfulness is that, instead of rooting for Rocky, who we all know will do just fine, we start to feel sorry for the clueless Mason Dixon who, like the unfortunate Washington Generals, is about to find out what it's like to take on the Harlem Globetrotters. The Line simply doesn't understand the deep wisdom of Little Marie when she says, "The last thing to age in somebody is their heart."
 
  Unless it's their ego.
 

 
 "Rocky Balboa."
 MPAA rating: PG for boxing violence and some language. Running time: 1 hour, 42 minutes. In general release.   

There is no movie this holiday season I wanted to see less than Rocky Balboa . Sylvester Stallone already had one go at resurrecting his most beloved character as a creaky, years-beyond-his-prime has-been, in Rocky V , and no one gave much of a damn then. So why should we care about Rocky again? It turns out that the added years only benefit the character, making him seem touchingly new because he's so old. In Rocky Balboa , Rocky, fast approaching AARP status (Stallone turned 60 this year), is in his late Jake La Motta phase  he's a droopy, shambling relic with calcified joints who runs an Italian eatery, entertaining customers with boxing tales they already know by heart. Since he's famous, we aren't asked to feel sorry for him (even as he moons over his late, beloved Adrian), and damned if Stallone  doesn't tap right back into the Rocky charm  the soft-brained lug logic and slurry nobility, the feeling, enhanced by his meat-locker bulk, that he's a caveman simpleton who knows only how to fight.
He gets his chance when ESPN runs a simulated bout between Rocky and the current champ, Mason ''The Line'' Dixon (Antonio Tarver), and the prospect of a cross-generational exhibition fight becomes a Vegas media jackpot. There is much to poke at in Rocky Balboa , yet the movie, with its amusingly updated ''Gonna Fly Now''  montage and its very niftily staged climactic bout, summons just enough incredulous wit about just how often Rocky has been around this particular block to let Sylvester Stallone earn his nostalgia.

 Aw, ya can’t help but love da big Palooka! Under all dem muscles the champ’s still got a heart o’ gold.  Who else could that be but Rocky Balboa? Sylvester Stallone’s endearing alter ego with the droopy eyes and dungeon-master croak has slouched back onto the screen, bowed but unbroken, to fight the good fight one more time. Since he was last seen 16 years ago in “Rocky V,” this two-time former heavyweight champion, now pushing 60 (Mr. Stallone’s age), has evolved a philosophy of the ring that befits an older, slower athlete.  The measure of a prizefighter is not how much punishment you can give but how much you can take, he declares more than once. In other words, heroism equals masochism; no gain without pain. Mel Gibson would understand.  Mr. Stallone’s body is a sight. A weightlifter’s slab of aged meat, knotted with tiny hard veins popping out of the shoulders, it is just this side of muscle-bound and somewhat grotesque. It is something you might see hung in the window of a steak house and wonder what kind of carnivore would order such a leathery, sinewy carcass.  When I first learned of this film, presumably the final episode in the “Rocky” franchise, the idea of the 60-year-old Rocky going at it one last time sounded risible. Reports of audiences snickering derisively at trailers for the movie seemed to confirm my expectations.  Surprisingly “Rocky Balboa,” is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It’s all heart and no credibility except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it.  For what T. S. Eliot wrote about humans being unable to bear “too much reality” is doubly true for moviegoers. Most of us go to the movies to sit in the dark and dream the impossible dream, whether it’s fighting a heavyweight bout or playing love scenes with Brad and Angelina.  Like “Rocky,” the Bicentennial fantasy that inaugurated the series, “Rocky Balboa” is a skeletal movie, a live-action cartoon that operates on cartoon logic. Don’t ask why this former heavyweight champion still lives in squalor in South Philadelphia while owning a popular restaurant named after his sainted wife, Adrian (now five years gone from cancer)? Don’t ask why his whiny son, Robert (Milo Ventimigilia), a charmless yuppie manqué with a chip on his shoulder, does not bear the slightest resemblance to his father.  Be happy to relive the good old times and to appreciate the touchstones that are dutifully trotted out. Here comes Rocky’s combative brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), a character seen in every Rocky movie and looking much the worse for wear, to loiter disconsolately at the restaurant for no particular reason. And here comes Bill Conti’s familiar blaring theme music when the action finally picks up.  Now more than ever Rocky Balboa seems a throwback to the era of the chaste noble athlete who is too pure for sex. He’d rather pray at the shrine of his dead wife than think of finding a new one. When the possibility of romance presents itself in the person of Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a barmaid and single mother, who in the original “Rocky” was a teenager who hurled abuse at him, he is oblivious. But she too is a throwback. Wide-eyed and pug-faced, tough but understanding, she is a true-blue sidekick for a Dead End Kid, and Rocky, in his infinite generosity, invites her to work in his restaurant.  “Rocky Balboa” drags its feet for a dangerously long time before the main course sashays onto the screen. When a computer-simulated match between Rocky (in his fighting prime) and the current heavyweight champion Mason (The Line) Dixon (the light heavyweight Antonio Tarver), determines that Rocky would win, people get excited. Dixon, though undefeated, has earned so little respect after a series of easy victories that his management decides that an exhibition match in which Dixon holds back his full power would be good for his career.  A grunting and heaving training montage follows, and finally the bout, a 10-round cliffhanger in Las Vegas with every bell and whistle activated, in which neither fighter holds back. And that’s it. Gonna fly now.  “Rocky Balboa” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has violence, but it’s confined to the ring.

After having seemingly been put out to pasture for good, the Italian Stallion returns after a 16-year hiatus for yet another comeback in "Rocky Balboa." The time away from the ring has done Rocky and the franchise some good, although it takes pic a good long while to gather momentum and clout before a surprisingly satisfying third-act heavyweight bout. Absence has fostered a certain fondness toward Stallone's mythic underdog that will translate into solid if not quite K.O. B.O. through the holidays, with fine vid tourneys to follow in '07.
The long stretch away from the ring for Philly's favorite son -- and for Stallone as director, it's been a full 21 years since "Rocky IV" -- has allowed a certain coursecorrection toward the grimier, small-scale sensibility of the 1976 original, helmed by John Avildsen. The title itself, eschewing the increasingly risible Roman numerals, denotes a change required after Avildsen's bloated "Rocky V," even as certain aspects of previous entry's storyline have been conveniently or oddly ignored in Stallone's script.
Even before the movie catches up with Rocky's personal life, it wastes no time establishing what every boxing fan knows: The heavyweight division is mired in mediocrity, with Mason "the Line" Dixon (played by ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) alone at the top and unable to scrounge up a meaningful competitor in his division. Unlike most of Rocky's past opponents, Dixon is seen as a pro without peer, unluckily fighting during the sport's lowest ebb.
Where pic runs into early trouble is with Rocky himself, who's mourning the loss of wife Adrian (once played by Talia Shire, seen here in a few brief, soundless memory images). Felled by cancer five years before, Adrian lives on as a kind of ghost, with her name still on the restaurant Rocky runs like a party host.
Whether in scenes opposite Burt Young (reprising Adrian's meatpacker brother Paulie) or with his son, Robert Jr. (played not by Stallone's son Sage, but by the unimpressive Milo Ventimiglia), Stallone's 60-year-old Rocky exhaustingly plays exhaustion, and early sections slog along. It hardly helps that Rocky and Paulie, sometimes resembling Beckett characters if they were goombahs, endlessly muse about how "the whole world is fallin' apart" but without a deeper sense of loss and regret.
The screenplay never knows exactly what to do with Robert Jr., a young man in the corporate world whose repeated complaints that he's living in Rocky's shadow come off as whiny and shallow. The ex-champ's standard of living, an issue in "Rocky V," is confused here, since on one hand he lives in the same beat-up Philly digs of yore yet owns and manages Adrian's restaurant, where business appears to be thriving.
The most interesting aspect of "Rocky Balboa" is how it considers the ways in which television has utterly transformed the sports world. A mock match, rendered in computer animation and pitting Rocky vs. Dixon, sets off a flurry of debate (ESPN regular Skip Bayless cracks that Rocky's specialty in the ring should be "pounded chicken") that generates interest in staging the real thing. Thus, plot hinges on hype generated by a cable channel -- an all-too-credible scenario in contempo sports.
It awakens Rocky, and Stallone, to new possibilities. To Robert Jr.'s horror, dad wants to fight again, and Rocky's barkeep friend Marie (Geraldine Hughes) ends up supporting his new impossible dream. In script's worst stroke of creative amnesia, Rocky's brain damage in previous pic is utterly ignored, as if it had vanished into thin air. Even an initial rejection by the Pennsylvania boxing commission can't stop Rocky from meeting Dixon in a lavish exhibition match in Vegas.
Final build toward the bout is handled with real pleasure by Stallone and editor Sean Albertson, effortlessly tossing in several iconic "Rocky" movie images -- from the egg drink to the raw-meat punching bag -- that work as celebration rather than self-parody. Match itself is remarkable for being largely staged and shot like an actual HBO pay-per-view event, from lensing in HD to HBO's Jim Lampley (with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman) doing the play-by-play.
Without Hughes' solid, blue-collar humanity as Marie, pic's first half would be pure drudgery, and the fact that Rocky and Marie show no sexual sparks enhances their scenes' emotional clarity. Young's Paulie feels tired and dull, while Tarver is shrewdly asked to play a close version of himself. James Francis Kelly III, as the African-American son of Marie (who's Anglo), is intro'd with much fanfare and then given little to do -- or may have had his part trimmed in the editing room.
Though Stallone directs with little visual inspiration outside the ring sequence, he sticks to the original's up-from-the-streets spirit and rejects the slickness that had crept into the franchise. He also leaves no doubt in the final shot that this is the end of the Rocky saga. Capper is a lighthearted montage over closing credits of everyday folks running up the Philadelphia museum steps a la their hero.

Bankrupt and brain-damaged in Rocky V , a bout fought so long ago that the other Bush was still sucker-punching Saddam , Sylvester Stallone 's titular pugilist returns to issue another beating in Rocky Balboa  .
How much punishment can an audience take? Even 007 gets his license renewed by younger models every decade, but not Rocky, who by now has arthritis in his neck, calcium deposits in his legs, and as before, pebbles in his head. But, yo, those arms are like tree trunks. And pushing 60 or not, this fighter is all heart. As for Stallone, he tends to lead with his chinand I don't mean that metaphorically. Leaning forward when he speaks, the veteran actor projects as if he's looking to get hit, particularly in the scene with the Philly athletic commission, which threatens to deny ol' Rocky's application for a new boxing license. "Maybe you're just doing your job," sputters Rocky, his aching neck stretched from here to Palookaville, "but why you gotta stop me from doing mine?" Not that Stallone's comeback compares to the Greatest's for pure provocation, but it gets you thinking: Does life imitate the ring or vice versa? And speaking of jobs to do, how different was the dialogue when the stallion known as Sly stood toe-to-toe with MGM's roaring lion and begged its commissioners for another round?
Rocky Balboa , effortlessly reflexive and patently, even proudly, absurd, is a tough movie to dislikeand believe me, I've tried. Stallone's "deez, dem, doze" routine truly echoes a bygone era even as his most famous character continues to epitomize the times. In '76, the tough guy went the distance and lost, like our troops in Vietnam . In '85, he fought the Cold War in the form of Dolph Lundgren 's red Drago and, like Reagan, he wonwrapped in the American flag, yet. Now Rocky VI  equals Bush II : However bloody things get, the born fighter refuses to throw in the towel. "Nuttin' hits harder than life," the Stallion surmises. "It's about how much you can take and keep movin' forward"chin-first, presumably.
Things have changed for this great white hope since he first fought for freedom against the tellingly named Apollo Creed  in our bicentennial year. In '06, Balboa's belated return to the ring can be blamed, like this DVD-ready sequel, on the digital revolution: The ESPN  Boxing channel's computer simulation program predicts that the Italian Stallion, at least as he was in his prime, could take the current heavyweight champ, Mason "the Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver ) by K.O. Naturally, neither Rocky, now a restaurateur, nor Mason Dixon (named for the thin line between drama and comedy?) can resist when a promoter's Vegas exhibition offer follows.
Other things are different too. Rocky's sidekick Adrian has succumbed to what he calls, with characteristic sensitivity, "the woman cancer." The site of the odd couple's legendary ice-skating date is now a vacant lot strewn with garbage, the old neighborhood looking more than ever like a white ghetto. "Whole world's fallin' apart," claims Adrian's astute brother Paulie (Burt Young ), still clock punching at the meatpacking plant but painting like van Gogh in between slab inspections. Still, some things never change. Our hero's training outfit is a gray hoodie with matching sweatpants; his vitamin water is a raw egg, his punching bag a side of beef. His new muse is a shy bartender (Geraldine Hughes )-Rocky likes the shy onesand as in matches past, we know our boxer is getting serious about payback when, halfway through the film, he starts talking to himself, sparring with the more existential aspects of brawling. "Am I just tryin' to replace old pain with new pain?"
Ask a narcissist a stupid question and you get a stupid answer, but that's not to say it won't be funny. Maybe all-out parody would've better suited Rocky Balboa Stallone getting Rocky to start reading Henry James  and dreaming of a tenure-track gig in the lit department at Penn or something. But earnest as it is, the movie hardly resists laughs. Identifying solely with a forlorn old mutt named Punchy, Rocky has become a philosopher in his old age. "A few too many birthdays," he says, "shouldn't be a reason not to fight." Nor to write and direct and starshirtless, even! Stallone would like us to think that Rocky hasn't aged at all, although, gazing at the old buildings in the 'hood, the fighter does allow that if he were 150 years old, he'd be falling apart too. We'll know for sure in about 90 years, when the Stallion trains for his nursing- home rematch against China Man.
