Based on Armistead Maupin�s 2000 novel of the same name, this taut, wiry exercise in eerie bad vibes saddles its protagonist, New York-based writer-cum-radio personality Gabriel Noone (Williams), with not only the unexpected exit of his longtime companion Jess (Cannavale of Will & Grace
 and Happy Endings
) but also an increasingly bizarre series of events involving a teenage victim of childhood abuse. That boy, Pete Logand (Culkin), has turned his demons into prose and that prose into what may very well be the literary debut of the year. At the urging of his publisher (Joe Morton), Noone reaches out to the boy, who lives in rural Wisconsin with his mother Donna (Collette), via a phone call, which then leads to suspicions that neither Pete, who is dying of AIDS, nor his mother is completely who he or she seems to be. But is Noone cracking up in the debris of his relationship, or is there something genuinely amiss? Part postmillennial meditation � on loss and love and where, exactly, those two emotional shipwrecks diverge, only later to meet up in wholly unexpected ways � and part semisuspenseful mystery-film oddity, this is a grim ride that nevertheless ends on a note of hope. As it turns out, Jess, too, has AIDS, but thanks to postmillennial pharmaceuticals he�s suddenly no longer imminently doomed, nor does he need Noone to care for him around the clock. The situation gives him both a future and the curiosity about what might be beyond Noone�s townhouse door, which, of course, sends Noone off his otherwise-even keel. It�s unlike anything else out now, and Williams, to his credit and our immense relief, has for the moment foresworn his usual giddiness in favor of a muted, hunched acting style that befits both the character of Noone and the overall tone of the film. There are precious few smiles on display here, and the ones that flicker around the edges of Williams� mouth are tentative and confused. Melancholy sits atop both the night listener and the night speaker, and it might all be too much to bear were it not for Toni Collette, who continues to amaze and disturb; she so fully inhabits the role of Pete�s mother, Donna � who may or may not be utterly unhinged � that it�s downright uncomfortable to watch as Noone tries to get a straight answer from her about her child. Half the time Collette seems as ephemeral as one of the shades from The Sixth Sense
, but moments later she�s spitting fire and morphing into a windswept northern harpy. Running just under 90 minutes, The Night Listener
 is emotionally dense but never fully takes flight. It feels
 brief, and while far too many studio films bog themselves down in overlong fits of action and exposition, this is one film from which you leave the dark feeling it concluded, if anything, too soon. Without giving it all away, Maupin�s vaguely Kafka-esque storyline has had its own literary doppelganger in the real world (which, if you�re familiar with the writing of J.T. Leroy, will only serve to rattle you more). What�s really real, after all? At the end, not even Maupin can say for sure.


``The Night Listener" really wants us to know that the grubby particulars of its story have been inspired by true events. That disclaimer is just about all that keeps this absurd yet watchable thriller from going any farther off the rails. Adapted from Armistead Maupin's highly anticipated, woefully executed 2000 novel, this is surely among the best bad movies of the year. With sanctimonious Robin Williams versus blind Toni Collette, how could it not be?
Williams plays Gabriel Noonan, a famous author who gets a copy of a manuscript from a 15-year-old named Pete (Rory Culkin). It tells of abuse, torture, prostitution, and worse (syphilis at 8, AIDS by 14), and the movie is all too happy to give us quick, sordid reenactments of the memoir's horrors. Pete happens to be a fan of Gabriel's late-night radio show, which, based on the funereal way Williams speaks into the microphone, could be called ``A Scary Home Companion."
As it turns out, Gabriel is just depressed. After eight years, his handsome younger boyfriend, Jess (Bobby Cannavale), is leaving him. But Jess is around often enough to find the budding phone relationship between Gabriel and the kid a little unnerving. No kidding.
Jess finds something strange about Pete's personality, an observation that strikes Gabriel as mean. But it's not long until he's off from New York to Wisconsin to see for himself if Jess is right, visiting Pete and Donna (Collette), the dowdy woman who's been taking care of him.
What ensues suggests ``Misery" as reframed through the recent JT LeRoy scandal. The movie isn't particularly well made -- director Patrick Stettner lent a defter hand to his last film, ``The Business of Strangers." What few ideas there were in Maupin's platitudinous book are now gone, courtesy, in part, of Maupin himself. So, mercifully, are a lot of the platitudes. (He, Stettner , and Terry Anderson are credited with the screenplay.)
Stettner manages to keep the pot boiling, although, sadly, it never quite runneth over. Instead, the movie trades suspense for the kind of melodramatic earnestness of which only Robin Williams seems capable. Gabriel is caught snooping and trespassing, but nothing can stop his pursuit of the truth, not even almost being hit by a speeding truck.
The actor has made Gabriel so pathetic and slightly bitter that sympathy for him often feels out of the question. Anybody who lets his accountant come over and straighten up needs to snap out of it, even if the accountant is played by Sandra Oh.
What makes the film such a guilty pleasure is how Williams's righteous self-pity is perfectly matched to Collette's nuttiness and despair. There's something nightmarish yet familiarly co-dependent about their relationship. In one terrifying scene, when Donna asks Gabriel whether he likes the sweater she's knitted for herself and he doesn't say anything, the silence hurts her feelings and makes her crazy. Suddenly, ``The Night Listener" turns into a horror film: Will and Grace go to hell.


Is The Night Listener  a wintry drama with a few schlocky jolts, or an underdone psychological thriller straining for some dramatic heft on the side? Hard to tell, but either way, the movie doesn't cohere.
Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noone, a burned-out nighttime radio host who gets some of his mojo back when he befriends, over the phone, both Pete (Rory Culkin), a dying 14-year-old who's written a gripping memoir about the sexual abuse in his past, and Pete's  foster mom Donna (Toni Collette). Who are these two? Without giving anything away, let's just say Listener  is based on Tales of the City  author Armistead Maupin's fictionalized 2000 account of how he, in real life, fell in with a kid memoir-writer whose CV never quite checked out.
But nothing in the restrained mystery of the nicely acted first half, set to Peter Nashel's Philip Glass-y score and featuring Sandra Oh and Bobby Cannavale in quick supporting parts, sets up the veering tonal shift once Noone arrives in cold Wisconsin to suss out what's going on with his new friends. The Night Listener  is like Shattered Glass  with real shattered glass. Unexpectedly, this turns out to be one of those horror-thrillers where characters lying in the street see the headlights of the semitruck coming from far off and still have to jump out of the way at the last minute because, in these kinds of movies, semis are like trains and apparently they can't stop.

 Based on a novel by Armistead Maupin, which was based in turn on an episode in Mr. Maupin’s life, “The Night Listener” explores a shadowy region between truth and fiction. Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams), a middle-aged writer with a radio show and a foundering relationship — his younger boyfriend, Jess (Bobby Cannavale), has just moved out — strikes up a long-distance friendship with a teenager named Pete who claims to be one of Gabriel’s biggest fans. The boy, who has AIDS, is also the author of a memoir describing the horrific sexual abuse he suffered before he was adopted by Donna (Toni Collette), a kind-hearted nurse.  But does Pete (played, mostly in flashbacks and fantasy sequences, by Rory Culkin) really exist? That is among the questions that haunt Mr. Maupin’s book, but it is pretty much the only question addressed by this well-meaning, flat-footed screen adaptation, directed by Patrick Stettner and written by Mr. Stettner, Mr. Maupin and Terry Anderson.  The film has its creepy, suspenseful moments — especially when Gabriel travels to Wisconsin in search of Pete and has a series of unsettling encounters with Donna — but it shrinks a rich, strange story to the dimensions of an anecdote. The intensity of Gabriel’s connection to his young friend, who seems to be a lonely, needy soul reaching out across empty space, is posited, but never adequately dramatized. Neither Pete’s charisma nor the source of Gabriel’s susceptibility to it is given much shape or force.  Mr. Williams, in one of his blessedly shtick-free performances, effectively conveys Gabriel’s weary, worried stoicism, but the movie limits his character to a few easy, literal motivations. A scene with Gabriel’s bluff, Southern father (John Cullum) is intriguing without being especially illuminating, and Mr. Cannavale’s character seems more functional than real.    We understand that Gabriel, who nursed Jess through a period of life-threatening illness, needs someone to protect and care for, and that Pete represents a beguiling mixture of toughness and innocence, but the psychological and intellectual implications that hover over the story are lost in the spooky atmospherics and overshadowed by Ms. Collette’s off-kilter showboating.  The story told in “The Night Listener” resonates uncannily with the curious case of J. T. Leroy, whose literary renderings of a blighted childhood were recently revealed as a hoax. Clearly, there is something about tales of violated innocence, the more extreme the better, that invites credulity. Why would anyone make up such horrible stories? Why would anyone believe — or, for that matter, doubt — them? Those questions hover in the background of this film, which scratches its head and shrugs them off.    “The Night Listener” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual references.

The harrowing memoir that fuels the central intrigue of Armistead Maupin's novel "The Night Listener" has much in common with the writings of JT LeRoy in its raw account of childhood sexual exploitation and its lingering consequences. And given how much film blurs the lines between truth and fiction in attempting to ascertain the author's identity, it seems appropriate that the story arrives onscreen just weeks after LeRoy was exposed as a fraud. But timeliness is not enough to endow Patrick Stettner's tediously solemn film with tension or dramatic texture, casting a pall on its commercial outlook.
Coming so soon after LeRoy was unmasked as a fictitious figure, and after author James Frey owned up to embellishing the facts in his bestselling memoir "A Million Little Pieces," a swift release could significantly expand the film's editorial coverage. (U.S. rights were still available at Sundance; IFC Films provided financing but has not committed to distribution.) However, "Night Listener's" remarkable relevance to the current debate about literary license simply underlines what a missed opportunity this is.
Given the sharp edges, psychological complexity and chilly mood of his stylish 2001 debut feature, "The Business of Strangers," Stettner seemed a fine choice to direct Maupin's twisty tale of a radio host dealing with the end of a relationship while investigating the origins of a troubling manuscript (Maupin was inspired by his own entanglement with a literary hoax). But the qualities that distinguished Stettner's earlier work -- including the ability to elicit compelling, thorny performances -- are largely elusive here.
One problem is a by-the-numbers screenplay adapted by Maupin, Terry Anderson and Stettner, which shifts the initial action from San Francisco to New York to no apparent gain. The miscasting of Robin Williams as radio personality Gabriel Noone is another.
Gabriel combs through his life for elements that can be spun into good stories. In addition to his own experiences, his long-term boyfriend Jess' (Bobby Cannavale) struggle to overcome HIV has fed the personal tales Gabriel recounts to listeners of his popular late night show. But when Jess chooses to embrace his independence after his health improves, Gabriel's creative well runs dry.
A publisher friend, Ashe (Joe Morton), gives Gabriel a manuscript to read, in which 14-year-old Pete Logand (Rory Culkin) chronicles his shocking abuse at the hands of sadistic parents. An avid fan of Gabriel's show, the boy contacts him soon after and a phone friendship develops. Their talks are punctuated by reports from Pete's protective stepmother, Donna (Toni Collette), of the AIDS-afflicted boy's rapidly deteriorating health.
When Gabriel begins to suspect that Donna and Pete may be the same person, he voices his skepticism to Ashe, who confirms that no one has actually met the boy. Feeling responsible when the publishing house backs away from a deal on Pete's book, Gabriel travels to the Logands' home in small-town Wisconsin to find the truth.
Aiming for unsettling atmosphere over character definition, the dawdling mystery thriller manages to flatten two protagonists that had far more depth in the novel.
Williams' Gabriel is all tormented half-smiles, crinkled eyes and wounded nobility. We're told that his storyteller's instinct and eagerness to absorb material for his own creative use make him not unlike chronic fabulist Donna. But there's little in Williams' one-note performance to suggest anything beyond the generic obsession of an amateur sleuth.
The normally dependable Collette plays a character so unsatisfyingly developed that it's hard to care much about the haunted woman or the veracity of her claims, despite the screenplay's belabored efforts to tease out the uncertainty.
Cannavale, Culkin and Sandra Oh as Gabriel's accountant all do fine within the limited scope of their roles.
Lenser Lisa Rinzler gives the film a somber, elegant look, and Peter Nashel's score adds a layer of intensity. But it takes more than a few brooding strings to make a film taut and tense. The pace drags increasingly, trudging through the protracted final reels to a clumsy wrap-up with too many concluding scenes, none of them effective.

As a consideration of the power of storytellingand the urge to mythologize one's own life as well as the lives of others The Night Listener  could serve as creepy paranoid cousin to the current Lady in the Water . The specters of JT LeRoy  and James Frey  haunt this muted psychological thriller about a radio yarn-spinner (Robin Williams , effectively underplaying) beguiled by a 14-year-old fan's lurid memoir of rape and victimization. The closer he gets to the dying boy, who's accessible only by phone, the more he starts to wonder if the kid really existsa possibility the boy's caretaker (Toni Collette ) extends as either a lifeline or a noose. Armistead Maupin  helped adapt the screenplay from his novel, itself spun from a real-life anecdote involving a suspicious fan, and Patrick Stettner 's stealthy film version seethes with the ambivalence of a writer who treats the people around him as straw to be spun into gold. Even when the script overstates the obvious, Stettner mines every nuance of unease from the head games between Williams and the unnerving Collette, who embodies the moment passive aggression stops being passive.
