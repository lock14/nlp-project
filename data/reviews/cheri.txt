At the end of the Belle �poque, Colette wrote of Madame L�a de Lonval and her �big blue wandering eyes,� but one can�t really imagine anything wandering about Michelle Pfeiffer. (Big blue, for sure, but wandering?) Beneath that ethereal coo of a voice, she has a signature sharpness, the impression of hard angles swathed in a deceptively delicate frame; even in collapse � and she�s had some mighty swoons in The Age of Innocence
 and Frears' Dangerous Liaisons
 � there�s fixedness and control. They don�t make women, sexy but regal, like Pfeiffer much anymore, and Cheri
 is quite a monument to her. (Good on that, because not only do they not make women like that anymore, they don�t hire them to top-bill major motion pictures, either.) Here, as a courtesan aging out of an industry and an epoch, Pfeiffer is enmeshed in another dangerous liaison, this one with the child of a once fellow, now former, courtesan named Madame Peloux, who is played by the sporting but still miscast Kathy Bates. (Onetime Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg, who knows a thing or two about driving men wild, pops up as another retired courtesan.) Peloux�s son, Ch�ri (Friend), is spoiled, unformed, and 30-plus years L�a�s junior. L�a takes him on initially as a project, a twilight-years lark � call it expiration-date dating � and Ch�ri is content to coast through the relationship as with everything else in his overindulged and underloved life. But it isn't until their forced separation, when Ch�ri allows his mother to arrange a marriage for him, that the true depths of Ch�ri and L�a�s feelings for each other emerge � complex feelings colored by real-world concerns of practicality, propriety, and the tragic mismatch of their birthdates (and what a pleasure to watch a romantic drama in which the recognition of love, the simple statement of fact, doesn�t mark the end-reel waltz into ever-after). This is sensual, cerebral, and surprisingly weighty stuff, which should come as no surprise to anyone who�s been following the careers of Frears, critically neglected, perhaps, because he�s so hard to pin down (good luck tracking a CV that�s gone from My Beautiful Laundrette
 to beautiful Grifters
 and The Queen
 in a public relations crisis), and his screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, who can add Colette to the list of authors � Graham Greene, Ian McEwan, Joseph Conrad � he�s done right by. Only in its last moments does Cheri
 faintly bobble, with an overpacked final confrontation, no room for reflection, and a rushed coda. That epilogue is something of a cheat, really � it plucks Ch�ri�s fate from Colette�s follow-up novella, the aptly named The Last of Ch�ri
, but doesn�t divulge L�a�s, which was to age, inevitably, into �a broad back and the padded cushion of a fat neck beneath a head of thick grey vigorous hair.� Then again, Pfeiffer with a fat neck? Like anybody'd believe that.

It takes a while for “Cheri’’ to limber up and get to the heart of the matter. A Belle Époque romantic drama reuniting some of the talents from 1988’s “Dangerous Liaisons’’  - director Stephen Frears, star Michelle Pfeiffer, writer Christopher Hampton  - the movie at first seems a waxwork parody of Merchant Ivory-style filmmaking. It’s all bustles and brocades and arch dialogue, and there’s the additional incongruity of a California blonde amid the 1890s stemware.
Yet Pfeiffer has worn period gowns before, in “Liaisons’’ and 1993’s “The Age of Innocence,’’ and she has worn them well. If her voice remains flatly American, as an actress she’s alive to the genre’s diplomatic nuances  - the way a woman in a corseted society can say one thing while meaning the exact opposite.
“Cheri’’ is based on a pair of novels by the French writer Colette, the first of which caused a scandal by turning the cliches of romantic fiction upside down. For one thing, Cheri is a man, a young and dissolute Parisian played with Pre-Raphaelite fragility by Rupert Friend. For another, his lover, Lea de Lonval (Pfeiffer), is several decades older than he. For a third, she’s a courtesan, recently retired. “Women who do what we do, no one else would understand,’’ Lea says. Well, yes, but we live vicariously through fiction. Colette knew that and so do movie producers.
Cheri’s mother, Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates), is a former courtesan herself, living opulently on the earnings of a professional mistress. She’s a battle-ax and a busybody  - stuffed into her bodices like a sausage, Bates has a high old time  - and she tosses her son to her friend Lea for a little toughening up. Six years later, the pair are still together, comfortable without ever confessing to emotional intimacy. That only comes when Madame Peloux arranges Cheri’s marriage to the innocent young Edmee (Felicity Jones).
Separated, Lea and Cheri maintain respective stiff yet wobbly upper lips. “Cheri’’ is a less tart story onscreen than on the page, and its keynote is pining. Pfeiffer and Friend each wilt in interesting ways, she with ladylike stoicism, he with brooding petulance, and Friend is a good enough actor to play to the thwarted little boy under the dashing young man.
All well and good, and nothing you haven’t seen in other movies where the characters tend to get upstaged by the drapery. What makes “Cheri’’ worth your while is that its true subjects are women and age, and its observations apply to both 19th-century France and the modern film industry. Like her character, Pfeiffer is a celebrated beauty on the far side of the curve, doomed by a Hollywood that, to quote “The First Wives Club,’’ thinks the three ages of women are babe, district attorney, and Miss Daisy.
The actress knows this. The proof’s in her performance, a surprisingly layered work of confidence, panic, acceptance, and vanity (both Pfeiffer’s and her character’s). Lea keeps looking at her hands as if expecting her skin to betray her; at times, Frears and his cinematographer Darius Khondji cruelly turn up the lights to accentuate the pallor and sag of Pfeiffer’s face. There’s an awareness, too, of the ways civilized society turns beauty into a commodity. “What am I worth to you?’’ Lea scornfully asks Cheri, and the question ripples right out past the screen.
The movie introduces a few old harlots who are grotesque parodies of Lea, the couple’s worst fears made flesh. None is as arresting as Anita Pallenberg, the bad-girl beauty of the British ’60s pop scene and now a withered beldame who resembles nothing so much as her onetime lover Keith Richards in drag. Cheri asks about her pearls. “They’re fake,’’ she gleefully croaks.
If the movie were better  - less swoony, more relentless  - it might be unbearable to watch. As it is, “Cheri’’ touches on the insecure egotism of courtesans and movie stars with a knowing firmness. Yes, Pfeiffer’s still one of the most beautiful women in the business, but what does that get you in a business addicted to youth? In the movie’s most harrowing image, she stares through the mirror of the camera lens into the audience itself. Does she want us to reflect back what she once was or what she will be? I’m not sure even Pfeiffer knows.
.

         Michelle Pfeiffer is back, and her reappearance in "Cheri," her best role in quite some time, underlines not only how much she's been missed but also how much the world of film has lost by her absence.

Of course, Pfeiffer has not literally been gone in the seven years since her last substantial dramatic role in "White Oleander," but the parts she's taken on, while they may have been the best the movie business has seen fit to offer, have not done justice to her abilities.



         






  For though she looks lovely, Pfeiffer, now 51, has gotten to that time of life that Hollywood regards as dangerous from a box office point of view. So it is more than a little pointed that "Cheri," directed by the always reliable Stephen Frears, happens to be about a woman whose increasing age is also problematic. Lea de Lonval is not a movie star, however; she's a courtesan on the cusp of retirement.

Taken from a pair of 1920s novels by Colette and set in the waning years of France's pre-World War I belle 
époque
, "Cheri" introduces us to a group of women collectively known as les grandes horizontals
, high-class prostitutes who achieved wealth and celebrity but were unable to make friends or any kind of life outside their profession. 

Pfeiffer's Lea is a member in good standing of this group, and at age 49 thinking of getting out of the game. "Is there anything in the world more wonderful," she says longingly to her maid, "than a bed all to yourself?"

But Lea reckons without the machinations of her frenemy and fellow courtesan Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates). Charlotte's 19-year-old wastrel son Fred (Rupert Friend), familiarly known as Cheri, is spending his life in nonstop debauchery and his scheming mother would like nothing better than to have Lea, who's known Cheri since he was a child, romantically take him off her hands.

This comes to pass, but to the astonishment of all involved, especially Lea and Cheri, this supposed brief affair lasts six years. It's only at this point that things get serious for our protagonists and, finally, for this examination of life and love among the professionally heartless.

For though it is written by Christopher Hampton, who won an Oscar turning "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" into "Dangerous Liaisons" for Frears and Pfeiffer in 1988, "Cheri" is sluggish at the start despite having a lot of things going for it.

As shot by the expert Darius Khondji, "Cheri" makes the most of its real-life French locations and settings (Alan MacDonald was the production designer), including airy Art Nouveau homes and brooding "Merchant Ivory: The Brothel Years" interiors. And it will not be a surprise that Pfeiffer looks just so in Consalata Boyle's elegant gowns.

Pfeiffer and Friend also have excellent on-screen chemistry. His role, that of the classic darkly brooding callow youth, is the more prone to cliche, but Friend, who played the caddish Mr. Wickham in the Keira Knightley "Pride and Prejudice," brings a welcome level of reality to his performance. 

As for Pfeiffer, she has an aura around her throughout the film, an air of timeless beauty that is always welcome.

Yet all this aside, it is inescapable that the early parts of "Cheri" have a quality of banality to them, with both "that child will be the death of me" dialogue and uninvolving acting leading us to wonder what all the fuss is about.

But "Cheri's" plot takes an unlooked-for turn. Something happens to force Lea and Cheri to consider whether they've inadvertently entered into the most dangerous liaison of all, if they've broken the unspoken commandment in their world and actually fallen in love.

The resulting schemes and intrigues and the emotional dynamics that follow in their wake bring "Cheri" to life. They also add a deeper, more moving level to Pfeiffer's performance, as her character's sadness and confusion at the turns the relationship takes make Pfeiffer look ravaged and care-worn for the first time. 

Especially effective in this vein are the wordless scenes that catch Lea unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world. It's the kind of refined, delicate acting Pfeiffer does so well, and it's a further reminder of how much we've missed her since she's been away.



   

The whole Paleolithic movie universe, in which a leading man like Harrison Ford trudges through action films into his 60s while actresses like Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange are ''washed up'' by the time they reach their mid-40s, might straighten itself out pronto if everyone were to go see Chéri . At 51, Pfeiffer has never  I mean it, never   looked more ravishing then she does as Léa, the fancy-free Paris courtesan of Colette's 1920 novel and its sequel. The actress is twinkly and creamy-skinned; she makes Léa a glowing, knowing, temperamentally ageless coquette. But the real freshness of her performance is that, in a movie that has Léa involve herself with a much younger man  the louche, gullible Chéri (Rupert Friend), who's the wealthy son of one of her courtesan colleagues (Kathy Bates)  Pfeiffer transcends any hint of cliché ''cougar'' voraciousness.
These two lovebirds are playfully mismatched, and that's just why they fall for each other. So when Chéri chooses, unwisely, to exit their romance for an arranged marriage, Léa plots to woo him back  by feigning merry indifference. And that, more or less, is the entire movie. Directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Christopher Hampton, Chéri  is like Dangerous Liaisons  (which Frears also directed) reduced to a tasty morsel, an anecdote of wily and deceptive love. It is, if anything, an overly slender movie, yet its images of Belle Epoque high life are delectably lush, and if there were more to the story, it might not have such a delicate charm. Pfeiffer makes Léa that rare thing, an angelic schemer, and Friend, who was one of the supporting weasels in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice , proves a leading man of perverse fascination. As Chéri, he's like a decadent cross between Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, with a puckish dimple of a mouth and a pose of snobbery that never quite conceals the heartache beneath it. He's the entitled aristocrat next door.

 “One who is abnormal must never feel abnormal,” the French novelist Colette once wrote to a friend. Instead, he or she thinks, “What is this world full of monstrous pigs who are different from me?” What words to live — or rather to write — by! Born in an age of corsets and legalized prejudice (1873-1954), Colette scandalized society with her colorful life, lovers of both sexes and demimonde characters. Her inspirations were artists not of the pen but of the bedroom, women whose idea of the bottom line, to quote the critic Judith Thurman, “was 50 thousand a year and a villa of one’s own — with a big garden, a great chef, and a pretty boy.”  One such character is Léa de Lonval, the Parisian courtesan in Colette’s brilliant 1920 novel “Chéri” who’s played by Michelle Pfeiffer in a pretty adaptation from the director Stephen Frears. Over her long career as a professional coquette, Léa has reaped ample rewards and seemingly few serious regrets. Six years before the novel opens, she also acquired a much-younger lover, the fatal beauty of the book’s title — “a graceful demon” in Colette’s words, played by the striking Rupert Friend — whose appeal for her is as openly maternal as it is unabashedly erotic. Léa even goes so far as to call the affair an adoption, a description that seems rather less metaphoric whenever her “naughty child” rests his cheek on her breasts.  The affair between Léa and Chéri is nudged into existence, perhaps knowingly, by her friend and his mother, Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates). Herself a former courtesan, Charlotte solicits Léa’s help with Chéri, a 19-year-old who’s cultivating his dissolution. With cheekbones so sharply angled they look like they could slice through a caressing hand, Chéri seems a perilous project. But Léa, who’s known him since he was a child, scoops him up as thoughtlessly as she would a puppy. Years later, the affair takes a sharp turn when he announces that his mother has arranged for him to marry a suitable prospect with a significant dowry, Edmée (Felicity Jones), an innocent who guilelessly upends this world.  Decadence perfumes this deceptively tragic story. Much like the opium smoke that wafts through one scene, Léa and Chéri’s affair has left a great deal of wreckage in its seductive wake. It takes time to assess the damage, and Mr. Frears, working from Christopher Hampton’s intelligently compressed adaptation (the two were also united on the 1988 film “Dangerous Liaisons”), seems in no hurry to break the bad news. Working with the cinematographer Darius Khondji and a host of other talented artisans, he luxuriates in the Belle Époque milieu, with its sumptuous clothes, gaudy homes and heavily bloomed gardens, almost as self-indulgently as Léa lounges in bed. The camera lingers over the silks and furs with an almost sentimental attachment.  Mr. Frears and Léa are each in the business of seduction, of course. And both are extremely gifted at what they do. What’s surprising, at least at first, is how eagerly Mr. Frears wants to please the audience or at least leave it untroubled. Though the film cannot rightly be characterized as soft — the cruel, often funny verbal barbs invest it with pleasurable prickliness — there’s a certain reserve, even hesitancy to his direction that in part may have something to do with the conundrum presented by Ms. Pfeiffer’s casting. After decades of pleasuring others, Léa now faces an empty bed, a state of declining affairs that has taken on extra resonance in the story’s transposition from page to screen.  It’s perhaps inevitable that the film becomes something of a story about what happens to beautiful Hollywood stars. Ms. Pfeiffer is now 51, and her success has largely rested on a combination of extraordinary looks and an underlying fragility that dilutes the threat that great beauty can bring with it. No matter the role, with her watery eyes and slender limbs, she often seems on the verge of breaking. She can seem as brittle as a twig and just as easy to snap. At other times, you see the steeliness that comes with any sustained and successful movie career. In “Chéri” you see the frailty and the strength, yet you rarely experience either with the depth of feeling you might because of the palpable uneasiness surrounding her performance.  That uneasiness is most evident in Mr. Frears’s decision to shoot Ms. Pfeiffer almost entirely in circumspect medium and long shot, as if she were a fine jewel in a shop window rather than a flesh-and-blood woman. Yet in flattering Ms. Pfeiffer, he also ends up insulting her talent. Even a lingering close-up of her face, which is meant to reveal how Chéri suddenly sees Léa in the harsh light of day, backfires and not only because, like most Hollywood stars of her age, Ms. Pfeiffer looks all of 40. There’s something poignant about the image of this actress sitting in a pool of sunlight without a smile or trace of visible makeup. But she’s trying to reach a character that her director seems intent to keep from her grasp.  “Chéri” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Discreet sex and harsh sentiments.

Like a passable bottle of champagne, "Cheri" fizzes and slides down quite easily but lacks real body and doesn't really hit the spot. Driven along by Alexandre Desplat's busy score, scrumptious duds by Consolata Boyle, pastel-tinged widescreen lensing by Darius Khondji and, most of all, by Kathy Bates' scene-stealing turn, this Stephen Frears-Christopher Hampton adaptation of Colette's famous Belle Epoque tale of romance between an experienced older courtesan and a spoiled youth is, like Michelle Pfeiffer's lead perf, short on real passion and emotion. Moderate rather than sparkling biz looks likely.
This latest adaptation of two novels -- "Cheri" and sequel "The Last of Cheri" -- published by French scribe/bonne viveuse Colette ("Gigi") in the 1920s goes out in Blighty in late March and then Stateside via Miramax.
Frears himself provides a wry, occasional voiceover that sets the tone at the start, describing the rise to prominence of high-society courtesans toward the end of the 19th century before being swept away by WWI. But though famous Parisian watering hole Maxim's is briefly evoked, the picture never establishes any real atmosphere or feeling for the dolce vita period in which the main characters moved. Viewers hear about it, and see some of its personalities, but it's almost as if the whole Belle Epoque is taking place offscreen.
At least Hampton's tight screenplay wastes no time getting down to business. While visiting a retired colleague, Charlotte Peloux (Bates), for some barbed gossiping, also-retired courtesan Lea (Pfeiffer) meets Charlotte's pleasure-loving, 19-year-old son, nicknamed "Cheri" (Rupert Friend). Before you can say "fornication," the two are doing just that, and next thing, they've been together for six years.
But by now, the scheming Charlotte has arranged for Cheri to marry the virginal Edmee (Felicity Jones), 18-year-old daughter of ex-courtesan Marie-Laure (Iben Hjejle). Miffed, but putting on a brave face, Lea heads south to Biarritz for some sun and young male flesh, but it's only a matter of time before she and Cheri hook up again in Paris to resolve their feelings.
Bates is the only cast member to inject a sense of real bitchiness and vivacity into the dialogue, with her handling of lines to Lea like, "Don't you find that when the skin is a little less firm, it holds perfume so much better?" an ongoing pleasure. As Hampton's adaptation leaves out the reversed role playing between the strong Lea and almost feminine Cheri, the movie has the bloodless feel of having been sanitized for general consumption.
What's left is hardly Colette and hardly a sophisticated drawing-room/bedroom dramedy, either, though it tries very hard and manages to surf easily enough through a tight 92 minutes on looks alone.
Still impossibly beautiful as she approaches 50 -- too much, in fact, for the role -- Pfeiffer has elegance to spare. However, she's not quite up to the nuances of Hampton's dialogue or the inner feelings of a retired courtesan awakened by a spoiled, moody boy. (It's a role that may have been better attempted by Jessica Lange, one of the exec producers.)
Friend, so good as the Germanic Prince Albert in "The Young Victoria," cuts a suitably louche figure as Cheri. But his character lacks enough backgrounding and sufficient onscreen chemistry with Pfeiffer for the romance to drive the picture.
Other roles are mostly bits, with Jones getting only a few scenes to sketch the girlish Edmee, and reliable thesps like Frances Tomelty, Iben Hjejle (Frears' "High Fidelity") and Harriet Walter (the aunt in "Young Victoria") even less time onscreen.

'For the first time in my life, I felt morally certain of having written a novel for which I need neither blush nor doubt," Colette said of Chéri , her 1920 novel of the Belle Époque Parisian demimonde. Stephen Frears 's anemic adaptation, written by Christopher Hampton  (who also folds in 1926's The Last of Chéri ), would most likely make the author nod off or plug her ears. Chéri, the most celebrated of Colette's male characters, is a louche 19-year-old millionaire played by Rupert Friend , acting opposite Michelle Pfeiffer  as Lea, a courtesan d'un certain âge  who has a six-year affair with the insolent androgyne until he's married off. Frears and Hampton's missteps begin immediately, with the director providing pinched narration as he recounts, over so many cartes de visite , the histories of other famous ladies who made a handsome living on their backs. It's the first of innumerable auditory assaults, continuing with Alexandre Desplat 's frantic score and the clash of English and American accents (especially puzzling in the scenes with Brit Friend  and Kathy Bates  as his retired-prostie mother). Pfeiffer, uncertain how to convey the older, wiser erotomane, resorts to sounding like Samantha Jones  auditioning for Masterpiece Theater , her décolletage the only part of this movie getting any air.
