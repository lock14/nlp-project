Chris Rock's comedy "I Think I Love My Wife" is based on Eric Rohmer's 1972 study of fidelity, "Chloe in the Afternoon," the last and least of the French director's six moral tales. It's an inspired stretch for the comedian; if only the movie were as stinging as his stand-up. "Wife" is more alert than the first film Rock directed, the mild political satire "Head of State," but its failure is fascinating, almost willful.
Rock, who wrote the film with Louis C.K. , plays Richard Cooper, a Manhattan investment banker and father of two who's bored with his suburban life. The sex is gone from his marriage to a schoolteacher named Brenda (Gina Torres ), and his primary outlet for that frustration is sexual fantasy. In his narration, he rhapsodizes about the beauties he sees on the commuter train, in the park, and on the streets. He dreams of being single and all the lewd ways he could tell a strange woman he'd like to have sex.
He wants to cheat, but presumably the opportunity hasn't fully presented itself. Then suddenly it does, in the body and spirit of Nikki Tru , whom Kerry Washington plays as a mysterious aperitif of fun, danger, ditsy elegance, and desperation. The character has no real human traits. She's a figment turned nuisance. But Washington gives her a degree of depth that I wish a filmmaker would really do something with. The actress is capable of so much more than looking scrumptious.
Nikki shares a first name -- and more -- with the temptress of a certain vulgar Prince classic. Bodaciously attired (her sleeveless red dress with the empire waist is a stunner) and frequently paired with a cigarette, Nikki would seem to be the ideal opportunity for Richard to alleviate his frustration. Yet, he doesn't. Instead, they just hang out.
Recently back in New York, Nikki is the long-ago ex of an old friend, and her life appears to be a mess. Her every inexplicable visit to Richard's office brings skepticism from his co-workers (including a sleazy Steve Buscemi), and new requests for favors. Richard, can you write me a job recommendation? Can you help me look for an apartment? Can you help pack up my old place? (This requires a last-minute trip to D.C.)
The idea seems to be that Nikki is a blessing and a curse. One minute she's getting Richard to trade iPods with her (she loves the Foo Fighters). The next, she's getting him beat up by her current ex (Michael K. Williams , Omar Little from the most recent season of "The Wire"), and nearly fired from work. She's a nut.
Brenda the wife, meanwhile, is left to wonder what's gotten into her husband. He's using the N-word around the kids and playing air guitar in the living room. Suddenly, it's like Rock is redoing the Kevin Spacey part in "American Beauty."
But the film isn't about the angst of middle age or the stress of a marriage on the fritz, not really. Nor is it a remake of Rohmer's marital delicacy so much as a correction.
 Men don't choose not to have sex with women, Rock's movie says. Women chose not to have sex with men, and this makes men crazy. Rohmer was fairer to the wife in his movie. Torres is good in Rock's, but the part requires her to be prim enough to make Richard feel naughty in the presence of Washington's freak.
"I Think I Love My Wife" is actually a long version of Rock's great bit about old sex versus new: "New [sex]," for instance, "is illiterate!" The point of that joke is, love the one you're already with. Of course, to get to that in the movie we have to sit through one absurd Viagra sequence (Richard's unstoppable erection requires an ambulance) and a trippy song Rock and Torres lip-synch to each other.
Rock could be making movies as culturally sharp about love's vicissitudes as Woody Allen or Albert Brooks . Lord knows he has Allen's same knack for whimsy and Brooks's exasperated wit. Surely, there must be a dozen little urban satires, vivid social X-rays of black America, or painfully funny essays on the nature of all things extramarital lurking in this man. Despite the trappings, "I Think I Love My Wife" isn't one of them.
The movie, instead, is a work of giddy self-sabotage that seems determined to matter and not matter at the same time. For every perceptive observation about marriage (one dinner sequence about the sad social fate of married buppies is outstanding), there are two knowingly atrocious ones that feel like scenes from C.K. and Rock's cult-classic blaxploitation gag, "Pootie Tang ." It's Rock's prerogative to goof off, but he's too smart to just throw scenes at the camera. Richard thinks he loves his wife. Rock appears to think he loves filmmaking. How many more of these indifferent exercises until he knows for sure?



         MOVIE REVIEWS 'My Wife' is Chris Rock's most mature effort, and the most dated.Women don't come off terribly well in "I Think I Love My Wife," writer-director Chris Rock's comedic "update" of the 1972 Eric Rohmer drama, "Chloe in the Afternoon." It's not so much misogynistic as it resembles a fossil from another era.
 
 As buttoned-down investment banker Richard Cooper, suffering from an acute case of the seven-year itch, Rock finds himself caught between his perfect if sexless wife, Brenda (Gina Torres), and an amoral temptress named Nikki (Kerry Washington). It's the old madonna/whore dichotomy.
 


         






   The whole scenario feels dated, and not simply because it's a remake of a 35-year-old French movie. Richard's antecedents go back even further. Like the protagonist of Irwin Shaw's 1930s short story "The Girls in Their Summer Dresses," he appreciates the lovely ladies of Manhattan. His daily train ride into the city gives him ample opportunity to ogle and daydream, making him an easy target for the likes of the seductive Nikki, a long-ago crush whom Richard hasn't seen since before he was married.
 
 The usually ranting Rock ratchets his barbs down a notch, limiting his diatribes to voice-overs, to play Richard, who seemingly has everything: Beautiful wife. Check. Adorable kids. Check. Well-appointed home in Westchester County. Check. But he's bored out of his freaking mind. Only this still being a Chris Rock movie, he doesn't say "freaking."
 
 Nikki  immediately turns Richard's world upside down by dragging him out of the office at inopportune times to help her sort out the mess that is her life. She's one distressing (and calculating) damsel.
 
 But compared with Brenda, Nikki is a breath of fresh air. Brenda is a schoolteacher who keeps the Cooper household running efficiently while Richard dutifully brings home the bacon, but their marriage has gone stale.
 
 Nikki, on the other hand, is fun. She tosses dollar bills out of Richard's office window to watch passersby fight over them. She takes Richard to the car show and pushes him toward the Porsches (Brenda parks him in a minivan). More dangerously, Nikki oozes sex, teasing Richard to the brink of losing his job and arousing Brenda's suspicions. As he points out to Nikki, he's getting all the aggravation of an affair with none of the pleasure.
 
 Even his commute and office are the stuff of 1950s and '60s novels and romantic comedies. The character played by Steve Buscemi, a colleague of Richard's who has mastered guilt-free philandering, would have been played by Tony Randall four or five decades ago. The depiction of women seems especially antiquated. Aside from Nikki and Brenda, the only other females in the film are the objects of Richard's fantasies, his disapproving secretary and some flirty salesgirls at Saks.
 
 Despite the creakiness of the vehicle, there are some genuinely funny moments and observations. The repressed nature of Richard's character allows Rock and frequent collaborator and co-scripter Louis C.K. to deploy the comic's F-bombs more judiciously. It's also Rock's most mature effort as a screenwriter, leaving behind broader comedy for something more introspective. Now, if he can only capture the sharply personal nature of his TV series "Everybody Hates Chris," he'll be on to something.
 
 
 "I Think I Love My Wife." MPAA rating: R for pervasive language and some sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes. In general release.   

I Think I Love My Wife  has got to be the unlikeliest French New Wave classic ever to be retrofitted by a famous African-American stand-up comedian best known for his stinging social commentary  at least until Dave Chappelle remakes Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless  as a hip-hop caper. As generations have before him, Chris Rock responded deeply to the pleasurable intelligence of Chloe in the Afternoon , one of the six self-described ''moral tales'' made by the great French master Eric Rohmer  a mature 1972 study of a man, faithful to the wife he loves, whose fidelity is challenged by the reappearance of a sexy, available woman from his past. But as few auteurists might have done, Rock  director as well as co-writer and uneasy hero of his own movie  has taken Rohmer's marvelously probing, psychologically refined, exquisitely yakky, and deeply French movie and turned it into a coarse-talking, race-conscious, tonally challenged life-crisis comedy.
Now it's about Rock as a sex-starved daddy named Richard, a prosperous, suited-up banker. Each weekday morning, Richard kisses his beautiful wife and two adorable kids goodbye and departs his handsome suburban house for the commuter train into shining Manhattan, all the while ogling sexy strangers. ''She's like a painting,'' he informs us about one, ''a painting I'd like to mount.'' Richard's lovely, nurturing schoolteacher spouse, Brenda (Gina Torres, an elegant comedian), is perfect in every way but oneshe's  uninterested in sex. (''My face hurts'' is one of her sitcom excuses.) And eventually Richard, who wants sex with his wife but isn't inclined to seek it elsewhere, retreats into a kind of defeated fantasy life. As he puts it, in a running interior monologue that has somewhat less panache than that of the conflicted hero of the original, ''I'm bored out of my f---in' mind.'' So far, the guy's more Everybody Loves Raymond  than Masculin-Féminin .
Then one day the porno-provocatively named Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington from Ray , working every come-hither eyelash), former girlfriend of an old buddy, sashays into Richard's ultra-beige (indeed, ultra-white) corporate world, ostensibly seeking an employment letter of recommendation. Maybe she's auditioning for a road production  of Showgirls ? Nikki upsets all that beige in her skimpy, devil-red baby-doll dress, and Richard's eyes go yowza-wowza . (In truth, Rock looks kind of terrified.) You know Nikki's up to no good because she smokes, constantly, in forbidden  places like offices and restaurants. It's not long before he and Nikki are meeting on sunny city afternoons and doing  not what you think, since Rohmer's interest lies not in the Doing It, but in the moral vertigo of teetering on the precipice of Doing It. But the two are certainly doing something. As Richard's more battle-hardened colleague George (another perfectly pitched supporting turn by Steve Buscemi) puts it: ''She's  f---in' you  you just don't know it.'' (In a nice shout-out to The King of Comedy , Richard toils at the firm of Pupkin & Langford; in an even nicer shout-out to Rock's beloved hometown, the movie is shot all around NYC.)
The EW convention of F-bleeping makes discussion cumbersome, because so much of the script (co-written with fellow comic Louis C.K.) is filled with naked, raunchy talk of f---ing and its accoutrements  conversation perfectly tailored to Rock's stand-up world, but forced and distracting in a movie with such sophisticated aspirations. Actually, some of the movie's best bits are sharp observational moments perfect for a one-man act on HBO, especially when the star gravitates toward the subject of blackness in a white  American world, and even more specifically upper-middle-class blackness in an undisciplined, N-word-using African-American pop-oriented culture. But those aren't the bits that drive the essentially conservative movie comfortably toward its safe, morally inevitable conclusion.
Rock isn't yet a natural actor  he uses the same pursed facial expressions to convey lust, fear, guilt, and dismay at being served chicken by his wife one too many times. And in directing his second feature after the equally ragged but more relaxed political comedy Head of State , he can't yet translate his skills as a brilliant comedian into equally sharp focus; his cinematic skills are only mild. Given his good taste in French art, he might be better off teaming up, Dave Chappelle's Block Party -style, with a stronger visual interpreter like Michel Gondry. I think I'd love that.

 In “I Think I Love My Wife” Chris Rock, who also directed and wrote the script (with his frequent collaborator Louis C. K.), plays Richard Cooper, an investment banker whose life is as bland as his name. Richard, in his voice-over narration, is the first to admit that his situation is enviable in many ways: He has a lovely wife named Brenda (Gina Torres), two cute small children, a spiffy house in the suburbs and a flourishing career at a reputable Manhattan firm.  The problem, as you may be able to intuit from this checklist of bourgeois amenities, is that he’s bored. He has reached a point at which existence settles into a series of pleasant routines and minor frustrations. In Richard’s case one of these frustrations —  the sexual cooling of his marriage —  becomes the source of some potentially major trouble.  “My marriage is frozen solid,” he declares. He means to say that it’s strong, but the metaphor sneaks up and traps him in an uncomfortable admission. To make matters worse, he delivers this diagnosis to Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington), a human blowtorch —  even without the cigarettes, she’d still be smoking —  aimed at the facade of Richard’s comfortable, complacent life.  Nikki, the ex-girlfriend of an old friend, shows up at Richard’s office one afternoon, supposedly seeking a letter of recommendation. By caprice or design she ensnares him in a long, volatile flirtation, a relationship that, while not technically adulterous, is nonetheless tinged with furtiveness and guilty exhilaration.  If the premise sounds familiar, that is in part because “I Think I Love My Wife” is a remake, at once free-handed and faithful, of “Chloe in the Afternoon” (1972), the sixth and last of Eric Rohmer’s “Moral Tales.” Mr. Rock’s affection for this source is evident in his careful restaging of some of its shots and scenes, even though Mr. Rohmer’s wry, ironical temperament could not be further from Mr. Rock’s candid, confrontational stand-up style.  In attempting to synthesize the later French New Wave of the late 1960s and early ’70s with the upscale African-American romantic comedies that flourished in Hollywood in the late 1990s, Mr. Rock has not only done his best work as a director and screenwriter but has also made an unusually insightful and funny mainstream American movie about the predicaments of modern marriage.  There are some raucous set pieces and a lot of frank, jokey talk about sex, but “I Think I Love My Wife” is not after crude or easy hilarity, and Mr. Rock works hard to hold his aggressive, irrepressible comic personality in check. Though he has made great strides as a filmmaker —  his previous effort, “Head of State,” was a better idea for a movie than an actual movie —  he is still, unfortunately, not much of an actor.  He is able, just barely, to impersonate a buttoned-up suburban professional, looking perfectly respectable in his suits but never quite conveying the inner life of the man inside them. Mr. Rock has a bit of a Woody Allen problem, in that any character he plays will always seem to be a transparent alter ego, and in the case of Richard Cooper this causes blurriness and confusion. Is this guy supposed to be Chris Rock or not? And if not, who is he supposed to be?  Richard’s everyman qualities, in other words, clash with Mr. Rock’s irreverent individuality. But the movie still works, in part because the observational sharpness that characterizes this comedian’s best performance work is sprinkled through the script. Without making race into a Big Theme, Mr. Rock and Louis C. K. nonetheless pepper the film with sharp insights into the black middle class, taking note of how the consciousness of race remains lodged in the fine grain of daily life. In front of her young daughter Brenda insists on spelling the words “white” and “black” instead of saying them, and Nikki, examining Richard’s iPod, offers a piquant diagnosis of his monochromatic musical tastes.  The key to the movie, in many ways, is Ms. Washington, whose flighty, needy, unpredictable character might have been better suited to Paris in 1972 than to present-day Manhattan. Nikki is a bit of a male fantasy, a dangerous temptress whose motives and feelings are as mysterious as they are intense, and whose attention is like oxygen to the sputtering vanity of a successful, sexually unfulfilled man.  Luckily, Ms. Washington is as quick-witted and subtle as she is lovely, and she makes Nikki not just seductive but interesting, a quality that is crucial to the story’s credibility. (Steve Buscemi, as Richard’s wise, philandering colleague, similarly rounds out what might have been a flat, obvious role.)  In short, “I Think I Love My Wife” is  smart and likable, which is lavish praise in a season whose comic offerings have included “Music and Lyrics” and “Because I Said So.” The success of this movie also suggests, refreshingly enough, that not every Hollywood remake of a French movie is necessarily a crime against taste. I look forward to seeing the boxed set of Chris Rock’s “Moral Tales” on my shelf, in alphabetical order right between Richard Pryor and Eric Rohmer.  “I Think I Love My Wife” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some very frank and grown-up discussions of sex, though not much explicit depiction of it.

Anyone expecting the wild-and-crazy, stage-prowling Chris Rock will be disappointed by the comic's latest cinematic foray as writer-producer-helmer-star, which hews toward more dramatic territory with only intermittent moments of levity. The main drawback is that under director Rock, actor Rock doesn't possess quite the chops to pull off this character, and the humor and flights of fancy are simply too low-key for a movie that lists "Irresistible Fantasy Woman No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3" in its credits. Beyond Rock's most fervent loyalists, box office should be modest, though liaisons with DVD and other platforms could be steamier.
Writing with fellow comic Louis C.K., whose stand-up act also zeroes in on the vagaries of marriage, Rock has rather ambitiously chosen to take a stab at reworking the 1972 Eric Rohmer film "Chloe in the Afternoon," though any number of middle-aged male fantasies -- from "10" to "The Woman in Red" -- could have provided the template.
Rock plays Richard Cooper, a successful employee in a New York investment firm who, per extensive voiceover narration, is in the throes of an outwardly idyllic but sexually dormant relationship with wife Brenda (Gina Torres), the mother of his two adorable kids. He's outwardly happily but flatly bored -- experiencing the equivalent of an eight-year itch, which leaves him prone to fantasizing about women he passes on the streets or the subway.
Along comes Nikki (Kerry Washington), the ex-girlfriend of one of Richard's old pals, who arrives seeking a favor and injects an element of excitement into his life -- though her repeated visits to his office not only set tongues wagging but also begin to negatively affect his work. Undeniably attracted to her, Richard is quick to say nothing's happening between them, although he slowly begins to realize this amounts to the worst of both worlds -- all of the guilt, with none of the adulterous fun.
None of this is lost on Richard's co-worker George (an underused Steve Buscemi, brightening things up whenever he's onscreen), a sort of reverse "Guide for the Married Man," who counsels Richard that, unlike many husbands, he's not the type that can stray without pangs of conscience.
Rock previously directed "Head of State," but the tone here remains mostly flat, even with narration that brings to mind his rightfully lauded CW series, "Everybody Hates Chris." By failing to maximize Richard's central predicament, the most intriguing elements are all peripheral, such as Richard and Brenda's banter about using the "N word" or bitching about W-H-I-T-E-S in front of the kids, and other issues pertaining to the rising black middle class.
Ultimately, the entire movie boils down ("builds" is giving it a bit too much credit) to whether Richard will succumb to temptation, killing time until then with scenes that are alternately amusing, improbable or strained -- the most absurd coming when he bribes a restaurant maitre d' to have a distractingly pretty waitress stationed elsewhere.
The one breakthrough involves Washington, who, after a variety of roles that recently included "The Last King of Scotland," is unleashed as a full-blown seductress and should see her cachet rise dramatically on the lad-mag circuit. Yet as written, Nikki's motivations remain so vague as to keep her, perhaps inevitably, more a symbol than a character.
The qualified title, meanwhile, wryly addresses the schizophrenia that plagues Richard throughout the story but culminates in a payoff that, given all that precedes it, rings a trifle hollow. And when Nikki teasingly tells Richard he's "not in love, you're in loyal," she'll no doubt speak for many Rock fans who, seeing the comic far from his "A" game, will do so less out of love than loyalty.

From the makers of Pootie Tang , one the greatest movies ever made, comes I Think I Love My Wife , the most unlikely remake in the history of cinema. Director, co-writer, and star Chris Rock  claims his comedy is an update of Chloe in the Afternoon , the concluding opus in Eric Rohmer 's famous suite of "Moral Tales." None of the froggy nuance and mise-en-scéne nonsense here; Rock appears to have been inspired by the opportunity Chloe affords for unloading bitter chauvinism and venting hostility. The moral of this tale is that when women aren't sexless, boring, and safe (i.e., wives), they're horny, fun, and frightening. Rock plays Richard, an über-buppie investment banker whose mellow Westchester  domesticity is upended by the arrival of Nikki (Kerry Washington ), a flirtatious fox from his past. Co-written by Pootie director Louis C.K. , the plot wonders if Dick can resist while offering just a touch of that old crazed, incongruous, sah-dah-tay  je ne sais quoi (notably in an elevator meltdown scene that rivals the bare-assed squirm from Borat). Rock capably directs a screenplay graced with one or two chuckles ("You stare at a soccer mom too long and they'll post your name on the Internet") and soured by a whole lot of misogyny.
