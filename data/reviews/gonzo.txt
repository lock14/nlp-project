It would hardly be surprising if the most brazen and incisive words ever spoken by Hunter S. Thompson in a life full of brazenness and incisiveness turned out to be about himself. After all, Thompson was his own greatest subject and muse, the refracting lens through which Las Vegas and the 1972 presidential campaign and the Kentucky Derby gained their meaning, and the means by which he turned American journalism on its ear. Looking at the larger-than-life character he had become by the mid-Seventies � the mad, solipsistic Rolling Stone
 reporter stalking the high, the mighty, and the square, armed to the teeth with guns, drugs, booze, a cigarette holder, and a typewriter; the self-proclaimed and self-invented �Gonzo journalist� � Thompson tells an interviewer: �I�m really in the way as a person. The myth has taken over. It would be much better if I died. Then people could take the myth and make films.� And though films celebrating the Thompson myth were made while the man was still alive � notably 1980�s Where the Buffalo Roam
 and Terry Gilliam�s phantasmagoric Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
 � Gonzo
 is the first since the writer elevated that myth to legend by committing suicide in 2005. It�s also the first to try to put his enormous, egocentric, violent, patriotic, insatiable, schizophrenic life into some sort of context. To do so, Gonzo
 director Gibney frees himself from the heady topicality of his recent documentaries such as Oscar-winner Taxi to the Dark Side
 and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room
 and dives right down into the deep � and dark � end. Using historical footage, the writer�s own words (read by Johnny Depp), even the occasional (and approximating-drug-addled) CGI effect, he aims to capture the contradictions and fervent outsider energy that fueled Thompson�s long career, from his first-person account of riding with the Hell�s Angels to the street rebellion outside the Chicago Democratic National Convention in 1968 (where Thompson watched the �American dream get clubbed to death�) and his travels with George McGovern during the carnivalesque 1972 presidential campaign, the assignment that took Thompson the rabble-rouser and defiler of objectivity, sobriety, and all other things journalistically holy from mere mortal to self-indulgent deity, a conversion that would eventually doom him, first as a writer then as a human being. And though Gibney and his brilliantly motley cast of interviewees � including former President Jimmy Carter, fellow rebel journalist Tom Wolfe, and, best of all, conservative icon (and loyal soldier of Thompson�s mortal enemy, Richard Nixon) Pat Buchanan � do their best to humanize a man known as a �walking monument to misbehavior,� there�s a nagging sense throughout Gonzo
 that, despite his late-life decline into caricature, Thompson was too complex, too self-mythologized, too big, too American to ever fit onscreen � especially in a movie aiming for �objectivity,� which was, for Thompson, the worst of all possible words.


The title of Alex Gibney's latest documentary, "Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson," neatly sums up its subject. It's an overview of Thompson's pioneering journalism and changing states of mind, serviceably presented as a fond, somewhat nostalgic glance in the rearview mirror of recent American history, clumsily connecting the travesties of the Nixon era to the travesties of the current one. Thompson - his brilliance, his self-destruction, and the ground he broke - is always at the center, but the film occasionally loses its focus.
As you might expect for a movie produced by the Vanity Fair editor and general éminence grise Graydon Carter, "Gonzo" is an all-access affair. Not only has Gibney rounded up tons of footage of Thompson (there's some choice stuff, for example, from an appearance on TV's "To Tell the Truth"), he has gained access to an impressive gallery of Thompson insiders: Jimmy Buffett, Tom Wolfe, Pat Buchanan, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Jann Wenner, Thompson's ex-wife Sondi Wright, his widow, Anita, and his son, Juan. They, and Johnny Depp's narration (intoning from Thompson's writings, at one point clutching a six-shooter while he reads), are all put to illustrative use, helping separate the complex explorer they knew from the weirdo persona he eventually cultivated.
The past is the movie's strong suit. Thompson rode the wave of '60s indulgence (drugs and rock 'n' roll during the height of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury period) that crashed in 1970s disillusionment. His violent, name-making time with the Hell's Angels in the mid-1960s eventually leads to his classic at-large work for Rolling Stone, where he chronicled a kind of American nightmare. A raw truth emerged from the reporting he did from the melees of the 1968 Democratic convention through the 1972 presidential election to his discovery of Jimmy Carter in 1974. And Gibney's movie delves into the entertaining paradoxes of Thompson's groundbreaking style. He merged reportage and a kind of louche fabulism to the point where his pieces resembled a funhouse-mirror version of reality: The truth was warped, but you could still make it out. To that end, his field adventures met their psychic X-ray and visual soul mate in Ralph Steadman's psychotic illustrations.
In capturing the social and moral cauldron the country had become, Thompson became a kind of disgusted activist, forgoing the journalist's credo of objectivity to show his readers what he thought was really going on. He embraced George McGovern during the '72 Democratic presidential primaries (he was covering the campaign) and enthusiastically trashed '68 nominee Hubert Humphrey and Ed Muskie, two of McGovern's rivals for the nomination in '72.
Somehow "Gonzo" never makes any great headway into Thompson's psyche. It may not be possible, the essence of who he was having been altered by decades of drugs and alcohol. The movie is always fascinating when it deepens into an examination of the era in which Thompson was working and how his attitude toward his profession really affected politics. Gary Hart, who was McGovern's campaign manager, discusses how Thompson's embellishments and dramatizations trivialized the tough work of running a campaign. And someone else mentions, in a similar vein, how Thompson's unorthodox - OK, unprofessional - comportment on the trail rankled the serious journalists in the press pool. Listening to them, I was struck by the fact that people say the same about bloggers today.
Gibney won an Oscar earlier this year for his superb military-torture documentary "Taxi to the Dark Side"; and in a move that might have amused Thompson, he's suing that movie's distributor for doing a bad job just in time for the release of his new movie. The current wars are an evident source of moral frustration and creative inspiration for him. But where Gibney's outrage in "Taxi" had the terrible, exhilarating chill of a well-told ghost story, events in "Gonzo" are disorganized in a way that leaves us with only a vague sense of the trajectory of Thompson's professional decline.
It's worth noting that the film's gravest shortcoming is its soundtrack. Gibney loads the film with hits from the 1960s and 1970s in the least imaginative, most hand-holding manner, the way Nora Ephron often does with standards in her movies. The documentary doubles as a jukebox of banality. Thompson discusses his funeral preferences: "Spirit in the Sky." McGovern gets the nomination in '72: "You Sexy Thing." His soon-to-be-ex running mate, Thomas Eagleton, admits to having had shock therapy: "Going Out of My Head." These songs bring Gibney's film closer to "Sleepless in Seattle" than any film about Hunter S. Thompson ought to be.


Gonzo , the documentary by Alex Gibney, taps the full fascination of its subject: Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, the rock & roll Norman Mailer who styled himself as the last honest man in the American asylum, only to be destroyed by his legend. Gibney devotes exhaustive sections to Thompson's journalistic landmarks (Hell's Angels , etc.), as well as to his 1969 candidacy for mayor of Aspen  the moment his robo-voiced ''Gonzo'' persona inflated into a comic-book alter ego. The movie also captures Thompson's tragedy: the haze of drugs and bad writing that consumed him for no less than his last 30 years.

 Even if Alex Gibney’s new documentary, “Gonzo,” were not subtitled “The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson,” there would be little doubt about its subject. Thompson, who committed suicide in 2005, survives to some degree in the popular imagination because of his self-burnished reputation for wild excess. Embodied on the screen by Bill Murray (in Art Linson ‘s underrated “Where the Buffalo Roam” from 1980) and Johnny Depp (in Terry Gilliam’s overblown “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” from 1998) and travestied as the conspiratorial Uncle Duke in Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” comic strip, Thompson remains a durable icon of countercultural bad craziness.  Gonzo,  Thompson’s symbol for which was a two-thumbed fist clutching a peyote button, denotes a drug-fueled, madcap libertarianism, a pursuit of freedom to the very edge of good sense and beyond. But as  Thompson first used the word, gonzo was an aurally suggestive, semantically vague adjective, and the noun it modified was, above all, journalist. And it is to Mr. Gibney’s great credit that while he pays due attention to the outsize, cartoonish celebrity persona  Thompson fell back on when his literary powers began to wane,  this  film concentrates on the bold, innovative journalism that secured Thompson’s reputation and assures his immortality.  A gangly, diffident Kentuckian with good manners and a mail-order divinity degree (hence the mock-honorific “Doctor”),  Thompson had the good fortune to be around during a heroic and lawless age of American magazine writing, when visionary editors were willing to publish (and cover expenses for) all kinds of adventures and experiments. It was Carey McWilliams of The Nation who first printed Thompson’s chronicle of riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, an article — and, in 1966, a book — that sketched out part of the emerging mythology of the  ’60s, and also  foreshadowed some of the era’s dissonances and contradictions.  “Hell’s Angels” made  Thompson something of a media star — Mr. Gibney includes clips from one of the first of what would be many appearances as a television talk-show guest — and introduced readers to the basic elements of his style and method. Those found fertile soil in the pages of Rolling Stone, whose founder and publisher, Jann Wenner, is among the witnesses gathered by Mr. Gibney to dish, critique and pay tribute.  Others include  Thompson’s two wives, Sandy and Anita; his son, Juan; and Ralph Steadman, the British artist whose drawings are nearly as integral to the Thompson oeuvre as the author’s own jazzy, swaybacked prose. The peanut gallery is filled out by some surprisingly establishmentarian figures, including Patrick J. Buchanan and George McGovern, who served the master of gonzo as sources and subjects when he turned his attention to politics.  As it was for many others, the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago was a watershed for  Thompson, who was appalled by the ferocity of Mayor  Richard J. Daley’s police force. Thompson’s  temperamental suspicion of authority took on a political dimension, which expressed itself through a characteristic mixture of earnestness and clowning. As a candidate for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colo., in 1970, he raised the banner of “freak power” and also raised serious issues about land use and law enforcement. And his reporting on the 1972 presidential election — published in “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,” his masterpiece — was a brazen mixture of passionate partisanship, scabrous insight and pure invention.  It was “the least factual, most accurate account” of the election, according to Frank Mankiewicz, Mr. McGovern’s campaign manager. Making no pretense of neutrality,  Thompson broadcast his admiration for Mr. McGovern and his contempt for  Mr. McGovern’s Democratic rivals. He also expressed one of the great, sustaining passions of his writing  life, namely his unquenchable hatred for Richard M. Nixon.  Mr. Gibney, whose other films include “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” and the Oscar-winning “Taxi to the Dark Side,” assembles a lively collage of interviews and found materials. Mr. Depp reads choice excerpts from  Thompson’s work, and the writer in his prime is glimpsed in scenes from earlier documentaries. “Gonzo” is  a fascinating history lesson and a bit of a cautionary tale — about the corrosive effects of rampant drug use, yes, but more about how fame can turn into the scourge of talent.  Thompson’s creatively fallow years outnumbered his fertile ones, which can leave you feeling a bit deflated after two hours. But at his best he was braver, funnier and more ruthlessly honest than just about any other magazine writer, and “Gonzo” confirms his place in the great American parade of cranks, renegades and sages — that is, in the best, most disreputable corner of our literary pantheon.    “Gonzo” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for drug and sexual content, language and some nudity. .

So larger-than-life that he eventually felt overshadowed by his own mythos, legendary journo Hunter S. Thompson gets definitive docu treatment in "Gonzo." Alex Gibney's film draws on a rich array of archival interviews, homemovies, signs-of-the-times clips and celebrity reminiscences to chart the dizzying arc of a man who both chronicled and personified edgier aspects of the American 1960s and '70s. Subject's lingering appeal to both old fans and new should make this a viable specialty release in all formats, starting with Magnolia's theatrical release.
Fast-paced, colorful assembly starts with commentators remarking on Thompson's legacy (even foe Sonny Barger of Hell's Angels grudgingly calls him "a jerk, but a very good writer") and lamenting the long creative decline after his peak years. Pic then backtracks to touch on his Kentucky upbringing before an appearance in full biker drag on gameshow "To Tell the Truth" heralded his first professional triumph: "Hell's Angels," an exercise in participatory journalism that resulted from his hanging out with the famed outlaws for a year -- though ultimately, they were not pleased with his portrait.
The book's success made him a minor celebrity, but the ambitious author hungered for greater fame. Aligning himself with Rolling Stone magazine, he chronicled his own Freak Power Party run for sheriff in Aspen, Colo. (he lost, to residents' enormous relief), then did a piece about the "decadent and depraved" Kentucky Derby that's pinpointed here as the birth of "gonzo" journalism -- the chemically fueled, sometimes fictionalized, highly first-person style that made Thompson a counterculture hero. His classic "Fear and Loathing" tomes confounded all traditional rules of reporting, yet remain admired for grasping the gist of American politics and life better than many sober, evenhanded treatments.
Even as his fame skyrocketed, Thompson grew disillusioned and unreliable. Deeply patriotic, he was appalled by the Nixon administration, depressed by McGovern's failed White House bid, briefly enthused by Carter. (Both of the latter are gracious interviewees here.) Titanic consumption of drugs and alcohol, paranoia, a habit of shooting firearms (often under the influence), and omnipresent groupies and hangers-on all made his productivity increasingly erratic. Tired and alarmed by this circus-y lifestyle, first wife Sondi Wright finally left, taking their son with her.
Thompson's last quarter-century, ending with a planned 2005 suicide at age 67, are skimmed past here. The excesses expected of him became more defining than the writing itself (though his musings on 9/11 were strikingly, eerily prescient). But the giddy extravagance of his memorials -- remains cannon-shot into space, a huge sculpture erected on his Colorado property -- end docu on an upbeat note.
Subject's career being inextricably tied to two extremely entertaining U.S. decades, "Gonzo" has a wealth of delightful archival footage to draw on, both directly involving Thompson and evoking the cultural landscape around him. Gibney ("Taxi to the Dark Side," "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room") deploys a lively range of techniques, from onscreen text to split-screen, in ace production package. Soundtrack choices (Stones, Dylan, "American Pie," etc.) tend to be a bit obvious, though mid-'70s disco hitmakers Hot Chocolate are felicitously utilized at one point.
Running a wide gamut from relatives to close collaborators (Ralph Steadman, Jann Wenner) to historied politicos, the interviewees offer first-rate insight. Pal Johnny Depp reads excerpts from Thompson's works and is also glimpsed in several excerpts from Terry Gilliam's film of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." Mercifully, there's just one scene from 1980 dud "Where the Buffalo Roam," which starred Bill Murray as the man himself.

"In a nation of frightened dullards, there is always a sorry shortage of outlaws, and those few who make the grade are always welcome." So wrote Hunter S. Thompson  of the Hells Angels  after riding with California's motor-psycho Mongol hordes in the mid-1960s, a feat of embedded journalism that left him mauled, marked, and famous. But the sentence's true subject—as with so much of what Thompson wrote in the years after his nervy, electric Angels book—is its author.
Alex Gibney 's Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson  makes the familiar case that Thompson's notoriety eventually capsized his career, well before his long-foretold suicide in 2005. Over a quick scan of Thompson's personal effects (whiskey bottles; a note that cautions: "Never call 911!"), unseen jurors hand down the verdict: "He'd lost that gonzo edge . . . " But while the evidence of his spotty post-1970s work is hard to refute, Gonzo  proves what a vapid, overvalued commodity edginess is, championing Thompson's best work for brass-tacks insight more than brass-balled outrage.
"The edge . . . there is no honest way to explain it, because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over." Like the rest of the movie's narration, the words are Thompson's, read by Johnny Depp  in the voice he mastered for Terry Gilliam 's movie version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  : a clenched murmur through grinding teeth. Thompson's authorial voice had a hardboiled Beat-poet sprawl—Howl  by way of Hemingway—which became more pronounced over the years, especially once (like the drugs outside of Barstow ) the concept of "gonzo" began to take hold.
Gonzo! Coined to describe Thompson's anarchic means of toppling the inverted pyramid, the term even comes first in the movie's title. Yet, as friend and biographer Douglas Brinkley  tells the camera, the book that made Thompson's outlaw rep, Hell's Angels , was "not gonzo, just participatory." At the time, Thompson wasn't far removed from being the Fitzgerald acolyte who typed The Great Gatsby  to study its sentence flow. Nor was he far financially from the freelancer who hunted and gathered elk liver to feed his first wife.
That would all change for the better, at least for a few years. Buttressed by interviews and documentary footage that make the author a complex, looming presence, the bulk of Gibney's film is devoted to just three books: Hell's Angels , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , and his last major work, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 —a trilogy in which Thompson wrote the epitaph for '60s idealism in psychedelic hyperbole and lightning-strike invective. By ditching the drone of journalistic objectivity for a sharp new voice—strung-out, cynical, relentlessly self-aware—Thompson pioneered what might be called psychic-war correspondence.
Within the stylistic fireworks, Gibney locates the heart of the books: Las Vegas 's piercing elegy for the moment the Flower Power wave began to wash back; the Campaign Trail 's savage but sage assessments of George McGovern  and Thompson's bête noire, Tricky Dick. The director boldfaces Thompson's still-pertinent rationale for gonzo style as duty, not distraction: "It was the built-in blind spots of the objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon  to slither into the White House ." Remove Nixon from that sentence and fill in the blank.
But Gonzo  is just as clear-eyed about Thompson's limits and contradictions. A tightly wound bundle of everything and its opposite—an anti-authoritarian who ran for sheriff of Aspen, a peace-loving gun nut, an iconoclast who relished winners as much as any football coach—Thompson was capable of chiding the Washington press corps for "gross cynicism" about McGovern, then turning on the hapless candidate when blood was in the water. More illuminating than McGovern campaign manager Gary Hart 's acid assessment of Thompson's oddly romantic worldview—a black-and-white arena where politics is "all fun, all amusing, all good-and-evil over-dramatizing"—is Pat Buchanan 's fond remembrance.
Still, shooting in the snarky vein of his Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room  rather than the cold fury of his Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side , director Gibney relies too often on glib simplification. He offers up a vague anecdote about Thompson's early run-in with the Louisville  police as if it were some sort of defining Rosebud, while skimming the last 25 years of Thompson's life in about 20 minutes of screen time. But if these are misdemeanors, Gibney's music montages are felonies: smirky pairings of golden oldies and stock-footage upheaval—a Social Unrest Classic Rock Weekend. Does anyone really need a subliminal flash of George McGovern whenever they hear "You Sexy Thing"?
The brightest of Gibney's archival finds is an ancient episode of To Tell the Truth , on which "the real Hunter Thompson" is asked to stand up. For surreal hilarity, nothing in the movie rivals dowager panelists Peggy Cass  and Kitty Carlisle  grilling their hunched-over guest about Ken Kesey  and the Merry Pranksters . It's a clever way to convey Thompson's growing cult of personality, and the ultimate emptiness of the celebrity gathering around him. By refocusing attention on Thompson's blazing gift, however unevenly it burned, Gonzo  reclaims him from the fate he described for the Angels: "The mystique was stretched so thin it finally became transparent."
