         "Once the idea is gone, everything is gone," Fiona Anderson (Julie Christie) says to her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent) and two of their friends after reaching for a bottle of wine during dinner and instantly forgetting what it is, what it's for and what it's called.
 
 Fiona and Grant are a bookish, childless couple in their 60s living alone in a storybook cabin in Ontario, where they spend their days cross-country skiing and reading aloud to each other. The only perceptible blot on their idyllic existence is Fiona's progressive memory loss, which she tries to stave off with sticky notes stuck on kitchen cabinets and drawers to remind her what's in them — which Grant is convinced will only make her memory worse.
 


         






   Grant's inability to accept his wife's disease and Fiona's surprisingly serene resignation  are the initial catalysts for the unexpected story that unfolds in "Away From Her," the insightful and eloquent filmmaking debut of actress Sarah Polley, who wrote and directed the film from a short story by Alice Munro. Fiona has decided to check herself into an assisted living facility before becoming a burden or a danger to her husband, and Grant opposes the idea because he cannot imagine his life without her. At dinner with their friends Fiona tries to explain: "I'm plagued by the sense that I've forgotten something terribly important but can't remember what it is," she says, hinting at one of the film's most poignant observations about marriage and long-term love. "I just wander around half the time trying to figure out what was so important earlier."
 
 Fiona and Grant have been married 44 years, and it's surely not divulging too much to say they haven't all been easy. But Grant's reluctance to move his wife into the nursing home becomes even greater when he learns of the facility's policy not to allow visits or phone calls for the first 30 days. "Give them the month to settle in and they're happy as clams," the officious supervisor Madeleine (Wendy Crewson) tells him. Unconvinced, Grant befriends a sympathetic nurse, Kristy (Kristen Thomson), who promises him regular updates, but otherwise is left with no choice but to accept the policy and his wife's wishes.
 
 What takes place after the month has passed comes as a surprise, but as happens often in this film, which gracefully defies expectations throughout, it's not the initial surprise that gets to you but the effect it has on the characters in the long run, like winds that shape trees. The ephemeral nature of love, the ephemeral nature of memory — or are they more etched into us, more solid and physical than we think? — are explored as Grant makes new acquaintances and tries to come to terms with how his life has changed.
 
 Much has been made of Polley's age (28), especially in relation to her material, but well intentioned as this sort of comment has mostly been, I think it's unfair.
 
 What distinguishes "Away From Her" is that it takes an honest, clear-eyed view of a subject that is talked about constantly but about which little is actually said.
 
 "Away From Her" focuses on what love is like after the honeymoon stage, which Polley, who has been married for a few years, has said is the stage most interesting to her. What's remarkable to me is that more young people aren't making more films as  confident as this.
 
 "I think people are too demanding," Fiona says. "People want to be in love every single day. What a liability." To hear these wry but wise words from the mouth of Julie Christie, as astonishingly beautiful as ever but even more compelling, is to revel in the rare pleasure of a sly line, delivered by a woman whose experience has made her more interesting, not less. Pinsent gives a beautifully understated performance as a man who's still growing up, and Olympia Dukakis is memorable in a smaller role. Shot in Ontario by Luc Montpellier and edited by Polley's husband, David Wharnsby, "Away From Her" is poignant, wise and unafraid — just the sort of film for a young person, or any person, for that matter, to make.

Julie Christie is the mesmerizing star of Away From Her , a tremulous adaptation of acclaimed Canadian storyteller Alice Munro's much-tougher-minded short fiction about love and Alzheimer's, ''The Bear Came Over the Mountain.'' And as if to make it easier for us to drink in as much of the actress' startling, mature beauty as possible, adapter/director Sarah Polley keeps the camera tight and close on Christie's magnificently planed face: Polley counts on those famous blue eyes to tell the tale of Fiona, a woman taking leave of her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent, with fine blue peepers himself), and their long, complicated life together as her memory slips.
Munro's story is about hanging on and letting go, and about the mysteries of what binds men and women together. Polley, herself a thoughtful actress (The Sweet Hereafter ), retains the story's architecture  the nursing home Fiona enters, the romantic bond she makes with a fellow resident (Michael Murphy), and Grant's connection with Marian (Olympia Dukakis), the blunt-talking, pragmatic wife of Fiona's new friend. But the filmmaker, making her feature debut, can't resist a young person's eager doodling on her elder's spare handiwork. The story now jigs forward and back, the nursing-home scenes have been expanded and quiver with somber concern, and Marian is quite another kind of woman off the page  someone softer, and more movie-friendly. Munro's stark lily needed none of this gilding.

 In a refreshingly direct, unassuming manner, “Away From Her” considers two great human mysteries: the persistence of love and the workings of the brain. It takes the twilight of a long, mostly happy marriage as a vantage point from which to look back at youth and forward into the waiting darkness. The first feature written and directed by Sarah Polley, one of the most interesting actresses to come out of Canada in the past decade, the film is by turns sharp and somber, alive to the lacerations of ordinary experience and quietly attentive to grand absurdities and small instances of grace.  “A little bit of grace” is what Fiona, a slender and elegant woman with Alzheimer’s disease, counsels in response to its ravages. And grace is what Julie Christie, who plays Fiona, manifests in every scene, even as Fiona feels the tissue of her self begin to crumble and fade. When we first encounter Fiona and her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent), they are living  in a roomy old house on the shore of a lake in Ontario. Soft-spoken and gray-haired, they are a picture of marital ease and contentment: sexually fulfilled, easy in each other’s company, instinctively choosing kindness over recrimination.  When Fiona’s lapses of memory, initially comical —  she puts a frying pan in the freezer, and forgets the word “wine” —  start to become worrisome, it is she, partly out of consideration for Grant, who initiates the series of decisions that take her from the house by the lake to an assisted-living facility called Meadowlake.  Like “The Bear Came Over the Mountain,” the Alice Munro story on which it is based, “Away From Her” uses fractured chronology to convey the splintering of experience caused by Fiona’s loss of memory. The progress of Alzheimer’s —   “progress” is one of the medical euphemisms that Grant, a retired English professor, takes bitter note of  —  is cruelly and mercifully uneven. “I seem to be disappearing bit by bit,” says Fiona, and as she does, she begins to lose Grant as well.  Or, perhaps, to abandon him. In conversational allusions and flickering, grainy flashbacks, we discover a long-buried crack in their seemingly perfect relationship, a period many years before when Grant, tempted by his female students and the permissive mores of the time, had been unfaithful. Is Fiona’s sudden, strange attachment to a fellow Meadowlake patient named Aubrey (Michael Murphy) a manifestation of her disease, or a sly way of punishing Grant for his lapses 20 years before? When Grant comes bearing flowers, she does not really seem to know who he  is. She recognizes him from one day to the next but treats him with wary civility, as if he were a dogged, pathetic suitor —   “my, but you’re persistent,” she remarks  —  rather than her husband of more than 40 years.  Four decades ago, Julie Christie was one of the most beautiful women in movies, poised, a bit melancholy and heart-stoppingly sexy. Not much has changed. The sketches Aubrey draws of Fiona magically (or tactfully) erase the features of age —  they could have been drawn at the time of John Schlesinger’s “Darling” (1965)  —  but those features are superficial in any case.  Mr. Pinsent, a marvelously subtle actor with a rich voice and a shaggy charisma, looks at her with the eyes of a man who can’t believe his good fortune, even as his luck takes a bad turn. And Grant, like many of the men in Ms. Munro’s fiction, is a compound of attractive and appalling traits. He was clearly appealing enough for Fiona to fall in love with and decent enough not to leave her. But you can’t help seeing  the justice of an assessment made by Aubrey’s wife, Marian (Olympia Dukakis), with whom Grant strikes up a mutually convenient friendship. “What a jerk,” she says, closing the door after their first meeting.  But nobody’s perfect, and Ms. Polley’s triumph is to have preserved, and  enriched, the individuality that Ms. Munro breathes into her characters. The economy of the original story is both an advantage and a challenge. Everything a filmmaker needs is right there on the page, but Ms. Munro’s prose sets such a high standard of clarity and nuance that a filmmaker might be wiser to leave it alone. There are a few false notes in “Away From Her,” scenes in which the dialogue has a tinny, theme-declaring sound, a moment of facile political point-making. But over all, it is very fine, accurate in its insight and generous in its judgments.  There is, in Ms. Munro’s mature work, a flinty wisdom about heterosexual love, a skepticism about romantic ideals that does not altogether deny their power or necessity. Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her  20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.  Grant, at one point, muses that the passions of youth seem “superficial” when compared with the deeper, stranger emotions that blossom later in life, and “Away From Her” implicitly proves his point. I can’t remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.    “Away From Her” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and complicated, adult situations.
In the superbly tacit chamber piece Away From Her , intolerable pressure is brought to bear on the 44-year marriage between a college professor and his homemaker spouse after she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
Grant Andersson (played by veteran Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent ) and his wife Fiona (an artfully wrinkled and radiant Julie Christie ) have weathered a difficult but durable union in which much, wisely or not, has gone unsaid, and now they've settled into placid companionship in their Northern Ontario  house, reading and cross-country skiing together. They make a handsome, Nordic-looking, low-key couple against the snowy landscape: Grant with his white beard and steady, enigmatic, possibly smug gaze; Fiona with her elegant mane of perfectly coiffed silver hair. When Fiona starts putting frying pans in the freezer, not much is said, either. But after she starts wandering off and placing herself in danger, Fiona firmly and efficiently decideswith quietly anguished opposition from her husbandto enter a high-end nursing home whose gleaming surfaces and smooth-talking director (the excellent Wendy Crewson ) stand in creepy contrast to the comfortable disorder of the Anderssons' home. There, just as efficiently, Fiona seems to forget who Grant is and takes up with Aubrey (Michael Murphy ), a near-catatonic inmate she claims to have known in her youth. "He doesn't confuse me at all," she tells her bewildered spouse, whom she now treats as a slightly pesky guest. That lack of confusion, Grant will dimly grasp, says as much about the shortcomings of their marriage as it does about the loss of his wife's faculties. In Away From Her , short-term memory may be going, going, gone, but the distant past that floods in to take its place can be devastating and, in its way, sublime.
Away From Her , which is adapted from Alice Munro 's short story "The Bear Came Over the Mountain," is the first feature written and directed by the fiercely talented young Canadian actress, Sarah Polley . Far from being the look-at-me calling card so many first-time filmmakers feel obliged to turn out, it's a precociously assured and mature work, at once humble and bold, that keeps faith with Munro's precise, graceful prose while tailoring its linear progression into shapely cinematic form. Polley's quick, impressionistic flashbacks to the breathlessly hormonal early stages of Grant and Fiona's romance, to Grant's serial indiscretions (Munro has never been kind to the '60s, and Polley bears her out with a wicked bit of business involving sandals), and to the crisis that drove the couple out of the university and into a secluded country life, all mimic the elisions and eruptions of memoryand of marriage itself, with its betrayals, blunders, and periodic tumult smoothed out by time and diplomacy, only to surge back up when least expected.
A less-attuned writer might have betrayed Munrowho is as severe with her characters as she is sympathetic to their clueless thrashingsby turning Alzheimer's into a metaphor for life, complete with eleventh-hour uplift. Here, Fiona's illness, with its attendant confusion, loneliness, and fitful oblivion, is real and specific, funny, and utterly heartbreaking. With unobtrusive skill, Polley weaves the couple's suffering into a great love story that begins with Grant's terrified denial and endsperhapswith unconditional devotion. Munro has never been an enthusiast for earth-mother wisdom, but she is slyly fond of female practicality; helped along by two women who have his numbera friendly but brutally candid nurse (Kristen Thomson ) and Aubrey's pragmatic wife (Olympia Dukakis )Grant comes to understand that, one way or another, he has always been "away from her." And so he gives Fiona a gift that's either a ploy to bring her back, or proof of his arrival at a hard-won state of grace. Knowing Munro, it's probably both: At the end of this lovely movie, with a plaintive K.D. Lang  singing Neil Young 's "Helpless" on the soundtrack, there's a meeting between Grant and Fiona that may be a reward for his selflessness, a punishment for his sins, or another turn of the screw in a life without guarantees.
