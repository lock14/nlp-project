"The bitch is dead now." The line, from the endgame of Ian Fleming's very first James Bond novel, 1953's Casino Royale
, is all too prescient, presaging Her Majesty's most volatile agent's predilection for vaguely misogynistic one-nighters which more often than not ended up with the object of his affections either dead or doomed, as well as offering a filmy glimpse into the cracked soul of Bond, James Bond. That the line made it into this 21st Hollywood chapter of the saga is a testament to the devotion of screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with a reported assist from Paul Haggis) to the new spirit of post-9/11 Bondage. This is the origin story wherein we get to discover, along with incoming blond Bond Daniel Craig, where 007 got his Walther PPK, his love of fast cars and suave daredeviltry, vodka martinis (at one point a barman asks "Shaken or stirred?" To which Bond cattily replies: "Do I look like a man who cares?"), and highest-stakes cardsharpery. The good news is Craig, who was riveting as a London pharmaceutical salesman in the recent Brit import Layer Cake
, is equally mesmerizing here; you can see Sean Connery in his future, and it looks just about spot-on. Craig carries Casino Royale
 with gutsy aplomb, and if his Bond carries more than a hint of streetwise rough trade � evident in his first kill, which opens the film with less of a bang than a frantic, panicky, sweat-soaked tussle-to-the-death (in a men's room, no less) � it only adds to the film's edgy, grim demeanor. At 144 minutes, however, this is by far the longest Bond of them all, and when you factor in the crucial love story (yes, hard to believe, but love
 it surely is) with the drop-dead gorgeous, witty, equally street-savvy MI-5 bean counter Vesper Lynd (Green, nearly as incandescent here as she was outside the Cinematheque Francaise in Bertolucci's The Dreamers
), well, you're in for a long haul. Bond purists, and those who thought Roger Moore's flip incarnation the height of black-tie panache, will rankle at this film's extended � but necessary for future character development � backstory, which until now is not a phrase I'd have used to describe 007. Unlike the other Bonds, this one feels pain, lots of it, and bleeds a lot of blood, even going so far as to maim his craggy-handsome face and, at one brief point, die outright. Those who always hoped the series would morph into something approaching realism (if only cinematic), will find their wait justly rewarded. Craig, simply put, is
 Bond. His cooly menacing performance obliterates everything between Diamonds Are Forever
 and now, including Never Say Never Again
, thank goodness. Director Campbell helmed 1995's above-average GoldenEye
, so he's not specifically new to the franchise, but Casino Royale
 is unlike any other Bond film. In fact, the only other Bond film that feels less like one of Fleming's outings is the original Casino Royale
, an epic, ultra-mod, everything-and-Woody Allen catastrophe set in swinging Sixties London, featuring Orson Welles as the villainous Le Chiffre (here played, with much less style but far more believability, by Mikkelsen). That film must be seen to be believed. This one, on the other hand, need only be seen.


The new James Bond is quick and muscular, and there is nothing remotely camp about him. He doesn�t wink; in fact, I�m not sure he even blinks. Where other men might athletically sail through a narrow window opening during a chase scene, he prefers to plow through the wall. He�s a strapping brute � young, untested, rough around the edges � and he is magnificent. Let the purists squawk: In Daniel Craig, the Bond franchise has finally found a 007 whose cruel charisma rivals that of Sean Connery.
Based on the first of Ian Fleming�s novels, ��Casino Royale�� is an origin story, and it wants very much to be this year�s ��Batman Begins�� � a movie that resets the clock to zero and tells the tale with new and becoming leanness. We�re present at the start of things: Bond gets his first Aston Martin here, is fitted for his first tuxedo, briefly considers whether one�s martini should be shaken or stirred. (His response is priceless and in keeping with the movie�s no-nonsense tone).
Other ritual aspects of the 007 mythos are missing � there�s no Q with his lethal widgets, no Miss Moneypenny, no cat-stroking villain contemplating the vaporization of South America by satellite. Frankly, ��Casino Royale�� is better off without them. If you miss the old cliches, consider whether, after 21 Bond films and countless parodies, your response is simply Pavlovian.
After a brief, gritty black-and-white opening in which the young spy earns his two kills and ascends to double-0 status, ��Casino Royale�� sets Bond on the trail of a mysterious bombing network. (The film is set in the modern day, and while it�s topical, it�s smart enough to steer clear of politics.) A gasp-inducing action sequence sends the hero after a bomber through the streets and among the construction cranes of the capital city of Madagascar, ending in an international incident that proves how much this young man still has to learn.
��You need to take your ego out of the equation,�� scolds M (Judi Dench), the head of the MI6 British spy agency, to the man she calls a ��blunt instrument,�� and this film is the story of how James Bond gains gravitas � how he becomes, in essence, the man we know from the Fleming novels and early films like ��Dr. No�� and ��From x Russia with Love.��
So while there are ��Bond girls,�� and Craig�s 007 is appreciative of their bodaciousness, there�s too much on his plate to ogle and conquer. The Madagascar bomber�s cellphone leads to a middleman in the Bahamas, who leads to an epicene European financier named Le Chiffre (Danish leading man Mads Mikkelsen), who makes his fortune shorting airline stocks after terrorist attacks he helps engineer. Behind Le Chiffre is a shadowy universe of bigger players; for once, a Bond movie acknowledges that the real world contains people scarier and grayer than Dr. Evil-style madmen.
In an effort to bankrupt Le Chiffre and leave him at the mercy of his associates � nasty pieces of work like the machete-wielding Ugandan ��freedom fighter�� played by Isaach de Bankole � MI6 sends Bond and fellow agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green, of Bertolucci�s ��The Dreamers��) to Montenegro for a high-stakes, invitation-only gambling tournament. Bowing to current fashion (and wanting the audience to better follow the bluffing), the producers of ��Casino Royale�� have replaced the Baccarat of the original novel with Texas Hold �Em, familiar from a thousand cable shows.
The gambit works even as it instantly dates the film; the inclusion of a pretty dire rock anthem by Soundgarden/Audioslave leader Chris Cornell over the opening credits is another misstep. The director is Martin Campbell, who made the 1995 Bond film ��Golden8Eye,�� the two recent ��Zorro�� movies, and the laughable Angelina Jolie sudser ��Beyond Borders��; in his journeyman hands, ��Casino Royale�� is a stylish, wholly enjoyable piece of work that lacks the organic zing a visionary director, like Christopher Nolan on ��Batman Begins,�� can bring to the party.
It hardly matters, though, because Craig is so good. If he�s a newcomer to American mass audiences, followers of British film know the actor from gangster movies like ��Layer Cake�� and dramas such as ��Enduring Love�� and ��The Mother��; he made an impression as one of the Israeli assassins in ��Munich�� and gave startling life to killer Perry Smith in the recent ��Infamous.��
No slight to Connery, Timothy Dalton, or Pierce Brosnan, but there�s something to be said for casting an actor of depth and creative daring as Bond. Craig hardly overplays the role, but he gives us proof of the young 007�s arrogance and immaturity, shows him tempered by mistakes, and even lets him fall in love with believable reluctance followed by commitment. (Green, for her part, keeps elegant pace.)
Then a few things occur from which the James Bond we know finally emerges: wiser, harder, locked, loaded. With barely a sign of strain, Craig delivers what we least expected: a portrait of the artist as a young spy.


         What becomes a legend most? How do you retool an icon without alienating a fan base that has been loyal for longer than the core movie audience has been alive? What, in other words, do you do with James Bond?
 
  Starting 44 years ago with Sean Connery starring as Agent 007 of the British secret service in "Dr. No," the 20 James Bond features have been as predictable in their suave posturings as the shaken-not-stirred martini preference of their protagonist.
 


         






    Now, with "Casino Royale," the hero with a thousand smirks has been given a shrewd and largely successful attitude adjustment that ups the series' reality quotient and provides an opportunity for star Daniel Craig to show a wide audience just how good an actor he is.
 
  Of course, the Bondmeisters have been too canny to jettison everything about their hero. "Casino Royale" retains the series' trademarks of beautiful, complaisant women in revealing outfits, high-tech gadgets and some of the best stunts in the business, here orchestrated by director Martin Campbell ("GoldenEye," "The Mask of Zorro"), one of the industry's most reliable organizers of chaos.
 
  And, frankly, not all aspects of the remake have been completely successful. Hoping to expand the series' largely male demographic reach, writers Paul Haggis and the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have attempted, with only partial success, to make a Bond romance more real than usual.
 
  Plus there is a disturbing torture sequence that makes a mockery out of the film's rating. If the words "intense sequences of violent action, a scene of torture, sexual content and nudity" don't exactly sound like the definition of PG-13 to you, you're probably not alone.
 
  One aspect of the new Bond that works from first minute to last is the most important one, and that is Craig's performance. With Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan taking their places as Connery's key successors, the Bond franchise has always been fortunate in its choice of leading men, and Craig is one of their wisest picks yet.
 
  Craig, who was Ted Hughes to Gwyneth Paltrow's Sylvia Plath in "Sylvia" and murderer Perry Smith in "Infamous," has both the physicality and presence to make this film's more brutal, less suave Bond, a man who would do anything to get the job done, completely persuasive.
 
  But while you buy Craig's cocky Bond as implacable and impervious to danger, someone who can convincingly say "Do I look like I give a damn?" when asked the famous "shaken or stirred" vodka martini question, you also believe him, and this is crucial, as a flesh-and-blood human being who can be physically hurt.
 
  "Casino Royale" needs this rougher-edged 007 because this was the first Bond book (previously filmed in a quasi-comic mode with Peter Sellers and David Niven in 1967) that Ian Fleming wrote. Though the plot has been updated to focus (inevitably) on terrorism and a critical card game has been changed from chemin de fer to the less elegant-sounding Texas hold 'em — this is still basically the story of how the Bond of then became the Bond everyone knows.
 
  After a prologue showing Agent 007's first two kills, "Casino Royale" moves briskly into the film's initial and most breathless (literally and figuratively) stunt. This is an elaborate chase through several crowded construction sites where the prey, terrorist Mollaka, is played by Sebastién Foucan, who is one of the inventors of a dazzling style of movement called parkour,
 or free running. The roughly five-minute sequence took a reported three months to prepare and shoot, typical of the kind of attention to production detail that is the hallmark of the series.
 
  Not pleased by Bond's cocky, not to say reckless, demeanor is his boss M (played for the fifth time by the reliable Judi Dench). But her critical comments ("Quite the body count you're stacking up") can't completely hide a kind of admiration for the man's cheek.
 
  Though he stops in the Bahamas for a seduction and in Miami for another breathless stunt (this one involving a giant airplane), Bond keeps on the trail of the deadly and emotionless Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen taking on the role Orson Welles had in 1967), a kind of E.F. Hutton for terrorists who invests the bad guys' money at a rate of return the God-fearing can only dream about.
 
  The heart of "Casino Royale" is set in Montenegro (filming was done in the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary), where Bond involves himself with a $150-million winner-take-all poker game and the beautiful and sassy Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bertolucci's "The Dreamers") finds the heart under Bond's brusque exterior.
 
  Though the film's final break-the-bank action sequence in Venice is worth waiting for, "Casino Royale's" 2-hour, 24-minute running time is long enough to exhaust all but the series' biggest fans.
 
  Still, the last words on the screen are ones you can take to the bank. "James Bond," it says, "will return." You can bet on it.
 

 
  MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action, a scene of torture, sexual content and nudity. Running time: 2 hours, 24 minutes. In general release.   

In the startling sequence that kicks off Casino Royale , we see James Bond (Daniel Craig, pictured), early in his career as a British secret service agent, dispatching two enemies in a pair of initiation kills that will elevate him to double-0 status. One of the kills is classic Bond, elegant and almost witty in its efficiency. Intercut with this icy execution is a far more lurid episode in which Bond beats the crap out of someone in a men's room, bashing him bloody until he expires. It's a side of Bond we haven't seen before  but, of course, it's a side that was always there. (You don't get a license to kill for being a nice guy.) In Casino Royale , Bond is still learning to tame his impulses into a style, and he's all the more dangerous because of it.
It's almost impossible to think of James Bond without fastening on the trappings: the gadgets, tuxedos, and martinis, the cocoa-butter babes, the slightly ironic thrust of macho perfection incarnated by the words ''Bond, James Bond.'' In many ways, though, the attitude of Bond, the internal quality that makes him tick, has long been reduced to just another trapping. The moment, really, that Sean Connery left the series, Bond became a jokey superhero in a dinner jacket, a guy who never flinches because he knows that he's sure to come out in his favorite position: on top.
Casino Royale , which is based on the first of Ian Fleming's British spy novels (it was published in 1953), relaunches the series by doing something I wouldn't have thought possible: It turns Bond into a human being again  a gruffly charming yet volatile chap who may be the swank king stud of the Western world, but who still has room for rage, fear, vulnerability, love. Daniel Craig, the superb British actor who has taken over the role, has small, wounded-looking eyes of coldest android blue, ears that stick out, and a mouth that puckers into a scowl. With his blondish hair trimmed to a thatchy bristle, Craig is handsome, and buff as hell, but not necessarily the most handsome guy around  he looks like a dyspeptic Steve McQueen. The fact that he isn't tall adds to the sense that he's always working a bit harder, that he's a badass with too much eating away at him to bother playing pretty-boy games. Craig's 007 has an itchy trigger finger, he treats M (Judi Dench) like a meddlesome aunt, and he growls at a bartender who asks if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, ''Do I look like I give a damn?''
That's the beauty of the movie. A Bond who doesn't give a damn, who's made affectless, even haunted, by what his job brings out in him, is a Bond we can all give more of a damn about. He speaks to an age of desperation, when the cosmetic barely holds sway over the cutthroat. In Casino Royale , Bond does many things he's done before  turns criminal pursuits into high-flying death stunts, plays world-class poker, faces worldclass torture. At one point, he engages in such a fierce battle inside a Venice palazzo that the building comes crumbling down (that's beyond spectacle  it's blasphemy). Yet Craig, speckled with facial cuts, plays Bond with an almost bruised virility, making each of these actions an expression of unruly will. Casino Royale , the most exciting Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service , has everything you want in a pop entertainment: physical audacity, intrigue, romance, but also a charge of personality that stayed with me for days.
Directed by Martin Campbell (GoldenEye ), the movie has a plot full of the usual vaguely topical hugger-mugger, with Bond trying to trap a banker to world terrorists  a numbers genius named Le Chiffre, who weeps tears of blood. Played with velvet Eurotrash sadism by Mads Mikkelsen, this mad capitalist isn't flamboyant enough to be a mythical supervillain, but when he and 007 face off in a poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro, the eye contact is electric, and it's one of the great sequences in any Bond film. Craig convinces you that Bond, shoving million-dollar chips to the center of the table, is literally ignoring the cards that the bluffing, the psychology is all. After an attempt is made to poison him, he tells his nemesis that the recent intermission ''nearly killed me,'' and Craig infuses that joke with a roughneck venom worthy of Connery.
There is also, of course, a girl, but this time she's a true romantic adversary. Vesper Lynd, played by the dancing-eyed French actress Eva Green, is a British Treasury official assigned to stake Bond in the poker game and, generally, keep tabs on him, and as these two fling insults back and forth, they melt each other's armor. Bond hasn't just met a babe; he has met his match. And we have met him, as if for the first time.

 The latest James Bond vehicle — call him Bond, Bond 6.0 — finds the British spy leaner, meaner and a whole lot darker. Now played by an attractive bit of blond rough named Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan having been permanently kicked to the kerb, Her Majesty’s favorite bad boy arrives on screens with the usual complement of cool toys, smooth rides, bosomy women and high expectations. He shoots, he scores, in bed and out, taking down the bad and the beautiful as he strides purposefully into the 21st century.  It’s about time. The likable Mr. Brosnan was always  more persuasive playing Bond as a metaphoric rather than an actual lady-killer, with the sort of polished affect and blow-dried good looks that these days tend to work better either on television or against the grain. Two of his best performances have been almost aggressively anti-Bond turns, first in John Boorman’s adaptation of the John le Carré novel “The Tailor of Panama,” in which he played a dissolute spy, and, more recently, in “The Matador,” a comedy in which he played a hit man with a sizable gut and alarmingly tight bikini underwear. Mr. Brosnan did not demolish the memory of his Bond years with that pot, but he came admirably  close.  Every generation gets the Bond it deserves if not necessarily desires, and with his creased face and uneasy smile, Mr. Craig fits these grim times well. As if to underscore the idea that this new Bond marks a decisive break with the contemporary iterations, “Casino Royale” opens with a black-and-white sequence that finds the spy making his first government-sanctioned kills. The inky blood soon gives way to full-blown  color, but not until Bond has killed one man with his hands after a violent struggle and fatally shot a second. “Made you feel it, did he?” someone asks Bond of his first victim. Bond doesn’t answer. From the way the director, Martin Campbell, stages the action though, it’s clear that he wants to make sure we do feel it.  “Casino Royale” introduced Bond to the world in 1953. A year later it  was made into a television drama with the American actor Barry Nelson as Jimmy Bond;  the following decade, it was  a ham-fisted spoof with David Niven as the spy and a very funny Peter Sellers as a card shark. For reasons that are too boring to repeat, when Ian Fleming sold the film rights to Bond, “Casino Royale” was not part of the deal. As a consequence the producers who held most of the rights decided to take their cue from news reports about misfired missiles, placing their bets on “Dr. No”  and its missile-mad villain. The first big-screen Bond, it hit in October 1962, the same month that Fleming’s fan John F. Kennedy took the Cuban missile crisis public.  The Vatican later condemned “Dr. No” as a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex.  Ka-ching! The film was a success, as was its relatively unknown star, Sean Connery, who balanced those descriptive notes beautifully, particularly in the first film and its even better follow-up, “From Russia With Love.”  In time Mr. Connery’s conception of the character softened, as did the series itself, and both Roger Moore and Mr. Brosnan portrayed the spy as something of a gentleman playboy. That probably helps explain why some Bond fanatics have objected so violently to Mr. Craig, who fits Fleming’s description of the character as appearing “ironical, brutal and cold” better than any actor since Mr. Connery. Mr. Craig’s Bond looks as if he has renewed his license to kill.  Like a lot of action films, the Bond franchise has always used comedy to blunt the violence and bring in big audiences. And, much like the franchise’s increasingly bloated action sequences, which always seem to involve thousands of uniformed extras scurrying around sets the size of Rhode Island, the humor eventually leached the series of its excitement, its sense of risk. Mr. Brosnan certainly looked the part when he suited up for “GoldenEye”  in 1995, but by then John Woo and Quentin Tarantino had so thoroughly rearranged the DNA of the modern action film as to knock 007 back to zero. By the time the last Bond landed in 2002, Matt Damon was rearranging the genre’s elementary particles anew in “The Bourne Identity.”  “Casino Royale” doesn’t play as dirty as the Bourne films, but the whole thing moves far lower to the ground than any of the newer Bond flicks. Here what pops off the screen aren’t the exploding orange fireballs that have long been a staple of the Bond films and have been taken to new pyrotechnic levels by Hollywood producers like Jerry Bruckheimer, but some sensational stunt work and a core seriousness. Successful franchises are always serious business,  yet this is the first Bond film in a long while that feels as if it were made by people who realize they have to fight for audiences’ attention, not just bank on it. You see Mr. Craig sweating (and very nice sweat it is too); you sense the filmmakers doing the same.  The characteristically tangled shenanigans — as if it mattered — involve a villainous free agent named Le Chiffre (the excellent Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), who wheels and deals using money temporarily borrowed from his equally venal clients. It’s the sort of risky global business that allows the story to jump from the Bahamas to Montenegro   and other  stops in between as Bond jumps from plot point to plot point, occasionally taking time out to talk into his cellphone or bed another man’s wife. Mr. Craig, whose previous credits include “Munich” and “The Mother,” walks the walk and talks the talk, and he keeps the film going even during the interminable high-stakes card game that nearly shuts it down.  If Mr. Campbell and his team haven’t reinvented the Bond film with this 21st edition,  they have shaken (and stirred) it a little, chipping away some of the ritualized gentility that turned it into a waxworks. They have also surrounded Mr. Craig with estimable supporting players, including the French actress Eva Green, whose talent is actually larger than her breasts.  Like Mr. Mikkelsen, who makes weeping blood into a fine spectator sport, Ms. Green brings conviction to the film, as do Jeffrey Wright and Isaach de Bankolé.  Judi Dench is back as M, of course, with her stiff lip and cunning. But even she can’t steal the show from Mr. Craig, though a human projectile by the name of Sébastien Foucan, who leads a merry and thrilling chase across Madagascar,  almost does.  “Casino Royale” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The sex is demure, the violence less so.

For once, there is truth in advertising: The credits proclaim Daniel Craig as "Ian Fleming's James Bond 007," and Craig comes closer to the author's original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery. "Casino Royale" sees Bond recharged with fresh toughness and arrogance, along with balancing hints of sadism and humanity, just as the fabled series is reinvigorated by going back to basics. The Pierce Brosnan quartet set financial high-water marks for the franchise that may not be matched again, but public curiosity, lack of much high-octane action competition through the holiday season and the new film's intrinsic excitement should nonetheless generate Bond-worthy revenue internationally.
Bond made his debut in "Casino Royale" when it was published in 1953, and while the novel was adapted the following year for American television (Barry Nelson played Bond) and in 1967 became a lame all-star spy send-up featuring Peter Sellers, David Niven and Woody Allen, it remained unavailable to the Eon producers until now.
As refashioned for this 21st series installment, the novel's focus on a high-stakes cards showdown doesn't kick in for an hour. But Craig's taking over as the sixth actor to officially portray the secret agent on the bigscreen (not including that first "Casino") provides a plausible opportunity to examine the character's promotion to double-0 status, which is neatly done in a brutal black-and-white prologue in which he notches his first two kills.
After the pic bleeds into color, Bond pursues a would-be suicide bomber in a madly acrobatic chase through an African construction site, at the end of which he happens to be filmed killing an apparently, if not in fact, unarmed man in images instantly disseminated on the Internet, to the enormous embarrassment of MI6. Welcome to the 21st century, Mr. Bond.
Doubling the displeasure of his boss M (Judi Dench happily back for her fifth turn) by surreptitiously entering her flat, Bond ignores her reprimand by high-tailing it to the Bahamas, itself a nice throwback to the film series' origins in "Dr. No." Following a cell phone trail of potential terrorist bombers, Bond tracks one, then another in Miami, where an evening that begins at a "Bodyworks" exhibition ends with a high-speed tarmac battle in which the fate of the world's biggest new jetliner hangs in the balance.
Even by this early juncture, the pic has emphatically announced its own personality. It's comparatively low-tech, with the intense fights mostly conducted up close and personally, the killings accomplished by hand or gun, and without an invisible car in evidence; Bond is more of a lone wolf, Craig's upper-body hunkiness and mildly squashed facial features giving him the air of a boxer; 007's got a frequently remarked upon ego, which can cause him to recklessly overreach and botch things, and the limited witticisms function naturally within the characters' interchanges.
As matters advance to the Continent, elements even more unusual in the Bond world of late, comprehensible plotting and palpable male-female frissons, move to the fore. Bond's enemy is not a Mr. Evil type plotting world domination, but a financier of international terrorism, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who needs to make financial amends by winning a big-pot poker game at the casino in fictional Montenegro. Bond plans to break Le Chiffre for good at the gambling table, and to this end he is fronted $10 million delivered by a most alluring messenger, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), assigned to keep tabs on the coin.
Their initial meeting on board a Euro fast train fairly crackles with a sexual undercurrent as they perceptively size one another up. But Vesper intends to maintain a professional distance from her temporary colleague, whose contest of wills and luck with Le Chiffre in the hushed confines of a private gaming room is repeatedly interrupted during breaks by spasms of violence and attempts on Bond's life.
Yarn does tend to go on a bit once it sails past the two-hour mark, but final stretch contains two indelible interludes crucial to defining this new incarnation of Bond. Constrained nude to a bottomed-out chair, Bond is tortured by Le Chiffre who repeatedly launches a hard-tipped rope upon his nemesis' most sensitive area, and Craig once and for all claims the character as his own by virtue of the supreme defiance with which he taunts Le Chiffre even in vulnerable extremis. Later, the startling, tragic turn in Bond's relationship with Vesper provides a measure of understanding for his rake-like tendencies down the line.
Script by series vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, along with Paul Haggis, hangs together reasonably well and is rewarded for its unaccustomed preoccupation with character by the attentiveness to same by director Martin Campbell, back after having helmed the first Brosnan entry, "GoldenEye," 11 years ago. Dialogue requires Bond to acknowledge his mistakes and reflect on the soul-killing nature of his job, self-searching unimaginable in the more fanciful Bond universes inhabited by Brosnan and Roger Moore.
Shrewd and smart as well as gorgeous, Vesper Lynd is hardly the typical Bond girl (she never even appears in a bathing suit), and Green makes her an ideal match for Craig's Bond. Danish star Mikkelsen proves a fine heavy, an imposing man with the memorable flaw of an injured eye that sometimes produces tears of blood. Giancarlo Giannini has a few understated scenes as a friendly contact in Montenegro, and while Jeffrey Wright has little to do as CIA man Felix Leiter, he does get off a couple of the film's best lines, and one can hope he may figure more prominently in forthcoming installments. Sebastien Foucan does some eyebrow-raising "free running" stunts in the African chase.
"Casino Royale" is the first Bond in a while that's not over-produced, and it's better for it. Production values are all they need to be, and while the score by David Arnold, in his fourth Bond outing, is very good, the title song, "You Know My Name," sung by Chris Cornell over disappointingly designed opening credits, is a dud.

By all rights, 2002's Die Another Day  should have and could have been the final James Bond  film. It was packaged like a cynical, weary best-of concert coughed up by an aging dinosaur, offering copious nods to the franchise's past without bothering to offer any new material of consequence. Yet here we are, not only prolonging the franchise but at its very beginning: the third attempt to perfect Casino Royale , the very first book in Ian Fleming 's series, which began in 1953.
Set in the present day, this kinetic, character-driven take is nonetheless intended to serve as the origin story of 007an introduction to the "mal-adjusted young man," as one love interest refers to him, who grows up to inherit a license to kill from Her Royal Highness.
And of course, Royale is intended to kick-start a moribund big-screen series that's had more low points than high. Yet to say Casino Royale ranks among the best Bond offerings is not intended as backhanded praise.
Absolutely it goes on too long, clocking in at 144 minutes, and absolutely half of the damned thing makes no sense at all, but beneath all the gimmicks and gadgetschief among them a collection of cell phones capable of doing things of which Catherine Zeta-Jones  never dreamedis an actor who brings to Bond all the things he's lacked since Sean Connery  fought the Cold War in a toupee.
Those who sweated and fretted Daniel Craig 's casting in the role clearly never saw Layer Cake , a sort of gangster-fried warm-up to Bond. Craig, excellent in both art house endeavors (The Mother , Enduring Love ) and blockbuster think pieces (Munich  ), has both a nasty streak and a soft side never before seen in the series; Fleming would recognize him as most like his literary creation: damaged goods in a tailored tux.
This Bond, unlike his smug, self-conscious predecessors, is a deadpan executioner with a penchant for letting his guard down too quickly. "I have no armor left," he tells this installment's love interest, British-treasury purse keeper Vesper Lynd  (Eva Green ), with whom Bond actually falls in love rather than merely into bed. This Bond's a rookie who makes mistakes that nearly lead to his death on several occasionsand to a torture sequence so simple yet so devious (and deviant) it makes Goldfinger's crotch laser seem tame. And this Bond has little interest in living up to the legend: When a bartender asks him if he'd like his martini shaken or stirred, Bond shoots back, "Do I look like I care?" In that instant, it's as if the part had never been anyone else's.
Adhering faithfully to the novel, writers Neal Purvis  and Robert Wade  (now on their third Bond movie) and Crash 's Paul Haggis  offer the quintessential Bond plot. There's the oily Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen ) with the slight disfigurement, in this case a scarred left eye that weeps blood. There's the story line, involving the funding of baddies trying to take over the world (terrorists, in this case, as opposed to yesteryear's Russians). And there's M (Judi Dench ), the scolding boss always one moment away from revoking Bond's license.
There's also the bullet-gray Aston Martin , the high-stakes card game (Texas hold-'em, to appeal to the dorm room audience), the champagne-and-caviar romp with a villain's wife, the travel mag settings (the Bahamas , Miami, Prague ), and all the other accoutrements that decorate the doings. We are starting over, but not from scratch. Bond fans don't want reinvention; they'll settle for rejuvenation.
Director Martin Campbell , who resurrected the franchise with GoldenEye  upon the hiring of Pierce Brosnan  11 years ago, accomplishes the same thing again tenfold. No Bond film has ever offered a chase sequence on par with the opening one here, during which Bond and a bomb maker scurry on foot all over Madagascar . It blends the raw materials of such free-running films as Ong-bak  and District B13 , in which characters gallop and soar through cityscapes like everyday supermen, with the archaic conventions of the franchise and refines the whole lot into something crisp, thrilling, and brand-new. And that is great praise to heap upon a 53-year-old character who you were just sure should have retired a long, long time ago.
