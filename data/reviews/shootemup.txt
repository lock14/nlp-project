The gleefully sleazy new action movie "Shoot 'Em Up" pits a mysterious Man With No Name against a sadistic hit man, and I'm guessing about three-quarters of the budget went to ammunition. Really, though, this is a battle of acting schools. In one corner we have Clive Owen as the glowering hero, barely twitching a facial muscle while the bodies stack up like cordwood. In the other corner is Paul Giamatti as the deadly nerd villain, chewing on the scenery as though it represented his first meal in months.
Who wins? It's a genre piece, so you can probably guess. In practice, though, "Shoot 'Em Up" is a disreputable but rakishly enjoyable Mexican standoff in which hambone and cold fish fight each other to a draw. Absolutely not for feminists, lovers of period films, and anyone whose sensibilities are bruised by over-the-top stuntwork, it's a cocktail made up of three parts testosterone to one part brains.
Writer-director Michael Davis wastes no time gunning the engine into the red. We see a carrot-munching Owen waiting for a bus in a lousy section of town, and then a terrified pregnant woman (Ramona Pringle) is running by him, fleeing a mob of gunmen. The hero decides to intervene; within minutes two dozen men are lying in pools of blood. Only then do the opening credits roll.
The woman gives birth, then gets dead, leaving Owen's character - he's eventually called Mr. Smith, but even that's a placeholder - in charge of the newborn. This is a gag in itself: the sad-eyed killing machine as Mr. Mom, shooting off an umbilical cord with a gun. Needing to feed the baby, he does the obvious: He finds a lactating hooker named DQ, played by the Italian arthouse sexpot Monica Bellucci. I'm not sure they cover this in "What to Expect When You're Expecting." Maybe in the next edition.
Leading the hordes of black-clad assassins is Mr. Hertz (Giamatti), a sarcastic middle-management type with serious anger issues. Hertz is always being interrupted mid-hit by his wife calling on the cellphone; there are a few har-de-har locker-room jokes about the old ball and chain that are funny once and then just dumb. In general, "Shoot 'Em Up" is never quite as witty as it thinks it is, at least when the characters open their mouths.
When they're shooting, though - or leaping or driving or stabbing each other in the neck with carrots - it's another matter entirely. Davis seems to have taken the film as a personal challenge to create action sequences that are faster, higher, crazier than any seen before. Mr. Smith doesn't share Bugs Bunny's taste in vegetables for nothing; a sizable chunk of the movie's DNA comes straight from a Warner Brothers cartoon.
For instance: The baby lies on a playground merry-go-round, with Smith several yards away when the killers appear; he uses bullets to get the kid spinning out of easy-target range. Later, Smith blows away eight or so gunmen while simultaneously having sex with DQ. The film climaxes (if you will) with a shoot-out in free-fall thousands of feet above the earth; the scene plays like 3D chess with bullets.
Why does everyone want the baby dead? There's an explanation that involves a presidential candidate (Daniel Pilon), a fascist gun manufacturer (Stephen McHattie), bone marrow, and surrogate mothers, and if you buy any of that, I know an online businessman in Nigeria who has a deal for you.
No, "Shoot 'Em Up" exists for its crunching ballet of flailing bodies and spinning cars, for its ghoulish black humor, and for its hopped-up, boys-only party vibe. If the Maxim audience didn't already exist, this movie would single-handedly invent it.
By now, you already know whether this is a movie you need to see or drive several miles out of your way to avoid. Even if you're in the latter camp, it's worth noting that Owen gives off fumes of class - he can't help it, really - and Giamatti has a highly entertaining time slumming it. Filmmaker Davis isn't quite in the same league, though, at least not yet. "Shoot 'Em Up" is extremely clever without actually being smart. It's the Coen Brothers for Dummies.


         It's unlikely that you'll see a more accurately named movie this year than "Shoot 'Em Up." From the moment a blitzkrieg of bullets riddle the New Line Cinema logo to the stylishly shell-shocked final credits, writer-director Michael Davis' hodgepodge homage to Hong Kong movie action is one gunfight after another leaving an inestimable body count in its wake.
 
 The vast majority of the kills are tallied by a poker-faced sharpshooter named Smith played with endearing grumpiness by Clive Owen. The film opens with Smith sitting on a bus bench munching a carrot, the significance of which soon becomes clear. The crunchy, orange vegetable not only indicates that the movie has no greater pretensions than a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but in the hands of Smith, is one lethal root.
 


         






   Smith witnesses a pregnant woman being chased into a warehouse by a man who clearly intends to kill her. Seeing no alternative, Smith joins the pursuit armed only with his carrot and what ensues is a bravura sequence in which he battles numerous bad guys and delivers and saves the baby amid a hail of gunfire -- though the baby's mother isn't so lucky.
 
 To see Smith running with the baby tucked under his arm like a football is to imagine the Clive Owen of "Sin City" charged with protecting the infant of "Children of Men." But rather than the future of humanity being at stake, it's the fate of that one baby that drives Smith.
 
 He's chased here by Paul Giamatti, as the sadistic mercenary Mr. Hertz backed by a disposable (and seemingly unlimited) army of guns for hire.
 
 Italian actress Monica Bellucci turns up as a lactating prostitute whom Smith needs for obvious reasons and the pair along with the baby form an unorthodox surrogate family. There's not a lot of heat between Bellucci and Owen save one sex scene but even that turns into a gunfight played to mostly comic effect.
 
 Davis combines the physicality of the "Transporter" movies with the ballistics of "Smokin' Aces" -- all of which owe a large debt to John Woo and other Asian action auteurs. Shot by Oscar-winner Peter Pau ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") and edited by Peter Amundson, the movie has a kinetic energy that would be envied by some bigger-budgeted Hollywood fare.
 
 Over-the-top doesn't begin to describe "Shoot 'Em Up's" set-pieces, most of which are undeniably entertaining. The director's knack for staging them, however, far outstrips his writing chops. The movie wastes a good chunk of its second half explicating the baby's rather lame back story.
 
 A sardonic attempt to inject some gun-control discourse never really goes anywhere and there's an impulse to fill in the blank slates of Smith and Hertz that should have been ignored. The farther afield the movie gets from its reason to be -- the shoot-em-up -- the less interesting it becomes.
 
 There are some pithy one-liners and self-referential jokes such as Owen's character's preference for stealing BMWs (the actor previously appeared in several shorts for the automaker) or Giamatti's taunting Smith by daring him to perform a sexual act on him "sideways," but the adrenaline kicks all involve guns and bullets.
 
 Owen and Giamatti would appear to be having a good time in a "Look, Ma! This ain't Shakespeare" kind of a way.
 
 Owen with his detached stoicism makes an excellent nihilist, one who professes to care about nothing but has a list of pet peeves a mile long. Balancing Owen's minimalist approach, Giamatti revels in being a tough guy and chews the scenery with the gusto of a "Batman" villain (1960s TV series version).
 
 The presence of the two actors and the film's mordant sense of humor buoy the downtime between bloodbaths and genre fans may find enough to love here.
 
 For others, the unabashed comic book crudeness will likely wear thin fast.
 
 "Shoot 'Em Up." MPAA rating: R for pervasive strong bloody violence, sexuality and some language. Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes. In general release.   

In Shoot 'Em Up , Clive Owen plays a man named Smith who never, ever stops firing his guns. He fires them two at a time, leaping across rooms  blam! blam! blam!   in glorious slow motion. He fires them in the middle of the sky, after plunging out of a plane without a parachute. He blasts away at an overly coiffed hairdo (''That ponytail doesn't make you look young, hip, or cool!''), at an umbilical cord that needs severing, at a team of assassins who burst into the room where he's making love  an activity he keeps on doing the entire time that he's shooting.
Smith, in other words, does exactly what you'd expect the hero of a bloody, trashy, volcanically depraved action movie to do. He just does it a little bit...more so, and that's the rollicking good joke of Shoot 'Em Up , which has the inspiration to send up over-the-top action movies from Tango & Cash to Die Hard  by nudging their slam-bang kinetic overkill right to the breaking point  but not past it. Michael Davis, the writer-director of Shoot 'Em Up , recognizes that the action genre long ago devolved into knowing self-parody. The signature taglines, the nonchalant perfection of the heroes' bullet-blasting moxie  all of this is so stylized it's already a joke. Clive Owen plays Smith as the classic megaplex loner-nihilist, a Bogart-meets-Bruce Willis with a heart of gold, and he does it absolutely straight, which is really the ultimate wink.
Smith's ''lovable'' trademark is chewing on carrots, like a film-noir Bugs Bunny. (He also uses them as weapons.) He teams up with a hooker (Monica Bellucci) who helps him to save an orphaned infant  a nod to John Woo's great Hard-Boiled . Paul Giamatti, as the villain, has just the right feral sadistic sweatiness, and he does great, exasperated takes on the words ''God damn  it!'' Shoot 'Em Up  isn't out to be the Airplane!  of ballistic blowouts (e.g., National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 ). In two scenes out of three, it could just about pass for the thing it's satirizing. But then its pulpy violent excess will tip over...into slightly more excessive excess. That's its silly, scuzzball joy.


 “So what do you think of the Second Amendment now?” This is one of many thought-provoking questions asked, between barrages of gunfire, in the course of “Shoot ’Em  Up.” I won’t answer the question here — I get enough angry e-mail, thanks — but I’m happy to affirm my general devotion to the whole Bill of Rights, in particular the First Amendment, which protects Michael Davis’s right to make this movie, New Line Cinema’s right to market it and, best of all, my right to tell you what a worthless piece of garbage it is. (I interrupt this burst of patriotism to note that “Shoot ’Em Up” was filmed in Toronto.)  First, let’s sample a bit more wisdom from the mouth of the movie’s hero, Smith, a righteous gunman played, with his usual charismatic glower, by Clive Owen. The person who profits, he advises, apropos of unraveling a nefarious conspiracy involving a United States senator, a firearms manufacturer, a lot of diapers and Paul Giamatti, is always the bad guy. Which leaves me off the hook, since not only did I not profit from “Shoot ’Em Up,” but I also lost 93 minutes I will never see again.  What I did see was Mr. Owen doing, as he did in the incalculably superior “Children of Men,” his utmost to protect a baby. Awwww. Sitting on a bench one evening, minding his business, Smith witnesses bad guys pursuing a pregnant woman. After a pause during which the person sitting next to me at the preview screening loudly beseeched Smith to help her, he did just that, dispatching a warehouse full of thugs and delivering a healthy infant.  The mother, sadly, took a bullet in the head, but her baby — it’s a boy, by the way — turned out to be pretty resilient. Wouldn’t you be if you had Monica Bellucci for a wet nurse?  Ms. Bellucci plays Donna Quintano, a lactating prostitute. That is not a sentence I thought I’d ever write, but I’m sure Ms. Bellucci feels the same way about some of her lines, like, “Does this give you any new ideas about who wants Oliver’s bone marrow?” Excellent question!  Oliver is the baby, by the way, and his bone marrow is needed to further the cause of gun control. Or to thwart the cause of gun control. In New Line’s press notes, Mr. Davis is quoted as saying that, in conceiving “Shoot ’Em Up,” “the hard part was to figure out the mystery and rationale as to why the bad guys want the baby.”  That task is no easier now that the movie has been made, though “made” (to say nothing of “movie”) is perhaps too generous a word for this slapdash assembly of hectic, poorly shot action sequences, lame catchphrases (tell me Mr. Owen didn’t say, “What’s up, Doc?”), sadistic gags and heavy-metal tunes. The body count is astronomical as Mr. Owen shoots ’em up while rappelling down a stairwell, driving a BMW and feigning intercourse with Ms. Bellucci. (Not all at once, by the way. Now that would be cool.) Also, he drives a carrot through the back of one man’s head and uses another one to put out an eye.  Which is funny because, you know, carrots are supposed to improve your eyesight. That’s about the level of wit to which “Shoot ’Em Up” aspires. Smith, described by Donna as “the angriest man in the world,” is full of large and small complaints, usually prefaced by “You know what I hate?” Again with the questions! He hates aggressive drivers and so forces one off the road. He hates the corporal punishment of children and so gives a guilty mom a spanking. He even hates guns, which is why he shoots down scores of bit players.  You know what I hate? Witless, soulless, heartless movies that mistake noise for bravura and tastelessness for wit. I’d never call myself the angriest man in the world, but after sitting through “Shoot ’Em Up,” I felt some sympathy for poor Smith.  “Shoot ’Em Up” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic violence, swearing and a lactating prostitute.

Director Michael Davis makes the transition from straight-to-DVD stinkers to the bigscreen in conspicuous fashion, with an action movie that is violent and vile in equal measure. When hitman Paul Giamatti is dispatched to assassinate a pregnant woman, not-so-innocent bystander Clive Owen intervenes on the baby's behalf, unleashing a firefight of epic proportions. Good taste is the first fatality in this gonzo thrill-seeker, sure to offend mainstream dispositions, yet too stylistically audacious to dismiss outright. Like "Running Scared" and "Boondock Saints" before it, shamelessly sordid pic, which opens Sept. 7, will likely fall short theatrically but find its audience on DVD.
As Mr. Smith (Owen) is minding his own business, a car comes careening around the corner in pursuit of a pregnant woman. Smith pulls a carrot from his trenchcoat and takes a hearty bite, a gesture meant to set the tone for the cartoonishly over-the-top action sequences to come. A better indicator comes moments later when Smith drives the carrot through the would-be assassin's skull, or, shortly thereafter, as he delivers the woman's baby amid heavy crossfire, severing the umbilical cord with a well-aimed bullet.
Smith survives the opening action scene -- a jaw-dropping ordeal for both its ingenuity and sheer tactlessness -- but the anonymous woman isn't so lucky, leaving Smith in charge of the orphaned infant. Luckily, he just so happens to know a lactating hooker, DQ (Monica Bellucci as a Madonna-whore hybrid), who, with understandable reluctance, agrees to assume the mother's role in this dysfunctional family.
After a little snooping, the couple uncovers a convoluted plot by which an ailing presidential candidate (Daniel Pilon) plans to harvest bone marrow from surrogate babies (typical of Davis' sense of humor, the artificially inseminated mothers provide the off-color pun of the movie's title). Giamatti is in gruffly manic mode as Hertz, a short-tempered assassin with no more luck than Elmer Fudd in capturing his prey, but a nearly inexhaustible supply of henchmen to assist the cause.
Hertz sets one trap after another to ensnare Smith and kill the child, thwarted at every turn by clever tricks that would make even John Woo jealous. Smith's backstory is never revealed, but it's clear the character is no stranger to heavy artillery and ordnance, with a MacGyver-like skill for devising impromptu Rube Goldberg contraptions.
Owen's rugged persona lends itself to the hard-boiled hero. (Could any other actor make eating carrots look cool? In this film-noir world, the vegetable supplants cigarettes, while conveniently doubling as a deadly weapon.) And though Owen claims he was never offered the role of James Bond, Davis' action-movie homage revels in those details sidelined in "Casino Royale" -- namely, groan-inducing one-liners and degrading sexual shenanigans.
The director's inspiration was Chow Yun-Fat's baby-saving scene in "Hard Boiled," and Davis' elaborately choreographed set pieces demonstrate no shortage of invention. Still, it's hard to appreciate the action without thinking of the baby, tucked under Owen's arm like some kind of football, in peril at all times.
The film's gentlest scene features the helpless child, stashed in a grimy bathtub for lack of a bassinet, watching wide-eyed as Smith demonstrates the different parts of his pistol. Moved by this display of tenderness, DQ promptly seduces him, but their sexual romp is interrupted by the arrival of Hertz's goons. And so it is that "Shoot 'Em Up" features all stages of life -- intercourse, birth and death (but mostly death) -- meted out amid elaborate gun battles.
At one point, Smith and DQ discover the baby doesn't cry in the presence of heavy metal -- which makes up the majority of the film's soundtrack, lending a gnarly energy to the whole affair. Nor does it seem to mind heavy gunfire, which is just as well, since the child has known little else in its short life.
Somewhere in all this lies a statement about gun control, a mixed message if ever there was one, and New Line shouldn't be surprised to find this pic in the sights of concerned parents. Though it belongs to the same questionable new category of exploitation film as "Smokin' Aces" and "Domino," there's nothing to say Davis' audacious style wouldn't function equally well with less offensive material. One can only imagine how his energetic talents might have redeemed "The Pacifier."

In this extremely violent guilty pleasure of a thriller, Clive Owen  is Mr. Smith, a tough guy in a long leather coat who comes to the rescue of a screaming pregnant woman being chased by a creep with a gun. A warehouse shoot-out and birth ensue, and before long, Smith is tucking the infant under his arm and running for his life, a snarling Paul Giamatti  and an army of hit men on his tail. Writer-director Michael Davis  freely admits to lifting the idea for Shoot 'Em Up  from the classic baby-in-peril hospital shoot-out in John Woo 's 1992 thriller Hard-Boiled , a strategy he expands by gleefully referencing Raising Arizona , The Matrix , and James Bond  movies. Riffing on 007 is such old hat as to be a sign of lazy screenwriting, but the jokes take on new resonance with the presence of Owen. There's no way to watch this Oscar-nominated Brit running, leaping, and firing a gun in a single, elegant bound and not wonder anew just how close he came to landing the big part.
