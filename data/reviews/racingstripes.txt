Stripes is the name of a zebra who thinks he's a horse. But just as Stripes is not really a horse of a different color, this partially animated kids picture is not a movie of a different stripe. Mixing live action (human and animal) with animated animal mouths that make it appear as though the animals are talking, Stripes
' sense of wonder was old hat even back when Mr. Ed
 was in fashion. The movie's messages are appropriate for the little tykes (be true to yourself, follow your dreams, etc.), and so too are its voluminous poop jokes. Adults will find Stripes
 tolerable at best, and the youngsters will probably show little more enthusiasm. The film begins as the baby Stripes becomes separated from his mother during a torrential downpour that besets a circus caravan. Like a babe in the bulrushes, Stripes is taken in by the kindly Nolan Walsh (Greenwood), a farmer and former horse trainer who gave up the profession when his wife died in a riding accident. His adolescent daughter Channing (Panettiere) names the zebra Stripes, and after raising him for several years wants to race him in the Kentucky Open despite her father�s objections. Stripes is surrounded by a whole petting zoo of animals offering advice: a goat, Shetland pony, pelican, rooster, and bloodhound (voiced in turn by Goldberg, Hoffman, Pantoliano, Foxworthy, and Snoop Dogg � who, it should be noted, only has three lines of dialogue and seems added as a gratuitous afterthought). Harvey and Spade give voice to two fully animated flies, whose frequent soft landings in dung piles and such provide most of the film�s scatological humor. The human actors fare better: All deliver better performances than the script requires, including Malick as the racetrack-owning villain (she gets her comeuppance in the end when the pelican poops on her from above) and Walsh as the grizzled track rat who believes in Stripes. As the voice of the grown-up Stripes, however, Muniz lacks the tone of cuddly cuteness that would have made Stripes a more enduringly endearing character. Simply put, no matter what this zebra thinks of himself, Stripes
 is no thoroughbred.


"Babe" meets "National Velvet" meets "A Bug's Life" meets "The Jackie Robinson Story." That's probably how the pitch meeting for "Racing Stripes" went, and that's exactly how the movie plays. It could have been worse. They could have thrown in "Old Yeller" and shot the zebra at the end.
Simultaneously overplotted and simplistic, the new barnyard/racecourse comedy from Warner Brothers is predictable every step of the way, and it contains at least three too many poop jokes.
But it's sunny and inoffensive and, besides, you're not the movie's target audience, are you? My kids, while recognizing that they'd seen it all before, had a perfectly pleasant time -- even the picky older one -- and gladly gave "Stripes" three stars. It gets an even two from me, meaning no better and no worse than the standard studio kiddie fare, and thus we have a weighted average (because I weigh more) of two and a half stars. This is a science, folks, so don't try it at home.
"Racing Stripes" starts with the accidental loss of a baby zebra from the back of a circus truck onto a dark and stormy nighttime road. The foal is taken in by Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood), a former star racehorse trainer embittered by the death of his wife in a riding accident; his teenage daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) names the animal Stripes and raises him to adulthood. No one from the circus comes looking for the zebra and no one really seems to care.
Did I mention that Stripes and his barnyard confreres talk? In a page swiped from "Babe," their lips digitally move and the voices of Famous Hollywood Stars issue from their furry little mouths. So we get Frankie Muniz as Stripes, Whoopi Goldberg as Franny the sensible goat, Mandy Moore as Sandy the filly, you-might-be-a-redneck comedian Jeff Foxworthy as Reggie the Rooster, Joshua Jackson as snotty young racehorse Trenton's Pride, and, just as I'm getting depressed typing this, Dustin Hoffman as a doughty pony named Tucker.
Tucker becomes the Burgess Meredith to Stripes's Rocky, convincing the kid he has what it takes to win the Kentucky Open, and Hoffman's impatiently honking line readings are about all that separate parents in the audience from the lobby. Between this and "Meet the Fockers," the actor deserves a Cy Young Award for most saves.
Stripes wants desperately to race at the course over the hill but is vilified as an outsider and a "freak" by the snooty horses on the other teams -- er, at the other stables. Nolan and Channing, meanwhile, are getting the ice-queen treatment from track owner and champion breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick of "Just Shoot Me"), and Channing has to convince doubting dad both that she can ride and Stripes can win. Phew! Cliff Notes, anyone?
Then there's the film's low-comedy relief, which comes in the forms of a mafiosi "hit pelican" on the lam from New Jersey (Joe Pantoliano, hitting every "Sopranos" clich square on the head) and two computer-animated flies, Buzz and Scuzz, voiced respectively by Steve Harvey and David Spade. The two comedians are funny, even when Scuzz falls into a horse turd in a much-too-close close-up. Joey Pants is not, especially when the script has the pelican expelling droppings on the bad guys. Note to the four screenwriters: "Babe" didn't get a best-picture nomination for the cow flops.
"Racing Stripes" turns oddly melodramatic toward the end, when Sandy is somehow kidnapped by Sir Trenton (voiced by Fred Dalton Thompson), the sire of Trenton's Pride and a horse who would twirl his mustache if horses had 
mustaches. Otherwise, there's not an iota of doubt as to where the movie is headed and there are no surprises in getting there. Every so often, director Frederik Du Chau cuts to a bloodhound on the Walsh back porch who lifts his head, says something amusing in the drawling cadences of Snoop Dogg, then goes back to sleep. Parents may find this an eminently sensible approach.


         In the live-action talking animal genre, "Racing Stripes" is no "Babe" but should delight youngsters, although parents likely will find it is sentimental in the extreme, with a plot that telegraphs every development. Efficiently directed, however, by Frederik Du Chau from David F. Schmidt's script, the film is populated with endearing animals that are expertly anthropomorphized and that are voiced by, among others, a sprinkling of famous names, including Dustin Hoffman, no less.
 
  In a well-staged opening sequence, a traveling circus is packing up in the midst of a storm and inadvertently overlooks a baby zebra that is rescued by farmer Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood), much to the delight of his daughter, Channing (Hayden Panettiere). Walsh has been widowed since his jockey wife and her horse were killed in a racing accident. As a result, he has given up training horses for his nasty neighbor (Wendie Malick), the greedy queen of the Kentucky racing circuit, and ekes out a living as a farmer. Three years pass and the zebra, called Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz), unaware that he is not a horse, has an itch for racing. So does Channing, even though it's the last thing her father would permit her to do. Clearly, Channing and Stripes will prevail.
 


         






    Much of the movie is devoted to barnyard antics, as Stripes is befriended and schooled by the Walshes' veritable menagerie. Most influential is the gruff Shetland pony Tucker (Hoffman), who understands and encourages Stripes' urge to race. Never mind that a zebra doesn't have the size and strength of a horse, Tucker tells Stripes, he has the biggest heart he ever encountered. The goat Franny (Whoopi Goldberg) chimes in from time to time with advice, as does Goose (Joe Pantoliano), a gangster pelican on the lam. The liveliest — and hippest — of the farm creatures are a pair of zany horseflies, Buzz (Steve Harvey) and Scuzz (David Spade).
 
  Life lessons about the importance of self-acceptance and the pursuit of one's dream are implicit and refreshingly free of heavy-handedness, and the film's large cast, which includes M. Emmet Walsh, is effective.
 
  Making a bunch of animals seem as if they really are talking is not the only trick "Racing Stripes" pulls off: It was filmed entirely in South Africa, but audiences might never guess that it wasn't shot in America's bluegrass country.

For the jaded adult, there's something casually terrifying about Racing Stripes . The kids in my theater were unfazed, cheering on plucky zebra Stripes (sullenly voiced by Frankie Muniz) as he overcomes thoroughbred prejudice to compete in the ''Kentucky Open.'' Yup, it's a ''race'' picture  but there are good reasons why zebras and horses don't mix on the track (unbridgeable size and speed differentials come to mind), and no amount of CGI can disguise them. So what disturbed me? Was it the manic poo humor? The dead-eyed charmlessness of the creatures (voiced by Snoop Dogg and, it seems, whoever wasn't busy with a relaunch of Celebrity Mole )? The gratingly referential sub-Shrek script? No, it was the Shetland pony, which sports both Dustin Hoffman's pipes and his I Heart Huckabees  toupee, and will haunt my nightmares forever.

acing Stripes" is a ragtag patchwork of themes from several children's classics: the girl-horse love story of "National Velvet," the cross-species envy of "Babe" and the farmyard banter of "Charlotte's Web." When a baby zebra is accidentally abandoned by a traveling circus, a kindly farmer named Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) rescues the trembling foal and takes it home to be raised by his animal-mad daughter, Channing (Hayden Panettiere). Young Stripes (with the voice of Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") grows up believing that like the Kentucky thoroughbreds on the other side of the fence, he is a born racehorse. After a few humiliating matchups with his far faster equine counterparts, Stripes vows to devote his life to training for the "Kentucky Open," and - to everyone's astonishment but the audience's - the little zebra that could winds up in the winner's circle. This small, slight film manages to combine an endearingly dinky quality with a hefty dose of directorial ambition. While children thrill to the spectacle of animals that talk, their parents will imagine the nightmare of directing a feature-length film with mainly nonhuman actors. Most of the animation is done "Babe"-style, as live animals speak through computer-animated mouths. Unfortunately, the equine face is nowhere near as naturally expressive as the porcine one, and much of "Racing Stripes" is disconcertingly reliant on close-ups of horse heads that look as nobly immobile as slabs of lumber. But the children at the screening I attended seemed spellbound, and you have to respect the craftsmanship behind a film whose credits include "goat wrangler." Among the human actors, Mr. Greenwood seems to have parachuted in from another movie - he plays the wary, resigned Walsh with a nuanced elegance that's likely to be lost on four-foot-tall audience members giggling at pony poop. As Walsh's daughter and Stripes's jockey, Ms. Panettiere overdoes her character's indeterminately rural accent (there's a lot of ridin' and hopin'), but she has a sweet, old-fashioned screen presence that may qualify her as her generation's Hayley Mills. The vocal talent is top-notch: Dustin Hoffman, as a gruff Shetland pony named Tucker, is so precise in his delineation of the character that by the end of the film, the animal has come to resemble the bewigged Hoffman in "I {oheart} Huckabees." Other celebrity beasties include Mandy Moore as a sexy filly, Whoopi Goldberg as a levelheaded goat and Joe Pantoliano as Goose, a big-city pelican on the run from the mob. Mr. Pantoliano's frenetic dialogue is laced with "Sopranos" and "Godfather" references that are at once too sophisticated to amuse youngsters and too pointless to entertain their parents, but the gangling bird's broad physical comedy will hit its mark with both. Steve Harvey and David Spade, as two scatologically inclined flies named Buzz and Scuzz, cheerfully contribute to lowering the tone, while Snoop Dogg, who's been known to steal other films singlehandedly with his sly wit, gives a lazy performance as a lazy bloodhound. "Racing Stripes" is unlikely to ascend to the pantheon of perennially watchable children's films, but like its hero (and that of every other horse-racing picture yet committed to celluloid), what it lacks in skill, it makes up for in heart. "Racing Stripes" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some slightly objectionable language and numerous close-ups of manure.

A "Babe"-licious mix of human thesps and CGI-tweaked animals, "Racing Stripes" is poised to run a profitable sprint through megaplex tracks before it hits its stride as a long-distance homevid frontrunner. Feel-good family-skewing pic about a plucky zebra who competes with thoroughbreds is frisky and funny enough to please pre-teens, but still witty enough to amuse even those parents who don't recognize Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg and other notables among the unseen vocal talents.
Working from serviceable script credited to David F. Schmidt, helmer Frederik Du Chau -- whose only previous directing credit is the animated "Quest for Camelot" (1998) -- strikes a predictable but mostly pleasing balance between rib-tickling and heart-tugging elements.
During a dark and stormy night on a rural Kentucky back road, former horse trainer Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) finds a baby zebra that was inadvertently abandoned by a traveling circus. Nolan brings the little critter home fully intending to turn him over to authorities. But Nolan's young daughter, Channing (Hayden Panettiere), names the zebra Stripes and begs permission to raise the four-legged foundling as a pet. Nolan reluctantly agrees.
Readily accepted by other barnyard residents, Stripes (persuasively voiced by Frankie Muniz) comes of age among such colorful characters as Tucker (Dustin Hoffman), a cranky Shetland Pony; Franny (Whoopi Goldberg), a sage goat; Reggie (Jeff Foxworthy), a dim-bulb rooster; and Lightning (Snoop Dog), an ineptly named lazy-bones dog. But Stripes is drawn to the racetrack at a neighboring estate run by snooty horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Woodzie (M. Emmet Walsh), a grizzled race track tout, thinks the zebra has the right stuff for racing, and encourages Nolan to train Stripes for the upcoming Kentucky Open. But Nolan abandoned racing after the death of his wife in a riding accident. Years later, he's still reluctant to resume his former trade and even less willing to allow Channing to train as a jockey. In the end, though, Channing gets a chance to ride Stripes in the Kentucky Open - with a little help from Tucker and a couple of smart-alecky horseflies named Buzz (Steve Harvey) and Scuzz (David Spade).
Pic does a fine job of enabling auds to willingly suspend disbelief as various quadrupeds and winged insects converse. (Only the horseflies are completely computer-generated; other creatures are real beasts enhanced with animated lip-movements.) Kudos to a world-class production team that includes animal trainer Karl Lewis Miller ("Babe," "Beethoven") and special effects supervisors Kent Houston, Dion Hatch, Eric Rosenfeld. Other tech values, including well-chosen pop tunes by Sting and Bryan Adams, contribute to overall cross-generational appeal.
Among the vocal talents, Hoffman makes the most engaging impression as the perpetually grumpy and under-appreciated pony. But Joe Pantoliano gets some of the biggest laughs as Goose, a bellicose pelican from New Jersey who claims to be hiding from vengeful mobsters. Parents likely will guffaw even louder than their kids whenever the tough-talking bird snarls dialogue lifted from classic mob-themed pix.
Spade and Harvey are stuck with a few too many poop jokes, the prime reason for PG rating, but they, too, have their moments.
With so many scene-stealing co-stars, human players deserve credit simply for not being entirely upstaged. Greenwood and Panettiere infuse their roles with appealing sincerity, while Walsh is appropriately rumpled and crusty. Malick deftly stops short of going completely over the top, and even manages to spike her cartoonish villainy with a hint of saucy hauteur that recalls the late, great Rosalind Russell.
Although set in Kentucky, "Racing Stripes" was shot on location in South Africa. Presumably, it's easier to find competitive zebras in that part of the world.

About halfway through Racing Stripes , there's a gag where a pair of horseflies fall ass-backward into a heap of shit, only to assume they've died and gone to heaven. If there's a better metaphor for the plight of any kiddie caregiver forced to sacrifice another Saturday afternoon to this unfortunate series of clichés, I can't think of it. The film shares a problem with its hero: identity crisis. Stripes is a zebra who thinks he's a horse who wants to be a race horse, but his eponymous two-color tones leave him a pariah mocked by his rival, Trenton 's Pride, as half horse, half fence. His story seems initially to be Babe  lite, a quaint moral fable uttered from the Clutch Cargo  mouths of the crass menagerie of barnyard usual suspects (and voiced mostly by an onslaught of slumming B-listers). Once the Aladdin- y referential humor surfaces"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in," hams Joe Pantoliano  as Goose, the pelican contract killer from Jersey, anticipating parental lamentsthe film's multiple personality disorder starts to show. By the time the ass puns and poo humor start peppering the landscape, awake adults might start to envy those able to sleep through their kid's cackling. That'll do, zebra. That'll do.
