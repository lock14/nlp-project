 “I’m not who you think I am,” says Tracey Berkowitz, the 15-year-old protagonist of “The Tracey Fragments.” Since she has also described herself, with evident irony, as a typical teenage girl, it is not always clear what she thinks of herself. And this confusion is part of the point of this short, powerful feature, directed by Bruce McDonald from a script by Maureen Medved (based on her novel). Tracey (Ellen Page) is a squall of conflicting emotions and perceptions, a volatile compound of anger, vulnerability, curiosity, recklessness and fear.  In this she may indeed be typical, and the story Mr. McDonald’s movie tells may also be somewhat familiar. Viewed as the sum of its sad, sometimes horrific incidents, “The Tracey Fragments” seems like the kind of adolescent melodrama, at once prurient and cautionary, that has become a staple of young-adult literature. Tracey’s home life is a near-caricature of middle-class dysfunction. Dad (Ari Cohen) rages and drinks; Mom (Erin McMurtry) broods and chain-smokes; Tracey’s little brother, Sonny (Zie Souwand), barks like a dog and then disappears. The shrink (Julian Richings, dressed as a woman) is not much help.  At school things are worse, as the usual mean-girl humiliations sink to Sadean depths of abasement, and Tracey’s crush on a dreamy new boy reaches a pitch of longing matched in the songs (by Broken Social Scene and others) that adorn the soundtrack. The drab city into which Tracey descends in search of Sonny is a purgatory of monsters, losers and freaks. It is hard to say, glimpsing Tracey wrapped in a filthy curtain, muttering to herself at the back of a bus, whether she has joined their ranks or fallen victim to their depredations.  In the hands of a more literal-minded filmmaker “The Tracey Fragments” might well have been dreary and unbearable, a chronicle of florid self-pity justified by arbitrary cruelty. Instead it is fierce, enigmatic and affecting. Some of this has to do with Ms. Page, who seems to be everywhere these days in the wake of “Juno” (which was filmed after “The Tracey Fragments”)  and who brilliantly embodies precocious intelligence under various forms of duress. While the full range of trauma that befalls Tracey does not seem entirely plausible, Ms. Page is never less than convincing.  And in any case the movie is less about what happens to her than it is the record of her perceptions. Mr. McDonald, assisted by some impressively inventive editors, scrambles chronology, splinters the screen and layers the sound design to turn “The Tracey Fragments” into the elusive, anguished record of an inner world. Nearly every shot dissolves, multiplies and recurs, so that the screen becomes a space of contending interpretations, rather than the objective mirror of a single reality.  When split-screen techniques are used in films like the original version of “The Thomas Crown Affair,” “Timecode”  and “Conversations With Other Women,” it is usually so that the audience can see the same action, simultaneously, from different angles. Mr. McDonald does some of this, but more often he shatters and scatters images to amplify their expressive power, and to induce a state of sensory and cognitive overload analogous to Tracey’s troubled consciousness.  The 77 minutes of “The Tracey Fragments” are not always easy to endure or to believe, but their cumulative effect is also hard to shake.

Split-screen techniques fail to hide a paucity of content and a piecemeal narrative in "The Tracey Fragments," the latest offering from vet Canadian indie helmer Bruce McDonald. Pic is derived from a series of '80s monologues about a disturbed teenage girl, which screenwriter Maureen Medved fashioned into a novel. Faux-MTV artiness may fool fest auds into thinking they are watching something cutting-edge. Wider audience will prove more elusive, as protag's contemporaries are unlikely to be convinced by their parents' idea of avant-garde.
Tracey Berkowitz ("Hard Candy's" Ellen Page), in her own words, is an average teenage girl who hates herself. She's tormented by girls and boys alike at school primarily for being flat-chested, while at home she has an angry, unsuccessful father (Ari Cohen) and a booze- and drug-addled mom (Erin McMurty).
Tracey's voiceover informs auds that she hypnotized her tweener brother Sonny (Zie Souwand) into believing he is a dog. Most images of Sonny, however, are memories, as the boy has gone missing, and much of the film is taken up with Tracey's haphazard search for him.
The narrative, which only intermittently travels in a straight line, is supposed to represent Tracey's confused mind. She only has two sources of help: her glam-rock fantasies about the new boy at school, Billy Zero (Slim Twig), and her man-in-drag therapist Dr. Heker (Julian Richings), who is as clearly as much a part of the dysfunctional system around Tracey as her parents are.
Page is generally commanding as the self-pitying teenager, but there are several moments when, let down by the text, the young thesp obviously does not believe what she is saying. Supporting actors nail the caricatures McDonald was seeking, but effect does cast no favors.
Despite the substantial effort required for a helmer and his team (conceptual design is credited to co-editor Jeremiah Munce) to mount such a multifaceted narrative, pic is no more successful than most split-screen films, which rarely work to the sustained satisfaction of an audience.
In its application of split-screen, pic is more relentless than most of its antecedents, including Andy Warhol's "Chelsea Girls" or Mike Figgis's "Timecode." More often than not, the procedure is just plain irritating. Only occasionally does the constellation of images congeal into something that is memorable.
HD and 35mm lensing is dominated by a blue-tinged grunge look. Despite the visual emphasis, film owes much of its energy to its persistent soundtrack, and comes most alive when using Patti Smith's American punk classic "Horses." Tech credits are strong.

"My name is Tracey Berkowitz . Fifteen. Just a normal girl who hates herself." Again leading as a deadpan, snarky, eponymous naïf dealing with issues way beyond her maturity level, Juno s Ellen Page  confesses to the camera an angry, diaristic account of how her bullied dreamer wound up in the back of a bus, naked beneath a shower curtain, searching for her hypnotized brother. Replicating the splintered prose of Maureen Medved s novel-cum-screenplay, cult Canadian director Bruce McDonald  (Highway 61 ) reveals the murky detailssome true, others defense-mechanism fantasies in Traceys brooding rock-star brainentirely in dynamic split-screen shards, linearity be damned. Unlike the frustrating gimmickry of Mike Figgis s Timecode  and Hotel , McDonalds bedazzling multi-frame experiment poeticizes and enhances an otherwise slender story (forgivable at only 77 minutes long), as planes of different sizes and shapes materializefading, sliding, distorting, and overlapping to convey the rage and anxiety of damaged adolescence. Funhouse-cloned images giddily intensify disturbing moments, hazy memories take the form of asymmetric repetitions, and walls literally close in. Beyond its overarching aesthetic, The Tracey Fragments   co-stars Toronto rockabilly punk Slim Twig  as a Tim Burton  caricature of Pretty in Pink s Duckie and boasts a score by Broken Social Scene ; it would all swagger dangerously close into hipster-trash territory if not for Pages pathos and wit, honest to blog.
