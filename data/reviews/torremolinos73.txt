Torremolinos 73  has the dubious distinction of being just about the mildest porno comedy ever made. It's like something the teenage Pedro Almodóvar might have written to shock his 10th-grade creative writing teacher. In Franco's Spain during the early '70s, Alfredo (Javier Cámara), a failed encyclopedia salesman, is about to get downsized when he learns his company is undergoing a transition. It will now produce a series of ''educational'' super-8 sex films. Alfredo and his wife, the lovely, subdued Carmen (Candela Pe`a), are given a camera and offered the chance to perform in their own homemade skin flicks at 50,000 pesetas a pop.
Amusing as it is to learn that this fuddy-duddy couple enjoys a robust sex life, in a strange way it neuters the movie. Shooting self-made erotica doesn't change them; it's just a job they take on so that they can afford to have a baby. What does change is that Alfredo decides he wants to be Ingmar Bergman  literally. He writes a script based on The Seventh Seal , which gets produced after Carmen becomes a popular porn star in Scandinavia. Torremolinos 73  is at once far-fetched and saccharine  not a great combination. They should have called it Cinema Pornadiso .

n "Torremolinos 73," the charming debut feature film of the Spanish director Pablo Berger, Alfredo Lopez (Javier C�mara) is a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman in Spain during the Franco era, struggling to make ends meet while his wife, Carmen (Candela Pe�a), dreams of having a baby. On a business trip, Alfredo's boss, Don Carlos (Juan Diego), tells the couple of his latest publishing project: a "World Encyclopedia of Reproduction," to be shot on Super-8 film and marketed in Scandinavian countries. At first, Alfredo and Carmen shy away from the idea of making and starring in their own amateur porn film, but desperate for money, they agree to participate in Don Carlos's experiment. To their surprise, Alfredo and Carmen soon find they have previously unsuspected gifts: he, for directing erotic films, and she, for acting in them. Before long, they are swimming in cash and - to Carmen's discomfort - being recognized in public by star-struck Scandinavian travelers. Still, the couple fail to conceive a child, which leaves Carmen increasingly depressed as Alfredo withdraws into his work. When they head to an off-season tourist resort to film Alfredo's "masterpiece," a Bergmanesque sex film called "Torremolinos 73," an unexpected turn of events brings them to a crisis. This film's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like "A Hole in My Heart"; like Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," this is an affectionate portrait of the artist as a movie-mad amateur. Mr. C�mara, whom viewers will recognize as the nurse obsessed with a comatose patient in Pedro Almod�var's film "Talk to Her," gives an exquisitely calibrated performance as a beleaguered Everyman who discovers himself behind the viewfinder of a movie camera, while Ms. Pe�a is equally perfect as the initially repressed, then irrepressible Carmen. The long, conflict-free middle section of the film, which includes musical montages of clips from Alfredo's contributions to the encyclopedia, slackens the pace a bit. But "Torremolinos 73" is such a joyous celebration of sex and filmmaking that viewers will forgive its director for taking time out to enjoy a little of both.

"Torremolinos 73" is a pleasing, subdued take on one couple's short-lived flirtation with the 70's porn industry toward the end of the Franco regime, when cinema sex in Spain was still a cardinal sin. Pic, which walked off with best film, director, actor and actress awards at the recent Malaga fest, firmly establishes debuting Pablo Berger as a helmer to watch. Somewhat wacky tale, based on real events, is kept anchored in reality through attention to detail and by first-rate central perfs. First weekend B.O. at the end of April was solid, and further fest showings are a real option, though offshore auds may need a little more social context to make full sense of things.
Balding, mustachioed Alfredo Lopez (Javier Camara, playing a timid taboo-breaker not dissimilar from his role in "Talk to Her") is a struggling encyclopedia salesman whose wife, hairdresser Carmen (Candela Pena) is desperate for a child. Lopez's publisher boss, Don Carlos (Juan Diego), suggests the future lies in an "audiovisual encyclopedia of human reproduction" he's heard about in Scandinavia, and Alfredo and Carmen are invited, in the interests of science, to shoot the first installment.
Don Carlos arranges a hotel meeting at which Danish porn director Dennis (Thomas Bo Larson) attends -- he claims to have worked with Ingmar Bergman. Other employees of Don Carlos leave the hotel in disgust. However, Alfredo, Carmen and Juan Luis (Fernando Tejero) remain, and the script milks some non-too-subtle but enjoyable comedy from the couple's first, hesitant Super-8 fumblings, despite Alfredo's initial resistance ("I won't let my wife show her parts, not even for the Pope").
The money, and being recognized by a Scandinavian porn buff in a supermarket, rep a kind of success for the couple, but they find themselves drifting apart. As Carmen grows more obsessed with having a baby, Alfredo starts wanting to be the new Bergman, and writes a script, "Torremolinos 73." Pic maintains interest in both strands, with the script, and Pena's perf, making plausible the improbable notion a working-class wife in Franco's Spain would get involved in shooting porn.
Camara makes the blinking, quietly-spoken Alfredo a perfectly conceived character, particularly in his self-deceiving belief his movies are Bergmanesque. Other perfs are up to scratch. The relationship between Carmen and Alfredo comes across well, her affection for him decreasing as it becomes clear he cannot provide the child she wants.
Only quibbles with the generally proficient script are that some of the musical transition sequences are overlong and that the occasional opportunity to maximize dramatic and emotional potential is missed -- as if helmer Berger's fear of lapsing into the poor taste the material invites has been a repressive influence.
Visuals lovingly recreate a long-lost world of polyester, tank tops, flowered wallpaper and far-fetched hairstyles, and the washed-out colors cleverly replicate what TV screenings of period pics look like 30 years on. Bouncy music from Mastretta also captures period feel, but sequences featuring lurid Spanish pop tunes work best. For a film about porn, pic is about as visually discreet as it's possible to be, though there are brief moments of full-frontal nudity.

Its Saul Bass-y credits suggest an Almodóvarian flamboyance, but this impotent '70s-set comedy mostly skimps on discoteca  stylishness. Off his game as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman, Alfredo (Talk to Her  rapist Javier Cámara ) is drafted for an exceedingly odd bit of internal hiring: His boss, in league with a Scandinavian publishing company, needs employees to direct and star in educational movies for a "Danish World Encyclopedia of Reproduction." (These are actually plain-old pornos, but no one quite concedes that point.) Enthused that one of the backers also worked for Bergman, Alfredo happily agrees to film scenes from his own marriage.
Can making money be that easy? For a movie set toward the end of Franco's rule, when Spanish laws were steeped in strict Catholic doctrine, Torremolinos  73  seems strangely nonchalant in its attitude toward porn. Kissing her cross before her first nude scene, Alfredo's wife, Carmen (Candela Peña), otherwise has no trouble getting down to the nitty-gritty. She wants a baby, and this is the perfect way to get her husband to knock her up. As in Boogie Nights , the characters are deluded but innocentAlfredo, who fancies himself a budding auteur, is genuinely surprised to learn that his wife has become a sex symbol up north. There's even a convenient rationalization when a producer requests (mild spoiler alert) that Carmen try on a less schlubby partner. Sexual jealousy has long served as grist for comedy, but director Pablo Berger  is too nice to delay anyone's gratification for very long.
