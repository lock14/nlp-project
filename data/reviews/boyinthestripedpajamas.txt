Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is 8 years old in 1940s Berlin when his daddy (David Thewlis) moves Mama (Vera Farmiga) and the kids closer to work. Small detail: Dad is a Nazi officer who runs a concentration camp. Gaping at a strange nearby ''farm,'' the inquisitive lad befriends a boy on the other side of the barbed wire who is much like Bruno  except, you know, Jewish and slated for extinction. As a Holocaust-for-kids fable, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas  is an appalling, jaw-dropping movie that will cause serious nightmares. D–

 See Bruno (Asa Butterfield). See Bruno run. See Bruno see a farm. See Bruno see “farmers” in “striped pajamas.” See Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). See Shmuel at the farm. See Shmuel run because men are yelling. See Bruno run to his new house. Come home, Bruno, said Mother (Vera Farmiga), in a British accent. Come, Bruno, come. See Bruno and Shmuel meet across an unguarded barbed wire fence. See Bruno and Shmuel laugh, perhaps because there are no soldiers guarding this fence, even though, in John Boyne’s allegorical children’s novel on which this film is based, the farm is Auschwitz. See Bruno, whose blue eyes and dark hair tend to make him look like a Nazi moppet, eat the food he said he would give to Shmuel. See Shmuel look even sadder than usual. See Bruno learn that the farmers are Jews.  See Bruno ponder the kind of false paradoxes that only an authorial contrivance, like the artificial naïf, would face: Jews are supposed to be bad, and yet Shmuel is nice. See Bruno tunnel, with astonishing rapidity, into the camp. See the film’s director, Mark Herman, take his camera into a gas chamber where naked men and children huddle, and two little hands clasp before the film cuts to black. Do not see the blood and excrement on the walls or the dead piled on the floor. See Mother howling outside the camp in the rain as the camera hovers over her. See Father (David Thewlis), realizing that his son has been swept away by the Nazi death machine he himself helps run, look horror-stricken. See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don’t.  “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some mild violence.

John Boyne's almost unfilmable novel about a young German kid's-eye view of the Holocaust gets a solid, ultimately powerful translation to the bigscreen in Brit helmer Mark Herman's "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas." Though the story's p.o.v. is fresh, with a darkly ironic flavor, the film looks to be a tricky commercial proposition, as it's neither a pic for tykes nor a large-scale WWII crowdpleaser. Result is likely to enjoy modest returns among upscale auds and those unaffected by Holocaust-movie burnout.
Boyne's 2006 novel, which deliberately gave no clue about its content on the dust jacket, depends to a large extent on a trick that's impossible to replicate in a movie. Centered on Bruno, the young son of a concentration-camp commander, it's written in a faux-naif style, and from a knowing third-person viewpoint rather than that of the kid himself. 
The peppering of childish observations and nicknames ("Out-With" for Auschwitz, "the Fury" for the Fuehrer) further enhanced the book's theme of a young boy being led by his family into a world he has no understanding of.
Herman's script wisely doesn't try to replicate the book's tricks or its prose style. Instead, it cuts back much of the book's dialogue -- especially in the scenes where Bruno befriends a young Jewish inmate -- in favor of building a child's-eye view of the world. It's also blessed by a marvelous performance by 11-year-old, London-born Asa Butterfield, in his first major role, who perfectly evokes the main character's naivete without ever becoming cute.
Story opens during the early years of WWII in summertime Berlin (adequately repped by Budapest), as the family throws a party to celebrate the promotion of Bruno's dad, Ralf (David Thewlis), to an unnamed job. Eight-year-old Bruno (Butterfield) doesn't want to move "to the countryside," even though he's told it will only be "until the war is won." But apart from his sulk, the atmosphere at the party is relaxed and happy, the only sour note coming from Grandma (Sheila Hancock), who's critical of her son's elevation within the Nazi Party.
Film maintains its vagueness about time and location as the family travels by train through some pretty countryside en route to their destination -- a handsome, neo-Bauhaus home, surrounded by a wall, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Father's "work" is never shown, only referred to obliquely, and the only shadows are cast by worried looks from Bruno'smother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), and Bruno's observation that the local "farmers" in the distance all seem to be wearing "pajamas."
When pressed, Father tells Bruno his work is "for the good of the country" and he's "trying to make the world a better place." To keep Bruno and his elder sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), occupied, he arranges for a stern tutor, Herr Liszt (Jim Norton), to come by.
Opening half-hour has some of the best stuff in the movie, walking a precarious line between black irony and showing the war from a totally German viewpoint, without tipping over into gallows humor or parody. Main plot kicks in when Bruno steals out of the house and goes right up to a wire fence where he meets a boy his age named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), who's also wearing "pajamas."
At this point, the film (like the book) has to reveal its hand. However, as the central conceit can only be maintained in a movie for a much more limited time, the script sensibly pares the novel's over-descriptive dialogue between the two kids.
Use of an almost all-Brit cast -- with Yank Farmiga falling into line with the accents -- gives a comfy, almost "Masterpiece Theater" feel to the movie that's initially unsettling, with thesps' body language and delivery distinctly un-German. That apart, perfs are nicely calibrated; Thewlis is especially good as the businesslike father prone to angry outbursts, Farmiga largely gets by on troubled looks and glances, and Rupert Friend is chillingly cool as a handsome blond lieutenant whom Gretel falls for.
Production values are smooth at all levels, with James Horner's score reserving its biggest punch for the horror-show finale.


During World War II, a Nazi officer (David Thewlis ) receives a promotion and moves his wife (Vera Farmiga ), teenage daughter (Amber Beattie ), and eight-year-old son, Bruno (Asa Butterfield ), to a remote country house. Almost immediately, Bruno spies through his bedroom window a nearby "farm" where the workers wear "striped pajamas." Curious and bored, Bruno sneaks out, makes his way through the woods, and comes upon a barbed-wire fence, behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon ), a pale, thin, clearly starving boy Bruno's age. Bruno begins visiting Shmuel every day, and slowly—very slowly—comes to realize that strange and possibly terrible things are happening on this farm that his father oversees. In adapting Irishman John Boyne's acclaimed young-adult novel, writer-director Mark Herman  (Little Voice ) draws beautifully modulated performances from his two child actors, who navigate a full range of emotions from wonder to betrayal to guilt. In the end, their characters meet a fate so absurdly melodramatic that I cringed. A moment later, it occurred to me that the finale might just devastate—and educate—middle- and high-school-age audiences themselves only a little less naive than Bruno, who could do worse than have this earnest, well-made film be their first Holocaust drama.
