Christopher ''C-dub'' Wang (Jimmy Tsai, who also co-wrote the script), the dork hero of the wan comedy Ping Pong Playa , is a Chinese-American slacker who dreams of basketball glory and get-rich-quick schemes as a way to wriggle out from under the shadow of his older brother, a doctor and Ping-Pong champ. C-dub wants nothing to do with table tennis, even though his dad runs a store devoted to the sport and his mom teaches the game at a local Chinese community center. So, by the standard math of ethnic comedies, C-dub is therefore destined to pick up a paddle against his will, to assemble a pack of misfit kids as his cheering squad, to make some funny mistakes, and ultimately to triumph in competition  and in his integrated self-identity. Somewhere, perhaps, a Nickelodeon cartoon series is waiting to be made.
Until then, interest in Playa  lies in the fact that director Jessica Yu is a documentarian with a daring taste in subjects, from outsider artists (In the Realms of the Unreal ) to extreme personalities (Protagonist ). Yet in her first non-doc feature, she plays it safe; even the championship showdown feels polite.

 A race-based comedy with a mischievous, post-race sensibility, “Ping Pong Playa” mines hip-hop comedy gold from the least gangsta context imaginable: the assimilated Chinese-Americans of suburban California.  As Christopher Wang, the underachieving son of Ping-Pong entrepreneurs, Jimmy Tsai gently but hilariously burlesques hip-hop as a youth culture lingua franca. On the surface this is a matter of swagger and slang (“what up, my ninja?!”), but there’s a deeper, touching acknowledgment of braggadocio as persona, how the commodified dissent of hip-hop lends itself to masking insecurities.  Mr. Tsai wrote the film with the director, Jessica Yu, a filmmaker best known for “In the Realms of the Unreal,” her inventive if overdesigned documentary about the outsider artist Henry Darger. Ms. Yu’s visual flair enlivens the verbal panache of her feature debut; “Ping Pong Playa” is a bright, nimble diversion, a quick-witted picture that’s fast on  its feet.  That comedic pep is a boon, given the formulaic plot, which finds Christopher pressed into filling in for his injured mother at the local community center, teaching Ping-Pong to assorted goofballs, then enlisting them as his “grasshopper” posse when he  enters  a table tennis tournament. En route to the big game come a few of the usual elements  —  a love interest; training montages; silly,  neo-imperialist white dudes   —  and a lot of fresh and funny insights.

It's hard to imagine a more dramatic departure from Jessica Yu's impressive (and Oscar-winning) docu work than "Ping Pong Playa," a good, clean, fun comedy that uses a table tennis championship to crack inside jokes about Los Angeles' Chinese-American community. Based on the trash-talking basketball player invented by Jimmy Tsai to sell his line of Venom sportswear, the pic follows Christopher "C-dub" Wang, an underemployed baller who aspires to the NBA but ends up defending the family's Golden Cock Ping Pong title instead. Sports angle is strictly formulaic, but with careful aim, this pic could achieve overnight cult status among younger auds.
Like a watered-down East Hills Ali G, C-dub "talks like a black person" and over-corrects for his perceived genetic shortcomings, grousing about the shortage of athletic Chinese role models. (Don't be surprised to see choice lines, including the character's cocky "Orient Express" nickname, on T-shirts and bumper stickers for years to come.)
Cultural satire aside, C-dub makes for a rather thin character on which to base an otherwise by-the-numbers underdog comedy, especially considering that his natural Ping Pong prowess actually puts his opponents at a disadvantage.
The Wang family runs the neighborhood's leading coaching facility, although it's their oldest son, Michael (Roger Fan), a successful doctor, whose winning streak keeps the customers coming every year.
By contrast, C-dub is a slacker and all-around disappointment. He wastes his days shooting hoops with kids half his size and getting fired from menial jobs at the local mall. His parents clearly wish he'd be more like Michael, but C-dub resists, until a well-timed traffic accident puts both his brother and mother out of commission.
To keep the family business afloat, the wannabe-gangsta will have to take over his mother's lessons and compete for the trophy himself.
From her "Sour Death Balls" debut, Yu's work has always demonstrated a sensitivity and intelligence that shows through even here, although you have to look a little harder to find it in this "Saturday Night Live"-style comic portrait.
Tsai's C-dub character, who developed a limited following in a series of Web spots, has only a handful of amusing traits, not enough to sustain an entire feature. Despite Tsai's limited on-camera experience, his routine plays as if he's been doing it standup for years.
Yu's approach is unique in that it deconstructs common misconceptions about Chinese-American culture (the white characters quickly chalk up Michael's accident to Asian driving, for example) while replacing them with gentler observations from within (such as Chinese parents taking credit for all the world's key inventions, including Ping Pong). But the helmer's not above relying on stereotypes for the story's other characters, from fat kids to Indian brainiacs to swishy white guys ("Queer as Folk's" Peter Paige plays C-dub's key rival).
Olympic status notwithstanding, it's hard to take table tennis seriously. Yu has fun watching C-dub squirm in his too-tight shorts or imagining the sport's first-ever injury time-out, but the championship game itself goes on too long.
CG balls fill in seamlessly during trickier shots, and the sound of a bouncing basketball covers C-dub's more colorful four-letter expressions -- though additional bleeps may be required, particularly with regard to Chops' irreverent hip-hop soundtrack, to earn a PG-13 rating.

Documentary filmmaker Jessica Yu  takes a breather from chronicling heavy-duty outsider artists (In the Realms of the Unreal ) and extremists (Protagonist ) to try her hand at a popcorn send-up of identity politics you can take the kids to—and it's not half-bad. Burdened with a perfect older brother and marooned in disdain for his ping-pong-obsessed suburban Chinese-American family, Chris "C-Dub" Wang (a character worked up from a sportswear commercial by Ping Pong Playa 's production accountant/co-writer Jimmy Tsai , who also plays him with dumb-ass brio) succumbs to a severe case of homeboy envy, talking ghetto and shooting baskets with little kids while stewing in a dead-end job and blaming his failure to make the NBA on his short stature. Chris is a good, if rather too long-running, joke, and it's fun that Yu and Tsai, who know their Asian-American bourgeoisie through and through, skewer the hypersensitivity of minorities with the same acuity that they take down white condescension. Frantically paced, littered with cute kids, and overstuffed with split screens and a rap score, Ping Pong Playa  angles a little too hard for tween attention, but there's no resisting the movie's antic affability or its irreverence, even with Chris's unavoidable progression toward the mature appreciation of his roots.
