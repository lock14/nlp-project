"Wake up, America!" That�s the fervent call to action in Lions for Lambs
, a well-intentioned and often nervy critique of America�s current complacency during a time of war. Whether anyone will actually listen to the central question the film asks each of us to ponder � What do you stand for? � is open to debate, given that polarized reactions to the film will inevitably overshadow any real discourse on the subject. Those who cynically believe that America is going to hell in a handbasket unless it changes course soon will embrace the film�s message, while the Bill O�Reillys and Ann Coulters of the world will probably foam at the mouth in response to it. In other words, it will be business as usual in these partisan times. Still, Lions for Lambs
 is a fairly bold undertaking, one in which fingers point in more than one direction, and responsibility is shared by all. It�s also a bold film, structurally speaking, in that it�s little more than three interwoven stories in which two characters are simply engaged in a conversation. One such dialogue occurs in the office of an ambitious neoconservative congressman who has invited a skeptical television reporter to discuss the nation�s latest strategy in fighting the war on terror. The second occurs in an office between a college professor and a once-promising student who seems to have lost interest in participating in his own education. The film�s third segment, which tries to serve as a bridge between the other two, primarily takes place on a barren, snowy mountain in Afghanistan, where a faceless enemy is closing in on two injured American soldiers. For a film in which there�s little action in the visceral sense, Lions for Lambs
 can be captivating, especially in the vigorous give-and-take exchange in the senator�s office about the failings of our country�s leadership and the popular press with respect to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For once, Cruise�s controlled acting style � he always appears to be trying too hard � works well in the role of a powerful man doing his best to sell a tough bill of goods, while Streep (as usual) is nothing short of miraculous as the reporter who must acknowledge her own complicity for today�s political state of affairs. The other two segments are less captivating (though never boring), largely because the logic in their plotlines doesn�t always hang together very well. Despite its flaws, which become more evident as time elapses, Lions for Lambs
 is worth seeing for no other reason than you�ve never seen anything like it before. It�s political theatre that shouldn�t be missed.


It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that's what "Lions for Lambs" does. The guiding topic is America's current wartime engagements, and like similar movies it operates with a literal mind and wagging finger. When the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan started, I was naively eager that Hollywood would find ways to dramatize the conflicts' political complexities and personal toll. We're probably too close to get any real artistic perspective. The great movies about Vietnam either were not about the war or were made once it was over.
This time around, documentary filmmakers have beaten the major movie studios to the punch with hastily made, mostly left-leaning rants and mini-exposés that about 35 people have seen. In principle, Hollywood had time, distance, and money on its side to process the many tentacles of this imbroglio into compelling entertainment. Instead, for the most part, we're getting handsome-looking fictional versions of the docu-rants. "Lions for Lambs" is the gassiest yet.
Directed by Redford and written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, the story is divided into three sections that are shuffled into a movie. And as is the current narrative vogue for Important Movies, each part will have some higher bearing on the others. In one, Cruise plays a hawkish Republican senator who wants to start a new war, one rigged for victory, and Streep is the seasoned cable-news journalist he's summoned to announce it. In another, two young injured American soldiers, played by Derek Luke and Michael Peña, are trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. And in the third, Redford plays a professor at "a California university."
The professor's most promising student, Todd, has taken a nosedive. So he's invited Todd to possibly the earliest ever office hours for a talking-to. The kick-off to the professor's anti-apathy harangue is unpromising: "Let me tell you about the last two kids who gave me hope." The actor playing him, Andrew Garfield, is suitably disengaged, as good as Streep with the PowerPoint dialogue, and a willing punching bag for the movie's jabs and low blows. But it might have been cheaper and more aptly symbolic for Redford to have replaced him with a cardboard cutout that said, "America's Youth." Of course, then another piece of symbolism would be lost: Redford appears to be trying to save a young, blasé version of himself.
The politics in Carnahan's script - he's the writer of the "FBI demolishes Saudi Arabia" action-thriller "The Kingdom" - are flung at the screen. Some of them stick. Some of them don't. He's got more beefs - the wars, the politicians who manufacture them, the media's pandering, complacent college kids not out rioting and protesting - than any bun can hold. There is also bogusness meant to be shaming. Those two stranded soldiers are our sacrificial lambs - one's from Compton, the other from East LA (his name is Ernest). And they're the holiest two in the movie, a pair for guilty liberals to think about while they push their carts down the Whole Foods aisle. A good movie lives in here somewhere, but after about 20 minutes, you realize, despite the good lighting, syrupy music, and Hollywood stars, Redford doesn't care whether it's good. He just wants it to say something relevant. This is a movie that likes the sound of its own voice.
The Cruise-Streep parts of the film actually work because there is push and pull, intelligent acting (Cruise does his shark thing well), and a nod to complexity. Redford uses staging that suggests real characters, not just positions. Cruise is often literally looking down on Streep, who, in turn, is forced to look up. Redford even chooses to have Cruise photographed from his folded arms up - he looks like a bust awaiting bronze. The debate in the senator's office is charged. Ideologically, somebody has to lose, and the loser wins a well-acted crisis. For a parched audience, this seems rather juicy. It's a tiny dramatic oasis.
Redford has previously found ways of channeling liberal righteousness into superior Hollywood entertainment. His 1994 television-corruption essay "Quiz Show" still rumbles defiantly. "Lions for Lambs," though, is less a movie than a series of lectures - the senator lectures the newswoman; the professor lectures the student; those two kids who gave Redford hope lecture their classmates; over at Bagram Air Base, Peter Berg, the director of "The Kingdom," plays a lieutenant colonel lecturing his troops. For good measure, Redford and his editor toss in close-ups of people, especially Streep, scribbling down notes. Several of the movies he's made have their chalkboard moments. This is the first to come with a set of fingernails.


Liberal message movies tend to follow the Mary Poppins principle: Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. The sugar is suspense, mystery, romance  the sweeteners Hollywood sprinkles over Important Issues like corporate duplicity or blood diamonds to render them palatable. Lions for Lambs  is different. It's all  medicine, and doesn't try to hide the fact. It doesn't pretend to be a thriller or a love story or a vehicle for George Clooney's five-o'clock-shadow heroism. Directed by Robert Redford and written by the gifted topical button pusher Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom ), the movie consists mostly of people sitting around rooms, usually two at a time, debating the conflict in Afghanistan, the quagmire of Iraq, the arrogance (or is it stay-the-course courage?) of war-on-terror politicians, the superficiality (or is it muzzling?) of the press, and the complacency of everyone else.
Are we having fun yet? Lions for Lambs  may be the first movie that feels as if it should have a credit that reads, ''Based on an episode of The Charlie Rose Show .'' The tiny scale and armchair talkiness mark the movie as a bit of a folly, an act of idealistic hubris in today's commercial marketplace, yet that's its (minor) fascination too.
It hops among three segments. In Washington, D.C., Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise), a smooth young right-wing senator, is being interviewed by Janine Roth (Meryl Streep), a TV reporter. Irving has summoned the journalist, who once wrote a TIME cover story heralding his rise to power, to announce a U.S. military surge in the war in Afghanistan. But the interview turns into a debate, as the reporter picks apart the administration's euphemisms and the senator parrots the Bush-Cheney line  with more eloquence, it must be said, than Bush musters. Cruise, in his cocksure-logician mode, doesn't condescend; he gives the neocon rhetoric its due. But it's Streep, braiding hesitancy and aggression, who wins the acting contest, and the reporter who trumps the senator's arguments  even if he then trumps her back, nailing the press' hypocrisy, its urge to duck any blame for first supporting the Iraq invasion.
Meanwhile, in California, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield), a cynical college student, conferences with his poli-sci professor (Redford), who wants to know why the once-avid scholar has been skipping his class. Redford plays it like a master shrink, coaxing the kid's vulnerabilities out from behind a wised-up veneer. Their debate might be called ''Why Try to Change a World That's Too Corrupt to Change?'' All of which leads to the third segment, in which two soldiers (Michael Peña and Derek Luke)  both former students of Redford's prof  board a chopper in Afghanistan, as part of the surge Cruise's senator was selling.
Lions for Lambs  is so square it's like something out of the gray twilight glow of the golden age of television. Even the military plot, which clunks, seems to be taking place on stage. Yet Carnahan's writing ignites familiar issues with vigor and snap; there's audacity in its attempt to seize us with nothing but a war of rhetoric. Maybe Lions for Lambs  wouldn't seem like such a folly in a movie culture that risked making more follies like it.


 Career Politicians, the Fourth Estate and Disaffected Youth all earn a stern knuckle rapping in “Lions for Lambs,” Robert Redford’s big-screen lecture about civic responsibility and its absence in the Age of Iraq. Those who remain shocked, shocked that elected officials, certain journalists and cosseted college students sat idly by, huffing Hummer fumes and nodding out on 24/7 infotainment (all Britney, all the time), while the administration led the charge, first into Afghanistan and then into Iraq, may find much to embrace here. Everyone else will continue to nod out or resume banging their heads against the wall in bloody frustration.  I suppose there’s something commendable about Mr. Redford fighting the good fight, or at least one civilized version of it. Movie critics often flog directors for not engaging with urgent contemporary matters, like the current wars, but when they do engage, as several have tried to this year (“In the Valley of Elah,” “Rendition”), we complain that they’re not saying much of anything. Consider “Lions for Lambs” exhibit R  in this open case: It names the wars, presents a handful of fictionalized main players from politicians to soldiers, and drops words like “the people” and “Al Qaeda” and “propaganda.” It flashes photographs of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice, if without overtly naming names.  What else do we learn from “Lions for Lambs”? That America is no longer only the land of the free, home of the brave, but also of the opportunistic and the compromised. Among the most conniving, or most true-believing of these new Americans are politicians like Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise), a Republican senator with his eye on the White House. Among the most compromised among us, or the most exhausted, or timorous — or something — are journalists like Janine Roth (Meryl Streep), whom Irving has summoned to his office so he can pitch her a shiny new war plan. Mistakes were made, he says, but that was then, this is now. From their framed photographs, President Bush, Mr. Cheney and Ms. Rice silently keep watch.  Nothing if not on party message, the senator has taken aim at Iran, which, he tells Roth, is allowing Iraqi terrorists to cross its borders on their way to Afghanistan, where they will fight alongside Al Qaeda. As Roth leans forward, you can almost see the thought bubble above her: Howzthatagain? But Roth is also vain; she’s a journalist, after all, and rubbing shoulders, and who knows what else, with movers and shakers has blunted her senses, clouded her vision. Power is an aphrodisiac, as well as addictive. And power begets power, as Mr. Redford reminds us when he shows Roth looking at a Time magazine cover story she wrote about Irving. She helped make the senator and he did much the same for her in turn.  It’s fun to watch this acting odd couple spar even in such a visually inert context. Mr. Cruise pours on his characteristic intensity and lights up the board with alternating flashes of charm, sincerity, gravity, indignation and outrage. Every mood feels phony, a total put-on, which works well for a character delivering a self-conscious, constructed performance. As his audience of one, Ms. Streep’s journalist must do a lot of listening, which the actress does with one of her vibrant, entertaining, gestural performances. Every twitch, blink, shrug, head bob and seat shift speaks softly at first and then with increasing volume, giving physical form to the inner voice we actually hear only later. Mr. Redford’s camera pays her close, appreciative heed, as do we.  Alas, there’s more — namely two other story threads, the dreariest of which involves yet another two speakers locked in one claustrophobic space: a history professor, Dr. Stephen Malley (Mr. Redford), who has summoned an apathetic student, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield), into his office for a metaphoric spanking. One of those bright young things who puts the “i” in Generation iPod, Todd has been dodging Malley’s class, opting to turn off and tune out even while agreeing to drop in for morning coffee. It’s not nearly as much fun to watch these two, largely because the screenwriter, Matthew Michael Carnahan, has stacked the deck so much in Malley’s favor you know the end of the conversation as soon as it gets going.  It’s a long conversation, more soporific than Socratic, and brimming with parental chiding, generational conflict and invocations of Vietnam. You see, back in the day, Malley fought in that war after being drafted. He didn’t want to fight, didn’t agree with its aims, but he did nonetheless, which leads to another story fragment and two more of his students: a Latino, Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Peña), and an African-American, Arian Finch (Derek Luke). After absorbing Malley’s lessons about responsibility, Ernest and Arian joined the army. These lion cubs don’t believe the current wars are righteous, but they believe they can effect change from the inside, which is how they land in an Afghan misadventure more unbelievable, both in thematic and visual terms, than Senator Irving’s military strategy.  In truth Ernest and Arian are less lions than sacrificial lambs that exist solely so the film can wave the flag (and race and poverty) along with index fingers. Malley regrets but respects the students’ decision to enlist, which echoes the prevailing wisdom that you should support the troops even if you don’t support the wars. The problem isn’t whether this assertion is true; the problem is the film reflexively embraces it, much as it does every single other cliché, without inquiry, challenge or a single ounce of real risk. It tells us everything most of us know already, including the fact that politicians lie, journalists fail and youth flounders. Mostly it tells us that Mr. Redford feels really bad about the state of things. Welcome to the club.  “Lions for Lambs” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some bloody combat scenes, gun violence and tough language.

Talky, back-bendingly liberal but also deeply patriotic, "Lions for Lambs" plays like all the serious footnotes scripter du jour Matthew Michael Carnahan left out of "The Kingdom." Robert Redford's first helming chore in seven years, and his most directly political pic yet, amounts to a giant cry of "Americans, get engaged!" wrapped in a star-heavy discourse that uses a lot of words to say nothing new. Apart from the curio value of Redford, Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise headlining the movie equivalent of an Off Broadway play, this first outing by newly resurgent UA doesn't look likely to roar its way to significant B.O. gains.
Schematic idea sounds bold on paper: three separate events, played out roughly in real screen time across three separate timezones, with each potentially cross-fertilizing the others. Problem is, as the cross-cutting proceeds, it becomes increasingly evident that each yarn exists in its own, very specific frame of reference, with no real human drama to buttress the moral-political conflict.
In Washington, D.C., veteran TV journo Janine Roth (Streep) arrives for a one-on-one interview with Republican young gun Sen. Jasper Irving (Cruise), who has an exclusive to feed her for his own purposes. Meanwhile, earlier that same morning at "a California university," Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield), a student who's been skipping class, gets dressed down by his professor, Dr. Stephen Malley (Redford). Concurrently, a small force of U.S. soldiers is airlifted to a strategic mountainous location in the Afghan mountains to head off the Taliban.
In the early stages, the three strands are cleverly linked. Irving tells Roth the administration has a "new plan" to resolve the deadlock in Afghanistan: sending small groups to secure advance positions ahead of the spring thaw. When Roth asks when this will be implemented, Irving replies, "Ten minutes ago."
Two of the grunts in the first group, Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke), are former students of Malley's. To try to break through Hayes' lackadaisical attitude toward his studies and life in general, Malley tells Hayes the story of Rodriguez and Finch, both of whom enlisted in the military as a way to engage in their country's foreign problems rather than just sit back and take the high ground.
In addressing the issue of the U.S. role as both world policeman and a credible force for good, Carnahan's screenplay thus takes three clearly defined avenues of approach: the practical (Rodriguez-Finch), the political (Irving-Roth) and the philosophical (Malley-Hayes). All three avenues, however, lead nowhere in particular. The first moves from the gung-ho through military bungling to personal, useless sacrifice; the second through point-by-point confrontation to ultimate resignation; and the third ends vaguely, with only a glimmer of hope.
Most engrossing moments are generated by the political tennis match between the young senator and the cynical reporter. Both thesps are perfectly cast and at the top of their game, with Cruise believably incarnating a Young Turk who believes America's credibility (as "a force of righteousness") is now at stake, while Streep's veteran journo is more interested in digging up past mistakes and Middle Eastern history.
The to-and-fro of their political debate gives both actors a fine workout, and plays to the strengths of their screen personas. But as Carnahan's script dutifully checks off the issues, it becomes clear the discourse is leading nowhere, and is merely a rerun of arguments already extensively aired by media around the world. Roth has no new arguments to propose, and Irving's only solution is more positive action.
Meanwhile, back in California, the talk is turning even fuzzier. Faced with Hayes' continuing skepticism-cum-lack of interest in his country's politics, Malley finally rounds on him with, "Rome is burning." "So you're saying it's better to try and fail than do nothing?" asks Hayes. "At least you (can say you) did something," replies Malley. Well, yeah.
With almost no character backgrounding beyond repping various schools of thought, the actors largely get by on screen charisma. Cruise and Streep generate the most sparks; Redford brings a relaxed, slightly supercilious, elder-statesman aura to the role of the mature academic; and young Brit actor Garfield is convincing as an unengaged SoCal student, though his character remains enigmatic to the end.
Production values are fine. Philippe Rousselot's widescreen lensing and Jan Roelfs' production design manage distinctive looks for the three strands, from the burnished, formal interiors of Irving's office and the sunnier, relaxed campus quarters to the grit and snow of an Afghan mountaintop. Mark Isham's score is low-key until the muddled finale of the military strand, when it slips into unseemly (and inexplicable) patriotic bombast.
As if to underline the symbiotic link between Carnahan's two scripts, "The Kingdom" helmer Peter Berg pops up here in a supporting role.

Less a war drama than a set of dueling position papers, Robert Redford 's Lions for Lambs  may be the gabbiest movie ever made about American foreign policyand it wasn't even written by Aaron Sorkin . Hot young screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan  is fresh off his alpha-male script forThe Kingdom , which would explain the presence early on of that movie's director, Peter Berg , striding around Afghanistan  in a buzz cut and stiff upper lip, barking bytes from Von Clausewitz  and imploring his noticeably minority foot soldiers to show the enemy "the full measure of American mean." Compared to facing the meanie back home in Washingtona Republican hardbody played by Tom Cruise  in crisp white shirt, sparkly molars, and oodles of blind ambitionthe war zone Over There is peanuts.
We find the senator in his office, hectoring a tough old broad of a journalist in comfy '60s-liberal tweeds (Meryl Streep ) about the need for a surge to end all surges in the Middle East. She lectures him right back on the folly of United States warmongering, and to drive the point home, we head west to "a California university," where a world-weary professor and Vietnam  vet (Redford) cuts a deal that only a celluloid academic could make without losing his job: He promises straight B's to a disaffected failing student (Andrew Garfield ) on the condition that he cast sloth aside to become all that he can be against the war.
For a movie so relentlessly bent on realism, Lions for Lambs  is riddled with implausibilities. Would a rising young Republican with an acquisitive eye on the presidency choose a liberal reporter with the stubborn intractability of a Christiane Amanpour  to push his latest war on terror? Are today's college youth really as politically lethargic as this privileged white boy? Would his star classmates, an African-American (Derek Luke ) and a Latino (Michael Peña ), having boot-strapped themselves out of East L.A., chuck it all away and blithely join the Army in order to become the movie's conscience?
Known for making stately, linear films with lovely sunsets, Redford has none of the piss and vinegar, the technical bravura, or the hip irony of younger directors making political films, like Stephen Gaghan  or Paul Greengrass . His editing is artless, the action scenes listless, the characters almost entirely representational of the political attitudes they strike. Researched, data-crunched and op-eded to the hilt, Lions for Lambs  talks and talks and TALKS your head off as it lumbers toward complete coverage of the state of our nation.
What can I tell you? The movie is awfuland also oddly touching, even adorable in its dogged sense of responsibility, its stubborn refusal of style. There's something refreshing about a movie as earnest and well-briefed as this one. Redford is no intellectual, but I found myself unaccountably charmed by his lack of cynicism, his old-fangled desire to plead the case of ordinary people caught up in the reckless aggression of the powerful.
