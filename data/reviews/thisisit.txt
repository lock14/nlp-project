Michael Jackson always said that he wished he could live on stage, and in Michael Jackson's This Is It , there isn't a moment when he looks less than comfortably and pleasurably at home there. On the vast, half-empty, often darkened proscenium of the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where we see him in bare-bones videotaped rehearsals for the 50 London concerts that he never lived to perform, Jackson moves lightly and easily, with his herky-jerky demon-marionette grace. On the rare occasions when he's not focused on dance moves and has nothing to do but sing, as in a soaring interlude of ''Human Nature'' or a version of ''I Want You Back'' that he tosses off with affection for his child-superstar pluck, the music pours out of him like sunlight.
This Is It  is not  in any way ghoulish. It has now been established that when Jackson died, he was, physically speaking, a relatively healthy man. And so we're spared the macabre spectacle of combing the movie for any literal signs that he was knocking at death's door. It should also be said, though, that in This Is It , Jackson shows no telltale signs of a broken spirit, either. From the moment he takes the stage, he's loose, robust, and in control. Maybe a little too in control. In the relative privacy of these rehearsal sessions, which took place from March of this year until his death on June 25, Jackson comes off as his friends have often described him  as a gentle, sweet, but very shrewd soul who was also a painful perfectionist. Coaching his keyboardist and musical director, Michael Bearden, on how to play ''The Way You Make Me Feel'' with the exact right syncopated pull, Jackson says that he wants the song to sound ''like you're dragging yourself out of bed,'' but Bearden can't seem to get it. Though they banter a bit about the word ''booty,'' we get a hint of what a frosty taskmaster Jackson could be. When he's displeased, it stings.
As the last set of images we'll ever have of Michael Jackson, This Is It  offers a raw and endearing sketch of a genius at work. The movie was directed, by Kenny Ortega, with enough liveliness to make up for its home-movie scruffiness, and I had a good time reveling in what amounts to a soft-edged vérité scrapbook for Michael-maniacs. By the end, though, This Is It  feels like the half-complete experience that it is  a mere diagram of the excitement that Michael, for his comeback, had planned to unleash upon the world.
It's clear from the movie that the London concerts were conceived as a very grand series of onstage music videos, each with a huge, intricate set that at times involved digital projections, and each choreographed as a disco-inferno Broadway showstopper. (''Thriller,'' one of the few songs we watch as it was meant to be, had a full earth-packed graveyard.) The dancers were going to pop out from beneath the stage and crawl over skyscrapers, as Michael shimmied and boogied and got lifted into the air. Watching this without most of the sets, with the gears and pulleys still showing, and from two functional camera angles in front of the stage, we get the flavor of the songs but not the majesty.
And that's not just due to the lack of trappings. Jackson, it's clear, held back in rehearsal. In This Is It , he's singing and dancing, but he's also watching himself sing and dance, stepping out of his performance. What's missing  what the film gives you only a tantalizing glimpse of  is his ferocity. When he does a tamped-down version of his solo whirligig in ''Billie Jean,'' playing air guitar on his crotch (a gesture that elicits a round of cheers from the dancers in the Staples Center), you feel him sketching in the heat without quite committing himself. ''At least we get a feel of it,'' he says.
This Is It  is fun, but it's a slightly airless experience. If the movie allows you to bask in Michael Jackson's aura, it also uses his image to foster ''nostalgia'' for a concert epiphany that never quite was. Maybe it was Michael's destiny to leave us all wanting more. Would those concerts have returned him to his magical pedestal? We'll never know the answer, of course. But watching this movie, at least we get a feel of it.



Had Michael Jackson�s series of concerts at London�s O2 Arena gone off as planned earlier this summer, it would have almost certainly signaled one of the most dramatic comebacks in pop music history. The rehearsal footage on display in �Michael Jackson�s This Is It� is certainly evidence enough to draw that conclusion, providing a solid basis to imagine the final product while also giving a heretofore unseen glimpse of the star�s creative process -- and the latter is both the film�s greatest strength and its most troubling element. Worldwide box office should be monstrous for the Sony release, which grossed $2.2 million domestically from Tuesday night shows.
Despite the grotesque and unceasing curiosity over Jackson�s private life, his working procedure was scarcely documented, and his intense perfectionism is breathtaking to see here. He corrects his dancers while in the midst of striking poses himself, pores over video footage and auditions, works out with a vocal coach and gives his band instructions that are alternately brilliant (�Play it like you�re dragging yourself out of bed�) and Kafka-esque in their impenetrability. 
(After a fascinating exchange with keyboardist and musical director Michael Bearden over an almost imperceptibly subtle tempo change on �The Way You Make Me Feel,� Bearden delicately notes that he can�t always predict how Jackson will want certain songs to sound. Jackson snaps back, �I want it like I wrote it.�) 
Yet there�s likely a reason that so little of this side of Jackson was ever seen previously; the more one observes his anxiety-riddled drive to present a flawless performance, the more obvious it seems that he would never have wanted audiences to see the performance in such a rough state. Debating a deceased artist�s wishes is always sketchy territory, however, and �This Is It� is a classy film that only affirms the man�s talent. Yet one can�t help but worry that, rather than a bittersweet farewell, the film will merely serve as the opening salvo to a flood of posthumous releases and merchandising that will make Tupac Shakur�s estate seem a paragon of restraint.
But avant le deluge
, there�s an incredible amount to enjoy here, and the star�s fans will be in rapture. Though Jackson looks painfully thin at times, his vocal prowess and dancing ability seem to have scarcely ebbed at all in the decade he spent offstage. His singing during �Human Nature� is strong and emotive, his dancing during an extended �Billie Jean� sublime. (�At least we got a feel for it,� he demurs immediately after the latter, and the comment reads more like genuine misplaced self-consciousness than the typical feigned humility of a pop star.)
Director Kenny Ortega�s ultimate vision for the show is fleshed out further with glimpses of interstitial video -- the intro to �Smooth Criminal,� which splices a fedora�d Jackson onto vintage footage of Rita Hayworth and Edward G. Robinson, is particularly inspired -- and computer simulations of staging concepts that never made it to fruition. (These completed sketches are never shown in their entirety, however, and it�s not unreasonable to imagine that they�ll be the hook for the inevitable deluxe-edition DVD.) 
Video and audio quality are of a much higher caliber than the phrase �rehearsal footage� might suggest, although occasionally the filmmakers are forced to cobble together subpar bits and pieces (most notably on �Thriller�). Conversely, the edits of �Beat It� and �Black or White� presented here could practically be released as is and still blow most contemporary pop videos out of the water. 
The sole moment when the singer seems irritable or disengaged from the proceedings occurs during a mini-set of three Jackson 5 tunes; the timing of his agitation seems psychologically revealing at first, though it later turns out to be due to monitor malfunction. Indeed, one rarely forgets that these are rehearsals, and at times Jackson visibly holds back, protesting about the need to save his voice for his upcoming performances -- one of several instances in which  knowledge of the man�s imminent death overshadows the joy of watching him perform. 
Members of the band, crew and dance troupe appear on camera between songs to gush (often while tearing up) about the honor of appearing with Jackson. While it�s hard to doubt their sincerity, it all seems a bit creepy when one remembers that this footage was originally intended for Jackson�s personal use. 
�This Is It� is assembled with great care, belying its impromptu nature, and editors Don Brochu, Brandon Key, Tim Patterson and Kevin Stitt have done excellent work to pull together a coherent film from endless footage. Even at nearly two hours, the film still feels too short.
