         The day, in 1959, after a pair of drifters broke into the home of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kan., and shot all four of its members after failing to find the $10,000 they believed to be stashed there, Truman Capote clipped an item about the murders in the New York Times and immediately called William Shawn at the New Yorker.
 
  That night, the flamboyant author of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and popular man-about-Manhattan boarded a train to Kansas with his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee with the intention of writing a magazine piece on how the murders had affected the quiet farming community. Six years later, he published "In Cold Blood," a "nonfiction novel" that made him the most famous writer in America, a millionaire, and ruined his life.
 


         






    Bennett Miller's "Capote," which was written by Dan Futterman and stars Philip Seymour Hoffman (both childhood friends of the director), carefully re-creates the agonizing stretch of years between Capote's first trip to Holcomb and the spectacular success of his book six years later. Arriving on the heels of the execution by hanging of Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, the book was hailed for its objectivity and steady-handed sang-froid. But Capote's own experience of the story was harrowing and deeply personal. What began as an investigation of "two Americas" — one quiet and conservative, the other rootless and violent — evolved, by all accounts, into a chillingly intimate portrait of the killers, in whose lives the writer would eventually play a not-insignificant role.
 
  As the story of an artist whose greatest success brought about his downfall, "Capote" would seem at first to fall within the parameters of the traditional Hollywood biopic. And certainly, Capote's Southern Gothic childhood (neglected by a restless, alcoholic mother, sent to live with relatives at a young age) would have made for convenient peg-the-root-of-the-pathology flashbacks, à la "Ray," "Beyond the Sea" and others. But Miller and Futterman (who based his screenplay on the biography by Gerald Clarke) avoid the pitfalls of the genre by refusing to mythologize the artist, plunging instead into the soul of the man. Where it might have perfunctorily mounted him on the "troubled genius" mantle, the movie dispenses with the usual supersaturated (it's all still so vivid!) flashbacks to childhood traumas, reconstructing instead a world as gorgeously stark, clear and straightforward as that of the book — and of the flat, unforgiving Kansas landscape, with its dearth of places to hide.
 
  But it doesn't condemn him for his blinkered self-striving, either. (Capote seemed to have done a good job of that himself.) Instead, the film exhumes a figure obscured by notoriety and legend to discover a fiercely ambitious, deeply lonely narcissist whose fractured personality accommodated many, often contradictory, roles and whose greatest asset turned out to be his greatest liability.
 
  In the film's view, Capote's fluid, adaptive morality, which could be described as postmodern, pegs him as a pioneer and harbinger for the cult of success-at-any-cost that would soon become the norm in America. And Miller and Futterman have captured an era on the verge of change by bringing into focus a man who not only helped to change it but also embodied its contradictions. In the hands of talented production designer Jess Gonchor and cinematographer Adam Kimmel, the movie shifts subtly from something out of an Andrew Wyeth painting — shades of brown, blue and white against a slate-gray sky — to something more ominous: a 16th century Dutch painting, the characters' pale skin and grim expressions glowing against deep black backgrounds.
 
  But much of the credit for the richness of the portrayal goes to Hoffman, whose nuanced and insightful portrait of Capote — a man whose fey mannerisms and high, lilting voice could have easily led an actor into camp — is as empathetic as it is brutally honest. Hoffman captures what is presented as an astonishing capacity for insinuation and connects it to a deep personal understanding of the basic human need for connection. When, in the film, Capote speaks of his unhappy past, it's usually with the aim of gaining a trust he can't help — like the scorpion on the frog's back — but exploit.
 
  As recounted in the film, Capote first fixes his sights on Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) during a hearing. The killer seems strangely removed from the proceedings and passes the time drawing. The next day, Capote shows up at the sheriff's residence in Holcomb, where Smith is being held in a "women's cell" in the kitchen. Capote is fascinated by Smith, a sensitive monster with an artistic temperament, given to dreaming about public recognition. While Hickock seems to relish the attention Capote brings them and sees him as a possible path to freedom, Smith instantly sees through their surface dissimilarities and recognizes a kindred spirit who recognizes him right back.
 
  Capote's identification with Smith — of whom he says, "I feel like we grew up in the same house, and one day he stood up and walked out the back door, and I walked out the front" — is presented as sincere. But so, in another context, is his merciless cruelty and self-absorption. Scenes of cell-bound exchanges between the writer and the murderer crash against scenes of Capote viperishly delighting literary types at cocktail parties by mocking him. In one sequence, he charms Nancy Clutter's best friend, Laura Kinney (Allie Mikelson), into opening up to him by appealing to her teenager's sense of alienation. "It's hard when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. Ever since I was a child, people thought they had me pegged because of the way I am, the way I talk.... They were always wrong."
 
  Seated next to him, Lee (Catherine Keener) subtly rolls her eyes. She is Capote's (unheeded) sense of shame, and the film's conscience, reminding him in vain of his precarious ethical position each time he uses his awed, trusting Kansans as fodder for cocktail party banter or complains that the killers' are "torturing" him with their endless appeals, making it impossible for him to finish his book. The message is clear: Capote's involvement in the case is as problematic as his great idea: The "nonfiction novel" is more than a literary hot potato. It's a dubious moral proposition.
 
  At one point, Smith asks if he knows Elizabeth Taylor, and the writer replies, "I know a lot of people." But who, really, are his friends? Or, more to the point, whom is he a friend to? Hickock and Smith continue to count him as one even as evidence mounts that his primary interest in them is as a much-needed sensational conclusion to his masterpiece. He's also as impervious to the needs of Lee and of his lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), as he is dependent on their care and support. Both writers, the former much more celebrated than the latter (Lee won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel "To Kill a Mockingbird," in which the character of Dill was based on Capote), Lee and Dunphy subsume their personalities to Truman's and form a tacit bond to counter their growing sense of bewilderment.
 
  The sometimes amused, often appalled view of Capote that Lee, Dunphy and Shawn (Bob Balaban, looking quietly unsettled) share echoes a feeling throughout the film that what is happening is bigger than Capote and the book. It's a feeling of vague, bottomed-out dread as old New York gives way to new New York; fiction gives way to nonfiction; literature gives way to the tell-all; esteem gives way to stardom. Keener is particularly good at playing the loyal second-fiddle to Capote's flashy orchestra conductor, and she provides the perfect counterpoint to his new brand of literary celebrity — the modest, respected writer taking one last bow before the celebrity author walks onstage. Even in a tailored camel-hair coat and simple wool scarf (from Bergdorf's), Capote looks like an exotic bird among the men in dark suits and fedoras that surround him. He also looks eminently contemporary. Ultimately, Capote was not only among the first celebrity writers to hobnob with movie stars in the pages of glossy magazines, he also experienced the public demise and personal dissipation that we now gleefully extract as the price of fame. His goal was to invent a "new way of writing." In the process, he invented a new way of being an author.

In the bleak early winter of 1959, Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), seated in a Kansas farmhouse, gazes sadly through his horn-rims, explaining to the woman he's interviewing why people have always underestimated him. They see ''the way I am, the way I talk,'' he says; often, they see little else. Capote, the Southern-bred literary star, boozer, and gossip queen, has journeyed to Holcomb, Kan., to do a story for The New Yorker about the murder of the Clutters, a modest farm family slaughtered in their home, without apparent motive, one horrible random night. He senses that the crime, its gruesomeness bursting the facade of ''normal'' America, has the makings of a drama as potent as any fiction. He is about to spend six tormented years of obsession tearing his soul apart to write the revolutionary true-crime masterpiece In Cold Blood .
In Capote , the rapt, absorbing, and thrillingly perceptive biographical drama written by Dan Futterman and directed by Bennett Miller, we can see why folks underestimate Capote. Disarming expectations is the key to his method. As a personality, he exudes the fey mock exhaustion of a blasé munchkin, and that makes him easy to dismiss. His voice is a whine that turns into a moan that crests with a sigh topped with a baby's gurgle. He sounds like Carol Channing on quaaludes. Hoffman, in his sublime, must-see feat of a performance, plays that famous foppish lilt like a hypnotist's instrument, getting you to forget, in 30 seconds, that you're seeing an impersonation. He makes Capote a mesmerizing raconteur who gets people to trust him by nudging his fragility and genius into the center of every encounter.
Capote, assisted by his friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), knows how to use his celebrity to gain access to a community's secrets. He makes an ally out of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the stern Kansas Bureau of Investigation official, and once the killers, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), have been captured, tried, convicted, and given the death sentence, he bribes the prison warden to gain access to Perry, who will become the key figure in his story: his portrait of America's hidden, violent heart.
The bond between Capote and the moody, sensitive Perry is the core of Capote . Visiting Perry behind bars, the author becomes his confidant, confessor, psychiatrist, and friend; he even takes on the role, in spirit, of doting lover. His identification with Perry is an honest one: He grew up as such an outsider himself that he looks at this killer and sees a kindred soul. Yet Capote's ruthlessness is there in the way he exploits the friendship in the guise of perpetuating it. He arranges for lawyers to win a stay of execution, all because he needs to get the goods from Perry, only to abandon the case when it becomes convenient for the killers to die. His ''method'' works, yet it eats away at him, allowing him to create a seminal book and destroy himself in the process. Hoffman makes Capote's dissolution a theatrical miracle of devastation. In his final scene with Perry, he's so conflicted that he does something I've never seen on screen: He cries, honestly, and lies at the same time.
Capote  has one nagging flaw. Clifton Collins Jr. plays Perry (strikingly) as a kind of sociopathic James Dean, yet he never quite musters the rage of a killer; he lacks the twitches of self-loathing that Perry had in the book, and in Robert Blake's portrayal in the 1967 film adaptation of In Cold Blood . That said, Capote  honors its subject by doing just what Truman Capote did. It teases, fascinates, and haunts.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Picture; Best Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman); Best Supporting Actress (Catherine Keener); Best Director (Bennett Miller); Best Adapted Screenplay (Dan Futterman)

 In 1959, a newspaper article about the murder of the Clutter family in the tiny town of Holcomb, Kan., caught the eye of the novelist Truman Capote. He spent most of the next half-dozen years following the case, which ended with the execution of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith and the subsequent publication of "In Cold Blood," Capote's best-selling mutation of the true crime potboiler into bona fide literature.  Bennett Miller's "Capote," which will be shown tonight and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival before opening commercially on Friday, is a fascinating and fine-grained reconstruction of that period in its subject's life, a time when he pursued literary glory and flirted with moral ruin. "This is the beginning of a great love affair - between Truman and himself," someone says, but the film suggests that Capote's obsession with the Clutter murders, and his drive to alchemize their ugly pointlessness into deathless prose, might better be described as a Faustian bargain.  In any case, "Capote" is, principally, the story of a writer's vexed, all-consuming relationship with his work, and therefore with himself. This makes for better drama than you might expect. Capote's human connections are, for the most part, secondary and instrumental, which makes Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance all the more remarkable, since he must connect with the audience without piercing the membrane of his character's narcissism. Not only does Mr. Hoffman achieve an impressive physical and vocal transformation - mimicking Capote's chirpy drawl and appearing to shrink to his elfin stature - but he also conveys, with clarity and subtlety, the complexities of Capote's temperament.  "It appears that with his curious voice, his ways, he decided to brazen it out, to be himself with an ornamental courage and an impressive conceit," Elizabeth Hardwick once wrote, and Mr. Hoffman bears out her insight. There is neediness and vulnerability to Mr. Hoffman's Capote, but his dominant traits are guile, vanity and the self-confident toughness of the outsider.  A gay man in the era of Kennedy/Rat Pack machismo, a Southerner in New York, a New Yorker in Kansas, he walks into every new situation sure of who he is and sure that he will soon prove himself to be, once again, the most interesting person in the room. His whispery, stuttering self-presentation serves as a feint, deflecting notice from his essential steeliness. Prefiguring the talk show and tabloid self-parody he would later become, this Capote drinks, gossips, teases and whines, but mostly he works, with methodical intensity and ruthless discipline.  The movie's deep subject, crisply delineated in Dan Futterman's fine script (drawn from Gerald Clarke's biography) and dramatized without undue didacticism by Mr. Miller, is the risk and cost of this work. Following a hunch, Capote persuades William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker (played by Bob Balaban), to send him to Kansas. He brings along his childhood friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), to be his "research assistant and personal bodyguard," and the two of them, using New York glamour, Southern charm and Scotch whiskey, try to separate the residents of Holcomb from their natural reticence. They interview friends of the Clutters and befriend the lead investigator on the case, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), and his star-struck wife, Marie (the wonderful Amy Ryan), who even in the wake of an appalling crime cannot contain her delight at having a famous writer in her living room.  All of these characters - as well as Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), Capote's longtime lover - are supporting players in the Truman show, enduring his egoism with stoical good humor and occasional impatience. Ms. Keener performs the role of foil with particular grace. Through her wary, witty performance, she becomes the bridge that connects Capote with the audience; we take our cues from her as we try to figure out when he should be indulged and when he should be censured.  Both Ms. Keener's character and Mr. Greenwood's are novelists in their own right, something Capote seems only vaguely and intermittently aware of, less and less so as "In Cold Blood" takes over his life. As it does, his other relationships are overshadowed by his fascination with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), whose story Capote believes will be the key to the book and whose sensitive, sociopathic temperament is the dark mirror-image of his own. If Mr. Hoffman must address the challenge of impersonating a real, well-known person, Mr. Collins has to face the more complicated task of incarnating a real, obscure person who is also a character in a "nonfiction novel" and in a previous film (Richard Brooks's 1967 adaptation of "In Cold Blood," in which Smith was played by Robert Blake).  Perhaps because of this, Smith never quite achieves full human gravity; he is caught between whoever he was before he met Capote and the literary figure into which Capote made him. Still, in dramatizing this process - in showing how Smith was seduced, betrayed and immortalized by the writer's attention - "Capote" unflinchingly faces the moral abyss at the heart of the journalistic enterprise. Capote's disinclination to help in Smith's and Hickock's judicial appeals, allegedly because only their deaths would allow him the ending he needed, has long been part of his legend. The filmmakers neither let him off the hook nor turn him into a scapegoat, preferring to view him with a full and appropriate measure of ambiguity.  In setting out for Kansas, Capote believed himself to be tracing the violent intersection of "two Americas": the conservative, stable world of the Clutters and the lawless underworld represented by their killers. That may be the theme of "In Cold Blood," but the collision portrayed in "Capote" - the cultural friction that gives it a frisson of contemporary relevance - is a rather different one, between everyday American life and death and the equally American machinery that turns it into news, spectacle and sometimes art.  It is not just a matter of New York and the heartland, though that is a contrast the movie properly emphasizes. Capote in Kansas is an emissary from the spotlight planet of fame, collecting raw specimens of damaged humanity for his own purposes, an act of appropriation that he can neither defend nor avoid. "This book will change the way people write," Shawn breathlessly tells him. At present, the truth of that prophecy is all around us, and unlike the writing in "In Cold Blood," it isn't pretty.  "Capote" is rated R. It has some gruesome post-mortem images and a hanging.  Capote  Today and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival; opens nationwide on Friday.

The creation of a milestone in both modern literature and journalism -- which became a memorable 1967 movie -- is explored to reveal yet more riveting layers in "Capote," an unsettlingly intimate account of Truman Capote's obsessive research into the brutal 1959 killings of a Kansas family that yielded the groundbreaking faction work, "In Cold Blood." The mesmerizing performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the celebrated writer dominates every scene, while director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman's penetrating study enthralls in every aspect, making this Sony Pictures Classics release sure to figure high among the fall's prestige specialty draws.
Inherited by SPC from United Artists, "Capote" is the first of two indie projects on the same period in the subject's life, each culled from major biographies -- in this case, Gerald Clarke's probing, compassionate 1988 book. Due in 2006 from Warner Independent Pictures is Doug McGrath's "Have You Heard?", based on George Plimpton's 1997 assembly of recollections from those who knew Capote.
The first narrative feature from Miller (1998 docu-portrait "The Cruise"), and the first screenplay penned by actor Futterman (best known for roles in "The Birdcage" and "Will & Grace"), the film's most notable qualities perhaps are its quiet perceptiveness and unhurried sense of purpose, showing a sure-footedness and maturity that usually are the domain of far more experienced filmmakers. Futterman takes small liberties with the events and persons but his approach is one of measured respectfulness.
There's a graceful calibration and balance evident in the central positioning of Capote among opposites. Complete with an uncannily precise take on the prissy, infantile voice, and with all the author's characteristically fey mannerisms -- the batted eyelashes; the hands constantly fluttering to adjust his hair and glasses; the languid flourish with which he waves a cigarette, a martini or telephone; the perpetually raised pinkie -- Hoffman's Capote is Southern flamboyance taken to baroque extremes, yet at all times vulnerable and real.
One of his closest associates during the period portrayed here is Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), then on the cusp of fame with "To Kill a Mockingbird." The polar opposite of her childhood friend, she's the epitome of another kind of Southerner: down-to-earth, plain-spoken, unpretentious.
No less distinct from the central character is William Shawn (Bob Balaban), Capote's sedate, gentlemanly editor at The New Yorker, who agreed to the author's request to go to Kansas and write a story on the impact of the Clutter family killings on rural Holcomb. Likewise Capote's straight-up, dependable longtime companion Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), and the taciturn, masculine Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent who led the hunt for the two ex-con drifters responsible for the murders, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.).
The depiction of Capote as a social alien -- even when holding court at the Gotham soirees that were far more germane to him than Kansas farm country -- adds poignancy to the sense of kindred, misunderstood spirits that evolves between the writer and Smith. The convicted killer transfixes Truman from his first sight of him to his much-delayed execution, fueling the writer's creative genius but also destabilizing him emotionally. In many ways, this is a tragic story of unfulfilled love.
"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house, and he stood up and went out the back door while I went out the front," says Capote. The film succeeds remarkably in tracing the process by which Truman gained the trust and esteem of a man he described as "remote, suspicious, sullenly sleepy-eyed" -- all qualities brought to wounded life in Collins' deeply etched performance.
But what's most affecting is the double edge of Capote's literary achievement -- he invented the "non-fiction novel" with "In Cold Blood," which brought him for the first time to a mass audience -- and the shattering personal cost at which it came. He never completed another book, later descending into alcoholism and obesity, burning bridges with his rich socialite pals.
Futterman's script addresses with honesty the unpaid debt of a writer to his subject, as well as touching eloquently on the creative process, the bonding between misunderstood outcasts, the randomness of violent crime and the inhumanity of taking a life, on either side of the law. The film also acknowledges, as Capote did, the thin divide between quiet, conservative American life and its violent underbelly.
Hoffman never shies away from painting the subject as a vain, self-absorbed spotlight-seeker and a guileful manipulator, milking Smith and Hickock's death row agony for personal and professional glorification. But even when impatiently awaiting an execution date to give his book an ending, when deceiving Smith or using vicious, dismissive words to hurt him, Truman never becomes an entirely unsympathetic monster; the impact on the writer of the two men's complex association is made achingly palpable. Capote's refusal to take notes during interviews allows for constantly locked eyes, which cranks up the intensity and intimacy of his encounters with Smith to almost painful levels in scenes shot in uneasy close-up.
Playing a brilliant man who presented himself as a caricature and was the target of endless comic impersonations for it, Hoffman's achievement in giving him dignity and soul is impressive indeed. While the actor's height works against physical accuracy as the diminutive author, the depths and sensitivity of his characterization overcome any doubts.
In addition to the arresting work of Collins, unerring support comes especially via subtle turns from Keener, Cooper and Pellegrino, while stage actress Amy Ryan has lovely moments as Dewey's wife, whose welcome breaks down barriers for Truman with the Kansans.
In a movie refreshing for its lack of flash, the frugal use of handheld camera in Truman's shaken final encounter with Hickock and Smith before their hanging is emotionally effective. Elsewhere, Adam Kimmel's controlled camera work creates a textured, grainy visual field, its retro flavor enhanced by a desaturated color palette and a painterly eye for the empty, wintry landscapes. (Canadian locations stood in for the Kansas prairies.)
No less polished, in the same judicious, unshowy way, are composer Mychael Danna's pensive score, the understated period look of production designer Jess Gonchor and costumer Kasia Walicka-Maimone's work, and Christopher Tellefsen's fluid editing, which builds suspensefully toward a full account of the night of the murders, and then, to the haunting executions.

Directed by Bennett Miller  from actor Dan Futterman 's script and co-produced by star Philip Seymour Hoffman , Capote  is a cool and polished hall of mirrors reflecting the ways in which Truman Capote  came to write (and be written by) In Cold Blood the "nonfiction novel" about the senseless massacre of a Kansas farm family and the sociopathic drifters who committed the crime.
The author of Breakfast at Tiffany's  was already experimenting with journalism when he read an account of the killings in The New York Times  . Armed with a New Yorker  assignment and accompanied by faithful research assistant Harper Lee  (Catherine Keener ), soon to publish To Kill a Mockingbird , Capote ventured into America's heart of darkness, leveraging his celebrity to gain unprecedented access to the chief investigator (Chris Cooper ) and later the perps, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino ) and Perry Smith  (Clifton Collins Jr.) . Best known for The Cruise , his 1998 docu-portrait of tour guide Timothy "Speed" Levitch, Miller has experience directing a vehicle for motormouth megalomania. But when Capote  hits a snag of sameness, the engine stalls and the constant hum of purposeful activity rises to a dull roar.
In Cold Blood  had the good fortune to be published early in the season of America's domestic apocalypse. Its mass market saturation anticipated the two meaningless mass murders in the summer of 1966Richard Speck's slaughter of eight student nurses and Charles Whitman 's University of Texas  clock tower shooting spreeand it was filmed by Richard Brooks  in 1967. Hopelessly square in the year of Bonnie and Clyde , the movie starred Robert Blake , no less, as Smith and featured the terminally sarcastic Paul Stewart  (Citizen Kane  's valet) in the Capote role. Capote  is In Cold Blood 's In Cold Blood : Amid the true-crime scenes, Truman dazzles the audience at the 92nd Street Y and drools over Smith's notebooks: "He's a gold mine."
Futterman has cited Janet Malcolm 's critique of journalism as his source of inspiration. It has been argued (I believe by Malcolm) that, in making Hickock and Smith into literary characters, Capote humanized them. That's not true of Capote , where even their execution is all about Truman. "I don't know what you must think of me," he whines as the smirking killers are harnessed for the gallows. The horrors of random murder or capital punishment are subsumed by Capote's narcissism. Nailing the writer's querulous drawl, Hoffman plays him as a vain and peevish monster of self-absorption. Solipsism may even be the meaning of the movie. But in the bell jar that is Capote , Hoffman bogarts the oxygen; everyone else asphyxiates. Fame is its own punishment. The credit crawl suggests that In Cold Blood  made Capote the most famous writer in AmericaJohnny Carson 's garden gnome familiarand ruined his life.
