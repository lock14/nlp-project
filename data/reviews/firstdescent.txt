Do you remember the Snurfer? It was a mid-Sixties precursor to today�s snowboards that was developed by a retired chemical engineer from Michigan with the unlikely name of Sherman Popper. His grand idea � essentially a surfboard for the ski slopes, with a steering rope mounted to the front � ended up under scads of Christmas trees starting in 1965. (I barely recall a much smaller version of myself being trounced by a Snurfing big kid on some snowbound, upstate New York hillock ages ago. The image must have stuck, though, since I ended up glued to a skateboard from for a solid decade beginning in 1984.) This vertiginous documentary (which really ought to be playing on IMAX screens) echoes skateboarding�s parallel history and Stacy Peralta�s brilliant doc Dogtown and Z-Boys
, as well as that director�s more recent Riding Giants
, in which pro surfers are towed out to sea to tackle the biggest waves in the world. The five subjects of First Descent
 � 40-year-old snowboarding legend Shawn Farmer, 39-year-old Nick Peralta, plaid-clad Vermont teen Hannah Teter, Norwegian superstar Terje Haakonsen, and red-haired, teen slope rat Shaun White � are shuttled out to the far back country of Alaska�s tallest and most inaccessible peaks via helicopter and then, one by one, rocket down the crag-encrusted, gorge chutes like buckshot fired from God�s own 20-gauge. In a word, it�s gnarly. In between these "first descents," the filmmakers unravel the brief history of snowboarding, including the surreally appropriate incident at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, wherein Canadian Ross Rebagliati very nearly lost the sport�s very first Olympic gold meda after testing positive for marijuana use. ("He should have been given a second medal for being able to ride stoned," confides one powder-happy wag.) Along with narration from Henry Rollins and music from the likes of Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Face to Face, there�s much made about how snowboarding is a sport in its infancy. That�s true. Unlike skateboarding, which came up in a relatively slow progression from street to pool to ramp to corporate sponsorship and the XGames over nearly three decades, snowboarding moved from a Banned Everywhere status to the Olympics in less than half that time, which doesn�t make it any less of a sport, per se, but clearly drew the corporations and big-money outfits much faster. In many ways, it�s skating on frozen adrenaline outbursts: The jumps are far higher, the risks far more dangerous (at one point the filmmakers, seasoned snowboarding pros themselves, catch Haakonsen�s wild, near vertical riding as it initiates a mammoth avalanche), and the rewards not just financial but mental, physical, and spiritual as well. Final Descent
�s ace in the hole, though, is in its cross-generational quintet, which allows for a cutaway cross-section of the sport's best and brightest to be observed as they do what they do best. The garrulous, bearded Farmer, in particular, comes to be something of a big brother figure to Teter�s blonde, blue-eyed teen superboarder. It�s a gas to see the age difference melt away atop a wind-whipped, 7601-foot-high mountain peak as the chopper lifts off, leaving both filmmakers and subjects with only one way down from what appears to be the roof of the world. Awesome.

         Kevin Harrison and Kemp Curley's "First Descent" takes its title from a snowboarder's initial trip down a pristine mountain peak. In this instance it is Mountain 7601, a craggy, awesomely steep peak in a spectacular, snow-covered mountain range near Valdez, Alaska, where five of the world's top snowboarders have come to spend two weeks expanding and testing their skills.
 
  Norway's triple world champion, Terje Haakonsen, alone who turns out to be fully up to tackling the nearly vertical, crevasse-ridden 7601, which will put to the utmost test his skill at outrunning avalanches in breathtaking fashion. The other four are scarcely slouches. Two 18-year-olds, Shaun White of Carlsbad and Hannah Teter of Belmont, Vt., have never tackled Alaska's vast mountains, but Teter's confidence, rock-solid even when she admits to fear, and White's amazing jumping skills see them through. They are joined by Alaskan vets Shawn Farmer and Nick Perata. Despite an initial "reality check" fall that leaves him injured, the hearty, bearded 40-year-old Farmer ends with a dazzling display of snowboarding down jagged crevasses instead of snowy slopes.
 


         






    Harrison and Curley, however, seem needlessly driven to hard-sell snowboarding, which the film surveys from its roots in skateboarding to its emergence as an Olympic sport, as if their jaw-dropping footage and the very likable and engaging snowboarders weren't more than enticing. As a result, what should have been a thrilling 90-minute sport adventure runs on for 20 more repetitive minutes. "First Descent" is exciting, but less would surely have been more.

Spontaneity in '39 Pounds': Take 2

 
 Dani Menkin's documentary "39 Pounds of Love" is a heart-tugger that, although highly inspirational, has a strongly orchestrated quality. The film's title refers to the weight of 34-year-old Israeli 3-D animator Ami Ankilewitz, afflicted with spinal muscular atrophy that has reduced his mobility to a single finger on his left hand. Despite the prognosis of a doctor in Laredo, Texas, where Ankilewitz was born to a Mexican mother and an Israeli businessman, that he would not live beyond the age of 6, he has survived and even flourished. He is sustained by a loving family, which eventually settled in Tel Aviv, and friends, plus his own will and creativity. And "39 Pounds" benefits from Ankilewitz's animated sequences, in which he whimsically expresses his longings and dreams.
 
  When Ankilewitz realizes that he has fallen in love with Christina, his pretty, vivacious caretaker, and that she can reciprocate only as a friend, he sends her away and decides to pursue his dream of returning to America, not merely to discover the country but to confront the doctor who told his mother he would not live beyond 6. Ankilewitz's journey to Laredo begins in Los Angeles with a specially equipped trailer, accompanied by his best friend and former caretaker, Asaf, plus the film's seven-man crew. Considering Ankilewitz's fragility — the high altitude at the Grand Canyon causes him to lose consciousness — it's hard to understand why the doctor, who could quite possibly no longer be alive, was not located in advance, perhaps because Ankilewitz and the filmmakers wanted to go to Texas anyway, for a reunion with Ankilewitz's long-estranged brother Oscar in Dallas.
 
  In any event, the film's "spontaneity" has the feel of considerable planning, which lends its stellar moments an overly rehearsed quality. Even so, there's a heroic defiance to Ankilewitz — and those who enable him to live as fulfilling a life as he does are heroes themselves.
 
 "39 Pounds of Love,"
 Unrated. Family fare suitable for older children. Running time: 1 hour, 10 minutes. Exclusively at the Landmark Nuart through Thursday, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angles, (310) 281-8223.
 
 
Clock's ticking on that first kiss

 
 "Little Manhattan" is a handsome charmer about the avalanche of first love, as experienced by Gabe (Josh Hutcherson), a smart 11-year-old living in Manhattan's Upper West Side. At just the time his parents (Bradley Whitford, Cynthia Nixon) explain to him that they are splitting up, Gabe is thunderstruck to discover he's attracted to Rosemary (Charlie Ray), whom he has known since kindergarten but never really noticed before. All of a sudden Gabe finds himself moving her up from third prettiest girl in the class to first place and then becoming her sparring partner in karate class, where to his dismay he finds he's no match for her.
 
  Rosemary is nonetheless drawn to Gabe, and they begin spending time together, especially as summer vacation begins. Gabe was never happier, but when Rosemary tells him that in another week her parents (John Dossett, Talia Balsam), successful soap opera stars, are sending her off to six weeks of summer camp, he realizes he has but a very short time in which to work up his nerve to kiss her.
 
  As directed by Mark Levin, "Little Manhattan" is an endearing, affectionately humorous and even lyrical depiction of the dawning of adolescence amid the privileged, yet Jennifer Flackett's script, for all its sheen, is problematic. In conversation Gabe speaks like the normal bright kid he is, yet his speech as soundtrack narrator of his own story is precociously improbable ("like two ships passing on Sheep's Meadow"). "Little Manhattan" would have been more persuasive had the narrator's voice been that of the now adult Gabe, looking back on his memory of first love.
 
 "Little Manhattan,"
 PG for mild thematic elements, language and brief action. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In general release.
   

In the pre-title opening moments of First Descent , a helicopter drops five snowboarders on the scrawny tip of what looks like a 7,600-foot-tall shark tooth. They huddle together miserably against the winds, and in a few moments, they're supposed to dive off the edge of their untrammeled Alaskan mountain and steer their boards down a slope that tilts an insane 60 degrees. This is an excellent windup, and it's not just for some middling ''Do the Dew'' TV spot, either  though this sometimes thrilling extreme-sports doc was produced by an unlikely new brand-extending outfit called Mountain Dew Films. (Hey, as far as offshoots go, this movie goes down a lot easier than Code Red.)
As for that scary peak, you must wait till the end to see who actually slides off it. After the opening cliff-hanger, the movie pulls back to tell two interweaving stories. One follows that group of telegenic freestyle pros as they shear across rocky gorges, fly like cannonballs, and (in one big money shot) outrun an avalanche in Alaskan backcountry. The other delivers the history of American snowboarding, which used to be so outlaw that some snobby skiers feared that snowboarders carried guns. Snowboarding is a bigger deal in other countries, and watching weird footage from an arena snow-stunt show in Tokyo, you might come to a new appreciation for the way-flashy sport. In that Tokyo show, the scale is so gargantuan  complete with monster jumps, ecstatic fans, pyrotechnic showers, laser lighting, and, best of all, a gong  that snowboarding at its most over-the-top, fantastic, and impossible starts to look like science fiction.
First Descent  is not as eloquent, and thus not as electrifying, as Stacy Peralta's Dogtown and Z-Boys  or Riding Giants , the two jock docs it's clearly modeled after. No matter: Visually, MD Films offers up a sugar rush.


"First Descent: The Story of the Snowboarding Revolution" profiles and aggressively sells the relatively new sport of freestyle snowboarding, borrowing moves from Imax adventure films and the Bruce Brown tradition of surfing docs. Pic displays filmmakers Kevin Harrison's and Kemp Curley's love of snowboarding, but suffers from an unjustifiably long running time, considerable repetition and a generally awkward structure. Fans will pile in during the opening frame for the sport's first mainstream movie, but vid is where this one will score style points.
Alaska is the mecca of snowboarders, and it's where one of the sport's pioneers, Nick Perata, invites a combo of legends and current stars to test their mettle in two weeks' worth of backcountry freeriding in the precipitous Chugach Mountains near Valdez. Participants include 40-year-old former wild man Shawn Farmer, 30-year-old Norwegian master Terje Haakonsen and 18-year-old whippersnappers Shaun White and Hannah Teter, later joined by another hot star, Travis Rice.
Between the days on the mountains, pic folds in mini-profiles of Farmer, Haakonsen, White and Teter, and further layers the story with chapters on the sport's history, starting with its crude beginnings on backyard slopes, with competitors racing and jumping on a single board, rather than skiing's standard two boards. But the pic's historical sections lack the thrilling, visceral sense of the action itself and tend to slow the film down.
This fundamental difference in boards, plus a wide generational divide, gave snowboarding its needed rebel image against that of the conservative skiing establishment in the 1970s, and the pic helpfully includes a few amusing archival clips of this battle of cultures.
As history, though, "First Descent" barely draws the line to the sport's real birth in freestyle skateboarding, as memorialized in Stacy Peralta's far superior docu "Dogtown and Z-Boys."Although snowboarding's rocky development -- including a mini-scandal during its first year as an Olympic event -- is interesting in brief doses, its expansion into corporate sponsorship is a familiar replay of other sports that went from the margins to the mainstream.
Far more compelling is the action on the Chugach Mountains; when Perata's guests fly by helicopter to a nearby peak, it's fair to think they're collectively out of their minds.
Perata, with Farmer, explains some of the finer points of backcountry 'boarding to Teter and White, who've never done this before. The quieter Haakonsen expresses none of the trepidation shared openly by the youngsters, but when it comes time to jump down inclines of 50 degrees and greater, they all come through just fine.
A later jaunt to another mountain, where some of the guys build a ramp out of packed snow for a jump, proves too much for Farmer, who breaks an arm, and Teter, who crashes unharmed. Most dangerous maneuver by far is pulled off by Rice, who jumps and hits a snow pack that cracks, setting off an avalanche he narrowly eludes.
Final day's action includes the group deciding against trying one ultra-steep peak when winds kick up, followed by a lovely sequence where they speed down a nearly clear slope (with White looking for small rock outcroppings to jump). Haakonsen confirms his rep as the sport's best with his incredibly daring choice to return to the steep mountain and challenge its extremely dangerous inclines.
Pic's excessive 110-minute running time could do with massive trimming by editor Curley, especially since on-camera subjects repeat the same key points ad nauseam (snowboarding is about personal expression, backcountry freestyle is not for the faint of heart).
Former rocker Mark Mothersbaugh is the right choice for the pulsating score, which surprisingly tosses in Indian sitar touches. Liberal use of helicopter-based shooting, under ace lenser Scott Duncan's lead, proves absolutely essential to properly view these snowboarders cutting through the wilderness.
Pic is Universal's second doc this year, though the two couldn't be much further apart in subject matter: First doc was "Inside Deep Throat."

With its touchy-feely first-person focus and propensity for staid, bullet-point factualism, Kevin Harrison  and Kemp Curley 's snowboarding documentary First Descent  comes off as an overlong, overstuffed promo for an "industry" that hasn't needed promoting since the movie's target audience was in diapers. Blame Stacy Peralta : His rigorously self-mythologizing Dogtown and Z-Boys  proved that subjective sports docs could make milkable cash cows. But Descent split awkwardly between home-movie-spiked historical background and new footage of five pro snowboarders tackling virgin Alaskan slopesfails to duplicate the defiant exuberance that made Peralta's flick such a hoot. The Alaska sequences, featuring predictable but still-stunning snowboarding money shots, work best; their juxtaposition of the affable nonchalance of young 'boarders Shaun White  and Hannah Teter  with the terrifying near-vertical descents they make is inspiring, and Harrison and Curley capture the quintet's individual moments of doubt and triumph with real intimacy. The decade-by-decade history bits are a slog, though, and the (unintended?) cumulative effect suggests that snowboarding has been so tamed by corporate sponsorship that its adherents are forced to go ever farther afield in order for kicks. It's a point worth making, but neither PepsiCo  (which funded the film via its newly minted MD Films) nor Harrison and Curley (whose company, Transition Productions , includes such clients as Burton Snowboards  and ESPN ) are best suited to make it.
