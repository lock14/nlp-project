�Only love can bring the rain,� go the lyrics to the Who�s dramatic rock anthem, �Love, Reign O�er Me� from Quadrophenia
. Writer/director Binder (The Upside of Anger
) appears to have fashioned a whole film to echo the song�s expansive sentiments and sonic grandeur (though the song is performed in the film by Pearl Jam rather than the Who). But it�s relevant to Binder�s lead character Charlie Fineman (Sandler), who, in contrast with his surname, is anything but fine. Having lost his wife and children on 9/11, he quit his job as a dentist and now � several years after 9/11 � wanders the streets of Manhattan on an electric scooter with ear-encasing headphones clamped to his head to block out � what? The past? The future? He only brims with life when discussing arcane music references, playing the video game Colossus
 on his wide-screen TV, or during a Mel Brooks marathon at the cinema. But then he runs across Alan Johnson (Cheadle), his old roommate from dental school, who takes it upon himself to try to resuscitate his friend, and in the process, also winds up reviving his own life, which has been growing stale. (Pinkett Smith is cast in the thankless role of his nagging wife.) Despite being a story about life in New York post-9/11, the film does not dwell on the tragedy. Binder is more interested in piercing �the mind of the married man� (to employ the title of his career-making HBO series). Again adopting a dramatic persona, Sandler shows his desire to do more than be a Happy Gilmore for the rest of his career. His work here is decent, though hardly revelatory, but his game is raised several notches by Cheadle�s masterful presence. Cheadle takes what could have been a role as a mere foil and creates a rich portrait of a vaguely discontented married man. Yet the drama sputters once it reaches a contrived and melodramatic climax that feels undernourished and artificial � both less than and more than one had hoped for. Reign Over Me
 is disjointed and needlessly sentimental, though its whole often compensates for its sketchy parts.


In "Reign Over Me, " Adam Sandler looks exactly like Bob Dylan in the singer's mid-'80s "Empire Burlesque " period. Same graying corona of hair and beard-stubbled jowls, same enigmatic smile. The difference is in the eyes. Dylan's have always been unreadable shards of flint, but Sandler's are great, bottomless puppy eyes of sadness that say "love me
." Until they snap into focus and say "just kidding."
Which is the real Sandler? Both, probably. "Reign Over Me" is a therapy drama in the vein of "The Fisher King "; it's about male friendship and 9/11 and healing and closure, and it is, surprisingly, not as unbearable as that sounds. Nor is Sandler, who plays Charlie Fineman , a New York dentist who went off his trolley when his wife and daughters died in one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center.
That was five years ago, and when his college roommate, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle ), runs into him, Charlie is, for all intents and purposes, a ghost. He lives off insurance money and rides a motor-scooter through the streets of Manhattan, plays video games until all hours and obsessively remodels his kitchen. He denies he ever had a family or that he knew Alan at all.
In short, Charlie is Rain Man , and Sandler plays him as he has previous "serious" roles in "Punch-Drunk Love " and "Spanglish ": with a gentle stammer and an inability to look anybody in the eye. He keeps changing the subject, too, nattering about trivia and Chinese food. Really: Rain Man. Maybe Sandler thinks if he keeps plowing this narrow rut he'll turn up an Oscar someday.
The funny thing is that Charlie's still a fully realized creation and a terribly moving one: A man who has fled back to an idealized youth to avoid the pain of moving on. That puts him an interesting half-step away from Billy Madison , Happy Gilmore , and a lot of Sandler's own fans, but you don't think about that while the story's progressing.
Actually, you think about how much fun it is to watch Don Cheadle act. "Reign Over Me" turns out to be Alan's story more than Charlie's, which is fine, since Cheadle comes with the full skill set. Alan's a dentist, too, married with two daughters, a busy practice. A nice guy. Dying for lack of oxygen. He latches on to the idea of helping Charlie as a way to get off the leash of his controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith ) and get back to his own carefree college years.
The problem is that Charlie's not a college buddy anymore. He's a profoundly disturbed individual, and the very mention of his dead family sends him into furniture-breaking rages. His in-laws (played by Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon ) noodge him to show the proper respect to their daughter's memory but they also drop hints about having him committed. Alan decides to help, which in this sort of movie means he's really helping himself.
"Reign Over Me" -- the title comes from the 1973 Who song "Love, Reign O'er Me ," which Charlie uses to drown out the world on his headphones -- is written and directed by Mike Binder , who also plays Charlie's ferrety accountant. Binder has bounced around in television ("The Mind of the Married Man ") and movies ("The Upside of Anger ") and he loves the sound of guys hanging out doing nothing. The sweetest, sharpest scenes in the movie involve Alan, Charlie, snack food, and a wall-size TV playing the videogame "Shadow of the Colossus ."
The weirdest scenes involve women. "Reign Over Me" has issues with them a shrink could charge double for, and they're not the ones Binder thinks he's dealing with. Conveniently, there's a lady psychiatrist in the same office building as Alan, an angelic Dr. Fixit played by Liv Tyler whose postdoctoral assets are noted approvingly by both him and Charlie (they're a lot blunter than I am).
Pinkett Smith, meanwhile, chops endless vegetables and folds countless napkins; if her hair were scrunchied any tighter, her head would explode. Charlie's father-in-law's a mensch, his mother-in-law's a harpy. What Charlie remembers best about his wife is that "she never nagged me." And so on.
The strangest character in this locker room is Donna (Saffron Burrows ), one of the psychiatrist's patients who wanders down the hall, sits in Alan's dentist's chair, and offers to pleasure him. She's gorgeous in the bargain, and the movie is torn between making hubba-hubba noises, deriding her as a castrating nutcase, and taking her seriously. She's the least believable character I've seen on a movie screen in many a moon.
But Alan and his small discontents are
 believable, and the character of Charlie taps into a deeper anxiety. Not 9/11, although "Reign Over Me" uses that dreadful touchstone honorably enough. Many of us, though, may have a longtime friend or two who've lost their way -- who've been shipwrecked by life and now seem smudged, not all there. They remind us of what we got right and what we were terrified we'd get wrong.
Do you cross the street to avoid these people or do you mess up your orderly existence to help fix theirs? Binder reminds us the latter response is the only human one, and Cheadle makes that choice sane and warming. In its best moments, "Reign Over Me" quietly says that we're our problem friends' keepers. At its worst, the movie is 
a problem friend.


         Long live rock!!! (Cue accompanying fist pump with Bic lighter aloft) Be it dead or alive....
 
 It's actually another song by the Who that inspires the title of writer-director Mike Binder's "Reign Over Me," but it seems appropriate to begin with a guttural, lung-clearing wail of some kind. From the opening, surreal scooter-eye view of Manhattan streetscapes accompanied by Graham Nash's "Simple Man" to its rousing closing credits, "Reign" is an ardent man-love ode to rock in both its soft and hard forms.
 


         






   Don Cheadle stars as Alan Johnson, a successful New York dentist, jolted out of a melancholia of indeterminate causes when he unexpectedly encounters Adam Sandler's Charlie Fineman, his college roommate with whom he'd lost contact. That Charlie does not recognize him and appears to have suffered some type of breakdown only energizes Alan's desire to rekindle their friendship.
 
 The oddly matched pair begins to hang out, with Alan drawn into Charlie's strangely cloistered world of vintage rock. He's got a music room where he plays along to vinyl records, and he somewhat incongruously drums in a local punk band. The music is a haven from any reminders of a life he lost.
 
 In hair that looks like it was borrowed from late-model Bob Dylan, Charlie is one sad and scary cat. The tragedy that triggered Charlie's withdrawal from life in the first place hovers in the background like a dark cloud threatening a downpour.
 
 One minute he's feverishly scaling the video game heights of Shadow of the Colossus, the next he's retreating into the safety of his iPod. It's a one-man frat-boy world devoid of responsibility that's marvelously attractive to the reserved Alan.
 
 A scattershot dramatist at best in terms of plot, Binder rigs his scenarios like rickety scaffolding, and you wonder how they remain standing. Like his "The Upside of Anger," with Joan Allen and Kevin Costner as well-matched suburban lushes, "Reign Over Me" depends on the interaction of its complexly drawn characters to remain compelling even when its plot veers into questionable territory.
 
 Along with two excellent lead performances, the film has a fine supporting cast, including Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland and Binder himself. Binder's people are not anyone you'd ask over for dinner, but it's fascinating to watch them argue, negotiate and cajole one another in exasperatingly human ways. The two men at the center of "Reign" are both treading water, and though their situations and reunion feel awfully contrived, there's an authenticity to the way Alan gravitates to Charlie and then tries to help him.
 
 We've seen Sandler do serious before — notably in Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love" — so it should be no surprise that he pulls it off here. There's always an underlying anger to Sandler's most interesting performances, that sense that he's going to pop at any moment. Charlie allows him to be all the things that have made him a lively performer — outrageous, vulnerable, goofy and violent, almost simultaneously.
 
 It helps that Sandler has the intensely reactive Cheadle to play off, especially when he delivers a key monologue that easily could have gone awry. Generosity is the sign of a great actor, and Cheadle shares the screen in an illuminating way. Alan is the ostensible protagonist, but Cheadle is confident enough to essentially play  straight man to Sandler's inherently showier role.
 
 It's crucial to the film's balance that Alan be well-grounded. The discontent he is experiencing at the beginning of the film is not unlike that felt by Chris Rock's character in "I Think I Love My Wife." Everything in his life seems perfect save this unexplained restlessness, and though the spouse character here — an underutilized Jada Pinkett Smith — is no better developed than in the other film, Cheadle makes Alan's discoveries far more interesting.
 
 Binder uses rock — memorably the Pretenders, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen — in a refreshing way to reflect the intricacies of the relationships. What pours out of Charlie's iPod might as well be coming from his broken heart, but Binder's choices keep things surprisingly spirited. Movies about male friendship are often trivialized with the "buddy" tag, but this one resonates beyond that.
 
 
 "Reign Over Me." MPAA rating: R for language and sexual references. Run time: 2 hours, 4 minutes. In general release.   

Five years after the cataclysm of September 11, American wounds are still so thinly scabbed that any reference to that real disaster in something as artificial as a movie remains a shock; just the matter-of-fact appearance of the Twin Towers in the New York skyline in a story set prior to 2001 is enough to bruise a viewer's heart, a reminder of all that's missing. Reign Over Me  jabs at those bruises with well-meaning fingers  and with Adam Sandler's tears  making for a strange, black-and-blue therapeutic drama equally mottled with likable good intentions and agitating clumsiness.
Sandler plays Charlie Fineman, once a successful Manhattan dentist and now an emotional wreck, with matted bird's-nest hair and a gray face to advertise his distress. Charlie roams the streets at all hours on a scooter, blocking out the trembling beauty of the city with big crazy-man headphones clamped over his ears. (His music of choice: rock from the long-lost '70s and '80s, particularly The River -era Springsteen, and the redemptive song from the Who's Quadrophenia  that inspires the movie's title.) And that's how fellow dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) first sees his old friend and college roommate on the street  a lost soul on wheels, tuned beyond the reach of another human voice.
Alan himself resides at the other end of the misery spectrum, which is to say he's an affluent, responsible if routine-weary husband (his wife is played by a graceful Jada Pinkett Smith), a father to two good daughters, and an attractive professional whose biggest workplace problem may be that female patients tend to throw themselves at him, burdening him with the manly responsibility of deflecting their advances. Still, he feels stifled, and stale in marriage  the kind of male character who regularly occupies the mind of writer and director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger ), creator of TV's The Mind of the Married Man .
It doesn't take long for an audience to piece together Charlie's tragedy: His wife and three daughters died in one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center that cruelly sunny September morning, and he literally can't bear to think about his loss. But it takes a maddening tease of time and plot-stalling to find out what these two men can possibly do to help one another through their pains, and an unpleasant leap of faith to believe that Alan, in his sitcom-strength dissatisfaction, might envy Charlie's unexpected freedom to reinvent himself.
It takes an even longer time  the entire movie, reallyto get a handle on Sandler's unstable interpretation of incapacitating grief as something close to autism, tweaked with instances of buddy-buddy kibitzing. Whether or not they're successful, I have come to seriously admire the artistic sophistication of Sandler's choice in projects, particularly when he taps into the adult rage behind the child-doofus Peter Pan persona  e.g., Punch-Drunk Love  or Anger Management . But I still hit a wall of alienation when it comes to that big-baby drawl the star sticks with, and with the obtuseness his preferred characters display toward other adults, suggestive of vexing mental problems. For instance, while out on one of his man dates with Charlie, Alan learns over the phone that his own father has just died. Charlie is as incapable of absorbing his friend's news as a 2-year-old. Instead, he's obsessed with where to get some Chinese food.
Were two such looming subjects  9/11 and Adam Sandler  not the attention-consuming focal points of Reign Over Me , the movie would be  a nice, New Yorky sketch, sweetly shot all over town, about a smooth fellow (Cheadle is elegant, even on the back of his costar's Go-Ped) negotiating a well-stocked Woody Allen landscape of supporting players: There's a crazy, sex-hungry patient (Saffron Burrows) who stalks Alan's pants, and, in Charlie's corner, Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon as in-laws, Liv Tyler as an empathetic shrink, Donald Sutherland as a forceful court judge, and even the filmmaker himself as an uncouth accountant who guards the widower's millions in insurance and government payouts.
But there it is again: serious consequences of 9/11, casually referenced, and hitched to the wishful story of a bored, unexceptional dentist who has hit a mild communication snag with his reasonable wife. The juxtaposition is as tenuous as Charlie's grip on reality, held together only by an audience's own nervous sadness and yearning for consolation.

 In “Reign Over Me,” Don Cheadle plays Alan Johnson, a Manhattan dentist in possession of the usual trappings (at least in movies) of comfort and success: a silver Volvo, a big apartment, a lovely wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), two children and a vague but acute feeling of malaise. Like the investment banker being played by  Chris Rock on a nearby screen at the multiplex (in “I Think I Love My Wife”), Alan is not so much unhappy as bored by his own contentment.  The character may be a bit of a cliché, but the performance is typical of Mr. Cheadle, which is to say flawlessly understated and  intensely interesting. Behind Alan’s unruffled, buttoned-up facade — the smiles of professional courtesy and domestic agreeableness —  lie barbs of hostility and humor that pop out   to keep you alert and off balance.  Alan is one half of the movie’s buddy-picture pairing. The other is Charlie Fineman, Alan’s former college roommate, who is played by Adam Sandler. Mr. Sandler’s performance is by no means understated, but neither is it typical. Rather it is the kind of role that tries to force you to see a familiar performer in a radical new light. Mr. Sandler has ventured outside his big-baby persona before,  notably in “Spanglish” and in “50 First Dates,” but this is the first time he has shouldered so much dramatic weight.  And the burden is about as heavy as they come. Charlie, once a successful dentist like Alan, came undone when his wife and three daughters died on board one of the 9/11 planes. The writer and director of the film, Mike Binder, does not withhold this information, but he does approach it coyly, allowing his characters to speak about the attacks in allusions and euphemisms most of the time.  Charlie himself is in a state far beyond denial. In his grief he has regressed into a kind of shaggy preadolescence — which makes him, come to think of it, a version of the standard Sandler character after all. Charlie zips around Manhattan on a motorized scooter and retreats into a world of video games, compulsive late-night kitchen renovation and classic rock, which he listens to on headphones he wears like a protective helmet. Though his unkempt hair shows signs of graying, his diction is childlike, and his emotional weather resembles that of a toddler: the pursuit of endless gratification punctuated by occasional tantrums.  Like “The Upside of Anger,” in which Mr. Binder benefited from fine work by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner, “Reign Over Me” uses the rhythms and moods of comedy to explore, and also to contain, overpowering feelings of loss, anger and hurt. And like that earlier movie, this one is maddeningly uneven.  It’s rare to see so many moments of grace followed by so many stumbles and fumbles, or to see intelligence and discretion undone so thoroughly by glibness and grossness. And it is puzzling, and ultimately draining, to see a film that waves the flag of honesty — Face your demons! Speak from your heart! Open up! — turn out to be so phony.  The best scenes are those that give Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Sandler room to play against each other, to bring their very different temperaments into a workable syncopation. The premise of their relationship is fairly schematic. Alan, who resumes his friendship with Charlie after years of being out of touch, tries to coax his old pal back into contact with the world around him, while Charlie’s life of compulsive play allows Alan a furlough from his confining responsibility. The two actors perform the dance of superego and id with impressive ease and suavity.  But Mr. Binder strews their path with obstacles. A subplot involving Saffron Burrows as a would-be patient who propositions Alan in his office seems like a leftover from “The Mind of the Married Man,” Mr. Binder’s dreadful HBO series. Another, with Liv Tyler as a therapist, is superfluous and wearisome. Worse, as Mr. Sandler moves from mumbling repression of Charlie’s pain to tearful expression of it (with songs by Bruce Springsteen and the Who punching hard on the audience’s emotional buttons) this director’s approach to the 9/11 theme starts to feel crude and exploitative.  A recitation of the events of that day, especially coming after a series of lovingly shot Manhattan streetscapes, can’t fail to tighten throats and moisten eyes. But that makes the big therapeutic payoffs at the end feel easy and unearned.  By that point you may feel used as well as used up. The delicate insights toward which “Reign Over Me” at first seems headed, and the psychological subtlety of much of the acting, are squandered in revelations and confrontations that belong in a made-for-TV weepie. Mr. Binder can be a smart writer and a fluent director, but he can’t quite keep his dumb ideas from getting in the way of his good ones. He’s a bit like Charlie without Alan, spinning his wheels and lost in his own head.  “Reign Over Me” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual references.

Two vividly drawn characters desperately needing to jumpstart their stalled lives fortuitously connect in "Reign Over Me." Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle head a strong cast in this affecting drama of friendship and regeneration. Ironically, however, Sandler's compelling performance in an atypically serious role -- one even more emotionally complex than his troubled character in "Punch-Drunk Love" -- may complicate efforts to sell this decidedly unfunny March 23 release. But Sony will need every iota of the thesp's star power to help overcome any lingering audience resistance to pics dealing with 9/11 and its aftermath.
Written and directed by Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger"), "Reign" pivots on the chance encounter of two former college roommates at precisely the right moment in each man's life.
Alan Johnson (Cheadle), a successful Manhattan dentist, finds himself overwhelmed by his responsibilities toward his family -- including his beautiful wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), their children and his aging parents -- and his demanding business partners. Feeling increasingly detached and discontented, he's almost grateful for the chance to focus on someone in far worse shape: Charlie Fineman (Sandler, looking like a scruffy, '60s-era Bob Dylan), a formerly gregarious fellow who shut down almost completely after his wife and children perished in one of the doomed planes on Sept. 11, 2001.
When he's not endlessly playing videogames or refurbishing his kitchen, Charlie aimlessly traverses the streets of New York on a motor scooter. But even when he's outside, he continues to block out the world -- and any unpleasant memories -- by blasting '70s pop and rock through his headphones.
Simply by hanging out with his former roomie (and fellow dental school grad), Alan manages to draw Charlie back toward something like normalcy. But even with the help of an insightful therapist (a credible and creditable Liv Tyler), there are limits to how far Alan can coax Charlie along. And that isn't nearly far enough for Charlie's in-laws (Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon), who resent being denied access to their last link to their lost daughter and grandchildren. 
Throughout most of "Reign Over Me," Binder takes a deliberately paced and casually discursive approach to storytelling, allowing his actors all the time and space they need to convey their complexities and reveal telling details of character. Many scenes are infused with an air of spontaneity that is by turns thrilling and portentous, so that it's often hard to predict whether an encounter or a conversation is building toward a comic-relief punchline or a deadly serious punch-out.
There is, of course, the predictable scene when Charlie finally breaks through and begins to discuss specific details of the day he lost his family. Even here, however, Binder and his actors manage to surprise: Sandler suddenly starts to talk, Cheadle and Tyler listen -- attentively, as though fearing anything they do might spoil the moment -- and the aud is spellbound.
During the 10 minutes or so, unfortunately, Binder tries too hard, too hastily, to wrap things up with an all-too-pat resolution. And even though some supporting players make memorable impressions with a minimum of screen time -- most notably, Donald Sutherland as a sternly compassionate judge and Paula Newsome as Alan's sassy receptionist -- other actors are unable to fully flesh out roles that, apparently, were diminished in the editing room.
Still, Sandler (never making a false step while maneuvering though vertiginous mood swings) and Cheadle (deftly commingling instinctive decency with quiet desperation) are individually excellent, and bring out the best in each other. And the pic itself transcends its real but relatively minor flaws to score a satisfyingly potent impact. 
Russ Alsobrook's high-def digital lensing subtly and skillfully sustains the mood of anxiety that percolates below the surface even during humorous moments. The soundtrack includes well-chosen pop and rock hits, including two versions -- both the Who's original, and a fine cover by Pearl Jam -- of "Love, Reign O'er Me."

As Charlie Fineman , a New York dentist who lost his wife and three young daughters in one of the September 11 plane crashes, Adam Sandler  sports a mass of bedraggled locks and walks with his head hung low, the sounds of the city drowned out by his ever present iPod . Having given up his practice and severed virtually all ties to family and friends, he scarcely leaves his apartment anymore, save for zipping around the eerily depopulated streets of lower Manhattan on his motorized scooter in the midnight hoursa ghost of a man haunting an urban graveyard. Five years on, Charlie Fineman is still in a state of shock and awe, which we know not just because his grooming and social skills have gone to pot, but because he can't seem to stop renovating and re-renovating his kitchenpart of an unfulfilled promise to his late wifeand because he spends copious hours in front of a video game called Shadow of the Colossus , in which he can repeatedly lay waste to the evil forces he was powerless to defeat in life.
Like Spike Lee 's 25th Hour , writer-director Mike Binder 's Reign Over Me is less expressly about 9/11 than about how New Yorkers have tried (and in some cases failed) to reassemble life in the aftermathand if Binder has a considerably heavier hand when it comes to metaphor, his movie nevertheless remains buoyant because the feelings in it are immutable, and because Sandler has never before held the screen with greater intensity. A role like this is one that a lot of comic actors look for when they want to show that they can be serious with a capital S , and which most of them botch by overacting in the big, extroverted way of their comedy roles: They pantomime their suffering and angst as though reaching for big, slapstick payoffs. (Think Robin Williams .) But Sandler, who has always gravitated toward anger and self-loathing even in his frat-boy blockbusters, here internalizes all until his performance takes on a muted, idiot-savant quality reminiscent of Peter Sellers  in Being There  or Bill Murray  in Lost in Translation . He's like a passive participant in his own existence, dwelling in the shadows of a faintly remembered past and exploding in frightening arpeggios of rage whenever reality rudely taps him on the shoulder. It's what Paul Thomas Anderson  was trying to get him to do in Punch-Drunk Love before that movie's delusions of aesthetic grandeur got in the way.
Charlie Fineman is the sort of troubled but good-hearted character that Hollywood  movies yearn to heal or redeem, and Reign Over Me offers up its potential savior in the form of Charlie's former dental-school roommate, Alan Johnson  (Don Cheadle ), who bumps into Charlie by accident one night and slowly starts to reconnect with his traumatized friend, who in turn lets Alan into his worldprovided, of course, he makes no mention of Charlie's loss. The two men bond because Alan, in his own way, feels unmoored in life, despite the loving wife (Jada Pinkett Smith ) and two picture-perfect daughters. On some level, he envies Charlie's freedom and regressed adolescence, no matter the steep price he's had to pay for them. And when Alan finally does acknowledge the elephant in Charlie's psychological living room, it's not because he's devised a magic solution to make the pain go away, but merely out of compassion for a wayward fellow traveler. Reign Over Me is the ninth feature film directed by Binder, who usually writes and acts in his movies too (here he plays Sandler's business manager, Sugarman), and whose hit-or-miss résumé includes everything from a classically executed British farce (The Search for John Gissing  ) to a direct-to-video Ben Affleck  vehicle (Man About Town ). He's an unmistakably original voice, even if his films too often feel as though they were scripted in one unfiltered marathon session. Like his 2005 picture The Upside of Anger , which surrounded its thoughtful depiction of midlife crisis and romance with an inexplicable murder mystery and oodles of prurient sexuality, Reign Over Me takes its own series of superfluous detours, including one recurring bit about Cheadle's efforts to fend off a nympho patient that feels like a discarded subplot from Binder's canceled HBO  sitcom, The Mind of the Married Man .
The upside of Binder, though, is that he rarely goes where you're expecting, which in the case of Reign Over Me means a straight-faced third act that is surprisingly honest and unsentimental about survivor guilt, mental illness, and the inability of time (or therapy or Hollywood movies) to heal certain wounds. This, I suspect, will provide little consolation to those in the front office at Columbia Pictures , who have grown fat on the profits of Sandler's Big Daddy , Mr. Deeds , and 50 First Dates , or to hormonal teenagers scouring the marquee for a good make-out movie. But it should finally lay to rest the question of whether or not Adam Sandler is to be taken seriously I mean, Seriously.
