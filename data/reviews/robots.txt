The Saturday morning screening was packed with the appropriate audience � little tykes, their faces happily stuffed with popcorn � and they seemed appreciative. But a crucial error was made, in my mind at least, when they screened the preview for Ice Age 2
 prior to the main feature, Robots
 (which is the latest animated feature from Ice Age
 directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha). All it took to get me giggling helplessly was a slim couple of minutes of the continuing adventures of Scrat, Ice Age
�s hapless squirrel/rat, forever thwarted in his efforts to retrieve an acorn. It�s hard to put it into words � even more so considering Scrat charms entirely through grunts, squeaks, and shrieks � but there�s something there, that elusive quality of magic. You know it when you see it, and while I searched mightily for it in Robots
, nothing ever had me giggling again as did Scrat in his two-minute trailer. Set in a land populated entirely by, you got it, robots, Robots
 tells the story of a boy from the �burbs who conquers the big city. Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by McGregor) and his family don�t have much � Rodney  has to suffer the indignity of his female cousin�s hand-me-down parts � but what they lack in buck they make up for in pluck. As a wide-eyed young robot, Rodney idolizes inventor and philanthropist Big Weld (voiced by Brooks), who preaches that "anyone can shine, no matter what they�re made of"; nearing the end of adolescence, Rodney decides to go to the big city and show Big Weld one of his own inventions. Turns out he�s a bit late: Big Weld has retreated to his playland palace and handed the company reins over to the scheming, preening Phineas T. Ratchet (voiced by Kinnear). Phineas has instated a new slogan at HQ � "Why be you when you can be new?" � and has abolished old parts, meaning the have-nots are destined for meltdown unless Rodney can save the day. There�s something cheekily subversive there in making the bad guy, more or less, a Madison Avenue suit; co-directors Wedge and Saldanha did much the same in Ice Age
 by slipping in a pro-ecology, pro-vegetarian message. But where Ice Age
 was spare, even elegant at times, Robots
 is a terrible clutter, in both visual and story terms. The landscape is gosh-wow but so chaotic and overdrawn it�s hard to appreciate the obvious artistry on display, and the story is crammed with too many wise-cracking characters, very few of whom linger long on the brain. The movie can be funny in fits, but too often the scripters go for the obvious and uninspired (call me an old grump, but robots perfecting the underarm fart is strictly bargain-bin material). Robots
 nails the message � and it�s a worthy one � but the magic�s missing in action.


The no-fuss titles of children's movies in the last decade suggest the films were made at a cannery. All the guesswork is gone. A name like ''Toy Story" guarantees you won't be getting a story about pots and pans. It's a safe bet that ''Shark Tale" won't have a lot to do with, say, giraffes. Pixar
 promises ''Cars" in 2006. Surely ''Sneakers," ''School Supplies," and ''Video Games" must be right around the corner.
This time, 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky animation studios have given us ''Robots," a funny, vividly made technorama that is always splendid to look at. The name may be generic, but the detailed imagination powering it is not.
The story and its outcome hold no surprises: A tall, doll-like robot named Rodney Copperbottom (the ebullient Americanized voice of Ewan McGregor) leaves his mom and dad in Rivet Town to make his dream of becoming an inventor in Robot City come true.
But David Lindsay-Abaire and the veteran screenwriting partners Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have built in a smart class parable about consumerism, too. Rodney wants to show his ideas to his inventor hero, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), whose corporation, Rodney discovers, has been taken over by Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), a sleek corporate meanie who has forced Bigweld into a retirement of sorts. Profits at Bigweld's company have flattened, and Ratchet's plan to make money is to do away with the sale of simple, cheap robot parts and instead sell fancy upgrades. Ratchet's new anti-parts campaign even has a slogan: ''Why be you when you can be new!"
Luxury will become a necessity, and those who can't afford it (the ''outmodes") get shipped, in their obsolescence, to a hellish, subterranean, scrap metal chop shop run by Ratchet's grotesque mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent).
Apparently, robots fall apart all the time. But now, if all they require is a tightened wing nut or new valve, they have to go in for full-body makeovers. So Rodney, with his urgently needed mechanical genius, becomes the equivalent of the small-town doctor who takes on a healthcare giant. The climactic showdown, meanwhile, between the outmodes and Ratchet's deadly mastodon-size machines is probably too much like the final battle sequence from one of those ''Matrix" sequels, but it doesn't last nearly as long.
Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, who improve on their last outing, 2002's ''Ice Age," ''Robots" is a combination of old-school and ultramodern ideas of how the future will look. For instance, Rodney and his colorful outmode friends, who were designed by the children's writer and illustrator William Joyce, look like vintage-toy tin men. The upgrades are mysteriously shiny and generically attractive, like some fashion models and Sub-Zero refrigerators.
''Robots" is also an opportunity for its stars to cut up. Paul Giamatti has a field day as a jesting toy sentinel at company headquarters. And Robin Williams, who plays Fender, a hapless, aimless robot who befriends Rodney, reminds us that his antic shtick is best in cartoons. The rest of the cast, which includes Halle Berry, Drew Carrey, Jennifer Coolidge, and Amanda Bynes, is fun, too.
The two most impressive and intricate sequences in ''Robots" -- one involving a billion loosed marbles and another a zillion toppled dominoes -- really have nothing to do with anything. The filmmakers are just showing off. But they're also incredibly inspired.
In 2003, ''Ice Age" lost the animated-feature Academy Award to Hayao Miyazaki's ''Spirited Away," and the folks responsible for ''Robots" seem to have taken some visual ideas from the anime auteur. ''Robots" isn't as trippy, scary, handmade-looking, or environmentally aware as some of Miyazaki's pictures. But it shares their dreaminess. Even at its most ingenious, not even Pixar does that.

         "Robots," the new animated kids' feature from 20th Century Fox, is cute, clangy, hyperactive, really shiny, completely inorganic (except for the flatulence jokes) and totally hermetic. The robots exist in a sealed universe in which everything is made of metal. It's slightly disorienting and hermeneutically impenetrable, like spending time inside a pinball machine rigged to question objective reality.
 
  For one thing, the characters aren't materially different from their neighborhood fire hydrants, coffeepots or wristwatches. The good guys have been humanizingly "antiqued," and the bad guy is suitably chrome-plated, but even though they're created, they have no Creator. (Or do they?) Chris Wedge, who directed "Robots," says he wanted to make "a mechanical universe ... a totally created world," but as for there being "no reference points we could draw from" in creating it — well, er, ahem. Like its characters, "Robots" seems assembled from previously owned parts and spare cultural flotsam. For the postmodern grown-up, it will double as a vigorous spot-the-reference workout. The wink to Kubrick, I'm pretty sure, will whiz over the average 5-year-old head, as will the Brazilian wax reference and the extended allusion to death camps. But nods to "Star Wars" and Britney Spears are crowd-pleasers. Still, if I'm going to get beaned by this many free-floating cultural references, I'm going to need a helmet.
 


         






    The story of a bright-eyed small-town robot who sets out to find the mechanical wizard of a gleaming utopian metropolis called Robot City, "Robots" gets its engine from "The Wizard of Oz" (the Tin Man has a cameo), which it reinterprets as a postindustrial, consumer-age parable about remaining true to yourself even if you resemble a 1950s kitchen appliance.
 
  Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), a robot built from hand-me-down parts, sets off to try to get a job with his hero, the industrialist inventor Bigweld (Mel Brooks), after his dishwashing father is humiliated by his boss. (Dad wanted to be a musician, but his parents had him retrofitted with a thoracic Maytag.)
 
  Modeled on an old-timey entrepreneur of the early 1900s, Bigweld lives by the motto: "See a need, fill a need." Like Oz's Wizard, he's the one man who can help Rodney save his dad from his dehumanizing grind. On the day Rodney arrives in Robot City, he interrupts Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), a slinky MBA type who has pushed Bigweld into early retirement, laying out his corporate mission statement/dastardly plan to a boardroom full of cowed drones and one smart, beautiful robot named Cappy (Halle Berry). "If we keep telling robots they're fine the way they are," Ratchet bellows, "how can we expect them to feel crummy enough about themselves to buy upgrades?" Ratchet wants to stop manufacturing replacement parts and plans to change the company's motto to "Why be you when you can be new?"
 
  Meanwhile, Rodney has befriended a ragtag team of scroungers — Fender (Robin Williams), his little sister Piper (Amanda Bynes) and their crew — who set out with him to find their savior. What, exactly, are we to make of the movie's populist-pro-labor-free-to-be-you-and-me message of personal empowerment, which seems to be the moral of so many corporate-sponsored fairy tales these days? Nothing, really. That's the thing about free-floating cultural references these days: They really do just float.
 
  There's some irony — possibly intentional — in the fact that mechanical characters are enacting a movie plot so ubiquitous it's beginning to seem compulsory (small-town rube makes good, vanquishes corporate, formerly industrial, menace, saves his race) and reinforce the morals of the story — morals which, I'm pretty sure, it's now against the law not to drive home: Be yourself, be different, dream big, never give up, follow your bliss.
 
  It's tricky to try to piece together a cohesive narrative from the scraps of meaning lying around all over the place. I mean, even the most superficial interpretation of the story leads to weird, incongruous places. Ratchet's plan doesn't just end with milking the robots of Robot City of all their money, see. His mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), who dwells in an underground dungeon with a large furnace in it, wants to sweep up all the outmoded robots and melt them down into upgrades. Gracious, Dorothy, whatever could it mean? That, throughout history, and even to this day, innocent people have been rounded up and slaughtered in huge numbers for no reason ... so, um, just be yourself?
 
  Not that there aren't flashes of brilliance. As Fender, Robin Williams deflates some of the unadulterated idealism that nonetheless prevails in the end. "Back off!" he yells at the Outmodes who crowd around Rodney after they discover he can fix them, "He's got his own dreams that won't come true!"
 
  Everything is relative in "Robots." In that way, Wedge's manufactured universe resembles modern life more than the parallel universes of, say, "Ice Age." Even digitally rendered anthropomorphized animals' lives are governed by rules. But Rodney the Robot, like the average Information Age kid, lives in a swirl of mixed messages and marketing flattery, in which making a success of yourself and being a pop star and saving the world are all part of the same package. "You can shine no matter what you're made of," Bigweld says on TV, and Rodney turns to his dad. "He's talking to me, Dad." "He sure is, son," Dad says. He sure is.

Sophisticated and eye-tickling as it is, computer animation can delight an audience simply by the uncanny, nearly sculpted way that it makes intangible physical objects look miraculously real. Toy Story , the feature-length debut of the form, ushered us into a magical realm by mirroring the glossy synthetic sheen of plastic playthings, and Ice Age , with its zigzag-cracked glaciers, was a winter-world fantasy as tactile as a virtual-reality ride.
In a similar spirit, Robots , the second film from the Ice Age  team, is all about the metal. In this zippy, enjoyable sci-fi slapstick jamboree, the main characters aren't sleek and shiny digital droids. They're nuts-and-bolts contraptions that look as if they'd been put together by a deranged mechanic working with whatever he happened to find on his garage floor. Early on, Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), the gee-whiz hero, isn't born, exactly. He's built like an appliance, assembled right out of the box by his parents. Rodney, who grows bigger but still looks like he was made out of several old vacuum cleaners, leaves home to seek his fortune as an inventor in Robot City, which is like a Shanghai Oz designed by Frank Gehry entirely out of gleaming alloys. There, he befriends a group of misfit robots who might have been banged together out of even scrappier Erector sets than he was.
Fender (Robin Williams), their motormouth leader, has a head like an ancient steam whistle, and Piper Pinwheeler (Amanda Bynes) tosses pigtails that look like twin discarded light fixtures. There's a bot with break-dance moves as smooth as his body is chunky, and one with a torso like a car radiator grill. Most of the characters in Robots  have at least a few screws loose  literally. These walking, talking piles of junk don't look or feel like the pop-fantasy robots of the '50s, that heyday of technological optimism. If anything, their designs harken back to the clunkier, more primitive shapes of the '40s, when the dream of mechanized middle-class living was still in embryonic form. Watching them, you feel as if you could reach out and touch their rivets and mechanical eyebrows, their ancient sprockets and corroded paint jobs.
Robots  is a high-tech marvel of low-tech love. The fluky charm of its chop-shop aesthetic is the embodiment of its theme, which is that individuality in robots is a good thing, even if it's being stamped out by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), a towering corporate mama's boy with a pinstripe-suit torso conjoined  to his head, which is composed of razory layered symmetrical plates. He represents the new world of impersonal fascist design, and he's behind a plot to trash the ''outmodes'' by denying them the spare parts they need. Robots is a fable of old-school values under siege: The bots' war for access to those spare parts could almost be a commentary on our health-care system, and Ratchet and his cronies, who look about as organic as tinsel Christmas trees, are like the metallurgic products of cosmetic-surgery ''perfection.'' (Ratchet's mother, who resembles a Jabba the Hutt built out of moving wrenches, makes it clear he must have had a makeover.)
Robots  is crammed with madcap detail. There are terrific bits, like the ingenious (and utterly nonsensical) Rube Goldberg ride that Fender and Rodney take in a spherical public-transport cage, or the ritual drinking of morning ''coffee'' (i.e., hot grease poured over a robot's body). Mel Brooks is the voice of Bigweld, the famous inventor whose company has been taken over by Ratchet, and the animators wed Brooks' raspy, grandpa-mensch delivery to the vision of a giant silver art deco Pac-Man that rolls into rooms.
Overall, however, the visual comedy isn't nearly as unhinged as it might be. Considering the playful funkiness of its images, Robots  is too rote and square in the script department. Robin Williams, doing his first voice in an animated feature since the ADD genie of Aladdin (1992), makes Fender a likable enough sidekick, but the actor, disappointingly, spends most of the film in second gear. As appealing as it is, Robots  lacks the stoned crackpot wit of, say, Shrek 2  or The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie , not to mention the virtuosic dazzle of The Incredibles .
Yet the movie bops along with a happy, jumping, kinetic vitality. Is it a coincidence that R2-D2 looks as if he would fit right in with the misfit bots? Robots  has visual motifs that echo back through the entire history of robots, from the Tin Man to the jerry-built cutups of MST3K. For adults, it's part of the movie's fun to make those nostalgic connections. And also to realize that yesterday's mechanical man of the future has become, for kids, today's mascot of the past.

obots," directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, is a new 3-D computer-animated feature from 20th Century Fox's Blue Sky Studios, the outfit that brought us "Ice Age," and like that movie it's a reminder that when it comes to innovative animated entertainment for all ages, there is Pixar, there is Japan and there is everybody else. Not that "Robots" is bad, exactly. Visually it is fairly impressive, conjuring up a shiny, detailed world of ball bearings, gears, dents and rivets. Some of the jokes - especially a bit at the beginning about the mysteries of robot reproduction - are reasonably witty. The story, however, has been assembled by committee from the pop-culture junkyard: cool music on the soundtrack (including songs by Tom Waits and Fountains of Wayne); celebrity cameo voice-overs (Al Roker, to balance Katie Couric's moment in "Shark Tale" last fall); teary speeches about following your dreams - and of course an annoying sidekick, voiced by Robin Williams, who played a similar role for Chris Rock at the Oscars last month. Secondhandness is the method of "Robots," and also its moral. The Bigweld company, once run by its kindly, roly-poly founder (voiced by Mel Brooks), has been taken over by Ratchet, a gleaming, soulless manager (Greg Kinnear) with a dastardly corporate mission. Encouraged by, for some reason, his clanky, fire-breathing mother, Ratchet wants to take replacement parts off the market and offer expensive "upgrades" instead. The broken-down "outmodes" who cannot afford to remake themselves will be swept off the street and sent to Ma Ratchet's underground furnace. Of course, a plucky band of heroes unites to foil this plan, and the whole story can be read as an allegory of modern Hollywood, in which the imperative is apparently to overthrow the bad guys who want to make new stuff (and their mothers, too), so we can keep recycling the same old charming junk. And to be fair, the look of "Robots" - inspired by the boxy, streamlined look of mid-20th-century cars and kitchen appliances - does have some charm. In the world of computer-generated imagery, metal has clearly replaced water as the great technical challenge. Now that "Shark Tale" and "Finding Nemo" have conquered wetness and scaliness, this movie and the forthcoming "Cars" from Pixar will set new standards for lifelike chrominess. Robot City, a place inspired by Rube Goldberg, "The Jetsons" and "Metropolis" (both the Fritz Lang version and the recent Japanese anime), has impressive scale and variety, and there is a wonderful public-transportation set piece early on that thrillingly bends the laws of physics. In the end, though, "Robots" is hollow and mechanical, an echo chamber of other movies and an awkward attempt to turn the intrinsically scary sensitive-robot theme into something heartwarming and cute. The hero, an aspiring inventor named Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), is a pretty bland fellow, and for all Mr. Williams's vocal antic dialects and in-jokes, he does not breathe much new life into his stock character. In addition to the annoying sidekick, there is a buzzing, chirping, flying coffeepot to fulfill the obligatory cute-pet role. The film is being released both for standard movie screens and in the super-giant Imax format, and the latter version, come to think of it, was a little scary. There have been so many movies lately that warn us that machines are plotting to take over the world. Watching these clanky, smiling, big-eyed contraptions cavorting on an 80-foot screen, I could not help thinking that they had finally succeeded. "Robots" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mechanical mayhem and some humor based on the bodily functions of machines.

Despite a script with more second-hand parts than many of its title characters, "Robots" inspires sufficient wonderment to impress as spectacle and generates enough guffaws to score with every aud segment except the most toon-averse teens. Fox and Blue Sky Studios follow up their 2002 smash "Ice Age" with an even more vividly precise and inventively realized 3-D CGI package that should easily match, and likely surpass, previous pic's $176 million domestic gross. (Day-and-date release of Imax version certainly will boost B.O. numbers.) Overseas and homevid biz will be nothing short of turbocharged.
Working from concepts and character designs he initially hatched with William Joyce, author of popular children's books who gets producer and production designer credits, helmer Chris Wedge leads an army of CGI wizards in the remarkably detailed rendering of a planet inhabited entirely by mechanical creatures.
In the world according to "Robots," immense cityscapes appear co-designed by Fritz Lang and Rube Goldberg, incorporating everything from art deco to futurism, '30 kitchen appliances to '50s auto tailfins. Multitudes of mechanicals are balkanized according to class, divisions are maintained in multilevel urban environments and public-transportation systems resemble super-sized pinball machines.
Trouble is, the narrative that drives the colorful characters through this eye-popping wonderland is something short of piping-hot fresh. To be sure, the scenario, credited to playwright David Lindsay-Abaire and vet scripters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, is serviceable enough as excuse to leap from one visually dazzling scene to the next. But even youngsters will experience a distracting sense of deja vu as familiar plot conflicts and stock characterizations loom large in this brave new world. Overall feeling of "been there, heard that" is reinforced by Robin Williams' typically motor-mouth antics while voicing a key supporting robot.
Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor), a callow young 'bot from the boondocks of Rivet Town, journeys to the vast metropolis of Robot City to find work as an inventor at Bigweld Industries. Unfortunately, Rodney arrives in Robot City just as Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), a corporate mecha-shark, replaces beloved old Bigweld (Mel Brooks) as company chief.
To maximize profits, Ratchet institutes a program to cease manufacturing replacement parts, forcing worn-out robots to buy overpriced upgrade bodies. (New Bigweld ad slogan: "Why be you when you can be new?") Unfortunately, this means aging 'bots who can't afford upgrades -- like Rodney's father, Herb Copperbottom (Stanley Tucci), a dishwasher (yes, a real 
dishwasher) back in Rivet Town -- ultimately will be consigned to scrap heaps. But that's perfectly OK with Ratchet: His malevolent old mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), runs an underground "chop shop" where obsolete and/or unrepairable robots are ripped apart and melted down.
Naturally, unassuming Rodney winds up leading a revolution against Ratchet's chicanery. In this, he receives help from such unlikely allies as Cappy (Halle Berry), a sleek yet scrappy Bigweld exec who rebuffs Ratchet's unwanted advances; Piper (Amanda Bynes), a peppy girl-bot with pigtails shaped like shower heads; Fender (Williams), Piper's older brother, a hyperkinetic hustler who's constantly scrounging to find replacement parts for himself and others; Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge), a motherly 'bot with an immense bottom; and silent Diesel, whose search for a voice box cues a forceful cameo voicing by James Earl Jones.
(Similar cameo vocals are provided by Terry Bradshaw, Dan Hedaya, Jay Leno, Al Roker, Stephen Tobolowsky and Harland Williams.)
It's meant as high praise to say that, very early in "Robots," the extraordinary starts to seem perfectly ordinary. That is, Wedge and his artist-technicians do such a wondrous job of creating and sustaining the illusion of a matter-of-factly amazing world populated with meticulously detailed robots (complete with chipped paint, unsightly dents and other signs of wear and tear) that it's astonishingly easy for aud to quickly accept everything onscreen as, if not reality, then a persuasive facsimile thereof. Just as "The Incredibles" struck many as a rousingly exciting action-comedy that just happened to be an animated feature, "Robots" often achieves the dramatic and emotional impact of the very best live-action sci-fi adventures.
Vocal perfs are first-rate across the board, from McGregor's engaging earnestness as Rodney (whose head resembles a cross between an outboard motor and a faux-retro toaster) to Brooks' robust bombast as the roly-poly Bigweld. And even though much of Williams' shtick sounds recycled from his vocals for "FernGully: The Last Rainforest" and Disney's "Aladdin" franchise, he's undeniably delightful as he cuts loose with riffs on Japanese anime, pop-tart musicvideos and, best of all, the glorious "Singin' in the Rain."
Climactic clash between good and evil feels more chaotic than comedic, but laughs come frequently even during frenetic folderol. Pic overall abounds with clever in-jokey references to other movies -- note the guest appearance by a character from somewhere over the rainbow -- and other instances of sophisticated wit.
On the other hand, pic also includes ample dose of humor aimed at moppet level. Indeed, even though "Robots" is about mechanical creatures, you can rest assured filmmakers find ways to include fart jokes.

Adhering to the Shrek   model for box office success, Robots is an assemblage of clunky puns and canned moralizing, ostensibly made palatable for adults through the addition of random pop culture referencesa robot singing Britney, another plugging Star Wars , everyone quoting liberally from The Wizard of Oz .
Sort of a My First Metropolis , the movie follows dishwasher's son Rodney Copperbottom  (Ewan McGregor ) as he travels to Robot City to proffer an invention to Bigweld (Mel Brooks ), a benevolent CEO vaunted as "the greatest robot in the world." But Rodney arrives to find Bigweld replaced by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear ), a heartless executive diabolically planning to phase out spare parts. Obsolete droids will soon be forced to upgrade or be dismantled. Rodney falls in with the outcastsparticularly a hustler named Fender (Robin Williams )and with the help of corporate insider Cappy (Halle Berry ), he searches for Bigweld, the only droid who can repair Robot City without upsetting quarterly gains.
If The Incredibles  finally made it fashionable to mine cartoons for subtextalbeit three generations after Looney Tunes then Robots , set in a post-boom era, may come to be seen as the more salient allegory. No replacement parts? Read it as a Social Security metaphor. In the movie's frightening economic vision, those who can't pay the rent are literally broken up and melted down. Not that Robots  is hopelessly pessimistic. While the deco-accented animation falls short of awe-inspiring, Robot City's Rube Goldberg  transit system is an endearing take on urban living, suggesting commuting as a daily process of being dropped, tossed, hammered, and spun.
Directed by Chris Wedge  (Ice Age ) with only the shortest attention spans in mind, Robots  is entertaining enough that it leaves one wishing for more in the way of android mythologya pint-sized Blade Runner  or A.I.  The screenplay goes on autopilot, grinding toward a happy ending just when it has a shot at something darker and more memorable. Robots  is a corporate product, after allbut a sleek one.
