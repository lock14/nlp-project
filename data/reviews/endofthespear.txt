If you just read Ty Burr's review of Terrence Malick's "The New World" and are thinking, "I'd to like to see a chattier and somehow more grandiose tale of indigenous peoples and their fragile bond with white outsiders," "End of the Spear" is what you want. It's not remotely as luscious or half as bold as Malick's movie, but it is shorter and more educational.
Set in the Ecuadoran jungle in the Amazon basin, "End of the Spear" re-creates the true story of five nondenominational Christian missionaries who, in 1956, were killed by members of the Aucas tribe. Most of the film is told from the point of view of Steve Saint, the young son of Nathaniel Saint, one of the slain men, who narrates as an adult. Chad Allen plays both grown-up Steve and his dad. The rest of the film is devoted to the Aucas, who after the slaughter changed their name to the Waodani, which is how they're referred to throughout "End of the Spear."
The tribe is a squabbling bunch whose members seem to have no problem fatally impaling one other with spears. This has won them a savage reputation and has also brought them to the brink of extinction. But Nathaniel and his fellow missionaries descend upon the tribe in the hopes of saving it. (The movie was shot in Panama and used the country's Embera Indians and their language to get the film made.)
One Waodani, Gimade (Ninabet Bedoya), is miserable that her sister Dayumae (Christina Souza) has left the tribe. Unbeknownst to her, Dayumae happens to be living happily among the missionaries, who've just landed near the Waodani village. But after one testy tribesman fibs to his chief, Mincayani (Louie Leonardo), that the missionaries ate Dayumae, hell breaks loose and the white men are killed in an unsparing sequence.
Not long after the massacre, however, Dayumae leads Nathaniel's good-hearted widow, little Steve, and the sister of another slain missionary to the Waodani village, where everyone makes amends and lives more or less harmoniously for years. Improbable but -- attesting to the apparent boundlessness of Christian tolerance -- true. "End of the Spear" means to impart messages of forgiveness and forbearance, and, obviously, we are meant to be moved.
But "End of the Spear" is an adventure movie before it is anything else. Last year, the director, Jim Hanon, put out a documentary, "Beyond the Gates of Splendor," that covered the same material. For round two, he seems thrilled to have cranes, Steadicams, and helicopter shots at his disposal. The percussive score pulses and soars like music from a generic jungle flick (it falls into a musical category that Variety recently called "orchestral with ethnic elements").
The characters, however, are not as exhilarating or well conceived as any of the action sequences are well choreographed. This is too bad because the true story is such a fascinating convergence of earnestness and incivility. Hector Babenco's longer, loopier 1991 adaptation of "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" deals with similar travails of Indians and white missionaries in South America, but it actually gets its hands dirty sorting out the religious and moral conflicts. "End of the Spear" is tidier, more didactic, and less exceptional. Not an emotional powerhouse so much as a dutiful public service announcement.

         Scored to a thematic blend of tense jungle drums and choral voices, the slickly produced Christian docudrama "End of the Spear" recounts with spiritual breathlessness the circumstances surrounding the real-life killings of five missionaries at the hands of a violent indigenous Amazon tribe in Ecuador in 1956.
 
  The story doesn't lack for exoticism or scope, but this version has no room for moral thorniness about issues like cultural interference: The Waodani's relentless spear-hurling warfare — depicted with terrifying brio — is a visceral evil, while salvation literally comes from above as the bright yellow Piper plane materializes and bewildered tribespeople crane their necks upward.
 


         






    Director Jim Hanon films the missionaries' shocking deaths with all the martyr-steeped intensity he can muster. But as their widows boldly and beatifically carry the torch of evangelizing (and westernizing) the Waodani — to avoid in-your-face Christianity, the writers substitute talk of God and the Bible with lines like "Waengongi marked his trail with carvings" — what creeps in is the dramatic simple-mindedness attendant with a purity-of-purpose mind-set.
 
  Time is bided until the inevitable images of born-again warriors breaking their weapons in two and, years later, a fatherless son (Chad Allen) forgiving his dad's once-savage/now-pacifist killer (Louie Leonardo). Moviegoers who prefer the sterner "eye for an eye" biblical ethos in their adventure sagas might be disappointed.

In the old Hollywood jungle movies, the white hunters in their pith helmets would enter the deep dark forest, and the primitive tribesmen who captured them and spoke ooga-booga...well, they were natives, and that was all that needed to be said about them. (The 1933 King Kong  participated in this racist cosmology, and there's no denying that's an element of its primal power.) End of the Spear  is more superficially enlightened: It's an ooga-booga movie dressed in ''anthropological'' empathy.
As we follow five American missionaries, who look about as ready for adventure as the Kingston Trio, into the Amazon jungles of Ecuador in 1953, we also see life from the point of view of the Waodani, a violent tribe whose homicide rate has brought them to the verge of extinction. End of the Spear never quite shakes free of presenting the Waodani as the mysterious other  barbarians waiting to be civilized. The missionaries don't hang around long enough to do it, but the movie, which is atrociously scripted and edited, carries out the mission for them, turning Mincayani (Louie Leonardo), a surly and handsome Waodani leader, from killer to saint without making psychological sense of either.

 "End of the Spear," a fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and peace-seeking Christian missionaries (of unidentified denomination) from North America, is inspiring enough to make you wish that the filmmakers had reined in their sentimental excesses.  Robert A. Driskell Jr.'s sumptuous cinematography (the movie was filmed mostly in Panama) makes every raindrop glisten, every leaf appear translucent and every winding river resemble a flowing turquoise train. That physical beauty notwithstanding, the humane message of the film (directed by Jim Hanon and written by Mr. Hanon, Bart Gavigan and Bill Ewing) is undercut by the religio-mythic trappings attached to it, and by an inescapable air of Kiplingesque smugness in its portrayal of civilized whites enlightening rampaging dark-skinned savages. The overawed musical score by Ronald Owen is so obtrusive that it never lets you have a feeling of your own.  The sleek, mostly Latino actors portraying members of the violent Waodani tribe, who achieve peace and harmony with the surviving missionaries after murdering five, are only marginally more authentic than the American Indians played by Hollywood extras in 1950's westerns. Louie Leonardo, the Dominican actor who portrays the tribe's most violent warrior, Mincayani, suggests a less steroidal version of the Rock in his displays of acrobatics and spear-wielding virtuosity.  Much of the drama revolves around the disagreement between Mincayani and his fellow tribesman Kimo (Jack Guzman) about the identity of Dayumae (Christina Souza), a Waodani woman lost to the tribe who has been living with the missionaries and becomes a bridge between the two cultures. Is she a spirit, as Mincayani insists, or a real person?  The story is narrated by Steve Saint (Chad Allen), a solemn young man who returns to the scene of the massacre decades after the murder in 1956 of his father, Nate (also played by Mr. Allen), and four colleagues during a tense first encounter. The missionaries and their families had settled in the Amazon Basin hoping to save the endangered tribe, then known as the Auca, from extinction in deadly intertribal warfare. Because Nate piloted a bright yellow aircraft, which the astonished Waodani identify as "a wooden bee" when it first buzzes overhead, the movie has some gorgeous aerial photography.  "End of the Spear" is a film of few words and no developed characters. Not even the grown-up Steve (his younger self is played by Chase Ellison), who in the film's mawkish climax meets and reconciles with his father's killer, emerges as more than a solemn, self-important mouthpiece.  "End of the Spear" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of violence.

As 2004's "The Passion of the Christ" drove home so emphatically, a great unserved appetite exists for Christian-themed films, so it's no surprise that movies such as director/co-writer Jim Hanon's "End of the Spear" are moving in to fill the void. Pic is based on the real-life 1956 incident in which five American missionaries were killed by a remote Amazonian tribe. The story was reported on at the time by Life magazine photojournalist Cornell Capa. Although overly earnest and often stilted, the film should find great favor principally among religious auds, and a long life on the home-vid shelves.
"End of the Spear" approaches its story primarily as a family drama. Nate Saint (Chad Allen) is the beloved husband of Marj Saint (Cara Stoner) and father of their young son, Steve (Chase Ellison). A skilled pilot, Nate is also devoted to what he sees as his spiritual duty: Finding -- and eventually converting -- an isolated Ecuadorian tribe called the Waodani, whose internecine warfare threatens to exterminate them.
Although exactly how Nate and his 4-member team plan to save the Waodani is not clearly articulated, it involves their spreading the word of God to the natives. But, they are killed almost immediately by the Waodani, whom the filmmakers portray -- not as the noble savages one might expect -- but as ignorant, fearful and, especially, superstitious. The allegorical impulse of the film is to position the missionaries as angelic, and the tribe members, who have yet to hear God's word, as mere savages with Mincayani (Louie Leonardo) the most fierce and resistant of the Waodani.
Lenser Robert Driskell has some spectacular territory to work with (principal photography took place in Panama, rather than the dramatic setting of Ecuador's Amazon basin). But Driskell's work, like many of the film's technical aspects, also involved logistical hurdles, all overcome with aplomb. Aerial work for a scene when Nate takes tribesmen up in a small plane is particularly impressive.
"End of the Spear," with its double-edged title, is a decidedly talky movie, one that gets going only after news of the missionaries' deaths reaches their families, and wives and children move in with the inhospitable tribes people. Narrated by the adult Steve Saint (Allen again), it tells us almost everything we see happening -- but without a lot of resulting illumination.
Likewise, the music by Ronald Owen is unnecessarily, and inappropriately, triumphant, even strident, where it should perhaps be more melancholic; not every move made by the "good" characters requires a heroic fanfare.
"End of the Spear" contains a large amount of violence, although it is a long way from the relentless brutality of "The Passion of the Christ" and violence didn't hurt that movie. Pic is, as one might expect, a far more understated work, although it's primary point is evangelical, all the same.

Coy crypto-Christian claptrap masquerading as feel-good ethnography, End of the Spear  is part missionaries-in-peril potboiler (sans pot) and part Bush-era evangelical screed. It's the kind of oversweet cinematic Kool-Aid  they used to force-feed us in Sunday school, a dramatic retooling of Beyond the Gates of Splendor , a documentary also directed by Jim Hanon  that was marketed to churches. Both films tell the story of five American missionaries who were murdered by members of a remote Ecuadoran tribe while trying to establish contact with them in 1956, and of the subsequent conversion of said tribe to a less self-destructive lifestyle. Spear  has all the earmarks of a middling Indiewood product, from its competent second-tier cast (including Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman   hunklet Chad Allen  in a dual role as a slain missionary and his grown son) to its earnest plotting and leaden pacing. (The many dubious factual embellishments are pure Hollywood .) But Spear  is up to more than just grade-B jungle thrills, and its Davey and Goliath  dogmatism comes through as loud and clear as the sinister subtext behind its message of nonviolencethat the world's nonwhite, "undeveloped" cultures continue to require prophylactic doses of Yank benevolence in order to survive and thrive.
