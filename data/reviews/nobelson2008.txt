Not flagrant enough to be vile, not original enough to be any good, "Nobel Son" does offer a rare opportunity to see Alan Rickman at his worst. It also allows you to admire the astonishingly ageless Mary Steenburgen's ongoing transformation from mouse to fox.
It makes you a little nostalgic for the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well. That's when discombobulated crime thrillers were in vogue. They're not fashionable anymore - if you've seen one over-narrated, over-directed, over-plotted, yet baffling caper with a lot of good actors doing bad things, you've seen them all. Guy Ritchie made a name for himself with scuzz, but even his shtick has exceeded its sell-by date. "Nobel Son" goes further, crossing the contortions of "The Usual Suspects" with the shallowness of certain intellectual family melodramas.
Rickman expectorates and exaggerates as a pompous Los Angeles university physics professor who wins the Nobel Prize. Before his cannibalism-obsessed, PhD-candidate son (Bryan Greenberg) can board the plane to Stockholm, a stranger (Shawn Hatosy, always interesting) kidnaps him, asks for a million-dollar ransom, then overnights dad and mom (Steenburgen) a severed thumb. "Why?" you might ask. But really, why ask why?
Director Randall Miller and co-writer Jody Savin bloat the opening minutes with a checklist of cliches. The frame freezes while characters' names appear typed across the screen. There's pretentious narration (Greenberg quotes Montaigne and - dissertation alert! - speaks of the "Manichean imagination"); then he addresses the camera, whose swinging and spinning is accompanied by whooshing usually reserved for airborne cartoon characters. Oh, there's a dead body that the movie feels compelled to rewind three weeks to explain.
"Nobel Son" has one of those casts that suggest the filmmakers either knew somebody or knew somebody who knew somebody. Bill Pullman has accepted another prematurely crusty role - this time the presiding detective, who's sweet on Steenburgen's forensics lawyer. Eliza Dushku shows up as a crazy, vegetarian, spoken-word-spewing sex-sicle. (Yes, spoken word.) And what are Danny DeVito, Ted Danson, and Ernie Hudson doing here? Honestly? Not much.

In Nobel Son,  Eli Michaelson (Alan Rickman) is a noted chemistry professsor who has just received the Nobel Prize; he's also a lecherous, ill-tempered misanthropic jerk. When the son (Bryan Greenberg) he treats like dirt gets kidnapped by a psychopath (Shawn Hatosy) who is not what he seems, the director, Randall Miller (Bottle Shock ), appears to be trying to cross a bad Elmore Leonard thriller with a bad indie-festival family-angst   comedy. He gives us the worst of both worlds, parading each superficially clever motif   severed thumbs, cannibalism, the magic of Pat Benatar's lyrics  with an amateur's show-off glee.

 At some point Randall Miller, who has directed one movie about ballroom dancing and another about the wine trade — apparently decided he wanted to become a tough guy, or at least flex his genre muscles. Thus “Nobel Son,” an aggressively noisy exercise in style over substance about nasty people doing nasty things to one another in (sigh) Southern California. Like many contemporary genre flicks, the new movie features a hyperactive visual style that owes its tricks and tics, smeared images and staccato cuts to art-house exploitation like “City of God” and latter-day Tony Scott, but without the commensurate technical finesse.  Alan Rickman plays Eli Michaelson, who shortly after the story chugs to a start has won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, a milestone that delights no one save for him. A world-class heel and adulterer, a lousy father (to Bryan Greenberg’s Barkley) and worse husband (to Mary Steenburgen’s Sarah), Eli, with his monstrous ego, would be enough for a lot of movies but turns out to be merely the warm-up act for a chaotic plot involving a violent kidnapping, a distant suicide, murky secrets and outright distortions. Mr. Greenberg, whose character is writing a dissertation about cannibalism (he appears to be pro), somehow crosses paths first with Eliza Dushku and then with Shawn Hatosy, both of whom are better than their material.  Mr. Miller is clearly slumming in “Nobel Son” (it was shot before his recently released “Bottle Shock”), which wouldn’t be a problem if he seemed to be interested in playing with genre rather than condescending to it, as he does here. But from story to casting, “Nobel Son” feels designed for mockery, from the stunt casting (Danny DeVito as a dim-bulb neighbor, Ted Danson as a bow-tied academic) to the lazy parodies of coffeehouse poetry readings to the treatment of poor Ms. Dushku, who, as a wild-eyed poet who sleeps with the nominal hero, not only has to play the crazy woman and a hack artist but also has to brandish her thong underwear. Isn’t being young and female in Hollywood punishment enough?  There’s a bit more, mostly a throbbing techno score and a showy, disappointing performance from the almost always welcome Mr. Rickman. (He and Bill Pullman, who has a small role in this film as the requisite rumpled cop, were the headliners in “Bottle Shock.”) As Eli, Mr. Rickman oozes from scene to scene doing a fair approximation of a lizard with a little Joan Crawford thrown in for good (or bad) measure. Although it’s amusing to watch him point his nose in the air while taking aim at the ostensibly nicer characters, all of whom are even more tedious than Eli, the performance grows thin fast. Even lizards and villains need a perch, something more solid than noise and smears from which they can do their slithering.  “Nobel Son” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). One scene features the very bloody, nonsurgical removal of a thumb.

Accusing "Nobel Son" of being over-the-top is like complaining the circus is too colorful. Flamboyance, in all its generic guises, at times seems to be the very raison d'etre
 behind Randall Miller's kidnapping thriller. Least effectively, such ostentation yields Danny DeVito's obsession-compulsion, strange character names and one-line backstories. Most prepossessingly, though, it flaunts Alan Rickman as a Nobel-winning scientist whose outrageous egomania lifts the pic far above the three-ring dog-and-pony-show. Uneven but enjoyably titillating black comedy should elate Rickman fans while pleasing aficionados of extra-flakey caper flicks. 
Professor Eli Michaelson (Rickman) has just been awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. The endowment transforms the prof's already insufferable narcissism into outright arrogance. For the rest of Michaelson clan, the Swedish coronation only adds insult to injury.
Helmer Miller and co-writer/wife Jody Savin, whose work ("Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School") has tilted toward the sweet and sentimental, here throw themselves into twisted villainy with gusto. Even the good characters, like Mary Steenburgen's Sarah, Rickman's long-suffering wife by night and a forensic pathologist by day, harbor unexpected depths of deviousness.
Michaelson's callow son Barkley (Bryan Greenberg), sole offspring and bitter disappointment (having chosen the social sciences), is finishing up his thesis on cannibalism (when, we wonder, will the gag pay off?) and trying to subsist on a measly paternal stipend of $35 a week. After a date with a weirdo poetess named City Hall (the irresistibly sexy Eliza Dushku), he is kidnapped.
Enter Thaddeus James (Shawn Hatosy), abductor, mechanical genius and advanced chemistry autodidact, claiming to be Barkley's illegitimate half-brother. Thaddeus alternately threatens and cajoles Barkley into joining him in his multimillion-dollar kidnap/extortion/revenge plot against their father.
With more story twists than a designer pretzel -- including an anonymous amputated thumb and a gratuitous corpse in a bathtub -- the adrenalin-fueled pic thankfully slows to a halt after only a few to many loop-de-loops. 
Tech credits maintain the film's momentum throughout, Paul Oakenfold and Mark Adler's techno-beat rhythms pumping up the action with occasional breaks for irony. Michael Ozier's multi-angled lensing favors colorfully expressionistic backdrops to highlight Miller's boldly sardonic editing.

Directionless PhD candidate Barkley (Bryan Greenberg ) lives in the shadow of his overbearing genius father, Eli (Alan Rickman ), who is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize. That's when two seemingly unrelated events occur: Barkley beds a gorgeous artist named City Hall (Eliza Dushku ) and gets kidnapped by Thaddeus (Shawn Hatosy ), an unhinged young man who wants to hold Barkley for ransom. Barkley convinces Thaddeus to include him in the plan, excited at the prospect of fleecing his old man. Anyone who suffered through the Tarantino knockoffs of the 1990s knows that no filmic crime caper will run smoothly, but director and co-writer Randall Miller  is so ill at ease with the basic building blocks of the genre that Nobel Son  quickly announces itself as one of those misbegotten clunkers where almost every creative decision isn't just wrong but tone-deaf. Nobel Son 's desperately "edgy" vibe extends to all aspects of the film but is most noticeable in the cavalcade of flip one-liners delivered by a cast that's been told to give their characters maximum quirkiness. The more experienced actors mostly keep their dignity, but the younger cast members—particularly Dushku as a blank femme fatale and Greenberg as the charmless antihero—posture insufferably. For Miller, this dark thriller represents an attempt to shift gears after back-to-back feel-good films Bottle Shock  and Marilyn Hotchkiss ' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School . He's succeeded in a way: Nobel Son  just feels awful.
