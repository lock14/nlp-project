There's no other woman acting today that even remotely resembles Parker Posey. For that matter, there's never been anyone quite like her that I can think of. She has the dynamite improvisational instincts of a born grifter who wandered too far from one con and ended up in another � acting � and her tricky-risky game of onscreen three-card monte is, again and again, a jewel in indie filmmaking's oft-tattered crown. She's the best reason to see this wild, borderline screwball sequel to Hal Hartley's 1998 Henry Fool
, in which Posey played Fay, a firecracker nymphomaniac married to a slouchy, genius writer � the Fool of the title (Ryan). It helps matters if you've seen the earlier film, but Fay Grim
 has a lunatic charm all its own, with nearly all of Henry Fool
's cast returning, including the sublimely self-contained Urbaniak, as Fay's brother, Simon Grim, a former garbageman whose life-changing encounter with Fool in Fool
 resulted in no small epiphany, one for which he is currently in prison, having switched identities with his literary mentor (there was a murder, of sorts), while the real Fool's gone on the lam for the past decade. Fay, a single mother to a smart, tenuous little chip off the old man named Ned (and here Lemony Snicket
's 17-year-old Aiken very nearly runs away with the film's emotional center), is just looking to connect … in Posey's lip-gnawing, brassy way. Then the FBI appears in the form of Goldblum, first to announce the death of Henry, then to embroil Fay in what can only be accurately called "international intrigue." There are duplicitous, bizarre schemes involving not Fay but the missing (or dead?) Fool, but he's really just a loudmouth MacGuffin around which orbits Posey's Fay, eclipsing everyone she encounters, including Burrows as a double agent and Nadja
's L�wensohn as Henry's Euro-squeeze. If it sounds like a lot to swallow, it is; Goldblum doesn't so much devour the scenery as molest it, his lanky Semitic frame and Cronenberg eyes making easy sport of a character whose clownish authority plays like one of Kurt Weill's earnest oddball strays. Hartley's film doesn't match up to the cockamamy punch of its predecessor, but it's enough to see Posey run riot through the director's skewed visions. Even in a hail of gunfire, she makes you grin, helplessly.


Like normal people, artists can lose their way. The cultural baton gets passed, or maybe their creative juices run dry. When that happens, they tend to revisit their moment of greatest impact: Thus "The Godfather: Part III ," Steely Dan reunion albums, and "Return to Gilligan's Island." The Beatles called it getting back, and it didn't work for them either.
With "Fay Grim," the gifted, frustrating indie auteur Hal Hartley tries to get back and move forward at the same time. This is how people get whiplash.
The new movie picks up 10 years after his most lauded film, 1997's "Henry Fool ," left off. Hartley carefully reintroduces the characters and their dilemmas: the fraudulent rascal Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan ) is still on the lam in Europe; Simon Grim (James Urbaniak ), the garbageman-turned-Nobel-laureate poet, is in jail for abetting his escape; Fay Grim (Parker Posey ) lives off her brother's royalties while raising Henry's son Ned (Liam Aiken ), a sleepy-eyed malcontent.
It's still not clear why we're here, but OK . Then Hartley dumps everything we knew about these people, switching genres from a small-scale drama of art and morality to an international thriller with global complications that spin off the chart. This is something like setting a sequel to "Little Miss Sunshine " on a submarine and asking the cast to deliver their lines in Esperanto. Why go to the trouble if you're going to start from scratch anyway?
The answer is: Artist's prerogative. Judging from Hartley's last movie, 2005's little-seen futuristic fantasy "The Girl From Monday ," the director has moved from the deadpan suburban miniatures that served him well for so many years to a more ambitious canvas. The problem is that he isn't sure what he wants to paint there.
"Fay Grim" begins with severely off-kilter camera angles as Fay learns that her husband's fabled "Confessions," the dreadful novel he was obsessively writing, is actually a memoir of his years in the CIA, doing nasty things in every foreign hotspot of the last 20 years. Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Tibet -- Henry had a hand in them all. The pope threw a chair at his head once. How this squares with the drunken schlub of "Henry Fool" doesn't bear asking.
Now a former colleague, Agent Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum ), wants the manuscript back and packs Fay off to Europe to collect it. At this point, "Fay Grim" becomes an arthouse espionage movie in which everyone talks in flat, ironic Hartleyese while changing sides every other scene. French bureaucrats, Muslim terrorists, Israeli secret service hit ladies, Estonian stewardesses-turned-strippers-turned-spies -- all troop through a film that exchanges the dry attitude of its director's early work for cluttered incident.
There are pleasures here nevertheless. A subplot in which Simon and Ned investigate the provenance of a small pornographic viewing device that leads to Turkey and possibly to Henry himself has a playful air of discovery. The ghost of Borges and other literary pranksters flit through when someone raises the notion that the "Confessions" might be written in code, with "Paradise Lost " as concordance.
But "Fay Grim" also exudes a sense of exhaustion that wells up out of the film and spills over onto the seats. A paradise has
 been lost -- maybe it's the old world order, before the events of the last five years, or 30 years, or 100. Whichever, Hartley never is able to take its measure, and its complexities daunt him.
He does dump Fay in the midst of it all -- a naive American out of "The Third Man " -- and watches as she grows in stature and spine. This is a curious role for Posey, lacking the elegant cruelty that's her most natural posture, and it requires her to shift gradually from grumpy passivity to a radiant sense of purpose. She does this so well you don't notice the transformation until it's complete.
Still, to what end? What's Fay committing to
? Like Henry, or like the idea of him, the movie's larger point is always receding from sight over the horizon. "Fay Grim" falls victim to its own worried hyperactivity; it shuts you out with chattery paranoia. Hartley wants us to see the big picture, but he forgets we need artists like him to bring it into focus.


         Hal Hartley's dark comedy "Henry Fool" was an indie masterpiece that effectively and accessibly meshed Hartley's literary influences with his specific minimalist style and some of the most memorable characters of the last decade. Now, Hartley takes the characters he created for that world and launches them into a surprisingly different direction in "Fay Grim," a worthy follow-up and rare art house sequel.
 
 "Fool," released in 1998, was a leap forward for Hartley, building on his quirkier early work and taking it to a more substantial place. Featuring stage actors James Urbaniak and Thomas Jay Ryan as Simon Grim and Henry Fool, respectively, the film turned on the awakening of garbage man Simon's hidden poetic talents that bloomed under the urging of the Faustian drifter, Henry, whose lowly status and appearance belied his epic braggadocio. The Beckettesque duo, along with Parker Posey as Simon's sister Fay, who becomes the title character in the new movie, gave physical life to Hartley's complex and unabashedly intelligent characters.
 


         






   When we last saw our antiheroes, Simon had won the Nobel Prize for his profane and controversial poetry, Henry had fled murder charges by allegedly going to Stockholm using Simon's passport, and Fay was left with a young son after Henry had impregnated and married her seven years earlier. The handwritten, multipart opus Henry had been flouting, "The Confessions of Henry Fool," was largely thought to be a horrible novel, literary excrement perpetuated by a vulgar man with a vivid imagination.
 
 In "Fay Grim," it is another seven years later and Henry's still missing, Simon is in prison for abetting his escape and Fay is concerned that her 14-year-old son, Ned (Liam Aiken), is turning into his father. Fay is quickly dragged into a wild game of international espionage and the duality of her love-hate relationship with Henry re-emerges.
 
 Posey gets to reprise one of her best roles, the deeply loyal Fay, whose faith drives this film. She may need a small "How to Pray" card in order to deliver a simple prayer, but she's a strong woman, intensely protective of her family. Her love for Henry, despite the fact she is simultaneously repelled by his repugnancy and incorrigible behavior, enables her to go forward even while being completely in the dark as to what is happening around her. Hartley has described the character as a "representative well-intentioned American who is, however, ill-informed," but Posey adds to her a stylish sexiness that makes her down-to-earth qualities even more attractive.
 
 In a bold, cleverly executed move, Hartley has taken this character from the insular, emotionally claustrophobic environment of Woodside, Queens, and successfully migrated her, exploding her world to include Paris, Istanbul and points in between. A sophisticated, sometimes intentionally silly spy thriller of international intrigue, "Fay Grim" charts the history of American foreign policy while commenting on current global complications with wink and a nudge.
 
 Mostly off-screen, Henry begins to take shape as a Zelig figure, popping up in all the political hot spots of the 1970s and '80s, leaving behind a cryptic trail in his writings that a whole lot of people would like to erase. That neither Henry nor the "Confessions" are what they appeared to be in "Henry Fool" only adds to the delights to be found in "Fay Grim."
 
 Action sequences accomplished with freeze-frames that look as if they were ripped from some avant-garde German fashion magazine form a stop-motion ballet, visually energizing the beautifully shot (by Sarah Cawley Cabiya) high-definition film. Askew camera angles fuel the fear, paranoia and surprisingly tense pace.
 
 In an inspired bit of casting, Jeff Goldblum — whose own stop-start delivery mixes  well with Hartley's trademark deadpan banter — joins the party as a U.S. government agent who persuades Fay to travel to Europe to collect several missing volumes of Henry's "Confessions" which have unexpectedly emerged. On the continent, Fay becomes a pinball pawn bouncing among a slew of foreign agents and assassins, including Saffron Burrows as a long-legged Israeli and Hartley regular Elina Löwensohn as a shadowy figure of dubious origin.
 
 The films of Hartley have always been lyrical, full of harmonious touches ranging from the rhythm of his dialogue, and the quality of his visual compositions to the music he uses, often composed by the writer-director himself under the name Ned Rifle. They also often follow an almost absurdist formalism.
 
 Although "Fay Grim" is clearly of a piece with his previous films, it marks new generic territory for the filmmaker. "Amateur" had aspects of the Hitchcockian thriller, but this film feels like Hartley has been handed a Bourne or a Bond movie to direct and maintained his own style and low-budget aesthetic while thoroughly enjoying and deconstructing his new toy.

At first, it looks as though Hal Hartley, that quirky/annoying maestro of the put-on pensée , has finally entered the real world. In Fay Grim , his continuation of Henry Fool  (1998), Parker Posey's Fay, estranged wife of the gloomy, drunken bohemian nihilist Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), is arm-twisted by the CIA into locating his confessional notebooks. The tomes may contain scandalous political secrets, but don't be fooled: The faux espionage plot, with its winks at terrorism, is really just a convoluted plea for the relevance of precious indie artistes (i.e., Hal Hartley).

 “You’re a good woman, Fay,” declares Jallal (Anatole Taubman), an Osama bin Laden surrogate. “Someday when all this is over and we have destroyed Western civilization. ...” he continues, without finishing the sentence.  Jallal’s dream girl, played by Parker Posey, is the title character of Hal Hartley’s spy spoof “Fay Grim,” and his come-on distills the facetiously deadpan tone of this laborious sequel to Mr. Hartley’s 1998 cult film, “Henry Fool.”  Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, “Fay Grim” belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. As self-referential in their way as the works of Guy Maddin or David Lynch, movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders.  You may not remember “Henry Fool,” Mr. Hartley’s allegorical sendup of literary celebrity that won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1998 and was hailed by some as a landmark of independent cinema. Its cult status owes as much to Mr. Hartley’s reputation as a free-spirited one-man band working with minimal resources as it does to its artistic merits.  “Henry Fool,” which skewered fame-mongering and the deification of art, was a whimsical mock epic but had enough of a soul to make you care about its cast of oddball eccentrics from Woodside, Queens. Since then Mr. Hartley, now based in Berlin, has filmed several smaller, quirky fables that registered only as faint blips on the radar of international cinema. With “Fay Grim,” filmed in high-definition video in New York, Paris and Istanbul, he updates the “Henry Fool” characters (played by the same actors) as they converge in one of the most convoluted spy stories ever concocted.  Seven years have passed since Fay’s husband, the no-talent novelist Henry Fool, fled the United States with the help of Fay’s brother, the Nobel Prize-winning poet Simon Grim (James Urbaniak), after accidentally killing a man. Simon is serving a 10-year prison sentence for aiding and abetting. Fay, still living in Woodside, is raising her sullen 14-year-old son, Ned (Liam Aiken), who is expelled from school for showing his classmates a pornographic movie on a hand-cranked toy viewer that mysteriously arrived by mail.  Fay’s life is upended by a visit from Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum), a grim C.I.A. officer who produces evidence that before she married him, Henry was a spy working the hot spots of the world from South America to Europe to the Middle East. Henry’s “Confessions,” which were deemed to be of no literary value, are suddenly a hot property. They may be coded, top-secret texts that could threaten national security.  Henry’s whereabouts are unknown. If he’s dead, Fay — played by Ms. Posey as a flouncing, vinegary, thoroughly modern woman who is the antithesis of the damsels in distress and slinky double agents usually found in spy movies — will have legal possession of his notebooks. She agrees to fly to Paris to retrieve them if Simon is immediately released from prison.  The two-hour film flashes back and forth from Fay’s journey — which takes her from Paris to Istanbul and during which she is besieged by gun-toting spies and counterspies from several different countries — and Woodside, where experts try to decode one stray notebook from clues found in the movie in the toy viewer.  While deftly working the visual tropes of the spy-thriller genre, “Fay Grim” carries them into the realm of the absurd. With an endless plot whose details and reversals are laid out in indigestible gobs of exposition, it suggests an uneasy fusion of “Syriana,” “Casino Royale,” “Zelig” and “The Da Vinci Code,” with an Austin Powers smirk. But beneath its mockery, the movie is a commentary on the rampant paranoia that grips the post-9/11 world.  Mr. Goldblum’s humorless intelligence agent is a demented logician whose thinking is so contorted that everything and everyone is presumed to be part of a vast terrorist conspiracy. Mr. Goldblum invests Fulbright with an owl-eyed gravity that suggests a caricature of the Dick Cheney mind-set.  But “Fay Grim” gets so carried away with the intricacies of its plot that it gets lost in its own excessive cleverness. In the decade since “Henry Fool,” it implies, fear has driven the United States stark raving mad.  “Fay Grim” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and some sexuality. 

Hal Hartley tries to get his mojo back in "Fay Grim," an eight-years-on sequel to his best film, "Henry Fool." The dexterous literary voice is present in force, the performances tart and the use of high def among the best yet on a limited-budget bigscreen feature. But the purposely overwrought, archly acerbic tone has drifted into facetiousness which combines with an ever-more far-fetched plot to the point where the picture seems to disappear around the dark side of the moon. Hartley's always-modest fan base has retreated so far after his last two, scarcely seen efforts, "No Such Thing" and "The Girl From Monday," that it will likely take more than this to win them back.
An indie stalwart during the '90s, Hartley used a talent for skewed dialogue and warm visuals to build a following among a bright, sophisticated public. Since leaving the States (he now lives in Berlin), the filmmaker seems to have lost meaningful contact with even his devotees while unsuccessfully trying to branch out subject-wise. Instead of growing as an artist, he seems to be treading water.
Not that there's anything wrong with checking in on these characters nearly a decade hence; to the contrary, their predicaments at the end of "Henry Fool" essentially invite it. The neurotic Fay Grim was left with a young son when the boy's father, the ever-mysterious, would-be literary giant Henry, vanished after he accidentally killed someone. For his complicity in Henry's escape, Fay's brother Simon, a garbage man turned notorious poet, was sentenced to 10 years in the pen.
Familiarity with the first film isn't required to get involved with the new one, although an affinity for the characters certainly helps. With the same unusual and outstanding actors reassembled to continue their roles, the yarn picks up with Fay (Parker Posey, luminous even when harried) barely able to cope with raising 14-year-old son Ned (Liam Aiken), whose generosity in sharing porn with classmates is getting him kicked out of school. Fay lives off the royalty checks still being generated by Simon (James Urbaniak), whose incarceration enhanced his already scandalous reputation, and she's dating Simon's publisher (Chuck Montgomery).
According to Simon, Henry escaped to Sweden, but a CIA op, Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum), arrives at Fay's door to inform her that Henry is dead and that two volumes of his vaunted "Confessions" -- the epic, handwritten magnum opus Henry promised would provoke a literary earthquake -- have been discovered by French authorities. Would she help recover the manuscripts? Yes, she will, but only if Simon, who possesses a third volume, is paroled.
And so commences a strange international odyssey that becomes more complicated and loony by the moment. Some viewers will undoubtedly tune out early, others will follow as far as they can -- and a privileged few might make it all the way. But at a certain point, the air of a vast literary game overwhelms any feeling for the humanity of those trapped inside it, and when one ceases to see the participants as vaguely real people, motivation evaporates for trying to figure out who's doing what to whom.
The upshot, revealed early on, is that "Confessions," while worthless from a stylistic point of view, is a coded text full of incriminating and inflammatory secrets about the misdeeds of numerous world governments. Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), about whom Fay learns too much unsuspected new information to digest, is alive after all and on the run, and Fay needs to sort out where he and everyone else stand before it's too late.
The journey takes Fay to Paris, then to Istanbul, where the striking climax is filmed along the waterfront. Throughout, Hartley and lenser Sarah Cawley Cabiya frame the action from cockeyed, slanted angles that are both mannered and beautiful to behold; the visuals are too self-conscious to provide a genuine sense of dislocation, but on their own terms rep nearly as rich and assured a use of the technology as do the more subtle and muted images in Nuri Bilge Ceylan's new Turkish drama "Climates."
Technically and logistically, Hartley gets a lot onscreen for what was undoubtedly little money, and he elicits precise, pulsatingly vibrant work from his actors. What's off is the authorial voice, which feels too smarty-pants, even smug. Short of seeing the earlier films again, it's hard to judge whether there's been a slight shift in Hartley's writing or if it's the current times that aren't so conducive to the elaborately constructed sense of remove. Given the director's obvious proficiency, it could be time for a brief vacation from his own original material just to see if he can find a different register for his talent.

The most obvious examples of American neo-New Wave movies, namely, those directed or influenced by Quentin Tarantino , are genre-reconstruction jobs, laden with references to outré classics of the sort that can no longer be made. Another sort of neo-New Wave production is the shaggy-dog story that lazily chases its own tail (Jim Jarmusch 's Stranger Than Paradise  being the mode's masterpiece). Such movies are generally underwritten and often overacted, a showcase for oddball personalities.
Hal Hartley 's Fay Grim  and Luke Wilson 's The Wendell Baker Story  (co-directed with brother Andrew) make a prime pair of shaggy dogs. Each of these character-driven comedies is named after its lovably "innocent" protagonist and both are nostalgic for the Hollywood  New Wave of the '70s, susceptible to unearned drollery, and prone to hit-or-miss wackiness. Where Fay Grim 's arch one-liners seem intended to raise a quizzical eyebrow, Wendell Baker   goes for the goofy, slack-jawed guffaw. What's truly disarming, however, is that as fond as they are of their own quirks, and as inured as they seem to conventional narrative rhythms, neither of these movies could even have fallen off the Hollywood assembly line.
Hard to remember, but back in the early 1990s, Hartley was regarded as the  hot, young avant Amerindie, and following critically acclaimed festival hits like Trust  (1990) and Simple Men  (1992), 1997's Henry Fool  , a seriously frivolous allegory on art, fame, fate, and the power of the Internet, was hailed as his breakthrough. "The affectless precision of Hal Hartley's previous work is absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of his Henry Fool . Here is a great American film," Janet Maslin  proclaimed in The New York Times  , complete with comparison to Nashville .
Such effusive over-praise must have cast a negative spell. Hartley's career promptly stumbled, and as Henry Fool 's belated sequel, Fay Grim  seems nearly an act of desperation. Three of the principals returnthe Queens  sanitation man turned poet Simon Grim  (professionally affectless James Urbaniak ), his sister Fay (Parker Posey ), and, briefly, the saturnine mystery tramp who changed their life, Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan ). A decade has passed, and Fay fears that her 14-year-old son will grow up to be like his vanished and extravagantly disreputable father, Henryor is that Hartley's hope for the movie?
Actually, Fay Grim  is the Parker Posey show. Her chiseled nose and down-turned mouth a priori edgy, Posey cuts a naturally cartoonish figure and, as demonstrated most recently by her broad turn as Lex Luthor 's moll in Superman Returns  (something of a shaggy-dog blockbuster), she can play physical comedy. As an actress, her allegiance belongs less to her character than her look, but she's so distinctive a presence that she has the effect here of naturalizing the normally ungainly Jeff Goldblum , who appears, with unexpected gravitas, as a duplicitous spook.
The CIA  comes to Queens. Not lacking for ambition, Fay Grim  adds a topical, national-security subtext to Henry Fool 's more romantic concerns for the power of art and the mystery of artistic creation: The MacGuffin is a series of confessional notebooks that Henry may have written in a code that, although seemingly inspired by the French primitive surrealist Raymond Roussel , amounts to a secret, highly damning history of the Reagan Era. The stakes have been raised: Where literature rocked individual worlds in Henry Fool , here it bids to rock the World.
Sometimes, in cryptography, the truth hides in plain sight: Fay Grim's two-word title perfectly evokes the two poles of the filmmaker's whimsical yet leaden sensibility. The initial mode is fey. Transposed from Woodside  to Paris in search of the notebooks, Posey looks smashing in a fitted town-coat ensemble so swanky that Hartley feels obliged to write an explanation for how she got it. (An ingenue no more, Posey channels her inner fashion model.) Intrigue swirls around her slit skirts, some of it in the form of Elina Löwensohnanother underappreciated, eccentric performer, here dressed in vintage Madonna  cast-offs. For perhaps 40 minutes, Fay Grim  actually sort of works as a comic thriller, albeit more amusing than funny. All manner of agents are in pursuit of Henry's notebooks. "The Russians extorted them from the North Koreans," one tells Fay. Hartley underscores and undercuts this conspiratorial nonsense with a bit of background tooting. (The film's music, as usual, is his own.) Then things change.
With all manner of backstories and flashbacks jamming the road, the Posey-mobile starts to swerve and sputter and finally blows a tire (in Istanbul  no less). For all the tonal shifts, Hartley's stylea matter of tense line readings, emphatically tilted compositions, and select running gagsremains grimly determined. But it's precisely when Fay Grim  strains for the big narrative revelation that it seems least con- sequential. Would that Hartley let shaggy dogs lie.
