         Directed by James Ivory, produced by Ismail Merchant and finished shortly before Merchant's death in May, "The White Countess" marks the final work in a collaboration that spanned 40 years. The screenplay was written by novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, whose novel "The Remains of the Day" was adapted in 1993 by longtime Merchant-Ivory collaborator Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and is set in the Shanghai of 1936 and '37, on the brink of the Japanese invasion.
 
  I hadn't noted the Ishiguro connection going in but found myself thinking about the earlier film, which touched on similar themes throughout. In "The Remains of the Day," Anthony Hopkins plays Stevens, a legendary butler in the ancestral estate of the Nazi appeaser Lord Darlington, where he represses his feelings for the housekeeper as assiduously as he polishes the silver. In "The White Countess," Ralph Fiennes plays a former legendary diplomat who has lost, among other things, his eyesight, his faith in diplomacy, his social skills and, for much of the film, his sobriety. Instead of a stately home in England, Jackson runs an elegant Shanghai nightclub — a meticulously designed and orchestrated operation that doubles as a refuge from the world and a controlled microcosm of the chaos brewing outside. There he represses his feelings for a Russian countess living in reduced circumstances — or so I gathered, anyway, near the end, which is about when the depth of his affection seems to dawn on him too.
 


         






    The similarities between the movies aren't immediately apparent. Ishiguro's script is not surprisingly the more novelistic of the two, a characteristic that ultimately functions as a testament to the ways movies don't work in the same way as novels. Unlike Jhabvala's tense and bristling study in frustration, repression and regret, "The White Countess" is peppered with longueurs and flights of whimsy, capturing its protagonists — Jackson (Fiennes) and the countess Sofia (Natasha Richardson) — in a sort of post-traumatic torpor. (Jackson is reeling from a personal tragedy as Sofia suffers her losses in stoic, melancholy, heavily Russian-accented isolation.) It throws them together early on but keeps their relationship at bay until the end — when I, for one, was way past giving a kumquat.
 
  Considering how many of the same elements are in place, it's hard not to conclude that what is missing from "The White Countess" is Jhabvala's crisp, terse touch. In her adaptation of Ishiguro's novel, she seemed to take all the silences, stillness and inaction and electrify them. Emma Thompson's Miss Kenton, in particular, displayed a corseted vitality that made you want to grab Hopkins for her and shake him hard by the lapels. The crucial difference in "The White Countess" is that the central characters are turned toward (or pointedly away) from their pasts; their conflicts are mostly external. Jackson is ostracized by former business and diplomatic associates, Sofia by the hideous, ridiculous family of her dead husband, and neither seems to know what his or her heart wants until the last possible moment.
 
  The title refers to Jackson's bar and to the woman who inspired it. Sofia Belinsky lives with her daughter Katya (Madeleine Daly) and her mother-in-law, Olga (Lynn Redgrave), sister-in-law Greshenka (Madeleine Potter), kind Aunt Sara (Vanessa Redgrave) and Uncle Peter (John Wood) in a shabby apartment above a tailor in the international section of Shanghai. Sofia works as a taxi dancer and prostitute to support her disapproving family. Jackson, who has been dreaming of opening "the perfect bar," successfully gambling his savings on a horse to do so, meets her at her place of employ and immediately pegs her for the magical ingredient his establishment needs.
 
  To say his approach to hospitality management is eccentric is to understate the case. After meeting Sofia he becomes convinced she is exactly what his establishment needs and hires her as a sort of hostess and muse, making it clear that he means strictly business. If this presents any sort of problem of the heart for Sofia, you wouldn't know it. Her despair keeps her pretty well occupied, as does her concern for her daughter, whom Olga and Greshenka insist will be corrupted by the sight of her mother in a cocktail dress.
 
  The Chekovian sight of so many Richardson-Redgraves lamenting their circumstances in heavily Russian-accented English and pining for Hong Kong, where their former social glory will be restored, makes you wonder if they'd have been better off in a stage production of "Three and a Half Sisters: The Twilight Years." There is one priceless scene in which the ruined and exiled Russian aristocrats discuss the propriety of paying a call on their old friend, the French ambassador. Aunt Sara feels that, given how things have changed, it is appropriate for them to visit the embassy. Olga maintains that the proper thing would be for the ambassador to call on them. "It's a consulate, dear," she says by way of explanation, making an absurdly fine distinction that becomes even funnier when it's parroted by the dim-bulb Peter.
 
  Christopher Doyle, Wong Kar Wai's regular cinematographer, creates a dreamscape inspired by Jackson's memories and indulgent wishes, as well as Katya's imaginative fantasies that's airy and pretty, but the story already feels too ethereal for its own good. It took me a while to figure out what the matter was, but after the idea took hold I couldn't shake it. The dreamy, willowy Fiennes makes for a strange not-so-ugly-American, convincing as neither a power-brokering diplomat nor a nightclub impresario. The scene at the racetrack, as Jackson emulates a horse and jockey and swats himself with an imaginary riding crop, is especially disconcerting. He's not just disappointed, or cynical, or jaded — he's cracked and spiraled off into the stratosphere, much too far gone to be engaging. What the movie needs in this part is an American version of Stevens, played by a younger version of Hopkins. What's called for is a hearty, back-slapping glad-hander with a core of white-knuckled control and repression. Instead, Jackson's pain oozes uncomfortably all over the place and seems to have seeped into his critical faculties. Early in the film he befriends an ominous Japanese businessman, Mr. Matsuda (Hiroyuki Sanada), who shares his interest in drinking establishments and helps him provide the element of "political tension" Jackson feels his bar needs. A blind man could see that Matsuda means trouble; though not our blind man — not at least until the bombs start falling. It's a shame, because "The White Countess" takes place in a fascinating time and place, rife with conflict and turmoil. But to watch Fiennes float (and Richardson trudge) through it all, absorbed in themselves and their own private misery, is to wish they'd started falling earlier, if only to knock some sense into them.

 With Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves aboard, you couldn't ask for a tonier cast than the one that gamely tries to pump oxygen into the thin, filtered air of "The White Countess."  The final collaboration between the director James Ivory and his longtime partner, the producer Ismail Merchant, who died during post-production, the movie, set in Shanghai in 1936 and 1937, is one of their most ambitious projects. But with its tentative pace, fussy, pieced-together structure and stuffy emotional climate, "The White Countess" never develops any narrative stamina.  With an original screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro, whose novel "The Remains of the Day" (adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala) became one of the team's biggest successes in 1993, "The White Countess" has the familiar Merchant-Ivory trademarks: cultivated dialogue, a keen eye for the nuances of upscale society and a sophisticated, internationalist view of class and ethnicity. What is missing from a film that wants to be an Asian "Casablanca" crossed with "The English Patient" is a racing, dramatic pulse. Its sedate tone is simply too refined for the story it has to tell.  Mr. Ishiguro's prim, anemic screenplay is so lacking in drive and emotional gravitas that the actors are left with only scraps of lean dramatic meat to tear into. Mr. Fiennes brings his usual multilayered subtlety to the character of Todd Jackson, an American businessman and diplomat disillusioned with the world since the failure of the League of Nations, which he helped to set up. Jackson is literally and metaphorically blind. And Mr. Fiennes, who affects a flat, neutral American accent, disconcertingly seems to forget his character's affliction much of the time and to act as if he can see. How he became blind isn't explained until the second of two crucial flashbacks hurriedly shoehorned into the movie that reveal the family tragedies that drove him into his shell.  Natasha Richardson is Sofia Belinsky, a spirited Russian émigrée countess who becomes the bruised apple of his unseeing eye, but the warmth generated between Ms. Richardson and Mr. Fiennes barely reaches room temperature. That coolness is due in part to the fact that their repressed romantic attraction is stifled by a mutual agreement not to share the details of their personal lives. But even after those barriers have begun to crumble, there are few signs of heat.  The film takes its name from the Shanghai nightclub that Jackson buys when he bets his life savings on a horse and wins. His club, the ultimate cosmopolitan melting pot of his dreams, suggests a fancy Far Eastern answer to Rick's place, from "Casablanca," peopled with a richer, more volatile mix of colliding social forces. Its patrons include Maoists, anti-Communists, Japanese, rogue Western capitalists and dancing girls.  Sofia, the film's bravest and most sympathetic character, is a widowed  countess who has fled to Shanghai with her family, which she supports and scandalizes by working as a taxi dancer and sometime prostitute. Her relatives include her Aunt Sara (Vanessa Redgrave) and Uncle Peter (John Wood); her vicious, sniping mother-in-law, Olga (Lynn Redgrave); her sister-in-law, Greshenka (Madeleine Potter); and her 10-year-old daughter, Katya (Madeleine Daly), whom Sofia's prudish in-laws believe is in imminent danger of being corrupted by her mother.  The women, who sleep three in a bed in a dingy Shanghai slum, spend their days sewing, complaining and dreaming of scraping together enough money to move to Hong Kong, where they imagine their noble lineage will be recognized. Sofia's fortunes take an upswing when she meets Jackson, who invites her to be the hostess, centerpiece and real-life namesake of his new club, the White Countess.  Jackson is befriended by Matsuda (Hiroyuki Sanada), an enigmatic, well-connected Japanese wheeler-dealer who volunteers to fill the club with the missing ingredient from Jackson's recipe for nightclub perfection: political tension. Matsuda is the film's answer to Claude Rains's cynical, all-knowing Captain Renault in "Casablanca."  What makes "The White Countess" so frustrating is that enough ingredients are in place to imagine how they might have been rearranged to create a thrilling drama of lives swept forward on a historical floodtide. But not until the last half-hour, when the Japanese bomb the city on Aug. 14, 1937, precipitating a panicked mass exodus, do the elements begin to gel. By then, it's far too late for this polite, meandering epic-manqué to rouse itself to glory.  "The White Countess" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild violence.
Fusing the supple novelist Kazuo Ishiguro 's storytelling instincts and the wanton eye of DP Christopher Doyle  should be an exciting proposition, even without Ralph Fiennes 's wardrobe at its most dapper. Alas, The White Countess , the final Merchant Ivory  film, is something of a lacquered dud. Set in 1930s Shanghai , amid growing Sino-Japanese friction, the film (based on an Ishiguro script) weaves together the lives of Fiennes's Jackson, an American diplomat turned businessman and nightclub connoisseur, and Natasha Richardson 's Sofia , a Russian countess reduced to working dance halls to support her disdainful family. After Sofia leads the blind Jackson to the safety of his car (he's about to get jumped by some hoods), he decides to pursue the bar of his dreams. A happy cash infusion allows him to open the White Countess (as it were), with Sofia as hostess, her tragic biography deepening the ambience.
The film has some early allure, sort of Scent of a Woman  with rickshaws and cheongsams. Richardson is a subtly melancholy presence, though the scenes of her home life (including two other Redgraves) are like unwelcome visits to Accents "R" Us. Fiennes is a bit wobblier, vocally, as a U.S. expat, his Midwestern (?) accent coming and going. He's better at the physical fillipstaking several steps at a leap, gliding into a car as his manservant protectively blocks out the boundaries of the door.
When Jackson complains to his Japanese friend, the suave but sinister Mr. Matsuda (Hiroyuki Sanada ), that all his bar lacks is "political tension," I think he just means tension; it's the sound of the filmmakers realizing that the whole scenarioThe White Countess , not just the White Countessis irredeemably dull. (The entertainment at the White Countess includes ballerinas, two people dressed like cats, an orotund Teutonic tenorwhee!)
Ishiguro's métier is reticence and the dodges of memory, and Jackson characteristically keeps his private life walled away, most notably when insisting that he and Sofia maintain a strictly professional rapport. The White Countess is his way of keeping the outside world at bay, a logical commercial development of internal processes, and if this conceit is interesting, it gets considerably less so when we hear it again and again. The flashbacks explaining what happened to Jackson's family (and his eyesight) are embarrassingly perfunctorya trauma checklist that begs the question, if he really  wanted to stop dwelling on painful matters, wouldn't he just have hightailed it back to the States?
