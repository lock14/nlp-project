There's nothing in the vampire epic 30 Days of Night
 that approaches the queasy pederast horrors of Slade's previous film, Hard Candy
, a movie of dubious moral clarity but undeniable punch. The classic folkloric terrors that have translated so seamlessly into the medium of film � vampires, werewolves, and ghosts � can no longer hold a hand of glory to all that real-world darkness outside
 the theatre. These days, it's dark everywhere
. Which makes Slade's wild, often exhilarating neo-Western ride into frostbit vampirism something of a respite, albeit one awash in gore. The bloodsuckers in 30 Days of Night
 arrive as a nomadic gang of guttural, howling Euro-vamps who act like they ate Udo Kier for breakfast and are now sniffing around for the Joe Dallesandro buffet. Adapted from Steve Niles' graphic novel, the film's high-concept stroke of genius lies not with its vampire clan but with the setting: the tiny hamlet of Barrow, Alaska, where residents do indeed experience the title's lengthy nightfall. On the eve of this yearly perma-night, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) incarcerates a ratty, possibly insane drifter (Foster), who has arrived, Renfield-like, to herald the coming of far worse. Cut off from the outside world by the naturally inclement weather and wholly unnatural sabotage, the sheriff and a handful of Barrow's citizenry (including George as his estranged wife, Stella) are systematically attacked by the bloodsuckers. So much so that they're eventually forced to hole up in squalid attics and crawl spaces, able to do little more than peek out the windows and wait for the faraway sunrise. That's a smart reversal of the classic vampire's casket trope, bringing to mind both Stephen King's Salem's Lot
 and Fred Zinnemann's High Noon
. Hartnett is stoically adequate here, but he's no Gary Cooper, and his wounded alpha-male relationship with Stella comes off as a less-nuanced version of Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's pseudo-couple in The Abyss
. As befits the proto-Western template, the Nosferatu gang is led by the hellishly good Huston, whose Slavic-sounding Marlow growls orders to his underlings and dishes out spontaneous ultraviolence like Slobodan Milosevic meeting Henry Fonda's Frank in the devil's cut of Once Upon a Time in Hell
. At its core, 30 Days of Night
 is a siege Western relocated to the frozen north. It's bad guys in black, and red blood on white snow, with Hartnett's lone, heartsick sheriff the only thing standing between unsure love and certain death.


If you're a vampire, I suppose, finding the right vacation spot can be a pain in the neck. So many variables to consider: an absence of sunlight, hot and cold running blood, beach access. For the undead in "30 Days of Night," the town of Barrow, Alaska, has everything but the latter. Two out of three ain't bad.
Based on a 2001 graphic novel, "30 Days" is a proficient, atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you haven't seen before but still does it passably well. It'll freak out teenage first-timers sneaking in under the R rating, even if wizened gorehounds who know their vampire-movie history will stick with 1987's "Near Dark," still the final word in postmodern Nosferatus.
The concept is as elegantly simple as the film's desaturated color scheme. Barrow, the northernmost town in the United States, is plunged into darkness one month each winter, when the sun dips below the horizon and doesn't come back. The road and the airport are closed; the reduced population hunkers down and waits. For a coven of vampires, Barrow presents an all-you-can-eat buffet.
For the locals, led by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett, looking more than ever like a fetal Tommy Lee Jones), it's wholesale slaughter followed by 3 1/2 weeks of hide and seek. "30 Days" builds slowly and eerily to an early pitch of cover-your-eyes carnage, as Eben drives around on the last day of sunlight discovering evidence that something is planning entrapment. The sled dogs have been killed; cellphones have been collected and burned. (How? Don't ask.) A wild-eyed drifter (Ben Foster, reprising his "3:10 to Yuma" crazy act as the movie's Renfield) arrives in town muttering dire warnings.
Then night falls and the undead emerge: freakish and dark-eyed, dressed in fashionable black, with rows of dessicated dental work. They speak in shrieky vampirese and their features don't quite make sense, as if drawn by a comics artist who hadn't finished the correspondence course. And they're fast. They pull you under a house and chomp through your carotid before you've even been properly introduced.
So far so ghoulishly good, and the leader of the vampires looks so remarkably like Danny Huston that you realize with a start it is Danny Huston, slumming with playful B-movie nihilism. As the movie settles down and the dark days roll on, "30 Days" becomes a fairly dull 10-little-Alaskans suspense film, with Eben and the other survivors crawling from house to house, trying to avoid detection.
The group's awfully standard: a raw kid, an old coot, a blowhard chicken, a noble ethnic, an anonymous girl, and Stella (Melissa George), the lissome county fire marshal and Eben's estranged wife. Apparently the undead have their uses in the marriage-counseling department, too.
The director is David Slade, whose previous movie, the controversial low-budget drama "Hard Candy," was in many ways scarier than anything he gets up to here. But "30 Days of Night" is stylish in a doomy, shallow, graphic-novel way, and despite regular dips into gore its better moments are quiet ones: a lone woman calling for help on Main Street while dark figures move just out of sight on the surrounding rooftops. They've staked her out as bait. If you've never seen a vampire movie before, feel free to bite.


Forget the weary, bedraggled victims  even the undead look like they're pining for a good long nap in 30 Days of Night . Adapted from a horror comic so bloody it gives new meaning to the term graphic novel , this soporific splatterfest is set in an Alaska oil town during the month of no sun, which means, in essence, that it's a fright film that takes place entirely at night (what a revolutionary new concept!). You do have to give it this, though: The extended time period is vividly conveyed, since the movie itself feels about a month long.
The monsters are shrieky, flesh-ripping zombie vampires outfitted with what appear to be entire mouthfuls of incisors. They're commanded by a tall, brooding, and rather natty scowler (Danny Huston) who bears a disquieting resemblance to Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys. Speaking in a subtitled guttural rasp that makes him sound like he just popped in from an obscure European film festival, this nightmare dandy growls out lines like ''There is no hope, only hunger and pain.'' His name is Marlow, but they should have called him Jean-Paul Face-Chomper.
As the sheriff who leads the besieged townsfolk, Josh Hartnett looks as if he's about to cry. He and the others finally figure out that you can destroy the vampires by lopping off their heads with an ax, a method that in this movie tends to require more than one good clean whack. You can expect a lot of shredding and gurgling. 30 Days of Night  is relentless, but it's also relentlessly one-note.

 Adapted by the director David Slade from Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith’s graphic novel about vampires taking over an Alaska town, “30 Days of Night” is a series of gory set pieces that seems to have been edited with a meat ax. A major early transition is so clumsy that you may assume that the projectionist accidentally skipped a reel. No such luck: it’s a style thing.  After an intriguingly subdued opening section — which introduces the inhabitants of a town above the Arctic Circle that’s shrouded in darkness for one month a year — the movie crosscuts between the schemes of a predictably effete, nasty vampire horde (Eurotrash nightclub-crawler outfits, subtitled dialogue) and the besieged citizenry’s attempts to hide and fight.  Mr. Slade’s solid cast includes Josh Hartnett as the stalwart town sheriff; Melissa George as his estranged wife, a fire marshal; Mark Boone Junior  as his loutish, antisocial brother; Danny Huston as the flamboyantly cheesy vampire chieftain; and the impishly hammy Ben Foster as a prophecy-spouting jail inmate whose plot function recalls the similar, superior Stephen King mini-series “Storm of the Century.”  But the performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesn’t rise nearly fast enough.  “30 Days of Night” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong horror violence and language.

After recent pics "Into the Wild" and "The Last Winter," Alaska is once again the go-to place for premature death in "30 Days of Night." Horror opus derived from a graphic-novel series charts the mayhem that ensues when vampires invade an isolated far-North habitat during its annual month of sunlessness. Mainstream bow by David Slade, director of attention-getting indie "Hard Candy," excels at bloodthirsty action, though dialogue and human-interest aspects are a tad anemic. Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds, which should make this a solid Halloween-season earner.
Opening titles intro Barrow as the northernmost U.S. town, subject to a month's unbroken "night" at the height of each winter. Much of the modest population choose to avoid that gloomy stretch by going south for a spell. But even as the last of them depart, leaving hardier loved ones behind, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) discovers a string of disturbing crimes -- stolen cell phones found burnt to a crisp, local sled dogs slaughtered in their kennels -- seemingly committed by someone intent on cutting the town off entirely from the outside world.
A scraggly, ill-tempered stranger (Ben Foster) appears out of nowhere. When thrown into jail, the Renfield-like figure taunts Eben, kid brother Jake (Mark Rendall) and others that there will be no escape when "they come."
They already have: A band of pasty, ravenous, irregularly prosthetic-featured bloodsuckers first pick off a few snackables on the outskirts before launching full-scale slaughter downtown. This reduces the cast to the usual ever-dwindling cluster of quarreling survivors a bit too soon. One might think vampires would want to pace themselves, with so many meals on hand.
Those citizens not yet drained and beheaded hide out in an attic for some days, then are forced to keep moving. Sacrifices are made, including a big one by the sheriff that leads to a somewhat underwhelming final confrontation with the vampire leader (Danny Huston).
Pic is at its best whenever the blood's flowing, as David Slade's direction, Art Jones' editing and Jo Willems' widescreen lensing create blunt, visceral action that makes the vampires' speed, strength and thirstiness vivid. A notable early setpiece has a middle-aged couple abruptly dragged out of, and under, their home. Episodes involving a little girl in a general store and the fate of deputy Billy (Manu Bennett) will please those who like their gore graphic.
Punchy as it is at such moments, however, the pulse slackens considerably between them. Dialogue is humorless and obvious (including the vampires' subtitled guttural verbalizations). Attempt to create some emotional tension between Hartnett's Eben and Melissa George as his estranged-but-stranded wife Stella falls flat, with neither thesp bringing much charisma to the table.
Pic also does a so-so job staying credible on fantasy terms. The number of vampires seems to grow, but it's never clear why. Mostly, the vamps are fast-moving and near-invincible; then again, sometimes not. Despite occasional titles announcing "Day 7," etc., the passage of time is murky. Of course, this is the sort of movie that requires suspension of disbelief, but its numerous slow stretches allow such nitpicking questions to fester.
Tech package is sharp down the line. Pic's look is slightly desaturated, with the color drained from the darkened world after some beautiful initial daylight vistas. Brian Reitzell's score is unobtrusive -- a high compliment these days -- save one unfortunate late moment when Hartnett faces his foe to a ludicrous arena-rock drum roll even KISS would find corny.
Though there really is a Barrow, Alaska, pic was entirely shot in New Zealand. Tons of Epsom salts, shredded paper, white blankets and other elements convincingly stand in for a snowy, subzero environment.

Writer Steve Niles  and illustrator Ben Templesmith 's three-issue comic-book series, originally published in 2002, spawned a subsequent franchise and now a big-screen adaptation by doing little more than drenching the centuries-old vampire myth in just a little more goresomething for the kids. Director David Slade 's stab at the story is actually rather ordinary: a grisly game of hide-and-seek, pitting the town's few survivors (among them Josh Hartnett  as the sheriff and Melissa George  as his estranged wife) against the bloodsucking gang, led by Danny Huston , who speaks in a foreign tongue just for extra spookiness. The promise of endless night is misleading; they should have called this 30 Days for Night , as the thing's as brightly lit as any MGM musical, despite the power being out all over town. Alas, that's just a nitpicky pointthere are much larger problems, chief among them being that the movie's just not very scary. And perhaps that's the point: It's as much a western as it is a horror film, with Harnett as Will Kane and Huston's posse as the evildoers come to do him in. Get it? High Noon , when it's always midnight. Shrug. Still, it's the best thing Hartnett's ever done; the guy's better at playing the undead . . . no surprise there.
