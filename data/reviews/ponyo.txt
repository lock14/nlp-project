The gist of the new Hayao Miyazaki movie sure sounds familiar. A 5-year-old boy named Sosuke makes a pet of a fish-like creature (she looks like a nightgown wearing a tadpole) that washes up on a cove near his house in a small fishing village. The creature, who  Sosuke names Ponyo, tastes ham and human blood and decides that she would like nothing more than to be a little girl who spends all her time with Sosuke. Casually, you might hitch Miyazaki’s “Ponyo’’ to any iteration of “The Little Mermaid’’ tale, namely the musical one from Disney  - which is also distributing “Ponyo.’’
But nothing in the great animation of a Miyazaki movie stays cute for long. Not the ocean, not the trees, not the critters that live in them. Change is constant but rarely natural. And nature is in bad shape. That is nothing new for this Japanese visionary, who’s been railing about man’s ecological ravages for years, most epically in 1998’s “Princess Mononoke.’’ “Ponyo’’ is Miyazaki ranting at a far less bellicose register. It’s also the director in a much less visually extravagant frame of mind than either “Spirited Away’’ or “Howl’s Moving Castle.’’ It’s his cuddliest movie since “My Neighbor Totoro’’ over 20 years ago. The softly but solidly drawn characters drive, swim, run, eat, jump, and mosey against impressionist watercolor backdrops.
Just because “Ponyo’’ is toothsome doesn’t mean it’s toothless. Even within the new movie’s relative visual and thematic modesty, Miyazaki sends distress signals.
The water in “Ponyo’’ is filthy. A fishing boat’s trawling net catches more trash than fish. Blobs of inky, grumpy waves (complete with eyes and attitude) lap at the shore below Sosuke’s house. Ebbing, they leave behind an empty bottle of dishwashing soap. (Try cleaning the ocean with that.) Sometimes the water is as transparent as cellophane other times, as murky as oil.
Ponyo has floated away from the undersea kingdom of her father, Fujimoto, a cranky, somewhat amphibious but acceptably human-looking environmentalist, voiced, in this English-language version, by Liam Neeson. Fujimoto has rooms full of vials and vases of elixirs. He has sired a school of little critters just like Ponyo, whom he named Brunhilde. Cate Blanchett lends her voice to the mother, Gran Mamare, a celestial aquatic deity with a chili-pepper necklace and more regal air of tolerance than her petulant husband. (The casting of children is nifty. Sosuke’s voice belongs to Frankie Jonas, who, because he’s not old enough to be in his brothers’ band, is called the Bonus Jonas. Miley Cyrus’s little sister Noah speaks for Ponyo.)
Fujimoto loathes humans for what they have done to the waters. When Ponyo leaves him, he follows her to the surface with his flowing hair, wild capes, and candy-stripe suits. He might be genetically connected to the ocean, but, sartorially, he shares DNA with Willy Wonka. The news that Ponyo wants to be human depresses him. But Miyazaki refuses to cast Fujimoto as a villain. He’s just a concerned parent, a fretful lover of the earth’s water, and a kind of creep. The sight of him stalking Sosuke’s house in his getup, with a garden sprinkler attached to a pack on his back, is delightfully strange physical comedy.
“Ponyo’’ is a movie loaded with strange delights. There are lots of permeable membranes and fish that glow gold. Sosuke’s mother (Tina Fey) licks an ice cream cone while driving her car on a winding road. She also works at a nursing home where old women (Cloris Leachman and Betty White do two of the voices) leave their wheelchairs and do miraculous jogs. Fujimoto cups his hands over Ponyo and screams, “Revert! Revert!’’ as she defiantly transforms herself into a human. As a girl, she has legs and feet that stick out from a large pair of white pantaloons. She looks like a large gressorial bird  - or a Macy’s parade float (never more so than when she sprints atop the crest of rushing waves). It seems that her arrival on dry land brings with it a serious storm that abates only when Ponyo and Sosuke find each other.
For a movie with so many characteristically dreamy flourishes, it’s the mundane ones that are most magical, in part because animation tends to emphasize the extraordinary: the pouring of hot water over ramen, Sosuke’s patient removal of a pair of binoculars and a sailor’s cap before pushing a big toy boat, a sequence in which Sosuke sends light signals to his seaman father (Matt Damon) while his mother sulks on the floor over dad.
Many of the cues in the extraordinary first third of Pixar’s “Up’’ seem to have sprung, in part, from Miyazaki, who alchemizes the ordinary and the irregular. Daily existence is reconceived at a dreamier scale. In “Ponyo,’’ the two are so thoroughly integrated that it’s pointless to make a distinction. Ramen is magic. A darker instance of that conflation is the dangerous weather that produces what can rightly be called a natural disaster. Its effects, for our two little heroes, become the stuff of adventure so that what might usually be an ending could easily pass for a trippy aquatic afterlife.

Ponyo , an emotionally profound, visually thrilling animated reimagining of the classic fairy tale ''The Little Mermaid,'' is another opportunity for the smitten to state the  obvious: The work of the legendary Japanese animation artist Hayao Miyazaki is both  unmistakable and inimitable. Forget about Ariel, the romanticized, selectively sexualized Disney mermaid. Miyazaki, whose previous masterpieces include Howl's  Moving Castle , Princess Mononoke , and the 2002 Academy Award winner Spirited Away , deepens the classic Hans Christian  Andersen story so that it becomes a parable about keeping a planet in balance, and a vision of multigenerational love.
Employing traditional cel animation to   produce a fireworks display of inventive   imagery, Miyazaki's version skips lightly, sweetly, and firmly over gender fussiness to introduce the heroine  Ponyo  as a strong, robust, trusting, loving little fish in the sea. And when Ponyo falls in love with a little boy named Sosuke, she decides that what she wants most (much to the distress of her  sorcerer father) is to become a little land-based girl. Not surprisingly, big-name fans of the animator lined up to voice the English-language version, among them Tina Fey as Sosuke's mother and Liam Neeson as Ponyo's ecology-minded father. (Listen, too, for Cate Blanchett, Lily Tomlin, and Matt Damon.) Don't tell Walt Disney, but Hayao Miyazaki  really holds the keys to the magic kingdom.


To watch the image of a young girl burbling with laughter as she runs atop cresting waves in “Ponyo” is to be reminded of how infrequently the movies seem to express joy now, how rarely they sweep us up in ecstatic reverie. It’s a giddy, touchingly resonant image of freedom — the animated girl is as liberated from shoes as from the laws of nature — one that the director Hayao Miyazaki lingers on only as long as it takes your eyes and mind to hold it close, love it deeply and immediately regret its impermanence. The girl is running parallel to an island road, her eyes wildly fixed on a small car perilously whipping around hairpin bends in a raucous storm. Her name is Ponyo (gurgled and voiced by Noah Cyrus, Miley’s younger sister) and she was once some kind of half-human, half-fish daughter of the sea. But she found a boy, the 5-year-old Sosuke (Frankie Jonas, yet another one of those brothers), or rather he found her, rescuing her by scooping her into a pail. The two were separated — as fated characters invariably are — but she’s found him. Now, as she races along the surface of huge peaking waves she has summoned up by the force of her power, Ponyo is expressing not only her bliss, but also ours. “Ponyo” is the latest masterwork  from Mr. Miyazaki, the influential Japanese animator who has advanced the art with films like “Princess Mononoke,” “Spirited Away” and “Howl’s Moving Castle.” The new film, despite the initial distractions of the recognizable voices crammed into the English-language version (a subdued Matt Damon, a fine Betty White), shares thematic and visual similarities with his earlier work, notably its emphasis on the natural world, its tumults and fragility. (As Mr. Miyazaki once put it, “All my animation and comics involve land, sea and sky — they all revolve around what happens on earth.”) But “Ponyo,” which takes some inspiration from “The Little Mermaid,” Hans Christian Andersen’s macabre fairy tale, has a narrative simplicity, or rather the clarity of a distillation. Despite the connection to Andersen’s tale, there is nothing remotely ghoulish about “Ponyo.” No blood and only a few anxious tears are spilled. Far more than Mr. Miyazaki’s other recent films, this one obviously has been  created for young viewers, who will have no trouble grasping its broad story or understanding why the characters do what they do, as when Sosuke, worried about prowling cats, places a leaf over the pail with the goldfish girl. At that point Ponyo is as big as Sosuke’s hand. With her broadly smiling, pale human face and wiggling, red fish body, she looks a little like one of the girls that the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara likes to draw, minus the scowl. She also looks a bit like a well-dressed tadpole. Like the other characters, with their clean lines and bright splashes of color, Ponyo tends to pop slightly on the screen. Although Mr. Miyazaki  eschews the deep space of 3-D animation (over his dead body, as he recently suggested), he is acutely sensitive to texture, an awareness that translates into different visual designs for individual scenes and which intensifies the emotional register of those same scenes. The softly smudged field of grass that surrounds Sosuke’s house like a blanket is striking partly because you can see the touch of the human hand in each blade. The blurred pastel quality of the grass, the softness of this green mantle, convey a feeling of comfort that in turn summons up words like warmth, home, love. Under the ocean the colors are more saturated and the lines often sharper. In this magical realm of undulating creatures and twinkling lights, Ponyo’s father, a wizard named Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), practices his mysterious art. From the prow of a submerged vessel, Fujimoto — the long tendrils of his rusty red hair waving around his head like octopus tentacles — releases potions that restore the health of the pollution-choked waters. It’s hard not to think of the wizard, particularly when he gently and very cleanly curses the human world and its harmful ways, as something of a Miyazaki self-portrait. Whatever the case, like his creator, Fujimoto can’t keep Ponyo under wraps: she springs from the sea, exploding into the world with a reckless, infectious, almost calamitous exuberance. This is nature unbound, or maybe it’s the image of childhood right before culture takes over and initiates its relentless tsk-tsking, telling us to mind our manners, shut our mouths and sit up in our seats. Smitten with Sosuke, Ponyo decides she wants to be human, a wish that involves a visit from her mother (Cate Blanchett) and almost upends the balance of the world. As in the original Andersen fairy tale, which turns on a mermaid who dies because she falls in love with a landlocked prince, humanity has its costs. Not to worry: no one dies in “Ponyo” or even coughs. Its sting is so gentle you might miss it. But when the ocean rises in this wonderful movie, each leaping wave stares out at us with a baleful eye as if in watchful and worried wait.

Hayao Miyazaki�s latest animated epic, �Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,� unfolds with a magic limpidity, teeming with imaginative transports that owe nothing to CGI. Effortlessly shuttling between sea, land and sky, this �Little Mermaid�-ish tale dives deep into the collective unconscious of Japan�s island culture, imagining a transparency between natural elements that promises salvation and apocalypse in equal measure. Though targeted at tots, �Ponyo� may appeal most to jaded adults thirsty for wondrous beauty and unpackaged innocence. Pic is the first local production since Miyazaki�s �Howl�s Moving Castle� (2004) to pass ¥10 billion ($93.2 million) at home.
Widely perceived as a positive manifestation of the �second childhood� of its 67-year-old visionary director, pic marks a stylistic U-turn from the rendered literalism of the fantasy components in �Howl�s Moving Castle.� Pic frequently partakes of simpler, sparer setups, and more distilled, abstract compositions, with foreshortened perspectives and whimsically freewheeling character designs that imply the direct influence of children�s drawing.
Miyazaki�s underwater specimens decidedly defy scientific categorization. Perky Ponyo (voiced by Yuria Nara), a fish with a little face and red dress, lives beneath the sea with her red-haired, ecologically anxious father and hundreds of much tinier, red-dressed sisters. Curious about the surface world, she hitches a ride atop one of many floating jellyfish (using a smaller, more diaphanous jellyfish as a windshield dome).
Swept up by a dredging net, along with the detritus of civilization (everything from bathtubs to oil sludge), Ponyo is rescued by 5-year-old Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), who resides on a cliff above the ocean and promises to protect her always.
Eventually, Ponyo�s sorcerer father manages to recapture his wayward offspring. But Ponyo, both a willful child and an ungovernable force of nature, soon escapes again, in the process upsetting the Earth�s ecological balance.
Accidentally unleashing her father�s magic elixir, Ponyo triggers a tour de force orchestration of swirling elements that transform her wee helpful little sisters into huge fish that overrun the sea in a vast tsunami. Ponyo triumphantly rises atop the mounting waves to near-Wagnerian strains, oblivious to the total devastation she has wrought.
If Sosuke serves as the template for the perfect child (with his boat-captain father often away and his dashingly imagined daredevil mother given to impulse, he assumes responsibility for everyone), Ponyo is definitely a handful. Miyazaki has crafted no demure little mermaid, and no soft dissolves accompany her awkward transitions to human form: The legs she first sprouts are chicken-like appendages, and her occasional headlong dives involve swift regressions to amoeba-like formlessness. 
Miyazaki has inadvertently dished up yet another challenge to the universe of hand-drawn toons: Even more so than his previous outings, the film confounds traditional notions of anthropomorphism, dwelling especially on the transformative properties of water.
Far more upbeat than much of Miyazaki�s oeuvre, limned in bright pastel colors where even destruction is golden, �Ponyo� possesses an almost demonic childish energy and a delight in form stronger than reason or narrative. Even Armageddon, as loosed by Ponyo and imagined by Miyazaki, is a wondrous place where half-armored prehistoric fish glide alongside their more evolved cousins, submerged trees form mysterious swamplands and a �ship graveyard� of foundering vessels appears in the distance, like a fairyland of lights stretched out upon the water.
Disney will release the film Aug. 14 in an English-dubbed version under the title �Ponyo.�


In the same week that the South African import District 9  gives us a Johannesburg  beset by alien invaders, the latest film by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki  envisions a small Japanese port town turned upside-down by visitors from the bottom of the sea. Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen s The Little Mermaid , by way of Jules Verne , Miyazakis Ponyo  sticks to Andersens basic story of an enchanted sea creature and her love for a humanexcept, in the Miyazaki version, the mermaid princess is an anthropomorphic goldfish, and her handsome prince is a five-year-old schoolboy still in full possession of his baby teeth.
The advance word on Ponyo which opened in Japan  last year and arrives here in an English-dubbed version adapted by E.T.  screenwriter Melissa Mathison  and supervised by Pixar  guru John Lasseter had suggested that the film would mark a conscious return by Miyazaki to the gentler, more kid-friendly style of movies like My Neighbor Totoro and Kikis Delivery Service  after the epic-scaled and sometimes violent narratives of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away . And while that may be the case, the appeal of Ponyo  is hardly limited to the Romper Room  set. Its a movie for anyone who, like Miyazaki himself, can still happily commune with his inner five-year-old.
The great ocean deep proves a natural canvas for Miyazaki, who has set previous films against the clouds of the sky and the fragile topography of the earth, and he responds by filling the screen with a Cousteau-worthy panorama of iridescent sea flora and magnificently scaled, tentacled creatures of all shapes and sizes. One of them, Ponyo (voiced by Noah Cyrus , sister of Miley), who carries a distinctly human head atop her fish body, is introduced as the daughter of Fujimoto (Liam Neeson ), an eccentric alchemist who himself resembles a cross between Captain Nemo and Ziggy Stardust  and who has been chargedpresumably by Ponyos ocean-goddess mother (Cate Blanchett )with maintaining the delicate ecological balance of the seas. Trouble ensues when Ponyo swims a bit too far from home, gets caught in a fishing net, and washes up on shore trapped inside a littered glass jar.
So Ponyo meet-cutes Sosuke (Frankie Jonas ), who rescues her, takes her to kindergarten with him in a plastic bucket, and seems altogether unsurprisedin the way Miyazaki's characters so often do upon encountering the unexplainablewhen the fish blurts out its declaration of love for him. And this is before Ponyo, having been briefly recaptured by her flustered father, returns once more to the surface, this time in human form, bringing along a hurricane-force storm caused by her disturbance of Fujimotos magic, ocean-altering potions.
Coming about halfway into Ponyo s modest, 100-minute running time, that stormcapped by the fantastical image of Ponyo running atop a series of tsunami-size wavesranks among Miyazakis most majestic set pieces and ushers in a whole new collection of visual possibilities. After the rain subsides, the waters have risen so high that they cover the entire town, with prehistoric fish swimming down former city streets and a low-hanging moon pulling an armada of commercial ships (including the one captained by Sosukes father) close to an enormous, suspended wall of water. Into this topsy-turvy world, Ponyo and Sosuke set out in a candle-powered toy boat to try to restore order to the universe.
Like much of Miyazakis work, Ponyo carries an unsubtle environmental message: They spoil the sea. They treat your home like their empty, black souls, decries Fujimoto, a human or former human himselfsuch details are ultimately trivial in the Miyazaki universewho shudders at his beloved childs desire to live among the two-legged. (Perhaps he has seen The Cove , the recent documentary about the horrors of the black-market, Japanese dolphin-harvesting industry.) Miyazaki, too, is keenly aware that nothingneither children nor oceansstays pure and innocent forever, and yet, as he glances at the world once more through a childs wide, unspoiled eyes, he seems to find hope for renewal.
