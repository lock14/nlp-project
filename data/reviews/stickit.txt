Jessica Bendinger, the writer of the hugely successful teen comedy Bring It On
 (and a regular visitor to the Austin Film Festival and Screenwriters Conference), debuts as the director of her own material with Stick It
, a teen comedy set in the world of competitive gymnastics. Like Bring It On
, Stick It
 is so much better than most of its insipid teen-movie peers yet like her earlier movie, Bendinger�s new one is also not all it might be. In its favor, Bendinger refrains from taking the obvious Hollywood path and sublimating her story to the more immediate delights of watching limber teenage girls parading around in skintight leotards and lathering up in the showers after strenuous workouts. There is actually a good story here about teenage rebellion and competitive drive and banding together to fight injustice � albeit the injustice of the judges who deduct points from a gymnast�s perfect routine because of a visible bra strap. However, there�s too much going on in Stick It
 � what with parent problems, boys, a mercenary coach, peer pressure, and snarky infighting � to feel as though any of the story threads have been developed and resolved satisfactorily before diverting sole attention to the climactic sequences of the formulaic �big competition.� A few completely diversionary interludes that ape the elaborate choreography of Busby Berkeley sequences are delightfully out of place, although playful and inventive. Peregrym anchors the story as Haley Graham, a teenaged tomboy of divorced parents who gets into a scrape with the law and is sent to do time at Vickerman Gymnastics Academy. A former junior-level champion, she tarnished her reputation when she inexplicably walked away from the finals before competing. Peregrym casts a believable figure as the sullen athlete, calling to mind physical memories of Nancy McKeon as the tomboy Jo crashing the gates of the refined private school in The Facts of Life
. Bridges, as always, turns in dependable work as the hard-nosed coach Vickerman, but the character comes with a little too much backstory that neither advances the plot nor finds resolution. The film�s implicit message about the questioning of authority is indeed welcome, and those color-coordinated leotards make for a fanciful palette, but Stick It
�s chaotic m�lange stuffs too much into its unforgiving spandex form.


''Stick It" is a mildly amusing comedy set in the rarely visited world of elite gymnastics. The last time I recall such a complete Hollywood immersion, aside from those gauzy profiles that NBC likes to shove between Olympic events, is the 1986 turkey ''American Anthem
," starring Mitch Gaylord and Janet Jones. The girls in ''Stick It" are bigger divas, have cleverer lines (justifying her non-regulation sleeveless uniform, one girl says she has the right to bare arms), and perform more unwitting tributes to Busby Berkeley.
The writer and director is Jessica Bendinger, who also wrote the more progressive and more exciting cheerleading farce ''Bring It On." ''Stick It" is a melodrama that doesn't know when to turn off the waterworks. Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a former star gymnast who, after a freak family revelation at the world championships, suffered a mental collapse. She didn't complete the floor exercise, and disqualified the entire American team. Now she's turned into a delinquent who dresses like Kevin Federline.
Hardheaded Haley gets arrested. But luckily, her trip to juvie is rerouted to a gymnastics facility in Houston, where she'll spend the remaining 90 or so minutes teaching her coach (Jeff Bridges) what he should have learned in 1984: that girls want to have fun. Haley schools teammates about the joys of rule breaking. Soon even the dum-dum diva (Vanessa Lengies) is considering taking the night off to go to the prom. By the time of the Climactic Championship Event, the trend becomes clear. Rebellion is the new conformity.
This might have been more pleasing had a whiff of maturity crept into the proceedings. But Bendinger is aiming for little girls, which explains why the movie always looks and feels like a commercial for gum or makeup or ring tones. The cast isn't bad, though. Peregrym is like a secondhand Hilary Swank. She has a looser presence and might be a better actor, but since we already have Swank, finding out is not a priority.
Bridges gives another one of his entertainingly half-there performances. If you close your eyes, he could be the president in ''The Contender" all over again. I wish I knew what he was doing here, but he appears to be having a good enough time, so it's pointless to dwell on it. He gets to mumble gymnast commands in sneakers and tracksuits, and seem stern and stoned, yet encouraging. For the girls in the audience, what he and Peregrym are doing is ''Million Dollar Baby," a version that's free of tragedy but not Splenda.


         Genre-defying, credibility-defying and attention-deficit-defying, "Stick It" feels like a movie made with a hacked Sony PlayStation and a box of crayons. "Bring It On" screenwriter Jessica Bendinger makes her feature directing debut and treats it like it's her last, throwing in every conceivable mood and stylistic gizmo available.
 
  Aimed squarely at girls who watch the Disney Channel but like to sneak over to MTV when their parents aren't around, "Stick It" is the story of Haley Graham (newcomer Missy Peregrym, who looks like a cross between Jessica Biel and Hilary Swank). Haley is a 17-year-old former world-class gymnast now fond of performing X-Games maneuvers on her dirt bike and striking defiant poses.
 


         






    Haley's middle name would appear to be Attitude, and Bendinger does everything in her power to assure we understand that she's a rebel — though her attire would appear to have come from Urban Outfitters and those mall stores that sell reissues of old punk T-shirts. Her parents are divorced — hmm, wonder what that could mean? — and a run-in with the law gets her sentenced to the dreaded VGA.
 
  No, not the Video Game Awards, but the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy, run by the no-nonsense Burt Vickerman, played by Jeff Bridges, who starts off like a cross between Tom Landry and Johnny Cash but ends up wearing that beatific smile from "Starman."
 
  Gymnastics, apparently, is full of a lot of silly rules and conformist behavior, and Haley wants no part of it. Burt wants her to consider that she's wasting her talent. The 800-pound gorilla lurking in the room is Haley's walkout two years earlier at the world championships that cost her teammates a gold medal.
 
  Comedy or drama, satire or farce, it's anybody's guess what the film hoped to project. There seems to be a certain reverence for the hard work and discipline that go into elite gymnastics, but at the same time, Bendinger's one-dimensional characters don't reflect terribly well on that world if we are to believe the air-headed athletes, their desperate stage mothers, the ridiculous Eastern European assistant coaches and the prissy, uptight judges.
 
  The stilted, sitcom dialogue is broken up by training and competition montages that are essentially music videos (of which the director is a veteran) meant to distract from how lame the story is. The film strives for some type of a girl-empowerment message that equates trading one type of conformity for another with self-determination but muffs the dismount and stumbles on the landing. In other words, it fails to "Stick It."
 
 'Stick It'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for some crude remarks
 
 A Buena Vista Pictures Distribution release. Writer-director Jessica Bendinger. Producer Gail Lyon. Director of photography Daryn Okada. Editor Troy Takaki.
 
 Running time: 1 hour, 42 minutes.   

A deliriously, defiantly unfocused headrush, Stick It  is primarily an exercise in exercise. It's a sports movie that rather hates its sport gymnastics and mercilessly claws at its hidebound conventions, even as the camera lovingly, lavishly music-videos every vault, every layout, every straining sinew. ''Love the gymnast, hate the gymnastics'' seems to be the message. Our very ripped heroine is Haley (Missy Peregrym), a troubled former tumbler well on her way to sanitized Disney delinquency (property damage, black T-shirts) until she's forced to train under a flinty coach (Jeff Bridges). In a thrilling if wholly unearned twist, Haley teaches her fellow leotards that individuality trumps conformity. But Stick It  is written and directed by Bring It On  scribe Jessica Bendinger, so really, sass trumps everything.

 A spry teenage comedy that gets everything right, "Stick It" takes the usual batch of underdogs, dirt bags, mean girls and bimbos and sends them somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention. As is to be hoped from a chick flick set in the world of elite gymnastics, the sass crackles, the soundtrack pops (to hip-hop, punk and Perry Como) and there are plentiful scenes, cleverly shot, of teenagers in leotards triple flipping with aplomb.  Jeff Bridges — bonus!  —  brings a center of gravity to these whirl-a-gig diversions as the affable Burt Vickerman, gymnastics guru semi-extraordinaire. Into his no-nonsense arms tumbles the resourceful and radiant Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym), an ex-champion turned slacker with a chip on her shoulder and a skeleton in her closet.  "Stick It" is the not-quite-predictable story of Haley's return to competition and how she liberates her past, learns its lessons and is joined by her teammates in leveraging this knowledge against the Man (here represented by uptight parents and judges with grudges).  It is a triumph for the writer and director Jessica Bendinger, who brings a sly eye and avid imagination to every scene, springing fresh rhythms and bold colors out of the formulaic material.  Not to be a killjoy, but the best stuff here isn't the cartwheels scored to Talib Kweli, excellent as they are, nor the bitchy banter about how totally "leotarded"  an outfit is. Culminating in a defiant act of subversion and solidarity, "Stick It" knows that some games are won by refusing to play. Forget girl-power bromides; here's a movie that lets young women reclaim their bodies (skilled, scrutinized, criticized and exploited) in order to embody genuine populism.  It's a lot of fun to see a genre movie leap over expectations; it's downright dizzying to watch it bounce on an ethos of spandex-clad resistance.  "Stick It" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Brash teenage girls speak their rude native tongue.

Stick It" doesn't. The use of the prim but rigorous world of women's gymnastics as a setting for teen rebellion is so strained it leaves the pic's ode to personal authenticity feeling as phony as a dubious decision by a competition judge. Pushing forward the smack-talking, competitive spirit that auds enjoyed in her script for "Bring It On," writer-director Jessica Bendinger peppers the screen with musicvid-style spark even as her dialogue falls flat. Girls will teem the multiplexes for at least the opening frame, but pic's shortage of sheer fun could dampen the final B.O. score. 
One thing "Stick It" proves -- as if further proof were needed -- is the continued reliability and engagement that Jeff Bridges brings to his roles. In a part he could easily have phoned in, Bridges gives the movie its only genuine pulse as a gym coach known for his hard and manipulative ways.
A character that could have been a bully or worse in another actor's hands is a complicated soul in Bridges' -- too complicated, in fact, for the pic to really know what to do with him.
The film certainly doesn't know what to do with Haley (Missy Peregrym), first seen being arrested for causing major property damage while performing free-styling biking stunts in a Plano, Texas, suburban development.
The gruff Haley is a repeat offender who turns out to have been one of the country's most gifted gymnasts before throwing it all away two years prior by walking out on her team during world championships.
Now, her options are juvie prison or something called "VGA" -- the Vickerman Gymnastic Academy in Houston, run by the no-nonsense Burt Vickerman (Bridges).
At first, Burt's sleek, massive factory for little gym medalists looks like a refreshing shift from the standard high school setting of countless teen movies, but the tale becomes quickly routine. Scowling Haley must contend with the living stereotype of a goody-good teammate Joanne (Vanessa Lengies), who calls the ostracized Haley "Pariah Carey."
Haley knows she's good, but hates the sport's silly rules and picayune details that weigh propriety above sheer athleticism and style. Burt understands this, and if "Stick It" had taken this core idea and run with it in an original way, a charged comedy about youth-inflected sports and attitudes could have emerged.
But Bendinger opts for a truly inane third-act stunt: Revolting against the judges' annoying scoring, the girls stage mass forfeits so that only one competitor will be left in each event, thus removing the judges' power.
Such badly conceived anti-establishment strokes might win over the most impressionable auds, but the film appears to throw its commitment to the sport's details right out the window.
And without a smart comedic style to push it along, even a series of visual nods to Busby Berkeley (overhead shots of gymnasts in unison) and a snappy sequence of fast-flying leapers on the bars can't rescue matters.
Playing opposite Bridges' crusty coach, Peregrym is overshadowed. Her rebel-girl persona never feels like the real deal, though lines like "I'm so sure, I'm practically deodorant" don't help.
Lengies nails Joanne's stuck-up bitchiness, but the intrusion of Haley's Plano biker dude buddies (Kellan Lutz, John Patrick Amedori) hundreds of miles from Houston makes no sense, and threatens to spin the pic into "Napoleon Dynamite" territory.
Lenser Daryn Okada adds considerable visual dazzle, especially with a Spydercam device that turns the gym stunts into a high-speed flight-sequencing pattern. Gymnast and stunt doubles for thesps really take a pounding.
