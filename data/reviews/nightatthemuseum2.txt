'People, Mr. Daly, want the next thing," says a character to ex-museum guard Larry Daly (Ben Stiller) in "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian," and there's Hollywood's rationale for sequelitis in an over-budgeted, computer-generated nutshell. The follow-up to the surprise 2006 hit movie reeks of No. 2: It's bigger, noisier, shinier, and dumber, and it has no earthly reason to exist. The kids will scarf it down like junk food and move on.
Still, let's savor the few pieces of wit that have made it through the sausage factory intact. First and foremost is Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah, the villainous Egyptian pharaoh who rules over Washington's Smithsonian Archives when night falls and the magic tablet of the first film animates the exhibits. The actor combines Boris Karloff's plummy diction from the original "Mummy" with a lisp worthy of Monty Python's Michael Palin; you could close your eyes and have a ball just listening to him, but then you'd miss Azaria's slyly hammy way with a tunic.
Also inspired is the way the paintings, sculptures, and photographs in the complex's fine arts wing come alive, from a pirouetting Degas ballerina to a bouncing Jeff Koons balloon dog. At one point the heroes take refuge in a blowup of Alfred  Eisenstaedt's famous snapshot of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square, and for a head-spinning moment we're in a black-and-white '40s movie, complete with guys from Flatbush.
The rest is inane, overstuffed frenzy. The plot has the exhibits from New York's Museum of Natural History mothballed and shipped to gather dust in the Smithsonian's warehouses; Larry journeys down to rescue his friends, rediscover his calling in life (successful businessman, bad; museum guard, good), and woo the plucky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams). Since she's slated to turn to wood at dawn, there's not a lot of future in the relationship.
What's most galling about "Battle of the Smithsonian" is its waste of real talent. Robin Williams's Teddy Roosevelt is left behind in New York and the pairing of Owen Wilson's itty-bitty cowboy and Steve Coogan's miniature Octavius is a bust this time. (Coogan looks actively depressed to be here.)
Of the new characters, Adams's Earhart is a flighty pill with no resemblance to the woman herself, Alain Chabat's Napoleon is the butt of wheezy short jokes, and why cast Christopher Guest as Ivan the Terrible if you're going to smother him in fake whiskers and not let him do anything? Bill Hader's General George Custer is typical of the movie's approach: Hire a "funny" actor, roll the cameras, and let him schpritz until he runs out of gas. It's a family film  - who needs a script?
It's possible that the people responsible for this movie  - director Shawn Levy and writers Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon  - think they're teaching kids about history. Well, no, they're dumbing down history to the shopping-mall level of rapping cherubim, a jive-talking Abe Lincoln, and a crew of Albert Einstein bobbleheads singing "That's the Way I Like It." "Battle of the Smithsonian" is to the first movie what a gift shop is to a museum: a hallway full of overpriced bling you pass through on your way out the door.

Usually, when characters in a movie are one-dimensional, that's not a good thing. But in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian , the waxworks figures who come to life after sundown aren't crassly sketchy or dramatically lacking. They're one-dimensional, all right, but knowingly, delightfully so. Even at their most pop-up brash, they're true to the way that kids see history. They're like characters out of a cool yet innocent mischief-at-midnight children's book  a Where the Wild Things Are  of global story-time kitsch. And they give you a lift.
The movie, make no mistake, is clownishly silly, a lark as light as balsa wood. If anything, though, it's a faster, wittier spin on the formula of its predecessor. Released in 2006, Night at the Museum  was a family popcorn extravaganza that touched a chord even its producers may not have anticipated. In the sequel, Ben Stiller, as the former night guard Larry Daley (he's now a successful entrepreneur...of flashlights!), spends one long night infiltrating the galleries of the Smithsonian Institution, where he   attempts to rescue the exhibits he first got to know at the American Museum of Natural History. (He's trying to get his hands on the magical Egyptian tablet that brings them to life.)
The T.rex , the capuchin monkeys, Attila the Hun  all have been shipped to the archives of the Smithsonian. And all are as feisty as ever. But Battle of the Smithsonian  tilts away from the zoological. The film is a history-of-the-world burlesque in which such drolly self-centered icons as General Custer (Bill Hader), Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), and Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria)  a made-up pharoah who lisps with the enthusiasm of Boris Karloff on his own reality show  collide happily with  a living army of Albert Einstein bobblehead dolls, plus stone-carved angels who sing ''More Than a Woman'' and The Thinker  come to life as a Brooklyn deadbeat. This is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs.
It all works because Stiller, with his eager-to-please anxiety and his incredulous double takes, is the perfect addled straight man for a hellzapoppin history show. And it works because Amy Adams, as Amelia Earhart, has the breathless, daffy-sexy vivacity of a '30s screwball heroine, her eyes lit with fire, her delivery as sharp as cut glass as she rat-a-tats out lines like ''You haven't been able to take your cheaters off my chassis since we met!'' Battle of the Smithsonian  has plenty of life. But it's Adams who gives it zing.

 The paradox of “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian” is that a movie so bursting with novelty can feel so utterly familiar. This is partly because it’s a sequel, of course, but even the first “Night at the Museum,” directed, as this one is, by Shawn Levy, was a mixture of old hat and cool new stuff.  That may just be the formula for pleasant, innocuous and intermittently thrilling family entertainment. Keep the emotions safe, simple and knowable, and focus the younger audience’s attention on a magic show of cute, funny, zany creatures and characters while throwing some half-clever verbal humor at the older kids and the accompanying parents. Apply a touch of prestige, on loan from widely admired educational and cultural institutions and voilà. You can’t lose.  Where Ben Stiller fits in all of this remains a bit of a puzzle, but here he is again, a virtuoso of hostility playing the lead in a warm and fuzzy family comedy.  Mr. Stiller is Larry Daley, whose learning of an important life lesson (as in the first installment), frames the nocturnal shenanigans that are the movie’s reason for being. In “Night at the Museum” he was a drifting divorced dad who needed to reconnect with his son and learn to follow his dreams. Now, having followed them to unlikely success as an inventor and late-night infomercial star, he must again reconnect with his very patient son (Jake Cherry) and also learn to stop following his dreams, or follow different ones, or something.  Whatever. Mr. Stiller’s two best scenes involve his sparring with the always welcome Jonah Hill and being slapped around by a couple of monkeys. Otherwise he’s on hand to be a grinning, bossy, anxious foil for the various historical figures and artworks that spring magically to life when the sun goes down. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are back as Jedediah and Octavius, two miniature warriors from different epochs (one cowboy, one Roman), and Robin Williams takes another turn as Teddy Roosevelt. There are some bobble-headed Einsteins, a giant marble Abraham Lincoln (who steps down off his memorial to knock a few heads together), Gen. George Custer (Bill Hader) and a smattering of classic paintings, sculptures and photographs.  The conjuring of all these artifacts — many of them really on display in various parts of Smithsonian —  is delightful and often ingenious. Whether the movie pays irreverent homage to cultural treasures or trivializes them for fun and profit is an interesting question. It seems to me that, by jolting inanimate objects into action-movie service, “Night at the Museum” does its part to encourage the museum world’s embrace of spectacle, sensationalism and pseudo-pedagogical pop-cultural pandering. (A brief attempt to mock this tendency is by far the least convincing thing in the movie.)  So don’t take your children expecting that they’ll learn anything. But if you do take them, you will at least be able to enjoy Hank Azaria and Amy Adams, who play a fictitious pharaoh named Kahmunrah and the famed aviatrix Amelia Earhart. Historical accuracy is not the point. No Egyptian potentate ever spoke in a lisping, aristocratic British accent, but Mr. Azaria is the master of funny voices, and he does fine work as the heavy. Ms. Adams, impersonating Earhart as a flame-haired screwball-comedy heroine, is entirely delightful, though whether the pioneering pilot would ever have developed a crush on Ben Stiller is a matter for scholars to ponder. Perhaps the only such matter in this shallow and harmlessly diverting picture.  “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some noisy fights and moments of apparent danger.

Bigger, longer, and even more chaotically crowded (more stars! more f/x!) than its predecessor, "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian" proves that adding another ring doesn't make for a better circus. Swapping Gotham's Natural History Museum for D.C.'s Smithsonian, this "Night at the Museum" sequel reunites Ben Stiller's ex-security guard with former cast members and adds dozens more. But where the original had a vaguely tenable narrative hook (deadbeat dad finds redemption through nocturnal heroics), the new pic seems purely a vehicle for lavish visuals and cheap gags. Still, the 2006 comedy-adventure soared past tepid reviews to a $574 million global B.O.; chances are this "Night" also will be a mammoth success.
The woolly mammoth that stomped through the original is back, albeit briefly, as now-successful inventor/entrepreneur Larry Daley (Stiller) revisits his old digs, the Museum of Natural History, and we're briefly reminded of the ancient curse that caused the museum denizens to spring to life. Still there: the miniature figurines Octavius (Steve Coogan) and Jedediah (Owen Wilson); a playful dinosaur fossil and mischievous monkey; and a waxworks Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams).
But when museum director Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) explains that the longtime exhibits are about to be shipped to D.C.'s Federal Archives, discarded in favor of high-tech holographic displays, Larry realizes he may never see the gang again.
That doesn't seem to bother him too much until he receives a distress call from Jed telling him the grumpy Egyptian ruler Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria, sounding like a cross between Daffy Duck and Jeremy Irons) has awakened from a 3,000-year rest only to set his sights on global domination. Urged by his son (Jake Cherry), Larry speeds to the Smithsonian, steals a badge from an easily impressed junior guard (Jonah Hill) and breaks into the archives.
Amid a virtual sea of storage crates -- there's even a leviathan squid! -- Larry finds the gang and tries to engineer an escape. Plucky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams, trying a bit too hard) joins him, only to be matched by a trio of history's worst villains: Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), Napoleon (French comic Alain Chabat) and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal), who've united with Kahmunrah to create the ultimate axis of evil.
But wait, there's more: Abe Lincoln (also voiced by Azaria) steps out of his chair at the Lincoln Memorial to pitch in, Albert Einstein (voiced by Eugene Levy) helps solve a mathematical riddle, and Gen. George Custer (Bill Hader) stands around trying to decide what to do.
If there's no kitchen sink in here, it's probably because the filmmakers (returning helmer Shawn Levy and scribes Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon) couldn't devise a way to work one in. Instead of adding a plethora of new distractions, perhaps they should have focused on Larry's motivation. He seems to have very little at stake in this battle, and it's tough to know why we're supposed to root for him.
One clever new element involves the animating of classic artworks (among them Degas' "Little Dancer"; Wood's "American Gothic," Hopper's "Nighthawks"). The gimmick works to varying effect -- sometimes brilliantly (the sight of Jeff Koons' "Balloon Dog Red" hopping about is priceless); sometimes offensively (did Rodin's "Thinker" really need a Bronx accent?).
One all-too-brief sequence even has Larry and Amelia jumping into the celebrated Alfred Eisenstaedt Times Square photo "The Kiss," surrounded by WWII veterans against a black-and-white cityscape. (It also sets up a joke that will pay off later; watch for Jay Baruchel in a quickie cameo.)
The chaos escalates into a whiz-bang collision of f/x involving the Octopus, the Wright Brothers, the Tuskegee airmen and too much of everything but what made Larry likable in the first film. Production design and lensing and general tech credits are top notch, even if Alan Silvestri's score is overblown.
There is, however, one very positive consequence of the original film worth noting: In the wake of "Night at the Museum," the Museum of Natural History reported attendance was up 20%, particularly among kids whose interest was sparked by the film. The museum even began hosting Night at the Museum Sleepovers that still continue. If the Smithsonian sees a similar attendance surge and an increased interest in art and history thanks to this movie, then this "Night at the Museum" may be worth the trouble.


Wide-eyed kids, attended by their pouchy-eyed parents, will have few complaints about Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian ; all you people in between and beyond could do worse as well. Director Shawn Levy  and star Ben Stiller  return (as do Robin Williams , Steve Coogan , and Owen Wilson —alongside newbies Bill Hader , Jonah Hill , Christopher Guest , and Jay Baruchel ) for this bank-breaking sequel to the 2006 original, in which a directionless single dad takes a job as the night guard at New York's Museum of Natural History, then takes on its various exhibits when an ancient Egyptian tablet brings them to life. Smithsonian  begins with those same exhibits being shipped off to the Washington, D.C., museum of the same name, Larry Daley  (Stiller) having abandoned them for fortune as a small-time inventor. When the tablet winds up in D.C., it animates the entire museum's collection, including a rogue posse led by a lisping Egyptian pharaoh (Hank Azaria ) and a gratingly plucky Amelia Earhart  (Amy Adams ). Though it's a little slow to start and some of the humor clunks, the film features a wholesome charm, some truly dazzling effects (the Lincoln Memorial  alone is worth it), and enough mild, parent-nip in-jokes to keep all but the stone-hearted happy.
