A subject that might, had it been made conventionally, have repped just another docu about a war atrocity, is transmuted via novel use of animation into something special, strange and peculiarly potent in �Waltz With Bashir.� Israeli helmer Ari Folman�s fourth feature spotlights a drawn version of Folman himself on a quest to remember what transpired during the 1982 massacres at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon where he served as a soldier. Although less immediately accessible than �Persepolis,� another mature-aud-skewed cartoon with which this is bound to be compared, �Bashir� could dance nimbly round arthouse niches offshore.
The look and feel of �Waltz With Bashir� is very different from Iranian-born Marjane Satrapi�s �Persepolis,� although both use animation to refract recent Middle-Eastern history through the lenses of each helmer�s own personal experience.
Satrapi sought to channel autobiography through an austere, black-and-white style that evoked illustrations in children�s literature. Folman, on the other hand, utilizes a more minutely detailed, realist graphic technique for �Bashir� that texturally looks more like the Rotoscoped animation seen in Richard Linklater�s �Waking Life� and �A Scanner Darkly.�
Here, video-filmed interviews were used as visual references to create reportage focusing on one key historical event: Israel�s 1982 invasion of Beirut and, more specifically, the massacres of Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila camps by the Christian Phalangist militia, which Folman and his fellow Israeli soldiers witnessed and failed to stop, that happened in the wake of Lebanese president Bashir Gemayel�s assassination. 
Folman is effectively an onscreen (but animated) narrator and reporter here, whose interviews with other soldiers (voiced by the real people themselves, apart from two individuals) form the film�s narrative spine. Each interviewee�s story is illustrated, with often startling results.
A striking credit sequence featuring a pack of hounds kicks the pic off in style. It turns out to be the recurring dream of Folman�s army friend Boaz (voiced by thesp Miki Leon because the real �Boaz� preferred anonymity), still haunted by the memories of the 26 dogs he had to shoot in order to silence them while on maneuvers. 
Advised by his best friend Ori Silvan, who sagely warns Folman about the ungraspable nature of memory, Folman begins a quest to find out what really happened, to himself and others, by interviewing friends and acquaintances fighting in Lebanon when the massacres happened. 
Carmi (voiced by Hezkel Lazarov, because �Carmi� like �Boaz� wished not to be recognized), an old schoolfriend of Folman�s, recalls the weirdly party-like atmosphere on the transport boat over, and a bizarre dream of his own in which a beautiful giantess carried him off into the sea. It�s these surreal touches, deployed with tactical restraint, that make the pic extraordinary and convey the febrile atmosphere of warfare, where by fear, horror -- and later guilt -- distort and distend perception and memory.
Another man, Shmuel Frenkel, recalls gunning down an adolescent boy after the kid fired a rocket-propelled grenade at them. A story told by journalist Ron Ben Yisahi about seeing Frenkel seemingly �waltzing� with his gun, shooting at everything in sight during an exchange of fire in Beirut�s streets where posters of Bashir Gemayel were visible everywhere, gives the pic its name. 
As the interlocking tales spiral the narrative closer to the events at Sabra and Shatila, the visuals become more matter-of-fact and less hallucinatory, as if Folman were trying to strip everything back to some bare essential truth, encapsulated by the pic�s final shots, live-action archive footage.
Some auds may quibble that ultimately the atrocity isn�t tackled in a more head-on fashion and that Palestinian and Phalangist viewpoints aren�t aired, but Folman�s sidewinding approach feels justified by the pic�s personal, idiosyncratic approach.
Stabs of gallows humor up until this point slightly soothe the grimness depicted. Meanwhile, the interviewees� digressions and off-the-cuff comments build up a picture of what it was like to be young, Israeli and conscripted in the early �80s, a time well evoked by a smartly chosen soundtrack featuring beat combos of the era, such as PiL and OMD. 
The animation process used reps a combination of Flash animation, traditional hand-drawn technique, and computer-enhanced 3-D modeling that sometimes, perhaps intentionally, looks a little disjointed. Characters� expressions are simplified, while outlines and shadows are pronounced and thick, evoking German Expressionist woodcuts, yet backgrounds are more finely detailed and fluently rendered. Palette is subtly color-coded to underscore time shifts between flashback and present.
Crisp and appropriately aggressive sound design by Aviv Aldema reps a standout in the pic�s pro tech package. 


Ari Folman 's broodingly original Waltz With Bashir —one of the highlights of the last New York Film Festival—is a documentary that seems only possible, not to mention bearable, as an animated feature.
Folman, whose magic realist youth film Saint Clara  was one of the outstanding Israeli films of the 1990s, has created a grim, deeply personal phantasmagoria around the 1982 invasion of Lebanon . Waltz With Bashir , named for Bashir Gemayel , the charismatic hero of the Christian militias that allied themselves with Israel , is an illustrated oral history based on interviews that Folman conducted with former comrades, which mixes dreams with their incomplete or conflicting recollections.
Waltz With Bashir  opens with a pack of slavering dogs rampaging through nocturnal Tel Aviv —the dramatization of a recurring nightmare experienced by one of Folman's friends. His assignment, when entering a Lebanese village, had been to silence the dogs because "they knew I couldn't shoot a person." One dream triggers another: Folman, who claims to have forgotten everything about his wartime experiences, has his sleep disturbed by a vision of soldiers, naked save for their dog tags and Uzis, drifting zombie-like out of the ocean onto Beirut 's posh hotel strip. That which has been repressed returns with startling ferocity.
Although it can be highly explicit in detailing war's horror, Waltz With Bashir  is mainly concerned with the recollection of trauma. There's a therapeutic aspect to the project—not surprising in that Folman is one of the creators of the popular Israeli TV show that inspired HBO 's psychoanalytic drama In Treatment . Folman's dream prompts him to roust an analyst friend at 6:30 a.m. and then, encouraged by the analyst's suggestion, begin tracking down the men with whom he served, as a means of recovering or even re-implanting his own memories of the war.
"Uncontrollable fear" merges with megalomania. A tank rolls into a Lebanese city, casually crushing parked cars and backing up into buildings, until the commander is shot—at which point the soldiers abandon their weapons and flee in total panic. One former soldier recalls his terror-induced vision of a beautiful giantess who rose out of the sea and allowed him to float away nestled on her body as the transport boat was incinerated. Experience is scarcely less fantastic: The sole survivor of an ambush crouches for hours behind a rock until, under cover of darkness, he swims south and is washed ashore, only to be found by the regiment that abandoned him.
Abetted by Max Richter 's ominous martial score, Waltz With Bashir  matches a grim sense of estrangement with a distinctively alienated look. The thick-lined, near-monochromatic animation is frequently bathed in an eerie yellow light. Folman has said that his documentary was always intended to be an animated feature—the first ever made in Israel. The interviews were staged and videotaped, with the animators basing their drawings on the video material rather than using a rotoscopic process to transform the original into animation.
The tension inherent in Folman's method is reproduced throughout the film; Waltz With Bashir  takes ambivalence as a formal principle. Lebanon 1982 not only merges with present-day Israel but also with an earlier generation's memories of World War II. The war's hallucinatory aspect is heightened by the home front's surreal proximity to the battlefield, both in Tel Aviv and Beirut where Israeli soldiers take sniper fire as civilians watch from hotel terraces. Folman's unresolved guilt is at once personal and socially symptomatic—and either way, an internal Israeli issue. Waltz With Bashir  nevertheless inexorably builds to the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, an atrocity which the Israeli army  tacitly enabled but didn't commit and which Folman believes he has repressed but never actually experienced.
Linking the slaughter of the Palestinians to the experience of Folman's parents in Auschwitz , the filmmaker's analyst-friend points out that "the massacre has been with you since you were six." In its final convulsive minutes, Waltz With Bashir  goes to graphic news footage—breaking the subjective spell with the full, awful weight of TV images that constitute collective memory.
