Let�s just cut to the chase straight off, okay? If you play the video game Doom 
 � that�s the one that popularlized this whole "first-person shooter" thing way back in the mid Nineties � then chances are you�re going to want to see this film. It�s a generally accurate representation of the gaming scenario, and a chief component of the film�s final reel is an actual cinematic doppelganger of home play: The audience views the onscreen action via the first-person viewpoint for four uninterrupted minutes as Marine badass Reaper (Urban) blows all manner of creepy zombies and hybrid slug-lamprey beasties to hell. So I guess that�s cool if you�re into that. If you don�t play the video game Doom
, then likely as not your mind�s going to snap like an ancient rubber band. Doom
 is based on a wildly popular video game � not quite as popular as Halo
, mind you � and its plot reflects that. Briefly, a portal to Mars is discovered in the Nevada desert and, before you know it, American scientists are up there being devoured by God knows what (in the original video game it was demons from hell; here, it�s bio-engineered monster humanoids). What to do? Send in the Marines! Enter the Rock as shiny-toothed Sarge, followed by Carl Urban�s Reaper, followed by the lascivious, thoroughly un-PC Goat (Daniels), and so forth and so on. Luckily, there�s no backstory of any sort to get in the way of the film�s hellbent charge forward to slaughter, which, come to think of it, is just like the source material. Admittedly, it�s fun to see the Rock going all gushy-eyed over a piece of weapons hardware (the formidable BFG; you can probably figure out the acronym on your own), and Doom
 also scores highly with its nonstop cavalcade of creepy critters (hellspawn or not), including one downright vile imp that looks like an albino manatee crossed with an In-Sink-Erator. (Finally, I know what my dog�s going to dress up as on Halloween night.) There�s no character development to speak of because there are no real characters, just the living and the dead and the soon-to-be-dead (or undead), and in the end Doom
 is so niche-marketed to gamers that it might as well not be considered a film at all: It�s a marketing tie-in, albeit one with some exceptional production values. Director Bartkowiak�s pulled DP duties on everything from Prizzi�s Honor
 to Speed
, and Doom
 looks good, sort of like James Cameron�s Aliens
 but with even more claustrophobia. But who am I kidding? Go for the gore (there�s lots of it), but stay for the immortal line: "Now let's go find the body this arm belongs to."


Life is too short for ''Doom." But those who plan to attend Universal's loose adaptation of the beloved computer game should be warned that while half a dozen archeologists have disappeared from Olduvai, a Martian space station, five times as many IQ points are gone too.
To find the missing scientists, a ragtag team of Marines is dispatched to Olduvai via teleportation. Their mission is to shut down the station to prevent whatever has run amok from getting to Earth.
What's run amok is a creature that kills and infects, creating zombies and worse. The Marines, who are led by the unflaggingly charismatic Dwayne ''The Rock" Johnson, make a shocking discovery that the gamers in the audience already know. The monstrous conditions are the result of a nutty experiment involving the unmapped 10 percent of the human genome!
But enough about that: There are cave-dwelling special effects to shoot up and silly dialogue to say. ''Now let's see if we can find the body that goes with that arm" is one choice instruction.
''Doom" is dreary-looking and painfully slow, but it's not terrible. Even if Andrzej Bartkowiak's direction never rises above straight-to-video schlock (the film's look and tempo are intensely ''Highlander III: The Sorcerer"), the screenplay by David Callaham and the veteran Wesley Strick supplies enough tolerable ridiculousness to make up for the pitiful absence of suspense.
For that family-values feeling, one of the Marines, John ''Reaper" Grimm (Karl Urban), has an estranged twin sister (Rosamund Pike) at Olduvai, who's been holding a grudge since he decided not to go into anthropology like the rest of the family. ''You could have spent your life looking through a microscope instead of a sniper scope," she raps. We can tell they're twins, because neither actor can quite keep a lid on those non-American accents.
As inoffensive as all this is, watching ''Doom" means spending 100-odd minutes slogging around a set that looks an awful lot like a sewer. The movie is clammy. But for fans of the game, ''Doom" pays you tribute with its best sequence, in which we get to see the slaughter of creatures from Reaper's perspective. It's a cheeky, absurd, exhilarating slice of rock 'n' roll moviemaking.
It's also depressing. The only way this movie becomes any fun is when it stops impersonating a game and simply becomes one.


         The jaded palate approaches "Doom" with little to hope for except quick and dirty ingestion. No problem. Imagine all four "Alien" movies compacted, boiled in chicken fat and then pumped with steroids. Imagine the rush. Imagine the peril to a weak metabolism.
 
  But such peril would presume empathy or involvement with the characters on the screen. And "Doom," adapted from one of the more popular and savage video games, shows less human dimension than the new Wallace and Gromit movie.
 


         






    To give narrative grounding to the game, "Doom's" producers create a motley seven-man commando squad led by a hard-case sergeant named (really, what are the odds?) Sarge (Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson). Their mission involves going to an ancient portal leading directly to Mars, where something unknown and, quite likely, unspeakable has laid waste to a team of genetic scientists.
 
  Just another search-and-destroy mission, Sarge thinks. Nothing his guys haven't seen and survived before. But there are huge, crusty beasts prowling the blood-caked corridors of the Martian laboratory. One by one, the strike force gets mangled, chewed and all but spit out by these things.
 
  Sarge, of course, is curious to know what's killing everybody off.
 
  The standard-issue comely blond scientist (Rosamund Pike) thinks it has something to do with a "24th chromosome." (Did you know humans have 22? I guess I slept through that biology class.) Somehow, this chromosome was uncovered on Mars and, through the kind of reckless experimentation that leads to mass hysteria and cheesy dialogue, has mutated humans into super-powered maniacs capable of surviving anything, even death.
 
  Director Andrzej Bartkowiak is well-practiced in handling combustible, ludicrous pulp (see 2000's "Romeo Must Die" or 2001's "Exit Wounds"). But there was a visual crispness in those bumptious thrillers that's AWOL in "Doom." Johnson, who has shown ingratiating charm and ease of manner even in such unlikely movies as last year's "Walking Tall," is more slug than "Rock" here.
 
  Not that qualities such as "acting" count for much in this context. All gamers want to know about "Doom" is when it starts running amok. It takes a while.
 
  But when the vaunted "First Person Shooter" perspective kicks in, "Doom" shakes itself loose of its ponderous moorings and takes giddy flight. The serial carnage even takes on a satiric edge with blackout references to such horror touchstones as "Tales From the Crypt" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
 
  It may be that video-game movies work best when they behave like video games. Which shouldn't necessarily be taken as an endorsement of more movies like "Doom."

It's pretty clear by now that characters in sci-fi movies have never seen a sci-fi movie. Otherwise, tomorrowland marines like Sarge (The Rock, finally giving that eyebrow thing a rest), Reaper (The Lord of the Rings ' Karl Urban), and the rest of their rescue squad would know that those suddenly dead scientists on the Martian archaeological outpost  you know, the ones who experimented with chromosomes they found just lying around  surely hatched something evil. Still, by hewing close to James Cameron's Aliens  playbook, Doom  manages to escape the game-to-movie curse that afflicted Resident Evil , House of the Dead , and, well, every other movie based on a game. And unless you've been keeping tabs on how The Rock's career choices mirror Ah-nuld's, there's a nifty reversal at the end that you won't see coming.

 In "Doom," an estranged brother and sister meet on Mars, where she is a forensic archaeologist and he is a soldier sent to quell an uprising of mutants. Desperate to humanize the characters in this video game turned action flick, the writers came up with this bit of tension, when Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) chides her gifted brother for squandering his intellect: "Does it ever bother you that you could have spent your life looking into a microscope instead of a sniper scope?"  We expect a moral from a tale about the Grimms, but this claustrophobic mess of a movie offers only carnage. Well, somewhere in there is a bit of preachiness about tampering with DNA, and later, there's a vignette about military power run amok. But this spectacle is really just a formulaic shoot'em-up, with dead bodies amassing on the floor of an underground Martian laboratory.  Dwayne Johnson, the pro wrestler known as the Rock who now acts in movies, relies on his musculature and expressive eyebrows to play Sarge, a trigger-happy troop leader. ("We kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out," Sarge tells his troops.) Ms. Pike is convincing only in her desperation to flee the dark chambers of the space outpost, a dash for the exits that audiences will understand all too well.  "Doom" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic decapitations and eviscerations, and every known profanity.

Videogame geeks and LAN-party enthusiasts everywhere, prepare to meet your "Doom" -- because it's really not all that bad. Ultra-derivative bigscreen transplant of one of the most successful (and controversial) games ever made plays like a mutant cross between a biotech thriller and a zombie movie, with all the alien autopsies, blood-gushing protuberances and meaningless scientific jargon that come with the territory. Universal can expect Rock-solid biz from the fanboy crowd before advancing to the next level on video.
Launched in 1993 by id Software, the venerable "Doom" franchise -- an elaboration of the company's classic "Wolfenstein" and a forerunner of its hugely popular "Quake" -- helped popularize the first-person shooter genre while arousing much finger-wagging in the media over its graphic violence. For better or worse, there's nothing in "Doom" the movie that's likely to make anyone feel too upset -- or, for that matter, surprised.
Though it begins on Earth (in the year 2026), pic quickly whisks through a portal to a high-tech research facility on Mars, where eight men from the Rapid Response Tactical Squad are sent to investigate and contain a genetic experiment that's literally gone to hell. Something within the walled-off compound is attacking scientists and turning them into rabid flesh-eaters, a phenomenon that may be linked to a mysterious Martian specimen shown to possess an extra pair of chromosomes.
That's already more plot than the game -- with its fairly straightforward kill-anything-that-moves objective -- had time for, and helmer Andrzej Bartkowiak ("Romeo Must Die") allows for a rather shocking half-hour of exposition before the killing proper begins.
During that time, RRTS soldier John Grimm (Karl Urban), aka Reaper, has a tense reunion with his estranged sister, Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike). That's more or less the extent of the human drama, if you don't count the squad's hyper-militant leader Sarge (Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson) barking belligerently at his inferiors, who have names like Destroyer (DeObia Oparei), Goat (Ben Daniels) and the Kid (Al Weaver).
Visually, pic is rough and slipshod, offering a labyrinth of grimly underlit tunnels and corridors. Still, former d.p. Bartkowiak drums up reasonable levels of tension in the first half by keeping the fast-moving monsters (with creature effects by Stan Winston Studios) in the shadows or at the edges of the frame. Only near its conclusion does the film briefly revert to the game's first-person interface -- a gambit that, absent any element of viewer interactivity, produces "Doom's" least suspenseful passage.
Urban, who evinced a smoldering machismo during his all-too-brief moments in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, is in fine form as a stripped-down man of action, with the coolly self-possessed Pike providing a more than adequate counterpoint. Their mutual hostility -- military might vs. scientific progress -- reps only one of the pic's thematic and visual similarities to George Romero's "Day of the Dead."
Despite being the film's biggest B.O. draw, the Rock delivers a surprisingly humorless, uncommitted performance in an unusually villainous role. Johnson snarls and swears up a storm, but aside from a few trademark twitches of the eyebrow, he exhibits little of the easy charisma that has distinguished him among action stars.
While David Callaham and Wesley Strick's dialogue is generally of the "Keep your distance from the core, or you might get sucked in" variety, there's a mildly tongue-in-cheek sensibility at play here that devotees of the game will appreciate.
They'll also thrill to the weaponry on display, which includes faithful renderings of both the classic chainsaw and the notorious BFG, a gun to end all guns that is gleefully fetishized by the camera. Other innovations, such as the exploding barrels of toxic waste, presumably will show up in the sequel.

Yes, Doom  is a bad movie but you already knew that. If you have no patience for loud, illogical spectacles you don't need to be told to skip this one. If, however, you have a taste for mindless mayhem in the context of a video-game-inspired, zombies-on-Mars plot . . . "Hesitate and people die," ringleader Sarge (The Rock) warns wobbly-kneed rookie The Kid at the outset of their high-risk mission to a quarantined Martian laboratory. Adopting this maxim of recklessness, Doom  plows through 100 absurdly frenetic, whiplash-inducing minutes. Light on plot points that make sense, the story involves mutant monsters on Mars that are killing (maybe) human scientists indiscriminately (perhaps). Sarge's band of eliteand mostly derangedMarines is naturally prepared to do battle with the slimy beasts; they are also armed to the teeth with guns that make The Rock's BALCO -sized biceps look like little twigs. As dumb as they come, the entertaining Doom  might warrant a place in cinema history as the first movie in which someone rips off their own  ear.
