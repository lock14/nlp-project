In a bit of black irony any cynic would have to appreciate, the virus that decimates the world�s population in I Am Legend
 is the result of an unforeseen reaction to a miraculous new cancer vaccine. One minute that vaccine�s developer, Dr. Krippen (a brilliant, uncredited Emma Thompson), is informing the public that they can now feel free to smoke filterless cigarettes and lie out in the sun; the next, Manhattan is an overgrown wasteland where thousands of rusting, driverless cars fill the streets, and herds of lions roam through Central Park like it�s the African savanna. The Krippen Virus has killed 5.5 billion people, leaving the few unlucky souls who have an immunity alone with 500 million mutated, gray-skinned, rabid cannibals who come out at night to feast on the blood of the living and screech at great volumes. In this latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's apocalyptic science-fiction novel of 1954 (which has been previously adapted at least a couple of times as The Last Man on Earth
 with Vincent Price and The Omega Man
 starring Charlton Heston), Smith plays Robert Neville, a military immunologist who is the only real human left in New York. By day he wanders the city�s empty avenues with his German shepherd, Sam, scavenging for food and gasoline and borrowing every title at his local movie-rental house in alphabetical order; by night he barricades himself in his apartment with his rifle to watch DVDs and wait for the living dead to break down the door. All this happens during the film�s first 10 minutes, so initially I was optimistic. First of all, Lawrence�s desolate Manhattan is a wonder to behold. Devoid of human activity, the city, with its giant decaying billboards and skyscrapers, looks like the desperate cry of a species lashing out at inevitable extinction. And secondly, Smith�s Neville (who appears onscreen alone, or with his dog, throughout most of the movie) is a hero with real psychological potential. No unblinking model of action-film courage, he is terrified, lonely, and racked with guilt over his inability to save the lives of � well, anyone � a guilt he tries to assuage by working on a vaccine for the vaccine that will save humanity, not to mention his own soul. Unfortunately, after those first 10 minutes, it�s all downhill for I Am Legend
, as the film descends into a monster-movie malaise starring a horde of balding CGI monsters that look like refugees from a video game and that will scare absolutely no one, save those who worry that green-screening is ruining the movies. By the time another survivor, named Anna (Braga), shows up in the film�s third act with news of a possible safe colony in Vermont, I was so numb to the threat of cartoonish zombie horror that I found myself wondering how she had managed to get into Manhattan if all its bridges had been destroyed years before as part of a military quarantine. Did the National Guard forget to seal up the Holland Tunnel? And if so, did Anna still have to pay the toll?


...there's a way to survive. Especially for the star whose magnetism keeps 'I Am Legend' well-populated.
So here we are, in "I Am Legend," at the end of everything. Courtesy of Dr. Emma Thompson, the cure for cancer has wiped out just about the entire planet. Weeds and shrubs have taken over Park Avenue and Times Square in New York City. The tunnels are caves. The Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges have been blown up and now are just a set of frayed planks aching to touch each other once again. Oh, and there are actual lions on the loose, ready to steal a deer right from under your nose. This place really is a concrete jungle.
We've been dropped into a funky apocalyptic time warp where life has become postmodernly prehistoric: Come hunt and gather in your SUV! But "I Am Legend," is a pretty good hybrid: an old-fashioned Hollywood B-movie with seamless state-of-the-art production values. It's all built around two of the most reliable syllables in moviedom: Will Smith.
As virologist Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Robert Neville, Smith is the apparent sole survivor of this outbreak (in flashbacks, we glean what happened to Neville's wife, daughter, you, and me). And he has the entire city, the entire movie, and the entire audience to himself. His costars are just Neville's dog, Sam, and the colony of heliophobic freaks that come out at night. And watching Smith, near the peak of his charisma, do almost noth ing is more entertaining than seeing a lot of his peers try to do it all.
In much the way Tom Hanks used the occasion of being marooned on an island with a volleyball in "Cast Away" to plumb the depths of his actorly soul, Smith turns his solo gig into a fascinatingly cracked one-man show.
Neville talks to Sam ("eat your vegetables," etc.), fishes in the reflecting pool at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and watches old episodes of "Today" (aah, Matt and Katie together again). He looks for an antidote to the virus in the lab beneath his enviable Washington Square brownstone. (After one good sequence puts him in the zombies' maw, he sets a trap to catch one for experimental purposes; it's a girl.) Neville works out his body (on the treadmill and the pull-up bar), but eventually it's obvious this man is losing his mind in order to hold on to his humanity. For instance, he's turned his local video store into a diorama where he hits on one of the mannequins he's set up.
Neville's solitude curdles his loneliness into a type of furious derangement. At some point, Smith stands in front of a television set and recites the dialogue of "Shrek" as though it were some kind of psycho-spiritual beacon. He gives a wonderfully corny speech about Bob Marley being a virologist of love. "I Am Legend" is based on Richard Matheson's book, which was turned into a Vincent Price picture, "The Last Man on Earth," in 1964, and in 1971 became "The Omega Man," that great cult-circus with a chest-thwapping Charlton Heston, among other exciting nonsense. It's tough to imagine Heston extolling Marley as a proto-medical wonder.
A wild work of racial and socio-political hilarity set in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, "Omega Man" was a movie of its day. (It makes "Crash" look like "Steel Magnolias.") This new version, directed by Francis Lawrence and written by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman, is apolitical to the bone. It's also out of touch with its hero, who misreads a crucial plot point. When Neville captures his lady specimen, the head zombie - played by Dash Mihok - runs after Neville and into direct sunlight. Neville deduces that the zombie's almost frying himself represents the last stage of dehumanization. But the zombie leader wants his woman back. Isn't that a sign of life? Isn't that why the creatures come after Neville for the movie's big climax? It's hard to believe that the lonely man who argued so movingly about Bob Marley's infectiousness would misconstrue the passion of a lonely zombie. Neville should just have played him "Is This Love?"
Matheson's book is a series of piercingly concise sentences and no false moves. Its bluntness has an odd, tranquilizing effect. Lawrence's movie is somewhere between Matheson's eloquent efficiency and Steven Spielberg's excessively visionary doom in "War of the Worlds." Lawrence, a former music video director, shows patience before he lets hell break loose in the movie's second half. But this new version has no allegorical nerve, when it really could have used this story, the way the '71 version did, as a platform to be a movie of today.
"I Am Legend" is outside of time in that sense. It's neither a neat little allegory about faith nor a transcendently entertaining one. "I Am Legend" is actually about the last man on earth played by one of the last real movie stars on earth. To be honest, Smith was all I was thinking about while I sat through "I Am Legend."
You don't have to believe in this movie to believe in him. His ability to give himself over to a part remains underrated: He's just being Will Smith, it's true, but he is always being the best Will Smith he can be. When it comes to entertaining the pants off a paying customer or a tired movie critic, he is the Omega Man - if Charlton Heston doesn't mind my saying so.


In I Am Legend , Will Smith, as a U.S. Army officer who may be the last man on earth, drives at top speeds through the concrete valleys of Manhattan, which have been deserted for so long that the cracks in the roads now sprout scruffy green weeds. For sheer eeriness, that effect  the metropolis as vacant lot  far outdoes the desolate Times Square of Vanilla Sky , and Smith is the perfect actor (maybe almost too perfect) to play a survivor who has no one to talk to but his dog and himself. Smith has always worn his self-sufficiency like a suit of armor, often treating costars as sounding boards; he brings that jaunty insularity to the abandoned canyons of a trashed Twilight Zone  New York. Here, though, he also draws on the vulnerability he showed last year in The Pursuit of Happyness , suggesting a man whose sanity is beginning to fray.
Based on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel, I Am Legend  is a spooky-hokey postapocalyptic thriller built around our fear of contagion (the premise is that a ''miracle'' cancer cure has wiped out the earth's population). It's a movie that might have fit snugly into the zeitgeist had it been made in the early '90s, or maybe 1971  when, in fact, it was made as The Omega Man , a somber but colossally silly Charlton Heston thriller. Let's be honest: The peril of infectious disease, while quite real, is hardly the anxiety of the moment. In spirit, I Am Legend  is caught in some abstractly doom-laden sci-fi past. For what it is, though, the film is well-done, a case of suspenseful competence trumping questionable relevance.
There's one scary sequence in which Smith follows his dog into a warehouse, but as soon as you see the prancing, gnashing, veiny mutant humanoids who have taken up refuge there, you think, ''Okay, it's a fake-demon CGI movie.'' And so it is, though at least it never becomes a soulless monster-hunt videogame like Resident Evil . Smith, who keeps the movie grounded, isn't just surviving  he's on a mission. In The Omega Man , Heston faced a cult of white-faced hippie mutants in sunglasses and medieval monks' robes. Sometimes, CGI really is an advance.

 “Not if you were the last man on earth!” Plenty of guys have heard that line at some point in their lives, but it’s unlikely that Will Smith is one. His irresistible charm has been proved, above all, by his ability to attract audiences to bad movies like “Hitch” and “Wild Wild West,” as well as to better ones like “Ali” and “The Pursuit of Happyness.” In spite of its third-act collapse into obviousness and sentimentality, “I Am Legend” — in which Mr. Smith plays somebody with every reason to believe that he really is the last man on earth — is among the better ones.  And this star, whose amiability makes him easy to underestimate as an actor, deserves his share of the credit. There are not many performers who can make themselves interesting in isolation, without human supporting players. Tom Hanks did it in “Cast Away,” with only a volleyball as his buddy, foil and straight man. Mr. Smith has a few more companions, including an expressive German shepherd, some department store mannequins and a high-powered rifle. (There are also some flesh-eating, virus-crazed zombies, about which more in a moment.) But it is the charismatic force of his personality that makes his character’s radical solitude scary and fascinating, as well as strangely appealing.  In this Mr. Smith is helped, and to some degree upstaged, by the island of Manhattan, which the movie’s director, Francis Lawrence, has turned into a post-apocalyptic wilderness. Three years after an epidemic has caused the evacuation and quarantine of New York City, Robert Neville (Mr. Smith) is its sole diurnal human resident, and he spends his days roaming its desolate neighborhoods, at once wary and carefree. The streetscapes he wanders through will be familiar to any visitor or resident, but the way Mr. Lawrence and his team of digital-effects artists have distressed and depopulated New York is downright uncanny. Weeds poke up through the streets, which are piled with abandoned cars, and a slow, visible process of decay has set in.  A nightmare, of course, but not without its enchantments. In some ways Neville, dwelling in a highly developed urban space that is also a wilderness, experiences the best of both worlds. From his home base in the elegant Washington Square town house he was lucky enough to own (on a government employee’s salary) before the big die-off, he makes daylight forays that are like an adventure-tourist fantasy. He does a little deer hunting on Park Avenue and some indoor fishing at the Temple of Dendur, picks fresh corn in Central Park and smacks golf balls across the Hudson from the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid.  Mr. Lawrence, who previously directed the hectic, obnoxious “Constantine” and many music videos, uses elaborate, computer-assisted means to create simple, striking effects. While “I Am Legend,” the latest in a series of film versions of a novel by Richard Matheson, fits comfortably within the conventions of the sci-fi horror genre — here come those zombies! — it mixes dread and suspense with contemplative, almost pastoral moods. And without taking itself too seriously, the movie, written by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization.  Neville, a scientist and a soldier, constitutes a civilization of one. His daily routines are at once practical — he wants to find a cure for the virus that wiped everyone else out, and he needs to be home before sundown — and spiritual. Under the streets of the city and in its empty buildings are the infected, transformed by the virus into pale, hairless, light-allergic cannibals. “Social de-evolution appears to be complete,” Neville observes as he makes notes in his basement lab. And his habits are a way not only of protecting himself from the zombies, but also of maintaining the distinction between them and him.  The zombies, like the rabid dogs that are their companions, nonetheless display rudimentary pack behavior and are even able to set traps and make plans. Once they begin swarming, “I Am Legend” inevitably loses some of its haunting originality, since they look a lot like the monsters in “28 Days Later” (and its sequel, “28 Weeks Later”). They also represent a less compelling application of computer-generated imagery than all those empty avenues and silent buildings.  And in its last section “I Am Legend” reverts to generic type, with chases and explosions and a redemptive softening of its bleak premise. The presence of the lovely Brazilian actress Alice Braga does seem promising; if she and Mr. Smith were to reboot the species together, Humanity 2.0 would be quite a bit sexier than the present version, as well as friendlier. But really the movie is best when its hero is on his own, and Mr. Smith, walking in the footsteps of Vincent Price and Charlton Heston, who played earlier versions of the Robert Neville character, outdoes both of them. There is something graceful and effortless about this performance, which not only shows what it might feel like to be the last man on earth, but also demonstrates what it is to be a movie star.  “I Am Legend” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has virus-crazed, flesh-eating zombies. 

Remarkably eerie yet annoyingly larded with cheap horror-film shock effects, �I Am Legend� stands as an effective but also irksome adaptation of Richard Matheson�s classic 1954 sci-fi novel. In what is to a considerable extent a solo turn as the last healthy human on a post-plague planet Earth, Will Smith strongly holds the screen in a one-man Alamo besieged by marauding cannibals. Potent B.O. looms worldwide.
Matheson�s pioneering novel, which worked a lot of science into a story populated by vampiric predators, hasn�t fared too well on the bigscreen thus far. First adaptation, the 1964 Vincent Price starrer �The Last Man on Earth,� lensed in Italy by helmer Sidney Salkow, was a cheesy affair, while the 1971 �The Omega Man,� toplining Charlton Heston under Boris Sagal�s direction, murkily altered the story to put the leading man up against an albino cult called �the Family.� A direct-to-vid item called �I Am Omega� (from the Asylum, specialists in parasitic low-budget versions of big-budget studio fare) has just been produced.
The scripters of �The Omega Man� get credit on this new version (curiously given the many differences between the two films), initially penned by Mark Protosevich when Warner Bros. first announced a remake a decade ago. That pic was to have toplined Arnold Schwarzenegger with Ridley Scott directing; at various points in the interim, Tom Cruise and Michael Douglas have been attached as stars, as was Michael Bay as director. Akiva Goldsman subsequently came aboard to help produce and give the script a final go.
Following a brief prologue (featuring a TV clip of an uncredited Emma Thompson as a doctor announcing a cure for cancer), the opening minutes are breathtaking in their haunting imagery. The setting is a desolate Manhattan, parts of it unchanged but others in ruins, upholstered in part by grass and weeds and with abandoned vehicles jammed together. Billboards for �Hairspray,� �Rent� and �Wicked� still adorn Times Square, but the only living beings in evidence are some flying birds, a herd of stampeding deer and a family of lions stealthily hunting its dinner.
And then there is one man, Robert Neville (Smith), first seen racing a red-and-white Shelby Mustang GT 500 through the canyons of midtown in the company of his German shepherd. Neville carries a high-powered rifle, and tries to get off a shot at a deer, but returns empty-handed to his Washington Square apartment, which appears well stocked with food and other goods.
Although he holds back from embracing the genuinely surreal, director Francis Lawrence (�Constantine�) displays a strong sensitivity to the majesty of desolation (he was reportedly inspired by John Ford�s Western landscapes). Setup also creates a genuine sense of curiosity and fear about what else might lurk out there, something shortly indicated when Neville battens down the hatches for the night and curls up with his dog in an empty bathtub while dreadful howls and screams surround them from outside.
Doled out in flashbacks are glimpses of how, three years earlier, Manhattan was quarantined due to the outbreak of a devastating man-made virus. A military scientist, Neville proved to be uniquely immune, and so remained on the island after seeing his wife and daughter off in a spectacular nocturnal evacuation scene staged with hordes of extras near the Brooklyn Bridge.
Convinced he�s the last normal man alive, Neville retains his sanity by following a rigorous routine and spends his days roving around Manhattan hunting for other survivors -- humans who, due to infection, have turned into zombie-like cannibals who normally venture out only at night. When he captures any -- a very dangerous business -- he�s able to continue his desperate experiments at finding a cure, his one hope for perpetuating recognizable human life.
Unfortunately, the more the film dwells in -- for lack of a better term -- zombie territory, the more director Lawrence resorts to stock-in-trade shock cuts designed expressly to rattle the viewer. Sometimes there�s a payoff, sometimes not, but the tenor of the picture steadily declines the more this sort of thing is indulged in.
On top of that, no matter how skillfully the CGI creatures have been rendered, they�re also tiresome (all they do is run and roar), familiar (in their hairless hideousness, they resemble Ralph Fiennes� Voldemort in the �Harry Potter� series) and implausible (their inhuman speed, strength and agility are unbelievable even in context). Bad villains bring any genre film down several notches.
Eventually, Neville encounters two more uncontaminated humans, the young Brazilian Anna (Alice Braga, �City of God�) and Ethan (Charlie Tahan), a boy she�s minding, giving rise to the hope there may be more like them out there somewhere.
Although Smith�s role may not be as difficult in certain ways as Tom Hanks� was in �Cast Away� -- Smith gets to move around a lot, indulge in eye-catching action scenes and interrelate with a wonderful dog rather than a volleyball -- they are comparable in that both parts required the actors to carry their films virtually singlehandedly, with long silent passages. Smith manages it very well, showboating only briefly to show off his newly trim physique and intermittently displaying the incipient madness that would surely come from being alone against an unrelenting threat.
Thesp�s greatest scene, which reps an inspired staging choice on the director�s part, consists of a prolonged, agonizing closeup of Neville dealing with his dog after it�s been contaminated; you�re thankful not to have to watch what he�s doing, and the powerful emotions Smith expresses are riveting to behold.
Casting of the little-known Braga, and the spectacular gravity and calm she brings to the surrounding chaos, reps another major plus, even if the immediately ensuing zombie attack returns things to a B-picture level.
What remain most memorable about the picture are the images of a stark, uninhabited New York City; to this end, production designer Naomi Shohan, the large art department and visual effects teams and lenser Andrew Lesnie contributed much imagination and expertise. Tech side is all high-end.


There are two momentous performances in the Darwinian horror fable I Am Legend . One is by the movie's star, Will Smith but more about him in a minute. The other is by the movie's visual effectsnot the ones that bring to life a nocturnal army of shrieking, carnivorous beasties (though those are by no means unimpressive), but rather the ones that render a near-future New York City that has been "ground zero" for a different kind of terror attackMother Nature's. Three years on from a pandemic in which a "miracle" cure for cancer mutates into an incurable, rabies-like plague, the isle of Manhattan has regressed into a state of frontier wilderness, and the images rendered by director Francis Lawrence , cinematographer Andrew Lesnie , and visual effects supervisor Janek Sirrs  have an awesome, iconic power. Deserted cars choke the bridges. Tree roots protrude through the surface of Seventh Avenue. And Times Square  bustles with a new sort of touristherds of wild deer stampeding through, on the run from . . . something.
That something is the Infected, human plague survivors transformed by the virus into ashen predators who have effectively laid waste to the one percent of humanity genetically immune to infection. By night, they take to the streets, unleashing their primordial howls like bats desperate to return to hell. By day, hindered by a vampiric reaction to sunlight, they roost in the shadows, temporarily ceding control of the city to the one remaining uninfected human, the scientist Robert Neville , who has lost his wife and daughter to the virus and now spends every waking hour searching for a cure. Those, roughly, are the events of Richard Matheson 's 1954 novel I Am Legend , which has been adapted for the screen twice beforefirst as the Italian-made The Last Man on Earth  (1964) with Vincent Price  in the lead, and later as The Omega Man  (1971), a piece of early-'70s psychedelia that cast Charlton Heston  as Neville and turned his adversaries into trench-coated social revolutionaries.
In Lawrence's version, which was adapted by screenwriter Mark Protosevich  (Poseidon ) and revised considerably by Oscar-winner Akiva Goldsman  (A Beautiful Mind ), Will Smith steps into Neville 's shoes, and it's the first time an actor has been asked (or allowed) to play the character as something more than God's lonely, angry man. For much of the movie, it's literally a one-man show, as Neville goes through his daily routine, tearing about the empty Manhattan streets in his strategically product-placed Mustang Shelby, raiding abandoned apartments for nonperishable supplies, and trapping the occasional Infected so as to have a new trial subject for his laboratory.
Smith is simply dazzling here, and for all the undeniably impressive work the actor has done on his physique for this role, what's most appealing about him is his active intelligencehow he thinks his way through a roleand his capacity for human weakness. Watch him, especially, in the scene where he nurses his wounded canine companion, and later, when he refuses to abandon his "post" to follow fellow disease-free survivor Anna (City of God  star Alice Braga ) to a supposed survivor's colony in (where else?) Vermont . If he just stays put in his lab, he tells her, testing one vaccine after another, he's sure he can put things right. There's a manic edge to Neville by that point, and Smith makes you feel every inch of his impotent rage. In what has been a pretty remarkable career up to now, it's this performance that fully affirms Smith as one of the great leading men of his generation.
If, as a movie, I Am Legend  is less stylistically mind-blowing and intellectually ambitious than last year's yuletide dystopia, Children of Men , it's not far off. The screenplay shrewdly condenses the pre-plague backstory to brief, staccato flashbacks and manages to shift the emphasis of the novelwhich was about how Neville came to be seen as a kind of monster by a new race of non-vampire mutantswithout diluting its power. (Here, the crux of the narrative is a timely dialectical argument between a man, Neville, who puts his faith in science, and a somewhat fanatical woman, Anna, who puts hers in Godboth of whom appear, by turns, more fanatical than righteous.) Lawrence's direction, too, is more subdued and artful than you expect to find in a high-ticket holiday blockbuster, notwithstanding a smattering of cheap shock edits and sound effects. More often, Lawrence takes things slow and easy, staging much of the film in long, dialogue-free handheld camera shots that use space, production design, and intricately layered sound effects to deliver us into Neville's desolate existence. But when the time comes for the inevitable showdowns between Neville and the Infected, Lawrence is no slouch, notably with an ingenious standoff in which a winnowing band of daylight is all that separates Neville and his pooch from almost certain doom. If I've saved mention of those scenes for last, it's only because Lawrencelike Peter Jackson  and James Cameron is among the few filmmakers with full access to the digital paintbox who seems to understand how those tools work best: to magnify the human dimension of a movie instead of extinguish it.
