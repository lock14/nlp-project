         Perched uncomfortably between flat whimsy and Lifetime movie crescendos, the coming-of-middle-age comic drama "The Private Lives of Pippa Lee" is rough going.

Writer-director Rebecca Miller, adapting her own novel about a 50-year-old people-pleasing housewife's long overdue reassessment of her life, is after the elusive charm of a highbrow chick flick. To that end, she's shrewd enough to cast melancholic beauty Robin Wright as the title character, who upon moving into a well-appointed Connecticut retirement community with her retired publisher husband (Alan Arkin) begins to reflect on the various women she's been before her current perfect-spouse persona.



         






  To watch Wright's deceptively tranquil face process a humiliating family hiccup, or Arkin explore the contours of a professional grouch, is to know what pleasurably deep acting can do. But the trouble starts when Pippa's flashbacks -- to her pill-popping manic-depressive mother (an overwrought Maria Bello), to her rebel angel teen self (an ethereally pretty if lukewarm Blake Lively), and finally to her husband's crazy first wife (Monica Bellucci, doing her own thing) -- let loose a swarm of tonal inconsistencies that Miller never fuses into anything meaningful. Pippa's crisis of guilt -- about troubled lives she couldn't fix and parts of her personality she rashly abandoned -- is ultimately swamped by Miller's own sketchy grasp of what's funny or heartbreaking or illuminating about her characters.

The kick is that she gets close enough at times with her material -- a cagey bit of casting here (Keanu Reeves as a prickly yet trustworthy neighbor), a good line there -- to at least warrant a sympathetic wince when it goes off the rails, as when she crams in an animated scene or swerves into head-scratching melodramatics (the less said about Winona Ryder's whiny character the better). Overall, though, it's a drearily off-kilter effort from a filmmaker who navigated humor and pathos well in her last feature, "The Ballad of Jack and Rose." Where Pippa has many inner selves, Miller is regrettably just all over the place.



   

If anyone can knit the unraveling title character in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee  into a recognizable woman, it's Robin Wright. Always an actor of great physical loveliness, the star, now in her 40s, has a unique talent for conveying the minute mood shifts of an adult woman wised up by her own aging. She's pleasing as ever to watch in this high-class production by writer-director Rebecca Miller (Personal Velocity ), adapted from Miller's own novel. But the rarefied dramatique  circles in which Pippa (literally) sleepwalks are such a mess of highfalutin complications that it's impossible to empathize with the sad, lost, fragile heroine. (She's much more relatable in the novel.) The mix is Lifetime soap–meets–Woody Allen smart-set comedy, with less humor and a genteel Connecticut setting.
This we know: Pippa is married to a much older man, Herb (Alan Arkin), a successful publisher who left his wife (Monica Bellucci) for Pippa when the former Pippa Sarkissian was a crazy, drug- and sex-addled filly (played, in flashback, by Gossip Girl 's Blake Lively). Now while Herb makes eyes at a new younger, crazy woman (Winona Ryder), Pippa somnambulates her way into a bond with her neighbor's emotionally trip-wired son (Keanu Reeves). The name-brand cast gives the movie buzz, but no velocity.


 Almost everybody who arrives at age 50 more or less intact carries memories of an earlier stage of life in which a wilder, unformed self lurched and blundered through young adulthood before making a fateful decision to settle. It could be a career choice or a long-term relationship, or both. For the title character of Rebecca Miller’s wry, acutely observant drama “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,” her comfortable landing is her marriage to a successful book publisher 30 years her senior, whom she describes in a candid running voice-over as her rescuer from a life adrift.  Ms. Miller’s fourth film, adapted from her novel of the same name, “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee” stars Robin Wright Penn, an actress not known for playing demure types, as Pippa, the buttoned-up wife and caretaker of Herb (Alan Arkin), a loudmouth intellectual pushing 80, who lives large and is not about to calm down, despite his frailty. Having recently moved from Manhattan to an upscale Connecticut retirement community jokingly nicknamed Wrinklesbury, the Lees find themselves at loose ends.  While Herb, who has had three heart attacks, denies old age and infirmity, Pippa, who has given him two children, both now grown, is beginning to exhibit signs of nervous exhaustion. She sleepwalks in the middle of the night, leaving the kitchen in shambles, and occasionally trances out behind the wheel of a car; she has taken to sneaking cigarettes.  The movie zigzags between the poised, middle-aged Pippa who assiduously monitors Herb’s blood pressure and concocts sumptuous dinners of butterflied lamb and perfectly crusted crème brûlée for the literati, and her memories of growing up with a histrionic, Dexedrine-addicted mother, Suky (Maria Bello). After fleeing home at 16, Pippa spent aimless druggy years hanging out on the bohemian fringe of New York. The younger, frizzy-haired Pippa is played by Blake Lively (of “Gossip Girl”), and the physical resemblance between Ms. Lively and Ms. Penn is striking.  Your first reaction to Pippa’s life in Connecticut may be to heave a sigh of relief that she made it safe and sound into sedate upper-middle-class comfort. But as scenes flash by of Pippa’s tumultuous youth, you increasingly realize that she is going through the motions of domestic bliss. When her husband’s best friend, Sam (Mike Binder), describes her as an enigma, he means it as a compliment. To Pippa it is proof that she has lost her sense of identity.  If the film fits into the dreaded category known as the dysfunctional family drama, it steers away from the weepy clichés and quasitherapeutic mumbo-jumbo that have given the genre a bad name. The movie gazes steadily and without sentimentality at upper-middle-class angst as old age and death loom, and there is suddenly too much time to fill. Its refusal to push the usual emotional buttons and its insistence that we not pass moral judgment on its characters’ erratic behavior make it an exceptionally cleareyed assessment of a stratum of American life that Ms. Miller, daughter of the playwright Arthur Miller, should know firsthand.  At the same time, it is not strictly realistic. Pippa’s childhood memories are almost cartoonlike, and the movie’s occasionally chirpy, dispassionate attitude can be off-putting. Pippa recalls the past in a detached, mild-mannered voice with a subtle edge of bitterness that seems to belie her inner turmoil. It is the voice of a sophisticate whose cynical insights camouflage internal anguish.  The film’s meticulous performances bring nearly a dozen complex characters at least to half-life. Some of the sharpest belong to Zoe Kazan as Pippa’s daughter, Grace, a headstrong photojournalist; Robin Weigert as Pippa’s kindhearted lesbian aunt Trish; and Julianne Moore as Trish’s ferocious lover Kat, who enlists Pippa to pose with another woman for sadomasochist photos. Winona Ryder as Pippa’s histrionic best friend, Sandra, and Shirley Knight as her blowzy next-door neighbor Dot, are also memorable. Keanu Reeves, his chest tattooed with a portrait of Jesus, plays Dot’s glum, compulsively honest son, a ne’er-do-well with whom Pippa develops an awkward romantic friendship.  Together Ms. Penn and Mr. Arkin create a portrait of a marriage in which you sense the intertwining crosscurrents of devotion, boredom, anger and gratitude. As the movie shows, the decision to settle is only the beginning of a new phase and can be undone. As people keep changing, stasis is the enemy. A happy ending is never guaranteed.    “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and some strong language.

Cardboard characters and severe problems of tone fatally flaw the awkward satirical relationship drama �The Private Lives of Pippa Lee.� Fourth feature from helmer-writer Rebecca Miller (�The Ballad of Jack and Rose,� �Personal Velocity,� �Angela�) feels as schizophrenic as its eponymous heroine. �Reinvented� from Miller�s own novel, this star-studded tale of a 50ish married woman coming to terms with her troubled past reps something of a pig-in-a-poke for buyers who nabbed presales rights. While watchable, it�s not exactly a commercial property or, for that matter, arthouse material, and thus reps a marketing challenge unlikely to receive critical support.
The story opens with Pippa (Robin Wright Penn, with a perpetually placid smile), hosting a dinner party with Stepford wife-like perfection at the Connecticut retirement community she�s just moved into with much older publisher hubby Herb (Alan Arkin). As guests hail her as a model spouse, her inner voice confides, �I�ve lived more than one life.�
Introduced by Pippa�s voiceover, those other lives are revealed in a wannabe picaresque style and intercut with the Lees� present-day existence in �Wrinklesbury.� We see Pippa growing up with manic, diet-pill-popping mother (Maria Bello) and running away at 16 (played by Blake Lively) to join lesbian aunt Trish (Robin Weigert) and Trish�s �dangerous� lover Kat (Julianne Moore), whose sideline taking S&M porn photos generates a chuckle.
Pippa�s memories of the past and the guilt she feels, particularly over an incident involving Herb�s wacko second wife (Monica Bellucci), start to create a �quiet nervous breakdown� in which she acts out repressed urges in her sleep. Luckily, she finds a confidante of sorts in her neighbor�s son Chris (Keanu Reeves).
While the film marks a change of pace from the intense seriousness of Miller�s earlier work, she never finds the dark comic edge that would make �Pippa� more satisfying viewing. Indeed, she never sustains any tone at all. The dialogue teeters from flat comedy to wince-worthy whimsy, with detours through blithe and earnest. Visual style, too, is all over the place.
Although Pippa declares, �I�ve had enough of being an enigma, I want to be known,� she�s not developed enough for viewers to really care. Likewise, the supporting characters are paper-thin. Of the actors, only Bello and Moore offer a suggestion of the over-the-top thesping the story seems to call for. Reeves (who offered phenomenal character work in �Thumbsucker�) hasn�t got much to do here other than look good with a big tattoo of Jesus on his chest.
Tech package seems a tad constricted. Lenser Declan Quinn and production designer Michael Shaw suggest the story�s multiple time periods, the camera drifting from one set to the next. Period music does a better job of evoking the era than the laughable costumes, hair and makeup. 


Rebecca Miller 's fourth feature may be the only film you'll ever see with both Cornel West  and Monica Bellucci  in minor roles. But it is also immediately recognizable as the millionth iteration of a sheltered, middle-aged suburban housewife who has a slight crack-up and decides she better get her ya-yas out.
A film about private lives may be impossible for a writer-director whose own life is part of the public record—the traces of which show up frequently in her movies. The daughter of Arthur, Miller's work often includes domineering dads: The "Greta" segment from 2002's Personal Velocity  (based on Miller's short-story collection of the same name) finds Parker Posey 's Harvard Law  burnout desperate to impress her prominent defense-lawyer father; the teenage daughter in 2005's The Ballad of Jack & Rose  is completely besotted with her eco-warrior pop, played by Miller's husband, Daniel Day Lewis —the two live essentially as husband and wife. The central relationship of The Private Lives of Pippa Lee   is the inverse of Jack & Rose 's quasi-incestuous bond: Devoted homemaker Pippa (Robin Wright Penn ), approaching 50, is married to publishing powerhouse Herb (Alan Arkin ), a man 30 years her senior who becomes a surrogate daddy.
But before finding papa, Pippa must escape the soul-sucking vortex of banshee mommy. Opening with a dinner party at Pippa and Herb's new home in Connecticut (Miller was reared in Roxbury ), where the couple moved after Herb's third heart attack, Pippa, serving butterflied lamb, is hailed as "the very icon of an artist's wife." The patronizing praise prompts Wright Penn 's voiceover—"I've had enough of being an enigma. I want to be known"—and flashbacks to a 1960s childhood, the first of several that interrupt the main narrative of adult Pippa's slow unraveling. Mother Suky (Maria Bello ) is hopped up on black beauties, her raging mood swings pushing teenage Pippa (Blake Lively ) out of the Constitution State suburbs and into the Manhattan lesbian lair of an aunt (Robin Weigert ) and her girlfriend (Julianne Moore ), who demands Pippa pose for her B&D tableaux. Pippa ditches those deranged dykes, soon finding safety on a Long Island  beach, where she meets Herb (Arkin in ridiculous hair plugs), breaks up his marriage (to Bellucci), weds ("I gave myself over to him like a penitent"), gives birth, and waits on everyone hand and foot.
So far, so Feminine Mystique . Middle-aged Pippa—in between pottery class, taking her husband's blood pressure, being rudely dismissed by her war-photographer daughter (Zoe Kazan ), buying fish for dinner, and lunching with a friend (Winona Ryder ) who will betray her—wonders if she's "having a very quiet nervous breakdown." She commits sleep crimes, somnambulistically devouring the contents of the fridge and driving in her nightie to the convenience store, where Chris (Keanu Reeves ) works. A wayward son with the Son of God tattooed on his chest, he becomes Pippa's personal Jesus.
In this densely populated ensemble piece, Reeves stands out as the only actor whose damaged character evokes sympathy and avoids cliché. Pippa, played by Wright Penn in near-permanent Stepford Wife mode, isn't much more than a vehicle for false epiphanies and forced rapprochements—a plastic protagonist with all the nuances of any given character found in the midday-programming slot of WE TV. The small-screen feel of Pippa Lee  is partly the result of Declan Quinn 's camerawork, which flattens and dulls (much different from the intimate shooting of Ellen Kuras , the cinematographer for Miller's first three films). Though she's to be understood as a 21st-century heroine, Pippa ends up making a new-lease-on-life decision very similar to that of Betty Draper  in Mad Men  's third-season finale. Yet this concluding entry in Miller's diary of a mad housewife is supposed to make us root for Pippa, a woman with a new fella but with no friends and no apparent job skills—without much of a life at all.
