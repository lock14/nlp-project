Filmmaker Aaron Russo and a swelling movement of angry Americans make the case in this documentary that there is no law on the books that requires Americans to pay income taxes. Although Russo�s film is grounded in Libertarian theory, the producer-turned-filmmaker presents some very provocative information in the film�s first half, which argues that there is no legal basis for the payment of income taxes. He looks at the origins of the 16th Amendment and concludes, as many other tax resistors have over the years, that the amendment was never legally ratified by the states before its implementation in 1913. Russo speaks with former Internal Revenue Service workers who�ve grown disenchanted with the agency�s inability to cough up a specific statute to support their endeavors and also speaks with various experts, authors, and average citizens. Russo spars with former IRS Commissioner Sheldon S. Cohen, who tries to explain what is meant by �voluntary compliance� and the meaning of various Supreme Court rulings that he finds inapplicable to the IRS. Yet the majority of Russo�s speakers are supporters of his cause � a cause that this former music promoter; former Bette Midler manager, producer of the films The Rose
 and Trading Places
 and failed candidate in the Nevada governor�s race is championing with this self-produced film. His efforts have been rewarded with a genuine grassroots campaign of viewer support, and in one of the odder examples of politics making strange bedfellows America: From Freedom to Fascism
 is being distributed by Cinema Libre � the independent company that has also released such left-identified fare as Uncovered: The War on Iraq
, WMD: Weapons of Mass Deception
, The Future of Food
, and Tim Robbins� Embedded Live
. In between his experts� testimonies, Russo also highlights several cases of resistors� legal battles with the IRS that cast the agency as a bully that relies on intimidation and fear to get what it wants. However, just as the film�s arguments start growing persuasive, Russo (who also narrates the movie) undermines his work by freefalling into a tangled web of all-out conspiracy-mongering. The Federal Reserve is taken to task for being the work of a rich cabal of banking interests. The decline of the gold standard and the secrecy and lack of auditing of Fort Knox are also seen as conspiratorial. Next, the film segues into the evils of the USA PATRIOT Act, electronic voting machines, national ID cards, and the new world order. It concludes with an impassioned plea for civil disobedience, but not before allowing Texas congressman Ron Paul to have the last word. (The Libertarian-turned-Republican Paul, a central Texas representative and physician, is known in the House as Dr. No for his consistent voting against anything not required by the Constitution.) Though the technical credits and music used in America: From Freedom to Fascism
 are a bit substandard for a theatrical release, it�s good to see that passionate cinematic rabble-rousing does not rest solely in the hands of the left.

"To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men," once wrote statesman Edmund Burke, and multi-hyphenate Aaron Russo is clearly one very displeased guy judging by "Aaron Russo's America From Freedom to Fascism." Libertarian-positioned docu argues almost persuasively that U.S. citizens are not legally required to pay federal income tax, and much less convincingly that country is becoming a police state via new identity laws. Pic should nevertheless stir interest when released domestically by indie distribs Cinema Libre, which has handled such similar dissenting, grassroots-marketed polemics as "Outfoxed" and "Embedded."
Eclectic resume of pic's writer-helmer-producer-narrator-presenter Russo includes manufacturing underwear, managing Bette Midler in her early years, producing boffo comedy "Trading Places," running for president on the Libertarian ticket in 2004,� and making a melange of standup comedy and speechifying in "Aaron Russo's Mad as Hell," which was self-distributed on video.
With his warm Brooklyn accent and affectedly folksy manner, Russo has a genial-cum-pugnacious presence onscreen and a knack for boiling down complex arguments and issues into easily digestible, "Global Economics for Dummies" sound bites.
Cornerstone contention in "Freedom to Fascism" is that the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was never properly ratified, an argument popularized in Bill Benson's controversial book "The Law That Never Was," that's cited here. �Along with the foundation of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913, introduction of federal tax system is described by Bob Schulz of the We the People Foundation, as the "greatest hoax ever perpetrated by government against the working men and women of America."
To support this point, Russo deploys interviews with former IRS agents who have joined pressure groups to fight imposition of federal tax. Other means of cinematic persuasion include cartoons, solemnly presented quotes from various illustrious (Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Goethe no less) and (in pic's view) notorious figures (banker David Rockefeller). All this is backed by ominous music, and quick inserts from popular movies to underscore points humorously. This is redolent of campaign advertising, but less convincing as journalism.One doesn't have to be a pro-Federalist to feel Russo's tendency to use shot-reverse-shots in interviews with those opposed to his view -- such as gamely participating former Tax Commissioner Sheldon Cohen --creates the impression that rhetorical sleight of hand is being used to undermine counter-argument.
However, the strong case built in pic's first half is weakened by the vaguely argued contention in the second that the land of the free is becoming anything but. Attack focuses on the Federal Reserve, the Patriot Act, the abolition of the gold standard, and not-yet-ratified plans to introduce identity chips on currency and in citizens in the future.
Film ends with rabble-rousing call to Americans to rise up through civil disobedience, refuse to vote for politicians not calling for the abolition of the Federal Reserve, resist imposition of ID cards, abolish computer voting, and don't believe the media. In short, vote Libertarian. Tech package is on a par with low-budget TV docs.

It's a little disingenuous for filmmaker Aaron Russo  to pose as just an uninformed individual trying to uncover the "truth" about the IRS  in this new documentaryhe doesn't tell you that he ran in the Libertarian Party's presidential primary in 2004, and his mind was made up a long time ago. Nonetheless, his arguments about the constitutionality of the federal income tax deserve a serious point-by-point response from someone in the know. Even though Russo seems to be arguing a technicality the Sixteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to tax income, but no law since has explicitly laid out how they should do itthe government ought to answer better than they have. Unfortunately, that's not the whole movie. From the tax debate, the documentary suddenly gets scattershot, going after the Patriot Act , laws against vitamin sales, election fraud, and Hurricane Katrina  response (apparently a plot to grab people's guns), building to the standard New World Order line, which discredits any valid points Russo may have.
