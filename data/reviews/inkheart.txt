Consider the written word and its myriad powers: to educate; inspire; open doorways within the human mind that, often, forever alter the life of the reader; and, of course, entertain. German author Cornelia Funke's Inkheart
, a fantasy adventure in the vein of Neil Gaiman's Stardust
 or C.S. Lewis' Narnia
 books, has been translated into 27 languages and found a comfy home in the young-adult section of libraries the world over. I haven't read it yet, but after watching Softley's rollicking, overstuffed, but enormously entertaining adaptation, it's now at the top of my list. Both the book and film revolve around a family of humans � "Silvertongues" in the parlance of the film � who unknowingly have the power to bring to life the characters in the books they read aloud. This brings inadvertent disaster to the Folchart family when antiquarian book doctor Mo (Fraser) reads the titular novel Inkheart
 to his wife, Resa (Guillory), and baby daughter, Meggie (Bennett). For every character that is read into our world, a human being is sucked into the world of the book, and thus Resa vanishes, replaced by the grinningly evil Capricorn (Peter Jackson mainstay Serkis) and his thuggish, illiterate minions � among them Basta (Foreman, of Layer Cake
), as well as a selfish but potentially heroic fire juggler by the name of Dustfinger (Bettany). Thus begins a quest by the remaining Folcharts to locate another copy of Inkheart
 in the hope that they will be able to read Resa out of it and back into reality while simultaneously dispatching the villains. Along the way, Helen Mirren, a unicorn, L. Frank Baum's flying monkeys, and a minotaur arrive, vying for viewer attention; the ever-regal Mirren bests them all, which will come as no surprise to fans. Softley, who previously helmed the semicult hit Hackers
 back in the day and has since been known primarily for his music-video work, does an admirable job imbuing the world of Inkheart
 with just the right amount of fantastic detail, right down to Capricorn's Escher-esque castle. Director of photography Roger Pratt makes the most of the sumptuous locations. Inkheart
 was shot in and around Liguria on the Italian Riviera, and it looks absolutely ravishing. But the most resonant and, frankly, wonderful aspect of the film is its unabashed love for books and the wonders to be found within. Sequences of Capricorn's mishapen toadies (they were read into unfinished life by a stutterer) as they set fire to the Folchart's beloved library of first editions elicit a true pang of horror and are mirrored by the protagonists' unlabored love of the written word. Inkheart
's core message � that reading and writing books are noble pursuits and, indeed, sacred duties � may seem obvious to adults but is, let's face it, growing ever less so to post-millennial youth. There's nothing as fine in this world as the musty scent of an old book, well read and cherished, and Inkheart
 knows this to be true and tries, in its fantastic way, to pass that love along to future readers, writers, and lovers of the well-told tale.


As the hero of "Inkheart," Brendan Fraser possesses what, in the movies lately, passes for a superpower: He can read. And when he does so aloud, the details and characters of any story can come to life.
"Inkheart" presents that gift as a curse. Fraser's character, Mo Folchart, a bookbinder, spends the film trying to find a rare copy of a fantasy that shares its title with the movie's. It seems that when his teenage daughter, Maggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), was a baby, Mo read the book's villains off its pages and read his wife onto them. He also read its protagonist, Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), out too. Dustfinger hounds Mo to read him back to his fictional world. Mo, meanwhile, just wants a reunion with his wife.
Andy Serkis, who so memorably lent his voice and likeness to Gollum, in the "Rings" movies, is more human here, sniveling through his part as the movie's chief baddie. Never mind that he is dressed like a starlet's bodyguard. He's having a good time. So is Jim Broadbent as the book's author. It takes him, his beret, and his giant pink scarf far too long to start sashaying through the dreary sets and narrative mud.
Broadbent and Mirren are the only actors who appear to appreciate the shabbiness of the shenanigans afoot. The rest of the cast is saddled with bad clothes, useless flashbacks (some of which have Bettany's actual wife, Jennifer Connelly, mewling across time, "Come home"), and worse wigs. The only exciting set piece is from the effects department, and it's a giant charcoal cloud that appears during the film's climax and requires Maggie to do public reading (alas, she's inherited her father's gift).
That sequence takes forever to get off the ground and longer to end. Like many other scenes in "Inkheart," which the playwright David Lindsay-Abaire adapted from Cornelia Funke's novel, it draws the most evocative images from other material, namely L. Frank Baum's "The Wizard of Oz." Toto and the twister make pivotal cameos. So does a copy of Jean Giraudoux's "The Madwoman of Chaillot," which the filmmakers use as a pun that goes nowhere.
How disappointing that a movie about the powers of literacy has been made by people who appear to be cinematically illiterate. Most scenes sit on the screen like bullfrogs waiting for something to happen. (Fittingly enough, when something does, it's usually a belch.) The director Iain Softley once made a ravishing, underappreciated version of Henry James's "The Wings of the Dove." He couldn't be farther from the beauty, heat, and perception of that film.
"Inkheart" illustrates an obvious problem with making a movie about the joys of reading when the movie made is labored and sludgy looking: Why bother seeing it if you can stay home and read a book instead?


Watching Iain Softley's motley, jewel-toned adaptation of Inkheart , the best-selling 2003 young-adult novel by Cornelia Funke, I had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again, falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible. In Funke's universe  given voice in a screenplay by fantasy-friendly playwright David Lindsay-Abaire—a literature lover named Mo (Brendan Fraser) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud. The downside? When a fictional figure comes alive, a real person must disappear into the book's pages.
That explains the extended absence of Mo's wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory). Mo has not yet told the truth about Resa's disappearance to their intrepid young daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their  children for dramatic effect. (Maybe Fraser's Mo, a pleasantly square-framed American among a population of Brits, just can't bring himself to utter the word ''Mummy.'') It also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers. These include a soulful fire juggler (Paul Bettany) who yearns for home (and why not, when real-life wife Jennifer Connelly appears briefly as the juggler's fairy-tale missus), and an acquisitive villain named Capricorn (Andy Serkis, always welcome even without his Gollum suit). A unicorn and The Wizard of Oz 's flying monkeys also make appearances  as does, briefly, Toto too.
The story is a whirl, a jumble, an effusion  sometimes flowing smoothly, other times jerking along as if the filmmaker (Backbeat , The Wings of the Dove ) has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger. There are close calls, weird whispers, amusing throwaway lines, the ditherings of a distractible author (Jim Broadbent), and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary-comic evil henchmen. But most deliciously madcap of all, there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of Helen Mirren as Meggie's flesh-and-blood great-aunt Elinor, a creature of pencil-thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon. Mirren's all-out display in this distinctly British absurdo-literary extravaganza had me wishing Elinor were my own fabulous auntie and that she'd lend me some magic items from her closet.

 “Inkheart,” a muddled film adaptation of a children’s best seller by Cornelia Funke, celebrates the magic of books, but it  can also be taken as a cautionary tale. One of its main bibliophiles, Mortimer Folchart (Brendan Fraser), known as Mo, possesses the marvelous power to animate the written word. When he reads aloud, the story literally comes alive, as characters and objects pop (or rather tremble) from the page into the real world. Impressive magic, to be sure, but it costs poor Mo  his wife (Sienna Guillory) and forces him to give up reading bedtime stories to his young daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett).  Mo is what’s known in the densely populated, thinly imagined world of  “Inkheart” as a silvertongue, and the film, anchored as it is in the juvenile fantasy genre, refrains from exploring some interesting implications of his unusual ability. Is it limited to children’s literature? Does it apply equally to cookbooks, erotica and the daily newspaper?  A briefly glimpsed copy of  “Anna Karenina” put me in mind of  “The Kugelmass Episode,”  the immortal Woody Allen sketch in which the title character pursues an affair, across fictional Yonville and actual Manhattan, with Emma Bovary. But while “Inkheart” alludes to a few classic works like “Little Red Riding Hood,” “The Wizard of Oz” and “Huckleberry Finn,” it is mainly concerned with characters who escape from a novel called “Inkheart.”  That book’s author, Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent), complains that it has gone out of print and all but vanished into obscurity, and frankly it’s not hard to see why. Though its full plot remains elusive, the “Inkheart” within “Inkheart” seems like a hodgepodge of ersatz medievalism dressed up with dreary magic.  One villain has escaped from the book, a fellow named Capricorn (Andy Serkis), who occupies himself in the modern, nonfictional world by playing Mussolini in a picturesque Italian hill town, surrounded by minions who have also crawled out of Fenoglio’s pages. There is also a fire juggler named Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), who is eventually outfitted with two sidekicks, one a ferret and the other a minor character from “The Arabian Nights.”  The movie “Inkheart,” directed by Iain Softley (“K-PAX,” “The Wings of the Dove”) from a script by David Lindsay-Abaire, aims for a blend of whimsy and tingly suspense but botches nearly every spell it tries to cast. Its opening scenes are more confusing than intriguing, and the acceleration of the plot leads to a sense of busyness rather than suspense. A movie that can produce the image of Helen Mirren astride a unicorn has some claim on the audience’s interest, and a movie that can make that image seem perfectly uninteresting is in some serious trouble.  Ms. Mirren plays Mo’s wealthy, reclusive, bibliomaniacal aunt, and she is hardly the only member of the cast who seems stranded in the film’s hectic, fussy, unconvincing world. Mr. Bettany, alternately seething and sulking, shows some of the same earnest, misplaced intensity he displayed in “The Da Vinci Code,” a film that makes only slightly less sense than this one.  Curiously, Mr. Bettany’s real-life wife, Jennifer Connelly, appears in his character’s dreams, beseeching him to come home. Of course she means come home to “Inkheart,” the book from which poor Dustfinger has been exiled. But given the story’s deliberate blending of the fantastic and the literal, she might also have meant come home from “Inkheart,” a movie that squanders far too much of its magic.  “Inkheart” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some scenes of fairy tale peril and fantasy violence.

Books are essential; movies based on books, not so much -- this is the lesson imparted by "Inkheart," a brisk, overstuffed adaptation of Cornelia Funke's international bestseller. Despite abundant talent on both sides of the camera and a bevy of eye-catching supernatural beasties, this f/x-heavy story of a literature-loving father and daughter battling dark forces unleashed from the pages of a rare tome doesn't conjure much in the way of bigscreen magic. Delayed nearly a year by New Line, the now-Warner Bros. release opens Jan. 23 Stateside following its Dec. 11 bow in Europe, where commercial prospects look strongest.
Published to great success in 2003 in Germany, where the prolific Funke has been likened to J.K. Rowling, "Inkheart" is the first installment of a fantasy trilogy concerning the adventures of bookbinder Mortimer "Mo" Folchart (played in the film by Brendan Fraser) and his 12-year-old daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), a voracious reader. As revealed in the film's prologue, Mo is a Silvertongue, a person with the rare ability to bring the characters in a book to life simply by reading the text aloud.
Meggie initially knows nothing of her dad's extraordinary gift. But when a trip to an antique bookshop in Italy leads to a fateful run-in with Dustfinger (Paul Bettany, longhaired and unkempt), a self-proclaimed "fire-juggler," the truth emerges in flashback: Years earlier, when Meggie was a wee girl, Mo cracked open a novel (titled, incidentally, "Inkheart") and not only brought Dustfinger and other fictional characters out of it but also accidentally banished Meggie's mother into it. Mo vowed never to use his gift again ("I don't read aloud anymore," Fraser says with a straight face) and has since searched tirelessly for his wife, seeking a copy of the elusive novel into which she disappeared.
Back in the present, father and daughter flee to the posh estate of Meggie's prim great-aunt, Elinor (Helen Mirren, carping at everyone in sight). But there's no escaping Dustfinger -- or, even worse, the megalomaniacal Capricorn (Andy Serkis, ghoulish and bald), another refugee who wants to exploit the Silvertongue's talent and bring forth more evil into the human world.
That's an awful lot of fantastical mythology for a 105-minute movie, and one of the film's major flaws is that the characters seem to accept the rules much more quickly than the viewer will. Working from a busy, tightly compressed script by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (his second screenplay, after "Robots"), director Iain Softley seems more interested in ushering his characters from point A to point B (as they dash breathlessly around a scenic Italian Riviera where, curiously, no one speaks Italian) than in fostering emotional engagement and that all-important sense of wonder.
Considering how impressively the helmer molded a much denser piece of literature, Henry James' "The Wings of the Dove," into his elegant and passionate 1997 film adaptation, it's disappointing that "Inkheart" has no feel -- and, it seems, no time -- for the lingering, resonant detail. Not every fantasy film needs to be "The Lord of the Rings," but the involvement of New Line and the presence of Serkis, Peter Jackson's main muse, can't help but drive home the comparison.
Cheeky visual references to classic children's books -- the flying monkeys from "The Wizard of Oz" and the ticking croc from "Peter Pan" are among the creatures shown here -- keep the pic sporadically engaging and underscore its reverential attitude toward literature. Visually, the film is impressively crafted in all respects, with lush widescreen views of coastal Italy and splendid palatial interiors by set designer-decorator Niamh Coulter and production designer John Beard.
The sole American in a cast of mostly British thesps, Fraser doesn't vary his game much, essentially reacting to elaborate special effects as he did in "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and "The Mummy" movies. Bennett is spirited and watchable as a girl who must ultimately draw on her own imaginative power to save the day, and Jim Broadbent is in reliable fuddy-duddy form as Fenoglio, the author of the novel within the novel.
If there are any further cinematic adventures of Mo and Meggie, the filmmakers will have some serious explaining to do, given how tidily "Inkheart" dispels the questions and cliffhangers left unresolved at the end of the novel. It's a perfunctory wrap-up to a film that, unlike its assorted characters and critters, never manages to break free of the page.

Brendan "Kids' Choice" Fraser returns to the multiplex day-care as Mo Folchart, antiquarian-book-repairman-cum-adventurer and member of a race of "Silvertongues"—those who, when they read aloud, can suck people out of and into the texts they're reciting from. Mo has abstained from practicing his gift ever since, when reading some limited-press-run sub–Terry Brooks fantasy, the titular Inkheart , his wife was slurped off into limbo just as a motley assortment of the book's roughs popped off the page. All of this is retrospectively revealed to Mo's daughter when Inkheart 's villains catch up with Dad as he's scouring obscure booksellers looking for a copy of The Book so he can reverse the switch. The Capo of the baddies, Capricorn (Andy Serkis ), doesn't want to go back into bindery and so orders copies of Inkheart  put out of print by a private army of book-burning brigands operating from a castle whose dungeon holds a menagerie of literary beasties that include L. Frank Baum  flying monkeys and a J.M. Barrie  ticking croc. It all smacks of that overdone "passion for literature" common in English teachers who send any healthy-minded kid running from books. Bibliophile characters exclaim: "What in the name of Chaucer's beard?", "For the love of Thomas Hardy !", and "Great galloping Knut Hamsuns !" (I made just one of those up.) Fraser intones, "The written word: It's a powerful thing," as though sitting for his "Reading Is FUNdamental" poster.
