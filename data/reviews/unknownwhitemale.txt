In theory, Unknown White Male  ought to be a fascinating movie. It's a documentary about Doug Bruce, who on the morning of July 3, 2003, found himself on a subway to Coney Island, unable to remember...anything. Diagnosed with retrograde amnesia, he becomes, in effect, a true-life counterpart to the Guy Pearce character in Memento . Except that Unknown White Male  isn't a thriller (in any sense). Bruce, in a matter of weeks, learns the basic facts of who he was  or still is: a 33-year-old British expatriate who made a fortune as a stockbroker and lives in an East Village loft. He meets his old buddies and girlfriends and watches home videos of himself  but none of this rings the faintest bell of recognition in the newly blank space that is his mind. Unknown White Male is framed as a look at the mystery of identity, but there's a bizarre neutrality to the movie, since it makes Bruce's life just as detached and remote to us as it seems to him. Everything under the sun  chocolate mousse, the Rolling Stones  is new to his senses, yet the filmmaker, Rupert Murray, who knew Bruce before the amnesia struck, probes his pal's predicament without ever piercing the membrane of his unnerving experience.

 What would it be like if one day you discovered that you didn't remember anything  —  not your name, the mother who died, the friends who didn't, your lover's caress or the wet kiss of a snowflake on your cheek? Such is the premise of the thought-stirring documentary "Unknown White Male," which recounts the bizarre saga of an East Village loft dweller, Doug Bruce, who in July 2003 walked into a Coney Island hospital claiming not to know who he was, thereupon becoming either a heart-wrenching casualty of a medical anomaly or the prime suspect in a mystery yet to be solved.  That story, worthy of Oliver Sacks, is here told by one of the amnesiac's old friends, Rupert Murray. As he explains in voice-over, Mr. Murray befriended Mr. Bruce some 15  years earlier when the two were living in London  and, to judge by their up-dos in some battered home movies, under the spell of  the band  A Flock of Seagulls. The friendship survived both new-wave follies and Mr. Bruce's move to New York, where he worked as a stockbroker, a lucrative career he left in 1999 to take up photography. Around the same time, Mr. Murray was directing documentaries for Britain's Channel 4 (which commissioned  "Unknown White Male"), making him the right man at the right place.  Or so it would seem. Mr. Murray ticks off a raft of disparate influences for his film, including Man Ray, Andrei Tarkovsky and Luis Buñuel. It's a nice list, but the filmmaker would have done well to mix more documentaries in with his art-house  fare.  Crammed with friendly, sympathetic talking heads and pretty images of a stunned-looking Mr. Bruce, then 35, relearning life (he remembers how to walk but forgot   family and friends), the film comes up frustratingly short when it comes to the particulars. We meet the psychiatrist  who did the intake at the Coney Island hospital, for instance, and the doctor who checks a worrisome tumor, which may or may not have something to do with his memory loss. But conspicuously missing are any firsthand diagnostic discussions.  It's a puzzle why Mr. Murray doesn't include at least one doctor who has treated his friend expressly for his affliction (maybe he forgot), especially given that the ubiquity of amnesia as a narrative device and cultural metaphor makes amateur diagnosticians of us all. In Aki Kaurismaki's deadpan comedy "The Man Without a Past," the fictional title character embarks on a new life after a beating wipes clean his memories. That film opened in New York two months before Mr. Bruce popped up in Coney Island wearing flip-flops and carrying no identification. Like Mr. Kaurismaki's hero, the wanderer became a man not only without a past, but also without a self; from the image of the self-satisfied young man we see in the battered home movies, that may not be such a bad thing.  Documentaries without obvious grinding axes are usually taken at face value, but since its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, "Unknown White Male" has received an unusual amount of scrutiny. A few news articles have questioned Mr. Bruce's honesty, suggesting that the film is the latest in mockumentary high jinks. The current  www.gq.com features a Q & A with Mr. Bruce in which the interviewer wonders why the film doesn't include the factoid that he owns property in Panama. Mr. Bruce's wealth isn't interesting per se, but this is the sort of detail that a better filmmaker or perhaps one less personally invested might have used to ask the obvious: Is Mr. Bruce a bored rich guy whose interest in art resulted in a devilishly clever conceptual prank?  Maybe it doesn't matter. Would "Unknown White Male" be better, more watchable and less philosophically resonant if it turned out to be a hoax? I doubt it. The film isn't a document of historical evidence like "Shoah" or a journalistic inquiry in the manner of "The Thin Blue Line"; this is just one man's freaky saga, the kind that gets you to thinking about how our lives are built from wisps of memory and markers of memory like photographs. In this sense, whether Mr. Bruce is telling the truth (for what it's worth, I think he is) or has created a con as baroque as that of JT Leroy is less important than the story itself. Put another way, as Oscar Wilde wrote, "Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of art."  "Unknown White Male" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There are some salty words.
Imagine you have awoken to find yourself riding the F train toward Coney Island , bizarrely underdressed and without any idea where you are going or who you are. Amnesia, per the Psychiatric Dictionary , is the most often faked mental anomalythe plot device that powered countless film noirs and soap operas, as well as recent American foreign policy and Rupert Murray 's haunting if sketchy doc Unknown White Male .
Hopefully hyped as the real-life correlative to Memento  or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Unknown White Male  recounts the story of that mysterious subway passenger. Processed by cops, brought to a terrifying hospital ER, and identified by the luck of a stray phone number in his pocket, he turns out to be one Doug Bruce , a British-born stockbroker with a Noho loft. The information doesn't bring back Bruce's memory, but it does establish the movie's jet-set ambience. His former girlfriend returns from Poland  to nurse him; later, he flies to Spain to meet his family for the "first time"; after that, he visits London, city of his birth yet terra incognita, where with a notable absence of enthusiasm, he encounters old mates. The filmmaker is one such forgotten crony, suitably baffled by Bruce's transformation: "The more we talked, the less I recognized the person in front of me."
What is personality? the movie wonders. Is it a factor of essence or experience? Free to redefine himself through his actions, Bruce seems a new personmuch nicer, to judge from old home videos of his earlier lads-abroad vacation trips. In fact, he's almost a baby. Like proud parents we can vicariously enjoy his first taste of chocolate mousse and initial dip in the ocean. Everything is wowas if, the filmmaker notes, Bruce's "senses had been sharpened by a rebooting of the system." The mind-altered excitement is accentuated by the tripped-out quality of Murray's fragmented, rough-hewn style.
To call this story unbelievable is to say the very least. If it's a hoax, Bruce is a fantastic actor (but then, the movie suggests, so are we all). If not, you may wonder less about Bruce's personality than his condition. No convincing medical or psychological explanation is ever given; Bruce is a walking metaphor, even a miracle. This "unknown white male" has been granted a second chance, born again into a state of grace.
By the time Bruce meets a new woman in London and falls in love, he has begun to worry that his memory might return. The movie ends happily, without telling us if it ever has. "Blessed are the forgetful," as the receptionist quoted Nietzsche  in Eternal  Sunshine , "for they get the better even of their blunders. . . . Found it in my Bartlett 's ."
