         Back when I was in college, one of my professors delivered a lecture on gender roles as they are defined and reenforced by the media. He summarized the plot of "Fatal Attraction," recasting the main roles with people of the opposite sex. Oh, how we laughed as he described the lonely, desperate single man, who upon finding out that his married lover was pregnant with his child, went berserk in his pursuit of her, desperate to be involved in the parenting of the child.
 
 Of course, that was in the '80s, when stuff like that was still funny. Camp histrionics notwithstanding, "Fatal Attraction" made perfect sense to us as it was at the time. The marriage panic, brought to us by Newsweek, was in full bloom, so being Glenn Close was the freakiest thing any educated, middle-class girl could imagine.
 


         






   The new panic, brought to us by everybody, all the time (though Oprah gave it a good PR push in 2002, with her show on the infertility "epidemic" among women over 35), concerns what follows sitting in the tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.
 
 Four years later, we're in the throes of yet another campaign to get educated working women (the other kind don't count) out of the workplace and into the mommy-and-me yoga class. It's probably only a coincidence that we live in the industrialized country with the poorest track record of helping women work and have babies at the same time.
 
 I couldn't help thinking about this as I watched "Loverboy," Kevin Bacon's curious but engaging directorial debut, based on a novel by Victoria Redel, which struck me as a "Fatal Attraction" for our time. Not to put the movies on the same level — Bacon's film is funny, wry, dark and infinitely subtler than Adrian Lyne's campy fright-fest. But if you squint, you can see the line connecting them.
 
 Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's wife, plays a woman whose sole purpose in life is to have a child. So she explains in her voice-over, an extended love letter to her son, Paul (Dominic Scott Kay).
 
 The story is told episodically, in shuffled chronological order. Emily's (Sedgwick) life with Paul is intercut with flashbacks of young Emily's life with her parents, played by Marisa Tomei and Bacon with comic brio.
 
  Emily is a dour kid, the only child of cheerfully self-obsessed '70s caricatures so deeply in love with each other they have absolutely no time for her. Her only friend is Mrs. Harker (Sandra Bullock, in a tiny but well-realized role), the best mom in the neighborhood, in Emily's estimation, and certainly the only one who walks her sons to the bus every morning.
 
 Emily grows up wanting to right her childhood by having her own kid and lavishing him with attention. She pursues her purpose single-mindedly and quite amusingly, first via mailorder insemination and, when that fails, by embarking on a one-night-stand spree with every genetically gifted stranger she encounters. "I was like the great jewelers of the Byzantine searching through stacks of stones," she tells Paul in voice-over. When she finally gets pregnant, her life begins. She buys a house in a nice neighborhood in upstate New York and devotes herself exclusively to Paul's upbringing and to keeping all interlopers — basically, anybody that comes near them — at bay.
 
 Sedgwick, with her wild blond hair and her black-hole eyes, is excellently creepy as a woman luxuriating in her own foamy madness. (You can't really call it a descent since Emily seems to have been born there.) At one point, she stuns the principal and teacher at Paul's school — where he has insisted on going despite her preference for home-schooling — by responding to the principal's friendly suggestion that she join a group of mothers who might help out if she ever needs a break with an icy "I'm not looking. For a break. From my child."
 
 The cast of "Loverboy" is uniformly excellent, with powerhouse actors taking even the smallest roles. Oliver Platt plays a secretary in the principal's office, who gets to know Emily well as she constantly yanks Paul out of school to go on picnics. Matt Dillon plays a graduate student who briefly befriends Paul at the beach house Emily rents in a desperate attempt to get away from concerned neighbors. And Campbell Scott plays Paul's father — a married salesman with whom Emily has a passionate one-night stand at a convention. The title refers to the humiliating nickname Emily bestows on her son, despite his protestations. And it's entirely appropriate to her character. When Paul rejects her romantic plans á deux, 
she peers at him, her tiny dark eyes moist under her mop of blond curls, a wounded lover who looks for all the world like she's staring at Michael Douglas. (There are no bunnies in "Loverboy." Emily's beef is with a little wounded bird that Paul has grown attached to.)
 
 "Loverboy" is a grim little story, but it's leavened unexpectedly with humor and energy. A stylish and thoughtful director, Bacon marries music to image beautifully. The film was scored by Bacon's brother, Michael, who created temp tracks of the score in progress to enable Bacon to cut to the actual music.
 
 As for some of the songs used in the film, Bacon created iPod playlists for each of his actors, so that certain songs — David Bowie's "Life on Mars" for Mrs. Harker, for example — become their anthems. The result is that sound and image seem exceptionally well integrated, as though locked in a dreamy dance.

Kyra Sedgwick, who looks like a tragedy mask even when she smiles, has the kind of sensuality that has gone out of fashion in the movies (though not, apparently, on television, where she has finally found success). Her been-around-the-block sexiness is laced with neurotic anger; those beautifully squinty, crying-jag features turn desire into pain, and vice versa. Loverboy , which Sedgwick's husband, Kevin Bacon, directed, gives her a showcase role as Emily, an aspiring single mother of terrifying obsessive zeal who raises an eager, trusting, shaggy-haired 6-year-old named Paul (Dominic Scott Kay), whom she nicknames ''Loverboy,'' believing he's hers in every way: her child, her partner, her other self. There's no room in the world for anyone but them.
As long as they're painting happy purple handprints on the wall, you give her behavior a pass. But any doubts as to whether this ''unconventional'' mother is mildly nuts are laid to rest the moment that she confronts one of her rivals for the kid's  affection  a baby bird  by smashing it with a rock. Loverboy , adapted from a novel by Victoria Redel, portrays a parental fixation so suffocating that it's a borderline form of child abuse, yet perhaps the only way to make a movie like this one work is to invite us inside the mania the way Bill Forsyth did in Housekeeping  (1987), where he highlighted the cracked compassion, as well as the dysfunctional flakiness, of his hippie-before-her-time heroine.
Bacon, in his first outing as a feature director, displays no such subtlety. As an actor, he has often had a funny, percussive edge, and he instinctively pushes Loverboy  toward surreal domestic satire. It's fascinating to watch Sedgwick try to make Emily into a luminous wack job, but the punched-up staging (neighbors doing arch double takes at her shenanigans, etc.) trivializes the character, as do the stylized flashbacks in which Bacon, in Hunter S. Thompson regalia, and Marisa Tomei play Emily's own neglectful parents as wigged-out '70s cartoons. Meanwhile, young Paul emerges as a lonely yet magically stable boy. I never really bought Loverboy , and unconvincing delusional cruelty is not what you would call a memorable night out.

 "Loverboy," a cautionary mother-child drama, starts out warm and fuzzy, then stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering.  The movie, the shaky second feature directed by Kevin Bacon, is an artistic valentine to his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who stars as Emily Stoll, a single mother whose possessive instinct runs amok. Its juicy list of reputable actors in small roles includes Blair Brown, Matt Dillon, Oliver Platt, Campbell Scott, Marisa Tomei, Melissa Errico and Sandra Bullock.  This small, earnest film might be taken as a companion piece to "The Woodsman," the 2004 movie directed by Nicole Kassell in which Ms. Sedgwick's character, Vicki, was another headstrong woman who takes a huge risk by entering into a relationship with a convicted pedophile (Mr. Bacon). If Ms. Sedgwick's performance in "Loverboy" is even sharper, the movie, whose tone wobbles between lyricism and farce, is much less sure-footed.  Hannah Shakespeare's screenplay, adapted from a novel by Victoria Redel, frantically bounces between the present and the early 1970's, when Emily was the glum, spoiled daughter of lovebirds so wrapped up in each other that she felt like a lonely bystander. Ms. Tomei and Mr. Bacon (disguised behind a mustache and large pink aviator glasses and grinning from ear to ear) play the loony parents, Sybil and Marty, as cheesily dressed old-time Las Vegas-style fools in love. Ms. Bullock periodically materializes in dreamy soft focus as the sympathetic next-door neighbor the young Emily wished had been her mother.  If the comic episodes have no stylistic connection to the rest of the film, a scene, in which 10-year-old Emily (Sosie Bacon) embarrasses her parents at a school talent show by singing a weird a cappella rendition of David Bowie's "Life on Mars?," is grotesquely funny.  The adult Emily, who narrates the story, readily admits to arrogance. And, in retrospect, her coldblooded quest for no-strings-attached single motherhood is an ominous sign. With her inherited money, she tours the country, engaging in a succession of zipless one-night stands with men she uses and discards without a second thought. But Emily is so articulate and sure of herself that your initial impulse is to suspend doubt and applaud her nervy independence.  Eventually (after a miscarriage), Emily becomes pregnant and has a beautiful baby she names Paul, after his father (Mr. Scott), who is never contacted. She vows to give her little darling all the love she never got. In the first symptom of her deepening instability, she freaks out when her baby suckles at another woman's breast.  The story leaps ahead several years to observe the idyll she shares with Paul (Dominic Scott Kay), whom she calls Loverboy. They sleep together in a tent strung with flowers in the backyard. During an off-season jaunt to the New England coast, Emily can hardly bear it when Mark (Mr. Dillon), a geologist who lives nearby, takes a fatherly interest in Paul.  If there is something irresistibly touching in the sight of an attractive mother in love with her perfect child, vicarious delight gives way to exasperation and eventually to alarm as Emily home schools her son and possessively prevents him from making friends his own age. When she reluctantly allows him to attend public school, she becomes pathologically suspicious of his teacher. Long after he has demanded she stop, she insists on calling him Loverboy.  Almost until the end, "Loverboy" maintains a shaky integrity. But in its final moments it caves in to convention with a mawkish epilogue to a story that ends with an appalling act of selfishness.  The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations.

A classic case of "Better if you didn't read the book" cinema, "Loverboy" emerges an OK character study of an abnormally possessive mother. But Kevin Bacon's second feature as director (1996's "Losing Chase" also starred his wife Kyra Sedgwick) reps a considerable betrayal of the source material's tone and impact. Too many visual gimmicks and a cast overburdened with big names in small roles soften Victoria Redel's acclaimed debut novel. Where one might have imagined a film translation as stark and close to psychological horror as Todd Haynes' "Safe," "Loverboy" plays more like an offbeat Lifetime made-for. Prospects are modest.
At once striking a broadly comic tenor that couldn't be further from Redel's coiled, ambiguous narrative, pic introduces protag/narrator Emily Stoll (Sedgwick) as a 30-ish single woman of independent means, no profession, and no interest in establishing a conventional home or relationships. All she wants is a child. To that end, first reel has her roaming the nation shagging one anonymous (but genetically promising) dude after another. This results in a miscarriage, however, and she despairs until a one-night-stand with a conventioneer (Campbell Scott) has the desired effect.
"My equation was: Many men equals no father," she informs us. Thus Emily, informing no one of her whereabouts (least of all the sperm donor), buys a house in Yonkers and settles down to being a determinedly single mother.
Hannah Shakespeare's script then fast-forwards to 6-year-old Paul (Dominic Scott Kay) developing an independent streak -- which mom views as a full-blown crisis. Home-schooled in bizarre, haphazard fashion by an overeducated mother with no grasp of age-appropriate teaching, tired of ma's make-believe games and status as self-appointed sole playmate, the boy questions why he can't mingle with other neighborhood kids. Or go to regular school.
Emily's reaction is an abrupt "vacation" trip to a remote, off-season coastal cottage where their exclusive society-of-two can again be established. But even here there are nosy, overfriendly neighbors, with whom Paul gets along dismayingly well -- especially geologist/fisherman Mark (Matt Dillon), who clearly wouldn't mind completing the "family" as husband and father.
Feeling she's losing control of Paul, Emily decides to take him home so he can attend first grade at a normal school. Despite prior social isolation, he does surprisingly well, which panics mom further, as she can't bear her "genius" son to become "just" a normal kid.
Flash-forwards interspersed throughout find mother and child in a car in their closed garage -- an apparent play activity that grows sinister as film progresses. Whatever cumulative punch this scene possesses, however, is smoothed over by a sentimental epilogue that's 180 degrees from Redel's chilling final notes.
Told exclusively in protag's voice, the novel stayed just a few intriguing degrees short of psycho-mom-from-hell pulp territory, instead letting readers very gradually -- and just partially -- grasp the mental illness behind Emily's obsessive guardianship. Film keeps that first-person tack in superficial terms, but renders the psychological landscape in blunt strokes that often turn traumatic incidents (e.g. little Emily's talent-show mortification, or her freakout when another woman breast-feeds infant Paul) into broad, even slapstick comedy.
Flashbacks to her neglected childhood feature Marisa Tomei and Bacon himself as Emily's parents -- caricatured, self-involved '70s swinger types. Sandra Bullock appears as a neighborhood lady Emily fantasizes as her ideal mom. Former bits are set to cheesy disco-era radio hits, while latter incongruously showcase Jimi Hendrix tracks. Indeed, soundtrack is intrusive throughout.
Likewise the visual aspects, which Bacon and lenser Nancy Schreiber needlessly clutter with interludes of soft-focus, slo-mo, skewed angles and distorted lenses. If all this means to illustrate that Emily lives in a dream world, it backfires -- her hyper-controlling nature is at odds with a flashy presentation that's all over the map.
Sedgwick is well cast, though in this watered-down interpretation, the character is not as challenging as she was in the book. Young Kay is adequate albeit close to conventional precocious-movie-kid cuteness. (Helmer and star's own child Sosie Bacon plays the young Emily.)
Support cast is fine, although frankly it's more distracting than helpful to have their ranks filled with familiar faces like Blair Brown, Oliver Platt and Melissa Errico, many only given a scene or two.
Tech aspects are smooth.

In his big-screen directorial debut, Kevin Bacon  gleefully flaunts wife Kyra Sedgwick 's naked body for all to envy, in what initially plays as a deranged sex comedy about a woman so desperate to be pregnant that she maximizes the odds at every opportunity. Once that's achieved, Bacon the director indulges his wife, letting her play crazy and emotional in a showy performance that screams "serious actress." The film focuses on single-mom Emily (Sedgwick), whose parents were such narcissistic, nymphomaniac pricks that she's determined to be the opposite, and becomes a selfless mother to the point of derangementculminating in an incident that's perhaps a wee bit over-the-top. Bacon himself appears in flashback as Emily's father, and the couple's real-life daughter plays young Emily, who, in the movie's best scene, belts out an impressive a cappella rendition of David Bowie 's "Life on Mars."
