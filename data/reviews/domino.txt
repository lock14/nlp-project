Attention-deficit filmmaking reaches a new pinnacle in Domino
, Tony Scott�s heavily fictionalized account of the life of bounty hunter Domino Harvey, the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey. Scott manipulates his imagery with so many jumpy edits, color-enhanced (especially green) film stocks, and jagged compositions that the film story becomes captive to its own hyperkineticism. Viewers (both inured and addicted to the sensory bombardment) gradually grow less concerned with what happens in Domino
 than in how it looks, and, to paraphrase McLuhan, the look eventually becomes the message � which is really not such a bad thing when you have foxy Knightley posing as such an iconically irresistible bad thing. Let�s forget about pesky questions like how Knightley�s Domino can see well enough to aim her shotgun straight with all those bangs wisping over her eyes, or how hardly a scene goes by without a cigarette dangling between Domino�s full lips or slender fingers while absolutely no mention is ever made of the real Domino�s illegal drug habits (no small aspect of her life, we may assume, since she died of a drug overdose just this past summer). Scott, the director of a long list of testosterone-fueled pictures (Top Gun
, Days of Thunder
, Crimson Tide
) is clearly interested with this film in the idea of a fearless female badass, a woman who was named bounty hunter of the year by her trade association in 2003 and can hold her own with any man. Knightley rises to the occasion and makes for an appealing fetish object. But what the film (with a script by Donnie Darko
�s writer-director Richard Kelly) neglects is the creation of a character. In the story of Harvey there resides an evolutionary tale about a child of privilege who turns her back on those opportunities and can only get a rise from guns, danger, and other thrill-seeking behaviors. It�s also a story about a girl who, though endowed with the beauty to become a Ford model, rejects that life and adopts a more androgynous appearance, complete with shaved head Harvey�s libido toward her two male cohorts instead of the more nonheterosexual slant the real woman�s taste reputedly leaned toward. Some of these elements are present here in small doses, but the film really cares little about what makes this character tick. Not when we can see her kick in doors, punch in a sorority sister�s face, or perform a strategic lap dance for an East L.A. thug. Domino�s tough-as-nails demeanor might make a better sale if her softer side weren�t portrayed with the corny recurring motif of a child�s dead goldfish. Most of Domino�s story is related in flashback, as she unravels the sequence of events in a complicated caper gone terribly wrong. The fine cast offers a who�s who of indelible performances (most original are the turns by Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering as themselves in a reality show based on the bounty hunters), and despite the visual commotion Scott is a quite able (and bloody violent) director of action. But by the time Tom Waits shows up spouting twisted gospel quotations during a desert mescaline episode, there�s nowhere for this movie to head but downhill. The reality-show producer played by Walken is described by his assistant (Suvari) as having the attention span of a "ferret on speed." I�m sure he would love Domino
.


We'll have to wait for the November release of ''Pride & Prejudice" to see Keira Knightley as a vision of grace. In the meantime, here she is as a foul-mouthed bounty hunter in Tony Scott's ''Domino." She swings nunchucks, bloodies noses, blackens eyes, totes a gun, and performs a lap dance. Knightley is at the start of her career, and perhaps someday she'll look back on Scott's latest scuzzy opus with fond memories of how she spent her paycheck, since her integrity as a performer is utterly beside the point here.
We know what the movie expects from her during the opening titles sequence, when the alphabetized dominoes with the cast's names and photos tumble forward. Hers is just a gawking shot of her cleavage. Sigh.
Domino Harvey was the real-life English daughter of Laurence Harvey, the late star of the original ''Manchurian Candidate" and an absentee father. In the movie, her frosty, gold-digging mother (Jacqueline Bisset) moves Domino to Los Angeles, where the girl proves to be an expert saboteur. Having ruined runway shows during her stint as a fashion model and beaten up sorority sisters in her brief time as a pledge, she prefers grit to beauty, and attends a bounty-hunting seminar. There she meets Ed (Mickey Rourke) and Choco (Edgar Ramirez) -- actually, she stops them from stealing the registrants' fees, then befriends them.
Steve Barancik, who wrote ''The Last Seduction," and Richard Kelly, the writer and director of ''Donnie Darko," are credited with the ''Domino" screenplay, but since so much of what's wrong with the movie appears to have happened in the cutting room (it's edited for junkies), who knows what they intended? The film is sliced and diced every which way. It's told as a collection of flashbacks that Domino sets in motion during one of those after-the-fact police interrogation sequences. Her inquisitor, played by Lucy Liu, wants to know about the elaborate heist whose reach extends to Domino, mobsters, the feds, and Dabney Coleman.
With a different screenplay and a much different director, this movie could been a gonzo frolic, like ''Natural Born Killers" only less insane. But Scott has never had Oliver Stone's critical eye or his psychotic humor. His most unforgivable trait as a director is not that he makes degrading, cartoonishly macho pictures. It's that he's serious about them. Quentin Tarantino has mastered the sort of movie Scott is attempting here: a kitschy circus.
Amid the bounty-hunter raids and the heist plot, there appears to be a whiff of satire in ''Domino" involving a reality television show that trails Domino, Ed, and Choco. It's produced by a nebbish, played by Christopher Walken, and hosted by two former stars of ''Beverly Hills 90210," as themselves. It's toothless. ''Domino" also pays a condescending visit to ''The Jerry Springer Show," where the comedian Mo'Nique gives an uproarious presentation on mixed-race people.
Tarantino could get away with this: He likes us, and he likes movies. Scott is a cynic with bad taste in style. At times, the dialogue leaps out of characters' mouths and literally appears on the screen. And the movie has a distressed, oversaturated look, as if Scott were making designer jeans instead of a film.
No one is looking to him for decorum. But his pornographic lust for bloodletting, gunplay, and out-of-control camerawork far exceeds his abilities to tell a story. He's been churning out barrel-chested productions for decades, but there used to be something to grasp beneath the greasy surfaces of his movies. They were entertainments about men in tough situations: ''Top Gun," ''Beverly Hills Cop II," ''Days of Thunder," ''The Last Boy Scout," ''True Romance," ''Crimson Tide," ''The Fan," and ''Enemy of the State." But his last film, ''Man on Fire," with Denzel Washington on a rampage, crossed a line into senseless brutality, which continues with this new overproduced outing.
''Domino" is about a woman whom Scott wants to act like a man, but without sacrificing the arousing qualities one might desire in a pretty young lady. The movie has no interest in her psychologically. It's worth noting that the actual Domino Harvey, who died in June of a drug overdose, was an androgynous creature, not a beautiful chick with a punky haircut.
Alas, the only character for us to relate to in ''Domino" is the lucky goldfish that is flushed down a toilet. Sadly, we don't go with it. We're left floating around the bowl for another hour.


         Consumer alert: The people who made "Domino" actually created a flow chart and put it on the front cover of their scripts to enable them to keep track of what the press material delicately calls the film's "many characters and their interwoven relationships." No plans have been announced to hand out that chart at a theater near you, and that's a shame.
 
  A fantasy based ever so loosely on the real-life character of the late Domino Harvey, "Domino" is so over-plotted that it's borderline incomprehensible. Absent that flow chart, figuring out exactly what is happening in this film is a real challenge for much of the time.
 


         






    Of course, if you care about things like logic and coherence, you probably shouldn't be watching "Domino" in the first place. Its director, the flamboyant Tony Scott, says, "This movie is about heightened reality," which means it's a chance for him to blow things up, employ a lot of stunt people and fool around with a variety of film stocks and processing techniques.
 
  This lack of deep-dish seriousness is probably news to screenwriter Richard Kelly, who previously wrote and directed the very different "Donnie Darko." Those informative press notes claim he sees the film as having allegorical elements relating to America's poor overall healthcare system. Who knew?
 
  What "Domino" is really about is the opportunity to make use of one of the hot young things of the moment, British actress Keira Knightley, in a role that allows her to wear racy clothes, brandish shotguns, give a lap dance and say naughty things in a terribly posh accent. Comments about America's poor overall healthcare system were apparently not called for.
 
  The real Domino was a friend of Scott's, who was fascinated that the daughter of celebrated British actor Laurence Harvey wanted to work as an L.A. bounty hunter. Scott has tried to make a film around Domino's persona for about a dozen years, but when a brief window opened in Knightley's schedule, the film became a go. Ah, the joys of having a bankable star.
 
  Working with Knightley is a frankly unnerving range of performers. Any film that finds places for Mickey Rourke, Delroy Lindo, Mo'Nique, Mena Suvari, Macy Gray, Jacqueline Bisset, Dabney Coleman, Lucy Liu and Christopher Walken has got some serious explaining to do.
 
  "Domino" opens with a framing device of the title character in criminal custody and being interviewed by Liu's FBI psychologist about a recent armored car heist that netted $10 million. What did she know and when did she know it? Answering those questions results in two flashback strands: how Domino became a bounty hunter and what happened to all that money.
 
  The first strand is by far the easier to follow, though not necessarily particularly edifying. The death of Domino's celebrated father when she was very young, although apparently not related to America's poor overall healthcare system, was quite a blow. But this is the kind of film that insists that it was the unexpected death of a beloved pet goldfish that changed her life and put her irreversibly on the bounty hunter path.
 
  Domino gets the attention of L.A.'s top bounty professional, Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke), and his partner Choco (buff Venezuelan Edgar Ramirez) by throwing a knife through their car's windshield. Suitably impressed, the guys take her on because she will add class to their act.
 
  Liking the work because it allows her to "live the nasty and not do time for it," Domino prospers and soon comes to view her partners as family and drinks in the wisdom of Ed, a man who's "been places, done things, lived life." Sample Ed wisdom: "We all get weak over women" and "Love is a battlefield, baby." 'Nuff said!
 
  Working for bail bondsman Claremont Williams III (Delroy Lindo), the team gets enmeshed in that armored car job, which involves so many extraneous elements — from a grandchild who needs an operation to the California DMV to Jerry Springer, Las Vegas
 hotel owners, Mafia children, reality TV, psychedelic drugs, "Beverly Hills, 90210," bandits in Halloween masks and a guy who gets his arm shot off — that it's a wonder that flow chart made it comprehensible. And don't even ask about an allegorical character named Wanderer played by Tom Waits. No, I'm not making this up.
 
  It's a welcome and unexpected dash of reality to see a clip of the real Domino Harvey at the film's conclusion. A much more complicated figure than "Domino" has any intention of portraying, she died in June at age 35 with serious federal drug charges pending against her. Given her wild and crazy streak, she might have loved what Tony Scott has put together, but it's not clear who else will.

Poor little rich babe, scion of English movie-star royalty, AK-47-toting punkette bounty hunter: If Domino Harvey's life didn't already sound like a chicly garish girl-with-model-cheekbones-goes-slumming thriller, then a girl-with-model-cheekbones-goes-slumming thriller would have to be made to exploit it. And now one has. Domino , directed by Tony Scott, is a movie that wears its ultraviolence and fashionista grunge, its Oliver Stone-makes-a-Harley-Davidson-commercial visuals, and its fake-nervy aggression like a very ugly but expensive tattoo. The movie is trash shot to look like art imitating trash. It's the tale of a real person in only the most abstract, opportunistic way, since what Scott has done is to pin the scandal label of ''true story'' onto his most fractiously vapid action film since Beverly Hills Cop II .
Designed as a blitzkrieg of fast, shuddery images saturated with glary fluorescent color (accent on the nausea green), like something out of the latest music vid that's too mod for the dorm, Domino  is a movie that's fatally hip and lethally numb. It features a synthetic update of Tarantino-flavored violence (a man's arm, branded with a safe combination, gets ripped from his torso); a plot so dense with ersatz Elmore Leonard convolutions that it manages to stay three steps ahead of the audience and four steps behind common sense; and a saintly hellion of a heroine  a kamikaze to the glamour born, played by Keira Knightley with no emotion but an unvaried runway-model pout of bad attitude.
A framing device has tough agent Lucy Liu interrogating the captured Domino, who recalls the story, with far too much tedious narration, of how she became a Los Angeles bounty hunter and got wrapped up in a $10 million payoff. For reasons that are never remotely explained, Domino, the daughter of stage and screen legend Laurence Harvey (we see a brief clip of him in the 1962 The Manchurian Candidate ), rebels against her role as prep-school princess by addicting herself to danger. She connects with a band of hired reprobates and finds an alternate father figure in Ed, played by Mickey Rourke, who even in this late-wreckage career phase lends an undertone of sweet softness to his beefy street-zombie posturing. Domino proves her mettle by standing up, with no experience, to a roomful of criminals in a scene so far-fetched, it establishes the film's utter nose-thumbing view of plausibility. Yet since Domino  is aimed at a generation hungry for a quick fix of empowerment fantasy, the scene's hyperbole is the whole point. This, the movie says, is the you of your dreams: the Suicide Girl as glam sociopath.
Now that ''cool'' has become an official corporate concept, used to sell everything from jeans to hair gel, it's worth asking: Is a movie that works as hard to be badass as Domino  does a contradiction in terms? As a packaged sensory onslaught of girl-gunslinger nihilism, Scott's film would seem to have everything, yet taken simply as entertainment, it is dreadful: less cool than ice-cold, its violence too dissociated to inspire a decadent tremor of excitement. They should have called it Natural Born Ciphers .

 It is tough to pinpoint the precise moment when "Domino," an action-movie pastiche from Tony Scott, a modern maestro of the cinema of big bang, ceases being just another guns-and-poses divertissement and becomes a lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills. A tongue-in-check, elbow-in-ribs interpolation of the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey, the film has to its great credit absolutely no social value outside of a feverish will to entertain, though that might prove tricky, since its assaultive wild style seems designed to repulse as well as attract.  Civilized movie types may well find "Domino" repellent if not reprehensible, but then, what are those types doing at a Tony Scott movie? As the auteur of such cultural touchstones as "The Hunger" and "The Last Boy Scout," Mr. Scott has always been more popular with general audiences than with serious, or at least serious-minded, critics. Received critical wisdom seems to have it that while he has made, if almost by accident, an occasional good flick, his work presents little of real interest or value. Never mind the badly kept secret that Mr. Scott's films are generally entertaining as hell  and that some of us would rather watch the unrepentantly lowbrow "Top Gun" for the seventh or eighth time than slog through the usual middlebrow folderol.  Written by Richard Kelly, the diabolically clever boy wonder behind "Donnie Darko,"  "Domino" unfolds like a fairy tale, one conceived along the consciously exploitative lines of Aaron Spelling rather than the Brothers Grimm. Like the 1970's television show "Charlie's Angels," Mr. Spelling's famous contribution to jiggle and bad hair, "Domino" hinges on the outlandish image of a gorgeous woman engaged in some of the most brutishly macho work conceivable, which in this case means delivering, for a fee and with shotgun at the ready, suspected criminals to law enforcement. Roger Corman built an empire of sorts on similarly outlandish imagery, as have Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita") and Joss Whedon ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer"). Mr. Scott is a late but welcome addition to this strange sorority by proxy.  Mr. Scott and Mr. Kelly spin their improbable story of Domino Harvey through the familiar frame of an interrogation. Arrested for reasons that emerge as the story unwinds, Domino (Keira Knightley) sits in a cramped room opposite an F.B.I. agent (Lucy Liu) whose questions take the story back to once upon a time when she lived with her jet-setting mother (the model Pauline Stone, here called Sophie and played by Jacqueline Bisset), and her father, the movie actor Laurence Harvey. Most famous for his role as the tragic villain in the original version of "The Manchurian Candidate," Harvey died when Domino was a toddler, an event that may have had everything, something or nothing to do with his daughter's gradual immersion into a life of reckless danger.  At first, though, it's all fun and guns. Deploying a whirlwind of skewed-angled, slamming cuts, saturated colors, and slowed and accelerated motion, Mr. Scott takes us on a speedy, jittery tour through this A-list dropout's early years - a stint on the catwalk, a catfight in college - then drops us into the rough-and-tumble netherworld of bounty hunting, Cali style. Along with the picturesquely scuzzy Ed (Mickey Rourke) and Choco (Edgar Ramirez), Domino cruises Los Angeles's mean palm-lined streets, looking for and generally finding trouble. In one of her first tours of duty, the three end up in the middle of what looks like most of the city's notorious 18th Street gang. Faced with all those shaved heads and pistols, our quick-witted heroine does what any bounty hunter would do: she offers the gang leader a lap dance.  It gets weirder, deliriously so. Having relinquished any claims on verisimilitude from the get-go ("This is based on a true story ... sort of"), Mr. Kelly cuts loose with all manner of pop-surrealist goofiness and Mr. Scott happily follows suit. The nuttiest development involves the producer of a reality show who hopes to turn the bounty hunters into the WB network's newest stars. The producer is played by (of course) Christopher Walken; the fictional hosts, in turn, are two alums of "Beverly Hills 90210" who are actually played by two alums of that show, the cheerfully game Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering. Afghanistan, Las Vegas, Dabney Coleman, Macy Gray, Tom Waits, Delroy Lindo and a fabulous Mo'Nique also figure into the mix, but never mind how or why.  How all these pieces do and do not add up is part of the delight of "Domino," as is watching a film tear wildly, at times heedlessly, from one illogical setup to the next, then slam on the brakes to teeter on the brink of self-parody before taking the full-on plunge. Like Domino, who will on occasion wave her gun around with little regard for her  or anyone else's safety, Mr. Scott wields his camera here with an even greater disregard for storytelling niceties than he usually evinces. His filmmaking is always fast and loud, alternately intensely ugly and strangely beautiful to behold, while the stories he tells often fall into the alpha and omega extremes of the modern action movie: the smart-enough pop thriller ("Enemy of the State") and big-budget studio exploitation ("Man on Fire").  What makes "Domino" the ultimate Tony Scott movie - or as a friend put it, "It's all the Tony Scott you could possibly want in a Tony Scott movie!" - is its uncharacteristically sharp screenplay. Mr. Scott has worked with talented writers before, but this is the first time he has shot a film written by a screenwriter who both cops to the great enjoyment that can be had from the modern action movie - perhaps best illustrated here by the sight of Ms. Knightley unloading two machine guns at once - and blows the action-movie tropes to smithereens.  The real Domino Harvey, who died at 35 in June from a heart attack with a toxic level of painkiller  in her system, lived her life  as if she were a character in a Tony Scott movie. That  life was stranger than fiction, but perhaps not so strange as this.  "Domino" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is a lot of gun violence and a scene in which someone's arm is forcibly removed from his body, but relatively little gore.

Why would the owners of Las Vegas' Stratosphere want to see their high-rise landmark blown up onscreen? That such an event climaxes this helter-skelter biopic, however fictionalized, is merely the most unsettling of the numerous dislocations evident in "Domino," Tony Scott's aggressively grungy look at the life of the late femme bounty hunter Domino Harvey. Subject's novelty value and Keira Knightley in her first bad-ass role will provide some draw, but pic is satisfying neither as character study nor as straight-ahead actioner. Result is a between-the-cracks entertainment that might accrue a limited devoted fan base but appears destined for middling biz overall.
A friend of Harvey's for the last 15 years of her life (she died in June of an apparent overdose, after the film was completed), Scott never intended to make a straightforward account of her eventful, troubled life. Choice of Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko") as screenwriter further guaranteed an unconventional approach, one that deliberately jumbles the narrative, possibly mixes reality and fantasy and, as is Scott's wont, decisively favors surface effect over depth or coherence.
The elementary psycho-emotional dynamic is apparent. Brief snippets of "The Manchurian Candidate" reference the father whom Domino scarcely knew, '60s Brit film star Laurence Harvey, and when mom, gorgeous Sophie Wynn (Jacqueline Bisset), packs her off to boarding school, the girl has something tangible to rebel against.
And rebel she does, for the rest of her life -- against the privilege that was her birthright, coasting along on her great looks. The hook of an elegant, posh-accented hottie choosing to become a bounty hunter working Los Angeles' most sinister 'hoods gives "Domino" automatic fascination, and in Scott's view the prime motivation (for his heroine and his film) is the adrenaline rush, the daily opportunity to walk on the wild side, as the title of one of Domino's father's more famous films put it.
But this is not, as it turns out, enough. As relentlessly as the director pushes Domino beyond the fringes of civilized society into an uncharted zone of heavily armed anarchy, he is paradoxically prudish when it comes to her personal behavior. Knightley serves up a character who is permanently angry and confrontational, a seething woman who's got something gnawing at her insides she can't ever make go away.
One has to imagine, however, that someone so untamed and presumably unstable would supplement the occasional bashing down of doors or gunpoint standoffs with the more conventional outlets of sex and substance indulgence, illicit or otherwise. There's scarcely an indication of either, however, making Domino mysterious and unknowable to the audience in some of the wrong ways.
Not that she lacks for provocative professional technique. After answering an employment ad for top bail-bondsman Claremont Williams (Delroy Lindo), Domino goes on her first job with old pro/father figure Ed Mosbey (Mickey Rourke) and simmering Venezuelan Choco (Edgar Ramirez) into the lair of a nasty Hispanic gang. In the director's signature sequence here, Domino thwarts what looks like an inevitable shootout by offering a lap dance to a big-gutted homeboy.
After this sort of display, it can only be one short step to showbiz, which is where the team, which also periodically includes Afghani explosives expert Alf (Rizwan Abbasi), soon lands. When Domino is named 2003's bounty hunter of the year, Hollywood comes calling in the form of producer Mark Heiss (Christopher Walken), who casts the team in a reality show, "The Bounty Squad," hosted by Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green of "Beverly Hills, 90210."
With this sought-after recognition, however, comes a downward slide, as the group becomes involved in a complicated and unsavory scheme involving Williams; his girlfriend Lateesha (the engaging live-wire Mo'Nique), who deals fake IDs from her job at the Dept. of Motor Vehicles; latter's granddaughter, who urgently needs an expensive operation; a determined FBI investigator (Lucy Liu); and criminals ranging from desert scum to Vegas kingpins.
Considerably less prepossessing than her real-life counterpart, Knightley at times seems in slightly over her head, a girl trying to do a (tough) woman's job. But she's also game and fun to watch getting down and dirty.
Rourke provides a few looks that suggest his rugged ex-con has more on his mind than just mentoring his new team member, while smoldering newcomer Ramirez stifles his character's desire for Domino for so long it's a wonder he doesn't explode. Tom Waits has a very strange cameo as a bedraggled preacher in the desert.
Scott, who can make films as slick as they come, goes the opposite way this time, using a grab-bag of extreme techniques that gives the picture a look as rough as its milieu. Often dousing scenes in a putrid shade of green and seemingly deliberately obscuring actors' eyes, Scott and lenser Dan Mindel create a collage effect by mixing formats, film stocks, levels of saturation, abrupt camera moves and anything else they can think of that might be perceived as edgy. Mostly, however, it's downright ugly, with color combos suggesting high toxicity quotients.
Self-consciously trendy style, bizarre scenario, larky storytelling attitude and the lively cast combine to insure there's always something popping onscreen; "Domino" is far from dull. But it doesn't convince. Despite Scott's determination not to be weighted down by biographical truth, pic's conclusion feels muddled without it; vaguely upbeat thrust of the piece is that Domino found a role for herself that suited her -- early on, she says, "My agenda is to kick ass," and kick ass she did -- but final photo of the real Domino evokes levels of sorrow and irresolution rigorously avoided by the film.

Domino  only wants to give you everything. Freeze-frames, blurred or stuttering slo-mo, fast-forwards, filters, strobe flickers, 360-degree pans (of mescaline sex), Keira Knightley 's pelvic cleavage. A jump cut splits apart a single facial expression. The movie's framing device seems to be shot through the glass of a forgotten fish tank. Things happen, like Tom Waits  alighting upon the overexposed desert, then they un-happen, as when a firing squad's bullets zip back into their respective rifles. Very loosely based on the life of poor little rich girl Domino Harvey , the bounty hunting daughter of actor Laurence, the movie begins in the "ass end of the Nevada  desert" on a trailer ambush. The prey is an ample, mutt-faced mama who just happens to be watching The Manchurian Candidate  on TV when Domino and her burly associates show up and fling her son's arm into the kitchen. Just another day at the office for the director of Man on Fire .
As played by Knightley, Domino is a bratty tomboy, a tough-talking chick whose clenched jaw, sour expression, and spherical vowels nonetheless suggest that a meadow vole has taken up residence under her extremely English tongue. Sad Domino mourns her dead goldfish and her dead dad, in that order, and whiles away her adolescence sulking by the pool with her nunchakus before finding a surrogate father and life-affirming vocation in "legendary bounty hunter" Ed (Mickey Rourke ). The script, allegedly by Donnie Darko  's Richard Kelly , throws together tangentially related plots like cats in a sack: DMV  mistress Lateesha (Mo'Nique Imes-Jackson ) is running a fake-license scheme, a TV exec (Christopher Walken ) casts Domino in a reality show hosted by some Beverly Hills, 90210   vets, there's lots of shooting and some terrorism, etc. (The real Domino Harvey was found dead of an apparent overdose earlier this year; two bond industry colleagues served as "technical advisers" to the film.)
With the sloppy-sentimental repentance usually associated with the tail end of a drug binge, the movie decides late in the going that it's all about the childrenLateesha's sick grandchild and some happy Afghan kids frolicking in money, to be specific. In this respect, Domino  is abusively moronic enough to inspire something like pity. The movie staggers toward you like a jabbering tweak freak, reeking of chemical sweat, a feral blankness in his beady eyes. He corners you with jumbled stories of wild times and severed limbs and this one time in Nevada and, affronted that your attentions flag, throws a sucker punch about his sick kid in the hospital. You listen and you feel yourself getting stupider.
