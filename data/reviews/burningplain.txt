Early on in “The Burning Plain,’’ Charlize Theron tells a friend that she has a new beau. “Do I know him?’’ the friend asks  - then quickly adds, “Do you
?’’ It’s a great line, indicating everything we need to know about how unmoored Theron’s character is.
“The Burning Plain,’’ in substance if not style, updates the classic weepies Bette Davis specialized in during her heyday. It has adultery, teen love, not one but two highly charged mother-daughter relationships, and a heroine (Theron) who really
 
has problems with emotional commitment. There’s also a crime of passion, on which all three of the film’s story lines hinge, but the passion is even more familial in nature than sexual. To go into the plot in any detail would reveal several crucial twists.
It’s a story with all the makings of sumptuous, Sirkian melodrama. Instead, writer-director Guillermo Arriaga (best known as the writer of “21 Grams’’ and “Babel’’) makes the movie into an exercise in writerly technique. He plays off dry, brown New Mexico, where Theron’s character lived when young, against her present home, damp, gray Oregon. And he shuffles those multiple story lines with the intentness, if not dexterity, of a three-card monte dealer. The result is a movie that’s emotionally flat and technically tricky.
Theron is good, but ever since “Monster’’ she’s been on a Serious Actress Addressing Serious Issues kick that’s begun to seem like automatic pilot. Unvaried solemnifying can be as harmful to a career as unvaried frivolity. Get this woman the lead in a stylish, grown-up comedy (assuming that Hollywood ever makes another one)! A reunion with Woody Allen might be in order (assuming he’s still capable of making a stylish, grown-up comedy).
Kim Basinger, as Theron’s mother, is surprisingly affecting. The peculiar resemblance she now bears to Diane Lane reminds us that the indiscriminating removal of wrinkles is not necessarily a good thing. Jennifer Lawrence plays Theron’s character as a teenager. It’s a thankless task. A person can change a lot in 14 years. But there’s no way a person can change enough to convince anyone staring at them on a big screen that Lawrence could grow up to be Charlize Theron. The best performance here comes from a Mexican child actress, Tessa Ia, as half of one of the fraught mother-daughter relationships.
She displays a severity and control  - an authority  - that even Theron visibly defers to. Burning but never plain, Ia embodies the unemphatic power Arriaga presumably sought in the rest of the movie.

 There is a burning trailer in “The Burning Plain” and also a crashing plane. As literal-minded as much of the movie is, we can safely assume that the title is metaphorical. Important symbols are scattered through this film, which opens in theaters nationwide on Friday after spending about a month as a video-on-demand insomnia cure. Sometimes birds take wing and soar through the sky, though they can also be killed by slingshot and roasted on a makeshift grill. There are physical scars that characters display (or inflict on themselves) to make manifest the pain within.  A tidy little term paper could be written about the motifs in “The Burning Plain” and about the way they wind through a multistranded, chronologically fractured story of loss, guilt, betrayal and general moroseness. Actually, the assignment has already been completed, in the form of Guillermo Arriaga’s screenplay. Like his scripts for “21 Grams” and “Babel,” this one makes heavy use of happenstance and temporal displacement, and like them, too, it depends on ideas about human behavior that can only be called preposterous.  But those movies, which were directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, balanced their silly conceits with some seriously good acting. (Mr. Arriaga’s best script, “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,” was directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who also starred.) In this case, with Mr. Arriaga in the director’s chair for the first time, the acting is merely serious.  The action swings back and forth in time and place, gathering apparently disconnected scenes into a big, doughy ball of significance. In  Oregon, an unhappy restaurant hostess named Sylvia (Charlize Theron) smokes cigarettes and stares at the waves crashing against the rocks before heading indoors either for a shift of work or a bout of sad, empty sex. An unshaven, nervous-looking fellow (José María Yazpik) seems to be stalking her. Who is he? And who, for that matter, is she?  Meanwhile — also? elsewhere? because? who knows! — a blond woman (Kim Basinger) is having an affair. Before her transgression, or rather as a consequence of it (though in Mr. Arriaga’s world causes usually follow consequences, rather than the reverse),  the trailer where she and her lover (Joaquim de Almeida) have  their trysts goes up in flames, killing both of them. One of his sons (J. D. Pardo, who will grow up into Danny Pino) and one of her daughters (Jennifer Lawrence, who will grow up into Ms. Theron) make eyes at each other, and pretty soon they’re dating. By which I mean killing birds with slingshots and taking turns burning significant scars into arms. In due course, they have a baby.  Have I given too much away? Did you want to know about the plane crash? Eventually, all the mysteries are solved, which is not to say that the movie ever comes close to making sense. It looks terrific, thanks to Robert Elswit’s cinematography, which captures the dust of New Mexico and the damp of Oregon. But the elliptical structure of the narrative can’t cover up its  overheated, half-baked banality.  “The Burning Plain” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity and violence.

Many of the weaknesses and few of the strengths of Guillermo Arriaga as a scripter are evident in his directing debut, "The Burning Plain." Multicharacter head-scratcher, yo-yoing between New Mexico and Oregon, and back and forth in time, doesn't finally reveal much beneath the emperor's clothes to repay viewers' concentration during the first half. Despite an OK-to-good cast led by Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger, plus a handsome tech package, this remains an elaborate writing exercise with few emotional hooks. Upscale auds, drawn by Arriaga's name, may be curious.
Sometimes, with the right direction, Arriaga's spaghetti structures can work just fine ("The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"); at other times, notably in his trilogy with fellow Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ("Amores perros," "21 Grams," "Babel"), the results can be hit-or-miss. There's nothing endemically wrong with the script of "The Burning Plain" that less literal helming couldn't have layered with some genuine feeling.
First 45 minutes toy with the viewer as various storylines are set up. A trailer explodes in the New Mexico desert, and two lovers are toast: Mexican-American Nick Martinez (Portuguese vet Joaquim de Almeida) and Gina (Basinger), a white mother of four. To make matters worse, Nick's teen son, Santiago (J.D. Pardo), catches the eye of Gina's eldest daughter, Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence), at his dad's funeral, where Gina's husband, Robert (Brett Cullen), has come to berate the family for his wife's death.
By this time, film has already been busily cross-cutting with a seemingly unconnected story, where the elegant but uptight Sylvia (Theron) runs a swish eatery on a wave-bruised cliffhead near Portland, Ore. We know she has a secret to hide because she smokes, has businesslike sex with various men and is being followed around by a mysterious man named Carlos (Jose Maria Yazpik). In one of pic's least convincing scenes, she automatically tries to seduce him as well.
Back in New Mexico, the grown Santiago (Danny Pino), now with a 12-year-old daughter, Maria (Tessa Ia), is working as a crop duster with his pal, the selfsame Carlos; Gina and Nick, sneaking away for covert liaisons, have aroused the suspicions of their teenage kids; and young Santiago and Mariana are embarking on a relationship that could have major repercussions for everyone. Huh?
Despite the almost complete absence of visual signposts, it's clear after a reel or so that the picture is constructed on two completely separate time levels, a generation apart. (Craig Wood's editing is as smooth in this respect as is possible.)
The connection between the Oregon and New Mexico strands is clarified not so much by a Big Reveal but through a final confirmation, at the 80-minute mark, of small clues planted earlier. This works fine dramatically, except the movie drags on for another 15 minutes as various characters laboriously find closure on their guilt.
The audience is required to invest so much time in sorting out the early part of the picture -- and to keep pace with Arriaga's cleverness -- that when, at the midway point, there's breathing space to become engaged with the characters, the awful truth dawns that there's little to become engaged with.
Arriaga moves his protags around at the convenience of the screenplay rather than their own, and their emotional lives and dialogue are of a very cliche nature. One exception is the Santiago-Mariana strand � which, largely due to an eye-catching performance by 17-year-old Lawrence, plumbs fresher depths, marbled with perversity, than most of the adults' stories. But the screenplay still doesn't make out a convincing case for her later actions.
Performances are as good as the script allows. Theron (also one of 11 producers) looks elegant and withdrawn without bringing much real emotion to the table; Basinger is only slightly better as an average mom looking for something beyond family life. Adult male roles are largely cutouts, apart from Yazpik's gentle Carlos.
Shooting around Las Cruces, N.M., veteran d.p. Robert Elswit creates striking, sun-blasted vistas of sorghum fields, deserts and mountains, while fellow lenser John Toll's wintry Portland segs provide welcome relief with grays, blacks and blues.


Oregon restaurant manager Charlize Theron, prone to submissive promiscuity and self-inflicted violence, sits naked in bed next to her lover. A decade or so earlier, an abandoned trailer in the middle of the New Mexico desert blazes the title into being. In the fractured, self-impressed screenplays of Guillermo Arriaga (Babel , 21 Grams ), events unfold out of time and space, effects before causes. Arriaga engages us not by playing out human complexities but by using rim shots that reveal how each jigsaw piece fits into his puzzle. (Gee, will that little blonde girl in the desert grow up to be Charlize? Does she cut her thighs to punish herself for something discovered in the final act? Better keep watching.) The writer's most successful works—The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada  and Amores Perros —were bolstered by directors who brought genuine emotion to the screen, but The Burning Plain  marks Arriaga's behind-the-camera debut, and his obviousness is staggering. The present tense rains down in gray-blue melancholy, while the past comes sunkissed in orange, and the sensational pop-psychological damage wrought by two generations onto a third carries all the dramatic heft of a telenovela, albeit one with award-bait cinematography.
