An incest survivor (Maria Bello) acts out her damage by hooking up, via the Internet, with a man she asks to hurt her...and worse. Jason Patric plays the creep in question, and Rufus Sewell is cast against type as her boring, clueless husband. Shot in a chilly, desaturated palette, Downloading Nancy  declares, in every frame, that we're in a world without love, faith, joy, or connection. There are brutal scenes with razor blades and other impromptu devices of erotic torment, but what makes the movie a trial to sit through isn't just the heroine's pain-freak tastes. It's that a kinkfest with this blah an emotional spectrum is selling its own chic form of puritanism  sex with all the life force repressed. C–

 A nasty exploitation flick tarted up with art-house actors and psychobabble, “Downloading Nancy” stars Maria Bello as an unhappy hausfrau who goes trolling online to find someone to do her terminal harm. Crosshatched with self-inflicted wounds — she likes to cut herself, mainly, it seems, because such injuries have become an indie-film trend — Nancy discovers a partner in extreme pain, Louis (Jason Patric,  embracing his role with his usual grim intensity). There will be blood, oh yes, along with a lot of emoting from two actors on the verge of permanent self-parody. Ms. Bello weeps beautifully, but what a waste.  Although the appropriately murky cinematography from Christopher Doyle evokes a dirty aquarium, the movie doesn’t contain a single believable beat or character. Johan Renck, a Swedish native with a lot of commercials and music videos on his résumé, moves the characters around like the stick figures they are. The cliché-ridden script by Pamela Cuming and Lee Ross offers no surprises, even when the story toggles between past and present. Poor Nancy not only comes with a history of abuse, she also has an inept therapist (Amy Brenneman), a cold husband (Rufus Sewell) and plastic on the furniture. These days before a woman can break out of her dollhouse, she really does have to submit to all kinds of hideous abuse.

A forbidding and morbid piece of psycho-sadomasochism, "Downloading Nancy" is chilly enough to cause global cooling all by itself. Built around a swimming-in-the-deep-end performance by Maria Bello that is the definition of fearless, this first feature by big-deal Swedish commercials and music vid helmer Johan Renck feels like a walk-on-the-wild-side Euro entry rather than anything that would normally come out of the Amerindie movement. Commercial prospects, at least Stateside, are below zero.
Film is set partly in Baltimore but was shot in Saskatchewan in the dead of winter by ace lenser Christopher Doyle in greenish-blue hues that make everyone look like they've got full-body gangrene. Pic has a deathly pallor entirely in synch with the desire of Bello's Nancy to depart her mortal coil for whatever lies beyond.
Nancy's unfathomable rage lies at the heart of Pamela Cuming and Lee H. Ross' script, intercut fragments of which portray her inert marriage to businessman Albert (Rufus Sewell), the latter's slow-burn reaction to his wife's disappearance, Nancy's dance-of-death with Louis (Jason Patric), the man she has chosen online to "wipe my slate clean," and the violent face-off between the two men as Albert tries to learn what happened to his wife.
Despite scenes of an agitated Nancy with her shrink (Amy Brenneman), the reasons for her bottomless despair can't be articulated; her marriage is dead, but that doesn't mean she has to be. Clearly, it's something much deeper, beyond rational expression, and Bello's ferocious performance has to be counted as a total success for the simple reason that, when pushed to the brink, she is completely convincing in expressing Nancy's certainty that nothing, not even love, can liberate her from her condition except death.
On a moment to moment basis, however, pic continuously skirts very close to the ludicrous in its advanced-stage grimness and outre forms of torture foreplay. As Nancy requires pain from her hunky executioner, Louis uses her nether-regions as an ashtray and, most imaginatively, blindfolds her and guides her across a room so that her toes and feet will be repeatedly snapped by mousetraps, all to the accompaniment of droning techno music.
Renck indisputably proves he's able to sustain a tone, but it's a pretentiously solemn one in which the wallow in extreme psychological and emotional realms are continuously disrupted by silly and distracting real-life details, such as Albert's esoteric business scheme of establishing indoor golf ranges in airports.
Performances are cranked up to red-line neurotic levels, while production values intently contribute to creating an artificially bleak world where it's understandable scarcely anyone would want to spend time, even for the duration of this movie.

'Life is like being trapped in the wrong house, looking for a way out," says Nancy (an excruciatingly believable Maria Bello ) in this film's first moments. A stranger she's met in an s/m chat room, named Louis "Deep Pain" Farley (Jason Patric ), has promised Nancy the torture-'n'-sex release she yearns for, so off she goes to her fate, leaving her clueless husband of 15 years (Rufus Sewell ) a note saying that she's staying with friends, and abandoning viewers to the brutal, agonizing transactions between the film's three main characters. Nancy's overriding resolve dominates this story: Nothing will get in the way of her dream death—neither the love she and Louis come to share, nor his attempts to abandon their arrangement. Downloading  is a triumph for the actors, particularly Bello, and the harsh lighting, handheld camera, and schizoid electronic soundtrack sink us further into a sense of vertigo and despair. But the jump cuts and nonlinear narrative are gratuitously stylish, and when you peel away this film's complex performances, at the core of its drawn-out suicide spectacle is pain so extreme, so alienating, and, in the end, so pointless.
