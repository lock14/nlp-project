You may remember �outsourcing� as the bugaboo of the 2004 presidential campaign. More than the war in Iraq, more than gay marriage, more than political flip-flopping, this
 was the disease that was killing America. Candidates, pundits, and wonks of all stripes couldn�t get enough of talking about its dangers, mesmerizing the children with tales of a jobless America and a world where Indians and Thailanders would be making baseballs and Fords and apple pies and shipping them back to us at bargain prices. Of course, on the other side of the economic equation, things were even worse. The jobs being outsourced � to India, to Pakistan, to Southeast Asia � were Dickensian at best, draconian at worst: slave labor, essentially, designed to exploit the dire financial state of an entire class of workers who weren�t even allowed to go to the bathroom, much less flirt by the watercooler (which was either full of unclean water or didn�t exist). All in all, a terrifying vision of the future and not one you�d expect to see getting the romantic-comedy treatment. Well, meet Todd Anderson (Hamilton), a sales manager at a Seattle company that trades in patriotic knickknacks. One morning Todd is summoned into his boss� office and told he�ll be losing his entire team to outsourcing and that it�s off to rural India with him to train a new group of phone operators in the fine art of American salesmanship. Incredulous at first, indignant at second, dyspeptic after eating his first meal, but eventually swayed by the gentle rhythms of life in rural India, Todd becomes the poster boy for immersive, life-altering travel. Working in a ramshackle office with a sign that says � ominously � �Fulfillment� over the door, he gradually sheds his cynical urban defenses and opens up to the thousand-and-one small wonders of the subcontinent, both spiritual and decidedly not: He falls in love, he learns to dance, he eats exotic foods, he wears loose-fitting clothes, he communicates with Kali (goddess of destruction), and, most important, he experiences firsthand chapters 3 through 7 of The Kama Sutra
. Any movie willing to put such a sunshiny glow on such a deflating subject deserves some credit, whether for inveterate optimism or good-natured self-delusion. Its head may be in the sand, but Outsourced
 is a good-spirited idyll, an escape from reality, naive to a fault, and all but unconcerned with the troubles of the world but almost � almost � convincing in its innocence.


A Seattle call center manager discovers life and love in India when he's "Outsourced." Not to be confused with Columbia's announced Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson starrer of the same title due in 2008, this unaffected charmer treats a hot-button contempo issue with old-fashioned grace and benevolent wit, rendering it a sure-fire word-of-mouth crowd-pleaser at fests, in first-run and on ancillary.
Thirty-two-year-old Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) manages the order filling call center of Western Novelty: "We sell kitsch to rednecks," he explains, with typical efficiency. Abruptly told by boss Dave (Matt Smith) that his entire department is being outsourced to India, the Seattlite finds himself persuaded to travel there and train his replacement.
Todd's the kind of guy who dons a suit and tie for an international flight, so the heat and chaos of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) proves somewhat of a shock. Making his way by crowded train to the village of Gharapuri, he's met by Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra), a local eager beaver who plans to parlay the job he's swiping from Todd into a secure arranged marriage but is so unfamiliar with English slang he's no idea what the word "schmuck" means.
In a half-built concrete bunker, wrangling a staff alternately puzzled and appalled by such product items as Burger Brander and plastic Cheeseheads, Todd labors to teach his charges the American way of life and bring the all-important MPI--"minutes per incident"--of each phone order to the six decreed by the home office (it stands at over twice that when he arrives).
Through the business skill, sincere friendship and eventual love of employee Asha (Ayesha Dharker), Todd learns to embrace his new surroundings and marshal the available forces to get the job done.
Inspired by helmer John Jeffcoat's semester abroad in Southern Asia, knowing script was co-written with George Wing, whose other romantic comedies include "50 First Dates" and, for MGM, a new version of Billy Wilder's "Avanti!" Together, they're smart enough to eschew character quirkiness in favor of location flavor, letting the environment set the pace and dictate the relationship.
A tremendously genial screen presence who manages to portray both puzzlement and proficiency, New York stage vet Hamilton is the perfect aud surrogate, a stranger in a strange land who surprises himself with his own adaptability. The troubled protagonist of "The Terrorist" and Queen Jamillia in "Star Wars: Episode II--Attack of the Clones," Dharker now proves herself equally adept at light romantic comedy as the capable, passionate Asha. The chemistry between the two is natural and unforced. Vet Larry Pine is fine in a single scene as an American offering sage advice to the frustrated Todd.
Tech contributions are streamlined, with visual package falling just short of TV gloss and production design presenting a rumpled yet appealing atmosphere. Though shot on 35mm, Toronto screening caught was projected digital vid.


Outsourced  has all the charm and color of its made-in-India locations, yet it's craftedwell craftedaccording to familiar Hollywood  convention. Director John Jeffcoat  and co-writer George Wing  took the DIY route with their eminently salable script, in which an unhappy Seattle yuppie (Josh Hamilton ) goes to train his replacement in India, where he meets a cute girl (Ayesha Dharker ) who causes him to reconsider his workaholic life. Yes, there are wandering cows, weird food, and the inevitable diarrhea jokes, but Outsourced  has a gentle touch with the obvious fish-out-of-water touchstones. Dharker, who labors in a cow-infested call center, is winningpromote that woman to The Office  already! And though we can imagine Hollywood adapting the rom-com starring, say, Luke Wilson  and Salma Hayek  (with Hindu bindi, no doubt), like the cheerfully ragged, flooded, cross-wired call center that Hamilton eventually builds in Gharapuricomplete with shrine in every cubicle!the low-cost alternative has a lot more character.
