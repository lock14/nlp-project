Cohen's third feature � following 2002's mostly overlooked Ali G Indahouse
 and 2006's hugely successful Borat
 � is a lot like its rampantly gay, Viennese protagonist: The film may have only the best of intentions, but it tries way too hard and ends up being shallow, superficial, and only sporadically funny. It's certainly a far cry from the cultural beat-down of Borat
, which in hindsight proves to be a surprisingly good-natured and even sweet mockumentary/provocation when compared to the downright mean-spiritedness of this new(-ish) Cohen incarnation. It says something about the somewhat situationist, vaguely absurdist philosophy of the comic, as well as that of helmer Charles, that Br�no
 was rumored to have undergone some adjustments in hopes of placating defensive gay groups that felt the initial cut of the film might allow the movie's stridently nonjudgmental (toward gays but virtually no one else) tack to get lost in a theatre full of Yankee Doodle white trashers. They have a point, though. Cohen's Br�no is less specific and less interesting � and therefore less funny � than the dim Kazakhstani reporter of his previous film, and Br�no
 feels far less like a skewering of puritanical American homophobia than it does an excuse to string together a series of jury-rigged sketches and encounters with the likes of Ron Paul (who exits in a queer-phobic huff after Br�no comes on to him in a hotel room) that probably wouldn't have passed muster on Da Ali G Show
. While it's certainly possible that a theatre full of Southern-fried rednecks might not get the joke, or care to, the converse is so ill-tempered here that you almost feel bad for all the cultural flotsam and jetsam on parade here. That includes the group of Deliverance
-esque bunny hunters who accept Br�no into their midst (why?) and the Dallas-area talk-show crowd that recoils at the sight of Br�no's newest fashion accessory: an African baby he "swapped" for an iPod on his way to the U.S. Other problems are purely aesthetic � Cohen lets his Austrian accent slip several times into his native Cambridge � and the film suffers mightily from a slapdash style that simply doesn't feel intentional. Whether this is the result of the alleged reshoots or just part of the Ali G ethic of keepin' it real is anyone's guess, but Br�no
 never comes close to the inspired comic/cultural lunacy of Borat
, or even the dunderhead fearlessness of Ali G
.

After touring America as the nincompoop Kazakh journalist Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen tries again (strains, actually) as Brüno, the flamboyantly attired nincompoop Austrian journalist who comes to America seeking fame by every means necessary. That includes throwing his crotch at the camera and trying to shoot a sex video with an understandably terrified Ron Paul.
Like “Borat,’’ “Brüno’’ dares America to contradict itself, through a combination of documentary encounters and staged happenings in which many of the participants have little idea what’s going on. With luck, shrewd manipulation, and a beguiling performance from Cohen, “Borat’’ discovered a contemptuous jingoistic streak in good people. “Brüno’’ is a more confrontational affair: It wants to expose America’s homophobia, although calling this movie a work of activism is like calling Spam food.
The character began on Cohen’s HBO show. He was a name-dropping fashion journalist, and his vulgar-naif shtick usually worked in segments that were quick and lethally funny. While Cohen has teamed up again with director Larry Charles, who found a great episodic rhythm for the first film, “Brüno’’ feels protracted. When the filmmakers’ luck dries up, they resort to staged fish-in-a-barrel events that make the movie a more desperate, less surprising exercise.
Following the cancellation of his Austrian TV series (he wrecks an actual runway show by the Spanish designer Agatha Ruiz de la Prada), Brüno moves to Los Angeles to become the “biggest gay movie star since Arnold Schwarzenegger.’’ Initially, the joke appears to be that he’ll never get work because he’s gay, but telling that joke requires a more subtle strategy than the movie’s semi-improvised format can accommodate.
After filming an ill-fated pilot for a celebrity talk show, Brüno forages for adventure. He meets up with former presidential candidate Paul, who looks like he’s trapped in a room with Pepe Le Pew; aims for peace in the Middle East (or “Middle Earth’’ as Brüno puts it); and adopts an African baby that he pulls from a cardboard box spinning on an airport baggage carousel. Evidently, if he can’t have fame, he’ll take notoriety. This leads to further awkwardness during an appearance on a Jerry Springer-esque talk show (of the filmmakers’ invention) in which the all-black audience begs child services to rescue Brüno’s baby, whom his father has named O.J.
Unto themselves these encounters are amusing provocations. But they say more about Cohen than they do about America  - namely that he’s not sure how to make anything larger out of his material. Cohen practices a kind of chemical-reaction comedy. He does his thing, and, hopefully, the person he’s doing it to will respond in kind. Not this time  - or at least not consistently enough.
“Borat’’ combined unsuspecting (some would say innocent) people with Cohen’s brand of insult humor and achieved alchemy. In “Brüno,’’ the formula has no greater end. The movie culminates at a cage fighting show that the filmmakers rigged as a celebration of the attendees’ heterosexuality. The crowd turns angry when they realize the rug has been pulled out from underneath them. The gag isn’t terribly insightful and the reaction isn’t entirely unfair.
When the movie gets desperate it hits Alabama and Arkansas, where the fish, to Cohen’s British eyes, probably seem much easier to shoot. In an attempt to go straight, Brüno visits some gay conversion experts, spends a day at Army basic training, and a night hitting on some redneck hunters. These sequences have their moments, but you watch them feeling sorry for the people in them. I’d love to know what the filmmakers told those hunters in order to let a movie crew record this odd European man sabotaging their hunting trip.
Unlike the more completely realized Borat, Brüno isn’t a character. He and his homosexuality are instruments, part thermometer, part joy buzzer. Brüno’s gayness is a steroidal version of the usual assumptions  - this might be what some straight people fear gays do. But a more daring movie might have had Brüno try his antics out on actual homosexuals. All his targets are safely straight.
Actually, what’s impressive about “Brüno’’ isn’t the movie at all. Rather’s it’s Cohen’s in-character GQ photo spread, his staged harassment of Eminem at the MTV Movie Awards, and the impossible-to-live-up-to subtitle: “Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Males Visibly Uncomfortable in the Presence of a Gay Foreigner in a Mesh T-Shirt.’’ “Brüno’’ is what “Borat’’ was too well-done to be: a publicity stunt about publicity stunts.

Like many other dangerous and controversial comedians (Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Howard Stern), the role-playing guerrilla satirist Sacha Baron Cohen knows how to draw an audience into a conspiratorial relationship with him  and then make you squirm anyway. Brüno , his new quasi-documentary stunt comedy, is, if anything, a crazier, funnier, and even pricklier pincushion of a movie than Borat , his 2006 tweak of all things dumb, bigoted, and American. Teaming up again with director Larry Charles, Baron Cohen once more wanders the U.S. landscape in the put-on guise of an egomaniacally doltish yet weirdly resonant pest. This time he's Brüno, a cretinous and very, very gay Austrian fashion-celebrity-fame whore in skintight hot pants and a frosted mop of Eurotrash hair that spills over his forehead like the tail of a dead squirrel.
Brüno, who refers to himself in the third person, has an imperious, nostril-flaring air; he's the fashionista as commandant. After he gets kicked off of Funkyzeit , the discofied TV bash he hosts in Austria, he says that ''Brüno was blacklisted,'' substituting a Teutonic racial slur for ''black.'' Brüno , let's be clear, is not a film that behaves itself, even for an ''enlightened'' audience. You can't squeeze it into a tidy liberal box, because it's only too happy to flirt with the taboos and frat-house intolerances it's ridiculing.
As Brüno travels across America and, at moments, visits other parts of the world, he has one compulsion  to become famous  and he'll achieve it in any way possible. He starts off by trying to meet celebrities, with little success (he gets a ''F--- off!'' from Harrison Ford). On a Dallas talk show, he parades his adopted black baby, which nearly touches off a   riot. The scene is a vicious skewer of stars who turn adopted kids into accessories, yet the real joke is that it doesn't take long for a talk show devoted to ''compassion'' to tease out the pitchfork-mob rage of the studio audience. For a while, Brüno, taking a cue from Hollywood, pretends to be straight. He goes to a party for swingers, in a scene so bizarre you'll think, It can't be fake . He also attends a gay ''deprogramming'' session with an evangelical therapist who looks, let's just say, a little bit less than qualified.
The more uncomfortable Brüno makes people, the more he draws attention to their petty churlishness and homophobia. When  he ambushes the maverick politician Ron Paul with a go-go dance, you can forgive a visibly shaken Paul for thinking Brüno is nuts  though that's hardly an excuse for calling him ''queer.'' Yet is Brüno the scurrilous man-tramp himself a homophobic caricature? My honest answer is: yes and no. Baron Cohen's portrayal certainly feeds into a stereotype of haughty flamboyance. But if one condemns the movie on that basis, then shouldn't we toss Christopher Guest's sublime turn in Waiting for Guffman , Robin Williams' inspired camping in The Birdcage , and so many others onto the bonfire, too? The bottom line is that Baron Cohen, even at his most scathing, makes Brüno gleefully unapologetic about who he is.
Brüno  is no comedy of hate, though it does mock any hint of piety by pushing Brüno's in-your-face sexuality...well, in our faces. The movie piles on gags about outré bedroom devices and butt bleaching, and when Brüno pays a visit to a psychic, he tries to bridge the spirit world by miming oral sex (and that's putting it mildly). The psychic's reaction isn't all that funny; mostly, he's just stoically embarrassed. But that's because Baron Cohen is really goofing on us, exploiting the audience's squeamish sexual anxiety only to explode it. Far more than in Borat , he holds a fun-house mirror up to our hidden prejudices, too.
The entire film is in seriously questionable taste, and there will, of course, be debates about what's staged and what's not. Those looking for purity in satire should stay away. Yet there's a vision at work in Brüno   the movie is a toxic dart aimed at the spangly new heart of American hypocrisy: our fake-tolerant, fake-charitable, fake-liberated-yet-still madly-closeted fame culture. Brüno  ends on a note of scandalously funny out-and-proud triumph, and that's because Sacha Baron Cohen never makes a plea for tolerance. He tosses a grenade for tolerance. A–
The Movie Critics: Owen Gleiberman and Lisa Schwarzbaum spar over Brüno :


 In his various incarnations — Ali G, Borat and now, at feature length, Brüno — Sacha Baron Cohen leads his audience in a two-step of squirming discomfort and smug affirmation. Like “Borat,” “Brüno” (Mr. Baron Cohen’s new vehicle, also directed by Larry Charles) offers both succor and sucker bait for liberal-minded viewers who may feel harassed and hemmed in by prevailing and ever-shifting cultural sensitivities.  We all know, for example, that it’s wrong to laugh at foreigners, that making fun of their accents and customs is worse than passé. But Borat, with his outlandish attitudes and offensive behavior, granted an exemption to anyone who was in on the joke. You could titter and guffaw at his backward, ignorant buffoonery because, of course, the real xenophobes were the people on screen who fell for the hoax that this guy was a journalist from Kazakhstan.  They — Americans just like you but of course nothing like you — were exposed as bigots either for being outraged at the things Borat did or for politely agreeing with his misogynistic, anti-Semitic or otherwise objectionable statements. Any twinge of guilt you might have felt on behalf of the actual glorious nation of Kazakhstan was quickly soothed by the spectacle of American intolerance and idiocy that “Borat” purported to expose.  In “Brüno” the main character’s foreignness — he’s from Austria, identified as the land of Hitler but not of Wittgenstein, Schwarzenegger or Freud — is at once amplified and trumped by his homosexuality. Brüno, a strapping fellow with good cheekbones and an obsession with high fashion, minces and swishes his way from Vienna to Los Angeles and then makes improbable and sometimes very funny excursions to Africa, the Middle East and the American South. Wherever he goes his bizarre fashion sense and his utter lack of inhibition elicit raised eyebrows, angry scowls and occasional bursts of full-blown rage. (One of them comes from Representative Ron Paul, the former Republican presidential candidate, who is unwittingly cast in a Brüno sex tape.)  The film demonstrates, at a fairly high level of conceptual sophistication, that lampooning homophobia has become an acceptable, almost unavoidable form of homophobic humor, or at least a way of licensing gags that would otherwise be out of bounds. An early sequence that graphically shows Brüno and his lover exerting themselves in various positions and with the assistance of, among other things, a Champagne bottle, a fire extinguisher and a specially modified exercise machine, derives its humor less from the extremity of their practices than from the assumption that sex between men is inherently weird, gross and comical. The same sequence with a man and a woman — or for that matter, two women — would play, most likely on the Internet rather than in the multiplex, as inventive, moderately kinky pornography rather than as icky, gasp-inducing farce.  But anyone made uncomfortable by Brüno’s extravagant incarnation of a silly, retrograde stereotype of gayness may be relieved and amused to see the panic and confusion he causes in others. And it is of course these others —mainly white Southerners, with a mostly African-American talk-show audience thrown in, perhaps for balance — who are the real targets of the film’s humor. Mr. Baron Cohen and Mr. Charles’s search for ugly Americans yields a meager bounty compared to “Borat,” partly because the success and notoriety of that movie diminished the ranks of potential patsies. This time the filmmakers went to Alabama and Arkansas, set up a barrel with a “Free Fish Food: All You Can Eat” sign, and blasted away.  Sometimes their aim feels true, as when Brüno visits a minister who tries to counsel him toward heterosexuality. And another encounter, with a group of straight swingers, yields some fascinatingly queasy and hilarious moments. But the climactic set piece — a he-man cage match orchestrated to turn into a man-on-man sex show and an antigay brawl — feels both strained and a little too easy.  It’s not all that hard to find people in America who will expose their fear, ignorance and hatred on camera, as anyone with access to YouTube during the last presidential election knows. Derision, though, is not the same as insight, and “Will you look at those dumb rednecks” is not much of a punch line.  “Borat” presented itself as “Cultural Learnings of America,” but as Mr. Baron Cohen has spun himself into something of an entertainment franchise his curiosity has waned along with his satiric daring. In America as seen by Brüno there are, oddly enough, no openly gay people nor anyone whose awkwardness is likely to trouble the composure of the presumed audience.  It should be noted that Mr. Baron Cohen remains a brilliant slapstick artist and a master of voices — Brüno’s mock-German and scrambled American idioms are in some ways even more crazily spot-on than Borat’s gibberish — and a performer of no small discipline and physical courage. He is able to stay in character even, for example, when a naked woman is flogging him with a belt. But in spite of Mr. Baron Cohen and Mr. Charles’s high-level skills and keen low-comic instincts, “Brüno” is a lazy piece of work that panders more than it provokes.  The episodic plot — Brüno comes to America with a sidekick from home (Gustaf Hammarsten), seeks fortune and fame, encounters humiliations to which he is obdurately immune and achieves a redemption of sorts — is a photocopy of “Borat.” Like a thrift-store outfit “Brüno” is an ensemble of borrowings, mostly from wittier, more inventive movies. The vacuity of the fashion world was skewered to zanier effect in “Zoolander,” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” remains the definitive exploration of the collision between Teutonic sexuality and American mores.  What “Brüno” tries hardest to be, and fails most significantly to become, is a sendup of the empty vanity of celebrity culture. Brüno, in his quest for stardom, encounters and exploits bottom feeders, hangers-on and desperate aspirants for membership in the charmed circle of fame. “Will you look at those dumb losers” is the punch line here, and it sometimes elicits a spasm of shocked laughter.  Still, the arrow of satire flies straighter and lands harder when it is aimed upward, and poking fun at the powerful and the entitled is no longer something Mr. Baron Cohen is inclined to do. Why should he? He’s A-List all the way, showing some leg on the cover of GQ and able to wrangle the likes of Sting, Bono and Snoop Dogg into a music video tacked onto the end of “Brüno.” It’s a pretty clever bit — Snoop’s line about Brüno as “the white Obama” may be the funniest one in the movie —  and all the musicians look happy to be playing along with the joke. Good for them. But the joke is on you.  “Brüno” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It shows great interest in many aspects of the male anatomy.

There are 61 laughs, three dildos, one gyrating, talking penis, an anal bleaching and one very pissed-off politician in "Bruno," which should be enough to make any movie fly. But there is also a pronounced nasty streak to the innumerable provocations staged by the title character that curdles the laughs and wears out the flamboyant Austrian fashionista's welcome within the picture's brief 82-minute running time. Undeniably funny, outrageous and boundary-pushing, this further documentation of Sacha Baron Cohen's sheer nerve will draw an abundant share of "Borat" fans, gross-out seekers and the culturally curious, making for some potent B.O. figures, at least at first. But the content will turn off some (no doubt including some gays), as will the sourness and ill will triggered by the picture's cumulative misanthropy.
"Borat" scored its sensation not only due to its comedic audacity and Cohen's sangfroid, but because it convincingly presented ordinary people's reactions to the star's myriad incitements. Even though the format is similar here, with Bruno appearing in unlikely places to surprise the unsuspecting, the suspicion persists that most of the sequences were staged, with the majority of the participants in on the gag or even portrayed by actors.
Whatever the actual breakdown of "real" versus elaborately faked scenes under director Larry Charles' guidance, the result feels far more scripted and narratively driven than did "Borat," which also benefited from a more unique and cleverly conceived central character. Bruno is a striver, the latest incarnation of a country bumpkin drawn to Hollywood to become a star; the twist is that, unlike many of his predecessors, he's far from innocent and relentlessly tweaks the establishment's political correctness with a straight face -- the only straight thing about him.
Showing off his leaner and toned body in a series of often comically absurd costumes, the brown-and-blond-coiffed Bruno is introduced as the star of a Euro TV fashion show, "Funkyzeit." After crashing a runway presentation, however, Bruno is "schwartzlisted," which frees him to go to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming "the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler."
The film and the character lay their sexual cards on the table in a dizzying montage of carnal permutations practiced by Bruno and his diminutive Asian boytoy, setting the tone for subsequent bawdiness that pushes the proverbial envelope while suggesting plenty got left in the Avid delete queue. Once in Hollywood, he attempts to launch a celebrity interview show, one on which he proclaims his cultural sensitivity by replacing the furniture with down-on-all-fours Mexicans and having initial guests Paula Abdul and La Toya Jackson sit on them. (In light of Michael Jackson's death, Universal has opted to remove the footage of La Toya Jackson, which includes a scene of Bruno trying to get the King of Pop's phone number.) One undoubtedly "real" moment has Bruno stalking Harrison Ford and being angrily told by the star to buzz off, in rather less decorous terms.
Pic takes a fateful turn toward the queasy, from which it never entirely recovers, with a noxious "Gotcha!" sequence in which Ron Paul, the libertarian-minded recent presidential aspirant, is played for a sap. Charitably willing to sit for an interview, the clearly clueless politico is led into a bedroom, upon which Bruno begins stripping as if in preparation for a tryst. When Paul realizes he's been set up, he storms out and furiously calls his captor a "queer" a couple of times, which will no doubt rankle some of his erstwhile supporters. But his epithets arguably pale in comparison with the venality of his predator's arachnidan motives.
Absent this interlude, the film might have blithely proceeded on its merry way. As it is, the humor -- and it keeps on coming -- carries with it an almost immediate sour aftertaste, as Bruno's intentions, and necessarily Cohen's along with them, appear far from honorable. As in "Borat," "Bruno's" pranks are designed to expose people's presumed latent prejudices. But while the previous film got away with this high-wire act for most people, "Bruno" is more erratic, partly since one is more aware of the game being rigged but also because Bruno himself comes off as someone the world scarcely needs another example of -- a self-absorbed narcissist for whom fame is the only goal. Cohen is critiquing this attitude, of course, but the film comes to share too much of this anything-for-effect mindset.
That said, there are numerous jaw-dropping sequences: Bruno's deliberately incendiary interviews with Israelis and radical Palestinians (real? Who knows?); his Madonna- and Angelina-inspired adoption of a black African baby and subsequent taunting appearance before an all-black TV studio audience; his attempt to undergo a "gay cure" through counseling and then via macho martial-arts training; a pretty amazing visit to a blue-collar swingers' party; and, finally, his goading a mangy, beer-swilling Arkansas crowd into an anti-gay frenzy at a cage wrestling extravaganza. Real? Once again, who knows?
Pic is of a noticeably higher technical quality than "Borat," which may not be an advantage in terms of credibility.

"Heterosexuals can't understand camp because everything they do  is camp," opined an associate of the old Playhouse of the Ridiculous, a theater known for its good-natured, anarchic sexual farce—a piece like Turds in Hell , which offered a farrago of sodomy, sadomasochism, incest, coprophagia, bestiality, homosexual behavior of every kind, dildo-swatting, and erotic practices beyond description, all played for laughs.
Such, more or less, is the method of the new Sacha Baron Cohen  extravaganza, Brüno . Communist Poland  supported a sort of Yiddish theater without Yids; is it possible to have Ridiculous comedy without queers? Brüno , directed by guerrilla filmmaker Larry Charles , is often hilarious. Lynn Shelton 's mumblecore bromance Humpday , a sexual sitcom, is also very funny. Are they minstrel shows? Co-opting gay culture? Evidence of new tolerance or ineradicable prejudice? Or are they just using queer-ness to talk about something else?
The eye-batting, lip-pursing, petulantly self-regarding host of the Austrian TV show Funkyzeit , Brüno is a star—and regarded as such from the disco flourish that first heralds his appearance in hot-canary lederhosen to his final triumph before a wrestling-fan rabble bellowing "straight pride." Brüno  itself is vulgar vaudeville of the highest order. It's conceptually comparable to John Waters 's radically ridiculous Pink Flamingos  in its programmatic desire to outrage, but, unlike Brüno , Pink Flamingos  came from somewhere beyond the pale. Whatever else happens in Brüno 's world, nobody eats shit—literally, that is.
Baron Cohen casts the straight world as his straight man, although it hardly seems likely that audiences will respond as indignantly as the "real-life" focus group assembled to evaluate the pilot for Brüno's American TV show, A-List Celebrity Max-Out mit Brüno . Still, Brüno  has something to offend everyone—or had. Just before the movie's Los Angeles premiere, a scene in which Brüno "interviews" a befuddled LaToya Jackson —coaxing her to imitate brother Michael as she sits perched on the back of a middle-aged Mexican laborer stolidly on his hands and knees (the only available furniture)—was cut out of deference for the Jackson family. Baron Cohen can make a Jesus joke or bait Hasidim, but his anti-clericalism has limits—mocking Michael Jackson  would be blasphemy. This is unfortunate because the late sacred monster and his newly resurrected fan base are intrinsic to Brüno's critique of show business.
Brüno's irrepressible outré sexuality is only the most provocative aspect of his mad exhibitionism. Brüno  burlesques homophobia the way Borat  did anti-Semitism, but its true subject is the nature of celebrity—or rather the dialectic between celebrity and otherness. Le freak, c'est chic . To the degree that Brüno  has a plot, it follows its "schwarz-listed" fashionista to Hollywood , where he hopes to become "the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler ." (Hitler? In another bit of misplaced tact, Brüno's gubernator compatriot is conspicuously unmentioned.)
Like any star, Baron Cohen resolves contradictions—he's an open-minded bigot, an amoral moralist, an honest conman, a clever fool, and a performer whose crudeness is filled with grace. Even more than Borat , Brüno  attests to the actor's skill at verbal and physical comedy. Baron Cohen's fluent falsch Deutsch  rivals the bluster Mel Brooks  used to write for Sid Caesar —although not even Brooks would have dared use Auschwitz  as a synonym for arschloch  (asshole). Whether wreaking havoc on a fashion show or pantomiming a blowjob or using a martial arts instructor as a foil to dramatize homosexual panic, Baron Cohen is a superb clown. He's also fearless—prancing into a "God Hates Fags" demonstration, outrageously cruising a group of backwoods hunters (whom he compares to "the Sex and the City   girls"), and crashing a hetero swingers' party (which takes Brüno  pretty close to an X). There's a reason why the ring in the Arkansas wrestling arena is surrounded by a chain-link, barbwire-topped fence—Baron Cohen's gag might well have gotten him crucified.
Even after Borat , Baron Cohen manages to confound ordinary people and dim-witted professionals—although the setups and supportive editing strategies seem here more apparent. He pranks a hotel's room service with an elaborate s/m tableau and visits a Christian "therapist" who specializes in converting gays to straight: "Can I still play the clarinet? What if I put a flute up my shtinker?" LaToya aside, a few fellow celebs fall for his line. Is Congressman Ron Paul , whom Brüno chooses to confuse with RuPaul , really that clueless or was the Republican presidential candidate only desperate for publicity in allowing himself to be inveigled into Brüno's hotel room for an "interview"? It hardly matters. That desperation is Brüno 's universal principle. Thus, Baron Cohen reserves his most brutal satire for the use of accessory children.
Returning from safari, Brüno unpacks his souvenirs before an incredulous crowd surrounding the airport baggage carousel; the trinkets include a six-month-old African adoptee. Naturally, he uses the baby to get himself on a Springer-type TV show, infuriating a mainly African-American audience by explaining that little O.J. is his "dick magnet." Others may be appalled when Brüno haughtily auditions a series of avid stage parents, getting them to agree to allow their babies to act on a set lit by phosphorus, work with "antiquated machinery," dress up as Nazis, dramatize the crucifixion of Christ, and, if necessary, submit to liposuction. Outrage is entertainment! Baron Cohen has predicated Brüno  on the idea that Americans will do almost anything to achieve their 15 minutes of fame—as will Brüno, not to mention his inventor. What's more, we dig it.
