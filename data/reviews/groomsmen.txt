 As a realist filmmaker, Edward Burns knows that an intimate knowledge of the old neighborhood can’t be acquired from a crash course in local customs; you have to have grown up there. In “The Groomsmen,” his latest of several trips back to an Irish-American enclave on the outskirts of New York (in this case, City Island in the Bronx), he paints a scathing portrait of raucous high school buddies clutching at their rock ’n’ roll glory days as they push 35.  Observing this pack of swaggering overgrown babies guzzling beer, dropping the names of 1980’s rock bands and making ragged music together in a garage, the movie evokes the creepy mixture of comfort and suffocation that a reunion of the old gang can produce.  What gives Mr. Burns’s movies their spark is his gut-level empathy for these people, most of whom he understands deeply and relies on for inspiration.  In “The Groomsmen,” just when it seems as if he might have pulled off an American “I Vitelloni,” his X-ray vision glazes over, and he resolves the anxiety and despair hanging over the reunion with tearful hugs and phony reassurances.  At his most insightful, Mr. Burns knows his characters’ every tic. You can almost smell the cooking odors buried in the couches of the modest middle-class homes with basketball hoops in the driveways. But in “The Groomsmen,” Mr. Burns, as he has since “The Brothers McMullen” in 1995, is unable (or perhaps afraid) to contrive a story to match his attunement to place and personality. You tolerate the false sentimentality and his characters’ one-dimensional troubles the way you tolerate the conventions of a sitcom.  The dramatic catalyst is the imminent wedding of Paulie (Mr. Burns), a self-supporting writer, and Sue (Brittany Murphy), his 10-months-pregnant girlfriend. Paulie’s miserable, envious older brother, Jimbo (Donal Logue), who runs a small, struggling business, loudly advises him not to go through with the wedding. Mr. Logue offers an unsettling portrait of a repressed, uncommunicative alcoholic whose childless marriage is beginning to unravel.  Just as pathetic is Paulie’s cousin Mike (Jay Mohr), the group cutup, who still lives with (and works for) his father. The most infantile and nostalgic of the five, Mike is a menace who keeps hounding his ex- girlfriend Jen (Jessica Capshaw) to take him back until her younger brother steps in. When T. C. (John Leguizamo), the lead singer of their high school rock band, returns for the wedding after a mysterious eight-year absence, Mike is still so steamed at him for having stolen his precious Tom Seaver baseball card that they immediately get into a shoving match.  T. C. warily confides to his friends his reason for leaving the neighborhood: he’s gay. Mr. Leguizamo is miscast as this underwritten one-note character, and the blasé reactions to his confession ring false. Mike, whom T. C. remembers as the group’s relentless gay baiter, seems strangely unfazed.  Dez (Matthew Lillard), the most contented of the five, is married with two young sons and owns the neighborhood bar. He embodies the idea bruited about of what it means to be a male adult in this hidebound culture.  That leaves Paulie, whose sudden case of premarriage jitters feels cooked up for dramatic effect. The biggest hole in a movie that falls sadly short of being another “Diner” or “Trees Lounge” is Mr. Burns’s failure to make his alter-ego character anything other than the best-looking and most affluent member of the pack, standing there and discreetly gloating.    “The Groomsmen” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of profanity.
Four thirtyish groomsmen, who grew up together in a close-knit suburban Long Island neighborhood, socialize for a few days with the imminent husband-to-be in Ed Burns' latest riff on middle-class male immaturity, "The Groomsmen." Burns' always impressive sense of place lends authenticity to the pals' perambulations, and the stellar cast brings a welcome overabundance of personality to regrettably one-note roles. Fans may herald "Groomsmen" as a return to classic Burns' McMullen form but, for the general public, the writer-helmer may have gone to this well one time too often to expect better than lackluster returns.
Masculine tete-a-tetes are conducted with drunken belligerence or tearful conviviality at a bar owned by one of the group, and extended bull sessions take place around the diamond of a softball game-cum-bachelor party. Characters schmooze against the backdrop of suburban lawns, or as they trawl for fish, or while driving a few balls at the local golf course. 
Film coasts for quite a while on the sheer potency of its ensemble players. Unfortunately, the more Burns surrounds himself with vibrant thesps, the more wooden his own perf registers, and the mystery of why even a pregnant Brittany Murphy would ally herself to such an emotionless stick begins to trump any script-driven question of commitment. 
Each of the buddies is granted one problem, the stunning directness of the dilemmas matched only by the awesome simplicity of their supposed resolutions. Burns' Paulie, panicking prior to his nuptials, fears impending fatherhood. 
Paulie's big brother Jimbo (Donal Logue), who has been yelling at his wife and frequenting strip bars, harbors quite different reproductive fears. T.C. (John Leguizamo) is secretly gay. 
Paulie's cousin Mike (Jay Mohr) is compulsively driven to win his ex-girlfriend back so he can start the family he dreams of, formulating arguments whose pathetic lameness Mohr transforms into pure comedic gold, even as he infuses surprising sweetness into his live-in relationship with his dad. 
Meanwhile, Des (Matthew Lillard) is so fulfilled and grounded by proud fatherhood that his obsession with reviving the high school rock band reads only as cutely innocuous. 
While the men drunkenly flounder about, the women wisely and winsomely wait at home. Even Murphy's pregnancy affords her only a modicum of hormonal hysteria before proceeding to Happily Ever After. 
It never takes much in an Ed Burns film to bring the lost sheep back into the fold, the off-kilter improvisational rhythms and real location indie production always landing squarely in the service of bedrock conservatism. Yet, as time goes by, the supposedly everyday middleclass lifestyles effortlessly enjoyed by his regular Joes begin to seem suspiciously like the province of the idle rich.

In the decade since he won Sundance and scored a modest commercial hit with The Brothers McMullen , writer, director, actor, and former Entertainment Tonight   PA Ed Burns  has churned out a series of thinly disguised retreads of his promising debut feature, to diminishing financial and artistic returns. In his latest, Burns plays a Long Island  newspaperman reunited with a gaggle of family and friends on the eve of his wedding. Myriad crises and displays of post-post-adolescent bad behavior ensue, from the underachieving cousin (Jay Mohr ) who pines for his clearly disinterested ex to the disheveled older brother (Donal Logue ) whose own marriage has hit the skids. For good measure, there's also a long-absent childhood pal (John Leguizamo ) whose admission of homosexuality is played as though it were a Crying Game style shocker. At the center of it all rests Burns, that unwavering avatar of red-blooded Irish Catholic masculinity, dispensing sage lessons in dude-ology while wondering if he himself is really ready for "I do." Fatally conventional in nearly every respect, the movie would be easy to dismiss were it not for Burns's frustrating knack for inserting unexpectedly truthful moments amid all the dross. Midway through The Groomsmen , a happily married-with-children barkeep (Matthew Lillard ) delivers a wise and lyrical monologue about the joys of fatherhood; and there are a number of affecting, well-played scenes mixed in with many others that make you wonder if there was anyone on set to give the actors guidance. So Burns remains an enigma: After six features, it's still impossible to tell if he's a filmmaker with something to say or merely one of the longest-running novelty acts in modern movies.
