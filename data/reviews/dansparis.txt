 The French filmmaker Christophe  Honoré was born   in 1970, almost two years to the month after his country was seized by revolutionary fervor.  By then, the New Wave had crested, and the no-longer-young Turks who had shaken up the art had moved on and apart.  Mr. Honoré appears not to have noticed or much cared.  His heartfelt “Dans Paris”  picks up where the early François Truffaut  and his comrades-in-cinema left off —  with a playful, liberatory style, and a song (actually, a few) in his heart and on his actors’ lips.  “Dans Paris” (or “In Paris”) involves two brothers: the older,  Paul, is played by the professionally moody Romain Duris, while the younger, Jonathan, is inhabited, lissome body and soul,  by that floppy beauty Louis Garrel. When he’s not in school or seducing one in a string of fluttering lovelies, Jonathan lives in an apartment with his loving curmudgeon of a father (the invaluable Guy Marchand) and an enviable view of the Eiffel Tower. Recently, Jonathan has been crashing on the living room couch au naturel, having relinquished his bedroom to Paul, who’s deep in a depression so dark and all-consuming that it threatens to swallow him permanently and might just take his family down for the count too.  A story of love between brothers who are a study in contrasts  — light and dark, delight and despair, hope and its absence  — “Dans Paris” is very much also about that glorious, fizzy, enlivening flashpoint when you think love might have struck, and that crushing, seemingly bottomless moment when you know it has left the room for good.  For Paul, who’s recently separated from the quarrelsome Anna (Joana Preiss), an angular beauty with an unsmiling mouth and hovering rain clouds, the world seems to have collapsed. Tucked in Jonathan’s bed, his face carpeted in new beard, Paul curls into himself like a slug, like a fetus, like a closing circle. He’s dying, or at least thinks he wants to, and he’s taking his story with him.  That leaves Jonathan to tell Paul’s story, which he initially does by brashly talking into the camera. There’s a touch of nostalgia in this form of direct address, which invokes the work of Jean-Luc Godard in much the same way that a later scene of a couple in bed boldly references  Truffaut’s 1970 film “Bed and Board.”  The fourth chapter in Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel series, “Bed and Board” is about marriage and mistakes, and that hazardous stretch separating adolescence from adulthood. In some respects, it is about the end of an era  — for Truffaut, for the New Wave and its admirers  — though it also appears to have served as a point of creative departure for Mr. Honoré, as a new beginning, not an end.  Though Jonathan tells Paul’s story, he talks to the camera only briefly before sliding back fully into character. This wink at the fourth wall works partly because it’s so abbreviated. Mr. Honoré may be a student of the New Wave but he’s not a slave, and he steers clear of pastiche in this film precisely because he knows the difference between empty imitation and creative inspiration.  In “Dans Paris” he freely uses jump cuts and, on occasion and rather more daringly, plays with the camera speed so that the characters race about in herky-jerky fast motion, as if they had been spirited into a badly projected silent movie. The effect is charming, old-fashioned yet invigorating, because of its assertion of form as unabashed content.  While Paul rots in bed (and Papa smokes and stews), Jonathan dives headfirst into the tumult of Paris, immersing himself in its pleasures, its women, its light.  Much as many    memorable young characters from the French New Wave   — the laughing lovers in “Jules and Jim,” the Louvre sprinters in “Band of Outsiders”  — he  hurtles forward as if his life were at stake, perhaps because it is. Like Mr. Duris (whose naked, touching turn here makes up for the calamity of “Molière”), Mr. Garrel delivers an intensely physical performance that organically conveys a world of impetuous emotion, as he bounds from idealism to anguish and back again. Like  Mr. Honoré, these two exceptional performers risk the absurd, beautifully.
In a remarkable about-face after the studiously unappealing shenanigans of "My Mother," helmer Christophe Honore proves he can muster insight and lightness of touch lacking in his previous work. "Inside Paris" is that rarity, a genuinely honest, unpretentious and delightful, small film, alternately sober and effervescent, steering clear of either heavy-going philosophizing or dreaded whimsy. Besides confirming Louis Garrel's ineffable charm, the pic's understanding of depression, embodied by the chameleon-like Romain Duris, is as accurate as it is unadorned by artifice. More than a mere fest item, the pic could find moderate legs on Francophile screens of many nations.
Mirko (Guy Marchand) has two sons, irresponsible Jonathan (Garrel) and volatile Paul (Duris), the latter in thrall to the same kind of depression that led to his sister's suicide some years earlier. Paul has been living with g.f. Anna (Joana Preiss), but their relationship has hit the skids, and Paul returns to his dad's apartment plunged in bottomless despair.
Charting the disintegration of the relationship are a series of scenes displaying the playful, argumentative, even cruel interaction between the couple, edited together so at first it's not certain whether these are past or present, real or possibilities. Montage here -- and later, in quietly exuberant scenes with Jonathan and sometime g.f. Alice (Alice Butaud) -- suggests an homage to "Celine and Julie Go Boating," not an empty comparison, considering the presence of Marie-France Pisier in the small role of the boys' mother.
At his father's, Paul takes over Jonathan's room and refuses to get out of bed despite his father's urgings and his self-absorbed, magnetic mother's visit.
One night, he walks out the door and springs off a bridge into the Seine, returning home as surprised by his action as he is to find himself alive.
Among the many understated qualities of "Inside Paris" is Honore's spot-on understanding of depression. Paul's self-exile in the bedroom includes moments of engagement and even humor, imparting a multidimensionality to a character who could have been just another bore in the doldrums.
Honore, a children's book author, can also add composing to his list of talents: An a cappella duet sung into the phone by Paul and Anna, entitled "Avant la haine" ("Before the Hate") is as haunting melodically as it is lyrically. It would have been so easy for this scene to become precious, but Honore has a raw honesty and an astonishing talent for underplaying that precludes such slip-ups.
From the opening, with Jonathan addressing the audience, Garrel effortlessly captures auds' affection, the perfect naughty boy whose charm commands -- and receives -- the kind of indulgence usually meted out only by doting grandmothers. Duris ("Russian Dolls") delivers a performance of controlled extremes within the realm of truthfulness, reinforcing predictions of an ascending talent.
Through it all, Paris forms a constant backdrop, whether it's the Eiffel Tower glimpsed through the family's windows, or the boulevards Jonathan uses as his playground. Chantal Hymans' accomplished editing may derive in part from Jacques Rivette, but she is no mere follower. Alex Beaupain's jazzy freeform score is ideally suited to the family dynamics, and to Paris itself.

Christophe Honoré 's Dans Paris is both a floppy, joyful tribute to the French New Wave and an inspired retelling of Franny and Zooey , echoing Salinger's pair of novellas cannily and effortlessly. Franny Glass  has become a young French guy named Paul (an awesomely hairy Romain Duris ), and her existential crisis is now a failed love affair (hey, c'est Paris ). But in many other particularsthe benefits of constant prayer, the absence of a beloved elder sibling, the endless phone conversationsthe story is the same.
Paul has moved back in with his father in Paris after an extended stint in the countryside with his lovely girlfriend Anna (Joana Preiss ), who likes to dance around in her underwear. In an intense, disjointed prologue, Honoré relays the disintegration of Paul's relationship with an Eternal Sunshine y stream of flashbacks. Perhaps they're also meant to show us that Paul was a player, because once he gets home and the film starts in earnest, the man is so depressed that he can hardly move. His doting dad (Guy Marchand) is totally out of his element dealing with such darkness; the best he can do is cook up a sole and beg his son to eat.
Paul's brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel ) is the Grand High Goofball of the family. He, too, tries to help without really knowing how, suggesting to Paul that they go admire the Christmas windows of the Bon Marche . When his brother refuses, Jonathan optimistically sets out on his own, marking his progress by sleeping with various women along the way. (Yes, it's a short trek.) As conceived by Honoré, Jonathan is both archetypal trickster, cavorting impishly around the city, and the personification of the New Wave: He introduces the film by opening a curtain and addressing the audience.
Unlike most other movies inspired by SalingerThe Royal Tenenbaums , Igby Goes Down Dans Paris  is set in Paris (well, duh), and so instead of trading on a superficial vision of Life in Quirky Old New York, Honoré is perhaps freer to dig into the source material. What he comes up with is a belief in the transcendence of sibling relationships. Paul and Jonathan look nothing alike. (Duris, here, is a fuzzy little animal, while Garrel has a magnificent, classical head: When he tosses his hair and smirks into the camera, he looks just like one of David's Horatii). They fight, sometimes viciously. But they've read all the same children's books, they've mourned their dead sister together, and they conduct themselves as if they shared a soul.
Honoré, who last directed Ma Mere , wrote this script with Duris and Garrel in mind, and shot the whole movie within the span of a month: "We have everything to gain by shortening the length of time between the desire to make a film and the pleasure of making it," he has said. That might not be entirely trueDans Paris  occasionally drags, and Honoré's reverence for classic French cinema can get cloyingbut for the most part, efficiency has worked in his favor here. The film is a domestic love story of the first order, but it is also a semi-abstract series of quiet, intense momentsa slap, a phone call, a hug in the bathtubthat tiptoe up to a climax both spectacularly and subtly emotional.
