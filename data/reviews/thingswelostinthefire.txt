, he�s managed to top even himself; this most recent performance is right up there with the best screen turns, not just of his generation but of all time: Brando in On the Waterfront

. Rarefied air. In Danish director Bier�s excellent new film, Del Toro plays Jerry Sunborne, a fortysomething junkie living in squalor in downtown Seattle who�s forced to re-examine his life after the violent death of his best and only friend, Steven Burke (the perpetually somnolent Mr. Duchovny). Burke�s wife, Audrey (Berry), never trusted Jerry even when her husband was alive, but she decides to call on him after realizing that raising two kids alone in her emotional state may be an impossible task. Things We Lost in the Fire
 is Bier�s first English-language film and her follow-up to the Oscar-nominated After the Wedding
, and like that film, it�s an impeccably constructed and perfectly paced drama of domestic and internal volatility. The film�s first 20 minutes play out in nonchronological fits and bursts, as befits the memories of those whose lives have been turned upside-down by an act of random brutality. After the oddly calming presence of Jerry descends upon the Burke household, however, Bier tosses out the formal experimentation in favor of a more traditional narrative approach that allows us the chance to bask in the slow boil of two great actors at the peak of their powers. Berry is brilliant here, as good as she�s ever been, drifting from agony to wonder and down into despair with ease. Watch her lash out blindly at Jerry for being too good to her kids for fear they�ll forget their father; you�ll never see a more stunning demonstration of how, in the capable hands of an artist, you can love, loathe, and pity a character all at the same time. In the end, though, this movie belongs to Del Toro. He imbues Jerry with such life, such ambiguity, such unsentimental complexity and depth that you can�t help but feel you�re watching the most intricately mapped depiction of addiction and strained humanity the film world has ever given us.


Were there such a thing as a low-carb melodrama, "Things We Lost in the Fire" would be it - all the tears, half the guilt. The movie gives us Halle Berry as a recent widow named Audrey and Benicio Del Toro as Jerry, a heroin addict and her late husband's best friend. She invites him to join her and her two children in their gorgeous, interracial Seattle home.
Her goodness seems to be a tribute to her beatific husband, Brian (David Duchovny), who was shot dead while saving a woman from an abusive man and who never stopped caring for his strung-out friend, even over his wife's irate objections. (Duchovny, in a passive mood we're supposed to find saintly, is very present in the film's delicately edited first third, courtesy of flashbacks.) Since Audrey has no ostensible career and, we are told, enough money to prevent her from settling on one, she has plenty of time to help rehab Jerry.
The relationship is supposed to be mutually beneficial. She saves him from himself. She and her kids are saved from their grief, which is more or less what happens. That's it. The script, by Allan Loeb, comes up with fights for these two to get into and cute conversations for them to have with Audrey's kids, a 10-year-old girl (Alexis Llewellyn) and 6-year-old boy (Micah Berry) whose unruly curls are meant to make them adorable.
Jerry is the only character with human flaws, and in a movie perfect people tend to be boring. Wherever the movie can turn psychologically complex with Jerry as a replacement father, or sexually interesting, with him as replacement lover, it stays functionally sane. And as a level-headed movie about broken adults, there's only so much grace and refinement the film's director, Susanne Bier, the skilled Dane making her first Hollywood movie, can apply without the visual eloquence leaving the whole thing feeling a little hollow.
The movie is ultimately a junkie's tale. Jerry attends Narconon meetings, where Alison Lohman pops up as an ex-user, and fights to stay clean, which allows Del Toro to act up the sort of squall you expect from Berry, who doesn't act up at all. Audrey is an incomplete character. Even before Brian's death, her world is monochromatic. The film is decorated with interesting faces and personalities - John Carroll Lynch plays a family friend, Omar Benson Miller and Paula Newsome play her brother and sister. But the movie doesn't show her leaning on them for more than functional support. You're barely convinced of the relationships.
Berry gives Audrey her usual combination of strength and need. But she's always best at negative extremes - sadness, anger, hurt, misery, desperation. She has flashes of anger, and she gets to do her crying howl, which has become a kind of anticipated movie event, like the death spiral in figure skating or half of a Jerry Bruckheimer production blowing up in the last 20 minutes. But the movie for her is all emotional middle.
Bier does provide more than enough close-ups to appreciate, once again, how a good performance is often there in the voice and the face. Berry needs her thunderstorm acting because her flawless looks don't always tell a terribly compelling story. When a movie is not driven by theatrics, she seems utterly neutral. On the other hand, Del Toro's unmade bed of a face, with its rough patches, lumps, and wrinkles, is always something to see, especially here. It's alive even when he looks half dead.


         "Things We Lost in the Fire" is rough going at times, and not just because of its downbeat subject matter, its examination of catastrophic loss and the different ways people attempt to deal with it.
 
 But though it is erratic and can come off as manufactured, this film has the gift of gathering strength as it goes on. Potent when it needs to be, it harnesses the talents of stars Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro in ways that ultimately make us sit up and take notice.
 


         






   Doing the harnessing and making her American debut is Danish director Susanne Bier. Celebrated for her exceptional European work -- "Brothers" was nominated for 11 European Film Academy awards and "After the Wedding" was one of last year's nominees for the  foreign-language Oscar -- Bier does the kind of films that made her arrival on these shores inevitable.
 
 Often attracted to stories that involve conflicts between family members and other people who ought to be close, Bier is notable for her willingness to deal seriously and unapologetically with the strongest possible emotions. That talent animates the core of "Things We Lost in the Fire" and makes it worth seeing despite its unevenness.
 
 The facility of the Oscar-winning Del Toro with emotional material, very much in evidence here, is not a surprise. But it is especially satisfying to report that, as widow and mother Audrey Burke, Berry, who has made some unfortunate career choices,  does what's easily her best work since winning her Academy Award for 2001's "Monster's Ball."
 
 It's Audrey's loss that the film focuses on initially, as Allan Loeb's script tells us almost at once that her husband, Brian (David Duchovny), has been killed. Because Brian was a wealthy Seattle-area developer, Audrey has no financial worries, but she does have two young children (Alexis Llewellyn and Micah Berry) who are as bereft by this turn of events as she is.
 
 At the last minute, just before the funeral, Audrey thinks of inviting the most problematic person in her life, Jerry Sunborne (Del Toro), her husband's best friend since childhood, who has gone in and out of heroin addiction as long as she's known him.
 
 "I hated you for so many years and now it seems silly," Audrey tells him when he arrives. Deprived of the only person who hadn't given up on him, Jerry is as much at a loss in his life as Brian's widow is. With nothing in common except the dead man, these two tentatively gravitate toward an emotional détente that might allow each of them to keep living.
 
 Before this scenario even begins to play out, however, "Things" presents extensive flashbacks of what life with Brian was like for both Audrey and Jerry.  It's not clear why these sequences go on as long as they do, but Brian turns out to have been such an exemplary human being that his presence on screen becomes an irritant. It's not only hard to be a saint in the city, it's not very interesting.
 
 Other things are sporadically troublesome about the film. The story goes in and out of being self-consciously earnest and ponderous, a situation that numerous tight close-ups of people's eyes does nothing to help.
 
  Though well acted, scenes involving Jerry's addiction, including meeting Alison Lohman's Kelly at a support group, are unsentimental but awfully familiar.
 
 Fortunately, this is not the end of the story. Whenever you are about to give up on this film, a powerful dramatic moment between Berry and Del Toro will take place, the two actors will go toe to toe in an intense way, and the push-pull of their relationship holds us in its sway.
 
 To its credit, "Things We Lost in the Fire" is determined not to make things easy for Audrey and Jerry, not in their personal lives or in their relationship to each other. Keeping it simple would lessen the emotional content of what's on screen, and that is something no one involved with this film was prepared to do.
 

 
 "Things We Lost in the Fire." MPAA rating: R for drug content and language. Running time: 1 hour, 53 minutes. In general release.   

The memorable character actor John Carroll Lynch, so chilling as the prime suspect in Zodiac , plays the supporting role of Howard, a decent man who hates his wife, in Things We Lost in the Fire . How such a husband negotiates a life of uneventful loathing would make a great, adult movie. But it's not this one, a safely false, glamorized weepie about Audrey (Halle Berry), a lovely wife and mother whose husband, Brian (David Duchovny), is a sexy saint. And then he dies. In her grief, Audrey reaches out to Brian's down-and-out best friend, Jerry (Benicio Del Toro), spontaneously inviting him to live in her elegant garage.
Jerry is only half a saint  he's also a heroin addict. If you haven't seen an actorly re-creation of withdrawal and relapsing recently, now's your chance for a refresher. Working from a script by newcomer Allan Loeb, Danish director Susanne Bier (After the Wedding ) circles Jerry with compassionate curiosity. She also finds nice cinematic shorthands for expressing Audrey's sorrow by pulling in microscopically close on Berry's eye, or on her slim hand with its wedding ring.
But no matter what panache Bier adds, Things We Lost  is still a TV-scaled tear-duct drama about a beautiful woman who pushes past sadness in her House & Garden  home. And Howard's neighborly role is confined to popping by from time to time; he's been Ned Flandersized.

 “Things We Lost in the Fire,” an earnest recovery drama in which Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro give strong, grown-up performances, is the kind of awards-seeking Hollywood movie that bends over backward to prove that serious American movies can hold their own with the best films from overseas. They don’t, of course, except in very rare instances. The star system and the committee mentality, which methodically iron out the quirks from high-minded studio films, make it next to impossible.  It is a sign of this movie’s ambitions that DreamWorks went abroad to recruit Susanne Bier, the gifted Danish writer-director of “Open Hearts,” “Brothers” and “After the Wedding,” in hopes that she would stamp it with the imprimatur of “art.” On paper Ms. Bier, whose unsettling family dramas are the stylistic progeny of Ingmar Bergman via Lars von Trier — without Bergman’s heavy metaphysical baggage and Mr. von Trier’s trickster sensibility — is an ideal candidate for the job. She has the emotional radar of an astute, extremely tough therapist who refuses to avert her gaze from the ugliest family dynamics this side of a Noah Baumbach film.  But what could any director do with this soft, fuzzy, formulaic story of pain and “healing,” concocted by Allan Loeb, an American making his screenwriting debut? Healing, like “closure,” is a concept that when applied to the marketing of popular culture instantly signals emotional manipulation and bad faith.  Although it is impossible to know how much doctoring Mr. Loeb’s script underwent before reaching the screen, all signs point to a meticulous smoothing out of the story to make the movie adhere to someone’s misbegotten notion of an upscale art film with commercial appeal. Because the element of surprise, found in abundance in Ms. Bier’s homegrown films, has been removed, “Things We Lost in the Fire” feels disconnected from the real world.  It begins on a false note by observing the picture-perfect marriage of Brian (David Duchovny) and Audrey Burke (Halle Berry), a successful developer and his wife who live outside Seattle with their two beautiful children, a 10-year-old girl, Harper (Alexis Llewellyn), and a 6-year-old boy, Dory (Micah Berry). Between them, the children’s heads have enough ringlets for several Shirley Temple wigs.  As the movie begins, Brian is shot to death while intervening in a domestic dispute. The family is left in shock. Although Mr. Duchovny vanishes from the film, the notion of him and Ms. Berry playing a happily married couple defies credibility. The more we get to know grim, strait-laced Audrey, the idea that she would tolerate a husband who bears even the tiniest resemblance to Hank Moody, Mr. Duchovny’s sarcastic sensualist on the Showtime series “Californication,” is impossible to swallow. What you see is two stars without chemistry gamely going through the motions.  Enter Mr. Del Toro, playing Brian’s closest childhood friend, Jerry Sunborne, a recovering heroin addict living in a halfway house. After everyone else gave up on Jerry, Brian continued giving him handouts and encouragement in his fragile recovery, much to Audrey’s chagrin. Out of loyalty to Brian, she invites Jerry to stay in their garage for nothing in exchange for his helping around the property. Their edgy relationship, which for one brief moment heads toward romance, is the heart of the movie.  Each of the film’s two marquee names has a melodramatic set piece. Ms. Berry essentially reprises the kind of hysterical meltdown she performed in “Monster’s Ball,” which won her an Oscar as much for her nerve in becoming unstrung during sex as for her acting. This time her character is well-to-do, and no sex is involved.  Audrey is a typical Halle Berry character: a tense, tightly wound woman who regards the world with a wary, fearful hostility; hysteria lurks just under the surface. Even when she smiles, which is not often, her good mood is guarded. Ms. Berry’s beauty is at odds with her character’s seeming asexuality, which is why Audrey’s lovey-dovey moments with Brian feel perfunctory.  Jerry, by default, finds himself the children’s surrogate father, and the movie makes much of these cute kids’ small eccentricities and phobias: Harper’s secret habit of sneaking off to watch black-and-white films in a revival house with Brian, Dory’s fear of swimming in water over his head. As the children grow to trust and rely on Jerry, Audrey increasingly resents him, and she eventually throws him out of the house for presuming to usurp Brian’s role, although he has not presumed anything.  Jerry has his own midmovie meltdown when, suddenly homeless, he goes on a heroin bender and then, with the help of Audrey and her brother Neal (Omar Benson Miller), kicks drugs in a groaning and sweating ordeal as flashy as Frank Sinatra’s cold-turkey withdrawal in “The Man With the Golden Arm.”  Although neither Ms. Berry nor Mr. Del Toro can be faulted in their scenery-chewing moments, these star turns make you uncomfortably aware that they are Oscar-conscious auditions for the Big Prize. Their naked ambition subtly contaminates a movie that, despite its fine acting, has the emotional impact of a general anesthetic.  “Things We Lost in the Fire” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, drug taking and strong language.

A live-wire performance by Benicio Del Toro sparks an otherwise morose study of loss, addiction and catharsis in "Things We Lost in the Fire." First American feature from Danish helmer Susanne Bier intermittently finds ways to provide a fresh approach to conventional themes, but in the long run can't escape the limited dramatic options inherent in its story of the growing bond between a bereaved widow and the junkie who was her late husband's best friend. Modest B.O. looms.
There's nothing to suggest that Bier, known internationally for such films as "Open Hearts," "Brothers" and "After the Wedding," had to compromise her style in order to work in Hollywood; to the contrary, she was fortunate to find some strong collaborators, particularly Del Toro and producer/project godfather Sam Mendes, on both sides of the camera.
How effective that style is remains another matter, however. From the beginning, her Dogma-derived handheld camera is constantly darting hither and yon, probing to find the right angle and only sporadically succeeding. From an aesthetic standpoint, the visual results, in terms of composition, desaturated color schemes and mood, are not especially entrancing.
At the wake for the husband of Audrey Burke (Halle Berry), one man doesn't quite fit in with the upscale crowd at her elegant Seattle-area home. He's the oddly scruffy Jerry Sunborne (Del Toro), who reveals he grew up with the deceased, Brian Burke (David Duchovny).
As flashbacks soon disclose, Brian visited Jerry at the latter's flophouse lodgings on his birthday before impulsively intervening in a domestic dispute and being senselessly shot to death.
Brian's murder doesn't just devastate Audrey but effectively paralyzes her; entirely unprepared for being on her own and raising her 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, she simply doesn't know what to do, although she gets a bit of help from her brother Neal (Omar Benson Miller). In her emotionally frozen condition, she tracks down Jerry at a methadone clinic and invites him to stay at her home, where he can do a little work on the side.
Trying to stay clean, Jerry attends group therapy meetings, where he attracts the interest of another recovering addict, Kelly (Alison Lohman). But, sure enough, he relapses, then endures a grueling withdrawal as Jerry and Audrey fall into a relationship of mutual dependency, relying on one another to get through the most difficult periods of their respective lives.
Emotional core of Allan Loeb's original screenplay is thoroughly legitimate and, fortunately, does not go the silly route of proposing a potential romance for the two lost souls who bond over their mutual closeness with the same man. Dialogue is strictly functional, however, and the characters remain essentially one-dimensional; very little is ever revealed about protags' pasts, interests or what brought them to this point. Pic's concern is all in the moment.
To this end, the one player who genuinely seems to live in the moment and can bring it alive is Del Toro. Drug addict characters famously provide abundant possibilities for the sort of intense emoting actors love, and while Del Toro doesn't avoid this entirely, he captivates by often going the other way, expressing a certain lightness and humor that cuts against expectations. You never doubt Jerry is hooked, but Del Toro's charm and behavioral variety provide the man with more dimension than is provided on the page.
Another performance that elicits more than meets the eye comes from Lohman, who has very little to work with but strongly imprints her character's resolve and positive outlook.
Perhaps partly because Audrey is so dumbstruck by the hand fate has dealt her, Berry can't develop the character beyond the obvious signposts. Plausibly enough, she seems ghostly and vacant much of the time, and not very interesting in the bargain. Even more simplistic is Duchovny's Brian, who is positioned as just short of saintly as a husband, friend and ill-advised do-gooder.
In line with Bier's preference for handheld, often multiple camera coverage and lots of jump cutting, tech quality is on the raw side by Hollywood standards.
