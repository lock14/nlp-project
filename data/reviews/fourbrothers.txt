Considering that its principals are models, rappers, and model-rappers � and given that it�s scripted by a freshman and the writer of The Watcher
 (Paul Lovett and David Elliot, respectively) � you might not expect much from this late-summer actioner, which is neither fast nor furious and is set in snowbound Detroit. (Though the snow is clean because what you see is mainly Toronto.) You�d be mistaken. The movie takes its time warming barstools and playing pick-up hockey, heavy on the hip-checks, in an attempt to establish Singleton�s characteristic dude-like neighborhood vibe, but it gets cooking all right, transforming into a surprisingly hardy revenge yarn. At its best this is grade-A pulp from the land of Elmore Leonard: cops on the take, informers flung out of housing-project windows and left broken-boned on the sidewalk, Marvin Gaye and Grover Washington Jr. on the soundtrack, car chases with disco strings and rusty American clunkers plowing through blizzard conditions. The humor is offhand and more effective than you�d think; the running gag is that the local crime boss (Ejiofor) and his toadies are family men. They humiliate a squealer by banishing him to the kids� table (the setting is Thanksgiving), and a Volvo SUV stars in a sweet action set-piece that kicks the movie into gear. Also a family are the film�s vigilantes � Wahlberg, Gibson, the former Andr� 3000, and Hedlund � all grown-up brothers adopted in their youth by a nice old lady (Fionnula Flanagan) recently murdered in a bodega robbery. The conceit occasions some truly dreadful flashbacks, and the brothers are but a shade different from one another (pun intended). In the movie�s biggest reach, poor Hedlund has been cast as a perpetually aspiring rock star � Billy Idol with Buster Poindexter�s hair � and he looks completely at sea. We gather he�s gay because Wahlberg is always teasing him about fellatio and hands him a tire tool instead of a shotgun when the brothers go into battle. Meanwhile, the family�s squarejohn (Benjamin) appears to us in overalls and plaid flannel. There�s nothing sophisticated about the story, in other words. This is the kind of scrappy Seventies-throwback B-movie that fits the bill when you desperately need to see regular-seeming, occasionally inept people rise up against our corrupt criminal oppressors and cudgel them with pool cues and bits of blasted-off brick. Certainly you don�t need me to tell you this is not for children, but there were a few in the audience, and I�ll bet they were scarred as I was by Death Wish
.


If you haven't figured out that "Four Brothers," the new John Singleton film, is an intentionally scrappy throwback to mid-'70s action flicks, the scene in which the Mercer brothers' childhood home is shot up by gangsters should set you straight. As wood splinters go flying, windows shatter, and cherished framed photos bite the dust, Singleton treats us to a shot of a vintage vinyl record player shuddering in its death throes. Have these villains no shame?
On one level, "Four Brothers" represents a distinct comedown for the director of the socially conscious "Boyz N the Hood" and "Baby Boy" and producer of the art-house hit "Hustle & Flow." It's not even as slick as his 2000 remake of "Shaft" or his perfunctory sequel duties on "2 Fast 2 Furious." A nominal inner-city rehash of the 1965 John Wayne western "The Sons of Katie Elder," "Brothers" is a faux-low-budget revenge thriller, pure and simple. There's nothing special about it, and that's what's refreshing.
Set against a snaky, ear-tickling backdrop of Motown hits and Philly soul classics, "Four Brothers" starts with a little old lady (Fionnula Flanagan of "The Others") getting gunned down during a convenience store holdup in her ratty Detroit neighborhood. It turns out Evelyn Mercer was a social worker with a history of adopting worst-case delinquents no one else would touch; now this multiracial crew is all grown up and ready to settle scores with Mom's killer.
Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) is the oldest and de facto leader, blowing into town with all sorts of ill winds at his back. Angel (model/rapper/R&B balladeer Tyrese Gibson) is ex-Army and ex-prison. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin, a.k.a. Andre 3000 of OutKast) is the good son, married with kids and holding a job. Youngest brother Jack (Garrett Hedlund, "Friday Night Lights") is a wannabe rock musician and jittery basket case. The four quickly realize Mom's death was no random murder but an intentional hit.
I could tell you where the plot goes from there but what's the point? "Four Brothers" goes into B-movie lockdown as soon as everyone is assembled, and the action spreads out to take in a crooked local councilman (played by the wonderful, phlegmatic character actor Barry Shabaka Henley), a sympathetic cop ("Hustle & Flow" star Terrence Howard), a less sympathetic cop (nerdy Josh Charles of "Sports Night," snarling with abandon), and a crime kingpin dandy named Victor Sweet (surprise -- it's that nice British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor of "Dirty Pretty Things" and "Love Actually"). Sweet's such a nasty piece of work that not only does he force a henchman (Jernard Burks) to get on the floor and eat like a dog -- he makes the henchman's girlfriend do the same.
Well, it's a man's man's man's man's world, to quote the one R&B chestnut not
 on the film's soundtrack. Taraji P. Henson, one of the best things in "Hustle & Flow," is wasted in the tiny part of Jeremiah's wife, while Sofia Vergara does what she can with her crazy-hot-tamale role of Angel's girlfriend. To be fair, "Four Brothers" is mostly a leading man's world, since Hedlund and Benjamin have little to do, Gibson preens, and Wahlberg wraps what's left of the movie around his pinky and twirls it with bad-boy relish. If anyone still wonders if the kid has star quality, trust me -- he has.
What "Four Brothers" doesn't have is particularly skilled direction. Grubby to look at and edited with a rusty knife, it's a bumptious, low-rent ride and further proof that Singleton, for all his status and acclaim, doesn't have impressive filmmaking chops. The movie's strengths are in its juicy performances, unapologetic mayhem, and the few change-ups thrown by David Elliot and Paul Lovett's script (love that showdown on a frozen Lake Michigan, by the way), not in the verities of camera placement, narrative pacing, and so forth. Don't get me wrong -- this is solid meat-and-potatoes stuff. But Singleton may want us to think he's stooping to conquer, when it really feels like he has finally found his level.


         "Four Brothers" is a typically energetic urban action melodrama, offering car chases, beatings, murders, a dog mauling, attempted arson, frequent double-crosses and pitched street battles worthy of Fallouja. But what's not on the screen turns out to be more interesting than what is.
 
  Although director John Singleton is no stranger to studio productions — his "2 Fast 2 Furious" grossed more than $200 million worldwide — "Four Brothers" shows signs around the edges that he wishes there were other ways to make movies in today's Hollywood than orchestrating a reign of terror.
 


         






    The kind of film whose entire story arc fits neatly into its nine-word tag line — "They came home to bury mom ... and her killer" — "Four Brothers" opens with the death of said mom, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), gunned down during a holdup at a Detroit convenience store.
 
  A specialist in helping troubled kids find adoptive homes, someone who sanctioned tattoos but drew the line at elbows on the table, Evelyn singled out the four worst cases she came across for adoption herself. It's this multiracial quartet that gathers for her funeral and, if need be, a little bloody revenge.
 
  Leader of the pack is Bobby (a forceful Mark Wahlberg), once known as "The Michigan Mauler," the kind of ex-con, someone says, who was not let out early for good behavior. The middle brothers are Angel (Tyrese Gibson of Singleton's "Baby Boy"), the ladies' man of the quartet, and Jeremiah (Outkast's Andre Benjamin), who stayed in Detroit, worked for a union and has dreams of helping with urban renewal.
 
  The youngster of the bunch is Jack, a would-be rocker played by Garrett Hedlund, a long way from his debut as the comely Patroclus opposite Brad Pitt's Achilles in "Troy." He is also the object of some sour and savage teasing — all in good fun, you understand — about his putative homosexuality that is one of the several unpleasant touches in the film's David Elliot-Paul Lovett script.
 
  The brothers otherwise share an affectionate camaraderie, and even if they are not model citizens, says police Lt. Green (an underutilized Terrence Howard), "they're congressmen compared to what would have been."
 
  Congressmen or not, the brothers soon come to believe, as did the brothers in this film's progenitor, the John Wayne-starring "The Sons of Katie Elder," that the death of their parent was not what it seemed. Much mayhem follows, as does the introduction of "Dirty Pretty Things' " Chiwetel Ejiofor as local hard guy Victor Sweet.
 
  Clearly, no one held a gun to Singleton's head, so to speak, to take on this material, but there are signs that violence alone is not enough for him. "Four Brothers" takes some pains to add an emotional overlay to the proceedings, to connect, albeit roughly, with the notion that a character's humanity can be part of the on-screen equation.
 
  Admittedly burned by the failure of his earnest, socially conscious "Rosewood," Singleton is clearly happy to be able to direct the kind of broad stroke action films that parallel the westerns he's talked about enjoying as a kid. But if he could find a halfway point between the failed seriousness of "Rosewood" and the pulpiness of "Four Brothers," a point not unlike his Oscar-nominated debut, "Boyz N the Hood," perhaps he and his audience would be happier still.

Granted, as a white woman over 25, I'm not the intended core audience for Four Brothers . Still, I refuse to believe I'm a completely dispensable slice of the projected demographic pie. After all, I've got an abiding affection for the wily chameleon Mark Wahlberg, who stars; a building excitement about charismatic André Benjamin from OutKast, who made such an electrifying acting turn in Be Cool  and who costars; and a scholarly interest in the quick rise and stalled artistic development of John Singleton, who directs. So I think I have a right to ask: Why is Four Brothers  so cheesy? Why does it look like junk? Why are the lines so oafish, the scenes so sloppily pasted together, and the characters so false? Why is the action overrun with ugly gun violence, automotive wreckage, and death; why is the conversation drenched in casual, jokey homophobia and racism? And why does such cut-rate stuff  a diminution of everything important Singleton achieved 14 years ago with his riveting debut, Boyz N the Hood   get by, shrugged off as just another diversion meant for a rowdy summertime crowd who doubtless think I'm a twit for raising such dowdy objections?
Why is Four Brothers  considered good enough  by John Singleton's own standards? (He also produced, but didn't direct, the more capably made but equally inauthentic Hustle & Flow , another sentimentalized retreat from the hard honesty of Boyz .)
Hold that thought and consider the preposterous premise: The Mercer siblings themselves are an artificially constructed Detroit family, two white brothers and two black, brought together as unwanted foster kids by their feisty, saintly adoptive mother, Evelyn Mercer (Irish stage stalwart Fionnula Flanagan, assuming a stance of theatrical working-class rectitude often played by Lynn Redgrave), who raised her boys in a house of good manners that didn't stop them from getting into trouble. Evelyn is as present and nurturing a parent as Tre Styles' mama wasn't in Boyz . And now Evelyn is dead, gunned down in an apparent grocery store holdup.
But when the grieving orphans  now men  reunite in their Detroit boyhood home for her funeral, they smell something fishy about the story given by cops Green (Terrence Howard from Hustle & Flow  in a thanklessly contrived role) and Fowler (Josh Charles, in a role even worse) to explain the shooting. So they decide to investigate themselves, and dispense a little justice, Mercer brothers style. The trail of evidence leads to gang goons, drug scum, rotten cops, crooked politicians, whorish women, Neanderthal contract killers, a wack Detroit gangster in a pouffy fur jacket (fine British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor from Love Actually ), and a lot of catchy Motown music thrown in to pump soundtrack sales.
It's no accident that it has taken until now in this review to bother mentioning Wahlberg's work as tough-guy big brother Bobby; or Tyrese Gibson (a photogenic fave of the director's who also appeared in Singleton's 2 Fast 2 Furious ) as Angel, a stud with the unslakable hots for girlfriend Sofi (Sofia Vergara), dubbed ''La Vida Loca'' by the rest of the family for her flights of Hispanic hotheadedness; or an undervalued Benjamin as Jeremiah, a business-minded husband and father; or Troy  pretty boy Garrett Hedlund as Jack, a fawn-like rock musician the other sibs enjoy tormenting with tedious slurs questioning his sexuality. Built from a studio kit of ''types,'' face-recognition factors, and market-penetration charts, this fraternal quartet has all the believability of the Village People. And Wahlberg, with hair slicked back like a car salesman's, and face lined with ennui, looks particularly recycled, more of a Pops trying to hang on to his glory days than a Number One Son.
Because the script, riddled with verbal ugliness by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, sends the movie to a series of arbitrary nowheres, the final showdown for the Mercer boys and their enemies is just as meaningless and sense-deadening. Get past the scene in a fake-swank restaurant where an insubordinate gang lieutenant and a random ho are forced to eat off the floor, rumps in the air, and you end up at a frozen-over fishing hole where the film pauses to peddle a crackpot message of labor-union solidarity. There is no Hood in Four Brothers , and no Boyz, either  just Hollywood Men at Work, risking nothing for an audience that isn't supposed to mind.

 The director John Singleton knows about desolation. In his atmospheric, propulsive and ultimately preposterous melodrama, "Four Brothers," the pictures of snow drifting over a decrepit Detroit neighborhood in the post-Thanksgiving gloom can put a lump in your throat, especially because  these images are associated with the murder of a saintly mother figure. Add some faded holiday decorations along with the plaintive cry of Marvin Gaye's "Trouble Man," and you have a mood of cosmic sadness laced with fear and loathing.  That maternal angel, gentle, gray-haired Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), is shot to death just before Thanksgiving in a convenience-store robbery moments after she has persuaded a youngster to give back the candy bar he has just stolen. The movie is discreet enough not to show the killing directly. The camera gallantly retreats to the sidewalk, from which we see the flashes of gunfire inside and know immediately what has happened. That's the last time this gleefully amoral vigilante movie shows any such discretion.  In short order, Evelyn's four adopted sons, two of them white and two black, gather in their childhood home, and the movie kicks into violent action. Swaggering, trigger-happy Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) is newly released from prison. He is joined by Angel (Tyrese Gibson), a former marine, who quickly hooks up with an ex-girlfriend (Sofia Vergara); Jeremiah (André Benjamin), a former union organizer now married with two children and dabbling in real estate; and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), a would-be punk rocker and the movie's least developed character, whom Bobby affectionately dubs "the little fairy."  Reuniting in the house where they grew up, the foster brothers shed collective tears of grief (to the sounds of the Temptations' "I Wish It Would Rain"), and agree that being rescued by Evelyn from the foster-care system saved them from much worse fates. Or as the movie's one likable cop, Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard), a childhood friend who knew them way back when, says, compared to what they might have become without Evelyn's devotion, the four are "congressmen."  Not quite, as it turns out. Goaded by Bobby over a subdued Thanksgiving dinner, they vow to avenge her murder without police assistance. The movie's notion of law and order belongs strictly to the Dodge City school of urban street justice. The sadness dissipates into gore. As their investigation accelerates, their loathsome sleuthing techniques include disrupting a basketball game by running onto the court waving guns, dousing a car with gasoline and threatening the driver with incineration, and cutting the rope of a man dangling from a building.  "Four Brothers," directed by Mr. Singleton from a screenplay by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, bears a distant resemblance to Henry Hathaway's 1965 western, "The Sons of Katie Elder," in which four brothers, led by John Wayne and Dean Martin, return to their hometown of Clearwater, Tex., after the deaths of their parents. Here, Mr. Wahlberg, at his most menacing and cheerfully psychopathic, has the Wayne role of head gunslinger.  The movie is a shrewd  hybrid of traditional western and modern blaxploitation movies, with vintage Motown hits supplying pungent nostalgic whiffs from the "Shaft" and "Superfly" era while undercurrents of hip-hop keep it up to date.  On the western front, the shabby Detroit neighborhood makes a nifty urban stand-in for a ramshackle frontier town, and the frozen snow-covered surface of what could be Lake Erie is as empty as any wind-swept plain. Late in the film, thugs wielding chainsaws prepare a wintry grave by cutting a hole in the ice; moments later, a lone gunman strides slowly into view for a final reckoning amid a cluster of hulking black automobiles.  "Four Brothers" has an elaborate plot, whose elements are unsatisfactorily pieced together between action sequences. The brothers determine that Evelyn's death was a contract killing involving a life-insurance payoff, a real-estate scam and corrupt city officials and police officers beholden to Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an evil über-thug. Among other stunts, this convincingly scary gangster enjoys humiliating underlings and their girlfriends by dumping their dinners on the floor of his restaurant and making them grovel for their food on hands and knees.  The movie suspends storytelling for several superbly coordinated action sequences, including a slippery car chase over icy streets and a machine-gun invasion of the Mercer home that shows it to be as porous as a cardboard box. But as sleekly directed and edited as it may be, "Four Brothers" is really made of the same flimsy material.  "Four Brothers" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has abundant profanity, gore and sexual situations.

With equal measures of rock-the-house vigor and in-your-face attitude, "Four Brothers" proves usually potent and consistently enjoyable as an old school approach to what might best be described as the urban-Western genre of slam-bang, balls-out action-revenger. The tasty soundtrack of wall-to-wall Motown golden oldies is only the most obvious indication that helmer John Singleton has blaxploitation homage on his mind. Even so, pic is refreshingly free of wink-wink allusions and self-referential ironies. Paramount release should make some late-summer B.O. noise as crowd-pleasing, down-and-dirty melodrama spiked with profanely funny sass. Homevid biz will be equally muscular. 
Movie buffs may suspect scripters David Elliot and Paul Lovett are tipping their Stetsons to Henry Hathaway's "The Sons of Katie Elder" (1965) with a plot that pivots on four disparate and disreputable siblings who reunite to avenge a parent's murder. But similarities to the earlier pic are more apparent than real, and they are forgotten entirely as soon as tough-loving Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) is fatally shot during what initially seems like a random grocery holdup.
Effectively introed to the sound of Marvin Gaye's soulfully swaggering "Trouble Man," grim-faced ex-con Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) returns to wintry inner-city Detroit for the funeral of his beloved adoptive mother. Sad occasion reunites Bobby with his three brothers -- hunky ex-Marine Angel (Tyrese Gibson), family man and former union activist Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and punkish hard-rocker Jack (Garrett Hedlund) -- who also were raised by Evelyn.
Except for one or two genuinely funny gags, Singleton wisely refrains from making a big deal out of the fact that two brothers are African-American (Angel, Jeremiah) and two Caucasian (Bobby, Jack). Pic places more emphasis on brothers' common background as throwaway delinquents who were rescued from foster-care system by Evelyn. (A nice touch: Evelyn's generosity of spirit is seriocomically credited to her youthful hippiedom.)
To be sure, the boys didn't exactly grow into untarnished, sterling citizens. But according to Lt. Green (Terrence Howard), a childhood buddy turned Detroit cop, "These kids are congressmen compared to what they could have been" without Evelyn.
Determined to answer blood with blood, the Mercer brothers rightly figure they're better equipped than the cops to track their mother's killers. It doesn't take them long to discover the robbery wasn't random and to deduce the robbers were hired killers employed by Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a sadistic mobster with dirty cops on his payroll and a personal interest in Jeremiah's business plans.
Clocking in at a tight 108 minutes, pic feels neither dawdling nor unduly rushed. Singleton is unafraid to slow the tempo for scenes like a character-revealing Thanksgiving dinner (brightened with a bold touch of magical realism).
But when Singleton kicks out the jams during the hard-core rough stuff -- especially during a slipping-and-sliding car chase during a snowstorm, and a full-out assault on the Mercer home -- helmer delivers the goods with edgy kinetic flair. Editors Bruce Cannon and Billy Fox do standout work, and nothing ever gets too hyped, too abstract, too videogamish. Much like this year's "Assault on Precinct 13" remake, "Four Brothers" makes a virtue of blunt, brawny '70s-style simplicity.
Much of pic's appeal stems from terrifically engaging interplay among four well-cast leads. Wahlberg scores as an insolent hothead who's much smarter and more sentimental than he wants to appear. Gibson (of Singleton's "Baby Boy" and "2 Fast 2 Furious") strikes apt balance between smooth moves as lover (with sexy co-star Sofia Vergara) and brute force as avenger. OutKast hip-hopper Benjamin continues to demonstrate strong acting chops, while up-and-comer Hedlund ("Troy," "Friday Night Lights") makes a vivid impression as youngest sibling who's still the butt of merciless ribbing.
Standout supporting players include two alumni of Singleton-produced "Hustle & Flow" -- attention-grabbing Howard and vulnerable Taraji P. Henson (as Jeremiah's wife) -- and Brit-born Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Dirty Pretty Things"), totally convincing as a Detroit gangster who rules through intimidation and humiliation. Flanagan makes the most of flashback scenes.
Overall tech package suggests mid-range budget was spent smartly to achieve rough-hewn but not slipshod look during location shooting in Detroit and Toronto. Motown hits are used extensively and often expressively. At the very end, "Trouble Man" is reprised to achieve ineffably melancholy mood.

John Singleton 's Four Brothers  begins life with the premise and promise of a realistic post-noir, set in the contemporary Detroit wastelands and revolving around an outrageously unjust murder and subsequent family vendetta. But we quickly lapse into telescoping condescension when the saintly gray-haired Mom (Fionnula Flanagan ) is introduced giving a pre-teen shoplifter a dose of crinkly-eyed tough lovethe tone and dialogue are strictly Aaron Spelling . After she's shot by holdup men, we arrive at her wake and meet not only her four adopted sons, but two cops (Terrence Howard  and Josh Charles ) providing bullhorn exposition for them as we go. There's Bobby (Mark Wahlberg ), a violent-tempered, exhockey star "fuckup"; Angel (Tyrese Gibson ), an ex-hustler, ex-marine "fuckup"; Jack (Garrett Hedlund ), a would-be-musician "fuckup"; and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin ), the local family man and, evidently, not as prone to fucking up. Adopting them from the hundreds of foster kids she helped because no one else would, Flanagan's Mom was 100 percent saint, and the sons are now looking for vengeance.
What results is unremarkably schizophrenichalf gritty sojourn into the inner-city furnace, half Hollywood  brain death. The mystery unravels in obscure clumps, the climactic plot to trounce the villains (mainly Chiwetel Ejiofor , growling and yowling like a Batman villain) is so cleverly arrived at off-camera, and no emotional moment leaves the screen without being pounded like beefsteak. (The Motown landscape is formidable, even if it was shot mostly in Toronto.) But Four Brothers  has odder incongruities than even the casting of nebbishy Charles as a scary-tough dirty coplike the idiotic way our heroes sleuth out the story's mystery by executing, or trying to kill, anyone who might be able to answer their questions. That the script jokes about it, and then absolves the brothers by ensuring after the fact that their victims deserved to be whacked, casts an awkward chill over our sympathies.
More's the pity, because Singleton and his actors try to capture the brothers' antagonistic camaraderie in real termsteasings, fights, a sense of shared historyand more often than not the cast is up to the task. Benjamin and Gibson are thoroughly relaxed, and even the winsomely pale Hedlund, forgotten already as a whining Patroclus in Troy  , seems to fit into this family's motley scheme. But the script is too cheesy, too much of a school yard knee jerk toward pointless gunplay and Inspirational Deaths to leave it at thatimagine what a little earthquake the movie would have been if it had. With Shaft , 2 Fast 2 Furious , and Four Brothers , Singleton has essentially outed himself as the formulaic pulp hack he's been since Boyz n the Hood , rather than the South Central wunderkind Hollywood took him for.
