It�s a shame that the final film from MGM, which has just been bought by Sony, is this routine remake of a 1979 horror classic. Although the original Amityville Horror
 represents no great triumph of style or acting, it is an effective little tingler whose frights are steady, implied, and cumulative: We don�t see the things that go bump in the night so much as hear, feel, and sense them. In both films, the intrepid Lutz family (mother, stepfather, three kids, and a dog) purchase a house in which grisly murders occurred the year before, and in both films it takes 28 days before the family runs screaming from its dream home. In the original the scares and odd events are incremental and sometimes possible to explain away, but in the remake the frights are such that you�re wondering why the stubborn Lutzes don�t flee after the first night. Obviously, the filmmakers were keen to remake this film exactly because the technological advances of the last 25 years now permit more graphic displays of horrific imaginings and computer enhancements that can render the invisible world visible. Strategically, the new Amityville
 never intended to go for the subtler, implied horror of the original; this one would be all about scaring the pants off viewers. And in this, the movie generally succeeds as sudden scares and flashes of yucky imagery cause audience members to yelp aloud as if on cue. The real unifying aspect of the new film is producer Michael Bay, who also produced 2003�s Texas Chainsaw Massacre
 remake, which also was heavily promoted as being "based on a true story," and was populated with fresh-faced TV newcomers and directed by former advertising whizzes. That the "truths" supporting both films belong more to the realm of urban legend than historical fact seems to be a Bay constant, as is his tendency to favor shock-and-awe narrative techniques over quiet wonder (see Armageddon
 and Pearl Harbor
 for examples). Stars Reynolds and George (almost the spitting image of Sandy Dennis) are serviceably good as the young married couple tossed from their moorings, but they function mostly as buff figures to be moved around in service of the next set-piece or scare. (And know that some of the images are disturbingly graphic; for example, this: a finger forcibly pushed down to the knuckle into a bullet hole through a head.) Aside from the visual differences between the two Amityville
s, the other main divergence has to do with the theme of rationalism vs. spiritualism. In both cases, the Lutzes are rationalists who get their new home for a great price and are able to make sense of all the peculiar goings-on since they moved in. Yet, a Catholic priest is introduced only in the last third of the new movie, while he is front and center in the first. The original Amityville
 should be seen in terms of a string of Seventies haunted house movies that began in 1968 at the Dakota apartments with Rosemary�s Baby
 and goes through The Exorcist
 and The Tenant
 before morphing into the effects-driven model of the Eighties with Poltergeist
. The most irritating aspect of the new movie, however, has nothing to do with comparisons but rather with some of the inherent illogic of the story. Why are we seeing images of a hanged girl when we know she�s been shot in the head? Images seem to be grafted into the film that have little to do with the actual story. Maybe it�s a technique that succeeds within quick advertising spots, but it piles confusion onto the art of storytelling.


''The Amityville Horror" is the latest cannibalization of a popular older horror film. But the movie that this remake is dining on wasn't fresh to begin with, so the new version appears to be suffering a terrible case of botulism.
Set in 1979, it's an incompetent retread of the equally inane 1979 hit. This time out, the intense comedic actor Ryan Reynolds turns nuts as George Lutz, a construction company owner with a grizzly beard, who sinks his savings into a hulking Long Island manor. He and his wife, Kathy (Melissa George), move in with their three kids, despite being told that the house may have driven a young man to shoot his entire family the year before.
The house, naturally, is haunted, in particular by a pallid little mischief-maker named Jodie, who could have crawled out of the well in ''The Ring." The youngest daughter of the previous occupants and the last to die, she becomes the imaginary friend of the Lutzes' girl, Chelsea (Chloe Grace Moretz). In Jodie's thrall, Chelsea locks the lusty stoner baby sitter in the closet and, later, climbs way up onto the roof of the house and tries to leap off. That's a ludicrous scene, but hardly the only one.
George, meanwhile, grows obsessed with his work in the basement (which amounts to sleeping on a sofa near the furnace) and becomes visibly annoyed with Kathy and the kids -- they're only his stepchildren. And they're all so child-actor precocious that you can hardly blame him. At 3:15 every morning (the time of the original murders), George awakes to find mayhem on the property. It's only a matter of scenes until he falls under the house's murderous spell and goes bats on his family.
Not content to remake an old, mediocre horror movie, this ''Amityville" takes its cues from current mediocre horror movies, too. This one is frightening only if you can't remember the last throwaway movie that leaned on all the same tricks. ''Amityville," whose makers swear it's actually based on the ''Amityville" book and a ''true story," employs the usual shorthand of nasty montages that stand in both for exposition and for the characters' points of view and move at express-train speed.
Andrew Douglas is the director of this new version (the action-director Michael Bay is the producer). Like every youngish hack stationed in the Siberia of Hollywood Horrorville, Douglas brings the noise and the dollar-bin ''gotcha" moments but is painfully ignorant of the craft of building suspense. Instead, we get a lot of dreary atmosphere and speaker-bruising effects. Still, Reynolds, in his increasing insanity, eventual ax-wielding, and frequent shirtlessness, is fun -- the kind of fun that boldly suggests a remake of ''The Shining" instead.
That's smart. The original ''Amityville," with James Brolin and Margot Kidder, was no prize. It failed both tests of decent horror from that period, being neither scary nor successfully allegorical. Was the movie about bad Catholics, white guilt about American Indians (don't ask), or the perils of home ownership? And what exactly was wrong
 with that house? The movie felt itself desperately under the influence of other horror films of its time, namely ''Rosemary's Baby," ''The Exorcist," and ''The Omen." It did have an outrageous saving grace, though: Rod Steiger as a priest, a psychotherapist, and a thunderous over-actor. But even that was shameful.
Had the remake gotten its act together and its story straight, an overhaul of the original could have been something worth tolerating. Oh, well.


         On Nov. 13, 1974, a young man named Ronald DeFeo Jr. went berserk in the middle of the night and shot dead his parents and four younger siblings in their Dutch Colonial home in the peaceful Long Island community of Amityville. A year later a young couple, George and Kathy Lutz, and their three children moved into the house only to flee it 28 days later, never to return, even to collect their possessions. What happened to the Lutzes in that 28 days was turned into a bestselling book, "The Amityville Horror," by Jay Anson, which spawned a popular picture of the same name in 1979, which in turn led to two sequels.
 
  "The Amityville Horror" has now been remade, and it is decidedly superior to the original. Directed by Andrew Douglas, a commercials veteran, the film is a terrific scare show, fast and furious, made with a lot of style and energy, packing plenty of jolts yet never lingering morbidly over horrific images. It is anchored in strong characterizations, and its plot develops with chilling psychological suspense. It's such a skillfully made entertainment that its plunge into the supernatural is persuasive even for the skeptical. Some words of warning are in order: The film is unsuitable for children.
 


         






    Working from Anson's book as well as Sandor Stern's script for the 1979 version, writer Scott Kosar sets up the story with care. George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) is a new husband and stepfather to the three children of his wife, Kathy (Melissa George). They are a loving couple, and George is eager to make a good husband and stepfather. He connects easily enough with little Chelsea (Chloë Grace Moretz) and Michael (Jimmy Bennett) but realizes that 12-year-old Billy (Jesse James) will be a challenge.
 
  When George and Kathy come upon a large seaside Victorian on a huge forest-like lot, a rundown but splendid example of the Dutch Colonial Revival style, they find it hard to resist. No fool, George asks the real estate agent how the price could be so low, and she is forthright about the DeFeo family tragedy. Because George is a contractor able to fix up the place himself, and Kathy is so taken with it, they decide it's a unique opportunity. "People kill people; houses don't kill people," says George firmly, determined to put the house's dark past behind him and his family.
 
  Had George and Kathy done some poking around in the local library about the house, they would have surely thought more than twice about buying the place. In no time the Lutzes' dream turns into a nightmare, and what's in store for them is unspeakably worse than things merely going bump in the night.
 
  Horror pictures can be a real workout for actors, especially young ones, and "Amityville" makes heavy demands on its five principals. Reynolds depicts rigorously Lutz's descent from a loving family man into a lethally possessed creature, and George shows Kathy as a woman struggling in the face of escalating terror. Douglas clearly took extraordinary pains to ensure that his child actors felt secure while creating hair-raising events surrounding them. Rachel Nichols adds a moment of comic relief as a sexy, irresponsible baby sitter, and Philip Baker Hall plays a local priest overwhelmed by the horrendous happenings at the Dutch Colonial.
 
  The house is the film's central character, its steep roofs, soaring staircase and dank basement providing wonderfully moody and atmospheric settings for dynamic cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister, who heads the film's substantial list of skilled artists and craftsmen. With visual panache and consistent dexterity, "The Amityville Horror" confronts a completely normal, likable young family with a glimpse of hell.

n a world gone drearily mad with sequels and recycled television shows, it is merely rhetorical to ask why anyone, including the savvy part-time producer Michael Bay, would revisit a stinker like the 1979 flick "The Amityville Horror." The answer, of course, is that these days, even the dumbest horror movie scares up decent big-screen business before being shuttled off to DVD perpetuity. Just as crucial, horror is relatively cheap to churn out, especially when the supporting cast features interchangeable no-name guys and gals, and the real star of the show - in this case, a spacious waterfront Long Island house - doesn't require its own trailer, a piece of the gross or any of the usual perquisites. Still, given the crushing dullness of the first "Amityville Horror," it seems baffling that it had any traction at all. James Brolin, sporting a head and face full of Charles Manson fuzz, and a wild-eyed Margot Kidder play a couple who snap up a palatial Long Island house for a song. Like the audience, the lovebirds already know that their new digs are shrouded in murder and mystery, but what takes them an agonizingly long time to realize - despite all the miscellaneous creaking and escalating weirdness - is that the house is possessed. The movie was the kind of thing beloved by bored teenagers and recreational drug users, two occasionally overlapping demographics, and was followed by a clutch of sequels that mostly went straight to video. This latest visit to Long Island's favorite haunted house was co-produced by Mr. Bay, the director of such Jerry Bruckheimer-engineered blockbusters as "Armageddon," and directed by Andrew Douglas, whose only other credit is for the provocatively titled "Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus." Mr. Douglas takes an instrumental approach to the material, meaning he does what he can in as slickly commercial a fashion as possible. The writer this time is Scott Kosar, who also wrote Mr. Bay's equally serviceable remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and more interestingly, Brad Anderson's "Machinist." Mr. Kosar builds on the story arc of the first "Amityville," which shrouded a gruesome real-life multiple murder in a bunch of supernatural hooey, and predictably pumps up the gory violence. Don't get too attached to the family dog. Set in the 1970's, the new "Amityville" stars an effective Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz, the hirsute paterfamilias with an easy smile and an unsettling fondness for chopping wood. Melissa George plays his wife, a widow and mother of three who, having recently married again, is still trying to find the right fit for her young brood and her new man. Despite the jittery realty agent and an ugly stain marring a large swath of ceiling downstairs, and, oh yeah, the nasty revelation about the house being the site of a murderous family meltdown, the Dutch Colonial home looks like the American dream to the young couple. They take the homeowners' plunge, thereupon triggering various unfortunate events and, in time, a serious case of buyer's remorse. Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, the new "Amityville" marks a modest improvement over the original, partly because, from acting to bloody effects, it is better executed;  and partly because the filmmakers have downgraded the role of the priest, played in all his vein-popping glory by Rod Steiger in the first film and by a considerably more subdued Philip Baker Hall here. Oddly, with these improvements, the filmmakers have removed "Amityville" from the realm of kitsch, perhaps with unintended results. In 1974, when a Long Island man turned Amityville into a crime scene by killing his family, there was something so novel about this kind of tragedy that it could be spun into a pop-cultural myth. These days, with the tight real estate market, I realized I didn't care one bit about anyone making it out alive - I wanted the house. "The Amityville Horror" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains bloody violence, including gruesome images of torture and the murder of a family pet; some viewers may be disturbed by the family dynamics.

That most enduring of haunted-house hoaxes, "The Amityville Horror," returns in a remodeled version that -- like producer Michael Bay and screenwriter Scott Kosar's 2003 makeover of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" -- begins slavishly faithful to its low-key 1970s predecessor then sledgehammers auds with a numbing succession of shock edits and over-the-top horror effects. Which, as with "Chainsaw" (which grossed more than $100 million worldwide), won't dissuade the core audience of twentysomething yahoos and their nervous-Nellie girlfriends. They'll keep this sorry swan song for MGM scaring up profits for at least as long as the 28 days the Lutz family managed to tough it out at 112 Ocean Ave.
As evidenced by the muscular performances of "The Grudge" and "The Ring Two," the market for disposable horror fare is still far from its late-1980s level of overspeculation. And lacking a Japanese fright pic to remake, Hollywood seems content to turn back to its own catalog, with "Amityville" arriving on the heels of last year's "Dawn of the Dead" and just ahead of new versions of John Carpenter's "The Fog" and Roger Spottiswoode's "Terror Train."
"Amityville" has the added lure of purporting to be based on a true story -- that of George and Kathy Lutz, who moved into a bargain-priced Dutch Colonial house on the shores of Long Island, only to flee one month later, claiming their home was festooned with demons and other sinister forces.
Their story became the basis for author Jay Anson's bestselling 1977 book and the big-grossing 1979 American Intl. Pictures film (both credited as source material here) adapted from it. Although the Lutzes' claims were subsequently debunked as a crass attempt to exploit the brutal sextuple murder that had occurred in the house, the Amityville legend has proven an enduring pop-culture myth.
In director Andrew Douglas' retelling, Ryan Reynolds and "Alias" actress Melissa George (who bear strong physical resemblances to original "Amityville" stars James Brolin and Margot Kidder) are the newlyweds who arrive at 112 Ocean Ave. Clocking in at a brisk 89 minutes (a full half-hour shorter than the 1979 version), this "Amityville Horror" doesn't have time to waste manufacturing an air of home-sweet-home normalcy. Following introductory moments patterned virtually shot-for-shot on the original, Douglas ramps up the paranormal hooey, with creaking floorboards and mysterious shadows rapidly escalating into full-blown apparitions of dead children hanging from the ceiling.
In fairness, the original "Amityville Horror" (directed by Stuart Rosenberg) was far from a genre classic, and the remake actually improves upon it in certain respects. Smartly, screenwriter Kosar omits some of its more laughable episodes and adds a perilous rooftop encounter between the Lutzes and their young daughter, Chelsea (Chloe Grace Moretz), that is executed by Douglas with expert, palm-sweating intensity.
There's also less time wasted with extraneous secondary characters. In particular, the role of the town priest, played by Rod Steiger in the original and by Philip Baker Hall here, has been dramatically reduced.
But the original had a creepy ambiguity about the cause of the happenings and an ability to unsettle auds without the aid of digital imagery. Like the most affecting haunted house pics (the original "The Haunting," "Poltergeist"), it rooted its terrors in a distinctly domestic realm, achieving its tension by violating the presumed safety of ordinary household objects.
Kosar explicitly suggests that the haunting is the work of Jodie Defeo (Isabel Conner), the youngest victim of the massacre at the house. (Evidently, someone
 thought there weren't already enough movies in which the restless spirits of dead children torment the living.)
At the same time, Douglas ("Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus") buys wholesale into the more-is-more philosophy that may be dooming the future of Hollywood horror movies. Hence, a believable swarm of flies becomes an army of CG insects, young Chelsea's imaginary friend is no longer so imaginary, and the infamous "red room" in the Lutzes' basement becomes a cavernous series of tunnels and underground torture chambers. And, none of it is nearly as scary.
In her first major screen role, George, who isn't asked to do much more than scream and look petrified, does an acceptable job. Reynolds, playing against his stock-in-trade lighthearted comedy parts, is more convincing as the benevolent husband-father of pic's early passages than as the ax-wielding, Jack Torrance-like psycho he evolves into.
Tech credits are predictably solid, with the work of production designer Jennifer Williams and costume designer David Robinson particularly noteworthy -- they've hauled the fashions and fixtures of the 1970s out of a time capsule intact, from the mirror behind the Lutzes' bed to George Lutz's floral print shirts and tan leather blazer.

At long last love: Kutcher and Peet take forever to connect
A Lot Like Love  exemplifies the happiness-deferred romance, in which two friends-but-should-be-paramours repeatedly convene, separate, and reconvene over several years, finally staying together only after feature run-time has elapsed. Skimming through lonely stretches and careerist angst, the movie focuses on incidents that threaten the final hookup. But the chemistry between diaper salesman Ashton Kutcher  and photo hound Amanda Peet  is so off that the pairing scans as an alienation effectone enhanced by their age difference, as well as Peet's resemblance (in her goth, graduate-age New York scenes) to an unwaxed Demi Moore . The banter soon develops a rhythm: Hurting from a breakup, Peet gets too drunk to nuzzle and Kutcher doesn't complain; years later, on a car trip, Kutcher whines about his ex and Peet shrugs it off. Interjections from perennial second bananas Kathryn Hahn  (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ) and Kal Penn  (winning even when not conjuring vivified bags of pot) generate the only sparks.
