Things we learned from watching Jarhead
: War is not hell, war is purgatory, with sporadic excursions to the Delta House to Get This Party Started, Motherfucker; girlfriends/wives are not to be trusted, ever; the Iraqi desert looks sublime when Red Adair�s not in town; screenwriter William Broyles Jr. is still a pro at manufacturing gripping narratives out of men waiting for something, anything to happen (see also Apollo 13
). With Jarhead
, the director of American Beauty
 has adapted Anthony Swofford�s 2003 bestseller about his maddening stint with the Marines during the first Gulf war into an equally maddening movie that portrays Our Boys as either tentative heroes, forever on the cusp but never quite allowed to achieve greatness, or borderline psychotics, preprogrammed for mayhem that never arrives, and who then, consciously or unconsciously, turn the savagery of combat inward. This is a war film with precious little war, which was also the crux of Swofford�s book. So with none of Saddam Hussein�s elite Republican Guards even displaying the courtesy to show up to the fight, the Marines end up sitting around staging scorpion fights, "hydrating," masturbating, getting outrageously drunk, or worrying what their girls back home are doing (it appears most of them are banging the metaphoric mailman). Sublimation becomes the name of this grueling 112-degrees-in-the-shadelessness-game, and the 20-year-old Swofford (nicknamed Swoff), a sniper who never once gets to fire his rifle and nearly goes mad because of it, marks his days in a regimented schedule of nonevents. Their advance scout-and-sniper unit�s leader, Staff Sgt. Sykes (Fox) drills them mercilessly throughout boot camp and for kicks makes them play football in full chemical drag for the visiting media, but he�s no R. Lee Ermey. He confesses to Swoff that even though a cushy family job awaits him stateside, he�s chosen to stay in the desert because he loves the gig, which marks him as either mad or masochistic or, best bet, both. Swoff�s target acquisition partner, a quietly simmering enigma named Troy (Sarsgaard, easily the best thing about the film), at first seems to be the unit�s hovering conscience, but ends up, like everyone else, rocketing toward insanity by film�s end. To be fair, Operation Desert Storm�s ground war lasted a scant four days, with most of the John Wayne heroics (or massacres, depending on your point of view) going to the flyboys piloting the F/A-18 Hornets above, cutting the dusty grunts out of the picture entirely. Mendes� film sports a wealth of grimly beautiful imagery from the Coen brothers� regular cinematographer Roger Deakins � the plumes of smoke bursting skyward from the sabotaged oil wells; a shocking, eerie stretch of the infamous "highway of death" littered with the charred corpses of fleeing Iraqis; the crimson glow of a desert sunset � and its smooth, circuitous editing (from the great Walter Murch, whose work on the steadfastly anti-war Apocalypse Now
 is shown being watched by the Marines as an ironically inappropriate sort of machismo stimulant) moves with the deadly grace of a sandy, shifting dune. Jarhead
 fails to ignite much more than those crusty, luminous derricks, however, because it lacks any noticeable tone, political or otherwise; Swoff�s narrative viewpoint is chiefly one of impatience, and when bloodshed fails to materialize, the grunts react like children denied their candy. War not only dehumanizes, Mendes� film seems to be saying, it also infantilizes, reducing the semi-best and the not-quite-brightest to the level of squalling infants grubbing at high-powered pacifiers and making messes wherever they go. It�s not a pretty picture, but it is a lovely film.


''Jarhead" finally and powerfully comes into its own in the last 30 minutes. That's when Captain Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his fellow Marines realize that in the new techno-military fighting the 1991 Gulf War they are obsolete. Not expendable, not pawns,just . . . unnecessary. This unmans them far more than the enemy ever could. ''Are we evergonna get to kill
 anyone?" one platoon member wails, and that's the sound of a man brainwashed for the one task he isn't allowed to do.
War is hell, in case you hadn't heard, and hell in ''Jarhead" is other people -- that and lots of sand and boredom. Don't blame the Republicans or the Democrats, because they're thousands of miles away, and the primary directive in the desert, according to one character, is ''[expletive] politics." Sam Mendes's film is at least that true to Swofford's best-selling memoir, a story in which one expects the worst of everybody except one's fellow Marine, and even he had better be watched closely. The war itself? A shell game to protect the oil fields of the rich. That's a dirty shame, but there's still a job to do.
The bitter joke at the heart of the book was that Swofford and his scout/sniper platoon mates sat in the desert for months waiting to do something -- anything -- and that the conflict was over before they even had time to lock and load. All these men saw were dead bodies left behind by US bombing runs and oil wells lit by retreating Iraqis, burning into the night like giant, ecologically disastrous Bic lighters.
''Jarhead" gets the waiting, the worrying over faithless girlfriends and wives, and the deadly illogic of armed forces bureaucracy, but here's the problem -- so has every war movie of the past 30 years, and they had actual story lines. The film evokes ''Three Kings," ''Full Metal Jacket," ''Catch-22," and other touchstones of the genre without ever establishing its own identity. It's as if all the Vietnam flicks the Marines watch to jack themselves up for combat have leached into the movie's soul.
When Mendes (''American Beauty") does try something new, it backfires prodigiously. A boot-camp fatality early in ''Jarhead" is treated so cavalierly by Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) that you're kicked right out of the movie. In reality -- and ''Jarhead" does play by the nominal rules of reality, at least until the final act -- there would be an investigation, a possible court martial, and some nasty media coverage, much as there was in the case of the drowning death of Private Jason Tharp at Parris Island this past February. Here everyone shrugs and moves on to the next obstacle course. Call this what you will -- righteous anti-military indignation, left-wing propaganda, sloppy filmmaking -- it simply doesn't square.
Once the men of STA Platoon bunker down in Saudi Arabia, ''Jarhead" settles in for an extended tour of movie duty. We get to know the men: truculent, articulate Texan Kruger (Lucas Black); Fowler (Evan Jones) the racist idiot -- from Framingham!; family man Cortez (Jacob Vargas); Fergus the Kid (Brian Geraghty); and so forth. Sergeant Sykes is their chief protector and tormentor, and Foxx solidifies his triumph in ''Ray" with a sharp, unshowy piece of work. The sergeant's a lifer, with the survival instincts of a desert reptile, and any human kindness he shows may or may not be camouflage.
The main characters, however, are Gyllenhaal's Swofford and Peter Sarsgaard's Troy -- a narrator and his friend, spotter, and fellow sniper. To be painfully honest, I can imagine real Marines looking at these Hollywood boys and laughing themselves sick. The grousing and macho mind-games feel honest, as does the mordant comic despair when Sykes orders the men to play touch football for reporters -- in 112-degree heat, wearing full gas-attack protective gear. But Gyllenhaal's Swofford, a scowling intellectual drawn to war for emotional reasons, is more muddled on the screen than he was on the page, and Troy, ostensibly the toughest nut of them all, turns out to be the neediest. The miscast Sarsgaard suggests a gifted actor approximating a Marine but never the real thing.
When Operation Desert Storm begins, ''Jarhead" at last becomes its own movie, beholden to none before it. The sand dunes become pocked with death and the nights turn into brightly lit downpours of premium crude. The men lose their bearings as they stumble in the dark, oil soaking poisonously into their skins, and if that's the only parallel Mendes draws with the conflict we currently find ourselves in, it's enough. At one point, a horse staggers out of the night into the Marines' firelight, flanks glistening with oil, as though seeking a Rider of the Apocalypse that, like everyone else here, has gotten lost. What does war even mean when the killers have nothing to do -- when the killing is done by men far away and high above?
That's an ugly and pertinent question, and when ''Jarhead" stops to consider it, the movie's strong stuff. When it tries to rub our noses in the testosterone paradoxes of life in the armed forces -- like that gleeful, defiant group dry-hump that ends the football game -- it's less convincing. Swofford's book has been attacked by some Marines as a betrayal and an exaggeration (and defended by others), but it's extremely well-written, and the fear and uncertainty at its core has the ring of emotional truth. The film dilutes that core with borrowed movie moments before belatedly finding its stride, and its failure to connect suggests that the time for fictional war movies may be past -- that we'd be better off letting a thousand documentaries bloom, such as the recent ''Occupation Dreamland" and Eugene Jarecki's terrific ''Why We Fight," due in theaters next year.
Anyway, all writers are entitled to tell the story of their own war, whether it's on the battlefield, in their head, or -- as is usually the case -- somewhere in between. Like it or not, Anthony Swofford did just that. Mendes, by contrast, tells the story of a Hollywood war, and it's simply not the news we can use.


         What keeps a well-made film from achieving greatness? How does a motion picture with impressive parts end up a less than compelling whole? When the film is as strong in its elements as "Jarhead," no single factor is strong enough to do the fatal damage. Rather, an intricate web of interlocking reasons undermines the structure from within without anyone noticing what is happening.
 
  Certainly few projects in recent memory have had a more impressive pedigree than "Jarhead," starting with Anthony Swofford's memoir, subtitled "A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles," that was greeted with unapologetically rapturous reviews when it was published in 2003.
 


         






    The movie team that tackled the story of a young man's wartime coming of age started with screenwriter William Broyles Jr., himself a former Marine, who unobtrusively expanded characters and dramatized incidents. Oscar winner Sam Mendes ("American Beauty") was brought in to direct, hot young actor Jake Gyllenhaal to star, with the much-admired Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx providing support. Editor Walter Murch, cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner are as good as it gets, and music supervisor Randall Poster adroitly integrates ironic tunes like Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" into the mix.
 
  Against all expectation, however, the effect of all this excellence is negligible to nonexistent. As much as we intellectually admire "Jarhead," it's a cold film that only sporadically makes the kind of emotional connection it's after. Problems inherent in taking this particular book to the screen proved impossible to surmount.
 
  To read "Jarhead," named after a slang term for "Marine," is to understand that its success comes in large part from the seductive intimacy of Swofford's style, which takes us deep inside one man's head in an irresistible way. "Jarhead" the movie is after a different game. It wants to show us The Marine Experience writ large, so it has pared back Swofford's voice, turning an interior story into an exterior one and replacing an individual's idiosyncratic thought processes with a series of public incidents — incidents that, with a few exceptions, tend to play out way too standard on screen. It is impossible, for instance, to watch "Jarhead's" opening scenes of Swofford being brutalized by a Marine drill instructor without thinking of innumerable other movies, particularly how brilliantly Stanley Kubrick did exactly the same thing in "Full Metal Jacket." This feeling of familiarity persists as we follow Swofford through military life's inevitable stations of the cross. He meets his fellow soldiers, who first give him a hard time then make him one of their own. He attracts the notice of a staff sergeant/tough-love parental surrogate and becomes a member of an elite scout/sniper unit. He prepares for combat, gets sent to Saudi Arabia when Kuwait is invaded, and waits for the call to invade Iraq and begin the killing he's been trained for.
 
  Though moments in this journey — it wouldn't be fair to diminish what small impact "Jarhead" has by giving them away — stand out as individual, most of what we see feels like something we've seen before. Even Swofford himself seems to realize this, screaming when he hears a Vietnam-era Doors song in the combat zone, "Can't we even get our own music?" And the film's thematic sense that the experience of war is not what these young men anticipated goes back at least as far as "All Quiet on the Western Front" 75 years ago.
 
  Making matters worse is that the thing that sets Swofford's military experience apart is the Gulf War's near absence of heavy combat, so his involvement in killing did not exactly match Audie Murphy's or Sgt. York's. That postmodern lack of action and what it does to Swofford's head are among the book's strengths. But existential crises — symbolized in the movie by having Swofford tote around a copy of Camus' "The Stranger" — play best on the page. Philosophical implications aside, when nothing much is happening on screen, it is hard not to feel bored.
 
  Those feelings are exacerbated by Gyllenhaal's opaque performance as Swofford. As his work in the forthcoming "Brokeback Mountain" underlines, this is ordinarily an empathetic actor. Playing a character enveloped by the fog of war while trying to reconcile being simultaneously a part of and apart from the Marines, Gyllenhaal here is reserved, distant, almost featureless, even when he is trying to be emotional. "Jarhead's" most impressive performance comes not from him but the always reliable Sarsgaard, who walks off with the movie as Swofford's closest friend, Troy. Troy aside, Swofford's fellow Marines — profane, sadistic, as hyper-macho as moronic, drunken frat boys — are not exactly a pleasure to be around. Their loud, tedious presence, hardly a surprise, is undoubtedly true to life, but, unmediated by Swofford's involving prose, it serves no discernible purpose except further distancing the movie from the audience.
 
  Providing the final touch to "Jarhead's" litany of problems is an ironic accident of timing. While Swofford's book, a decade in the making, benefited by being published during the buildup to the current Iraq invasion, Mendes' film is hurt by coming out in the middle of that conflagration. Its polished surfaces and professional style can't compete with the gritty reality conveyed by documentaries like "Gunner Palace" and "Occupation: Dreamland" — or, for that matter, by the surreal black comedy of David O. Russell's "Three Kings" — that show in no uncertain terms what it's like to be a soldier in Iraq. Something "Jarhead," good intentions and undeniable skill notwithstanding, doesn't accomplish.

In one of the many startling and morally jagged moments that propel Jarhead , a Marine squad readies for combat by watching the ''Ride of the Valkyries'' attack sequence from Apocalypse Now . As the choppers lay waste to a Vietnamese village, the Marines erupt in cheers, imitating the soldiers on screen  the tapping of a rifle magazine on a helmet, say  as if joshing their way through The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Anthony Swofford, in his 2003 Gulf War memoir, explains that he and his fellow Marines used Apocalypse Now  and the other Vietnam films as a kind of violent pornography, pumping themselves up for the consummation they thought  or hoped  war would be. These Marines were hungry to kill, to ''get some.'' Yet for any civilian who has watched that helicopter raid, it's a shock to encounter young soldiers getting off on the thrill and dismissing the horror. ''It doesn't matter how many Mr. and Mrs. Johnsons are antiwar,'' writes Swofford. ''The actual killers who know how to use the weapons are not.''
Jarhead , a high-potency adaptation of Swofford's book that is nevertheless a tricky movie to warm up to, presents American soldiers confronting globalized warfare as a highly controlled yet unstable experience, a mosh pit of testosterone in search of an outlet. Shipped off, in the summer of 1990, to join Operation Desert Shield, Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a 20-year-old combat virgin, and his fellow Marines are dispatched to Iraq to ready themselves for a face-off with Saddam Hussein's troops, who are rumored to be using poison gas. As the Marines count down the days of waiting, which number in the dozens, then the hundreds, they're subjected to training exercises like playing football in gas masks in the broiling desert, an action that might have been designed to stoke their fear. Then the war starts, but the enemy is faceless to the point of abstraction: far-off men in the sand, or oil derricks, detonated by Saddam, burning against the night sky like orange tornado plumes. The Marines are turned into bystanders in their own war.
Swofford, played by Jake Gyllenhaal in a remarkable performance of wildly unstable machismo, is part of an elite scout/ sniper division  highly skilled military assassins with little or no battle experience. They're the children of frat houses, hipster war films, and high technology, and as a vision of what's flowing through their minds, bodies, and souls, Jarhead , written by William Broyles Jr. and directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty ), is an eye-opening experience. Entering his barracks, Swofford, whose bristle-skulled, ''jarhead'' look makes a bizarre counterpoint to his big, babyish eyes, gets pounded on by the other Marines, who duct-tape his arms to the bed and terrorize him with a mock–branding iron. Is this ritual hazing an angry jock assault on homoeroticism, or a skewed expression of it? Maybe both. In past war films, even the psychedelic spectacles of Nam, a girl back home was a comfort, but Jarhead  presents us with strutting bruiser kings for whom wives and girlfriends are a matter of squirmy anxiety  an ongoing reminder of the possibilities of adultery and betrayal. One man has to watch the entire platoon sit through his wife's videotaped infidelity. He must have done something to deserve it, but it's still a ''love letter'' from hell.
Watching Jarhead , these unvarnished snapshots of what can really happen among U.S. combat troops all but slap you with their observational force. Jamie Foxx, as an officer who loves the military more than life, deploys his sense of humor like a weapon; he gives even throwaway lines a jaunty, lethal sting. Yet there's a central oddity to the movie: The moments add up journalistically, alerting you to things you've never seen in a war film before, but they're strung together in such a calculatedly ''artless,'' objective fashion that we remain fascinated but detached. It would be easy to say that Jarhead  fails as a story, except that Mendes, refusing to coerce the details of Swofford's experience into arcs and resolutions (let alone the facile American-heroes-get-the-gold uplift of something like Three Kings ), forges, perhaps, a new kind of drama: a portrait of war stripped of all glamour and design. His most obvious influence was Full Metal Jacket , but that movie had Kubrick's simmering grand sweep. Jarhead  is an existential docudrama: cool and funny, vivid and remote at the same time.
Sitting in the desert, Swofford and his comrades are waiting for combat, and bored, but their weary anticipation is also a mask for fear. Unlike the soldiers who lived the insanity of Vietnam, they know, more or less, why they're in the Gulf: to defend the region's oil reserves, and therefore a tangle of corporate and government interests. But that hardly eases their impotence. Jarhead  isn't overtly political, yet by evoking the almost surreal futility of men whose lust for victory through action is dashed, at every turn, by the tactics, terrain, and morality of the war they're in, it sets up a powerfully resonant echo of the one we're in today.

 "Are we ever going to get to kill anyone?" asks a young marine toward the end of "Jarhead." It may be a strange question to hear in a war movie, but "Jarhead," about an unusual war, the first gulf war,  is a curious example of the genre.  Adapted from Anthony Swofford's best-selling memoir of the same title - a profane, scabrous prose poem alive with wit and anger - the film tries to convey not only the terror and thrill of military life, but also the frustration and tedium. This is something of a challenge: how to evoke a jittery, anxious state of boredom without inducing it in the audience.  And "Jarhead," directed by Sam Mendes from a screenplay by William Broyles Jr., half succeeds. It has moments that capture the peculiar mixture of stress, fatigue and impatience evoked in Mr. Swofford's reminiscences of his time in the United States Marine Corps. There are scenes full of surreal, desperate comic energy, like a football game played, for the benefit of visiting journalists, in gas masks and protective suits in 112-degree desert heat; and a feverish Christmas party fueled by contraband booze and hip-hop that ends in accidental fireworks.  The daily routines - basically rifle-cleaning, arguing, hydration and masturbation - are efficiently evoked. The Arabian landscape (or rather its California stand-in) is shot in harsh, desaturated tones by Roger Deakins, whose camerawork produces some haunting images. In this empty space, almost entirely devoid of greenery or topographical variation, people seem like abstractions - lonely, clumsy ciphers at once solitary and stripped of individuality.  But the movie, in spite of occasional concessions to melodrama, never produces much insight into or sympathetic connection with its characters. Mr. Swofford's memoir, which has a churning, abrasive immediacy, has been subjected to the aloof aestheticism that is Mr. Mendes's hallmark. The rough language and rough manners have been retained, but the story has been tamed and prettified. While it is not another lacquered, overpriced collectible in the manner of Mr. Mendes's "American Beauty" and "Road to Perdition," "Jarhead" is, in the end, similarly empty. It is a movie that walks up to some of the most urgent and painful issues of our present circumstance, clears its throat loudly and, with occasional flourishes of impressive rhetoric, says nothing.  Mr. Swofford  - "Swoff" to his buddies - is played by Jake Gyllenhaal as a smart, watchful young man who can't quite keep the smirk off his face. He reads Camus on the toilet and tells his first drill sergeant that he's in the Marine Corps because he "got lost on the way to college." (The officer responds by smashing Swoff's head into a blackboard.) The Swofford family history is declared off limits to us (a series of symbolic doors are slammed in our faces), and all we know is that Swoff's father and uncle were  marines in Vietnam and that his sister has been hospitalized.  He also has a girlfriend named Kristina (Brianne Davis), whose half-naked pictures provide him with both comfort and torment. Recruited by a staff sergeant named Sykes (Jamie Foxx) into an elite sniper unit, Swoff eventually finds himself on the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as Desert Shield slowly segues into Desert Storm.  At one point, Sykes relays the news that Saddam Hussein has promised "the mother of all battles," and the movie gestures back to a time before that phrase was the mother of all clichés. The first gulf war is obviously an event that impinges directly on the current situation, and yet at the same time it seems curiously remote. Its post-cold-war, pre-9/11 context is in some ways blurrier than more distant times. The war itself happened fast and left a confused legacy. As the last line of the movie's voice-over narration notes, "We're still in the desert."  No kidding. And what are we doing there? Nobody wants to talk about that. Early on, one of the characters interrupts a fellow marine's ranting to say, "No politics - we're here." Mr. Broyles (whose previous scripts include "Cast Away" and "Apollo 13") and Mr. Mendes obey this injunction, which I suppose is fair enough. There is a long tradition, literary as well as cinematic, of focusing on the ground-level experiences of combatants rather than on policy and strategy.  The operative question is not why we fight, but how, and "Jarhead,"  on screen and on the page, is thick with detail. There is the "wall of shame," where pictures of unfaithful wives and girlfriends are posted; the hazing rituals; the rules and procedures; the special language marines use to refer to everything around them. Devoted to war movies, they whoop and holler and sing along with Wagner while watching the "napalm in the morning" sequence from "Apocalypse Now." (Coincidentally or not, the editor of "Jarhead," Walter Murch, also worked on "Apocalypse Now.") All of this, along with the wildly obscene dialogue, holds your interest, but you can also feel the movie straining for an authenticity it lacks either the will or the means to achieve.  Swoff's comrades are basically stock platoon-movie figures retrofitted for postmodern warfare. There is an irresponsible prankster (Evan Jones), a trash-talking Texan (Lucas Black), a shy, nerdy guy (Brian Geraghty) and a Latino family man (Jacob Vargas) who shows off pictures of his pregnant wife. Sergeant Sykes is the in-your-face, tough-talking leader who shows his tenderness and wisdom at just the right moment as the flames of burning oil wells illuminate his features.  The filmmakers treat these men - and also Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), a tightly wound Michigander who becomes Swoff's shooting partner and closest friend - like pistachio nuts, splitting their hard shells to reveal morsels of emotion. Now and again there are scenes of rage or weeping, but these reveal little more than the movie's occasional need for a shift in tone. Mr. Sarsgaard's performance is, as usual, a model of intelligence and control, but his considerable skill is devoted to compensating for the vagueness and incoherence of his character, and of "Jarhead" as a whole. The movie is full of intensity with almost no real visceral impact.  Mr. Swofford's book has earned a place alongside the classics of military literature, but Mr. Mendes's film is more like a footnote - a minor movie about a minor war, and a film that feels, at the moment, remarkably irrelevant.  "Jarhead" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has pervasive profanity and some strong sexual content.
One of the few Hollywood  movies to ever acknowledge the Desert Storm  "experience," Sam Mendes 's Jarhead  is both fastidiously grueling and perversely withholding. In his adaptation of Anthony Swofford 's memoir, Mendes has contrived a combat film almost entirely without combat.
Highly appropriate: Operation Desert Storm was not just the first war with a real-time mass audience, it proved virtually cost-free for its (non-Iraqi) spectators. Casualties were erased as the combat situation merged with its own ultra-produced tele-representation. Back then Sylvester Stallone  sagely declared Desert Storm but a speed bump on the highway of historyhe understood that Rambo heroics were superfluous. Indeed, Hollywood's first account of the war, Edward Zwick 's Courage Under Fire  (1996), amplified a single battlefield incident into a Rashomon  narrative court case, and three years later, David O. Russell 's bold and messy Three Kings  dealt with the war by riffing on its aftermath. Now Jarhead which more or less ends where Three Kings  beginsattempts to get to Desert Storm by dwelling on its prologue.
A sustained atmosphere of brutish frustration is immediately established in the marine boot camp where protag Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal ) receives his basic training. Swoff is both above it and beneath it; he realizes enlisting was a bad decision even before he's stuck in a company of "retards and fuckups." In fact, it's worse. That hanging with the marines is more like living with a gang of baby Nazis is established by the movie's key sequence. Watching the spectacular Wagnerian helicopter napalm scene from Apocalypse Now , which they obviously know by heart, the guys are on their feet screaming for bloodand the spell is hardly broken when the trumpet call of duty sounds.
For Jarhead , the essence of Desert Storm is the immense buildup that, over the autumn and winter of 1990, populated the desert with half a million American troops (roughly equal to Vietnam 's max). No Saigon  ficky-fick for these poor devils. Waiting in the wasteland, they drill in pitiless heat, submit to inane interviews, and hone their aggression on a shared hatred of women. His big-jawed smirk accentuated by a bulked-up physique and baldie haircut, Gyllenhaal gives the impression that this misery is playing out in his head. He's sensitivefor him it's even worse. Gyllenhaal's beseeching pale-eyed stare is more eloquent than his voiceover; as his smart, troubled buddy, Peter Sarsgaard  brings some depth to an underwritten part; Jamie Foxx  is appropriately lively as a staff sergeant with a human core beneath his tough exterior and a measure of madness lurking beneath that.
After 175 days, war arrives, and Mendes, who is as much designer as director, cuts to the beige-on-beige battlefield. Jarhead  goes slo-mo and subjective as the boys get a brief taste of actionthat they're strafed by U.S. bombers only adds to the solipsism. Plus, the frustration seems eternal. When sniper Swoff finally receives a mission, minutes before the war ends, he has to radio the base for permission to even squeeze off a shot. Mainly what these guys do is bear witnessstumbling through a landscape of incinerated jeeps, charred corpses, and oil wells blazing in the beyond-Coppola apocalyptic night.
Jarhead  pounds along, largely unmodulated in its Hobbesian view of men (almost) at war. A master of the monotone, Mendes prompts his performers to hit a note and sustain it. Although Jarhead  is more visually accomplished and less empty than American Beauty  or Road to Perdition , it still feels oppressively hermetic. The precise mise-en-scéne and elegant sense of spacenot to mention the snarky attitudepay homage to Stanley Kubrick , but Mendes lacks Kubrick's Olympian formalism and touch for sarcastic pop. He lamely scores a gas mask exercise to T. Rex's "Bang a Gong" and reprises the Doors to allow a jarhead complaint: "Can't we get our own fucking music."
As Desert Storm was the designated un-Vietnam, so Jarhead  has an ambiguous relationship with the Nam movies that presumably fueled its combatants' warrior dreams. Not only Apocalypse Now  and Full Metal Jacket  but Platoon  and The Deer Hunter  are explicitly acknowledged. The dank Michael Cimino  chest thumper, humorously presented as a literal counterpoint to the libidinal Apocalypse Now , turns out to be not warno-but pornography.
In another movie reference, Jarhead  restages Three Kings ' rap-fueled victory stomp. The latter film deserves credit for rethinking the combat film in the weird we-are-the-world terms Desert Storm establishedeven if it did ultimately recast the war as an altruistic adventure that didn't go far enough. (What goes around comes around: Director Russell ran into candidate George W. Bush  at a Hollywood fundraiser in the summer of 1999 and told him that he was making a movie critical of his father's Gulf War legacy. "Then I guess I'm going to have to go finish the job, aren't I?" the younger Bush replied.)
Jarhead  is not only a far tougher slog, it's naturally more successful in presenting itself as a referendum on the second Gulf war. The movie is oppressively heavy even when mischievously lighthearted. But no irony weighs more than Swoff's pre-postscript closer, "We never have to come back to this shithole ever again!"
