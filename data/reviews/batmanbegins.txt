In "Batman Begins," Christian Bale gives us the best Bruce Wayne that has ever graced the screen. He's grave, intense -- a tormented straight-arrow lacking any of the camp feyness of Adam West on the old '60s TV show. This Wayne has a streamlined profile and eyes that are all business, and his joking one-liners carry the weight of a man who's seen more than he wants to. Wayne may play at being an all-American playboy but behind the social mask he's closer to an American psycho, a role this actor once made his own in a film of that very title. From Patrick Bateman to Batman, Bale hints, is a very small step.
Then he puts on the costume and the movie stumbles. Under the cowl, Bale's face looks pear-shaped and strangely un-Baleful; where Keaton and Kilmer and Clooney gained a malevolent edge from the hooded eyes and art deco ears, Bale resembles Jay Leno stuffed into a leftover "Eyes Wide Shut" mask. It's an inexplicable miscalculation and not the only one in a movie on which the hopes of comic book freaks and Warner Bros. shareholders alike are riding.
Thankfully, "Batman Begins" does far more right than it does wrong. This is especially true of the long central section that stands as the most deliciously smart "origin story" in the long, pulpy history of comic book movies. If you've ever entertained doubter's logic watching one of these things -- Where, exactly, does a superhero get his outfit? What prompts a person to become a costumed arch-villain instead of, say, a carjacker or an IRS auditor? How do you excavate and outfit a state-of-the-art Batcave without the neighbors noticing the delivery vans? -- "Batman Begins" is here to explain it all to you.
That it does so with a certain amount of cheek is thanks to co-writer-director Christopher Nolan, who made his name with the time-shifting head games of 2000's "Memento" and who's sharper than his material here. "Batman Begins" is at its weakest when tending to standard summer-action-movie business: the fight scenes and chase sequences are blurry, over-edited tangles of murk in which it's difficult to tell who is smacking whom with what large object. But everything concerned with how a billionaire orphan with a bat complex might go about setting up shop is genuinely inspired.
Nolan's Gotham City is a diseased, crepuscular burg: part "Blade Runner," part "Metropolis," part Abe Beame-era "drop dead" New York. The vibe is Great Depression; the cars and clothing are day before yesterday. A tatty criminal enterprise run by Carmine Falcone -- British actor Tom Wilkinson with a juicy, fraudulent Chicaga accent -- controls the city. If there's a ray of sunlight anywhere in the movie, I don't recall it, and, anyway, the crew member responsible has probably been sacked.
The mugging deaths of young Bruce's parents is dealt with briefly and for maximum survivor guilt, and the director sketches the young man's early years with a lot of chronological back-and-forth. All you need to know is that he ends up in the high Himalayan training grounds of the League of Shadows, a group of extraordinarily Nietzschean gentlemen overseen by Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Wayne's personal trainer is Henri Ducard, played by Liam Neeson with an air of melancholy distraction, as if contemplating the choices that have led him from Oskar Schindler to this.
Comic book fans and teenage boys will eat this portentous stuff up, but it's old hat no matter how jazzy the editing. "Batman Begins" springs to life as soon as Wayne goes back to Gotham and the character actors start popping up thicker than horseflies. Look, there's Michael Caine, single-handedly raising the film's pulse as butler Alfred; Rutger Hauer playing, for all intents and purposes, the Kenneth Lay of Wayne Enterprises, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, the disgraced tech-genius who provides Bruce with all his toys. (The Batmobile as a mothballed Defense Department initiative? Genius.)
Scuttling between the scenes is Gary Oldman as a low-level Gotham City police detective named Gordon, one honest cop among the gleefully corrupt. Most surprisingly, there's Irish slacker-heartthrob Cillian Murphy ("28 Days Later") as Dr. Jonathan Crane, the prissy head psychiatrist of the Arkham Asylum for the Insane. Initially a cog in mobster Falcone's machine, Crane turns out to have his own nefarious plans, but Murphy plays it with such quiet blue-eyed creepiness that you realize with a start, well into the movie, he's a supervillain as well.
Everything in "Batman Begins" has its prosaic, real-world explanation -- The Bat-Signal? Gordon's hastily improvised way of getting Batman's attention -- and if you've ever had any emotion invested in this story, there's huge satisfaction as each nugget of bat-data clicks neatly into place. The one puzzle piece that never fits, futz with it though the filmmakers may, is Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Wayne's childhood sweetheart (before he had that unfortunate fall down a bat-filled well) and the current assistant district attorney/sitting duck. An actor needs to live large in a movie like this, but our Katie is a meek, saucer-eyed presence with the voice and dramatic heft of a girl. Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson could have her for breakfast and still feel peckish.
In the final act, Nolan is forced to knuckle under to the demands of plot, and the hollowness of the opening scenes returns. "Batman Begins" feints at topical notions of airborne terrorism and fundamentalist disgust with American decadence, but it quickly devolves into rubble and noise. The climax features the hero and villain battling each other aboard a bullet train carrying a doomsday device toward the heart of the city at out-of-control speed. There is no part of that last sentence that is not a cliche.
Thankfully, Bale survives, even more than Batman or Bruce Wayne. The previous iteration of this franchise -- the "Batman" movies kicked off by Tim Burton and pounded into inanity by Joel Schumacher -- were all surface pleasures and Special Guest Stars, with an everchanging, slightly out-of-focus Dark Knight at their centers.
Bale and Nolan tip their hats to Burton once or twice, but mostly they reclaim the character and make Bruce Wayne the author of his own fortunes. The dialogue leans hard on psychobabble about "becoming one with your fears," and the star is too much the earnest young pro to wink at such nonsense. But he conveys, better than any Batman before him, the ridiculous thrill of playing dress-up to save the world.


         Batman has finally come home. Not just to a story that painstakingly details his origins but to an ominous style that suits it beautifully.
 
  Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" disdains the mindless camp and compulsive weirdness that mostly characterized its quartet of predecessors and unapologetically positions its hero at the dark end of the street. With Christian Bale in the title role, this is a film noir Batman, a brooding, disturbing piece of work that starts slowly but ends up crafting a world that just might haunt your dreams.
 


         






    In doing this, Nolan, who co-wrote with comic book specialist David S. Goyer, has in effect brought the franchise back to its modern origins. That would be the appearance in 1986, three years before the first Tim Burton film, of Frank Miller's somber and ominous graphic novel "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns," which repositioned Bob Kane's 1939 Caped Crusader as a contemporary figure of almost existential torment.
 
  Nolan's intention with "Batman Begins," however, is to go beyond this and create a myth grounded, as much as myth can be, in plain reality. He wants his story to be as plausible as possible, a human drama set in a believable world that looks like one we could live in but prefer not to. A film that underlines the notion that Batman is that unlikely comic-book hero who does without super powers, someone, the director has said, who "really is just a guy that does a lot of push-ups." A heck of a lot of push-ups.
 
  Nolan was a shrewd choice to revive a franchise that has gone eight years without a film. One of the qualities shared by his exceptional but otherwise diverse trio of previous films ("Following," "Memento," "Insomnia") is how skillfully they are put together on a craft level. This "Batman" is a carefully thought out and consummately well-made piece of work, a serious comic-book adaptation that is driven by story, psychology and reality, not special effects.
 
  In fact, with Wally Pfister (who shot Nolan's last two films) as cinematographer, "Batman Begins" tries, despite using multiple special-effects houses, to avoid computer-generated imagery when it can. The film relies instead on shooting in real locations (from the streets of Chicago to a glacier in Vatnajokull, Iceland) and extensive use of miniatures, albeit some whose 35-feet height was made possible by constructing the sets in an enormous former blimp hangar with ceilings that rise to 200 feet. Nolan also did without a second unit, preferring the tonal unity he felt would come from directing everything himself.
 
  Though his name might not have initially been on everyone's lips, Christian Bale turns out to be an excellent fit for Nolan's conception of the Dark Knight. And though he gained back the 63 pounds he lost for "The Machinist" and added an extra 20 for good measure, there is a leanness, a sense of purpose about his performance.
 
  Always a humorless, almost sullen actor, Bale uses those qualities to create a painfully earnest character driven to a life of crime-fighting almost against his will. Bale even employed the physically uncomfortable Batsuit to his advantage: "I used the pain," he has said, "as fuel for the character's anger."
 
  Though Batman's alter ego remains wealthy socialite Bruce Wayne, being the Dark Knight is not a rich man's whim. "Batman Begins" shows us in great detail how Wayne became phobic about bats as a small boy, saw that phobia contribute to his parents' untimely death and, driven by despair, ended up fighting the world in a prison in Bhutan.
 
  It's there that Wayne meets the shadowy Ducard (Liam Neeson), the emissary of Ra's al Ghul and the sinister League of Shadows, a group fanatically dedicated to the stamping out of evil. They offer to make him one of their own, and in the group's Himalayan redoubt Wayne learns more than ninja fighting techniques and methods of psychological warfare. He learns that embracing his own fear, specifically that old phobia toward bats, will be the key to his transformation.
 
  If this scenario sounds a bit standard, it is in fact the least involving part of the film, for "Batman Begins" does not immediately kick into its highest gear. Though the early days of a hero have an intrinsic interest, especially when they are as thought out as they are here, this backstory has a tendency to feel too pulp-fiction familiar to completely enthrall.
 
  Also a problem, and one that recurs sporadically through the film, is that not all of "Batman's" actors have equal facility with the admittedly difficult assignment of being both comic-book archetypes and real people. Bale, who seems to feel this role in his bones, handles it with aplomb, but both Neeson and Katie Holmes, who appears later as a putative romantic interest, never seem to be sure which side of the coin to favor at any given moment.
 
  Once Wayne returns to Gotham and sets his mind on being Batman, the noir possibilities of a black-caped avenger and a city at night help things immeasurably. Not only does production designer Nathan Crowley's "Blade Runner"-influenced look suit the film, but the specifics of Batman lore — the cave, the car, the suit, the swooping late-night flights — benefit from that dark treatment as well.
 
  The Gotham scenario also showcases the best of "Batman's" supporting cast. On the side of light, both Michael Caine as Wayne family retainer, Alfred Pennyworth, and Morgan Freeman as the film's version of James Bond's armorer Q make this kind of acting look easier than it is.
 
  On the side of darkness, Cillian Murphy, last seen in Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later," is terrifically chilling as the evil Dr. Jonathan Crane and his alter ego, the Scarecrow, who can turn a simple burlap sack into an object of total dread.
 
  The most encouraging thing about "Batman Begins" is how individual director/co-writer Nolan has managed to make an $180-million epic. Director of photography Pfister, interviewed in American Cinematographer magazine, offered an explanation.
 
  "One of the reasons Chris likes me to operate [the camera] is that it shrinks down the whole process for him," Pfister says. "We could be sitting on the set with 150 people and huge setups, but when the camera rolls, it's just Chris sitting next to me with a little monitor, and the actors right there in front of us. His entire universe is in that 12-foot area, which brings the process down to a more personal level." Bringing an auteur sensibility to blockbuster material may sound next door to impossible, but "Batman Begins" shows it can be done. If you're willing to do the push-ups.

One benefit of not being a comic-book fanboy or -girl is the immunity such dispassion grants: No blood-pressure crises are likely to arise over arguments pertaining to whether Batman Begins  lives up to the franchise launched 16 years ago by director Tim Burton and Batman No. 1, Michael Keaton, then sullied  tsk!  eight years ago by director Joel Schumacher and Batman No. 3, George Clooney, with that unholy nippled Batsuit. My intelligent-nonspecialist-person's requirements for any summertime live-action movie based on a comic book are simply, neutrally these: (1) Make it fun (that's where The Hulk  fell down); (2) make it fresh (that's where X2  was such an advance over X-Men ); (3) make it meaty (that's where Spider-Man 2  was a feast).
And by these standards, Batman Begins , directed by indie-oriented storyteller Christopher Nolan (Memento ), is a triumph  a confidently original, engrossing interpretation, with a seriously thought-through (but never self-serious) aesthetic point of view that announces, from the get-go, someone who knows what he's doing is running the show, and he's modestly unafraid to do something new. The movie reenergizes Bruce Wayne and his winged mammalian disguise for a 21st-century relaunch, after the Hollywoodized Caped Crusader had giggled and vamped to a dead end with 1997's Batman & Robin . And it advances and deepens the mythology by showing, quite meticulously (but with flits of fanged humor), how childhood trauma led the rich young orphan to burrow down deep into his anger and guilt so that when he emerged, he was able to become the Dark Knight, grim savior of a city going to hell.
That's always the tricky part, isn't it: giving a comic-book hero psychological weight, but not so much that the gee-whiz saving-the-world stuff is overtaken by psychoanalysis. Or giving the superhero-in-training so much instruction at the hands of an aphorism-spouting teacher that the Yoda-babble gets in the way of the learning curve. Yet Batman Begins  avoids the deepest of these potholes with notable nimbleness. (The script is by Nolan and comic-book guru David S. Goyer, best known for the Blade  trilogy.) When first encountered in a Chinese prison camp  those early images a blunt, swift-moving statement that Nolan is interested in the look of the real over that of the gaudy or grand  our not-yet-Batman is already on an independent-study trip to learn the ways of criminals. Then he's plucked for training by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson, possibly wearing old Jedi Master underpants), a recruiter for the humorless vigilante group that calls itself the League of Shadows. (''All creatures feel fear.'' ''Men fear most what they cannot see.'' ''Embrace your worst fear,'' Ducard says, until our biggest fear is that he'll say, ''We have nothing to fear but fear itself.'')
And only then does Batman find his wings, and his mission. That Bruce's parents were killed before his eyes, and that the heir to the Wayne fortune would be nowhere without his butler, Alfred, even the greenest newbie to the hagiography knows. But knowing doesn't pack the same pleasurable jolt as seeing primly smoldering Christian Bale's Batman No. 4 play so comfortably against expansively proper Michael Caine's Alfred (taking over for Michael Gough as if to the manor born) and watching the two devise the very first Batsuit. Any familiarity with Commissioner Gordon and his place as one overmatched good cop is only rewarded by the participation of Gary Oldman as the younger Detective Gordon.
Simpatico Wayne Enterprises inventor Lucius Fox contributes his mechanical expertise (handy when it comes to Batmobiles) and cool to the proceedings in the person of Morgan Freeman. Katie Holmes provides obligatory, chaste romantic interest  superheroes are notoriously dull boyfriends, if you ask me  as Bruce's childhood sweetheart– turned–incorruptible DA.
It's not just the birth of Batman we're seeing here, it's also the dawning of Gotham City's age of corporate greed (Rutger Hauer plays a ruthless CEO), unchecked corruption (Tom Wilkinson swings by as a crime boss), and the insidious misuse of the mentally ill by those appointed to their care (Cillian Murphy is one great creep as psycho psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane). In Batman Begins , as Nolan tells it, Gotham is poised somewhere between the Jazz Age and the Space Age, a vertiginous time warp where only a risk-taking artist can navigate. Nolan ought to get back there soon and tell us what happens next.

 Near the big-bang finish of "Batman Begins," the title avenger, played by the charismatic young British actor Christian Bale, scoops up a damsel in distress, played by Katie Holmes, and spirits her away to his lair. Watching this scene, it was hard not to think how nice it would have been if Batman had instead dispatched the infernally perky actress, whose recent off-screen antics have threatened to eclipse this unexpectedly good movie. As it happens, the most memorable rescue mission in "Batman Begins" isn't engineered by the caped crusader, but by the film's director, Christopher Nolan.  "Batman Begins" is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director who takes his material seriously and to a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease. Until now, Mr. Bale, who cut his teeth working with Steven Spielberg on "Empire of the Sun" almost two decades ago, has been best known for his scarily plausible performance in "American Psycho," an intellectual horror movie that now seems like a prelude to this one: think American Psycho redux, this time in tights.  As sleek as a panther, with cheekbones that look sharp enough to give even an ardent lover pause, Mr. Bale makes a superbly menacing avenger. His Batman is leagues away from Adam West's cartoony persona, which lumbered across American television screens in the mid- and late-60's with zap and pow, but never an ounce of real wow. Mr. Bale even improves on Michael Keaton, who donned Batman's cape both in Tim Burton's 1989 "Batman" and its funhouse sequel three years later, and gave the character a jolt of menace. What Mr. Keaton couldn't bring to the role, and what Mr. Bale conveys effortlessly, is Bruce Wayne's air of casual entitlement, the aristocratic hauteur that is the necessary complement of Batman's obsessive megalomania.  What Mr. Nolan gets, and gets better than any other previous director, is that without Bruce Wayne, Batman is just a rich wacko with illusions of grandeur and a terrific pair of support hose. Without his suave alter ego, this weird bat man is a superhero without humanity, an avenger without a conscience, an id without a superego. Which is why, working from his and David S. Goyer's very fine screenplay, Mr. Nolan more or less begins at the beginning, taking Batman back to his original trauma and the death of his parents. With narrative economy and tangible feeling, he stages that terrible, defining moment when young Master Wayne watched a criminal shoot his parents to death in a Gotham City alley, thereby setting into motion his long, strange journey into the self.  The story opens with the adult Bruce in the middle of that journey, in the far reaches of Asia, where he first rubs shoulders with "the criminal fraternity," then a clandestine brotherhood called the League of Shadows. Lead by a warrior sensei, Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), and his aide, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson, at his lethal best), the league invites Bruce into its fold, an offer he violently declines. Thereafter, he returns to Gotham City, where he assumes a dual identity as both the city's wealthiest citizen and its avenging angel. Intrigue ensues involving a crime lord played with brio by Tom Wilkinson, a headshrinker brought to skin-crawling life by Cillian Murphy and the last honest cop in Gotham, James Gordon, given expressive poignancy by a restrained Gary Oldman.  It's amazing what an excellent cast, a solid screenplay and a regard for the source material can do for a comic book movie. Unlike Robert Rodriguez, whose faithfulness to Frank Miller's comic sucked the juice out of "Sin City," Mr. Nolan approaches Batman with respect rather than reverence. It's obvious that Mr. Nolan has made a close study of the Batman legacy, but he owes a specific debt to Mr. Miller's 1980's rethink of the character, which resurrected the Dark Knight side of his identity. Like Mr. Miller's Batman, Mr. Nolan's is tormented by demons both physical and psychological. In an uncertain world, one the director models with an eye to our own, this is a hero caught between justice and vengeance, a desire for peace and the will to power.  That struggle gives the story its requisite heft, but what makes this "Batman" so enjoyable is how Mr. Nolan balances the story's dark elements with its light, and arranges the familiar genre elements in new, unforeseen ways. Weaned on countless comics and a handful of movies, we may think we know the bat cave like we know the inside of our childhood bedroom. But to watch Bruce Wayne stand in the atmospheric gloom of this new cavern, surrounded by a cloud of swirling bats, is to see the underground refuge for the first time. Likewise the Batmobile, which here resembles a Hummer that looks as if it had been gently flattened by a Bradley tank, then tricked out for some hard street racing with fat tires and gleaming black paint.  As is often the case with movies about toys and boys, "Batman Begins" drags on too long, but even the reflexively Bruckheimer-like finish can't diminish its charms. Mr. Nolan needs to work on his action: Fred Astaire made sure that he was filmed so that you could see the entirety of his body, advice this director should have heeded when shooting his superhero. Still, what makes "Batman Begins" the most successful comic-book adaptation alongside Terry Zwigoff's "Ghost World" isn't the noisy set pieces, the nods to "Blade Runner" or the way a child's keepsake, an Indian arrowhead, echoes the shape of a bat. It's the way Mr. Nolan invites us to watch Bruce Wayne quietly piecing together his Batman identity, to become a secret sharer to a legend, just as we did once upon a time when we read our first comic.  "Batman Begins" is rated PG-13 (Some material might be inappropriate for children under 13). The film includes intense if bloodless action, notably the gun death of the Bruce Wayne's parents. People with bat phobias should take care.

It's more Bruce Wayne than caped crusader in "Batman Begins," a telling of the legendary character's formative experiences that gives precedence to psychology over super-heroics. While developing an elaborate backstory for the 66-year-old comic book figure, director Christopher Nolan delivers a very serious would-be franchise launcher that, perhaps inadvertently, bears closer thematic comparison to "Kill Bill" and aspects of "Star Wars" than to what audiences primed on the Burton/Schumacher films or the TV series might expect. Ambitious, well made but not exactly rousing, lavishly produced Warner Bros. release will ride heavy promotion and want-see to big openings worldwide, but is too dark and talky to appeal to kids and won't inspire much repeat viewing, which casts sought-after blockbuster B.O. in some doubt.
After so much to-and-fro about how to revive the Dark Knight (the studio's last entry in its four-picture set, the lamentable "Batman and Robin," appeared just eight years ago), it was a fairly gutsy bet on Warner's part to entrust the job to Nolan, a crafty young director whose "Memento" and "Insomnia" evinced storytelling smarts, visual flair and good instincts with actors.
But these matters aren't at issue. Rather, it's the story that's been chosen to be told, and the degree of gravity invested in it. From the opening scene, Nolan and co-screenwriter David S. Goyer ( the "Blade" series) foreground the demons that haunt and drive Bruce Wayne, and it's a full hour before "the Bat-Man" (as he was originally called) shows up. Psychological depth is all well and good, but it's an open question how much time you want to spend on it when the subject is a cartoon character.
The filmmakers seem intent upon making Bruce/Batman and his actions as plausible (one resists saying realistic) as possible, emphasizing that he's a distinctly human hero with no super powers. All the same, guys, he was still born in a comic book, and it's doubtful Batman would have lived very long had the original DC Comics been as drained of sheer childlike fun as this film is. There is talent and cleverness here, but not much excitement.
Jumping around in time during the opening stretch, pic details how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale as an adult, Gus Lewis as a kid), the only child of a wealthy philanthropic industrialist, is traumatized at an early age upon accidentally falling into an empty well that's home to an enormous number of bats; feels guilt over the murder of his parents at the hands of a derelict robber; leaves his palatial home upon reaching maturity to investigate criminality in the darker corners of Asia, and is rescued from a dreadful prison (in what the press notes indicate is Bhutan) by a mysterious fellow named Ducard (Liam Neeson). A tough taskmaster, Ducard teaches his specially selected pupil about achieving justice and becoming a legend.
Although shot in Iceland amidst spectacular terrain that recalls the Alaskan setting of "Insomnia," this long instructional section is filled with philosophical gobbledygook about developing strength by facing your deepest fears, methods of focusing anger and vengefulness, and how "you must journey inwards."
Some of this is delivered while Ducard and Bruce face off with large swords on a frozen lake, and one must be forgiven for imagining that what's onscreen are outtakes from "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace," with Neeson's Jedi knight teaching Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling techniques.
It doesn't stop there, however, as "The Last Samurai" is invoked with the entrance of Ken Watanabe as the charismatic leader of a vigilante ninja org called the League of Shadows.
In the end, Bruce proves himself a worthy student, returning home to take on the rampant corruption in Gotham (or is it Sin City?). Half the city is in the pocket of gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Others up to no good are Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), a young psychiatrist who leads a double life as the sinister Scarecrow, and Earle (Rutger Hauer), who has taken charge of the Wayne family industries.
Although none of these figures qualifies as a great villain, Bruce begins developing his alter ego with help from ever-loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and company high-tech expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Fox functions much like "Q" in the Bond films by turning Bruce on to useful gizmos, including a very powerful armored vehicle ("Does it come in black?" Bruce inquires, in one of the better lines).
Batman begins modestly by disrupting a drug shipment and handing Falcone to the police, one of whose few honest officers is Detective Sergeant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). Also on the good team is Bruce's childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes), a very young-looking assistant district attorney who is disappointed that Bruce appears to be a dissolute playboy with no ideals.
Nolan and Goyer dwell on the idea of the masks one chooses to put on for the world to see, as well as the notion of character being defined by deed not word; concepts are entirely appropriate to Batman, but are hardly new or worth belaboring. Then there's the late-on surprise of who the main bad guy turns out to be, which is all right but further splinters the villainy.
All along, pic emphasizes the real-worldliness of Bruce. This is even a Batman movie in which the Batcave is an actual bat cave. But when it comes to Batman's attacks on adversaries, the film fudges it, throwing a flurry of images on the screen with quick editing that obscures how the winged one manages to so easily drop in on his enemies.
What this incarnation of Batman lacks is theatricality, a sense of showmanship to put over the new approach. Although little jokes and quips are gradually introduced, only slowly does Nolan dare to begin having any fun with the material, and even then far too cautiously. It's not that the film is prosaic, but it is terribly sober, afraid to make grand gestures and build to major payoffs. It's as if, out of a desire to appear smart and not to pander to the large public destined to see the picture, Nolan restrained himself from providing moments that might prove too audience pleasing.
As opposed to the highly designed Gotham City of the Tim Burton pictures, this one features cityscapes that recognizably belong to the real Chicago, with a fictional monorail system added in. Nor is there anything fetishistic about the Batman costume, which is plain and functional.
With an ideal physique and bearing for the role, Bale makes for a committed, driven, urbane and intelligent do-gooder; only oddity is the somewhat electronic quality of his voice as Batman. Neeson is a fearsome mentor, and Murphy makes a strong impression as the corrupt doctor, although the Scarecrow persona is woefully undeveloped. Oldman is effectively cast against type as the most decent man in Gotham, Holmes is OK, and Caine dryly does all he can in the butler role that could have benefited from some posthumous additional dialogue by Preston Sturges.
Unusual soundtrack collaboration by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard results in a moodily churning score that adds an extra sense of momentum to the tale. Tag promises a sequel in which the Joker is specifically indicated as the chief villain.

Since Joel Schumacher 's Batman Forever  (1995) and Batman & Robin  (1997) devolved an already campy superhero franchise into a sub-Vegas monster's ball, it seems fitting that Christopher Nolan 's Batman Begins  is fastidiously grim. That is, it strives to take post-teen sturm und drang seriously, just as it must accept Tim Burton 's expressionistic cityscapes as ordained. The promise of the comic book, in both its original Bob Kane  incarnation and Dark Knight resurrection, was of existentialist hyper-noir with a Fritz Langian  remorselessness, and Nolan aims for the dark heart, drenching the movie in orphan grief and questioning the fascist pathology of vigilante violence.
In the movie's bid for solemnity, even Jung is explicitly invoked, but Nolan and his co-screenwriter David Goyer  can only press the big buttons so hardit's still an old-school superhero summer movie, the plotting tortuous, the characters relegated to one-scene-one-emotion simplicity, the digitized action a never ending club mix of chases and mano a manos. As the title sez, we start at the beginning (again), when Bruce Wayne  is but the wee scion of billionaire parentswho, the film struggles to insist, are not in the least responsible for the rampaging poverty and social decay of Gotham City. (The subway that Linus Roache 's Dr. Wayne built is seen as an act of beneficence, to help the poor get to the jobs they presumably don't have since they're all junkies and petty crooks.) Indeed, the screenplay performs ludicrous contortions trying to conform the fact of Batman's bottomless wealth to the urban blight he conscientiously battles at night.
After his parents are gunned down by a mugger, Bruce grows up to be Christian Bale , broods, rejects the rich-boy lifestyle, and ends up in a Chinese prison, where he is salvaged by Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe ) and Henri Ducard  (Liam Neeson ), the leaders of the League of Shadows , a ninja army dedicated to restoring "balance" to suffering civilizations via spare-no-collateral intervention. Laboriously trained, Wayne returns home determined to bring justice to the streets.
The "how" is where Nolan and Goyer have focused their energies, providing explanations for every aspect of Batman's regalia, down to the cape (just like his father's tux jacket, placed over the boy's shoulders at the crime scene). Since his ninja training required him to "Conquer your fear!" Wayne's childhood phobia of bats becomes his chief criminal-terrorizing guise. (Fears need to be confronted, combated, and wrestled into submission, we're told ad infinitum, but all I could muster was the fear of a Dolby -bludgeoned tympanic cavity.) Soon, a chemical plot to destroy the city arises out of the busi-ness relationship between a mobster (Tom Wilkinson ) and an effete psychiatrist (Cillian Murphy ), proprietor of Arkham Asylum.
Stuck in a glower groove, Bale acts only insofar as the context and the equipment will let him; the movie's tidbits of bemused humanity are the sole responsibility of Morgan Freeman , as a Wayne Industries  techie, and Michael Caine , as Alfred. Scrambling villains and motivations from three decades of comic books, Batman Begins  seeks out a middle ground between the Spider-Man  films (boyish rectitude and romance) and the X-Men  series (pseudo-sophisticated political ideas, including an archnemesis monologue that suggests the WTO  has always been part of Ra's al Ghul's secret clan, doggedly destroying societies around the globe with "economics"). That it more or less succeeds hardly calls for drinks on the house. Nolan, like many filmmakers, seems to rise or sink to the level of his material and under the burden of his budget; those looking for a taste of Memento 's radical perspective amid the stunts and CGIs will feel bereft.
