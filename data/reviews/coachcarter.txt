This b-ball drama deserves high marks for its unimpeachable intentions � "Part of growing up is making your own decisions and living with the consequences," the script reminds us � and there are worse things for MTV Films to do with its deep pockets than dramatize the story of Ken Carter (Jackson), the inner-city basketball coach who locked out his entire undefeated varsity team because the low grades of some of its members made college recruitment unlikely. Come to this movie for the prominent hip-hop soundtrack and glossy sports action; leave with a message about teamwork, decency, and self-respect scorched into your brain. Too bad Coach Carter
 isn�t a better movie. Director Carter (no relation to his subject, I presume � although it�s worth mentioning that Carter is Austin-born and Southwest Texas State-educated), of the interesting youth dramedy Save the Last Dance
, has a beast of a story on his hands � too many build-ups and turning points, too many dead-weight subplots � and he responds with the kind of formulaic narrative shorthand that gives the sports genre a bad name: big speeches, beat-the-clock finales, slow-motion entrances, eyeglasses removed dramatically, training montages, scowling authority figures (principal Denise Dowse), and a huddle of nonspeaking players whose purpose is to respond thoughtfully to Jackson�s guidance while glistening with prop sweat. Jackson sells it, of course, but none of the actors has a bit of breathing room. Not pop diva Ashanti in her much-vaunted debut as the pregnant girlfriend of a promising player (Brown). Not Gonzalez as the wild-card gangbanger who quits and rejoins the team more often than Jackson removes his eyeglasses dramatically. Not Ri'chard (Light It Up)
 as Carter�s son, who feels estranged from his father � a frequent occurrence among sports-movie families � and transfers schools to join his team. Tanner (The Wood)
 does make an impression as the team�s requisite goofball; his vitality and presence suggest that he�s inhabiting a character more multidimensional than the script imagines. And the script is really the heart of the problem. Writers Mark Schwahn and John Gatins have a teen-movie pedigree (lightweight fare like Summer Catch
 and The Perfect Score
), and they�ve kludged the film�s true-life material into a conventional three-act shape instead of reimagining it as cinematic.


If you don't get to church much but are even mildly concerned about the future of urban youth, "Coach Carter" is here to offer well over two hours of secular sermonizing.
Even if not, this by-the-numbers basketball drama might be enough to put the fear of Samuel L. Jackson into you.
As real-life basketball coach and motivational speaker Ken Carter, Jackson barrels through this movie's Richmond, Calif., high school. His simmering performance has two, maybe three notes -- outraged disappointment, outraged joy, and outraged outrage -- but Jackson's been doing vexed long enough to wring emotion out of it. And he obviously believes in this story, which plays like a public service announcement for at-risk kids.
In 1997, Carter, who owned a local sporting goods store, took the position of basketball coach at Richmond High, an underserved school in a majority black and Hispanic community north of Oakland. Carter was a star player for Richmond in the 1970s and saw the job as an opportunity to reverse the team's losing record with a strict, brutally no-nonsense -- sorry, tough love -- approach to coaching.
He had his players sign contracts obliging them to wear jackets and ties on game days, sit at the front of their classes, and maintain a 2.0 grade-point average. Good grades, for him, were a requirement to play because they're key to having a meaningful professional future. So in 1999, when Carter discovered that a quarter of his Richmond Oilers were failing their classes, he famously locked the team out of the gym and canceled games, despite their undefeated record.
In "Coach Carter," the 12 or so players Carter inherits are an aimless band of bickerers who need to be whipped into shape. The coach's fitness (and discipline) regimen consists of push-ups and "suicides" (assaultive sprints from the baseline to half-court), which, over the course of the movie we see often. The players mock Carter's suits (they're churchy), his shiny pate, and his articulation. The team migraine, Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez), a pugnacious hothead, even takes a shot at the coach and is promptly manhandled and expelled from the team.
That's on the first day.
But as the hours roll on, we learn that Timo hates his extracurricular life as a drug dealer and sees basketball as a way to stay out of trouble. We see that Carter is such a good coach that his freshman son, Damien (Robert Ri'chard), pulls out of the best school in the area to be led by his father at Richmond. We discover that the star player, Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo), is barely literate and that Kenyon Stone (Rob Brown) a premiere student and a genuinely nice guy, has a pregnant girlfriend, played by the R&B songbird Ashanti, whose acting is much better than her dewy videos would lead you to expect.
The movie turns Carter's story into a gritty inner-city epic that's from-the-heart but unoriginal. The elements of urban black drama -- teen pregnancy, street shootings, miffed single parents, the token white character -- are all present. Life in this movie spins in a repetitive cycle: Every screwup is followed with recrimination, then punishment, then reconciliation. And for all the time we spend with these characters, very few of them are brought to life, though Brown and Gonzalez have real worry in their faces.
The director, Thomas Carter (who's not related to Ken), also made the Julia-Stiles-in-the-'hood romance "Save the Last Dance," and he tackles the same themes here, but with a more blatant "save the children" message. And Jackson is the ideal star to deliver a lecture with fire, brimstone, and panache, which he's demonstrated in everything from his DJ in "Do the Right Thing" and reformed hit man in "Pulp Fiction" to the besieged teacher in "187." In "Coach Carter," he delivers a castigating speech on the problem with kids who use the "n" word on each other. Any owner of "Jackie Brown" will recognize the powerful irony in that.
Eventually, Carter's principles get him in trouble with the principal (Denise Dowse), who can't understand why he bothers with the contracts and the lockout. The community also thinks canceling the games is an insult.
But the movie deserves credit for vocalizing a lot of awful, oft-cited numbers about graduation rates and the ratio of black men who attend college compared with those who wind up in jail. The only problem is that "Coach Carter" lays the problem at the feet of parents and a beleaguered school system, without bothering to complicate it.
Like "Crazy" Joe Clark, the New Jersey principal who kicked out a sizable portion of his student body en masse in the 1980s, Carter is a magnet for controversy. And like "Lean on Me," the 1989 movie about Clark's stint as a school official, the coach is always right and everybody else is wrong, wrong, wrong. But the parents and teachers whom Morgan Freeman's righteous Clark would shout down had a point: The man did seem insane. At least you know where Jackson's character is coming from.
My main worry about "Coach Carter," however, is this: Who's it for? How do you put this message across without it seeming medicinal? Sure, MTV is among the movie's producers, but what 11th grader wants to spend a Friday night being hit with such a blunt instrument?


         A story of wayward youth transformed by a pedagogical maverick, "Coach Carter" comprises another installment in the ongoing adventures of Superteacher, ghetto edition. Based on the story of an actual Richmond, Calif., high school basketball coach who benched his undefeated team until some of its members got their grades up, "Coach Carter" falls squarely in the group-Pygmalion tradition established by Sidney Poitier in "To Sir, With Love" and faithfully carried on by Morgan Freeman in "Lean on Me," Michelle Pfeiffer in "Dangerous Minds," as well as countless others, in which a lone-educator-who-cares rides into the mean streets of town to battle complacent parents, craven bureaucrats, low expectations and moribund systems, and single-handedly save the school day.
 
  As a tamer of the blackboard jungle, Samuel L. Jackson comes across as a little bit square himself, playing Carter strictly as the brand-new sheriff in town. Although he's not above the occasional wisecrack — Coach has a way with the targeted zinger — for the most part, he's a martinet of the drill sergeant/martial arts commando/Tae Bo instructor school. Though, to be fair, the actual Ken Carter has moved on to a career as a motivational speaker and self-help author, so for all I know the corny hardball inspirational stuff is dead-on. The real problem is not with Jackson's performance, anyway, it's with director Thomas Carter's and writers' Mark Schwahn and John Gatins' vision of the character; an archetype as workable, comfy and familiar as an old shoe. All good qualities in footwear, soporific in characters. While Jackson is nowhere near the absurd caricature played by Morgan Freeman in the hilariously over-the-top "Lean on Me," Edward James Olmos (whose dedicated math teacher in "Stand and Deliver" was a sly, subversively schlubby revelation) has nothing to worry about.
 


         






    The boys on the team are as cute as only thugs-who-are-just-scared-kids can be, and they infuse the movie's many rousing, heart-stopping game sequences and considerably less exciting scenes of teen drama with a kicky, adenoidal energy. This starts to flag toward the end, however, mainly because "Coach Carter" never really ventures past the standard cinematic clichés about inner-city youth to say anything new, or even to say anything old differently. "Coach Carter" skips insight and instead goes leaping for the dime bags and drug deals and drive-bys, oh my. If you've spent a week with CBS' prime-time lineup, you've heard this tune a million times. Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) gets all the best juicy, at-risk scenes, which he dives into with concentrated relish. But it would be great to see him cast radically against type sometime, in a role that didn't require him to nervously shove wads of bills in his pocket.
 
  After an early run-in with the coach, for instance, Cruz begs to be reinstated on the team, and Carter assigns him a near-impossible calisthenics load. In a classic "Spartacus" turn, the others pitch in to help, taking some extra push-ups for the team. This crystal-clear gesture is unnecessarily girded with a lengthy explanatory speech about the power of teamwork. As a movie, "Coach Carter" is not unlike your basic commencement ceremony: unassailable in its intentions, edifying in its speeches, reassuring in its outcome and terrifically long-winded. It's also as predictable as, though probably more insidious than, the private school version of the same story. Had "Coach Carter" been set at the kind of institution where boys wear crested blue blazers, the movie probably would have spelled redemption Y-E-A-T-S, and trumpeted as its gentle lesson the importance of stopping to smell the humanities once in a while. But "Coach Carter's" kids don't need poetry (or A.P. calculus, for that matter) so much as they need militaristic discipline and the transformative effects of repeated use of the word "sir."
 
  These things, Ken Carter supplies by the hearty lungful. A two-time Richmond High record holder, he sends his own studious freshman son, Damien (Robert Ri'chard), to the swanky St. Francis School, Richmond's rival. Damien wants to transfer, but dad isn't thrilled with the idea. "It was rough when I went here. It's way beyond that now," he says. By which he means he's now spending his days knocking kids who address him as "dawg" and get all up in his face against a wall. But Carter capitulates when the boy slides him a formal contract agreeing to maintain a 3.7 grade-point average. It's much like the one he's made one up for the team, only the players are shooting for a more modest 2.3. That's just 0.3 grade points higher than the school requires, but it's enough to prompt the requisite angry PTA meeting scene.
 
  I don't think it's giving away too much to reveal that despite initially reluctant kids, and the intrusions of unsupportive parents and boneheaded administrators, the triumph of the human spirit prevails. "Coach Carter's" intentions are, naturally, unimpeachable. And it does diverge from the standard movie morality in a pregnancy subplot involving the team's most promising student, Kenyon Stone (Rob Brown) and his girlfriend, Kyra (Ashanti). But something about once again seeing the cowboy ethos applied to a story about class and poverty in America rankles. (The San Francisco Chronicle reported last month that despite the real coach Carter's newfound success, "the team still struggles to buy basketballs.") So, while the movie at times warmed my own middle-class, private school-educated cockles to a toasty complacency, there's an undercurrent of friendly fascism running through it like a nasty draft. Everything I know about life in the inner city, I learned from the movies. And all the morals of the stories have been as tidy, consistent and well behaved as if coached by Carter himself.

In Coach Carter , Samuel L. Jackson plays one of those sternly compassionate inner-city teacher-demigods who have been a staple of movies for half a century, ever since Glenn Ford took over the leather-jacketed class of The Blackboard Jungle  (1955). It isn't difficult to see why this genre has persisted: Corny as it often is, there's a built-in gratification to watching a fearless and indomitable educational hero draft order out of chaos, winning over the troubled hearts and minds of kids who don't believe in themselves.
As Ken Carter, a self-made sporting-goods-store owner who returns to his alma mater of Richmond High  where he was the star hoopster 30 years ago  in order to whip the basketball team into shape, Jackson is playing a coach, a drill sergeant, and a tough-love academic whip-cracker rolled into one. The actor wears blocky ornate ties and beautifully cut suits that never quite let you forget his height, and he sports the jutting shaved dome that he brandished in Shaft  and the Star Wars  films. That shiny imposing head is all too appropriate, since Jackson's Carter is a stoic Jedi guru of discipline.
The moment he strolls onto the court, facing down a team of slovenly, aggressive misfits who (the film suggests) have grown up with too much hip-hop and not enough self-respect, Jackson rules the movie with his joyful  inflections; he uses the nimble music of his voice to turn threats into play. It's fun to see Carter dole out the punishment of hundreds of push-ups and ''suicides'' each time a team member dares to be late or, even worse, mouth off about it. For Coach Carter, however, it's not enough for the Richmond Oilers to find victory on the court. He insists that the players all sign contracts in which they agree to maintain 2.3 grade point averages; if they don't, they won't play. Eventually, when they are most of the way through an undefeated season but failing to fulfill that classroom bargain, he padlocks the gym and forces the Oilers to forfeit games until they get their academic act together. Suddenly, the city of Richmond, which had rallied behind Carter's success, wants his head.
Coach Carter  is based on a true story (the real Ken Carter locked out his team in 1999), but is there anything in movies less convincing than a high-school-ne'er-do-wells-get-down-and-study montage? It's a trick, admittedly, to show people learning math  though Stand and Deliver  (1988) made feisty drama out of it. The overly long and facile Coach Carter  doesn't; it presents as a victory of inspiration something that is, by nature, 90 percent perspiration. Jackson, though, does lend this earnest formula flick a core of conviction. It's actually his second teacher movie (after the misbegotten 187). Perhaps he'll eventually find one worthy of his voice.

s its title suggests, "Coach Carter" belongs, with recent pictures like "Friday Night Lights" and "Remember the Titans," to that special subcategory of sports movies, the inspirational coach drama. More often than not, movies of this kind are based on  -  or, in the more common title-sequence idiom, "inspired by" - the real lives of men who turn ragged bunches of misfits into champions, or at least contenders, teaching valuable lessons about discipline and teamwork along the way. Their stories, which march toward the big climactic game, pausing for uplifting speeches and off-the-field crises, are popular with audiences and also with actors. When they can no longer plausibly play professional athletes, male movie stars turn to on-screen coaching, which is rewarding and  -  in spite of all the yelling and speechifying  -  generally undemanding work. Gene Hackman did it in "Hoosiers," as did Denzel Washington in "Titans," Billy Bob Thornton in "Friday Night Lights," and, to stretch the category a little, Walter Matthau in "The Bad News Bears." And now Samuel L. Jackson joins their clipboard-thumping, my-way-or-the-highway company, playing Ken Carter, real-life coach of a high school basketball team in the tough Northern California city of Richmond. In this solid, unsurprising film, Carter, who was an all-American at Richmond High in the 1970's, has become a successful local businessman, with a sporting-goods store, a midnight-blue sedan and a tidy Craftsman bungalow. He also has a wife (Debbi Morgan), who in coach-movie tradition has a few early lines of dialogue, after which she is relegated to the sidelines, where she bites her lip and pumps her fists at appropriate moments. The coach's son, Damien (Robert Ri'Chard), has a bit more screen time; he's a promising point guard who transfers from a prosperous parochial school - which is also a perennial basketball powerhouse - to play for his dad in the run-down Richmond gym. "Coach Carter," directed by Thomas Carter (no relation to the coach) from a screenplay by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins, is both a rousing, by-the-book sports story - it's amazing how many games are decided by a dramatic shot at the final buzzer - and a critique of the place of sports in American culture. The dramatic climax comes not when Richmond wins a big game but when Carter, discovering that his players are faltering in the classroom, locks them out of the gym, an action that makes him a media celebrity and a local pariah. It also turns "Coach Carter" from a standard inspirational coach drama into an inspirational educator drama, putting Mr. Jackson in the company of actors like Morgan Freeman ("Lean on Me") and Michelle Pfeiffer ("Dangerous Minds"). These movies are not known for originality. Part of their appeal is the sturdy reassurance that their conventions offer, and the plot of "Coach Carter" provides very few surprises. Mr. Carter, a veteran of television whose most recent film was "Save the Last Dance," respects the sentimental rules of the genre, but his genuine interest in his young characters - in basketball, in hip-hop, in the anxious rhythms of teenage male friendship and sexuality -  gives the movie more realism, and more bounce, than it might otherwise have. To call Coach Carter's methods old school would be both a clich� and an understatement. Inheriting a multiracial squad of underachievers united in a spirit of hip-hop insolence, he wastes no time in laying down some strict new rules. To play for him, these young men - or "young sirs," as he calls them, with a hint of sarcasm - must show up on time to practice, wear neckties on game day and sign a contract promising to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. The punishment for talking back is several hundred push-ups or "suicides," those grueling cross-court sprints that bring special joy to the hearts of sadistic gym teachers across the land. Not that Carter enjoys inflicting pain on his players, though the grim smirk that sometimes plays across Mr. Jackson's stern features suggests that his character does not exactly share their misery. But it is, of course, for their own good. The educational system, represented by the harried, cynical principal (Denise Dowse) has all but given up on these boys, and the tough love of their coach may offer their only chance of escape from the poverty and despair that surrounds them. The off-court challenges they face are sketched in a series of subplots. Kenyon, a sweet-faced forward played by Rob Brown ("Finding Forrester") has impregnated his girlfriend, Kyra (the R&B singer Ashanti, making her film debut), which puts his athletic and academic ambitions in conflict with his impulse to do the right thing. Timo (Rick Gonzalez) is an angry, insecure young man sliding toward a life of gang-banging and drug dealing. Junior (Nana Gbewonyo), the team's center, can barely read a newspaper article chronicling his brilliant exploits on the court. Mr. Jackson acts with his usual steely authority - his Coach Carter is so convinced of his righteousness that he never needs to be nice - leaving it to the younger cast members to supply warmth and levity as they absorb his stern lessons. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Brown are especially strong, and Antwon Tanner, playing the team's designated joker, Worm, cuts the solemnity with impish wit. This may be the coach's story, but to the extent that "Coach Carter" is interesting rather than merely inspirational, it's because of the team. "Coach Carter" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity, sexual situations, some violence and underage drinking.

Embracing the story of a tough high school basketball coach who pushes young men to their limits, "Coach Carter" is both an inspirational sports movie and an unexpected multi-level urban drama that plays by its own clock. Since the true story of Richmond High coach Ken Carter involves far more than hoops, pic's adherence to the details, and willingness to follow characters wherever they go, account for a running time exceeding 2� hours. Younger urban auds enthusiasm may be questionable, but their parents and teachers will heartily endorse the self-improvement message, making for good theatrical B.O. followed by a 3-pointer in vid.
Carter's (and son Damien's) personal involvement in the production probably added a strong whiff of credibility to screenwriters Mark Schwahn's and John Gatins' on-the-nose dialogue and situations. Samuel L. Jackson, in the title role, lifts the film above familiar sports movie fare, however, imbuing a man who preaches the straight-and-narrow with magnetic appeal in portraying Coach Carter as an alluring rebel with equal parts charm and radical tough love.
Carter's at first hesitant to take over the hoops spot at his alma mater, given that the Richmond Oilers stink on the court and fight when off of it. Sensing diamonds in the rough, he takes the post anyway, and gets down to the business of showing the squad who's boss. Mouthing off is punished with calisthenics, the coach is always addressed as "sir," and, most crucially, each team member must sign a contract to maintain a minimum grade average, attend all classes, sit in the front row, and wear a coat and tie on game day.
With Jackson delivering the edicts, nearly everyone gets in line except Timo (Rick Gonzalez), whose rebelliousness gets him booted out -- and into the streets, where he deals drugs.
Director Thomas Carter (no relation) patiently follows the story's internal rhythms, devoting a good deal of screentime to the step-by-step drills and exercises that mold the squad into a winning team.
But helmer Carter also dwells on various off-court relationships, such as the one between Kenyon (Rob Brown), a good student with dreams of playing college ball, and pregnant g.f. Kyra (pop star Ashanti).
A certain dramatic neatness irons out what might have been a much more unkempt film: Just as the team pulls off a tournament upset, the coach discovers most of his boys are failing their classes.
His decision to shut down the gym, force the team to study in the school library and enrage the locals is what made the real Carter into a folk hero when his story broke in 1999. At this point, though, the film becomes perhaps more surprising: The press isn't made into a bunch of clowns, Carter's critics have their say and the teammates grow into solid student-athletes gradually, not instantly. An almost exact replica thematically of the finale in "Friday Night Lights" may be accidental, but is still uncomfortably similar.
Jackson rules the kids, but they hold up with hearty perfs by Brown, Gonzalez, Ashanti and Robert Ri'chard as the coach's son. Denise Dowse's by-the-rules school principal is mired in the script's most obvious points.
Even factoring the pic's unevenness and itch to preach, it reps a formal and thematic leap from the soft fare produced by sports-crazy Brian Robbins and Mike Tollin. Richmond's harshness is more suggested than real in a conservatively conceived production, with pro widescreen lensing by Sharone Meir. Some cool hip-hop selections make Trevor Rabin's score sound silly.

In the days following last November's election, I saw the best minds of my generation, starving hysterical naked, andjust as if there had never been a Jimmy Carter wondering where the Democrats could possibly find a liberal evangelical Christian to run for president in 2008.
Initially well regarded by his co-religionists and then (once they saw his support for an equal-rights amendment!) anathema, Carter is a key figure in the British tele-documentary With God on Our Side . Using archival clips and talking heads to track the rise of the religious right from the Cold War crusades of Billy Graham  ("Jesus taught the value of private property") through the creation of the Moral Majority and Pat Robertson 's 1988 candidacy, With God on Our Side  convincingly maintains that the evangelical movement reached its political apotheosis in the person of born-again prodigal son George W. Bush referred to by more than one admiring Christian as the "real deal."
The 100-minute doc, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4  on the eve of the U.S. election and opening here in time for the second Bush inaugural, argues that the evangelical vote provided both Reagan's victory margin in 1980 and Bush the Elder's in 1988. (No less than Carter, Bush I turned out to be too socially liberal for the religious rightan error that his son would not repeat.) Whether or not Moral Majority organizer Paul Weyrich  and spokesman Jerry Falwell , both of whom appear understandably smug, had a master plan to gain control of the White House , one can detect a certain dialectic: Just as Carter's authentic religiosity enabled Reagan's born-again pandering, so Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes made the world safe for Dubya's sketchy past.
With God on Our Side  (which was known, more humorously, as God Bless America  in the U.K.) is certainly not as incredulous or mocking as it might have been. If anything, the mood is apprehensive. But it's depressing thatCarter asidethe filmmakers failed to find even one liberal believer.
