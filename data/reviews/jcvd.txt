Pity the fool who underestimates Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. The Muscles From Brussels specializes in playing bulked-up butt kickers in whomp-and-release flicks happily derided the world over. But the clever, stylish perception-teaser of a comic drama JCVD   a reality-twisting cousin to Being John Malkovich   showcases a Van Damme who's sly like a fox about his own image. Here's a smart guy who has taken plenty of punches in life, fully aware of how close celebrity is to absurdity. No wonder the star's face, in deadpan repose, resembles that of Buster Keaton.
Van Damme plays an action star called Jean-Claude Van Damme (we see him doing his moves on a movie set) with a lot on his mind when the camera isn't rolling. Embroiled in a custody battle over his daughter, he sets out on a banking errand, accidentally interrupts a stickup in progress, and becomes another hostage. Movie-style maneuvers are useless, of course, against real bullets; what would a flesh-and-blood hero do? Sympathetic director Mabrouk El Mechri creates a marvelous netherworld of ambiguous scenarios, and Van Damme rises to the challenge  of acting   like the real pro he is. A–

 Steven Seagal is cutting off his ponytail. This bit of news — apocryphal, perhaps — has great significance for Jean-Claude Van Damme, the star, protagonist and leading ontological conundrum of “JCVD,” as well as a one-time rival of Mr. Seagal’s for the title of world’s second-best second-rate action hero. Mr. Seagal’s supposed sacrifice, a source of astonishment to this elfin Belgian muscleman, suggests a possible answer to the question posed in and by this odd, almost-clever film: what does an aging action-movie superstar have to do to keep himself in the game?  The real-world choices are limited. Keep going, oblivious to the ravages of time, in the pathologically stoical manner of Sylvester Stallone. Embrace self-parody and character roles in indie films, as Bruce Willis has so brilliantly done. Maybe become the governor of a large state or, failing that, a tough-talking cheerleader for Mike Huckabee.  You could always go back to Belgium — an option that works only if you came from there. This is what JCVD (as we’ll call the character, to distinguish him from the actor, Mr. Van Damme) decides to do, fleeing Hollywood in the wake of an ugly custody battle with his ex-wife and landing in his blue-collar, red-brick hometown outside Brussels. He may be seeking a simpler, more authentic way of life, but Mabrouk El Mechri, the director (and, with Frédéric Bénudis and Christophe Turpin, the writer) of “JCVD,” has other plans. A botched bank robbery traps poor  JCVD in a tense hostage drama, caught between a motley, semi-incompetent gaggle of crooks and the cops who think  he’s one of the bad guys.  Will this lurching, small-scale thriller blossom into a full-blown action picture, with Mr. Van Damme’s fists, feet and elbows enacting righteous payback on the villains? The possibility is teased whenever the tension starts to flag, but “JCVD” more often aims for a knowing, cerebral mood, allowing its hero moments of moody contemplation, during which he reflects on the strange, lonely life of a middle-aged, globally known martial artist.  Some of this is affecting, some of it tedious, and the film’s inconsistencies of tone are made more glaring by its peculiar look. Everything seems to be shot through a gold filter, making Mr. Van Damme look like an Oscar  statuette in a jaundice ward. The metallic visual texture is not only obtrusive but also baffling, since it undercuts the pseudo-documentary touches that are central to the conceit of pretending to show a “real” JCVD in his real homeland. If he had  wandered into a movie by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Belgium’s masters of no-frills proletarian realism and hand-held camerawork, now that might have been something to see.  Still, as a foray into self-mocking, self-aggrandizing career rehabilitation, “JCVD” shows some promise and holds some interest. It would hold more if Mr. Van Damme were not so fundamentally lackluster a celebrity, with a string of negligible movies to his name. While the filmmakers — and the star himself — gamely make fun of this legacy of mediocrity, they cannot quite escape it. This may well be the most memorable Jean-Claude Van Damme movie ever, but I’m afraid that’s not saying much.  “JCVD” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and some violence.

Van Damme is back! Combined with recent news that the Muscles from Brussels will soon turn auteur with "Full Love," Gaumont's "JCVD," a French-language meta-movie parody par excellence, constitutes the headiest stretch of the beefy star's career since, well, ever. Playing "himself," i.e., an international action stud whose bruising child custody battle has him literally going postal 
, exec-producing Jean-Claude Van Damme reveals heretofore hidden third dimension to his monosyllabic persona. Ho-hum hostage crisis mayhem serves to buttress co-scripting helmer Mabrouk El Mechri's more experimental stunts, including a tonally opposite pair of longish 
takes -- one a wonderfully absurd ode to star's 
martial-arts moves, the other a tear- and prayer-filled Van Damme monologue that 
must be seen to be believed. An adventurous U.S. minimajor could reap modest B.O. following a June 4 French release.
Playful from its first moments of a balloon-toting cartoon tot kickboxing in Gaumont logo, "JCVD" pumps up "I'm too-old-for-this-crap" cliches via shrewdly deployed in-jokes. Title character is revered for having "brought" John Woo to Hollywood with "Hard Target" in '93 ("He'd still be shooting pigeons in Hong Kong," an industry player opines), but on-set colleagues find fault with 47-year-old's mark-hitting skills. Worse, prosecuting attorney in hero's L.A. custody case dissects icon's eye-gouging oeuvre by DVD to assert dad's history of violence.
Freshly spurned by preteen daughter, jetlagged from trip back to Belgium, and electronically dissed at the hometown ATM, JCVD loses his cool while seeking a post-office wire transfer of euros, only to find he has stumbled into in-progress heist for which he'll be blamed by cops -- and credited, oddly or not, by hordes of placard-waving fans (e.g., "Free Jean-Claude!").
As before, bulky thesp's acting is as flat as his pecs are sculpted, but here said limitations are more clearly part of joke within hollow mirror world, where JCVD loses key role to Steven Seagal because latter negotiated to topline sans ponytail.
Script's sharpest running gag has the concept of celebrity trumping human life in media coverage if not public estimation; even JCVD's sweet old Maman 
hints at worries of son's marquee rep while mistakenly urging him to release "his" hostages.
Incalculably superior in tone, attitude, intent, and intellect to bulk of bodybuilder vehicles, shrewdly produced pic limits limber star's acrobatics to first and last scenes without great detriment to whole. Gast Waltzing's horn-heavy score is pleasingly old-school and subtly parodic; Philippe Kohn's sound mix is crisply immersive; Pierre-Yves Bastard's widescreen lensing does the job despite de rigueur color-bleaching and scant closeups with which to flaunt Van Damme's near-Buster Keatonesque deadpan. Exception to that to is aforementioned long take wherein weeping JCVD flexes existential about his status as global-screen limb-snapper with backend points.

Shown in the market last May at Cannes , Jean-Claude Van Damme 's JCVD  garnered a surprise critical cult. Audiences, midnight or otherwise, may never warm to this low-budget whatzit, but Van Damme's self-reflexive turn gave movie journalists plenty to mull over. Had Belgium 's contribution to international kick-sock-pow cinema been hanging out with Belgium's most famous filmmakers, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne ? Or pondering the paintings of René Magritte ?
JCVD  wastes little time working itself into a pretzel. The action begins under the credits with Jean-Claude working his way through a crazy urban battlefield accompanied by a Curtis Mayfield  blaxploitation ballad. As funny as anything in Tropic Thunder , this exceedingly long take ends with a falling flat (the aging actor having missed his mark) and a tantrum thrown by the movie's Chinese director. Van Damme, lest we forget, was partially responsible for bringing John Woo  to Hollywood  to make Hard Target  (1994). Back then, Sight & Sound  characterized Van Damme as "an actor of small range, not given to suggesting self-doubt." It's precisely those traits that JCVD  exploits.
Directed by Mabrouk El Mechri (whose previous feature Virgil  concerned an over-the-hill boxer), JCVD  holds a funhouse mirror to its star. Jean-Claude is next seen in family court fighting for custody of his daughter as his wife's attorney enters his DVDs as evidence against him. Suddenly, he's back in his Belgian hometown, making an inadvertent stir. "He left this shithole for Hollywood!" the people cry. Maybe so, but it's not long before he finds himself in a Jean-Claude Van Damme situation, held hostage in the local post office. Crowds of fans—eventually including his agitated actual parents—surge outside while the cops, who have set up a command center in the local video store, think that he's the hostage-taker. The movie, whose default style is a murky, sepia-tinged haze, keeps trying to start over. Thus, Jean-Claude is frequently on the phone begging his agent for better material, until the agent fires him on TV.
JCVD  is all about the hassle of being JCVD, but self-parody effectively precludes self-pity. In the most remarkable sequence, this hitherto limited actor launches into a lengthy soliloquy on his reasons for making this movie, explaining why he took up karate and recounting his feelings about celebrity (as well as America, women, and drugs). With its undercurrent of movie music and heartfelt clichés, Van Damme's confession would hardly seem out of place in a '60s Godard film. Back in Belgium to start his life over, the star despairs that he's done nothing worthwhile on this earth and fears he might die in the post office. It's near risible, but who would dare laugh? Jean-Claude is really crying!
Having visited the far side of the moon, JCVD  pulls itself together and reverts to action—after a fashion. The climax is a burst of chaotic, vérité-style confusion in which Jean-Claude kicks his way to freedom. While various characters take turns "acting," the film jumps anxiously in the projector, and the director himself sings the old Solomon Burke  lament "None of Us Are Free."
Van Damme's habitual lack of expression enables JCVD 's wild tonal swings. What exactly is JCVD ? Comedy? Confession? Confusion? No one will ever mistake these backstage shenanigans for Irma Vep  . But as a self-regarding expression of masculine angst, it's a Damme sight more fun than Synecdoche .
