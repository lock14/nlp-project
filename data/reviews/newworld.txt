         "THE NEW WORLD" is Terrence Malick's fourth film in 32 years, basically consolidating his position as the least prolific, most interesting director working today. The movie is both a continuation of his work so far and its culmination, which doesn't make it any easier to talk about. Words, actually, don't have much to do with the effect it has on the senses. Like his previous movies — "Badlands," "Days of Heaven" and "The Thin Red Line" — "The New World" doesn't resist interpretation so much as it wanders away from it in an incandescent brume of wonder, dread and awe. It's a primal experience about the experience of primacy, if you'll forgive the fancy tautology.
 
  If you won't, then you might be frustrated by the movie. There's bound to be — there always is — a range of reaction, just as, no doubt, the movie will be broken down by some into discrete components for greater ease of valuation. This, in my opinion, is a little akin to looking a gift horse in the mouth when you've never seen a horse before. Malick is an artist with a singular vision and the skill and support (one hopes) to realize it, and to apply conventional Hollywood standards to his films is to miss their point. He uses sound and imagery to create a vast sensory universe unfiltered through received notions, current politics or moral judgments and historical hindsight. He doesn't attempt to re-create a period so much as he tries to experience it for the first time, drawing human-scale characters against the enormous and cataclysmic backdrop of nature and history. What we get is not an "objective" or dispassionate view of the world but rather a series of subjective, experiential perspectives. He neither strives for verisimilitude nor spectacle but for an alchemic blend of both — life in all its power as it is experienced by sentient, sensitive beings.
 


         






    Captain John Smith (a very good Colin Farrell) travels to Virginia aboard one of three ships financed by the London Virginia Co. along with 102 other men in search of gold. What they find instead is an unspoiled Eden that inspires exalted philosophical reveries about the possibility of forming a new, enlightened society based on justice, equality and shared prosperity. The society Smith envisions, in fact, shares much in common with the society he encounters there, even if not all of the recent arrivals share his view. For their part, the natives' astonished reaction to the Englishmen who are slowly infiltrating their landscape is laced with concern that has yet to blossom into worry. The scene of their first encounter conveys more wonder and dread than any alien invasion movie could hope for, no matter how impressive its special effects.
 
  The brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki captures the grandeur and luminosity of the 1607 Virginia landscape in all its sensual glory, and Malick allows the experience to unfold like a slow dawn. Watching as scenes such as this one convey the strangeness and magnitude of human history and individual experience simply by pausing to observe, it's hard not to realize how little regard most contemporary films have for both. In all their rushing and jolting and artificial enhancement, most movies reveal a fierce anti-humanist streak, even a contempt for life — as though time were something to be sped up and wasted. But Malick is an explorer himself, with a talent for expressing the wonder of each new discovery.
 
  The colonists' initial elation is short-lived, however, as conditions worsen, food becomes scarce and the men struggle to survive. Smith leads an expedition in search of food up the Chickahominy River, and along the way his group is attacked by the Powhatan tribe. His life is spared when Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), the beautiful and spirited teenage daughter of the chief, intervenes on his behalf, and Powhatan agrees to let him remain and teach the princess his language. Powhatan hopes that this will provide him some insight into the settlers' intentions. But as Smith acclimates to life among the tribe, he soon finds his ideas about man and society starting to shift and even considers the possibility of staying on to live among them. It's not just that he's fallen in love with the princess, who passionately requites his feelings. The civilization of "the naturals," as the English call them, comes to represent for him the possibility of a new way of being, a rebirth.
 
  If the movie's dreamlike imagery, shifting inner monologues and sublime score by James Horner are best described as poetic, the movie's core is thoroughly philosophical. Malick is not interested in ferreting out psychological motivations to explain the movement of history, nor is he interested in passing judgment. Rather, he closely observes the ways in which love, death, war and nature act upon human beings. The story of "The New World" (and for that matter, of the New World) is a fundamentally Hegelian one; initial beliefs lead to their opposite, then to new beliefs that combine but transcend both. Even the love affair between Smith and Pocahontas, sensual and passionate as it is, can be understood in terms of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. For Malick, reality is cognitive, and thus ever-evolving, changing whenever it comes into contact with something new. So, for that matter, is filmmaking. While the version that will be released in New York and L.A. clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes, the wide-release version may yet be cut by 20 minutes.When Captain Smith finally returns to Jamestown from his idyllic sojourn among the Powhatan, he finds a lawless settlement turned startlingly feral and primitive by hunger and disease. Powhatan has instructed Smith to tell the settlers to leave, but they have planted corn in his absence, having earlier been given seed by Pocahontas. As they show no sign of departing, Powhatan orders an attack. Pocahontas betrays her tribe by warning Smith, and she is banished by her father and sold to the settlers as insurance against future onslaughts. Among them, she is slowly transformed into an Englishwoman, corseted, heeled and attended by a maid. Smith, meanwhile, is called back to England and tells a friend to tell her he has died. Pocahontas is overcome by grief and retreats into herself.
 
  As the settlement grows, a new arrival, John Rolfe (Christian Bale), takes an interest in her and asks her to help him cultivate tobacco on his farm. Rolfe falls in love with her and asks her to marry him, which the princess agrees to do. She does not immediately love him, however, and the scenes between them are halting and tender. After the birth of her son with Rolfe, Pocahontas learns that Smith is alive, and on a trip to England, where she is received and feted by the king and queen, Rolfe arranges for them to meet. Kilcher, Farrell and Bale are masterful in difficult, nearly nonverbal roles. The courtship scenes of Pocahontas and Smith, lyrical montages that must have been particularly challenging, are profoundly affecting, and Bale likewise is wonderful as the patient, understanding Rolfe, who risks losing his wife to provide her with the chance to choose between them.
 
  The scenes in England are as astonishing as the scenes in Virginia. An ambassador sent by Chief Powhatan to learn more about the English intentions and "meet this God they're always talking about," tours the sculptured gardens and topiaries of the royal court, marveling at the symmetrical trees and terraced gardens. Everywhere are straight lines and confined forms. It's a geometric world, where nature has been conquered and cultivated, representing the inverse and opposite end-point of a civilization, which seen through the eyes of the Powhatan ambassador looks startlingly strange and new. Like the creaky ships slowly shuttling the characters back and forth across the Atlantic, "The New World" is a work of breathtaking imagination, less a movie than a mode of transport, and in every sense a masterpiece.

 A New Line Cinema release. Written and directed by Terrence Malick. Produced by Sarah Green. Director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki. Editors Richard Chew, Hank Corwin, Saar Klein, Mark Yoshikawa.   

 Toward the end of Terrence Malick's elegiac film, "The New World," the young Indian princess known as Pocahontas - the "delight and darling" of her father, the king of the Powhatans of coastal Virginia - pauses in front of a gilt cage containing a live skunk. Brought from the New World to the Old in 1616, this morose creature, curled as tight as a fist, is being presented to the English court alongside a bald eagle, an Indian priest and Pocahontas herself. The princess, dressed in Jacobean costume, a ruff collar fluting around her throat, and played by the sublimely lovely newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher, looks both at ease and entirely foreign. When she sees this pitiful captive, does she see  any part of herself?  If that question is never answered in "The New World," it is because Mr. Malick, who wrote and directed the film, his fourth in three decades, never presumes to know the answer. For the filmmaker, who is more poet than historian, Pocahontas is clearly a metaphor (virgin land, as it were), but to see her as exclusively metaphor would only repeat history's error. What interests Mr. Malick is how and why enlightened free men, when presented with new realms of possibility, decided to remake this world in their own image: free men like Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell), who marvels at the beauty of a place where "the blessings of the earth are bestowed on all" while Indians lie bound in his boat, and who claims to love, only to destroy.  Smith, whose histories provide much of what is known about Pocahontas, was part of a contingent of some 100 men charged with founding an American colony on behalf of the London-based Virginia Company. In April 1607, three of the company's ships dropped anchor off the Virginia coast and a group ventured ashore. What they found, one of the actual settlers wrote in a near-swoon, were "faire meddowes and goodly tall Trees, with such Fresh-waters running through the woods as I was almost ravished at the sight thereof." The colonists had entered a paradise, but they were looking for gold and a river route to the South Seas, not meadows and trees. They found Indians, too, though in Mr. Malick's description of this mutual encounter, it was not a happy discovery for either party.  The filmmaker opens "The New World" with images of rippling water, swimmers shot from beneath and the woman we will soon come to know as Pocahontas as she utters what sounds like a prayer ("sing the song of a land"). After a brief credit sequence, James Horner's score gives way to chirping birds, blowing wind and what might be the rumble of distant thunder or a cannon blast. This cacophony then melts into the opening notes of the prelude to Wagner's "Das Rheingold," the first opera in "Der Ring des Nibelungen." A haunting drone meant to suggest the rippling of the Rhine River, the prelude begins as a whisper that grows progressively louder until it reaches a crescendo, signaling the moment when the Rhinemaidens realize that the Nibelung dwarf Alberich has forsworn love for gold and power.  The musical chords ripple with escalating intensity as Indians run along the shore, excitedly pointing at the three ships. With a restless, searching camera that finds realms of beauty in a single leaf and the downy hair on a woman's forearm, Mr. Malick gives us a palpable sense of what this unspoiled place must have looked like to the English, what was found and soon would be lost. Like Smith, we come to this new world slowly, first in intoxicating glimpses, then in sweeping vistas. A soldier and an autodidact, Smith escaped captivity in Turkey and was said to have read Machiavelli; Mr. Farrell's captain doesn't look like much of a reader (or a greedy dwarf), but he does look like trouble.  Soon after they land, the colonists shut themselves in a fort and raise a towering cross. Smith, meanwhile, charged with finding fresh supplies, is imprisoned by Indians, brought before Pocahontas's father (called Powhatan and played by August Schellenberg) and either almost killed or just seriously frightened. The story of Smith's brush with death, which may have instead been an initiation ritual, remains under dispute. Mr. Malick stages the scene like a hallucination, a freak-out with shadows and smoke. Smith wrote that Pocahontas, then between 10 and 12 - though here she looks dangerously older - begged her father to spare  the colonist's life. The purported rescue inspired myths about a romance, which in turn fed lurid fantasies about natives and the forces of civilization and helped fuel justifications for the domination of a land and its people.  In a gutsy move, the filmmaker represents this romance between Pocahontas and Smith as real, but only to flip it on its head. In quiet, drifting scenes set amid surreally beautiful wilds (the Virginia locations are paradisiacal) the two slowly circle each other like dancers, their respective interior monologues filling in the silence between them. In the past, Mr. Malick's fondness for voice-over has sometimes seemed like a crutch, symptomatic of a weak screenplay, as in his last film, "The Thin Red Line," or as a misplaced bid at naïve consciousness. Here, though, you feel as if you are eavesdropping inside the characters' heads. While Pocahontas's voice-overs are filled with schoolgirlish yearning, Smith sounds dangerously lofty, as if he is rehearsing the dissembling that will shape his later histories.  If the affair seems strangely ethereal, as if it were taking place in another dimension, in a lovelier, more enchanted realm, it is because Mr. Malick is fashioning a countermythology in "The New World," one to replace, or at least challenge, a mythology already in place. In Mr. Malick's interpretation, Pocahontas is no longer  the simple girl of Smith's fanciful imaginings or the acquiescent native who bows to take the English yoke, thereby making way for all the colonies to come and all the catastrophes perpetuated against native peoples. Pocahontas is still irrefutably "other"; for a filmmaker living 400 years later in another world and different skin, there is no alternative. He is still putting words into her mouth, but with scrupulous tenderness.  The story of Pocahontas has inspired poems and portraits, histories and biographies and a 1995 Disney animated feature in which the cartoon princess wears what looks like a very full C-cup. "Captain Smith and Pocahontas," Peggy Lee sang, "had a very mad affair." Ripe for discovery and exploitation, she is uncharted territory and she has always sent temperatures rising. But Mr. Malick's Pocahontas, while impossibly young (the mature-looking Ms. Kilcher was 14 when the film was shot), is also the agent of her own destiny, never more so than after she and Smith are separated. The two are parted just as Mr. Farrell's moony reveries threaten to drown Pocahontas's voice. Once he is out of the picture, though, she secures her voice and then a husband (an excellent Christian Bale), and ushers the story toward its shattering close.  The real Pocahontas died in England in 1617, probably of tuberculosis or pneumonia, between the ages of 20 to 22, in the presence of  her first or second husband. By then she was Lady Rebecca and had met Ben Jonson. At one time, her life may have been her own, but with her death that was no longer true. Like those Indian princesses who have long been a favorite of Hollywood, the pop Pocahontas who later emerged in song and cartoons is a comfortable fiction, at least for a country eager to tell its story in the best possible light. In that telling, Pocahontas is the noble savage exalted by an impulse to self-sacrifice for a white man. In Mr. Malick's telling, Pocahontas is a woman whose story has the reach of myth and the tragic dimension of life.  "The New World" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is some intense, bloodless violence and the beautiful underage lead actress may cause cardiac arrest among some viewers.

The skies surrounding Jamestown in "The New World" are almost invariably flat and colorless, a condition that unfortunately also describes the storytelling and dramatis personae in Terrence Malick's new picture. While the tale of first contact between Englishmen and the "naturals," as the Brits felicitously refer to the Native Americans, might seem to play to the strengths of the meticulous and unhurried director, Malick's exalted visuals and isolated metaphysical epiphanies are ill-supported by a muddled, lurching narrative, resulting in a sprawling, unfocused account of an epochal historical moment. The support of Malick loyalists notwithstanding, New Line will have trouble generating more than a modest commercial response.
"The New World" is just Malick's fourth film in a career that began 32 years ago with "Badlands." No one else's films look like his, and, Disney to the side, no filmmaker has ever chosen to take a serious look at the initial English incursion onto American soil, a period invariably encrusted by starch and must in history books.
Malick brings palpably alive the physical manifestations of the British presence in Virginia, beginning in 1607. Stirringly beginning with the opening strains of Wagner's "Das Rheingold," written to evoke a river's swirling and the emanation of life from it, the film presents without preamble the arrival of three British ships like a cascading wave upon the shore.
Without a clue what to expect, the Englishmen remain cautiously reserved as the naturals scamper about, hoot, talk and even sniff and touch them before retreating back into the sylvan wilds. Sequence has a freshly charged, even humorous aspect that holds considerable promise.
White contingent is led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) who, as he strides upon the land, summarily releases Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) from his death sentence (for unexplained "mutinous remarks") and appoints him to lead an expedition to the natives' compound. Along the way, the other men are killed while Smith is captured, only to spared at the last minute by Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), the teenage daughter of the Powhatan tribal king (August Schellenberg).
The months that follow constitute the heart of the matter for Malick. In each of his films, but especially in "Days of Heaven" and the early section of "The Thin Red Line," the director has excelled at evoking nature in its pure state, from the sensual swaying of grass and wheat in the former to the intoxicating qualities of the tropics in the latter. Here, there is an Adam-and-Eve-like quality to the playful, sensual but not precisely carnal frolicking of Pocahontas (Kilcher was 14 when pic was shot) and the Englishman twice her age who falls under the spell of a culture so very different from his own.
Although the storyline has been fictionalized, at least in regard to the romance between the leading characters, the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to achieve authenticity on the production side. Lensing along the Chickahominy River very close to the original Jamestown settlement, Malick, production designer Jack Fisk, costume designer Jacqueline West and all other hands have fashioned a convincing version of indigenous American life 400 years ago that has a gratifyingly hand-tooled feel. When Fort James is first seen, its ugliness truly resembles a scar upon the land.
But the film's impact begins and, disappointingly, ends with these tactile, impressionistic effects. Minimalizing dialogue in favor of mostly unilluminating voice-over narration from Smith, Pocahontas and, later, newly arrived Englishman John Rolfe, screenwriter Malick (who first penned the script 25 years ago) can't get inside the heads of any of his characters and fails to establish a connection for the audience.
While Kilcher's girl/woman charm, poised naivete and intriguing unfamiliarity lend Pocahontas a considerable fascination, Smith remains grievously underwritten for a leading role. One hasn't a clue what drives him, what he might have left behind in England, whether or not he's a trustworthy character (or narrator) with a good heart. Under the circumstances, Farrell can't do much more than interact in an agreeably spontaneous way with his leading lady. Thesps in lesser roles register hardly at all.
Pocahontas is said to have been one of many children of the king, but there is no attempt to delineate the native group's family or power structure, or this tribe's relationship with its neighbors. Explicit exposition may not be Malick's thing, but the lack of moorings has the predictable effect of leaving the viewer adrift in what shapes up as the director's most literal, albeit not overly didactic, depiction of the despoiling of Eden.
Before long, pic falls into an ill-formed midsection marked by muddled action, abrupt transitions and a lulling torpor. With Newport having sailed back to England for more supplies and manpower, the English settlement languishes but revives upon Smith's return. Once Powhatan figures out that the Brits plan to stay, he prepares for battle with them. He's foiled, however, by his favorite daughter, who warns Smith, leading to her exile from the tribe and adoption by the English.
Just as Smith's embrace of native ways made for unusual moments, so does Pocahontas' slow Anglicanization stir modest interest, although in a sadder way, with her natural manner literally constricted by the European clothes she wears. Told Smith is dead, she at lengthmarries tobacco grower Rolfe (Christian Bale), who later takes her to his homeland.
This development momentarily proves stimulating, as Malick is wonderfully adept at showing England from an innocent's point of view, with its dark wet stone and formal gardens contrasting starkly with the new world's lush land and untamed foliage.
Along with the dramatic shortcomings, pic surprisingly disappoints somewhat on the visual side as well. To be sure, Malick and ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have come up with some arresting, original and mobile images. But the combination of the overwhelmingly dull skies with the decision to film entirely without electric lights serves to drain a lot of the color and interest from the frames, especially compared to what the director achieved in "Days of Heaven" and "The Thin Red Line."
In the end, there is also a feeling of pictorial repetition of what Malick has done before, particularly in the reliance on nature shots; more than once, one is made to recall the old saw about how, if a scene isn't cutting together, you cut to a seagull flying overhead. With this and the heavy narration, one senses a certain artistic treading water, the opposite of what the churning waterborne motifs of "Das Rheingold" are meant to suggest.
The repeated Wagner excerpt remains the dominant musical signpost of the film, much as the Saint-Saens "Carnival of the Animals" extract was for "Days of Heaven." Among other pre-existing music, Mozart plays a leading role, and James Horner's original contributions to the score are discreet and dramatic.

The New World  has an imposing science fiction title, but Terrence Malick 's long, moody, diaphanous account of love and loss in 17th-century Jamestown shot, more or less, on locationrarely achieves the symphonic grandeur it seeks. As an epic, it's monumentally slight.
Malick's retelling of the Pocahontas story known to every American youngster (but generally underleveraged by American artists) begins with the image of the sky reflected in the water and the sound of a child's incantation. Virginia 1607: The wooden ships arrive, the music swells, and the members of the indigenous Powhatan tribe are amazed. (It's Wagner!) As the English glide inland through the marsh, the "naturals" materialize around them, touching and barkinguntil one Englishman gets nervous and discharges his gun.
Eden is not yet lost. The dashing adventurer Captain John Smith  (Colin Farrell ) ventures deeper into the swamp, is captured by the uncanny Powhatan and saved from death by the chief's lithe and lively daughter Pocahontas (the remarkably poised, 14-year-old Q'orianka Kilcher). The historical Pocahontas encountered Smith when she was around 11 and he was nearly 30; Malick acknowledges this by making his exotic-looking heroine somewhat more kittenish than the sloe-eyed buckskin babe of the 1995 Disney  animation.
Pocahontas is smitten with the brooding Englishman; her father is more practical: "He can teach her about his land beyond the sea." This rustic spectacle is not quite a bore but not exactly a myth. Where The New World  begins by evoking Werner Herzog 's masterful conquistador quest Aguirre, the Wrath of God , it soon settles down in the neighborhood of Kevin Costner 's sappy Dances With Wolves . Smith contemplates the Powhatan natural paradise of fabulous body paint and spontaneous hippie dances, not to mention a daily regimen of chaste nuzzling with young Miss P, and his appreciation burbles over: "They have no jealousy, no sense of possession."
Heavily aestheticized, The New World  is also timidly genteel. Whatever the historical truth, the basis of the Pocahontas myth is a utopian dream of love in the woods and reconciliation between America's warring races. This desire was rationalized once Pocahontas, the most successful example of intermarriage in American mythology, was integrated into colonial and even British society. Indeed, the Indian princess was, for a time, a national iconthe American equivalent of France's Marianne. But ours is not, at least officially, a creole culture. In the 20th century, second-tier American poets (Hart Crane , Vachel Lindsay , Carl Sandburg ) evoked Pocahontas as a fertility goddessand so does Malick when she arrives in wintry Jamestown and suddenly brings the spring.
The settlers, like Smith, survive thanks to Pocahontas's generosity. But the improved weather doesn't help the movie much. Scarcely as rhapsodic as its prologue, The New World  settles into a languid rut. All is diffuse, gauzy, insubstantial, underwhelming. The structure feels amorphousdespite Malick's attempts to renew his film language with odd angles, sudden blackouts, and modulated jump cuts. Malick's remarkable, transcendentalist adaptation of The Thin Red Line thrived on the tension between horrible carnage and beautiful, indifferent "nature." The New World  wakes from its trance, albeit briefly, when the Powhatan attack Jamestown.
Ultimately it is not Smith but Pocahontas who goes native. (At least Malick presents white juju as no less weird than the natural variety.) Smith leaves and is replaced in the movie by kindly widower John Rolfe  (Christian Bale ). If anything, this John's stream of consciousness is even more banal than his predecessor's: "She weaves all things together," he muses of the dusky, now suitably corseted princess whom he has begun to woo. (And her soul replies: "He is like a tree, he shelters me.") The two marry and are presently summoned to England for a royal audience. In a cut worthy of a Griffith two-reeler, Malick shows Smith wandering disconsolate on a rocky beach in the company of some Inuit lass.
"Did you find your Indies, John?" Pocahontas asks when they meet once more (in a formal garden) toward the end of her remarkable life. "I may have sailed past them," Captain Smith mumbles meaningfully. So too Malick: The New World  scarcely lacks for ambition, but to provide the disorientation the filmmaker courts, he would need the restraint of Bresson or the chops of Tarkovsky. Some 25 years in the making, The New World  offers only a glimpse of an unattainable realm that fades into the mist even as you search for it.
