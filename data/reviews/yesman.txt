Yes Man
 opens with Carl (Carrey), a bank loan officer, in a funk, avoiding his friends, brooding at his job, and spending every evening slumped on his sofa watching DVDs. Not exactly depressed, Carl just greets the world with either a sigh or a wince. Then an old acquaintance, Nick (Higgins), the embodiment of the word �gusto,� pushes Carl to attend a self-help seminar led by motivational guru Terrence Bundley (Stamp). Terrence's message, much like his beige yet shiny leisure suit, is banal yet will glint through the consciousness of every �I�d prefer not to� Bartelby sitting in the audience. The life-changing mantra? Say �yes� to every opportunity that presents itself. This plot gimmick veers suspiciously close to the 1997 Carrey vehicle Liar Liar
, in which his character compulsively tells the truth, even though supernatural intervention is the cause. In contrast, Yes Man
 believes in free will, with Carl at first struggling to agree to requests small and large, whether it be friends getting him to pick up the bar tab or a homeless person asking for a ride. But soon he�s showered with rewards, including a pretty new girlfriend played by actor/singer Deschanel, who�s wide-eyed and good-hearted but without a lot of range � a fair description of the film itself. A repeated motif has Carl learning a random skill (Korean lessons? Sure!), which a few scenes later turns out to be precisely what he needs to solve a problem (a surly Korean saleswoman) and make everyone happy. As the good results roll in and Carl starts uttering �yes� without hesitation, Yes Man
 becomes less a story and more a collection of set-pieces. True, the scenes are often amusing, and a good dose of ad-libbing keeps the tone appealingly wobbly. Although Deschanel proves to be generally engaging � her art-rock band performance is a hoot � she sometimes seems to just go blank, while Stamp, voice booming and eyes narrowing, wrings what he can out of his two scenes. Carrey does his usual job here, but it�s not enough. The New Zealander Darby, from The Flight of the Conchords
, whisks the film out from underneath Carrey�s nose with his consistently funny turn as Carl�s nerdy, needy boss, Norman. Nevertheless, Yes Man
 proves utterly formulaic. Is there a feel-good gathering of everyone Carl has helped? Is there a trumped-up romantic crisis? Is there a mad crosstown dash? You guess the answers.


In "Yes Man," Jim Carrey plays Carl, an antisocial Los Angeles bank-loan officer who agrees to stop saying "no" - to friends, strangers, co-workers, the homeless; to fun, life, Mormons, even the horny old lady (Fionnula Flanagan) in his apartment complex. He twists, shouts, does a round of Dance Dance Revolution, plans a bridal shower, attends what must be the last rave in California, learns Korean, goes to a Harry Potter costume party, and courts Zooey Deschanel.
Yet the joys of affirmation appear lost on Carrey, who never looks truly happy. It's entirely possible that I'm projecting my forced smiles onto Carrey's face. But he seems to hold this entire exercise (it is, alas, a workout) in contempt. Perhaps he thought he was through with these high-concept, one-note comedies, having failed to top the physical genius of "Liar Liar" in 1997, and having made a mild breakthrough of sincerity in 2003's "Bruce Almighty."
While Carrey was off exploring his dramatic range in movies as radically different as "Man on the Moon," "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," and the execrable "The Number 23," the landscape for movie clowns changed. He does not belong to the fraternity that has come to dominate Hollywood comedy in this decade. Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, on one hand, and the writer-director-producer Judd Apatow, on the other, share a franchise on the genre. It's strange to say, but Carrey is an outsider in a rambunctious style he helped create. For "Yes Man," he turns in what feels like a Jim Carrey impersonation - 104 minutes of high-energy heartlessness.
The gist of it all is that Carl must carpe his diem. He attends a seminar led by a yes guru (Terence Stamp, comically smug) where everyone around Carl is happy (or something like it), so why shouldn't he be, too? In our pharmaceutical age, there's probably a great farce to be made about emotional conformity. This movie, directed by Peyton Reed and adapted from Danny Wallace's novel by three writers, feels made from quirky-comedy instant mix: just add heart. It's a cynical attempt, ultimately, to make obnoxious people palatable by throwing them into a tub of romantic comedy.
Casting Deschanel as The Girl is not the wonderful stroke it once was. Between this film and "The Happening," she seems more warmed over than Carrey. Deschanel glides through "Yes Man" with a cute haircut and cuter clothes, fronts a band called - quirk alert #1! - Munchausen By Proxy (they have a semi-funny song about booty calls), and - quirk alert #2 - teaches a jogging photography class. We've seen her scoot through this part before in "Elf" and "Failure to Launch." There are probably a dozen better ways for her to spend her time (although few as lucrative), so it seems too soon for her to be on autopilot. For one thing, where's her "Yes Woman"?
That, of course, is the biggest problem with this movie - not that it's mediocre, dull, or barely written (though it's guilty on all counts). It's that Carrey himself is miscast. This is a star-making part as opposed to a part for a star committing a repeat offense. I watched Carrey ride a Ducati motorcycle in a hospital gown during the climax of this movie and thought about how much more fun it would have been to see a fresher face (Michael Cera's, Robert Pattinson's, or Paul Dano's) do that and all of Carl's exclamatory slapstick, to see someone care enough to make a character out of this.
If Carrey looks resentful or bored, it may be because he's made things too easy for himself. He doesn't have to worry about breaking character in "Yes Man." He's not playing one.


Carl (Jim Carrey), a loan officer so morose he needs to have his arm twisted to go for drinks with friends, is ripe for conversion by a self-help guru (Terence Stamp) who orders him to say ''yes'' to everything. Soon he's giving cash to a bum, learning Korean, talking a man off a ledge, and wooing a punk rocker (Zooey Deschanel) he would never have met without his new ''philosophy.'' This is basically a nerd-loosening-his-tie romantic comedy done in the manic-compulsive mode of Liar Liar . It has more chuckles than guffaws, though, maybe because Carrey has always been a comic actor who says yes yes yes . Literalizing that impulse only robs it of surprise. B–

 At the beginning of “Yes Man,” Carl Allen is a grouch, a curmudgeon, a wet blanket.  His relentless negativity — his job as a loan officer provides him with plenty of opportunities to say no  — is less a matter of temperament than of circumstance: apparently Carl never recovered from the breakup of his marriage. But then a visit to a self-help seminar led by a guru (Terence Stamp) who preaches the power of yes transforms Carl into a wild, unpredictable fellow, a giddy, spontaneous goofball, a gangling, motormouthed, rubber-faced id. In short, Carl turns into Jim Carrey.  But “Yes Man,” dutifully directed by Peyton Reed (“Bring  It On,” “Down With Love”) is too sluggish and slapdash a vehicle for its star’s prodigious wackiness. The movie’s premise is not far from that of “Liar Liar,” one of Mr. Carrey’s biggest hits of the mid-’90s, in which he played a chronic dissembler suddenly compelled to tell the truth. That film was a philosophical tour de force compared  with  this one, which arrives at the startling conclusion that while saying no to everything is bad, saying yes to everything is not ideal either.  Most of us learned at least a rudimentary version of this lesson around the age of  5, and one of the many problems with “Yes Man” is that it is insufficiently infantile. Mr. Carrey looks too grown up, too tired to plunge into the reckless silliness that the story demands, and the story doesn’t really demand enough of it. Once Carl has banished no from his vocabulary, what does he say yes to? Flying lessons. A class in conversational Korean. Every loan application that crosses his desk.  That last bit has a somewhat unpleasant, if inadvertent, topical resonance, but never mind that. Some of the things Carl does are a bit wilder than learning to play the guitar. He accepts a sexual proposition from an elderly neighbor, which leads to a gag that was already tired when it popped up in “Soul Men” a few months ago. He wraps his head in cellophane tape. He goes on a Red Bull binge. He provokes a fight in a bar after snorting some Tabasco sauce.  And he falls in love with a pale-eyed, mildly eccentric cutie named Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel, who took on similar waif duties opposite Will Ferrell in “Elf.” The role of Mr. Carrey’s romantic counterpart is never an easy one, given his manic energy and the childish narcissism that is the basis of his shtick. Only Kate Winslet, engaging with a more subdued incarnation of Mr. Carrey in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” has been able to distract him from himself. Ms. Deschanel never really has a chance, and instead functions as a kind of sidekick, breezing through some semi-funny set pieces on the way to an obligatory smiley-teary ending.  Mr. Carrey has some good moments, as do a few of the supporting performers, notably Bradley Cooper as Carl’s best friend and Rhys Darby as his socially maladroit boss. But “Yes Man” rarely rises to genuine hilarity. It takes no risks, finds no inspiration and settles, like its hero, into a dull, noncommittal middle ground. Should you see this movie? Maybe. Whatever. I don’t care.  “Yes Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, sexual references and brief nudity. 

In the spectrum of Jim Carrey vehicles, �Yes Man� hews closest structurally to �Liar Liar,� offering the rubber-faced comic actor plenty of opportunities to riff -- but with far too few moments that approach the explosive hilarity of that earlier movie. Genial but slim, pic is certainly a light-hearted alternative to weighty year-end awards bait, but the conceit isn�t realized fully enough to ensure the affirmative response Warner Bros. would doubtless like to hear. As is, it�s more in the realm of a definite �maybe.�
Carrey is introduced as Carl Allen, a sad-sack bank-loan officer who still hasn�t recovered emotionally from his divorce three years before. Although his pals Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) try to nudge him out of his shell, Carl�s answer to virtually every overture that involves anything but staying home and renting DVDs is an evasive �no.�
A chance encounter with an old acquaintance inspires him to attend a self-help seminar, where a steely-eyed guru (Terence Stamp) preaches the power of saying �yes� to every opportunity -- forging a covenant with the shell-shocked Carl to adhere to this simple code.
To his surprise, the �just say yes� strategy yields welcome results -- and equally significant, failing to do so invites disaster. Carl�s grudging agreement to assist a homeless guy, for example, inadvertently brings about his introduction to Allison (Zooey Deschanel), a free spirit to whom he�s instantly drawn (in a faint echo of �Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind�) -- and thanks to his newfound attitude, with whom he�s very much in tune.
Similarly, unquestioningly approving bank loans to eccentric characters -- the timing of which could probably be better, given the present mortgage meltdown -- benefits Carl in unexpected ways, if not quite triggering the logical �pay it forward� scenario that would help lend ballast to this slender premise.
Instead, director Peyton Reed (�The Break-Up�) -- working from an adaptation of Danny Wallace�s book by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel -- lets the movie lapse into an uneven, episodic mode. That format yields the occasional juicy bits (Carl thwarting a suicide attempt; an interlude with his aged neighbor, played by Fionnula Flanagan), but not enough of them to sustain the level of manic energy Carrey can unleash at his best. Almost too conveniently, the propositions thrown Carl�s way also generally avoid anything that�s so uncomfortable as to risk brushing up against the limitations of a PG-13 rating.
In terms of concocting laughs, Carrey receives minimal help other than from Rhys Darby (HBO�s �Flight of the Conchords�) as his nerdy boss, who has a fondness for idiotic nicknames and throws movie-themed parties seemingly catering to fringes of the Comic-Con crowd. (Those scenes amusingly if somewhat conspicuously showcase Warner Bros. properties, including the �Harry Potter� franchise -- also from �Yes Man� producer David Heyman -- and �300.�)
From a technical standpoint, the movie makes unusually good use of Los Angeles landmarks as a backdrop for Carl and Allison�s budding romance, from the Hollywood Bowl to the Griffith Observatory. Mark Oliver Everett of the band Eels collaborated on the score and contributes several songs.
Mercifully, �Yes Man� finally arrives at a place that lets a bit of air out of the pervasive self-help bubble. It�s only too bad that the movie isn�t slightly more adept at helping itself.



Not the Liar Liar  sequel it looks like in the trailer, but close enough: Jim Carrey  plays a self-absorbed Debbie Downer  named Carl Allen  who green-lights every bad decision in an effort to reinvent his sorry life. And, hey, it works! Really well, because his first terrible decision—to give a homeless man all his money—turns out to be a stroke of good fortune, as Carl is rescued by perky, spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel ), a singer in an avant-rock band called Munchausen by Proxy and the instructor of a jogging-photography class. How quirky! Theirs quickly blossoms into a romance defined by its random acts of wackiness, including a flight to Lincoln, Nebraska  . . . just because it's there. Inevitably, Carl winds up in the stands of a Nebraska-Oklahoma football game, his body covered in red and white paint. See what saying "yes" to anything will get you? Turns a 46-year-old man into a frat boy. (See also: Will Ferrell .) After Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and even 2005's Fun With Dick and Jane  remake, Carrey seemed destined for far more grown-up roles; he'd transitioned from the slapshticky surreal to the unexpectedly real. But Yes Man  is nothing more than warmed-over holiday seconds, a repackaged best-of for those who already own the hits.
