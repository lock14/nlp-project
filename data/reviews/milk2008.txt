In the making of a gay rights icon lies a tale of civic action
In 1972, when he was in his early 40s, Harvey Milk came to San Francisco from New York as part of a wave of gay men and women looking to live openly. The radical new film Gus Van Sant has made of Milk's life gets right down to business. Not far into "Milk," Harvey picks up a stranger in a stairwell. It's Harvey's birthday, and the stranger, Scott Smith, is an uninterested young man whom he works hard to persuade.
Sean Penn plays Harvey, James Franco is Scott, and Penn fully avails himself of Milk's reserves of charm. His hair grown out in waves, the actor re-creates Milk's high, soft speaking voice and, with a few sentences and some down-turned glances, puts across a gallery of contradictions - bashfulness and extroversion, confidence and doubt, lust and restraint. Smith goes home with him almost out of curiosity. You get a glimpse of what, in part, would make Milk, a banker by trade, such a good elected official; he was a gentle but committed seducer.
Van Sant follows them to Harvey's, shooting their first "date" in tight, almost lilting close-ups in which facial expressions and body parts flicker by, swaddled in the mischievous "la-la-las" in Danny Elfman's score. The sequence sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Van Sant wants us to see Milk the way Milk saw himself, both in that moment and in the relationship that grows out of it - as a sexual being teeming with love. This opening also leaves no doubt about the explicit nature of the political odyssey on which Milk winds up embarking: This is what they do in their bedrooms. The sex is a private but inextricable extension of a larger human-rights issue.
By nearly every measure, "Milk" is a beautifully made, far less conventional movie biography than most. Van Sant, working from a screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, isn't simply telling the story of a politician. He has undertaken an expanding cultural portrait. The focus grows from a man to a street to a neighborhood to a city to a country. It would have been easy for Van Sant to turn Milk into a cause for righteousness, to let the politics indignantly overwhelm the film. But Van Sant doesn't preach to the choir. He doesn't preach at all. For that matter, neither does Milk.
For Milk, politics sprouted from necessity. Despite opening a camera shop on Castro Street, increasingly the center of gay San Francisco, he and Scott were barred from the neighborhood business association and decided to start their own. There Harvey gets a taste for the power of activism. He announces his first campaign for city supervisor while standing on a box with "soap" stenciled on the side and assembles a campaign staff of much younger, average-looking guys - apostles - who work as hard as their boss.
Harvey even plucks one kid, Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), off the street. Harvey obviously finds him cute, but Cleve also happens to have sharp campaign instincts. These men and, eventually, a young, fiercely permed lesbian named Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) fight to get Harvey elected (it takes a couple of tries). The last campaign costs Harvey his relationship with the long-suffering Scott. As an elected official, his cause becomes defeating Proposition 6, a bill that would legalize firing openly gay teachers and school employees who supported gay rights.
The bill needs the support of the other supervisors, and Harvey goes after a stressed-out, conservative family guy named Dan White (Josh Brolin), who will eventually kill both him and Mayor George Moscone. Harvey thinks White might be gay. White seems jealous of Harvey's popularity and political success. There's great psychological tension in Brolin, a good actor whose performances always have charisma but rarely much heart. This is the warmest he's ever been in a movie. He dares you to have pity on White.
White's envy would have been understandable. Milk was a natural leader. The movie makes it hard not to see in him a little of Barack Obama 
or vice versa. The similarities are chilling at times. They both ran as agents for change, a message that drew people to them, especially the young, and managed to win the support of folks in spite of their own bigotry. What you're able to see is how far the country has come in four decades and how far it hasn't. The day of Obama's victory, voters also supported gay marriage bans in three states. Go figure.
As Milk, Penn captures what made the man and the official so magnetic. A lot has to do with the smile that frequently breaks across his taut, lined face. I can't recall a piece of acting where that expression has managed to put across as much as it does here. Rightly or not, you expect Penn to blow the house down, the way he did in "Mystic River" and "All the King's Men." This time the Big Bad Wolf is really a sheep.
What's surprising about "Milk" is how much creative fun Van Sant has under the serious circumstances. The movie makes clever use of archival footage with anti-gay activist Anita Bryant and of men privately gathered in bars. He and his ingenious cinematographer Harris Savides shift film stocks and camera formats. A rallying telephone call from Cleve breaks the screen into at least 25 frames. And the climactic shooting is an eerie remix of the high-school massacre in Van Sant's best movie, 2003's "Elephant."
"Milk" is also as immersed in civic process as it is in sexual congress. How ironic that a filmmaker who so often breaks the established rules of storytelling and invents his own would make a movie so riveted by the passing of laws. Some of these sequences feel like moments from the great Frederick Wiseman's social documentaries.
Not everything works. Diego Luna, as Harvey's unstable post-Scott boyfriend, appears to have wandered over from some drunken college production of Pedro Almodovar's "Bad Education." And the decision to structure the film around a premonitory recording Milk made not long before his murder deprives the film of its momentum but never to the point of ruining what's remarkable about the movie itself.
Van Sant, who is openly gay, rarely uses movies for direct politics. Until now, the homosexuality in his movies was more sudden, random, and homoerotic - kisses here, glances there. "Milk" changes that. It's the rare major film dealing with homosexuality that doesn't orbit around the closet. The men are mostly, proudly out. And Van Sant himself doesn't hold much back - even the appearance of a Judy Garland song chills the soul. Playing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" requires a certain gumption. But the song has never sounded more like a hymn than it does here.


For a gay leader who rose out of the low-rent pleasure-dome bohemia of San Francisco's Castro district in the 1970s, Harvey Milk came off as a fairly ''straight'' shooter. Running for the board of supervisors (the equivalent of the city council), the Long Island-born Milk cultivated a respectable, slightly stuffy look and demeanor  the three-piece suits, the shock of hair he wore like a mildly rebellious English professor  that worked as a strategy: He wasn't about to let anyone peg him as some hippie-homosexual degenerate (at least, not by 1977, when he had already lost three elections). But Milk's squareness was more than a mask. It said: Here, at long last, is a gay politician who's out of the closet yet knows how to work the system. What Milk's ebullient smile beamed to the world was how good it felt for an activist to lay his hands on power.
In Milk , Gus Van Sant's incisive and stirring dramatization of Harvey Milk's heroic life and violent death, Sean Penn inhabits those suits with a slightly awkward body language  a nerd's stiffness  that is touching to behold, because it's so jarringly expressive. When Milk stands before a crowd of demonstrators and waves his arms, out of some combination of wanting to inspire and not knowing where to put those arms when he speaks, he's a true man of the people: a noble schmo thrust into history because he realizes that if he doesn't lead, no one else will. Penn does an imitation of Milk's Lawn Guyland Jewish whine that's a bit more fey than that of the actual public Harvey Milk. But the theatricality of Penn's acting works as a brilliant projection of Milk's playful intellectual spirit  his fighter's joy.
Milk  is a fascinating film  more docudrama than biopic  because, as staged by Van Sant, from Dustin Lance Black's deft screenplay, it immerses us in the political process. Milk, a Bay Area camera-store proprietor, doesn't choose politics; it chooses him when he sees that even in San Francisco, gays are treated like third-class citizens. Once he gets elected supervisor, the movie is devoted to his attempt to defeat Proposition 6, a statewide measure to ban gay teachers that Milk seizes on as a key issue of civil freedom. With Miss America runner-up–turned–antigay crusader Anita Bryant as his foil of intolerance, Milk isn't just fighting for ''rights.'' He's leading a cultural crusade. The movie shows you what a shrewd politico he is (he uses beer boycotts, dog-poop laws, anything that works), and it's creepy to see him forge a rickety alliance with Dan White (Josh Brolin), the conservative Catholic supervisor who, like Milk, gets elected thanks to a new district-divided voter map. Brolin makes White a dim politician and hooded soul in a world changing too fast for him to handle.
As a study of a political moment, Milk  is memorable. As a story of Milk's personal life, however, it leaves something to be desired. James Franco is sharp as the boyfriend who ditches him, but from the moment Diego Luna shows up in the underwritten role of Milk's flakiest lover, you feel that the film is leaving out as much as it shows. But that's a forgivable flaw in the rare liberal message-movie manifesto that lingers in the mind as well as the heart. A–

 One of the first scenes in “Milk” is of a pick-up in a New York subway station. It’s 1970, and an insurance executive in a suit and tie catches sight of a beautiful, scruffy younger man — the phrase “angel-headed hipster” comes to mind — and banters with him on the stairs. The mood of the moment, which ends up with the two men eating birthday cake in bed, is casual and sexy, and its flirtatious playfulness is somewhat disarming, given our expectation of a serious and important movie grounded in historical events. “Milk,” directed by Gus Van Sant from a script by Dustin Lance Black, is certainly such a film, but it manages to evade many of the traps and compromises of the period biopic with a grace and tenacity worthy of its title character.  That would be Harvey Milk (played by Sean Penn), a neighborhood activist elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 and murdered, along with the city’s mayor, George Moscone (Victor Garber), by a former supervisor named Dan White (Josh Brolin) the next year. Notwithstanding the modesty of his office and the tragic foreshortening of his tenure, Milk, among the first openly gay elected officials in the country, had a profound impact on national politics, and his rich afterlife in American culture has affirmed his status as pioneer and martyr. His brief career has inspired an opera by Stewart Wallace, an excellent documentary film (“The Times of Harvey Milk,” by Rob Epstein, from 1984) and now “Milk,” which is the best live-action mainstream American movie that I have  seen this year.  This is not faint praise, by the way, even though 2008 has been a middling year for Hollywood. “Milk” is accessible and instructive, an astute chronicle of big-city politics and the portrait of a warrior whose passion was equaled by his generosity and good humor. Mr. Penn, an actor of unmatched emotional intensity and physical discipline, outdoes himself here, playing a character different from any he has portrayed before.  This is less a matter of sexuality — there is no longer much novelty in a straight actor’s “playing gay” — than of temperament. Unlike, say, Jimmy Markum, Mr. Penn’s brooding ex-convict in Clint Eastwood’s “Mystic River,” Harvey Milk is an extrovert and an ironist, a man whose expansive, sometimes sloppy self-presentation camouflages an incisive mind and a ferociously stubborn will. All of this Mr. Penn captures effortlessly through voice and gesture, but what is most arresting is the sense he conveys of Milk’s fundamental kindness, a personal virtue that also functions as a political principle.  Which is not to say that “Milk” is an easy, sunny, feel-good movie, or that its hero is a shiny liberal saint. There is righteous anger in this movie, and also an arresting, moody lyricism. Mr. Van Sant has frequently practiced a kind of detached romanticism, letting his stories unfold matter-of-factly while infusing them with touches of melancholy beauty. (He is helped here by Danny Elfman’s elegant score and by the expressive cinematography of Harris Savides, whose touch when it comes to framing and focus could more aptly be called a caress.)  In the years since the earnest and commercial “Finding Forrester” (2000), Mr. Van Sant has devoted himself to smaller-scale projects, some of them (like the Palme d’Or-winning provocation “Elephant”) employing nonprofessional actors, and none of them much concerned with soliciting the approval of the mass audience. “Gerry,” “Elephant,” “Last Days” and “Paranoid Park” are linked by a spirit of formal exploration — elements of Mr. Van Sant’s experimental style include long tracking shots; oblique, fractured narratives; and a way of composing scenes that emphasizes visual and aural texture over conventional dramatic exposition — and also by a preoccupation with death.  Like “Elephant” (suggested by the Columbine High shootings) and “Last Days” (by the suicide of Kurt Cobain), “Milk” is the chronicle of a death foretold. Before that subway station encounter, we have already seen real-life news video of the aftermath of Milk’s assassination, as well as grainy photographs of gay men being rounded up by the police. These images don’t spoil the intimacy between Harvey the buttoned-up businessman and Scott Smith (James Franco), the hippie who becomes his live-in lover and first campaign manager. Rather, the constant risk of harassment, humiliation and violence is the defining context of that intimacy.  And his refusal to accept this as a fact of life, his insistence on being who he is without secrecy or shame, is what turns Milk from a bohemian camera store owner (after his flight from New York and the insurance business) into a political leader.  “My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.” That was an opening line that the real Milk often used in his speeches to break the tension with straight audiences, but the film shows him deploying it with mostly gay crowds as well, with a slightly different inflection. He wants to recruit them into the politics of democracy, to persuade them that the stigma and discrimination they are used to enduring quietly and even guiltily can be addressed by voting, by demonstrating, by claiming the share of power that is every citizen’s birthright and responsibility.  The strength of Mr. Black’s script is that it grasps both the radicalism of Milk’s political ambition and the pragmatism of his methods. “Milk” understands that modern politics thrive at the messy, sometimes glorious intersection of grubby interests and noble ideals. Shortly after moving with Scott from New York to the Castro section of San Francisco, Milk begins organizing the gay residents of that neighborhood, seeking out allies among businessmen, labor unions and other groups.  The city’s gay elite, discomfited by his confrontational tactics, keeps Milk at a distance, leaving him to build a movement from the ground up with the help of a young rabble-rouser and ex-hustler named Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch).  For more than  two  lively, eventful hours, “Milk” conforms to many of the conventions of biographical filmmaking, if not always to the precise details of the hero’s biography. Milk’s inexhaustible political commitment takes its toll on his relationships, first with Scott and then with Jack Lira, an impulsive, unstable young man played by Diego Luna with an operatic verve that stops just short of camp.  Meanwhile, local San Francisco issues are overshadowed by a statewide anti-gay-rights referendum and the national crusade, led by the orange-juice spokesmodel Anita Bryant, to repeal municipal antidiscrimination laws. The culture war is unfolding, and Milk is in the middle of it. (And so, 30 years later, in the wake of Proposition 8, is “Milk.”)  “Milk” is a fascinating, multi-layered history lesson. In its scale and visual variety it feels almost like a calmed-down Oliver Stone movie, stripped of hyperbole and Oedipal melodrama. But it is also a film that like Mr. Van Sant’s other recent work — and also, curiously, like David Fincher’s “Zodiac,” another San Francisco-based tale of the 1970s — respects the limits of psychological and sociological explanation.  Dan White, Milk’s erstwhile colleague and eventual assassin, haunts the edges of the movie, representing both the banality and the enigma of evil. Mr. Brolin makes him seem at once pitiable and scary without making him look like a monster or a clown. Motives for White’s crime are suggested in the film, but too neat an accounting of them would distort the awful truth of the story and undermine the power of the movie.  That power lies in its uncanny balancing of nuance and scale, its ability to be about nearly everything — love, death, politics, sex, modernity — without losing sight of the intimate particulars of its story. Harvey Milk was an intriguing, inspiring figure. “Milk” is a marvel.    “Milk” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity, brief violence and a few discreet sex scenes.

After five years spent working on the more experimental fringe, Gus Van Sant fluently returns to the relative mainstream with �Milk,� an adroitly and tenderly observed account of the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man voted into significant U.S. public office. Smartly handled study of the San Francisco politician�s powerful effect on individuals and society accurately catches a moment in American political life three decades ago, but is most notable for the surprising and entirely winning performance by Sean Penn in the leading role. Almost the definition of a specialized audience film, this Focus release looks to perform strongly in urban and university-adjacent areas but will have trouble crossing over to a public not into gay, political and social-vanguard issues. Commentators will not fail to note certain parallels with the current political season, encapsulated by its hero�s parting line, �You gotta give �em hope.�
Van Sant has always gravitated toward transgressive outcast characters, and none of them traveled so far from the margins into the status quo, or had such convulsive impact, as the real-life Harvey Milk, a New Yorker who, at 40, moved to San Francisco and broke down a significant sociopolitical barrier before being assassinated by a disturbed fellow politician. The normalizing demands of the biopic genre necessarily squeeze the director into a more recognizable format than he has employed since at least �Finding Forrester� eight years ago, and it�s possible that the most ardent fans of his variously beautiful and aggravating subsequent works -- �Gerry,� �Elephant,� �Last Days� and �Paranoid Park� -- will find this one too conventional.
But while �Milk� is unquestionably marked by many mandatory scenes -- the electioneering, outrage at conservative opposition, tension between domestic and public life, insider politicking, public demonstrations, et al. -- the quality of the writing, acting and directing generally invests them with the feel of real life and credible personal interchange, rather than of scripted stops along the way from aspiration to triumph to tragedy. And on a project whose greatest danger lay in its potential to come across as agenda-driven agitprop, the filmmakers have crucially infused the story with qualities in very short supply today -- gentleness and a humane embrace of all its characters, even of the entirely vilifiable gunman, Dan White.
Enormously researched script by Dustin Lance Black (�Big Love,� the indie feature �Pedro�) begins in November 1978, with Milk presciently tape-recording some personal reflections, driven by the awareness that he could easily become the victim of a political assassination, which he in fact was later that month. �Almost everything I did was with an eye on the gay movement,� he admits, and so it is when, in jumping back to 1972, Harvey moves with b.f. Scott Smith (a frizzy-haired, sweet-smiling James Franco) from Gotham to Baghdad by the Bay, determined to do something meaningful with his hitherto uneventful life. The opening stretch fleetly documents the role Harvey and a small group of gay buds, who hung out at Harvey�s Castro Camera shop, played in transforming the Castro district from an unremarkable working-class neighborhood into the gay Mecca it shortly became.
The banter flies easily among these bright young men, who form the nucleus of Harvey�s activist political organization when he runs for office and loses three times, twice for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and once for California State Assembly. Warm but boldly assertive at all times, Harvey builds a strong support system in the Castro, becomes allied with new S.F. Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) and, against the backdrop of propagandist singer Anita Bryant�s campaigns to repeal gay rights in Florida and elsewhere, takes advantage of new city redistricting to finally win a seat on the Board of Supervisors in 1977.
At this point and beyond, especially during the fight against the attempt by California State Senator John Briggs (Denis O�Hare) to ban gays from teaching in public schools, the film does become overweighted by real and re-created TV reports and docu-like material (actual homemovies and vintage reportage are fluidly mixed with newly shot footage throughout) and rooted in specific issues at the expense of the personal.
In fact, the pic�s least satisfactory interludes are devoted to Harvey�s last important lover, Jack Lira (Diego Luna), a footloose young Mexican who never comfortably coexists with the long-established inner circle. One can surmise there was a strong sexual bond that kept them together, but as Jack increasingly complains about his partner�s busy schedule, he quickly becomes an annoying character, the only person who creates a drag on Harvey�s energy and focus. More insight into this needy, immature fellow would have helped.
By contrast, another street kid picked up by Harvey, the amusingly brash Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), proves a constantly vibrant presence as he evolves into a crucial ally and movement leader. The lone woman of consequence, �tough dyke� Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill), comes aboard to run the successful fourth campaign, while resistance to Harvey�s upfront style is unexpectedly provided by the Advocate publisher David Goodstein (Zvi Howard Rosenman).
But the most surprising, and suggestively inflected, exchanges occur between Harvey and his eventual killer. The city supervisor from a traditional working class district, clean-cut jock Dan White (Josh Brolin) seems distinctly uncomfortable around Harvey; his knee-jerk impulse is to coldly rebuff him, and he believes his Catholicism, and the disposition of his constituents, requires him to counteract Harvey�s gay agenda.
But he is at other times remarkably solicitous, inviting only Harvey, among all the other supervisors, to his son�s christening, and indulging in political horsetrading with his erstwhile opponent (�I think he may be one of us,� Harvey winks to one of his cronies). The pic reveals Harvey�s own unwittingly fateful betrayals of Dan.
But arguably the film�s best scene is between Harvey and Dan in an otherwise empty foyer; an inarticulate plea for understanding in the form of a drunken rant by Dan, the exchange oozes a complicit vibe between the two men, all but confirming Harvey�s earlier suspicions. Brolin�s work is superlatively expressive of the inchoate impulses roiling inside his sorry character.
But good as most of the cast is, the show belongs squarely to Penn. Made to more closely resemble Milk via an elongated nose, which also makes his face look narrower, the actor socks over his characterization of a man he�s made to seem, above all, a really sweet guy, but who crucially possessed the fearlessness and toughness to be a highly successful political motivator, agitator and, ultimately, figurehead of a movement. Penn�s Harvey is a man with a ready laugh, alive to the moment, open to life regardless of neuroses and past tragedies, and acutely aware of one�s limited time on Earth. The explosive anger and fury often summoned by Penn in his work is nowhere to be seen, replaced by a geniality that is as welcome as it is unexpected.
Penn is also an ideal conduit for a characteristic shrewdly underlined in Black�s writing, that being Harvey�s talent for gently but firmly nudging people out of routine or complacent attitudes. Harvey knows how to tweak others with lightly provocative or stimulating comments that break the ice, and Penn lays on just the right amount of casual innuendo to make this crucial personality trait convincing.
Re-dressed to assume its more humdrum look of 30-plus years ago, the Castro represents itself with absolute authenticity; even Castro Camera has been re-created in the precise storefront location it occupied at the time. If anything, Van Sant and his team, including cinematographer Harris Savides, who so strikingly helped David Fincher evoke the same city and general era in �Zodiac,� have downplayed ostentatious period manifestations in costuming, production design and music in a bid to make a naturalistic film with a lived-in look.

Gus Van Sant  has never been a risk-averse filmmaker, but he directs his Harvey Milk  biopic so carefully, there might be a Ming vase balanced on his head. Van Sant's steps are deliberate, his posture is straight, his attitude is responsible, and his eyes are fixed firmly on the prize. No less cautious, Sean Penn  drops his habitual banty roosterism to play Milk (1930–1978), the martyred gay activist and San Francisco supervisor, with the concentration of an actor entrusted to portray the future subject of a U.S. postage stamp.
Opening 30 years and a day after Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone  were gunned down in City Hall by another supervisor, ex-cop Dan White , Van Sant's film is narrated by Milk from beyond the grave—less an exercise in fatalism than a way of giving collective history an engagingly Noo Yawk accent. The film is skillfully edited, using archival footage when necessary, and, working from a detailed script by documentarian Dustin Lance Black , Van Sant streamlines Milk's life, simplifying his trajectory from closeted Wall Street  zero to out-front Castro Street hero. On the eve of his 40th birthday, Milk picks up cute hippie Scott Smith  (James Franco ) leaving the subway and, after a romantic evening in tight close-up, effectively joins the counterculture, growing his hair and eloping with Smith to San Francisco. There, they open the Castro Camera Shop. When some cheerful canoodling prompts a local Chamber of Commerce type to blackball the enterprise, an activist is born: "We'll form our own business association!"
This ringing declaration serves to announce San Francisco's new gay district as an autonomous region, with the Castro Camera Shop as its epicenter. It also allows the filmmakers to portray the burgeoning Castro as a function of Milk's own political development. (The collective nature of this enterprise is built into the movie itself, which not only depicts, but, in some cases, casts Milk's associates.) Milk organizes against police harassment and, allied with progressive elements in the teamsters' union, helps ban right-wing elixir Coors from the Castro's bars. After San Francisco's most powerful gay figure advises Harvey to simmer down, the irrepressible entrepreneur appoints himself Mayor of Castro Street, hopping an actual soapbox: "My fellow degenerates." Losing a run for San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, Milk cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and loses again, promptly launching an equally quixotic primary challenge against local state assemblyman and future mayor Art Agnos (Jeff Koons , no less).
Scarcely less indefatigable, Penn is present in nearly every scene. His marked resemblance to Milk—hawkish profile, mask-of-comedy smile—is matched by an understanding of his gregarious character's political gifts. The Mayor of Castro Street was a son of the Borscht Belt—a wise guy, a tummler , part self-deprecating nerd, part infectious showoff. (Like Harvey, Penn has no difficulty milking it.) More hearty frontier settlement than drag- and disco-fueled den of depravity, the Castro blossoms in the warmth of Milk's sunny personality. A thousand flowers bloom: Abandoned by the long-suffering Smith, Milk gets a new campaign manager, self-described "tough dyke" Anne Kronenberg  (pert Alison Pill ); a new lover, Jack Lira  (adorable Diego Luna ); and, finally, a seat on the Board of Supervisors.
Happy, flirtatious, paternal, Milk was able to play politics both inside City Hall and out in the streets. San Francisco is the city Republicans love to hate and Milk  turns grandly world-historical once the campaign launched by homophobic Christian crusader and Moral Majority avatar Anita Bryant  arrives in the form of Proposition 6, an initiative to purge gay teachers (and their supporters) from public schools. The new supervisor finds himself on the front line of the Culture Wars, face-to-face with evil twin Dan White (Josh Brolin , who, better directed here than in W. , has the distinction of playing the year's two pre-eminent real-life villains).
Beleaguered personification of "family values," White is the film's most complex character, after Milk. That their death-match embodies a civil war in the American psyche is implicit in the script's suggestion that White's rage—as well as his fascination with Harvey—is fueled by repressed homosexuality. As Milk grows in stature, assembling a statewide coalition against Prop. 6, enlisting former governor Ronald Reagan  and President Jimmy Carter , White goes increasingly nuts—as does Jack and, indeed, San Francisco. White's lethal freak-out came 10 days after the S.F.-based People's Temple imploded in Guyana .
The quintessential 21st-century Gus Van Sant movie has been a boldly experimental death-trip. Elephant  and Paranoid Park  both fractured chronology, Gerry  and Last Days  distended duration, but all revolved around young protagonists whose mortality was never less than self-evident. Milk , too, has a doomed protagonist, but what's experimental here is Van Sant's faith in the old-fashioned vérités: Content trumps form as communal solidarity redeems individual sacrifice.
Rob Epstein  and Richard Schmiechen 's groundbreaking 1984 documentary, The Times of Harvey Milk , spent a third of its length on White's murder trial, including powerful footage of the flaming riots that greeted White's conviction on a lesser charge of manslaughter. Van Sant prefers to show a community together. He doesn't avert his gaze from Milk's death, but he wraps it in a comforter of last-day reconciliations, romantic flashbacks, and ethereal patriotic music.
