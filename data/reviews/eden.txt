It's tempting to say that the most Irish thing about Eden  is the gnarly  and rather musical  thickness of the brogues. (Get ready to listen  hard.) Yet what's just as Irish about it is its sweetly saddened ''wholesome'' vision of love and lust pushing their ways toward separate shores. After 10 years of marriage, Billy (Aidan Kelly) and Breda (Eileen Walsh) dump themselves into bed each night like twin sacks of potatoes. Their fire has gone out, yet they still care for each other, and it's with a peculiar mournful Gaelic whimsy that they accept their predicament. At the pub, Billy downs ale and flirts with the neighborhood hottie, whose button nose, shag cut, and hoop earrings are an erotic image that haunts his daydreams. Breda, meanwhile, is making a purple dress for the couple's 10th anniversary, a Saturday-night event that both are treating as their final chance at love. Eden  lacks the technique to give its stifled domestic-erotic feelings their full power. Yet Kelly and Walsh, who has a shy sensuality that pokes out of her toothy homely beauty, are emotionally eloquent. B–

 The kitchen-sink drama has fallen out of favor lately, elbowed aside by flashier fare. One welcome corrective to this trend is “Eden,” a picture so modest and minor-key that the emotional bruise it leaves may take days to develop.  Set in an anonymous Irish town where bars and busybodies are the primary sources of information, “Eden” circles the rocky marriage of Billy (Aidan Kelly, heartbreaking) and Breda (Eileen Walsh), a 10-year union that has produced two children and a number of dissatisfactions. As their anniversary celebration looms, Billy — a balding, bored phone company worker — grasps at youth in the form of the fiery Imelda (Sarah Greene), while Breda would just really like to have sex again, preferably some time this century.  Exquisitely tuned to the terrors of approaching middle age, “Eden” takes as its subject the common wounds of the neglected marriage and their all-too-familiar field dressings: the diet and haircut for her, the itchy feet and alcoholic stupor for him. Less gritty than Ken Loach and less quirky than Mike Leigh, the director, Declan  Recks (working from a script by Eugene O’Brien, adapting his stage play), sacrifices novelty for emotional honesty, and his actors respond.  “What if that’s all there is?” asks Breda of a friend after recounting an erotic dream. Neither woman has an answer.

"Eden," Irish helmer Declan Recks' depiction of a marriage sliding toward dissolution, burrows into the everyday details, mapping the surface tension that keeps a stagnant relationship afloat. But pic loses its delicate edge when it builds to a prescribed dramatic flashpoint within an overly compressed timeframe -- a structural holdover from the pic's stage play roots that ultimately tips it into meller territory. Excellent cast notwithstanding, the domestic drama seems unlikely to stray far from home.
Pic fixates on a couple, Billy (Aiden Kelly) and Breda Farrell (Eileen Walsh), the week before their 10th wedding anniversary. Billy, an amiable telephone line repairman, listens in on any family's conversations but his own, and takes every opportunity to go out drinking, hang with his pals and relive his one moment of glory, when he saved a kid from drowning. He becomes obsessed with a much younger woman (Sarah Greene), reading all manner of sexual promise into the simple friendliness she displays toward her dad's contemporary.
Meanwhile, wife Breda stays home with the two kids, pretending to sleep when hubby comes late to bed, devastated by his lack of desire for her. She pins all her hopes on the special dress she is sewing for the anniversary night she prays will rejuvenate her moribund marriage.
Helmer Recks and scripter Eugene O'Brien, who adapted his award-winning play to the screen, have ably translated the piece's extended his-and-her monologues into long silences, oblique glances and occasional gut-spillings to confidants. But the pic's real find has got be the family's surreally synthetic and symmetrical home; the slightly elevated angle from which it is shot adds to the sense of a dead space devoid of spontaneity.
Recks and O'Brien fare worse, though, in dramatizing the fateful anniversary-night finale. The sureness of touch Recks deployed in earlier scenes deserts him entirely as the escalating hysteria of intercut action leads to a forced, falsely theatrical climax.
Thesping, however, never falters. Kelly proves adept at balancing Billy's boyish charm with his immature denial, while Walsh's luminous Breda is a marvel of conscious vulnerability. Supporting cast is equally fine.
Widescreen lensing by Owen McPolin captures the isolation and containment of a small town set against the wild sweep of the landscape, while John Hand's production design brings that constraint back home.

This portrait of an imploding marriage is remarkable for every reason that counts in a good film: Its emotions are passionate and immediate, yet from frame one we are trusted to understand, free of manipulation, exactly what this husband and wife of 10 years are suffering and thinking. The suspense grows out of their blindness to each other. Billy (Aidan Kelly ) is a telephone lineman in the Irish countryside who, rather than face his wife, prefers to vanish into a pub after work and dote on fond memories of a heroic deed from his youth. Breda  (The Magdalene Sisters ' Eileen Walsh ) suffers his absences painfully, along with their two kids, and retreats into indolent melancholy, illuminated by a most intense and elaborate sexual fantasy. Written by Eugene O'Brien  and directed by Declan Recks, Eden  constitutes cinema of a very high order: The use of music is discreet and generally "sourced" by the settings, while the cinematography (by Owen McPolin ) is designed to suggest what Billy and Breda emphasize to themselves when they look at the world and each other. Kelly may have the thankless role of an ungrateful husband, especially in relation to the heart-piercing Walsh, but he puts us in constant contact with the suffering being behind his eyes. As Breda gives herself a radiant makeover and Billy fights his compulsive lust for a beautiful teenager, we nonetheless feel these two dreamers' hopes for each other, even as he risks disgracing himself and she risks detonating their bond altogether.
