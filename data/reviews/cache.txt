         Michael Haneke's "Caché" (Hidden) is a psychological suspense drama of the utmost rigor and originality that raises universal issues of individual responsibility of the citizens of world powers for evils past and present wreaked upon Third World countries, and in particular France's debt to Algeria. Lest this sound too heavy-going, it should quickly be made clear that "Caché" is taut, terse, brisk and immediately engaging, even though it is demanding and wholly implicit in its largest meanings. This is provocative filmmaking at its finest, boasting portrayals that are impeccable because they are so completely natural, led by Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche as a successful Parisian couple and Lester Makedonsky as their 12-year-old son.
 
  "Caché" opens with a long-held shot of a charming Paris town house on a posh, quiet street. It is the comfortable, contemporary-style home of Georges Laurent (Auteuil), well-known host of a TV book program featuring discussions with authors and commentators. Binoche's Anne is his lovely, capable wife, balancing a career at a publishing house with her private life as a loyal spouse, loving mother and gracious and frequent hostess; she is the kind of conscientious, self-possessed yet unassuming woman who makes everything look effortless. While it's true that their son, Pierrot, is facing the onslaught of puberty, the Laurents' family life proceeds in an enviably normal, seemingly secure and prosperous groove.
 


         






    This changes swiftly — the opening sequence is actually part of a mysterious video shot by a hidden camera recording the family's comings and goings. Further, increasingly invasive and tantalizing videos arrive, wrapped in childish black-white crayon drawings resembling the classic "Happy Face" but with blood dripping from its mouth. There are a number of especially jittery moments when it is not immediately certain whether we're viewing the Laurents through Haneke's eyes or that of the hidden video camera.
 
  Georges Laurent suspects more about the situation than he wants to reveal to Anne, understandably exasperated that he doesn't level with her more completely. The video invasion turns on an incident that occurred when he was a 6-year-old living with his parents on their country estate, still the home of Laurent's mother (a memorable Annie Girardot). Laurent's nightmares emerge as fragmented flashbacks scattered throughout the film as it grows more suspenseful, and it's no wonder a child would try to suppress so painful a memory that has now come to haunt and seemingly endanger Laurent as a 50-year-old TV celebrity with a cherished family. As he revealed in "The Piano Teacher," Haneke is a master at delineating obsessive behavior, as represented by the videographer, and its consequences.
 
  Even as the past surfaces it does not readily clear up precisely who is tormenting Laurent. When the videos eventually lead Laurent back to that childhood incident, it does not disclose with any certainty who the surveillance videographer really is, even though complicity on the part of one or another individual of Algerian descent — or both — seems beyond doubt. The point of the videos and the drawings is to inflict Laurent with a guilty conscience, and the key to this extraordinary film's strength is that, since Laurent was after all only 6 when it happened, he has no trouble letting himself off the hook, and the harassment to which he and his family have been subjected generates plenty of understandable self-righteous anger on his part. Yet it blinds him to the larger question of collective guilt and responsibility on the part of the French to their former colony Algeria and its struggle for independence; it's akin to an American of Northern ancestry shirking responsibility for the institution of slavery in the South, even citing family members who not only served in the Union Army but also lost their lives.
 
  "Caché" is tough-minded in the extreme. In its understated, spare and economically cinematic manner it confronts viewers head-on with those issues that are so profoundly uncomfortable and, for most people, so easy and tempting to evade, and the film accomplishes this with an ambiguity that continues to reverberate past the film's deceptively benign final image.

Right from the start of Michael Haneke's fabulously unsettling, doesn't-leave-your-head thriller Caché (Hidden) , a sense of unidentifiable threat disturbs the Parisian bourgeois comfort of Georges (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Juliette Binoche). He's the host of a popular TV book-chat show (maybe he's the French Charlie Rose?), she works for a book publisher, they're the parents of a pleasant 12-year-old son, and they live in the kind of tasteful, book-lined apartment that Woody Allen favors to signify culture, civilization, and stable modern marriage at its most privileged. But someone is watching the family's every move: Anonymously dispatched surveillance videotapes begin arriving at their doorstep, followed by unsigned, chilling, rudimentary drawings of blood spilling from a child's mouth.
Who's peeping? Why? And what does the peeper want? The Austrian filmmaker specializes in making ice-cold, sometimes gratuitously sadistic dramas (The Piano Teacher , Time of the Wolf , Code Unknown ) in which complacent middle-class types are spooked out of their smugness by random acts of jolting violence and dislocation. But this time, Haneke controls the spreading psychological terror with a firm hand and a timely subtext that is, in its way, a small-picture mirror of the political despair in Munich: As the dispatches become more personal, Georges pursues the mystery of his tormentor (who seems to know the tormented) with a mounting agitation previously hidden under his facade of bookish refinement. And aspects of his childhood past come to matter all over again.
It's ironic: In applying his exquisite shock techniques (be prepared to gasp) to a story framed by global politics (the conflict here is of a French-Algerian kind), Haneke may have finally found a psychic unease big enough to deserve the nasty firepower of his technical filmmaking skills. The picture moves with stealth, enjoying its own thriller-ness as hints are laid and mislaid. There's a sense that Hitchcock is hovering in the background and cheering for Auteuil, who musters all his French superstardom to play a man having his mask of blandness torn off.

 Michael Haneke's "Caché (Hidden)" begins, as many films do, with an exterior establishing shot. We are looking down a narrow Paris street at a nondescript house, fairly certain that cinematic convention will soon invite us inside. But there is something odd about this ordinary, even banal, image. The camera, perfectly still, lingers for an unusually long time, and we begin to suspect we may not be alone. Someone is watching with us, and perhaps even watching us as we watch. It turns out that this is not only the opening shot in a movie, but also part of a surveillance video.  Thus, before we even know what is happening, Mr. Haneke, one of the most exquisitely sadistic European filmmakers working today, has deposited his audience at the Hitchcockian junction where voyeurism intersects with paranoia. We are at once innocent and complicit, as if the idle curiosity that brings us into the theater authorized a malignant form of spying. The residents of the house, Georges and Anne Laurent, who have received the video in a bag left on their doorstep, certainly feel violated and intruded upon. Why would anyone do such a thing? What have they - Georges and Anne, a perfectly respectable upper-middle-class professional couple - done to deserve this?  The question turns out not to be rhetorical. The tape is followed by others, and by violent drawings made all the more disconcerting by their childishness. Variations on that enigmatic, implacable opening shot pop up again and again, intensifying the ambience of suspicion and multiplying the film's ironies and implications. Georges (Daniel Auteuil) is the host of a highly rated literary talk show on public television (this is France, remember), and is therefore used to the camera's scrutiny. Anne (Juliette Binoche), who works in publishing, finds her husband's response to their invisible stalker annoyingly secretive and mistrustful. Their relationship starts to crack and buckle, even as they try to maintain an illusion of blithe bourgeois normalcy for their friends and their 12-year-old son, Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky).  As it happens, their domestic drama has large implications. The film's title gestures at realities that are pushed out of sight so that normal life can take its uneventful course. Normal life, that is, as it is lived by affluent, bien-pensant Western folk like the Laurents. Mr. Haneke, an Austrian who works mainly in France (and who makes excellent use of that country's rich deposit of acting talent), has established his reputation by shaming - and shocking - the consciences of sophisticated continental audiences. A mainstay of the Cannes Film Festival, where "Caché" made its debut last spring, he has acquired considerable cultural prestige as a result of rubbing the smug faces of his characters (and, implicitly, his public) in the depravity, violence and sheer moral ugliness that lurks beneath their comfort and complacency.  There is something schematic about his moralizing, but also something undeniably arresting. Tempting as it is to dismiss "Caché" as a liberal guilt trip in the guise of a thriller, it is at the same time hard to deny its creepy, insinuating power. Nor is it possible to tune out its accusatory message. Civilization and barbarism are not antithetical, Mr. Haneke insists, but adjacent, perhaps even identical. He has said as much before - in "Funny Games,"  "Code Inconnu,"  "The Piano Teacher" and "The Time of the Wolf" - but never with such visual polish or rhetorical refinement. There is one shockingly violent scene in "Caché," and another of wrenching emotional brutality, but for the most part the movie works by restraint and indirection rather than by assaultive confrontation.  "Caché" can be interpreted both as a response to the Sept. 11 attacks and, in retrospect, as a prophecy of the riots that convulsed France's impoverished suburbs this fall. What is hidden, above all, from the Laurents and their ilk are the social grievances directed against them. The drawings and videotapes are a form of psychological terrorism, the roots of which lie in Georges's provincial childhood and in the events of Oct. 17, 1961, when as many as 200 Algerian protesters died at the hands of the Paris police, then commanded by the former Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon.  Is Georges and Anne's tormentor seeking revenge or recognition? The drawings trigger dreams and half-suppressed memories, and the videotapes lead Georges to the bedside of his mother (Annie Girardot) and to a shabby apartment inhabited by a man named Majid (Maurice Bénichou), the son of Algerians who worked on Georges's parents' farm. Confronted by this soft-spoken living ghost of his childhood - who denies any knowledge of the videos or the drawings - Georges insists that his conscience is clear, even as his defensive, threatening tone contradicts him.  At times "Caché" resonates, none too subtly, with the oft-repeated post-9/11 question: Why do they hate us? Because we don't hate ourselves sufficiently, Mr. Haneke responds, doing his bit to make up the shortfall. But while this film can seem politically simplistic, it is nonetheless psychologically astute, and more complicated than it at first appears. Mr. Auteuil and Ms. Binoche are too sensitive and agile to be ideological marionettes, and in spite of his finger-pointing it is not really Mr. Haneke's intention to reduce Anne and Georges to stereotypes. While the obvious movement of the film is centrifugal, drawing back from the cocoon of the Laurent household into a world of political violence and social misery, it also pulls in the opposite direction, propelled inward by the mysterious gravity of individual motives and feelings. The initial shot of the movie is answered by the last, which demands close attention and contains the intriguing suggestion that the real story has been hidden all along - that it has been driven not by the noisy public conflict between Arabs and Frenchmen, but rather by the quiet, perpetual war between fathers and sons.  "Caché (Hidden)" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Its single short scene of violence is among the most upsetting in a movie this year.
Cool and simple but resonating invisibly out into our lives like an X-ray, Michael Haneke 's Caché (Hidden) is a mystery wrapped in a tangle of sightlinesyou are rarely confident about what you're watching, and never sure that watching will be enough. Movies may be the act of seeing, but Haneke knows that doesn't necessarily entail perception, or understanding. In fact, Caché  is a leveling necropsy on the limits of witness, and the fallout is terrifyingnot because of what the film shows you but due to the poisoning unease of our own inadequacies. This unique crucible begins in the very first shot: a nondescript view from a side street of a gated townhouse entrance, thick with parked cars and passersby. Haneke holds it for minutes, and eventually we hear a couple talking elliptically to each other, but we do not see them. Then the image begins to rewind: We've been watching a video with the couple (Daniel Auteuil  and Juliette Binoche ), who are as lost as we are. On the tape, Auteuil's Georges walks from his front door and virtually strides by the "camera"; in "real life," Georges steps outside to the street, trying to suss out how he could've not seen the footage being shot.
The premise is easily recognizable as the initial MacGuffin in David Lynch 's Lost Highway : a marriage being "invaded" by videotapes whose origins are certainly violative and potentially metaphysical. But Lynch never implicated the viewer; Haneke kicks off his dissertation by usurping our presumption of omnipotence. Immediately, every minute of Caché  is untrustworthy, and we never know, literally, if any given shot is "live" or if it's Memorex . Of course, the difference grows moot as Caché  progresses; Haneke returns to that street shot, daring us to define the image two ways at once. New milieus are similarly introduced with still, stagnant establishing shots that create a ferociously new tone of guilt-menace. Suddenly, we're Rear Window 's L.B. Jefferies, and Haneke's characters are the hapless Lars Thorwalds .
That switchback is apt; the process of paranoia begins to unravel Anne and Georges's family (their 12-year-old son Pierrot, played by Lester Makedonsky , instills his own kind of upset into the mix) and to reveal sins of the past. The meta-stalking also involves savage kindergarten drawings of a bloodied child, arriving in the mail and otherwise. A tape "delivered" during a smug dinner party leaves the side street and instead, through a rainy windshield, brings us all to the country house Georges grew up in. Flashes of the bloodied boy, of Arab descent, haunt Georges's dreams (or so he says; we see them simply as jump-cutaways). Lying to Anne, Georges follows up the clues, locating the grown Algerian and falling ever deeper into a dry well of unlocatable answers and nauseous anxieties made inexplicably flesh.
Haneke is not our only hardcore existentialist, but he might be the most pure-minded. Caché  ("hidden," Georges says, about everything) has a Mandelbrot set's molecular uniformity: The gout of details reflects the film's larger shape, down to an elaborate mealtime joke, the unhelpful conversation Georges has with his invalid mother (Annie Girardot ), and Pierrot's offscreen transformation into a secretive, uncommunicative punkor was he always that way? (Anne and Georges, or Euro-variations on them, are the names of the hetero pairs in four other Haneke films, as if each were a prism-angle on the same transgressive-voyeurism tale.) Eventually, the movie's devilish structureevery cut is an occasion for what-is-it- now  heebie-jeebiespredicates how we react to the story, particularly once the middle-aged Algerian (Haneke vet Maurice Bénichou ) faces up to his unspeakable unknown, and we're as hyperaware as Georges that the entire scene could have been secretly taped.
The form of this unholy experience is so sublimely conceived that Haneke can rope in post-colonialist atrocity (specifically, the Paris drowning-massacre of protesting Algerians in 1961) and contemporary injustices (ever-present on Anne and Georges's plasma TV), and make it all seem of a piece with the central issues of seeing-but-not-seeing, of bobo complacence in fragile balance with Frantz Fanon 's "wretched of the earth." Binoche and Auteuil are both quietly sensational in their fracturing personae, but the film is Haneke's premier postmodern assaultless visceral, perhaps, than Code Unknown  and the criminally underappreciated Time of the Wolf , but more thoughtful and, in the end, deeper in the afterplay. Just when you think Haneke will slip away under the cloak of total obfuscation, he hits us with a long, final mega-shot, of a school releasing its students. If you watch closely, something casual but implicitly horrible happens, offering up a tantalizing hint that only opens darker, more cluttered closets.
