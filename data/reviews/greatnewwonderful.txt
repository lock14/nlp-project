The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, are never mentioned in ``The Great New Wonderful." They don't need to be. They're the eggshells on which the film's characters walk every waking moment.
This mysteriously rich, mostly wonderful comedy-drama takes place in September 2002, when the lives of its unconnected New Yorkers have returned to something that looks like normal. ``Normal" being a thin layer of tissue paper over the abyss.
The chic cake designer (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is back in her superficial rut, fretting about a rival (Edie Falco of ``The Sopranos" in a small role) and focused on the wealthy clients to whom she'll sell $1,000 confections named after Shakespearean heroines. The little old lady in Coney Island (Olympia Dukakis) goes to progressive political meetings, makes art-filled scrapbooks she puts in a drawer, and wonders why the sight of her couch-potato husband (Ed Setrakian) fills her with dread.
A pair of tense, well-intentioned yuppie parents (Judy Greer and Tom McCarthy) try to ignore the fact that their young son (Billy Donner) is a sociopathic brute. Two middle-class South Asian immigrants (Naseerudin Shah and Sharat Saxena) work a security detail for a visiting general and try to come to grips with their new country's freedoms and paradoxes.
In the film's most darkly funny tangent, a workplace grief counselor (Tony Shalhoub) conducts a series of interviews with a pleasant young man (Jim Gaffigan), probing for rage and neuroses that just aren't there. Of the many unstrung souls in ``Wonderful," Dr. Trabulous appears the most deluded, asking the perplexed Sandie if perhaps he's ever felt like giving his mother ``a good kick, or shoving her head into the ground?"
``The Great New Wonderful" -- the title comes from the name of the cake designer's company -- follows these characters around for just under 90 minutes, gleaning sharp, unexpected insights and awaiting the inevitable moments of crises. The skies are a pristine September blue. Every so often a plane lazily crosses the sky. All it takes is an elevator momentarily shuddering to a halt to get the heart screaming again.
The movie is one of those generously cast lost-souls-in-the-big-city movies along the lines of 2004's ``Heights" or 2001's ``13 Conversations About One Thing"; it's also a quieter, less melodramatic piece of work than last year's ``Crash," and arguably a better one.
The invisible 9/11 theme -- an unheard counter-melody -- gives the film weight and coherence. The jagged rift that opened that day between lives of privilege and utter chaos hasn't closed; it's just studiously ignored by people who can't understand why their nerves are shot. When the cake designer says ``After everything that's happened, I can't believe nothing has changed," we're witnessing the tip of an incalculably large iceberg.
The film's an actor's playpen. Greer has been stuck so long in goofball supporting roles that she tears into this part -- a smart, loving mother frightened of her own son -- as if it were prime rib. Gyllenhaal allows us to recoil from her character's airy selfishness while letting us understand why it might be necessary. Dukakis plays a deft game of resentment and hope, and Shah is delightful as a man so in love with America that he's blind to its snares. Stephen Colbert (of ``The Colbert Report" and White House press-banquet eviscerations) brings the expected sneaky wit to his portrayal of an elementary school principal who knows from playground terrorism.
At the center is Dr. Trabulous, who's a saint or a psycho or both. Every movie should have Shalhoub in it; the actor gets nuances of bearing and behavior others don't even consider, and the royal fun he has -- even when playing serious -- is a rare thing. It's possible his character is the film's very own Buddha. True to that notion, you won't hear it from him.
The director of ``The Great New Wonderful" is Danny Leiner, taking a big step up from teen comedies such as ``Dude, Where's My Car?" and ``Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle." He makes the transition with ease (though you could argue that ``Harold and Kumar" had a grand stoner humanism of its own), and he's lucky to be working with this cast and a fine, subtle script by actor-turned-writer Sam Catlin.
Both men understand that even pampered New Yorkers are deserving of empathy, that everything in our culture and private lives is dedicated to burying despair, and that that fear needs to be dug out and dealt with if we're ever to go forward as wiser mortals. If not, why are we even living?


 In the break room of a bland corporate office suite somewhere in Manhattan, an accountant (Jim Gaffigan) undergoes therapy with a curiously passive-aggressive psychologist (Tony Shalhoub). Elsewhere, an attractive 30-something couple (Judy Greer and Tom McCarthy) struggle to deal with their overweight, antisocial son, and an ambitious pastry chef (Maggie Gyllenhaal) prepares the pitch that, she hopes, will make her the new queen of the competitive New York cake scene.  On the other side of the East River, in Brooklyn, an older woman (Olympia Dukakis) fixes supper for her husband, and then sits at the kitchen table making collages out of old magazines as he smokes a cigarette out on the balcony. Two Indian immigrants (Naseeruddin Shah and Sharat Saxena), neighbors as well as colleagues, work security for a visiting dignitary.  These characters, who cross paths glancingly if at all (and are joined by Stephen Colbert and Edie Falco in distracting if amusing cameos as a private school headmaster and a diva of dessert), occupy the quiet, tidy vignettes that make up "The Great New Wonderful," a new film directed by Danny Leiner and written by Sam Catlin.  What links the stories is that they occur simultaneously at a moment that seems at once meaningless and portentous: September 2002, a year after the terrorist attacks. Not that Sept. 11 itself is ever mentioned in the movie — that would be too obvious, too literal, and thus contrary to the filmmakers' apparent intention to tease and mystify. Every now and then, somebody will gesture toward this great unspoken, alluding to how everything is different "since then," or noting that "we are all" subject to the same vague emotional affliction.  But otherwise we are left to wonder about causes and effects. Is Satish (Mr. Saxena), the stouter, less talkative of the two security guards, in such a bad mood because of Al Qaeda, or is he just generally a grouch? Is his partner and pal, Avi (Mr. Shah), obsessed with staring at women's backsides as a result of the attack, or does he just happen to share an interest with whoever is operating the camera? Do the tears, sex and mild violence that erupt at the movie's low-key climax represent a form of catharsis, a purging of the rage, grief and terror that have been repressed and numbed by unthinking adherence to routine?  Maybe. The moments in "The Great New Wonderful" that feel truest are the ones that reveal how habit at once stabilizes and stultifies. Doing the same thing every day is both a comfort and a trap, and the actors (Ms. Greer and Ms. Gyllenhaal especially) betray, with small gestures and tics of speech, the fatigue that comes from being stuck in the same self 24 hours a day.  Mr. Leiner, who has previously directed the coarse (and very funny) comedies "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," has a good eye for the small absurdities of ordinary life, and in particular for the unacknowledged (and unattractive) emotions that lie beneath the careful neutrality of everyday behavior. (When I say he has a good eye, I mean it metaphorically, since the look of this film is uniformly drab and unevocative.) Envy, disappointment, the fear of failure and the expectation of compromise — these, more than love or sympathy or even ambition, are the engines that drive Mr. Leiner's New Yorkers from one scene to the next.    That residents of this city — in particular white, relatively privileged Manhattanites — are capable of a certain degree of self-absorption will hardly come as news, even to those unfamiliar with New York magazine or the films of Woody Allen. The twist "The Great New Wonderful" offers is the implication that Sept. 11 made this condition more acute, and perhaps even provided justification for it. We never learn about the specific effects of the World Trade Center attacks on particular characters — whether any of them lost a friend or happened to be downtown that morning — an omission in keeping with the film's coy, abstract treatment of recent history.  It may be that in the long run, Sept. 11 drove New Yorkers deeper into themselves. But it also awakened a long-dormant sense of civic solidarity, as well as sharpening the local appetite for disputation. That none of Mr. Leiner and Mr. Catlin's carefully cultivated urban specimens expresses a political opinion — or even the slightest hint of curiosity about or engagement with the larger world — creates a ringing silence that also amounts to a glaring false note. We are invited either to identify with them or to feel superior, which is not much of a choice. It may be that our mockery is meant, by the end, to melt into sympathy, but it is hard to feel much warmth toward people whose most salient feature is their disconnection from reality.  "The Great New Wonderful" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains profanity and sexual references.
Having established his genius for stoner repartee ( Dude, Where's My Car?; Harold & Kumar ), Danny Leiner  aims for something more sophisticated with this sepia-hued mope- fest, in which a cross-section of 10 New Yorkers a few of whom briefly share an elevator in a Magnolia -style linkagesearch for Deep Meaning in their lives. It's the kind of movie where the dialogue is rife with theatricality (Edie Falco 's speech on penguins is a bigger non sequitur than anything in Dude ), and closure is confirmed when a young girl belts a feel-good karaoke tune. Worse yet, the film, set in September 2002, employs 9-11 as a thematic crutch, positing the attacks as little more than a backdrop for its characters' other, infinitely less significant woes. These include the career angst of an aspiring celebrity baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal ), the staggering self-pity of the parents of a problem child (Judy Greer  and Tom McCarthy ), the bottled resentment of an immigrant security guard (Sharat Saxena ), and the romantic regrets of an aging Brighton Beach  resident (Olympia Dukakis ). Ironically, Leiner's two monuments to pothead delirium seem vastly more coherent than this hazy attempt to mine the zeitgeist, a film every bit as pointed as its nounless title.
