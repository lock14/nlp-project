It�s summertime, 1974. While a greatest-hits collection of soul music fills the airwaves, teenagers play basketball outside a run-down rec center in the impoverished Philadelphia neighborhood of Nicetown, unaware that it�s all about to be torn down by the city � starting with their basketball rim. Which is cause for alarm: Without that rim, you see, they�ve got no basketball game; without basketball, they�ve got nothing to do; and with nothing to do, teenagers� behavior tends toward the antisocial. Based on the true story of Jim Ellis, who turned an abandoned community center in a hopeless community into a nationally respected competitive swimming program, Pride
 is a perfectly by-the-book sports film about the power of the will to overcome circumstance. There�s nothing that makes it any better or any worse than the dozens of other by-the-book sports films released over the last 20 years, not even, surprisingly, the performances of Howard as Ellis, the coach of a thousand platitudes, and Mac as Elston, his comically dyspeptic right-hand man. Together they cajole and massage and threaten their young swimmers into looking beyond the temptations of the streets and finding self-actualization in the holy sports trinity of pride, determination, and resilience and reward them with plaques and musical montages for their troubles. All that stands in their way is an indifferent city government, the siren song of street life, and the crushing weight of institutional racism (every white person in Pride
 is a seething, spitting, fire-breathing burlesque of bigotry). True, these may sound like enormous hurdles for teenagers to leap, but anyone familiar with the laws of modern Hollywood knows they�re only minor speed bumps on a one-way road to inspiration. Pride
�s story was etched in stone ages ago by mysterious movie powers beyond our understanding, and all the Staples Singers� songs in the world won�t keep it from its appointed rounds.


Listen up, black youth of America. Here comes this month's public-service melodrama made for everybody but with you specifically in mind. It's called "Pride," and, while it's neither as socially urgent as "Freedom Writers" nor as danceable and soapy as "Stomp the Yard," it's better acted and tougher to resist.
Terrence Howard stars as Jim Ellis, a former competitive swimmer who, after being turned down for a private-school teaching job, winds up stationed at the practically condemned Marcus Foster recreation center in 1974 Philadelphia.
It should be a demoralizing assignment (the place looks like a set from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ), but after he discovers an indoor pool on the premises and some aimless kids to do laps in it, things start to look up. Debunking the myth that black people don't swim, he transforms the five apathetic boys roughhousing on the rec center's basketball court, and the one innately talented girl, into championship swimmers.
Obviously, "Pride" is too clich�d to be 
based on anything but a true story, however loosely. Like other recent feel-great sports stories of at-risk kids mentored into self-belief (see "Coach Carter" or "Gridiron Gang "), "Pride" is only a little bit about sport. Adequately directed by Sunu Gonera , a South African in his debut, the movie is also about reminding certain people in the audience that, in the immortal words of Jesse Jackson , "They are. Somebody."
Of course, in other such movies (including last spring's cruelly ignored "Akeelah and the Bee" ), the kids are crippled by low self-esteem. In "Pride," cockiness is a defense mechanism against any inferiority complex, and the movie excels at dramatizing how arrogance can be just as destructive as self-doubt. The team arrives at its first meet, out in Philadelphia's upper-crusty Main Line , with a chip on its shoulder. Will they beat these white boys? Of course: They're black. Oops. The meet is a disaster.
One of the coaches (Tom Arnold ), the very one who for racist reasons refused to hire Ellis to teach, is condescending, and the white swimmers hurl insults. But the Marcus Foster kids are out of their depth in a way that has little to do with racism. They're just under-prepared. Some smartass preppie asks the black swimmers if they're the Harlem Globetrotters. Sadly, on this day they're the Washington Generals.
After the rout, the Marcus Foster kids make jokes on the bus ride home. "We just clowning," one of the kids says, opting for a tellingly loaded word choice. Coach Ellis and his assistant, the rec center's crusty janitor (Bernie Mac , wonderfully mellow), are bewildered. As Ellis, Howard uses the occasion to give a tough but tender monologue meant to shame his athletes into having some pride.
It's one of those well-delivered speeches you don't soon forget, not so much for what it says (although that's important) but for the wounded manner in which it's delivered. Ellis isn't just angry. He's hurt that his team doesn't care about self-respect. Giving that speech breaks his heart, and it breaks ours watching him do it.
Howard is usually the best thing about whatever he's in. Based on a lot of what's on his resume, that shouldn't be saying much. But bad material doesn't faze him. He's so much better than a lot of his more famous peers. He'll commit to anything. Of course
, the man who stole "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " and won an Oscar nomination for playing a rapping pimp in "Hustle & Flow" is giving the "have some self-respect" speech. Howard is the utmost professional, the picture of pride.
Here his work is cut out for him. The script is straight from the urban sports drama starter kit, which is probably being used right now to bring us the story of an all-black lacrosse team or a young black chess champ. Ellis and his charges don't just have to contend with racism. They have to survive both the local drug dealer (Gary Anthony Sturgis, playing Denzel Washington's part in "Training Day" the way Ronald Isley might) and the city's determination to close the center. On that front, the movie gives us Kimberly Elise. Not only is her character the sister of one of the swimmers, Hakim (Nate Parker ), she's also the councilwoman persuaded to help keep Marcus Foster open.
Elise and Howard have a few scenes together that emit a sexual charge, and feeling the connection I was desperate to see them in another movie, playing people carrying a different sort of weight of the world. Here they're doing a community service, often tearfully. (These two have the leakiest eyes in Hollywood. Anything could get them to well up.)
What "Pride" fails to do is establish these people, 
especially the kids, as more than emblems of uplift. The young actors playing them -- Parker, Kevin Phillips , Alphonso McAuley , Evan Ross , Brandon Fobbs , and Regine Nehy -- are charismatic. But the screenplay gives them all the same attitude about everything. When Howard presents the tight swim trunks they're supposed to compete in, everybody refuses, showing up at that first meet in street shorts and cut-offs. They share a brain.
Like many of these movies -- "Freedom Writers" and "Akeelah" are exceptions -- the social concerns in "Pride" turn the kids themselves into one-note afterthoughts. So, dramatically speaking, even when they win, they lose.


         The role of Jim Ellis, the steely-eyed swim coach who turns five scraggly teens from inner-city Philadelphia into a championship swim team, is the kind most actors would tear into like a well-cooked steak. But Terrence Howard comes at the part like he's stalking live prey. Handed a mess of rousing speeches and believe-in-yourself bromides, Howard plays to the front row instead of the cheap seats, rarely raising his voice, as if he expects his young charges to lean in and listen to every word.
 
 It's a striking performance, not least because of how at odds it is with the movie it's in. "Pride," the first feature by the Zimbabwean director Sunu Gonera, wants to be an inspirational, by-the-numbers sports story, an underdog tale of triumph over prejudice inducing cheers with each push of a Pavlovian button. Howard seems to be in an altogether different and substantially more idiosyncratic film. When the story calls for him to be Patton, he plays Kurtz.
 


         






   The real-life story of Ellis, a junior-high math teacher who has coached several swimmers from Philadelphia's struggling Nicetown neighborhood all the way to Olympic trials, has been stripped of its particulars and stuffed into a plain paper bag. Asked by the Philadelphia Inquirer how much of the movie was true, Ellis responded, "My name is."
 
 Perhaps Ellis' life is not the stuff of pulse-pounding thrillers, but it could scarcely be less interesting than the prefab plot concocted by "Pride's" four credited screenwriters. When Ellis is rejected out of hand for a coaching job at the prosperous, all-white Main Line Academy, it's a sure bet that Ellis' black swimmers will do battle with Main Line's in the final reel. The confrontation is especially foreordained because the movie's universe (or, more likely, its budget) seems to have room for only two fully staffed swim teams. By the third time Ellis faces off with Main Line's cock-of-the-walk coach (a congested Tom Arnold), you half expect one of them to quip, "You again?"
 
 Rather than kowtow to the movie's grandstanding, Howard plays against the grain, drawing on the vulnerable volatility he showed in "Hustle & Flow" and "Idlewild." His Jim Ellis is wounded and fierce, both scarred and motivated by an invented incident in which a teenage Ellis is barred from swimming at a meet in North Carolina in 1964, prompting a violent confrontation. The image of Howard's tear-streaked face pressed to the floor by a policeman's boot has a power that the movie never comes close to equaling, or earning.
 
 If the other actors don't match Howard's eccentric intensity — at one point he comes upon a room full of disused lane markers and inhales deeply, as if sucking in the last few particles of stale chlorine — they manage surprisingly well given the thin material. Among Ellis' swimmers, Evan Ross stands out as the shy, stuttering Reggie, and Bernie Mac provides comic relief as the crotchety custodian of the crumbling rec center where Ellis starts up his program. It's a shame Gonera couldn't have made better use of his obviously talented cast. At times, he doesn't even seem to know how good their performances are. Why else would he feed Howard dialogue like "I believe in them so much" when the preceding shot of him gazing proudly at his fast-improving students has already made the point?
 
 Gonera greases the wheels with a Philly soul soundtrack fitting the mid-'70s time frame and finds a passable analogue to Philadelphia's row houses in the shotgun shacks of New Orleans, where the movie was shot. But "Pride" wades into the shallows when it ought to be diving into the deep end. In waters this familiar, everyone knows how to swim.
 
 "Pride." MPAA rating: PG for thematic material, language including some racial epithets, and violence. Running time: 1 hour, 44 minute. In general release.   

The way an actor sounds is as important as how he looks, and Terrence Howard, given the force and directness of most of his characters, has a way of catching you off guard with what a delicately intense, satin-soft instrument his voice is. His gaze may be steady as a rock, but when he talks, there's a hint of a quaver  almost a shadow memory of tears. In Hustle & Flow , he gave that dime-store Memphis pimp a lazy, caressing smokehouse drawl, the kind that could nudge an invitation into a threat (or vice versa). Now, in Pride , a strategical gearshift of a movie set in Philadelphia in 1974, he takes on the role of one of those inspirational tough-love sports coaches, and Howard, once again, commands through quiet, summoning the gentle music of a man who is literally trying to find his power as he speaks. (Or maybe the fact that he's quiet is the real sign of power.) That tremulous baritone isn't weak; it's what makes Howard's strength human. He uses it to invest the film with so much casual discovery and verve that it's as if this sort of role had never been invented before.
The actor wears long sideburns, a domesticated guidance-counselor Afro, and the inevitable array of plaid jackets and slacks to play Jim Ellis, a real-life swim coach (the film is based on a true story) who, in the early '70s, founded the Philadelphia Department of Recreation swimming team. After being turned down for a job at a local white high school, Ellis wanders into the Marcus Foster Recreation Center. The place is as junky and useless as something out of Escape From South Philly   it's a playground of trashed dreams  and the kids shooting hoops on the netless outdoor court razz him like he's some uptight Negro alien. Inside, there's a swimming pool, but even that's overwhelmed by the clutter of abandonment. The degraded setting is the inner city in limbo, caught between the twilight of the civil rights era and the dawn of hip-hop, and that blasted physical space works for the movie. Pride  really is  about the audacity of hope. It's not that Ellis has to sow these kids with the values of a noble institution. He has to create the institution, building it from the ragged ground up, and that, along with Howard's reflective, almost melancholy performance, makes Pride  more organic than the usual cookie-cutter sports-montage movie.
As Ellis molds the ghetto kids into a swim team, the film isn't exactly big on showing you the nuts and bolts of how they learn the butterfly stroke. I would have liked more detail, but where the director, Sunu Gonera, is shrewd is in parsing, from every angle, the emotions of the title. When the P.D.R. crew face off against a privileged white team (their coach is played by a convincingly jerky Tom Arnold), they botch the meet by messing around, and you feel the wounded arrogance of their ill-disciplined antics. By the end, of course, they're oozing self-respect. Bernie Mac, as the rec center's janitor, earns laughs by turning gibes into folk wisdom. Pride  doesn't have much surprise, but it's a formula picture of genuine feeling, with Terrence Howard proving once again that he wouldn't know how to keep it less than real.

 "Pride," about a swim coach (Terrence Howard) leading an urban  recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, illustrates the adaptability and limitations of the sports movie.  The film is based on fact: Mr. Howard's character, Jim Ellis, coached generations of African-American teenagers in competitive swimming in Philadelphia.  The film's director, a Zimbabwean, Sunu Gonera, pours on the period details: plaid shirts, Afros and Nixon-era street slang ("Jive turkey!"); a soundtrack featuring the O'Jays, the Staple Singers, the Philadelphia All-Stars and other Philadelphia R&B legends.  Most striking is the film's depiction of a more blatant version of racism.  A prep school athletic director (Tom Arnold) flatly denies the hero a job on the basis of his race; later, when Jim takes his swimmers to the racist coach's suburban turf, white onlookers taunt them and boo their every mistake.  Otherwise, "Pride" is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. Stock elements include a saintly, tough-love coach; an outwardly cynical lieutenant (Bernie Mac) who is a closet idealist; and a naysayer (Kimberly Elise as a budget-cutting councilwoman) who is converted by the hero's sexy decency.  The team includes a reformed delinquent, a bespectacled nerd and a stuttering angel. The movie serves up the expected ratio of setbacks to triumphs and closes with video footage of the real Jim Ellis.  But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of "I'll Take You There," the heart still leaps.    "Pride" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, mild profanity and racist behavior.

The inspirational sports movie formula has gotten perhaps a little too much exercise lately, with many recent tales of underdog triumph blurring together. Still, there's always room for a good one, and despite a second half that feels more routine than its first, "Pride" is a definite crowd-pleaser. Based on a true story, this confident first feature from helmer Sunu Gonera boasts a terrific performance from Terrence Howard as the coach of an unlikely 1970s ghetto swim team, with sidekick Bernie Mac also in fine form. Pic has sleeper potential on home turf, with strong ancillary action to follow.
Prologue finds Jim Ellis (Howard) as a student competing in a 1964 North Carolina swim tournament, to catcalls from the white spectators and outright refusal from white swimmers to share the pool with him. In subsequent fracas, he takes a swing at a cop and gets arrested.
A decade later, Jim has a mathematics degree and a history of athletic excellence. But the world hasn't changed much: When he interviews for a job at upscale Philadelphia high school Main Line Academy, Coach Bink (Tom Arnold) smirkingly informs him, "I don't think a person like yourself" -- meaning an African-American -- "could communicate with our students."
Desperate for work, Ellis accepts a low-paying position cleaning up a rec center scheduled for closure in Philly's poor Nicetown district. He gets a less-than-warm welcome from custodian Elston (Mac), who remembers when the facility was a vital element in the community. Though it's far from that now, he's still furious the city is shutting it down.Confronted by Elston, neighborhood councilwoman Sue Davis (Kimberly Elise) points to the pimps and drug dealers lurking near the basketball court outside and dismisses the center as "a nesting ground for drugs, thugs and the lowest common denominator."
Given the state the rest of the building is in, it's a bit improbable that the pool would be in sterling condition, but oh well. That stroke of luck gives Jim a chance to flex his erstwhile championship mojo and attract the interest of five teens: Puddin' Head (Brandon Fobbs), Andre (Kevin Phillips), Hakim (Nate Parker), Reggie (Evan Ross) and Walt (Alphonso McAuley).
When braggart Andre challenges Jim to a race that the latter handily wins, the kids are impressed enough to ask for swimming lessons. Once they've improved, they petition Jim and the now supportive Elston to let them compete in the area's league. This development lures a sixth teen, Willie, aka Wilhelmina (Regine Nehy), who silences all "But you're a girl" wisecracks with a couple lightning laps.
Still, collective cockiness outstrips barely honed skills, and the team loses its first meet against seemingly unbeatable Main Line. Worse, their behavior is less sportsmanlike than clownish, doing nothing to counter the racist attitudes they confront.
Up to this point, "Pride" more than makes up in conviction and smarts whatever it lacks in conceptual originality. Period flavor is strong but not over-pushed, and perfs are handled with a likable restraint that avoids the usual sports-pic typing (i.e. Brainiac, Casanova, Shy Stutterer -- well, actually, Reggie is the latter).
While Mac does function as comic relief, he's in character rather than comedian form here, reining in the shtick to winning effect. And Howard, who's surely on track to major stardom, does such subtly engaging work in a stock role that when Jim's emotions do occasionally burst through, they cut to the core.
The young thesps are all excellent (if in more ripped condition than would be common in 1974). Elise, playing an obstacle turned Jim's ally/romantic interest, does OK in a more schematic role. Ditto Gary Sturgis as the local hustler who reps the bad choices these kids hopefully won't make.
After the one-hour mark, however, the script begins hitting more predictable affirmational-uplift notes, which Gonera just half-heartedly tries to freshen up. There are too many tearily triumphant moments, and the de rigeur climactic match could be more rousing. (Admittedly, competitive swimming isn't the most exciting sport in cinematic terms.) Nonetheless, pic has built up enough goodwill to keep auds stoked to the end.
Though "Pride" was shot in Louisiana, a sense of racially divided place strongly registers in a production package that's sharp down the line. Aaron Zigman's conventional orchestral score makes less of an impression than soundtrack's parade of stirring '70s soul hits.
Real-life Ellis, glimpsed during closing credits, still coaches the now nationally famed team he founded in 1971; several of his swimmers have gone on to Olympic trials.

The feature debut from South African director Sunu Gonera  is straight from the sports-film playbook, the one in which an underdog team coached by an obstinate overachiever overcomes obstacles and adversity to take home the gold. It's Hoosiers in a swimming poolwell, Glory Road , anyway, given this is about a group of black swimmers competing against all-white teams who wouldn't toss the brothers a life preserver if they were drowning in the deep end. Like most sports pics, Pride is based on a true-life tale, that of Jim Ellis  (played here by Terrence Howard ), a former college swimmer who, in the 1970s, resuscitates a Philly rec center by filling the pool with water and some neighborhood kids with hope. Destined to be drug-runners for a dangerous but ultimately dim neighborhood thug, the kids instead excel between the lane ropes. If everything about the movie is overly familiar, at least Gonera and his writers get the details right; the pool sequences capture the isolation of the competitive swimmer who crawls for miles in lonely, aching silence. Howard, playing Ellis with equal measures of desperation and determination, is terrificwhen is he not? Better still is Bernie Mac  as the rec center's janitor, who is suspicious of Ellis's motives until at last he dives in. If nothing else, Pride has the best sports-film soundtrack everPhilly funk and soul, '70s style. And hell, that'll  get ya wet.
