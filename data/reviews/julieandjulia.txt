Firstly, the introductions: Julia is Julia Child, that most beloved of chefs, who taught America to debone a duck on public television; Julie is Julie Powell, a disgruntled government worker who spent a year of her life cooking her way through Child�s Mastering the Art of French Cooking
. In 2002, Powell chronicled her experiment on a blog, which then became a bestselling memoir, which became one-half of the source material for Ephron�s adaptation (Child�s memoir, My Life in France
, supplies the other half). Despite some surface similarities between Child and Powell � both worked in government, both drifted before discovering professional salvation in food, both were blessed with husbands with an above-and-beyond reserve of patience and boosterism � the two women couldn�t be more opposite in temperament, at least as portrayed in the film. Forget glass half-full or half-empty: The glass is very nearly brimming over for Julia (Streep), so sunny and spirited and utterly can-do is she. Meanwhile, Julie (Adams, flat and wan) is scraping bottom: Just shy of 30, she�s sunk by depression and disappointment, resentful of her job (as a caseworker for the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan), her higher-achieving friends, her recent move to Queens, and her half-finished novel. As an outlet, her husband Eric (Messina) urges her to start a blog, which becomes the Julie/Julia Project � 365 days, 524 recipes. As Julie works her way through aspics, boeuf bourguignon
, and lobster humidor (the last of which is tackled in a funny set-piece that concludes with Eric singing, with a tip of the hat to the Talking Heads, �lobster killer, qu'est-ce que c'est
?�), Ephron jogs the film back to the Fifties, exploring the origins of these recipes. In postwar Paris, Julia is the directionless wife of an American diplomat named Paul Child (Tucci); at Paul�s encouragement, she enrolls at the Cordon Bleu, a move that eventually leads to her authoring a cookbook that changed the game for the housewife-cooks of America. Streep wears Child�s notorious height and heft beautifully, and the light touch she and Tucci bring to the funny, sexy, sophisticated Mr. and Mrs. Child is irresistible. Ephron does her best work in the Julia passages; there�s an overhead shot at the wedding reception of Julia�s sister that�s as lovely and graceful as anything Ephron has ever done � and she�s done a lot, as a tremendous wit and one of the most successful female writer-directors ever. For better or worse, Ephron has done more to define romantic comedy in the 21st century than any other single artist. Julie & Julia
 is a romantic comedy, too, but this time the romance is between two women, and one of them, truth be told, is a dud. Adams, usually so good at corralling her handle-with-care looks and little-girl voice, is a mousy, grouchy irritant here, but it�s not all her fault: Julie, as scripted, is a one-track, one-trick narcissist. I�d trade her entire half of the film just to hear again Streep sing-song �Dommage
!� in Child�s froggy voice. Shame, indeed.

“Julie & Julia’’ is the easiest thing Nora Ephron has ever done with a movie. There’s not much to argue with. Half the film is spent with Meryl Streep as Julia Child in France in 1949. Half is spent 50 years later with Amy Adams as Julie Powell, a Texan living in Queens, who devotes a year (and a blog) to exploring the recipes from the tome Child spent a decade completing, “Mastering the Art of French Cooking.’’

Ephron has adapted two memoirs: Child’s “My Life in France’’ and Powell’s “Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen.’’ And the movie she’s built out of them is more than a tale of two women (although it is certainly that). It’s a tale of two different ages for women. The movie is lighter than that sounds. Ephron doesn’t make dissertations. She makes “You’ve Got Mail.’’

So the movie glides, for more than an hour, like butter in a hot skillet. But it doesn’t glide witlessly. We jump back and forth between France, where Child is the 36-year-old wife of Paul Child (Stanley Tucci), a Foreign Service officer, and New York, where Powell lives in a cute apartment above a pizzeria with her husband, Eric (Chris Messina).

The movie begins with neither woman really knowing what to do with herself. Child takes French classes, learns to play bridge, tries hat making. None of it suits her. She winds up trying to enroll in the Cordon Bleu culinary school, over the objections of an imperious headmistress who, once Child is accepted, wishes her nothing but ill. These scenes of this giant, vaguely slouchy American woman (Child stood 6 foot 2) towering over tiny, meticulous men at a counter are a riot. One of her goals is to master the art of the minced onion. She sets her knife to dozens, which gives Tucci an opportunity to do some tickling pinpoint slapstick upon seeing and presumably smelling the eye-watering aroma that a pitcher’s mound of chopped onions produces.

This is blissful moviemaking. Much of the pleasure we have in watching it comes from seeing Tucci and, obviously, Streep connect. But it’s also the effortlessness Ephron reveals in bringing it all together. There could have been something cartoonish about Streep, who usually appears to be standing on a box to approximate Child’s height. But beneath each of these scenes, between Streep and Tucci, and Streep and the women playing her French coauthors of “Mastering the Art of French Cooking’’ (Linda Emond and Helen Carrey) and her sister (Jane Lynch), between Streep and the vegetables playing the food, is a deep, abiding joy. It’s not just the onions that bring a tear to the eye.
The image of Streep’s china-plate face topped with Child’s curled red hair is automatically amusing. But she sings in Child’s congested falsetto with an uncanny blend of phlegm and melody. It’s Child in the key of Streep. (“What
 could this
 mean?’’ she intones, poring over an entry in a Larousse dictionary.) Ephron expresses a loud vote of confidence in her star’s interpretation when she sits the Powells down on the sofa to laugh at Dan Aykroyd’s “Saturday Night Live’’ version of Child. The director is showing us the difference between inspired sketch comedy and actorly soul.

People who knew or worshiped Child will question some of the movie’s details. Did she and Paul, for instance, really have this much sex? Was he this romantic? (“Where’s my big sprig?’’ Paul says to his wife.) But that misses the larger point of these scenes. When in an American movie do regular people have that much sex? Plus  - and this is important  - Stanley Tucci is very sexy.

Ephron understands this marriage, this woman, her friendships, the hassles not only of finishing a massive book but getting it published. Ephron doesn’t seem to find the same fulfillment in her movie’s modern New Yorker. Powell’s decision to start a blog stems from frustration with her job at the Lower Manhattan Development  Corporation, taking calls from people waiting for money after 9/11. She’s not the go-getter her friends are. There’s a funny restaurant scene between Powell and some girlfriends whom she dislikes seeing (“Ritual cobb salad. Dreading. Dreading. Dreading’’). She’s a dolphin. The girlfriends are sharks. One of them writes a pitying profile of her for New York magazine.

I imagine part of Ephron’s attraction to Powell as a character is that she’s as whimsically old-fashioned in some ways as Ephron’s other heroines. Powell cooks from Child’s books in pearls, for one thing. The spiky, pouty, altogether marvelous Mary Lynn Rajskub plays Powell’s best friend, but you’d be forgiven for wondering whether her true cosmic sisters are any of the women Meg Ryan has played in Ephron’s other movies. There is as much tenderness and truth about friendship in this half of the movie as there is the other. But the joy of cooking is replaced here by the stress of it. Killing a lobster, boning a duck: We’re too wimpy for that.

A few people have worried that Adams’s half of the movie isn’t as lively or as brightly lit as Streep’s (it isn’t)  - or that Adams isn’t Streep. But it isn’t that the Adams half suffers from Adams  not being Streep. It’s that Julie suffers (as all American cooks do) from not being Julia. And this is why the Powell parts of the film work. It’s Ephron’s way of coming to terms with a real consequence of post-feminism. Powell is a woman in a job she hates who finds a source of liberation doing something certain liberated women still see as oppressive housework.

She turns to Child’s book partly as therapy, partly as anthropology. Cooking used to be about cooking, but in so many ways it’s became about politics, and the politics loosely start to take their toll on Powell’s marriage. Powell’s loving husband, having been trained to accept her as a professional equal, now has to learn to take his wife’s kitchen work seriously. Paul Child is just as fully evolved, but free of any angst over his wife’s success. He’s rooting for her.

Ephron works best when telling tandem stories. The paramours-to-be in “When Harry Met Sally. . .,’’ “Sleepless in Seattle,’’ and “You’ve Got Mail’’ talked and typed their way into idealized romances (gallingly so, in the case of “You’ve Got Mail’’). This time the two halves don’t meet physically or philosophically. Powell’s project becomes a media sensation, but rumor has it that Child finds it frivolous and doesn’t approve (she didn’t). So this might be the first of Ephron’s romantic duplexes to culminate in heartbreak. It also might be the first that manages to comment on itself. The unbearable lightness of some of Ephron’s moviemaking finally meets the sting of her essays. Ephron  has been guilty of frivolity, too. But in “Julie &  Julia,’’ she doesn’t merely concede that food is life. She celebrates it.

Julia Child, no insult to say, was a lovably preposterous figure. Standing in the kitchen of her PBS series The French Chef , which debuted in 1963, she was scarily tall (6'2''). Leaning down, she would press those linebacker shoulders into the chicken she was butter-massaging, describing the process in that famously exacting, high-pitched warble   a singsong quaver with a squawk of hysteria running through it. In Julie & Julia , Nora Ephron's vivaciously wry and affectionate dramatization of how Julia Child became...Julia Child , the woman who taught America to cook, Meryl Streep plays Julia as a very grand figure of fun. Streep has made herself over so that she looks as tall and gawky as Big Bird (she's also just as disarmingly cheery), and she exquisitely mimics that voice  the sound of a tipsy Victorian headmistress who has lost control of her flock.
Julie & Julia  is structured as a two-part culinary adventure: The movie cuts back and forth between the true-life stories of two quirkily ambitious, self-invented strivers from vastly different eras. (It's based on both of the women's memoirs.) There's Julia, who devotes herself, right up to the early '60s, to co-writing, and finding a publisher for, Mastering the Art of French Cooking , which will be the very first French cookbook ever written in English. And there's Julie Powell (Amy Adams), a post-9/11 cubicle worker with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, who in 2002 decides to save herself, and her husband (Chris Messina), from the doldrums by retreating after work to their cramped kitchen in Queens and cooking every recipe in that book  all 524 of them  in one year, while writing a blog diary about the experience. You could say that Julie & Julia  is the first Nora Ephron movie that isn't  a romantic comedy. Only that wouldn't be quite right. Not only is the film tartly witty, it's about a very deep love affair: the one between Julia Child and the endless dinner party she thinks life can be, a party Julie extends, with ardent and neurotic intensity, into the present day.
Julia arrives in Paris, where her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci), has been stationed by the OSS (the year is 1949), and when she sits down to her first Continental meal  it's a savory sole meunière  she can't believe how tangy-good it is. Streep makes Julia's coos of pleasure as delighted as a baby's gurgle. We're invited to coo, and laugh, along with her, as the camera ogles the food  which it will continue to do, with taste-bud-teasing bliss, throughout the movie. Julia, a former clerk at the OSS herself (she mockingly hints that she's been a spy), is casting about for something to do, so she talks her way into the Cordon Bleu cooking school, where she's like Lucille Ball in basic training. Walking into the classroom, which is full of male (and only male) chefs, she tries, with abandon, to slice a pile of onions, and then perfects the skill at home by dicing a mountain of them.
It doesn't take long to get used to the funny, goose-honk perfection of Streep's impersonation. Only then, in fact, do we really start to connect to the serious, life-loving performance behind it. Julia's gangly eagerness conceals a will of iron, as well as a generosity of spirit that's too passionate to be merely funny. She's a woman who wants to feed everyone, gloriously  herself and her husband, her friends and the world.
The Julia half of Julie & Julia  is irresistible, the Julie half less so. Not that it doesn't work , exactly. Amy Adams nails the obsessiveness of Julie's devotion to her muse, Julia. She also captures the tactile pleasures, and challenges, of cooking (how in God's name does one bone a duck?). And Ephron gives us nothing less than the first full-scale Hollywood portrait of the life of a blogger, in all its creative fire and solitary, caffeinated, how many comments did I get?  midnight narcissism. Yet the movie wants to make Julie an edgy ''bitch'' and soften her at the same time, which doesn't exactly jell. What does jell is the drama of two women, hungry for recognition, sharing their earthy love of the kitchen across the decades and the generations. Though hardly a perfect soufflé, Julie & Julia  is the movie American foodie culture has been waiting for. It hooks you up, happily, to your inner top chef.

 In an understated but nonetheless climactic scene in Nora Ephron’s “Julie & Julia,” Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her editor, Judith Jones (Erin Dilly), struggle to come up with a title for the  culinary doorstopper Julia has spent the past eight years composing. It’s not an especially suspenseful moment — pretty much anyone who has cooked an omelet knows what the book is called — but it gives Ms. Ephron and the audience a chance to savor the precise nature of Julia Child’s achievement.  The book is “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” — not “How To” or “Made Easy” or “For Dummies,” but “Mastering the Art.” In other words, cooking that omelet is part of a demanding, exalted discipline not to be entered into frivolously or casually. But at the same time: You can do it. It is a matter of technique, of skill, of practice.  The impact of that first volume of “Mastering the Art,” and of Child’s subsequent television career (which is mostly tangential to the movie’s concerns), is hard to overstate. The book stands with a few other postwar touchstones — including Dr. Benjamin Spock’s “Baby and Child Care,” the Kinsey Report and Dr. Seuss’s “Cat in the Hat”  —  as a publication that fundamentally altered the way a basic human activity was perceived and pursued.  Not that Ms. Ephron’s breezy, busy movie traffics in such sweeping historical ideas, except occasionally by implication. Nor does she infuse the happy, well-fed life of her Julia (the main source for whom  is a memoir Child wrote with Alex Prud’homme, her great-nephew) with too much grand drama. “Julie & Julia” proceeds with such ease and charm that its audacity — a no-nonsense, plucky self-confidence embodied by the indomitable Julia herself — is easy to miss.  Most strikingly, this is a Hollywood movie about women that is not about the desperate pursuit of men. Marriage is certainly the context both of Julia’s story and of Julie’s (about whom more in a moment), but it is not the point. The point, to invoke the title of a book whose author has an amusing cameo here (played by Frances Sternhagen), is the joy of cooking.  In the vernacular of many American kitchens, “Mastering the Art” is better known simply as “Julia,” and many a kitchen debate has been settled by an appeal to its authority. Should we separate the eggs? Turn the roast? What does Julia say?  In 2002, more than half a century after Julia and her husband, Paul, arrived in France — a debarkation that provides the movie’s opening scene  —  a young woman named Julie Powell decided to answer that question in the most literal and systematic way imaginable. A would-be writer working at a thankless office job and living with her husband in Long Island City, Queens, Ms. Powell spent a year cooking every single recipe in “Mastering the Art” and writing a blog about the experience. The blog led to the memoir that provided Ms. Ephron’s movie with its title and the lesser half of its narrative.  Trimming some fat from Ms. Powell’s rambling book (and draining some of the juice as well), Ms. Ephron’s script emphasizes the parallels between the lives of her leading characters, who never meet. (They appear on screen together only when Julie watches Julia on television). Julie (Amy Adams) and Julia have loving, supportive husbands — the affable Chris Messina is Eric Powell; the impeccable Stanley Tucci is Paul Child — who only occasionally express impatience with their wives’ gastronomic obsessions. (Paul by arching an eyebrow, Eric by storming out of the apartment.)  Both women take up cooking out of a restless sense of drift  — “I need something to dooooo,” Julia exclaims — and both pursue it in the service of a latent but powerful ambition. Publishing success is the happy ending to both tales, and Ms. Ephron, a literary and journalistic star before she was a filmmaker, is unequivocal in her celebration of the joys of such triumph.  Julie, in an early scene, is humiliated by a table full of college friends who flaunt their BlackBerrys, assistants, real estate deals and lucrative glossy-magazine gigs. But by means of failed aspics and triumphant sauces, Julie shows them all up. And Julia, similarly, overcomes the xenophobia and sexism of the French culinary establishment and the myopia of an American publisher and becomes the person we know as Julia Child.  As does Ms. Streep. By now  this actress has exhausted every superlative that exists and to suggest that she has outdone herself is only to say that she’s done it again. Her performance goes beyond physical imitation, though she has the rounded shoulders and the fluting voice down perfectly.  Often when gifted actors impersonate real, familiar people, they overshadow the originals, so that, for example, you can’t think of Ray Charles without seeing Jamie Foxx, or Truman Capote without envisioning Philip Seymour Hoffman. But Ms. Streep’s incarnation of Julia Child has the opposite effect, making the real Julia, who died in 2004, more vivid, more alive, than ever.  In Mr. Tucci Ms. Streep finds, as in “The Devil Wears Prada,” a perfect foil. Like the character he plays, he is gallant and self-assured and able to assert a strong sense of his own presence even as he happily cedes the center of attention. Together, their mastery of the art is so perfect that even quiet, transitional scenes between them are delightful. (And when Jane Lynch shows up as Dorothy, Julia’s sister,  the delight ascends to an almost indecent level of giddiness).  If only Mr. Tucci and Ms. Streep were in every movie, I thought to myself at one point, as, in a state of rapture, I watched them sit still on a couch looking off into space.  The problem is that when they aren’t on screen in this movie, you can’t help missing them. Ms. Adams is a lovely and subtle performer, but she is overmatched by her co-star and handicapped by the material. Julia Child could whip up a navarin of lamb for lunch, but Meryl Streep eats young actresses for breakfast. Remember Anne Hathaway in “The Devil Wears Prada”? Amanda Seyfried in “Mamma Mia!”? Neither do I.  The deck is further stacked against Ms. Adams by the discrepancy between Ms. Powell’s achievement and Ms. Child’s, and by a corresponding imbalance in Ms. Ephron’s interest in the characters. The conceit of parallel lives is undone by the movie’s condescending treatment of Julie and also by its ardent embrace of the past at the expense of the present.  From the very start, Paris in the late ’40s and early ’50s is — well, it’s postwar Paris, a dream world of fabulous clothes, architecture, sex, food, cigarettes and political intrigue. And New York in 2002 is made, a little unfairly, to seem drab and soulless by comparison. Queens, demographically the most cosmopolitan of the five boroughs and something of a foodie mecca, is treated with easy Manhattanite disdain, as a punch line and punching bag.  The unevenness of “Julie and Julia” is nobody’s fault, really. It arises from an inherent flaw in the film’s premise. Julie is an insecure, enterprising young woman who found a gimmick and scored a book contract. Julia is a figure of such imposing cultural stature that her pots and pans are displayed at the Smithsonian. The fact that Ms. Ephron, like Julie herself, is well aware of this gap does not prevent the film from falling into it. All the filmmaker’s artful whisking can’t quite achieve the light, fluffy emulsion she is trying for.  But an imperfect meal can still have a lot of flavor, and the pleasures offered by this movie should not be disdained. Julia Child knew what to do with a broken sauce or a half-fallen soufflé:  serve it anyway, with flair and without apology. What would Julia say? What she always said: Bon appétit!  “Julie and Julia” is rated PG-13. It has  mild profanity, and the indulgence — in exquisite moderation — of a few choice vices.

It should come as no surprise that Meryl Streep's delightfully daffy turn as Julia Child, the woman who demystified French cuisine for American households, is the freshest ingredient in "Julie & Julia." Otherwise, this middling melange of Child biopic and contempo dramedy feels overstuffed and predigested as it depicts two ladies who found fame and fulfillment in their respective eras by cooking and writing about it. Despite the lack of shared screen time, the reteaming of "Doubt" duo Streep and Amy Adams under the femme-friendly imprimatur of writer-director Nora Ephron should yield tasty returns for this self-satisfied foodie fairy tale.
"Julie & Julia" shares its title with Julie Powell's barbed-and-bubbly 2005 book about her plan to chop, stir, bake and whip her way through Child's seminal 1961 cookbook, "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." Powell's blog devoted to her crazy yearlong experiment, dubbed "The Julie/Julia Project," developed enough of a following to earn her a book deal and, as the end titles note with characteristic cuteness, inspire this movie. Probably aware that Powell's story alone wouldn't sustain an entire feature, Ephron opted to divide the film's 122-minute running time between Julie and Julia, also drawing material from the latter's posthumously completed 2006 memoir, "My Life in France."
Upon arriving in Paris in 1948 with her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci), who has taken a job at the American embassy, Julia (Streep), a self-described "36-year-old, rather loud and unserious Californian," is enraptured by French culture in general and French cuisine in particular. The pic efficiently traces Julia's determined rise from impassioned gourmand to master cook, from her education alongside unfriendly male competition at the Cordon Bleu school to her friendship with fellow epicureans Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and Louisette Bertholle (Helen Carey) -- her eventual collaborators on the 524-recipe cookbook that no publisher would initially accept.
Meanwhile, in a rickety Gotham apartment circa 2002, Julie (a redheaded Adams), alarmed at the prospect of turning 30 and having little to show for it, embarks on her insane assignment -- working as a government secretary by day, cooking and blogging by night. Fortunately, Julie's husband, Eric (Chris Messina), loves her enough to put up with her exaggerated mood swings whenever a dish goes awry, though his patience and sensitivity wear thin as the project drags on.
And so the film implies a kinship between two women who never meet, united across time and space by their love of butter, their doting husbands, their search for meaning through pleasure and their struggles to see their work in print. (Call it "Publisher-less in Paris.") The crucial difference, one Ephron doesn't seem to grasp, is that while Julie courts the fickle attentions of the blogosphere and the media, Julia yearns to create something of lasting value, a work with genuine potential to enrich people's lives. Ironically, the pic's decision to foreground Julia's life only ends up trivializing it; by conflating the characters so neatly, "Julie & Julia" becomes the slick, presumptuous vanity project that Powell's book was not.
Doing her formidable best to counteract these drawbacks is Streep, whose 5-foot-6 frame makes her an imperfect physical match for the 6-foot-2 Julia, but who proves more than up to the challenge of tackling this beloved celebrity's equally outsized personality. Delivering an elegant approximation of the woman's distinctly flutelike vocal pitch and endearing mannerisms, Streep abundantly conveys the warmth, rich humor and joie de vivre so evident in Julia's TV appearances and her writing. She and Tucci (as fine a foil here as he was in "The Devil Wears Prada") etch moving portraits of two people who can scarcely conceal their delight at being married to each other.
As a more prosaic and bickersome modern couple, Adams and Messina acquit themselves well enough; Adams, rather miraculously, manages not to sink under the weight of her character's cloying perkiness and weepy hysterics. The overall tone of the present-day material strikes familiar, unsubtle romantic-comedy beats, with a few catty dashes of "Sex and the City" and "Bridget Jones's Diary" thrown in to taste.
While Ann Roth's costumes and Mark Ricker's production design nail the dual milieus with impressive versatility, the Paris scenes feel slightly gauche and unconvincing; commercial considerations likely account for the near-total absence of French dialogue. Most disappointingly, aside from the occasional glimpse of boeuf bourguignon
, the film misses a clear opportunity to offer glorious culinary eye candy on the level of "Babette's Feast" or "Eat Drink Man Woman." Whatever auds make of "Julie & Julia," it's hard to imagine that Julia Child herself, an unapologetic Francophile with one hell of an appetite, would have been much of a fan.

It was the best of movies. It was the worst of movies. Which is to say: There's half of a great movie in Julie & Julia —but since Meryl Streep  has already starred in one titled Julia  (Fred Zinnemann 's penultimate feature in 1977), perhaps it was merely necessary to tack on the "Julie" half to distinguish Nora Ephron 's butter-basted effort from its Lillian Hellman 's mayonnaise-covered predecessor. (Sorry. So sorry.) If nothing else, that tortured introduction reveals which  half is the great half—the one featuring Streep as Julia Child , but of course, and not the Smithsonian -enshrined, encased-in-amber, forever-in-reruns Julia Child, either, but the toweringly lean and tremendously lustful Julia Child, new to France in the late 1940s and ready to devour everything in sight, even her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci ).
But back to them in a moment—best to skim the film off the film first: in this case, the half of Julie & Julia  adapted from Julie Powell 's blog-turned-memoir from which the movie takes its name. The tome is an absolutely delightful read in which Powell uses Child and, in particular, Child's 1961 cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking , to discover "what it takes to find your way in the world," as she wrote. Yet all Ephron saw in that tale was just another dreary romantic comedy about a woman, played by a slow-simmering Amy Adams , who hates her job (tending to the families of people killed in the World Trade Center  attacks—Powell's office was perched over the gaping wound), hates her friends (climbers as self-obsessed as she), hates her apartment (in Queens, over a pizzeria), and escapes into cooking and writing about cooking till she leaves behind her supportive husband, Eric, played by Chris Messina , but only briefly, whew . The book, originally shopped as a stand-alone project, could have made for a scrappy, scrumptious indie—all the outer-borough funk and main-course "fucks" of the book left intact, Bridget Jones   doused in Béarnaise sauce and vodka gimlets. But Ephron has excised the heart (and gizzard and liver and so on) from Powell's tale. How could the writer-director not see that she had rigged this patently unfair game of Compare and Contrast?
Still, if Ephron is to be criticized for treating Powell like a soggy sitcom creation, she (along with Streep) should be celebrated for rendering Child flesh and blood—all passion and pleasure, even during moments of self-doubt. Not in forever has a movie character been this joyful, this playful, this much fun to be around. Her delight is infectious from the first moment we see her, ogling the sights and sounds of Paris upon her and Paul's arrival there in 1948; the first time we actually meet her, Julia is mmmmmm -ing over the sight and smells and first bite of fish melting in butter. Ephron captures the earthy delights and everyday thrills found both in Child's cookbook and 2006 autobiography, My Life in France ; the filmmaker gets us to positively revel in everything Julia, from the perfect slicing of an onion, to the publication of a cookbook a decade in the making, to the afternoon "naps" she and Paul would enjoy between feasts. Yes, indeed, Julia Child as sex object!
Streep and Tucci are a joy to be around—such pragmatic romantics. Paired again after The Devil Wears Prada , in which Tucci played whipping boy to Streep's ice queen, they have the rapport of bygone on-screen couples—William Powell  and Myrna Loy , maybe, partners in crime. Every slight glance feels absolutely natural; every kiss, deeply felt. Perhaps someone will do for Julie & Julia  what one enterprising Star Wars  fan did for Episode I: The Phantom Menace , when he released a bootleg shorn of that annoyance named Jar-Jar Binks and titled it The Phantom Edit . Surely there's room enough in this world for two Meryl Streep movies named Julia .
