Canny casting and a sly anti-consumerist message give this splashy big-screen treatment of the eponymous comic strip (by Austinite Michael Fry and former Texan T. Lewis) extra appeal for grownups, but like a lot of animated fare, it�s overly busy, lacking the comic�s gentle, contemplative air. I�m also sad to report that what the MPAA calls �mild comic action� is a sort of Acme-Laboratories slapstick violence, and there�s a scaryass bear (voiced by Nolte) who may terrify small-fries by growling, �And don�t even think about running away because I will hunt you down and kill you.� Yet DreamWorks� entry in the cartoon-blockbuster sweepstakes (alongside Fox�s Ice Age: The Meltdown
 and Pixar�s upcoming Cars
) has its pleasures � if you can roll with ursine death threats and an exterminator (Church) jonesing for critter blood. Rakish raccoon R.J. (Willis) wanders into the master-planned bubble of El Rancho Camelot � �Your gateway to the good life� � in search of junk food, but he finds something more: a surrogate family of gentle wilderness creatures shepherded by Verne (Shandling), a cautious and put-upon turtle. (�I�m naturally tentative. There�s even places in my shell I�ve never been,� Shandling moans.) Verne and the gang � squirrel Hammy (Carell), skunk Stella (Sykes), possums Ozzie and Heather (Shatner and Lavigne, sadly less compelling as a father-daughter combination than you might expect), and a family of sweetly Midwestern porcupines (Levy and O�Hara) � awaken from their hibernal slumber to find their woods entirely surrounded by a massive hedge, beyond which lie acres of McMansions guarded by a hysterical homeowners� president (Janney). Everyone needs to eat, so the animals broach the hedge and discover chips, Dr. Phil, and SUVs. (�Humans ride around in it because they�re slowly losing their ability to walk,� R.J. explains.) The film retains most of the strip�s charm when it slows down to a cute, fuzzy satire of human foibles, and the animation technology allows a wonderful funhouse view of suburban living in the expository scenes. The cast is uniformly good, but Carell steals it as Hammy, the strip�s lovable dingbat. Carell has a knack for investing cartoonish characterizations with undeniable heart, and Hammy�s addle-brained innocence is a perfect fit. Unfortunately, the script (by no fewer than four writers) is more dialogue than story, and it confuses mayhem with action, like too many family entertainments (Chicken Little
, I�m looking in your direction). Three songs by Ben Folds (including a reworked version of �Rockin� the Suburbs�) neither add to nor detract from the project, which could be the faintest praise ever. With more attention to the fundamentals of narrative, Over the Hedge
 wouldn�t be so over the top. (See

What's a child to make of ''Over the Hedge"? Or really: What do you show the kid who, in terms of computer-animated talking-animal cartoons, has seen it all?
The same-old same-old, apparently. ''Over the Hedge" is another movie about scarily expressive animals who are more human than humans. This one is not as loud as ''Madagascar" or as lousy as ''The Wild." There is actually an occasional moment of inspiration, but as an experience, the movie doesn't hog much shelf space in the memory.
The look is sharp, but even that isn't very distinct. These pictures are starting to take on a blinding metallic glaze -- not a bad compliment for a movie whose plot functions as video game with a moral at the end.
Unfolding a story about the ecological evils of urban sprawl, ''Over the Hedge" presents a bunch of hibernating critters waking up to find a massive hedge sprung up in their forest. It's a most alluring green, and stretches on infinitely.
Helpfully, RJ the raccoon (Bruce Willis) arrives to explain that it's the sign of a subdivision. On the other side of that massive hedge is food, glorious food. RJ is a stranger to the close-knit crew, which includes a meek turtle (Garry Shandling); a porcupine family (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara voice the parents); a squirrel with ADHD (Steve Carell); and, of course, the sassy, unwieldy critter who sounds like a black woman. (In ''Madagascar," Jada Pinkett Smith played a hippo. In ''Ice Age: The Meltdown," Queen Latifah was a mammoth. This time it's Wanda Sykes, playing a skunk.)
Claiming to teach his new buddies to store food faster and more efficiently, RJ enlists their help in sneaking over the hedge to pilfer some goodies. They don't know he's a deceitful glutton. But we do: The raccoon is kind of a skunk.
The movie is based on a comic strip that tried to illustrate human foibles from the point of view of a raccoon and a turtle. The strip's stab at joke-sociology inspires the movie's only true moment of wit. When RJ explains to the gang that humans worship food, the filmmakers come up with a truly brilliant montage that says so. Unfortunately, it lasts about 60 seconds.
Eventually, the critters wind up squaring off against a hideous real-estate obsessive (Allison Janney, in a role uglier than Sykes's) and the pest-control expert (Thomas Haden Church) she hires to annihilate them.
We know where all this is going and how it will end (we've seen ''Toy Story 2" and, my, how sorely its eloquence and soulfulness are missed). The good news is that Carell's over-caffeinated rodent steals the movie (you half expect him to unzip the costume and come out for air). And GPS, an SUV, and video games are put to clever use.
But the last 30 minutes (featuring a by-the-numbers chase sequence) seem to last forever, and the songs by Ben Folds suggest that he's through being crafty and ready to become as easy-listening as Randy Newman has.
Like that ''Ice Age" sequel, which took up the cause of global warming, ''Over the Hedge" is short on outrage. The animals are being encroached upon, but they're rarely up in paws over it. The filmmakers are obviously concerned about the rise of exurbs, but they shrug off the issue and stick to the formula of a talking-critters script instead.
Green space isn't all that's scarce. An exciting way to entertain our kids is on the verge of extinction, too.


         Offering little in the way of sophistication or memorable characters, the disappointingly pedestrian computer-animated "Over the Hedge" will be more entertaining for little tykes than their older siblings and parents, and would not seem out of place on Saturday morning television.
 
  Based on the comic strip of the same name by Michael Fry and T Lewis, the movie actually functions as back story, chronicling the meeting of its main characters: RJ, an independent-minded raccoon voiced by Bruce Willis, and Verne, an overly cautious turtle, voiced by Garry Shandling.
 


         






    Spring has not yet sprung and RJ has already gotten himself into trouble with Vincent (Nick Nolte), a hibernating bear. In trying to steal Vincent's winter stash of junk food, RJ not only wakes up the not-so-gentle giant but also manages to lose the load of Spuddies and other vending machine favorites in the process. Gruff-voiced Vincent gives him seven days to replace it all.
 
  In another part of the wilderness, a small band of critters is waking up from its own hibernation in a log. The improbable menagerie includes a fleet-of-foot but slow-of-mind squirrel named Hammy (Steve Carell); Stella, an attitudinal skunk (Wanda Sykes); father and daughter possums Ozzie and Heather (William Shatner and Avril Lavigne); a family of porcupines (headed by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara); and Verne, their timid leader. To their dismay, the woodland they call home has been surrounded by the menacing greenery of the title, beyond which lies a subdivision of exurban proportions that has apparently been built during the winter.
 
  RJ knows a world-class team of foragers when he sees one and hoodwinks them — over Verne's strenuous objections — into helping him build a war chest of food that he secretly plans to turn over to Vincent. The plan includes breaching the hedge — which the critters call "Steve" — and looting the home of Gladys (Allison Janney), a tightly wound human and president of the homeowners association.
 
  Fearing "the end of suburban tranquillity," Gladys hires Dwayne, a.k.a. the Verminator (Thomas Haden Church), a high-tech exterminator with nuclear-powered tools. Although DreamWorks characteristically splurged for an all-star voice cast, the filmmakers seem to value action over characterization. Depressingly generic, the anthropomorphized creatures could easily be plucked from any number of animated films over the last 70 years, and the two main humans are strictly one-dimensional.
 
  The frenetic, action-oriented (and fairly violent) set-pieces are well crafted, but without interesting characters it's only sporadically involving. Even when the inevitable Armageddon-like showdown revs up the film's final half-hour, directors Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick's pacing is sluggish.
 
  The film strangely backs away from its source material's intelligence, aiming lower on the comedy meter. The film replaces the usually mandatory scatological humor with frequent use of Stella's threatening aroma, and the emphasis on slapstick and pratfall humor is clearly aimed at kids too young to have read the comic strip.
 
  The work of Fry and Lewis, who are credited here as creative consultants, is built on the wry, Seinfeldesque observations of RJ and Verne commenting on the foibles of humanity as it encroaches on nature. And though there are some throwaway references to human gluttony in the movie, overall it lacks the strip's wit. By the end, the environmental message is subservient to the much more familiar themes of community and friendship.
 
 'Over the Hedge'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for some rude humor and mild comic action
 
 A DreamWorks Animation presentation. Directors Tim Johnson, Karey Kirkpatrick. Producer Bonnie Arnold. Screenplay by Len Blum and Lorne Cameron & David Hoselton, based on characters created by Michael Fry and T Lewis. Editor John K. Carr. Music Rupert Gregson-Williams, songs by Ben Folds. Production designer Kathy Altieri. Running time: 1 hour, 32 minutes [includes the short "First Flight").
 
 In general release.   

Don't get me wrong, I laughed like a [insert laughing animal of choice here] throughout Over the Hedge , the latest DreamWorks Animation project to provide career rejuvenation for famous-name actors employed to voice the neuroses of raccoons, porcupines, skunks, squirrels, possums, and turtles lost in suburbia. The characterizations are charming. The voice acting  is delightful. (A cast that includes Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, Garry Shandling, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Catherine O'Hara, and Eugene Levy covered in fur, quills, or shell is my idea of a good time.) The visual and verbal jokes are as bouncy and multilevel (hip height for adults, knee-slap-size for kids) as we have come, no doubt selfishly, to expect from DreamWorks. The songs are innocuous, as is the family-values lesson about how caring for one another is more fulfilling than caring only for oneself. Yeah, yeah. It sounds funnier coming from Bruce Willis as a raccoon.
I just wish I could shake the uneasy feeling that the movie, codirected by Karey Kirkpatrick and Antz 's Tim Johnson and based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T Lewis, is really about the terrorists winning. I mean, the cute, funny, resourceful animals are actually four-legged terrorists, out to punish hapless suburbanite humans everywhere, represented by Allison Janney as Gladys, a shrill, nosy, upwardly mobile Cruella De Vil from the local homeowners' association. (She's so evil, she wears a black pantsuit, drives an SUV, and clutches a lipstick-stained, Starbucksy cup.) I wonder, if the tables were turned and the humans were the ones violently raiding the wild, destroying habitats to hoard resources, we wouldn't feel quite so...oh, wait, we humans do that already.
The hedge, see, is what separates the innocent, cooperative, pacifist, nuts-and-berries-oriented creatures who live on one side of the wall of green (so awesome a sight that the populace names it Steve to soften their fright) from the terrors of the pleasures of suburban sprawl, with its strange, acquisitive humans, odd backyard  accoutrements, and abundance of discarded processed food. The hedge also beckons the resourceful raccoon who calls himself RJ (Willis) for the junk food he needs to repay a  territorial bear (Nick Nolte). It's RJ's sneaky goal to persuade the trusting many to help him load up his loot wagon. And if the de facto group leader, the turtle called Verne (Shandling), has qualms about the operation, RJ will appeal directly to the susceptible consumerist masses by introducing them to the joys of sugar rush and the uses of the universal remote control.
Togetherness and a tempered appreciation of occasional Dorito-like chips in a diet based on whole grains and bark prevail, of course. But back to the ridiculed biped population of this smoothly stitched satire: Gladys is all but burnt to a crisp and ready for the psych ward by the time nature triumphs. Just because she doesn't want a  raccoon in her pantry? That's harsh.

 Well, of course Nick Nolte makes sense as a bear — a big, grouchy, sleepy bear with a crackling, beautifully creaking voice that suggests too many late nights smoking far too many unfiltered cigarettes. That voice is one of the few charms in the  animated frolic "Over the Hedge," which features a menagerie of meticulously rendered, computer-generated creatures brought to something like life by a host of talented animators and some very fine actors, including Steve Carell, whose speed freak of a squirrel, Hammy, brings to mind Henry Hill just around the time he begins snorting too much of his product in "Goodfellas."  No doubt the people at DreamWorks who made "Over the Hedge" would prefer that their film bring to mind animated classics  like Disney's "Bambi" (or, as Hammy suggests, "Ice Age"), but no such luck. Although this tale about a group of woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors (based on Michael Fry and T Lewis's comic strip) has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee — the hair on the animal bodies stirs when they do —   no one bothered to pay commensurate attention to the screenplay.  The various writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks, allusions (there's a Rosebud moment) and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. That's particularly too bad since the recent alligator attacks in Florida prove that the story of human encroachment on animal turf is topical and rich in thematic possibility.  The story opens with RJ, a devious raccoon voiced by Bruce Willis, stealing a stash of packaged sugar and carbohydrates from a bear, Vincent (Mr. Nolte), whom he accidentally awakens. Having been roused from hibernation, and perhaps being naturally peckish, the bear threatens to kill RJ unless he replaces his goodies. RJ sets out on his mission quickly, only to stumble on a  gathering of animals faced with a terrifying new threat: a hedge that cuts them off from much of the rest of the woods. (And over the hedge? Humans living in a ticky-tacky planned community in Anywhere, U.S.A.)  Realizing that he can use these naïfs to do his work, RJ teaches them the joys of chips, doughnuts and other human fancies, thereby endangering their true animal selves.  With his flat, somewhat nasal intonation, Mr. Willis doesn't really sound like a raccoon; he would make a better guard dog. But Garry Shandling is wonderfully persuasive giving quavering, gentle intonations to a timorous turtle named Verne, the de facto leader of a rather unlikely mélange voiced by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (porcupines with children); William Shatner and Avril Lavigne (father-and-daughter possums); and Wanda Sykes (an unattached skunk, whose hectoring voice surely repels more strongly than her scent). Each animal has a broadly articulated characteristic or, more properly, a shtick. Daddy possum is 100 percent ham and periodically falls into a theatrical swoon; the  porcupines sound as if they migrated from Minnesota or at least count "Fargo" as a favorite flick. And so it goes, and goes.  There's more, including a couple of human villains (Allison Janney and Thomas Haden Church), but not all that much. It would be nice to report that the animals wreck the planned community and dance on its ashes, but, alas, the big theme here is the importance of family, as if the children who are the film's presumed audience needed the reminder, especially since Mom and Dad probably bought the tickets.  One imagines that, much like their adults, the tots would like to be entertained and perhaps even moved. The characters in classic Disney films like "Pinocchio" certainly learn life lessons, but the lessons have reach, ambition. Like great myths, these films give us characters that, even when blanketed in feathers and fur, learn what it is to be fully human, not just good little consumers.  "Over the Hedge" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There is some suggestive business between the skunk and a house cat.

Familiar, once-fertile soil has been tilled a time too often with "Over the Hedge." Despite a sprinkling of laughs and eye-catching moments, this adaptation of a popular comicstrip reps a middling effort from the house that "Shrek" built, a rather narrowly conceived tale that makes only modest hay from the overworked conflict between wildlife and encroaching humans. Given the B.O. generated by recent mediocrities like "Chicken Little" and "Madagascar," it's dangerous to underestimate what even a so-so computer-animated feature might do, so expect brawny returns and solid family support upon the May 19 opening for this first DreamWorks Animation presentation to be released by Paramount. 
Punning title refers to the cookie-cutter housing development that assorted critters, awakening from winter slumber, find surrounding their now-meager territory. In fact, the animals would probably ignore the threatening Homo sapiens altogether if it weren't for the dilemma of mischievous raccoon RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis), who's angered a giant bear by destroying his (junk) food supply and needs to replace it pronto if he doesn't want to be plunged into permanent hibernation.
RJ's quick fix is to relieve the humans of some of their abundant grub. To do so, he tries to enlist the help of some expert scavengers -- skeptical turtle Verne (Garry Shandling), frisky skunk Stella (Wanda Sykes), now-you-see-him-now-you-don't squirrel Hammy (Steve Carell), papa possum Ozzie (William Shatner) and daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne) and a porcupine family headed by Penny (Catherine O'Hara) and Lou (Eugene Levy) -- whom he cures of their reluctance by anointing them with the dust of cheese nachos.
Amusing as this is intended to be, it's also mildly unsettling to see the quintessence of junk food being so successfully employed in the service of psychological persuasion. But so it is, as the gang undertakes a series of stealth garbage raids on the pristine homesteads.
While the set-up is engaging and sympathetic enough, it's also quite a small conceit, one that feels a bit old-hat. It's populated by bordering-on-cutesy forest dwellers that could easily have co-starred in a Disney movie of the '40s or '50s. True, Uncle Walt didn't have his fur balls emerge from hibernation and announce how badly they had to go to the bathroom, but the differences on the character side are otherwise rather negligible.
Design-wise, the pic falls a bit short of an A grade as well. Backgrounds are sharp, but the animals, especially the chubby ones, resemble puffy dolls and lack the subtlety of facial expression of the best computer-animated fare. Similarly, the two main humans are one-dimensionally characterized to exhibit a single trait: Evil.
These characters include Gladys (Allison Janney) a hysterical control freak who instigates the campaign against the four-legged interlopers and hires the Verminator (Thomas Haden Church), a high-tech pest eradicator. The Verminator's battle-plan mentality and elaborate installations stir some late-on fun, but the formulations of the script by Len Blum, Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and Karey Kirkpatrick, based on characters in the 11-year-old comicstrip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, are mostly conventional and unsurprising.
Directors Tim Johnson ("Antz," "Sinbad") and Kirkpatrick (writer of "Chicken Run") supply the requisite zip, and thesps' line readings are energetic, but "Over the Hedge" simply lacks the inventiveness, wit and sense of delight that have distinguished the best of the computer-animated generation of pictures. Three new songs by Ben Folds are vanilla.

At this late date, it's hard to tell one digitally rendered talking animal from another. Madagascar   blends into Ice Age  looks like Shark Tale  sounds like Shrek   might as well be A Bug's Life  turns into Antz  feels like Chicken Little  could be Over the Hedge , which is really just Madagascar  in the suburbs anyway. Animated petting zoos were once glorious places to visit, tended to by masters who turned Walt Disney 's childhood fantasies into immortal fairy tales. Lady and the Tramp  all by its lonesome is worth a dozen of these meat-grinderscrude commodities, plush toys, and product placements in search of a story from which to hang their price tags.
It feels like I've already seen Over the Hedge  four times, after witnessing the parade of commercials for other junk its characters are pimping. Perhaps it makes perfect sense: The entire movie's built around a scenario that involves the stealing and hoarding of junk food. A swindling raccoon named RJ (Bruce Willis ) must fill the cave of a grizzly (Nick Nolte ) with grocery store goodies before he devours RJ instead. So he enlists the aid of some naive turtles and squirrels and possums and porcupines and skunksvoiced by the likes of Garry Shandling , Steve Carell , William Shatner , Wanda Sykes , and Avril Lavigne , because these movies are nothing without their famous voicesto sack the suburbs for some treats. It's been said of Over the Hedge , both the original comic strip and the movie, that it's intended as satirea jab at our unhealthy lifestyles of junk food and TV gorging. But you can't sincerely say something about the crassness of consumerism at the same time you're trying to unload the store.
