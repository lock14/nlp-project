MC Dave Chappelle knows how to make a happening. The party documented in this film was thrown by the richly rewarded Comedy Central show host well before the occurrence of his much-publicized disappearing act prior to the start of last year�s shooting season. His block party is a loose affair, with a feeling of spontaneity that extends to the film as well. The movie is a blend of comedy, music, and just plain hanging-out time that can�t really be described as a concert film, although it does feature some great performances by Erykah Badu, Mos Def, Kanye West, Dead Prez, Jill Scott, the Roots, and a reunited Fugees. As great as it is to see choice moments like the film�s scorching West performance of �Jesus Walks� or Lauren Hill�s moving rendition of �Killing Me Softly� or Badu chucking off her mightier-than-Angela-Davis �fro in the midst of a rainstorm, Block Party
�s most memorable scenes belong to the impromptu comedy of Chappelle. Although the party is set to occur in Brooklyn�s Bed-Stuy neighborhood, the film opens with Chappelle on his Ohio home turf handing out golden tickets to passersby that include entrance and round-trip bus transportation to the NYC show. His off-the-cuff joshing with local residents and shopkeepers � black and white, young and old � entertainingly demonstrates his quick wit and universal appeal. The highlight, of course, is his invitation to an entire college marching band he encounters while out recruiting and his spontaneous offer to hire two extra buses to haul the excited corps and their instruments to the Big Apple. The show itself is presented in snippets and is broken up with footage of the preproduction planning and rehearsals and shots of the general party scene. Chappelle is seen casually visiting with the students at the neighborhood nursery school once attended by Biggie Smalls and the dotty white couple that owns the ramshackle building in front of which the block party is being held. For all the visual flair associated with his feature film work, director Gondry sticks with the tried-and-true perfected during his years of shooting music videos. Along with his Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
 cinematographer Ellen Kuras (who is also the DP of Jonathan Demme�s Neil Young: Heart of Gold
, in current release), Gondry shoots the block party in a straightforward style that provides more a feel of the overall gestalt than the details of the location, lineup, or physical setup. No background material is going to help the viewer who isn�t already aware of why a Fugees reunion is such a cool thing to witness, but it�s impossible not to get caught up in this party�s good vibe.


Two years ago on a gray September day, the comedian Dave Chappelle held a noon-to-night concert in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Scores of New Yorkers were bused in from Manhattan and had no idea where they were going -- they didn't care. Kanye West, Mos Def, Erykah Badu, the Roots, Common, Big Daddy Kane, and Talib Kweli were among those who performed in the wind and rain. The next day the blogs, and later the magazines, were in a tizzy over the Fugees, who had recovered from Lauryn Hill's nervous breakdown and Pras and Wyclef Jean's spatting to consummate a reunion.
Being there must have been special. But watching this all happen in "Dave Chappelle's Block Party" is better. For one thing, you won't get wet. For another, Michel Gondry, the music-video magician and director of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," was on the scene with a camera crew. The movie they've assembled is in the vein of 1973's "Wattstax," but it's much more than a concert documentary. It's a jubilant, civic-minded lollapalooza.
Yes, each performance is more transcendent than the last. Badu literally flips her Afro wig, then surfs the crowd. Dead Prez confirms that it's as crucial as Public Enemy, but in double time. Hill is as willowy-fabulous as 1970s Diana Ross. (When Pras says hearing her sing makes him want to cry, all I could think after seeing her do a luscious "Killing Me Softly" was "Me, too!") And had there been a house that day, Jill Scott would have brought it down.
But the more indelible contributions to the film are from the so-called little people.
The movie is indeed a block party, that great, seemingly bygone Saturday event when a street shuts down to celebrate itself. And because it is a block party, the artists in Chappelle's platinum hip-hop-R&B lineup are but a few stars in a neighborhood constellation that includes less famous folk. The community here is synthetic insofar as some of its members come from the workaday Dayton, Ohio, region, where Chappelle still lives; he goes back to cajole his neighbors to come east for his weekend shindig. But it's a community nonetheless. We can feel the love.
On the streets of Dayton, Chappelle hands out Willy Wonka-style golden tickets good for a round-trip bus ride to the show and a hotel stay, choosing black people and white people alike. This includes the woman who runs a local corner store and an affable pair of teenage Chappelle fans who tell Gondry they decided not to beat up a racist because the ensuing trouble wouldn't have been worth missing the party. Watching the Daytonites, most of whom didn't know each other before this invitation, asleep on the New York-bound bus is a wonderful moment of peace and harmony.
In Ohio, Chappelle, who pulled all this off before last year's notorious breakdown, also stumbles upon the Central State University marching band. His discovery leads to the happy moment when the kids find out they're going to New York. They explode with surprise. And during their street procession backing Kanye West on "Jesus Walks," the drum line and the majorettes seem more glamorous than the best-selling rapper playing their marshal. They know they're as good at their job as West is at his.
And that's the power of this movie. This is a black America that the music videos and movies don't show but eagerly sell to. The kids in that band and the two dudes who take a break from fighting racism are people, with ideas, aspirations, and personalities. They get to go backstage and they seem star-struck, but they also seem relieved to have their suspicions confirmed that the world is bigger than Ohio.
After we see the Fugees perform, Wyclef talks to a handful of the CSU students about what they'd do if they ran the country. One girl says she'd create more scholarships. Then they try joining him on the chorus of his song "President," which hadn't hit the radio yet. The moment feels like one of the classroom sessions from Lauryn Hill's solo record. It's piercing. I can't remember the last time someone in a movie bothered to ask a black girl what she thought about much of anything.
"Block Party" would play as an exquisite chaser to the tragic realism in Spike Lee's community masterpiece "Do the Right Thing," which is also set in Bed-Stuy and, in its own way, is a social musical. "Block Party" is the more rambling movie. Besides the priceless backstage moments are those when Gondry follows Chappelle as he makes his way around Bed-Stuy, talking, for instance, to the ancient owners of the amazing ruin that overlooks the block where the party is scheduled to be. (Chappelle calls the place a crack house. But it's the most Dickensian of crack houses.) He even visits the day-care center that the Notorious B.I.G. attended and that doubles as the concert's greenroom.
All these sequences are scattered among the concert performances. This structure has a great democratizing effect. For one day, there doesn't appear to be any useful difference between the haves and the have-nots -- between Jill Scott; the girl who, as president, would order up more scholarships; and the serious principal who walks Chappelle around her school. When Chappelle exclaims, "We shook up the world! We shook up the world!" it doesn't feel like an overstatement at all.

The college marching band, that benignly regimented music machine, has enjoyed a bit of a legacy in pop music, probably dating back to the title track of Fleetwood Mac's Tusk . But it isn't often you get to hear a marching band as supercharged and low-down, as rudely alive, as the one in Dave Chappelle's Block Party . On a makeshift stage at the end of a wide, crumbling alleyway in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Kanye West, looking casually dapper in a black T-shirt, sport coat, and gold chains, his body coiling and tensing to the beat, raps in what can only be described as a holy fury. At first, before you adjust to the velocity of his words, you may think that he's engaged in some sort of wily verbal assault. But then, just behind him, you catch the crooning of John Legend, as well as a chanted chorus (''Je-sus walks! Jesus walks!'') underscored by the stately, ominous hot-funk bounce of Ohio's Central State University band, whose players are arranged on the avenue nearby. West's rap is nothing less than a shout-out to God, and as you take in his confession, plus Legend's soaring plaint, plus the majestic blaring and swaying of the CSU band, the music surges to an ecstatic peak. All of a sudden, you remember what it's like when a concert movie isn't just glorified music-television fodder but, rather, an event that can restore your faith.
It helps that we got to see Chappelle, a few scenes earlier, sauntering up to the CSU band in the middle of a practice field in Dayton, Ohio, and asking the members, on the spot, to take a bus to New York and join the big rap/R& B concert he's organizing, which is set to take place on Sept. 18, 2004. With his shaved head, half-lidded eyes, and infectious grin that's always in danger of shutting off as quickly as it lights up, Chappelle has the look of a terminally mischievous cartoon bunny rabbit. In Dave Chappelle's Block Party , he exists in a perpetual limbo of satirical detachment, but only because he appears to be deviously fascinated by every person and situation he encounters. Like Richard Pryor, he's all feelers, with a mockery that flows, almost compulsively, out of his screwy generosity of spirit. Everything Chappelle does in this movie  from strolling, with bullhorn in hand, through his hometown of Dayton, offering ''golden tickets'' to random citizens, to standing up on stage and telling the band, over and over, to ''hit me!'' as he lives out the fantasy of being James Brown with each jangly-hilarious ''hit''  is done on impulse, as an inspired whim. Yet it's all presented with such catchy, soft-shoe enthusiasm that the film effectively dissolves the line between audience and performer.
Dave Chappelle's Block Party  is perhaps the first concert movie since Stop Making Sense to give you a blissful buzz. The buzz comes from the music, which has a loose, burning joy that's rare to behold in a live rap performance, and also from Chappelle's wicked prankster's glee, which spreads through the movie like a happy virus. Block Party  features Chappelle as its impresario, on-scene jester, and guiding spirit, and the director, Michel Gondry, echoing techniques he used in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , keeps cutting between the run-up to the concert and the event itself, staging the film as a series of flickering time leaps that work on you almost kinesthetically. After a while, you stop thinking about ''past'' and ''present.'' You're eager simply to be in the now, as content to watch a rapping Brooklyn waiter, who turns out to be a brilliant boaster, as you are to see an incendiary stage performance by Dead Prez, with their blistering indictments of white power.
The enthralling spirit of Dave Chappelle's Block Party , its mood of exuberant democracy, extends to every rap and soul performance in the film. A lot of the artists, like Kanye West or Common, summon an intensity of rhythm and attitude that didn't exist in hip-hop before the form went gangsta in the early '90s, yet all of them, in different ways, reject the get rich and f--- the world nihilism that ultimately brought gangsta rap to such a dead end. You can feel the longing for a more redemptive era when Erykah Badu, tearing off her Afro wig in the wind, does a gorgeous paean to ''back in the day when things were cool,'' and that spirit extends to Mos Def (who has the greatest dimples in rap), singing about his desire ''to be free,'' or the Roots, with Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane, playing the ferocious ''Boom.'' It's part of the rousing offhandedness of Block Party  that the finale, in which Lauryn Hill, with her china-doll face and luscious tremolo, reunites with the Fugees to do ''Killing Me Softly With His Song,'' is sublime, but no more so than a follow-up scene in which Wyclef Jean, off stage, leads a group of those CSU marching band members in his great reggae anthem ''President'' (''If I was president...''), letting them  and the audience  know that, in music as in the world, anything is still possible.

 AFTER pulling a widely publicized Houdini last year, Dave Chappelle has been popping up all over the place recently: "Inside the Actors Studio," "Oprah," a theater in Seattle for a gig and, now, Brooklyn's own Bedford-Stuyvesant for an exhilarating new film. "Dave Chappelle's Block Party" was shot in 2004, about eight  months before Mr. Chappelle, now 32, abruptly left the sketch-comedy show, walking away from a deal worth $50 million and into a storm of publicity and innuendo. "I wasn't crazy," Mr. Chappelle told Oprah Winfrey last month when he took the hot seat on her show. "But it's incredibly stressful." No kidding.  The performer left "Chappelle's Show" in a smog of rumor, some of which is still stinking up the Internet, where anonymous cowards offer conspiracy theories in the name of who knows what. Turning your back on big money apparently means one thing: you're nuts. But Mr. Chappelle looked and sounded profoundly sane on James Lipton's "Inside the Actors Studio" last month where, between cigarettes and jokes, he offered a mesmerizing, occasionally heart-melting glimpse into both the pressures of his fish-bowl existence and what it can mean for a black man when he makes white people laugh. Put another way, as he told Time magazine just weeks after splitting his show, "I want to make sure I'm dancing and not shuffling."  In "Dave Chappelle's Block Party," much of which unfolds over a single rainy day and night,  Mr. Chappelle looks and sounds alternately ebullient and weary. It was directed by Michel Gondry, the madcap genius behind "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," but in its tone and vibe feels like Mr. Chappelle's all the way. The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on "Chappelle's Show." The nominal idea, the comic explains on camera, was "the concert I've always wanted to see." The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown  in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul.  The film opens with down-home flavor as two men vainly try to jump-start a car in front of a field edged by housing projects. Mr. Chappelle tries to take a look at the engine, only to be ignored by the men (one even waves him away with his hand), who may be distracted by the dead engine or by the sounds of an approaching marching band. Speaking into a megaphone, Mr. Chappelle ticks off the acts that will appear later in the show, the names ballooning across the frame. It's an appealingly daffy sequence, in its absurdism the most Gondry-like moment in the film,  and it slyly makes the point that in the context of a real-life problem like a dead car, celebrity means absolutely nothing at all.  For most of the rest of the film, we bounce between preparations for the concert, which includes recruiting a marching band from Ohio's Central State University to play Bed-Stuy,  and the event itself. The other featured acts include Dead Prez, who spit out "Turn Off the Radio" as if pounding nails ("you wanna stop terrorists?/ start with the U.S. imperialists"), Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, the Roots (with Big Daddy Kane) and, in the film's biggest jolt, a newly reunited Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill and Pras Michel performing a few songs from their incarnation as the Fugees. Making true on his claim that every comic wants to be a musician, Mr. Chappelle also grabs a microphone, taps bongos and, in a lovely digression inside a thrift store, pays homage to one of his heroes, Thelonious Monk.  In its structure, at least, "Dave Chappelle's Block Party" recalls Mel Stuart's 1973 documentary "Wattstax," which intersperses talking-head interviews with highlights from a concert (popularly called the black Woodstock) staged at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a year earlier to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Watts riots. The interviews, which include men and women soul-rapping about the black American experience, along with some hilariously trenchant observations from Richard Pryor, work a galvanizing counterpoint to the headliners from Stax Records.  One difference between the films is that while Mr. Stuart lets the songs play out to the end, Mr. Gondry rather maddeningly cuts away in the middle of performances, which wreaks havoc on the documentary's rhythms and not in a good way.  The other difference between the films is race. "Wattstax" ends on a freeze frame of a black fist, an electrifying sign of the times. Outside of the Dead Prez and a cameo by Fred Hampton Jr., the son of the slain Black Panther activist, "Dave Chappelle's Block Party" appears fairly tame by comparison. It is and it isn't. Race is clearly never far from Mr. Chappelle's mind or, one imagines, that of most everyone else in the film, but neither is the complicating factor of celebrity. Talking to Time magazine, Mr. Chappelle said that "everyone around me says, 'You're a genius!'; 'You're great!'; 'That's your voice!' But I'm not sure that they're right." When someone as big as Mr. Chappelle blows up, the only color some see is green, which is something this enormously gifted man seems intent on correcting.  "Dave Chappelle's Block Party" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The language is strong but righteous.

Even as he continues on the comeback trail from his self-imposed exile, comic Dave Chappelle remains teasingly elusive. Fans of his inspired stand-up and shockingly funny Comedy Central series may feel there isn't enough of the star -- or of his freestyle comic fireworks -- in "Dave Chappelle's Block Party." But the formidable line-up of hip-hop and R&B artists should attract hordes of appreciative ticketbuyers to this enjoyable performance doc helmed by Michel Gondry ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"). And if Chappelle tends to be more of a genial host than star here, never mind: His full-tilt exuberance is richly amusing and highly contagious.
A heady spirit of spontaneity permeates the proceedings, suggesting the entire pic, much like the concert it documents, was conceived, planned and completed in a single burst of creative enthusiasm.
Early set-up scenes follow Chappelle around his Ohio hometown as he impulsively invites casual acquaintances, total strangers and even an entire college marching band to a free outdoor concert a few days hence in a Brooklyn neighborhood. (He offers free bus transportation to and from the venue.)
Cynics might suspect Chappelle is merely playing Mr. Nice Guy (and, perhaps, engaging in image enhancement) while Gondry's camera crew captures his every benevolent gesture. But the comic's playful interactions with everyday folks come across as every bit as funny and unforced as his rehearsal room bantering with superstar celebs.
Chappelle continues to pop up periodically throughout "Block Party," either as backstage kibitzer or on-stage introducer. (During one especially funny riff, he pays tongue-in-cheek tribute to the magic of James Brown.) Ultimately, however, the music and the musicians are the main attractions here.
Presented on Sept. 18, 2004, in occasionally inclement weather, the all-day concert includes stellar performances by the likes of Kanye West (tearing his way through "Jesus Walks" with messianic fervor), Erykah Badu (who matter-of-factly doffs her immense Afro wig after a brief rainfall), Dead Prez (swaggeringly militant with their "Turn off the Radio") and the Roots (backed by guest stars Kool G Rap and -- omigosh! -- Big Daddy Kane).
Aud response borders on the ecstatic when Chappelle intros a reunion of seminal hip-hoppers the Fugees -- including Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Prakazrel "Pras" Michael -- who pleasingly perform their trademark cover of "Killing Me Softly."
Using a small army of lensers armed with Super 16 cameras, Gondry (a musicvideo vet) achieves an impressive degree of detail with a minimum of vertiginous hand-held excess. Sound quality is exceptional. Even so, music fans might quibble about the relative brevity of some sets. Presumably, there will be extended performances on the ultimate DVD release.

Pondering a Dave Chappelle  film directed by Michel Gondry  conjures up some bizarre cinematic prospectsdancing mandalas of belligerent black George Bushes, perhaps, or Rick James  (bitch!) swirling through space-time wormholesbut Half Baked  fans be forewarned: The resolutely grounded Dave Chappelle's Block Party  offers no such otherworldly fantasies. A street-level document of a free all-star music concert thrown by the comedian in Bed-Stuy  in September 2004, Block Party  is all about the pleasures to be found in the very real world, albeit one enhanced by celebrity largesse. Which is to say, this picture remains faithful to the underlying affability of both Chappelle and Gondry, orchestrating a feel-good homestyle vibe that, while peppered with moments of sly political commentary, never harshes its own, slightly bittersweet mellow.
In time-honored concert-film structure, the backstage serves not just as backstory, but a purported inside track to the performers' just-like-us humanitya convention cemented as early as D.A. Pennebaker 's Don't Look Back . This careful conveyance of realness continues in Block Party , now informed by the gimmicky logic of talk shows and reality TV. The film opens in Dayton , three days before the concert, where erstwhile resident Chappelle distributes golden block-party tickets to surprised Ohioans: the clerk at his grocery store, a local barber, and various folks on the city's downtown sidewalks. The mostly black Central State University  Marching Band erupts in cheers when granted their invite to New York; a middle-aged white lady wonders if she should buy a thong for the event. The stunt is as old as Ed McMahon , but Chappelle's conversational ease makes his stint as "wee Willy Wonka " pleasantly unhokey. It also showcases his talents as unifier: After all, he's just about the only comedian who could yell "pussy hole" in publicas he does just to show one Daytonite that it's OK to swear in a movieand still garner Midwestern grandmas as fans. The rural locale isn't let off the hook as mere idyllic counterpoint to gritty New York. Two clean-cut lads tell how one got tossed the N-word on the golf course from an angry white male; astonished, they do nothing, not wanting anything to interfere with their getting on the bus to Bed-Stuy for Dave's party.
The event itselfevidently planned from concept to execution as much for Ellen Kuras 's artful camerawork as the neighborhood folkstakes place on an unassuming stretch of Brooklyn  street that includes a day care center once attended by Biggie Smalls . The show provides a locals-heavy lineup handpicked by Chappelle (many alums of his TV show), among them Mos Def , Kanye West , Talib Kweli , Dead Prez, and a reunited Fugees . Erykah Badu  appears in a vast Afro cloud that would put Angela Davis  to shame. Surprises include not just Big Daddy Kane  but Black Panther legacy Fred Hampton Jr. , who entreats the crowd to raise their hands in the air for more than just the music. So while the mostly black and Latino Brooklyn audience may be demographically pre-planned, it is also an act of momentary utopia; as Ahmir "?uestlove" Thompson  of the Roots  remarks to Chappelle backstage, both performers share the frequent experience of playing to audiences that don't look like them. Unfiltered observations like these give a critical edge to what otherwise would simply be a well-crafted concert doc shot during one gently sundowning autumn day.
