"Definitely, Maybe" is the kind of Hollywood romantic comedy the studios usually louse up, except this time they didn't. The movie's not an artistic breakthrough. It won't be on anybody's 10-best list at the end of the year. But it's agreeable and engaging and real enough in the right smallish ways, and it has an emotional maturity at odds with the high-grade plastic from which it's constructed. Maybe writer-director Adam Brooks has made a fluffy Woody Allen pastiche here, but it's arguably more pleasing than anything Allen himself has done lately.
One thing "Definitely, Maybe" isn't is the family film the ads make it out to be. Yes, Abigail Breslin - Little Miss Sunshine herself - plays Maya, the young daughter of divorcing dad Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds), and yes, she cajoles him into relating How He Met Mom as a mystery romance: He'll tell her about his three great loves, names changed to protect the guilty, and she has to guess which one he married.
Most of the movie takes place in flashback, though, in a 1990s Manhattan retooled as a date-movie playland. Once you get used to 30-something actors pretending to be 10 years younger, "Definitely, Maybe" settles into a cozy rhythm. Will arrives in New York to work on the 1992 Bill Clinton campaign, pledging fidelity to Emily (Elizabeth Banks), the college sweetheart he temporarily left behind. The movie tracks his growing career success and his disenchantments with both love and politics over the years, Clinton's bimbo eruptions flying by like seasonal geese migrations.
As Emily weaves in and out of the picture, so too do a career-minded journalist named Summer (Rachel Weisz) and April (Isla Fisher), the kind of movie free spirit that used to be called "kooky" and now just seems appealingly normal. You may think you know where all this is headed and you're probably right, but the getting there is funny and occasionally moving and sometimes even recognizably human.
For that thank Fisher, who saves the movie the same way she took "Wedding Crashers" to a new level all by her lonesome. In scene after scene this petite, red-haired goofball locates a fresh line reading, an unexpected facial expression, a bit of physical business that all imply April might actually have a life outside the movie. She's the oxygen "Definitely, Maybe" desperately needs.
Additional pleasures come from Kevin Kline as Summer's much older lover, a celebrated author who drips erudite scorn on Will like acid, and Derek Luke as the hero's friend and eventual business partner. Breslin is her own sweet ungainly self, finding the emotional center of her scenes as if she'd discovered it just lying there in the palm of her hand. She has yet to learn how to be false, even in a hankie-wringer of a climax that suggests Maya's headed for either sainthood or a nervous breakdown.
The jury's still out on Reynolds, at least as far as I'm concerned. Oh, he's sharp enough and he has a knack for volleying dialogue back at oblique, sardonic angles. There's something missing from the actor, though, some wrinkle of uniqueness or eccentricity, as though he'd come out of the factory not entirely finished. Likable yet resistant to genuine expressions of risk, joy, or pain, he keeps the movie in the shallow end of the pool.
Perhaps that's where it belongs, and no shame in that. "Definitely, Maybe" is a proper Valentine's Day bonbon - a candy heart that tastes sweet, crunches nicely, and dissolves in seconds.

In the saga of his love life that he weaves as a bedtime story for his preteen daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin), in Definitely, Maybe , Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) sounds like a man from Hope as he recounts the good old days of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Back then, Will was an idealistic campaign worker straight out of college in Wisconsin; today he's a Manhattan ad guy about to finalize his divorce from Maya's mother. The Clinton name-check (along with a trip down memory lane to the testimony of former Clinton paramour Gennifer Flowers) gives this value-enhanced romantic semi-comedy a gentle zing of timeliness, especially as the wife who stood by her man 16 years ago is now the Clinton seeking the presidency herself. And the pointed reference to the curious case of the Clinton relationship announces that Definitely, Maybe  is absolutely, probably more comfortable with human romantic complication than the usual stuff released on Valentine's Day.
If only Will the character weren't such a generic, pizzazz-less Ken doll of a Gen-X adult male! If only Reynolds the actor didn't vanish before our eyes even as he walks and talks! Will describes three uncommon women who have moved him from mild to warm over the years, disguising the names so his daughter can guess, in the end, which lady became her mommy. (That's an odd form of father-daughter bonding, true, but the big-city girl has just had her first sex-ed class.) There's Emily (Elizabeth Banks), the wholesome Midwesterner who feared that the bright lights of New York would change her beau; there's Summer (Rachel Weisz), the glamorous belles-lettres adventurer, whose involvement with an older literary lion (Kevin Kline) didn't diminish her appreciation for Will's boyish good looks; and there's April (Isla Fisher), the free spirit, who, although winsomely kooky enough to serve as a dream girl for Daily Show  boys, is nevertheless receptive to Will's white-bread-and-mayo appeal. No reason is adequately given why Will and his wife have chosen to split up and share custody, but I assume an inability to distinguish husband from hat rack is grounds for divorce.
And so Will advances the narrative, year by year, interrupted by Maya's perceptive present-day questions and commentary, delivered with the kind of therapeutic Wise Child tolerance we have come to expect from the star of Little Miss Sunshine . The thing is, each lady under discussion would not only make a reasonablemommy but also a really attractive, realistic woman. No one's a cartoon villain, and no one's beyond reproach, either. Everyone speaks like a grown-up (er, including Maya). But in a bounty of candidates, keep your eye on Banks. In a performance of invigorating complexity (and typically sunny equanimity), her Emily is a breakthrough non-neurotic beauty, perfectly built for an election year unimaginable back when Gennifer Flowers was acting out a much older female role.

 “Definitely, Maybe,” a nimble and winning little romance written and directed by Adam Brooks, begins with one of those awkward Important Talks that parents are sometimes required to have with their children. In this case Maya Hayes (Abigail Breslin) needs some debriefing after a sex education class at her Manhattan elementary school. She’s acquired some technical vocabulary but not a lot of context, and so it falls to her dad, Will (Ryan Reynolds), to do the necessary explaining.  This is a delicate task since in the grown-up world of love, theory and practice frequently part company, which is what Will and Maya’s mother have recently done. Like any parent Will wants to tell his daughter the truth without subjecting her to unnecessary disillusionment or cynicism. And Mr. Brooks faces a similar challenge, one that lesser romantic comedies tend to flee.  How do you preserve the fairy-tale elements of the genre — the beguiling fantasy of permanent bliss — in the face of certain prosaic and unavoidable facts? In the real world, after all, people divorce, sleep around, fall in love too soon, too late or too often.  It’s a mess, and a movie like this one has to acknowledge the mess without falling into it, in which case it would be a sad little melodrama rather than a sparkling comic enchantment. In spite of everything, viewers, like Maya, have to walk away with our faith in soul mates and happy endings confirmed, rather than compromised or shattered.  So Will decides to tell Maya a slightly edited, PG-13 version of the story of his life and loves before she was born. At first the ending seems predictable enough: after various false starts and digressions, he will finally meet and marry her mommy. But neither the girl nor the audience knows which of the women his younger self meets the mother will turn out to be. (And for a while we forget that, after their happy ending, Mom and Dad will end up divorced.)  The candidates are neatly — but not too neatly — sorted by hair color and temperament. Emily (Elizabeth Banks), the obliging, blond college sweetheart; Summer (Rachel Weisz), the intriguing, slightly dangerous dark-haired intellectual; and April (Isla Fisher), the impetuous redhead with whom Will trades insults at the New York campaign headquarters of Bill Clinton.  Ah, the ’90s. Among the many charms of “Definitely, Maybe” is the way it evokes the recent past without drowning in fussy period detail. Will, ambitious and idealistic, has come east from Madison, Wis. (leaving Emily behind), to plunge into the world of electoral politics; and while this movie is hardly an incisive political satire, it does capture some of the flavor of the times and, more generally, the headiness of youthful commitment to a cause.  Which is followed, perhaps inevitably, by disappointment. It is not hard to see that the Will of 1992 — smart, handsome, decent, happy in love, successful at work — is headed for a series of falls. Mr. Reynolds is dashing and sarcastic enough to fight off the lingering threat of blandness, and a subtle enough actor not to spoil his character’s unhappiness with self-pity. Will is, for all that, a bit of a cipher, or at least a sort of median Gen X-er, his edges smoothed away and his unruly appetites tamed.  Or maybe he’s just too modest and amiable to insist on being the most interesting person in his own story. Instead Mr. Reynolds is part of an attractive ensemble that includes Derek Luke, as Will’s best friend and sometime partner (they start a political consulting firm together after ’92), and Kevin Kline, as an aging gonzo journalist who is Will’s chief rival for Summer’s affection.  But it is the women in Will’s life — including Ms. Breslin — who make up the affectionate, unsentimental heart of the film. Ms. Fisher in particular enlivens every scene she’s in with a comic energy that’s antic and graceful.  “Darlin’ you can’t love three,” says an old folk song, and in movies of this kind the man who does is likely to be viewed as a cad. Either that, or the women he doesn’t end up with will be shown to have such egregious flaws that their rejection will come as a relief.  Emily, Summer and April are all decidedly imperfect, but Mr. Brooks succeeds in showing how their shortcomings are, especially at first, part of their allure. He also makes clear that Will, besotted with each in turn, does not know any of them as well as he thinks he does. He also is not quite sure what he wants. The treachery of love — and also its promise — is that people can surprise you.  And so can movies. I’ve been known to complain about the abysmal quality of contemporary American romantic comedies, which forsake intelligence, individuality and emotional risk for crude sex jokes or gauzy bridal-magazine fantasies. While “Definitely, Maybe” is hardly perfect, it navigates the choppy waters of modern courtship with commendable, understated honesty. Perhaps the best evidence of this is that this movie, unlike almost every other Hollywood tale of New York singles, was actually filmed in the city.  “Definitely, Maybe” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s fairly candid about what grown-ups do, though it doesn’t show them doing it.

A pleasingly non-formulaic romantic seriocomedy, "Definitely, Maybe" has charm and some depth, even if it's ultimately more a third-base hit than a home run. Tale of a divorcing father relating his complicated romantic history to an inquisitive daughter will click with viewers for its refreshing indifference to current romantic-comedy fashions, being neither Judd Apatow-esque raunchy nor indie-edgy. With enough word-of-mouth momentum, potential sleeper could be the breakout film for Ryan Reynolds, who seems on the verge of major stardom. That's a maybe, but writer-helmer Adam Brooks' ingratiating will definitely have an extended run in ancillary.
Framing device has Reynolds as Wiliam Hayes, an advertising exec on the verge of finalizing his divorce with the mother of Maya (Abigail Breslin), of whom they have joint custody. When Will picks Maya up from school, he's surprised that she's just gotten her first, rather premature sex-ed lesson, and is full of embarrassing questions as a result. In particular, she insists dad tell her exactly how many women he went out with before mom, and how they came to be married. He reluctantly agrees, but tells this bedtime story with the names changed, so she'll have to guess which character mom turns out to be.
Subsequent flashback occupies nearly all of the runtime, occasionally broken by Maya's inquiries and comments -- which, being of that precious movie-kid nature, will for some rep the weakest element here.
Will's romantic travails commence in Madison, Wis., where he's leaving perfect college sweetheart Emily (Elizabeth Banks) to spend two months in New York working on the 1992 Clinton campaign. She's not happy about it, but he has grand ambitions -- like becoming president one day himself -- and is confident they can weather the separation. His first experiences in the big city are disillusioning, but eventually his talents are appreciated, his responsibilities elevated -- and there are other sources of excitement, too, most notably friendships with two very attractive women.
There's April (Isla Fisher), a defiantly apolitical, somewhat rudderless free spirit who works at campaign HQ for cash rather than the cause. Also a playful provocateur, albeit far more professionally driven, is aspiring journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz), a one-time schoolmate of Emily's.
Will's amorous fortunes weave unpredictably around these three women, as his career also goes through ups and downs. Brooks' screenplay uses the political landscape of the (first?) Clinton era as a backdrop, getting some witty mileage out of its own ups and downs. But the primary focus is always on protag's lovelife, which seems eternally plagued by instances of right girl/wrong moment, awkward conflicts of interest and so forth. Little Maya is kept guessing who her mom will be to the end.
Pic might have done better to close on a tentative, hopeful note a la "Sideways," rather than going for the usual crowd-pleasing clinch that resolves everything too neatly. And some may find that Will's bouncing among his three loves wears out its welcome around the 90-minute mark.
For the most part, though, "Definitely, Maybe" succeeds at being credible, amusing, bittersweet and intelligent -- a "Manhattan"-esque exercise for twentysomethings that neither imitates Woody Allen (as so many do) nor goes the mumblecore route.
It helps that all leads are at their most appealing. Reynolds is in low-key form but still exerts deft comic timing; Weisz and Fisher sharply delineate characters that a more formulaic exercise might have simply turned into Quirky Girls 1 and 2. Banks is fine, though Emily winds up the least developed central figure. And Kevin Kline has a great time in a short but showy role as a famous political analyst; supporting cast is full of nice turns you'll wish had more screentime.
A bit bland at first, production package warms up to pay suitable homage to the Big Apple as a character. All tech and design contributions are smooth.

Definitely, Maybe  is a surprisingly rewarding romantic comedy. Imagine, really, old-school Woody Allen  starring that shit-eating smirker from Van Wilder , Ryan Reynolds ; if this isn't exactly Annie Hall   or Manhattan , the mere fact that it aspires to those heights is worth a celebration of some kindsay, a small street fair in Hoboken ?
The film's told almost entirely in flashbackduring that long-lost decade of the 1990s. When first we meet Reynolds in 2008, he's a corner- office ad exec being served his final divorce papers. Smartly capturing the ease with which we disconnect from the outside world, he slaps on his iPod  and struts through a silent Manhattan. He then picks up his daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin ), who turns out to be one of those 11-year-olds in movies who sound like their 51-year-old writer-directors (Adam Brooks , in this case) when discussing things like love, sex, and relationships.
Maya wants to know how it all went wrong between her parents, and as a begrudging bedtime tale, Will lays it out for her, changing the names of the women in his life story in order to keep his daughter (and the audience) guessing Mom's identity. (Sounds like a very special episode of How I Divorced Your Mother .) As Will recounts his life in New York in the early to mid-'90s, he encounters several women with whom he will fall in and out of loveone of whom will become his wife and Maya's mother. Only, at the end of Will's story, the parents will be divorced, and Maya will be left with what she calls "a romantic mystery" absent its fairy-tale finale.
But before the unhappy present day, first to the promising yesterdays: It's 1992, and Will's a collegiate Young Democrat in Wisconsin dating the old-fashioned Emily (40-Year-Old Virgin 's do-it-herselfer Elizabeth Banks ). Emily refuses to move to New York, where Will's been hired to work on Bill Clinton 's 1992 campaign. There, he meets Isla Fisher 's April, the freewheeling Xerox  girl with the Smiths T-shirt, and an old friend of Emily's named Summer (Rachel Weisz ), a would-be writer shacked up with a chain-smoking, Scotch-drinking, pop-culture-loathing author-professor brilliantly named Hampton Roth , played by Kevin Kline .
Over the course of the next couple of hours, Will and these bright, beautiful women keep crossing pathsas lovers, as disappointments, as what-coulda-beens, as what-might-bes. Brooks, whose French Kiss  screenplay was as tony and old-fashioned a romance as Hollywood 's made in 20 years, ultimately grounds the movie in the everyday. As sweet and silly as the film can get, ultimately it just shrugs and says, "Do your best, expect the worst, you'll muddle through."
Of course, one could easily look at the movie as a well-timed portrait of one man's shattered affection for Bill Clintonit encompasses his entire presidency, from the early Man From Hope to Monica Lewinsky . Reynolds, muting his smart-ass qualities without dulling his timing, bemoans Clinton's parsing of words: "What happens when they give him a hard  word?" he snaps at the TV as Clinton ponders the meaning of "is." Truth is, it's an unexpected delight to find Reynolds in something resembling a grown-up comedy; he forever seemed destined to be the dude from Two Girls, a Guy and a Pizza Place . Maybe he's no longer a could-have-been, but rather a might-be-after-all.
