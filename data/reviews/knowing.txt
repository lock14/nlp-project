It's a Nicolas Cage movie, so, admit it, you're expecting crazy. You have no idea. The star's latest, "Knowing," starts off mildly ridiculous, ascends to the full-blown ludicrous, and finally sails boldly off the edge of the absolutely preposterous. Throughout it all, Cage's grim sense of purpose stays in place, as does his hairpiece. You have to admire such dedication amid apocalypse, even as you're hooting through your fingers in disbelief.
Based on the trailers, "Knowing" at first glance appears to be an amalgam of Cage's last few movies, mixing the numerology games of the family-friendly "National Treasure" series with the future-tense prophecies of last year's dud thriller "Next." Trust me, though: Where this movie goes, you do not want to take a child along.
Cage plays a Boston-area astrophysicist and single dad named John Koestler  - works at MIT, lives in Lexington  - whose young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) retrieves an odd document from an unearthed time capsule at his elementary school. The sheet is nothing but a series of numbers, but John sees meaning in the randomness, deducing that the 50-year-old piece of paper has correctly predicted every major disaster between then and now, down to the dates, number of victims, and geographical coordinates. Three more disasters are yet to come. The last one looks like a biggie.
This knowledge allows Cage to dash around the Eastern seaboard, desperately trying to confirm his fears and convince others. An MIT colleague (Phil Beckman) and a young mother (Rose Byrne)  - the daughter of the girl who wrote the sheet a half-century ago  - are initially skeptical, but too many weird things are going on. Who are those creepy figures standing outside John's house at night, and what are they telepathically whispering to his son?
The director is Alex Proyas, who made a name for himself with the visual stylistics of "The Crow," "Dark City," and "I, Robot." The man's not a hack. "Knowing" takes itself so seriously that it's hard not to get the giggles, but then Proyas comes through with a breathtaking single-take sequence in which John watches a commercial airliner plummet to earth yards away and runs into the flaming wreckage searching for survivors. The same goes for a terrifying NYC subway crash, which the director choreographs as a catastrophic you-are-there experience.
Unfortunately, the film's human interactions are pitched at the same constant white-knuckle level  - Cage has never seemed so stiffly absent  - and Proyas keeps everyone jumping over plot holes. At times "Knowing" feels like the highlight reel for a longer but much less silly movie.
The story line keeps getting wider and wider in its implications, and at a certain point you realize it's fearlessly going all the way into  - well, the Book of Revelation would make a handy study guide. "Knowing" works itself up into a thundering sci-fi/Christian metaphor in which both sides have equal weight, and it will be taken as oh-wow gospel by impressionable young audiences and those who believe (as this movie does) that we're all sinners except the kids. That audience may be quite happy to see Manhattan at last get what they think it deserves.
Proyas is a real filmmaker, though, and "Knowing" rockets along with urgency, if not realism or even common sense. At its lunatic best, the film's a version of "The Happening" in which something actually happens. At its worst, it's a bad-movie rapture.

Knowing  is a portentous numerological global-warming-to-the-nth-power thriller, in which Nicolas Cage plays an MIT professor who figures out that The End is near. If you want to know how inept the movie is...well, it's so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise. At least Shyamalan, in his dud The Happening , is a compulsive audience-gooser, whereas Alex Proyas (The Crow ), the director of Knowing , has no idea what to do between calamitous set pieces. There's one terrifying moment (it's featured in the television promos), where a jetliner comes hurtling out of a stormy sky with a nightmare suddenness that is up close and vivid. But Cage, gaunt and haunted (or    maybe just vacant), spends far too much time doing his antsy-perturbed thing as he tries to decipher a sheet of numerals dug up from a time capsule  a code that foretells every global disaster of the past 50 years, as well as a few that have yet to happen.
As he ponders and marinates, we have time to consider questions like: Why, in the midst of this vaguely millennial muddle, does Cage's prof live in a mansion that's lit like the setting for a Disney ghost story? And what are those nicely attired blond alien attachés, who could be refugees from a Depeche Mode video, up to? You may also wonder what Cage, at this point in his career, does to psych himself up for a scene in which he's driving and screaming lines like, ''We have to go where the numbers want us to go!'' Knowing  is a trash-compactor hodgepodge of Deep Impact , The Number 23 , Close Encounters , and The Day the Earth Stood Still . Too often, though, it's the movie that stands still, as it counts down to one of those ''mind-blowing'' digital cataclysms that dissipates the moment you walk up the aisle.

 Nobody requires plausibility from a movie like “Knowing,” which features slender blond aliens, intimations of apocalypse, clairvoyant children and Nicolas Cage as an astrophysicist. If the thing manages to avoid complete preposterousness, the audience can still have a good time.  Or maybe even if it doesn’t: the folks at a recent sneak preview of “Knowing,” directed by Alex Proyas (“Dark City,” “I, Robot”), seemed to be enjoying themselves, though it may have been at the movie’s expense. (Just as well, since they were seeing it free.) If your intention is to make a brooding, hauntingly allegorical terror-thriller, it’s probably not a good sign when spectacles of mass death and intimations of planetary destruction are met with hoots and giggles.  It’s safe to say that the crowd was laughing at Mr. Cage, rather than with him, since Mr. Cage rarely expresses mirth on screen. Instead, he favors a demented, compulsive intensity, which can sometimes be kind of fun, for example in the “National Treasure” movies. In “Knowing,” though, he seems to be exploring the rich vein of crazy he tapped in Neil LaBute’s train-wreck remake of “The Wicker Man.” Mr. Cage screams and yells and flails, smacks a tree with a baseball bat, waves a gun at a slender blond alien and barks “this is not a crank call” into a pay phone after calling in a breathless warning of a terrorist attack.  And why not? What would you do if you were an M.I.T. astrophysicist who discovered that the numbers written down 50 years earlier by a spooky schoolgirl and sealed in a time capsule were prophecies of subsequent catastrophes? You might also hit a tree with a Louisville Slugger and start ranting like a madman. But the odd thing about Mr. Cage in this movie is that even when he is responding to the threat of complete human extinction, you still can’t help feeling that he’s overreacting.  His character, John Koestler, is, like most movie dads these days, a widower, stricken with grief and trying to raise a cute, precocious young son (Chandler Canterbury). Once John starts running the numbers from the spooky girl’s spreadsheet, the tone of the movie switches from foreboding creepiness to apocalyptic hysteria, summed up less in the occasional explosion or transportation-related fireball than in Rose Byrne’s incessant shrieking. She plays Diana, daughter of the spooky schoolgirl (and mother of another one; both are played by Lara Robinson), and evolves from mysterious stranger to potential love interest to raving hysteric in record time.  Though not quickly enough. The draggy, lurching two hours of “Knowing” will make you long for the end of the world, even as you worry that there will not be time for all your questions to be answered. Who are those slender blond folk, called “the Whisper People” by John’s son and Diana’s daughter? Are they goth vampires who showed up early to audition for the “Twilight” sequel? Former members of Kraftwerk? Did they steal all those smooth black pebbles from a day spa after a hot stone massage? Is that why they seem so relaxed?  Actually, you will figure out who they are long before the astrophysicist does and stop caring long before that.  “Knowing” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some mild swearing and lots of death.

Although made mostly of spare parts, "Knowing" is a not-bad supernatural-tinged sci-fier that has more on its mind than the run-of-the-mill effects-driven extravaganza. Absorbing and able to be taken seriously most of the way, Alex Proyas' generally somber look at a small group of people tipped off about the imminence of doomsday doesn't smoothly synthesize all its elements, and the effects could have used a budget stimulus. Genre fans always looking for something new and awesome may feel like they've seen most of this before, but the conceptual and emotional strength of Summit's Nicolas Cage starrer largely carries the day, which should spell sturdy B.O. in all markets.
The 1959-set prologue of Ryne Douglas Pearson's original story gets its hooks in by virtue of that reliable standby, a disturbingly creepy kid. Asked by their elementary school teacher to draw pictures of how they see the future to include in a time capsule, all the pupils in the Boston-area school oblige except for Lucinda (Lara Robinson), a haunted-looking child who instead covers her sheets of paper with thousands of numbers.
Come time to open the capsule 50 years later, Lucinda's inscrutable jottings land in the hands of Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury), a precocious boy depressed over the recent death of his mother. Dad John (Cage), an astrophysics professor at MIT, is in the dumps himself and struggling to forge a stronger bond with his son while living at a run-down old Victorian house out in the woods.
At night, a tired and somewhat drunk John puzzles over Lucinda's numbers and shortly concludes that many of them, beginning with 9/11/01, refer to calamitous incidents that involved massive loss of life; he soon thereafter learns the remaining numbers provide even more specific information. But three sets of numbers at the end of the long list lie in the future -- the very, very near future.
Naturally, John has as much trouble convincing anyone else about his deductions as Costello ever did insisting to Abbott that Dracula and Frankenstein were alive and well. But a plane crash virtually in his backyard confirms the first remaining prediction, and what he at length learns from Diana (Rose Byrne), the troubled daughter of Lucinda -- who herself has a daughter (Robinson again) who's Caleb's age -- deepens and makes even more apparent the ominous nature of the numeric scribblings.
That there is something truly unearthly at play is suggested by Caleb's occasional sightings of the Stranger (D.G. Maloney), a silent and sinister albino-ish figure, sometimes seen in the company of others, who stalks the boy.
Such events naturally trigger questions of what to make of it all and, ever more urgently, what to do about it. When John figures out the exact time and place of the second forecasted catastrophe, he's forced to a wrenching decision, but has sufficient knowledge -- more than anyone else on Earth, in fact -- to know what to do. Unfortunately, the climax consists of a special-effects fireworks display that, because similar images have been conjured before with greater resources, can't help but look secondhand.
Although he may not fit the received image of an MIT prof, Cage, slimmed down to the edge of gauntness, generally suppresses his more wildly emotive tendencies to deliver an acceptably thoughtful performance. Byrne has the gravity to pull off Diana's perpetual state of distress without annoyance, and Canterbury and Robinson are rock-solid as the two crucial kids. Rather than just sharing his suspicions with one of his colleagues, a worthwhile additional scene to the script (by Pearson, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White) might have had John calling a meeting with several MIT brainiacs, just to get multiple, and eccentric, reactions to his reading of the numbers.
Lensed almost entirely in Melbourne, Australia, with a bit of second-unit work on the East Coast to rep Boston and New York, the pic was shot by d.p. Simon Duggan with the Red One digital camera system, and has an agreeably soft, desaturated, autumnal look. The old-dark-house central setting and threatening surrounding forest come with certain B-feature connotations that are never entirely shaken, but Marco Beltrami's vigorous score, buttressed at key moments by Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, is strictly A-level.
