Young Thomas Turgoose, the spunky non-pro 13-year-old cast as a lonely kid drawn to an early-'80s skinhead gang in this autobiographical period piece by Shane Meadows (TwentyFourSeven ), has a sweet old-fashioned face. But in the right light, his weary eyes resemble those of a mean adult. The changeability serves this sad, menacing, empathetic story well, even if the story is misty in its didacticism: No matter how tough the times, just say no to racism and hatred.


 A soulful blast from the past sparked by heart and a throbbing beat, “This Is England” returns us to 1983, when Ronnie and Maggie ruled their roosts with Teflon finesse and an iron grip. The place is a quiet town where rude graffiti litter the walls and teenage skinheads loiter, dressed in jeans, Ben Sherman shirts and Doc Martens boots, looking for something, anything, to do. The Falklands War has just ended, but another battle simmers on the home front, fueled by unemployment, rage, nationalism and the old ennui.  A modest, near-flawless gem, “This Is England” is the fifth feature by the young British director Shane Meadows, doing his best work since he first hit the festival scene in the mid-1990s with his hilarious, raw-hewn shorts “Small Time” and “Where’s the Money, Ronnie?” Like most of his films the new one takes place in the East Midlands, in England’s midsection, where Nottingham and Derby are, and where Mr. Meadows was born and, in early adolescence, became a skinhead. By turns gentle and brutal, “This Is England” is a humbly, if insistently political, autobiographical homage to that lost world of youth as well as a lament for its hopes, pleasures and passionate camaraderie.  As if returning to basics Mr. Meadows has, for this film, smartly departed from his reliance on familiar faces, some of whom have at times weighed heavily on his past work (Bob Hoskins in “Twentyfourseven,” Paddy Considine in “Dead Man’s Shoes”). The wonderful newcomer Thomas Turgoose gets most of the attention here, as 12-year-old Shaun, a spark plug with a lopsided stare, who lives with his mother and keeps his own counsel. Quick to anger, fast with his fists, Shaun plows through town like a tugboat, cutting a poignant, lonely swath through strangers and schoolmates alike until he’s affably taken off course by Woody (Joe Gilgun), a garrulous skinhead with pipe-cleaner legs and a small cross tattooed in the middle of his forehead.  In both its politicized long view and in its more important close-up story, “This Is England” is about the joy that can come with finding your tribe, of discovering and being accepted by those with whom you can find and be yourself. When Woody brings Shaun into his band of skinhead brothers, the boy lifts like a balloon. He giggles and smiles, and the hole that had recently torn through him, caused by the death of his father, starts to mend. Not long after Shaun laces up his boots and says goodbye to his long hair, Mr. Meadows shows him strolling about with his new friends in slow motion, their similar yet different forms shifting and moving harmoniously, flowing like tributaries toward a single destination.  There’s a boisterous honesty as well as a real edge to the friendship among the skinheads, who sometimes combust in giddy anarchy, as when they run riot with hammers through some abandoned apartments. Mostly out of work and at loose ends, they sit around idling and revving. As the pitch- and tone-perfect soundtrack pulses with Toots and the Maytals, the Specials and Ian Dury, they drink and smoke to excess, crowding into already cramped homes and bleak cafes, tossing insults at one another as both time and their youth seem to stand still. They have made their own world, but one with its own perils, notably Combo (Stephen Graham, brilliant and scarily real), who mucks up this idyll with spit and racist invective.  Mr. Meadows’s sentimentalism has sometimes gotten the better of his work, with tears and needlessly punishing violence, but not here. Shaun may embody pitifully hard times and bad breaks, but Mr. Meadows refuses to let him off the hook. In the film’s brilliant opening sequence — with its images of the Falklands War abroad set against anti-Pakistani violence at home — Mr. Meadows sketches out his interests and ethics with clarity and precision. Throughout the drama and heavy-hearted tragedy that follow he continues to bridge the personal with the political and revel in brotherhood while also warning of its dangers. He reclaims the best of these skinheads and their often-despised subculture, celebrating the finest in young men and women who were once united not under the Union Jack but under a groove.

Few writer-helmers have stuck more religiously with the advice to film what they know -- using the people they know -- than self-taught Brit filmmaker Shane Meadows. Like his five previous pics (including the recent "Dead Man's Shoes"), Meadows' "This Is England" employs a regular ensemble of cast and crew to investigate working-class culture and masculinity using both humor and violence. However, with its knockout lead perfs and taut if slightly familiar construction, this '80s-set dramedy about a skinhead gang reps Meadows' most fluently made film so far. Still, "England" will need strong critical support to get more than limited exposure beyond Blighty. 
Publicity material reveals story is largely autobiographical. Like central character Shaun (non-pro Thomas Turgoose), Meadows himself joined a skinhead gang as a young teen in the early '80s, at a time when the youth movement was experiencing a resurgence before it became a byword for racist thuggery.
Pic accurately shows that there were many Afro-Caribbean skinheads back then whose influence made affection for vintage ska (a kind of reggae music) one of the defining factors of skinhead culture.
Set quite specifically in July 1983, just a little over a year after the end of the Falklands War, pic sticks closely to the point of view of 11- or 12-year-old Shaun, who lives in an unnamed, rundown seaside town somewhere between town of Grimsby in Yorkshire County and the suburbs of Nottingham (both rep locations used). His soldier father was killed in the Falklands and Shaun now lives with his well-meaning mum Cynth (Jo Hartley).
One day, Shaun, who looks much younger than his years, stands up for himself when a gang of teenage skinheads tease him, thereby winning their respect, especially that of leader Woody (Joe Gilgun). Other members of the gang include Woody's g.f. Lol (Vicky McClure), who gives Shaun his first skinhead haircut once he's accepted as a member, and black teen Milky (Andrew Shim, who played the title character in Meadows' "A Room for Romeo Brass").
Midsection gently unspools several charming, nicely played scenes and montages of the mixed gang of girls and boys just hanging out together or getting into mischief. In one segment that perfectly captures the unembarrassed directness of youth, Shaun enjoys his first French kiss with Smell (Rosamund Hanson) who makes herself up to look like popstar Boy George.
However, when much older skin Combo (Stephen Graham, who was in "Gangs of New York" and gives a dazzling perf here) arrives on the scene fresh from prison, the gang fractures into two groups, with Woody leading one and the racist Combo, a supporter of the neo-fascist org the National Front, in charge of the other.
Won over by Combo's powers of persuasion, Shaun joins his faction, finding in him a surrogate father figure (as did lead characters in Meadows' earlier efforts, "Romeo Brass" and "24/7").
Plot moves on fixed rail lines toward a too-predictable conclusion. But Meadows draws such fresh and engaging perfs from his cast, as usual a mix of pro- and non-pros who collaborated on the script via a long rehearsal and workshop process, that it's easy to overlook plot's schematic design.
Utterly natural onscreen, his puggish face a map of flickering emotions, young Turgoose proves a real find and blossoms under Meadows' direction. Once again, helmer demonstrates an extraordinary ability to coax great work from younger, inexperienced thesps.
Pic reps Meadows' first period film, and production and costume design offers a spot on rendition of the era in general and the specific skinhead look back then, right down to the girls' miniskirts, Cynth's poodle perm, and the men's Ben Sherman button-down shirts and Doc Martens boots.
Presumably, a big chunk of pic's low-budget would have been spent on buying in its cracking soundtrack of vintage ska and early '80s pop tunes. Opening montage, for instance, of archive footage summarizing the period (images of Margaret Thatcher, the Falklands war, rioting miners and so on) is cut on a dime to Toots and the Maytals' classic ska track "54 46 Was My Number," kicking pic off to a fine start.
Lensing on 16mm by Danny Cohen, a regular Meadows' collaborator, adds a smoky, hazy vibe and recalls pics of the period, particularly the films of Alan Clarke like "Made in Britain." Sound recording by Dave Sansom is crisp, although offshore and even non-Northern British viewers may have trouble understanding characters' broad Midland and Yorkshire accents.

Scene by scene, This Is England gets the job done. Drawing on memories of a specific place and timeEngland in the early '80swriter-director Shane Meadows  sketches with a keen eye for detail and the contours of experience. He nails the look and feel of a shabby provincial town and, more impressively, how it feels to live there, from the humble squat of a graffiti-strewn corner shop to the unassuming dignity of its Pakistani keeper. He's adept at dead air, hanging out, killing time, alert to restless youth and the tribes they form.
His forte is style: shaved heads and ska records, tight jeans and skinny suspenders, Fred Perry  polos and oxblood Docs. Meadows re-creates skinhead subculture with equal care for its accoutrements and origins as a youth movement based on working-class solidaritynot race hatredthe multicultural fusion of the London Mod and Jamaican Rude Boy.
And he remembers the spasm of post-colonial idiocy known as the Falklands War, a territorial skirmish between Britain and Argentina that stoked nationalist fervor and secured victory for Margaret Thatcher 's Conservative party in the 1983 general election. Less than 300 British lives were lost in the conflict, but a whole world is taken from a boy named Shaun (Thomas Turgoose ), left fatherless by an incomprehensible war. He clings to what little remains, a handful of photos and some hand-me-down trousers, bell-bottoms gone ratty at the ankles and way out of style. He rocks them regardless and is mercilessly teased.
Turgoose brings personality and pathos to the role, swiftly and vividly characterizing Shaun as a kind of callow seedling, fragile and adrift but full of untapped potential. Meadows states this eloquently in a quiet moment with Mom (Jo Hartley ) then rams it home by cutting toa dandelion. Bloody hell. If Shaun feels proud, will the movie cue a lion? England  recovers from this rhetorical gaff, hardly worth a mention if it didn't signal a larger problem. Scene to scene, things fall apart, creaky from the micro (montage) to the macro (control of theme and dramatic arc). Compelling at the episodic level, the movie botches the big picture. This isolated excellence and larger lack of nerveall dots, no connectiongrows ever more frustrating as England  turns from the personal to the political, from character study to social studies.
Our pudgy little Shaun of the dead comes to life on contact with Woody (Joe Gilgun ), the charismatic leader of a local skinhead crew. They're good-natured kids, in a rough-and-tumble way, venting frustration on abandoned buildings instead of immigrant skulls. Invited, somewhat implausibly, to tag along, Shaun is liberated of more than his hair, as recognized by Mom in a wonderful scene, touching and droll, that finds her cornering the skins at their local café. Unleashing maternal fury over the unauthorized coiffure (and weirdly resembling some buttoned-up British doppelgänger of electro- 'ho Peaches), she otherwise gives her blessing to "the clothes and all that other stuff."
Mom gets how skinhead solidarity is a stabilizing influence on her son. What she can't foresee is the nasty alterative gathering force to replace it. Enter Combo (Stephen Graham ), an old mate of Woody's and skinhead of a different stripethe kind that twists into a swastika. Combo strikes a pose of belligerent, bigoted nationalism to mask his own insecurities, but his alpha-male diatribes score a direct hit on the feeble leadership structure of Woody's group, exposing fissures and shattering allegiances. And it does a serious number on Shaun, still reeling from the aftermath of a political situation he vaguely attributes to foreign trouble. If Shaun found a father in Woody, Combo presents something better: a führer.
This Is England  goes on to examine the psychology of fascism from two angles, at two stages of its development. The story of Shaun is a cautionary tale about the susceptibility of needy young men to the rigors of far-right ideology. Combo is a case study in the inevitable result: social and psychic violence. Meadows undermines this theme by reducing it all to daddy issues. Facile pop psychology is the real tragedy here, a double disappointment given the film's smart take on pop culture. By ritualizing the values and vitality of pop culture, subcultures like the skinheads offer their own form of social organization. The success and failure of that process might have been the subject of This Is England , all rich raw materials slipping through fingers.
