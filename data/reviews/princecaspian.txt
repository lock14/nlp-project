'Narnia' fantasy charges into battle mode with 'Prince Caspian'
In the closing minutes of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," there comes a misjudgment of filmmaking and cross-marketing so colossal that it very nearly wrecks the movie. It certainly spoils the spell of fierce, ahistorical faerie struggle that has been painstakingly built up in the previous 2 1/2 hours.
It is a pop song. A goopy ballad called "The Call," to be precise, by the singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, who really should have known better. (Not when Disney
 comes waving a checkbook, I suppose.) In an eye-blink, the audience is jarred snickering out of Narnia and back into the modern world, much as the Pevensie kids find themselves whisked back to a World War II tube station but with far less art or reason.
It's especially a shame because the movie has been rolling along nicely until then. A muscular fantasy epic that marks a filmmaking improvement if not a leap in dramatic inspiration over 2005's "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe," "Prince Caspian" reveals this series as conceived ever more clearly as a junior-league "Lord of the Rings." New Zealand again provides the vast, primal landscapes; the endless rendering farms of Peter Jackson's Weta Digital (among several other special-effects companies) provide the computerized window-dressing. There are clashing battles and surly dwarves and movable trees. If there aren't any hobbits, it's probably because they couldn't get the work visas.
In the process, this "Prince Caspian" strips the air of engaged Oxford gentility from the novel penned by C.S. Lewis and replaces it with state-of-the-art multiplex action. If you love the Narnia books - their quiet but persuasive narrative flow, the spiritual ideals churning gently beneath - you may want to steer clear of this movie, which is solid but very noisy, and only occasionally truly magical.
With the book's prose removed, too, "Prince Caspian" is more obviously a war movie for young audiences, which made sense when Lewis was writing in the wake of World War II and makes an unfortunate kind of sense today. Specifically, it's about how to deal with conflict in the absence of God.
Oops, I meant Aslan. The great lion (voiced once again by Liam Neeson) is gone for most of this second film, and without that beacon the Narnians struggling against the Telmarines - suspiciously ethnic human invaders with e-e-evil accents led by King Miraz (Italian actor Sergio Castellitto) - are forced to make their own decisions. These tend to be based on vanity rather than faith, and you know what the Lord thinks about that. Sorry, Aslan; promise I won't do it again.
"Prince Caspian" gets started with a bang, with the birth of Miraz's son and the fleeing into the wilderness of the rightful Telmarine king, young Caspian X. He's played by the British actor Ben Barnes in a patent bid to get teenage girls to throw over their Orlando Bloom fansites, and he's effectively noble and handsome.
Blowing the magic horn passed to him by his half-Narnian tutor (Vincent Grass in minor Dumbledore mode), Caspian summons the four Pevensies from late-'40s England: stalwart Peter (William Moseley), doughty (and rather dull) Susan (Anna Popplewell), clever Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and faithful Lucy (Georgie Henley).
To their surprise, hundreds of Narnian years have passed to their one, and the film effectively conveys the awful grandeur of their ruined palace. It also conveys the shock of the Narnians that their legendary kings and queens are a quartet of children. The fine actor Peter Dinklage ("The Station Agent"), playing the dwarf Trumpkin, takes over point position from the first movie's James McAvoy, and his immensely sad-eyed surliness is one of the most comic yet poignant aspects of "Prince Caspian." (He does resemble Ringo Starr as a small homeless man, though.)
There's a talking badger, voiced by Ken Stott and not as convincing as the beavers in "Lion," and a large, charming, sword-wielding mouse named Reepicheep (Eddie Izzard), reminiscent of Puss in Boots from the "Shrek" movies but much tougher. There are centaurs and giants and fauns, oh my. Tilda Swinton returns for one scene as the White Witch and momentarily freezes the movie's blood in its veins. One of the more eerily beautiful sequences in "Caspian" involves a nighttime assault on Miraz's castle by the heroes, born aloft by gryphons and swooping silently and lethally down upon the battlements.
This turns out to be a bad idea in the long run, and the moral of "Prince Caspian" is that decisions made without consulting one's heart (or faith, or, um, inner lion) are usually foolhardy. Of the four children, only Lucy sticks to the true path, and by movie's end she's practically a nun for Aslan. Henley, who has matured from the sprite of the first film, makes this quiet devotion work, which can't be said for the mild romance the filmmakers try to cook up between Caspian and Susan. The characters of Susan and Peter will be largely gone from the next installment, "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" (due in 2010), and I can't say I'll miss them. When Moseley's gauche Peter takes on Castellitto's Miraz in a climactic swordfight, the battle's too lopsided to be credible.
Take away the storming music and grand vistas, and it's all a standard sword-and-sorcery adventure; director Andrew Adamson is more than a journeyman but much less than the visionary Peter Jackson is. In his hands, though, the "Narnia" movies have dealt with Lewis's underlying Christian themes as well as can be expected, neither stressing them nor pretending they don't exist.
In the process, the message becomes clear for those who care to scratch the summer-movie surface: You can't win without faith, either in a metaphorical lion or the deity he stands in for (who is most assuredly not the god of swarthy Telmarines). "Prince Caspian" may be effective entertainment, but Walden Media, the production company backed by Christian billionaire Philip Anschutz, has given American family audiences something they really don't need at the moment: A primer on the benefits of holy war.


In The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian , one of the rare sequences of untrammeled wit and fun and light arrives when the valiant, shining-eyed Caspian (Ben Barnes), having assembled a motley army out of the scruffy woodland creatures of Narnia, infiltrates the castle of King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), the evil uncle who has usurped his throne. (We know what a bad guy Miraz is from one look at his ugly, pointed beard. No facial hair should be this  sculpted.) The forces of Narnia  spitfire dwarfs, towering centaurs, and other misfits  are the underdogs, but when it comes to sneaking past the royal walls, they have advantages.
The castle itself is impossibly tall  it looks like a collection of mighty elongated chess rooks  and so it helps to have a few griffins soar over the edifice to deposit key fighters. There is also a swashbuckling mouse (blithely voiced by Eddie Izzard  ), who could almost be a prankish cousin to Puss in Boots from the Shrek  films. (Andrew Adamson, director of Prince Caspian , codirected the first two Shrek s.) He wriggles up a pole and leaves a castle kitty cat bound in knots. And then there's the hulking humanoid ram: just the thing to give an enemy soldier a start.
As amusing as this can be, the attempt by Caspian to win back his lost kingdom is really about all there is to the film  which is to say, this is a movie that showcases battle. Lots and lots of battle. As the soldiers pick up their broadswords and begin to slash and plunge,  Prince Caspian  seizes, and holds, your attention, yet it begins to look like any other mystically righteous clang-of-metal war movie. Creatures or no creatures, we’ve seen it before.
Like the C.S. Lewis novel it's based on, Prince Caspian  follows a tradition of darkening sequels. In pop-fantasy cinema, the trend was more or less set in motion by The Empire Strikes Back , which ripened the underlying foreboding of Star Wars , and it was then followed by the playfully (some would say perversely) demonic Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . It took the Harry Potter films an extra installment or two, but that series got gravitas as well  all to the benefit of its hellzapoppin Victorian toy-shop aesthetic. Prince Caspian , taking on a similar spirit, is a fierce and somber battle epic. It features soldiers in pewter armor lined up in rows like a sinister  marching band against the Narnians, who stand there with their bows and arrows, trembling bravely at the odds against them. Yet make no mistake: This is also a Disney film, and so there's nothing too  twisted, ignoble, or bloody about it. The real reason Prince Caspian  is  darker than 2005's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  is that it leans so much more heavily on medieval hardware than mysticism. What's changed is the ratio of combat to enchantment.
From the start, you feel a comedown in magic. Instead of the wardrobe they employed before, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley) and his fresh-faced siblings now journey to Narnia through a London subway tunnel, landing on a sunny beach with rock formations that look a lot less wondrous than they're supposed to. Peter, along with Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Susan (Anna Popplewell), has been away for a year, but in Narnia time, 1,300 years have passed, and so has the glorious revolution over which they presided. The creatures of Narnia are now exiled to the woods, and as Miraz, leader of the brutish Telmarines, plots his nasty takeover, Caspian and the Pevensie kids gather the disparate Narnians into that hopeful and collective thing...a fellowship! After the Lord of the Rings  trilogy, I realize I'm in the minority in finding the gathering of a fellowship to be a rather blah excuse for the plot of an adventure film. In this case, the doubling up of noble young heroes doesn't help. As Caspian, newcomer Ben Barnes has pouty lips, an anonymous European accent, and long hair that glows like something out of a teen-shampoo commercial. He comes off like the second coming of Orlando Bloom.
In total effect, Prince Caspian  feels a lot more earthbound than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe . At least, that's true until a surprise figure shows up, his giant sculpted liquid face rising out of the waves of an aqua green river. Will viewers agree on what this face is? Or will they debate it the way that certain devout legions do when it is spotted, mysteriously, in the shadowed folds of a potato chip? B–

 Here in the unenchanted world of ordinary moviegoing, it has been about two and a half years  since “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” the first installment in Walt Disney and Walden Media’s mighty “Chronicles of Narnia” franchise. In wartime England, where the Pevensie children live when they’re not consorting with talking lions and battling witches, a year or so has gone by. But in Narnia itself, to which the four plucky Pevensies return in “Prince Caspian,” the second movie in the series, centuries have passed, and everything has changed. The grand hall where Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy were made monarchs of the realm has fallen into ruin, and the friendly woodland creatures with their homey British accents and computer-animated fur seem to have vanished from the scene.  When the exiled child kings and queens are thrown back into Narnia (thanks to a sudden outbreak of special effects in a London tube station), they seem no longer to be in a children’s fantasy story but rather in some kind of Jacobean tragedy, a reminder that C. S. Lewis was, along with everything else, a scholar of English Renaissance literature. In a dark castle in a dark forest, men with heavy armor and beard-shadowed faces quarrel and conspire. Instead of fauns and Turkish delight, there are murder and betrayal, and a grave, martial atmosphere lingers over the story,  even when the spunky dwarfs and chatty rodents return. (Aslan the lion also shows up eventually, speaking in the soothing voice of Liam Neeson.)  So “Prince Caspian” is quite a bit darker than “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” both in look and in mood. It is also in some ways more satisfying. Its violent (though gore-free) combat scenes and high body count may rattle very young viewers, but older children are likely to be drawn into the thick political intrigue. The relative scarcity of digital effects in the first part of the movie allows the director, Andrew Adamson, and  the director of photography, Karl Walter Lindenlaub, to explore the beauty of the Narnian landscape by more traditional cinematic means. Its lush glades and rocky escarpments provide a reminder that the supernaturalism of fairy tales originates in the magic of the natural world.  And tales of heroic adventure, however fanciful, are grounded in human problems of power, cruelty and conflict. “Prince Caspian” is named for its square-jawed, rather bland hero (played by Ben Barnes), but its major source of dramatic energy is the villain, Caspian’s uncle Miraz, who is played with malignant grandeur by the great Italian actor Sergio Castellitto. Miraz is a classic royal usurper, who has taken the throne from Caspian’s father, the rightful king, and who plans to pass it along to his own newborn son once Caspian is out of the way. His court is a viper’s nest of double-dealing and shifting allegiance.  Cue grumpy dwarfs, swashbuckling mice and apple-cheeked Pevensies. And hail the popular struggle of the Narnian underground! Since the  Telmarines took over and suppressed the old magic, a hardy remnant of Narnians has been hiding amid the pacified trees, sustaining themselves with the legends of King Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Queen Lucy (Georgie Henley), Queen Susan (Anna Popplewell) and High King Peter (William Moseley). When these rulers return, they rescue Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), a small, angry Narnian taken prisoner by Miraz’s soldiers, and eventually join Prince Caspian, who exchanges some long, half-smoldering looks with Susan.  In spite of this hint of romance, what ensues is basically a war movie, with elaborate battle sequences in a castle courtyard and on a grassy plain, accompanied by thundering hoofbeats, whizzing arrows, clanking swords and Harry Gregson-Williams’s rousing score. These sections are ostensibly what the public wants to see, and certainly what the producers pay heavily to bring to life. There is a risk of sameness and tedium, which Mr. Adamson does not entirely overcome, though he and his fellow screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, sprinkle in enough witty dialogue to keep the movie’s long middle from feeling like too much of a slog.  The main characters, whose sometimes fractious sibling dynamic provided the first “Narnia” movie with a hint of psychological complexity, seem a little flatter here, as if they’ve grown accustomed to their jobs as action heroes. And “Prince Caspian” isn’t really about them, anyway, except insofar as the kids in the audience identify with their courage and good sense.  The cloak of allegory in which Lewis swathed the Narnia books is worn lightly on the screen, and some of their charm and novelty has been  chipped away —  not so much by any lapse on the part of the filmmakers as by a sense of familiarity. Tales of good and evil set in enchanted lands populated by mythical beasts are ubiquitous these days,  which may diminish the power of each new spell. The Pevensie children  can withdraw to London between episodes, but moviegoers are unlikely, and also perhaps unwilling, to escape from Narnia and the other increasingly numerous, and therefore increasingly mundane, places like it.  “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). This rating may be a little misleading, since some of the violence is fairly intense, and some of the deaths may unsettle younger children.

Unquestionably the first film sequel with the distinction of taking place 1,300 years after the initial series installment, �The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian� features more clanging swords than all the Robin Hood and Ivanhoe movies put together. Closer to a straight-ahead medieval battle picture than the fantastical, other-worldly journey depicted in �The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,� this new entry is a bit darker, more conventional and more crisply made than its 2005 predecessor, which pulled in $292 million domestically and an amazing $452 million internationally. Given the abundant visual wonders and large action quotient, Disney and Walden Media have no reason to fear B.O. will be far off those marks this time around.
The second of C.S. Lewis� seven books in the early 1950s series, �Prince Caspian� returns the four Pevensie children to the magical realm more than a millennium, in Narnian terms, after they helped vanquish the White Witch to become kings and queens themselves. That the young actors have grown significantly gives the film a somewhat different, more grounded feel, as does the central presence of the title character, a young man who must fight to claim the throne that�s rightly his.
Returning director Andrew Adamson and his co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely overhaul the novel�s structure by opening in Narnia with a childbirth and a related assassination attempt on Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Forced to flee from his castle, Caspian ventures deep into a forest, where his kind are not meant to go.
By this time in Narnian history, the colorful assortment of creatures and talking animals familiar from the initial story have been banished to the boonies, supplanted in the power structure by the Telmarine race -- dark-haired types who speak with an unspecified Mediterranean accent. Suspicious of any Telmarine by nature, the small band of dwarves, centaurs and chatty, furry critters aren�t sure what to make of Caspian, who has been usurped by his venal uncle, Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto).
Enter the British kids, who are delighted to depart wartime London but deflated to find the land they remember gone to ruin. In a lovely touch, the Pevensies -- eldest Peter (William Moseley), blossoming young woman Susan (Anna Popplewell), teen Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and little Lucy (Georgie Henley) -- find themselves commemorated in cave art. The all-powerful lion Aslan proves elusive, although Lucy pursues her own private contacts with him in the forest.
Showing a surer sense of cinematic values in his second live-action venture, �Shrek� vet Adamson stages the surging action with verve and a respect for old-school virtues, rather than tricking it up with modern affectations. Caspian�s flight from the Telmarine castle -- a splendidly iconic one built on a rock and approachable only by bridge over a deep ravine -- and stealthy return in the dead of night are dramatically filmed in considerable darkness. The reappearance of Tilda Swinton�s White Witch is a riveting surprise but has the unfortunate side effect of making you wish she�d step out of her pane of ice, as she desperately desires, to take a central role here.
When all is said and done, this is a pretty straightforward war film. Once Caspian escapes, Miraz�s men methodically prepare to conquer the wayward Narnians by building a big bridge across the river to the forest. Final combat comes in two stages. First, to avoid carnage on both sides, a winner-takes-all mano a mano 
is arranged between the vain Miraz and Peter (who for 15 years was High King of Narnia, after all). Scene is tensely and intensely enacted, with some unusual details. 
When this doesn�t do the trick, however, the two armies pour it on, with the balance swaying this way and that for nearly a half-hour of CGI-dominated mayhem. Given that there�s no question as to how it will turn out, and that Aslan will eventually intervene at the crucial moment, pic is still able to play a couple visual-effects trump cards that provide something audiences haven�t seen before.
Barnes has the dark, dashing looks that will make teen girls turn out more than they normally would for a battle epic. The undercurrent of attraction between him and the now mature Susan adds a measure of romantic appeal, as does the latter�s evolution into something of an action heroine. The four kids overall have more character and are therefore more interesting to watch than they were before, and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that�s implacable but not overplayed.
Required locations featuring forests, mountains and open ground in New Zealand, Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic provide an overall feel of timeless, untouched natural surroundings, and the cascade of visual effects are even more impressive than they were the first time around. Production values are tops, and Harry Gregson-Williams� score vigorously supports the film�s forward movement without becoming overbearing. 


Things never happen the same way twice. Thus boometh Aslan the lion (Liam Neeson ), alias the Son of God, popping his computer-generated shaggy head briefly into The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian  to pep-talk a bunch of discouraged Brits into fighting the good fight again.
As in life, so in sequels. Aslan and other once-key figuresand by extension the Christian ethics of author C.S. Lewis , who would likely have been more disgusted than amused to know that his wildly popular 1950s childrens novels have inspired a blooming 21st-century movie franchiseare no more than bit players in the new movie by Andrew Adamson . Not that the first Narnia   did shabby business in 2005: $65 million its first weekend, over $700 million worldwide. But part deux  comes with a visible mandate to bring home yet more baconon the order of, say, the Harry Potter   moviesand to attract a slightly older and far more male demographic.
If Prince Caspian  falls to Indy 4  at the box office, it wont be for want of trying to out-he-man the competition. Adamson has retooled the old-fashioned, handmade charms of his first Narnia into a schoolboy epic strung together by CGI-laden action sequences featuring men and boys wearing metal while showing mettle. Gone, aside from a fleeting resurrection of flash-frozen evil late in the day, is Tilda Swinton s White Witch, while sweet Pevensie sibling Susan (Anna Popplewell )she of the bee-stung lips and distaff habit of pouring oil on troubled waterscomes to us improbably refurbished as a girl warrior. A dab hand with the bow and arrows in a tight squeeze, Susan briskly repels the longing glances cast at her by Caspian (Ben Barnes ), a deposed heir to the throne who has literally blown the suggestively phallic horn that Susan left behind at the end of part one, to recall her to Narnia. It would never work, she admonishes the deflated swain. After all, I am 1300 years older than you.
Inevitably, character and story suffer. Though Prince Caspian  continues the first Narnia s terrified fantasy of foreign occupation that lingered in England just after World War II, when Lewis wrote his novels, theres something both less magical and less human about the new incarnation. This time, the Pevensie children re-enter the world where they once earned the right to be kings and queens not via a musty old cupboard, but via the no-less-smelly London Underground  at Trafalgar Square . The Narnia they find, abandoned by Aslan and by them, has fallen into disrepair. Nature itself has shut down, the trees dont walk, the animals dont talk, and all that remains of the brave new kingdom they left behind are some dignified centaurs and a potential resistance force composed of gnarly-looking, mildly depressed, and fatalistic short people with funny accentsin other words, Englishmenheaded by a grumpy dwarf (Peter Dinklage ) and a knightly mouse (Eddie Izzard ). The marauders, by contrast, are a virile and vaguely Mediterranean bunch of thugs and politicians with no great respect for the rule of law. The rest of the movie, with perfunctory pit-stops for speeches about whether God owes man or vice versa, is armed combat between swarthy humans, buffed centaurs, and two boy-Brits quarreling over who has the bigger, er, sword. This all culminates in an entertaining final conflict featuring the biggest, hairiest water sprite youve ever seen helping to restore peace, prosperity, and the divine right of kings to Narnia.
Prince Caspian  is fairly good fun, and Im trying to decide whether it was the capable swordplay or Ben Barness bedroom eyes that prompted a significant shift in brand loyalty on the part of my 10-year-old, who announced that shes had it with the cute penguins and henceforth will attend only actioners, no matter how bloodthirsty. That may bode well for Prince Caspian s juvie box office. But a wimpy mother who grew up on the Narnia  books misses kindly Mr. Tumnus with his skinny pectorals and red scarf, and the cuddly cockney beavers (half-heartedly replaced in the sequel by an overly benign badger and Izzards intrepid mouse), and the growing-up struggles that played out on both sides of the land of War Drobe in the country of Spare Oom.
Hell, Id even settle for a little more overt Christianitythough, give or take the washing of self-sacrificing Aslans wounds by two adoring females, even the first Narnia  was about as Christian as The Golden Compass  was atheist. As befits a movie whose target global audience is more likely to funnel its worldview through Buddha, Muhammad, or Mao than through Jesus, Prince Caspian  settles for more tactfully generic hints at a higher authority. A pity that, other than the fights, everything else in the movie is equally bloodless.
