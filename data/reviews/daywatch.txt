Last year's Night Watch  was an almost unwatchably hectic Russian mashup of The Matrix  and vampires, with edits so merciless and mythology so thick and Slavic it was as if you were watching a videogame by Tarkovsky. Day Watch , its gentler sequel, is no less nonsensical as it continues the story of ''Light Ones'' battling ''Dark Ones'' in present-day Moscow. If you don't take it seriously  i.e., if you're able to laugh at the notion of a piece of chalk that undoes time  the sequel is a minor wackjob head trip.

 The second installment of Timur Bekmambetov’s bustling supernatural trilogy cares not if you’re familiar with the first. Save for a brief recap of its overcooked mythology, this movie picks up without explanation a number of years after “Night Watch”  concluded, rejoining the champions of Light and Dark and their forever fragile truce.  There are Anton (Konstantin Khabensky), the flawed Light Other, struggling with the sin of attempted infanticide; his creepy son, Egor (Dima Martynov), dallying with the Dark in payback by sucking blood — with a straw, no less — from unsuspecting retirees; and Kostya (Aleksey Chadov), the hot young vampire who likes to do laundry between chugs of animal blood.  Most crucial  is Svetlana (Maria Poroshina), the trainee Night Watcher, who we know is extra special because she can enter the Second Level of Gloom. That’s nothing; by the time the credits rolled, I was well into the Fourth Level myself.  Unfolding in a decrepit, present-day Moscow, “Day Watch” dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who transform into clouds of mosquitoes, swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged.  “Day Watch” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has body swapping, blood sucking and throat piercing.

Bursting with incident and FX, "Day Watch" will delight fans of its predecessor, "Night Watch," but further annoy those antipathetic to the Russkie-made supernatural franchise. Although more flashily assembled, pic's relentless onslaught charms less over a running time almost 25 minutes longer. Reuniting original cast and key crew, "Day" follows "Night" where the latter left off, making no concessions to newcomers, to tell how its paranormal patrolman-hero gets his hands on a piece of chalk that literally rewrites history. "Day" dawned in January with a record-breaking $35 million B.O. locally, but looks to yield Fox slightly less than "Night" internationally. 
Structure follows its predecessor's virtually beat for beat, starting with an ancient-history lesson, followed by multiple storylines set in contempo Moscow that ultimately converge, enabling a climactic, blood-soaked sword-and-armor battle. In fact, "Day" resolves both pics' storylines so tightly, it's hard to imagine where the next installment, "Dusk Watch," in development, can go.
Opening this time is the story of how 14th-century Mongol conqueror Tamerlan acquires the Chalk of Destiny (the pic's Russian handle), which allows its user to make what is written come true.
Flash-forward to the present, and paranormally gifted Anton Gorodensky (Konstantin Khabensky) is training Svetlana (Maria Poroshina), the latest recruit to Night Watch, a quasi-police organization. The two, who secretly have the hots for each other, met in "Night Watch"; since then, she's had a blonde makeover. Anton is a Light Other, and Night Watch is dedicated to regulating the activities of Dark Others.
Answering a call about an attack on a grandmother, Svetlana discovers the perpetrator is Egor (Dima Martinov), Anton's 12-year-old son, who joined the Dark forces in "Night Watch." Egor's amusing method of extracting the life force from victims involves use of a child's juice box.
Anton later destroys evidence to protect Egor's identity lest the latter be punished for his infraction. This reps the first intimation that the theme in this pic will be the porous boundary between good and evil. Allegory hunters may see in this fantastical world as a mirror of post-Communist Russia, with yesterday's oppressed evolving into today's oppressors.
Rest of the pic proceeds to crosscut between: Anton, who gets in trouble and must briefly swap bodies with colleague Olga (Galina Tyunina); Egor and his Dark Mentor, Zavulon (Viktor Verzhbitsky); and a bewildering subplot involving young vampire Kostya (Aleksei Chadov) and his butcher father (Valery Zolotukhin). Beefed-up presence of the last two explains why such major thesps were needed for fleeting roles in the previous pic. (Following this logic, Russian topliner Gosha Kutsenko, who only wanders through both films briefly, will finally get something major to do in the third leg.)
Returning helmer Timur Bekmambetov operates according to the philosophy that more is better, be it in terms of design, camerawork, faster editing, or broader perfs. At times, the effect is dizzying, as the camera soars upward through ceilings one time too many, or the editing is as intoxicated as the guests during the final party sequence. Latter, especially, goes on a little too long -- like all Russian parties.
Still, there's something admirable about pic's the refusal to make itself more friendly to Western auds, despite the franchise's acquisition by Fox. Pic feels resolutely by and for Russians, right down to the score by Yuri Potyeyenko, which alternates atrocious heavy-metal blasts with accordion noodlings.

Night Watch , you may recall, told of an ancient feud waged between the forces of Light and Dark. In the interest of maintaining a fragile détente, they organized themselves, as Russian super-combatants are wont to do, into complex bureaucracies, with the Night Watch heroes monitoring the vampiric shenanigans of the Day Watch set, and vice versa. Inevitably, shit happened, for the most part localized in a secret dimension of the universe known as the Gloom. Predominately an arena for computer-generated bust-ass, the Gloom was also the favored hiding place of the local mosquito population, which explains why you can never nail the tricky little bloodsuckers.
The hero of Night Watch , Anton Gorodetsky  (Konstantin Khabensky ), found himself tangled in the fates of two über-Watchfolk called the Great Others. Svetlana (Maria Poroshina) emerged to support the Night Watch, while Anton's son Egor (Dima Martynov ) matured into a terrible ally of the Day Watch. Everyone ran around willy-nilly, things exploded, etc.
Based on a trilogy of Russian bestsellers (Day Watch is here, Dusk Watch on its way), the film was a huge hit in Russia; tricked out with digitally enhanced Extreme Subtitles, it went on to make a decent chunk of change in the States as an arthouse/fanboy crossover. The novelty of a supernatural blockbuster rendered in a Russian idiom lent Night Watch  extra zest, but apocalyptic vampire spectaculars are, after all, a universal language, and director Timur Bekmambetov  brought plenty of post-Matrix  aplomb to the proceedings.
Day Watch dawns with a whiplash refresher course in the backstory before diving into an inspired set piece concerning the provenance of the Chalk of Fate. This hilariously lo-fi magic implement will be sought after by Anton to thwart the diabolical schemes of Zavulon (Victor Verzhbitsky), a nefariously nouveau-riche Day Watcher. Hell-bent on abolishing the truce, Zavulon masterminds a standoff between the Great Others with the help of the Sorceress Olga (Galina Tunina ), a vixen in cherry-red leather with a penchant for gunning her sports car across the facades of skyscrapers.
Rad, no? Actually, no. Strange to say in a season of mind-splitting mayhem, but not nearly enough shit gets blown up in Day Watch . Bekmambetov lovingly crafts a world you want to see morph, spin, and shatter to bits, but he obliges only grudgingly. Perhaps he's too entranced by his creation. With help from art director Valery Victorov , maestro of densely sculpted shabby chic, and the superb, gem-toned intensities of cinematographer Sergei Trofimov , the film looks terrific: Imagine what Wong Kar-wai  might do with Blade 4 . But the human touch is less than inspiring, and Bekmambetov's thrown a big, fat hug around the inconsequential psychodramas of his vague principals. He invests in their two-dimensional conflicts at the expense of three-dimensional marvel.
Day Watch  may be most "Russian" in its heavy emphasis on interpersonal conflict, but its people are a bore. Anton's anguished responsibility over his son's fate is more synthetic than the special effects and feels considerably less lived-in than any given set. Khabensky, a popular Russian actor of limited range and sickly appearance, is actively unappealing, his distinct unpleasantness a laudable change of pace from the puppet heroism of the standard American alpha male but even less involving. And Poroshina's Svetlana barely registers a pulse. The most compelling thing about this ostensible Great One is her magnificently tacky fashion sense.
The worst thing Bekmambetov has picked up from his American models is the tendency of megasequels to aggrandize material grown enervated, to compensate for thinness by spreading out. His story sporadically jerks to life, then settles back into the maudlin, distracted, or merely vacant. For an hour or so there's rhythmic excitement in these spasmodic rhythms, the weird rush of something unpredictably unhinged . By Day 's wearying end, not so much.
