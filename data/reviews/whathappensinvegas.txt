For all its bright lights and ersatz glitz, Las Vegas can be a dispiriting place, loud and desperate, thick with smoke and dogged by a groupthink tight-grinned directive: You will
 have fun in Vegas. There's something of that same desperation and forced cheer in this jaded comedy of unmarriage starring two Hollywood actors known for their prankishness and pluck. Overplucked here, turns out: Diaz and Kutcher practically pant with franticness trying to convince us that these! yuks! are! fun!
 They play two halves of a one-night stand that turns into a quickie marriage; plans for an annulment derail when husband and wife win a $3 million jackpot, and a sadistic judge (Dennis Miller) sentences them to six months of "hard marriage" before they can divorce and/or touch the money. A strident Diaz plays against type, shackling the good-time gal to play a tightly wound Wall Street she-warrior recovering from a bad breakup. Sans her elastic charm, Diaz recalls Ellen Barkin's ice-in-the-veins but shows none of that actress' tempering smolder. Kutcher plays to his strength � unemployed frat-boy humor � but watching him try to smooth his pretty face into lovesick sincerity is like watching a bucket bang around a well long gone dry. Both the actors and the characters they play are a terrible mismatch, but then screenwriter Dana Fox has something of a fetish for awkward couplings: Her last go-round, The Wedding Date
, was girl-meets-paid male escort. British director Vaughan previously made the sweet coming-of-age film Starter for 10
 and the accomplished BBC adaptation of Trollope's He Knew He Was Right
 but here shows none of the sensitivity or distinction of those pictures. And if you're gonna hire one of the funniest American comedians working today � Zach Galifianakis � and shove him to the side of the frame, then frankly, you can take what happens in Vegas, keep it in Vegas, and keep the rest of the us out of it.


A little insobriety never hurt a romantic comedy. In its whooshing prime, the genre used to feature big cocktail parties where the stars flirted, caroused, and cavorted.
Now the leads go to bars and are desperate to hold their liquor. It's last-call romantic comedy. No one is sober enough to be clever, or self-possessed enough to be sexy. The hookup is the gateway to love. And that's possible only after the lovers have shared the most intimate humiliation, the way strangers who walk away from horrible accidents feel close.
"What Happens in Vegas," which staggers into megaplexes today, is that kind of accident. When it was over I felt vaguely embarrassed. I wasn't just leaving a movie theater. I was taking a walk of shame.
This movie gives us the braying Ashton Kutcher and an intensely toned Cameron Diaz as Jack and Joy, New Yorkers who meet after they're booked in the same Vegas hotel suite. They get drunk and married. Just before breaking up, they hit a $3 million jackpot and are sentenced by a judge to "six months' hard marriage" before they can split it. Having survived this beery movie and that noisy marriage, it's fair to say I deserve a cut, too.
After the casino horseplay ends, Jack and Joy return to their lives, where the schemes to end the marriage begin. (Whoever violates the judge's terms loses the money.) The film turns into a long two-way episode of Kutcher's old "Punk'd" show. If that sounds exciting, it's not. The filmmakers cut between Joy and her best friend (Lake Bell) discussing the same legal loopholes as Jack and his best friend (Rob Corddry). They concoct the same sneaky plot. And the only conclusion to be drawn from such incriminating crosscutting is that these four minds share one small brain.
Kutcher gets to fake spousal abuse during mandatory couples therapy with an inexplicably cast Queen Latifah. Diaz gets to pummel Kutcher with oranges, beat him with a loaf of bread, and admonish him with PG-13-friendly profanity. At some point, she even slides along a bar and crashes onto the floor, then pops up like an exclamation point and yells. There appear to be more "wooooos!" in Dana Fox's script than any actual words.
"What Happens in Vegas," which Tom Vaughan directed, has a lousy time making the fight for money more than a sport. Neither Joy nor Jack appears to need it. She's angling for a big Wall Street promotion. He lives in a capacious loft at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge (on a worker-bee carpenter's salary). The movie might have been way more interesting as a class comedy about a war between two broke and desperate people. Instead, it wraps up with our stars more or less reminding each other, as much as us, that they're loaded - and, on this occasion, scandalously overpaid.


Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz hate on each other with dynamite verve in What Happens in Vegas . The Punch and Judy fireworks get off to an early start, when the two wake up in Las Vegas only to learn that they got hitched during what should have been a sloshed one-night stand. To lay claim to a $3 million slot-machine payoff (one pulled the lever, the other provided the quarter), the two are forced to live together for six months as husband and wife, and I would say that the romantic hilarity just ensues from there, except that Kutcher and Diaz diss each other with such eye-rolling, fang-baring, sexually sarcastic conviction that you may think you've wandered into a dinner-theater revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  starring (and rewritten by) Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman.
He , declares she, is a childish slob who wouldn't know how to carry on a relationship with the hair balls in his sink; she , declares he, is a control-freak snob who doesn't think she's good enough to be loved. The insults fly with whip-crack timing, except that I missed what the old comedies of masculine-feminine venom like It Happened One Night  used to have, which is a spark of affection rolling around the embers of anger. Kutcher, who gives his most energized performance to date, and Diaz, darting between the caustic and shrill, look as if they're warming up to groovy hate sex, not love, which may be why the film goes flat the moment it turns friendly.


 “What Happens in Vegas,” one of those junky time-wasters that routinely pop up in movie theaters, won’t make you laugh much or at all. (Once was enough for me.) But if you know anything about the art or have ever marveled at how even the most generic of old B movies look pretty good (they were usually in focus, for starters), you may wonder how a major studio like 20th Century Fox could release something this crudely manufactured, with its graceless setups, unstable lensing and ghastly lighting. It also makes you wonder if executives at studios look at dailies, much less can hear the poetry of the English language.  The word dailies here refers to select material shot that day and viewed by certain crew members. Dailies can be projected as prints or watched on videotape or both, but are now often digital and displayed on monitors, which may affect quality control. Because, unless you’re David Fincher and a genius, or an obsessive-compulsive, it may be easier to ignore your mistakes when they look like specks on a computer monitor. Or as Robert Elswit, the cinematographer for Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood,” which used traditional dailies, said on digitalproducer.com: “The other great thing about seeing film dailies is that you can’t kid yourself about focus and all the other technical issues that can come back to bite you.”  This digression may seem off the point of “What Happens in Vegas,” but because its director, Tom Vaughan, brings nothing of interest to the movie, including filmmaking, there isn’t anything to say other than to note its insulting ugliness and ineptitude. The badly matched Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher  mug wildly, waving their limbs like upturned beetles. Ms. Diaz is particularly ill served by the material and the production; she’s harshly, at times brutally, lighted and often unflatteringly costumed. It’s disheartening that Ms. Diaz doesn’t seem to realize that there’s no upside to a role that strips away her dignity even as it peels off her clothes, especially when she’s playing the shrew. It’s no wonder Mr. Kutcher looks so relaxed.  Though it’s more sitcom than romcom, “What Happens in Vegas” recycles a plot — a separated couple reunite — that will be familiar to anyone who’s had the pleasure of watching films like “The Awful Truth” and “It Happened One Night.” The philosopher Stanley Cavell anointed this subgenre of 1930s and 1940s delights comedies of remarriage, stories driven by the effort to get the couple back together and involving what he terms overcoming skepticism. The couple aren’t  sure if reuniting is a good idea but do so anyway, as when Rosalind Russell warily eyeballs Cary Grant at the end of “His Girl Friday” and says, right after he plants a wet one: “I’m just a fool. That’s what I am. I know what it’s going to be like.”  She knows, and we do too, having been given a glimpse of that happily ever after in the rat-a-tat of the couple’s wisecracking romancing. There are no wisecracks in Dana Fox’s screenplay for “What Happens in Vegas,” just insults, yucky yuks (“I threw up in my purse”) and exposition. The couple, strangers who marry during a Vegas drunk and stay together to hold on to a fat casino payout, enter without a shared history or much personality. They learn to live as a couple through mutual abuse and pranks: he removes the toilet seat, and she solicits some “sluts” to tempt him into contract-breaking infidelity. The cynicism about human beings (us included) reeks as much as the filmmaking.  “What Happens in Vegas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). May induce headaches.

"What Happens in Vegas" leads to neo-screwball comedy in New York, and the result is an undemandingly diverting and exceptionally commercial pic that should click with its target 25-and-under demo, and probably woo respectable numbers of older ticketbuyers as well. Shrewdly positioned by Fox as counterprogramming to the early summer flash and filigree of "Iron Man" and "Speed Racer," this two-seated star vehicle for top-billed Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz wrings a respectable number of laughs from a formulaic scenario about attracted-opposites who bicker and back-stab their way toward happily-ever-aftering. 
Some trend-conscious wags won't be able to resist describing "Vegas" as Judd Apatow Lite, since it's about a self-involved slacker who becomes more directed and/or responsible as a result of his relationship with a more mature woman. But, really, that set-up already had whiskers long before Apatow became a brand name.
In fact, the roots of this new pic can be traced back to screwball comedies of the '30s and '40s. The big difference -- well, OK, one of several big differences -- between "Vegas" and those fast-paced comedy classics is that "Vegas" actually becomes more enjoyable as it tamps down the over-the-top helter-skelter of its early scenes.
Dana Fox's screenplay pivots on impulsive decisions by two dissimilar New Yorkers to vacation in Las Vegas. Jack Fuller (Kutcher), a party-hearty underachiever, takes this trip as a reward to himself after being fired by his father (Treat Williams) from a furniture-manufacturing job. Joy McNally (Diaz), a stressed-for-success commodities trader, flies to Sin City to salve her bruised ego after being dumped by her fiance (Jason Sudeikis) in earshot of other guests at his surprise birthday party.
Each character is accompanied by a best buddy -- a second-rate lawyer (Rob Corddry) for Jack, a wisecracking cynic (Lake Bell) for Joy -- but that doesn't stop them ending a long evening's drunken revelry with a spur-of-the-moment visit to a Vegas wedding chapel. Come the morning after, the regretful marrieds are ready to file for an annulment once they return home. But then Jack plays a slot machine with Joy's quarter, and wins a $3 million jackpot.
Back in the big Apple, an acerbic judge (Dennis Miller) with conservative ideas about the sanctity of matrimony refuses to resolve the dispute over the $3 million jackpot, and challenges them to make the union work by sentencing them to "six months hard marriage," with the first one who asks out losing the cash.
So ultra-organized Joy must move into Jack's sloppy apartment. And the slackerish Jack must pretend to enjoy life with a woman who makes impossible demands, like putting down the toilet seat and not dumping his dirty laundry everywhere.
Naturally, each character tries to undermine the other, in the hope of ending the cohabitation and, more important, seizing the money. Just as naturally, the antagonists gradually warm to each other, pushed steadily closer as Joy charms members of Jack's family, and Jack ingratiates himself to Joy's boss (Dennis Farina).
There are no big surprises, and only a handful of unexpected developments. But Kutcher and Diaz are undeniably appealing as they go through familiar motions in custom-fitted roles, and the scene-stealing supporting players (Corddry, Bell, Farina and Queen Latifah as a marriage counselor) go about their petty larceny with amusing adroitness. Brit-born helmer Tom Vaughan ("Starter for 10") tries too hard at first to emphasize free-wheeling zaniness, but settles into a smoother groove to keep this utterly disposable but lightly entertaining pic afloat.
Tech values are mostly unremarkable. Las Vegas scenes are conspicuously lacking in the snap and pizzazz auds have come to expect from interludes in the gambling mecca.
