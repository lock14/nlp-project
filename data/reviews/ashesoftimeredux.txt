The best way to approach Ashes of Time Redux   Wong Kar Wai's ravishing swirl of an ancient Chinese martial-arts saga, restored and expanded from his original 1994 production is to prepare to get lost. I mean literally, thrown without compass into a thicket of imagery and time-shifting both undeniably gorgeous and ultimately inconsequential, about characters as interchangeable as they are operatically grand, with their big loves and crazy style. The late Chinese matinee idol Leslie Cheung plays a brokenhearted swordsman, rejected by the woman he loves, who subcontracts his bounty killings; Tony Leung Chiu Wai from In the Mood for Love  plays one of the blades for hire.
When it was first released, with a handsome cast that included Brigitte Lin, Carina Lau, and Maggie Cheung, Ashes  marked Wong (in his only martial-arts pic) as a master of moodily avant-garde, pop-inflected visual gloss. (He went on to make Happy Together  and In the Mood for Love .) This version has been opulently restored, rescored, and reedited, with digital colorization that intensifies the lurching beauty of Christopher Doyle's inimitable cinematography. For the love of all things sensual and mysterious, see this one on a big screen.


The temptation of artists to fiddle with their earlier works brings predictably mixed results in "Ashes of Time: Redux," helmer Wong Kar-wai's revisitation of his 1994 swordplay movie that competed at that year's Venice fest to connoisseur plaudits but general bemusement. For a long time not widely available on ancillary, and with the original negatives and sound materials imperilled, pic has now been restored in a version that more than captures the strikingly vivid, super-forced color palette of Christopher Doyle's lensing. "Redux" goes out Stateside via Sony Pictures Classics in September.
New version of Wong's genre-bender runs two minutes shorter than the Venice print and five minutes shorter than the Hong Kong version. (Latter was bookended by swordplay montages to increase the action quotient, as there's relatively little fighting in the very philosophical, talky film.) But apart from a few dialogue excisions, added intertitles denoting various Chinese solar terms, and Taiwanese actress Brigitte Lin now speaking her own dialogue in Mandarin, it's basically the same densely plotted movie that played Venice.
With two exceptions. Completely new main and end titles, in color, replace the original's stark black-on-white ones and the original music score by Frankie Chan and Roel A. Garcia has been almost entirely replaced by new material and re-arrangements by Beijing-born Wu Tong, including cello solos by frequent Wu collaborator Yo-Yo Ma.
Both decisions have the effect of taking the pic out of the period in which it was made and giving it a look and feel that was largely alien to Hong Kong cinema of the mid-'90s, as well as separating it from the territory's pop-culture tradition. Wong has essentially rewritten his own auteurist history, re-positioning the pic among his output from "In the Mood for Love" onwards.
Chan and Garcia's lyrical synth-based score, with its breathy woodwind, rousing main theme and even other-worldly vocals, has been replaced by a much heavier, darker, more classical-Western score, which makes the whole viewing experience even more claustrophobic, in line with Wong's past three features.
Movie is still an amazingly bold take on an established genre -- as bold visually and structurally for its time as "Hero" (also lensed by Doyle) was to be eight years later. But it's now a picture divored from its true cultural and temporal roots.

Cynics make the worst romantics; they should know better, they know they should know better, and they'd die if you  knew better. Forced underground by a formative heartbreak, a cynic's romantic nature can flourish into a sort of private dementia. You can take my weary word for it, or you can take Wong Kar Wai 's, whose new/old film, Ashes of Time Redux , wittily, earnestly, gorgeously sets up the paradox he has returned to throughout his career—that of romantic memory as both scourge and succor.
Wong is nothing if not consistent in his themes (loneliness, disconnection, obsession with the past) and in his characters (proud, haunted, imperially alone), and in Redux , he successfully imposes his sensibility upon the usually strictly observed genre of wuxia , a historical strain of martial arts, kick-'em-up flicks. It's a vision that seems to have arrived fully formed: Wong wrote Ashes of Time  as a kind of prequel to Hong Kong author Louis Cha 's classic wuxia  bestseller, The Eagle Shooting Heroes , and in 1992, the film began a six-month bête noire shoot in the Chinese desert. Wong made his breakthrough film, Chung King  Express , while still wrestling Ashes  to the ground in post-production; the latter film received only a smattering of distribution and has been little-seen in the U.S.
That should change with Redux , a full-scale refurbishment of the original, featuring a new score by Yo-Yo Ma , some possibly new or unseen footage (Wong is cagey on the subject), and a digitally remastered print in which many of cinematographer Christopher Doyle 's adoring close-ups and leering desert-scapes have undergone flashy color restoration. The upgrades did not thin the plot, such as it is, down to easily digestible spoonfuls, but then Wong's narrative appetite has never been that interested in satisfaction; he would rather push the idea  of satisfaction around on a plate, a technique which somehow proves most satisfying of all.
Structured over five seasons taken from the Chinese almanac, Redux 's touchstone is Ouyang Feng (Leslie Cheung ), an assassin-for-hire who runs a drifter hotel in East Buddha Nowhere. Ouyang suffers a limited variety of guests (killers and those seeking a killer) while refusing to pine for the woman (played by Maggie Cheung ) who married his brother. "The root of man's problems is memory," Ouyang says, a theory taken up by various barefoot, blind, lovesick men and berserk, devoted, defeated women. Every now and then, a swordfight breaks out or, more accurately, a sequence  breaks out—as jarring in arrival as it is in impact—almost painted onto the screen from an impressionistic palate of swish-pans, sound cues, and slo-mo. Even more memorable is Doyle's exquisite shadow-play; a birdcage and a moon-face are all he needs.
Wong has a bit of a wink with all of the deadpan death threats and grand allusions—women rake their cheeks along tree bark, limestone, and a horse's neck in fits of longing—before turning mannerism into the very stuff of transcendence, as with Maggie Cheung's penultimate lament. It's a knowing end-run around cliché that seeks to assert the damnable truth of cliché itself. In a move that would become his trademark, Wong rejects the happy ending for the almost ecstatically sad, making your heart soar even as he tells you, essentially, that it's impossible, all of it—that it'll never work.
