         Directed by Michael O. Sajbel, from a screenplay by Cheryl McKay and Sajbel, "The Ultimate Gift" is based on the successful book by Jim Stovall. The story concerns a spoiled-rotten, super-rich playboy who is cut off after the death of his grandfather. His inheritance is contingent on his completing a series of tasks, referred to as "gifts," each teaching him a different life lesson. It's sort of like Adam Sandler's "Billy Madison," except it's a drama. Along the way he encounters a single mom, a sickly girl, South American drug dealers and, not unexpectedly, discovers a deeper sense of purpose.
 
 The film is being released by Fox Faith, a division of 20th Century Fox dedicated, per the company's website, to "morally-driven, family-friendly programming." Apart from one not-so-subtle anti-abortion message and that the characters take time for religious worship, the film's values are fairly well encoded into the story, such that it feels less like a sermon and more like a film with a good, if somewhat sappy, heart.
 


         






   The film constantly teeters on the fulcrum of its own treacly good intentions and simplistic parable-like storytelling, and the extent that it stays balanced is largely thanks to its agile cast. Drew Fuller makes the transition of the lead character plausible, though it may be no surprise that a young actor seems more at home as a self-obsessed party boy than a self-realized do-gooder.
 
 Ali Hillis, identifiable to the obsessed Shane Black fan as a mean, drunk and slutty sidekick from "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" — her character here, it goes without saying, exhibits none of those qualities — gives the young mother a likable vulnerability. Veterans James Garner, Bill Cobbs, Brian Dennehy and Lee Meriwether are all used to add a certain respect-your-elders gravity as well.
 
 The folks behind "The Ultimate Gift" received a gift of their own in casting young Abigail Breslin well before the "Little Miss Sunshine" star went on to become an Academy Award nominee.
 
 Though she exhibits some of the same lovable pluck as her signature character, in "Gift" she slides helplessly into more conventional Cute Kid territory. "The Ultimate Gift" perhaps is best seen as an example of just how lucky a performer, especially one so young, must be to find a script, a part, director(s) and costars that all align to aid in creating something special. Even when a project has its values in order, as "The Ultimate Gift" surely does, it still takes something more for the end product to transcend into the realms of art.
 
 "The Ultimate Gift." MPAA rating: PG for thematic elements, some violence and language. Running time: 1 hour, 54 minutes. In selected theaters.   

 Reeking of self-righteousness and moral reprimand, Michael O. Sajbel’s “Ultimate Gift” is a hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox’s new faith-based label, Fox Faith. If the goal is to attract Christian dollars to the multiplex, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of their owners is not the best way to go.  The focus of our learning and growing is Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller), a trust-fund baby who shows up at the funeral of his billionaire grandfather, Red (James Garner), sporting morning-after shades, day-old stubble and a dangling cigarette: the badges, if not the wages, of sin. Before he can get his hands on granddaddy’s money, however, Jason must complete a series of tasks assigned by Red via a videotaped will and designed to teach the value of friendship, love and all the other things we like to believe rich people are lacking. Should Jason’s spirit quail, there’s an adorable, leukemia-stricken child (Abigail Breslin) waiting in the wings with a bottomless supply of homilies. And you thought her performance in “Little Miss Sunshine” was saccharine.  As Jason braves drug runners in Ecuador, and a stint on a Texas ranch laying fence and listening to Patsy Cline (“So this is hell,” he moans), the movie’s messages — pro-poverty, anti-abortion — are methodically hammered home. And while it’s always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, “The Ultimate Gift” is a cinematic sermon that even reprises its bullet points during the end credits. In case anyone is wondering, I totally aced the test afterward.  “The Ultimate Gift” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some bad words, a few bad people and a cattle prod used as a motivational tool.

Although cynics likely will reject "The Ultimate Gift" as warmed-over Capra-corn, this predictable but pleasant drama based on Jim Stovall's popular novel may be prized by those with a taste for inspirational uplift and heart-tugging sentiment. It's being pitched to the same ticketbuyers targeted for "The Last Sin Eater," "Love's Abiding Joy" and similar Christian-themed fare marketed by Fox Faith. But "Gift" could break through to a slightly larger aud in theatrical release, if only because it soft-pedals its religious elements -- discussions of faith and God are fleeting, almost subliminal -- without stinting on the celebration of wholesome family values.
Up-and-comer Drew Fuller (TV's "Charmed") stars as Jason Stevens, an improvident, trust-funded twentysomething who truly comes of age only after he partakes in a unique self-improvement program.
Long estranged from his fabulously wealthy grandfather, folksy tycoon Red Stevens (James Garner), Jason expects little in the way of an inheritance after the old guy dies. Much to his surprise, however, he finds he could get a much bigger payoff than Red's other, greedier heirs. The catch is, Jason has to accept a series of challenges designed to provide a full syllabus of life lessons.
Under the stern eye of Red's skeptical lawyer (Bill Cobbs), Jason reluctantly (and resentfully) begins a curriculum that involves grueling field-hand work for a Texas rancher (Brian Dennehy) and hardscrabble struggle as a homeless wretch after eviction from his posh apartment. Sporadically, the young man is "lectured" by Red, who videotaped a series of messages before his death. But even the most encouraging of these homespun homilies suggest that the tycoon was a tough-love taskmaster.
"Gift" nearly jumps the shark when advanced study leads Jason to the jungles of Ecuador, where he is kidnapped by bandits and threatened with execution. (At this point, some suspicious viewers might wonder whether scripter Cheryl McKay will cap her episodic scenario with a climax or two borrowed from David Fincher's "The Game.") But the melodrama is tamped down just in time for a shamelessly corny but surprisingly affecting plot development to have potent impact.
Capably directed by Michael O. Sajbel (who worked on a much larger scale last year as helmer of "One Night with the King"), "The Ultimate Gift" benefits a great deal from solid work by well-cast thesps. Fuller may be a shade too believable as a spoiled lout in early scenes, but he gradually generates sympathy as Jason grows and evolves under pressure. Garner and Dennehy inhabit their supporting roles with easygoing authority and sly humor.
As a feisty young leukemia patient who decides James would be a swell match for her single mom (Ali Hillis), Abigail Breslin demonstrates her range with a performance markedly different from her turn in "Little Miss Sunshine." Cobbs and Lee Meriwether (as another of Red's long-time employees) neatly balance each other as their characters dutifully chart Jason's progress.
Filmed entirely on locales in North and South Carolina, the indie production has a professional polish comparable to that of far pricier pics.

In the latest release from the faith-based division of 20th Century Fox , an oil-rich billionaire (James Garner ) kicks the bucket and leaves a special bequest for his trust-fund-suckling grandson (Drew Fuller )a gauntlet of hard work and hardship designed to give the boy an appreciation for the true value of a greenback. Among the tasks: living as a homeless person, and showing some genuine compassion for a debt-addled single mom (Ali Hillis ) and her leukemia-stricken daughter (Abigail Breslin ). If he succeeds, the "ultimate gift" of the movie's title will be hiswhich, in case you haven't figured it out, is one of those things you can't buy with a MasterCard . Directed with accomplished impersonality by Michael O. Sajbel  ( One Night With the King ), The Ultimate Gift  means well, but in the end it's The Pursuit of Happyness  made from the ivory tower looking down instead of from the street looking up.
