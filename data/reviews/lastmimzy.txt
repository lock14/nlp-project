This children�s sci-fi movie should be palatable to the young and old alike, yet it�s ultimately more a mild diversion than a magical adventure. Based on Lewis Padgett�s 1947 short story, �All Mimsy Were the Borogoves,� the film has been updated to include references to homeland security and the PATRIOT Act and various New Age-y beliefs. Nevertheless, the plot raises more questions than it answers and will crumble if poked too aggressively. Good performances (especially by the two child leads and The Office
�s Wilson as one�s science teacher) help vitalize the mishmash, however, and make the whole thing a reasonable choice for family entertainment. The story gets going as a brother and sister, while vacationing with their Seattle parents at their second island home, discover a black box in the water that contains strange symbols, spinning artifacts, and a homemade-looking stuffed rabbit named Mimzy. Only 5-year-old Emma (Wryn) can understand the unintelligible sounds Mimzy makes, and her big brother Noah (O�Neil) helps her decipher their meaning while also becoming something of a science whiz. They keep all this hidden from their parents (Richardson and Hutton), which, of course, would end the story right there. After Noah builds a generator and Emma starts levitating, homeland security comes crashing through their front door to whisk the family off to their special research facility. (However, in an unrealistic touch, these goons disappear just as quickly once Mimzy is sent back on her way and don�t show even the slightest interest in studying these �special abilities� kids, � la The Fury
 or X-Men
.) The special effects are extremely tame when compared with state-of-the-art visual voodoo and are likely to disappoint the science-fiction aficionados. Curiously, The Last Mimzy
 is directed by New Line Cinema�s founder, co-CEO, and co-chairman, Bob Shaye � his first directing foray since 1990�s Book of Love
. (Some might recognize Shaye as the archenemy in Peter Jackson�s struggle to direct The Hobbit
 � an affront to the director whose Lord of the Rings
 trilogy made New Line a bucket of money.) Shaye�s direction of The Last Mimzy
 is bland and undistinguished and assures his continued reign as a film executive.


It's generally not a good sign when a studio executive decides to direct a movie, and even more worrisome when his last time behind a camera was 17 years ago. Who knows why Bob Shaye , the head of New Line Cinema , decided now would be the time to make a film out of the 1943 science-fiction story "Mimsy Were the Borogoves ," by Lewis Padgett (a pen name for the married SF writers Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore )?
The results, titled "The Last Mimzy ," are too awkward for serious-minded adults and teenagers, and much too complicated for small children. For smart kids between the ages of 8 and 12, though, the movie hits the sweet spot with a satisfying cosmic bang. It's a cross between "A Wrinkle in Time " and a middle-school version of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind ," and while "Mimzy" doesn't carry the "Twilight Zone" chill of the original story, it still has the power to pry open young minds.
As does the strange interstellar care package the two Wilder children find on the beach one day. Noah (Chris O'Neil ) is the bespectacled 'tweener, Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn ) his moon-faced kid sister, and they intuitively know to hide their discovery from their parents (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton ). Since the mysterious box contains rocks that Emma is able to levitate into a small whirlwind, that's just as well.
There's also a cute toy rabbit named Mimzy that -- shades of Teddy in "AI: Artificial Intelligence " -- apparently has a supercomputer for innards. Whatever it whispers into Emma's ear has the effect of advancing her brain power in great evolutionary leaps. This terrifies the baby sitter and, to be honest, freaks her brother out a little. By this point, though, Noah's talking to spiders and getting them to build teeny-weeny suspension bridges.
What's the message Mimzy's trying to impart? How does Noah knock out the lights of Seattle? Why is the local director of Homeland Security (Michael Clarke Duncan ) running around with his knickers in a twist? And why are all the adults in the movie complacent dullards?
Because, I think, their own brains have stopped growing. "The Last Mimzy" is an empowerment fable for older kids and its message is: Never stop learning, or questioning, or pushing past the boundaries of what the grown-ups say is possible. At first it seems like Noah will be the hero of the piece, but then dreamy Emma comes to the fore, and by the end both siblings are equally critical to fixing what needs to be fixed. I don't want to say what that is, but, trust me, it's big.
Rainn Wilson of "The Office " and "Six Feet Under " plays the hippie science teacher who connects Noah's classroom doodles to the 14th-century Tibetan mandalas they replicate. He and his girl-friend (Kathryn Hahn ) are used to both present the case for New Age open-mindedness and to show its vapid limitations; by the final scenes they're standing on the sidelines like slack - jawed extras at the end of "Close Encounters."
Plot holes? "The Last Mimzy" has them by the pound. It also includes a few egregious bits of product placement, one of which is used as a joke that doesn't quite come off. You can't really argue that this is a well-made movie, but it is a good one -- true to the emotional reality of its young characters and young audience and flattering the latter into thinking way outside the box. There are worse things to teach than intellectual ambition.


         "The Last Mimzy" is indeed a puzzler.
 
 Being a "family film" may excuse many faults, considering the intended audience, but it's hard to think of a recent movie that has more determinedly married the engaging with the banal. In this genre the only important questions are, "Will the kids like it?" and "Is it good for them?" To which the answers to "Mimzy's" mysteries are "maybe" and "sort of." Adults are left to fend for themselves. 


         






   FOR THE RECORD:

  'The Last Mimzy': The March 23 review in Calendar of the movie "The Last Mimzy" incorrectly attributed the score to James Horner. Howard Shore composed the music. —
 
 Among the sci-fi fantasy's interesting ideas: scientific interpretations of ancient Tibetan mandalas and "Through the Looking-Glass." Among those not-so-interesting ideas: a tepid critique of modern disconnection — on a bus ride, the passengers all wear iPods or bury their noses in laptops — and that love is the answer.
 
 Young Seattle siblings (Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) discover an intricate container of strange objects. Among these treasures is a stuffed rabbit ("Mimzy") that delivers messages in odd purrs to the 6-year-old girl. The kids display extraordinary abilities as they try to unlock the meaning of these "toys," aided by a groovy science teacher (Rainn Wilson of TV's "The Office") and his palm-reading girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn). Eventually the kids and their parents (Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson) run afoul of a reluctant Homeland Security official (Michael Clarke Duncan). Poor Duncan: It's tough to understand what he's doing in this role and tougher still not to laugh at his final line.
 
 Luckily for the plot, the authorities have only one security camera and no guards to watch over terrorism suspects with inexplicable powers, setting up a chance for the kids to solve the objects' riddle and possibly save the world.
 
 Co-written by Bruce Joel Rubin ("Ghost"), the movie is haunted by the spirit of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" in more ways than already described but which would be unfair to detail here.
 
 The film is clearly well-meaning but hampered by the heavy-handed direction of Robert Shaye (who's also the founder and head of New Line Cinema) and egregious use of James Horner's score, constantly cuing the warming of the heart. The kids' acting is uneven, but Wryn's high adorability quotient saves lines like, "I don't want the world to end. I love the world."
 
 It also carries an eco-friendly message about pollutants, but does so with clumsy fingers. Says one child, "Why don't they do something? Why don't they stop it?"
 
 To which the mellow teacher responds, " 'They' is all of us."
 
 Best, perhaps, not to look too deeply into "The Last Mimzy."
 
 "The Last Mimzy." MPAA rating: PG for some thematic elements, mild peril and language. Running time: 1 hour, 38 minutes. In general release.   

A thingy from the future  part toy, part New Agey objet   falls to earth, and the siblings (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and Chris O'Neil) who discover it hide the alien marvel, E.T. -style, from their parents (Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson). The Last Mimzy , a pleasantly dorky adaptation of Lewis Padgett's 1943 sci-fi story directed by New Line honcho Bob Shaye, bobbles its topicality (Homeland Security has no business here) and its clunky product placement (rah-rah Intel!). But the newcomer kids are delightfully...kidlike. Cosmic bonus: The Office 's Rainn Wilson plays a New Agey science teacher.

 Invoking Lewis Carroll, "E.T." and Tibetan Buddhism, "The Last Mimzy" is an overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama about a dying planet, resourceful kids and a science teacher firmly in touch with his spiritual side.  Adapted from Lewis Padgett's "Jabberwocky"-inspired short story, "Mimsy Were the Borogoves," the movie follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings, Noah and Emma Wilder (Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn), who find a mysterious box on the beach of their Seattle summer home. Among its contents are a stuffed rabbit and some strange crystals,  and as the children play with them, they begin to develop unsettling abilities. While Noah talks to bugs and draws Tibetan mandalas, Emma becomes convinced that the bunny is trying to deliver a message. From the future.  Despite leaden direction (by New Line Cinema's founder,   Bob  Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam — including palm reading, levitation, time travel and telepathy — "The Last Mimzy" is a wholesome, eager entertainment that doesn't talk down. Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn are particularly effective as Noah's science teacher and the teacher's New Age-y fiancée, supplying the energy missing from Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson's parental performances and goosing  the clunky screenplay at critical moments.  The latest entry in the swelling ranks of poisoned-planet movies, "The Last Mimzy" suffers from jarring product placement — aimed at parents rather than children— and an overdependence on close-ups. A film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame.  "The Last Mimzy" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a thimbleful of strong language and a bucketful of New Age ideas.

A curious bandersnatch of a movie, "The Last Mimzy" is destined to attract attention because of its director -- New Line Cinema's founder, co-CEO and co-chairman Bob Shaye, who has returned to filmmaking for the first time since 1990's "Book of Love." It may also attract a solid kid aud, thanks to recognizable stars and the magic-driven, new-agey theme of imperiled humanity rescued by children. However, awkward cinematography and a lack of long shots give the film a claustrophobic feel. Distribution is assured; not so, perhaps, Shaye's triumphant return to the helmer's chair. 
The story, adapted from Lewis Padgett's "All Mimsy Were the Borogroves" (a title drawn from Lewis Carroll's "The Jabberwocky") concerns two ordinary children drawn into extraordinary adventures at their Seattle summer home by the arrival of a curious black box. Inscribed with obscure symbols, it makes noises like a whale and contains a large, blue, glass snail; an ornate, encrusted sea shell; and an antique-looking stuffed rabbit. The last of these is Mimzy, an emissary from the future who speaks in a strange language and must return to her time with something to rescue humanity from pollution and disease.
Noah (Chris O'Neil) and Emma Wilder (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) become Mimzy's accomplices, and come into possession of strange powers and prodigious intellects. Noah, for instance, studies spiders for his school project and discovers how to use various frequencies to get the insects to change the shape of their web. (They build one with the shape and strength of the Golden Gate Bridge.) Emma, who sometimes loses contact with the ground as she floats along, can glimpse the future via intersecting laser beams produced via rock-like "spinners" -- another gift of the black box.
Problem is, not a lot of this is connected with the main mission in the story. From the mandala-like field of flowers that opens the film to the various themes of telepathy, palm reading, levitation, crystals and time travel, Shaye offers a catalog of alternative spirituality, a few raps at the Patriot Act (after the kids cause a blackout, there's a frightening home invasion by the FBI) and the general message that the world is warming, ailing and on the way out. But there are too many distracting elements to allow a viewer total immersion in the story.
If the Wilder family is as close as we're led to believe, for instance, why don't the kids tell mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton) about the black box? Because that would pretty much end the movie; keeping secrets is an essential in children's literature. "The Last Mimzy" is no different, but the children in question, while likable and sweet, are not portrayed by very compelling actors.
Rainn Wilson is very good as Noah's science teacher, Larry White, and Kathryn Hahn is perfect as Larry's ironic Buddhist girlfriend Naomi. Neither Hutton nor Richardson seem particularly invested in the movie, but their characters are not very deeply drawn, rather serving as parental props.
Kids will like "Mimzy" if for no other reason than it doesn't talk down to them. And it imagines they will laugh and respond to the same things as adults, something adult filmmakers often have a problem understanding.

Hardcore phantasie geeks will relish role-playing every enemy of The Last Mimzy , a family-style sci-fi adventure whose director, Bob Shaye , is better known to them as the evil wizardthe alien executive who peed all over the Fellowship. Shaye, in his other job as New Line Cinema  topper, has let it be known that he'll wander Middle Earth for two eternities before handing The Hobbit  to Lord Peter Jackson, with whom he's been jousting for Rings  residuals. So Shaye's Mimzy , about kids with magick powers who heed a stuffed animal's urgent call from the future, will need to seek its box-office bounty without adequate listserv forcesa shame in that the movie, while no Two Towers , has sizable nerd appeal.
Shaye, a mogul whom even Variety  dared to call "curmudgeonly," has cast himself as the movies' chief villain before. Years ago, I heard him being booed and hissedhell, I was booing and hissing him myselfat the New York Film Festival 's "town meeting" held three weeks after 9/11. The topic was "Making Movies That Matter," and while others on the celebrity panel impassionedly invoked Godard, Shaye made sure we knew that the first Lord  was coming soon, that "American culture will suffer" from any change in Hollywood  that might reflect the new terror wars, and that Sam Goldwyn  was right to say that Western Union  is the best way to send a message. (Boo! ) But the director's chair will do funny things to people: Within the first half-hour of Shaye's kid-friendly message movie, hamburger is outed as "chopped-up cow," special toys are touted as educational tools, and our young-sibling heroes get their important mission. "The soul of our planet was sick," a grown-up instructs. "People had become isolated and warlike."
Calling 10-year-old Noah Wilder  and his little sister, Emma. Cute as buttons, natch, these kids are also gifted and talentedas well as privileged enough to have parents whose Pacific Northwest  beach-house tide brings a black box even more awesome than Noah's prized Play-Station. Among other things, the box contains a seashell that sounds vaguely like the monolith in 2001,  and a stuffed animal, Mimzy, whom five-year-old Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn ) can hear saying things like, "Dad's gonna call" or "Dad will be here soon." Played by a sleepy-eyed Timothy Hutton , workaholic-lawyer Pop takes a leave of absence after realizing that heretofore wimpy Noah (Chris O'Neil ) may have been a lot more than lucky to hit a golf ball some 300 feet on the driving range. Meantime, Mom (Joely Richardson ) totally wigs out, particularly when the science teacher's New Age-y fiancée (Kathryn Hahn ) discovers "purity" in Emma's palms and suggests that Noah might be a "tulkus"i.e., really special.
Mr. Pure Entertainment that he is, Shaye likely wouldn't admit to supporting a wartime subtext here, though it's unmistakable. For one thing, the movie is based on Lewis Padgett 's short story "All Mimsy Were the Borogroves" from 1943, when the notion of young allies saving the world would've had real resonance. Mimzy 's topical updates (most by way of Spielberg) include a Homeland Security officer (Michael Clarke Duncan ) who traces terrifying power surges to the Wilders' address and who sends men with guns and jangling keys to bust through the front door. As the kids come to realize that the fate of humanity rests on Mimzy's ability to bring DNA info back to the future whence she came, close encounters with other alien-visitor movies abound. Alas, while Emma makes a suitable surrogate for Drew Barrymore 's Gertie, Mimzy is no E.T. Shaye  directs stuffed animals like a pro, but he can't compensate for the fact that his title character is merely an inanimate bunny with the Intel  logo branded on its innards.
That Shaye the auteur would snuggle up to a cuddly kids' toy is surprising, in that this is the man whose greatest gifts to film culturesorry, one-ringersare a chainsaw-swinging Texan with a leather face and a shit-eating transvestite from Baltimore. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  and Pink Flamingos , which New Line distributed in the early '70s, are enough even amid Shaye's hissable comments to give the guy Gandalf status in my book; if the recovered hippie wants to put out a goofy ode to crystals and palmistry and ancient Tibetan symbolism and the power of home-schooling, I say let him. Mimzy , whose charmingly retro FX date to around 1985, won't post Peter Jackson  figures at the box office, but you can't say that Shaye doesn't have the magic touch. It makes sense that Mimzy 's most inspired character played by Rainn Wilson  in a playful riff on Tolkienist dorkdomis a guy who hits winning lottery tickets in his sleep.
