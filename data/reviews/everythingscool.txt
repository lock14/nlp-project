 Here is an idea worth pondering from “Everything’s Cool,” a breezy polemic about the politics of global warming: The fossil fuel industry doesn’t care who wins or loses the debate about the reality of global warming,  as long as the public continues to feel that it is debatable.  To put it differently, doubt means delay. On television, where every issue is presumed to have two sides, shills from the fossil fuel industry glibly dispute the overwhelming scientific evidence for global warming. Casual viewers can thus reassure themselves that they don’t have to worry about climate change. Given the warnings that the world has a narrow window of opportunity to reduce carbon emissions drastically, who doesn’t wish that those oil and coal flacks and their well-funded political supporters were right?  “Everything’s Cool,” a documentary directed by Daniel B. Gold (who narrates) and Judith Helfand, and adorned with clever animations by Jeremiah Dickey and Emily Hubley, traces the politics of  global warming politics back to 1987, when the phenomenon was more commonly called the greenhouse effect. According to the movie the issue didn’t become politicized until the oil and coal industries recognized a threat to their economic well-being and undertook a misinformation campaign that continues to this day.  Although the underlying outlook of “Everything’s Cool” is dire, the movie adopts a cheerful comic tone to avoid scaring audiences. Instead of the grand overview of global warming offered by Al Gore in “An Inconvenient Truth”  it leans toward the Michael Moore school of activist filmmaking while avoiding Mr. Moore’s rabble-rousing stunts.  The directors’ attitudes parallel those of Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, who rattled the environmental movement three years ago with their critical essay “The Death of Environmentalism.” Those writers, who appear in the movie, disparage what they call the “I have a nightmare” tone of doomsayers who think that pictures of polar bears stranded on ice caps will move the public. Doom and gloom prophecies promote passivity, they argue. People have to be informed of the potential economic and social benefits from developing  clean new energy technologies.  In its determination to entertain, “Everything’s Cool” sometimes slips into frivolity. A segment about the eco-disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow” is neither enlightening nor amusing. The film wastes too much time observing Bish Neuhouser, a snow groomer at a Utah resort who converts his vehicles to bio-diesel fuel. It observes Heidi Cullen, the Weather Channel’s resident climatologist, as she is taught to dumb down her climate reports and deliver them in an easy conversational tone. Like putting pills in applesauce, the frivolity at least makes the movie’s bitter medicine easier to swallow.  In scenes of more serious uplift, Bill McKibben, the activist and author of “The End of Nature,” is shown organizing a grass-roots demonstration in Vermont. And Ross Gelbspan, who has written extensively about  global warming, is seen addressing high school students in Brookline, Mass.  But the forces feeding the resistance to change remain intractable. The movie retells the appalling story of Philip Cooney, a lobbyist for the oil industry hired by the White House to head its Council on Environmental Quality, who edited and softened alarming scientific reports on climate change to make them appear ambiguous. Two days after The New York Times published an article about his alterations, he resigned and was quickly hired by Exxon Mobil.  Just below the movie’s attitude of pep-rally cheer is a mood that approaches despair. Mr. Gelbspan  has probably amassed as much hard evidence of climate change as anyone alive. He intimates that, realistically, it is too late for fundamental changes that would halt global warming to be put into practice within what he sees as a 10-year deadline.  “It is a curse to know this stuff,” he says. And it is a curse to even think, “Why bother?,” which would mean abandoning the fight. And so he persists.

Can a movie about global warming genuinely be called lighthearted? If so, Daniel B. Gold and Judith Helfand's "Everything's Cool" comes as close as one imagines possible, essaying yet more inconvenient truths about the potential future of our planet in the same buoyant, irreverent style the filmmakers brought to their last activist docu, "Blue Vinyl." Given its arrival in Al Gore's footsteps and the sudden glut of media attention focused on the subject, pic may face a certain climate-change fatigue on behalf of the ticket-buying public, but should receive plenty of exposure from fests and small-screen docu broadcasters.
Probably the biggest single factor working against "Everything's Cool" is that its primary subject is the difficulty in raising Americans' awareness about global warming, and yet the film arrives at a moment when awareness may be at an all-time high.
That said, Gold and Helfand paint a considerably livelier cinematic tableau than "An Inconvenient Truth" as they travel the country, interviewing a diverse cross-section of artists, scientists and average Joes who are devoting themselves in various ways to the betterment of the environment. In Sundance, where it premiered, the pic was of particular interest for including a section shot in Park City, Utah, and focusing on one Bish Neuhauser, a "snow groomer" at the Canyons ski resort who is trying to convert all of the facility's transport vehicles to bio-diesel fuel.
Other colorful personalities abound, from global warming "poet laureate" Bill McKibben to the Weather Channel's on-air climatologist Dr. Heidi Cullen and, most intriguingly, authors Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, whose essay "The Death of Environmentalism" levied harsh criticism on the traditional environmental movement and advocated a new progressivism. That sense of disorganization even among like-minded activists makes for one of the pic's more compelling points and communicates a sense of why it has taken so long to bring the global warming debate to the average American's dinner table.
Gold and Helfand have a lot on their minds, and they do a generally good job of whittling down an unwieldy subject into an energetic 100-minute package that, like "Blue Vinyl," includes funky animated interludes courtesy of animators Jeremiah Dickey and Emily Hubley. Unashamedly partisan pic tends to drag and seem a tad dated only in those sections devoted to criticizing the government and "experts" retained by oil companies to refute climate-change science.
But "Everything's Cool" can be downright euphoric in its sense of ordinary people doing their part for the planet, capped by the remarkable image of some 1,000 Inuit villagers (together with special guest stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Salma Hayek) arranging their bodies into a massive human art project that spells out the words "Arctic Warning" when seen from above.

Sometimes you've got to be part of the problem to be part of the solution," intones a voice over at the beginning of Everything's Cool , a well-intentioned but glib documentary about global warming. The solution here seems to consist of driving around in a Ryder truck painted with the phrase "G_ _B_L _ _ R_ _ NG" and asking people to fill in the blanks. This diversion sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is gratingly condescending toward its audience and sorely lacking in any substantive information about the problem or the solution. The most interesting scenes by far take place at the Weather Channel 's Atlanta headquarters, where a newly hired climatologist struggles to cram her massive expertise into sound bitesher dismay at not being allowed to use the word "ironic" is pitch-perfect. But mostly we get long, dreary clips of icicles melting and children playing in slushy snow that are downright manipulative: Ice and snow melt every spring, and highlighting micro-changes that are well within the parameters of normal variation does nothing to explain the broader problems of climate change.
