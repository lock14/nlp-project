Drag Me to Hell
 opens with a crafty little tip-off of what's to come: the Universal logo, circa 1980. It's a nod to the fanboys who have waited patiently for Raimi to return to the "splatstick" horror genre he more or less invented with 1981's Evil Dead
 and its two sequels � the giddy, gooey classic Evil Dead II
 and the outright goofy (but terrific) Army of Darkness
. Drag Me to Hell
 never quite hits the psychotronic heights of Evil Dead II
 � Raimi's working with a PG-13 rating this time out � but, in the interim, the director has honed his skills to a razor's edge in the creation of nerve-racking suspense and jarring shocks. This film is, quite simply, one hell of a ride. It moves with the herky-jerky gait of a spook-house trolley car, rocketing along for whole sequences and then punctuating them with shock cuts and tinnitus-inducing Foley cues that'll have audiences wishing they had borrowed a pair of grandma's Depends before entering the theatre. Raimi co-wrote the script with his brother Ivan in the downtime between Spider-Man
 films, and the story is as basic a terror tale as they come. Lohman's good-girl loan officer Christine goes against her better judgment and denies an ancient gypsy crone (Raver, filling in nicely for the late Maria Ouspenskaya) an extension on her mortgage. This unintended faux pas leads to a curse and three days of cloven-hoofed horror as the gypsy-summoned lamia demon stalks Christine in preparation for her final takedown into the titular abyss. To summarize more would spoil the fun, and Drag Me to Hell
 is nada if not a big, crimson bucketful of fun. Raimi pairs his love of Three Stooges-style physical comedy with moments of pure gross-out schtick (Dig that anvil scene! Groovy!) and ends up with one of the purest and flat-out satisfying horror films in decades. There's something wonderfully retro about Raimi's atmospheric creep show, and the film is studded with unobtrusive homages to shockmeisters past (Jacques Tourneur's The Leopard Man
 and John Hough's The Legend of Hell House
 are duly noted). But the real reason to celebrate Drag Me to Hell
 is the simple fact that an obviously enthusiastic Sam Raimi is back behind the camera, Greg Nicotero and the KNB EFX Group are manning the latex-and-caro-syrup gore effects, and summer Saturday afternoons were made for matinees exactly like this one. Drag Me to Hell
, which premiered at South by Southwest, is nothing short of horror-hound heaven.

In 1981, Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" made a breakthrough for cheap-looking schlock. He found the comedy in dismemberment. The horror had a kind of slapstick kick, simultaneously funny and frightening.
Not only did the homemade quality lend the terrifying impression that, on your next trip to the woods, demons would descend, but the movie looked like you could have made it yourself. That's an illusion. A new generation of horror-comedy was born, but Raimi's inventive combination of precision and gnarly panic was hard to duplicate.
Raimi made two sequels (among other, straighter Hollywood movies) but would go on to become the more polished, better-funded director behind the Spider-Man franchise. He gave those movies an amiable pop-whiz that honored adolescence instead of pandering to it. But let's face it, the soaring professionalism of "Spider-Man 2" is a long way from the winking trash of "Evil Dead II."
His jubilant new movie, "Drag Me to Hell," splits the difference between blockbuster and schlock: a horror movie that eventually finds that contagious comic high of Raimi's no-budget youth, but with grown-up money now.
A young California bank loan officer named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), eager for a promotion, refuses a little old lady's request for an extension on her mortgage payment. The old lady (Lorna Raver) is a nasty crone. Actually, she's something a little more problematic  - a Slavic "gypsy" with a touch of evil. In any case, she removes her dentures, steals candy, hocks up some radioactive-looking mucus, begs on her knees for the extension, and, as she's being thrown out of the bank (yes, she's that foul) installs a hell-bound curse that Christine spends the movie scrambling to remove.
Christine leaves the bank, happy that she's impressed her nasally boss (David Paymer) and upstaged her chief rival for the job (Reggie Lee). But the old lady is waiting in the back of Christine's car to inflict more foulness. Their tussle is a nimble cartoon dance whose comedy is entirely physical and whose horror is entirely corporeal. The old lady's fanged dentures unwittingly fly out of her mouth, so when she goes in to bite Christine she winds up gumming the girl's chin.
That sequence is the tip of a gross iceberg. And as expertly orchestrated as it is, I wasn't convinced "Drag Me to Hell" was working by the time that parking lot fight ends. The principle problem is Lohman, a 30-year-old blonde who sounds like a drunk baby. In order for the supernatural effects to impress and for the plot to take off, Lohman is required to stand around and watch them happen to her. Raimi is a good filmmaker, but he can't keep you from asking the age-old horror-thriller question: Why don't these people ever run for their lives  - or, at least, run faster?
But eventually the movie lets its star in on the joke, and Lohman's bright, gurgling manner becomes a sharp gameness that makes Christine's attempt to cleanse her soul a lot more fun. The turning point occurs with the words, "Here's kitty." You'll have to see for yourself why, but it brings down the house while dispelling any idea that the filmmakers aren't fully in control.
"Drag Me to Hell" is a loose showcase of everything Raimi couldn't have tried in a Spider-Man movie  - scatological gags, talking goats, a debate over Freud and Jung. (Christine's unwaveringly supportive boyfriend, played by Justin Long, is a psychology professor.) There's even a séance that requires Adriana Barraza, the Oscar-nominated nanny from "Babel," to speak with the devil's tongue. (The sound, meanwhile, has been designed to hasten hearing loss. Surely in some town, using Digital Dolby Surround for the vomiting up of what can only be called maggot-fried rice is a crime.)
But working with his brother Ivan, Sam Raimi is laughing with us  - and often louder than we are. (That glee is audible in the sound design, too.) Previously, the trouble with Raimi has sometimes been that you didn't trust him. Movies like "Darkman" and his Spaghetti-O western "The Quick and the Dead" were hard to take seriously. His laughter had turned into a smirk. "Spider-Man" restored a kind of joyful sincerity to his work. The latter stages of "Drag Me to Hell" demonstrate a particularly delightful commitment to the task at hand. Raimi succeeds at giving literal moviemaking a good name, while providing diabolic catharsis for many a disgruntled homeowner.

Drag Me to Hell , Sam Raimi's delirious psych-out of a horror film, is a candy-colored ghouls-gone-wild nightmare that treats every shock as a joke  or, at least, as an invitation to crack up at your own gullibility. Raimi, like Roman Polanski in his classic Repulsion  (1965), surrounds a comely blond lass (Alison Lohman) with demons that seem to be erupting right out of her head. He gets into our heads, too; he scares the unholy living bejesus out of you. Raimi's operating model is the fun house, with its jack-in-the-box terrors, but he doesn't just toy with the audience. He plays it, like a maestro. He orchestrates a tongue-in-cheek symphony of fear.
Lohman, with her slightly dazed, rabbit-toothed sensuality, plays a bank worker who refuses to renew the mortgage of a one-eyed, rotten-toothed old gypsy woman (Lorna Raver). Lohman then spends the rest of the film fighting off the curse the gypsy has placed on her. She's assaulted by flash-cut visions of baroquely grotesque and evil things, starting with the gypsy herself, a hideous crone  who has a way of taking out her false teeth and, well, doing stuff without them. Their first encounter in a parking garage is like  a slasher showdown crossed with a wrestling blowout; it unites the audience in a collective moan-laugh-shriek. The bedroom nightmare that follows is so gross it redefines the phrase in your face , and from then on we're clamped into a state of tingly anticipatory anxiety.
Raimi directed all three Spider-Man  films, but in the '80s, before he went Hollywood, he made The Evil Dead  and its sequel  splendid exercises in slapstick mutilation and whooshing-camera dread. Drag Me to Hell  marks a return to their spirit  even if it's only PG-13!  but it's also a deftly unified freak show that keeps intensifying as its wormy-devil images keep spewing. Going back to his roots, Raimi has made the most crazy, fun, and terrifying horror movie in years.

 Many directors search for, but few find, that elusive intersection of chills and chuckles where Sam Raimi built his early reputation before being swallowed by the cultural weight of the “Spider-Man” franchise. When he made “The Evil Dead” in 1981, he was just 22, an ebullient boy whose movie thrummed with the excitement of its creator. Back then his stampeding camera, over-the-top imagination and cheeky way with foliage felt new and invigorating, a kick in the pants for jaded horror fans and a wake-up call for genre filmmakers.  At a time when horror is defined by limp Japanese retreads or punishing exercises in pure sadism, “Drag Me to Hell” has a tonic playfulness that’s unabashedly retro, an indulgent return to Mr. Raimi’s goofy, gooey roots. More jolting and juicy than the typical PG-13 offering, the movie has a perfunctory plot that centers on Christine (Alison Lohman), a tenderhearted loan officer at a California bank.  Eager to prove to her boss (David Paymer) that she can toughen up in time for a demanding promotion, Christine denies a mortgage extension to a milky-eyed crone with yellow fingernails and matching sputum (a gleefully disgusting Lorna Raver). Later, in the menacing blankness of an underground parking garage, the old woman expresses her displeasure. Flying dentures are only the warm-up.  This early set piece, a breathtaking blur of energetic body slams and artfully deployed office supplies, is much too cartoonish to be repellent. (Only Mr. Raimi can make granny-bashing hilarious.) Emerging from the melee cursed by her elderly foe, Christine spends the remainder of the movie fending off an evil demon and the concerns of her milquetoast boyfriend (Justin Long), an earnest professor tired of returning home each evening to shattered furniture.  As her character arcs from sweet-submissive to deadly determined (and her wardrobe from business chic to mud-drenched T-shirt), her director rushes through a disastrous dinner party and a demented exorcism with giddy velocity, accomplishing more with curling shadows and billowing drapes than with an army of computer-graphics specialists. And if he seems a little too fixated on orifice abuse — Christine’s mouth and nose are repeatedly invaded by things that spurt and slither and suck — his visuals never feel punitive. Mean-spiritedness is not his way.  Swift and sure, “Drag Me to Hell” unfurls in vertiginous, comic-book frames, like a long-lost issue of “Tales From the Crypt.” Neither small humans nor smaller animals are exempt from the carnage, which is orchestrated (by Mr. Raimi and his screenwriting sibling, Ivan) to recall memorable moments in horror-movie history. The most chilling of these is the sight of the old woman’s car (played by Mr. Raimi’s own 1973 Oldsmobile), idling in the parking garage like the malevolent Plymouth Fury of John Carpenter’s “Christine.”  As for Ms. Lohman, she suffers the indignities of the genre like a champ, morphing from mouse to hellion as her expiration date approaches. And while no one will mistake her journey — whose title sounds like a desperate plea from the director’s fan base — for a masterpiece, the movie has a crackpot vitality that breaches our defenses.  In films like “Darkman” and the thematically similar “Spider-Man 2,” Mr. Raimi revealed a gift for merging the human and the fantastic, sustaining poignant love stories in the midst of horror and revenge. His talent is greater than this, but for now this will do.  “Drag Me to Hell” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A feast of flies, phlegm, fisticuffs and embalming fluid.

Sam Raimi returns to his roots in "Drag Me to Hell," a flagrantly schlocky horror yarn that will titillate the teens without alienating the director's far pickier fanboy contingent, who will find the "Evil Dead"-style action they've been clamoring for in a surprisingly potent PG-13 package. When the bank forecloses on an old gypsy's house, it's the unlucky young loan officer who risks having her soul repossessed in this throwback to both Raimi's early work and '50s B-movies. After booking the pic in coveted midnight slots at the SXSW and Cannes fests, Universal should see strong awareness yield heavenly returns.
As its no-nonsense title suggests, "Drag Me to Hell" offers a kicking-and-screaming riff on the classic curse movie -- and if the material scarcely warrants feature length, so be it. Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience's buttons, and who better than Raimi to do the honors? Long before he went legit with "A Simple Plan," helmer was perfecting inventive shocks on shoestring budgets, and, as if to remind us of that legacy, he opens this modestly budgeted film (by "Spider-Man" standards, at least) with an early-'80s Universal logo.
First scene further cements the tone, as an innocent boy (though not so innocent as to avoid being cursed) attempts to outrun his imminent damnation, only to be thrown from a balcony and swallowed whole by a gaping, fiery chasm in the earth. It's hard to imagine such a fate awaiting Christine (Alison Lohman), a sweet young lady gunning for the assistant manager job at her local bank, until we see the almost comically unkempt old hag who comes begging for an extension on her mortgage.
With one bad eye, gnarled fingernails and inexplicably jagged dentures, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) is clearly the reason Raimi and his brother Ivan decided to write this in the first place. She's as memorable a villain as Christine is forgettable a heroine, and the fact that Mrs. Ganush means bad business is so evident in her introductory scene that the mere appearance of her car (played by Raimi's own instantly recognizable 1973 Oldsmobile) in the parking garage is enough to make neck hairs stand on end.
On the losing end of a showdown that makes creative use of a stapler and several other everyday office supplies, Mrs. Ganush manages to grab one of Christine's buttons and utter a nasty incantation. "Soon it will be you who comes begging to me," she predicts. But the crusty old crone expires before Christine can ask her to lift the curse, leaving our hell-bent heroine with no one but her skeptical fiance (Justin Long) and an in-over-his-head street-corner psychic (Dileep Rao) to advise her on how to escape her fate.
In the increasingly desperate events that follow, Raimi clearly believes the mouth, not the eyes, are the window to the soul, with one grossout gag after another exploiting auds' fear of foreign substances (from ominous flies to Mrs. Ganush's phlegm) entering the mouth. Such off-putting visuals are considerably more effective than Raimi's next favorite trick, which is to ratchet up the already overloud soundtrack alongside a shock cut.
The scares are all delivered in Raimi's usual tongue-in-cheek style, down to the menacing goat-like "Lamia" (seen only in cartoonish silhouette, its shape is a direct homage to Jacques Tourneur's 1957 "Night of the Demon"). It's odd to find so many laugh-out-loud moments amid such genuine tension, but were it not for Raimi's comic touch, auds would likely be outraged by a good deal of the material -- the fate of Christine's kitten, for instance, or the movie's unapologetically backward characterization of gypsies.
Pic seems to have lucked into what little relevance the mortgage crisis lends its story, otherwise so slight as to seem better suited to an hourlong "Masters of Horror" episode. Still, there's no denying it delivers far more than competing PG-13 thrillers (including several from Raimi's own Ghost House shingle).
CG touches -- including the one that'll have auds cheering into the end credits -- look cheap, but practical effects and makeup are tops.


Sam Raimi  wants to go home again. Often a drifting virtuoso in the years before finding his Spider-Man gig, with Drag Me to Hell  Raimi defaults to the horror romps that made his name (specifically, the Evil Dead trilogy), bringing the old barreling camera and viscous ickiness back and serving a concept lowbrow enough to discourage A-listers.
Made early last year from a long-shelved script by Raimi and brother Ivan, Drag Me  has a serendipitously timely victim. Playing a bank loan officer, petite, marshmallow-cheeked Alison Lohman  bears the brunt of the film's supernatural humiliations. Lohman's Christine Brown  is putting the finishing touches on her self-reinvention as a young professional: eye on a promotion, renting L.A. hillside real estate, and heading toward marriage with an upmarket boyfriend, Clay (that he's played by that icon of yuppie brand identity, smug MacBook  shill Justin Long , is perfect). Only leftover photographs and snide comments from Clay's WASP parents give unwelcome reminders of the tubby farm girl she used to be.
One day, smothering her conscience to impress her boss, Christine refuses to take pity on an ancient gypsy woman about to lose her home (Lorna Raver , with a malevolent dead eye, horking up neon phlegm). The Louvin Brothers  were right: Satan is Real. The hag hisses a hex, and Christine's life plan is derailed by a chain of diabolical interventions that play like Seventeen  magazine's "Embarrassing Moments," as written by Antonin Artaud . Christine spouts a geyser nosebleed at work, is ambushed by hallucinations while meeting her potential in-laws, and starts studying animal sacrifice. A visit to a psychic confirms she's had a demon sicced on her and, if it isn't appeased in time, she'll get the title treatment.
With a PG-13 rating, the movie still smuggles a good amount of awfulness into adolescent minds. The running joke involves getting Christine into situations where her mouth—usually wide open, screaming—is invaded by incredibly vile things: a spelunking fly, a gush of grubs, embalming fluid. Otherwise, the harassing spirit comes on Moe Howard –style—one-two snapping her head back and forth, or unloading a full-body across-the-room heave. If the booga-booga shocks are sometimes repetitive, Drag Me  does its audience right in its last-act burst of giddy momentum, sustained by crack editor Bob Murawski  through a burlesque exorcism, Christine's dash to find a substitute for her place in Hell, and the final slamming door of the title card.
The combination of Lovecraftian ichor and Hal Roach  slapstick made Michigan State dropout Raimi a Fangoria   star with 1981's resourceful Evil Dead , on the vanguard of an international groundswell of indie horrors. Kiwi-era Peter Jackson , Return of the Living Dead , Re-Animator , Frank Henenlotter , Nekromantik— these grassroots sickies, marked by tumor-black humor and try-anything camerawork, were an inventive, sanguinary alternative to the flat-out-awful middle range of '80s movies (and, in some cases, résumés for a next generation of blockbuster technicians).
Was this throwback Raimi's way of collecting himself after disappearing into Spider-Man 3 's narrative overgrowth? The sense of control is palpable; Raimi, ever the engineer, takes pleasure in screwing with audience identification, shifting between collaboration and contempt for our heroine. We take Christine's side against a brown-nose co-worker (Reggie Lee , very good), Clay's pinky-in-air parents, and that gypsy witch-bitch, whose lingered-on grotesqueness forestalls sympathy—but it's squeaky-cute Christine who is all along the secret villain.
On the surface an Evil Dead  successor, Drag Me , an allegory with karmic logic from E.C. Comics and Jack Chick , replays as farce Raimi's A Simple Plan  , also based on the boomerang return of transgression. Christine getting bonged on the head with a cross for forgetting the Golden Rule doesn't indicate a particularly nuanced moral vision. Does Raimi—who began his career on a shoestring in the Tennessee woods and now commands $300 million bonanzas—actually believe  professional ambition should be punished with eternal damnation?
