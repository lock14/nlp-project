In adapting his novel for the screen, author Richard Price does himself no favors. His story about simmering racial tension that boils over during the police investigation of an alleged abduction of a white child by a black man from the projects is narratively choppy and erratic. It's stuffed with too many ill-defined characters and behavioral traits that appear somewhat randomly or sketchily � a problem that unfortunately assumes an extra emphasis in this film that purportedly tackles the problems of racial stereotyping and snap judgments. The problem lies not in the plotting alone. Roth's direction does nothing to bring clarity to the story and its characters, and his blocking of the film's action scenes is downright muddled and vague. A master producer and head of Revolution Studios, Roth keeps a hand in directing, but so far the results prove that Roth had best keep his day job. (Some of his recent titles include Christmas With the Kranks
 and America's Sweethearts
.) One recent title was The Forgotten
, which starred Moore as a mother in distress, a role she more or less repeats in Freedomland
, albeit with a working-class, New Jersey accent. One of the few things that is
 clear in Freedomland
 is that Moore, one of the best actresses alive, needs to place a moratorium on these kinds of prepackaged roles. Despite the predictability, Moore manages to infuse this mother's anguish and hysteria with original notes, and is no doubt abetted by Jackson's fully engaged performance as the detective in charge of the investigation. The plot twists in Freedomland
's story will come as little surprise to anyone who remembers the Susan Smith case, thus in order for familiarity not to breed contempt it would be necessary for the film to seize our attention with masterful storytelling and characterizations, which simply doesn't happen. Jackson's detective Lorenzo "Big Daddy" Council, who believes he keeps the lid on the festering frustration in the Armstrong Houses (the Dempsey, N.J., projects where much of the story takes place), is inherently intriguing, but too many aspects of the character are tossed in and left too undeveloped to feel satisfactory. His like-minded relationship with his white partner (Forsythe), his barely introduced relationship with his son (Mackie), his single asthma attack � all provide hints of what underpins this character without ever demonstrating much detail. Freedomland
 also bogs down as a police procedural while characters deliver some wonderful passages that unfortunately end up sounding more like speeches than dialogue. The film's central metaphor ultimately contributes nothing to the film's meaning � Freedomland is a long-abandoned children's home notable for its abuse of its charges that is investigated by a citizens' search and rescue group headed by a dour Falco (in her most anti-Carmela Soprano mode). This film just can't escape the feeling that it's loitering in an emergency zone.


In the oral history of movies, Julianne Moore's entry (the abridged one, anyway) will probably go something like this: She's the perpetual dysfunctional mommy. Whether it's her sorry porn actress with the estranged son in "Boogie Nights" or the paranoid mother of a not-that-dead child in "The Forgotten," movie motherhood for Moore is a nightmare. Last year, she took a break from crazy and gave one of her very best performances as the reasonable mother of 10 in "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio." It was a short vacation.
None of those women compares to Brenda Martin, the violently bereaved mother Moore plays in "Freedomland," an overblown urban crime drama that should be a lot better than it is. Brenda is Moore's most hysterical basket case so far, a single mom who starts a race riot after she tells a detective (Samuel L. Jackson) that a young black male carjacked her in a housing project in Dempsey, a fictitious, predominately black North Jersey township.
Brenda, of course, is from Gannon, the neighboring white, working-class town. And it's not just that she's been assaulted and her car stolen. Her assailant has driven off with her 4-year-old son, Cody, in the back seat. News of the abducted boy provokes the police to seal off Dempsey's Armstrong projects, effectively imprisoning its black and Latino tenants until Cody turns up.
Everyone in Armstrong knows Jackson's detective, Lorenzo Council. They call him Big Daddy, and typically when something goes wrong in this five-building complex, its residents turn to him. Now he's in the unfortunate position of having to shepherd Brenda around as the locked-down Armstrong residents seethe: How dare he coddle this white woman while our civil rights are being violated! Brenda happens to have volunteered in a school program in Armstrong, but that turns moot under the circumstances.
Over the course of two days, Brenda and Lorenzo, helped by scores of other people, search for the kid. And over and over, the authenticity of her story is challenged. What is this creepy, histrionic lady not telling us? Through it all, Moore seems hopped up on sorrow, as if she'd been snorting from mounds of woe.
But then, everybody in "Freedomland" is unhinged. Ron Eldard shows up as Brenda's overheated brother, a Gannon cop whose only function is to yell at and beat up black suspects. In turn, the black suspects, along with the suspects' outraged families (namely the mother and sister of a guy named Rafik), scream and curse back at whomever. The black extras seem to have been instructed just to wave their arms, shake their fists, and roll their necks to simulate outrage. If ever there were a moment for Jackson to revisit his peacekeeping DJ from "Do the Right Thing," this is it: "Whoa! Y'all take a chill!"
The usually great Anthony Mackie and the underappreciated Aunjanue Ellis have nothing to do in vaguely written parts. And I wish I could say that the participation of Edie Falco -- she plays a mother who runs a community group that hunts for missing kids -- contributes serenity to the agitated proceedings, but her humorless tone pushes the picture toward the funereal. When Falco's character leads dozens of citizens in scouring a forest for clues, the film turns downright dreary.
This wasn't so with the 1998 Richard Price novel the movie is based on. Price gave a spectacular performance -- a middle-age white guy, persuasively writing in the voices of white women, black women, and black men. (He did something similar with 1992's "Clockers.") The truth about the crime was a cop-out (as it is in the film), but Price never seemed to be all that interested in going "gotcha." He used the missing child to assay the many fractures of urban politics.
Price did this patchy film adaptation himself, jettisoning a major character, making confusing composites of other characters that never amount to real people, loading the dialogue with expletives and platitudes, and playing up the novel's pulpy core. "Freedomland" was a serious book, but the movie doesn't even work as lurid trash.
The director is Joe Roth, the former studio executive who's produced dozens of big Hollywood movies and has directed both froth ("America's Sweethearts") and dross ("Christmas With the Kranks"). Here he uses garish lighting, twitchy editing, and excruciating amounts of slow motion to prove he means business. Maybe he was thinking "Mystic River." But most of the shots in the movie just prove he has a tin eye. "Freedomland" probably required a Sidney Lumet or a Spike Lee (who made a forceful movie of "Clockers"), directors with urban chops to draw something powerful out of the mayhem.
Instead, Roth just gives an overbearing electronic score that would get on Vangelis's nerves and encourages his actors to brandish their most melodramatic sides. Jackson is the only man who comes to mind while reading the book. But his performance has no range, he's keyed up for most of the film, and the character has been made too dutiful for Jackson to inject any real ferocity. It's disappointing.
Moore, meanwhile, is full-on scary: bombastic and soapy. Of course, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for similar actorly insanity in "Training Day." But Moore is trying to out-act both him and whoever's starring in the movie playing in the theater next door. If it's King Kong, he's got nothing on her.
.


         It's late, in a rough part of town, and a bedraggled blond shuffles down streets that positively shimmer with menace. The woman is oblivious, possibly on drugs, as she trudges listlessly past steaming grates, trailing lights, spooked cats, police protests, candlelight vigils and Samuel L. Jackson sitting in a car, looking troubled. Wandering into a hospital, she holds up her bloodied palms. What's going on? In the fluorescent lights, a few things become clear. The blond is no blond. She's Julianne Moore. And, yes, in fact, she has 
misplaced another kid.
 
  It takes a while for this bit of information to surface, though, anyone who has seen the trailers for "Freedomland," which don't exactly skimp on maternal angst, already knows this is going to be a sad-mommy story. What we don't know is that it may be a bad-mommy story as well. These, along with the mad-mommy roles (which may be combined with the sad, but not with the bad), have become reliable paycheck generators for dramatic actresses older than 40. And Moore, who has seemed so mysterious and inscrutable in the past, is now routinely called upon to alternately try to hold it together (as in "The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio" and "The Hours") or just flat out lose it. Not that it isn't understandable. Moore falls apart better than just about anyone — better, even, than Jodie Foster, who tends to get pinched and turbocharged when her movie children are imperiled. Moore's style is softer. Her biceps graciously recede in the face of danger, granting center stage to the infinitesimal quivering of her delicate, pink-rimmed features. Take away her fictional kid and even her hair hangs limp in defeat. But it would be interesting to see her take on a contemporary role in which she isn't exalted, degraded or, worse, artificially cutes-ified. It's as if her talent had consigned her to the most showboaty roles, when the greatest thing would be to see her play a person again.
 


         






    "Freedomland," written by Richard Price from his novel of the same name, directed by Joe Roth and produced by Scott Rudin, purports to be a social study of racial tensions straining under the weight of a highly publicized, hot-button tragedy. But this angle tends to remain relegated to the sidelines. Where the movie spares no bombast whatsoever is in the telling of the prurient — that is to say personal — story of the shifty stigmata lady and her missing child. Brenda Martin (Moore) claims she has been carjacked, but it takes her 10 minutes to spill the full bag of beans: Her 4-year-old son was asleep in the back seat of the Honda.
 
  We're meant to think — as does Lorenzo Council (Jackson), the detective assigned to the case — that there's something not quite right about Brenda. She lives in nearby, predominantly white Gannon, N.J., where her brother is on the police force, but she works as a nursery school teacher in the predominantly black housing projects of Dempsy, and she may be keeping quiet to protect someone. But, honestly, it's hard to think at all, because suddenly the soundtrack is pounding, the camera is spinning and Council is having a hysteria-induced asthma attack. When a nurse bounds into the room to give him a shot of adrenaline, you think, please, that's the last thing this guy needs.
 
  Within moments, the stuff is coursing through the veins of the narrative. Brenda describes her assailant as a young black man, and the Gannon police seal off the Dempsy projects until the residents turn the perpetrator in. Price's novel was published in 1998, and the story feels very much attuned to that particular time. "We're gonna shut the place down like it's East [bleep] Berlin!" Brenda's brother announces. He also wants to know: Is Council "working or protecting [his] own?"
 
  Possibly neither. Assigned to Brenda, Council spends a considerable amount of time indulging her, and generally acting less like Philip Marlowe than like Dr. Phil. ("I tell ya, 22 years of policing in this city, makes it hard to have faith in humanity," he tells her at one point, before suggesting she "let go and let God.")
 
  As tensions in the projects rise, and Brenda continues to hide something, Council finally agrees to accept the help of Karen Collucci (Edie Falco), an activist who organizes hunts for missing children. (The title of the movie refers to an abandoned asylum for foundlings, where the boy may have been left.) As a fellow mother of an abducted child, Karen knows the way to a mother's heart is through her overwhelming guilt, justified or not, at wanting to retain a modicum of personal freedom after motherhood. To which Hollywood says, "Bad mommy!"
 
 'Freedomland'
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for language and some violent content   

Freedomland , a dying-to-be-cathartic drama of American racial turmoil, lets us know from the outset that we're in for a heady dose of social studies. An adaptation of Richard Price's 1998 novel (Price wrote the script himself), directed by the earnest rather than inspired Joe Roth, it's set in and around a New Jersey public housing project, and it starts by hitting us with bulletins from a war zone: a candlelight vigil for missing children, Julianne Moore slamming into the emergency room with blood  literally  on her hands. Samuel L. Jackson, in a gray goatee and fedora, surveys the gathering storm from his car, a detective smoldering with silent dismay. (How noble is this cop? His name is Lorenzo Council.) Veteran moviegoers won't be fooled: When Sam Jackson grows quiet, we're surely two scenes away from a high-voltage tantrum.
It takes a while to sort out the chaos, but once Freedomland  gets going, the movie comes down to the following pressure cooker: Brenda Martin (Moore), a woman on the verge of about three breakdowns at once, claims to be the victim of a carjacking. A large black man, she says, bullied her out of her vehicle and shoved her to the ground, her palms sliding ragged over a field of broken glass. The real crime, however, is that her 4-year-old son, Cody, was sleeping in the backseat. Is he now safe? Or even alive?
As a movie plot point, a lost or abducted child doesn't exactly suggest a lot of gray area. Kids are innocent; their attackers are bad. Period. The complication in Freedomland  arises out of Brenda's hysteria, which is so extreme that we doubt her story even before we've bought into it, and from the movie's dogged, booby-trapped demonstration of the sins of racism. Julianne Moore, pale and dissolute, with pink-rimmed eyes and stringy hair that falls into her face, does a scrupulous job of playing a forlorn, broken-down mother, a woman who claims so feverishly not to be a drug addict that we sit back and wait for the story of how she bottomed out on drugs. Shrieking, moaning, and crying, smashing her damaged hands on the wall (at times, Brenda is devoured by self-loathing), Moore doesn't just act. She goes on the attack, embracing the kind of lower-rung-of-the-middle-class role that actresses from Jodie Foster to Meryl Streep have long savored. Her performance is an achievement of sorts, yet, like the movie itself, it's also strenuous and joyless.
As a novel, Freedomland  was a gloss on Price's vastly superior Clockers , and the movie, likewise, is a hokey and diagrammed affair, without Price's trademark verbal fireworks. It's thesis filmmaking masquerading as organic drama. The disappearance of Brenda's child becomes a media event, as the Jersey cops, setting up a vast phalanx of sawhorses, flood the neighborhood with their blue-uniformed presence, putting the Armstrong housing projects in lockdown. Assuming that the attacker must have come from the projects, the cops distribute the usual sketch  of an anonymous, threatening black face in a Una-bomber hood. That face becomes the film's emblem of injustice.
The obsession with a missing white child, in a world where countless missing black children go unremarked upon, has too many topical resonances to count (most recently, it carries an overtone of the Aruba case), yet there's a half-baked quality to Freedomland 's outrage. The film, for all its huffing and puffing, doesn't allow a single person in the projects to become a fleshed-out character. The full weight of black anger and sorrow is carried by Jackson's cop, who's the sole link between the Armstrong residents and their police aggressors. As he takes Brenda under his wing, protecting her, almost coddling her, trying to pry out the truth of what happened, Jackson makes Council a torn and tortured soul, with a dicey legacy of his own (he has a son in jail). Yet the man's gruff honor is never in doubt, and the movie gives him too many lines like ''The more you try to know, the more mysterious life gets.'' Roth, at times, directs like a caricature of a Hollywood liberal, as when he stages the climactic race riot with an angelic choir on the soundtrack. (The real message: It makes him feel good.)
Freedomland , with its showy compassion for ''the children,'' its meticulous slides from despair to hope and back again, is a movie that appears to have been made in the shadow of Crash . It has a similar didactic idealism, the view that if you scratch a bigot, you'll find a saint. In the end, there's something distressingly too easy about that. Watchable as it is, Freedomland  comes to very little, because it keeps showing you the seams of its good intentions.

 Savvy moviegoers know that the early part of the year is when big studios turn much of the country's movie theaters into a dump; it's the big-studio equivalent of early spring cleaning or, if you're feeling less charitable because life can seem particularly short when the movies are so bad, throwing out the trash. This week's contribution to our national slag heap and an early candidate for worst film of the year is "Freedomland," an inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, based on his novel, about a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Lorenzo Council, a detective on the job in the projects when the call comes in. Along with his partner, Boyle (William Forsythe, always a sight for sore eyes), Lorenzo helps keep the peace in a tough neighborhood, where the white working-class town next door seems to pose as much of a threat as the usual social ills, if not more. Neither apparent saint nor evident sinner, Lorenzo soon proves himself a thoroughly lousy cop after he takes charge of a witness, Brenda Martin (Julianne Moore). Having wandered into a hospital at night, her hands slicked with blood, Brenda initially tells a story about being carjacked in the projects by a black man. Then she adds an explosive detail: her 4-year-old, Cody (Marlon Sherman),  was asleep in the back seat.  Boom! Lorenzo starts bellowing at Brenda and flailing for his asthma inhaler as the camera starts flopping around like a newly hooked trout. As inexplicable as it is inappropriate, Mr. Jackson's eardrum-rattling delivery can't help but bring to mind Dave Chappelle's lethally funny sendup of the actor's performance style in a phony beer commercial on "Chappelle's Show." In that bit, the comic plays Mr. Jackson dressed in old-fashioned garb à la Samuel Adams and madly engaged, at full roar, with getting restaurant patrons to drink his beer. "Can you stop yelling at me, please?" one customer pleads. "No, I can't stop yelling," the imitation Mr. Jackson replies between expletives. "Cause that's how I talk! You ain't never seen my movies?" Apparently, Mr. Roth has.  Mr. Jackson is certainly capable of doing better, as is Ms. Moore, who here delivers one of the few authentically awful performances of her career. Wildly miscast as a grammatically challenged former drug addict, the actress wanders through much of the movie in a blanked-out daze, pausing only to deliver a morsel of exposition and, in one scene, a soliloquy in which she explains how she ain't done nothing right in her life but had this kid.  It's no wonder that Mr. Price, who shows up for a brief cameo, looks embarrassed. There's more, including a severe-looking Edie Falco as part of a missing-child organization, some implausible dramatic turns and a handful of fine actors — including Aunjanue Ellis, Anthony Mackie and Clarke Peters — who all deserve permanent deliverance from the Hollywood ghetto.  "Freedomland" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is a fair amount of profanity and some violence.

Distilling a 500-plus-page book into feature length simply defeats "Freedomland," even though Richard Price adapted his own novel. Brimming with high ambitions but disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying, the film concerns the racially charged firestorm that erupts when a white child goes missing in a black neighborhood. With the exception of Julianne Moore's hollow-eyed performance as the wounded mother, however, the disparate threads fail to mesh in a meaningful way. Despite a few raw moments, pic feels like a Lifetime movie with a marquee cast, with box office prospects looking equally tepid.
Occupying the same New Jersey towns as Price's earlier novel-turned-film "Clockers," "Freedomland" evokes comparisons to the Susan Smith case but has undergone significant changes in its path to the screen, including the elimination of a reporter who figured prominently in the novel.
In a sense, the movie peaks with its atmospheric opening. In 1999, a bedraggled woman with bloodied palms, Brenda (Moore), stumbles into a hospital and claims to have been carjacked at the nearby housing projects. Yet only under questioning by a local police detective, Lorenzo (Samuel L. Jackson), does she reveal that her 4-year-old son was in the car.
News of the missing boy ignites an enormous furor in Gannon, a blue-collar, mostly white suburb adjacent to the projects. So the authorities descend on the projects, leaving Lorenzo caught between community leaders such as Reverend Longway ("The Wire's" Clarke Peters), outraged by the sudden attention to this carjacking case when crimes against black youths go unnoticed; and the police, whose confrontational members include Brenda's brother, Danny (Ron Eldard).
Lorenzo initially believes Brenda, telling his partner, "If this woman is faking it, she's in the wrong line of work." But he does a quick about-face, enlisting aid from a missing-child group, headed by a local activist (Edie Falco), to prove that Brenda isn't telling the truth.
In his latest foray as a director, Revolution principal Joe Roth has trouble juggling the elements of racial discord with the underlying mystery. This results in a chaotic, uneven pace, with the narrative beats difficult to connect.
Price, too, appears to have struggled to bring his book to cinematic life, indulging in lengthy speeches that, as inertly presented, feel better suited to a stage play.
The lone exception is a riveting monologue by Moore, who -- having waged a very different search for a lost kid not long ago in "The Forgotten" -- forgoes any hint of glamour to paint Brenda as a damaged wreck, teetering on the brink of collapse. Jackson, by contrast, is left with a role that doesn't rank among his top 10, and it's to his credit the thinly developed character is as watchable as he is.
Almost all of "Freedomland," in fact, operates in a kind of shorthand, devoting scant time to the barely capped rage seething in the projects or the dynamics between Brenda and her brother, who seems primed to explode. And while the media's preoccupation with white victims and black perps is obviously a part of this volatile mix, that fertile ground goes largely untilled.
James Newton Howard delivers an intense score, but pic is otherwise as drab in both look and tone as its environs, which, coupled with Falco's minor supporting role, remind us that "The Sopranos" was truly the best thing that ever happened to New Jersey.
