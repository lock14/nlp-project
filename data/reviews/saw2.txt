If you�ve ever wondered when the hell somebody�s going to get around to updating the eyeball scene from Bu�uel�s Un Chien Andalou
, then buddy, your time is nigh. "Oh yes, there will be blood," promises Saw II
�s tagline, and, for once, the tease is fulfilled � and then some. Saw II
 is a nasty piece of work, reveling as it does in outright sadism and dancing dangerously close to having no idea in its grimy head other than how best to mindfuck its characters into oblivion. At the latter it does a fine job, dispatching an octet of strangers, who have awoken imprisoned in the booby-trapped house of horrors of serial killer Jigsaw (Bell). Jigsaw�s modus operandi, carried over from the first film, is to awaken the nascent survival instinct in his prey, thereby making them better people as a whole. It�s something of a flawed bill of goods he�s selling, however, as his elaborate contrivances and befuddlements � some worthy of Frank Gorshin�s Riddler, some less so � continually net him not the finer specimens of humanity he allegedly seeks, but shell-shocked, thousand-yard starers and rat-food tartare. Somebody has to be the badass, of course, and in Saw II
 the vacancy is overfilled by Wahlberg�s morally bankrupt detective Eric Matthews, who busts his own son on a minor charge in the first reel and then spends the remainder of the movie attempting (via an impressive array of furrowed brows, spittle-flinging verbal harangues, and sundry bad-cop/worse-cop outbursts) to save him from the clutches of Jigsaw. Whether or not you�ll enjoy Saw II
 will have much to do with your enjoyment of the first film, although it�s no more a prerequisite than being a fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
 is for enjoying The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
. Like that gut-busting sequel, Saw II
 strives to overwhelm its audience through sheer overlapping horrors, and it succeeds to a large degree. There�s far more meat on these bones than on James Wan�s original film, and thus more to be flayed off, and director Bousman and returning screenwriter Leigh Whannell appear to be having some wicked good fun inventing ever more elaborate and Herculean tests for the characters. Led by Smith�s wiry ex-junkie, another holdover from Saw
, they scurry around trying to find egress like vermin on a sinking ship � and they�re about as sympathetic. And therein lies Saw II
�s problem: With nary a decent, connective character in sight, the film quickly becomes little more than a strenuous battle for survival among the already damned. Bousman�s direction is of the bleach-bypass, amphetamine-edit variety, making everyone in the picture appear as if they�ve already been dead a day or two from the get-go. To its credit, the film rockets toward its conclusion with scant downtime. It�s come and gone before you even know it, and, like death, that�s a good thing.


This is the story of eight strangers picked to live in a house, have their lives taped, and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start being real.
No, this is not another season of ''The Real World," it's the second installment of ''Saw." Indeed, a year after the debut of the first movie, ''Saw II" reunites us with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the cancer patient with the passive-aggressive approach to serial killing (his victims kill one another.) Here he's locked some folks in a big, dank, booby-trapped shelter, where he's left them clues and riddles they must follow and solve in order to survive his medieval tortures. Needless to say, ''Saw II" is not for the faint of heart. It's for the foolish of wallet.
The victims have something in common, although it takes forever for them to figure out what. They're given two hours. After that, the poison gas that's streaming out the air vents will have corroded their insides. So following instructions is crucial. The first victim disobeys that order about not unlocking a door and promptly has the back of his head blown out.
At one point, the film takes a break from the bloodletting inside the house to give us a police procedural. In the name of reality TV, Jigsaw and the cops watch the action on surveillance monitors. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective on the case and the estranged father of one of the contestants. He looks tired and mad as hell: Where is his son
? But those old-school, rogue-cop methods of his won't get him far with Jigsaw. As one SWAT commando remarks, the detective has ''to start thinking outside the box or his son's gonna be in one." Word.
This all makes for dreadful moviegoing, even on Halloween. It's not that the acting is bad -- except for Dina Meyer, as the other detective, and Frankie G, as one of the most annoying horror victims in the genre's history. It's that there's little fun in watching a girl fish for a key in a pit of hypodermic needles -- even if she used to be a junkie.
The first ''Saw" offered mounting existential dread: two strangers woke up in a foul washroom and had to hack each other up. It was Jean-Paul Sartre's ''No Exit" by way of the grindhouse. It wasn't good, but it occasionally delivered the visceral terror we want from a horror movie. The sequel sheds both philosophy and suspense.
Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell wrote ''Saw II," which Bousman directed. They aren't yet 30, and Whannell, who also wrote and acted in the first movie, looks particularly fresh-faced in his publicity photos. Accordingly, his movie is the product of immaturity. It approaches suffering with a meaninglessness that must be a luxury for anyone who has never lost anyone, or is incapable of empathizing with someone who has.


         Providing your standards aren't too high, "Saw II" is a worthy follow-up to its grisly predecessor. While most horror sequels are more like remakes, this one takes a different tack in continuing the first film's sadistic life-or-death gamesmanship in which a psycho named Jigsaw tortures those he sees as morally weak and unworthy of the gift of life. Placing them in elaborately engineered situations, Jigsaw tests how far his victims are willing to go to save their own lives.
 
  First-time feature director Darren Lynn Bousman (taking over for James Wan, now an executive producer) grabs the audience immediately by the lapels, opening with a twisted Buñuelian variation on one of the "tests" from the original "Saw." A police informant awakens to find himself almost naked aside from a steel-jawed death mask designed to spring shut, driving dozens of spikes into his skull, if he fails to unlock it in time. He is given a scalpel and a fairly strong hint about where on his body the key has been hidden.
 


         






    When police later discover the crime scene, there is a message scrawled on the ceiling: "Look closer Detective Mathews." Det. Eric Mathews, played by Donnie Wahlberg with the utmost of seriousness, is a burnout with a troubled teenage son, an ex-wife and a fetching ex-partner, Kerry (Dina Meyer), with whom he had a fling that ended his marriage, and he's been singled out for reasons that will become clear.
 
  Mathews and Kerry, abetted by a SWAT team, quickly close in and capture Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) in his booby-trapped industrial grunge lair, but that's just the start of the game. A set of computer monitors display video of a house where Jigsaw has sequestered eight moral miscreants, one of whom is Mathews' delinquent son, Daniel (Erik Knudson). The hostages have been exposed to sarin gas and the house is rigged with various torture devices designed to make their search for strategically hidden syringes of the antidote within the prescribed two hours difficult, to say the least. Franky G., Glenn Plummer and Beverley Mitchell (of "7th Heaven") are among the unlucky contestants, as well as Shawnee Smith, who returns as Amanda, the only person to previously survive an encounter with the puzzle master.
 
  The scenario plays out as a sinister reality-TV show or an overly pious science experiment. The film cuts back and forth from the lab rats' pursuit of the serum to the standoff between the cops and Mathews. Based on a script originally called "The Desperate" by Bousman that was rewritten by "Saw" screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who turned it into a sequel, the story is much more focused on an endgame than the original film. There are fewer credibility gaps and there are plenty of reversals to satisfy fans.
 
  Bousman is adept at moving the action along, but reveals his music-video roots with too much rapid-fire imagery at crucial moments and the School-of-David Fincher visuals that marked the first "Saw." Most annoying of all are the quick-cut replay flashbacks used to jog the audience's memory with each revelation, robbing us of the pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves.
 
  The big twist at the climax is a bit of a cheat and sets up another disclosure that blatantly lays the groundwork for "Saw III ... IV ... V," ad infinitum, but for the most part the film succeeds in producing a frightening Halloween weekend experience. The stars of this movie, as with the first, are the disgusting devices dreamed up by Jigsaw (and production designer David Hackl), and as long as there is a market for seeing those in action, the series will live on.

If you had only a few seconds to decide, would you cut your own eyeball out with a razor to save your face from getting squished in by a head-mounted, time-sensitive, bear-trap contraption made up of a hundred rusty nails? Neither would the poor fella in the first frazzled minutes of Saw II , a sequel that delivers another round of the kind of elaborate Rube Goldberg shocks that made the first movie a surprise hit last year. The contest is close, but Saw II  is just barely a better B flick than Saw . It wins by a hair wire thinner than the one that trips the blades that slice off a blindsided SWAT guy's feet.
The killer of the series remains Jigsaw, a sicko with engineering capabilities limited only by how far the new set of screenwriters is willing to beggar belief. In the first film, he was mostly unseen, represented by a bulbous, papier-mâché-type puppet with red swirlies painted on its cheeks  that is, until a last-second reveal that felt like one of the biggest ''whatever!'' gyps in surprise-ending cinema. This time the puppet cameos early on and then kindly takes a powder. As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II 's sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair. Jigsaw's grand plan involves sticking eight people in a cavernous, dilapidated old house and having them kill, scream, and reason their way out of his booby traps as if this were a hard-edged sequel to The Goonies . In the meantime, Jig volleys face-to-face with a conflicted cop whose teen son is among those lost in the deadly fun house. The cop is played by Donnie Wahlberg, who's overshadowed by Bell, but it's Jigsaw's franchise, so that's probably the point.
Where Saw II  lags behind in Saw 's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job of it than the original's cheat finish. Yet the nagging thing about both movies is that they're more clever and revolting  first hitting on the nervy idea of an open grave of a thousand syringes, for example, and then chucking a character down into it so we can watch her writhe  than they are actually chilling.


Cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't enough to get "Saw II" out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor. The notion of victims killing themselves while trying to get free from traps set by an evil genius took "Saw" beyond cult hit status to $100 million in worldwide B.O., but new pic lets the air out by divulging the startling mystery that concluded the original. Add this to problematic juggling of police procedural and group-in-distress storylines, and Lions Gate has what looks like a sequel rushed for Halloween. Nonetheless, fans will pile in and come back for more, followed by killer ancillary biz. 
Pre-title shocker sets the table, with a police informer (Noam Jenkins) trapped in a grungy room with a venus-flytrap-type metal device locked around his neck and the key to open it lodged behind one of his eye sockets. Nasty results cue that this will be, as pic's promotion insists, bloodier than before.
Knowing the trademark of master sadist Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) immediately recognizes his handiwork when she surveys the informant's horrific demise, and warns her partner Eric (Donnie Wahlberg).
As Kerry and Eric, along with the S.W.A.T. team, track Jigsaw down to his lab in a factory -- while stumbling onto one of his patented torture-tripwire devices along the way--they think the case is wrapped up. But they find a new dilemma: On a lab video console, the cops can see that nine people -- including Eric's son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) -- are trapped together in a room. The jig is far from up for Jigsaw.
While "Saw" dropped viewers into a puzzling setting that the chained victims gradually made sense of through flashbacks, "Saw II" strides down what appears to be a straight narrative line, but is nevertheless bogged down in various genre traps of its own.
On one end, the interrogation of the cancer-ridden but devious Jigsaw grows surprisingly tiresome as Eric's rage as a father is played in distressingly one-note fashion by Wahlberg.
On the other, the victims turn out to be a bunch of screamers and hagglers who are barely distinguishable from one another, led by the dull machismo of drug dealer Xavier (Freddy G) and the smarts of Amanda (Shawnee Smith), back for more torture after she escaped a bear-trap in previous pic.
Bell, afforded here a far larger speaking role than in the first pic, suggests in his deep, scratchy voice, bird-like visage and piercing eyes what his version of Hannibal Lecter could be. He even builds up some sympathy for his madman, but this is delivered by way of a time-consuming backstory. What was delectably mysterious in "Saw" is now made literal, and the revelations aren't terribly intriguing.
Eric's lesson, it appears, is that he must pay for planting evidence and being a bad dad, but it all seems a tad out of proportion. Under first-timer Darren Lynn Bousman's direction, the pace slackens during an overlong chase scene, lessening the impact of what was meant to be a stunner of a closing twist. Ending images make no doubt that a new set of "Saws" will be rolling off of the assembly line.
Original key crew is intact, giving pic an entirely consistent look and sound, distinguished by lenser David A. Armstrong's talent for flat overhead light that eliminates shadows. In a case of what looks like a jumpy trigger finger at the Avid, editor Kevin Greutert's cutting is frantic to a completely distracting level.

The MPAA  rejected the original poster for Saw II , an image of two severed fingers. The producers were permitted to keep their grimy digits, but with the stumped ends concealed beyond the frame. Put aside the temptation to read an allegory of a studio's determination to leave its meddling fingerprints on a project on at any cost. What's worth noting is how much greater deliberation was given to the marketing than the screenplay of this cursory dud, rushed to theaters exactly a year after its amusing predecessor. Saw II represents Hollywood 's latest calculus, not that different from the old math, which holds that the coveted teen audience can be bought for as little as a flimsy horror sequel or remake (House of Wax , The Fog ) lacquered in a cast plucked from the WB. This time, criminal mastermind Jigsaw imprisons his victims inside a labyrinthine house furnished with lethal booby traps and the Tokyo subway neurotoxin. In the hackneyed role of the shady cop whose delinquent son is one of the captives, former NKOTBer Donnie Wahlberg  is simply hypnotic. Though he shares his more talented younger brother's face and something of his runt charisma, in those pouched, sallow eyes the disappointment of living in Marky Mark 's shadow flares.
