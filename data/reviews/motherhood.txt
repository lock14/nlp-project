Whenever a movie requires Uma Thurman to wear glasses, it’s reasonable to think she’ll turn into someone else. Once, in a “Batman’’ movie, she actually did. She’s bespectacled again for “Motherhood,’’ and it saddens me to report that neither she nor this comedy turns into more than an argument against procreation.
Thurman plays Eliza Welch, the harried sort of woman who doesn’t realize that her stroller just ran you off the sidewalk. You’ve stood behind her at the coffee shop as the cellphone conversation she’s having blasts the entire store. She’s told you off for calling her “ma’am’’ or looked down her nose at you for, say, “just’’ being a roofer. I wish I were kidding when I tell you that Eliza has a blog called the Bjorn Identity (so named for the best-selling yuppie baby sling) and that she pollutes it with thoughts like, “Must a woman’s soul die because she’s a mommy?’’ But I’m not.
Most of the movie involves the day Eliza spends planning for her daughter’s sixth birthday party and her attempt to write a 500-word essay explaining what motherhood means to her. (For Highlights?) She lives on a block in New York’s West Village that a film crew (another one) has taken over. Her car gets towed. The baker misspells her daughter’s name. A bike courier/playwright admires the “poetical’’ view from her apartment. She retrieves the car then drives it to New Jersey in a tearful rage brought on by the frankness of the comments her husband (Anthony Edwards) makes while editing her essay. “What are you trying to say?’’ he asks.
Katherine Dieckmann wrote and directed “Motherhood,’’ and at the risk of incurring her rage: What is
 she trying to say? She’s made this movie in the spunky, pseudo-funky style of commercials for yogurt and fabric softener (cutely managed chaos, a tagline for every scene, relentless preciousness). Its hours-before-the-party chaos is like a version of “Mrs. Dalloway’’ that should air between a new episode of “Army Wives’’ and the network premiere of “Sorority Wars.’’
The movie intends to satirize the combination of self-righteous entitlement and guilty sense of oppression certain bourgeois women have about motherhood. Every time it looks like Eliza might have a moment of real clarity, Dieckmann manages to present a character slightly more obnoxious just to keep her heroine likable (nice try). Even the young man who calls her a liberal hypocrite is unbearable.
There is one good scene that captures the silliness of parental playground vanity (“Jodie Foster alert!,’’ one mommy blurts out). And Minnie Driver has wisely been cast as Eliza’s pregnant British pal; she twists all her lines so that they sound either dirty or disposable.
You can see the movie wants to comment on all the frustrations of urban motherhood, but it does so only shallowly. How did having children kill Eliza’s “fiercely lyrical’’ fiction career? The movie isn’t that political or reflective. Instead, trendlets are name-checked (“momoirs’’ and mom jeans) and scenarios merely sketched, like how to walk the dog, carry a baby, curse out a driver, and move your car all at the same time. Eliza has no idea her life and the writing it inspires are cliches. Her production of offspring is none of my business. Reproducing her thoughts is another matter. She’d be the ideal test subject for a blog-control pill.

Scratch this one off the to-do list

Uma Thurman's beleaguered West Village mom is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day in "Motherhood" -- and it's no picnic for us, either. Whiny and self-involved, Thurman's mother of two sees judgment around every corner and believes the universe has conspired against her because the bakery misspelled her daughter's name on a birthday cake. Meanwhile, she can't get in touch with her long-suffering husband (Anthony Edwards), believing he has intentionally silenced his cellphone.

Gee . . . you think?

Katherine Dieckmann's canonization comedy aims to depict the jingle-jangle jumble facing smart women in the early 21st century, mothers trying to hold on to some semblance of self-identity as they plow through yard-long to-do lists.

But Eliza's (Thurman) 24-hour journey invites the kind of judgment it condemns, presenting its character's "plight" with a self-important insularity that will genuinely offend women who don't have two adjoining apartments, loving husbands with flexible schedules and the ability to indulge in midday shopping sprees.

We see Eliza mightily multi-task her way through planning her daughter's sixth birthday party (are goody bags really that imposing?) and find the time to write a 500-word essay on motherhood.

Eliza is also a blogger, which means Thurman spends much of the movie in voice-over mode, prattling on while betraying the trust of a friend (poor Minnie Driver), failing to pick up after her incontinent dog and making you wish that movies, like cellphones, could be silenced.

 "Motherhood." 
MPAA rating: PG-13 for language, sexual references and a brief drug comment. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In selected theaters. 

Director Katherine Dieckmann's comedy is about the messy everyday hysteria that too many odes to parenthood leave out. As Eliza, a former bohemian trying to hold on to her ''creative'' side even as she's become a frazzled mother of two, Uma Thurman turns every task  shopping for a birthday party, retaining a parking space  into an operatic fit of neurosis. She's quite funny, but her performance is at once winning and overstated. Parenthood  seems only half aware of Eliza's real  problem: that she thinks she's superior to the choices she's made.


 Watching “Motherhood,” in which Uma Thurman plays a Manhattan mom juggling kids, dog, marriage and blogging duties, I could not help but recall some of the many distinguished literary explorations of similar predicaments: “A Room of One’s Own,” by Virginia Woolf; Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “Yellow Wallpaper”; the poems of Sylvia Plath and Adrienne Rich; and especially the short stories of Grace Paley, set in the same West Village streets through which Ms. Thurman’s character, Eliza Welch, steers her Volvo and schleps her stroller.  It would be nice to be able to place “Motherhood,” written and directed by Katherine Dieckmann, in such exalted company. Unfortunately the reason it may remind you of other books and films is that you’ll  need something to occupy your thoughts while watching. “Motherhood” seems to suffer from its heroine’s tendency toward distraction.  Eliza is scattered, ambivalent, flaky and inconsistent — all of which is fine, and energetically conveyed by Ms. Thurman. But what are tolerable quirks in a person can be deadly to a narrative, and Ms. Dieckmann, trying for observational nuance, descends into trivia and wishful thinking.  At first things seem to promise otherwise. In a lovely opening sequence Eliza wakes up in the pale morning light and the silence of a sleeping household. She makes coffee and checks her to-do list, a motley assortment of child-care and domestic tasks punctuated by the word — more a plea than an imperative — blog. Eliza, who we later learn was once a promising writer of literary fiction, now compiles her maternal thoughts on the Internet.  Her site is called the Bjorn Identity, playing on a popular brand of infant-carrier, and that labored, nonsensical pun — wasn’t there a mattress store on Seinfeld called the Lumbar Yard? — is unfortunately typical of both Eliza’s writing and Ms. Dieckmann’s. The dialogue creaks with self-consciousness, and its insights have the tinny ring of greeting-card sentiments rendered in air quotes.  Eliza has an absent-minded, bookish husband (Anthony Edwards), a toddler son and an almost-6-year-old daughter, whose birthday party will be the denouement of a long and hectic day. In the meantime there are party supplies and a cake to pick up and a smattering of urban-parent rituals to attend to. The car must be moved for alternate-side parking. A furtive cigarette or two needs to be smoked. A friend (Minnie Driver, always welcome) is available for shopping and the sharing of confidences. And of course there is a city full of other mothers, who are not sisters so much as rivals in a ruthlessly competitive enterprise that makes the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange look like a tea party.  There is the aggressive playground helicopter, swooping in to take offense when Eliza says something to her belligerent little darling. There is the emo-eco-extremist, obsessively monitoring her child’s food and feelings. There is the snooty French neighbor, who cloaks her disapproval for Eliza’s bohemian disorder in tones of pity and admiration. All of them think they are better than Eliza, and of course she returns the favor. Eliza may radiate flaky entitlement, but she also is, in the movie’s fuzzy terms and in her own muddled mind, a model of authenticity and sensitivity in a cold, phony world.  So you have to root for her to make it through the day and find some measure of equanimity in her messy, unbalanced life. And of course you do — Ms. Thurman is impossible to dislike — but without really believing in that life or feeling as if you’ve learned anything about what is really at stake. The humor is soft, the dramas are small, and the movie stumbles from loose and scruffy naturalism to sitcom tidiness.  Throughout her day Eliza is trying to write a 500-word essay — it’s for a too-good-to-be true contest sponsored by a parent magazine — about what motherhood means to her. She may have some trenchant thoughts on the subject, but “Motherhood” itself has shockingly little to say.  “Motherhood” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and adult behavior.

Though pregnant with possibility, "Motherhood" fails to deliver. As a sleepless, serially blogging, financially strapped, generally embittered Manhattan mom of two, Uma Thurman looks convincingly frumpy. But a would-be comedic script by director Katherine Dieckmann ("Diggers") forces the star to spout such geysers of self-pity, you'd think motherhood in the West Village was akin to, say, motherhood in Eastern Congo. World preem at Sundance went over like a lead balloon among viewers who laughed more at pic's implausibilities than at jokes per se. Name actors will ensure adoption of this fussy baby by smallscreen folks, but other pickups seem iffy.
Street parking, dog poop, a distracted hubby (miscast Anthony Edwards) and location shooting on her block drive Eliza (Thurman) around the bend, though a shopping spree with pal Sheila (Minnie Driver) and an extended in-home visit from a hunky young messenger (Javier Picayo), who admires the "poetical" view from her walkup, provide momentary relief.
Eliza, whose mommy-blog is called "The Bjorn Identity," describes herself as a former writer for weekly papers that "aren't the same anymore" (Dieckmann wrote film reviews for the Village Voice). Regretting that her classist blogs address only the smallest percentage of the population, Eliza provides a sharp critique of motherhood -- though the pic's title sounds much too universal for the relative hardships onscreen.
The film's off-putting sense of humor has Jodie Foster, playing herself in a cameo, cursing at paparazzi, and Eliza musing about the "benefits of 9/11" when it comes to cell-phone coverage. Near the end of a lean 89 minutes, Eliza learns to feel fortunate, but by then, audience empathy is scarce to nonexistent.
Sporting rumpled clothes, unkempt brown hair and the eyeglasses of yesteryear, Thurman appears in every scene, which is less advantageous to the star than it may sound. Halfway through, Driver's Sheila briefly takes centerstage, getting angry that Eliza blogged about Sheila's illicit bathtub pleasure with a kid's toy. By default, the cast's strongest impression is made by 80-year-old Alice Drummond (the spooked librarian in the first scene of "Ghostbusters") as Eliza's forgivably needy neighbor.
Shooting by Nancy Schreiber is sitcom-bright; real-life West Village residents are thanked in the end credits for their "patience."

Casting against type is one thing, but putting Uma Thurman —an unheralded character actress; the more extraordinary the character, the better—in the role of an unkempt New York City mom goes against the cinematic gods. And the gods are angry at Motherhood , writer/director Katherine Dieckmann 's ode to the trials of Manhattan's downwardly mobile, breeding bourgeoisie. Uma, in a scruffy brown wig and dingy housedress, has been cursed with a mannered "comic" performance and that funky, flutey elocution she uses when she's trying to speak like a real person. Thurman plays Eliza, the mother of two young children and wife of a hapless editor (Anthony Edwards ). Together, they live the kind of shabby-groovy life—ruled by pre-school pickups and parking shenanigans—familiar to half of Brooklyn . Dieckmann nails the look of a certain niche of urban neo-middle-class living, but the film's hyper-earnest tone and reliance on "day-from-hell" New York clichés overwhelm those details. Eliza, formerly known for her "fiercely lyrical fiction," wants to win a mommy blog contest because "nobody talks about this stuff." Alas, the deadline for the contest looms as several major dramas unfold, including the organizing of a kiddie birthday party and Eliza's swift, bloggy betrayal of a fellow mom's confidence about using her son's bath toy as a dildo.
