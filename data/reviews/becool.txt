Waiting a decade before trotting out a sequel to a hit film is relatively rare and usually bodes desperation on somebody�s part, but this star-packed sequel to Barry Sonnenfeld�s Get Shorty
 (1995) manages � just � to steer clear of the usual creative mismanagement by sheer dint of its packed-to-the-rafters script, courtesy of Peter Steinfeld (working from the novel by the always reliable Elmore Leonard). Director Gray (The Italian Job)
 and Steinfeld toss in everything, and then pile on more and yet more improbable plot devices until something, anything
, sticks and gets a laugh. As the film opens, Travolta�s ex-Brooklyn enforcer Chili Palmer is sick to death of the film business he embraced in Get Shorty
. He�d much rather be in the far more congenial music biz and gets his chance when pal Tommy Athens (James Woods in a brief cameo) is gunned down by the Russian Mafia, leaving his star diva-to-be (Milian) in the lurch. Taking her under his raven�s wing, Palmer hooks up with Athens� ex, Edie (Thurman), while dodging unscrupulous scam-masters at every turn. It�s a kick to see Travolta and Thurman tearing up the dance floor once more, but you could make a case that the former Vincent Vega is playing it a tad too
 cool here; half the time he appears positively glacial, more weary than hip, more hip than hop. Such is not the case with Cedric the Entertainer�s bombastic parody of Death Row Records hardcase Suge Knight: Aided and abetted by no less than Andr� "3000" Benjamin of Outkast, he simultaneously inflates and deflates the rap mogul�s tarnished legend. Most winning, bizarrely, is the Rock as a wannabe rapper, chauffeur-cum-strong arm, and vainglorious gay man desperate to make it big in the movies. He�s the most human of all the parodies here (and that�s saying a lot considering virtually every single character is a parody of someone or something). It�s a messy, overlong film, but it�s impossible to take seriously and therefore more than a little entertaining.


Despite its title, there's nothing cool about F. Gary Gray's adaptation of novelist Elmore Leonard's punch-drunk music-biz satire, ''Be Cool."
The book was published in 1999, and what was keenly ridiculous in print seems clueless and uncouth onscreen now. Gray embraces the inanities Leonard seemed to be lampooning.
The movie offers a Los Angeles where a band of gun-toting would-be gangsta rappers in throwback jerseys are led by a Wharton School graduate; where a white Jewish man thinks he's a black pimp; and where Aerosmith is the key to a rising young pop star's success.
Barely any of it is funny, and if a minute of it is meant in mockery, few of the darts ever find the board.
''Be Cool" is the sequel to Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 ''Get Shorty," which was also a vehicle for John Travolta. The decade that's passed between the two movies feels like a lifetime, with each picture filling opposing seats on a career seesaw.
In ''Get Shorty," Travolta was at the height of his great comeback, untouchable and suavely comic. In reprising his role as the Brooklyn-raised loan shark turned Hollywood operator Chili Palmer, the actor returns to a more confident version of himself. The ham he's become of late is now a leaner, tanner, less laughable presence.
For a change, the problems with a lame John Travolta movie do not originate with Travolta. They're more the fault of Peter Steinfeld's watery adaptation and Gray's uncertain direction.
The film's plot picks up with Chili having hit it big as a Hollywood movie producer. When his garrulous record-business buddy Tommy (James Woods) is gunned down, Chili finds himself trying to simultaneously solve the case, rescue Tommy's production studio, woo Tommy's gorgeous wife Edie (Uma Thurman), a producer and former Aerosmith groupie, and launch the career of a pop singer named Linda Moon (Christina Milian) by attempting to buy her out of her contract to a dubious management company goon (Harvey Keitel).
Wait, there's more: racist Russian mobsters; that pimp (Vince Vaughn); his gay, aspiring-actor bodyguard (Dwayne ''The Rock" Johnson); those armed gangsta rappers; Debi Mazar as a cop with hair that begins as a pompadour and ends in a mullet; and the Wharton grad/remix producer (Cedric the Entertainer), who wants Edie to pay him money Tommy owed him.
They all have an eye on Chili, and in the novel the fight to get his attention made for a breezy good time. Here it's just desperate.
''Be Cool" so wants to be a collection of mini-showcases for actors such as the sporadically funny Vaughn and Johnson, who gamely toys with his image, playing the semi-manly sort of giant he made fun of back in his pro-wrestling days. Meanwhile, OutKast's Andre Benjamin plays one of the gangsta rappers, the one who's never shot a gun.
Gray can't get much traction with any satire of these people, this town, or the music business. He makes you long for Sonnenfeld's visual wit and seamless blend of suspense and delicately wrought comedy.
''Get Shorty" was released a few months after Gray's easygoing porchbound comedy ''Friday," which had only a handful of characters and low-key energy. Gray now seems indifferent to such patient style. He's more comfortable muscling his way through action sequences in a movie like ''The Italian Job." For him, the joke in ''Be Cool" is not on the page, it's in the casting, and that turns laborious fast.
The movie is also leaded with allusions to other films, with its most blatant thefts coming from ''Pulp Fiction." Cedric has a moment of ''furious anger" akin to Samuel L. Jackson's in Quentin Tarantino's movie. Maybe Cedric's speech about black culture's influence on the world would ring truer were he not steering a posse of black-male stereotypes.
Another borrowed passage features Travolta and Thurman having chit-chat at a table in a nightclub, before busting some wiggly moves on the dance floor just as they did 11 years ago. The smoky Chuck Berry song they originally twisted to has been replaced with the unseasoned hip-hop of the Black Eyed Peas. It's a moment so lifeless and sexless and sad that it feels less like an homage and more like a Visa commercial. That's not entertainment, it's rechewed gum.
''Be Cool" is too lazy to earn its comedy and too self-amused to make any points about music or its industry. You pity Chili and Edie because their determination to make Linda famous speaks to their terrible taste and, by extension, the movie's. The whole thing is so passé it deserves to win a Grammy.


         Ten years ago, the amusing "Get Shorty," based on the Elmore Leonard novel, introduced John Travolta as Chili Palmer, a Miami loan shark and movie fan, who on a trip to L.A. became convinced the motion picture business was a snap compared to wheeling and dealing in the underworld. Palmer is back in "Be Cool," and although Travolta is as smooth as ever, the picture is a bust, a grimly unfunny comedy with no connection to reality, and worst of all, running on and on for two dismal hours.
 
  Adapted by Peter Steinfeld from Leonard's sequel novel of the same name, "Be Cool" is actually hopelessly square — depressingly, Leonard is one of the film's executive producers. Director F. Gary Gray, who did a bang-up job with "The Italian Job" remake, is torpedoed here by rotten material.
 


         






    This time Chili, ever the sleek man in black, delves into the music business. On the one hand, his old pal Tommy Athens (James Woods) is rubbed out in a drive-by as he pitches his story of success in the recording industry, and on the other, Chili, a gentleman at heart, rescues up-and-coming singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian) from her bullying manager Raji (Vince Vaughn), who struggles to talk like a gangsta. Pretty soon Chili is also coming to the rescue of Athens' widow and business partner (Uma Thurman), whose company is in trouble and is being menaced by a music producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and his many minions. Chili lines Moon up with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler (who plays himself and is not a pretty sight in close-ups) to perform as the band's opening act. Things quickly become complicated and tedious, with the Russian Mafia and the snarly head of a talent management company (Harvey Keitel) also getting into the act.
 
  The precious few tidbits of humor are courtesy of the Rock, who plays Raji's main thug, a gay man who aspires to stardom in any way he can. The Rock is clearly a good sport, and his antics, while tame, are positively a laugh riot alongside more typical moments, such as Danny DeVito, returning as director Martin Weir and announcing he's going to cast himself as Johnny Cash in a film bio or engaging in a kissing contest with Anna Nicole Smith.

Prevailed upon, back in the day, to explain rhythm, the legendary jazzman Thomas ''Fats'' Waller is reputed to have said, ''Lady, if you got to ask, you ain't got it.'' I offer this great moment in musicology in an attempt to distinguish between what's hip and what ain't in Be Cool , a winded, hardworking sequel to Barry Sonnenfeld's nifty no-sweat 1995 comedy, Get Shorty . That earlier all-star tap dance on the fault line between low-life crime and high-concept Hollywood, you'll recall, was a post–Pulp Fiction  career gift to John Travolta, and he took full advantage of the role of swingin' shylock Chili Palmer, the literary creation of L.A.-steeped genre master Elmore Leonard (via a cool screenplay by Scott Frank). Back then, Chili was a mobster–turned–movie mogul with an instinct for both rackets. Now he's getting into L.A.'s dog-eat-dog music biz.
But it's been a decade, baby, and times  not to mention the measure of how hard a studio movie's gotta work to wow the room and earn back the above-the-line expenditure  have changed. Within the first few minutes, Chili (Travolta again, his tempo of laid-back, street-smart savoir faire now a strangely charming anachronism) is engaged in a smirky rib-nudger of a conversation, about the tackiness of making sequels, with a soon-to-be-offed semi-sleazeball record producer named Tommy Athens (James Woods). And, see, there  right there  is where Be Cool  does not live up to the temperature of its title. Sequels, get it? We know this new, brand-name-heavy movie is a sequel; Travolta and Woods know that Chili and Tommy are characters in a sequel; we know that Travolta and Woods know that Chili and Tommy are in a sequel; and so on...right down the rabbit hole of self-congratulation and meta meaninglessness wherein one arrives at Ocean's Thirteen .
The hell of it is, Be Cool  is tepid entertainment that could be cool if it spent less time entertaining us as if we were demanding a definition of rhythm: This is a comedy that glorifies the ineffable ''it'' quality of those in the know, yet relies on brand-name cultural identifiers (Charlie Rose, the Viper Room, American Beauty ) and overexertions from its celebrity cast to drive home the joke that Chili's new racket makes use of old instincts. Mobs, movies, music  Chili's the dude, updated to the dawg.
On the plus side, the vibe between Travolta as Chili and Uma Thurman as Tommy's luscious widow, Edie, is as splendiferous as it was when the two gleaming stars boogied for Quentin Tarantino 11 years ago. Edie, a dishy blonde with an ear for talent, is the reason Chili gets mixed up  in the music scene at all, when he agrees to help her straighten out a business mess left behind by her dead husband, involving Russian mobsters and other assorted slime, including Harvey Keitel. There's also a wall of gangsta rappers in her way, fronted by a thug-life producer (Cedric the Entertainer, full of gusto), with hapless backup from a trigger-happy lieutenant played, with breakout charm, by OutKast's André Benjamin. Edie's discovery, Linda Moon (Christina Milian), is no great shakes, a petite song-belter from the American Idol school of generic vocal fluttering and butt twitching. But Chili's effect on Edie is a treat, culminating in a Pulp Fiction  dance-floor reprise, this time in a sexier, Brazilian mode. It works. (Thurman still emits the glow of her Kill Bill  triumphs, and she carries herself with joy.)
On the other side lie such hit-or-miss creations as Vince Vaughn's Raji (real name: Roger Lowenthal), a white music mini-mogul with hip-hop threads and a loonlike giggle who's only slightly more clued in than Ali G, and The Rock as Elliot, Raji's much-baited gay bodyguard who really wants to be an actor. The misses have less to do with the talents of Vaughn (a riot, a glorious goofball) or The Rock (who appears to be a charming man) than with the clod-footedness of the characters apparently devised, in Peter Steinfeld's script, primarily to amuse the hipster cast.  Be Cool  is directed by F. Gary Gray, who, for my money, can still dine out on the helium hilarity of his feature debut, Friday. But he appears to be stumped  by what to do with all the hepcats milling around. ''He just does the one eyebrow,'' someone says of Elliot, a cue for The Rock to do ''the one eyebrow'' so we can remember, Hey, it's The Rock. But by now, the trick is only lukewarm.

n "Be Cool," John Travolta returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 glibly entertaining adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel "Get Shorty." That  movie arrived in theaters hot on the heels of "Pulp Fiction," a film that in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while "Get Shorty" rode the "Pulp Fiction" craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank that distilled the original book to perfection, "Be Cool" is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. Directed by F. Gary Gray, a director with a clutch of tight thrillers to his name, notably "Set It Off" and the crackling remake of "The Italian Job," this new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay for "Be Cool" packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to "Get Shorty")  and far too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot. Having tried his hand at movie producing in the first story,  Chili  this time around  turns his attention to the music business, or more precisely, two of its hopefuls: a record producer, Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), and a young R&B singer, Linda Moon (Christina Milian). Complications and bad behavior ensue, most generated by various stereotypes sporting gold chains and attitude. The sole exception to this parade of unsavory types is a gay Samoan bodyguard, Elliot Wilhelm, played with great good humor by the Rock. Charming and unexpectedly funny, the Rock wears his muscles and his role lightly. Although the character is subjected to a number of crude gay epithets, none of which I recall from the novel, the Rock deflects their sting by making Elliot into a pussycat and stealing the show. Elliot looks like a stone-cold killer, but that isn't the part he yearns to play: he sings (his cover of Loretta Lynn's "You Ain't Woman Enough" is all heart and no ear), but what he really wants to do is act. His audition monologue for Chili is the only reason to recommend "Be Cool" when it shows up any minute now on DVD. Shortly after the movie opens, Edie loses her husband, a new status she greets with a lot of hard drinking and a series of black T-shirts emblazoned with the words mourning and widow. This is about as funny as the rest of the movie gets and as creatively ambitious. Like the novel, "Be Cool" is crammed with situations and characters, none of which inspire interest (among those overstaying their onscreen welcome are Harvey Keitel, Vince Vaughn and Cedric the Entertainer, outshone by the Rock and, in a minor role, Andr� Benjamin, a k a Andr� 3000 of OutKast). Like the characters, the scenes pile up but go nowhere; the story seems fragmented, the actors unmotivated, unmoored. Mr. Gray has a feel for pulp, but is seriously off his game here. Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, is the film's gravest disappointment. Conveying diffidence rather than cool, he registers more like a reluctant guest than a star; mostly, he doesn't register at all. Gone is the self-assured stride, with its animal heat and infectious rhythms, and gone too is the expansive sense of pleasure  Mr. Travolta  brings to his finest performances, as if he were delighted to be there and wanted us to be just as happy. Considering the pleasure Mr. Travolta has given filmgoers during his three-decade career, it is hard not to wish that the old studio system, with its factory routine and career controls, still existed. At 51, Mr. Travolta is too young to be recycling his greatest hits. This film is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has  strong language, sexual suggestiveness and violence.

Supreme hip crime fiction craftsman Elmore Leonard's droll humor, wry dialogue and waggish characters made their smoothest transitions to screen in "Jackie Brown," "Out of Sight" and "Get Shorty." Fronted -- hot on the heels of "Pulp Fiction" -- by a dazzlingly confident John Travolta, "Get Shorty," about an underworld shylock out to conquer Hollywood, oozed cool from every scene. Ten years later, Travolta drifts lazily through "Be Cool," a staggeringly flat sequel that trades filmdom for the music biz and could hardly be less cool. Reteaming of the star with Uma Thurman may pique interest but word of mouth looks to be ice cold.
Much as "Get Shorty" served up broad satire and farcical crime plotting that was unapologetically secondary to the foibles of its charismatic characters, director Barry Sonnenfeld and screenwriter Scott Frank displayed such an incisive feel for Leonard's keen wit and funky style that the movie seemed like Lubitsch compared to this clumsy misfire.
Having already driven a roadworthy comic vehicle into a ditch in "Analyze That," scripter Peter Steinfeld here delivers another witless sequel. It plays like protracted "Saturday Night Live" sketches glued onto a cheesy plot about hatching a singing star. And while director F. Gary Gray displayed real facility for the dynamics of breezy crime capers in "The Italian Job," he shows a tin ear for the rhythms of comedy in "Be Cool."
Opening with one of many glib insider jokes, Chili Palmer (Travolta) reveals his jadedness with studio sequels after scoring a hit as producer of "Get Leo" but a miss with "Get Lost." Intrigued by the music business, he finds an in when a Russian mobster ices his friend Tommy Athens (James Woods), a former Brooklyn thug now running indie label NTL (Nothing to Lose) Records.
Chili hooks up with Tommy's widow Edie (Thurman) to produce a debut album for talented singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian). That means busting Linda out of Chicks Intl., a '70s cover band managed by pimpy poseur Raji (Vince Vaughn). A white guy who likes to think he's black, Raji is all hip-hop attitude, bling-bling and vulgar designer-wear, a joke that wears thin almost instantly. Right behind it in comic durability is Raji's gay Samoan bodyguard Elliot (The Rock), a wannabe actor whose main talent is arching one eyebrow.
Chili blithely deals with obstacles created when Raji orders a hit on him, a sleazy music kingpin Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) tries to edge him out of the business and NTL star producer Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer) and his gangsta posse come calling for the $300,000 the label owes them. Driving a fleet of Hummers and tucking chunky gold pistols in their high-rise boxers and low-rise jeans, the latter group -- together with the black-dude attitudes of Raji and Nick -- pushes the comedy into tired homeboy satire.
Chili is a smooth player who defuses tricky situations with his unflappable cool. But he can't do anything but grin contentedly during the film's big climactic scenes, which are set during an Aerosmith concert and a music awards show, suggesting Steinfeld saw "The Bodyguard" way too many times. Thurman is reduced to beatific arm candy while Milian barely exists as a character beyond her standard-issue "American Idol" songs.
Although always based more on hipster chic than sexual sizzle, whatever chemistry Travolta and Thurman mined in "Pulp Fiction" has evaporated. Their dance to "Sexy," played onscreen by the Black Eyed Peas and Sergio Mendez, seems like a rote revisitation of their "You Never Can Tell" twist.
The cast glitters in isolated moments but mostly displays an understandable lack of conviction in the material. Even potentially amusing spiels like Sin's rant about black culture fall flat in the context of an under-energized comedy running two laborious hours, in which the timing is consistently off.
A number of well-known faces turn up briefly, including producer Danny DeVito, reprising his role as unlikely star Martin Weir, this time with Anna Nicole Smith as his trophy babe; Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, saddled with another of the pic's lame stabs at self-irony ("I'm not one of those singers who shows up in movies"); and an unbilled Seth Green as a video director. OutKast singer Andre Benjamin registers as a mildly promising comic presence in the first of his multiple film roles to hit theaters. Other music bizzers cameoing include Wyclef Jean, Fred Durst, Gene Simmons, Joe Perry and the RZA.
In a generally tidy but undistinguished package, Jeffrey L. Kimball's widescreen lensing brings a slick gloss to the Los Angeles locations, while John Powell's generic score and the standard mix of soul and hip-hop tracks are no match for the juicy jazz grooves penned by John Lurie for "Get Shorty."

At least the MGM marketers waited for Dutch Leonard  to write a Get Shorty  sequel before they green-lit a filmed onebut the wait may have cost them. Be Cool , being the further L.A. adventures in shylockiana of Chili Palmer, has a distinctively dated ambience; the first five minutes are distinguished by a slab of '80s-TV-show soundtrack, a visit to the Viper Room , a Carrot Top  joke, and a flailing cameo by James Woods  as a record producer who promptly, mercifully, gets popped by Russian gangsters. The smell of calamity is in the air. As we know from the bruises left by the worst dozen movies derived from this ever seductive master's books, a Leonard filmization depends wholly on the light dance step of the filmmaker in question. Surprisingly, Get Shorty 's Barry Sonnenfeld  demonstrated a soft shoe, but Be Cool 's F. Gary Gray  seems a clueless bystander, watching the new machine attempt to clone the earlier model's rhythms, gestures, and confidence, but never knowing which switches to flip.
But while Be Cool  is decidedly uncool, Elmore's DNA still runs through it. Palmer (John Travolta  again) decides, once Woods's slimeball is dead, that the music industry is something he'd like to try. He mixes up with the leggy widow (Uma Thurman ), an idiot wigger producer (Vince Vaughn ), his gay and relatively harmless bodyguard (The Rock), a zillionaire rap producer with a hard-charging posse of handgun-flourishing thugs (Cedric the Entertainer ), and eventually, Steven Tyler  as the lead singer of a deathless rock band named Aerosmith . The story is pretzely in a way that Leonard probably enjoys working out as he naps; suffice it to say that it's run amok with double betrayals and tropes lifted straight from Get Shorty . Unfortunately, it's all centered on a dull Beyoncé -wannabe up-and-comer (Christina Milian , whose albums are corporate-owned by Universal, oddly). Her mush-sob story about wanting to make it big lands in your hair early; throughout, Palmer and the other industry toughies gaze upon this warbling honey doll as if she were made of stardust. When she's placed in concert with Aerosmith, co-crooning "Cryin'," this semi-sardonic view of a mercenary industry be-comes itself a bit of a pandering hustle.
Travolta's Chili is still an underwhelming pleasure, and Gray knows enough to make a warm, post-Pulp Fiction  set piece out of a dancefloor hoochie-koo between Chili and Thurman's weathered industrialite. It's not as if the Leonard lines aren't there, it's only a matter of who can pick them up. The late Robert Pastorelli , as a cocky hit man eventually undone by fast eating, is terrifically New York funny. Vaughn's phlegmy hip-hop shtick has its moments, but only in relation to The Rock, who is Be Cool 's authentic revelation. As a naive, audition-seeking queernamed Elliot Wilhelm , no lessstuck being a gangsta because of his skin and size, Rock is brave, fully invested in his character, and with a wide-open face and foolish grin, outrageously funny. It's a singular performance achieved without condescension or camp. Who'd a-thunk it? In the end, as Elliot's happily hoofing it in an onstage Hawaiian dance routine straight out of Disney World , you can almost see Hollywood  scratch its head.
