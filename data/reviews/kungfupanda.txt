After years of skulking around in Hollywood�s shadows � writing anonymous Internet reviews, collecting Star Wars
 trading cards, leaking insider information about geopolitical subtext in Cloverfield
 � fan-boy culture finally has a movie hero to call its own. Po (Black) may be an animated panda bear, but make no mistake: Deep down, he�s really just a nerd with a pop-culture obsession. In Kung Fu Panda
�s opening scene (animated in a gorgeous, throwback, two-dimensional style that suggests both the work of Jamie Hewlett and Indonesian shadow-puppet theatre), Po imagines himself as a great martial-arts master teaming up with local heroes the Furious Five (featuring a monkey, tigress, viper, crane, and praying mantis) to defeat vast and evil armies. Of course, in reality (disappointingly three-dimensional, Pixar-like reality) Po is a master of nothing; he�s just the rotund son of a noodle-shop owner living in a small Chinese village who gets his kicks playing with action figures in his bedroom. Of course, that all changes when destiny drops him at the feet of kung-fu master Shifu (Hoffman), leading to the revelation that he�s actually a �dragon master� waiting to blossom and save his village from the vengeful tiger Tai Lung (Deadwood
�s McShane, who manages to go 88 minutes without uttering an obscenity, though I�d love to see the outtakes). But so what if Kung Fu Panda
�s message is timeworn and clich�d (believe in yourself, even if � especially if � you�re flabby and uncoordinated and no one else believes in you)? And so what if by the time this movie hits the DVD rack, all its CGI miracles will have been brushed aside by the next animated blockbuster? No criticism by me will matter one bit to the thousands of kids who will make up this movie�s howling, lunch-box-buying fan base. With a lovable, lumpy loser as its hero, the movie is just the kind of antic David vs. Goliath tale children can�t get enough of. At the screening I attended, there was a young boy in the audience who couldn�t contain his delight during the film�s climactic battle between Po and Tai Lung, in which the bear�s bowl-full-of-jelly midriff turns into an ineffable source of cosmic power. �He sat on him again!� the kid squealed over and over, as if the secret to a happy life is watching a cartoon bear plant his big backside on the head of a cartoon tiger at least twice a day. And who�s to say he�s wrong?


Animation is a kick, but plot doesn't rise to challenge
The star of "Kung Fu Panda" is not Jack Black.
It's not even Po, the martial arts-obsessed animated panda for whom Black provides dude-acious line readings. Rather, the movie's stars are production designer Raymond Zibach, art director Tang Heng, visual effects supervisor Markus Manninen, and the 4,000-processor Linux cluster at the heart of DreamWorks Animation's computer rendering farm.
Not exactly red-carpet names, but welcome to the modern family film - all form, no function. "Kung Fu Panda" is prototypical non-Pixar
 animated product as we've come to expect it: a lushly beautiful, even soulful, visual experience yoked to a pro forma story line that wouldn't fool a 3-year-old.
What the designers, processors, and workstation galley slaves have created is a phantasmagoric medieval Chinese otherworld - a Crayola-colored riff on the kung fu landscapes of countless Shaw Brothers movies with titles like "The New One-Armed Swordsman" and "Eight-Diagram Pole Fighter." Those originals and their ferocious near-camp sensibility have filtered into the American pop consciousness by way of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," Quentin Tarantino movies, and the Cartoon Network. Now they get their Happy Meal moment, slo-mo tiger leaps and all.
So familiar are the genre's cliches by now that bolting them onto the tired studio family-film framework - lots of character slapstick interspersed with believe-in-yourself moralizing - fails to enliven either. "The Forbidden Kingdom" has already come and gone this year, and "Kung Fu Panda" goes nowhere surprising even as its images unscroll handsomely before our eyes. The sound could go out in the theater, and you wouldn't ask for your money back.
Actually, that might count as an improvement, since you wouldn't have to deal with Black or the limp fortune-cookie aphorisms that tilt the film in the direction of yellowface ("There is no good or bad news. There is only news"). On the other hand, you wouldn't be able to hear Dustin Hoffman give his adenoids a workout as Master Shifu, the be-robed red panda who serves as this movie's Yoda. Hoffman's crafty honk is heard too rarely in movies these days, and we'll take it where we find it.
Black's Po is a bumbling, oversize bear who worships wuxia the way fanboys venerate Han Solo action figures. The son of a noodle shop owner (veteran character actor James Hong) who's a goose - the movie seems about to explain that one but then dodges - he crashes the ritual choosing of the Dragon Warrior and ends up with the honor himself.
This doesn't sit well with Master Shifu or the martial arts experts known as the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Monkey (Jackie Chan). The villainous Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from his fortress prison, though, and a stalwart hero is called for.
Cue the training montage, the humiliation of the bumbler by his betters, the search for self-respect, the final confrontation - "Kung Fu Panda" tours this highlight reel with the passion of a PowerPoint presentation. Black and Hoffman get most of the dialogue, with the rest of the players limited to a few lines each, but Black's neo-Ralph Kramden shtick wears thin fast. Where's the wit?
It's in the look of the thing; occasionally in its pacing, too. I'd swap the entire movie for the sequence in which Tai Lung escapes his dungeon, outmaneuvering the complacent rhino guards and swarms of arrows to clamber toward daylight. It owes too much to the Bridge of Khazad-d�m in "The Lord of the Rings," but no matter - the scene's alive with the thrill of craft. Same goes for a nighttime sequence in which the Furious Five leap and tumble over pagoda roofs; for a brief second you sense the fluidly beautiful kiddie action movie "Kung Fu Panda" might have been.
Notice that neither scene features the film's star. Without Black's participation, though, DreamWorks wouldn't know how to sell the movie and audiences wouldn't know what box to put it in (this was the marketing problem that vexed the vastly superior "Ratatouille"). "Kung Fu Panda" illustrates the dilemma CGI movies find themselves in: They're suspended on a rickety bridge between product and moviemaking, and the boards of our interest are beginning to rot away.


In Kung Fu Panda , Jack Black   is the voice of Po, a clown-eyed, sheepishly neurotic, roly-poly panda of no visible athletic ability who trains to become a lightning-limbed martial-arts master. Black gets off a few good lines (''Oooo, my tenders!'' he exclaims when Po is bashed in the crotch), but he doesn't make crazy full use of his wild side  the eager, riffing glee he has shown in films like School of Rock   . Instead, Black taps a quality that isn't so visible when he pops his eyes with mock ferocity on screen. He gives Po a slightly abashed suburban-couch-potato sweetness.
Po, who works in his father's noodle shop, dreams of kung fu glory, and it certainly seems preposterous that this lazy, soft-bodied bear would attain it. But after causing an accidental fireworks display in the Jade Palace, where the Furious Five  Tigress (Angelina Jolie  ), Crane (David Cross  ), Monkey (Jackie Chan  ), Viper (Lucy Liu  ), and Mantis (Seth Rogen  )  are showing off their twirly, whip-cracking moves, Po is decreed to be the Dragon Warrior, and he starts to train with the Furious Five. That's when Kung Fu Panda  ignites.
As Master Shifu, the group's Fu Manchu-mustached raccoon of a karate-kid guru, Dustin Hoffman  , his voice a-growl, has a wonderful persnickety surliness. It's as if Yoda were being played by Burt Lancaster. Po's total lack of skill is quite funny  he's such a flabby compendium of wrong moves that even his screwups have a bass-ackwards logic that is nearly balletic. But then Master Shifu figures out how to teach this hopeless case the art of kung fu. He uses a bowl of dumplings, which Po is so eager to eat that he'll scramble anywhere, at any speed, to get at them. Kung Fu Panda  is light and goofy, yet the fight scenes, which are the heart of the film, are lickety-split mad fun. Just about all animated movies teach you to Believe in Yourself (the rat who finds the courage to cook! The ogre who learns to love!), but the image of a face-stuffing panda-turned-yowling Bruce Lee dervish is as unlikely, and touching, an advertisement for that message as we've seen in quite some time.

 At once fuzzy-wuzzy and industrial strength, the tacky-sounding “Kung Fu Panda” is high concept with a heart. Even better, this animated feature from DreamWorks is so consistently diverting and visually arresting that it succeeds in transcending its storybook clichés. The tale has the consistency of baby pablum — it’s nutritious and easy on the gums — but there’s enough beauty and  pictorial wit here from opening to end credits, enough feeling for the art and for the freedom of animation, that you may not care.  The panda of the title is Po, a generously proportioned mound of roly-poly black-and-white fun voiced with gratifying restraint by Jack Black. You know the next turn in the road as well as any Disney-and-Pixar-weaned 7-year-old: Po is different, Po has a dream, Po has to struggle and so forth. Po also has a loving father, naturally (and no mother, predictably), a loosey-necked goosey,  Mr. Ping (James Hong), who runs a noodle shop that he hopes his son will take over one day. Po’s unlikely passion for kung fu intervenes, leading him out of the noodle shop and into the metaphoric hot pot, whereupon he kicks, grunts and groans toward his destiny amid the usual clutter of colorful sidekicks and one nasty foe (Ian McShane, grrr).  For an ostensible outsider, Po conforms very much to familiar animated-movie type. Like Nemo and the rest of his cartoon brethren, he needs to embark on the hero’s journey, which he does with help from a miscellany of pals voiced by the usual A-  and B-listers. Among those nudging and guiding Po is Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), an ancient turtle with a mellifluous voice and long, liquid neck   who, um, invented kung fu and now serves as the spiritual adviser (Yoda)  to an elite squad, including a kung fu master, the mustachioed red panda  Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), and his students, the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen).  The screenplay by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger is ho-hum without being insulting, a  grab bag of gentle jokes, sage lectures, helpful lessons and kicky fights. There is none of the self-conscious knowing that characterizes the Pixar factory,  which makes the whole thing seem either winningly innocent or terribly cynical, depending on your mood and worldview. I’ll go with innocent, at least on first viewing, because while “Kung Fu Panda” is certainly  very safe, its underlying sweetness feels more genuine than not. The Ayn Randesque bottom line of Pixar’s “Incredibles” can be difficult to argue with — namely, if everybody is special, no one is — but the heroic outsider has his own durable appeal, particularly if he’s a great big bouncing ball of fat and fuzz.  That outsider is even more irresistible when nestled amid so much lovingly created  animation, both computer generated and hand drawn. The main story, executed via 3-D animation (all done on computers) and directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne, fluidly integrates  gorgeous, impressionistic flourishes with the kind of hyper-real details one has come to expect from computer-generated imagery: photorealistically  textured stone steps, for instance, and fur so invitingly tactile you want to run your fingers through it. One of the pleasures of “Kung Fu Panda” is that instead of trying to mimic the entirety of the world as it exists, it uses the touch of the real. The character designs may be anatomically correct, but they’re cartoons from whisker to tail.  In the end, what charms the most about “Kung Fu Panda” is that it doesn’t feel as if it’s trying to be a live-action film. It’s an animation through and through, starting with the stunningly beautiful opening dream sequence, a graphically bold hand-drawn interlude rendered  by James Baxter  that looks like an animated woodblock print with slashes of black and swaths of oxblood red. This opener is so striking and so visually different from most mainstream American animations that it takes a while to settle into the more visually familiar look of the rest of the movie. And while nothing that comes afterward really compares to it, a volley of arrows that falls down like red rain and a delicate  swirl of pink petals come delightfully close.  “Kung Fu Panda” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). But not required.

How many underdog kidpic characters have been told "You just need to believe" in recent years? Whatever the ample number, add one more to the list with "Kung Fu Panda," a nice looking but heavily formulaic DreamWorks animation entry. The tale of a bumbling, pot-bellied, black-and-white bear who has greatness thrust upon him when anointed to protect his community, the vocally star-laden effort features an abundance of broad, buffoonish slapstick that will play perfectly well with kids to desired B.O. effect. But overall mild impact will likely prevent this from joining the top commercial tier of animated attractions.
In keeping with the Chinese setting, first-time directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne have gone out of their way to create some beautiful rural backgrounds for the simplistic foreground action, so there is always something to distract the eye (beginning with a clever Asian-style DreamWorks logo). But comic inspiration is distinctly lacking in Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's script, which delays the dufus' metamorphosis into hero for a full hour and largely feels structured to accommodate the maximum amount of action, much of which is intended to be funnier than it is.
For no reason other than the fact that he accidentally turns up at the right place at the right time, roly-poly Po (voiced rambunctiously or obnoxiously, per individual taste, by Jack Black) is identified by the ancient, Yoda-like turtle sage Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) as the long-awaited new Dragon Warrior. Said designation had been expected to go to one of the area's prodigious Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen), all martial arts virtuosos who trained under diminutive wolf Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman).
Whether or not Po is chosen because Oogway has become senile remains uncertain, but what does become clear is that Po, once he learns the Secret of the Dragon Scroll, will have to battle the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a kung fu master so resourceful he's able to escape from a mountain prison manned by 1,000 guards. Even he, however, isn't so much a villain as a creature rejected by the inscrutable Oogway, who long ago passed him over when he seemed the natural choice to become Dragon Warrior.
Even by moppet-defined standards, the situations, characters and motivations here are extremely elementary and lack nuance; other than Po and his prescribed transformation, none of the other figures reveal dimensions not fully evident at their initial appearances. Scripters are similarly unforthcoming with any dramatic surprises, making for a film in which the inevitable climax feels unduly postponed, the brief running time notwithstanding.
Pic comes to semi-inspired comic life in just one sequence, in which Po, who thinks he's mastered his kung fu technique, duels Shifu with chopsticks over some dumplings.
More serious action scenes, notably one of the Furious Five battling Tai Lung on a long suspension bridge and the climactic mano a mano, are ramped up in conventional fashion and backed by a booming score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell.
Filmmakers draw upon Asian art and animation styles, as well as mountainous geographic settings inspired by the Li River Valley, to create some splendid and unusually detailed widescreen CG images. Color is used carefully to pop dramatically at key moments, helping make the visuals the most sophisticated aspect of the otherwise mild accomplishment.
Aside from Black's overbearing readings, voiceover work ranges from solid to tasty, with the latter including Hoffman's sly shadings for the master teacher, McShane's injection of unexpected feeling into his impersonation of a scorned would-be champion and Kim's over-the-hill intimations for the past-his-prime sage. Star names for the Furious Five have relatively few vocal opportunities to shine. 



By all means, gather up the little ones and take them to this perfectly pleasant, very good-looking, modestly funny, dispiritingly unoriginal variant on the nerd-with-a-dream recipe that's been clobbered to death in animated films for at least a decade now. Hectic as ever, Jack Black  voices Po, a potbellied panda who's stuck making noodles with dad (a goose—for reasons that escape me—voiced by James Hong ), even though he lives and breathes kung fu trivia and longs to become a Master. The call comes from Dustin Hoffman  as a pint-sized Zen guru, under whose grumpy tutelage Po and five other trainee critters with famous voices band together to save the world from a disgruntled snow leopard (Ian McShane ). The movie's design is striking, the colors are gorgeous, and the fight sequences are pretty suave—but the adorability quotient is set a little high for this jaded palate. And is there a child around the moviegoing globe who couldn't lip-sync by now the smug sloganeering about following your bliss, playing to your strengths, and learning to be a mensch in good times and bad? Department of small mercies: For once, the moral voice (or "takeaway," as it's excruciatingly called in the production notes) comes more out of Buddhism than the Protestant work ethic. So we're talking smash hit in Marin County  and Dharamsala .
