Amnesia and time travel � two of the cinema�s most recurrent narrative devices � are given another run-through in the new, and generally forgettable, Adrien Brody starrer, The Jacket
. The movie begins during the 1991 war in Iraq as American soldier Jack Starks (Brody) is shot in the head by an Iraqi child. He survives, is shipped home to Vermont, but is burdened with a nagging case of amnesia. In voiceover, Jack tells us that he was 27 the first time he died � a nifty thing to remember, considering the amnesia and all, but nevertheless an unsettling boding of his travails to come. Wandering on foot down the open roads of Vermont, he comes upon a car by the side of the road. A young girl stands by the open hood while her mother appears chemically wasted, slumped on the shoulder. Jack fixes their car and conveniently gives the girl his dog tags. Things don�t go as well with his next ride: He�s picked up by a stranger (Renfro), who turns into a cop killer, but due to his amnesia, Jack can�t remember what occurred and is quickly convicted of the crime and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane. There, he undergoes a curious treatment regimen at the hands of Dr. Becker (Kristofferson), which involves strapping Jack into a garishly sewn-together straitjacket and shoving him into a mortuary drawer that turns out to be a frightening time-travel portal. After several mind-numbing journeys into the future, we realize along with Jack that he has been transported to the year 2007, and while there, he meets up with and beds the now-grown-up girl with his dogtags (Knightley), who, like her mother, is well along the road to personal oblivion. Visually, The Jacket
 has a lot of flash, but it hardly compensates for the fuzzy story. Not much is reconciled, and the film also becomes sidetracked by a couple of unproductive subplots (one involves a kindlier doctor at the hospital, played by Leigh). Brody retains that haunted look he parlayed into an Oscar in The Pianist
, and Knightley has the most luscious lips this side of Angelina Jolie, while Kristofferson and Leigh work serviceably well but for little payoff. A subtle yet eerie soundtrack by musician�s musician Brian Eno is very effective. However, the film never really confronts any of the rich ideas inherent in the time-travel conceit, nor uses any of the military possibilities set up in the film�s opening. Amnesia and the U.S. military incursions in Iraq? Now there�s material for a mind-tripping d�j� vu. Somewhere along the way, director Maybury, an arty British director making his Hollywood debut, and the dozen or so producers listed in the credits (among them Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney�s Section Eight and Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner�s 2929 Entertainment) seem to have lost the thread that holds together this particular straitjacket.


What happens to Adrien Brody in ''The Jacket" shouldn't happen to a dog. It probably wouldn't
 happen to a dog or PETA would slap the producers with a lawsuit. Oscar-winning stars seeking that next jolt of career juice, on the other hand, can take a little abuse.
Playing Gulf War soldier Jack Starks, Brody is: shot in the head by an adorable Arab tyke; nearly buried alive; left with retrograde amnesia; shipped home to Vermont, where he hitches a ride with a sleazebag who frames the poor, woozy sod on a cop-killing charge; railroaded into a mental institution that appears to have been designed by the architectural firm of Lovecraft & Poe; shot up with a mystery potion by a fetid-looking Kris Kristofferson; and then left to sleep it off in a morgue drawer.
That's in the first 15 minutes.
You're not entirely sure where John Maybury's film can go from here -- will it be ''Gothika"-style horror? a metaphysical jigsaw like ''Jacob's Ladder"? -- but you're certain Brody is doing some almighty twitching up there on the screen. Wracked, skeletal, alternately whimpering and shrieking in pain and confusion, the ''Pianist" best actor makes such a convincing victim that he gives Jim Caviezel in ''The Passion of the Christ" a run for his martyrdom.
Just when you're about to give up, though -- and here I ask those who prefer their plot surprises to be surprising to step away from the newspaper -- ''The Jacket" plays its hand. Sitting in that dark drawer in 1992, Jack feverishly and literally daydreams himself into the year 2007, and the film turns into one of those time-loop head trips that keeps its hero frantically parsing the relationship between cause and effect.
Before he hitched that fatal ride, see, Jack paused to help out a stranded motorist and alcoholic mom named Jean (Kelly Lynch) while befriending her 8-year-old daughter Jackie (Laura Marano). Once he time-travels 15 years into the future -- please don't ask me how this works -- he's reacquainted with Jackie, all grown up and played with brooding anger and black fingernails by Keira Knightley. Not only has her mother died during the intervening time, she informs Jack, but so has he
 -- 15 years ago. Some quick calculation reveals that the Jack Starks lying in the asylum morgue has four days to live.
So ''The Jacket" becomes an extremely odd sort of murder mystery, not to mention a preposterous but engaging cross-chronological love story. The template, clearly, is ''Memento," Christopher Nolan's modern classic of fractured time and culpability, and Maybury, the British director who made the 1998 Francis Bacon biopic ''Love is the Devil," does everything he can to give ''Jacket" a similar post-gothic sizzle. The cinematography by Peter Deming (''Mulholland Dr.") de-saturates the colors until the movie feels like a bruise, and Emma E. Hickox's editing practically does jumping jacks trying to keep us off balance. (The score by celebrated rock brainiac Brian Eno, by contrast, seems strangely perfunctory.)
''The Jacket" is no ''Memento," though. Too much light shines through the holes of the plot, the tone gets stuck on the B-movie level, and the underpinnings of romance and revenge are trite for all the fancy trimmings. Still, the film is leagues smarter than ''The Butterfly Effect," last year's silly Ashton Kutcher time-looper that legions of slackers seem convinced is a great, even important, movie.
The acting makes the difference, and in ''Jacket" it rises above the needs of the material. Kristofferson is a greasy old hoot as the villain, while art-film heartthrob Daniel Craig (''Enduring Love") plays against type as a dithery fellow inmate of Jack's. Lynch, as the alky mom, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a doctor, don't have much to do, but Knightley convincingly moves into emotionally sexy/surly adult territory, even if her character buys Jack's story a lot faster than you or I ever would. (As for the sequence in which 1992-era Jack revisits his future lover as a young girl -- well, that's creepy in all the wrong ways).
Brody, for his part, slowly transforms from a sacrificial lamb to a canny time-surfer, like a man waking from a dream. One wonders if the actor had the same sensation as he looked up to find himself in this artful dead-end pulp.


         In the intermittently compelling but unavoidably improbable "The Jacket," Adrien Brody's sweet-natured Jack Starks is one unlucky guy. A Marine sergeant in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Starks smiles kindly at a native kid, who responds by shooting him in the head, nearly killing him and leaving him in a state of amnesia.
 
  After a long recovery, Starks is seen a year later hitchhiking in his native Vermont, where he encounters a young woman, Jean (Kelly Lynch), with a small daughter, Jackie (Laura Marano), by the roadside. Jean is intoxicated to the point of sickness, and her dingy pickup has stalled. Starks quickly gets the truck going, but the incoherent Jean responds as if he had tried to molest her daughter. Starks continues on his way, hitches a ride with a young guy (Brad Renfro) who is promptly stopped by a highway patrolman. The driver immediately opens fire on the officer, flees the scene — and Starks, who was wounded in the crossfire and blacked out, is blamed for the cop's murder and promptly sentenced to an institution for the criminally insane.
 


         






    Starks' horrendous misfortunes only escalate, for he has fallen into the hands of Kris Kristofferson's implacable Dr. Becker, who regards the inmates as criminals first and patients second and submits Jack to a hideously unorthodox behavioral modification treatment that involves straitjacketing the victim, injecting him with a huge dose of an antipsychotic drug — never mind that Jack isn't psychotic in the first place — and shoving him into a morgue-like drawer for hours on end. According to Becker it's all in the name of rehabilitation.
 
  All the above composes the film's elaborate setup. Once imprisoned inside the coffin-like space, Jack not only flashes on fragmented images of what happened to him in the Persian Gulf and to what really took place at that fatal roadside shooting but also flashes forward to 2007. In a series of time-trips, Jack encounters the now-adult Jackie (Keira Knightley), a beautiful but deeply troubled roadside-diner waitress, and after a shaky start they're playing detective to find out what happened to Jack on the fateful day of Jan. 1, 1992.
 
  It seems safe to say that whether this film works for the viewer depends upon his or her ability to suspend disbelief sufficiently to buy into the time-travel angle, which many will be unable to swallow. However, even the viewer who finds the premise too far-fetched to accept may nonetheless come away impressed with the ambitiousness of the attempt and even be moved by the emotional effect of the film's well-staged concluding sequence, which plugs into a universal yearning to step back into the past and alter the future, if even partially, for the happiness of another.
 
  "The Jacket" was written by Massy Tadjedin from a story by Tom Bleecker and Marc Rocco, and directed by John Maybury, best known for "Love Is the Devil," a captivatingly corrosive take on Francis Bacon, who could be as ferocious as his paintings. "The Jacket" is ambitious and stylish, striking a tone of cool contemporary detachment enhanced by Brian Eno's silky score. If the film finally seems silly and sentimental, it is no less a heartfelt quality effort.
 
  It's hard to imagine anyone but Brody in the role of Jack Starks, and it's not an unreasonable change of pace for the actor. His elegant thinness, his sensitivity and courage, his beatific smile are ideal for Jack's saintly martyrdom; Brody could be a model for a medieval likeness of Jesus nailed to the cross. The film sets up Jennifer Jason Leigh's idealistic and dedicated Dr. Lorenson as a contrast to the retrograde Becker only to reveal her as a timid and hopelessly compromised careerist. Also contributing a strong presence are Daniel Craig as Jack's earthy but deluded fellow inmate, and Brendan Coyle and Mackenzie Phillips as a pair of brutal aides at the institution. For those able to go along with it, "The Jacket" could emerge as a provocative fable of injustice and redemption.

Horror films these days are so single-minded about going for the throat, the gut, and other, lower body parts that it's easy to be grateful when one of them tries to engage the brain. The Jacket  feels like it must be the 12th jolt-laden morbid thriller to open this year, yet it's the first that doesn't insult your intelligence.
Adrien Brody, looking as elegantly spooked and spindly as a Tim Burton marionette, occupies the jittery, paranoid center of The Jacket . He plays Jack Starks, an amnesiac veteran of the 1991 Gulf War who, in scenes that zip by so fast we aren't sure if they're real, is convicted of murdering a police officer. He is sent to a psychiatric hospital, where, under the supervision of the sinister Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson, shot in close-ups that make his wrinkles look as if they're hatching schemes), he gets pumped full of drugs and put through a kind of altered-state nightmare ''therapy.'' Placed in a straitjacket, shoved into the claustrophobic blackness of a morgue drawer, Starks endures a chain of psychedelic flash-cut visions that propel him 15 years into the future.
There, he meets Jackie (Keira Knightley), a troubled coffee-shop waitress whom he'd encountered back when she was a little girl traveling the highway with her mother. The Jacket  glides back and forth between Starks' journeys in time, in which he tries to find out what happened to him, and the scenes at the mental ward, which are like Cuckoo's Nest  recast by David Fincher, all shot in that brackish gray-green school of cinematography that might be dubbed Formaldehyde Fluorescence.
Director John Maybury has a feel for shock rhythms, and he's skillful at keeping you guessing, but after a while you want your questions to cohere into compelling answers, and in The Jacket  they don't, quite. The film is a sea of red herrings. Knightley, wearing black nail polish (that's all you need to know about her character), does sexy dissolution just fine, but it's Brody who lends the movie more fearful clenched urgency than it deserves.

n "The Jacket," a new time-travel psychological thriller directed by John Maybury, Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Persian Gulf war who miraculously recovers from a bullet wound to the head, after which things get really strange. Trudging down a snowy Vermont road, he comes upon a stranded, inebriated woman (Kelly Lynch) and her cute-as-a-button daughter, and repairs their pickup truck. Then, after being set up for a murder that he did not commit, Jack is sent to a gothic state mental hospital, where a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) orders him drugged, restrained (in the garment of the title) and locked in what looks like an oversize filing-cabinet drawer, from which Jack is able to propel himself into the future (approximately two years from now). There, he meets an unhappy waitress played by Keira Knightley, whose British accent has disappeared and whose hair has been dyed brown. At this point, I will refrain from further plot summary, not because I'm worried about spoiling any surprises, but because to relate plainly and without embellishment what happens in "The Jacket" would make it sound more preposterous than it is. Make no mistake, this movie is terribly silly, but it's not completely terrible. It starts out trying to be craftily clever - with lots of fast, disorienting visual effects, echoey music and intimations of politics and paranoia - and ends up artlessly dumb. In other words, it improves as it goes along. Mr. Maybury, working from a busy screenplay by Massy Tadjedin, shows a fondness for extreme close-ups that is sometimes effective but more often bewildering. For a while, I thought the whole picture was going to be reflected in Mr. Brody's eyeballs, and at another point I wondered if the audience was being directed to admire the work of Mr. Kristofferson's dentist. At its less hectic moments, though - scenes in which the camera pulls back far enough to allow Mr. Brody and Ms. Knightley to occupy the frame together - the movie achieves a nice mixture of tenderness and foreboding. What is foreboded is pretty hokey stuff. All of the business about the gulf war and the intimations of loony-bin political allegory on the model of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" are red herrings, and the movie's premise is overloaded with gimmicks. Because the very idea strains basic canons of logic, time travel requires either extravagance on the order of "Back to the Future" or elegance, as perfected by Chris Marker in "La Jet�e" in 1962. "The Jacket" is not the first attempt to update the eerie power of that film, which is composed entirely of still images and lasts less than half an hour, but it joins Terry Gilliam's  "Twelve Monkeys"  as a warning to leave well enough alone. But Mr. Brody, stoop-shouldered and wary, remains an engaging presence, and his understatement is soothing in a picture crowded with maniacal overacting. The wonder of it is that Jennifer Jason Leigh, playing a kindly counterpart to Mr. Kristofferson's vengeful villain, is not the worst offender. That would be Daniel Craig, as a ranting maniac - there's one in every ward, at least in the movies -whose most delusional ravings turn out to be the only things that make sense. Or maybe not. "The Jacket" wants to be a clever, puzzling metaphysical whodunit, with a dose of spiritual uplift thrown in for good measure. Since it is too sloppy to work as a brain-teaser like "Pi" or "Memento," the slide into sentimentality comes as something of a relief, even as it leaves behind a tangle of false leads and loose ends. The motives and methods of the evil doctor, in particular, remain unexplained. His therapeutic practices are, to say the least, unorthodox, but then again, this hospital is a mighty peculiar place. In the day room, for instance, the patients appear to be watching CNN while listening to a lecture by Noam Chomsky, a combination that may explain why they are all twitching and drooling. No wonder Jack is soon begging to be locked up in that drawer, where he can zoom into 2007 and catch a glimpse of Ms. Knightley in the bathtub. "The Jacket" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, obscenity, brief nudity and a time-travel sex scene.
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of time-travel moviesone in which the protagonist's attempts to meddle with chronological cause and effect result in a traumatic collapse of the space-time continuum, the other in which a malleable universe grants infinite license to the laissez-faire time traveler, who doesn't stop tampering until everything is exactly as he or she pleases. While last year's Primer  is a sterling example of the cautionary mode, The Jacket  subscribes to the latter ideology with dubious vigor: Casting aside metaphysical dilemmas and political subtexts, the film devotes itself solely to securing an acceptable outcome for its war-traumatized hero.
The Jacket  steals its notion of a man haunted by his own death from any number of La Jetée  variants, but mostly, given the suggestion of post-combat syndrome, from Jacob's Ladder . After suffering a near-fatal gunshot to the head from an Iraqi child during the first Gulf war, Jack Starks  (Adrien Brody ) is shipped home to snowy Vermont . One disorienting day, he stops to help a drunk woman (Kelly Lynch) and her daughter, winds up in a shoot-out, and is arrested for killing a cop. Sentenced to a mental institution, Starks, suffering from partial amnesia, is subjected to a highly experimental treatment by the baleful Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson )electroshocked, straitjacketed, and shoved into a mortuary drawer that has the properties of a time machine.
Commuting between 1992 and 2007, where Starks soon begins romancing the now grown little girl (Keira Knightley ), The Jacket  is a disappointing nosedive into the mainstream for John Maybury , the Derek Jarman  acolyte who transitioned successfully from experimental work to features with 1998's hallucinatory Francis Bacon  biopic Love Is the Devil . Maybury gives the movie's night-sweat visions a strobing, vaguely avant-garde flourish, but proves only that he's a cut above the average David Fincher  wannabe. The hero's condition, which goes unconnected to the amnesia of war, instead becomes an allegory for a filmmaker forgetting his roots.
