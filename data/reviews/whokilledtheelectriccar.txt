         Given the problems wrought on the planet by the oil industry, geo-politics and massive pollution, it would be a dream come true if some inventor and auto company could come up with an electric car that runs on batteries, doesn't consume fossil fuel and doesn't pollute the environment.
 
  What a glorious fantasy! Maddeningly, though, this particular dream happens to be true, a wondrous tale with an infuriating ending (at least so far).
 


         






    There was just such an automobile: an electric car that ran on special batteries, had incredible acceleration and speed and required only recharging to keep running.
 
  It was available in 1996: the General Motors EV1. (Another version of the electric car, the RAV4 EV, was available from Toyota.)
 
  The EV1, which was leased rather than sold, was the product of a legendary designer, Paul MacCready. It was fast, clean and quiet, and its happy driver-leasers included Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks and Alexandra Paul of "Baywatch."
 
  Then, in 2000, GM suddenly began reversing direction, switching from electric car manufacturing back to gas-powered vehicles at its Lansing, Mich., plant.
 
  Eventually GM reclaimed all the EV1s, and, despite organized protests by satisfied EV1 customers and fans, an offer to buy all the cars was refused and the vehicles were eventually hauled off to GM's Arizona desert proving ground, crushed and destroyed.
 
  Why?
 
  That's the "murder mystery" this film sets out to answer — and pretty well does. Director-writer Chris Paine was one of those happy EV1 leasers and later the owner of a Toyota RAV4 EV, and his love for these electric cars has inspired this often fascinating picture.
 
  In it, Paine tells the tale of the car's invention and lays out a long list of suspects in its annihilation — including oil companies, car companies, the government, the California Air Resources Board and its 1999-2004 chair, Alan C. Lloyd, and even American consumers, who, some argued, simply didn't want the car.
 
  The films ends up "convicting" some defendants (a few with mitigating circumstances) and "acquitting" others.
 
  "Who Killed the Electric Car?" isn't at all neutral. Paine is a passionate advocate of the electric car and a supporter of the California zero-emission-vehicle mandate, which helped create the EV1 market (before that mandate was later modified under pressure). He is obviously saddened and even incensed at its demise.
 
  But "Electric Car" strikes me as fair. Paine gives his opponents their say, including GM's representatives and Lloyd, the mild-mannered CARB chairman. There are dozens of interviewees, including Gibson (sporting a wild ZZ Top beard), Paul, EV1 drive system engineer Alan Cocconi, The Times auto critic Dan Neil, the inevitable Ralph Nader and the surprising Phyllis Diller (who recalls pre-1920 electric cars).
 
  But, even though Paine's sympathies are obvious, they help rather than hurt his film. Documentaries, from their earliest years, have a strong tradition of advocacy; it's mostly Michael Moore's more impassioned detractors who insist that nonfiction films are simply another form of the "neutral" evening TV news.

 A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, "Who Killed the Electric Car?" is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. Like Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth" and the better nonfiction inquiries into the war in Iraq, this information-packed history about the effort to introduce — and keep  —  electric vehicles on the road wasn't made to soothe your brow. For the film's director, Chris Paine, the evidence is too appalling and our air too dirty for palliatives.  Fast and furious, "Who Killed the Electric Car?" is, in brief, the sad tale of yet one more attempt by a heroic group of civic-minded souls to save the browning, warming planet. The story mostly unfolds during the 1990's, when a few automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, were prodded to pursue — only to sabotage covertly — a cleaner future. In 1990 the state's smog-busting California Air Resources Board adopted the Zero-Emission Vehicle mandate in a bid to force auto companies to produce exhaust-free vehicles. The idea was simple: we were choking to death on our own waste. The goals were seemingly modest: by 1998, 2  percent of all new cars sold in the biggest vehicle market in the country would be exhaust-free, making California's bumper-to-bumper lifestyle a touch less hellish.  Given that some companies, including G.M., were already creating prototypes for electric cars that could be mass produced, the mandate didn't seem unfeasible or unreasonable. Electric cars have been around about as long as the automobile and, believe it or not, Phyllis Diller. Mr. Paine's résumé is peppered with Hollywood credits, which may explain why, in addition to the usual expert talking heads, he has tapped so many celebrities and pseudo-celebrities.  Presumably Mr. Paine thinks audiences listen to the famous and almost famous, which is certainly the case with Ms. Diller, who delivers a nostalgic ode to the first electric vehicles while in front of an ornately framed painting of Bob Hope. Both the comedian and the filmmaker certainly know how to grab your attention.  Henry Ford and cheap oil helped keep electric cars off the road, leaving the fast-growing highway system to the spewing, sputtering internal-combustion engine. Oscillating between interviews and an array of punchy visuals, including industrial and nonfiction films, Mr. Paine lays out how the country's romance with gasoline-thirsty cars quickly turned into the craziest kind of love. By the 1950's, the zoom years of Jack Kerouac and James Dean, Los Angeles pedestrians who braved the city's streets could be seen covering their mouths with handkerchiefs, trying to filter the air. Many decades and smog alerts later, the state took bold action. What happened next, Mr. Paine explains, is a familiar story of corporate greed and governmental corruption, mixed in with flickers of idealism and outrage.  It's a story Mr. Paine tells with bite. In 1996 a Los Angeles newspaper reported that "the air board grew doubtful about the willingness of consumers to accept the cars, which carry steep price tags and have a limited travel range." Mr. Paine pushes beyond this ostensibly disinterested report, suggesting that one reason the board might have grown doubtful was because its chairman at the time, Alan C. Lloyd, had joined the California Fuel Cell Partnership. Established in 1999, this partnership is a joint effort of the federal and state agencies, fuel cell companies, car manufacturers like G.M. and energy peddlers like Exxon to explore the potential (note that word, potential) of vehicles powered by hydrogen-cell fuels.  Why would a company like Exxon back a zero-emission vehicle technology that — according to some of the authorities interviewed in the film, like Joseph J. Romm, an assistant secretary in the Department of Energy during the Clinton administration and author of "The Hype About Hydrogen" —  is a long way from real-life roadways? The answers may not surprise you, particularly if you are predisposed to watching a film titled "Who Killed the Electric Car?," but they're eye-and-vein-popping nonetheless. As Mr. Paine forcefully makes clear, the story of the electric car is greater than one zippy ride and the people who loved it. From the polar ice caps to Los Angeles, where many cars truly are to die for, it is a story as big as life, and just as urgent.  "Who Killed the Electric Car?" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Revelations of big-business and government collusion may provoke shock, shock.

Oil companies aren't the only ones profiting from a spike in prices at the gas pump. It's likely also to boost the prospects of "Who Killed the Electric Car?" a likable if partisan post-mortem on the now-defunct auto. Writer-helmer Chris Paine leaves no doubt he's a huge fan of the car nor who he considers the bad guys to be in this tale of a technological dream deferred. But a bipartisan attitude and an optimistic conclusion (added after its Sundance screening as a work-in-progress) give the doc a chance at a wide aud and media coverage for its June 28 rollout. 
With Martin Sheen's canned-sounding voice as narrator, pic calls for an alternative to the smog-spewing automobile, particularly given the link between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. GM launched research in 1987 for a mass-produced electric car, with engineer Alan Cocconi designing the power system that allowed the vehicle -- the EV-1 -- terrific acceleration.
According to Paine's report, the car's beginning was in California, the first state to pass legislation requiring automakers to make a portion of their future fleets with zero-emission engines. The EV-1 fan club ranges from Mel Gibson to the pic's hero, Chelsea Sexton, who worked on the EV-1 team, is now a vigorous activist for electric cars, and is seen throughout the doc leading protests against her former employer.
The film recalls -- though never entirely explains -- the efforts by manufacturers of e-cars to both make them and squelch them. But a finger is also pointed at government for failing to enforce its original mandate.
Story slips into a wistful mood as owners recount how their beloved leased EV-1s were taken back by GM, and then found crushed and dumped in the Nevada desert. A checklist of "guilty" and "not guilty" parties is included, but some will take issue with who's on the roster.
Closing reel tries to stick a happy face onto the film, with ex-CIA chief James Woolsey urging auto and energy alternatives along with the geopolitical reasons behind them. Still, no amount of last-reel optimism will cool the anger of progressive-minded auds.
Vid-to-film transfer is fair, and talking head segments pile up like a bad day on the 405. A zippy pace is maintained by editors Michael Kovalenko and Chris A. Peterson.

Admit it: For years you've been burning to know what ol' Phyllis Diller  really thinks about electric cars, which first (dis)appeared in her youth. "They were very quiet," she recalls. (Isn't a Mack truck quiet compared to Phyllis Diller?) The real question is why this purportedly impassioned documentary investigation of a great subjectthe culture's conspiratorial dismissal of eco-friendly alternatives to the gas-guzzlerwould assume such massive viewer disinterest that it coats the pill with C-list celebrity NutraSweet , including Martin Sheen  voiceovers ("As the 20th century gathered speed . . . ") that would sound unforgivably hackneyed even on basic cable. An opening vignette in a California cemetery has GM's produced-and-abandoned EV-1 being "buried" by tearful mourners (ha-ha); subsequent title cards, complete with Fox News ish animation (whoosh!), finger so many of the usual suspects (e.g., carmakers, lawmakers, big oil, us) that the titular question might as well be Who Didn't Kill . . . ?  Director Chris Paine 's choice of talking heads leads you to think that famous people were the only ones lucky enough to have leased GM's now flattened roadsteruntil the awkward slip of his would-be audience surrogate, a "former EV-1 specialist," appears to reveal that his own model has somehow been tucked away for safe keeping. Another few of these squandered opportunities for art-house muckraking and we'll need someone to ask who killed the left-wing documentary.
