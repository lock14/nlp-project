Here's what I don't get: Comedies like "Christmas With the Kranks," "Deck the Halls," and now "Four Christmases" drag us through a living hell of seasonal dysfunction and loathsome relatives and expect us to spend $10 a seat for the privilege? At best, these movies are exercises in masochism. At worst - well, why pay for something you can get at home for free?
"Four Christmases" is essentially "Meet the Parents" quadrupled: Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn) play a San Francisco couple whose three-year relationship is thriving precisely because they haven't introduced each other to their families. Instead, they cut out each Christmas for a tropical vacation, telling the folks they're off to help starving children in Burma. As Brad says, "You can't spell 'families' without 'lies.' "
This year their flight is canceled and a news camera puts the couple on TV, so there's no escape: It's off to see mom and dad and mom and dad, each divorced and living in his or her own special pit of middle-class misery. Brad's pop (Robert Duvall) is a meathead whose other two sons (Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw) are cage-fighting morons. Kate's mom (Mary Steenburgen) is a cougar whose new boyfriend (Dwight Yoakam) is a rock-and-roll pastor. Brad's mom (Sissy Spacek) is a hippie married to his childhood best friend.
Kate's dad (Jon Voight) is surprisingly normal. There's always one freak.
Filling out the roster is a gaggle of relatives (Kristin Chenoweth, Carol Kane) and truly hateful grandchildren. It's tough to decide what's more depressing: watching some of the finest actors of the 1970s pick up loose change playing these cartoons or the sight of director Seth Gordon (who made the excellent 2007 videogame documentary, "The King of Kong") taking on a cookie-cutter comedy and losing.
At least the leads are interestingly mismatched: Witherspoon's pointy-chinned delicacy and Vaughn's blubbery sarcasm go together like after-dinner mints and beer. They're both whip-smart actors, though, and you can see them looking desperately for a way to crank "Four Christmases" into a good, rude farce. The scenes that simply let the two fire wisecracks off each other are funny yet intimate, and there's comedy even in the way Vaughn towers over Witherspoon, an unwashed Great Dane to her crisp, yappy terrier. They belong in a movie together. Just not this one.
Anyway, like all lousy home-for-the-holidays comedies, "Four Christmases" doesn't even have the courage of its own bile, ending with a message of love and fuzzy fellow feeling that directly contradicts the misanthropic sourness of everything that has come before. When will filmmakers learn that if you start with "Bad Santa" and finish with "It's a Wonderful Life," you just end up with curdled eggnog?


In the crassly enjoyable Four Christmases , Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn are forced to put in a yuletide visit to each of their divorced parents. It's four home-for-the-holidays comedies in one, and the variety-pack structure works for the movie: Each nightmare household has a wacked flavor all its own, and none wears out its welcome. (The entire film runs 89 minutes.) The halfway humane joke is that Vaughn and Witherspoon have avoided marriage and kids, so what's missing from their lives is the messiness of...life. Enter the coarse, bawdy corrective that is the Christmas family megaplex comedy. The quartet of house parties are sprinkled with witty actors like Jon Favreau, alarmingly convincing as Vaughn's mohawked sociopath brother, and Mary Steenburgen, who gives Witherspoon's pious mother a touch of erotic gumption. It's a pleasure to see Vaughn play an actual character  a nervous motormouth who speaks in loop-the-loop sentences he uses to talk himself into things. Those sentences are the sound of an actor trying, in his way, to grow up. B–

 Every holiday season, either out of respect for tradition or sheer spite, at least one Hollywood studio is sure to release a drippily sentimental, gratingly cheerful “comedy,” indigestible as a fruitcake and disposable as wrapping paper. All appearances to the contrary, “Four Christmases” is not this year’s version. Yes, it follows a charming, mismatched couple on a sentimental journey involving presents, family and the sharing of food and feelings, but the picture, briskly directed by Seth Gordon from a snappy, many-authored script, is refreshingly tart and lean, forgoing the usual schmaltz and syrup.  Don’t get the wrong idea. “Four Christmases” isn’t anything astonishing, but at 86 minutes, divided into four farcical set pieces, plus necessary exposition, denouement and interstitial drive time, it’s an efficient and stress-free entertainment package. For the audience, that is. The main characters seem pretty miserable most of the time, which is as it should be.  To an unusual and welcome degree, “Four Christmases” makes merry with an impressive range of modern American social awfulness. In its view of the discomfort that persists between parents and their grown-up children, it flirts with the misanthropy encapsulated in Philip Larkin’s poem “This Be the Verse,” which begins with an unprintable axiom and concludes with the advice to “get out as early as you can/and don’t have any kids yourself.”  This is the counsel Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn) seem to have followed. An unmarried, fun-loving San Francisco couple, they have tactfully estranged themselves from parents, stepparents and siblings. Each Christmas Kate and Brad invent an exotic charity project as cover for a hedonistic jaunt that takes them far from the claims of kin. This year, though, their planned escape is foiled, and they must run a grueling (and surprisingly brutal) gantlet through the homes of four divorced parents, enduring awkwardness, humiliation and sexual ickiness.  “I swear I never had sexual feelings for your mom until I was 30,” Brad’s childhood best friend tells him. It’s much funnier, as well as more appalling, in context.  Mr. Vaughn is supposed to be the offspring of Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek, a curious casting choice unless the editors left out a flashback in which the infant Brad fell into a vat of human growth hormone. Kate’s parents are played by Mary Steenburgen and, all too briefly, Jon Voight, and her undermining, aggressively fertile sister by Kristin Chenoweth.  Brad’s feral brothers, a pair of semi-professional extreme cage fighters, are Tim McGraw and Jon Favreau, and the generally high caliber of the supporting performances — Dwight Yoakam as Pastor Phil, Kate’s mom’s latest boyfriend, also deserves mention — goes a long way toward making “Four Christmases” palatable.  And Ms. Witherspoon serves as a game comic sidekick to the irrepressible Mr. Vaughn, who basically does what he always does, which is to stammer, bluster and wheedle his way through a performance that scrambles the distinction between brute and wimp. He has a tendency, slyly mocked in a church pageant scene, to upstage whomever he’s paired with, and Ms. Witherspoon, though a fine comedian in her own right, is perhaps a bit too decorous and obliging.  The difference in size between them presents an interesting visual challenge, as they fit into the frame like Gandalf and Frodo, or Marmaduke and a Hummel figurine. There are other reasons not to believe them as a couple, one being that no sane woman could endure more than 90 minutes of Brad’s company. But since you don’t even have to endure that much, it really isn’t your problem.  “Four Christmases” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity and sexual situations and references.

The biggest artistic challenge facing first-time feature helmer Seth Gordon in "Four Christmases" was how to photograph co-stars Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon in the same frame, as he's about a foot and a half taller than she is. It's a dilemma the director never really solves in this oddly misanthropic, occasionally amusing but thoroughly cheerless holiday attraction that is in no way a family film, but will no doubt be mistaken for such by many unsuspecting patrons. Given the cast and comic expectations, commercial results should be moderately bright, at least initially, for this New Line venture inherited by Warner Bros.
Parents will know they've walked into the wrong film right away, as the opening scene has lovers Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) pretending not to know each other and enacting a pick-up scene at a trendy bar before slipping into the bathroom for some quick shtupping. Remainder of the script by a foursome of writers spins on the view held by these two smug, self-satisfied San Francisco professionals that family visits over Christmas are to be avoided at all costs.
With their planned trip to Fiji canceled by fog, the couple have the misfortune of being shown on TV stranded at the airport, resulting in instantaneous parental calls to come visit. As each has divorced parents, that makes four households to stop by -- something of a challenge for a twosome who have sworn off marriage and kids, for reasons that shortly become obvious.
Format thus sets up an episodic structure that would seem to demand that each visit top the last in excruciating, hilarious awfulness. But nothing outdoes the spectacle of the first family encounter, with Brad's grumpy redneck father (Robert Duvall) and his muscle-bound brothers, Denver and Dallas (Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw), cage wrestlers both. Sequence unquestionably makes fun of these lower-class yahoos and ends in catastrophe.
Next up are Kate's mom (Mary Steenburgen) and assorted offspring, notably including Kate's sister Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth, an excellent sibling match-up with Witherspoon). As happened with Brad at the initial stop, beans get spilled about Kate here that she'd rather keep in the deep freeze. As Mom has taken up with a good ol'-time-religion preacher (Dwight Yoakam), everyone heads off to a Christmas pageant in which the visitors are embarrassingly drafted to portray Joseph and Mary.
Visiting Brad's rich old hippie mother (Sissy Spacek), her son must endure the company of Ma's boyfriend, who just happens to be one of his own former buddies.
By the time they get to the home of Kate's father (Jon Voight, also aptly cast opposite Witherspoon), she's so bummed she packs off Brad, for whom the main lesson of the day has been "the dangers of procreating." Kate is in a different state of mind, a rather odd one given the calamities of the day, and one that sets up a momentary conflict quickly solved.
Vaughn is his usual motor-mouthed, preoccupied self, although less antic and vulgar and more polite and considerate than his norm. Breaking type here is Witherspoon, who abandons her perky, upbeat image for the brittle, somewhat chilly piece of work that is Kate. With all the scripts doubtless at her doorstep in the wake of her "Walk the Line" triumph, it's a wonder she chose this one, which in no way relies upon her special talents and does her no particular favors.
Set in the Bay Area, the pic has modest production values that could have used a little of the coin that no doubt went to pay the 11 producers. Director Gordon parlayed his documentary success with "The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters" into this narrative gig, and his work is not without promise, although he had even more trouble setting up over-the-shoulder shots with his two stars than he did with the two-shots.

To brand, then dismiss, Four Christmases  as a disappointment would be giving it too much credit—never, for a second, did this New Line Cinema  cast-off scream or even whisper decent  in the run-up to its opening. The story of couple Kate (Reese Witherspoon ) and Brad (Vince Vaughn )—not married, might as well be—who, fogged in on December 25, put their planned Fiji  frolic on hold to visit their four divorced parents in the course of a single day, the movie doesn't offer a single surprise within its scant 82 minutes, which feel like at least twice that. There's happiness and cheer and more than the occasional tear dropped between shouting matches and withering stares, all pre-assembled and gift-wrapped by the ho-ho-hos at The Studio.
Sure, there was every reason to hope for more. Four Christmases  was, after all, directed by Seth Gordon , whose 2007 The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters  was a bittersweet, hilarious documentary in which a cocky mullet squares off against a sweet doofus over a Donkey Kong  machine. At first, word was that Gordon had been hired to remake his fact as Hollywood fiction. Then, word was that Gordon was doing his home-for-the-holidays movie—the sure sign a comer had gone in the wrong direction. How cute, though: Gordon brought King of Kong 's sweet doofus, Steve Wiebe , along to Hollywood to appear in Four Christmases . Alas, he says nothing and, in one scene, pretends to sleep on a couch.
Still—Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, right? As sure a thing as pancakes and bacon on Christmas morning. But even there, the pairing's off. Whatever Vaughn has going for him—charming bluster, hellacious timing, velvet delivery, doughy good looks—he serves up times a thousand here; as big ol' Brad, the guy's turned up to 11. In the past, Vaughn has proven capable of lowering the volume without sacrificing what made him; he's rather good in the underrated The Break-Up , as unflinching as Four Christmases  is phony. Here, he must have felt the need to shout, just to be heard.
And Witherspoon's just . . . there. And barely there at that, no doubt a condition brought about by standing next to Mount Vaughn, who tends to dwarf anyone with whom he shares a scene. As perky/grumpy poor ol' Kate, she starts out strong, role-playing as a take-no-shit barfly who screws Vaughn's wallflower put-on in a bathroom stall during the opening scene. But as the movie deflates (starting about two minutes in), so does she. Then again, it's hard to act in a movie that has you driving here and there and back again in barely more time than an episode of an TV dramedy.
It's also difficult to build a character when the writers—four of them, one for every 20 minutes—fail to create anything more than bland archetypes. (It takes forever just to find out Brad's a lawyer; we never do discover Kate's profession.) Their own parents being divorced, Kate and Brad don't want to get married; life's rough. Only, Kate's having doubts; hints are dropped early. Then whispers become screams as, one by one, they visit the folks: first, Brad's dad (a surly Robert Duvall ); then Kate's mom (a horny Mary Steenburgen ); then Brad's mom (a hornier Sissy Spacek ); and, finally, Kate's dad (a patronly and oddly smooth-surfaced Jon Voight ).
If you think one home-for-the-holidays movie is bad—and, until this year's A Christmas Tale , imported from France, there hadn't been a decent offering in the subgenre since Jodie Foster 's, um, Home for the Holidays  in 1995—imagine a four-pack, only with just time enough for a single sitcom setup and the shrugging happily-ever-after each. The pace here is lethargic; the movie desperately needs a laugh track. Only, the joke's terrible to begin with.
When Four Christmases  isn't forced, it's simply lazy, like when the writers somehow jam Vaughn into a short-short robe to play the part of Joseph in Dwight Yoakam 's church, where . . . oh, did I mention Dwight Yoakam's in this? Also: Jon Favreau  and Tim McGraw  as Vaughn's brothers Denver and Dallas, respectively, both of whom are backyard amateur cage fighters. And Kristin Chenoweth  as Kate's baby-machine sister. Carole Kane  and Colleen Camp  are here, too. This thing's as star-studded as a Very Special Episode of The Love Boat . And, look, it's a Swingers  reunion, featuring not only Favreau but also Patrick Van Horn , who was Swingers ' Sue and now plays Brad's former BFF turned mom's lovey-dovey boyfriend. Ick.
There is, of course, the slightest chance that Four Christmases  wasn't intended as a comedy; it's so irritating at times—the people, the screeching, the way everything looks washed out in a made-in-the-early-'80s way—that maybe Gordon was going for ironic, grim, and sad. Or perhaps it was gutted of its best moments. Surely, something was left on the kitchen floor to get this thing under 90 minutes. Based on the evidence provided by King of Kong , Gordon is capable of better—to say nothing of Witherspoon, Vaughn, and their small army of co-stars. Really, Four Christmases  is too benign to get too worked up about. For a worse Christmas movie, one need look back no further than last fall's Fred Claus , starring Vaughn and that poor, poor Paul Giamatti .
