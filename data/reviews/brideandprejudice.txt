In "Bride and Prejudice," director Gurinder Chadha gives Jane Austen the Bollywood treatment, turning Austen's white Englishfolk into singing, dancing, vibrantly dressed Indians.
The director's ambition is exciting, since many a popular Bollywood extravaganza is about the vagaries of love, family, and marriage, and Austen's social observations are applicable to nearly any modern culture at any time.
But like Chadha's last film, the popular "Bend it Like Beckham," "Bride and Prejudice" betrays its best intentions. Trying to capture the vibrancy of multiculturalism while playing cross-cultural clashes for laughs, the movie ends up excruciatingly petty in its handling of racial identity and cultural fidelity.
In "Bride and Prejudice," weddings abound. The first is in Amritsar, the Punjabi city where the invitees include white American hotel heir Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), his British-Indian friend Balraj Bingley (Naveen Andrews), and Balraj's haughty sister, Kiran (Indira Varma). Will is instantly smitten with Lalita, a member of the wedding party, who's played by Aishwarya Rai, a former Miss World winner and Indian film icon, starring in her first English movie.
It's hard to tell whether Lalita notices Will because he's cute or because the kurta he's wearing is just a little whiter than everybody else's. Regardless, while Balraj embarks on a fling with Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar), one of Lalita's handful of unmarried sisters, she and Will enjoy a tentative flirtation, fraught with cultural friction. With the permission of the girls' senseless mother (Nadira Babbar) and sensible father (the wonderful Anupam Kher), they head to a resort on Goa, which Will announces he'd like to buy. Lalita is quick to remind him: this paradise is not India!
Their antipathy seems so strong that the screenplay, by Chadha and her frequent collaborator Paul Mayeda Berges, runs into trouble. When the inevitable rapprochement arrives, it makes all the political disagreements that came before seem trivial.
A few months ago, director Mira Nair poured Bollywood flavoring atop William Makepeace Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" like ketchup. In some ways, Chadha's adaptation of Austen is preferable; she at least tries to capture the cheeky essence of her source material. Both women have fascinating post-colonial thoughts about India's relationship to England, but neither has come up with a resonant vehicle to express them. Maybe Bollywood is not the answer.
As a musical, "Bride and Prejudice" feels drowsy. The songs, by Craig Pruess and the outrageously prolific Anu Malik, are sugary and snappy, and Saroj Khan's choreography is her usual pleasing blend of grinding, twisting, and twirling. But the staging of the numbers is missing the fever that keeps you from worrying that the actors might, say, fall off their mattresses as they dance and lip-sync with each other. The movie hops from India to England to the United States, but rarely feels like more than a celebration of globe-trotting, and often a wrongheaded one at that. The only person who pledges a love of India is the American R&B singer Ashanti, who looks uncomfortable chirping in a nightclub, "India is the place for me, India sets me free." And Chadha's Indian characters are freakier than everyone else.
Witness the snake dance Lalita's sister does for her family and guests (Chadha is betting you'll find that a scream). She also bets more laughs are in store for Kholi (Nitin Ganatra), the tacky Americanized nerd who calls the house in his Los Angeles subdivision his "crib" and wears his shirt open to his navel. Because Kholi claims to have money and prefer an Indian wife (American girls are too rootless, too independent, too lesbian), Lalita's mother throws her on the slab.
Some audiences might warm to all this (it feels harmless), though it's impossible to imagine which. It's unthinkable, for instance, that any competent filmmaker would shoot a romantic comedy with Martin Henderson as her lead while Naveen Andrews languishes in a thankless side part. Andrews is currently playing the Iraqi on "Lost" and he's a charismatic actor. He shouldn't be second banana to Henderson, a New Zealander most famous for making out with Britney Spears in her "Toxic" video.
Beautiful as she is, Rai is not enough of a presence to redirect the movie's energy or its troubling points of view. She's a Bollywood megastar, and in her Hindi vehicles, she's extremely fun-loving but utterly chaste. Things between her and Henderson never seem more than platonic.
You get the impression that Chadha believes the races should collide, that white and brown, Indian, British, and American should merge because that's an accurate reflection of the world. But in attempting to show us a love blind to class, culture, and color, she's also made it bland.

         Jane Austen comes from sturdy stock. She prospered in posh Beverly Hills in "Clueless" and survived a transplant to trendy London in "Bridget Jones's Diary." Now it's India's turn, and Austen proves to be more than up to the switch in scenery in Gurinder Chadha's lively and cheerful "Bride & Prejudice."
 
  As "Bend It Like Beckham," her last film, demonstrated, co-writer (with Paul Mayeda Berges) and director Chadha has a knack for situations that blend cultures. Here she not only mixes Western and Indian characters, she marries the sensibilities of English language independent cinema with the agreeable conventions of India's Bollywood musicals.
 


         






    The result, to tell the truth, is ragged around the edges, but it creates so much good feeling it is hard to be unduly troubled. Very much in the Bollywood tradition, this broadly comic treatment is popular cinema at its most popular, a movie where we long for the singing and dancing and are not disappointed when it arrives.
 
  It also doesn't hurt to have the beautiful former Miss World and Bollywood luminary Aishwarya Rai starring as Lalita Bakshi (read Elizabeth Bennet), the strong-minded heroine of the piece. Rai had previously starred in another Bollywood Austen adaptation, "Kandukondain Kandukondain," or "I Have Found It," based on "Sense and Sensibility," and she is completely at home in the territory.
 
  Rai's most impressive collaborator, both here and in her earlier "Devdas," is veteran choreographer Saroj Khan, responsible, the press notes claim, for about 2,000 films. Working with composer Anu Malik, Khan has filled "Bride & Prejudice" with the kind of irresistible, energetic dancing that translates into happy faces and high spirits.
 
  "Bride" is set not in a metropolis like Bombay or Delhi but the more removed Indian city of Amritsar. In fact we first glimpse our impeccably turned out heroine on a tractor and looking as at home on that piece of machinery as Paris Hilton.
 
  While Lalita is inspecting the family acreage, William Darcy (New Zealand's Martin Henderson) is getting off a plane. The scion of one of America's richest hotel-owning families, he is on his first visit to India with his equally well-off friend Balraj (Naveen Andrews of "The English Patient," the more recent "Easy," and TV's "Lost.")
 
  Lalita is one of four Bakshi sisters, and fate in the form of a convenient wedding throws these groups together. Balraj is immediately entranced with Lalita's older sister Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar, yet another beauty queen-turned-actress), while Lalita, a woman with a mind of her own, finds herself less taken with the haughty Darcy.
 
  This wealthy young American has a number of bonehead misconceptions about India. He worries about "Delhi belly" (the film's dialogue is not exactly a strength), and he is insensitive to Indian customs such as matches arranged by the family. "Americans," rails Lalita, "think they have the answer for everything, even marriage."
 
  Making matters worse for audiences, if not necessarily Lalita, is that Henderson, a capable actor who was an asset alongside Naomi Watts in "The Ring," does not make a convincing Darcy. The crucial combination of hauteur and eventual warmth is a difficult one, and every actor can't be a Laurence Olivier (who nailed the role in 1940's "Pride and Prejudice"), but what we have here is not what's called for.
 
  It's a mark of the strength of "Bride & Prejudice's" other elements and the verve Chadha brings to the proceedings that we can more or less shrug this off and concentrate on the actors who do well, such as Nitin Ganatra as Mr. Kholi.
 
  An amusing riff on Austen's Mr. Collins, Mr. Kholi is presented as an arriviste accountant from California, complete with gold chains, who has come to India to find a wife because he finds women in L.A. to be too outspoken and career-oriented. "Don't say anything too intelligent," Mrs. Bakshi cautions Lalita, but the warning comes too late.
 
  Aside from the singing and dancing, it is the color and pageantry of India as filtered through the work of cinematographer Santosh Sivan (who directed the very different "The Terrorist") that captivates us. There's a real sense of unbridled spectacle here, which extends to putting a gospel choir on the beach in Santa Monica for the film's L.A. sequences, and it's best to simply let it all wash over you.
 
  As the original novel demands, it is the women who are the heart of things in "Bride & Prejudice." When they get together to sing and dance to the ironic, reggae-inflected "No Life Without Wife," they marry the worlds of Jane Austen and Bollywood in a way that no one would dare put asunder.

Jane Austen is the hardest-working dead authoress in Hollywood. Having posthumously contributed to the success of Bridget Jones's Diary , which borrowed incalculably from the sparkling plot structure of Pride and Prejudice , the late novelist now extends her influence to that least Hampshirish of genres born of the dazzling heat and dust of India, the Bollywood musical. Bride & Prejudice  is based, as the title suggests, on Austen's 19th-century literary masterpiece about a spunky young woman from a genteel if asset-poor family whose future happiness with an equally formidable mate depends on her ability to overcome the obstacles of his pride and her prejudice. But under the direction of Bend It Like Beckham 's Gurinder Chadha, this festively busy and exuberantly multicultural charmer is its own intriguingly postmodern creation Â a  savory entertainment as irresistibly faux-exotic as a Putumayo CD sampler of world music.
Here, in the role of the headstrong heroine now named Lalita, is Bollywood royalty and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai. Here is Bollywood royalty and former Miss India Namrata Shirodkar as the sweet-natured eldest sister, now in love with Anglo-Indian Balraj Bingley, played by TV's Lost  royalty Naveen Andrews. Bland New Zealander Martin Henderson (Torque ) pretends to be American as Mr. Darcy, blander fellow Kiwi Daniel Gillies fills in as the deceptively attractive Mr. Wickham Â and the pudding-soft presence of the two only strengthens Chadha's amusing notion of East-West synthesis.
Before her movie ends, in a knowingly corny spray of fountain jets, the director has brought in an African-American gospel choir, a Mexican street band, a knot of English Morris dancers, and a scrum of SoCal beach bodies straight out of Baywatch . She has shuttled her silly but ultimately open-minded protagonists from Amritsar, India, to London to Los Angeles and back again. In the script Chadha wrote with Paul Mayeda Berges, she has made sharp jokes about aggressively yuppie expat Indian men who follow the money to the U.S. but shop for an arranged marriage to a subservient, exportable wife back home, as well as goofy comments about modern electronic communication even among traditional Indian families. (One sister says of another, ''She's spending all night texting voice.'')
At under two hours, the movie is easily less than half the length of a true Bollywood production. The acting is broad, the dance numbers are hybridized, and the musical numbers are tricked out with such disposable lyrics as ''I just wanna man who gives some back/Who talks to me and not my rack.'' Yet rather than detracting, the phosphorescent artificial fibers of the material shape up into their own optimistic whole cloth. Before her hit Beckham  (where she overshot her multiculti goal with all that heavy-footed girls-and-sports politicking), Chadha tried but couldn't quite shape her passion for ethnic mÃ©lange into a satisfying experience in the unwieldy 2000 comedy What's Cooking?  With the Bollywood language of Bride & Prejudice , the filmmaker has devised a delightful interpretation of Austen's wise observation: ''For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?''

he pitch meeting for the new British movie "Bride and Prejudice" must have been a killer: "Jane Austen's novel 'Pride and Prejudice' - you know, the dead chick that wrote that Gwyneth Paltrow movie 'Enya,' 'Emma,' whatever - done like a Bollywood musical, only shorter." Then again, because the director Gurinder Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism - her last feature was "Bend It Like Beckham" - the actual pitch was probably cannier, something along the lines of: "Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy. I think we can get Ashanti for one of the numbers." Whatever the case, "Bride and Prejudice" - which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles - is as high concept and rife with clichï¿½ as anything ever churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimonious political correctness. Think "My Big Fat Sari Wedding" tricked out with putatively exotic locales and clumsy song-and-dance numbers, and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, originally called Elizabeth, here called Lalita (the Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her reflexive high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American hotel heir, Will Darcy (Martin Henderson, just inert). For those who have never read Austen's satiric comedy of manners or watched one of the many large-and-small-screen adaptations, including the 1940 charmer with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, the story involves two lovers who don't at first know they were made for each other. In the screenplay written by Ms. Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges (her husband), Lalita takes an almost instantaneous dim view of Darcy following some strategic miscommunication. Given that Darcy does little initially other than ooze hauteur, her prejudice against his pride seems justifiable. But the more this petulant beauty finds fault with her would-be love interest, the less sympathetic she seems, largely because such complaints ring hollow from a woman who wears her own entitlement as casually as a silk wrap. Although she doesn't appear to have a job, Lalita does have a gaggle of marriageable sisters, an unsuitable suitor (Nitin Ganatra) and a talent for emotional complication. Alternately intrigued and irritated by Darcy, Lalita parries and thrusts, and even scores a few bloodless hits. ("I thought we got rid of imperialists like you!") Midway through all this romantic storm and stress, a challenger materializes (Daniel Gillies), rising up from the ocean without a shirt or portfolio. And, of course, every so often, someone breaks into ragged song and dance. Depending on your appetite for kitsch, the highlight or nadir of Ms. Chadha's attempt to pay homage to Bollywood is an accidental showstopper featuring the singer Ashanti and some oiled musclemen who bring a little Las Vegas magic to the beaches of Goa. A few years ago, Ms. Chadha managed to squeeze a modest winner from "Bend It Like Beckham," an ingratiating trifle that made it to the big screen through a timely combination of girls' soccer, a salable vision of multiculturalism and the fact that the film's co-star, Keira Knightley, has lips as protuberant as the front bumper on a 1955 Chrysler station wagon. Since then, Ms. Knightley has gone Hollywood, while Ms. Chadha has delivered yet another movie with unassailable ideas (tolerance good; money, too) and an unfortunate absence of discernible filmmaking talent. With "Bride and Prejudice" Ms. Chadha also manages to make hash of a classic of literature and one of the world's leading film genres, which is almost as neat a double trick as a heroine who can have her sanctimony and eat her wedding cake, too. "Bride and Prejudice" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film contains some chaste romancing, some naked and ripped  male torsos and a Harvey Weinstein cameo.

Austen nuts may rend their frocks, and Bollywood buffs may split their cholis
, but there's an immensely likable, almost goofily playful charm to "Bride & Prejudice" that finally wins the day. Toplined by a spirited performance from young diva Aishwarya Rai, and largely played with gusto by an Indian cast marbled with Westerners, this modern, East-meets-West riff on Jane Austen's 19th-century classic delights in setting itself up as a target for cultural purists but triumphs with its devil-may-care, good-humored fun. Energetic promo could reap tasty returns, riding on helmer Gurinder Chadha's rep following "Bend It Like Beckham."
Pic went out day-and-date in the U.K. and India on Oct. 8. Stateside, "Bride" is slated to walk up the Gotham aisle Dec. 24.
Anyone expecting fidelity to Austen's classic would be better advised to re-rent the 1995 touchstone BBC miniseries, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth -- or maybe wait until Universal/Working Title's traditional, if youth-skewed version, with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, due out next year. And auds primed for a pure slice of mainstream Indian cinema (Bollywood or Tollywood) should instead check out an earlier Austen makeover, "Kandukondain kandukondain" (2000), Rajiv Menon's delish Tamil version of "Sense and Sensibility," coincidentally also co-starring Rai.
In plotting and social complexities, Chadha and scriptwriting partner Paul Mayeda Berges give a token nod to Austen's novel. Stylistically, the movie inhabits a cultural sphere that, like the London-raised Punjabi helmer herself, is absolutely its own, infused with a love of the conventions of mainstream Indian cinema but packaged with an NRI's sensibilities and affinityfor British sitcom characters.
Former Oxford U. chums Will Darcy (Kiwi-born Martin Henderson, with an American accent) and Raj (Naveen Andrews) arrive in Amritsar, Punjab, to attend a pre-wedding party of one of Raj's friends. Also in attendance are kindly Mr. Bakshi (Anupam Kher), his motormouth, social-climbing wife (Nadira Babbar), and their four daughters, Lalita (Rai), Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar, quietly classy), Maya (Meghnaa) and Lucky (perky Peeya Rai Choudhuri).Workaholic businessman-cum-uneasy Yank abroad, Will meets Lalita at the party, but she finds him arrogant and cold. As the pic swings into a typical boys vs. girls musical number -- smoothly staged, but neither mounted nor cut like a real Bollywood extravaganza -- the banal, flowery lyrics are translated for Will by Raj's sister, a cynical, well-heeled NRI.
Having prepped the viewer that this is to be a part-outsider's view of India and its social conventions, Chadha takes her biggest gamble of all, a colorful, large-scale street number ("A Marriage Has Come to Town") with -- wait for it -- English rhyming lyrics. It's a jolt that requires a leap of faith by any audience, either Western or Eastern.
Dialogue in these early reels is choppy, with Will and Lalita trading cultural cliches. Lalita accuses Will of wanting to turn her country into a tourist theme park, and the story moves south to Goa, where Will is mulling a hotel purchase and Lalita has tagged along on her father's urging.
Enter Johnny Wickham (Daniel Gillies), an old "friend" of Will's with an apparent grudge, who starts chatting up Lalita as she strums her guitar on the beach. She invites him to visit her in Amritsar, which he does, but mom has already lined up a gross Hollywood NRI as a prospective husband.
With Will still on the sidelines, the increasingly outrageous plot -- more Bollywood than Austen -- swings through the U.K. and L.A., back to London and finally to Amritsar.
It's only when the cultural grandstanding is out of the way that the film slowly starts to work its magic, starting with a spirited sisters-in-pajamas pop-rock number ("No Life Without Wife"), straight out of a Broadway musical. Thereafter, the musical interludes run the spectrum, from a percussive gharbah
 number in which Lalita and Johnny display apparent attraction, to a nutty fantasy duet which melds locations in L.A., London and India, including a burst of American gospel.
None of this would remotely work without the ensemble cast which, led by the stunning Rai at her most relaxed, enters into the souffle-ish spirit. As the antsy Mrs. Bakshi, forever trying to marry off her daughters, Babbar is a Bollywood mom crossed with a sitcom Indian from "Beckham," while fellow vet Kher is quietly aces as her patient husband. The sisters blend together well, with girlish Choudhuri getting the most substantial role as the Johnny-struck Lucky.
Of the two Western leads, Gillies is the more involving, making the elusive Johnny a likable figure. Technically the male lead, Henderson is good-looking but unengaging as Will, though in a film centered on the power of sisterhood and the Indian matriarchy, he's almost a supporting character, requiring little of the sexual charisma of Austen's Mr. Darcy.
On a tech level, this is Chadha's smoothest production, showing a command of widescreen that's surprisingly confident in comparison with her previous, more TV-style pics. Costuming and production design are bright and marginally gawdy, fitting the movie's generous-hearted, almost sophomoric tone.

Every so often, the unseen managers of the galaxy bestow on us mere mortals a vision of rare incongruous beauty: a solar eclipse, a streaking comet, a shooting star, Bollywood goddess Aishwarya Rai  happily riding a tractor. Treasured moments from the golden age of the Soviet musical may dance in stricken viewers' heads, but Bride and Prejudice is of course an update of Jane Austen 's marriage comedy adapted to the B-wood commandments, including irregularly scheduled song-and-dance interludes, kaleidoscopically hued art design, and strictly no kissing on the lips.
Rai is Lalita Bakshi , the most outspoken and stouthearted among several marriageable daughters of an unerringly wonderful dad and a shrill, meddlesome mom (a parental schema familiar from Gurinder Chadha 's previous film, Bend It Like Beckham ). Will Darcy (Martin Henderson ), scion of a Hilton-like family, arrives in town aiming to plunk down a luxury hotel in modest Amritsar Â"Hicksville , India," as the spoiled brat rechristens the Bakshi family seat. As in any classical rom-com, Lalita and Will's instant mutual loathing predicts a lifetime of passionate compatibility, as when Will asks the lady to dance at a wedding and sweetens the deal with a scooping motion of his filthy-rich American groin.
The alluring snob Darcy is a tough, contradictory role: Colin Firth  pulled it off in the BBC  treatment of Pride and Prejudice  and the first Bridget Jones   film through an unshakably deadpan inscrutability, but the uneasy Henderson is cut from the John Corbett  mold of bland requisite love interest. What does Lalita see in himÂoh, right, we forgot. Money can't buy happiness, but as Bride and Prejudice  teaches us, it can get patience in bulk from a smart young woman of a practical mind-set.
