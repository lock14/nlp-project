XXX is dead; long live XXX. Xander Cage, the former superagent-badass of 2002�s Rob Cohen-directed XXX
, has been killed in the line of kickassery, and so NSA spookster Augustus Gibbons (a scarified Jackson) recruits one of his old Navy Seal buddies to be the new XXX. (The cause of death remains unexplained here, but I like to imagine the swarthy Agent Cage was devoured by a mechanical shark piloted by Captain Nemo while parasailing the Matterhorn in the nude. While on fire.) Wouldn�t you know, it turns out to be Ice Cube�s Darius Stone, who�s spent the last nine years sitting in the brig for his pesky attitude problems. This film has attitude problems, too, chief among them being a penchant for over-the-top action set-pieces that come so fast and so furious that it�s a wonder you don�t have whiplash by film�s end. Normally I�d say that�s a good thing, but XXX: State of the Union
 just doesn�t know when to kick things down a notch, and so you exit the theatre suspecting you�ve just watched one of the slyest action parodies in ages. The feeling is only heightened when you consider State of the Union
 against Tamahori�s wrenching breakout film, the emotionally riveting Maori tale Once Were Warriors
, which is about as far afield from this explosions-and-testosterone shebang-bang as you could possibly fathom. The plot has Stone and Scott Speakman�s smooth white-guy agent attempting to curtail a bloody coup on the White House by the secretary of state (Dafoe, and any administration that places Dafoe in their cabinet � unless it�s a display cabinet, and he�s stuffed and mounted, of course � deserves all the coups they�re likely to get, but here all are oblivious to the jingoistic whackjob until it�s far too late). Not so late that Stone and company can�t have a ball with some of the film�s well-integrated CGI effects, which include a zippy battle on top of and aboard the presidential bullet train (!) and wealth of painfully gorgeous � not to mention pricey � automobiles getting blown all to hell. James Bond for a new generation was how the original XXX
 was marketed. Even that ridiculous film was ridiculously fun, thanks in large part to the gravelly cipher Vin Diesel and the lovely Euro-bomb Asia Argento (daughter of Italian filmmaker Dario). State of the Union
, while an exciting enough diversion for a lazy Saturday afternoon popcorn fix, is really 10 times too much, a nonstop orgy of bullets, bombs, and booty that aims low and hits the bull�s-eye with enough firepower to sink the Bismarck
. On the plus side, Samuel L. Jackson looks like he�s trying to stifle a giggle-fit half the time. So will you.


There are really only two kinds of big-budget action movies: stupid, and good and stupid. Surprisingly, "XXX: State of the Union" is good and stupid, which makes it an immediate improvement over 2002's meatheaded "XXX." The difference between sequel and original is exactly the difference between Ice Cube and Vin Diesel.
Well, that's not exactly true. "XXX: State of the Union" also has a more loopily enjoyable B-movie plot, some impressively ridiculous stunts, a serious car fetish, and a racial chip on its shoulder that breathes interesting new life into the old macho cliches. This is, quite intentionally, a Bond movie reconfigured to play in the 'hood. (No surprise, director Lee Tamahori helmed the last 007 installment.) Luckily, "XXX" doesn't turn Ice Cube into an action figure so much as bring the action genre to Ice Cube.
Still, it remains profoundly dumb stuff, bent on pleasing an audience for whom the bigger the explosion the better. The mayhem starts with an assault on an underground defense department bunker near Washington, D.C. Top dog Augustus Givens (a returning Samuel L. Jackson) needs a new "extreme agent" to get to the bottom of it, and since the news comes in that Diesel's Xander Cage has been killed in Bora Bora (sounds of cheers from the back row), Givens goes with his ex-Navy Seal comrade Darius Stone (Ice Cube).
First, however, the spymaster has to get Stone out of military prison, where he has served 10 years for leading a mutiny against his commanding general in Kosovo. Just so you know, that same general, Deckard, had ordered the death of innocent civilians, is currently the Secretary of Defense, is played by Willem Dafoe, and since Dafoe doesn't bother to show up for Hollywood studio movies these days unless he can ooze evil from his follicles, well, you can see where this is going. Especially since the US president is played by Peter Strauss as a somewhat less impactful John Kerry.
But all this is an excuse to get Stone back to his stomping grounds in southeast D.C., where he visits a chop shop manned by rapper Xzibit and -- of course! -- a crew of scantily clad female automotive experts. The true car junkie is Stone's ex-girlfriend Lola (Nona Gaye), who has moved uptown and is selling half-million-dollar Shelby Cobra concept cars to senators who never get out of first gear. Both Stone and the movie seem much more interested in the automobiles than the women, though, which is in keeping with the teenboy-friendly PG-13 rating. The Cobra, the modified 1967 GTO muscle car, and the Ford
 150 urban assault vehicle all have more personality than Lola.
Eventually, Stone works his way up to commandeering a tank on top of an aircraft carrier, gleefully bobbing and weaving as Deckard's men fire away at their own artillery. And there's a bit with an inflatable motorboat driving up a ramp, onto a bridge and on top of a police car that defies belief even as you're hooting in destructo adolescent delight. By contrast, a climactic chase and fight scene on the president's personal bullet train leans too heavily on CGI animation and the movie "Speed." By that point, it doesn't matter who the star is -- the action-movie machinery has taken over.
Until then, Ice Cube has managed to stay himself. The actor has bulked up but not to the point of freakishness, and he smartly lets the film edit around him during the melees. Why is his sullen, weary hostility more palatable than Vin Diesel's? Simple: Ice Cube doesn't smirk, and he wears his grievances as though he has earned them. That may merely be a matter of persona -- Ice Cube has been a well-paid star for more than 15 years now -- but, as with all true movie stars, the persona is vivid enough to trump reality.
As for the rest of the cast, Jackson's Givens comes and goes, sometimes not of his own free will, and Michael Roof reprises his role as Tobey, the yuppie-nerd gadget geek from the first film. Scott Speedman, former boy-hunk of TV's "Felicity," pops up as Kyle Steele (how come no one in these movies is ever named Bob Cottonball?), an NSA agent who suspects Stone might not be the crazed terrorist Deckard insists he is. There's also a lissome blonde senatorial aide named Charlie (Sunny Mabrey), with whom Stone nervously flirts before backing down. This has nothing to do with the character's professed black pride and everything to do with the movie's box-office prospects in the deep south and overseas.
In other respects, "XXX" meets Hip-Hop Nation a little more than halfway, and its patriotism is amusingly conflicted. "The fate of the free world's in the hands of a bunch of hustlers and thieves," says someone as Stone's impromptu homeboy army prepares to go into battle against Deckard's troops. "Why should tonight be any different?" responds Stone. But revolution isn't really on this movie's mind. Yes, the President of the United States quotes Tupac, but the soundtrack version of Public Enemy's "Fight the Power" is by the heavy-metal-bonehead band Korn, and it sounds very much like corporate business as usual.

         Revolution Studios needn't have worried that Vin Diesel would not be doing the sequel to the 2002 hit "XXX," because Ice Cube proves up to the task in "XXX: State of the Union." Cube has always been a natural in front of a camera, and he's as much at ease as a daring action star as he has been of late in comedies. "State of the Union" opens explosively and never lets up, with Lee Tamahori ("Die Another Day") in full command of the action and Simon Kinberg an equally astute writer with a flair for linking socko action set pieces with terse characterization and a sure sense of topicality. The film's makers understand in the post-9/11 world that it can seem just about anything might be possible, taking full advantage of the likelihood that the faster the pace the less implausible a movie will seem.
 
  Black-masked and body-suited troops invade the National Security Agency's top-secret headquarters hidden deep below a Charlottesville, Va., horse farm and take out 16 agents. Agency head Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes he is in dire need of another XXX, who has been killed off between movies. Gibbons suspects the assailants were sent by a secret, radical faction within the government and clearly pose a threat to the president (Peter Strauss), a liberal who wants to end the government's isolationist policy and heavy defense spending in favor of strengthening diplomatic ties around the world.
 


         






    The man for the job is a decorated special ops soldier, Darius Stone (Ice Cube), who happens to be in a military prison for striking a superior officer, which is not so much a problem as an opportunity for Gibbons to spring Darius, breaking several federal laws in the process. Alas, the extremely militarist secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe) soon has Gibbons and his cohorts locked up themselves.
 
  Darius is now left to his own devices to prevent the overthrow of the U.S. government, but even he will need help: Gibbons' gadget expert (Michael Roof); suave FBI agent Kyle Steele (Scott Speedman); his sultry former girlfriend Lola (Nona Gaye), proprietor of a high-end custom car business; and his pal Zeke (Xzibit), who runs a chop shop and just happens to have access to an amazing array of weaponry and personnel. "XXX2" is now geared up for an intricate, stunningly staged climax, a bold instance of the fantastic made jarringly realistic, which characterizes the entire film — and what makes it exhilarating as entertainment.

n the new wildly silly action flick "XXX: State of the Union," all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (n� O'Shea Jackson). Having slid, skied and snowboarded into unconscious parody in the first "XXX," a deeply silly movie predicated on the laughable but (who knew?) nonetheless lucrative idea of Vin Diesel as Extreme Bond, the producing team behind this new entertainment has apparently decided that the only place to go with the sequel is over the top - way over the top. And so over the top they all merrily go, on their way to one spectacular splat landing. Ever since Sean Connery hung up his tuxedo and Walther,   after his last outing as James Bond in the early 1980's, filmmakers have tried to refurbish the superspy with new, unimproved weaponry, innumerable gimmicks and vixens. With the exception of the two "Bourne" films, the cinematic results have been generally less than super, largely because the people who make these kinds of movies tend to just pump up the volume and ignore story and character. (British television does much better by spies.) The makers of "State of the Union" subscribe to the Jerry Bruckheimer big-bang theory of action (big, bigger, biggest), but they don't share that maestro's attention to detail, or apparently his deep pockets. The state of this cinematic union is shabby indeed. So is the nitwit story. Ice Cube plays Darius Stone, a former member of the Navy Seals turned special-ops warrior with precisely two expressions: a raised-left-eyebrow sneer and a raised-right-eyebrow sneer. Unjustly imprisoned, Stone is so tough that he even sneers, eyebrows arched with rage or possibly a little gas, when his old boss comes to spring him. The would-be liberator is the National Security Agency contact, Gibbons, who put the first XXX operative through his paces. (Because Mr. Diesel either declined to make the sequel or was forcibly recused, the first agent has since mysteriously expired.) Played by Samuel L. Jackson, doing his familiar tough-guy thing without shame and with no evident enthusiasm, Gibbons tosses Stone back into the fray to put the kibosh on a treasonous plot engineered by the Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe). Despite the strenuous efforts of the director, Lee Tamahori, who with "Die Another Day" injected a little oomph into the James Bond franchise, "State of the Union" isn't - surprise, surprise - about fascistic cabinet members, American policies or anything remotely connected to the here and now. It's about bling, boom and boffo box office. It's also about boys and toys, which is fitting, given that the screenwriter, Simon Kinberg, one of Hollywood's newest go-to action guys (one of his gigs is the forthcoming "X-Men" movie), likes to interject cute phrases like "lock and load" and "rap and tap" into his mercilessly bad dialogue. It's also about casting actresses who are easily upstaged by their breasts, and young actors, like Scott Speedman, who look as if they should be warbling in a boy band rather than suiting up for the N.S.A. For his part, Ice Cube looks so sincere, kicking, punching and occasionally struggling through his vigorous paces, that it's a shame no one else in the movie seems similarly engaged. Graced with a moon face and a body that looks reassuringly lived-in, the affable actor has been a welcome presence in movies like "Barbershop," in which he projects a gruff decency at odds with the thug-posturing that defined his early rap persona. (Recently, he even branched out into family fare with the movie "Are We There Yet?") While he gives it his all, Ice Cube never seems like the right man for the job in "State of the Union," even if there is something surreally entertaining about the sight of him going mano � mano with Mr. Dafoe on a speeding presidential bullet train headed straight to, well, you know - home video. "XXX: State of the Union" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes dozens upon dozens of gun deaths, violent hand combat, perilously exposed bosoms and crude adult language.

You'd half expect the Xbox logo to pop up on the credit roll for "XXX: State of the Union," since what's on view is closer to a videogame than a movie. While that will be music to the ears of young gamers, it's noise to anyone hoping for a coherent action movie along the lines of the franchise's first pic, starring Vin Diesel. With Ice Cube as the new XXX, street cred replaces extreme sports. But with other tentpoles and Darth Vader in the wings, it will take more than a few B.O. smackdowns for this one to reach the original's $276 global cume. 
Devotees of the franchise learned on the "XXX" vid that Diesel's character was offed in, of all places, Bora Bora. Judging by Cube's ridiculous resilience here, this dude will be a whole lot harder to snuff. After a black-ops unit penetrates an NSA compound, Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson, back in the proverbial saddle) realizes he needs a fresh XXX "with more attitude." Bring on Cube's Darius Stone, a Navy Seals ace under Gibbons during a failed operation that led to Stone's court martial and landed him in prison. The price of his freedom is apparently having to deal with the geekiness of Gibbons' techie, Toby (Michael Roof), who seems to be around this time to act like the clueless white guy.
Gibbons and Stone, not knowing who's causing trouble to the Republic, have much poking around to do. This includes Stone running aimlessly through NSA hallways, arranging for tricked-up super trucks from sexy mechanic Lola (Nona Gaye) and turning a deluxe Sea Doo into a missile. With Gibbons apparently killed in a house explosion by nefarious right-wing Defense Secretary George Deckert (Willem Dafoe), and with Stone hoodwinked by blonde bombshell Charlie (Sunny Mabrey), who's working for Deckert, things are looking bad.
Disguised as a waiter during a cocktail party, Stone overhears Deckert's planned White House coup, and director Lee Tamahori dips into his experience helming Bond pics for some clever intrigue. It's sustained, momentarily, with Stone's testy dealings with upright NSA agent Kyle Steele (Scott Speedman).
The rest of the time, though, Tamahori seems to want to turn this "XXX" edition into a comedy, but with a blueprint from busy tyro screenwriter Simon Kinberg (who also has this summer's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" and "The Fantastic Four" on his resume), the plot seems like a fusion of a teen boy's idea of how the government operates and a half-jokey, half-cracked Tom Clancy retread. To believe Deckert as war chief to Peter Strauss' liberal President Sanford is to allow Richard Perle as secretary of defense to, say, a President Dennis Kucinich.
The only thing that really matters is whether the action scenes push the envelope -- and they don't, especially compared with the extreme sports style of the first "XXX." The current pic's sequences, full of bulky military hardware, bang and lumber rather than fly and astonish, with a finale that serves as a poor tribute to the climax of "Air Force One," featuring yet another president hanging on for dear life at the end of an airborne tether.
If Cube had funnier lines, rather than the risible innuendo he must exchange with Gaye, he would have been able to pour on the charm he's displayed before. Apparently cast for his Rushmore-like jaw, Strauss has little else to offer as president.
More than any other production contributor, stunt coordinator R. A. Rondell labors above and beyond the call of duty, while composer Marco Beltrami apparently has never heard a fortissimo he doesn't like.

The film, which exerts the gross-out fascination of reality TV's muckier specimens, has nothing new to say about America's fast-food addiction and obesity epidemic, but there's no denying its grotesque effectiveness as a work of public health advocacy. Fighting grease with grease, it's a film that has its severely taxed heart in the right place. LIM

Gigantic, blustery, and stuffed with cameoed details (Cate Blanchett 's riff on Katharine Hepburn  makes her the dead legend's avatar), it's a biopic paradigmand an American-dream-gone-rancid tale bidding to complement Raging Bull .
