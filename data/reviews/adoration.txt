Atom Egoyan's latest glum puzzle is a meditation on post-9/11 hysteria, but it's too much What's the meaning of terrorism?  cud chewing too late. In Toronto, a teenager (Devon Bostick) stands before a high school class and pretends that his  father was a terrorist who tried (and failed) to use his wife to blow up an airplane. There  is much else in Adoration  (a fatal car crash, angry ranting on video chat rooms), but the upshot is that those who appear to be guilty may not be  a muddled  message for our time.

 In “Adoration,” a profound and provocative exploration of cultural inheritance, communications technology and the roots and morality of terrorism, the Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan nimbly wades into an ideological minefield without detonating an explosion.  Its story of a high school class assignment that becomes a minor cause célèbre is a rigorously structured variant of the everything-is-connected-to-everything school of filmmaking that has produced movies like “Babel” and “Crash.”  But unlike those movies “Adoration,” Mr. Egoyan’s finest film since “The Sweet Hereafter” (1997), doesn’t strain to maintain a pretense of naturalism. In every scene you feel the controlling hand of Mr. Egoyan who wrote, produced and directed it. Its characters’ burning passions are attached to symbols — a violin scroll, Christmas ornaments, old photographs, a lawn display of the Nativity, a beaded Islamic veil — that have the mystique of sacred relics to the people who possess them.  This meticulously assembled montage weaves flashbacks and fantasies into an enthralling story of a boy’s search for the truth surrounding his parents’ deaths in a car crash years earlier. Repeated scenes show the boy, Simon (Devon Bostick), interviewing his dying grandfather Morris (Kenneth Welsh) in a hospital via video cellphone about the circumstances of their deaths.  Simon’s imagination is also enflamed by a true story read in a high school class in Toronto by Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian), his French and drama teacher, who is Lebanese, about a terrorist who secreted explosives in the luggage of his pregnant girlfriend, who was traveling to Israel. The bomb was confiscated by Israeli security before it went off.  The story is based on a real incident in 1986, in which a Jordanian terrorist secreted a bomb in the hand luggage of his pregnant Irish girlfriend without her knowledge on an El Al flight from London to Israel. Had it exploded, 380 passengers would have died.  Morris, who despised his Lebanese son-in-law, Sami (Noam Jenkins), a luthier, leads his grandson to believe Sami deliberately crashed the car that killed his daughter (Simon’s mother) Rachel (Rachel Blanchard), a gifted violinist. Morris’s account has so tainted his grandson’s memory of his father that it easy for the boy to imagine that he is the son of the couple in the news story.  Sabine encourages him write it as a piece of fiction and present it to the class as a true story. He agrees, then takes it a step further and relates it via Webcam in Internet chat rooms where it kicks up a storm of debate among his peers and their parents.  Simon lives with his uncle, Tom (Scott Speedman), a tow-truck driver, who has inherited Morris’s hatred of Middle Eastern people. Tom is confronted with his prejudice when a mysterious woman in a beaded veil visits the house and asks pointed personal questions about his beliefs.  The words Christian, Jew and Muslim are never attached to the characters. Mr. Egoyan’s refusal to push those verbal buttons forces you to view the characters as human beings without labels and to draw your own conclusions about their cultural backgrounds.  If the plot outline of “Adoration” suggests a clanking mechanism that defies credibility and logic (especially a subplot involving Tom’s tow truck), to watch the movie is to be caught up in a detective story that operates on several levels. Mr. Egoyan conveys a voluptuous, slightly sinister apprehension of the material world in which people harbor secrets, and blind rage can suddenly erupt in the most placid setting for no apparent reason. Here the possibility of violence rears up in a shabby restaurant when three people argue over a sandwich that has just been consumed.  The lurking violence in “Adoration” coincides with scenes of ravishing beauty: Rachel playing the violin at the end of a pier overlooking a river while Sami observes her adoringly from afar; the wooden pieces of a Nativity  being tossed into a fire along with a cellphone in which the image of a person fades from a likeness into digital rectangles, until the device itself begins to crumple.  As always in Mr. Egoyan’s films, technology has a life of it own. Wondrous but also scary, it has the potential to warp reality and to release demonic forces.  During Simon’s science-fiction-like chat sessions his computer screen divides into as many as nine squares; in each you see a different talking head; an old woman who survived a concentration camp bares her tattoo; a Holocaust-denying skinhead shows his pen-and-ink scrawled statement of disbelief. Does the technology unite us? Or are we blindly trapped inside our own squares?  The binding ingredient of “Adoration” is its rich, violin-soaked musical soundtrack by Mychael Danna. Its mood of sorrowful sensuality evokes the troubled histories of flesh-and-blood people whose complicated personal stories, if we knew them, might  or might  not provide reasons for heinous crimes against humanity.  The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and mild violence.

Atom Egoyan's "Adoration" is a fascinating muddle. Folding all sorts of post-9/11 questions -- about the ethics of terrorism, the deceptiveness of outward appearances, the ways technology can enable dialogue yet hinder the truth -- into a very Egoyanesque miasma of elegantly fractured chronology and provocative ideas, this ambitious think-piece ultimately smothers its good intentions in didactic revelations, earnest pleading and incessant violin music. Engrossing nonetheless, the story of a high schooler troubled by his parents' legacy reps one of the Canadian writer-director's most accessible efforts, but without unanimous critical adoration, Sony Classics pickup won't get much B.O. love.
In keeping with his recent pattern of alternating literary adaptations with original material, "Adoration" resembles 2005's novel-based "Where the Truth Lies" (among other Egoyan films) in the way it tantalizingly doles out narrative information across multiple time frames and perspectives.
Impetus for the drama is a news story about a terrorist who planted a bomb in the luggage of his pregnant girlfriend, who didn't realize what she was carrying until she was stopped by security agents before boarding a flight to Israel. After high school teacher Sabine (Arsinee Khanjian) reads the story to her students, one of them, Simon (Devon Bostick), imagines himself to be the girlfriend's now-grown child, and writes a piece expressing ambivalent feelings toward the father who almost ended his life before it even began.
For reasons that only become clear later, Sabine convinces Simon to present his work to the class as fact, not fiction -- easily managed, as Simon's parents are both dead and he now lives with his unhappy uncle, Tom (Scott Speedman). Faux flashbacks show Simon's mother Rachel (Rachel Blanchard) and Lebanese father Sami (Noam Jenkins), clearly in love even as Sami makes arrangements for Rachel's fateful, solitary trip to the Holy Land.
Simon takes the deception further by airing his musings in video chat sessions, where they are commented on in turn by his classmates and, eventually, their parents and other adults. Presented as an online chorus of arguments on such issues as whether martyrdom (or in this case, martyring your loved ones) could ever be considered heroic, the responses Simon gets are understandably heated. They're also unpersuasively long-winded, seeming to take place in a world where people have nothing better to do than pontificate angrily at their Webcams.
Though Egoyan is clearly intrigued by the potential uses and abuses of technology (a theme that dates as far back as his '80s catalog, including 1989's "Speaking Parts"), he abandons these notions in favor of an odd dramatic thrust, as Sabine pursues a meeting with Tom and asks meddlesome questions about how Simon's parents died. This and other secrets are revealed in a succession of dramatic turns and coincidences, all accompanied by the keening strings of Mychael Danna's intriguingly dissonant but much-overplayed score (a problem carried over from "Where the Truth Lies").
As ever, it's hard not to respect the sheer number of ideas, concerns and subtexts Egoyan touches on, from the difficulty of cross-cultural communication to the human tendency to construct alternate realities and identities. While the script steers clear of the minefield of Mideast politics, it foregrounds the three major Western religions throughout, not least in the way it conflates pregnant Rachel's trip to Israel with the story of Jesus' birth.
But the common charge against Egoyan, that he's more intellectual than dramatist, holds true here, in a film too contrived and prone to spelling itself out to achieve the catharsis it strains for at the end. Khanjian, the helmer's wife and ensemble regular, is given one blunt speech after another as the talkative prof who's either a bold provocateur or a few sheep short of a nativity scene.
Bostick is nicely cast as a smart, prickly student with a lot of questions, though his Simon, for all his reckless actions, turns out to be a mere pawn in a grandiose narrative scheme. Speedman and Blanchard, both known for their work on teen skeins, deliver subtle, affecting work, as does Jenkins as a much-misunderstood dad.
Tech package is excellent, distinguished by Paul Sarossy's moodily underlit lensing and editor Susan Shipton's fluid juggling act.


Atom Egoyan 's 12th feature film offers a typically kaleidoscopic rumination on voyeurism, videography, the relative nature of truth, and the aftermath of tragedy. It's closer in form and tone to the Canadian auteur's early work (particularly his 1987 masterpiece Family Viewing ) than to his erratic recent literary adaptations (Felicia's Journey , Where the Truth Lies ). Egoyan's wife and frequent muse, Arsinée Khanjian , occupies the central role here as a high school French and drama teacher who encourages a bright pupil (Devon Bostick ) in an elaborate fabrication. Inspired by a classroom translation of a news article about a Jordanian man who attempted to blow up a commercial airliner with a bomb hidden in his pregnant girlfriend's luggage, the boy claims the story as that of his own deceased parents—a lie that quickly goes viral and takes on even more bizarre dimensions when the teacher (for reasons Egoyan holds close to the vest for most of the running time), disguised in a face-covering burka, pays a house call on her student and his blue-collar uncle (an excellent Scott Speedman ). Never short on ambition, Adoration  has no lack of interesting things to say or interesting ways to say them, but the longer it runs, the more you feel Egoyan working up a sweat to deploy the same effects—Pinterian abstractions, fractured timelines, shifting points of view—that he once made seem effortless. The end result is a movie considerably more absorbing to talk, write, and think about afterward than it is to actually watch.
