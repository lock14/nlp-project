The initial concept for Gracie
 was developed by Andrew Shue and director Guggenheim (the Oscar-winning director of An Inconvenient Truth
), who were Inspired by the true story of the Shue family (Elisabeth and Andrew both act in the film, while Elisabeth's husband Guggenheim directs). Doubtless resulting from their effort to honor the family�s story, the film is earnest and loving. But unfortunately, earnest and loving doesn�t equal a good movie. The story centers on the Bowens, a working-class family living in South Orange, New Jersey, in 1978. Dad (Mulroney), a former soccer star-turned-obsessive dad, is consumed with training his three boys to play his beloved game. Meanwhile, the women in the family, consisting of mom (Elisabeth Shue) and Gracie (Schroeder), get shoved to the sidelines. Eldest son, Johnny (Soffer), is the star of his high school soccer team and his prowess on the field is surpassed only by a saintlike devotion to his sister, Gracie. A bit of a tomboy, or in movie language: a soccer star in the rough, Gracie is repeatedly shut out of her father�s backyard training sessions. Boys only. With its atmosphere of suburban late Seventies teenage angst, the film feels a bit like an episode of Freaks & Geeks
 and at this point poses some real promise. When Johnny is killed in a car accident, the family�s world is destroyed. Guggenheim shows a deft skill at dramatizing the damage of a family coping with loss. Moments resonate with a real beauty and artful honesty. But sadly, the storytelling doesn�t hold up to the promise of these first 20 minutes. Clunky transitions and contrived melodrama propel the movie along as the family begin their individual mourning processes. Gracie starts sneaking out at night and wearing short skirts. Her father is so lost in his misery that he remains oblivious to her rebellion while her overworked mother struggles vainly to keep the family together. Then, in an awkward yet predictable turn of events, Gracie decides she�s going to play soccer in her brother�s place. But it�s 1978! Women don�t play soccer! The bulk of the film becomes a back-and-forth between Gracie and her father as she attempts to train for team tryouts and he struggles to realize that three of his kids are still alive and he should maybe start paying them some attention. There�s a lot of angry prejudice toward women playing soccer in the film, and a semi-fun Footloose
-esque scene in which Gracie petitions the school board for the freedom to play. But melodrama reigns supreme as the film disintegrates into movie-of-the-week predictability.


The 16-year-old actress Carly Schroeder has a stare that could burn through stone or the heart of a soccer referee. She's a blond bruiser in an industry that celebrates sylphs and sticks, but for much of "Gracie, " the title character can't throw her weight around the way she knows she was meant to. So Schroeder stares and seethes, until the other characters catch fire.
"Gracie" is an inspirational sports movie, soccer subdivision, and it stops at every expected station of the cross on its road to the triumphant against-all-odds finale (in sudden-death overtime, yet). Yet it also feels appealingly handmade in a way most jock dramas don't. It's a family affair about a family -- produced by and co-starring Elisabeth Shue ("Leaving Las Vegas" ) and her brother Andrew ("Melrose Place" ), directed by her husband Davis Guggenheim (who made the Al Gore documentary "An Inconvenient Truth") , and based, apparently, on some fairly heavy Shue clan lore.
Gracie Bowen (Schroeder) is the only girl in a family of boys, all soccer freaks under the stern guidance of their father, Bryan (Dermot Mulroney ). Is he a sports nazi? Well, yes. Do they love him for it? Yes, although varsity star oldest brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer ) is doing it more for dad than for love of the game.
Johnny dies in an auto accident, though -- his death is so baldly telegraphed that my own 12-year-old soccer player and I looked at each other in the dark and whispered "lunchmeat" -- and a crushed Gracie concocts a plan. She'll take Johnny's place on the field.
The year is 1978, the setting rough-and-tumble northern New Jersey, and the taunts are cruel. Even Gracie's father thinks it's a stupid idea. The most interesting part of "Gracie" is the long midsection in which the heroine is kept from playing and turns incoherent with sullen rebellion, cranking up the Thin Lizzy tunes and smoking cigarettes with dead-end eyes.
Eventually she gets her chance -- thank you Title IX and that nice lady on the school board -- but the grueling training (with dad) and try outs (with a disbelieving coach played by John Doman ) lead to brutish behavior from teammates like Kyle (Christopher Shand ), who can only conceive of Gracie as girlfriend material.
"Gracie," in other words, doesn't make it easy, and that's a change from the rote moves of films like 2005's glossy "Goal! " It's more working-class than "Bend It Like Beckham, " too -- not a feel-good movie but a desperate-to-feel-anything movie, at times nearly hysterical with adolescent yearning. Not for nothing does Bruce Springsteen's "Growing Up " keen repeatedly on the soundtrack.
For all the predictability (and you can set your watch by it), Schroeder roots the film with her glower; there's nothing actressy about her. Mulroney just about makes up for "Georgia Rule ." The more interesting performance, though, may be Elisabeth Shue's . She plays Gracie's mother, Lindsay , a school nurse who's the only non-jock in the bunch and who watches her only daughter move further and further away from her.
Lindsay gets a little speech in the film about this -- about how it's lonely to be a mother to such a family and how that's all right -- and you wonder how much of the actress's own mother is in that speech. According to the press notes, soccer runs in the Shue blood, Elisabeth broke local gender barriers by playing on boys' teams, and there was an older brother who died young. Even the movie's biggest metaphorical groaner, a wild kestrel kept in a cage and finally set free, is based on an actual bird.
To which the critic has to say: So what? Does "Gracie" work as a movie? Just close enough, and closer still for a young soccer player who may already know her sports movie clichés but also recognizes when they touch on something once and truly felt.


         A struggling teenage girl finds personal redemption through soccer in "Gracie," an earnest, well-acted, poignant drama that nevertheless runs afoul of sports movie clichés.
 
 Not that you can blame it for trying. The inspirational sports film, so inherently irresistible, has become such a cinema fixture that it has nearly lost its resonance; the prospect of breathing new life into the formula is virtually a Herculean task in itself. "Gracie's" road has been paved by the likes of "Rocky," "Rudy" and Ralph Macchio, and there will always be one more underdog trying to make good.
 


         






   Set in suburban New Jersey circa 1978, "Gracie" is, in large measure, the story of a girl's journey through grief. When her older brother, Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer), a high school soccer star, dies in a car accident, 15-year-old Gracie (Carly Schroeder) sinks into a deep depression.
 
 Already a skillful soccer player under Johnny's guidance, Gracie realizes that the path to her recovery involves the game they both loved. But without a girls' soccer league, Gracie resolves to earn a spot on the boys' team. Her announcement meets with disbelief from her mother (Elisabeth Shue), disapproval from her father (Dermot Mulroney), a firm refusal from the coach (John Doman) and, from the boys, the same sort of disdain that Demi Moore battled in "G.I. Jane."
 
 When Gracie sets off on a self-destructive course, however, her dad steps in to save her, insisting that he's "not going to lose another child." Under his rigorous coaching, Gracie improves her game enough to petition the school board to allow her a tryout. That school hearing offers Shue her best scene: Wobbly, emotional and a little inarticulate, she pleads for her daughter to be given a chance to fulfill her dream.
 
 It would be giving too much away to reveal what happens next, but it's safe to say that "Gracie" delivers where it is supposed to and mercifully avoids at least one predictable moment with an unexpected twist. Would that it had avoided others. In its visual composition and use of certain dramatic metaphors, "Gracie" has a tendency to underscore "big" moments in ways that don't always feel completely organic.
 
 Nevertheless, some creative choices do work: The film has a grainy, slightly low-resolution look that aptly evokes the era, as well as a particularly evocative soundtrack, including songs by Bruce Springsteen and Aretha Franklin. And the cast, headed by the rapidly maturing Schroeder ("Mean Creek"), is terrific across the board.
 
 What sets this film apart is that "Gracie" is an intensely personal project, inspired at least in part by events in the life of Shue and her family. As a girl in New Jersey, Shue played soccer on boys' teams and later lost her brother Will in an accident. Along with her other brother, Andrew, she's a credited producer on the film. Andrew, who also shares story credit and has a small role as an assistant coach, has played professional soccer. And Elisabeth's husband, Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth"), directed.
 
 With so much invested in this film, "Gracie" represents the culmination of a family dream, so you can't really blame it for wearing its heart on its sleeve.
 
 "Gracie." MPAA rating: PG-13 for brief sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. In general release.   

In 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel  it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family (Shue was one of the producers), tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for Heather Graham-cute Gracie (Carly Schroeder) to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie  as processed as an after-school special? You miss the knockabout edge of Bend It Like Beckham   though the ending, in its Pavlovian sports-flick way, pumps you up.

 A familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity, Davis Guggenheim’s “Gracie” depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school soccer team. Yet the movie’s follow-your-heart simplicity masks deeper concerns; like the recent “Flicka,” this perceptive family drama is really about a daughter’s struggle for her father’s attention.  The sole girl in a soccer-mad family, Grace Bowen (a wonderful Carly Schroeder), 15,  is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked. Her mother (Elisabeth Shue) is overprotective, and her father (Dermot Mulroney) — an ex-player freighted with his own childhood issues — is only interested in training his three sons. When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer.  Set in New Jersey in 1978 and based on events in Ms. Shue’s life, “Gracie” connects the adversity-drama dots — the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter — with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley’s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens.  “Gracie” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Characters fumble the ball and fumble with one another.

"Gracie" is the sort of formulaic, feel-good sports drama that requires collaborators on either side of the camera to be at the absolute top of their game to score any kind of impact. Unfortunately, this modestly engaging but thoroughly predictable Picturehouse release appears hopelessly outmatched by bigger and better-hyped competitors in the summer B.O. sweepstakes. Playoff potential may be brighter in the homevid arena if favorable word of mouth spreads.
Pic is something of a family affair, co-produced by helmer Davis Guggenheim -- director of the Oscar-winning docu "An Inconvenient Truth" -- with his actress wife, Elisabeth Shue, and actor brother-in-law, Andrew Shue. (Indie vet Lemore Syvan also shares producing credit.) The script by Lisa Marie Petersen and Karen Janszen is loosely based on a real-life tragedy -- specifically, the accidental death of William Shue, brother of Elisabeth and Andrew (and executive producer John Shue) -- but the film focuses primarily on an eponymous protagonist modeled after Elisabeth, who's effectively cast as the character's mother.
Despite all the factual underpinning, most of "Gracie" plays like conventional Hollywood-style contrivance. In 1978 South Orange, N.J., 15-year-old Gracie Bowen (Carly Schroeder) must overcome sexist mindsets, hidebound bureaucracy and -- initially, at least -- unsupportive parents as she sets out to replace her late brother on her high school varsity soccer team. Only auds not exposed to similar inspirational sports scenarios will doubt for a second that she'll eventually succeed.
On the plus side, up-and-comer Schroeder makes a winning impression as Gracie, a working-class rebel who tries to become a team player after her beloved brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer) -- a star athlete coached by his proud father -- dies in an auto accident. Thesp persuasively conveys her character's innate seriousness of purpose even when she's acting out, talking back and risking her virginity by vamping "older" (i.e., college-age) guys. Latter activity, though emotionally and dramatically credible, may unsettle some parents who'd otherwise consider the pic as family-friendly entertainment. 
At first, Bryan Bowen (Dermot Mulroney) refuses to train his daughter. He claims, unreasonably, that Gracie simply isn't tough enough to play with the boys. Lindsay (Elisabeth Shue), the teen's tradition-bound mom, attempts to douse Gracie's nascent feminism. ("Not everything is possible," Lindsay not-so-helpfully warns.) Even Jena (scene-stealing Julia Garro), Gracie's guy-crazy best friend, is outspokenly discouraging, noting that femme athletes their age are widely viewed as "lesbos." 
In the end, of course, everyone, even crusty Coach Colasanti (John Doman, who uncovers kernels of truth in a cliched role), becomes a believer just in time for Gracie to take part in a climactic match, a game that has at least a patina of verisimilitude thanks to soccer choreographer Dan Metcalfe. Mulroney is surprisingly affecting as he charts his character's gradual change of heart. 
Lenser Chris Manley, production designer Dina Goldman and costumer Elizabeth Caitlin Ward are most valuable players when it comes to sustaining period ambiance. Indeed, there are some scenes early on that actually look like they were excerpted from a pic produced during the Polyester Era. Soundtrack includes aptly chosen '70s pop tunes, with Aretha Franklin's "Rock Steady" imaginatively employed to underscore Gracie's grueling training regimen.
Closing credits, which proclaim "Gracie" is "a carbon neutral production," suggest director Guggenheim took Al Gore's green message to heart. 


In what could be construed as a very expensive home movie, the Shues (siblings Elisabeth and Andrew, of the proud glares and somewhat less reliable acting ability) rally to tell the story of how soccer saved a family in the wake of an eldest son's death. Directed by Davis Guggenheim  (An Inconvenient Truth ), Gracie  draws on several aspects of Shue family history, including the death of their older brother and Elisabeth's deter-mination to play soccer with the boys growing up in New Jersey in the '70s. The title character (Carly Schroeder ) idolizes older brother and soccer star Will, whose death sends her family, particularly father and coach (a valiant Dermot Mulroney ), into a tailspin. Gracie's dream is to play on her brother's soccer team and score the big goal for him, but the men (and The Man) have other ideas. Firing on all formulaic cylinders, Gracie  is heavy with tidy meaning and mealy morality; the most dubious idea here is that if you don't let a girl play soccer, she just may turn to cigarettes, halter tops, and sex with the starting forward.
