There's more story, heart, and � cutting to the chase, the quick, and the dead � pure, unadulterated fun contained within a scant five minutes of Rockstar Games' new Grand Theft Auto IV
 video game than there is in the whole of Speed Racer
, which raises some very intriguing questions about the future of big-budget Hollywood hot air and the even more grandiosely budgeted gaming industry. Former Matrices the Wachowski brothers populate their shiny, happy, CGI-drenched Hot Wheels world with living, breathing, identifiably organic actors: Into the Wild
's Hirsch as Speed, a mountainous Goodman as Pops, Oscar-winner Sarandon as Mrs. Racer, a preposterously perky Ricci as Speed's best gal Trixie, and so on. But in the supersaturated and breathlessly overdesigned unreality of the film, the actors fail to deliver even a quart of real, nonsynthetic empathy. Up against corporate automotive behemoth Royalton Industries, whose snarling bulldog of a CEO (Allam, seen in the Wachowski-scripted and infinitely better V for Vendetta
) vows to either buy out Speed's mom-and-pop outfit or wipe the track with the entire Racer clan, Speed smartly opts for the big wipeout. Simultaneously sensing trouble while mourning his missing brother and mentor, Rex (Porter), he breaks familial rank and aligns himself with the masked mystery man Racer X (hint: it's not Death Race 2000
's David Carradine) and a cocksure Japanese racer (played by South Korean megawatt superstar Rain). The outcome, of course, is never in question to anyone over the age of 5. The outrageously eye-popping visuals are indeed psychedelic in both flavor and execution (this film owes everything
 to Japanese anim� and Timothy Leary alike), but after 30 minutes of Roy Lichtenstein-on-acid imagery, it's all you can do not to fidget your way out of the theatre and onto ESPN's NASCAR coverage. The Wachowskis' big, unspoken, vaguely transgressive joke is that their Speed Racer
 experience � I just can't bring myself to call this garish tantrum a "movie" � is akin to nothing so much as diving face-first into a rainbow-hued bowl of methamphetamine-laced cinematic Jell-O. It's a giddy rush for a moment or two, but the comedown is long and harsh, and you'll need one helluva nap afterward. That brings me back to Grand Theft Auto IV
, a recent discovery by this writer who up until recently shunned video games for fear of never leaving his living room again. Well, draw the shades, and fuck that noise. Grand Theft Auto IV
 is the antithesis of Speed Racer
, and a vastly superior entertainment in every way, medium be damned. It's a nuanced, masterfully written, and lovingly � but realistically
 � designed piece of pop-cultural American art masquerading as an obsessive time-killer. The sad irony of Speed Racer
 vs. GTA IV
 is that Rockstar's game places digitally created, inorganic characters into an instantly recognizable environment suffused in every pixel with honest-to-goodness storytelling � and then proceeds to make you care about them to the point of tears. The Wachowskis' hyperbolic, tangerine-flavored, metal-flake freakout, on the other hand, has plenty of flesh-and-blood performers milling about, strenuously attempting to advance Speed Racer
's minimal plot, but nary an honest emotion in sight. Speed Racer
: Color him go, go, gone. (And that goes double for Chim Chim.)


Watching "Speed Racer," the new summer lollapalooza from the Wachowski brothers, is like being force-fed a Costco-size bag of your favorite candy. For half an hour, taste buds you didn't know you had are firing in delirium, stoked by the movie's outrageous visual razzle-dazzle. Then you hit that spot in the bag where you know you should stop, but the movie keeps going. You feel more and more bloated; the movie keeps going. At a certain point, you may wonder if the movie's eating you. It doesn't end so much as vomit the audience out.
That's entertainment, I suppose, or an experience, or a night out at the movies on acid. In "Speed Racer," millions of dollars and billions of computer cycles have been expended creating a digital wonder-world simulacrum - an unimaginably amped-up, CGI-enhanced live action version of the beloved 1960s Japanese anime many of us remember from US airings on upper-dial broadcast and cable stations (Channel 56 in Boston for me, a half-eaten Space Stick in my hand).
The show, created by Tatsuo Yoshida, was in the mold of Osamu Tezuka's groundbreaking "Astro Boy": flat, fast, catchy, hilariously dubbed in all italics. Boy car-fanatic Speed Racer drove his Mach 5 against colorful opponents with hidden tire-knives, while girlfriend Trixie, parents Pops and Mom, little brother Spritle, and their pet chimp Chim-Chim screeched and swooned in the stands. Wonderful at 4 in the afternoon when you should be doing homework, but is there a movie in it?
The Wachowskis - still trying to match "The Matrix" - respond by building a universe out of pixels and aiming for a massive sugar high. The skies are a cobalt digital blue here, the clouds on loan from Teletubbyland. The racetracks, blissfully, defy all engineering logic, and the cars flip and careen with 800-horsepower abandon (producer Joel Silver has dubbed the action sequences "Car Fu"). The time period is the 1960s seen through the nostalgic GAF View-Master of a 21st century graphic designer - it's future retro. The sensibility is Hot Wheels on industrial steroids. My inner 7-year-old was having atrial fibrillations.
There are people here, sort of. "Speed Racer" drops human actors into its breathless visual schema like drops of water on a hot griddle: Emile Hirsch as Speed, Christina Ricci as Trixie, Susan Sarandon and John Goodman as Mom and Pops. Hirsch is appropriately wooden - any trace of his "Into the Wild" passion has been sandblasted off - and Ricci appears to have lost more than 50 percent of her body weight; she's all chin and mischievous saucer-eyes. The movie's the wayward grandchild of "Tron," the 1982 Disney film that doodled primitive computer graphics over actors like Jeff Bridges.
The intentionally banal plot barely merits a mention, but here goes: Speed resists the enticements of a swishy, omnipotent tycoon (Roger Allam, channeling late-period Tim Curry) and schemes to expose him with the help of the not-so-mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox of "Lost," looking dandy in his bondage mask), Japanese racer Taejo (Rain), and the dauntless Inspector Detector (Benno F�rmann). It's a corporate power fantasy about the evils of corporate power, basically; an irony the filmmakers flatten in their race to the finish.
"Speed Racer" screeches to a halt every so often for boilerplate inspirational speeches - reprised toward the end in a goofy, greatest-hits montage - and for cutesy slapstick involving Spritle (Paulie Litt) and the chimpanzees playing Chim-Chim (less amusing if you credit rumors of animal abuse on the German shooting locations).
Mostly, the Wachowskis rev the movie's motor in geometrically increasing RPMs, building inexorably to a climax that can only be described as NASCAR Zen orgasm. Aiming to replicate the experience of the anime on a metastasized scale, "Speed Racer" unsnaps the characters from the frame and lets them deliver their lines on floating multiple planes of action, constantly wiping this way and that like cars playing chicken on a crowded freeway. It's enthralling, and then it's exhausting, and it never lets up.
On the levels of technical craftsmanship and pure eye-candy, "Speed Racer" is some kind of triumph of the will. It has a knowing foot in pop art as well - the movie could be a Roy Lichtenstein canvas using pixels instead of zipatone dots. It's also thunderingly, proudly empty in a way that prompts either total submission or thoughts of resistance. The movie demands you be a glutton for sensation and then has the nerve to ask why you're not hungrier.


Young boys are the only suitable audience for Speed Racer , the elaborate live-action adaptation written and directed by Matrix  creators Larry and Andy Wachowski. And even they might feel an urge to squirm between the videogame-style, whizbang, jellybean-colored, CG-jiggered car races that are the adrenalized heart of this entertainment with no soul. For almost everyone else, the movie will be a bit of a drag. And in this context, ''everyone else'' is a population including but not limited to grown men who love Japanese manga, baby boomers who remember watching the rudimen¬tary, junky cartoons as kids when there was nothing better on, grown women willing to sit through the noise with their own kids because at least the story promotes family loyalty and cooperation, and kid sisters dragged along with their brothers with an assurance that the epony¬mous hero chastely dates a girl who's an ace behind the wheel herself.
As a refresher for the majority who won't re¬member the forgettable cartoons, Speed (Emile Hirsch) is the second son of the car-crazy Racer family. He's got a gruff, automobile-building Pops (John Goodman) with a mustache like a broom; a perky Mom (Susan Sarandon) who looks dewy even when she's lending a hand with a wrench; a wiseacre kid brother, Spritle (Paulie Litt), who maintains a retro, J. Fred Muggs-era relationship with his pet chimp; a sassy girl¬friend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), who can drive fast and bat her eyelashes at the same time; and a mentor in the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox), who sometimes competes with Speed on the track but is always there to encourage him to do the right thing. What really drives Speed, though, is his desire to live up to the memory of his legendary older brother, a champ who died racing. Speed tries to break records to the ac¬companiment of the Wachowskis' manic, expen¬sive displays of whooshy technical showman¬ship, but the car guy's drive to succeed doesn't feel urgent, merely a necessity to make the gears of the movie turn. Clearly the thrill of translat¬ing the sensation of velocity into a pop visual vocabulary is what really turns the brothers on. For greed-in-our-time relevance, they've brought in an evil business-world fat cat (Roger Allam) with teeth like a busted grill, who offers to sponsor Speed's quest for greatness, provided he throws races to suit the tycoon's corporate schemes. But the Wachowskis' hearts aren't in the human stuff. The story, with its stilted refer¬ences to ''power and the unassailable might of money,'' is as stiff as the old cartoons.
Speed was born to shift gears. A charming flashback to his grade-school days establishes the younger Speed as a mediocre student and a fidgety candidate for ADD therapy, at peace only when making vroom-vroom noises and drawing flip-page animations of moving vehicles. (I knew these boys in school, how about you?) But now he's got to spend his days listening to Racer X's cereal-box Zen teachings: ''Stop steering and start driving. The car is alive. Close your eyes and listen. You do it because you're driven. Racing is what you do.'' Regular driver's-ed courses do not generally advise the lowered-eyelid approach to road safety, but Speed isn't about to be tested on parallel-parking skills.
When the Speed Racer  TV theme song was adapted from the Japanese rendition, the lyrics turned into dunderheaded stuff like ''He's a demon on wheels/He's a demon and he's gonna be chasin' after someone.'' This newest iteration is about a demon on wheels who's chasin' after someone for 135 minutes  which makes for an awful lot of wheel spinning. But the young man is not so much a demon as a cipher arbitrarily assigned a succession of hero's challenges, among them making the right moral choices, establishing an adult relationship with Pops, and letting Trixie move their relationship forward, at least as far as a decent kiss. Without a ravaged stare to focus his performance as it did in Into the Wild , Hirsch recedes even as his character hurtles forward. He's a blank of a hero, outdramatized in every scene by an imposing Goodman, a Sarandon who harks back to her Rocky Horror  beginnings, a goggling Ricci, and a luxuriously rotten-styled Allam.
In a display of relativity Einstein might have admired, Speed Racer  appears to slow down even as the hero himself achieves record-breaking velocity. Forget what happens on the racetrack. This is one vehicle that stalls.


 Many of us who grew up watching television in the 1960s and ’70s have fond if vague memories of “Speed Racer.” Those big-eyed characters (Trixie! Speed! Racer X!), their mouths never quite moving in sync with the dialogue; those bright colors and semiabstract backgrounds; those endless, episodic story lines. Whether we knew it or not, the series was a primer in the aesthetics of Japanese animation, the love of which we could later pass along to our children.  Failing that, I suppose we could subject them to Warner Brothers’ new live-action feature film, also called “Speed Racer,” which was written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the maestros of “The Matrix.” Like so many other expensive, technologically elaborate big-screen adaptations of venerable pop-culture staples, this movie sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity. The childhood experience the Wachowskis evoke is not the easy delight of lolling in the den watching one cartoon after another, but rather the squirming tedium of sitting in the back seat on an endless family car trip, your cheek taking on the texture of the vinyl seat as some grown-up lectures you on the beauty of the passing scenery.  And yes, some of what you see in “Speed Racer” is indeed beautiful (as is the slyly old-fashioned orchestral score by Michael Giacchino). The colors pop off the screen as if someone had burst a giant bag of digital Skittles. Look at those red socks young Speed is wearing! Did you ever see a dress as yellow as the one on Susan Sarandon? (She plays Speed’s mom. John Goodman is his dad.) Or a classroom so brilliantly orange? These hues occur nowhere in nature. And I’ll grant that it is mildly interesting to sit back and contemplate the philosophical and artistic implications of having human actors populate a completely synthetic environment in which the familiar laws of optics and physical movement no longer apply.  You could, come to think of it, spend a pleasant hour in a museum looking at still images and short, looping video installations culled from the hectic, 2-hour-15-minute morass of this movie. And there may be a perverse integrity in the way the Wachowskis approach the material, which is to focus relentlessly on visual style while dispensing almost entirely with credible emotion or intelligible narrative. But this would be an easier case to make if the visual style itself were not so busy and incoherent.  Yes, the colors are hot, the set design is cool, and the sidekick chimpanzee is cute, but the action sequences — the hyperreal video-game kineticism on which the Wachowskis’ reputation for virtuosity has rested — are chaotic and nonsensical. The sleek computer-animated racecars flip, jump and slide from side to side, but few of their feats elicit anything like the amazement or surprise of, say, watching moderately skilled teenage skateboarders in a parking lot. To be truly sensational, action needs to make sense and to convey the tension and grace of real physical movement, however fanciful the objects in motion may be.  But at least those cars — including Speed’s Mach 5, faithfully replicated from the old cartoons — move. When it comes to storytelling, “Speed Racer” has nothing in common with its title. Not only does it surpass the grinding tedium of “The Matrix Revolutions,” but it does so with far less excuse. Back in the early years of this century, it was possible to pretend that the grim-faced expository noodling of the later “Matrix” movies was the vehicle for profound insights into — well, something. Go look it up on Wikipedia.  But “Speed Racer” is about a boy driving a car, surely a subject that cries out for linearity, simplicity, velocity. Instead the first half-hour layers flashbacks with portentous foreshadowings, generating pointless confusion about who is doing what and why. After his beloved older brother, Rex, is killed in an accident — or is he? — Speed (Emile Hirsch) is wooed by the oleaginous head of the Royalton company (Roger Allam), and also by Trixie (Christina Ricci).  There are, to be sure, some vague intimations of an allegory about the tension between art and commerce, between the mystical love of racing for its own sake and the mercenary impulse to subordinate that love to the profit motive. But this parable would be more compelling if “Speed Racer” were not so transparently trying to have it both ways, to be at once profoundly visionary and punchily commercial, and failing on both counts.  On just about every possible count really. The moments of wisdom embedded in the dialogue (Racer X: “Racing will never change. What matters is whether we allow racing to change us”) are as fatuous as the kicky catchphrases (Trixie: “Cool beans!”). Speed’s mischievous little brother (Paulie Litt) and his pet chimp are annoying rather than endearing. The mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) looks tired and grumpy, and the teen-idol charisma of the South Korean pop star Rain (he plays another daredevil driver) is wasted. Mobsters, detectives, sportscasters and ruthless rival racers all parade across the screen, but none of them generate the sparks of humor, danger, energy or nobility that would ignite a sense of pop magic. “Speed Racer” goes nowhere, and you’d be amazed how long the trip can take.  “Speed Racer” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly naughty language and stylized violence.
Converting a fondly remembered cartoon series—one of the first Japanese animes syndicated on American TV—into a prospective franchise, the Matrix  masters, Larry and Andy Wachowski , have taken another step toward the total cyborganization of the cinema.
Even more than most summer-season f/x fests, Speed Racer  is a live-action/animation hybrid and, what's more, proud of it. Bright, shiny, and button-cute, the movie is a self-consciously tawdry trifle—a celluloid analog to the ribbon-bedecked, mirrored gewgaws that clever European settlers hoped to swap with the savages for Manhattan Island.
What you see is what you get. "Production design" is a poor term to describe Owen Paterson 's avidly garish look. Gaudier than a Hindu-temple roof, louder than the Las Vegas  night, Speed Racer  is a cathedral of glitz. The movie projects a Candy Land topography of lava-lamp skies and Hello Kitty clouds—part Middle Earth, part mental breakdown—using a beyond-Bollywood color scheme wherein telephones are blood orange, jet planes electric fuchsia, and ultra-turquoise is the new black.
Call it Power Kitsch, Neo-Jetsonism, or Icon-D—this film could launch a movement. A dream (or perhaps nightmare) team of pop artists might have collaborated on Speed Racer 's mise-en-scène. The futuristic multihued skyscrapers seem a figment of Kenny Scharf 's imagination; the glazed female leads suggest Jeff Koons  sculptures sporting Takashi Murakami  accessories. And that's just the "Sunday Styles" stuff. Once the various gizmobiles accelerate to warp speed on roller-coaster racetracks seemingly conceived by Dr. Seuss , the screen reconstitutes itself as a Bridget Riley  vortex or a mad geometric abstraction of Kenneth Noland  racing stripes.
For me, this carousel, which clocks in at a leisurely 135 minutes, is more fun to describe than to ride. Blithely nonlinear for its first half hour, the past merging with the present as shifting backgrounds segue to flashbacks, Speed Racer  has a narrative at once simpleminded and senseless, albeit touchingly faithful to Tatsuo Yoshida 's original cartoons. Here, too, the eponymous hero (Emile Hirsch )—child of the auto-inventor Pops Racer (John Goodman , man-mountain of goodwill) and Mom Racer (self-Stepfordized Susan Sarandon )—is born to drive the family Mach 5, particularly once older brother Rex is seemingly vaporized in a wreck. And drive Speed does—if not quite as well as the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox ).
Generically speaking, Speed Racer  will never be confused with a no-frills dynamo like Howard Hawks 's The Crowd Roars  (or even Hawks's fascinatingly flaccid mid-'60s racing hallucination, Red Line 7000 ). For all the excited color commentary ("Speed Racer is driving straight up a cliff face!!!"), the races lack drama. Each spectacle is an autonomous, enjoyably lurid tinsel-confetti blur, with crack-ups as convoluted as they are inconsequential. As choreographed as the action is, it lacks only printed sound effects—WHAM! BLAM! POW!—to sign-post the Wachowskis' facetiousness.
After the relative failures of The Matrix Reloaded  and The Matrix Revolutions , and the widespread disapproval inspired by their tastelessly anarcho-terrorist V for Vendetta , the brothers have opted for family-friendly fluff. In place of irony, there's a sprinkling of camp sentimentality. Speed is abetted by plucky girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci , reliving her lysergic past as Addams Family  ingenue), who, Louise Brooks  bob set off by a pair of red barrettes, is even more of a porcelain doll than Mom. And, as back in the day, the clan includes a tubby little brother (Paulie Litt ) with a bratty pet chimp. Everyone has a role, even if it's only a matter of creative lurking. As Pops and his engineer, Sparky (Kick Gurry ), rebuild the Mach 5 for the Grand Prix, Mom makes the peanut-butter sandwiches. No Oracle  she.
Like The Matrix  (or its engagingly primitive precursor, the DOS-era Disney  relic Tron ), Speed Racer  gives the not-unrealistic impression of taking place inside a computer. But love, hate, or ignore it, The Matrix  proposed a social mythology. (Just ask Slavoj Zizek .) Speed Racer  is simply a mishmash that, among other things, intermittently parodies the earlier film's pretensions: His path plotted by a mysterious cabal, Speed Racer could be the One. Indeed, in the grand first-installment climax, messianic frenzy merges with market research as the young racer's "upset" victory bids not only to change the face of high-stakes race-car driving but the nature of reality itself: "It's a whole new world!" This hopeful self-promotion is especially ridiculous in that Speed Racer —like The Matrix  and the plot-heavy V for Vendetta —ostentatiously traffics in left-wing allegory.
The villain (Roger Allam , V for Vendetta 's fascist talk-show host) is a slavering tycoon, while Speed Racer is, as his mother tells him, an Artist. In the movie, racing is itself a racket—the effluvium of decaying Capital within the Matrix. Multinationals sponsor drivers, fix races, and use the sport to drive up the market price of their stock. (So the Wachowski brothers might once have regarded Hollywood .) Ideologically anti-corporate, previous Wachowski productions aspired to be something more than mind-less sensation; Speed Racer  is thrilled to be less. It's the delusions minus the grandeur.
