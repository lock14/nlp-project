Often enough, it's easy to imagine one actor taking the place of another in a role with no appreciable loss of a movie's overall integrity. Not so The Visitor , an It's-a-Small-World fairy-tale torqued into an anguished drama that agitates for more humane American immigration procedures. This audaciously issues-loaded indie drama works, improbably and entirely, on account of the marvelous, often familiar-looking, rarely starring character actor Richard Jenkins and his perfect performance as a stodgy, widowed economics professor from Connecticut named Walter Vale. Jenkins has played a dead undertaker dad in Six Feet Under  and a shrink in There's Something About Mary , but he's never had his moment  until now. And he takes it with such affecting modesty and commitment that he turns a tall tale into a heartfelt ballad.
In this ambitiously fanciful weaving of romantic notions and citizen outrage from writer-director Tom McCarthy (a ballsy sophomore filmmaking project after his prizewinning droll 2003 debut, The Station Agent ), Walter travels to Manhattan for an academic conference, arrives at his little-used New York apartment, and discovers that the flat is being used by Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a Syrian musician, and Zainab, Tarek's Senegalese girlfriend (Danai Gurira). Long story short, rather than report the intruders (they're the innocent victims of a rental scam), the professor befriends the drummer. And all would be cheery and melting-potty if the musician weren't stopped by cops in a subway station, arrested as an illegal immigrant, and held for deportation.
The harsh inequities and Kafka-country miseries of secretive U.S. immigration procedures in a post-9/11 state of anxiety and suspicion shift The Visitor  from dream to nightmare, a maze of helplessness only slightly sweetened by the unannounced arrival from Detroit of Tarek's worried mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass); while waiting for news of her son, Mouna also perches temporarily in Walter's dimly lit apartment. And there she works, pro bono, for her host's spiritual, sexual, and political reawakening. (If anyone can warm the frozen-hearted, it's the charismatic Abbass from Munich  and Satin Rouge .) It's the damnedest thing, really: Innocent Tarek is seriously screwed and Mouna is seriously distraught. Yet the fates of both visitors  attractive ambassadors from a ''scary'' part of the world  are filtered through the awakening of an uptight, aging white guy with limited means of self-expression.
Oh, but Jenkins has so many eloquent ways of conveying constriction and the shock of a man aroused from the slow sleep he had accepted as a good-enough life. Wisely, McCarthy paces his movie around his star  an artist who inhabits, rather than visits, the characters he plays.

 When we first meet Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins), he is in a state of emotional inertia that clinicians might identify as depression. He does not seem acutely unhappy, but then again, he doesn’t seem to feel much at all, locking whatever inner life he might have behind an aloof, unfailingly polite demeanor and keeping a glass of red wine handy in case further anesthesia should prove necessary.  A professor of economics at Connecticut College and a widower, Walter plods through an existence that looks comfortable and easy enough, but also profoundly tedious. He recycles old syllabuses and lecture notes for his classes, and suffers through piano lessons in a half-hearted effort to sustain some kind of connection to his wife, who was a classical concert pianist.  Early in “The Visitor,” Tom McCarthy’s second film as writer and director (the first was “The Station Agent”), it seems inevitable that something will come along to shake Walter out of his malaise. And sure enough, when he reluctantly travels to New York to deliver a paper at a conference, Walter finds that the Manhattan apartment he keeps but rarely visits has been surreptitiously rented to Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a drummer from Syria, and Zainab (Danai Gurira), his Senegalese girlfriend, who sells handmade jewelry at flea markets. Walter’s initial dismay and irritation gives way to an instinctive flicker of compassion, and he invites the couple to stay, at least for a short while.  The curious thing about “The Visitor” is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way. Tarek and Walter quickly become friends, though Zainab is more reserved and also clearly more suspicious of her new housemate and benefactor. Walter takes up drumming, and begins to feel his zest for life and his appreciation of  New York returning after a long period of dormancy.  This urban, multicultural idyll is shattered when Tarek, who, like Zainab, is in the United States illegally, is picked up by the police and taken to a detention center in Queens. Shortly thereafter, his mother, Mouna, played by the wonderful Israeli Arab actress Hiam Abbass, arrives from Michigan, to make Walter’s life still more interesting and complicated.  To summarize Mr. McCarthy’s film as I have is to acknowledge some of the risks he has taken. It is possible to imagine a version of this story — the tale of a square, middle-aged white man liberated from his uptightness by an infusion of Third World soulfulness, attached to an exposé of the cruelty of post-9/11 immigration policies — that would be obvious and sentimental, an exercise in cultural condescension and liberal masochism. Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to imagine it any other way.  And yet, astonishingly enough, Mr. McCarthy has. Much as “The Station Agent” nimbly evaded the obstacles of cuteness and willful eccentricity it had strewn in its own path, so does “The Visitor,” with impressive grace and understatement, resist potential triteness and phony uplift.  A few false notes remain. Tarek’s friendliness is too emphatic, and the blossoming of his friendship with Walter proceeds a little too quickly and smoothly to be entirely credible. Long-term houseguests, however appealing and exotic, would surely test the patience of even the saintliest economist, to say nothing of an evident curmudgeon like Walter.  But these objections are, for the most part, dissolved by the clarity and simplicity of Mr. McCarthy’s direction and, even more, by the quiet precision of Mr. Jenkins’s performance. An actor himself (he recently played Scott Templeton, the journalistic rat on “The Wire”), Mr. McCarthy scrupulously avoids big moments and telegraphed emotions, and Mr. Jenkins, a durable character actor known to HBO subscribers as the spectral father on “Six Feet Under,” plays his repressed, circumspect character with exquisite tact. Walter loses his composure only once, and even then Mr. Jenkins keeps the outburst within the boundaries of his shy, professorial temperament.  Walter is fundamentally diffident, decent and disinclined to call attention to himself, traits that pose an obvious challenge to Mr. Jenkins, who must still make this man interesting enough, vivid enough, to carry the film’s dramatic burden. Walter himself, at his best, might insist that the story is not really about him. He, after all, leads a life of privilege and entitlement, and is unlikely ever to be faced with homelessness, exile or deportation. And yet the film’s title refers to him — a transient presence in his own life —as much as it does to Tarek, who seems at home wherever he is.  Mr. Jenkins manages at once to deflect and to earn the audience’s sympathy, and to convey an inner transformation brought about by a shy, unselfish engagement with other people. How does he do it? Great acting is always, almost by definition, something of a mystery, a blend of technique and instinct for which no identifiable formula exists. Mr. Jenkins’s posture, his balked  smile, the occasional fidget of his hands or pause in his stride — all of these almost subliminally communicate something about who Walter is, so that by the end of the film we feel we know him very well. And more than that, that he is someone worth knowing.    “The Visitor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity.

Some films click from the moment they're cast, and that is certainly the case with "The Visitor," writer-director Tom McCarthy's first feature since his popular "The Station Agent," and a perfect vehicle for Richard Jenkins. An actor whose face is far better known than his name, Jenkins plays McCarthy's transfigured hero to a tee. A combination immigrant/resurrection tale, "Visitor" tilts toward the soulful rather than the political, and could be this year's humanistic indie hit.
Jenkins, who has worked for everyone from Woody Allen to Mike Nichols, from the Farrelly brothers to the Coen brothers, plays Walter Vale -- widower, economics professor and the ne plus ultra 

of boring white men. When he reluctantly returns to Gotham to give a talk at NYU, he finds two immigrants living in his little-used Manhattan apartment: Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and his girlfriend, Zainab (Danai Gurira), illegals who were scammed into renting Walter's usually vacant pad.
We half expect a grand gesture from Walter, but McCarthy makes us wait: It isn't until Tarek and Zainab are packed and on the street that Walter tells them to return and stay. And so begins an ostensibly short-term, ad hoc family, with the gregarious Tarek acting as bridge between the taciturn Walter and the always wary Zainab.
Walter's academic life is as empty as his bed, and he engages with real life as a guest; the thrust of "The Visitor" is his re-acquaintance with an emigre city and country that have changed without him noticing. 
Tarek teaches him African drumming, and Walter begins frequenting the club where Tarek plays. Eventually the two join a drum circle in Central Park, Walter's tweeds contrasting with all the T-shirts and bandanas. It's a world Walter has never known, and his transformation is gradual but definitive -- Jenkins awakens his character's soul.
When Tarek is arrested and thrown into a corporate-run alien detention center, Walter becomes the only conduit between Tarek and the outside world, as well as Tarek's only chance for freedom. Walter's once-tenuous commitment to the real world now reaches the point of no return.
At this moment in the film, as Tarek disappears into the maw of Homeland Security and his mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) arrives to find her son, the dynamics of the film shift and it becomes a bit less absorbing, mostly because Walter has already made his transformation. 
McCarthy's sense of outrage about the U.S. government's martinet emigre policies become a bit too obvious, the camera focusing on images of the Statue of Liberty or the multilingual papers found on Queens newsstands. He needn't have been so obvious, but it appears he doesn't quite know how to get out of the story, either. Luckily, Jenkins has hooked us early and reels us in like fish.

Stop me if you've heard this one before: A lonely dwarf, a wisecracking Cuban-American, and a grieving mother walk into each other's lives, laugh together, cry together, and heal each other's emotional wounds. Cue Sundance prizes, Miramax  pickup, glowing reviews, and surprisingly robust indie box-office. The movie is The Station Agent , and it was the sort of exercise in forced whimsy and catharsis that managed to coast by on the charm of its performers, so long as you didn't stop to ponder why the film's writer-director, Tom McCarthy , had his characters descend into near-hysterics upon their first encounter with Peter Dinklage 's vertically challenged train hobbyist. Clearly a believer in leaving well enough alone, McCarthy has, for his second feature, made another movie about an unlikely threesome—except this time, he's decided to get political, making a liberal-guilt-trip movie about first-world ignorance of third-world culture.
Like The Station Agent , The Visitor  opens in a state of mourning, with 62-year-old economics professor Walter Vale  (Richard Jenkins ) staring longingly out the window of his Connecticut home while a solemn piano sonata plays on the soundtrack. Even before we know what exactly Walter has lost, we know he's lost something; like almost every other scene in the movie, this one wears its meaning on its sleeve. Then Walter reluctantly travels to New York to give a paper at an NYU conference, only to find his long-untended Manhattan apartment occupied by . . . a young Syrian emigré, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman ), and his Senegalese girlfriend, Zainab (Danai Gurira ), who have been swindled into thinking the place is theirs. At first, Walter kicks his unexpected houseguests to the curb, but, of course, there wouldn't be a movie here if Walter didn't think better of that decision and tell the couple to stay as long as they need to. That's when things take a turn for the pious.
I'd call Walter's meet-cute with Tarek and Zainab accidental, but pretty much nothing in The Visitor  happens by accident. It's a screenplay that seems to have sprung from one of those how-to screenwriting seminars you see advertised in the back of movie magazines. That mournful piano music? It turns out to be a performance by Walter's late wife, a classical concert pianist. And Tarek, wouldn't you know, is a musician too, only he plays the African drum. And before long, he's teaching Walter how to play. And not long after that, this supposed East Coast intellectual who lectures at seminars on "economic growth in developing nations" is chowing down on his first-ever shawarma and stopping on his lunch break to listen—really  listen—to the young black kids beating on their plastic buckets in Washington Square Park .
So, East meets West and everyone is a little bit the better for it—until the ugly face of post-9/11 racial profiling intrudes, landing the undocumented Tarek in a subcontracted government detention center where the walls are lined with posters that say things like "The strength of America . . . America's immigrants." Irony alert! That's Walter's opportunity—and ours—to become outraged that such things can happen in the supposed Land of the Free, while Tarek and Zainab marvel, wide-eyed, at the fact that some rich old white dude could possibly care about their well-being.
Soon Tarek's doting mom, Mouna (played by the excellent Israeli-Arab actress Hiam Abbass ), shows up and everyone piles onto the Staten Island  Ferry for a tour of relevant New York landmarks—Ellis Island , Ground Zero—just in case we didn't get the point that this is a movie about liberty under siege. Like every other Muslim character in the film, Mouna practically walks on water, but Abbass has an emotional gravity that helps to counterbalance the movie's epic banality whenever she's on-screen. Jenkins isn't so lucky; one of the most resourceful character actors out there, he's been hemmed by McCarthy into a fussy, mannered performance in which everything is externalized—crippling grief in the first part, righteous indignation in the second.
McCarthy unquestionably means well, but he's made one of those incredibly naïve movies that gives liberals a bad name, and which does more to regress the sociopolitical discourse than advance it. "I was struck by how little I knew about the region," McCarthy says in the movie's press notes, remarking on his trip to the Middle East as part of a U.S. cultural-outreach program. "With all the news and the headlines and the drama, we can forget that there are human beings on both sides of this." Is McCarthy really this dense, or does he think he's the enlightened one and we are in need of his counsel? I hope the former, but, on the basis of The Visitor , I fear the latter.
