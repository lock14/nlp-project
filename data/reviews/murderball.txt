         The raucous and bold documentary "Murderball" looks at the sport of quad rugby, played on a basketball court on which players in wheelchairs maneuver, sometimes violently, to move a ball upcourt and across the goal line. Though the players are quadriplegics, meaning they have some form of restricted mobility in all four limbs, the sport is fiercely and passionately played, and at the international level, the stakes are high with gold medals, national and individual pride on the line.
 
  Directors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro focus on a group of men — primarily the U.S. national team, plus a former player who went on to coach Canada — who demonstrate the courage and physical strength required to play the game. In going beyond sports and looking into these men's lives, Rubin and Shapiro have crafted the best of this year's sports films — fiction or documentary.
 


         






    The film is framed by the intense rivalry between the Canadian and American teams stretching between the 2002 World Championships in Sweden and the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. The Canadians challenge the dominant USA team behind firebrand coach Joe Soares. Soares had been a star for the U.S. for many years and was in his 40s when he was cut in 2000 from the national team. Bitter, Soares headed north to lead Canada, sparking resentment among some of his former teammates.
 
  A Portuguese immigrant who contracted polio as a child, Soares resembles Robert Duvall as a vein pulsates on his forehead while he screams orders at his players and trades barbs with the Americans. He rolls up and down the sideline barely restraining himself from joining the on-court fray. Rubin and Shapiro discover a goldmine in Soares' heart-rending relationship with his 12-year-old, Robert, a saga that embodies the quintessential dysfunction that seemingly passes from every father to son.
 
  The U.S. player on whom Soares grates the most is Mark Zupan, a fierce younger competitor who lost his mobility in a truck accident when he was in college. Zupan channels his anger into the game and is an articulate and entertaining spokesman. One of the many compelling subplots involves his evolving relationship with his estranged best friend, Chris Igoe, who was at the wheel the night Zupan was injured.
 
  A third story line introduces Keith Cavill, a young man paralyzed in a motocross accident. Through Cavill's progress in months of rehab we get a glimpse of some of what the quad rugby players must have gone through. It is through Cavill we see the monumental challenge that opening an envelope or putting on shoes initially presents.
 
  An inspiring story not only of how these men overcame challenges to become great athletes (or in some cases regain their athleticism) but also of how they deal with mundane everyday chores such as buying groceries or washing dishes, "Murderball" is a thoughtful and provocative look at a previously little-seen world. In allowing the players to speak openly about subjects they are passionate about, they craft deeper and more honest profiles. With topics including how people treat them in public, how they pick up women in bars, and how they learned that their disabilities did not necessarily preclude sex, the documentary humanizes a group of people who are often marginalized by a society that doesn't see past the wheelchair.

On the playing field, they charge with the fearlessness of gladiators, knocking each other to the ground again and again in a furious bid for team glory. Off the field, they cuss and carouse; they drink and talk trash and love the ladies. And everywhere, they zip around in wheelchairs, hard-headed gents transformed by simple twists of fate, and sometimes neck, into the misunderstood diagnostic category of quadriplegics. (The term defines limited function in all four limbs, not necessarily total paralysis from the neck down.)
The men of the rousing documentary Murderball   so titled for the slangier, less dainty name of their chosen, brutal contact sport, quad rugby  are a breed apart: For one thing, they're unusually articulate about their experiences and feelings. And for another, when not in armored chairs souped up for battle, competing at the quad rugby World Championship (we see them in Sweden in 2002) or the Paralympics (we see them in Greece in 2004), their daily challenges include putting on their shoes. But it's the ways in which the players who make the cut for directors Henry-Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro are like any other SOBs, on wheels or not, that kicks Murderball  up to trophy level. Also, the filmmaking is as strong as the subject matter, with an elegant structure. And that's something that can't be said of every entry in this nonfiction boom, when real-life plots involving birds who mate or children who ballroom dance make for mad hot box office.
And then there are the riveting stories these attractive mooks have to tell  it's a tournament of tales, really, played out by competitive sumbitches between bursts of on-court action shot and edited with a love of speed and chair-slamming impact. For the main competitive event, there's the bad blood between Mark Zupan (charismatic tattooed jock, spokesman for dominant Team USA, in a chair since a freak auto accident at the age of 18) and Joe Soares (vein-throbbing type A former American all-star, cut from Team USA and coaching Team Canada with revenge in mind, in a chair as a result of childhood polio). For psychological tension, there's barking Coach Joe's gruff relationship with his bookish 12-year-old son and  Zupan's ties to the guilt-ridden best friend who was driving on the night of that accident. For a chance to hear straight dope about the can-he-or-can't-he questions on every viewer's mind, there is Zupan's happy relationship with his punk-sexy girlfriend. (In fact, every guy in front of the filmmakers' camera is cheerily forthcoming about his sex life, sometimes with raunchy high spirits; then again, maybe that was a condition of getting the face time.)
But let's set application of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to questions of nonfiction filmmaking aside (Does the act of observing alter the reality being observed? As a man agreeable to the notion of strangers documenting his wedding anniversary and his heart attack, is Coach Joe representative of other quads?) The directors haven't only been lucky in finding these particular quads on this particular quest for Paralympic gold; they've been artful. By introducing the more recently paralyzed Keith Cavill, a passionate lover of all things wheelie still dazed from the motocross accident that irrevocably changed his life, the directors open up the movie so that it's not only a jaunty sports story of rivalries and triumph of spirit over damaged bodies but also a raw tale of medical and psychological struggle. The camera is with Cavill as he is discharged from 10 months of physical rehab, and as he returns home with his mother and girlfriend, in fresh despair and anger at what will never be the same again. It's with him, too, as he lays eyes on a quad rugby wheelchair for the first time, demonstrated by none other than Zupan, and feels excitement and hope, maybe for the first time since his crash.
Murderball  is about characters, it's about character, and toward the very end, amid all the hoopla and rah-rah of the big-game payoff and the assembly of all the people we have come to care about both in chairs and out, the filmmakers nudge their movie to be about something even more stunning and sobering than that. Just briefly, but with acute intention, Rubin and Shapiro show the pin-up boys of quad rugby visiting American soldiers, wounded in Iraq, at Fort Belvoir in Alexandria, Va. The implication is clear: For every one of the scared, broken boys we see, comforted by Zupan's confidence and affability, there are way too many others off screen who now qualify for the team.

 Who wins and who loses in the gripping sports documentary "Murderball" may not be a matter of life and death. But the ferocity of competition displayed in the film's full-body immersion in wheelchair rugby trumps any high-powered gamesmanship you'll find on reality television. Invented in Canada in the 1970's, the sport used to be known as murderball, until the name proved an insurmountable barrier to securing corporate sponsorship.  But in another way, wheelchair rugby, or quad rugby, as it's also called, really is a life-and-death matter. A synthesis of basketball, hockey and rugby, it is played by quadriplegic men, many disabled by catastrophic accidents during the prime of life. As the movie shows, the sport has restored meaning and hope to its players, who require two to three years of grueling rehabilitation and training to master it.  The film's charismatic real-life star, Mark Zupan, is a tattooed sitting gladiator with reddish hair, a goatee and a smoldering glare. Mr. Zupan was 18 when he went out drinking one night in 1993 with his best friend, Chris Igoe, and ended the evening passed out in the back of his friend's pickup truck. Mr. Igoe returned hours later, and unaware that Mr. Zupan was asleep in the back, accidentally crashed the truck on the way home.  Landing in a canal with a broken neck, unable to move his legs, Mr. Zupan was rescued after clinging to a branch for more than 13 hours. In 1996 he began playing wheelchair rugby and has since become the leader of the American Paralympic team. His ruptured friendship with Mr. Igoe is on the mend.  The combatants in wheelchair rugby, outfitted like warriors but without helmets, are strapped into armored, custom-made wheelchairs that collide in a kind of human demolition derby as the teams compete to carry a ball into the end zone.  "We're not going for a hug, we're going for a gold medal," one player declares irritably, recalling a naïve comparison of the Paralympics to the Special Olympics, the international games for children and adults with learning disabilities.  The documentary corrects the common misperception that all quadriplegics are totally immobilized. In the film's definition, quadriplegia means some impairment of all four limbs. The majority of players broke their necks; their degree of immobility depends on what part of the neck was fractured. With extensive rehabilitation, many are able to lead independent lives. The movie goes out of its way to address the question of sex, which is practiced enthusiastically by those athletes who discuss it.  Wheelchair rugby players are assigned rankings, from .5 to 3.5, depending on their degree of upper-body mobility. A team's total score cannot exceed 8. The more mobile players handle the ball; the rest play defense.  The movie spans more than two years, beginning with the 2002 World Wheelchair Rugby Championships in Sweden and ending after the 2004 International Paralympic Games in Athens. Based on a magazine article by Dana Adam Shapiro, who directed the movie with Henry-Alex Rubin, "Murderball" is almost as tough as the relentlessly combative players it profiles.  The film consciously steers away from the tears and gooey inspirational uplift associated with disability movies. Fast-paced and fluid, it also resists squandering time on dry sports statistics or medical analysis. The game sequences, many shot at wheelchair eye level, are as viscerally thrilling as they are concise. There is little attempt to build up or tease out suspense during a championship game; that kind of melodrama is out.  The heart of the movie is in the human dramas of Mr. Zupan and Joe Soares, the bullying, fanatically competitive coach of the Canadian team. We also meet Keith Cavill, an athlete who suffered a broken neck in 2003 in a Motocross race (a rough-course motorcycle competition), who discovers and embraces wheelchair rugby. The scenes of his daunting rehabilitative therapy and of his bitter return home from the hospital suggest the almost unimaginable distance he must travel to transcend despair and immobility to play the sport.  But the prize for the most competitive aggressor goes to Mr. Soares. Disabled by a childhood case of polio, he was once the leader of the American team. After being cut from the roster, he accepted the position of coach for the Canadian team, for which he is denounced as a Benedict Arnold by his former teammates. Mr. Soares is so obsessed with winning that he barely has time for his nonathletic adolescent son, who, despite excelling academically and playing the viola, is clearly a disappointment to his father. But in the middle of the movie, Mr. Soares suffers a serious heart attack. After his recovery, he emerges as a kinder, gentler dad.  As the Canadian and American teams go at each other, "Murderball" flirts with sentimentality and rah-rah button-pushing but never succumbs. The evenness of its emotional pitch almost incidentally helps the film become an unusually deep exploration of sports, machismo and the competitive spirit.  Where would these men be without the activity that has transformed their lives? Instead of warring with one another, they might be at war with themselves, locked in a cycle of resentment, despair and self-loathing.  The movie is in perfect sync with the survival-of-the-fittest values of the times. In a chilly era where go-for-broke competition and worship of the body rule entertainment, the sickness of the soul is only for losers, and no one wants to lose.  "Murderball" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has abundant profanity and frank sex talk.
It's hard to imagine a movie with thicker Teflon  coating than an inspirational sports doc in which the up-from-behind athletes involved are also wheelchair-bound quadriplegics struck down in their prime. The opportunities for mawkish uplift abound, and heaven help anyone callous enough to call it exploitation. For the most part, though, Murderball about the unheralded international pro-am sport of quad rugby, formerly known as murderballlets naysayers off the hook. While the film does exhibit a shameless penchant for overdetermined conflict/resolution setups (it's a sports movie, for God's sake), it also allows the unresolvable ache and unexpected resiliency of its subjects to come through loud and clear. Indeed, what keeps Murderball  from devolving into redemptive drivel is its insistence on treating the players it profiles as jocks first and disabled men second.
Documentarians Henry-Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro  (who penned a Maxim  story that spurred this film) are gifted enough filmmakers to maintain that balance throughout. Structured around a series of hyperbolic rivalries and personal revelations, it begins with a useful description of the ferocious sport itselfthink a gladiatorial hybrid of touch football and bumper carsfilmed in knuckle-whitening wheelchair p.o.v. shots. We then meet the pertinent players and see cocky, undefeated team USA lose the 2002 world championship to its Canadian counterpart.
On one side of this bitter divide is Joe Soares , a megalomaniacal middle-aged Yank who took over coaching duties for the Canadians after being cut from the American team; among his former teammates is Mark Zupan , a young Texan whose hard-earned introspection and air of quiet grief provide the film with its moral centerand Soares with an archrival (for Rubin and Shapiro's purposes, anyway).
Between adrenaline-stoked passages of court combat, Murderball  profiles the individual setbacks of Soares, Zupan, and several of their teammates and fellow quads. Some of these threads are wrenching: The film opens with a raw lesson in what it takes for Zupan to dress himself every morning and later follows the newly crippled Keith Cavill  from a grueling stay in rehab to an ADA-remodeled bedroom in his parents' home, where he fruitlessly implores family members to acknowledge his loss. It's the movie's most potent heart punch.
A stagy confrontation between Zupan and his high school pal Chris Igoe , the ostensible culprit in the car crash that left Zupan paralyzed, falls flat. Not only does Igoe exhibit little guilt, Zupan seems to have stopped blaming him long ago. Soares's mid-film heart attack and its impact on his relationship with his son, Robert, is also overplayed, although it is a relief when the two finally connector at least when Soares finally stops haranguing the bookish lad.
What truly makes Murderball resonate, though, is that it poses the unstated question at the heart of all athletic endeavors (but precious few tear-jerking Hollywood gimp-fests)How much punishment can the human body take before the spirit crumbles?and lets the game and its not-quite-broken players supply the answer.
