In 1972, a 32-year-old sound editor and college professor named Wes Craven released "The Last House on the Left" about two teenage girls who go looking for pre-concert pot and wind up tortured by a couple of escaped convicts. The cons take refuge at a Connecticut home that happens to be owned by the parents of one of the girls. Mom and Dad put two and two together and exact trippy, grisly revenge.
The movie cost $90,000, though watching it you'd be hard-pressed to explain where the money went. It was terribly made, and yet crudely powerful. The killers were human in some way  - sick, weird, and cool on one hand, but insecure in their sadism, too, like they actually wanted to be in a John Cassavetes movie. Craven has said that he was thinking about Ingmar Bergman's classic 1960 film "The Virgin Spring" about a father avenging his murdered daughter.
Craven was no Bergman, but he was onto something interesting. He'd made a movie of his moment, a film that brought together the Manson murders, the random horror of the Vietnam War, women's liberation, and bourgeois ennui. And after 80-something minutes had passed, you felt that you'd witnessed a tragedy. As filmmaking, "Last House," along with George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," from 1974, ushered in a kind of horror-realism that lasted until each director traded it in for phantasmagoria in the 1980s.
This is all a long way of appraising a remake of "Last House on the Left" that Craven has coproduced and which opens today. It has as much to do with the 1972 original as the original had to do with "The Virgin Spring." Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) is no longer caught between the hormonal rebellion of Flower Power and the self-actualization of women's lib. She's simply the sort of girl you now find in horror movies: prey.
The new movie gives her and her white-collar parents  - Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter  - a dead sibling-son to mourn.  Mari  is beaten, raped, and left for dead by the con. ,Mari's girlfriend is stabbed to death. This is awful to sit through. (Why Paxton, or any actor, would take such a thankless part is mysterious. It always makes me wonder whether the simulation is nearly as traumatic.) Eventually, the con and his gang, looking for shelter in a storm, darken the Collingwoods' door, and, inevitably, a gun is fired, a microwave weaponized, and a pickax wielded.
The night of movie excitement produced is dubious. This remake plods to its finale. And the acting, namely that of the baddies, is bad (Garret Dillahunt plays the con). Yet, the Collingwoods' revenge, though preposterous in its thoroughness, makes more emotional sense than it did in 1972. Like the current hit "Taken," "Last House" 2009 packs a vicarious jolt that might feel cathartic to certain moviegoers. During the climax, some people will see a murderer and rapist partway inside a microwave oven. Others will glean a mortgage broker, venal investor, or CEO and say, "Off with his head."

Out for kicks, a family of sadist-sociopaths corners a teenage girl in the woods. She is raped (by the father) and left for dead  and that, no exaggeration, is the lighter half of this desperate-to-be-shocking exploitation dud. The original version of The House on the Left , released in 1972, was the first film directed by Wes Craven, who basically refracted Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring  through the dementia of the Manson family. The movie was vile but terrifying. This remake is merely vile (and dull), with a badly miscast Tony Goldwyn as the raging dad who makes revenge for his daughter's violation look more gratuitously brutal than the crime.

 Three years ago the French director Alexandre Aja spun Wes Craven’s cannibal classic,  “The Hills Have Eyes,” into horror-movie gold. The polishing of the Craven oeuvre — and the punishing of innocent families — continues with “The Last House on the Left,” a toned-down, tarted-up remake of that auteur’s infamously brutal 1972 debut film.  A study of operatic vengeance and dueling family values, this stylish renovation by Dennis Iliadis remains mostly true to the original story of a bereaved couple (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) whose teenage daughter (Sara Paxton) is attacked by a clan of on-the-lam sociopaths. Replacing the earlier movie’s more depraved sequences with sustained tension and truly unnerving editing, the director proves adept at managing mayhem in cramped spaces: a six-person struggle in a barreling S.U.V. is a small miracle of controlled chaos.  Working with the cinematographer Sharone Meir (who shot the marvelously oppressive “Mean Creek”), Mr. Iliadis alternates visceral violence — a knife slowly entering a girl’s quivering stomach, a garbage disposal chewing relentlessly on a man’s hand — with interludes of dreamy anxiety. And though I have never actually heard a skull exploding in a microwave, I suspect the movie’s sound designers deserve some kind of an award: thanks to them, the damage one can inflict with small appliances and a giant grudge is all too clear.  “The Last House on the Left” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are raped, stabbed, shot, mangled and fed to labor-saving devices.

The low-budget grunginess that helped make Wes Craven's 1972 original "Last House on the Left" an unsettling memento of its era is wiped clean in Dennis Iliadis' remake -- one unnecessary on every level save the paramount commercial one. Tweaked in ways that seem less like updates than concessions to current genre conventions -- complete with more graphic gore and sexual violence -- this tale of very bad things happening to very nice people should clean up at the B.O. But if the original could be accused of having a real point (even a subtext), the uninspired redo has none whatsoever.
Much-imitated even in its famous adline ("To avoid fainting, keep repeating, 'It's only a movie ... '"), Craven's film sparked unusual controversy (as well as long-term popularity) for a drive-in movie. It was decried as sleazy and sick by many mainstream critics, a truly disturbing reflection of the times by others. Latter cred was no doubt enhanced by its admitted inspirational source: Ingmar Bergman's "The Virgin Spring," which also centers on rape, murder and their fate-decreed avenging.
Manson murders, Altamont, rock-star deaths, an unbending Nixon White House and an unending Vietnam War, among other factors, had by 1972 made the moment eerily right for a crudely effective story of two weekend "hippie chicks" who have the ill fortune to meet up with some of the drug culture's scummiest bottom-dwellers. Even the pic's many clumsy elements added to a banality-of-evil air rife with disillusion and distrust.
This version blows that on several levels, separating the bad from the good right off as principal villain Krug (Garret Dillahunt) is rescued by confederates, leaving two cops dead. Meanwhile, the original's credibly ordinary family is replaced by a typically modern movie-fantasy clan: The Collingwoods consist of surgeon dad John (Tony Goldwyn), youthfully glam mum Emma (Monica Potter) and champion-swimmer daughter Mari (Sara Paxton), all vacationing in their country summer home, complete with detached guesthouse and dock.
When Mari opts to go out with friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac), the latter insists they score the premium-grade pot offered by shaggy fellow teen Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), a stranger. This goes well enough until the trio's motel-room antics are interrupted by the return of Krug (who is Justin's father), Sadie (Riki Lindhome) and "Uncle" Francis (Aaron Paul), who decide the girls pose a security risk. Taken to a rural road in the Collingwoods' appropriated SUV, the hostages attempt escape. But such efforts only worsen the young women's ever more dire straits.
Script by Carl Ellsworth ("Disturbia," "Red Eye") and Adam Alleca makes several significant changes to Craven's original. More than half the film now focuses on the parents' revenge, whereas before it was more of a macabre coda. "Junior" is no longer a moronic adult junkie, but innocent pearl-in-a-dungheap Justin. And the finale softens "House's" blows with a soothing dose of reaffirmed family values.
Though it replaces the 1972 edition's rough-edged relentlessness with something more predictable, routinely packaged and occasionally turgid, the remake will still strike many as strong meat by current mainstream horror standards. Nevertheless, hyperbolic camerawork and body-blow Dolby thuds can't equal the queasy, plain impact of original's most upsetting moments. (Nor is Dillahunt -- handsome, buff and eventually shirtless -- any match for David Hess' Krug in palpable psychopathy.)
In his first English-language feature, Greek helmer Iliadis ("Hardcore") does a job that's workmanlike, if seldom more. The fate of Uncle Francis is a grotesque high point, but the final faceoff degenerates into protracted action-climax excess. Perfs are adequate.
South Africa substitutes for Northern California in the majority of the technically polished pic's scenes.

"That was the  most offensive display of sexualized violence I have ever  seen," one wilting fellow in need of a camphor hankie was overheard saying in the elevator.
Such blanching is the reaction Last House on the Left  is trolling for, but I doubt it will be typical. Permissibility has marched on since Wes Craven 's Last House  of 1972 and its infamous rape scene, which was tut-tutted by biddies who snuck peeks at a contraband Sanctuary  in their purple youth, and debated by rheumy barristers in the U.K.'s "video nasty" stings. Bureaucrats today have their hands full netting RapeLay , a hilariously ill-animated first-person Japanese sex-crime video game, at the border. Tyra is taking on Sasha Grey . Exploitation is now a niche DVD commodity, quaintly nostalgic, like stamp collecting. Last House , in which no transgression goes unpunished, seems practically a morality tale.
If anyone's incensed, it's the pseuds who automatically prefer the original to the remake, which saves the inconvenience of having to squeeze out a thought. The "original" Last House  was, famously, a child of plagiarism itself, copying the narrative framework from Ingmar Bergman 's 1960 Virgin Spring . If its release didn't invent what aficionados call the Rape-Revenge genre, it did inaugurate its Golden Age. The door was opened to Thriller: A Cruel Picture  in '74, which seemingly took place on a cold, low-gravity planet settled by Scandinavian designers, and the 1975 Italian knockoff Night Train Murders , released in the U.S. as Second House on the Left  (both more interesting than Last House  in almost every respect).
A teen (Sara Paxton ) on family vacation at the lake house ditches mom and pop for a night out with a gal pal. They fall in with a band of fugitive brigands, who, after pillaging their girl hostages, gussy up like a real family to gain shelter for the night in the nearest house—belonging to a certain couple whose daughter hasn't come home yet. Hilarity ensues.
Director Dennis Iliadis  is a Greek import on his first English-language film (shot around Cape Town , South Africa , playing Vacationland, USA). His habit of using Howitzer-force Dolby  for shock impact is cheap, but one graceful set piece shows promise—Paxton, fleeing her attackers, sinking into the water in one lithe camera movement, the tempo of her plunging breaststroke cross-cut with bullets streaking past her underwater as she pounds toward a bend, cover, and safety.
Where Craven's film compounded sniggery sadism and class clowning—the comic relief is actually harder to get through than the rape—this new House  tries to sustain a grave, heavy sense of threat. It fails, through its villainy; this trio of baddies resembles a dive-bar slumming suburban psychobilly band, no meth-breath hazards. They're most at home posing as polite day-trippers in a well-appointed kitchen. Moll Martha MacIsaac 's manicure stays intact through untold brutalities. Garret Dillahunt , as top-man Krug, only exudes real physical threat in the film's climactic brawl, where, prowling shirtless à la Cape Fear , he displays the keglike torso of a UFC journeyman and suplexes Dad Tony Goldwyn  through a showroom's worth of breakaway furniture.
In the leisure of exposition, the camera appreciates Paxton's A-cups and faunlike gams in shorty shorts. Then comes the violation, numb and grimy, a "Is this what you wanted to see?" bait-and-switch sneer. Aptly named Craven started his career of gassy obfuscations excusing this away, neutralizing visceral acid with base bunkum, scattering references to "Vietnam " or "Nixon " as needed. All of this befits an AWOL academic whose dream project was Music of the Heart  and who has made a retirement plan out of cheapening his imprimatur with straight-to-DVD dreck and relicensing his back-catalog. (Raise your hand if you're excited for the Shocker  remake. . . . Nobody?)
This Last House  will, most likely, attract no especial outrage and have no subsequent obligation to justify its gunky, atavistic subject matter, untouched by the light of higher reason. It may qualify as progress that primordial slog only needs to be "about" the ambiguous squirm that comes from sitting out an excruciatingly staged despoilment, the queasy pleasure reflex that kicks in when watching retribution in action.
