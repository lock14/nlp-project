You don�t have to be Jewish to enjoy this light romantic comedy, but it helps. Younger directed the terrific Wall Street-wannabes flick Boiler Room
 in 2000, and this film, dotted with Manhattan landmarks like the Magnolia Bakery and the Cinema Village, plays at times like a more youthful ode to the city along the lines of Woody Allen�s Manhattan
: It replaces Gershwin with Jay-Z (and, for a moment, Coltrane), while turning the tables on the Allen and Mariel Hemingway May-December romantics. Here, it�s the 37-year-old divorc�e Rafi (a luminous Thurman who simply hasn�t looked this beautiful or poised in a long, long time) who, at the behest of her analyst Dr. Metzger (Streep), strikes out to discover what she�s been missing while wed to a schnook these past nine years. As fate and the vagaries of romcom screenwriting would have it � the excellent scriptwork here comes from Younger as well � what she�s been missing is some much-needed 23-year-old shvantz
 and its attendant all-encompassing Jewishness that arrives in the form of aspiring artist David Bloomberg (Greenberg). After a chance meeting in a theatre line while Rafi�s seeking solace from her gay fashionista pals, the pair hook up for dinner, an event that goes so well they begin toppling into love. But, of course, there�s that age thing, which runs skirmishes on their lovestruck, moony smiles every chance it gets. As Rafi confesses to her shrink, "Shouldn�t
 I be worried?" Dr. Metzger�s answer, essentially, is no, get out there and sow those wild oats � after all, they�re both in their sexual prime (hence the film�s title). What nobody yet realizes (and although the revelation arrives early in the film, this next sentence constitutes a spoiler, so beware) is that young David is in fact Dr. Metzger�s son. Which suddenly opens the film up to a whole new world of flinchy acting technique for Streep, who can wring more laughs out of a single facial twitch than almost anyone else. The film�s central question then branches out into one of doctor-patient ethics in addition to the propriety of the character�s ages, and from there to a ribald, no-holds-barred examination of everything from a mother�s love and its implied boundaries (and as any Jewish kid�ll tell you, there are precious few boundaries in a Jewish family) to why men tend to stray for younger women ("There�s something to it!" exclaims a carnally blissed-out Rafi). Younger�s film has a wise way about it; he rarely takes the easy way out, whether he�s touching on inter-religious relationships (Rafi is a gentile), the vague borderline between being a young man and being a man, or the sanctity of one�s own space, however tiny, in the Manhattan real estate market. What makes Prime
 work as well as it does, though, is the genuine sparks between its two lovestruck leads, the sweet-natured but socially and emotionally post-adolescent David and the sensual, worldly Rafi � they couldn�t come from more distant backgrounds had they just dropped in from Mars, Venus, or even Boise. Again to its credit, Younger�s film has a bittersweet cast hanging over the proceedings; with a mix of social and religious milieus such as this it�s difficult to imagine things working out in anyone
�s favor, and director and cast are smart enough to not shy away from a romantic comedy that can only end, if not badly, then at least in the melancholy tears of lessons hard won.


In ''Prime," a surprisingly smart romantic comedy, Uma Thurman plays Rafi Gardet, a stunning New Yorker who's going through a divorce. After a week of being legally single, she starts seeing David Bloomberg (Bryan Greenberg), a lanky and handsome artist who's insecure about his paintings. He calls her up and asks her out after they meet one night. She's reluctant to keep dating him: he's 23; she's 37 (the prime numbers to which the movie presumably refers). To her, the age difference ''smells of pool boy" at a resort.
That's what Rafi tells her therapist, the wise and insightful Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep). Lisa is also friendly, encouraging, and motherly. For 23 years that maternal energy has been aimed at David, who is her son.
When Lisa finds this out, she is supposed to self-destruct with shock. She wants her son to marry a Jew -- his own age. But the movie doesn't go for farce, and tries instead to treat this snag as a real problem, one that David and Rafi become aware of long after Lisa does.
Too many American movies about families feel like sitcoms, but in ''Prime," writer-director Ben Younger creates a scenario with real-life consequences for his characters. Not major consequences, but little shifts that provide occasions for growth. As Hollywood movies go, this is unexpected and cosmopolitan, like finding a Euro in your box of Cracker Jack.
Younger's first movie, 2000's ''Boiler Room," prepared me to dislike this second one. ''Boiler Room" was a cocky stew of new-jack cinema -- Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street" meets a make-my-daddy-proud melodrama -- set in the world of do-it-yourself brokerage firms.
The director of that movie had a chip on his shoulder. He needed to grow up. With ''Prime," he has.
The movie could have been a string of grotesque insults, like last spring's ''Monster-in-Law." Once Lisa connects the dots between her patient's new love and her son's, Streep mines the physical comedy, but doesn't become a harridan. She knocks around her office until she makes a dramatic collapse in a chair. Her grief and exasperation feel just right.
Disgusted as Lisa is, she continues to treat Rafi. Her patient's happiness comes before her own, so, outrageously, she endures Rafi's ecstatic descriptions of sex with her son. Lisa also has to sit through Rafi's frustration with the lack of structure in David's life. He doesn't know what to do with himself, she complains. He lives with his grandparents, and his family doesn't seem to take his painting seriously, so he doesn't. (They should: They're vivid, urban oil portraits by Tim Okamura.)
Rafi complements David's aimlessness. She's a well-connected photo shoot producer. She introduces him to John Coltrane's music and an art dealer who likes David's work. And ''No. 203" is their favorite Mark Rothko painting.
Yes, Younger has made an update of the ''shiksa who changed my life" story in ''Annie Hall." But ''Prime" is missing the psychological acuity and scabrous cultural wit of Woody Allen at his best. These lovers meet standing in line to see Antonioni's ''Blow-Up" and never mention the movie.
Instead, ''Prime" has an of-the-moment rhythm that feels authentically, youthfully downtown. David and his best friend, Morris (Jon Abrahams), a preppy hip-hop Jew, wear trendy T-shirts with slogans such as ''Palestinians do it better." (Morris also happens to be a jolly misogynist who lives in a dump and throws pies in women's faces. But never mind: They're from Magnolia Bakery, the hipster's pastry shop of choice. ) There's also a sexy sequence in which David takes Rafi to a multiracial house party full of people who actually seem to be dancing to the classic Junior M.A.F.I.A. song on the soundtrack.
The great tensions in ''Prime" are not romantic but lifestyle-driven. The keepin'-it-realism of Lisa's parental and religious wishes is incompatible with David's open-minded, post-collegiate drift, which is at odds with Rafi's very adulthood. Lisa, Rafi, David, and even nasty little Morris have to ask whether how we live determines who we love and who loves us. Put that way, Younger isn't paging Woody Allen. He's channeling Carrie Bradshaw.


         Ben Younger's "Prime" has to have one of the most appealing comedic premises in a long time; when I first heard about it, I had the feeling I'd been waiting for it. The story sets up one of the most squirm-inducing triangles ever committed to film: Thirty-seven-year-old Rafi Gardet (Uma Thurman) has just gone through a painful divorce, throughout which she has relied on the support and encouragement of her therapist, Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep). When Rafi meets a cute 23-year-old painter named Dave Bloomberg (Bryan Greenberg), she is charmed but hesitant to get involved. Ever supportive, Lisa urges Rafi to have fun while it lasts — until she discovers that the lad in question is her own son. Lisa must decide whether to continue treating the fragile Rafi, on the chance that the affair will play itself out, or come clean about what she knows.
 
  Despite the snappy brilliance of the setup, "Prime" doesn't entirely deliver on its promise — something about the way it ends feels like a cop-out, and the opportunities for humor aren't exploited quite as well as they could be. Part of the problem is that more time is spent on the sweet but otherwise unexciting romance between Rafi and Dave than on the excruciating relationship between Rafi and Lisa — clearly the more interesting dynamic. "Prime" does offer a clever and cheerful sendup of the limits of the therapeutic relationship, not to mention its unrealistic double-standards, without ever sliding into mean-spirited histrionics à la "Monster-in-Law." But it might have delved a little deeper into the feelings that arise between Rafi and the woman she has turned into her surrogate mother — a mother whose support and admiration, it turns out, are more hypothetical than heartfelt.
 


         






    As a therapist, Lisa encourages Rafi to "live for the now, for now," even though her patient has made it clear she's worried about things like having a baby. When it comes to her much-younger son, however, Lisa is hardly so free-to-be-you-and-me. A controlling Jewish mother hen, she endlessly lectures Dave on the importance of marrying within his faith and not entering into relationships he knows he can't commit to.
 
  This is an interesting question, but it feels slightly beside the point. You get the sense that Lisa's real problem with the relationship is slightly less lofty and that she doesn't quite have the guts to admit to her own prejudices. Streep plays the stereotype to the hilt, fanning herself in distress and attacking a pastrami sandwich as though it were the transubstantiated hussy that's corrupting her son. And Thurman's role, in some ways, is equally thankless. Rafi looks gorgeous, lives well and gets to enjoy herself for a while, but she can never quite shake an air of embarrassment over the way things have turned out. She looks diminished, almost apologetic at times, though to look at her is to feel that she's earned the right not to have to apologize for her life. Demi was never this demure.
 
  In some of the movie's most poignant scenes — which are also some of its best — Rafi tries gamely to regain Lisa's love not as a patient but as a potential member of the family. Lisa's clear inability to make the shift is painful to watch, and it subtly throws the value of her work into question. It's especially poignant as Rafi reminds Lisa that her family represents the kind of family she herself never had; a fact of which Lisa would have been aware. Streep's comedic timing is perfect, but her character comes off as too unself-aware and unsympathetic to be entirely convincing as the therapist Rafi loved.Greenberg is handsome and charming as the romantic muffin who may or may not know what he's getting into, and the movie presents their relationship in a realistic, not at all caricatured light. But aside from a few riffs on sloppiness and Nintendo addiction, the movie leaves the little disconnects inherent in any 14-year span lying around untouched. Aside from one scene in which Dave reveals that he hasn't heard of John Coltrane — not exactly Rafi's contemporary, anyway — the issue of cultural referents as both time markers and identity shapers is left sadly unexplored. It's a missed opportunity, given that these days it's impossible for any thirtysomething not to be reminded of his or her age when the Smiths are being piped as comforting nostalgia through the speakers at Whole Foods. At times, the movie feels like a tribute to "Annie Hall" — a movie Rafi would have likely seen before Dave was born, but the subject of movies and TV shows never comes up. (Nothing says "you're old" like talking to someone who was born after "Alf.") It's this kind of thing that's missing from "Prime" — the kind of thing that wouldn't even cross your mind if its premise weren't so deliciously good, and didn't leave you wanting more.
 
 'Prime'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13
 
 Times guidelines:
 Some explicit language and sexual themes
 
 A Universal Pictures release. Written and directed by Ben Younger. Executive producers Mark Gordon, Bob Yari. Produced by Suzanne Todd and Jennifer Todd. Director of photography William Rexer.   

It all works out in Prime , just don't ask how: In the beginning, Dr. Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep), a Jewish psychotherapist in Manhattan, is worried sick because her beloved only son, David (One Tree Hill 's Bryan Greenberg), is involved with a babe (Uma Thurman) who's not only 14 years older than he is and a gentile but also Dr. Metzger's patient. Plus, David wants to be an artist, and what kind of career is that for a princeling? By the end, everyone's okay with everything because  well, because the therapist in this brazenly preposterous romantic comedy is Meryl Streep, whipping up shameless fun by miming what verklemmt looks like among a certain population of middle-aged public-radio tote-bag carriers.
Not one bit of the story tracks. But with these women in these roles, you're asking for truth? Prime  (written and directed by Boiler Room 's Ben Younger) is much more interested in the interpretation of dreams than how a hottie like Thurman could be interested in a blandy like Greenberg.

 The press notes for "Prime" (which does not, sad to say, quite live up to its name) describe its central romance as a May-December affair. That may be overstating it. True, Rafi, the older, female half of the couple, is 14 years older than her beau, but Rafi is played by Uma Thurman, who doesn't look a day older than the middle of July. Her summery radiance helps make this thin romantic comedy hard to dislike.  Rafi, when we meet her, is 37 - if you call that December, then I must be, well, dead - and freshly divorced. One evening at an Antonioni double feature, she bumps into David (Bryan Greenberg), a sweet, 23-year-old aspiring painter who lives with his grandparents. The difference in their ages makes them a little nervous, but the more serious obstacle comes from David's family. For one thing, they don't approve of him dating a non-Jewish woman, and for another, his mother, Lisa, happens to be Rafi's therapist.  Lisa is played by Meryl Streep, in a strenuous but not unamusing performance that suggests Dr. Melfi from "The Sopranos" crossed with Molly Goldberg, the Yiddishe Mama dynamo from the long-running radio and television series. As she did in Mike Nichols's adaptation of "Angels in America" on HBO, Ms. Streep shows her fondness for Yiddish inflections and polite ethnic shtick. To which I can only say: Meryl, enough already! So you can say tuchis  and nosh on some pastrami. Mazel tov! Jackie Mason you're not.  As for "Prime," well, as my bubbe used to say, comme ci, comme ça. It was written and directed by Ben Younger, whose first film, "Boiler Room," pulsed with raw, youthful urban energy. This is a tamer, if also more polished, effort, and it has some moments of energy, both comic and sexual, as well as a fondness for real Manhattan locations. The bows to romantic comedy convention seem perfunctory. There is the inevitable goofy male sidekick (Jon Abrahams, as a guy who likes to throw cream pies in the faces of women he's dated) as well as the obligatory gay friend (Zak Orth). Also, of course, the bickering Jewish grandparents (Jerry Adler and Doris Belack).  Like David himself, the picture is genial and unassuming, dusting off and quietly updating some of the themes associated with Philip Roth and Woody Allen. If the brilliant, hyperarticulate angst that drives characters like Alexander Portnoy and Alvy Singer is missing from David, so too is the vengeful edge of misogyny. His mother is pushy but not monstrous, and his desire for Rafi is pretty straightforward.  All of this makes the movie pleasant, but not very memorable - a pale mirror image of "Shopgirl," which touches on some similar themes. Mr. Greenberg, a heartthrob on the WB series "One Tree Hill," is not much of a big-screen presence, and he is nearly pushed out of the movie by Ms. Streep and Ms. Thurman, who bring enormous reservoirs of feeling to their roles. There are times when Ms. Thurman seems more alive - funnier, hungrier, tougher and more sensitive - than the movie itself.  "Prime" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and steamy (though not very explicit) sex scenes.

 mama turn by Meryl Streep and a sensitively nuanced perf by Uma Thurman in a convincing changeup from her recent kickass action roles, "Prime" remains an oddly juiceless older woman-younger man romance, with a Freudian twist. Lead actresses acquit themselves swimmingly, generating believable chemistry and plenty of estrogen, with boychik
 Bryan Greenberg also passing muster. But secondary characters, drearily one-dimensional, die on the vine in a slick but cliche script by writer-director Ben Younger ("Boiler Room") that narratively hedges its bets. Even for femme auds, "Prime," skedded to open Oct. 28, rates a cut below grade A.
Rafi (Thurman) has just terminated a loveless nine-year marriage and is dependent on her shrink, Lisa Metzger (Streep), for friendship and support. That support is seriously threatened when Rafi starts dating and sleeping with David (Greenberg), who happens to be Metzger's son (a fact Metzger discovers but which is unknown to everyone else).
Rafi wrestles with the problems inherent in a relationship with a much younger man, from his adolescent reluctance to clean the apartment when he moves in to his occasional preference for Nintendo over sex. Meanwhile, would-be artist David, who lived with his grandparents and was discouraged from taking his painting seriously, strives to hide the full extent of his immaturity from his stylish, sophisticated paramour.
Metzger, the most conflicted character, finds her genuine affection for Rafi to be jeopardized -- Metzger's liberal, laissez-faire acceptance of her patient's sexuality turns out to be at odds with her motherly fear of shiksas
 and need to control her son.
The Modern Romantic Comedy has become more elusive than the Great American Novel these days, and, in his updated spin, helmer-scribe Younger has baited viewers with one too many hooks. The course of true love is doubly roughed by the fact that the lovers are not only separated by age (she is a gorgeous-looking 37, he a hunky-but-sensitive 23) but religion as well. Streep's rather broad interpretation of the "Jewish mother," with its fine comic flourishes, would play beautifully except for the fact that she's surrounded by a family of flat, joyless caricatures that sap the ethnic juices out of the whole religious "dilemma."
Thurman, on her side, exists in an equally one-note milieu of rich gay men friends, snooty in-people and sterile open spaces (stark, vast art galleries or studio haute couture
 shoots) that generally signal WASPdom as the absence of local color. Only Annie Parisse, as one of Thurman's svelte, fashion industry friends, manages to breathe life into her severely limited sidekick role.
The same cannot be said of David's boyhood chum Morris (John Abrahams) who, in lieu of a personality, is granted a propensity to anoint ex-girlfriends with custard pies in a running gag that gets less and less funny. Greenberg, a relative unknown, actually succeeds in essaying the difficult, seemingly oxymoronic role of sexy mama's boy David.
But film's main focus is the relationship between the two gals, as Streep and Thurman's obvious enjoyment in playing off each other enhances their double entendre-laden psychiatric sessions. Rafi's ingenuous, wonderfully delivered concerns about robbing the cradle and confidences about her young lover's sexual prowess are received by Dr. Metzger with nicely mingled therapeutic encouragement and maternal horror. At the same time, the frumpified, Joy Behar-esque Streep and the blond, willowy, va-va-voom-y Thurman rep two separate aspects of the same woman, the matriarchal and sexual sides comically dialoguing at cross-purposes.
Unfortunately, Younger's decision to foreground his stars against an underwritten, poorly thesped sea of mediocrity serves not to empower their portrayals but to strand them. Even pic's relatively lucid denouement is sabotaged by Younger's need to validate all his characters' possible choices: The helmer appears as loath to endorse May-December romances or mixed-religious pairings as he is to criticize them.
Tech credits are impressively polished, particularly in pic's understated use of Gotham locations, nicely textured in William Rexer's lensing. Ryan Shore's score and Jim Black's music selections, however, are often annoyingly intrusive.

No, it's not a prequel to last year's vertiginous Sundance prizewinner. In his sophomore feature, Ben Younger  (Boiler Room ) attempts to reinvent himself as a young Woody Allen , reversing the Woodman's age and gender dynamics but yielding mortifying moments all the same. Two weeks after getting divorced, 37-year-old Rafi (Uma Thurman ) falls for 23-year-old David (Bryan Greenberg ), not realizing that his mother Lisa (an owlish, bewigged Meryl Streep ) is also her therapist. Thus, "cute" scenes where Thurman tells mom about having sex on every surface in the apartment, to Lisa's humiliation but Rafi's oblivious delight. Somehow, mother has reasoned against informing either party that she knows the other, and so this allegedly sophisticated comedy quickly descends into immaturity.

Like Rafi's arrested-adolescent suitor, the movie gets everything just a little off. Bless Younger for actually shooting in New York, but since when did Cinema Village show Antonioni double bills? Would a Lower East Side resident go all the way to Magnolia Bakery for pies (as opposed to cupcakes)? The jailbait angle is softened by the fact that Greenberg looks closer to his actual age of 27; in any case, there's not one straight 23-year-old male in the world who would throw over sex with Thurman to play another round of Nintendo , nor is it likely that his stereotypically Jewish mother would go an entire film without once mentioning where her son went to college. The relationship would be easier to root for if Greenberg and Thurman demonstrated something like chemistry, but miscasting makes Younger's third-act complications seem both tentative and arbitrary. Not quite a romance by numbers, Prime  is nevertheless a movie we need like a hole in the head.
