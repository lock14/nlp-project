"The Rocker" is a grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle. It wears better on Rainn Wilson, the movie's ungainly, oft-humiliated star. Like Black in "School of Rock," Wilson, too, plays a washed-up musician reborn in the glow of youth. But the tots in that 2003 comedy have been replaced with a trio of nice Cleveland teens whose band needs a drummer. Occasional hilarity ensues.
A lot of it comes at Wilson's expense. He's less combustible than Black, but there's a lot more drama in his face that he never unleashes on "The Office," where his doofus suck-up, Dwight, goes about his schemes as deadpan as possible. Wilson is still playing a doofus, but he's all over the place here. His character, Robert "Fish" Fishman, used to drum for a hard-rock, heavy metal, glam outfit called Vesuvius. He was dumped right before the band dominated the world. That was 20 years ago. Now the group is bound for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Fish is freshly fired, recently dumped, and suddenly living with his sister and brother-in-law (Jane Lynch and Jeff Garlin). Their husky, soft-spoken son (Josh Gad) plays keyboards in a wimp-rock band called A.D.D.
Fish humiliates the band at the prom after he erupts all over a polite cover of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" then turns them famous after a footage of playing nude and sweaty becomes a viral-video hit. The movie certainly knows how the music-industry paradigm has shifted. YouTube is the new Dick Clark, and the movie, which Peter Cattaneo ("The Full Monty") directed, looks accordingly homemade. Cattaneo does make sure the movie's heart is in the right place. There are some nice human trimmings, including Christina Applegate, who does some decent sparring with Wilson as the mother of one of the kids in the band. After Fish gets A.D.D. arrested, she becomes a chaperone.
There is, of course, some vomiting on Wilson's behalf. But "The Rocker" is gross by obligation. Wilson seems required to be obnoxious almost because that's what would be expected of Black were he here. Behind the drum kit Wilson comes orgasmically alive. And he's somehow even better imparting life lessons to his much younger costars.
The movie is much more persuasive as an overlong work of sensitivity. A.D.D.'s frontman is an earnest brooder named Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and his entire songbook appears to be about his missing father (sample lyric: "You should have been here to teach me how to drive"). It's possible the movie, which the wife-husband team of Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky wrote, is going for satire of emo earnestness. After the band hits it big, A.D.D. releases an album called "Abandonment Issues." The movie is too gently performed to draw blood of any kind. Even with its head in the maw of fame, there is no suspense about whether the group will survive the resulting tiffs, which are best described as "early reality television."
Geiger, Gad, and Emma Stone, who plays the group's bassist, are easily the best things in the movie - so good that they make Wilson seem superfluous. And yet the band's love of Fish is sincere. They're not angling for attitudinal hipster shtick (in college perhaps) or know-it-all sarcasm. They're just good, smart, interesting kids playing lame music from the bottom of their hearts.


There's a certain kind of lamely domesticated, corporate, lit-like-a-floor-wax-commercial rock & roll comedy that makes you feel faintly embarrassed for the people who made it. I still recall wincing through 1994's Airheads  (remember Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler  billed third!  in their hair-metal wigs?), and The Rocker , with Rainn Wilson as a metal drummer from the '80s who just missed out on stardom, is a similar oil slick of ''rebellious'' sitcom attitude.
The only brazen thing about the film is how shamelessly it rips off School of Rock , recycling its flaky-educator loser-of-the-gods premise, only this time in high school. Wilson's ''Fish'' Fishman, who got tossed out of his band in 1986 (just before they made it big), is now an anonymous never-was who agrees to drum in his teenage nephew's band; they're a brainy crew of freaks and geeks, and he sets about teaching them the Spirit of Rock & Roll. Jack Black made School of Rock  great because he was an authentic embodiment of that spirit and  a walking air-guitar doofus. But Rainn Wilson has no wild-child demons, no inner rock star; he's a guy who belongs  in an office cubicle. (He's like the rogue son of Garrison Keillor.) The fifth or sixth time you hear him wrap his all-too-sane and innocuous delivery around a line like ''I'm going to be responsible, all right  for partying till my nuts catch fire!'' you want to shout: Enough already! Let his nuts catch fire! Maybe then he'll surprise us.

 Correction Appended  Watching Rainn Wilson gyrate through the motions of being a rock ’n’ roll wild man in the middling comedy “The Rocker,” you can’t help wondering if Mr. Wilson (from “The Office”) is inhabiting a role that was originally turned down by Jack Black. Despite the maniacal glint in Mr. Wilson’s eyes, he is a decidedly nerdy hell-raiser in comparison with Mr. Black, who conjures memories of the rampaging John Belushi. Mr. Wilson, for all his quirky charm, is no volcano.  That said, he is perfectly adequate in the role of a superannuated 41-year-old teenager with a chip on his shoulder. His character, Robert Fishman, a k a Fish, is a flamboyant drummer who, as the movie begins, is cheated out of his  moment of glory when a record company offers his heavy metal band, Vesuvius,  the moon and stars on the condition that he be replaced by an executive’s nephew. The offer is too sweet to refuse, and Fish ends up stewing in wretched obscurity for 20 years before an unlikely second chance at rock ’n’ roll redemption presents itself.  Reduced to living in the attic in the home of his  sister Lisa (Jane Lynch), Fish agrees to be a substitute drummer in A.D.D, an amusingly named teenage band made up of  Lisa’s schlubby keyboard-playing son Matt (Josh Gad);  Amelia (Emma Stone), the group’s scowling quasi-punk bassist; and Curtis (the pop teen heartthrob Teddy Geiger), its mopey lead singer and songwriter.  Before their first gig, at Matt’s high school prom, Fish astounds his band mates by ostentatiously vomiting in his hand, which he then sticks in his pocket. The “pocket full of puke” ritual, he proudly declares, is the rock ’n’ roll equivalent of carrying a rabbit’s foot. Although his out-of-control drum solo ruins the prom, A.D.D. decides to stay together after Fish vows to get them a real club gig, a promise on which he makes good.  In this technologically savvy movie, the band rehearses by Webcam with Fish playing nude in the ratty basement of a Chinese restaurant. Clips of “the Naked Drummer,” as he is called, find their way onto YouTube, and A.D.D. becomes an Internet sensation. Matchbox Records, the same label that signed Vesuvius two decades earlier, comes calling in the person of David Marshall (Jason Sudeikis), the ne plus ultra of sleazy, jive-talking record executives.  What happens next is entirely predictable. To the chagrin of the band members’ parents, A.D.D goes on the road, and Fish finally gets to live the wild rock lifestyle he always longed for as his sober band mates look on in amazement. The movie carries off the trick of conjuring nostalgia for the bad old days when bands trashed hotel rooms and drank themselves into oblivion while making such behavior appear pathetic.  A minor romance blossoms between Fish and Curtis’s mother, Kim (an ill-used Christina Applegate), who is chaperoning the tour and has her own fond rock ’n’ roll memories. The inevitable showdown between A.D.D. and Vesuvius takes place on the eve of Vesuvius’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the hometown of both bands. In the 20 years since Vesuvius dumped Fish, its members have developed conspicuously phony British accents.  But if “The Rocker,” directed by Peter Cattaneo (“The Full Monty”), has its witty moments, the movie is encrusted in rock lore and stale attitudinizing borrowed from “This Is Spinal Tap” and “School of Rock,” each of which it shamelessly cannibalizes. Most disappointingly, the music is tepid, mediocre pop pastiche. There is absolutely nothing special about A.D.D. In its portrayal of a rock culture that was once synonymous with liberating self-expression, everything is secondhand and done by rote. Hip has become rigidly, thuddingly square.  “The Rocker”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It has nudity and some strong language.

While Rainn Wilson handles cubicle work with aplomb on TV's "The Office," he's also right at home onstage in "The Rocker," playing a heavy-metal burnout who gets a second shot at stardom -- never mind that success comes 20 years too late, drumming at his nephew's high school prom. It's the kind of role ready-made for Jack Black (had "School of Rock" not happened), and Wilson makes the most of it in this well-crafted, feel-good satire. With the right word of mouth, Fox could have a modest hit with the Aug. 20 release.
For those who loved "The Full Monty," "The Rocker" also marks a return to form for director Peter Cattaneo, tapping into the same winsome, risk-everything spirit that defined the 1997 hit. Working with "Seeing Other People" scribes Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky, Cattaneo puts character first: Wilson's Robert Fishman, or "Fish" to his friends, may be an outrageous fortysomething man-child, but he's not a character you grow tired of by the second act.
Two decades after his heavy-metal bandmates sold him out for a record contract, the former drummer still prickles at the very mention of his band Vesuvius. The other members are on the brink of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, while he's stuck answering phones at a dead-end desk job with nothing more than his ponytail and sideburns left to suggest his more flamboyant stage presence.
Fired from work and forced to move back in with his sister (Jane Lynch) and their family, Fish reluctantly agrees to join the band of her awkward teen son (Josh Gad) and his outcast friends (emo-eyed Teddy Geiger and "Superbad's" Emma Stone), who perform mopey pop ballads under the name ADD. No sooner is Fish back at the kit than he's stealing the show, turning a slow-dance rendition of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" into a rafter-rattling drum solo.
The band is appalled (it doesn't help that Fish hits on the lead singer's mom, played by Christina Applegate), but his enthusiasm is contagious, and they're soon practicing together via webcam. Not quite familiar with the technology, Fish jams in the nude, a sight that inevitably makes its way onto YouTube, attracting a shady manager (Jason Sudeikis) eager to rep "the Naked Drummer."
The band takes off (a commentary of sorts on the tween-driven state of the music biz) and, with ADD and Vesuvius on the same label, it's only a matter of time before Fish has to face the musicians who betrayed him (played by Will Arnett, Fred Armisen and Bradley Cooper).
Fish's arc unfolds more or less according to formula, with even the smallest subplots playing out as expected, but the material cuts together; in other words, auds needn't be stoned or drunk to appreciate a comedy that troubles to provide some old-fashioned structure.
But the cast still has room to riff, and with this inspired performance, Wilson's comic persona is truly taking shape. As in "The Office," he plays the self-righteous buffoon, with each belligerent outburst making his character seem an even bigger fool.
The weak link is the film's music, which is neither funny nor particularly memorable. It's easy enough to parody Fish's hair-metal roots, but it's hard to imagine someone who quips, "Loads of elevators play Celine Dion -- that doesn't make it right," getting his fix drumming such vanilla tunes. (The recent indie air-drum parody "Adventures of Power" may not have this pic's polish, but it does understand the instrument better.)
Seamless Toronto-for-Cleveland production design and crisp visuals from lenser Anthony B. Richmond complement Cattaneo's efficient direction. Instead of feeling like a "Saturday Night Live" sketch that overstays its welcome, the entire operation has a certain momentum, growing steadily to the climactic burst of Europe's "The Final Countdown" -- a rock anthem the likes of which these characters could never touch.
Check out 'The Rocker' Movie Trailer:





Directed by Peter Cattaneo , The Rocker 's more or less the Pete Best Story —the tale of a poor bastard who gets shitcanned right on the brink of record-bin immortality. The film opens in Cleveland, mid-1980s, where Rainn Wilson 's Robert "Fish" Fishman is behind the kit for Vesuvius , a metal band fronted by three head-bobbing, hair-waving morons (Will Arnett , Fred Armisen , and Bradley Cooper ) whose loyalty only extends to the dotted line. Told to either ditch their drummer or lose a deal with a record label, his bandmates choose the former, sending Fish into a tailspin from which he never recovers. Until decades later, that is, when he falls in with A.D.D., the high-school band for which his portly, pale nephew (Josh Gad ) plays keyboard. Fish wins over the sulking, songwriting frontman (Teddy Geiger ) and the brooding, scowling guitarist (Emma Stone ), and they're signed and touring and sell-out famous within hours of making their inauspicious Interwebs debut. Sooner or later, they're forced to choose between opening for Vesuvius or busting up the band. A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers  sitcom on the Disney Channel , The Rocker  comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasn't bought music since it was sold "on records," or ever met a music executive who wasn't a character in This Is Spinal Tap  . This is sugary-sweet stuff—pop instead of rock.
