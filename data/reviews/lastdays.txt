         A skinny guy sporting a stringy platinum pageboy and pajama pants wanders around the forest somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. He's muttering to himself as if arguing with someone he can't bring himself to confront. Later he jumps in a river and spends a night in front of a campfire alone, singing "Home on the Range." In the morning, it's revealed that the wooded acreage he's been wandering is his own private property, and that it houses the turn-of-the-century mansion he and a handful of his rock-kid hangers-on call home. There, he fills his last days experimenting with eyeliner; eating sugary cereal and macaroni and cheese; avoiding the phone and occasionally settling down with his guitar. He watches a Boyz II Men video and entertains a Yellow Pages salesman. Once in a while, he clutches his stomach in pain. All the while, the camera is extraordinarily still and patient, letting him ramble and sprawl across the screen. It knows he's not going anywhere. It knows we know how this ends.
 
  Blake (Michael Pitt) isn't Kurt Cobain, exactly, although he's a dead ringer for him at a distance, his hair veiling his face. And his house isn't really in Seattle. ("Last Days," Gus Van Sant's latest in a trilogy of untimely death movies, was shot in upstate New York.) Very little of what happens on-screen is verifiable as fact, and none of it could be mistaken for an attempt at psychological inquiry or insight.
 


         






    The opposite of a biopic, "Last Days" assumes — and to some degree requires — that you pack your own back-story, biographical information, treasured memories, what have you, before embarking on this particular cinematic experience. Like "Elephant," Van Sant's amazing existentialist rumination on the Columbine High School massacre, "Last Days" is the fictional phenomenology of a specific time in the singular life of a character who resembles a particular rock star. Nothing is explained, and really happens — except that, as soon as it starts to become clear that the little bumps in the reverie aren't about to become major plot reversals (at one point, for instance, a strung-out Blake puts on a hunting cap and pokes a shotgun at a sleeping slacker, Elmer Fudd style, but no tragedy ensues) you start to wonder: What if you didn't know who this kid was supposed to be? Would the speaker-phone call from his bandmates clue us in to his superstar status? Would the mansion, with its tenement kitchen and romantically peeling paint, adequately symbolize his sudden, massive wealth in all its absurdity? Would the screaming, swearing female voice on the telephone tell us all we needed to know about his marriage? Beats me. What "Last Days" offers is a blank and narrative-free, but pitch-perfect, dreamscape on which to project your own personal ruminations on Kurt, fame, whatever, nevermind. If you have none, you're on your own.
 
  Shot on digital video for very little money, the cast includes an actual Yellow Pages salesman; a well-known magician, Ricky Jay, in the part of a detective who detects nothing; and the mother of alternative rock, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, playing a concerned friend who tries to convince Blake to leave the house. This scene is enhanced by knowing that Gordon's career has been as long and influential as her personal life has been stable. (Her husband and bandmate, Thurston Moore, is credited as music consultant.) Gordon accuses Blake of skirting dangerously close to "rock star cliché" territory; a funny thing to say, since "Last Days" is at once unstintingly specific and willfully vague.
 
  Lyrical and unaccountably mesmerizing, "Last Days" is Van Sant's third film in a row — with "Elephant" (2003) and "Gerry" (2002), in which Casey Affleck and Matt Damon play friends who get lost in Death Valley while on a routine nature hike — to feature people dying young. Interestingly, Van Sant has taken the kinds of "true life" stories that are routinely exploited in television movies and turned them into quiet objects for contemplation. A beautiful, if often trying, film from an important American filmmaker "Last Days" feels like Van Sant's own private Nirvana. Maybe yours too. Or maybe not.

In Last Days , the writer-director Gus Van Sant draws us into the illusion that we're seeing the druggy, blithering, zoned-out final days of a rock star very much like  no, exactly like  Kurt Cobain. The fascination of Cobain's life and suicide is enduring, and that's a good thing for the movie, since it's doubtful that many would otherwise consider sitting through an art experiment as deliberately listless and meandering as Last Days, in which Van Sant presents the total absence of engagement or drama as an aging hipster's form of defiance. As ''Blake,'' Michael Pitt is shot mostly at a distance, his sandy blond long hair falling into his face, so that his thick placid features and strong stubbled chin make him look eerily like Cobain's double. For long stretches he wanders through the woods, mumbling to himself like a zombie Popeye, or stands around the mostly empty cavernous rooms of his remote, dilapidated house, munching on Cocoa Krispies (he's so out of it that he puts the cereal box, instead of the milk, into the fridge), scrawling in his diary, and engaging in random blitzed activities like parading around in a black slip as he diddles with a shotgun. Last Days  makes Van Sant's perversely antipsychological Columbine meditation, Elephant, look blandly mainstream, and at times the film wrung my patience dry. Yet there is a method to its madness, since the madness here is really Cobain's. Last Days  mythologizes his suicide as a haunting act of fulfillment: the consummation of a life that had already ceased to be.

 At the end of Gus Van Sant's mesmerizing dream of a film, "Last Days," the director adds a cautionary note. Although "inspired" by the last days of Kurt Cobain, the film ends with a disclaimer stating that "it is a work of fiction and the characters and events portrayed in the film are also fictional." A similar disclaimer could have been fixed to Cobain himself. By the time he put a shotgun to his head in April 1994, it had become hard to tell which Cobain was real and which was fiction - tortured genius, reluctant rocker, henpecked husband, depressive, addict or martyr - a mystery that only deepened after he was nailed to the cross.  Putting a gun to your head seems a poignantly symbolic act of violence for a star as uncomfortable with celebrity as Cobain claimed to be. This gruesome detail isn't in "Last Days," the 11th feature directed by Mr. Van Sant and one of this year's indisputably great films. The filmmaker freely borrows from Cobain's sad story, but "Last Days" is neither a straight biography nor one of those forensic narratives so beloved by television producers. An impressionistic portrait, "Last Days" is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime.  Set in and around a sprawling stone mansion situated amid a lushly green countryside (shot in upstate New York), the film tracks the comings and goings of a young musician named Blake (Michael Pitt) in the weeks, days or perhaps hours before his death. Blake lives in this house with its peeling paint and expensively distressed charm with a quartet of stragglers - played by Lukas Haas, Asia Argento, Scott Green and Nicole Vicius - none of whom pay him much mind. Blake spends most of his time wandering the grounds and trying to stay upright; during the film he also takes a swim, builds a fire, digs a hole and plays guitar. He lives and then he dies, without drama, weeping violins or explanation.  Beautifully shot by the cinematographer Harris Savides and edited by Mr. Van Sant, "Last Days" appears built out of everyday scenes with no apparent rhyme or reason, and at first the whole thing seems disjointed, almost randomly organized. The film opens with Blake walking through densely forested woods and mumbling. When he reaches a small lake, he peels off his clothes, jumps in and swims to the other side, where he stands on a rock with his bony back to the camera and urinates. Eventually, he arrives at the house where, sometime later (days? hours?), he prepares macaroni and cheese, an undertaking that doesn't lead to anything other than undercooked pasta and a bit of comedy when, after the packet of cheese falls out of the box, Blake mumbles something about "a prize."  Like Jim Jarmusch, Mr. Van Sant belongs to a generation of filmmakers that was independent long before Sundance was a gleam in the collective eye of Hollywood. In the mid-1980's, while living in Portland, Ore., he made "Mala Noche," a rough-cut jewel of a first feature about a gay dishwasher smitten with an illegal immigrant. As the 1980's gave way to the 1990's, and Mr. Van Sant took on increasingly commercial projects, the rhythms and colors of his filmmaking voice, as well as an interest in outsiders so touchingly expressed in films like "My Own Private Idaho," were muted by louder imperatives. His adventures in commercial moviemaking reached a nadir with "Finding Forrester," a film he directed without any evident commitment to the material or his vision.  If there is a single theme that unites his films, even the most commercial, it is the figure of the outsider, from the druggies in "Drugstore Cowboy" to the gay drifters in "My Own Private Idaho" and Matt Damon's working-class genius in "Good Will Hunting." For the most part, these stories are classically shaped narratives with defined beginnings, middles and ends, outsider stories told from deep inside the confines and safety of conventional narrative filmmaking. With the 2002 film "Gerry," a formally austere work in which two men travel through desert landscapes during an unspecified number of days, Mr. Van Sant began to separate story from its usual time-and-space coordinates. Things happen in "Gerry," but as in "Elephant," released in 2003, and "Last Days," it is never clear when or why; they just happen.  In hindsight, "Gerry" appears to be less of a radical break from Mr. Van Sant's past than an attempt to find a form, a way of telling his outsider stories, that makes you feel as dislocated as the characters. "Gerry" unfolds linearly, but in "Elephant," which presents a shooting at a high school, Mr. Van Sant repeats scenes from different points of view, playing with time as if it were elastic. In "Last Days," day follows night follows dusk follows day, and scenes are, again, shown from contrasting angles. Blake doesn't live according to the usual workaday rhythms of rise and shine. He is out of time, out of step and in the wilderness, a dislocation underscored by the stop-and-go rhythm of his routine: he walks, he nods off, he walks, he nods off.  One danger with this sort of strategy is that impatient (or unpracticed) viewers might be tempted into nodding off as well; like beauty, boredom is also in the eye of the beholder. But for all of this film's leisurely interludes, the images of Blake shuffling and sleeping, "Last Days" makes for hypnotic viewing. There are shivers of pleasure to be had watching an artist like Mr. Van Sant working at the top of his   powers, and shivers, too, from the actual, physical act of watching a film that arouses both the mind and the emotions. The voluptuous beauty of the images, the tenderness of the storytelling, the cruelty of situation, the carelessness of Blake's houseguests - taken together, these elements create an extraordinary experience.  Mr. Van Sant met Cobain in 1991 and has said he was unfamiliar with the musician's work at the time. Perhaps as a consequence, there isn't much about rock 'n' roll in "Last Days" or, for that matter, Nirvana and grunge. No Courtney-Love-like figure makes an on-camera appearance, though there is a blisteringly funny reference to a woman that one houseguest solemnly and somewhat fearfully refers to as "Herself." Still, while some of the details of the story are borrowed from Cobain's life, including the greenhouse where Blake occasionally hides from the world and the Tom Moore cigar box presumably containing drugs that he digs out of the ground, Mr. Van Sant never suggests that these details constitute any kind of psychological evidence, a way into the dead man and his thinking.  Mr. Van Sant's refusal to root around in Cobain's consciousness, to try to explain why and how he created, suffered and died, is a radical gesture, both in aesthetic and in moral terms. In one of the most powerful scenes in "Last Days," Mr. Van Sant plants the camera outside one of the house's picture windows. Inside, Blake moves about a room, playing guitar and then drums before moving on to a new instrument. The music continues even as he shifts instruments, with the drone of the guitar merging with the beat of the drums and the haunting sound of the singer's voice rising and falling. Slowly, Mr. Van Sant pulls the camera away from the window as if to acknowledge the mystery of artistic creation and everything that remains unknowable in other people's souls.  "Last Days" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has adult language, some discreet nudity and a little sexual romping.

Gus Van Sant continues in the "unplugged," low-fi vein of his last two pics ("Gerry," "Elephant") with "Last Days," a non-linear account of the final hours of rock star Blake (Michael Pitt). "Inspired," as per credits, by the suicide of grunge idol Kurt Cobain, "Last Days"-- like its predecessors -- resists offering whys and wherefores. Result is dead-on depiction of the hedonistic rock lifestyle, punctuated by sequences of haunting beauty but also quasi-religious imagery that borders on tacky. Slightly starrier cast than "Elephant" and interest in Cobain should ensure marginally higher returns, but also more mixed critical reaction.
"Last Days" is but the latest installment in the intriguingly eclectic career of Van Sant, one that's encompassed classically offbeat indie movies like "Drugstore Cowboy" and "My Own Private Idaho," a bizarre cover version of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," and more conventionally structured movies such as megahit "Good Will Hunting" and the much less boffo "Finding Forrester."
Following the critical mauling of "Forrester," Van Sant reinvented himself as an arthouse director. He was, by his own admission, deeply influenced by the sparse aesthetic of Magyar helmer Bela Tarr ("Satantango," "Werckmeister Harmonies") and other experimental filmmakers.
"Last Days" and the two films before it form a Tarrian trilogy, where long, painstakingly composed shots show characters doing mundane tasks for considerable stretches of time. Time is fractured and spirals back on itself, sometimes showing events several times.
But Van Sant has not simply facilely appropriated Tarr's visual mannerisms. Instead, he has used the style as a vehicle to explore obliquely larger social problems, like high school killings in "Elephant" or the toll of fame here, sidestepping the didacticism of more realist filmmaking.
Depicting the self-inflicted death of a rock star is unlikely to reap as much controversy as high school killings, except possibly from fanatical Cobain fans who might choose to ignore pic's legalese disclaimer that this fictional film was "inspired by the last days of Kurt Cobain," to whom it is also dedicated. Indeed, events depicted bear a striking similarity to some of the known facts about the last walk on the wild side of Cobain, lead singer and guitarist of Nirvana, who injected himself with a probably lethal amount of heroin in April 1994, and then shot himself both in the stomach and the head.
Curiously, "Last Days" fictional character Blake is never directly shown taking drugs or actually killing himself, although we do see him in various states of obvious intoxication throughout and toying with a shotgun. He even wears a hunting hat with ear flaps much like the one favored by Cobain in the last year of his life.
Otherwise, Blake's onscreen activities are mostly quotidian, at least for a drug-addled rock star. He's first seen babbling incoherently as he wanders through the woods to a stream where he takes a dip. Later, he's seen digging up a cigar box from his garden, playing music and mostly avoiding the various hangers-on who live in or come and go from his shabby mansion.
He does, however, receive a Yellow Book advertising salesman (real-life Yellow Book advertising salesman Thadeus A. Thomas) who has mistaken him for a locomotive parts dealer. When asked how successful his business has been since the last ad, Blake replies resonantly, "Success is subjective."
Oddly, it's the scenes where the least happens within lenser Harris Savides' Academy-ratio frame that have the most emotional impact despite the fact that one can seldom see Pitt's face under his curtain of blond hair. In one weirdly mesmerizing sequence, Blake, dressed in a woman's slip and thick boots, sinks slowly to his knees in a sun-filled room.
Later, Blake is shown twice making instant macaroni and cheese, first from a distance and then in one long continuous medium shot, an affectionate parody of the cooking sequences in Chantel Akerman's 1976 film "Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles." Both views are accompanied by the Velvet Underground's "Venus in Furs."
Despite the laconic naturalism of the performances, Van Sant's script works in religious motifs -- from the opening "baptism" in the river, to a pair of identical twin Mormons (non-pro thesps Adam and Andy Friberg) who explain Christ's resurrection to some of the entourage, to a near final shot where the ghostly, naked soul of Blake rises via superimposition from his dead body and climbs a ladder seemingly to Heaven -- an excessively sentimental detail shown with a metaphoric straight face by Van Sant that nearly ruins the movie.
One might give Van Sant the benefit of the doubt and say the very triteness of the image is intentional, that the film is knowingly playing out what Blake's manager (Kim Gordon, from rock outfit Sonic Youth) calls "a rock 'n' roll cliche" to its bitter end. But a worrying sense develops as the film goes along that Van Sant may see the story as a kind of secular, Gen-X Passion Play, where the genius saint dies for our sins.
The entourage ensemble could be seen as the disciples who fail their rock messiah -- a supposed visionary like his poet namesake William Blake -- preoccupied as they are with endlessly coupling with each other and taking drugs.
None of the supporting players has much acting to do here (Asia Argento literally walks through the pic in a thong). But Lukas Haas and Scott Green incarnate bleary wooziness well, while helmer Harmony Korine has a droll cameo as a fan who rants at Blake about playing Dungeons and Dragons with the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia.
Within the limitations of the role, Pitt acquits himself very well as Blake, giving a nervy, physical performance that expresses character mostly through gait, mumbled dialogue and, most importantly, music with two songs he's credited with having written.
The first is a discordant but rousing punk jam called "That Day," which is heard as Blake is strikingly shown by a slow tracking back camera which gives the scene a brutal subsonic force.
The second song, "Death to Birth," sounds like a weak parody of a Nirvana song even down to its slow-fast structure, but with lyrics more far more banal than anything the composer of "Heart-Shaped Box" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" ever wrote, even at his worst.
Elsewhere, despite the fact that the film is about a rock star, music is used sparingly with selections from 16th century madrigal composer Jancquin and avant-garde composer Hildegard Westerkamp's atonal "Doors of Perception" as non-source backing. Deftly mixed by sound designer Leslie Shatz, the various bleeps and bells of the latter composition merge seamlessly with source noises and snatches of dialogue to create an appropriately hallucinatory soundscape.
Savides' lensing is immaculate throughout, providing its own painterly pleasures even when the story may irk. Editing by helmer himself is evocative if occasionally enigmatic, suggesting work of a highly intuitive filmmaker.

Last Days , the brilliant concluding chapter in the death trilogy that inspired Gus Van Sant 's artistic rebirth, wafts through the final 48 or so hours of a Kurt Cobain like rock star. Nirvana fans, be forewarned: This sensuously entropic elegy is the most elemental and circumscribed of biopics. It sheds no new light on a generation's defining pop-cultural tombstone (biographer Charles R. Cross's pieced-together account of Cobain's uneventful final week is broadly similar) and doesn't come close to illustrating In Utero 's working title, I Hate Myself and I Want to Die . But in place of psychological clarity, Last Days  affords a woozy existential coherence. Cobain for one would have appreciated its contradictions. Not exactly a radio-friendly unit shifter, Last Days  is a biography without a story, a sustained monologue that can barely be heard, an interior portrait that denies access to inner life.
Like Elephant , Van Sant's Columbine  meditation, Last Days  zeroes in on the hallucinatory stillness of a final countdown. It shares with the earlier film a compressed time frame and aspect ratio, as well as a slippery, cosmic, almost four-dimensional sense of space and time, achieved again via remarkable technical means: Harris Savides 's fluid camerawork, Leslie Shatz 's layered sound design, Van Sant's instinctual editing. As in Elephant , the iconographic details of a mythic tragedy are faithfully reproduced, and they float by in a narcotic fog, charged with meaning but untouched by the organizing principles of conventional narrative.
Van Sant's critics find his arty lyricism too coy and convenient (or even morally troubling), but both Elephant , with its ticked-off list of red-herring "motivations," and Last Days , an abstract inquiry strewn with unnervingly literal clues, are willful reconsiderations, subjecting tabloid-processed calamities to a sort of reverse mythopoeia. The films pick apart what we think we know about a high school massacre and a rock 'n' roll suicide to reveal what we can never truly know. Explanations are moot in movies that so palpably shoulder the weight of predestination, and indeed, Last Days  bypasses cause altogether to focus on numb, inevitable effect.
When the film opens, the Cobain figurechristened Blake and impeccably impersonated by Michael Pitt is for all intents already dead. He's first glimpsed stumbling through the woods, a very ape vision of unwashed blond androgyny, inpatient bracelet around his wrist, heading to a roaring waterfall to pee and bathe. The morning after, the pajama-clad wild child, named presumably for the visionary artist-poet and ranting mad genius, retreats to his tumbledown mansion, where a posse of hangers-on is encamped. Avoiding the amorphous entourage (which in turn keeps its distance), he plays dress-up with a wardrobeful of Kurt-iconic outfits, toys with a shotgun, prepares cereal and macaroni and cheese, andin an amazing sequencenods out to Boyz II Men 's "On Bended Knee" video. Van Sant interpolates the whole damn thing, and the worlds-collide dissonance, the swelling tension between the video's madly dissolving montages and Blake's somnambulist biorhythms, practically causes a fold in timean effect the director augments by approaching the moment twice with one of his now customary temporal pretzels.
Later, in a loop that drowsily puns on stuck-groove heroin/vinyl needle use, Van Sant does the same with "Venus in Furs," which includes the phrase "down on your bended knee," not to mention the chemical-slumber mantra: "I am tired/I am weary/I could sleep for a thousand years." Blake's own music surfaces only twicethe slouching-toward-Nirvana dirge "Death to Birth" (a Pitt composition) and an improvised jam captured in slow zoom-outbut sound is a key factor in his mental breakdown. As in Elephant , Shatz's queasy audio mix prominently deploys Hildegard Westerkamp 's musique concréte piece "Doors of Perception," a disorienting echo chamber of chimes, creaks, and birdcalls (named, like Aldous Huxley 's mescaline chronicle and Jim Morrison 's band, after a William Blake  epigram).
Speculative and opaque, Last Days  is a biopic that resolves two opposing dicta. One from the original William Blake: "Do what you will this life's a fiction/And is made up of contradiction." The other from Cobain himself: "What else could I write/I don't have the right." In his hidden fortress, Blake dodges the clamoring outside world, evading phone calls (one from his screeching widow in waiting) and an amusing procession of visitors: a Yellow Pages salesman, two Mormon brothers, a detective played by Ricky Jay , a concerned Kim Gordon .
No one in the film can get near Blake, and neither can you. Forsaking the helpless-angel vantage of Elephant 's Steadicam  stalking, Van Sant and Savides isolate Blake, rock star that he is, in the middle distance, his face perpetually obscured. Radiating an invisible force field, this severely withdrawn cipher is all the more remote for being almost always unintelligible. His running commentary is a mumbled, vaguely obsessive torrent, and what little you can decode has a banal poignancy. One of Blake's most audible lines, murmured as he scribbles in a journal: "I lost something on my way to wherever I am today." (Its blunt resignation belongs on the In Utero  lyric sheet, along with "Now I'm bored and old" and "I do not want what I have got.")
