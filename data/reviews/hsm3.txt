'What if it's, like, really dumb and I can't flip the channel?" worried my 11-year-old daughter's friend as we settled in for "High School Musical 3: Senior Year." Honey, I feel your pain. Like a massive gelatinous beast in a 1950s sci-fi movie, Disney's new franchise has extruded its latest brand extension onto the big screen. Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay and company have colonized the multiplex. Resistance is futile.
Since the brand in question is cheerily indestructible, though, fans of the Disney Channel's original "High School Musical" and its sequel will be relieved to learn that "Senior Year" works exactly as planned. The new movie is brainless, tuneful, wholesome, and calorie-free - Diet Coke in a bigger bottle. On the drive home, the girls even said they liked "HSM3" better than the first two. That may be because they haven't seen it 1,932 times. Yet.
The generically-named East High remains the setting (it's in New Mexico, but vaguely), and the gang is preparing for life after high school. College choices and parental expectations must be met; there's the chance of a Juilliard scholarship for one lucky kid. How does the student body respond? By putting on a show, of course - a singing, dancing version of senior year itself, right down to replicating the prom as an onstage production number. This is awfully meta for "High School Musical" - did Charlie Kaufman doctor the script?
The central romance is unchanged and unruffled. Vanessa Hudgens still twinkles and sings in that yearningly nasal mall-girl voice as Gabriella; Zac Efron still broods and croons as Troy, fulfilling his Faustian bargain to become the Troy Donahue of his generation (or Bobby Sherman or Rick Springfield or whoever's poster was on your sister's bedroom wall back in the day). There's a bit of cafeteria sturm und drang over their diverging life paths and Efron gets his required I-think-I'm-miserable dance number where he tries to look all mad 'n' stuff. Otherwise, snooze.
Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman as Troy and Gabriella's best friends have little to do this time other than keep "HSM3" from seeming unbearably white. Ashley Tisdale's Sharpay - the mean girl/drama queen of the series - has a new nose and the same attitude; since the actress hasn't turned down the volume for the big screen, Sharpay's now an overbearing cartoon. The same goes for the drama teacher played by Alyson Reed; on TV, with her teacup and "British" accent, Ms. Darbus is just one more dippy Disney Channel grown-up. Here she seems actively feebleminded.
Where "HSM3" at least connects with the spirit of classic musicals is in the secondary characters of Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) and Kelsi (Olesya Rulin), respectively the choreographer and songwriter of East High's graduating class. Once upon a time they would have been played by Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, and the movie would have been about them. Both actors are likable, though, and, unlike the leads, they're allowed to have personalities.
The songs? My daughter already has them memorized. I've already forgotten them. They're acceptable factory product. The dance scenes fare better, if only because choreographer Charles Klapow and choreographer-turned-director Kenny Ortega have slightly more room to swing a cast in. The group dance numbers fill the screen with stomping junior-Fosse verve; one in an auto salvage yard is particularly nice. The nod to "Royal Wedding" when Troy dances up the walls and across the ceiling is klutzy but appreciated.
Fred Astaire it ain't, of course; not by a long shot. Still, how hard should we be kicking about a G-rated live-action "Archie" comic that has introduced the pleasures of singing and dancing to a new generation? In the real world, Troy would probably be on steroids and Sharpay would be bulimic; Ryan would be in the closet and Kelsi would be in denial; Gabriella would be sending nude cellphone pictures to her boyfriend that would end up on the Internet. (Oh, wait . . .)
"High School Musical" isn't the real world, though, just as "Top Hat" and "Singin' in the Rain" and "Funny Face" were never the real world. They're refuges; safe harbors of music and movement. For all its unforgivable blandness, "High School Musical" opens young audiences to the charms of this most transporting of movie genres. Many of those kids will go back to watch the real classics. One or two of them may even grow up to make new ones.


High School Musical 3: Senior Year  gives you an honest jolt of feel-good fizz. It may be as friendly and square as one of those 1950s teen romps in which the actors wore letter sweaters, but that doesn't mean the movie is an uptight anachronism. It's shrewd enough to know that in an era ruled by drop-dead irony, gee-whiz sincerity can be its own rebellion  a wholesome rebuke to consumerist cool. The star jocks and theater bugs of East High School in Albuquerque have already been through championship games, opening nights, and  in the case of the googly-eyed princess Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale)  enough costume changes to empty Christina Aguilera's closet. But as they close in on the end of senior year, a question nags: Can they be themselves in a culture that's figured out how to market Individuality?
In 2006, the first High School Musical  was a phenomenon, and it's not hard to see why. Directed by Kenny Ortega, the choreographer of Dirty Dancing , it was a delightful paradox, a squeaky-clean Disney Channel film that used the image of a multiracial yet homogenized all-American high school to make a case for the importance of not  running with the pack. The film's let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm harkened back to the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musicals, but that spirit was merged with an infectious pop-rock swagger and, most refreshingly, a can this be real?  wink at its own kitschy earnestness. (It turned Disney's theme-park conformity on its mouse ear.) High School Musical  was like Beach Blanket Bingo , Grease , Footloose , Rent , Hairspray  (the John Waters and  Broadway versions), and The Brady Bunch  all mixed together; even the overbright studio-backlot look had a distinct charm  it gave Albuquerque the sunbaked expansiveness of exurb America. The whole thing was carried aloft by the teenybop grin, sapphire eyes, and shimmying hips of Zac Efron, who played Troy Bolton, the hoops star who secretly longed to sing and dance, as a fusion of jock and showman, teen idol and Ordinary Dude. You could also say that Troy was both straight and...well, you know, joyous . Because let's face it: Any movie in which a high school's most revered athlete is ambivalent about how much he loves to perform in musicals is saying something  about sex roles and tolerance in 21st-century youth culture.
If you were a fan of High School Musical , where Troy fell for the heart-faced Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and revealed himself to be a ''Gotta dance!'' stage freak, or High School Musical 2  (2007), in which Troy and his buddies learned the perils of the class system by working for the summer at a country club, you may well ask: What's left for Troy and the gang to conquer? High School Musical 3  stands in relation to the first two films as the Sex and the City  movie did to that series: It's longer, more lavish, and a bit less perky. Troy has to decide if he's going to chase a basketball scholarship at the home-state alma mater of his dad (Bart Johnson), or follow his own dream. And how will Gabriella, who lands in the Stanford honors program, figure in? Can their romance survive the end of high school? I haven't even mentioned the senior prom!
These are standard youth-movie dilemmas, but they're brought to life by the high-energy cast and the musical numbers, which Ortega shoots with electrifying pizzazz. When Troy and Gabriella waltz in the rain on the school’s garden rooftop, the movie taps that blend of shyness and exhibitionism that animates so many adolescents. Later, Troy and Chad (Corbin Bleu), his dreadlocked teammate and best bud, do a gymnastic dance in a junkyard, flipping and twirling to ''The Boys Are Back,'' and it's a thriller. Here, once again, the beauty of Efron's performance is that he's a vibrant athletic hoofer who leaps and clowns with the heartthrob vigor of a young Gene Kelly, yet he's also achingly sincere. His fast-break alertness makes him the most empathetic of teen idols; he's like a David Cassidy who knows how to act, and who can swoon without getting too moist about it. Apart from Efron, the breakout star is Ashley Tisdale, whose Sharpay makes narcissism a goofy, bedazzled pleasure. I don't want to overpraise the High School Musical  films: In their happy way, they have a synthetic, connect-the-dots quality. But it's hard to resist the way they take American teen culture back to the future.
High School Musical 3: Senior Year : Zac Efron talks about the movie at his EW photo shoot:

 How lovely the American high school experience might be if it offered even a smidgen of the euphoria that spirals “High School Musical 3: Senior Year,” into a candy-colored never-never land that Peter Pan might envy.  In making the leap from  Disney Channel to the big screen, the third chapter of the phenomenally popular franchise crystallizes a moment in movie-musical history that is probably as evanescent as it is triumphant. If you recall all that hyperbolic talk in the ’80s about music videos spurring a full-scale revival of the movie musical  —  a revival that fizzled after “Footloose” and “Flashdance”  —  here it is (without  frantic MTV-style  editing). Or was. “High School Musical 4” has already been announced. But whether the franchise can continue after the major characters graduate is open to question. Quirky new characters are introduced. But are they stars?  Much of the success of the “High School Musicals” owes to the shrewd mixing and matching of proven formulas, augmented  by the charisma of Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens as  the dewy-eyed puppy lovers Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez. Mr. Efron’s athletic grace is Astaire-like in its casual authority. Ms. Hudgens’s blissful smiles melt the screen.  The taken-for-granted ethnic diversity of the students at East High in Albuquerque,  the franchise’s unlikely setting, comes from “Fame.” So does the craving for show business glory expressed in “I Want It All,” belted by the movie’s resident  not-so-nasty mean girl,  Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale),   a teenager  so ambitious she would steal the scene off your back.  Most of the 10  songs in “High School Musical 3” belong to a boy-band tradition that runs from New Kids on the Block through the Backstreet Boys to the Jonas Brothers. The best of the score’s several songwriters are the team of Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil, whose auto junkyard anthem, “The Boys Are Back,” echoes Thin Lizzy’s 1976 hit “The Boys Are Back in Town” filtered through Michael Jackson’s “Beat It,” and is frenziedly performed by a male chorus executing post-break-dance acrobatics on the hoods of rusted cars. The genre, which might be described as sugarcoated bubblegum hip-hop, may be disposable, but it is extremely catchy and rhythmically elastic.  The all-purpose choreography by  the director Kenny Ortega and his collaborators mixes up Rockettes-like kick lines, angular writhing in the style   of “Cats,” break dancing and accelerated ballroom moves. (Mr. Efron does an impeccably suave waltz.) In one number, Mr. Ortega even quotes his own choreography from Madonna’s “Material Girl” video. My favorite dance number is the triumphal title song, performed on a playing field where the lines of dancers ripple like a human roller coaster.  All very sweet, you say. But what does it all mean?  To which I would reply:  Does it have to mean anything beyond the pleasure of entering a dream of high school harmony?  So what if these wholesome singing-and-dancing characters include no teenagers you or I will ever meet? If you dropped the term “friends with benefits” to any of these absurdly idealized youth who appear to have descended from the same planet that produced “The Brady Bunch,” you may rest assured they wouldn’t know what you were talking about. The only things on their minds besides basketball and musical comedy are choosing a prom date and a college to attend. There are wistful moments, but no sulky ones. The one lingering kiss is delicate.  The movie’s cleverest notion is its portrayal of sports and musical comedy as interchangeable. In the sensational opening number, “Now or Never,” East High’s Wildcats trounce their rivals to hip-hop beats and semi-rapped chants shouted by the cheerleaders and players alike.  Whether to choose sports or musical comedy,  that is the burning question facing Troy, who has been planning to accompany his best friend,   Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu),  to “U. of A.,” as it is  called, and play basketball. But when the school’s fluty-voiced drama teacher, Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed), announces to Troy’s shock that he is one of four students being considered for a scholarship to Juilliard, he is  thrown into a quandary. As he ponders his future, the movie slips in an argument for musical theater as a more-than-O.K. activity for all-American guys; after all, it is another sport.  The other small conflicts in Peter Barsocchini’s story (the weakest of his three “High School Musical” plots) are hardly worth mentioning. But in a movie determined to keep reality at a safe distance, would you want it any other way? As its wholesome perpetual-motion machines leap, tumble and whipsaw  through the halls and playgrounds of East High, you want to leave the world behind and be one of them now and forever.

Most likely to succeed in East High School's class of 2008 is Zac Efron. Director Kenny Ortega clearly knows it, moving the 21-year-old heartthrob center stage in "High School Musical 3: Senior Year," the infectiously upbeat bigscreen extension of Disney Channel's runaway TV movie sensation. By this point in the franchise, Efron seems to have outgrown his on-again/off-again love interest, leaving screenwriter Peter Barsocchini hard-pressed to cook up a fresh conflict -- not that tween fans need one. Pic's bouncy playlist and bigger musical numbers will see theaters packed with the faithful, while conveniently introducing a freshman cast to carry the torch in the process.
Given the built-in fan base for "High School Musical" -- a phenomenon so popular, it's been performed by hundreds of junior drama departments around the country -- the Disney team didn't have to do much to ensure a massive turnout. And yet Ortega, who tackled "Newsies" for the studio back in the day, seems determined to get it right, making excellent use of the wider canvas to stage his most impressive setpieces yet. Sharpay's "I Want It All," in particular, unfurls as an extravagant homage to Broadway -- a far cry from the first film, in which the tunes were buried as karaoke duets or theater rehearsals for fear that musical-averse auds wouldn't go for break-out-in-song moments. Starting small, Ortega has taught an entirely new generation to love musical theater.
However, while Ortega and fellow choreographers Charles Klapow and Bonnie Story stretch their imaginations, there's something almost lazy about the pic's underachiever script. If the first film was like "West Side Story" (school basketball star falls for brainy transfer student) and the second was like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (the boy must now decide between the rich girl who offers him everything and the common one who captured his heart), "Senior Year" lacks a fresh central dilemma.
Pic begins with the Wildcats winning their second basketball championship. Gabriella (Hudgens) is headed for Stanford, while Troy (Efron) has a basketball scholarship to the local university, where his best friend, Chad (Corbin Bleu), and his father (Bart Johnson) expect him to go. So with graduation on the horizon, things are bittersweet between the couple, with Gabriella pulling away to avoid further heartbreak. 
To complicate matters, drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) has invited recruiters from Juilliard to observe the senior year musical and award one student a scholarship. Troy's in the running but seems largely undecided about his future, which is one reason the movie's "I want" song, traditionally reserved for the protagonist in musicals, goes to attention hog Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) instead. Wowing Juilliard figures prominently in her own plans, even if it means trampling twin brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel, still the most talented of the bunch) and her new transfer-student groupie, Tiara (Jemma McKenzie-Brown), in the process.
Of course, the most pressing anxiety for "High School Musical 3" fans concerns where the cast goes from here. While two new basketball players emerge in Efron's shadow (played by goofy-to-the-point-of-annoying Matt Prokop and pint-sized sidekick Justin Martin), neither seems particularly well-suited to fill his shoes. By contrast, there's plenty of gold in the Sharpay-Tiara dynamic, which yields a hilarious fight for the spotlight.
As in the earlier films, Ortega employs a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from teen-angst rock anthem "Scream" to the boy-band-styled "The Boys Are Back," adapting the styles to the participating characters' states of mind at that moment. Latter number yields the pic's most original choreography, as Troy and Chad reconnect with their inner children in a salvage yard full of great dance props, a reminder of the team's gift for organically creating playful dance moves from nearly any situation.
By releasing the songs in advance, Disney may have found an answer to their mostly forgettable quality: After listening to them enough on their MP3 players, young auds may think of them as standards. But it's the staging, not the music (which has a disembodied studio sound and never quite synchs with the characters), that makes "High School Musical 3" worthy of the bigscreen -- though the Efron factor doesn't hurt.
