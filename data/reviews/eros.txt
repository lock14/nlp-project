         An anthology on the subject of desire, "Eros" puts three directors to work on discrete films produced by Stéphane Tchal Gadjieff, who also produced Michelangelo Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds." Antonioni provides the final film in the troika — a small mercy, really. The other two, directed by filmmakers who have appeared "on record," according to press notes, as having been influenced by the once-great Italian director, are also arranged in order of descending success.
 
  The only real reason to catch "Eros" is to see Wong Kar-Wai's beautiful opening piece, "The Hand," the story of the intersecting fortunes of a young tailor and a stunning courtesan. "The Hand" is set, like Wong's exquisite "In the Mood for Love," in the Hong Kong of the 1960s and seems to capture a moment when ancient traditions found themselves suddenly steeped in modernism.
 


         






    Zhang (Chang Chen) is a tailor's apprentice who is sent, on one of his first errands, to the stylish apartment of a famous beauty, Miss Hua (Gong Li). Zhang waits in her dining room as Miss Hua concludes an afternoon tryst in an adjoining room. What he hears through the walls obliges him to hold a package to his groin on entering her room; what transpires is a moment he'll never forget — let's just say it's meant to inspire him to always make her beautiful clothes.
 
  As Zhang becomes an accomplished tailor, Miss Hua's fortunes decline — until she is reduced to walking the streets and living in a shabby hotel. Zhang tracks her down and maintains the illusion of her glamour and invincibility to his elderly boss.
 
  Wong is a melancholy artist, a master of longing with an exquisite eye. Zhang's enduring devotion to Miss Hua and his helplessness before her tragedy resonate on every shimmering surface and every glittering garment. Even the wallpaper makes you want to cry.
 
  Steven Soderbergh's "Equilibrium" is a charming, if slight, protracted gag charmingly performed by Alan Arkin and Robert Downey Jr. What it has to do with desire I have no idea — that is, unless Soderbergh is trying to say something about the overlap between success and sex in the American mind. Downey plays Nick Penrose, a 1950s adman with the unenviable job of finding something fresh to say about alarm clocks. He's also been having a recurring dream in which a naked woman bathes in front of him, gets dressed and leaves.
 
  The opening scene, subsequently revealed as Nick's dream, is shot in a style reminiscent of Wong — everything in the room is a limpid blue. But the bulk of the movie transpires in the office of Dr. Pearl (Arkin), in blown-out black and white. Dr. Pearl spends most of the therapeutic hour searching for binoculars and peering out the window, while Nick enjoys a breakthrough on the couch: He invents the snooze alarm. A classic reversal follows, but by that point, I was already plenty turned around.
 
  In the final installment, Antonioni's "The Dangerous Thread of Things," a man (Christopher Buchholz) and a woman (Regina Nemni) spend an afternoon in the countryside squabbling about nothing. They go for a hike (the woman, braless under a transparent blouse, hikes in heels) and come upon a lake of naked sylphs bathing and singing in a waterfall. At a seaside restaurant, where the woman cryptically drops her wineglass on the floor, the man glimpses a young girl (Luisa Ranieri) and follows her home. Sometime later, the women meet on the beach, where they dance naked.
 
  Antonioni is the author of several masterpieces, including the sublime "L'Avventura" and "La Notte." His major contributions to cinema don't need the grief of sharing space on a filmography with this.

The subject of Eros  isn't so much eros as what the same word means to three distinctive filmmakers: Wong Kar Wai, Steven Soderbergh, and Michelangelo Antonioni. Well, not so much what the word means personally, either, but what the third filmmaker means to the other two, given that Antonioni's groundbreaking, influential work, including L'Avventura  and Blow-Up , defined the modern European cinema of alienated eros in the 1960s and '70s. Judging from The Dangerous Thread of Things , the honoree's own wispy contribution to the trilogy, the ailing 93-year-old still has emptiness, carnal ennui, and the indecipherable pouts of untamable women on his mind. He also retains a taste for the trappings of an affluent, sullen loneliness  towers, beaches, long stretches of empty road. Very '70s  and yet very Sundance, this period piece.
What Antonionian eros means to Wong and Soderbergh, meanwhile, remains a muddle, as anthology movie projects so often do: For the invited filmmaker, the opportunity to make a statement is surely a thrill, but for the viewer  who can't pause indefinitely, as with a book, between stories  the focus-shifting is a demand. (Caetano Veloso coos brief musical interludes between films.) In The Hand , Wong whips up a ripe fable of lifelong obsession predicated on one moment of bliss manually bestowed years ago by an alluring courtesan (the ever-creamy Gong Li) on a dazed tailor's apprentice (Crouching Tiger 's Chang Chen). The literally sweaty settings (a steam-clouded tailor's shop, a sex-damp hotel room, rainy streets of desire familiar from In the Mood for Love ) and voluptuous sadness are pure Wong, but the intention  a hand job as homage!  is sweetly nuts.
As for Soderbergh, the inveterate game-player strives for puckishness by choosing a jokey, peekaboo approach to the subject: Equilibrium  is set in the repressed 1950s, where Robert Downey Jr. plays a New York adman tormented by a recurring dream, who takes his unreliable subconscious to a psychiatrist played by Alan Arkin. Even the setup and casting are built to jest: This is homage by way of after-dinner skit.

ros" is a trilogy - given the subject, perhaps it would be better to say a m�nage � trois - of short films dealing, sometimes obliquely, sometimes more directly, with sex. For the three filmmakers involved, Wong Kar-Wai, Steven Soderbergh and Michelangelo Antonioni, this is hardly a new area of concern. Mr. Wong, most recently with "In the Mood for Love" and the forthcoming "2046," confects lavish, gorgeous tableaus of yearning. He has become one of contemporary cinema's great sensualists. Mr. Soderbergh, director of one of the best-known movies with the word sex in the title ("sex, lies and videotape"), has a more detached, analytical sensibility, but like Mr. Wong he often approaches the act of filmmaking itself with palpable ardor. And then there is Mr. Antonioni, now in his 90's, who reinvented the language of film eroticism while his two collaborators were still in diapers. The producers of "Eros" conceived the project in part as an homage to Mr. Antonioni, whose name is also the title of the film's languorous theme song, performed in Italian by the Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso. The song, accompanying interstitial drawings (by Lorenzo Mattotti) that depict lovers in various postures of bliss, meditates on the paradoxical nature of love, which is described as a "useless window." Those words suit "Eros" as well; lovely though it is to look at, it does not reveal very much. Sampling the works of three prominent directors in one sitting may be what gives anthology films like this one their appeal, but the experience is often more frustrating than fulfilling. (I leave it to you to supply the appropriate sexual metaphor). The only selection in "Eros" that works on its own terms is the first one, "The Hand" (directed by Mr. Wong), in part because it seems perfectly continuous with his other work. Like "In the Mood for Love" and "2046," "The Hand" takes place in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, a milieu of heavy rain, long corridors and beautiful silk sheath dresses. As if to embrace his reputation as a couture fetishist, Mr. Wong has turned clothing into an explicit sexual metaphor. His hero (Chang Chen) is an apprentice tailor whose main client is an imperious call girl played by Gong Li. At their first meeting, after noting that a man in his profession without sexual experience can hardly be expected to understand how to dress a woman, she initiates him, in a scene that is erotically charged without being terribly explicit. Working with his longtime cinematographer Christopher Doyle, Mr. Wong uses color and composition to collapse the distance between the senses. Often, you don't quite know what you are seeing, but you swear you can feel the texture and temperature of the bodies on screen. "Equilibrium," Mr. Soderbergh's contribution, is decidedly cooler, though it shares cinematic luxuriance with "The Hand." Working with his favorite cinematographer - himself, under the pseudonym Peter Andrews - Mr. Soderbergh moves from undulating blue to rich, silvery black-and-white. The loveliness of the filmmaking, though, is almost too much for the story, an arch, hermetic joke about a 1950's advertising executive (Robert Downey Jr.) on a visit to his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin). The actors are fun to watch and listen to, though their anxious, distracted communication could not be more distant from the wordless longing between Mr. Chang and Ms. Gong. What "The Hand" and "Equilibrium" do have in common is not desire but a fascination with how film can manipulate the experience of time. Mr. Wong's film, sliding over what does not concern the connection between his two main characters, condenses years into moments; Mr. Soderbergh, watching the clock, folds different layers of reality into a single short span. More than anything else, it may be this concern with time that links Mr. Wong and Mr. Soderbergh with their master, Mr. Antonioni, who arguably did more to change the way moviegoers experience temporality than any other single director. His great trilogy of the 1960's - "L'Avventura," "La Notte" and "L'Eclisse" - are famously slow and elusive, their stories untethered from the conventions of beginning, middle and end. "The Dangerous Thread of Things," his portion of "Eros," evokes those films in a way that verges on parody. A bored couple (Christopher Buchholz and Regina Nemni), living in a stone tower near a lake in Tuscany, wander through the landscape, bickering in post-synchronized Italian to the occasional accompaniment of tinny pop songs. They drive to a restaurant in their blue Maserati, and catch sight of a beautiful neighbor on horseback (Luisa Ranieri). The man goes to visit her in her stone tower, and they exchange portentous remarks ("I hope you can handle my chaos." "What kind of chaos?" "Total chaos.") While she engages in some solitary foreplay on her bed, he stands on the roof, admiring her weathervane. Then they make love, and afterward the two women, both naked, encounter each other on the beach. The effect is somewhere between a Mad magazine satire and a Maxim photo spread, but "The Dangerous Thread of Things" at least shows that Mr. Antonioni still has a lively eye, which he is content to train on picturesque landscapes and beautiful actresses. And why complain? As an old master, perhaps he has earned the right to be something of a dirty old man. "Eros" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and sexual themes.

What might have been a cinephile's wet dream turns out instead to be seductive, stimulating and sodden, in that order, in the three-chapter reflection on love and desire, "Eros." Wong Kar-wai conjures a melancholy reverie that intoxicates despite its air of deja vu
, while Steven Soderbergh cooks up witty wordplay and a masterclass in offbeat comic acting. But Michelangelo Antonioni, around whom the project was assembled, indulges in desultory Eurotrash horndoggery that feebly mimics his elliptical 1960s dramas. The venture's extreme unevenness will make it commercially viable mainly as a DVD curio.
Paris-based producer Stephane Tchal Gadjieff fostered the project after working with Antonioni in 1995 on "Beyond the Clouds," made 10 years after the 92-year-old director was partially paralyzed by a stroke that deprived him of the power of speech. Antonioni's segment was filmed in Tuscany in 2001.
Soderbergh -- who stepped in when Pedro Almodovar dropped out of the project -- and Wong shot their segments almost two years later. Warner Independent has U.S. rights through its affiliation with Soderbergh.
Very much in the vein of "In the Mood for Love" but partly inspired by the SARS epidemic, Wong's "The Hand" chronicles an aching, unrequited love fueled by the erotic power of touch. Sexually inexperienced young tailor's apprentice Zhang (Chang Chen) is sent to the home of beautiful courtesan Hua (Gong Li) for a fitting. When Zhang's attempts to hide his arousal fail, Hua takes the matter in hand, telling him to remember her womanly touch when he's making her clothes.
Shot with fetishistic sensual closeness by Wong's regular collaborator Christopher Doyle and kitted out in gorgeous 1960s period decor and silky threads, the impeccably designed, exquisitely acted film parallels Zhang's growing skill as a dressmaker with Hua's steady downfall from high-class courtesan to streetwalker.
From the first strains of the teasing Afro-Cuban jazz that colors its soundtrack, Soderbergh's "Equilibrium" is a more playful affair. Set in 1955 New York, it unfolds mainly during a session between agitated advertising exec Nick Penrose (Robert Downey Jr.) and his amusingly distracted therapist Dr. Pearl (Alan Arkin).
The story begins with Nick's recurring dream of a cool beauty (Ele Keats) slinking away naked from his bedroom to bathe and dress. But the writer-director is less concerned with erotic imaginings than with the rattled mental state they induce, manifested in Nick's marital anxieties, his fixation with an office colleague's toupee and the invention of the snooze alarm.
Peter Andrews' noirish B&W lensing of the therapy session gives this buoyant neurotica sketch a visual kick. But the chief attraction is the sustained ricochet of wry comedy between Downey and Arkin.
Scripted from three of his short stories by the director with veteran collaborator Tonino Guerra, Antonioni's "The Dangerous Thread of Things" has no thread to speak of beyond its antiquated echoes of the existentialist maestro's classic ruminations on the communication impasse between men and women.
Contrived enigma follows bored couple Christopher (Christopher Buchholz) and Chloe (Regina Nemni), who speak exclusively in non sequiturs rendered even more risible by their stilted English dialogue. Their marital malaise prompts Christopher to follow curvy horsewoman Linda (Luisa Ranieri) home for some afternoon delight. Later, while Christopher is in voluntary exile in Paris, Linda and Chloe dance naked on opposite ends of a beach.
There may be some restraint shown in Antonioni's decision to stop short of the hinted lesbo-action in the two women's encounter but that's where the subtlety begins and ends. Despite a certain visual elegance, this pervy posturing unintentionally but cruelly parodies the vintage work and violates the dignity of a once-significant filmmaker. It even makes the worst of the "Erotic Tales" series from several years back look suddenly less embarrassing.
The ponderousness of Antonioni's interlude carries through to the linking sequences of erotic drawings by illustrator Lorenzo Mattotti. These are accompanied by an original Caetano Veloso song inspired by the Italian director, which sounds like it was composed under heavy medication.

Among the assortment of extratextual things going on deep in the muddle of Eros , there's the indulgence of the omnibus film, an idiot quasi-genre that was momentarily hot potatoes in the New Wavey-ness of the 1960s, as everybody from Godard to Pasolini to Marcel Ophüls  was happily commissioned to make crazy shorts that were then packaged together into congenitally ramshackle features. Eros  is unsurprisingly anomalous, given its ostensible thematic glue: the worshipful regard of all participants for co-director Michelangelo Antonioni , who is 20 years into his post-stroke period and who, it must be said, should consider resting on his laurels and, perhaps, supervising the transfers and supplements on his old movies' DVDs.
The omnibus film usually saves its home run for the climax, but Eros  begins with the best third. Wong Kar-wai 's The Hand  is set in the 1960s, during the last flush of courtesan culture. A young, virginal tailor's apprentice (Chang Chen ) sees a notorious Hong Kong femme (Gong Li ) for measurements, waiting for her to audibly wind up a session with a client first. Nervous and callow, he receives only taunting at first; eventually, she unzips him and gives him what might be cinema's most romantic (offscreen) hand job. After that, our hero sweats over customized clothes only for her, and years pass, until the once glamorous, now consumptive whore takes to dock hooking, and the mature tailor, ever faithful, still struggles toward an impossible intimacy. Wong can do romantic shorthand like no one else, and The Hand  is as fondue rich in iconic visions as any Dietrich-von Sternberg movie, regularly withholding focus, lighting the low-rent spaces (shot mostly in Hong Kong) as if they're under an amber bell jar, and getting the hallways, wallpaper, and furniture to plant and sprout in the memory like objects from your own past. One shot of Gong in a mirror, recuperating and primping after a screaming match with one of the courtesan's disenchanted sugar daddies, is the quintessence of movie love found and transmitted.
Steven Soderbergh 's Equilibrium  is relatively slight and banal, but a moment-by-moment joy as Robert Downey Jr. , playing a hyperactive 1950s ad exec haunted by dreams, bounces off of Alan Arkin  as his distracted shrink. The atomic-clock comic timing on display is redoubtable, but what, exactly, it has to do with eros, or what either entry or filmmaker owes to Antonioni, is far from clear. The last third, The Dangerous Thread of Things,  is classic rehab Antonioni, a hilariously inept and puerile "analysis" of romantic disenchantment, with three unconvincing caricaturesone dull man, two completely naked womenwandering around a coastal paradise and barking badly dubbed inanities like "How can you fill the air with those empty words?!" The master apparently has no one to tell him when the shit stinks. (The interminable sexy-pastel-sketch interludes between stories are scored to a moony Caetano Veloso  ballad actually titled "Michelangelo Antonioni.") All told, Antonioni fans should steer clear, lest their idolatry become disquieted; Wong acolytes, on the other hand, could use a fix before 2046  finally comes to town.
