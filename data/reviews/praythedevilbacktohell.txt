In 1997, the former warlord Charles Taylor became president of Liberia, unleashing one of those ''civil wars'' that's really a euphemism for chaos, mass murder, an end of civilization. More than 250,000 were killed, but the cycle of slaughter was faced down by a cadre of women who launched a Gandhi-esque crusade  and lo, it worked. Gini Reticker's simply made, affecting documentary Pray the Devil Back to Hell  reveals how these heroic ordinary women prodded the factions to peace and literally brought down Taylor, a leader of sociopathic cruelty.


 Uplifting, disheartening, inspiring, enraging — the mind reels while watching the documentary “Pray the Devil Back to Hell,” even as the eyes water, the temples pound and the body trembles. Directed by Gini Reticker and produced by Abigail E. Disney, this no-frills, no-nonsense inquiry into human beings at their absolute worst and heartening best charts the overlooked  victory of the Liberian women’s peace movement. Even those who think they know the story of modern Liberia may be surprised at what they discover.  Largely pieced together from archival images — including some scenes of deeply disturbing violence — news reports and talking-head interviews, the movie takes off in 2003, when a group of Liberian women pushed their peacemaking tactics into a far more aggressive, confrontational register. Founded by freed American slaves in 1847, the country had spiraled into unfathomable chaos after years of civil war. The former warlord turned president, Charles Taylor, was fending off competing rebel leaders who, using child soldiers armed with Kalashnikovs and zonked out on drugs, were steadily bleeding Liberia to death. Putting aside their religious differences, Christian and Muslim women decided to fight the murderers with peace.  Dressed in white, the women gathered in a field in the nation’s capital, Monrovia, and prayed and sang, dancing under the hot sun and in the hard rain and demanding a meeting with the president. Though some of their strategies, in specific a threat to withhold sex, at times recall Aristophanes’ comic play “Lysistrata,” their story is steeped in blood and tears. If anything, the movie only skims the surface of the Liberian tragedy, which comes most unbearably into focus here with a story about a woman who was forced to watch as her husband’s throat was cut. At 72 minutes, the movie can only gesture at the horror and its historical antecedents, offering up a quick sketch of moments and portraits that demand greater detail.  I wish, for instance, that the filmmakers had spent more time with Asatu Bah Kenneth, a vision of the modern African woman that defies easy categorization. A police officer whose ample bosom gives her the aspect of a well-fortified citadel, Ms. Kenneth is a Muslim who wears pants to work and a head scarf to the mosque. She’s a terrifically appealing interview subject, but, like the other teary and defiant testifiers, remains frustratingly obscure. The filmmakers seem to take it as a matter of faith that building a peace movement on a gender divide can work because men make war, and women make peace. It’s a reassuring idea, perhaps, though the image of Ms. Kenneth in her police uniform suggests that the world is more complicated.

A perfect companion piece to the recent "Iron Ladies of Liberia," which concerned the election of Africa's first femme president, "Pray the Devil Back to Hell" sets forth -- in clear, concise, matter-of-fact words and images -- the incredible happenings that led to that historic event. Compelling docu chronicles the actions of the coalition of Christian and Muslim women who prevailed over warlords and warriors to halt the decades-long fighting that claimed their fathers, brothers, husbands and children. Gini Reticker's lucidly impassioned film, filled with strong, eloquent spokeswomen, garnered Tribeca's docu award, bolstering its arthouse and ancillary prospects. 
 Accessing archival footage, American newspaper coverage and, increasingly, the direct testimony of women, Reticker limns Liberia's first civil war and the rise of dictator Charles Taylor, proceeding to document the country's second civil war in which an army led by opposing warlords devastated the countryside to wrest power from Taylor. The conflict killed a quarter of a million people and displaced another million.
Leymah Gbowee, as she recounts it, "had a dream" to gather the women of the church together to pray for peace, a tactic that, as Reticker shows, soon escalated into an activist Christian women's organization, which in turn spawned a parallel Muslim movement. The impressive sight of the two supposedly antithetical white-clad groups, protesting the war in a thousands-strong sit-in that lasted for days, visually undercut the sectarian nature of the hostilities, which pitted a Christian president against largely Muslim rebel forces.
The attempts of the international community to end the violence went unanswered until the women, employing ancient "Lysistrata" techniques (reported but unseen) in addition to more contempo non-violent means, successfully bullied both sides into attending ceasefire negotiations in Ghana. When those talks stalled, the women formed barricades around the building and refused to let the men exit until an accord was reached. More effectively still, wives and mothers in the hallways threatened to break a sacred taboo and strip naked in front of the men.
The femme activists, who now had formed friendships and ties that transcended religion and custom, next tirelessly campaigned for Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and eventually came to celebrate her victory.
Reticker, whose docus have all concerned women, presents the females' calm visages and voices of reason in direct contrast to the unctuous public doublespeak of Taylor and the self-serving soundbites of the marauding warlords. Reticker's film, enriching the already vast cinematic gallery of extraordinary African women, takes their innate power one step further, showing them quietly, determinedly putting a stop to the seemingly endless civil wars that are ravaging the continent and the globe.
Tech credits are fine, Kirsten Johnson's able camerawork plussed by Kate Taverna's finely tuned cutting.


Some political documentaries suffer from overselling the urgency of their agenda, but director Gini Reticker 's Pray the Devil Back to Hell  nicely underplays the significance of its subject—the 2003 nonviolent protest by thousands of Liberian women that brought down warlord president Charles Taylor . Focusing on interviews with several of the movement's leaders, Reticker mixes in archival footage while explaining how these women, of both Christian and Muslim backgrounds, rallied to demand the end of the bloody civil war waged between Taylor's regime (with its child armies) and the country's rebel factions. On camera, the organizers are largely unremarkable, and Reticker smartly refrains from turning Devil  into a canonization or (worse) a simplistic you-go-girl celebration of calm feminine strength trumping brutal masculine aggression. Instead, the film's slightly dry detailing of the major incidents that led to Taylor's eventual exile complements the protestors' impassioned but unshowy resolve to build momentum for their shows of defiance. Reticker offers perhaps a too-narrow focus on this historical moment, but Pray the Devil  remembers the golden rule of moviemaking—rather than tell, it shows, and what it shows is quietly affecting.
