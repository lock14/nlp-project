In "Street Kings," a hard-boiled Keanu Reeves spends a few intense days trying to find the men who framed him for his ex-police partner's murder. In every sense, the movie is like a Rockstar Games title: The Los Angeles it has reconstructed is endless and complex, but the action is mindless - shoot, kill, win. Reeves, meanwhile, has the kind of semi-alive, pixilated face that turns up in Grand Theft Auto or Midnight Club.
Reeves is playing Tom Ludlow, a widowed vice cop. His murdered ex-partner (Terry Crews) snitched to Internal Affairs about some of Tom's past misdeeds. Tom is furious. When some cholos shoot the partner dead, Tom's culpability seems plausible to department higher-ups, including an annoying police captain (Hugh Laurie) and Tom's power-hungry boss (Forest Whitaker), who puts him in a uniform and gives him a desk job fielding complaints until the case blows over. But Tom's hot to catch the killers, and the movie works too hard to build a narrative excuse for all the shootouts and dead Asians and rap stars on the floor when they're over. Not to mention all the actors - Chris Evans, Laurie, Cedric the Entertainer, Naomie Harris, Jay Mohr, Common - who go underused. That's OK since by the end of the film, Whitaker has done enough acting for all of them.
"Street Kings" is nonsense, and yet the crooked, racialized world underneath the soulless mayhem is pretty fascinating. Ten minutes in, before Reeves's character busts two Korean-Americans looking to buy guns, he zings them with slurs - and not as part of some undercover shtick, either. The racism is a weapon. Tom wouldn't say he's a racist. Some of his best friends are black. His nurse-girlfriend is Hispanic. But in this movie race is all anybody sees when they look at anybody else.
Like a lot of movies about the LAPD, this one is a grim and vulgar hall of mirrors. Having seen "Training Day," with a gonzo Denzel Washington, and "Harsh Times," with a gonzo Christian Bale, I'm familiar with what the director and co-writer David Ayer thinks about Los Angeles law enforcement. A cop is the boogeyman - a menace to society, a menace to himself.
In Ayer's movies, the police aren't purely bad, because there is no bad, by virtue of there being no appreciable good. Maybe this seems extra-rich in "Street Kings" thanks to whatever contributions James Ellroy made to the movie's script: Corruption is the way of this world. But Ayer doesn't use his cynicism to build a consistent, complete movie. He's not an explorative director. He's a guy.
This is a movie that likes its cliches, cheap melodrama, and guns. Ayer appears to like the thrill of violence more than its philosophical underpinnings, so the movie is caught between the silly and the profound. When Tom asks, "What happened to putting the bad guys in jail," your heart goes out to him. He's still thinking like a cop, not like an avatar in a video game.


It's probably safe to say that no fiction writer ever created bad cops as bad as James Ellroy's. In Street Kings , a squalid and bloodthirsty policier  based on an original story by the author of L.A. Confidential , Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves  ), a veteran LAPD vice cop, trash-talks racist garbage to a gang of  Korean hoods, then storms their lair and shoots them dead with a fury that would leave Dirty Harry scrambling for his tattered copy of the Miranda rights. In the process, Ludlow rescues two girls that the gang had been hawking to pedophiles  and so, on the film's terms, he's a hero. But with heroes like this, who needs scumbags?
Every so often, Keanu Reeves' robo-voiced blankness serves him well, but when he has to play a pulpy, tormented demon-saint, scraping up insults and spitting them out like bullets, he's like the host of an infomercial doing an impersonation of a badass. Director David Ayer, who is best known as the screenwriter of Training Day , had a brazen (if little-seen) directorial debut with Harsh Times  (2006), in which Christian Bale gave a high-flying, almost evil performance as a psycho desperate to be a cop. In the new film, Ayer tries for that same volcanic flow, but Street Kings  is more like L.A. Confidential  reduced to a board game. The structure is in place  the latticework of corruption  only there are so many scurrilous men pulling strings that we might be watching a parade of nasty puppets, with Keanu as the chief wooden devil doll.

 James Ellroy, the self-described “demon dog” of American crime fiction, writes in a baroque, pulp prose style that hurtles along the page like a speed freak in a rocket, an image that I probably lifted from one of his books. In his fiction and nonfiction he rushes  forward fast, fast, fast, pausing regularly to do a little scat singing (“a hypodermic full of hyper-hazy, health-hazarding” stuff, from a 1998 short story called “Hush-Hush”), or to blow a hole through the page. He’s a demon dog, all right, with a bite as sharp as his bark.  Other than  Curtis Hanson’s 1997 elegant page-to-screen translation of Mr. Ellroy’s novel “L.A. Confidential,” the movies have generally failed to capture the true tone and texture of his dark places. Certainly that’s the case with David Ayer’s absurd if accidentally entertaining potboiler, “Street Kings,”  based on a story by Mr. Ellroy, who also shares screenwriting credit with Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss. The premise — the existence of an ultraviolent gang of cops operating inside the Los Angeles Police Department and wholly outside the law — has a vintage Ellroy tang, though it also pointedly summons up a host of that city’s  authentic police corruption scandals, from the 1930s through the 1990s.  Keanu Reeves plays Detective Tom Ludlow, a prime cut of  beef who’s part of a cultish, multicultural wrecking crew run by the silkily smooth Capt. Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker). A loner by violent disposition and tragic (dead wife) history, Tom bursts into the film, breaking any number of laws, and immediately enters a hell on earth (that would be Los Angeles) with bullets, blood, shattered bone and underage sex slaves. Good times! More seriously, and this is nothing  if not a deeply serious movie (I think), there are nothing  but bad times ahead, with even more blood — smeared, splattered, splashed and sprayed — mixed in with  vivid night photography, thumping tunes, boyz in the hood, ornamental women, casual racist insults and a lot of manly shouting.  Mr.  Ayer, who wrote “Training Day” and directed  “Harsh Times,” invests his work with palpable energy — his films feel urgent and at times, interestingly, close to desperate — but he has  next to no idea how to control or channel all that manic intensity. Much as he does in “Harsh Times,” he starts this new film in overdrive and keeps it there all the way to the exhausted, exhausting end, piling violent moment upon violent moment. And much like “Training Day” (in which Denzel Washington plays a swaggeringly corrupt cop) and “Harsh Times” (Christian Bale doing the wigged-out war veteran thing), this film pivots on a man who, having been schooled in violence and rewarded for lessons too well learned, has become captive to his own brutality.  Trained as a pit bull, stripped of fear and almost without any pity (especially for himself), Tom has no sense that he’s fighting for someone else’s gain. Mr. Reeves, his face and body somewhat thickened, perhaps by age or the role or both, looks like a middleweight boxer who’s reached the end of a very hard and long road. (Robert Ryan  had a lock on this type in  the 1940s and ’50s.)  Mr.  Reeves’s  natural sobriety works well for the part, as does his ability to play it stiff and straight and  a touch stupid. Tom’s slow-dawning awareness of the world he inhabits and his awful place in it is terribly obvious, as is his  metamorphosis, but neither is it devoid of pathos.  It’s easy to laugh at “Street Kings” for its bigger than big emotions, its preposterously kinky narrative turns and overwrought jawing and yowling, but there’s no doubt that it also keeps you watching, really watching, all the way to the end. The film can be unintentionally, often grotesquely, funny, nowhere more so than during the grandiose finale when Mr. Whitaker — never what you might call a quiet actor to begin with — cuts crazy loose and starts popping his eyes and sputtering the spit. What Mr. Ayer doesn’t appear to have realized — a mistake shared by Brian De Palma in his unfortunate adaptation of Mr. Ellroy’s crime novel “The Black Dahlia” — is that you don’t need to gild a 24-karat lily. It’s plenty shiny already.  “Street Kings” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Blood and bullets.

Somewhere in Los Angeles, police officers are helping old ladies across the street, but such acts of chivalry have no place in "Street Kings," a brutal look at police corruption that allows director David Ayer and "L.A. Confidential" author James Ellroy to pool their deeply cynical insights. Keanu Reeves leads a pack of modern-day cowboys who shoot first and plant evidence later, a system that serves the squad well until an ex-partner snitches to Internal Affairs. The gritty pic more than earns its R rating but should open strong regardless and stick around as action-starved auds take in the carnage.
Screenplay credit goes to Ellroy, Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss, but Ayer's fingerprints are there, too. "Street Kings" cements the "Training Day" scribe's standing as Hollywood's go-to LAPD guy, reinforcing the writer-director's thesis that the thin blue line deals in shades of gray.
Such notions about the widespread abuse of power (in response to the Rodney King incident but given new resonance today) register as far more troubling than anything seen in the Nixon-era "Dirty Harry," where it took a single rule-breaker to maintain law and order, and yet Ayer judges Reeves' Tom Ludlow as a necessary evil. "Who else is gonna hold back the animals?" the movie asks.
Ludlow operates by any means necessary, confident that his longtime commanding officer Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) will cover for him. Dead suspects don't talk, but they go a long way toward advancing the careers of everyone involved, as evidenced by the promotions that follow Ludlow's cavalier raid on an Asian sex den in the pic's opening setpiece.
Like the checkered antiheroes of "Training Day" and "Harsh Times" (Ayer's self-financed directorial debut), Ludlow belongs to a class of broken 
lawmen who drink or dope on the job. Reeves telegraphs Ludlow's troubled condition by downing single-swig vodka bottles while speeding between crime scenes, but the booze has no visible impact on his behavior; nor does the suggestion that he's coping with his wife's death. All in all, Ludlow is grappling with some pretty serious demons, but Reeves has never been one for nuance, wrestling to convey the mix of renegade and boy scout required.
Like a nagging conscience, Ludlow's former partner Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) shows up on the scene to question his methods. Soon after, Ludlow learns the turncoat is selling out his squad to IA and, in an implausible scene on which the entire pic hinges, confronts him in a convenience store just as a couple gangbangers burst in with guns blazing.
Wander and his buddies are quick to clear Ludlow's name -- the first sign that there's something far more sinister at work among L.A.'s finest. A temporary demotion lands Ludlow on the complaints desk, where Ayer unleashes a comic montage of ghetto stereotypes as hookers and hood rats alike air their grievances over how they've been handled by the police.
Pic itself is similarly conflicted, glamorizing gunslinging while crying foul over unnecessary force, and Ayer proves sensitive to race even as he perpetuates such stock characterizations as the sultry Latina love interest (Martha Higareda) or the clueless white boy (Chris Evans).
The helmer embraces the energy and raw style of such William Friedkin films as "The French Connection" and "To Live and Die in L.A." Like those films, the adrenaline-fueled "Street Kings" experience is all about being caught up in the moment, yet auds need only take a step back to see the plot is riddled with holes (how is it that auds can be so much more attuned to the conspiracy than an experienced officer?).
The dialogue is punctuated with police jargon, which lends credibility to scenes set within L.A.'s roughest neighborhoods, as does the brusque Foley work associated with punches and gunshots. Ayer aims for a sense of heightened realism, staging the key confrontations operatically enough to ensure word of mouth and repeat viewing.
The diverse and talented multiculti cast includes rappers Common and the Game as key villains.

For a movie built around questions of failed ethics and duplicitous behavior, Street Kings  is just as dishonest as its characters. Though conceived as yet another sobering frontline report on law enforcement's ever-expanding gray area, director David Ayer 's grim police thriller mostly plays as one long dick-measuring competition. You sense that an infinitely more complex drama exists within the film's grasp, but no one bothered to stop guzzling the testosterone long enough to find it.
Ayer's résumé only magnifies that disappointment. A screenwriter with credits on mega-macho pictures like S.W.A.T.  and The Fast and the Furious , he also gave Denzel Washington  his second Oscar with his Training Day  script, a subtler look at male-power relationships. And with his directorial debut, 2006's Harsh Times —an underrated buddy drama about an unstable Iraq  vet and his disreputable best friend—he further demonstrated a faculty for pinpointing the economic hardships and emotional impotence that spur guy's-guy bravado while simultaneously skewering its dead-end path.
Unfortunately, such analysis takes a backseat in Street Kings , and all we're left with is the bravado—that and Keanu Reeves , who plays Los Angeles detective Tom Ludlow , an ethically slippery lawman reeling from his wife's death. (We know that he's an alcoholic because he repeatedly chugs mini-bottles of whisky, and that he's emotionally frozen because he looks like Keanu Reeves.)
Though worried that his former partner, Detective Terrence Washington  (Terry Crews ), might be ratting him out to Internal Affairs for his past indiscretions, Ludlow knows that he's protected by his powerful boss in Administrative Vice, Captain Wander (Forest Whitaker ), who dotes on his team of hard-asses like a proud papa. But when Washington is gunned down in a seemingly random liquor-store holdup, Ludlow pushes to find his ex-partner's killers, despite Wander's warnings not to get involved.
From the setup, Street Kings  is most certainly going to be a Chinatown -like mystery in which the flawed hero's quest will uncover layer upon layer of treachery within respected civic institutions while saving his soul in the process. But rather than using that framework for a larger exploration of, well, anything, the movie leans hard on the furled-brow banality of its message. The B-movie screenplay—credited to crime master James Ellroy , Ultraviolet  auteur Kurt Wimmer , and newcomer Jamie Moss —approaches its cautionary tale with an arsenal of dull tough-guy dialogue, as the male characters take turns mowing down each other's masculinity when they're not delivering hard-boiled pseudo-knowledge about the nature of evil. ("Bad breeds bad" and "Blood doesn't wash away blood" are but two of the script's bon mots ready-made for a bumper sticker on your favorite nihilist's car.)
For years, the hip-hop community has been criticized for its glorification of Scarface  -style antiheroes, idolizing criminal behavior and its illicit rewards without focusing on the usually violent ends. But a film like Street Kings  offers the flipside fantasy that's equally corrosive: the notion of the one righteous dude who gets his hands dirty operating outside the law in the name of justice. It's a myth that reaches as far back as Dirty Harry  , and edgy contemporary TV dramas like The Shield  at least question the morality of such a stance. But while Street Kings  pines for a gritty realism and a corresponding wised-up attitude about the thin line between cops and robbers, it's hopelessly quaint at its core. The movie kicks your ass and takes your name because it doesn't know what else to do.
