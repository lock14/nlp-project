Let us take a moment to sympathize with poor, misunderstood Kazakhstan. With less than two decades of post-Soviet liberty under their cardboard belt, as yet a tad unsteady on their pseudo-democratic feet, this newborn nation is already finding itself the butt of one of the most elaborate and ingeniously orchestrated pranks of all time. And like the inveterate new kid on the playground � scrawny, ill-kempt, and prone to self-defeating tantrums � Kazakhstan has opened its collective mouth and let out a wail in the form of a series of full-page and no doubt pricey advertisements/broadsides in no less than The New York Times
. The cause of all this gnashing of Kazakhstani teeth? Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and his comedic alter ego, the alleged Kazakh newsman Borat Sagdiyev. Woe unto those nations that cannot take a joke, fo they become more buttlike in the unlaughingness of their overreacts (as Borat would surely mangle the phrase). First unleashed on the world in a series of BBC comedic sketches on the Cambridge alumnus Cohen's Da Ali G Show
 and later picked up for domestic consumption by HBO, Borat is the ugly American (or Brit) from elsewhere: a clueless, gangly, mustachioed moron prone to anti-Semitic tirades so subversively over-the-top that the only serious reaction is giggles. This feature-length expansion of Cohen's deliciously ridiculous character accomplishes what decades of Soviet propaganda failed to do: It points out and underscores issues of race, religious intolerance, classism, and all manner of very American social ills by giving the culprits just enough rope to hang themselves by their own petards (and then some). On the face of it, Borat
 is a mockumentary. It follows the titular clod and his producer, Azamat (Davitian), from their backwater Kazakhstan hovels (where Borat lives with his sister, "the number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan!") to America on an ostensible mission of discovery and cultural growth. Almost immediately, however, the lovesick Borat falls for the image of Pamela Anderson, and the film heads west with marriage on its mind. In between Borat's arrival in New York City and the end of his epic quest are some of the most fearless acts of transgressive comedy in years. Forever in character, Cohen wrangles invitations for Borat to poshly racist Southern dinner parties, meets with nonplussed feminists (where he compares the size of the female brain to that of a squirrel), wanders dazed and confused into a holy-rolling pentecostal megachurch, and scares the bejesus out of Baywatch
er Anderson. This is shockingly blunt comedy and shockingly funny, too. Cohen and Davitian are utterly fearless, poking fun not only at Americans but at the stereotype of the foreign Other as well. As of last weekend, a massive intra-studio bidding war for Cohen's next film has erupted. Oddly, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Information has gone quiet. If they're biting their tongues as hard as I did, they're going to need stitches.


Lacerating irony has rarely had such a sweet, unassuming face as that of Borat Sagdiyev, the sixth most famous reporter in Kazakhstan.
Crossing America in a repurposed ice cream truck and a shabby gray suit, mustache aquiver for the nuances of life in this grand old "US and A," Borat maneuvers himself into situations with average Americans -- feminists, churchgoers, frat boys, politicians -- and unloads one frag-bomb of political incorrectness after another. All he asks is that we show ourselves to him in our open-hearted, bigoted glory.
And we do. Good Lord, do we ever. "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is a comic put-on of awe-inspiring crudity and death-defying satire and by a long shot the funniest film of the year. It is "Jackass" with a brain and Mark Twain with full frontal male nudity.
The enlightened cynicism of H.L. Mencken and Jonathan Swift courses through this movie's veins, along with the social curiosity of Alexis de Tocqueville, the scientific eye of a wildlife biologist, and a great comedian's love of the unspeakably juvenile.
Which is to say I hurt myself laughing at "Borat," but I'm not sure whether it was from the jokes or from the deep clefts the movie leaves in our national psyche.
Borat, of course, is not Borat at all but Sacha Baron Cohen, the British comic and star of HBO's "Da Ali G Show" on which the character makes regular appearances. The shtick is simple: Borat, a descendant of SNL's "wild and crazy guys" and Balki from "Perfect Strangers," sets up an interview with a subject who's unaware he or she is being spoofed. He asks increasingly outrageous questions, and waits patiently for an explosion, and because he seems sincere -- and because our parents have raised us to be nice to agreeable foreigners who mangle the English language -- it usually takes a good long while before the interviewees pull the plug.
This is "Candid Camera" as confrontational art, and it's both cruel and undeniably funny. It's also revelatory: In the lag time before Borat's subjects have had enough, they tend to say things they might otherwise not. When a GM
 salesman is asked "What kind of car will attract a woman who shave down there?" and without missing a beat responds "That'd be the Corvette," right there is the entire history of automotive advertising in America.
Directed with engaging looseness by Larry Charles, "Borat" is structured as a documentary that sends our intrepid reporter to New York City along with his truculent producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Their mission is to bring lessons home from the greatest country in the world to help with Kazakhstan's major issues, "economic, social, and Jew." Borat's cheerful, unrepentant anti-Semitism is wielded as a double-edged sword, one that rubs salt in the wounds of post-Soviet bigotry and all-American racism. (When he finally meets some actual Jews -- in the form of a sweet old couple who run a B&B -- his panic says as much as their obliviousness.)
The trick is to take the most indefensible social position and see where people don't
 agree with it. Once Borat gets a glimpse of Pamela Anderson on late-night TV, he's off and running to California to claim his bride, and his tour takes him through the deep South . There's a mind-scorching dinner party with a group of wealthy Alabamans who live on Secession Drive -- Baron Cohen keeps pushing their buttons until he finds the one that makes them scream uncle -- and a rodeo at which he assures the assembled throng that Kazakhstanis "support your war of terror" and where Borat finds common ground over the preferred treatment of gay people.
I think my favorite scene is the one where a disconsolate Borat -- temporarily separated from Azamat and their bear (don't ask) -- hitches a ride with a group of University of South Carolina frat brothers in an RV. They could be the three faces of American male youth, drunk on beer, bravado, and stupidity. One inveighs against the "bitches" that let men down, a second goes even deeper into misogyny (you can count his future divorces using both hands), and the third -- the chubby one who the other two probably make fun of behind his back -- cheers this strange little foreigner with heartfelt words of emotional support. There it is: Everything that makes this country ugly and great in one Winnebago.
Actually, I take that back: The funniest sequence in "Borat" takes place between the newscaster and his producer, and when you see it you'll know which one I mean. It's not that I don't want to spoil the scene. I just can't describe it without losing my job.
Baron Cohen is Jewish, and Borat's native tongue in the film is a potted, enthusiastic mixture of Hebrew and double-talk; in any event, he's an authentic Kazakhstani the way Chico Marx was a real Italian. That the government of Kazakhstan has taken umbrage over "Borat" is just the icing on the cupcake of a pretty good joke. What makes the film lift off into the ether, though, is Baron Cohen's skills as a master ironist and physical comedian.
He'll do anything for a laugh but he never once breaks character -- never winks to let the audience off the hook -- and the most sublime moments come from Borat's merrily dense collision with our complicated values. Informed that in this country a woman has the right to choose with whom she has sex, he responds with an incredulous "Whaaat
?," and you almost feel the poor man's pain. Isn't America a beacon of heedless pleasures? Don't we promise freedom, fast cars, and a porn star in every bed? Where's the beef?
"Borat" is silliness at its most trenchant, and if your sense of irony isn't factory installed, you'll probably find it horrifying. Take comfort in the thought that we get the cultural commentators and the comedians we deserve, and that in Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen we have found our curse and our blessing.


         You will laugh at "Borat," you really will, but the laughter will sometimes stick in your throat. This is partially intentional — "Borat's" fiendish brand of subversive social commentary comes with an ironclad shock-and-offend guarantee — but partially not.
 
  "Borat," or to give it its full title, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," is the brainchild of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, a performer who is touched by a kind of genius so savage it makes you consider both the very nature of comedy and what makes us laugh.
 


         






    As was evident in his British-bred HBO television series "Da Ali G Show," Cohen has a gift for never breaking character, for submerging himself so deeply into the personas he creates you wonder if the man himself could come up for air even if he wanted to.
 
  First seen on the HBO show, Borat Sagdiyev is a fictional television journalist from Kazakhstan, a real country portrayed here as such a hotbed of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and all-around inappropriate behavior that a Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman plaintively said: "We understand that Borat is a kind of satire, but it is just a pity that Mr. Cohen chose Kazakhstan as the origin of his hero."
 
  With his wide-eyed, pasted-on grin, thick mustache and loping Groucho Marx gait, Borat is a profane innocent with a will of steel, as earnest as he is devious, someone who is so much a product of his stridently politically incorrect culture that his actions are intended to make us question aspects of our own.
 
  As conceived and written by Cohen and three other writers and directed by Larry Charles ("Seinfeld"), "Borat" begins in its hero's dilapidated hometown of Kuczek (actually shot in Romania). There we meet his celebrated sister, "No. 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan," and witness one of the town's most revered customs, the Running of the Jew, in which local kids chase an enormous papier-mâché Hebrew through the streets of the city. And the fun is just beginning.
 
  Most of "Borat" involves the man's journey to "the U.S. and A." with his producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). The trip begins in New York City and ends, after Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson via old "Baywatch" episodes, with a cross-country drive to California in a dilapidated ice cream van.
 
  Along the way Borat has various misadventures, as often as not involving masturbation and defecation, each episode intended to be more outrageous and potentially offensive than the last. (This is likely the first film ever with a "Feces provided by" credit.) Among the more memorable incidents are:
 
  A speech at a Virginia rodeo in which Borat tells the crowd, "We support your war of terror. May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq."
 
  An encounter with a Southern bed-and-breakfast run by a Jewish couple where Borat insists that two roaches who invade his room are the shape-shifted owners and throws dollar bills at the bugs to mollify them.
 
  A jaw-dropping nude bout of no-holds-barred wrestling between Borat and his rotund producer that goes considerably beyond anything that can be seen on YouTube, or anywhere else.
 
  Because the "Borat" crew shot the interviews as if Cohen really was a clueless Kazakh journalist, none of the people who appear in it (except for wrestling partner Davitian and an actress who plays a prostitute) is aware that he or she is talking to a guerrilla comedian.
 
  We don't laugh at all of this, but we laugh at more of it than would seem possible, even if our laughter makes us uncomfortable enough to wonder why. For one of the unexpected things that seeing "Borat" underlines is that we don't laugh only because something strikes us as amusing. We laugh out of astonishment and disbelief, out of embarrassment for what the people on screen are going through, and because we simply can't figure out any other way to respond. "Borat" takes advantage of all these, and more.
 
  We also laugh at situations that don't sound funny on the page because of Cohen's powerful comic presence. This is a very smart guy with the likability all comedians have to have, and he is very deft at what he does.
 
  In addition to a taste for slapstick (watch for him negotiating his way down the first escalator of his life), Cohen has a remarkable knack for improvisational response — he's dazzling at a garage sale he stumbles across — that serves him here just as it did when he was Ali G.
 
  Again in the Ali G mode, Borat the reporter specializes in tweaking people in power and the blindly prejudicial. Looking especially poleaxed are a pair of pillars of the conservative Republican establishment, former Georgia Rep. Bob Barr and former presidential candidate Alan Keyes. And a man at that Virginia rodeo is allowed to hang himself with his gleefully homophobic comments.
 
  But because Cohen is intentionally provocative, willing to mock whoever crosses his path, he ends up baiting the harmless and playing ordinary people for fools just because they are gullible and had the bad luck to run into him, and it's here that the laughter especially sticks in your throat. The car dealer who doesn't object when Borat makes anti-Gypsy remarks may not be a secret racist but simply someone who decided it was a mug's game to get further involved with an obvious lunatic. And the Southern dining society that gets mercilessly humiliated seems to have committed no sin worse than earnestness, credulity and hospitality.
 
  With his corrosive brand of take-no-prisoners humor that scalds on contact, Cohen is the most intentionally provocative comedian since Lenny Bruce and early Richard Pryor, with a difference. For unlike those predecessors, there is a mean-spiritedness, an every-man-for-himself coldness about his humor. The one kind of laughter you won't find in "Borat" is that which acknowledges shared humanity. Instead, there is that pitiless staple of reality TV, watching others humiliate themselves for our viewing pleasure.
 
  Gifted and funny though he is, Cohen and his love of transgression are finally very much of and about our time. For better or worse, we deserve each other, and we might as well laugh.

  In general release.   

The bad-boy British prankster-comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has beady, forlorn eyes offset by a smile that's like a wall of teeth, yet he disappears almost entirely into his characters  not because he wears very intricate disguises, but because he plays those characters as if projecting a hidden side of himself. He's a walking cherrybomb id, a fusion of Andy Kaufman and Howard Stern. You may think he's joking, but you don't always know for sure, and the effect is to leave an audience convulsed, and unsettled, with laughter.
As Borat Sagdiyev, a dim-witted, fumbling, thickly mustached star reporter from Kazakhstan who claims to be making a TV documentary for his beloved audience back home, Baron Cohen, in the scandalously rude and funny shot-on-video guerrilla comedy Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan , drives from New York to Los Angeles, mingling all the way with real, live homegrown citizens, most of whom have no idea that they're being put on. He talks to humorless middle-aged feminists and a piously dainty Southern dining club, messes with hotel clerks and car dealers and frat-house morons, wanders onto a weatherman's live report and ''accidentally'' smashes up an antiques shop. He even interviews a couple of name politicians, goading them with his toxic How low can I go?  barbs (he calls Alan Keyes ''a genuine chocolate face  no makeup!''), which he spews in a Euro-Slavic accent so thick it makes his English sound less pidgin than platypus. (When he utters the word ''vagina,'' which is not infrequently, he mangles it into something almost bestial.)
At times, Borat talks like a bad amateur shock jock. He thinks that men are rapists, which to him is a compliment, that women are whorish receptacles (he longs to ''make sexytime'' with Pamela Anderson), that Jews are devils; his view of homosexuals makes Pat Robertson's look lavender. Yet for all the glorious, and jolting, offensiveness of his closed-minded, pea-brained patter, Borat, from what we can see, has no hatred in him. He's as innocent as a child. Baron Cohen makes him the best sort of pest, the kind who preys on people's weaknesses, coaxing out the prejudices they're too polite to expose. He finds solidarity, too  with the gun salesman who doesn't blink when asked which gun he'd favor for killing Jews (he recommends the Glock), or the Pentecostal preacher who declares, ''We're a Christian nation now.'' W.C. Fields said you can't cheat an honest man, and Borat, a blinkered, intolerant idiot who brings out the blinkered, intolerant idiot in others, demonstrates that it's hard to make anyone look like more of a lout than he or she already is.
In one of the film's delirious high points, Borat gets trotted out, in a Stars and Stripes shirt and string tie, at a Virginia rodeo, where he gives a speech supporting America's ''war of terror,'' then makes one increasingly bloodthirsty comment after the next. Slowly, hilariously, the crowd devolves from cheers to stunned silence, but not before they've applauded some very bad things. The director, Larry Charles, is a veteran of Curb Your Enthusiasm , and that makes him a perfect match for Baron Cohen, who specializes in the comedy of embarrassment  situations so cruel they make you squirm. Borat, in his doltish way, doesn't assault; he exposes. Sometimes literally so: When he and his partner, the sweaty, obese Azamat (Ken Davitian), get into a furious bout of nude wrestling in their hotel room, it's an in-your-face scene in more ways than one. The two scamper through the hotel, still naked, and onto an elevator, which produces a look of priceless fake calm on the part of the other patrons. If the scene comes perilously close to Jackass , it's no reduction of Borat  to say that the whole movie is a kind of slapstick psycho-political Jackass . It's a comedy of global insanity in which Borat, the old-world specimen of masculis ignoramus  from an underdeveloped half-Muslim nation, stands in for a world we didn't have to think much about before 9/11, and the people Borat talks to become the symbolic heart of America  a place where intolerance is worn, increasingly, with pride.
A question: Is all of Borat  as ''real'' as the film implies? The scene in which Borat attacks Pamela Anderson is transparently staged. So, to my eyes, are several others. In each case, when I sensed that the people who were being passed off as dupes were in on the setup, the joke fell flat. Why? Because in a comedy that sets its tone with a man letting a live chicken loose on the subway, anything more fake dupes the audience. Yet when Baron Cohen works without a net, he flies.

 Sometime in early 2005,  a mustachioed Kazakh journalist known as Borat Sagdiyev  slipped into America with the intention of making a documentary for the alleged good of his Central Asian nation. Many months later, the funny bruised fruits of his labor, “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” are poised  to hit the collective American conscience with a juicy splat. The Minutemen, those self-anointed guardians of American sovereignty, were watching the wrong border.  Borat, who just recently invited the “mighty warlord” George W. Bush to the premiere of his  film before a gaggle of excited news crews, is the dim brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, the British comic best known until now for another of his pseudonymous identities, Ali G. Described by his creator as a “wannabe gangsta,” Ali G was the host of a British television show, starting in 2000 (HBO had the American edition), where, as the voice of “the yoof,” he interviewed serious and self-serious movers and shakers, including “Boutros Boutros Boutros-Ghali,” Sam Donaldson and Richard Kerr, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who found himself explaining why terrorists could not drive a train into the White House. (No tracks.)  Mr. Baron Cohen succeeded in seducing politicians and pornography stars alike, mostly because Ali G’s phenomenal stupidity made the character seem harmless. He also seemed to represent the ultimate in media big game: young people. Dressed like a Backstreet Boy, complete with Day-Glo romper suits, designer initials and a goatee that looked as if it had been painted on with liquid eyeliner, he was met with bewilderment, exasperation and patience that at times bordered on the saintly. Like Borat and Bruno, another of the comic’s similarly obtuse television alter egos who  made regular appearances on the shows, the joke was equally on Ali G and on the targets of his calculated ignorance.  With Borat, Mr. Baron Cohen took the same basic idea that had worked with Ali G and pushed it hard, then harder. The joke begins with an apparently never-washed gray suit badly offset by brown shoes, which the performer accents with a small Afro and the kind of mustache usually now seen only in 1970s pornography, leather bars and trend articles. Think Harry Reems,  circa 1972, but by way of the Urals. Married or widowed, and he appears to be both, Borat loves women, including his sister, the “No. 4 prostitute” in Kazakhstan, with whom he shares lusty face time in the film’s opener. He’s a misogynist (a woman’s place is in the cage), which tends to go unnoticed because he’s also casually anti-Semitic.  That Mr. Baron Cohen plays the character’s anti-Semitism for laughs is his most radical gambit.  The Anti-Defamation League, for one, has chided him, warning that some people may not be in on the joke. And a sampling of comments on blogs where you can watch some of the older Borat routines, including a singalong in an Arizona bar with the refrain “Throw the Jew down the well,” indicates that the Anti-Defamation League is at least partly right: some people are definitely not in on the joke, though only because some people are too stupid and too racist to understand that the joke is on them. As the 19th-century German thinker August Bebel observed, anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools, a truism Mr. Baron Cohen has embraced with a vengeance.  Given this, it seems instructive to note how discussions of Borat, including the sympathetic and the suspicious, often circle over to the issue of Mr. Baron Cohen’s own identity. Commentators often imply that Borat wouldn’t be funny if Mr. Baron Cohen were not Jewish, which is kind of like saying that Dave Chappelle  wouldn’t be funny if he were not black. For these performers, the existential and material givens of growing up as a Jew in Britain and as a black man in America provide not only an apparently limitless source of fertile comic material, but they are also inseparable from their humor. But no worries: Borat  makes poop jokes and carries a squawking chicken around in a suitcase.  Like General Sherman, he also lays waste to a sizable swath of the South, a line of attack that begins in New York and ends somewhere between the Hollywood Hills and Pamela Anderson’s bosom. The story opens in Kazakhstan (apparently it was shot in a real Romanian village that looks remarkably like the set for a 1930s Universal horror flick), where Borat sketches out his grand if hazy plans before heading off in a horse-drawn auto. Once in New York, in between planting kisses on startled strangers and taking instruction from a humor coach, he defecates in front of a Trump tower (Donald Trump was one of Ali G’s more uncooperative guests) and masturbates in front of a Victoria’s Secret store. The jackass has landed.  It gets better or worse, sometimes at the same time. Whether you rush for the exits or laugh until your lungs ache will depend both on your appreciation for sight gags, eyebrow gymnastics, sustained slapstick and vulgar malapropisms, and on whether you can stomach the shock of smashed frat boys, apparently sober rodeo attendees and one exceedingly creepy gun-store clerk, all taking the toxic bait offered to them by their grinning interlocutor. There is nothing here as singularly frightening as when, during his run on HBO, Borat encountered a Texan who enthused about the Final Solution. That said, the gun clerk’s suggestion of what kind of gun to use to hunt Jews will freeze your blood, especially when you realize that he hasn’t misheard Borat’s mangled English.  That scene may inspire accusations that Mr. Baron Cohen is simply trading on cultural and regional stereotypes, and he is, just not simply. The brilliance of “Borat” is that its comedy is as pitiless as its social satire, and as brainy. Mr. Baron Cohen isn’t yet a total filmmaker like Jerry Lewis (the film was directed by Larry Charles, who has given it a suitably cheap video look), but the comic’s energy and timing inform every scene of “Borat,” which he wrote with Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and his longtime writing and production partner, Dan Mazer. These guys push political buttons, but they also clear room for two hairy men to wrestle nude in a gaspingly raw interlude of physical slapstick that nearly blasts a hole in the film.  Clenched in unspeakably crude formation, those hairy bodies inspire enormous laughs, but they also serve an elegant formal function. The sheer outrageousness of the setup temporarily pulls you out of the story, which essentially works along the lines of one of the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road movies, though with loads of smut and acres of body hair, relieving you of the burden of having to juggle your laughter with your increasingly abused conscience. Just when you’re ready to cry, you howl.  “If the comic can berate and finally blow the bully out of the water,” Mr. Lewis once wrote, “he has hitched himself to an identifiable human purpose.” Sacha Baron Cohen doesn’t blow bullies out of the water; he obliterates them.  “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes raw language, naked men and nude wrestling.

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan

  By 
LESLIE FELPERIN

    
 
 
 
A clueless Kazak reporter learns about America in uproariously funny mockumentary "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." Lead character invented by Brit comedian Sacha Baron Cohen retains an innocent sweetness that mollifies offense his decidedly un-PC remarks might cause. Real-life butt of the pic's pranks, authentic Kazaks, and the terminally humorless won't, and already haven't, seen the funny side. Nevertheless, briskly helmed by "Seinfeld" producer Larry Charles, "Borat" should make abundant B.O. benefit for Fox, especially among younger auds in the U.S. and Blighty.
In the U.K., Cohen and his various alter egos -- white hip-hopper Ali G, Borat himself, and camp Austrian fashion reporter Bruno -- are practically national icons whose catch-phrases (such as Ali G's "Is it because I is black?") have become common currency.
The Borat character reps Cohen at his best. As with Ali G, Borat's modus operandi is to set himself up as a journalist and interview or interact with unsuspecting folk, asking them provocative questions that either shock or embarrass them, or, in some cases, prompt them to reveal their own prejudices.
Borat reps a comically distorted third-world country bumpkin whose intentionally backward attitudes have offended some critics and organizations, although Cohen (who is Jewish) insists the humor is ironic, and that part of his strategy is to expose bigotry and conformity.
Pic opens in Borat's village, an entirely made-up version of Kazakhstan (end credits reveal Romania was used for locations). Talking straight to the camera, Borat proudly introduces his fellow villagers ("This is town rapist," he says, pointing out one shifty looking character. "Naughty, naughty!") and family (a blond he kisses full on the lips turn out to be his sister, "the fourth best prostitute in all of country," Borat proudly reveals as she holds up a trophy.)
It's little wonder the Kazak government, who have arguably more reason than most to take umbrage with the film, has publicly denounced it already, although in the end "Borat" may end up stimulating the country's tourism industry more than upcoming Kazak-made blockbuster "Nomad."
In his capacity as the sixth best-known reporter in Kazakhstan, Borat flies to New York with his obese producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) on a vaguely defined brief to interview locals about American customs.
While Borat and Azamat are en route to California so Borat can fulfill his secret dream of meeting Pamela Anderson (who gamely plays herself), they stop off at a rodeo. The crowd, accustomed to show hospitality to visiting celebrities, dutifully applaud when Borat tells them as a Kazak he supports their country's "war of terror" and clap more quizzically when he wishes that "George Bush may drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq." The booing only really starts when he starts mangling the national anthem.
And so it goes, the plot unfolding mostly via a series of vignettes, although a vague sense of drama is injected by having Borat and Azamat fall out with each other, leading to a masterfully executed slapstick bout of naked man-on-man wrestling, complete with an unfeasibly large black censor's bar.
Meshing nicely with Cohen's own precise comic timing, the helming credited to Larry Charles (pic's previous director, Todd Phillips, reportedly pulled out halfway through the shoot) has an easy lightness of touch. Not a scene goes by that doesn't generate a laugh or three throughout the pic's lean running time.
Credit is no doubt due to the pic's off-camera crew for maintaining straight faces while filming in order not to give the game away to the unsuspecting subjects. Likewise, Cohen's seeming powers of improvisation, ability to stay in character and still come up with funny lines in hostile conditions impresses throughout.
Tech package, deliberately assembled to look low-budget, is pro. Praise is particularly due to editor Craig Alpert, whose cutting consistently enhances comic effect.

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan  is funnier than its malapropic titlethe audience with whom I saw the movie wasn't laughing so much as howlingand even more difficult to parse.
Eyes wide, face fixed in an avid grin, Sacha Baron Cohen 's ersatz Kazakh TV reporter, the ineffably oafish Borat Sagdiyev , goes looking for America. It's a documentary of sorts. The road triphe's afraid to fly "in case the Jews repeated their attack of 9-11"takes him from New York to Los Angeles (where he hopes to bag Pamela Anderson ) by way of Mississippi, and well beyond the boundaries of taste.
America, the "greatest country in the world" per Borat, first appears as a subway car, where the friendly Kazakh introduces himself to passengers and, as is his custom, attempts to double-kiss the men. Predictable agitation is trumped when Borat's cheap suitcase drops open to release a live chicken.
The alert viewer may glimpse director Larry Charles  among the startled commuters, but by and large, Baron Cohen's lumpen performance artreplete with all manner of public display and daredevil idiocyis skilled at concealing its tracks. In the most spectacular example, Borat's bedroom tussle with his heavyset "Kazakh" producer (Ken Davitian ), caught masturbating with a picture of Pamela, escalates into a naked chase down the hotel elevator, through the lobby, and into a banquet of the local mortgage brokers' association.
Not simply a jackass, Borat (like Baron Cohen's earlier creation Ali G ) specializes in one-on-ones with unwary professionals, snared by their willingness to humor a hapless foreigner and desire to appear on (even Kazakh) TV. Stooges range from a self-identified humor consultant ("Do you ever laugh on people with retardation?" Borat wonders) to a car salesman (asked if the automobile is outfitted with a "pussy magnet") to a pair of pols, former Georgia representative Bob Barr  and perennial candidate Alan Keyes . What did they knowand when did they know it? Keyes realizes something before our eyes when, after a long, faux-naive account of a Gay Pride rally, Borat says, "Are you telling me that the man who tried to put a rubber fist into my anus was a homosexual?"
How does Baron Cohen keep a straight face? If ever there was a movie that demanded a documentary devoted to its making, it's this one. (Press notes assert the filmmakers were reported as terrorists and trailed by the FBI .) That both Barr and Keyes are right-wing moralizers suggests something about the Baron Cohen agenda. It's hardly coincidental that the antique store he trashes specializes in Confederate memorabilia. Interviewing "veteran feminists" or Atlanta homies, Borat baffles them with his chauvinist stupidity. But picked up by a van of South Carolina  frat boys or chatting with the owner of the Imperial Rodeo, he has alarmingly little difficulty getting them to articulate the idea of reinstituting slavery or making homosexuality a capital offense.
Baron Cohen has gleefully involved the government of Kazakhstan  in a campaign against Boratshowing up at the White House  on the day President Bush  hosted Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev . But his target isn't really an imaginary version of Nazerbayev's nation (nor its enemies, the "evil nitwits" of Uzbekistan ); it is rather the domain of the "great warlord Premier Bush," red states in particular. "I think the cultural differences are just vast," the Mississippi matron hosting Borat for dinner at her Magnolia Mansion (on Secession Drive) confides to the camera while her guest is away from the table. Those differences become unbridgeable when Borat returns with a stool sample, and then with the arrival of his indescribably inappropriate daterecruited from the back-page ads of the local alt-weekly.
The movie's set piece has Borat wearing an American-flag shirt and looking like Saddam Hussein  plugged into the wallentertain a Virginia rodeo with his Kazakh version of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Borat's introductory declaration of support for America's "war of terror" gets an ovation, his fervent wish that George Bush "drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq " a slightly less enthusiastic one. The crowd starts booing, however, when they hear him sing, "Kazakhstan is the great country in the worldall other countries are run by little girls." (Borat manages to complete this anthem; a report in The Roanoke Times   suggests that Baron Cohen and his crew had to be hustled out of the place before they were lynched.)
It's almost anticlimactic when Borat wanders into a Pentecostal church and, in the presence of a Mississippi congressman and justice of the state supreme court, is baptized in the spirit. "Does Jesus like me?" he cries, his impassioned babble lost in the mass glossolalia and the strident "Kazakh" fiddle music arising on the soundtrack. To what faith does Borat subscribe? It's an interesting, never answered question. At one point, he's told to shave off his mustache so that he doesn't look Muslim"just Eye-talian." But there's no suggestion that Borat is Muslim; his only religion seems to be anti-Semitism.
Borat is not just blatant but proselytizing; his statements precipitate the latent anti-Semitism around him. (The most outrageous example, not in the film, is the widely circulated TV bit in which Borat incites the patrons of an Arizona bar to join him in singing a Kazakh folk song, "Throw the Jew Down the Well.") Small wonder the Anti-Defamation League  has expressed concern. The organization deemed it unfortunate that Borat is identified with an actual nationas though the joke would work if Baron Cohen were passing himself off as a TV reporter from Upper Sloboviabut that's a displacement. Their real anxiety is that by satirizing anti-Semitism, Borat will legitimize it.
