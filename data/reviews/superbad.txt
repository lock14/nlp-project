Now that Judd Apatow has written and/or directed and/or produced upward of a hundred movies about mostly the same thing involving mostly the same people since his peak with Freaks and Geeks
 � all three of the previews before the sneak of Superbad
 were "from the guy who brought you" or "those guys" who did � one begins to imagine him not only as a sort of King Turd on Hollywood's Shit Hill but also as that dude in high school who, when given the opportunity to bring up the rear of the popular clique at the beginning of freshman year, shrewdly opts to lead a pack with their tails between their legs. His act won't play everywhere, but it'll work on these losers. Who can blame that dude? Being the best of the worst brings its own boost; adolescence � and the studio system � is a matter of survival, and the funny guy always has flexibility. Still, sooner than he thinks, his fate is sealed with these fellas for better or worse; every Saturday night, they're doing the same stupid stuff. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes you get sick of it. Lately, Apatow and his buddies have made comedies for a certain age group, not ones for the ages. Luckily, Superbad
 comes a little closer. Toward the end of it and their senior year, Evan (Cera) confronts Seth (Hill) � Evan Goldberg and Rogen are writing what they know here � about their friendship. He laments that he wasted his high school years "talking bullshit" in the basement when he could have been out meeting new people and getting laid. (Clearly George Michael has come a long way since Bland ... I mean Ann.) The drama is all in Cera's tone and Hill's expression. It's one of those moments � that real-life moment you wish every Apatow production had more of � and one that all of the saturated one-liners, cute nicknames, quirky period details, neat turns of phrase, beery bons mots, colloquialisms, and ironic gangsta slang in the world aren't going to get you out of. As they stand in the middle of a dark road in the middle of a struggle with sex, bullies, and separation anxiety on a particularly stressful Friday night, they are Neal dressing down Del in a hotel room in Planes, Trains & Automobiles
. Like that John Hughes gem, Superbad
 is, in part, about adapting and coping with a loss of control. It's also about being hilarious, and it doesn't hurt that its credits are filled with Arrested Development
 refugees, including Mottola (who also wrote and directed The Daytrippers
). Cera spins gold with every line throughout; Hill fulfills his fat-kid birthright as a gifted physical comedian. Mintz-Plasse, whose voice breaks every time he talks in his debut, is a fine sideman. There are drags: Scenes often go on too long in confined settings, the film threatens to collapse with every gag that falls flat, and the supporting cast is spotty. But mostly Superbad
 is as soulful and funky as its soundtrack.


American movies generally want us to do more than like a character. They want us to root for him.
This necessitates charm, wit, humility, talent, a handsome face, something. A few movies take a character's likability for granted, as though his very circumstances are enough to make us root for him, as though the act of cheering on a character will make us love him. It should really be the other way around: Affection should inspire support.
"Superbad" is one of those movies that has this backward. It assumes that the desperate adolescent boy's quest for sex is so universal that we'd root for anybody to score, regardless of whether we love the kids in pursuit. The movie wants us to cheer on husky Seth (Jonah Hill) and noodly Evan (Michael Cera) in a quest to buy alcohol for a big party, where, God willing, two girls will take their virginity.
The ecstatically amused audience I saw it with didn't have any problem loving the movie or anticipating these two losing it. But I was never sufficiently seduced. I didn't like Seth and couldn't rouse myself to root for him. Needless to say, it was a lonely two hours.
Set in a virtually unparented American everyburb, "Superbad" has a degree more sophistication than "Revenge of the Nerds" and "American Pie," and less than the underrated "House Party." It's just as ribald as all of them. The movie spends a couple of days and one long night with Seth and Evan in the months before they leave for college. Their plan never to be apart has been upended since only Evan got into Dartmouth, and the movie's emotional subtext very much involves Seth's heartbreak over the possible loss of his best friend.
"Superbad" emerges from the increasingly successful happy comedy family whose central figure is Judd Apatow. He wrote and directed "Knocked Up" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," and produced this movie. The writers are Evan Goldberg and "Knocked Up" star Seth Rogen, childhood friends who've named the characters after themselves. Director Greg Mottola has overseen some excellent canceled TV series, including "Arrested Development" and Apatow's own "Undeclared."
"Superbad" has some of that Apatow feeling. The few smart observations could have come from an episode of one of his TV shows. But the movie is missing the gentle moral authority and most of the human warmth. (There is one affectionate moment between Seth and Evan in a sleeping bag that suggests a suburban "Y Tu Mama Tambien," and one disagreement between them evokes the wounded spats in Barry Levinson's "Diner.") "Superbad" also lacks a funny woman or at least some female perspective -- it would have been nice to hear what the girls see in these boys.
The filmmakers are much more interested in Seth's combustibility. He is explosively vulgar. The camera gets in close on his face as he screams frustrated obscenities at whomever. Humiliation (once, he's bled on; twice, he's hit by a car) only seems to make him worse. His unpopular status in school seems warranted: He's toxic and selfish.
"Superbad" belongs to that family of horny-misfit movies -- outcast boys want to hook up with cool girls but they've been too preoccupied with their obsessions to have learned how. But sex has been Seth's nerdy obsession, and he is pathological about every aspect of it. In explaining his contempt for the girl Evan likes, Seth tells a story, which the movie dramatizes, about how, years ago, she glimpsed one of his copious penis drawings. His phallophilia appears to have inspired his misogyny. That the movie knows the character is a lech doesn't make him any more fun.
Hill, who looks older than a high school senior, has had small parts of a similar vein in "Knocked Up" and "Evan Almighty." He was like a condiment in those movies. A little went a long, enjoyable way. As the star of his own film, he's a bowl of mustard. He has Albert Brooks's defensive sense of superiority (and a version of his wild curly hair), but he rarely gets to express that superiority as wit. It comes out in the form of breathless exclamatory expletives.
When I laughed at Hill it was when he was given something remotely printable to say. (He has a very funny line about manual sex, camouflage, and Vietnam.) But it's hard to build an entire movie around his kind of negativity. And as sweetly funny as Cera is in letting some of his lines just trail off unfinished (he was underrated as Jason Bateman's son on "Arrested Development"), he's not substantial enough a presence to wrest the movie away from Hill.
The filmmakers take breaks from these two to give us time with Seth and Evan's extremely geeky buddy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who, after a mishap purchasing liquor with a fake ID, spends the movie riding along with a pair of reckless nincompoop cops, played by Rogen and Bill Hader. These scenes are tiresome and unpleasant (they look like they've been shot through beer goggles), but Mintz-Plasse has great comic style. He whines and wheezes his lines with a kind of broken musicality, and his face is often caught making an expression somewhere between shock and a sneeze.
As films about the young and the horny go, I preferred the smarter approach director Jeffrey Blitz takes in "Rocket Science," a comedy that also opens here today. "Superbad" feels confused by comparison. It's an R-rated film with the simple sensibility of a show that might play on the teen cable channel The N. But it's also thoroughly entrenched in a retrograde adolescence that keeps slipping outside teen comedy into the territory of the horror film. "American Pie," whose makers tried to give their inexperienced lads some carnal knowledge, did the same thing: It turned sex into something you'd expect to see in "The Exorcist."
"Superbad" comes up with mysterious menstrual blood, pre-coital puking, violently possessive 30-something cokeheads, and terrified reaction shots to it all. I wanted to find this as funny as audiences did. But it mostly made me understand the case for staying a virgin until you're 40.


In the spirit of full disclosure, let me begin by stating that, like 50 percent of the potential audience for Superbad , I don't have a penis. So my sense of what's funny about the hardware and its capabilities  a fertile source of laughs in this torrentially foulmouthed, sex-mad comedy of good high school kids gone horny and male friendship cemented by sexual anxiety  is that of an observer, rather than an owner. Also, my high school years are so far behind me that the guys who were geeks then are now the balding fathers of sons who have inherited the earth as website wunderkinds and highly paid sitcom writers.
But while it is demographically challenging for me (and, perhaps, for others who graduated high school when thong underwear was still only an option for strippers, not students) to love the movie with knowing gusto, it's easy to enjoy the pulsing phallic comedic energy of the enterprise. Superbad  is a third serving of gaily dirty, man-boy sweetness, after The 40 Year-Old Virgin  and Knocked Up , under the aegis of comedy impresario Judd Apatow, and it's a festival of blithely unreliable information about What Women Want. As best friends and graduating seniors Seth (Jonah Hill, the stocky, shock-haired, high-flame Oliver Hardy of the pair) and Evan (nascent comedy superstar Michael Cera, the low-burn Stan Laurel) face the prospect of a partnership disrupted by the distractions of college, they envision one last chance to unload their nagging virginity: They'll get a couple of girls drunk at a party and do 'em. Lay 'em, plow 'em...choose the age-old crudity of your choice.
For help in procuring liquor, the underage strategists enlist a fellow nerd (novice phenom Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who provides false hope of similar stardom to the millions of four-eyed, sparrow-chested peers without his unique, squeaky style). And the supersuave mono-moniker the kid chooses when he scores a fake ID  McLovin  becomes an extended punchline involving doofus cops and a wild, no-parents- in-sight party. The rest is mishap, improv, declarations of love (between BFFs Seth and Evan), and, well, chastity.
That's Superbad 's clean little secret, the throwback thing that's almost as fascinating to this seasoned female as the fabulous illustrations of male genitalia (clad in the raiment of superheroes) that Seth used to draw in grade school. For all the boasts about banging, the scramble to buy booze, the elaborate teen-male nightmare horror at the sight of scary menstrual blood from some girl's mysterious Down There, the movie doesn't stray from a path of righteousness. This notion of a wild party is so safe, it might as well be an instance of approved Amish oat-sowing. We take his word that Evan has a crush on his nice classmate Becca (Martha MacIsaac), although we have no idea who she is besides a female person who, even when dangerously drunk and in the mood, doesn't take off her bra. We agree to pretend to believe that Seth has plans to get it on with Jules (Emma Stone), the impossibly perfect hottie who's popular and  not mean and  retains her coolness although she doesn't drink when all around her do.
In The 40 Year-Old Virgin , the desires of a sexually frightened early-middle-aged man meet up with the reality of a mature woman with her own wants. In Knocked Up , a younger skittish fellow faces the adult consequences of sexual activity with a semi-mature woman who has to figure out her own wants. We're going back to the future, my friends: Jules is even less likely representing a real, live girl. I know that teen transformation is the point of Superbad 's fantasy vibe, a story about boy friends, not the chicks who get in the way. But it's also the movie's limitation.
Abundantly talented Seth Rogen (star of Knocked Up , who plays one of the cops, opposite Saturday Night Live 's Bill Hader) and Evan Goldberg (best-childhood-friend-from-funny-Canada) wrote the script when they were  themselves young(er) guys. And although Apatow (who's almost 40) produces and Greg Mottola (even older, an episode director of Apatow's Undeclared ) directs with an adult understanding of and affection for teen hormonal rhythms, the story is still that of boys and their wangdoodles. Superbad  is cute if you like guys who aren't even remotely bad, in a coming-of-age tale so old-fashioned the girls might just as well be wearing bloomers.

 Horny is as horny does in the sweetly absurd high school comedy “Superbad.” A tickly, funny tale of three teenage boys revved up by their surging, churning, flooding hormones, the movie joins the tumescent ranks of similarly themed works about male sexual desire — consider “Portnoy’s Complaint,” think “Porky’s” — and its somatic epiphanies, treacherous secretions, anguished lessons and apparently limitless storehouse of embarrassments. Behold the man (well, boy): fully sexed and wholly, touchingly virginal.  Written by Seth Rogen, last seen scoring in “Knocked Up,” and his childhood friend Evan Goldberg, “Superbad” follows two high school seniors — also named Seth and Evan — who together set off on a long night’s journey into the soul. Actually, what they do is try to booze up and party down with some school hotties during a nighttown adventure in missed opportunities and unexpected revelations. Time is short: summer looms, as does the fall, when Evan (Michael Cera, excellent) will depart for Dartmouth alongside his classmate Fogell (the newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), leaving behind his academically challenged best friend, Seth (Jonah Hill). The future holds promise, even for Seth, yet also threatens the worst, especially if they don’t become some girl’s morning- after headache.  “We could be that mistake!” insists Seth, his voice shrill with hope and panic.  If the penis is puzzled in “Portnoy’s Complaint,” as Alexander Portnoy’s shrink believes, in “Superbad” it is thoroughly, stunningly clueless and as violently tremulous as a divining rod at Hoover Dam. Along with Fogell, a walking irritant with mad skills (he  procures a fake ID), Seth and Evan prowl their high school in search of — what, precisely? From their bawdy language, filled with vivid anatomical notes and gaudily colorful phrasing, the three would very much like to bed some “ladies,” as Fogell insists on calling them in a tragicomic bid at Kanye West suavity. The tearful joke being that these yapping pups wouldn’t know what to do with any woman, much less the bosomy babes of their whipped-cream and dirty dreams.  The divide between what a man says — and what he thinks he should say, especially to other men — and how he really feels inside largely defines the comedic ethos of Judd Apatow, one of the movie’s producers and its spiritual laughing light. Much like “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up,” both of which Mr. Apatow directed and either wrote or helped write,  “Superbad” largely works not because the jokes are funny, which they generally are, even on the spitometer. It works because no matter how unapologetically vulgar their words, no matter how single-mindedly priapic their preoccupations, these men and boys are good and decent and tender and true. They never take cruel or callous advantage. They call. They love. They marry.  Mr. Apatow traffics in such a cute, cuddly vision of modern masculinity that it seems rude to wonder if it’s honestly felt (which is what I think), self-flattering (ditto) or cunningly opportunistic (nah). Certainly it’s testosterone-heavy, if not exactly macho. And, indeed, part of what’s fascinating about Mr. Apatow’s ascendancy, and why the comedy moment belongs to him more than it does  either to the Farrelly brothers or to Ben Stiller and his mob, is how he has created — and come close to perfecting — a masculine variation on  aspirational wish-fulfillment movies like “Legally Blonde.” Except instead of perky, pretty women reaching up, up, up, Mr. Apatow offers  freaks and geeks aching to be worthy of those same women.  And if these guys aren’t especially worthy, well, such is the way of the wish-fulfillment fantasy. Mr. Apatow shamelessly stacks the deck in favor of his  underdogs — the future doctors, lawyers and Hollywood hitmakers of America, no doubt — but his intentions are generally righteous and his humor doesn’t depend too heavily on flatulence or sadism. Or filmmaking.  Given Mr. Apatow’s tendencies, it’s no surprise that the director of “Superbad,” Greg Mottola, doesn’t leave much of an imprint. Mr. Mottola, whose first and last big-screen effort was the fine 1996 comedy “The Daytrippers,” has spent much of the last decade working in network television (sometimes with Mr. Apatow) and it shows. In “Superbad,” his setups and camerawork serve the characters unobtrusively, as do the homey production design and costumes.  It’s a nice homeyness, lived-in and honest. Much like Mr. Rogen, who alongside Bill Hader puts in an unfortunately overextended appearance in “Superbad” as a dangerously juvenile cop, the young male actors in “Superbad” look as pleasantly, sympathetically real as they behave. They’re at a total and happy remove from the musclebound cartoons of prime-time and action-flick reveries.  Long and lanky, Mr. Cera moves like one of those teenagers whose body hasn’t yet fully caught up to his newly reached height. With his wide-open face and smile, he looks absolutely amazed by what he can see from a higher elevation (the world!). But of course he looks  surprised: he’s the top half of the exclamation point to the spherical Mr. Hill’s rolling big dot.  “Superbad” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Supernaughty.

The bawdy jokes score big points, but it's the rueful acknowledgement of adolescent embarrassment and humiliation that most distinguishes "Superbad," another ultra-raunchy and commercial sex comedy from the Judd Apatow laugh factory. Co-written by and featuring "Knocked Up" star Seth Rogen, this very cheesy-looking account of three horndogs' long night's journey into hazy self-awareness is like "American Pie" with a conscience. Fixation on all manner of bodily functions and a plethora of outrageously out-there gags guarantee strong teen and date-night turnout, although demos will skew younger than for "Knocked Up" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." Pic will never die as a high school and frathouse keg-party favorite.
Although this picaresque little odyssey is decidedly set in the present day, the title, silhouetted opening credits and predominantly funk-soul soundtrack provide a distinctly '70s feel, an impression furthered by a muddy, fuzzy visual style (perhaps partly attributable to nocturnal digital shooting) that harks back to the day when AIP and Crown Intl. were knocking out their own teensploitationers.
It's easy to imagine the elemental script and storyline -- cooked up by Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were teenagers -- being filmed at the time they first started writing it: Two nerdy best friends trying to get laid on a party night before going their separate ways to college is a premise that can play anytime, anywhere. But the dialogue back then would never have been as bluntly crude as it is here; nor would the final credits have been festooned with creative drawings of phalluses, a nod to the childhood obsession of the Rogen stand-in here.
That boy, not at all coincidentally named Seth (younger Rogen clone Jonah Hill), is a motor-mouthed fatso born with an over-supply of vulgar bravado. Best friend Evan (named for co-writer Evan Goldberg and played by Michael Cera) is thinner, taller and more presentable, but equally keen to get a little experience in the saddle before heading off for college -- Dartmouth, in his case, some unnamed lesser institution for Seth.
After some preliminaries designed to show how uncouth these guys are and how unlimited the film's grossness will be, plot mechanics are set in motion when the coolest, most composed girl in school, Jules (Emma Stone), amazes Seth by inviting him to a party at her place that night and assigns him the task of supplying the booze. Anything is possible from this point on, as Seth and Evan, accompanied by skinny ultra-dweeb Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), have one excruciating scrape after another -- getting involved in a liquor store robbery, consorting with some unsavory types at another party and ending up in the hands of two wayward cops (Rogen and Bill Hader) -- before arriving at their destination.
As funny as much of this stuff is, scripters and director Greg Mottola (in a welcome return to features a full decade after his splendid debut with "The Daytrippers") stretch too far the notion that the real fun lies in getting there. At close to two hours, "Superbad" is simply too long for the sort of picture it is; pic has some noticeable downtime, and it's all in the middle, with too many goofy shenanigans involving the cops and assorted fringe characters that come and go. You really want the boys to get to the party already and see what they get cooking with the girls.
It's worth the wait. Multiple gross-outs are served up, to be sure, but they're not what you might expect, and the aftermath bears notably lifelike doses of regret and sober reflection on the boys' silly, sometimes inexcusable behavior.
It's a hallmark of Apatow's films thus far, whatever his direct role, that stock situations and characters are endowed with extra dimensions of humanity, weakness and insecurity. "Superbad" may be more overtly comic than "Virgin" or "Knocked Up," but its darkness and thoughtfulness are still notable for a genre so thoroughly dedicated to raucous surfaces and money moments.
At once just typical teenagers and clueless fools, Seth and Evan are ingratiating leads, and Hill and Cera fit so easily together you can believe they've known each other for years; whether deliberately or not, Seth comes off as genuinely obnoxious at times and not just amusingly assertive, which adds to the realism. Stealing the film, however, is Mintz-Plasse, an unknown high schooler who calls to mind a really twerpy teenage Dustin Hoffman; the guy's totally off the wall. As the main girls in the mix, Stone and Martha MacIsaac are accessibly human and nothing like the snotty "whatever" bimbos so often seen in such fare.
Tech qualities are so grubby, one is convinced it must have been deliberate. At least at screening caught, print looked like it had been stuck in some vault since 1978, and sound mix was atrocious, with levels of ambient sound varying enormously from scene to scene but often not even existing, placing the characters' dialogue in a virtual audio vacuum.

The latest comic meteorite to hurtle forth from the galaxy of producer Judd Apatow , Superbad is about a couple of chronically unpopular best friends who, after four years stuck on the lowest rung of the high-school social ladder, find themselves invited to a legitimately cool party. Goodbye, Friday nights chugging Old Milwaukees in their parents' furnished basements; hello, getting shitfaced in the company of a few dozen of their not particularly close friends. More importantly, having completed their independent study in Internet porn, our heroes finally get the chance to put their virtual carnal knowledge to practical use. Provided, that is, they can actually get to the party.
Yes, Superbad is about one of those nightswhen you finally have the chance to prove that you're not as big of a dork as everyone thinks, only to be chased by the cops, hit by a car (twice), and nearly pulverized by the dude whose girlfriend's menstrual blood somehow ends up on your pant leg, as well as to drunkenly embarrass yourself in front of the one girl you have real feelings for. You know, one of those nights. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.
For starters: Superbad was written by Knocked Up star Seth Rogen  and co-writer Evan Goldberg , who cooked up the first draft of the script when they were in high schoolwhich helps to explain why the movie feels so knowing in every one of its clumsily averted glances and frank discussions of things like the best way to camouflage an erection. Rogen and Goldberg even named the lead characters after themselves, though a few drafts later they are equally recognizable as specimens bred in the Apatow gene poolthe sort of kids you knew in high school, or maybe were yourself, who seem a touch young for their age, who are more book smart than street smart, and who live in abject terror at the thought of going off to college with their virginity intact.
More geek than freak, chubby, motor-mouthed Seth (Jonah Hill ) perpetually brings up the rear in gym class and gets spat on by the resident senior-class bully, while gangly, soft-spoken Evan (Michael Cera )who can run like the wind but doesn't really get the point of things like sportsstands dutifully at his side, an introspective Sancho to his brash Quixote. True to form, they pine for girls who seem out of their respective leagues: Evan for nice-girl Becca (Martha MacIsaac ), whose obvious flirtations he cluelessly rebuffs; Seth for the comely Jules (Emma Stone ). Then the act of divine intervention pairs Seth and Jules in a home-economics project and results in the popular girl inviting the dork (and his dork friend) to her graduation party. But, as mentioned, getting to that hallowed place proves easier said than done. In fact, it turns into something like the Lord of the Rings of adolescent nookie moviesa calamitous, hazard-filled journey toward the fiery gates of Mount Poon.
At 19 and 23 respectively, Cera and Hill have the fully developed comic timing of seasoned prosBob Hope  and Bing Crosby  in sneakers and cargo shorts. Yet, Superbad is routinely stolen right out from under them by an 18-year-old newcomer, Christopher Mintz-Plasse , who was plucked from MySpace  obscurity to play the unapologetically dweeby third wheel, Fogell, and who embraces the part with such unbridled comic brio that the characterand his fake-ID alias, McLovinis bound for movie-comedy immortality. Following a hilariously botched attempt by our intrepid trio to buy booze using said ID, Superbad effectively splits along two parallel tracks, as Seth and Evan navigate their own circuitous route to Jules's house, while Fogell/McLovin winds up getting an unexpected lift from two police officers (played by Rogen and Saturday Night Live  's Bill Hader ) who make the Keystone Kops look like paragons of law and order.
Directed by Greg Mottola  (an alumnus, like Hill, of Apatow's short-lived TV series Undeclared ), Superbad is duly ribald and often achingly funny, brewed from the now-familiar Apatow house blend of go-for-broke slapstick and instantly quotable, potty-mouthed dialogue. ("I'm so jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby," a wistful Seth tells Evan after an encounter with his friend's amply bosomed mother.) But what sets Superbad  far apart from the American Pie  seriesindeed, what earns it a place alongside American Graffiti , Fast Times at Ridgemont High , and Dazed and Confused in that elite strata of high-school comedies destined to stand the test of timeis its sweet, soulful vulnerability, particularly as it becomes clear that the only thing Seth and Evan feel more anxious about than losing their virginity is the thought of losing each other, in the fall, when they head off to separate colleges. That naughty-but-nice approach might seem something of an Apatow cliché by now if the characters themselves didn't ring so true. Make no mistake: Superbad is a movie about getting wasted and getting laid, but it is above all an ode to the end of teenage innocence in all its wonderful, horrible splendor.
