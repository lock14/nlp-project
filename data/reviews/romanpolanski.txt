You didn't think courthouse media circuses were invented in the 1990s, with the O.J. Simpson trial, did you? A new HBO documentary reminds us of the long, unhappy intercourse between the tabloid-minded media and the justice system by dissecting the case of director Roman Polanski, who pled guilty to charges of unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977.
Called "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired," and smartly directed by Marina Zenovich, the movie is not exactly an attempt to exonerate Polanski, who fled the United States to France in 1978 after his conviction. Instead, it operates like a well-researched procedural film about how the trial was mishandled, relying heavily on frank interviews with those who were behind the closed doors as the case unfolded. The movie, tonight at 9, doesn't casually let Polanski off the hook for his behavior, so much as it expands our understanding of the facts surrounding his ultimate decision to leave town.
The cast in the film includes Polanski's now-retired defense attorney, Douglas Dalton, and Dalton's now-retired counterpart in the trial, Santa Monica Assistant District Attorney Roger Gunson, as well as Polanski's victim, Samantha Geimer, 45, who says that Polanski did not get a fair trial. The only major figure who does not talk is Superior Court Judge Laurence Rittenband, who died in 1994. As the movie breaks down the proceedings, it becomes increasingly clear that Rittenband did not successful maintain his integrity or his objectivity. A judge who apparently enjoyed his role in celebrity cases involving Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, and Cary Grant, he engaged both attorneys in the Polanski case in deceptions, he played to the media in a press conference, and he allowed public perception to affect his decision-making.
Early in "Wanted and Desired," in an old clip, we see the director saying to Mike Wallace, "I think I was very unfortunate to have a judge who misused justice." It sounds like a defensive claim, but by the end of the documentary, it seems on the mark.
Zenovich doesn't go overboard in trying to psychoanalyze Polanski, whose life has been a series of personal tragedies and artistic triumphs. There are sequences about how his childhood was destroyed by the Nazis, who put both of his parents in concentration camps, and there is some heartbreaking footage regarding the murder of his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, in 1969, and his resulting devastation. But I never felt manipulated into sympathy, so much as drawn into a greater understanding of Polanski's unusual, impish manner and the depth of his wounds. When you see the way he is mobbed and accused after his wife's murder, with intimate footage that throws you right into the anarchy of cameras and microphones, you can't help but gain a firmer grasp of the intensity of fear and mistrust.
If you go into "Wanted and Desired" with preconceptions, prepare to feel them challenged and altered, even if they are ultimately confirmed. The facts speak loudly.

 Correction Appended  The sharply argued documentary “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired” isn’t about the innocence or guilt of its title subject, who after pleading guilty in 1977 to having “unlawful sexual intercourse” with a minor flew from Los Angeles to London, never again to return to America. Neither is it about Mr. Polanski’s likability, his tragic past, morals, short stature, brilliant and bad films, the sleaze factor or your personal feelings on whether there’s anything wrong with a 43-year-old man’s having sex with a 13-year-old girl. All these elements come teasingly into view here, but really this is a movie about a very different kind of perversion.  “Wanted and Desired,” which opened on Friday without advance press screenings, was bought by HBO at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its one-week theatrical run will make it eligible for Academy Award consideration, though given that organization’s often pitiful record when it comes to nonfiction film, it seems unlikely that a movie this subtly intelligent would make its short list. That’s especially true because the director, Marina Zenovich, refuses to wag her finger at Mr. Polanski, even when presenting the sordid and grimly pathetic details of his crime, like the Champagne and partial Quaalude he furnished the 13-year-old girl and her repeated nos.  Mr. Polanski’s guilt isn’t in doubt, arguments about the age of consent notwithstanding. In March 1977, he was arrested at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and charged with raping the girl at the home of his friend, Jack Nicholson, the star of his film “Chinatown.” (Mr. Nicholson was away.) He was released on $2,500 bail and eventually indicted on six felony charges, including child molestation and sodomy. In August, after agreeing to a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegal sex with a 13-year-old girl. Her family’s lawyer, Lawrence Silver, told the judge that his clients were not seeking a prison term for Mr. Polanski, only an admission of wrongdoing and rehabilitation. By Feb. 1, 1978, Mr. Polanski had fled.  As Ms. Zenovich forcefully explains — using talking-head interviews, a wealth of archival material and generous clips from Mr. Polanski’s films, including “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Chinatown” — he had every reason to run. The story of what happened between the initial charges and his flight has been sketchily told before, including by his victim, Samantha Geimer, who in 2003 wrote a commentary for The Los Angeles Times in which she stated that she believed that he and his most recent film at the time, “The Pianist,” should be honored on their own merits. She added, “Who wouldn’t think about running when facing a 50-year sentence from a judge who was clearly more interested in his own reputation than a fair judgment or even the well-being of the victim?”  “Wanted and Desired” answers Ms. Geimer’s bombshell question with shocks of its own, notably corroborating interviews from Douglas Dalton, Mr. Polanski’s lawyer, and Roger Gunson, the assistant district attorney who led the prosecution. Together these two former opponents pin the blame for Polanski’s flight directly on the presiding judge, Laurence J. Rittenband (who stepped down in 1989 and died in 1994). Aided and abetted by an avalanche of fluidly organized visual material, the lawyers fill in the appalling details of what was effectively a second crime, one largely perpetrated by a celebrity-dazzled judge and the equally gaga news media he courted. This crime left two victims, Mr. Polanski, who was denied a fair trial, and Ms. Geimer, who was denied justice. As she wrote, “Sometimes I feel like we both got a life sentence.”  The film’s title refers to a line tossed off by one of Mr. Polanski’s friends, who notes that while the director remains wanted in the United States he continues to be desired in Europe. That’s not fully true, of course: his autobiographically inflected Holocaust drama “The Pianist” received several Academy Awards, including best director, amid much love and acclamation. But it does get at the strong, curiously divisive reactions he has long inspired, reactions that have as much to do with the disturbing power of his best work as his own history as a victim and a survivor. Mr. Polanski survived the Holocaust and the murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, in 1969 by followers of Charles Manson. It was the American legal system that almost did him in.

Correction: April 02, 2008  A film review on Monday about “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired” misstated the date in 1977 that Mr. Polanski was arrested in California and charged with raping a 13-year-old girl. It was March 11, not March 13. 

The toxic influence of the media and the double-edged allure of celebrity form the pervasive themes of "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired," a mesmerizing portrait of the director as acclaimed artist and tortured human being. But documaker Marina Zenovich goes even deeper in her thoroughly researched account of the notorious 1977 statutory rape case, pulling auds into the dense thicket of legal issues and sordid behavior -- not all of it Polanski's -- that led the director to flee to Europe. Picked up by HBO and the Weinstein Co., searing pic will be wanted and desired by discriminating auds, fests and broadcasters worldwide.
On Feb. 1, 1978, Polanski boarded a plane from Los Angeles to France (where he remains to this day), eluding sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. Pic recounts the widely reported details of that 1977 episode, in which a magazine photo shoot at Jack Nicholson's home on Mulholland Drive ended with Polanski allegedly administering champagne and quaaludes to 13-year-old Samantha Gailey before assaulting her.
Beautifully structured pic lays out the concrete facts with methodical text scrolls, but complicates the viewer's perception of the case with chilling, contrasting snippets of testimony from Polanski and Gailey herself. And without lightening Polanski's burden of responsibility, Zenovich shows how a rabid press corps and an unfathomably corrupt judge conspired to thwart the case's proper outcome.
Judge Laurence J. Rittenband (he died in 1993) is one of the few figures involved with the case not interviewed here and, unsurprisingly, emerges as the true villain of the piece. He comes across as a self-aggrandizing sleaze who relished high-profile celebrity cases but cared more about his reputation than the interests of justice. It's a perception that might seem caricaturish were it not substantiated by the film's two most measured and authoritative voices: Roger Gunson, the assistant D.A. who prosecuted the case, and Polanski's attorney, Douglas Dalton.
Gunson, Dalton, a host of court reporters and legal experts, and Gailey herself (now Samantha Geimer) absorbingly recount how concern for the girl -- and reluctance to put her on the stand -- led to a plea bargain. Docu might have been stronger with a voice or two questioning the morality of this decision, which reduced Polanski's six counts to the lesser unlawful-sex charge and would have resulted in probation. But Zenovich's film trusts auds to be appropriately repulsed by Polanski's actions, alerting them instead to the less juicy but no less heinous crime -- the reckless abuse of power -- committed in the proceedings.
At great length, pic details how Rittenband intended a much harsher sentence, egged on by an ill-timed photo of a seemingly unrepentant Polanski out on the town. At every step, the film portrays the news media as an insidious presence, locked with Rittenband in a relationship of mutual manipulation. (In a similar vein, considerable screen time is devoted to the 1969 murder of Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, to which many reporters responded with slanderous suggestions of Polanski's culpability.)
The legal maneuvers and talking heads alone (Geimer, who publicly forgave Polanski in 1997, is among the most eloquent and rational) would have furnished a meaty documentary, but "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" is above all a film fascinated by its subject and his paradoxes. Polanski was celebrated early on for his artistry, success and irresistible charm, yet also viewed by some as a "malignant, twisted dwarf" whose sensual appetites and unapologetic taste for young women add troubling layers to a dense psychological portrait.
Zenovich cleverly if somewhat glibly underscores pic's psychological insights with clips from the director's films, sampling from "Repulsion," "Knife in the Water," "Chinatown," "The Tenant" and, most prominently, "Rosemary's Baby," whose own horrific rape scene and haunting lullaby (a remix of which plays over the end credits) here convey a sense of innocence violated. Best use of all, however, is of his 1961 black-and-white short film "The Fat and the Lean," which wittily sums up the relationship between Rittenband and Polanski.
Pic reps a treasure trove of archival material from the '60s and '70s, with Tate's filmed appearances providing piercing moments. Other tech credits, notably Mark Degli Antoni's score, are top-of-the-line.

Along its winding road to crucifying the American judiciary, Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired which aired to mostly warm reviews on HBO  a month before its theatrical releasegrinds some blunt axes, makes some dizzying leaps to judgment, and does a lot of silly editing with movie clips. Focusing on the Chinatown  directors 1977 Santa Monica  rape trial and his unscheduled bolt for Europe before sentencing, Marina Zenovichs lively, exasperating documentary is loaded with testimony from cops, lawyers, and lots of Polanski pals, and book-ended by sawn-off clips from an interview the director submitted to with the British writer Clive James .
I say submitted to because Polanski has made no secret of his hatred for the media, which, as he sees it, has pilloried him for his free-wheeling sex life, beginning with the 1969 murder of his wife, Sharon Tate , and continuing after his trial for sodomizing 13-year-old Samantha Gailey . Ive no doubt that James, a public intellectual and film buff asked Polanski all kinds of smart questions, but the one that opens the movie is Do you like little girls? Without skipping a beat, Polanski replies, I like young women  [my emphasis]. I think most men do.
By the look of it, the interview was conducted sometime in the 1980s either in Paris, where Polanski lives, or somewhere in Europe that doesnt have an extradition agreement with the United States. Zenovich expresses a properly ambivalent sympathy for Polanski, and she isnt shy about drawing unfavorable comparisons between American sexual prissiness and the broader mind of Europe. Nor does she waste much energy trying to make connections between Polanskis life and work, unless you count a few awkwardly inserted clips from Chinatown, Repulsion , and Knife in the Water  that could have been chosen by the Mormon prosecutor who, having boned up for the trial by catching a Polanski retrospective, brightly summarizes the directors oeuvre for Zenovich as corruption meeting innocence over water.
Zenovich uses the trial and its aftermath to deliver a sucker punch to the U.S. justice system, which, she implies, screwed over Polanski with more far-reaching consequences than his screwing of Gailey, now a wholesome-looking mother of three who appears on camera to forgive her aggressor. And its here that Zenovichs zeal exceeds her grasp with a blow-by-blow demolition of presiding Judge Laurence J. Rittenband , which includes blistering testimony from the lawyers for the defense and the prosecution who banded together in a successful petition to have him removed from the case when he tried to commit Polanski to prison for a second round of psychiatric evaluation after hed been cleared in the first. Fair enough. Rittenband was known as a celebrity whore who was far too cozy with the media. He was also a party animal who dated much younger women  meaning, 20-year-old women well over the age of consent.
Like Polanski, Zenovich cruises over that distinction to insinuate that the judge was at best a hypocrite, at worst not competent to preside over the trial. She wheels in a close Polanski friend to testify that the director is incapable of rape, and some older women who wonder why Gaileys mother brought her to meet him in the first place. All of which is beside the point that it is illegal and morally outrageous to take a 13-year-old girl, whether shes a nun or a nymphomaniac, to a strange house, feed her Quaaludes  and sodomize her. That, and not prudery or a predatory press, is why Polanski is wanted in America, and would be in Europe if the crime had occurred there.
At the end of Wanted and Desired , Polanski plaintively asks Clive James, Do you think theres something more to my life than my relations with young women? Its possible that his career was damaged, as the movie implies, by the trial and its fallout, though in fact he continued to work with Hollywood  producers from exile. Just as plausibly, this masterful director, who never made good on the promise of Knife in the Water  and Chinatown , simply peaked early and then applied his fabled technical expertise to a procession of potboilers (even The Pianist , which won him an Oscar in absentia, was more faithful adaptation than art), and finally burned out on high living.
In Zenovichs movie, Polanski comes off as a self-styled victim and a liar who pleaded innocent, changed his plea to guilty of unlawful sex with a minor, then ran away without telling his lawyers. According to many who have worked with him and a clear-eyed, entertaining new biography by Christopher Sandford  (to be published in September), he is also a gifted artist and a generous, intelligent, charming man whose charisma has won him undying loyalty from friends, fellow filmmakers  and, perhaps, a free pass from the critics who love this movie.
