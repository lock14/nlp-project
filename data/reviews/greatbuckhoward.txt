Disillusioned with law school, Troy Gabel (Colin Hanks) drops out to become a writer but takes a paying job as the assistant to and road manager for the has-been mentalist Buck Howard (Malkovich). Thus begins this young man's coming-of-age story, a pale journey made even more flimsy when compared with the intriguing life history of his idiosyncratic employer. Malkovich's performance in this small film is one of controlled eccentricity, and the character's offbeat charm and ineffable oddness add another triumph to the actor's pantheon of weirdos. An affected fop and consummate showman, Buck's biggest claim to fame is that he appeared 61 times on The Tonight Show
 � "with Johnny Carson," he always hastens to add. Of course that also means it's been a couple of decades since he was last on television, so his audience now is generally made up of old-timers and pushovers for his particular blend of cheesy theatrics and wondrous stunts. Troy, too, succumbs to the mystery of his act, which more than makes up for Buck's frequent displays of bad temper and vain delusions of grandeur. The greatest problem with The Great Buck Howard
 is that writer/director McGinly shapes the story with young Troy as the protagonist, when the really interesting character is the one for whom the movie is named. Unfortunately, Malkovich's commanding performance also accentuates the limits of young Hanks' acting skills. He's perfectly adequate, but as soon as his real-life father, Tom Hanks, appears onscreen in a couple of unnecessary scenes as Troy's fictional father (ironically trying to dissuade him from a life in show business), the gale force of the senior Hanks clips the sails of the younger actor's leading-man status. Troy's voiceover narration recurringly interrupts the film's enjoyment while it points out the life lessons he learns along the way, as though we'd be unable to discern them on our own. Despite the drawbacks, however, The Great Buck Howard
 puts on an unforgettable show.

Sean McGinly's "The Great Buck Howard" isn't actually about the magician of the title  - who prefers the term mentalist, by the way. It's about Troy Gable (Colin Hanks), the ex-law student who takes a job as the personal assistant to Buck Howard (John Malkovich), a kind of prissy, verbally abusive, tantrum-prone Amazing Kreskin whose best days appear to be behind him. It's another coming-of-age story about a young man who can't figure himself out.
The movie follows Troy and Buck on the road (Bakersfield, Calif., Akron, Ohio, somewhere in Wisconsin), repeating variations of the same routines and backstage arguments before settling in for a long stint in Cincinnati, where the movie coughs up some mockery of Midwesterners: They can't host to Buck's satisfaction. They can't do proper CPR. They misspell names on the marquee. Debra Monk and Steve Zahn, who play guides to the pair, are the movie's chief targets of condescension, a dim, bumbling, talkative sister and brother  - Buck prefers the term hayseed, by the way.
Showbiz competence flies in from Los Angeles, represented by Valerie (Emily Blunt), a snooty publicist whose disdain for Cincinnati seems commensurate with her obligatory attraction to Troy. Forget this washed-up mentalist, she basically tells Troy. She's got real showbiz connections.
From the standpoint of entertainment, the only excuse for watching the movie make Troy's dreams come true is Malkovich, who smiles and grins as much as I can recall him ever doing. He finds the juncture where his comedic intensity meets Philip Seymour Hoffman's. Monk, Zahn, and Tom Hanks, who plays Troy's dad (he's Colin's dad, too), also have some moments. But the movie seems designed to demonstrate that McGinly can direct very good actors, whether or not he has the imagination to give them anything interesting to do.
"Buck Howard" also suggests the work of someone who has never left Hollywood to go farther than the Sundance Film Festival. The quirks are from a handbook (a law-school drop out, mentalism). Not enough feels connected to anything that wasn't gleaned from a hundred so-so independent movies before it. Even the music feels designed to inform the right people that McGinly knows what's what. (Inexplicably, the movie ends with a clip of the earnest band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah mewling away.)
If it's cable dramas and music videos McGinly wants to make, this movie will probably keep him busy. But he seems too young to be working with so little risk, verve, style, youth, or creative purpose. This is an old man's movie, without an old man's experience. Despite McGinly's stated affection for Kreskin (the movie ends with a written appreciation of him), there's nothing personal about it. It's the movie equivalent of handing us a business card.

The Great Buck Howard  gives the loopy John Malkovich the showcase he deserves, and not just because he gets to fly as high, and flaky, as he likes. It's also because writer-director Sean McGinley has grounded Malkovich, allowing him to create a character with as much fascination as folly. His Buck Howard, a loving,   fictionalized version of the Amazing Kreskin, is a former superstar of ''mentalism'' who is now a joke with a rubber handshake, a relic babbling on about his 61 appearances on  The Tonight Show . He performs to half-full theaters in places like Bakersfield, Calif.   (''I love this town!'' he crows). Yet his act is still amazing. Buck reads people's minds, with a fusion of cheesiness and wonder. Or is it all a great big fraud? That's the tease at the heart of the movie, which traces his brief, shining moment of so-out-he's-in resurgence. A dryly winning Colin Hanks costars as the wide-eyed law-school dropout who becomes road manager to the doting, now apoplectic, maybe gay, lost-in-the-leisure-suit-era Buck. The Great Buck Howard  is in love with kitsch, the backwaters of showbiz, and true magic. It's   a wee charmer that left me enchanted. A–

 “The Great Buck Howard,” an agreeable show business satire with a warm heart, was inspired by the career of the Amazing Kreskin, a k a George Joseph Kresge Jr., the 1970s television mind reader who still pops up on the tube now and then. Playing Buck Howard, an entertainer with a similar career trajectory, John Malkovich exaggerates the familiar mannerisms of this self-described professional mentalist to create a barbed but affectionate portrait of a second-string trouper struggling for a comeback.  A peripatetic entertainer who boasts of having logged 61 performances on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight” show, Buck greets people with an exaggerated arm-pumping parody of Kreskin’s vigorous handshake. As interpreted by Mr. Malkovich, who is at least a decade too young for the role of a showbiz old-timer, Kreskin’s courtly geniality assumes a slightly creepy edge of self-deluding egomania.  Offstage, Buck can veer in seconds from a charmer to a nit-picking, tantrum-throwing diva. But he is less a tyrant than an eccentric. If Mr. Malkovich locates the demons inside a character who is apparently too self-absorbed to have enjoyed any kind of love life, he portrays his quest for redemption as well intentioned. Buck can exude a witheringly icy hauteur one moment and  a disorienting aura of not being entirely present the next. In front of an audience, however, he is shamelessly, happily obsequious, and the crowds eat it up.  Much of Buck’s sense of self-worth depends on his successful execution of Kreskin’s signature stunt of inviting audience members to hide the fee for his performance while he is secluded offstage. When he returns he uses his gifts — extrasensory powers, Sherlock Holmes detective skills, or whatever  they are  — to find the money. In a 2007 interview, Mr.  Kresge, now 74, boasted that he had failed only nine times in his career to locate it. Buck, however, has a perfect record.  His difficulty in sniffing out the money at a Las Vegas lounge where he is making his big-time comeback  is the movie’s dramatic turning point.  Written and directed by Sean McGinly, “The Great Buck Howard” also stars Colin Hanks as Troy Gable, a law-school dropout and aspiring writer who impulsively takes a job as Buck’s road manager. As Troy, Mr. Hanks (the son of Tom, who is a producer of the movie and appears in two scenes as Troy’s sternly disapproving father) narrates the story while following Buck from city to city,  watching him perform a shopworn potpourri of magic tricks and hypnosis for half-full houses. Mr. Hanks exudes the same easygoing likability as his father, without the magnetic star quality.  Buck selects Cincinnati, a stronghold of fan support, as the place to recapture show business glory (and perhaps an invitation to appear on Jay Leno’s “Tonight Show”) with an exhibition of mass hypnosis. While in Cincinnati, Troy has a fling with a hard-boiled publicist (Emily Blunt) who stands up to Buck when he turns petulant.  Ms. Blunt, who has the officious, mechanical airs of a contemporary publicist down pat, lends the movie pungent comic undertones, as do Debra Monk and Steve Zahn as a pair of foolishly besotted Buck Howard fans who insist on shepherding their idol around the city.  In the end “The Great Buck Howard,” despite its many satirical thrusts, insists on being nice. The film might be described as “The King of Comedy” with its fangs removed; it leaves a tiny but discernible afterglow.  “The Great Buck Howard” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some language including suggestive remarks and a drug reference.

A smoothly turned-out entertainment centered around an Amazing Kreskin-style mentalist comes down with an unfortunate case of the warm-and-fuzzies in "The Great Buck Howard." Behind-the-curtains comedy reps an amusing showcase for John Malkovich's diva-like theatrics in the title role, but writer-director Sean McGinly's decision to frame the story as a relationship movie, as Buck's impressionable young assistant deals with some very familiar life issues, tilts the comic seesaw toward sentiment over satire. Backed by Tom Hanks' producing cachet, this earnest, accessible picture could have wide, multigenerational audience appeal but will require careful handling to work any B.O. magic.
Of course, the Great Buck Howard (Malkovich) is no magician -- he's a mentalist, and he performs effects, not tricks. Famous for having appeared on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" 61 times (a fact he brings up repeatedly), Buck represents a fading tradition of old-fashioned stage performers: He now travels to small cities across the country, performing his act for mostly old ladies at backwater auditoriums.
Along for the ride is Buck's new assistant, Troy (Colin Hanks, son of Tom), a law-school dropout looking for some life experience. He gets more than his fair share, thanks to his boss' irrational demands, unpredictable fits of temper and deluded sense of his own importance. Yet Troy is also genuinely charmed by Buck and his act, which, though corny and quaint (hypnotism, guessing secret numbers, finding money hidden in the audience), never quite loses its how-did-he-do-that sense of wonder.
Pic builds a nice head of comic steam early on, carried along by McGinly's sprightly pacing and tart dialogue (most of it delivered by Malkovich with exquisite condescension), before settling down in Cincinnati, where Buck is preparing his big comeback. Naturally, he must weather all manner of setbacks and insults -- indifferent press coverage; a withering magazine piece; tacky, eager-to-please locals (Debra Monk, Steve Zahn) -- and refuses to accept that he's become an obsolete "fossil," in the words of his previous assistant (Adam Scott, who escapes too early).
Joining the team in Cincinnati -- and giving the film another jolt of energy -- is whip-smart publicist Valerie (Emily Blunt), who promptly jumps Troy's bones and alone refuses to massage Buck's fragile ego. Blunt's presence, always welcome, underscores pic's passing resemblance to "The Devil Wears Prada," which was similarly predicated on the relationship between a monstrous tyrant and a much-put-upon young aide. Here, however, the aide is so forgiving, such a willing doormat, that Colin Hanks, though pleasant enough to watch, can't make Troy a compelling foil opposite Malkovich's delicious scene-stealing antics.
"The Great Buck Howard" at once mocks and celebrates a certain type of old-school showman who's chronically incapable of adapting to today's talkshow circuits and demo-targeting focus groups, and it clearly wants to sweep auds up in a wave of nostalgia for this dying breed. Pic succeeds to an impressive degree, but there are moments when McGinly pushes his luck and yanks the viewer's heartstrings: We're told Troy is an aspiring writer, but if the gush of sentimental voiceover that closes the pic is any indication, he may not yet have found his true vocation.
Tom Hanks makes two brief, effective appearances as Troy's sternly disapproving dad (of course), and his involvement with the production likely had something to do with pic's parade of cameos from the likes of Jon Stewart, Martha Stewart, Regis Philbin, Kelly Ripa, Tom Arnold and, in an amusing in-joke, George Takei of "Star Trek" fame.
Pic is well-crafted from top to bottom, balancing its glossy Hollywood sheen with the mostly nondescript locales where Buck takes his act. Zippy opening-credits sequence smartly whets the viewer's appetite for more.


No one does raging unlovability quite like John Malkovich , who's a total gas when he drops the bombast that often bogs down his more serious roles. Not that Buck Howard , the once-great mentalist now playing to half-empty theaters in Hicksville , lacks for pathos-or for glory. His lounge act is excruciating, his stand-up terrible, but his one gift, locating his paycheck in the clothing of an audience member, has never let him down-until now, it goes without saying. Based on a magician known to writer-director Sean McGinly , this loudly dressed, insecure blowhard with a pumping handshake and severe anger management problems may also be an ambivalent tribute to Jerry Lewis . Either way, Malkovich swallows up the screen, and when he's out of frame, the movie feels slack and slow. Hobbled by lack of definition, Buck's assistant and McGinly's alter ego, Troy  (Colin Hanks ), a law school dropout with dreams of writing, comes across as pallid and passionless, while the talents of Emily Blunt  as a go-getting publicist and Steve Zahn  as a small-town fan go wretchedly to waste. But though it laments our decaying faith in magic and mystery, The Great Buck Howard  is rarely mawkish. McGinly sheds no tears for this clown, and he makes a beguiling case for following your bliss all the way to Bakersfield , if that's where it lies.
