Last month�s Chronicle
 cover featuring the latest wave of Austin filmmakers limited itself to those with movies playing at SXSW, but any truly representative roll call of Austin�s newest generation would put Kyle Henry front and center. In fact, he�s been around a while � as a film programmer, a documentarian (American Cowboy, University Inc.)
, and an editor (Manito)
. But Room
, which played at Cannes and Sundance last year and netted two Independent Spirit Awards nominations this year, marks new territory for Henry: his narrative feature debut. �Narrative� might be a misleading term, however, as Room
 bucks conventional storytelling models. The title, the tidiest thing about Room
, refers to the site-specific hallucinations of a Houston-based woman named Julia (Williams). Already buckling under the strain of two jobs, a stressful home life, and debilitating migraines, Julia can now add �visions� to her laundry list of ailments. At the supermarket, in the living room � wherever, it seems � her perspective starts to go staticky, as if her reception�s going out, and she becomes bombarded by scattershot images of a warehouse-type room until she finally blacks out. When one of these episodes results in a car crash outside Houston�s George Bush International Airport (which may or may not be a sign), Julia flees her family for New York, on a sort of vision quest to decode just what the hell�s going on up in her alarmingly addled head. That quest takes her to odd places, like a meditation group and a tarot card reader. Julia spins on a dime if she senses something is a sign, and one of the haunting poignancies of the film is how hungry she, and we, are for anything remotely resembling a sign. And they�re seemingly everywhere, especially in the white noise of traffic reports and graffiti art and news dispatches from Iraq that blankets the film. (Note to self: If one suffers from sensitivity to the blaring pop-culture parade, then New York, and especially Times Square, may not be the smartest place to sojourn.) Justin Hennard and Chris Keyland�s sound design � dense, jittery, and spectacularly creepy � is one of the chief pleasures of the piece, and that soundscape, working in concert with PJ Raval�s terrific camerawork, create a constant, ever-upticking state of anxiety. There�s no rest for the weary � or the panic-attack-prone � here, and if you need further convincing, it�s scrawled all over Williams� face. Dominating nearly every frame and communicating largely through her body language (watch her walk � it�s a revelation), Williams delivers an astonishing, open-faced performance, one that demands sympathy while steadfastly refusing accessibility. That inaccessibility � at least in broad strokes � extends to the whole film, which wears the skin of a psychological thriller, but plays out as something far darker, weirder, and more distancing. It�s easy to call Room
 an avant-garde film, but I think more significantly it�s an American
 film, in its paranoia and confusion, cultural branding and search for solace, and in a whole host of other ways I haven�t yet � and maybe never will � unpack. Near the end of the film, as Julia�s hallucinations grow more frenzied, I made a note: �There better be a big fucking payoff.� Guess what? There isn�t one. But that note � borne equally out of frustrated genre expectations and nerves nearly frayed by the film�s expert ratcheting of tension � speaks to Henry�s ability to burrow in and, well, frankly, to bother. For a film about looking for a sign, looking for solace, Room
 quite brazenly offers neither. It isn�t an easy film, but the world�s already got plenty of easy and easily digestible films. Nervy and confounding pictures, however, we could use more of. See

  for an interview with Kyle Henry and Cindi Williams.)


 The towers have fallen, the war is on, God is dead, and it's Christmas in Texas. Julia (Cyndi Williams) works the late shift at Paradise Bingo. Racked by migraines and nightmares, she comes home to a short-tempered husband, a daughter who sneaks off at night, terror on the television and an insidious ambient hum. Visions of a large, empty loft creep into her consciousness; she collapses in a supermarket, crashes her car.  And then one morning she wakes up, robs a safe and boards a plane at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Destination: New York City. Motivation: to escape from the House of Anxiety and seek solace — or annihilation — in the "Room."  Written and directed by Kyle Henry, "Room" is an existential horror film, a parable of the war against terror being waged in Julia's psyche. A small-scale indie with bountiful ambitions, this resourceful debut ballasts a great deal of conceptual idiosyncrasy (simmering experimental flourishes erupt in a full-blown psychedelic set piece) with strict observations of personality, behavior and the textures of space.  Ms. Williams's intense, single-minded performance is neatly proportioned to the complex location shooting, which deftly ranges from stagnant Houston suburbs to the plasma-screen apocalypse of Times Square to the labyrinthine mysteries of Brooklyn lofts.
Asparse, enigmatic tale of a woman's ultimately mysterious quest, Kyle Henry 's Room  is one of those rare American indies that confidently and successfully propose their own narrative logic, drawing viewers into a mental puzzle that may not contain a single clear solution. Miserable middle-aged Julia (Cyndi Williams ), a Texas mom suffering through her shit job at a bingo parlor, suddenly begins experiencing migraines and blackouts, eventually crashing her car during one episode. Still stunned and bloody, she boards a plane for New York on impulse at George Bush Intercontinental Airport . Once there, she sets off in search of the industrial-looking room that has begun to appear to her through invasive images flooding her consciousness with a staticky pirate-transmission buzz. (Henry's background in experimental filmmaking suggests the similarities between Julia's inner visions and Michael Snow 's visionary classic Wavelength  aren't accidental.) As in Kelly Reichardt 's Old Joy  or Jennifer Reeves 's The Time We Killed , snatches of media broadcasts from recent political events act as an outward sign of Julia's inner barometrics. And like those two films, Room  uses the psychic vagaries of individuals to serve as metaphors for a nation that has itself gone dangerously adrift with no certain goal in sight.
