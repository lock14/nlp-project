Marla Olmstead, an artist in upstate Binghamton, New York, paints big, complex, color-splashed, assertive abstract pictures that sell for tens of thousands of dollars to smitten collectors. She is also a child. Marla is all of 7 years old now, and was even younger three years ago when her media-made fame as a prodigy certified by the Today  show and Good Morning America  morphed into media-made controversy about the authenticity of her work. Was the shy, picture-cute artist producing the work herself? (A 60 Minutes  report suggested otherwise.) Was her father, an art hobbyist, assisting his daughter for his own gain and for the glamour of limos and gallery openings? Is Marla a genius or a fraud  and with abstract art, who can tell one extreme from the other?
My Kid Could Paint That  doesn't provide definitive answers. But absence of resolution only adds to the resonance of this astute documentary, a personal work of nonfiction as layered with eye-of-the-beholder meaning as Marla's canvases. Amir Bar-Lev's engrossing film is as much about the stubborn ambiguities of art, truth, meaning, and relationships as it is about the authenticity of the Olmstead oeuvre. Bar-Lev likes his attractive subjects, and wants to believe them as much as they want him to be their vindicator. (After 60 Minutes , sales fell off.) He wants to understand the cultural value placed on prodigies, and to analyze the particular ability of abstract art to bug the hell out of skeptics. (New York Times  art critic Michael Kimmelman provides eloquent onscreen commentary on that front.)
And, of course, Bar-Lev wants to make his own art, too  this movie which is in turn predicated on the relationship of trust he first established with his subjects. What if that relationship is changed by doubt? How complicit is he, the journalist, in affecting the reputation and future of a little girl? The storyteller puts himself into the story and acknowledges his part in the drama with the kind of spiky authorial self-awareness made famous by New Yorker  writer Janet Malcolm. And by the way, the approach also makes for a better story.

 Just about everyone who has been the parent of a young child has a priceless collection of masterpieces: treasured drawings and paintings  taped to a closet door, stuck to the refrigerator with magnets or rolled up in a box somewhere in the basement. The value of these artifacts is personal and sentimental,  but they can also have an aesthetic power that goes beyond parental pride. The untaught sense of color and composition that children seem naturally to possess sometimes yields extraordinary results, and the combination of instinct and accident that governs their creative activity can  produce astonishing works of art.  Except that these magical finger-paint daubings and crayon scribblings aren’t really works of art in any coherent sense of the term, but rather the vital byproducts of play, part of the cognitive and sensory awakening that is the grand, universal vocation of childhood. The urge to commodify and display them is, primarily, an adult expression of appreciation and nostalgia. We love our children, and we long for the children we used to be. These feelings are, for the most part, perfectly benign. “My Kid Could Paint That,” a new documentary directed by Amir Bar-Lev, is troubling because it explores a case in which the grown-up fascination with a child’s art appears to have spun out of control.  The child is Marla Olmstead, who was born in 2000 and who found herself, a few years ago, at the center of a minor media frenzy. As far as anyone can tell, it all started innocently enough. Marla’s father, Mark, a factory manager in Binghamton, N.Y., was also an amateur painter who set his daughter up with brushes and canvases while she was still in diapers. On a whim, Mark and his wife, Laura, a dental assistant, exhibited some of Marla’s paintings in a friend’s coffee shop, where patrons expressed interest in buying them. A show at a Binghamton gallery owned by Anthony Brunelli followed, and a column in the local newspaper begat an article in this one. Soon Marla and her family were being interviewed on national television, and her paintings were fetching five-figure prices.  Mr. Bar-Lev assiduously traces Marla’s rise to fame, and also chronicles the backlash that followed when a “60 Minutes” report suggested that her father may have been helping her paint, or even presenting his work as hers. As “My Kid Could Paint That” unfolds, its emphasis shifts. A story that had seemed to raise philosophical questions about the nature of art after modernism — some of them posed by Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic for The New York Times — evolves into a queasy study of the culture of celebrity.  It is also an intimate, sometimes unsettling family drama. At the center is not really Marla, who has a sweet smile and a shy, delicate demeanor, but rather her parents. Throughout the film, Laura voices her apprehensions about subjecting Marla to so much public attention at so young an age. When asked if she’s having fun riding in limousines or appearing on talk shows, Laura tends to say no, and a quiet tension between her and her husband is evident in many scenes. Mark is more enthusiastic about Marla’s fame, so much so that his promotion of her career, like Mr. Brunelli’s, begins to seem opportunistic, even exploitative.  But both men are also caught up in a process beyond their control, trying to ride the beast of media celebrity without getting eaten by it. Elizabeth Cohen, the journalist at The Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin who wrote the first article about Marla, serves as the film’s resident media critic and also as its (guilty) conscience, worrying about the corrupting, distorting effects of Marla’s success. There is something frightening about the breathless, overwrought excitement that greeted the first news of the child’s  paintings, and also about the ugly rage that followed the “60 Minutes” report. Ms. Cohen sensibly asks whether it might have been better for everyone if the Olmsteads had been left alone.  She quite properly directs this question — one that’s also clearly on Laura Olmstead’s mind — at Mr. Bar-Lev, who spends a bit of time worrying about his own motives and expressing ambivalence about his film. Mr. Kimmelman tells him, “Your documentary on some level is going to be a lie,” meaning that it will be a necessarily partial and constructed representation of the truth.  Of course. But there is, I think, a deeper dishonesty in “My Kid Could Paint That,” a bad faith that lies precisely in Mr. Bar-Lev’s studied displays of doubt and unease. Acknowledging that he as much as anyone else is guilty of exploiting Marla is an exemplary postmodern move, but it hardly lets him off the hook. He has made an excellent documentary, but it would have been better if he had not made it at all.    “My Kid Could Paint That” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some adult language.

The popular human-interest story of a child prodigy becomes an engrossing meditation on truth, media exploitation and the value of art in "My Kid Could Paint That." Docu by Amir Bar-Lev ("Fighter") is a sometimes uncomfortably intimate look at Marla Olmstead, an upstate N.Y. tot who at age 4 won international attention as a "pint-sized Pollock" making remarkably precocious abstract paintings -- only to be "debunked" on the same scale months later when doubts were cast on the phenom. Sony Classics' Sundance purchase should bring her yet more renown as a fascinating subject handled with intelligently provocative care. 
The photogenic Olmsteads seem a nice, hardworking, unremarkable family -- mom Laura works as a dental assistant, dad Mark on the Frito-Lay factory nightshift. Marla and equally adorable younger brother Zane appear well-adjusted.
Yet not long after she turned 2, Marla insisted on joining daddy in his hobby as an amateur painter; the attractive, oddly sophisticated-looking results were hung in the family home. Eventually, they attracted attention from a friend who whimsically suggested they be hung in his coffee shop. Soon the Olmsteads were getting actual purchase offers. Then another family friend, professional artist Anthony Brunelli, proposed a mid-2004 formal show at his gallery.
A local newspaper story (by Elizabeth Cohen, a reporter on child/family issues who comments throughout pic) led to one in the New York Times -- and the floodgates broke. Marla became the novelty story du jour in every magazine, on every TV show.
Collectors grew infatuated with her work (pricing as high as $25,000 per canvas), while art critics debated its worth, for the most part quite favorably.
Indeed, the vividly colored, often complex oils are astonishingly skilled, let alone for someone of Marla's age. Was it even possible for a 4-year-old to operate at this level? A brief montage of other child prodigies (mostly classical musicians, though not excluding Shirley Temple) limns the longtime public fascination with such prodigies.
"60 Minutes" took that question seriously, stationing a surveillance camera (with parental consent) to observe Marla making one of her pictures. What they aired suggested Mark heavily directed her (he claimed it was an anomalous instance), and in any case, the canvas that resulted looked markedly less polished than her previous works -- more like the painting of a precocious but unremarkable 4-year-old.
To the Olmsteads' horror, the same outlets that had marveled over Marla's gift now spread the word that she was probably a fake. The family insisted Mark didn't collaborate on (let alone paint) the art in any way. Nonetheless, sales froze. A second video of Marla making a painting start-to-finish was made, winning her (and parents) a degree of vindication. But that piece, too, struck some -- including the filmmaker -- as suspiciously "less polished."
Bar-Lev's own doubts become a troubling focal point in film's last laps, as he struggles with the "documentary gold" of possibly exposing a scam versus the genuine affection he's developed for the seemingly ultra-sincere Olmsteads over a year's time. He is, finally, unable to decide what really happened -- and his ambivalence particularly pains Laura.
There's also room in the pic for an intriguing discussion of the public's hostility toward abstract art, which because it isn't clearly representational and can resemble the freeform primitive art children make, has often been dismissed with the pic's titular phrase. N.Y. Times critic Michael Kimmelman comments insightfully about this and related issues throughout.
On a human-drama level, the contrast between Laura's concern that her kids experience too much too soon and Mark's over-eagerness to grab every opportunity for exposure grows compelling. (Still, both parents do seem terribly nice.) And art dealer Brunelli, who changes attitude overnight when bad news hits, becomes an intriguingly less-than-sympathetic figure.
One of the few competition docs at Sundance this year (alongside "Zoo") that's as striking in its craftsmanship as in potent subject matter, "My Kid" has been put together with imagination and skill.

An irresistible subject for a documentary: The charming celebrity of Marla Olmstead , an artist from upstate New York  whose talent for impossibly confident abstractions triggered a media frenzy and five-figure price tags. Unveiled at a local coffee shop, Marla's middling AbEx doodles might not have inspired more than a glance at the milk-and-sugar station were it not for the astonishing revelation that their maker was all of four years old. Supposedly.
An unexpected development: Growing suspicions that Mark Olmstead , Marla's father and an amateur painter himself, may have lent more than encouraging words to his daughter's endeavor. Dazzled by the media attention (and, one presumes, the money), he was stumped by the inevitable backlash, unable to offer convincing proof of his daughter's sole authorship.
An inevitable talking head: "There's this large idea out there that abstract art and modern art in general has no standards, no truths," says Michael Kimmelman , chief art critic of The  New York Times  and running commentator on the cultural implications of the Marla mystery in My Kid Could Paint That . "That if a child could do it, it pulls the veil off this con game."
What began as a human-interest story for filmmaker Amir Bar-Lev  led down stranger paths than the Duchampian conundrums of modern art. The Olmsteads, desiring an ally to tell their side of the story, granted Bar-Lev intimate access to their household, and My Kid Could Paint  That  is foremost a study in a most unusual and unsettling family dynamic. Mark's eagerness to exploit Marla's fame is poised against his wife Laura's reluctance and intuition that theirs is a situation bound to get out of control. Meanwhile, little Marla bears no sign of distress over her extraordinary circumstances, making her innocent poise all the more poignant.
Confronted with increasing media scrutiny and skepticism, Mark produces a DVD purporting to record the start-to-finish creation of a Marla masterpiece. Bar-Lev counters with altogether more persuasive evidence to the contrary via split-screen comparison of canvasses. Are Mark and Laura lying? If My Kid Could Paint  That  is the record of a con, its artists are supremely confident practitioners. Is Marla, as the parents claim, simply too shy on camera to work in her true style? Evidence points to some level of assistance, but no conclusions are drawn. "Your documentary will be a lie," Kimmelman says to the camera, speaking to larger questions of authenticity raised by Bar-Lev; "it's how you decided to tell a particular story."
