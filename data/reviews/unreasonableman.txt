 Early in the documentary “An Unreasonable Man,” it is noted that Ralph Nader is more likely to be remembered for his 2000 presidential campaign than for the decades of advocacy that preceded it. And the movie, an admiring but hardly uncritical portrait of Mr. Nader, confirms this suspicion by devoting nearly half of its more than two-hour running time to the 2000 election and its aftermath.  That event seems at once irrelevant and urgent, lost in the mists of pre-9/11 history and painfully topical. Certainly the passage of time has not cooled tempers or settled arguments. And so, much of the second half of “An Unreasonable Man,”  directed by Steve Skrovan and Henriette Mantel (a former associate of Mr. Nader, she is also interviewed on camera), consists of talking heads talking past one  another.  To liberal media critics like Eric Alterman and Todd Gitlin, Mr. Nader is “self-deluded,” “intellectually dishonest,” a “megalomaniac” and worse. His moral vanity, in their view (which is hardly theirs alone), cost Al Gore a decisive margin of victory over George W. Bush. Spoiling it for the Democrats, Mr. Nader’s detractors (among them some former allies) contend, was his intention all along.  This charge is disputed by members of his campaign staff, who also repeat his central claim that the Republicans and the Democrats are basically a two-headed corporate oligarchy, rather than genuinely distinct political forces.  The argument goes in circles, and while it makes for interesting, vexing viewing, it also throws the film somewhat off balance. The family quarrel on the American left that Mr. Nader’s candidacy continues to provoke threatens to overshadow the larger debates that his earlier career as a consumer advocate placed at the center of American civic life. These have to do with the power of corporations, the regulatory authority of government and the limits of the free market — issues that have hardly faded away, and that aren’t readily summed up in “Did so!”/“Did not!” back-and-forthing.  In promotional materials, “An Unreasonable Man” has the ungainly tagline “Ralph Nader: How Do You Define a Legacy?” — a question that Mr. Nader insists does not concern him in the least. While giving him and his supporters ample time to justify his run for the presidency, the filmmakers also seek to balance the historical ledger. Alongside those 97,000 contentious Florida votes, they suggest, must be reckoned the hundreds of thousands of lives saved by improvements in automobile safety, environmental protections and safeguards on consumer products, causes Mr. Nader and his colleagues championed for years.  His impact on these areas of modern life is the focus of the movie’s riveting first hour, which is as much the biography of a movement as the story of a single man. Not that there is much of a distinction: from the mid-1960s on, Mr. Nader’s cause was his life. His exposé of the “designed-in” dangers of the Chevrolet Corvair, published first in The New Republic (in articles written by James Ridgeway) and later in “Unsafe at Any Speed” were followed by Congressional hearings that brought both fame and influence. Money from a settlement with General Motors — which had hired private detectives to snoop around Mr. Nader’s personal life, something even his close associates doubt exists — became the seed for future advocacy and activism.  Mr. Nader attracted a cadre of young idealists whose approach to politics was both a product of the times and a departure from it. The point, as they saw it, was not to overthrow the system, but rather to bring it into line with its stated principles, a goal that was rational rather than romantic and pursued by means of research and reporting rather than demonstrations or direct actions.  For a while, especially during the Carter administration, Mr. Nader’s commitment to using the legal system and the apparatus of government to check the influence of corporations brought him into alliance with the Democratic Party. His subsequent entry into electoral politics is presented in the movie, persuasively enough, as a result of the fraying of this concord. Some degree of disappointment was probably inevitable. For better or for worse, the engine of democracy is compromise, and Mr. Nader is uncompromising to the very core of his being.  And “An Unreasonable Man,” a conventional collage of archival clips and retrospective interviews, works hard to do him justice. Its ideological leanings are evident and unsurprising, but more screen time for Mr. Nader’s pre-2000 (or pre-post-2000) adversaries would have made a richer film. As it is, the filmmakers and their interlocutors make much of Mr. Nader’s popularity with the American public in the 1970s, but seem unable to acknowledge that, in the next decade, much of that same public embraced Ronald Reagan, whose ascendancy is treated, with wearying predictability, as the result of elite conspiracy and public delusion.  The standoff over the 2000 presidential election is handled with a better feel for unresolved tensions and contradictions. To these must be added a curious and telling footnote. “An Unreasonable Man” was shown at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, alongside another documentary featuring Mr. Gore, Davis Guggenheim’s “Inconvenient Truth.” That movie, now contending for an Academy Award, is almost entirely about the challenges of the future. This one, for all its invocations of the progressive spirit, concerns itself mainly with the battles of the past.
It is November 7, election day in America, the year of our Lord 2000, and en route to the ballot (screen, chad dimpler, whatever) every hand miraculously freezes in mid-selection. All at once, there is a lightning-fast stroboscopic blip of the future: two planes, human rain, a shower of debris and dust; tortured prisoners heaped in a pile; flag-draped coffins. Muzzle flashes blink in the Superdome. A grinning man in a flight suit poses before a banner reading, "Mission Accomplished." A flash, a fade, the world unfreezes, and all eyes return to the ballot. Having seen what they've seen, does anyone vote for Ralph Nader ?
Infuriating, combative, infernally self-righteousand often rightthe vexing vote-splitter is the subject of An Unreasonable Man, Henriette Mantel  and Steve Skrovan 's sprawling documentary. A cornucopia of talking-head rancor, indefatigable idealism, and livid history, the film argues that the crusading activist, organizer, and working man's champion deserves a bigger place in history than as just the Grinch Who Spoiled the Election.
Like its subject, the movie leads with its chin, starting with Nader's announcement of his 2004 presidential runa move that sent liberals still smarting from 2000 (including many former supporters) scurrying for torches and pitchforks. "Thank you, Ralph, for the Iraq  War . . . thank you, Ralph, for the destruction of the Constitution," catcalls The Nation 's insufferable smarm-bucket Eric Alterman , as if the mag hadn't hailed Nader's hoisting of the Green flag early on when it was politically convenient.
Hard to believe, but the Benedict Arnold of the weather-vane bleeding-heart set was once a heroa little guy who brought Big Auto to heel, helped prevent more than 190,000 automotive deaths in 30 years, and was directly responsible for the Environmental Protection Agency , OSHA , the Freedom of Information Act , and other vital public safeguards. The question An Unreasonable Man  addresses is whyas in, why didn't Nader the public servant just hand over his votes to Al Gore  or John Kerry , and concede that a lesser evil is still better than a greater one?
The answer the movie presents is complicated: because Nader grew up amid the town-hall government of his Connecticut hometown, and came away certain that open debate and citizen engagement are the purest forms of democracy. Because Nader is convinced, rightly or wrongly, that all his missions carry a public mandate. Because Nader is one competitive, argumentative cuss. And not least of all because he couldn't stomach the candidates. "I'm a 20-year veteran of the folly of the 'least worst,' " Nader tells the filmmakers.
An Unreasonable Man  shifts from Nader's present infamy to his first public triumph: his early-1960s crusade against accident-prone design flaws in Detroit's sleek, sexy machines. When GM played hardball, hiring hookers and detectives to discredit Nader, the resulting congressional inquest and six-figure invasion-of- privacy settlement made his careerNader became the Capra-esque embodiment of the guy who fights City Hall and wins. The revelation of Mantel and Skrovan's documentary is how long he maintained that reputation, and how deeply he instilled his ideals in others.
Though plainly sympathetic, An Unreasonable Man  doesn't so much endorse as explain Nader's decision to not step aside after it was clear he had campaigned too effectively for the Democrats' comfort. (The Dems were the "meanest bunch of motherfuckers I've ever run across," observes the invaluable investigative reporter James Ridgeway .) The filmmakers give ample voice to usual-suspect critics such as Alterman and Todd Gitlin , who brand Nader a deluded megalomaniac. More affecting are the former Nader Raiders who respectfully regret their boss's refusal to back down, and find his subsequent brush-off a brutally unsentimental rejection of their shared past. Sadder still are the clips of Susan Sarandon  and Michael Moore  actively campaigning against himas if the ideals they once shared were no longer even an option.
The question remains: Knowing what they know now, do Nader supporters regret their vote? For most, almost certainlyand Gore today seems a much more progressive figure than the lump of centrist taffy who stumped in 2000. But An Unreasonable Man  reminds us why a vote for Nader mattered: It represented the unshakable belief in a better future, and in an individual's power to effect positive change. The film's title refers to George Bernard Shaw 's dictum that "all progress depends on the unreasonable man" who insists on bending the world to his will. If the film shows that few men are as unreasonable as Ralph Nader, it also shows that few have so succeeded in shaping their world: His legacy of progressive legislation will affect generations to come.
