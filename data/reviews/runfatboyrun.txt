Anyone hoping for the lean meat of the fast, furious, and riotously funny Shaun of the Dead
 or even the popcorn fancy of the lesser Hot Fuzz
 � both of which share with Fatboy
 the co-writer and star Simon Pegg � will do best to look elsewhere; this British rom com is all soft and plodgy, a by-the-numbers redemption tale that careens uncomfortably from sentimentality to stomach-turning sight gags, as in an extended and excruciating blister-popping scene. Blister is attached to the foot of said Fatboy, Dennis (Pegg). After another kind of podiatric mishap (cold feet, pregnant fianc�e, groom hightailing it away from the altar), Dennis spends the next five years getting fatter, while his lost lady love, Libby (Newton), gets even fitter; by the time Dennis realizes he made a big mistake, Libby's already attached to an American suit named Whit (Azaria), who, in addition to being the perfect boyfriend and an able provider for Libby and her son, is also an impassioned marathon runner. In one of those it's-so-crazy-it-might-work � in-a-movie moves, Dennis decides to train for a London marathon, the idea being that, at the slightest demonstration of follow-through in Dennis, Libby will come running back to the man who ran away five years prior. There are bits here and there that are genuinely funny (security guard Dennis dry-humping a lingerie-store mannequin doesn't make the cut, not by a long shot), and there are certainly worse crimes in romantic comedy than forgettableness.  But what I can't abide � along with, I suspect, countless other fans of Pegg's collaborations with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost � is how utterly unlikable Pegg is rendered here. Let's not be stingy with blame � there's enough to pass around among first-time big-screen director Schwimmer (Friends
), original scripter Michael Ian Black (The State
), and Pegg (who did the last pass and "Britishized" the screenplay, which was originally envisioned as American-set and -acted). Not an unimpressive gathering of talent, but their forces combine to produce a leading man who starts out a shit and upgrades only to a sad sack of desperation, poor sportsmanship, and projectile pus. The Board of Underappreciated Bodily Fluids in Film rejoices. The rest of us, not so much.


What can you say about a movie that features both the blinding loveliness of Thandie Newton and the sight of a man soaked in the contents of a giant foot blister? Stay home. "Run Fat Boy Run," the first movie "Friends" star David Schwimmer has directed, seems to have been packaged at the Farrelly brothers manufacturing plant. The assembly-line work actually appears to have been outsourced to London, where the movie is set.
Like the brothers' best comedies, "Fat Boy" wants to bridge the difference between the unsavory and the sweet by conflating them. Like the least of their work - last year's "Heartbreak Kid" remake comes traumatically to mind - Schwimmer's movie seems all the more inept for trying in the first place.
On the one hand, we have the story of a runaway groom, Dennis (Simon Pegg), who wants his ex-fiancee back (Newton) only after he discovers she's now dating a hedge-fund manager (Hank Azaria). (Five years ago Dennis did a hundred-yard dash away from his bride.) On the other hand, there's the sports movie that breaks out once Dennis, jealous and physically unfit, agrees to run a marathon because the new boyfriend is doing it.
The script comes from Pegg and the American comedian Michael Ian Black, and they deserve credit for stuffing a cross-country picture into a romantic comedy. But the only thing twin formulas do here is double the monotony. Now we have to wait for two dead plots to resolve themselves.
Pegg works hard throughout the whole thing, agreeing to fall down on cue and off. He's not bad, but all the slapstick, mugging, and self-deprecation he's required to do made me think fondly of his director's underappreciated work on "Friends," where Schwimmer was physically inventive and never lazy about delivering off-kilter line readings. He should be starring in this movie instead of trying to dazzle us with gratuitous crane shots and stilted crowd sequences. As for Pegg, his real talents are all almost completely verbal. His wit was put to better use in "Shaun of the Dead" (2004) and last year's "Hot Fuzz," two surprising comedies he co-wrote that failed to get the American audiences they deserved. Those films managed to mock and embrace movie genres without ever seeming as intelligent as they were.
"Run Fat Boy Run" might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement, a street fight complete with crotch punches, an apartment eviction, and a runaway child - all in about five minutes. As an obstacle course, this is mighty efficient. As comic storytelling, it's painful, not too far from being socked in the crotch.

Simon Pegg, all gopherish twee charm, takes a break from genre send-ups to play a romantic-bumbler, English-Everyman Hugh Grant type in Run Fat Boy Run . He's got what it takes, but he's saddled himself with a script (co-written by Pegg and Michael Ian Black) that Adam Sandler wouldn't have pulled out of his bottom drawer. After dumping Thandie Newton at the altar (we're supposed to have sympathy for this guy?), Pegg tries to beat her beau (Hank Azaria) in a London marathon. Director David Schwimmer bloats this slapdash concept into dim, witless overkill.

 The beleaguered man-boy Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is always running, running, running, an activity befitting the hero of the  British  comedy titled “Run, Fat Boy, Run.” In the film’s prologue he runs away from his pregnant fiancée, Libby (Thandie Newton, charming in a largely reactive role), minutes before their scheduled wedding. When we catch up with him years later, he’s a chubby security guard sprinting after a shoplifter. Soon after, Dennis decides to enter the same marathon as Libby’s rich American boyfriend, Whit,   to show Libby and his now elementary-school-age son, Jake,  that he can make plans and see them through. “You can’t even finish a sentence,” Libby says.  “Fat Boy” will never be mistaken for art. It’s “Rocky” by way of “There’s Something About Mary,”  an inspirational fantasy with guy’s-guy banter and gross-out humor (including a blister-popping scene that seems to be  this film’s answer to the hair gel bit in “Mary”). Yet it’s effective and affecting; much of its impact comes from its images of Dennis running and its conviction that there’s a difference between running toward something and running away.  Mr. Pegg — the star and co-writer of “Shaun of the Dead,” “Hot Fuzz” and “Fat Boy,” which is derived from a  script by Michael Ian Black that was originally set in America — never shies away from Dennis’s pathetic essence. Even when training for a marathon he can’t seem to stop smoking and eating junk food. But Mr. Pegg also gives us enough of a sense of Dennis’s capacity for self-transformation that his mission seems both plausible and inspiring.  Mr. Pegg is abetted by a strong supporting cast that includes  Hank Azaria as the laid-back yet ferociously competitive Whit; Matthew Fenton as the sweet but never-cloying Jake; and Dylan Moran as Dennis’s best friend, Gordon, a degenerate gambler with a penchant for slightly cryptic declarations. (In the aftermath of the blister scene Gordon states, “That was the second most disgusting thing I’ve ever had in my eye.”)  The film’s mix of droll banter, lowbrow slapstick  and melancholy song montages suggests that its  director, the former “Friends” star David Schwimmer, has seen “The Graduate” more than once. The movie is formulaic, and there are times when Mr. Schwimmer and his writers overdo things (particularly in the finale, which finds Whit, previously a human-scaled jerk, indulging in cartoon villainy).  But its assembly-line aspects are countered by touches that translate drama into metaphor, like the scene in which Dennis and Whit  walk with Jake, each would-be daddy tugging at one of the boy’s hands, wishbone style, and an earlier scene in which Whit warns Dennis that every marathoner hits a wall — an admonition that pays off in the marathon sequence when Dennis encounters a  chillingly effective visualization of that wall.  “Run, Fat Boy, Run” is the kind of movie that’s apt to be dismissed a goofy lark.  It is that. But it’s also a rare comedy that believes  in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.    “Run, Fat Boy, Run” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  Profanity, nudity and gross-out slapstick.

When actors go behind the camera, one usually spies hitherto unknown traits of artistic personality. David Schwimmer's first bigscreen directing effort reveals something very different: a thoroughly competent mainstream craftsman who imposes no individual character on formulaic material. Comedy starring Simon Pegg as a runaway groom trying to win back his love by running a marathon is a polished, innocuous, by-numbers affair in the mode of "Wild Hogs" or pre-"Harry Potter" Chris Columbus. Pegg might give pic a leg up in Blighty, but lack of marquee stars and Brit setting could muffle impact in North America.
Pegg is credited as co-writer (with story originator Michael Ian Black), though the script was originally set in New York before London-based Material Entertainment came aboard. Despite transplant to a London setting and a mostly Brit cast, the pic, with its triumph-of-solo-underdog arc, feels like Hollywood product -- closer to the Farrelly brothers than to Pegg's home-turf collaborations with Edgar Wright ("Hot Fuzz," "Shaun of the Dead").
Prologue finds working-class stiff Dennis (Pegg) a nervous wreck in the moments before he's expected to wed heavily pregnant g.f. Libby (Thandie Newton). When it's time, he runs -- literally, pursued by bride and wedding party.
Five years later, he lives in a basement flat, works as a lingerie-store security guard and spends every waking moment aware that he blew it big-time. Libby is willing to let him spend time with their son Jake (Matthew Festoon), but she won't even acknowledge his pathetic attempts to start things over again. Slamming that door tightly shut is her serious new boyfriend, Yank financial exec Whit (Hank Azaria), who is handsome, rich, reliable, fit, attentive and several other things Dennis isn't. He's even nice as pie to Libby's ex -- which annoys our hero even more.
Sick of being a loser, Dennis impulsively vows to Libby that he'll compete in the same 26-mile charity marathon his hyper-fit rival is running.
Trouble is, the event is in three weeks, and as Dennis prefers to put it, he's "not fat ... just out of shape." Nonetheless, he makes at least an initial committed effort. For reasons of their own, some financial and some altruistic, best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and landlord Mr. Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel) sign on as his whip-cracking trainers.
There are no surprises here -- just broad, frequently slapstick gags that don't avoid but do tamp down a bit on the bodily-function school of yokkery. Lengthy race finale lacks the nerve to parody inspirational-sports-pic cliches, instead playing it fairly straight.
Pegg, Newton and Azaria are all first-rate talents coasting through mediocre material. Irish comic Moran's shrugged-off line deliveries score a few points.
Slick pic hews to comedy conventions of the moment, frequently driven by a soundtrack featuring various pop artists; production package is slightly above-average for the genre, with a nice, warm look to Richard Greatrex's location lensing. While there's not much here to warrant critical praise, Schwimmer handles everything with the kind of pro confidence that leaves little doubt he's got a second career track if he wants it.


Actor-screenwriter Simon Pegg 's follow-up to the surprise hits Shaun of the Dead  and Hot Fuzz  isn't as quirky or distinctive as those earlier films, but it confirms that he's one of the only comic actors working today who's as adept at banana-peel pratfalls as he is at delivering brainy verbal wit. Pegg's Dennis has never lived down the day, five years earlier, when he made a feverish 500-yard dash away from the altar—and his pregnant bride, played by the exquisite if overqualified Thandie Newton . The weight of that decision bears literally on him: He's now a paunchy watchman at a posh lingerie shop. When his still-smarting ex takes up with an over-achieving fitness nut (Hank Azaria , oozing self-satisfied smarm), Dennis wakes from his ever-say-die funk to declare he'll run the same upcoming marathon as Mr. Right—in three weeks' time. As director, actor David Schwimmer  doesn't supply the sixth-sense timing or jittery visual panache that Pegg gets from his usual collaborator, Edgar Wright , and that ends up stifling the sight gags. But Pegg has staked out a peculiar slant on genre material that ventures beyond irony toward rehabilitation—and nobody plays blithe humiliation with more style.
