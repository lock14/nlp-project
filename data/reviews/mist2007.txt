Spoiler warning: The critic will give away the end of the movie in the third to last paragraph of this review. If you intend to see the film, by all that is holy stop reading before then. You have been warned.
If you want to use a genre movie - sci-fi, action, musical, whatever - to make a larger statement about humanity, it's best to keep things lean and tight by inserting said message into the metaphorical cracks. This is what the first two versions of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" did, and that worked out nicely.
With "The Mist," a reasonably scary big-bug movie based on a Stephen King novella, writer-director Frank Darabont takes the opposite tack: He blows out the running time and spackles his social observations on top like frosting. Darabont believes he's an important filmmaker, and why shouldn't he? For reasons that escape me and many others, his 1994 drama "The Shawshank Redemption" is ranked the second-best movie of all time in voter ratings at the Internet Movie Database. (It's a perfectly fine film, but #2? Better than "The Godfather Part II" and "Casablanca" and even "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?)
That bloated sense of purpose turns what could have been a nifty B-movie into a strained, two-hours-plus "Twilight Zone" episode, and, believe me, Darabont's no Rod Serling.
I'm serious: Major spoilers ahead. Stephen King has publicly stated that anyone who spills the beans deserves the death penalty, but I'm willing to take the risk.
Like the old John Carpenter shrieker "The Fog," "The Mist" gets rolling when a mysterious cloud bank descends on a coastal town (this being Stephen King, we're in Maine). There are things in this unholy white-out, they have teeth, and they're extremely hungry. So far, so good.
The filmmaker has been watching a lot of Hitchcock, and "The Mist" plays like the diner sequence in "The Birds" padded to fill an entire movie. There's been a nasty storm the night before, and the supermarket is filled with locals and weekend Richie Riches filling up their grocery carts. They're all trapped inside when the fog comes down, and we're trapped with them.
Our hero is David Drayton (Thomas Jane), a successful local movie-poster artist. His young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), has come shopping with him, as has his New York-attorney neighbor (Andre Braugher), with whom David has a prickly relationship. As the bodies pile up outside, the crowd divides into panicked groups. The local crazy lady (Marcia Gay Harden, biting into her role as if her agent had presented her with a prize ham) starts preaching that it's the end of the world, and the store's weaker vessels start listening to her as the days wear on.
David anchors a saner group that includes assistant store manager Ollie (Toby Jones - the other Truman Capote), a feisty schoolmarm (Frances Sternhagen), and several others. And, look, here's the town's pretty new schoolteacher Amanda, played by Laurie Holden with Tippi Hedren's hair and Kim Novak's "Vertigo" wardrobe.
You think I'm kidding? I'm not. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. Can I make this any clearer?
The set-up, then, is 50 or so little Indians, with hellspawn banging on the windows outside. (There's a cursory explanation; this being King, it involves the military.) Darabont's more interested in watching his characters call each other out over perceived class differences, though; he also gives Harden about 10 too many apocalyptic rants about the "Book of Revelations" (sic). Don't expect the movie to play well in the Bible Belt. Don't expect it to play with the Motion Picture Editor's Guild, either, since there appears to have been a cutting-room lock-out.
Despite all this, "The Mist" holds its tension for the most part, alternating frenzied eek-eek-eek sequences with periods of taut, silent dread. The special effects are well done, and the ones that aren't are hidden by that convenient fog. After a while, though, the movie wants to make big statements about the Madness of Crowds, and at this length they're trite and heavy-handed.
Then, as if to underscore that he's above such silly things as sci-fi and horror, Darabont throws his curveball of an ending. (OK, last chance. Exit's that way. Abandon hope all ye who enter here.) Having escaped with three others, David and little Billy drive through the mist until their car runs out of gas. Around them are the shrieks of horrible things ready to pounce and rend. The five humans have a gun with four bullets; David does what he must and exits the car alone to await his fate. Two minutes later the army shows up. Bum-mer.
I don't think you have to be a parent to hate a movie that ends with the kid getting shot in the head by his dad. As a favor. And just think: All they had to do was turn on the car radio.
Someone must think such a finale is dark and daringly tragic and uncomfortable and cool. Someone is wrong. "The Mist" doesn't provoke further thought; it provokes active annoyance at being punished in the service of a pulp morality tale with pretensions. Even Hitchcock knew that: When he blew up the little boy in the bus in 1936's "Sabotage," he ended up having to issue a public apology. And Darabont, need I say it, is no Hitchcock.

The setting is a pretty Maine village  a clue bright as a lighthouse beacon that Stephen King has something to do with the horror that follows in The Mist . Upstanding residents go about their business, which includes shopping for groceries after a storm. Then a thick, mean, white, wet fog rolls in, and with it come giant, hideous creatures from a hellish other dimension (some buglike and winged, others tentacled and slimy), hungry for anyone caught outside. So those in the supermarket barricade themselves inside. And then the real human-on-human evil begins.
The bugs and such are gross enough  and yet so very handsome  in Frank Darabont's nifty, unusually spry, and almost shockingly pessimistic low-budget adaptation of King's 1980 extended short story. (Abandon all hope, ye who remember the original, unresolved ending.) But it's the good people of classic Kingville, brought to life by an energized cast including Thomas Jane, Andre Braugher, and Laurie Holden, who ought to scare the bejesus out of audiences. There's a grim modern parable to be read into the dangerous effects of the gospel-preaching local crazy lady Mrs. Carmody (brilliantly played by a hellfire Marcia Gay Harden) on a congregation of the fearful. Under the circumstances, when a feisty neighbor (Frances Sternhagen) bonks Mrs. C on the head with a can of peas, the gesture counts as a declaration of independence.

 Until the director Frank Darabont decides that he’s saying something important instead of making a nifty horror movie, “The Mist” isn’t half bad. In fact,  until the monsters and the meaning start to emerge, this shivery story works your nerves far better than most recent horror does, largely because it knows that nothing scares moviegoers better than our own overactive, reactive imaginations. This is a film that knows how to make you jump in your seat simply by showing you next to nothing: It knows you’ll eagerly fill in the blanks all by your lonesome, genre-conditioned self.  Based on one of Stephen King’s more modest efforts, meaning under 500 pages and pounds, “The Mist” takes place in a small Maine town where everyone seems to know everyone else by name or by sight. Most of the action unfolds inside a supermarket where the townspeople have gathered to stock up on supplies in the wake of a large storm that hit the night before. Among the shoppers are David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), who, along with the rest of the customers, stand by in shock when a bloodied man bursts in yelling murder and mayhem most foul. Something or someone seems to have snatched up another man, sucking this lost soul into the fast-creeping, swallowing mist.  The mist rolls into the town as a mystery at first, delicate and light gray and full of unknown possibility. It initially surges and billows and moves with unnerving quiet, by turns flowing like water and gathering mass, its smoky tendrils creeping like long fingers. In an early scene it hovers like a wary animal next to a metal gate at the back of the supermarket. A cluster of men, David among them, are trying to decide whether it’s safe to go outside and have slid the gate up just a little. They peer at the mist, and the mist seems to confront them in turn, though no one grasps its brooding, pulsing aliveness. Then a tentacle slithers into view and slimes across the floor.  The revelation of the monstrous drains much of the dread and menace from the story, leaving holes that Mr. Darabont fills with greater and greater heaps of portentous dialogue, some of which taps into ideas about the mass psychology of fascism and sounds straight out of a 1950s-style television talkfest. Among the most tiresomely yakky is an evangelical Christian, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden, in clover), whose observations about the End of Days first attract testy scorn and then an increasingly violent following inside the little supermarket community. This latter-day Aimee Semple McPherson turns out to be just as much a threat as the mist, though a considerably less pleasurable narrative conceit, and one that might have worked if Mr. Darabont hadn’t spent so much time preaching his own brand of scripture.  Much of that scripture sounds yawningly familiar and runs along the lines of all we have to fear is fear itself, and we have met the enemy, and he is us, and let him without sin cast the first stone. That’s too bad, because Mr. Darabont does some estimable work in “The Mist,” particularly when he moves away from the chattering mob and returns to the mist and its riddles, to its eerie, insectlike whirring and periodic elephantine trumpet blasts. In the haunting images of men and women cautiously venturing outside, their bodies melting into the mist, he offers a stronger, more palpable sense of what it means for human beings to be truly frightened than he does with any of the dialogue. He makes fear visible.  “The Mist” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gory dismemberment, gun and monster violence and some adult language.

Mutant insects and religious zealots are the chief villains in "The Mist," and it's hard to say who's uglier. Much nastier and less genteel than his best-known Stephen King adaptations ("The Shawshank Redemption," "The Green Mile"), Frank Darabont's screw-loose doomsday thriller works better as a gross-out B-movie than as a psychological portrait of mankind under siege, marred by one-note characterizations and a tone that veers wildly between snarky and hysterical. The Darabont-King imprimatur and curiosity among the author's legions of fans should lure healthy crowds over Thanksgiving weekend, though long-term B.O. prospects look foggier. Ancillary should make up any shortfall.
Six years after the lavish critical and commercial failure of "The Majestic," writer-director Darabont has returned with a vengeance to the horror genre (his scripting credits include such '80s titles as "The Fly II" and "The Blob") with this comparatively lean, mean apocalyptic scarefest. The basic premise of King's 1980 novella -- a malevolent fog descends on a small town, trapping several residents inside a supermarket -- has been given a shot of docu-style immediacy from the darting handheld camerawork by Rohn Schmidt (FX's "The Shield," an episode of which Darabont directed), and its grotesque monsters have been impressively realized thanks to a well-stocked arsenal of special, visual and creature effects.
But Darabont's desire to infuse an otherwise fleet genre exercise with dramatic significance -- to make a statement about man's cruelty to man in times of crisis -- ends up defeating him here. Playing like the schizoid hellspawn of Steven Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" and the low-budget bioterrorism thriller "Right at Your Door," pic is arguably less persuasive than either in advancing a bitterly pessimistic view of human nature.
After a freak storm damages their lakeside home in western Maine, illustrator David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (9-year-old Nathan Gamble) head to the grocery store to stock up on food and supplies. But then the mist rolls in, and while it's not clear what it is (or worse, what it might be concealing), most of the shoppers have the good sense to stay inside, especially as those who go out tend not to return in one piece.
Several nasty shocks later -- courtesy of a slimy, many-tentacled behemoth and giant, winged, vaguely prehistoric-looking bugs that smash their way into the store -- a supermarket employee announces, with priceless understatement, "It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude." And as fear, desperation and factionalism set in among the refugees, "The Mist" raises the inevitable question of who the real monsters are.
For that title, it's hard to beat Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious extremist who whips up the crowd with her fire-and-brimstone denunciations and shrieks "Now
 do you believe?!" after every fresh catastrophe. Her wild eyes ablaze, Harden makes this awful stereotype awfully entertaining, mustering up enough fervor to nearly sell the film's hideous vision of men and women calling out for blood sacrifices to appease a wrathful God.
As played by Jane, the kind, reasonable, ever-resourceful David is impossible not to root for (he's a hunky man of action and
 a sensitive artist!), and more often than not, those characters foolish enough to scorn our hero's advice are promptly and gruesomely punished. Bumping off the clueless is a time-honored horror tradition; so, too, is the bad-omen makeout scene (enacted here by attractive young'uns Alexa Davalos and Sam Witwer).
Cliches aside, Darabont proves very much in his element during the pic's harrowing midsection, unleashing large-scale chaos on production designer Greg Melton's expertly detailed supermarket set and generating unpretentious thrills and laughs along the way. But the film can't sustain this momentum en route to a highly calculated ending that departs from King's more ambiguous denouement to mostly shrug-worthy effect.
While most of the supporting cast is hobbled by dialogue of the "I'd rather die out there trying than in here waiting!" variety, Brit thesp Toby Jones and vet Frances Sternhagen do strong character work as sensible, salt-of-the-earth types. Creepy-crawly creature effects, some of which owe an obvious debt to "Alien," are squirmingly apt.
At just over two hours, "The Mist" is longish for a novella-based thriller but short compared to Darabont's previous pics.

As one of what novelist Stephen King  calls his Constant Readers, I was as jazzed as every other monster-lovin' geek when word came that filmmaker Frank Darabont  was making a movie of King's classic novella, The Mist . Cynics suggested that after tanking big time with his Frank Capra  homage, The Majestic , Darabont was running to King for cover. Perhaps, but who could blame him? Adapting King's The Shawshank Redemption  (1994) and The Green Mile  (1999) brought the writer-director three Oscar nominations, and the good-luck chain actually stretches back to 1977, when King sold a 23-year-old Darabont the rightsfor all of one dollarto an old story, The Woman in the Room . The short film that followed was Darabont's ticket to Hollywood , and a life that any sad-sack horror nut (including this one) would envy.
Why, then, is The Mist  such a disaster? How did a straightforward little tale about prehistoric monsters gobbling down the hapless citizens of a modern-day town become such a lumbering and depressing movie?
As the film opens, a weirdly thick fog is settling over Castle Rock , Maine , after an unusually violent storm. With the power out, book-jacket artist David Drayton  (Thomas Jane , subtle and strong) leaves his wife at home and heads into town with his nine-year-old son (Nathan Gamble ) to buy supplies. As they wait in a long grocery-store checkout line, a bloodied man (Jeffrey DeMunn ) runs in, screaming, "There's something in the mist!" Soon, giant eel-like tentacles slip under the loading-dock door and drag away Norm the bag boy, a gruesome sight that only Drayton and three others witness. Neither King nor Darabont explains just why the dozens of other people inside the store can't hear the kid's bloodcurdling screams, but in any case, it falls to Drayton to convince the skeptical customers that there's danger in that there mist.
What follows is a lot of crying and speechifying and not nearly enough people-eating. At just over two hours, The Mist  is the shortest movie Darabont has made, and it's still too long. Less chatter, more monster, please. There are two terrific attack sequences, one of which finds Drayton jabbing a string mop dipped in lighter fluid at flying pterodactyls as they dive for humans on aisle three. Later, he leads an exploratory mission to the drugstore next door, only to encounter massive spiders that shoot acidic webs.
Good stuff, but a clue to what's ultimately awry in this movie can be found in that drugstore sequence. A retired schoolteacher, played by the great Frances Sternhagen , comes face to face with an eight-legged freak and, rather than screaming, she sets it on fire with a lighter and a can of bug spray. Now, an old lady zapping a giant spider with a can of Black Flag  is the kind of detail that makes Stephen King fun to read, but Darabont lets the moment (and others like it) rush past, as if bug humor is a bit beneath him. He gives similarly short shrift to the creatures: They're beautifully ugly, but you get the feeling that the filmmaker isn't all that interested in them, which is odd, because to make a good horror movie, a director's got to love his demons best. Instead, Darabont darts obsessively among the various factions of trembling humans within the store, as if he really believes that some great truth about humankind is going to be revealed by this gaggle of stock characters.
King's novella is 27 years old, but Darabont the screenwriter hasn't updated a thingthe dialogue is straight out of the booknor has he stripped away the author's youthful excess. (King, bless him, is no Shakespeare .) This is particularly true of the villain, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden ), the town loon, who waves her Bible in the air and declares the mist creatures to be God's wrath. King has always relished a mouthy zealot, and Darabont may mean her to represent the fundamentalist extremes at play in a fear-based America, but listening to Carmody holler for the length of a movie is like being stuck at a bus stop near a Baptist with a bullhorn.
All this would be disappointing, but not infuriating, if the film's ending weren't so unforgivably bad. Darabont abruptly abandons his master's text in the movie's final minutes, sending Drayton and his little boy a plot twist that wouldn't be fair to reveal, but which is so distasteful and untrue to all that's come before it as to be a slap in the face to characters and audience alike. The last word in King's story was "hope," and while Darabont certainly has the right to head in the opposite directionin our own monster-filled world, happy endings are harder than ever to buyhe does so in a manner that's both pretentious and cruel. The Mist  made me want to scream, but for all the wrong reasons.
