 You don’t have to go far into the press material for “The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie” before you hit the phrase “faith-and-values-based property.” It is used to describe this and earlier offerings from the VeggieTales franchise, but the “faith” component of this rather ordinary film for children doesn’t make itself readily apparent.  Perhaps it’s faith in the notion that if you appropriate chunks of a cinematic classic — in this case “The Wizard of Oz” — your tale will be elevated to classic status too. Perhaps it’s faith in the marketing strategy of borrowing the signature word from the title of someone else’s very popular trilogy and hoping people will turn up at your film thinking that Johnny Depp is providing the voices.  Alas, he is not. Maybe the film is trying to pay Mr. Depp and his “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies homage by dropping in a reference to his earlier “Edward Scissorhands,” even though that film came out at least 10 years before anyone in the target audience was born. Less easy to explain is its reference to “Scarface,” one of the least faith-and-values-based movies ever made.  The writer, Phil Vischer, doesn’t have the ear or timing to make such asides work for the adults or the kiddies; this is no savvy “Toy Story.” It’s a boilerplate plot like one you might find in any morning cartoon. A gourd, a cucumber and an old gent with a purple nose are transported back in time to rescue a prince and princess from pirates. They do and, like the Scarecrow et al., find their brains, courage and heart along the way. An Oz-like man even gives them awards at the end.

"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything" won't do anything for adult auds, but this second bigscreen adventure from the popular VeggieTales franchise should easily win over tots with its reliable menu of silly songs, easily digestible morals and wholesome (if not always fresh) produce-based characters. Less overtly Christian in content than 2002's Old Testament riff "Jonah," pic is nonetheless chockfull of lessons about courage, friendship and the inherent dangers of cheesy snack foods. The first VeggieTales toon distributed by a major studio, "Pirates" should encounter smooth sailing in family-friendly theatrical waters before bagging some serious ancillary booty. 
Fans of the original homevid series will recall the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything from a sing-along song about a lazy threesome who dress up as pirates but prefer to spend their time, well, vegging out ("We're the pirates who don't do anything/We just stay home and lie around/And if you ask us to do anything/We'll tell you ... we don't do anything"). A perfect three-minute distillation of the VeggieTales' modest but delightfully eccentric sensibility, that zany throwaway was more genuinely clever than anything in this feature-length expansion, which builds an uninspired swashbuckling yarn around the eponymous trio.
As with "Jonah," the main mateys in "Pirates" are composites of established VeggieTales characters: Larry the Cucumber is rechristened Elliot (voiced by Mike Nawrocki), while Pa Grape becomes George and Mr. Lunt, a mustachioed gourd, is Sedgewick (latter two are voiced by scribe Phil Vischer).
The three amigos are holding down dead-end jobs at a pirate-themed dinner theater when they are suddenly whisked back in time to the 17th century, summoned to a royal ship by the good Princess Eloise (voiced by Laura Gerow), whose brother Alexander (Yuri Lowenthal) is being held captive by their wicked pirate uncle, Robert the Terrible (Cam Clarke). (Robert the Terrible is a gourd, while Eloise and Alexander are leeks, raising questions of legume lineage that are perhaps best not pondered too deeply.)
George, Elliot and Sedgewick don't look or feel especially heroic, as Eloise's snooty butler Willory (who's a real stick up the asparagus) is quick to point out; the drama hinges on whether they can overcome their initial reluctance and realize that true heroes come in all shapes and sizes. The journey they take is fraught with mildly imaginative perils -- a family of cute but not exactly cuddly rock monsters and an army of bite-size critters that bring new meaning to the term "Cheese Nips" -- as well as some serviceble but unmemorable tunes (penned by Nawrocki, Vischer, composer Kurt Heinecke and Steve Taylor).
As ever with VeggieTales, the demands of realism don't weigh too heavily on the mostly clean, sparkling 3-D animation; viewers should be prepared to suspend disbelief when characters clash swords without arms or play hopscotch on the poop deck without legs. But if the series has never looked better visually, the wan material makes it hard not to wonder if Nawrocki and Vischer were creatively stymied by recent behind-the-scenes transitions (after the release of "Jonah," their Big Idea Prods. shingle was acquired by Classic Media Holdings, which was in turn snapped up by U.K.-based Entertainment Rights in 2006).
Parents who have used the VeggieTales videos as Sunday-school supplements may be disappointed by the absence of a biblical hook -- or, for that matter, pic's penchant for easy ethnic stereotyping (plump, lazy Sedgewick has a Mexican accent, and Robert and Willory are oh-so-British in their condescension). Yet these sins could be more easily forgiven if "The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything," nourishing but limp salad that it is, amounted to more of a full meal.

One way to change your child's opinion of produce is to subject them to The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie , which makes the prospect of scarfing down a plateful of unseasoned brussel sprouts enticing by comparison. From the present to "somewhere in the 17th century," three vegetables of vaguely determinate type but obvious racial identity arrive to save a royal family from a group of pirates. All sorts of nonsense is accomplished with the aide of the golden compasserr, the help seekera gizmo that allows a cucumber, a gourd, and a grape (all fruit, incidentally) to play heroes in the past so as to boost their egos in the present. Humorless, incoherent, and ugly as sin, this Christian-friendly production is as tragic as the candle wax that resembles a glob of man jam and opens Pa Grape's eyes to the meaning of his adventure.
