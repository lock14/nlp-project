The best thing I can say about this otherwise unsalvageable heap of busted heads and blasted gaskets is this: David Carradine does more real acting in the opening two minutes � using only his voice! � than anyone else in the entire picture, and that includes all those hot-modded, supercharged, nitrous-oxide-fueled hell rides. Carradine, as fans of the original Death Race 2000
 (produced by Roger Corman and directed by Paul Bartel in 1975) already know, played the masked driver Frankenstein, a racer in a two-lane-blacktop version of the equally nihilistic Rollerball
 (which came out the same year). In that original, futuristic NASCAR types road-rallied cross-country, picking up points by mowing down pedestrians. Corman's film arrived in theatres just two years after the United States suddenly found itself at the mercy of Middle-East oligarchs (as we are now) and deep in the process of extricating itself from a tremendously unpopular war (as we are now), and the bitter, blacker-than-black gallows humor that informed Death Race 2000
 is, if anything, more relevant than ever. The advent of reality television and pay-per-view spectacle, presciently hinted at in the Corman version (legendary Los Angeles deejay "The Real" Don Steele provided histrionic running commentary throughout, via his "eye in the sky" chopper) is now the dominant media force (alongside the Internet). In its day, Death Race 2000
 was a trenchantly subversive � and very American � film. This new Death Race
 is equally revelatory, although what it reveals is not a simmering sense of societal outrage but the exact opposite. More to the point, it also shows widely loathed director/writer Anderson to be an even worse filmmaker than his r�sum� suggests (most recently, he helmed the excreable AVP: Alien vs. Predator
). Anderson takes the bare-bones concept of cars and drivers engaged in state-sanctioned slaughter and reduces it to dull, gladiatorial combat safely taking place behind the privatized penitentiary walls of Terminal Island, while being streamed live via the Internet to the huddled, presumably brain-dead masses. Framed for the murder of his wife by the evil prison warden (Allen), former racing pro Jensen Ames (Statham, who must never be allowed to forge an alliance with Vin Diesel lest they create a race of buff, balding, growly �bermenschen) is coerced into donning the mask of the recently deceased Frankenstein, thus giving the bloodthirsty home audience more of the same old blood-and-circus. Chaos ensues, but none of it is interesting or even gearhead cool. Adding insult to vehicular homicide is Anderson's dead-awful eye for action sequences; this film has more aggressively disorienting swoops and zooms than a pigeon on acid, but it's not nearly as fascinating. Anderson has neutered the original film's outrageously transgressive macadam mayhem and completely stripped the story of its pointedly political social satire, making this Death Race
 one of the most boring drags of all time.


Even when he's not adapting a video game, writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson ("Resident Evil," "Mortal Kombat") can't resist making his work feel like one. His redo of producer Roger Corman's cult campfest "Death Race 2000" lays out rules that are PlayStation-ready: Drivers pass over a lighted sword icon, and their cars' hood-mounted artillery powers up. When they pass over a shield icon, a "defensive" complement of oil, smoke, and napalm activates.
It's all good when you're making (or turning out for) a movie called "Death Race." But smartly, Anderson makes some eclectic casting choices that keep the story from feeling as though it's populated by video-game characters, too.
Jason Statham stars as tough guy Jensen Ames, a onetime pro driver framed for his wife's murder and packed off to a near-future, corporate-run prison where brutal muscle-car racing has become a booming pay-per-view bloodsport. The competition's high priestess, heels-wearing warden Hennessey (Joan Allen), promises Ames an expedited release if he'll pose as "Frankenstein" (David Carradine's character in the original) - a masked driver who, unbeknownst to race fans, died after a recent crash. Grudgingly, Ames dons his predecessor's Quiet Riot facepiece, and just like that, Frank's alive.
Statham and costar Tyrese Gibson, as be-grilled archrival Machine Gun Joe, look their parts, even if dramatically they're not always as nasty as they wanna be. But Ian McShane, as "Shawshank"-esque lifer Coach, handles Ames's body work and gearhead exposition with rascally crustiness, every bit as amused as you'll be that he's here. Allen, meanwhile, plays the prison matron like an HMO claims-denial exec, all entertainingly thin-lipped placidity. Just you go ahead and snicker when she says of her suspiciously providential management record, "Sometimes it's like the right hand of God is sitting on my shoulder"; she's got a pointed shotgun under her desk. Seriously.
Thanks to its character interplay, the movie doesn't drag despite taking a good 40 minutes to really rev its engines. And the racing that ensues is as loud, fast, hyper-edited, and pulverizingly destructive as the gladiatorially minded would hope. (There's no telling why the prison looks like an abandoned industrial site, but it does make for lots of steely protrusions for inmates to get brained on. You'll wince more than once, guaranteed.)
It's fitting, actually, that Anderson would want to remake Corman, never mind the tonal disparity between the two movies. Whether it's video games or "Alien vs. Predator" or "Death Race," Anderson, like Corman, gets plenty of A's for enthusiasm in his approach to B-movie schlock.


Let Death Race  serve as a warning, or maybe an inspiration, to any TV producer who says she'd kill for high ratings: Why not stage a pay-per-view car race in which prisoners compete to stay alive on the course? In Paul W.S. Anderson 's brisk, bone-crunching retooling of the 1975 B movie Death Race 2000  , Joan Allen  plays the prison warden her inmates generously call ''the baddest ass in the yard.'' And to emphasize the unsubtle gender joke, costumers sheath Allen's own assets in the kind of suit-and-heels drag that signifies uptight bitch or secret porn star. Both, really: Soft sexual and racial jabs replace the more daring political commentary of the original, a crude classic from the Roger Corman  factory.
That was the anarchic '70s, baby; this is the conservative now , delivered by the genre specialist who directed blank-faced destruction in Resident Evil   and Mortal Kombat  . Cartoon toughie Jason Statham  grimaces as the wrongly imprisoned, righteously muscled prisoner the warden has assigned to fill a driver's seat (and face mask) following the demise of the fan favorite known as Frankenstein. As nemesis Machine Gun Joe (originally growled by Sylvester Stallone ), Tyrese Gibson  does his best imitation of a standard gang leader, cell-block division.
More Death Race :

 There’s something to be said for a movie that knows exactly what it is and then whacks that knowledge home like a rusty pipe in the face. Case in point: “Death Race,” a delectable bit of B-movie savagery that actually does feature pipe melees, among much other kicky (and punchy and impaled-by-a-metal-spikey) ultraviolence.  The premise, updated from the 1975 cult classic “Death Race 2000,” is simple, sick and satisfying. In the year 2012, in response to the collapsing American economy, shady corporations have taken over the prison system and reap huge profits by staging gladiatorial pay-per-view contests among the prisoners.  Out on Terminal Island, where the worst of the worst participate in the wildly popular Death Race showdown, an ice-queen warden named Hennessey (Joan Allen, slumming with style) faces a crisis. Her star driver, a mask-wearing psychopath named  Frankenstein, has just met his maker at the tip of a missile. In a bid to maximize ratings, Hennessey hatches a plot to replace Frankenstein with Jensen Ames (Jason Statham), a former racing champ.  Framed for the murder of his wife and shuffled off to Terminal Island, fury mounting and muscles rippling, Jensen is pressed into fending off a grimy assortment of gearhead sociopaths with the promise that if he wins the race he’s free to go. Needless to say, things are about to blow up, quite literally, in everyone’s face.  And how they blow! Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, a low-rent genre artisan who seems to have figured out a thing or two since staging “Alien vs. Predator” (or at least found a better crew to back him up), “Death Race” is a supercharged junkyard apocalypse powered by an unabashed relish for  brutal comeuppance and a flair for delirious vehicular mayhem.  Extended over three increasingly frantic, vividly murderous rounds, the Death Race itself is a tour de force of no-nonsense neo-grindhouse. Anchored by the ever-dependable Mr. Statham and his gruff, buff stoicism, the movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight — including the shallow philosophizing and computer-generated fakery that have overrun the summer blockbuster.  No fancy talk here, just solid, monosyllabic obscenities; no flights of digital fancy, just souped-up monster cars flipping end over end in a napalm blaze and crashing in a crunch of flaming metal ouch.  “Death Race” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Mauling, maiming, bruising, beating, impalement, immolation, detonation, decapitation and a flagrant disregard of automotive etiquette.

As hard as metal and just as dumb, Paul W.S. Anderson's "Death Race" couldn't be further from producer Roger Corman and director Paul Bartel's goofy, bloody 1975 original, "Death Race 2000." Basically a souped-up gladiatorial battle on a racetrack inside what's supposedly future America's toughest high-security prison, the pic maintains "2000's" body count and a few character names, and dumps the rest -- including the humor. Fans of the remake may not care, and will pony up for any late-summer package of high-throttle thrills.
It's 2012, the U.S. economy is in meltdown, unemployment and crime are on the rise, and big, bad corporations have somehow taken over everything, including the prisons.
A rather meaningless action opener, showing how driver Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) blows away an opponent named Frankenstein (voiced by David Carradine, from "2000"), gets auds' heart rates pumping. Rooting interest emerges with former racecar driver and now steel-plant worker Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) being laid off, with his fellow employees inexplicably confronted outside the plant by overly violent SWAT-style cops.
Back home with wife Suzy and baby Piper, Ames is surprised by a masked intruder who murders Suzy and frames Ames. He's sent away to Terminal Island, home of the race, which is so heavily guarded that escape is futile. Much of this is explained to Ames by friendly but grizzled mechanic Coach (Ian McShane, reviving the same Yank accent he used in "Deadwood"). Big boss is warden Hennessey (Joan Allen), as tough as her well-manicured nails, while the local tough guys known as "the Brotherhood," led by Pachenko (Max Ryan), try to send Ames a message with their fists.
With Joe having bumped Frankenstein, Hennessey tells Ames she needs a new contender for her "Death Race" pay-per-view show. Her offer: Win the three-day match, and he goes free. The catch: Lose, and he dies, since only the race's sole survivor wins.
Coach and his pit crew, consisting of nerdy, brainy Lists (Fred Koehler) and Gunner (Jacob Vargas) prep Ames' Mustang -- so tricked out with armaments it makes the weapon cars in "2000" look like puddle jumpers -- while Ames is told to wear Frankenstein's metal mask as a way of maintaining the character's intrigue.
But like so much else in "Death Race," this detail is sloppily ignored whenever the story or action conveniently requires it. Since "2000" was dumb on its face, Bartel played it for camp; Anderson (whose other futuristic, effects-heavy exercises include "Resident Evil" and "Alien vs. Predator"), unfortunately, tries playing it straight.
Three race setpieces, styled as an "American Gladiators"-meets-"Ice Road Truckers" TV show, are the pic's main events, and Anderson trains all his firepower with a numbing assault of quick cuts, hyperactive zooms, closeups of crashes and mega-explosions, lathered with a metal score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger.
The final race pits rivals Ames and Joe against the prison's full force -- such as it is. Pic's escape plot and grease-monkey-inflected happy ending are nothing more than a mindless way to place things in park.
After both "Transporters," "The Italian Job," "Crank" and this, Statham must be getting tired of acting behind the wheel. But he does maintain his ultra-low-fat, chiseled facade and low-end voice for full effect in a pic that demands little more. McShane and Allen handle their paydays with little damage, while Gibson and Ryan are big masses of muscle and badass.
Scott Kevan's widescreen lensing was overcooked in the lab to look as metallic as possible, and production designer Paul Denham Austerberry provides a stunning alteration of decaying Montreal industrial landscapes into the giant prison and race track.
