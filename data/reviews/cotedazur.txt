         The crass trailer for Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau's "Côte d'Azur" suggests it is but another ooh-la-la French sex farce, but the film is actually a gentle parable on the folly of sexual pretense. It is a comedy, more sensual than sexy, and it is wise in the ways of the heart — and the loins. This is a sophisticated adult treat in the French manner with an attractive and gifted cast and is essentially serious, yet often whimsical and always compassionate.
 
  Marc Biancheri (Gilbert Melki), proprietor of a garage in Paris, looks forward to summer vacation as a special treat, for he has just inherited from his estranged great aunt his late grandparents' ancient Côte d'Azur villa, where he spent the happy summers of his youth and which he hasn't seen for more than 20 years. Although somewhat rundown, the place has an irresistible, picturesque charm — even if its water heater is woefully inadequate. Marc's lovely, easygoing wife, Béatrix (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi), who frequently credits her liberated views to her half-Dutch heritage, quickly settles in.
 


         






    Almost as quickly, the Biancheri's 19-year-old daughter, Laura (Sabrina Seyvecou), takes off for Portugal with her biker boyfriend, but 17-year-old son Charly (Romain Torres) has invited Martin (Édouard Collin), a former schoolmate he hasn't seen for a year, to visit. Marc, who likes to keep busy, has a hard time relaxing and frets about his children and their sex lives while Béatrix's laissez-faire attitude perversely leads her to get it in her head that her son, merely shy with girls, is gay.
 
  She congratulates herself on her approval of his presumed affair with Martin, who actually is gay and hopes Charly is too. Martin's resulting sexual frustration propels the plot in unexpected directions. Meanwhile, Béatrix's ardent lover, Mathieu (Jacques Bonnaffé), has turned up unexpectedly, and, although at first feeling a little tacky over their clandestine meetings, Béatrix decides to enjoy the continuity in her double life. In the meantime, Charly has called hunky plumber Didier (Jean-Marc Barr) to check out the lack of hot water in the shower.
 
  There are consciousness-raising surprises ahead for the Biancheris, particularly Marc and Béatrix, who have never really reflected on the consequences of the pretense in their lives. Witty, buoyant and affectionate, "Côte d'Azur," with its delightful ensemble cast, extends a warm embrace to those learning to accept themselves and others as they really are.

Under cover of sex-farce complications and giddy musical numbers about shellfish, Côte d'Azur  envisions a civilized utopia where a loving family life is  enhanced, rather than threatened, by the breezy acceptance of multigenerational pansexuality. Writer-directors Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau may set their Garden of Eden in a sensually sandy French seaside village and ascribe rampant desire to the aphrodisiac qualities of snails and mussels. But it's clear that for the filmmakers, this is a sexy fantasy worth trying at home. And they make the prospect appear alluringly doable. (First, get a French summer home...)
The frothy/yearning concoction emphasizes homosexual  contentment  son Charly (Romain Torres) entertains his gay best friend, and Mom (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi) is all too happy to assume that Charly is gay too. (She's all too happy in general, considering that her lover looks like the Maytag repairman.) Dad (Gilbert Melki) has a more complicated reaction to his son's sexuality. And everyone has a friend in the bullet-headed local plumber (Jean-Marc Barr), who knows how to, let's say, fix pipes. The performances are mediocre. The heart is big. The weather is swell.
