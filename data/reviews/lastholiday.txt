I can tell you in two words why to see this movie, which is otherwise an unspecial Cinderella farce about a plain, shy New Orleans retail clerk�s whirlwind European winter holiday after she�s diagnosed with some improbable terminal ailment called Lampington�s Disease, and those two words are: Queen Latifah. Loosely based on J. B. Priestley�s 1950 screenplay for Last Holiday
 starring Alec Guinness, the film is shameless � shameless, I tell you � with its fantasy shopping sequences and sports slapstick and grand-hotel hijinks (although I was delighted by Petr Vanek, who has a Richard E. Grant quality but is blessedly taciturn, as a bellhop). Director Wang, who specializes in chick flicks (yes, we can call them that) while not helming more venturesome fare (2001�s The Center of the World
), gorges the viewer on wish-fulfillment, with a palpable assist from executive producer Robert Zemeckis: Prague sprinkled in storybook snow; severe couture shopgirls who dissolve into giddy collusion as our heroine waltzes in; Depardieu as an imperious executive chef who plies Latifah with fine cuisine, appreciates her appetites, and dispenses garbled bons mots about embracing life to its fullest. ("The secret of life is butter." As if that�s news.) LL Cool J orbits the story as the good man who adores Latifah from afar and treks through an avalanche to win her love. Critics aren�t supposed to like this kind of thing. But you know what? Latifah deserves it. She�s such a relaxed and radiant presence that she sells it completely, even when her character snowboards down a black-diamond slope, mangling the soulless CEO of her department store (a somnolent Hutton) and landing in the middle of somebody�s picnic lunch. She�s a welcome change from the neurotic romantic-comedy heroines of Hollywood�s yore, not only because she makes yuppies suffer and, if I may speak frankly, isn�t a single-digit size, but also because she is luminous and confident rather than self-doubting and hysterical. She�s far better than the movie is. If we are to live in a world of movies in which women are comically diagnosed with brain diseases and discover their moxie through base jumping in the Czech Republic, let us at least have Queen Latifah�s brass to add a bass note to the treacle.


Queen Latifah is a buxom woman from New Jersey who used to wear Afrocentric pantsuits and rap about sisters standing up for themselves. Now she sells Pizza Hut pizza, makes lite-jazz records, and stars in disposable hit comedies. No one looks at her and thinks, ''Julia Roberts." But ''Last Holiday," in its feathery, good-hearted way, is enough to give you pause.
Latifah plays a plainspoken, churchgoing penny pincher and aspiring chef named Georgia Byrd, who, after she's given three weeks to live, finds the old new lease on life. She quits her job selling cookware at a New Orleans department store, takes her ample savings, and flies to Prague where she checks into the $4,000-a-night presidential suite at the gargantuan Grandhotel Pupp. Latifah frees her hair from her bun, tries on an evening gown, and turns ravishing by the 30-minute mark.
There might be comedy in watching a voluptuous African-American woman drop a lot of cash in front of surprised white Europeans. But this movie has better things to do. Latifah, for one thing, doesn't put a chip on Georgia's shoulder. Georgia's take-me-as-I-am personality is a big hit with the hotel staff, which is presumably thrilled to serve a woman who is one of them. She, of course, treats them all like old friends.
The hotel happens to be crawling with people loosely connected to Georgia's American life: the sniveling owner (Timothy Hutton) of her old department store is in cahoots with the Louisiana senator (Giancarlo Esposito) who's off on a ski weekend when he should be meeting the congregation at her church. They and their friends see Georgia looking fabulous, palling around with the Pupp's chef (Gerard Depardieu, who else?), and receiving the staff's attention and assume she's a bigwig, too. She never forgets where she came from but is pleased to have the company.
The supporting cast, which includes Ranjit Chowdhry as Georgia's nincompoop doctor and Susan Kellerman as a severe Swede, is top-notch. And LL Cool J, who plays Georgia's love interest, a co-worker named Sean, has never been so boyish. I don't know whose idea this was (two tough rap legends jaunting in Hollywood froth), but the irony is inspired.
''Last Holiday" is a remake of a 1950 Alec Guinness vehicle. But really it's ''Pretty Woman" for self-sufficient women who don't need a man but wouldn't mind having one around. When I mentioned Julia Roberts earlier, it's only because it's the highest compliment you pay an actress when crowning a star. Still, it sounds stale; when people talk about ''the next Julia Roberts," they've always conducted the search with dollar signs in their eyes.
No one who caught Roberts when that silly movie first came out was thinking about her market potential. She just provoked a lot of the right feelings in people, the most important being joy. Watching Latifah in ''Last Holiday" left me with the same happiness. Director Wayne Wang and his screenwriters sometimes ape ''Pretty Woman." But Latifah's obvious forebear is Pearl Bailey, who was just as regal and straight-up.
Even when she has a breakdown during a church sermon that turns into a riotous gospel number, Latifah lowers the volume on her bawdiness. After Georgia's diagnosis, she pores over the dreams that now can't come true, including a date with Sean, and Latifah is so affectingly sad sitting there weeping at that kitchen table it's all you can do not to get up and hold a Kleenex up to the screen. This part means something to her no matter how recycled it might seem.
The movie extends that pride to its workaday New Orleans locations, which were filmed before Hurricane Katrina struck and appear here as touching matters of fact. Georgia's eventual homesickness gives ''Last Holiday" an unintended, but very real poignancy. Not only do we have the confirmation of a star, we have a persuasive argument for rebuilding a city.

Queen Latifah tries to act all shy and mousy at the beginning of Last Holiday . As Georgia Byrd, a prim department-store employee with big dreams, a dull life in pre-Katrina New Orleans, and a (mis)diagnosis of imminent death by symptomless disease, the likably ballsy entertainer tucks her chin in, dresses in garments of bilious beige, panics at the attentions of a nice fellow employee (LL Cool J), and uses about a quarter of her lung power. But it's a no-go. We want va-va-ha-ha-voom from our Queen, and so we twiddle our thumbs through the setup until Georgia, having decided (after weeping to the heavens) to blow her savings on a swanky European vacation, throws off her cloister-wear and steps out in the eye-popping wardrobe and brash-but-warm, tough-but-funny, take-no-guff self-confidence that are the performer's identifying marks. Then she's on message.
A chaste and tepid remake of a 1950 British comedy in which Alec Guinness learned the benefits of living as if each day were his last, this Last Holiday , directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, displays telltale symptoms of International Blanditis, an unfortunate multinational co-production by-product in which even the most exotic settings and costars assume the depth of cardboard cutouts. Shot at the sumptuous Grandhotel Pupp in the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary and featuring Gérard Depardieu as a renowned master chef, neither mammoth 300-year-old hotel nor mighty large famous French movie star are given roles of proportionate substance.
Instead, in her Queenliness, the newly adventurous, outspoken, generous, and fabulously dressed Georgia enchants everyone she encounters, whether master chef, hotel clerk, or the up-to-no-good muckety-mucks she runs into in the lobby, among them a junketeering U.S. senator (Giancarlo Esposito), a pliable congressman (Michael Nouri), and their host (Timothy Hutton), who also happens to be Georgia's greedy, conniving boss. All learn from her regal magnanimity as she teaches her rapt students to live life with gusto. In a lesson just about as profound, Chef Depardieu suggests everyone ought to use more butter.

 Queen Latifah has a beautiful smile and the sort of relaxed screen presence that can take some performers decades to hone, but even this superflack for Wal-Mart can't gold-plate junk. Based on the 1950 British film of the same title with Alec Guinness, from a screenplay by J. B. Priestley, this story of a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of  her imminent death has been reconfigured as one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. Real-life obstacles are immaterial; so too, at least here, is competent filmmaking.  The man credited with directing this lackluster vehicle is Wayne Wang, a promising figure in the American independent film scene of the 1980's, best remembered for "Chan Is Missing" and a raucous entertainment called "Life Is Cheap ... but Toilet Paper Is Expensive." Mr. Wang subsequently went Big Hollywood with nutrition-free trifles like "The Joy Luck Club," with an occasional detour into strenuously independent fare like "The Center of the World," about a man and the woman he hires for sex. Last year, Mr. Wang directed the cute-kid, cuter-dog film "Because of Winn-Dixie," which, in conjunction with "Last Holiday," offers further proof that the classical studio system, with its enforced professionalism, served most directors and audiences better than today's marketplace free-for-all.  The reconfigured screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, whose credits include "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?," is as witless as it is formulaic. After receiving her deadly diagnosis, Ms. Latifah's Georgia sheds her church-lady reserve and swans into a European sugar-plum palace amid the rich and the craven. Armed with her savings and a newfound joie de vivre, she shops à la Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman" and crosses wits with a nasty white guy, much as she did in "Beauty Shop," which feels like Lubitsch next to this sluggishly paced trial.  Lessons are tendered and absorbed, artery-clogging banquets are cooked and consumed, and Gérard Depardieu briefly stops in, as does Emeril Lagasse. Eventually LL Cool J hauls the happily-ever-after into the proceedings, and not a minute too soon.

Paramount may be selling slapstick and impudent sass in trailers and TV spots, but "Last Holiday" is most successful when it is engaging, not uproarious. Glossy amusement is an updated remake of a well-regarded 1950 Brit comedy-drama starring Alec Guinness, improbably retrofitted as a star vehicle for Queen Latifah. Lead's appealing performance and overall feel-good vibe could attract diverse demographics and generate strong word of mouth during a potentially leggy theatrical run.
Original pic (scripted by J.B. Priestley) cast Guinness as George Bird, a mousy salesman who doesn't begin to enjoy life until he's told he has just a few weeks to live. Diagnosed with a fatal illness, he impulsively opts to spend his life's savings on a "last holiday" at an expensive resort where he's mistaken for a wealthy wheeler-dealer. As he savors the unfamiliar pleasure of being treated with respect and attentiveness, Bird gradually discovers that he's a much more interesting and adventurous fellow than he ever suspected.
Scripters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman recycle many of the same plot elements in their scenario for the Americanized remake. Georgia Bird (Latifah) is an introverted sales clerk in the cookware department of an upscale New Orleans department store. She dreams of being a successful chef, although she never even allows herself to sample to exquisite cuisine she prepares in her kitchen at home. (She's a chronic weight watcher who's stifled her appetite for fine food -- and, presumably, for life itself.) And she pines for a handsome co-worker (another amiable romantic turn by LL Cool J), who she's too shy to actually romance.
Much like her semi-namesake in the original pic, Georgia radically re-prioritizes when she gets seriously bad news from her doctor. (Julia Lashae is fleetingly funny as a nastily caricatured HMO administrator.) Determined to enjoy every minute of her final weeks, she books a flight to Karlovy Vary, where she hopes to meet the legendary chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu) and pamper herself at a luxurious ski resort.
Latifah deftly mutes her trademark verve in the opening reel of "Last Holiday," so that she's surprisingly credible as a woman too uptight and inhibited to even raise her voice in a church choir. (An elaborate production number during a Sunday service indicates that, down the road, pic might easily be transformed into a stage musical.)
As Georgia gradually blossoms in her new environment, director Wayne Wang encourages his leading lady to reveal more familiar aspects of her on-screen persona. Latifah effortlessly dominates every scene as Georgia hobnobs with vacationing congressmen (Giancarlo Esposito, Michael Nouri), admires the kitchen magic of a bemused chef Didier, and advises the under-appreciated mistress (Alicia Witt) of a snide retail tycoon (Timothy Hutton), who just happens to own the department store where Georgia worked in New Orleans.
Despite the undeniable appeal of pic's underlying "Live for today!" theme, "Last Holiday" takes a bit too long to cover familiar territory en route to a predictable destination. (It's not at all surprising that the remake eschews Priestley's audacious ending.) Some of the more elaborate funny business is, at best, uneven. A frenetic ski-and-snowboard race down a steep hillside goes on too long and relies too heavily on unconvincing stunt doubles.
Even so, Latifah ensures that "Last Holiday" is often very charming and never less than pleasant. She and Depardieu establish a mildly flirtatious give-and-take that is quite delightful -- so much so, in fact, that you may wish their characters had gotten even closer. Among the other supporting players, Witt, Ranjit Chowdhry (as Georgia's doctor) and Susan Kellermann (as a snooty hotel employee) are stand-outs.
Sequences filmed on location in New Orleans prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina may bring a sense of melancholy nostalgia to some viewers. In the same vein, a scene in which Georgia chides a Louisiana senator for not paying enough attention to "community re-development" may have an impact that the filmmakers could not have predicted.
Tech credits are mostly impressive, though lensing occasionally is unaccountably drab.

How in the hell did the new Queen Latifah  movie, a tired-looking remake of an Alec Guinness  chestnut, become the story of a working-class African American woman from New Orleans! taking revenge on Washington insiders who cater to special-interest groups while ignoring the poor? Boldly tackling congressional corruption and HMO avarice without sacrificing its heart or humor, Last Holiday  is the most surprisingly satisfying Hollywood  comedy in ages. Latifah plays a cautious department store clerk who, upon learning she has three weeks to live because her health insurance will not cover her brain surgery, blows her savings on a lavish getaway at a European ski resort. With death just days away, the previously circumspect Latifah does and says what she feels, and by placing her in opposition to Big Retail  (in the form of a supremely oily Timothy Hutton ) Last Holiday  adopts its heroine's I-don't-care-who-I-piss-off attitude. Ultimately, the film's brash political style nurtures its sense of humor instead of stifling it, confirming that there can be more to so-called adult comedies than puerile excretion gags.
