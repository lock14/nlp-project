Several morality plays vie for attention in Resurrecting the Champ
, a story about a Denver sportswriter, Erik Kernan (Hartnett), who�s yearning to break free of his workmanlike reputation and pen a story that will make his editors sit up and take notice. At times, it�s also a story about the failure of journalistic ethics and fact-checking, as well as a cautionary tale about the blind regard with which we view our sports heroes. And it�s also a sentimental drama about fathers and sons and the emotional distances between them. Though most of these narrative facets provide interesting fodder, none are satisfactorily developed creating a hodgepodge effect. Were it not for the solid cast performances, and in particular the showy Jackson performance as the Champ of the title, the visually bland movie would warrant little attention. Jackson raises his vocal register into a high-pitched rasp as the homeless, alcoholic ex-prizefighter whose cranium has clearly taken a few too many punches. Erik discovers Champ in a Denver alleyway, and falls hook, line, and sinker for his story about being the former middleweight champion Bob Satterfield. It�s a story that might finally impress his hard-to-please editor (Alda), who frankly dismisses Erik�s pieces as having �lots of typing but not much writing.� Erik is also stymied by following in the footsteps of his father, who was a legendary sportscaster, and his fears of becoming estranged from his son, who lives with his ex (Morris), who is a highly respected journalist at his paper (yet another tension: Which one of them is going to Career Day at their son�s school?). Soon, the pieces begin to unravel, and the errors caused by Erik having sacrificed due journalistic diligence to the demands of his ambition create a maelstrom that pushes the film toward Shattered Glass
 territory. Now diminished in the eyes of his adoring son and the legacy of his widely beloved dad, Resurrecting the Champ
 also threatens to turn into a modern male weepie. Resurrecting the Champ
 is anything but a standard boxing film, despite having a few good boxing sequences. One thing the film portrays spot-on is newsroom culture, perhaps because director Lurie (The Contender
, and executive producer of TV�s Commander in Chief
) is a former critic and entertainment reporter. Still, his depiction of a programming executive from the Showtime channel (Hatcher) as a unprincipled barracuda is extremely harsh. Resurrecting the Champ
 stays on its feet through all the rounds, but it never �floats like a butterfly.�


In "Resurrecting the Champ," Samuel L. Jackson is Bob Satterfield, a dread-locked, homeless, deranged, and wheezing ex-boxer living on the streets of Denver. Satterfield was well-respected and almost famous in the 1950s, but when we meet him he's a stumbling punching bag for a group of young men who hop out of their SUV to knock him around. Thank goodness Erik Kernan (ever earnest Josh Hartnett) happens by the beating. He covers boxing for the fictitious Denver Times. He really wants to cover the Nuggets or the Broncos, but his editor (Alan Alda) finds his work merely passable ("I forget your stories while I'm reading them").
Kernan thinks he needs a big piece to stretch out in, and Satterfield could be it. The paper's magazine shows interest in a cover story. The boxer shows interest in being covered. Not only would the story reroute the writer's career, it might save his marriage to a fellow Times reporter (Kathryn Morris), whom we're repeatedly told is very good yet seems very much out of his professional league. It could also bring him closer to his young son (Dakota Goyo) and make Kernan worthy of the name he shares with his late father, a respected boxing commentator. It all works out, more or less. Showtime, in the person of a delightfully glib Teri Hatcher, beseeches him to do post-fight interviews for the channel's boxing coverage, and co-workers hand out hosannas.
If most boxing movies are about redemption, "Resurrecting the Champ" is a boxing movie that goes to exasperating lengths to redeem its boxing writer. The film is based on a gripping article that J.R. Moehringer wrote 10 years ago for the Los Angeles Times Magazine. It's considered one of the great sports-journalism stories. This adaptation, though, bastardizes it, hinging on the kind of surprise (it comes about an hour in) that, if you're unfamiliar with the details, wakes up the movie for a little while, but is a cheap departure from the essence of Moehringer's story.
The screenwriters, Michael Bortman and Allison Burnett, and the director, Rod Lurie, an ex-film critic whose political drama, "The Contender," also hinged on a big plot twist, capture the journalistic nightmare that's at the movie's center. Professionally speaking, it definitely twisted the pit of my stomach. But it raises some crucial questions about how good Kernan is at his job. For one thing, if the piece he's written is so powerfully good and so pivotal for his success, we should see him working on it. We need to sample its prose. He just tells a researcher what he needs and hangs out with Satterfield, leaving you with the sense that Kernan's piece wrote itself. More aggravating is the possibility that the film is exploiting Satterfield as much as Kernan appears to be -- it's all about the reporter. The boxer, who far and away is the movie's most complicated character, becomes both an afterthought and a vehicle for somebody else's redemption.
Jackson invests this part with a sort of hamminess -- he's drunk, jovial, not-all-there. But he's still very much in the realm of recognizable humanity. This is the same thing he did earlier this year with an undercooked character, albeit a more original one, in "Black Snake Moan." He was better there. Still, he appears to believe in this part just as much.
The movie ultimately doesn't know what to make of his character. There are detours into Satterfield's life, including some momentary, vivid-looking reenactments that almost sink the movie since they suggest the real story is elsewhere. Instead, Satterfield barely exists when Kernan isn't around. So "Resurrecting the Champ" is one-sided Hollywood claptrap about honesty and valor, about how the truth, sigh
, can set us free -- well, some of us.


Erik Kernan (Josh Hartnett), an ambitious, mediocre sportswriter, is journalism's laziest and most self-pitying practitioner. Not that the makers of Resurrecting the Champ  think we'll notice, especially with Samuel L. Jackson throwing fancy punches as the homeless boxer Erik decides is his ticket to self-validation  and a good feature story  and Hartnett's unvarying earnestness. The writer discovers the wreck who calls himself the Champ in an alley  battered, drunk, and telling tales of former glory. So eager is he to prove himself to his estranged, more accomplished wife (Kathryn Morris), his moppety 6-year-old-son (Dakota Goyo), and the ghost of the famous sportscaster dad who wasn't around when he was a kid that Erik skips the small stuff. Like fact-checking.
Adding their own heavy-handed editorializing to the gist of a 1997 magazine piece by J.R. Moehringer on which the movie is based, screenwriters Michael Bortman and Allison Burnett and cudgel-swinging director Rod Lurie are not content, though, to make this a story of two imperfect men. Instead, speechy monologues on the responsibilities of journalism, the particular evil of infotainment (represented by Teri Hatcher as a she-devil from Showtime), and the gooey sanctity of the bond between fathers and sons all but nullify Jackson's zesty performance.

 “Resurrecting the Champ” is a cautionary fable that every journalistic go-getter dreaming of front-page bylines would do well to heed. Though the story is distantly based on fact, its  protagonist, Erik Kernan (Josh Hartnett),  is fictional. His sudden reversal of career fortune, following a brief, heady triumph, lends the movie moral traction.  The film’s jumping-off point is an article by J. R. Moehringer, published in 1997 in The Los Angeles Times Magazine. It told the story of an obscure 1950s boxer, Battlin’ Bob Satterfield, who was discovered living on the streets. It went on to be a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize, an award Mr. Moehringer  won three years later for another feature.  In the movie, directed by Rod Lurie from a screenplay by Michael Bortman and Allison Burnett, the setting has been moved to Denver and the fictional Denver Times, where the triumph of Erik, an eager-beaver sportswriter, curdles into the nightmare of a sloppy, overeager journalist who didn’t do his homework. For Mr. Lurie, who specializes in political subjects, “Resurrecting the Champ” is an encouraging return to film following the rise and fall of his television series “Commander in Chief.”  Samuel L. Jackson plays a would-be boxing legend, calling himself Satterfield but known on the streets of Denver as the Champ, who once sparred with Rocky Marciano and came close to a shot at the heavyweight title. Erik first spots the Champ defending himself against three young bullies who ridicule his boasts, then beat him to a pulp.  Dressed in rags, his skin crumbling like old parchment and his hair in matted salt-and-pepper dreadlocks,  the Champ is by turns poignant, wily, secretive, charming and pugnacious. And he can still throw a punch when half sober. At his most charismatic he has the aura of a holy fool, maniacally trotting behind a shopping cart filled with junk that he refuses to let Erik examine because, he says, the contents are too personal. Mr. Jackson’s champ is entirely convincing, and frequently incandescent.  Erik, sensing a career  coup, befriends the bedraggled old fighter and takes him to a match he is covering. Impressed with the Champ’s canny assessment of the combatants, he puts some of those observations into his  article and gains a modicum of respect from his grim, critical boss, Metz (Alan Alda), who until then had dismissed his writing as mechanical and colorless. Without telling Metz, Erik approaches the  newspaper’s Sunday magazine with the story of Satterfield and is given a green light.  “Resurrecting the Champ” captures the hard-boiled tone of a big-city newsroom almost perfectly. Several of the strongest scenes involve a weary, unsmiling Mr. Alda and David Paymer as the more gregarious editor of the  magazine, who gives Erik his break by putting his  article on the cover.  As the friendly but mutually exploitative relationship of Erik and the old fighter deepens, their give and take has just enough of an edge to make you squirm. The movie becomes a tentative detective story in which old photos and a vintage fight film become ambiguous clues to the life and career of the Champ, whom many have presumed dead.  The Champ, for all his lovability, has a streak of cunning in his bright, bloodshot eyes. Although he is genuinely down and out, you wonder how much of  his holy-fool role is just a hustler’s pose.  The journalistic aspect of “Resurrecting the Champ” is the toughest part of the film.  Things turn icky when the subject turns to father-son hero worship. Late in the film Erik reveals that his father, a legendary sportscaster, is not quite the man Erik wishes he were.  When Erik wows his  6-year-old son  with made-up stories about his friendships with sports stars, you wince at how desperately he strains to win his son’s adoration.  For reasons that are never satisfactorily explained, Erik has separated from his wife, Joyce (Kathryn Morris), a fellow reporter for The Times. Joyce is so tense and ashen that you wonder what happened to their marriage, but the movie offers no clues.  As the story takes a predictable turn from disgrace toward redemption, the film sacrifices credibility for a weepy, pandering pseudosincerity. For Mr. Hartnett, who has the most screen time, Erik is a much less demanding role than his policeman in “The Black Dahlia,” a movie he almost single-handedly sank with his clueless, wooden performance. Playing a handsome, feckless journalist on the fast track to celebrity, he doesn’t have much more to do than fill out the image of a gung-ho  all-American dad with fixable character flaws.  “Resurrecting the Champ” does make  a delicious, incongruous swerve into satire when the overnight star Erik is flown to Chicago by a cable network to be a commentator at a prizefight. Here he meets the network’s cynical, motormouthed casting director, Andrea Flak (Teri Hatcher), who regales him with an outrageous speech about how “the one thing people don’t want is the truth” and then puts the moves on him.  Ms. Hatcher imbues the role with far more snap and wit than she brings to the insufferable Susan Mayer on “Desperate Housewives.” It’s good to see her brain functioning again.  “Resurrecting the Champ” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

If "Resurrecting the Champ" were a prizefighter, he'd be soft around the middle. Although helmer Rod Lurie circles a lot of thorny issues in this morality tale of a middleweight contender-turned-homeless vagrant and the reporter who rescues him from obscurity, the plan of attack is overly sentimentalized and the execution is slack. If not for Samuel L. Jackson's performance as the ravaged boxer, "Champ" would be of limited interest. 
Josh Hartnett is Erik, a sports reporter for the Denver Times who's been eclipsed by the two people closest to him -- his late father, a legendary sports broadcaster, and his estranged wife, Joyce (Kathryn Morris), who's simply the better journalist. Erik wants off the boxing beat, but his editor, Metz (Alan Alda) wants him where he is. When Erik happens upon Champ (Jackson) one night and rescues him from a beating by thugs, he thinks he's found the story that will get him off the sports pages, into his paper's magazine and out from under the shadow of his father and wife.
When Jackson is onscreen, the movie floats and stings. Champ is funny, observant -- he predicts a longshot knockout when Erik takes him to the local fights -- but he's clearly been hit too hard, and too often. By raising his voice to a higher register than normal, Jackson makes Champ seem even more ephemeral than he would be, a ghostly man who lives in his dubious memory and regales Erik with stories that could just as well be myth as truth.
Erik is a well-written part; screenwriters Michael Bortman and Allison Burnett deftly capture a bruised ego who is just short of ruthless as he tries to convince Champ to tell him his story, committing the little lies and exaggerations of a journalist who's helping himself, while trying to convince everyone he's performing a service to his subject. Hartnett, though, makes Erik far less complex than he should have been, and when the movie reverts to him, it develops a weakness in the knees.
Well-edited and featuring convincing fight scenes choreographed by Eric Bryson, "Resurrecting the Champ" has a washed-out look that doesn't complement its characters; Jackson's champ is supposed to look like death, but Kathryn Morris, whose hair looks like it weighs more than she does, wilts under Adam Kane's anemic camera. The bigger problem, however, is Lurie's belaboring of what are really simple issues of personal integrity and public honesty that shouldn't take a full 12 rounds to get across.

Director Rod Lurie  can always find the overwrought in the mundane; his filmography (The Last Castle , The Contender, Deterrence ) is stocked with bombastic movies in which a timpani's deafening rumble accompanies every sideways glance. He's at it again with this story of Erik (Josh Hartnett ), a newspaperman who doesn't do quite enough research about a would-be former boxing champ (Samuel L. Jackson ) now living on the street. Erik's celebrated piece ruins himsort of, not really, who cares? Here's what Resurrecting the Champ  gets right: the dull grind of reporting and researching and writing, and the dull thud caused by a mistake made during that wearying processa mistake made totally by accident and easily fixable with a retraction. This isn't great raw material, though Lurie and his screenwriters try their best to portray Erik as some guilt-ridden evildoer who's perpetrated a great fraud. Ace in the Hole this ain't; Sweet Smell of Success neither.
