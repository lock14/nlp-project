Despite an A-list cast and director, it's astonishing how bad this movie is. It's furthermore astonishing since it's a remake of the 1949 Academy Award-winner for best motion picture, which was itself an adaptation of poet laureate Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Loosely based on the career of Louisiana Governor Huey P. Long, All the King's Men
 is a story about the insidious dangers of demagoguery, a morality tale about absolute power corrupting absolutely. Penn acts up a storm, and his performance as Willie Stark is actually the only redeeming aspect of the movie, even if his carriage bears more resemblance to the gangster fury inhabited by his brother Chris Penn in the movie The Funeral
 than it does to a larger-than-life Louisiana populist. Yet Penn's accent is often muddled, and the actors around him contribute a veritable gumbo of faux bayou accents. Rarely has such a great array of acting talent been so misused: The characters are not so much bad as they are wan and unformed. And none are likeable. Writer-director Zaillian (Searching for Bobby Fischer)
 never manages to assemble his actors into a unified whole, and they flail away like drowning souls engaged in various movies of their own making. The primary problem with the film lies in the script (or perhaps something that remained on a cutting-room floor). The narrative is missing a crucial sequence in which Stark is transformed from naive populist to power-wielding thug. Stark is an inscrutable character otherwise, and the tale loses all moral dimension. Presumably, the movie is meant to serve as a modern-day parable, but there is no moral to be drawn here, no resemblance to any known reality. The movie contains lots of sound and fury, but alas, it signifies nothing.


"All the King's Men" is a big, important awards-season special with one glaring problem: It doesn't have anything urgent or even interesting to say. Oh, and Sean Penn staggers through it as if the Oscar were already on his mantelpiece, twitching spasmodically in a furious display of capital-A Acting. I'm not the first observer, or even the second, to liken the star's portrayal of fictional Louisiana governor Willie Stark to the late John Belushi's impersonation of Joe Cocker. So make that two glaring problems.
As directed by Steven Zaillian , an Oscar-winning screenwriter (``Schindler's List") who has dabbled a bit behind the camera (``Searching for Bobby Fischer," ``A Civil Action"), ``All the King's Men" is notable for its directionlessness. Zaillian has adapted the 1946 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren -- about a barnstorming Southern politician in the 1930s based closely on Huey Long -- as if the 1949 movie based on the book never existed. (It won best picture and best actor for Broderick Crawford . )
That's fine, although trying to turn Warren's kudzu-choked prose into an effective cinematic experience is a task that would daunt stronger men. Here's a typical descriptive passage: ``The linoleum mat was newish, and the colors were still bright -- reds and tans and blues slick and varnished-looking -- a kind of glib, impertinent, geometrical island floating there in the midst of the cornerless shadows and the acid mummy smell and the slow swell of Time which had fed into this room, day by day since long back, as into a landlocked sea where the fish were dead and the taste was brackish on your tongue." And that's just the linoleum.
The book's narrative voice is that of Jack Burden: former journalist, Stark's fair-haired fixer, and a scion of the old South that Willie, an upcountry farmer's son, dearly needs on his side. Jack is a burnt idealist and he's played by Jude Law, who never suggests he has been further south than the Isle of Wight. The accent's passable but the bearing isn't, nor is the sense of crippling nostalgia for a privileged weeping-willow youth. Law's eyes have known difficulty but never doubt.
After a brief opening sequence, ``All the King's Men" flashes back to Stark's political beginnings, showing how he rode a small-town schoolhouse collapse he had predicted as county treasurer to a run for governor. When he discovers he's being used as a vote-splitter by the state machine -- as personified by greasy politico Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini, grinning Tony Soprano's fatcat smile) -- Willie becomes his own man. He proudly calls himself a hick and appeals to all the other hicks to reach into the capitol and ``nail 'em up!"
Once elected, Willie burns his bridges with the state's entrenched insiders (who mount an impeachment attempt) while building more bridges and schools and hospitals for the people -- making sure he gets a piece of the action along the line. The film is about demagoguery and corruption, or it should be, but Zaillian (who has been tinkering with ``Men" in the editing room for a year) never lets us see the change occur. Willie is a terse, watchful man of the people and then he's the Bossman. What happened, and why aren't we privy to it?
Penn offers few clues. He's fine in the early scenes, as you sense Willie's outrage ready to explode beneath the Sears mail-order suspenders, but once he gets his dander up and begins flailing his arms, the performance turns nearly laughable. Penn doesn't inhabit the character; he treats him as a marionette whose strings have been tangled. If there's a statement here about how easily voters can be swayed by charismatic charlatans, it's lost in the sturm und drang. We never connect with Willie Stark, and that's fatal.
``All the King's Men" busies itself with subplots about Jack's love for his childhood sweetheart Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet, another Brit as ineffectively cast as Law) and about Willie's misuse of Anne's brother Adam (Mark Ruffalo, himself spectacularly underused), a high-minded surgeon in charge of the governor's new hospital. On the sidelines is Anthony Hopkins as a family friend and local power broker, and it's mildly amusing to see that while Law and Winslet have tortured themselves to achieve the proper suthun
 accent, Hopkins can't be bothered. He just sounds like Anthony Hopkins.
Also present are Patricia Clarkson as Willie's morally lax press secretary and Jackie Earle Haley -- welcome back, Moocher! -- as the governor's private gunman. Zaillian films them all as if they're players in a Shakespearean tragedy and, just to seal the deal, cranks the knob on James Horner's overbearing score to 11. At least Willie Stark trusted the hicks to think for themselves.


         "All the King's Men" is a somber film about loss, betrayal and regret. With its emphasis on human frailty, the death of dreams and wasted potential, this celebrated story of the uses and abuses of political and personal power has a strong sense of drama and tragedy. It is a chronicle of a death foretold that's familiar not once but three times over.
 
  We know it first from the life that inspired it, that of Louisiana politician and populist tornado Huey Long, once called "the most entertaining tyrant in American history." We know it from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that took Long's truncated lifespan (he was assassinated in 1935 at age 42) as its starting point. And we know it from the 1949 film, one of only two ("Gone With the Wind" was the other) to win a best picture Oscar to go along with the Pulitzer.
 


         






    But, paradoxically, despite that imposing pedigree, and that of writer-director Steven Zaillian and an impeccable cast (Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini and Mark Ruffalo) this film's impressive accomplishments — and they are impressive — come against longer odds than you might think.
 
  That's because Zaillian (an Oscar winner for his "Schindler's List" screenplay) has given us an intricate, subtly rewarding narrative whose uncompromising nature and undeniable moral seriousness make it far from business as usual, even in the ever-decreasing world of quality Hollywood filmmaking.
 
  More daring still, this film makes few concessions to the audience in terms of conventional emotional satisfaction. Unlike the 1949 Robert Rossen version (which was nominated for seven Oscars and, in addition to best picture, took deserved acting honors for Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge), Zaillian's version is not concerned with offering sentimental handholds to make things easier for viewers to take. There is an austerity to his conception, but that ensures that the fate of the characters has a weight and a substance that stay with you well after the film ends.
 
  Although the 1949 film did not hesitate to do whatever it took to make Warren's book fit into the Procrustean bed of Hollywoodized melodrama, this "All the King's Men" was determined to stick as close as possible to the original source, a book whose plotting and characterization are nothing like the stuff that comes from standard screenwriting classes.
 
  For one thing, this is a big novel in every sense, and its massiveness is its strength, giving it a richness and subtlety only a nearly 700-page work with dozens of major characters could provide. For another, this is a narrative written by a poet good enough to have won two other Pulitzers for his verse. The book is rich, discursive, meandering and finely honed.
 
  Finally, this is a novel connected to history, to the story of Huey Pierce Long, one of the most provocative figures in American political history, someone whose rule Warren observed firsthand when he took a teaching job at Louisiana State University in 1934.
 
  Long was first a governor and then senator from Louisiana from 1928 until his assassination, and he was the founder of a Napoleonic dynasty whose power lasted for decades. Long, who had designs on the presidency, was considered "one of the two most dangerous men in the country" (the other being Gen. Douglas MacArthur) by Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 
  Long did an enormous amount of good for the poor people of his state, providing roads, bridges, free textbooks, hospitals and a university, but, wrote T. Harry Williams in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "in striving to do good, he was led on to grasp for more and more power, until finally he could not always distinguish between the method and the goal, the power and the good." After he was shot, Long's last coherent words were "God, don't let me die. I have so much to do."
 
  While "All the King's Men's" Willie Stark is doubtlessly modeled after Long, the novel takes pains to place the man in a complex fictitious personal drama that underscores the capacity to corrupt and be corrupted that is in all of us. That is what Zaillian does as well.
 
  True to the essence of its source and the poetry of its language, Zaillian's script has expertly extracted the core of this greatest of American political novels, a work that is both of its time and outside it. It uses great chunks of Warren's classic dialogue and hones the characters and the situations in a way that has inspired the actors to do exceptional ensemble work.
 
  But while both the novel and the 1949 film took pains to disguise the state Stark ruled, Zaillian and cinematographer Pawel Edelman place Louisiana front and center in the film. Exteriors were shot all over the state, and both the massive Capitol in Baton Rouge that Long built and the great seal in its lobby floor figure prominently in the narrative. Zaillian even cements the connection by adding a scene of Stark singing Long's theme song, the always provocative "Every Man a King."
 
  The writer-director has condensed the span of the story from more than a dozen years to five and, working with production designer Patrizia Von Brandenstein and her team, has also quietly and expertly updated the story from the 1930s to the late 1940s and early '50s. It is a '50s that, except for car models and women's fashions, looks very much the way the '30s did, telling us without words that this is a part of the country where things are not in the habit of changing very fast.
 
  Looking similarly lost in time is Jack Burden (Jude Law), introduced lying on his back and brooding. It's a not infrequent position, for Jack has the sleepy, complicit eyes of a former journalist cynically content to watch life from the sidelines, confident in his belief that "nothing's ever going to change." His boss, Willie Stark, has exactly the opposite philosophy, which is why they are attracted to each other.
 
  When we meet Stark (Penn), it is 1954 and he and Burden, his top aide, are in a speeding car in the middle of the night headed to a crucial political meeting with the influential Judge Montague Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) that the well-brought-up Burden feels would be more seemly in daylight. But, says Stark with typical bravado and drive, "ain't nothing a man can do and keep his dignity. The human frame just ain't built that way."
 
  The film then goes into an extended flashback that starts five years earlier, when Burden was a New Orleans reporter and Stark a small-town parish treasurer in the big city to meet sleazy political operative Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), perhaps the most malevolent movie fat man since Orson Welles' Hank Quinlan in "Touch of Evil."
 
  The story of "All the King's Men" revolves around Stark's rise from that unimpressive beginning to the governor's mansion. It's a story that involves the machinations of both Duffy and his hardscrabble associate Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson, putting her native Louisiana accent to excellent use), and it involves a transformation on Stark's part that demands an actor capable of playing both the before and the after. An actor like Sean Penn.
 
  For Penn turns out to be adept at calling forth all the aspects of Stark, including the earnest "Jesus come down off the cross" sincerity he begins with. Penn can play the intelligence hidden below the surface, the quiet moments before the storm. And, no surprise here, few if any American actors are better at playing the storm itself, the moment when Stark realizes Duffy and company have been deceiving him and lashes out in the speech of a lifetime. "You hicks, they fooled you too; it's time I fooled somebody," he screams from a makeshift platform. "I'm coming for them, and I'm coming for blood."
 
  Jack Burden is attracted to Stark in part because of the man's determination to do the most good for the many and in part because his own background is at the other end of the social scale. The well-connected Judge Irwin he and Stark are driving to see in the middle of the night turns out to be Burden's godfather, and he is intensely aware of the gap between his two worlds. "Graft," Burden tells his mother in a line that comes from the book, "is what you call it when who's doing it doesn't know what fork to use."
 
  Irwin is not the only person from Burden's past who figures in his present with Stark. His closest childhood friends, brother and sister Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet), reenter his life and touch off haunted memories of relationships that did not go as planned. They also ignite present-day crises that are at least as painful and possibly more dangerous. For it's inevitable that the old order and the new in politics will face off, and that Burden will be caught in the crossfire.
 
  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about "All the King's Men" is how contemporary so many of its issues seem. Not only the classic question of means and ends, the validity of Stark's insistence that "good can always be made from bad," but also the question of who if anyone in American life speaks for the poor and dispossessed, a question that was last raised, ironically, when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans.When Penn's Stark cries out to his constituency, "Your will is my strength, your need is my justice," he is striking a chord that may yet be heard again.
 
 
 'All the King's Men'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for an intense sequence of violence, sexual content and partial nudity.   

All the King's Men  dramatizes the rise and fall of a charismatic politician with a winning common touch whose good works are overshadowed by scandal and whose reputation is disgraced by impeachment. Ergo, a mention of Bill Clinton is hard to resist, even if the Clinton I have in mind at the moment is the then Arkansas governor who nearly derailed his political future at the 1988 Democratic convention, while the then Texas treasurer Ann Richards  the late, great  enhanced her career with a speech as rousing as Clinton's was stultifying. Because writer-director Steven Zaillian's version stultifies too, especially when compared with Robert Rossen's fiery 1949 Oscar winner. How could such dullness defeat the retelling, when Willie Stark is one of the most vivid characters in 20th-century American popular culture?
Robert Penn Warren, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel on which both movies are based, modeled his fictional politician after Louisiana's real, outsize governor Huey Long. Stark is a self-described Southern ''hick'' who marshals the votes of fellow hicks to rise from hayseed obscurity to great power. But having tasted that power, and having learned that bad can't easily be separated from good when it comes to politicking, the complicated Stark (motivated in fair measure by grassroots idealism) soon can't distinguish worthy ends from corrupt means. Emboldened by success, Stark's rage at the elites who used to mock him as a ''sacrificial goat'' overtakes him, and he becomes a monster even as he builds the people roads, schools, and hospitals. And having transformed his administration into something close to a dictatorship, he falls, a bigheaded Humpty Dumpty, at the hands of an inevitable American counterrevolution.
Sean Penn never has to go far to tap into rage. As a fledgling politician manipulated by political cronies (including James Gandolfini as a backroom power broker), his Stark tries a scene or two of humility, with his hair springing up from his head like wood smoke and his speech favoring a Dead Man Walking  drawl, about how he drinks orange soda pop because ''the wife don't favor drinkin.''' But clearly Penn is itching to segue into full-blown righteous apoplexy. Zaillian has said that he made a point of not watching Rossen's version, which is too bad  the filmmaker might have studied how to match the heat of the political cautionary tale with equally steamed-up personal subplots, something weirdly imbalanced in the new version.
Penn, on the other hand, appears to have done some viewing homework, cataloging the components of Broderick Crawford's blazing Oscar-winning performance before coming up with his own even more ornate personification of idealism twisted into demagoguery. Penn orates in gumbo cadences as he leads the crowd in a rally chant of ''Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up!'' (referring to those who would get in Stark's way). Meanwhile, all around him, Penn's costars retract in defeat. Most recessive of all is a daintified Jude Law as Jack Burden, the dabbling newspaper reporter of genteel Southern lineage who becomes Stark's staffer, his pawn, and the story's narrator. Tripped up by his own distracting Britishness, the actor has also been cheated of much of the steamy melodrama embraced by John Ireland in the original. Patricia Clarkson plays spin doctor Sadie Burke  a Mary Matalin before her time  with an unusable excess of refinement, and none of Mercedes McCambridge's riveting banked craziness. As Anne Stanton, the rich debutante drawn by Willie's magnetism and turned off by Jack's mildness, Kate Winslet likewise eschews the streak of fine Southern hooey previously displayed by Joanne Dru, at the character's expense. That Anthony Hopkins coasts with one of his lazily highfalutin' Welsh-accented Wise Elder performances as the tragically upstanding Judge Irwin captures everything screwy about casting big-name stars for their big names rather than their suitability, then abandoning them to solve (or be criticized for failing to solve) the problems inherent in those market-driven casting decisions.
Clinton operative James Carville is listed as an executive producer of this All the King's Men , and it's easy to see why the salty political pro would be drawn to the material. Why then scrape all the spice from the meat  serving, as Zaillian does, a movie of so much blander political and, for that matter, novelistic proportions? It's as if the producers feared audiences don't favor flavor.

 “All the King’s Men,” Robert Penn Warren’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel about the rise and fall of a demagogic Southern governor, may be a classic, but it is far from perfect. Diamond-sharp political insights sink into pseudo-Faulknerian hoodoo; plots and subplots entangle like kudzu on a riverbank; and some of the keenest American prose ever written keeps close company with some of the gustiest. “How life is strange and changeful,” Warren’s narrator, Jack Burden, philosophizes at one point, “and the crystal is in the steel at the point of fracture, and the toad bears a jewel in his forehead, and the meaning of moments passes like the breeze that scarcely ruffles the leaf of the willow.”  Doesn’t it though? The frequency of passages like this make the prospect of another screen adaptation of the novel — the first, directed by Robert Rossen, won three Oscars, including best picture, in 1950 — a welcome one, since a screenwriter is free to omit them and concentrate on a sweaty, sinewy tale of corrupted idealism and moral decay. It is not hard to see why Steve Zaillian, whose writing credits include “Schindler’s List” and “Gangs of New York” and who directed “Searching for Bobby Fischer” and “A Civil Action,” was drawn to the material.  Whatever its flaws, Warren’s book, a meaty stew of lurid Southern-gothic pulp and high-minded literariness, seems to provide the recipe for a grand, melodramatic prestige picture, the kind that can both flatter and titillate the audience (and the Academy) while providing at least a half-dozen actors the opportunity to thunder, strut, pine and wail. Lust, power, greed, betrayal, family secrets, dark sedans and crumbling plantation houses, a tremor of illicit sex and a glimmer of political relevance:  “All the King’s Men” has it all.  The problem may be that it has too much. Mr. Zaillian and his editor, Wayne Wahrman, having labored mightily to strain and reduce Warren’s messy gumbo, serve up a platter heaped with starchy, indigestible lumps. A squad of blue-chip performers — including Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Hopkins and Patricia Clarkson — sweat handsomely in their Depression-era clothes, illuminated by sunlight slanting exquisitely into dark-paneled rooms and smoky train compartments, while James Horner’s score blasts significance into every corner of the frame.  Nothing in the picture works. It is both overwrought and tedious, its complicated narrative bogging down in lyrical voiceover, long flashbacks and endless expository conversations between people speaking radically incompatible accents. Only Ms. Clarkson, who really is from Louisiana, and Jackie Earle Haley, who utters few words, manage to acquit themselves credibly.  It is rare to see a movie so prodigiously stuffed with fine actors, nearly every one of them grievously miscast. Ms. Winslet, bathed in light or veiled in gauze, looks nearly as dazed as Mr. Ruffalo. Mr. Penn, stepping into one of Broderick Crawford’s great blowhard roles, tries to reconnect Willie Stark, a self-described “hick,” with his rustic origins, emphasizing the character’s diffidence and low cunning as well as his strutting arrogance. What is missing, though, is the full, Shakespearean measure of Willie’s charisma.  Mr. Penn is, fundamentally, an antitheatrical, naturalistic actor, whose great gift is his ability to convey inwardness. His narrow face, with its close-set eyes and thin mouth, seems closed in on itself. Expansiveness does not come easily to him, but Willie is the kind of populist leader who grows larger in public, where he feeds on the anger and adoration of the people.    Mr. Penn rants and shouts and waves his fist in the air — “Your need is my justice,” he bellows — but you never feel the galvanizing force of that essential connection, or the ebullient showboating that is its authentic form of expression. Mr. Penn is in some ways too fine an actor to play a country ham like Willie Stark.  And Mr. Zaillian does not seem quite sure what to make of the character. At its root Willie’s story has the simplicity of a parable, in which a crusader on behalf of the poor and marginal becomes a monster, blighting the machinery of government with graft and vanity and turning public works into self-aggrandizing monuments. In the film (one of whose executive producers is James Carville), Willie, originally modeled on the Louisiana governor and United States senator Huey P. Long, shows a passing resemblance to more recent political figures, from Bill Clinton to Lyndon B. Johnson to Hugo Chávez. He is a creature of high political intelligence, unbridled appetite and a vengeful eagerness to humiliate his state’s traditional rulers. Louisiana’s oil and gas, he declares, belong to the people, on whose behalf he builds highways, bridges, schools and hospitals. With him the era of big government is just beginning.  His rise is narrated — and to some extent propelled — by Jack Burden (Mr. Law), a blandly dissolute former newspaperman with deep family connections to the old aristocracy. Jack’s involvement with the governor leads him back into his own past —  in particular to a moonlit night when he went swimming in the Gulf of Mexico with the luminous Anne Stanton (Ms. Winslet) while her moody brother, Adam (Mr. Ruffalo), looked on — and also into conflict with the elderly judge (Mr. Hopkins) who was like a father to young Jack.  The entwinement of Jack’s life with Willie’s is meant, in Warren’s florid but nonetheless powerful telling, to be a Greek tragedy of modern Democratic politics. In Mr. Zaillian’s velvet-wallpaper version, neither the politics nor the family intrigue makes much sense. We hear much more than we see about both Willie’s grandeur and his ultimate monstrosity, and never grasp the full dimensions of his personality, in triumph or in disgrace.  The camera likes to dwell on the skull-like face and half-concealed sidearm of Sugar Boy (Mr. Haley), the governor’s muscle, but these gestures of menace and foreboding seem as overdone as the leering glimpses of the showgirls with whom Willie sometimes consorts. And poor Mr. Law, an actor of lively wit, is once again asked to mope and maunder, and occasionally purple up the soundtrack with sighing narration.  The picture’s moralism is unconvincing, not only because current sensibilities are unlikely to be shocked by misbehavior in high office (or out of it) but more seriously because Mr. Zaillian’s conception of politics is sentimental and unreal, and his sense of history is ultimately that of a decorator, not a storyteller. Impassioned oratory is a fine thing, but Willie Stark knew that you had to get those roads and bridges built as well. Like an electioneering candidate —  which, given the incipient Oscar race, it is —   “All the King’s Men” makes a lot of promises but fails to deliver the goods.  “All the King’s Men” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some rough language, implied and actual violence and some hints of sexuality.

Overstuffed and fatally miscast, "All the King's Men" never comes to life. Despite location shooting and obvious sincerity, this second screen version of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel about a corrupt populist Southern governor not unlike Louisiana's Huey P. Long doesn't seem authentic for a moment, due to a glittering array of actors who look and sound like they've come from different ends of the English-speaking world -- which, in fact, they have. Absent any point of engagement to become involved in the characters, the film feels stillborn and is unlikely to stir public excitement, even in an election year.
Willie Stark (like Long) came as close to demonstrating the possibilities of a uniquely American fascism as any politician. The source of his power was Southern hicks, the poor, the disenfranchised, the resentful have-nothings on whose behalf Stark promised, if elected, to stick a pole through the rich ol' boys and cook 'em over an open pit.
Given some of their past projects and involvements, there's no doubt it's this almost always pertinent political component that inspired project originator James Carville, producer Mike Medavoy and writer-director Steve Zaillian to want to remake a film that won the Oscar for best picture; indeed, it's the only reason there could be to get excited about such a venture.
All the greater the disappointment, then, that this long-delayed production bears scarcely a pulse, much less the passion of its characters and filmmakers behind it. Even the period seems uncertain: The story unquestionably belongs to the Depression era, when Long himself reigned. But the cars and a few other details look somewhat more recent, and one is astonished to learn at the end that the story has run all the way up to 1954. No doubt the rationale was to make the story seem less distant, and thus somehow more relevant, but the move does nothing but underline the film's imprecision and incredibility.
Stark, played with untiring ferociousness and ceaseless arm-waving and gesticulating by Sean Penn, is the poor farm boy and political small-timer paged by monied operator Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) to run for governor in a covert attempt to split the redneck vote and thus hand the election to the fat-cat incumbent. When Willie discovers this, his rage incites him to discover his true voice as an orator, publicly attacking Duffy along with all the other back-scratching Baton Rouge bigwigs.
The from-one-hick-to-another approach works wonders, and it's here, where Willie establishes his rapport with the people, that the film should soar. But we never see Willie mixing it up with the hoi polloi in any meaningful way, as Zaillian simply offers standard-issue reaction shots of unknown extras giving Willie the thumbs-up without, frankly, the kind of hee-hawing and "You tell 'em, Willie!" responses you'd expect to see.
Even before it gets this far, however, the film bogs down in the hushed, lugubrious narration of disillusioned newspaperman Jack Burden, who has gone on to work for Willie and is clearly fated to be buried along with his bottle of booze. 
Three of the seven leading roles are played by British actors; of them, Law is the only one to even attempt a Southern accent (strange, in that the Brits, beginning with Vivien Leigh, used to be so good at it). But he then chooses to speak as quietly as possible, in the likely hope that the inadequacies of his accent will be all but indecipherable.
As to the others, Kate Winslet, as the unconsummated love of Jack's youth, speaks plain old American, while Anthony Hopkins, playing a powerful judge in what could be called the Burl Ives or Charles Durning role, sounds as though he's from Louisiana by way of Wales and London.
To fit with Winslet, who plays his sister, Mark Ruffalo goes easy on the Southernisms as well. As for Gandolfini, well, you can take Tony Soprano outta Joisey but you can't take the Joisey outta Tony Soprano. Overall, high school productions of "Li'l Abner" make more concerted stabs at down-home authenticity than this picture does.
Shorn of the vitality and vulgarity that should course through the veins of any picture about politicians and newspapermen, especially in the setting and time in question, this "All the King's Men" plays out solemnly along the lines of a Greek tragedy, as Willie Stark becomes the epitome of the sort of power-hording, fear-inspiring, special-interests-favoring, thoroughly corrupt blowhard he had once attacked. This is supposed to be a cautionary tale about populism run amok, but it doesn't put the chill in you because the film never connects to real life.
Once Willie is installed in the governor's office, the pic tries to stir interest in a scam concerning the construction of a medical center that implicates Ruffalo's earnest young medic, whose sister, Jack's long-ago love, is having a secret affair with Willie. Climactic stretch involves Willie's attempt to avoid impeachment by forcing the ever-loyal Jack to dig up dirt on Hopkins' Judge Irwin, an old-school gent unalterably opposed to the governor's seamy ways. 
Denouement is impressive for having been staged at the '30s deco-style Louisiana State Capitol building that Huey Long built and where he was later assassinated. But the sequence becomes protracted and pretentious in its treatment.
The film is luxurious to a fault where it should have been dirty, sweaty and gritty. One rarely even feels Louisiana's sticky heat through the cool blues, grays and greens of lenser Pawel Edelman's palette. James Horner's full-blown mournful score further emphasizes the project's grandiose proportions.

According to its publicity, bringing Robert Penn Warren 's 1946 novel All the King's Men  to the screen again has always been a "cherished dream" of executive producer James Carville suggesting a lurking sense of payback frustration with the insubstantial legacy of the real populist Southerner Carville himself helped to elect president. But first, let's consider the project from the cheap seats, where it would appear to belong to Sean Penn. Let loose with what is remembered as a large, meaty, all-American role within a properly Pulitzered and still school- assigned mega-fiction (filmed already in 1949 and showered with forgotten Oscars), Penn goes for larger-than-life, wrapping his pinched frown around an unintelligible Louisiana drawl and swinging his arms like an autistic evangelist. (Maybe it's the hick-Eraserhead  hair, encouraging us to place this cracker politician somewhere between Penn's special kid in I Am Sam  and his obliviously narcissistic guitarist in Sweet and Lowdown .)
Character-wise, Penn is most effective at boiling pots with tight lidshe's an internal-combustion engine, and here the actor he strains to echo most is 1930s ham hock Paul Muni . A small man, Penn even tries to evoke the working-class blubber of the original version's star, Broderick Crawford  (and the character's model, Huey Long ), pushing out his belly and swaggering like he's got 100 more pounds to heave around than he actually has. It's a florid, vein-popping spectacle, trying too hard and, in the end, seeming to know little under the skin about dirt-poor Americans.
Even so, Steven Zaillian 's film is faithful to Warren in that it centers not on Penn's Willie Stark , 1930s redneck do-gooder turned corrupt Louisiana governor, but on his cynical, ethically vacant right-hand man Jack Burden  (Jude Law ), who narrates Stark's rise from small-time pot stirrer to party stooge to self-made demagogue to, finally, a people's leader easily given over to the dark side of legislative malfeasance and backroom skulduggery. Zaillian proceeds in typical adapt-a-big-book fashion, condensing, telegraphing, and boiling down drama into info bytes, amid far too much smoky backlighting and a James Horner  score that's so self-important you want to take out the timpani with a grenade launcher.
Law is no assetlooking rather sadly like John Ireland  (the actor who played the 1949 Jack Burden), he has little control over his accent and zero energy. Drowning his conscience in bourbon, Burden seems less despairingly snockered most of the time than simply uninterested. A Bogartian voice of dry fatalism, Burden is both the tale's spoiled innocent and Crypt Keeper, doomily recounting the descent into iniquity, his own and everyone else's, including strategistStark's girl toy Sadie (Patricia Clarkson ), Burden's lost childhood love Anne (Kate Winslet ), and her brother Adam (Mark Ruffalo ), an idealistic doctor suckered by Jack into Starkian service. Each suffers a dark night of the soul, or so it's implied; Zaillian seems less concerned with making the novel's intricate political machinations clear than simply filling virtually every scene with crucifixes. It's hard to say why Stark is on the cusp of being impeached by the state senate or why the public opinion of Jack's retired-judge stepfather (Anthony Hopkins ) is a matter of political life or death that warrants a historical investigation consuming half of the film's screen time. But it's clear from the lurking crosses that there's plenty of damnation, retribution, and redemption to be dished out to all concerned.
As if the film had a ponderous- metaphor deficiency, Stark's hollerin'-governor press conferences are staged like fascist rallies, on the nighttime capitol steps. (Not that symbology wasn't availablethe film was shot in a pre-Katrina Louisiana that appears to be virtually devoid of black people.) Carville or not, All the King's Men  is something of a naive dinosaurfor one thing, populist preachifiers with hammerhead morals like Long were artifacts of the 1800s. Pitching a fit over the lost idealism of the American machine seems a little thin once you realize, as Carville surely has, that the Huey Longs were aberrations, and the massive scale of corporate wrongdoing easily overshadows, in cost and blood and influence, any governor's graft habit or blackmail schemes. It surely would be sweet to believe that American government would be a clean-running engine if it weren't for the scum-class four-flushers meddling with popular opinion and gaining access to the halls of power they didn't buy. Propagandist and elite-exceptionalist Walter Lippmann  would've approved of Warren's scenario, whereby the likes of bootstrap kid Bill Clinton  rising to the presidency is part of the problem, but George W. Bush  taking the same seat is just how things are supposed to pan out for scions of the industrial aristocracy.
