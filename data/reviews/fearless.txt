Call it "Jet Li's Wushu Retirement Party."
Li, long the overserious yin to Jackie Chan's comic yang, got his period kung-fu kick-start with 1991's "Once Upon a Time in China." Since then he's been in dozens of historical epics, swathed in silk and draped in torment. Betrayed masters, brutalized disciples, fractured clans, revenge a la carte. Sure, there have been plenty of attempts at modern fare ("Unleashed ," "Cradle 2 the Grave ," "The One " . . . ), but they've always seemed like an uneasy fit. Li's stern face works too well in a sepia-toned still, impassive yet ready to explode into action.
Thus ``Fearless," said to be Li's final martial-arts film. In many ways it's a reworking of ``Born to Defend ," his lone directorial effort. In the 1986 movie, his character fought for China's honor after World War II against various ill-groomed, oversize Westerners. With ``Fearless," the story is channeled through a historical figure, Huo Yuanjia , born in the late 1860s. Per the film's press notes, Huo was the creator of the Missing Fist style of martial arts and founde r of the progressive Jingwu Sports Federation.
As with almost every movie ``based on a true story," the facts and the fictional portrait diverge pretty quickly. In the case of ``Fearless," set at the turn of the last century, they occasionally go into extremes that wouldn't look out of place in a particularly baroque episode of WWE's ``Smackdown."
We first meet Huo (Li) at the start of a four-to -one match with (you guessed it) a series of mountainous foreigners. A British boxer, Belgian soldier, and Spanish swordsman -- each with his own colorful costume, dazzling hardware, and impressive facial hair -- take on Huo in turn. The matches are beautifully choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping and scripted with more than a little wit. When the Japanese samurai sword master (Shido Nakamura , who has a lead role in Clint Eastwood's upcoming ``Letters From Iwo Jima") steps into the ring, we snap 30 years into the past, to the beginning of our story.
Though the son of a martial-arts expert, little Huo has asthma and so is kept away from the Eagle's Claw, Monkey's Fist, and the other members of China's fighting menagerie. He learns in secret, however, and after his father is unfairly beaten in a public match, Huo swears to never be defeated himself. Years pass and our little boy has become Jet Li, whose sole ambition is to become the champion of Tianjin, his hometown. But c hallengers are everywhere, and as Huo's fame grows, shadows appear on his virtuous face.
The movie counts as a return of sorts for director Ronny Yu, still best known for 1993's ``The Bride With White Hair, " but now stuck churning out Hollywood product such as ``Freddie vs. Jason." Drama and humor, caricature and insight, romance and action are skillfully balanced, even as the film turns darker in its second act. Huo's fall comes with a costly victory against his last remaining rival, Master Chin. Tragedy follows, then a long voyage through the wilderness. While taking place in an idealized China that exists only in the imagination and on soundstages, there's some genuine pathos here, plus something approaching real acting from Li.
But is that what we're really here for? No. While showing his 43 years, Li is still capable of ripping his way through an ornate restaurant or clearing out 15 challengers in as many seconds. What he has a harder time battling are the film's digital effects, which range from inspired to laughable. The low point is a thrilling battle that's smothered with CGI in the middle going, almost to the point of incomprehensibility.
Thankfully Li fights his way out of that one, bringing the film and his martial-arts career to an honorable close. ``Wushu is not about winning, it's about discipline and self-restraint," Huo's mother tells him early on. The same could be said for Li.

 Whether or not Jet Li has retired from the martial arts movie, as he recently announced, “Fearless” may come to be remembered as a late specimen in a different genre: the China-as-underdog flick. For the moment, the notion of a Chinese freedom fighter defending the honor of his nation against a seven-foot Yankee muscleman named Hercules O’Brien (Nathan Jones) remains more or less credible. But tomorrow? Such narratives may lose their punch when China rules the universe.  Set at the turn of the previous century, as imagined through state-of-the-art production values (the film keeps one eye on old-school chopsocky and the other on new-school superproductions), “Fearless” breaks into three neat acts, each of them charmingly anachronistic. In the first, the legendary martial artist Huo Yuanjia (Mr. Li) aspires to be the champion of Tianjin street fighting. His hubris, however, leads to retaliation from a rival, and a tragic turn of events sends Huo into self- imposed exile in the country.  The following lovely, lyrical stretch of the picture is devoted to his spiritual rehabilitation (cue meditative farming montages), a resting of the muscles before they’re called back into service against the enemies of Tianjin. Naturally, Act 3 largely consists of Mr. Li meting Tumbling Fist, Eagle Claw Boxing and Righteous Indignation, against multiple opponents.  Ably directed by Ronny Yu, a veteran of Hong Kong cinema (“The Bride With White Hair”) who has taken unfortunate steps into Hollywood (“Freddy vs. Jason”) as well as sprightly ones (“Bride of Chucky”), “Fearless” sustains the tradition of ethically inflected Chinese action movies. Physical kinesis is inseparable from spiritual dynamism; the question is not whether Hou can beat everyone to a pulp,  but whether he can do so with proper discipline and honor.  “Fearless” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for virtuoso bone breaking.

Already ballyhooed as Jet Li's final picture featuring traditional Chinese martial arts (wushu), "Fearless" is a rather conventional costume biopic that still manages to pack a satisfying emotional punch by its final reel. A sizable hit since late January in East Asia, where it outgrossed such titles as "Crouching Tiger," "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers" in its opening frame, pic is likely to face a harder battle in the West due to its paucity of really eye-popping action. Focus Features' genre arm, Rogue Pictures, distribs Stateside Aug.�4.
Biopic of famed mainland martial artist Huo Yuanjia (1869-1910) -- founder of the Jingwu school that Bruce Lee was a member of in "Fist of Fury" (1972), and Li himself in the 1994 remake, "Fist of Legend" -- plays fast and loose with the few known facts of Huo's life.
Yet its almost old-fashioned, low-tech qualities (only a modicum of wire-fu and no flashy visual f/x), married to ultra-smooth production values, give the pic a refreshing sincerity compared with most of today's cynical, CGI-heavy actioners, both East and West.
That sincerity, which stems from Li's own background as a wushu artist, also chimes with film's theme of a fighter brought low by youthful arrogance but who reinvents himself as a champion of Chinese values in a rapidly Westernizing era.
However, as a grand final statement by Li on the art of wushu, "Fearless" falls short. Last-minute cutting by 40 minutes has robbed the picture of much detail of Huo's training as well as the styles and philosophy he espoused. Two thesps have also completely disappeared from the pic: Thai boxer Somluck Kamsing and action star Michelle Yeoh. (Kamsing's fight vs. Li survives in prints for the Thai market.)
Story begins in Shanghai, in 1910, as Huo takes on four champion fighters in a public tournament. After whipping three Westerners (pros Jean-Claude Leuyer, Brandon Rhea, Anthony De Longis), Huo gets ready for his biggest challenge, Japanese champ Tanaka (kabuki actor Shidou Nakamura).
Plot flashes back 30 years to Huo as a kid in Tianjin, northern China, where he's forbidden to train by his martial artist dad (Collin Chou, from "The Matrix" pics II and III), so does so on the sly. Flash forward 20 years, to 1900, and Huo is now bent on becoming Tianjin's numero uno fighter. Pic's first big set piece, a neatly staged contest on a vertiginously high platform, sees Huo victorious, though his best friend, Nong (Dong Yong), cautions him to ease up on the continuous fighting.
Li's outgoing perf in these early scenes -- with a gratingly brash delivery -- is very different from his usual restrained screen persona, and helmer Ronny Yu makes the most of the thesp's limited range by keeping the story moving and surrounding him with flavorsome actors.
At the halfway mark, film briefly turns much darker, as Huo's growing arrogance leads to the death of one master fighter and Nong's abandonment of him as a friend.
By-the-numbers plot then follows Huo as he travels to Southeast Asia, discovers humility among some rice farmers, tweaks the heart of a blind peasant girl (Betty Sun) and eventually returns to China a changed man. Fight vs. Tanaka closes the movie on an elevated note.
Though Li (now 42) looks far too old in the early scenes, he brings a quiet dignity to the latter half of the pic that's matched by Sun in the (basically cliched but surprisingly effective) Southeast Asian idyll and by Dong, who almost steals the movie as Huo's one-time best friend.
Fight choreography by vet Yuen Woo-ping is satisfying without being jaw-dropping and follows the retro trend pioneered by Tony Jaa in "Ong Bak" and "Tom-Yum-Goong." Tech package is highly confident and detailed, especially art director Kenneth Mak's burnished sets. Pic has a Western feel to its pacing and editing (by Virginia Katz and Richard Learoyd) that's very smooth, despite the last-minute shearing.

Jet Li 's "final martial arts epic" ought to be a treat for Hong Kong fans, and it is . . . for about half an hour. But when a nonsanctioned fight goes too far and brings terrible retribution down upon Li's Huo Yuanjia, he flees the city and goes into voluntary exile. So does the movie. Rescued at sea and brought to a farm, Huo (based on a real early-20th-century martial arts pioneer) learns how to be calm and engages in some tedious crops-as- metaphor-for-life nonsense. Li has come to worry that viewers weren't getting the right message about martial arts. But this is an action movie, and people don't come to be preached to; the Terminator  flicks also favored world peace but didn't pause the action for nearly an hour to rub it in.
