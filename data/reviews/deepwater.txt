 “Deep Water,” a fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy’s Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy.  The film follows Donald Crowhurst, who had “messed about in boats” but probably had no business entering the race, sponsored by The Sunday Times of London in 1968. Still,  Mr. Crowhurst got a press agent and an  investor, to whom he basically sold his soul, and was soon an underdog contender.  Trouble started immediately. His untried boat, fitted out with his own inventions, leaked and began to fall apart, leaving him with two options: He could turn back and face almost certain financial ruin or go ahead and face almost certain death. Instead he began lying about his progress. And he began to come unhinged. (“Now equal footing mermaids stop,” one telegram read.)  “Deep Water” makes haunting use of 16-millimeter film shot by Mr. Crowhurst and others in the race. There are also recordings of his voice and excerpts from his log, which goes from eloquent descriptions of his trials and loneliness to sounding a bit like Mr. Kurtz.  Again and again you want to shout at the screen: “Turn back. All will be forgiven.” This tale of risk, though, ends not with man conquering nature but in calamitous failure.  “Deep Water” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has dark themes and some mild swearing.

"Deep Water," Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell's carefully researched and well-written docu, covers a 1968 sailing race around the world, focusing on amateur yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, whose story contains more than enough drama to keep the tale on course. As it explores the limits of human endurance, the pic should suck even landlubbers into a whirlpool of gripping adventure, overblown ambitions and sheer human folly in its theatrical dates before the pic sets sail for video islands.
The project brings to mind the 2004 British mountain-climbing docu-drama "Touching the Void," a bald-faced but very successful recreation of a true story, which was showered with documentary awards while grossing more than $4.5 million at the U.S. box office. (The two films have a producer, John Smithson, in common.) Here Osmond and Rothwell stick to traditional docu rules -- they don't attempt to recreate scenes with actors. Notably, this story has a much less upbeat ending than "Void."
The filmmakers had a big advantage in being able to incorporate some startling material: the original tape recordings and 16mm films made by the solitary navigators while they spent more than 10 months alone at sea. In these intimate self-portraits, a great deal is revealed about the hoaxer Crowhurst and the mystic French sailor Bernard Moitessier, the two great eccentrics of the tale. A pity the latter is relegated to a supporting role, because his experience of finding his soul at sea would have made a compelling equal-time counterpoint to Crowhurst's prosaic concerns as his dream unravels.
Tension and suspense build right from the start as narrator Tilda Swinton describes how the Sunday Times decided to sponsor the first non-stop, single-handed round-the-world sailing race in history, after Sir Francis Chichester set a one-stop record the year before. While psychologists speculate on what effect such an endeavor could have on the human mind, the world's most experienced sailors gather in British seaports.
The dark horse is 36-year-old Crowhurst, a manufacturer of sailing equipment with a wife, four kids and major financial problems. Signing a devil's bargain with a local sponsor to finish the race or bust, he cobbles together a gadget-filled trimaran and sets sail long after everyone else has departed. Even if he can't win a Golden Globe as first man home, he still believes he has a shot at the cash prize for fastest voyage.
Within weeks, even before hitting the rough weather in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, his boat is leaking and falling to pieces. He realizes it would be suicide to continue, but financial ruin to turn back.
His solution -- at once brilliant, bold and totally dishonest -- is to break radio contact and bide his time off the coast of Argentina, waiting for his three remaining competitors to make their way around Cape Horn and New Zealand. He plans to join them on the home stretch as though he had made the same voyage.
This is just the first part of the film. Crowhurst's mental deterioration into his personal heart of darkness, documented on the film he makes, is played against his wife Clare's confidence in him as she waits with the children back home. Among the family members interviewed, Crowhurst's son Simon helps suspensefully recount the story, while Moitessier's wife Francoise describes her husband's unstoppable wanderlust. These two men convey something about the sea's grandeur and the way it grips the imagination, pushing them into very strange territory, indeed.
Tech work is top quality throughout, with a special nod to the music by Molly Nyman and Harry Escott (who together scored "The Road to Guantanamo") and to production designer Jane Linz Roberts for her detailed reconstruction of Crowhurst's ship cabin.

In 1968a year that seems surprisingly ancient when viewed through Deep Water 's faded, sleepy shots of English coastal townsthe Sunday Times sponsored a contest to see if a man could sail around the world, single-handedly and nonstop. There were nine entrants, from the well-known yachtsman Bernard Moitessier  to the astonishingly inexperienced electrical engineer Donald Crowhurst . Moitessier, who's as chiseled a Superman as they come, conquered the course easily, but just as he was about to glide into port and set a world speed record, he decided to renounce fame and fortune, turn around, and circle the globe again. Crowhurst, on the other hand, was a world-class bumbler; not only did he fall apart, but he managed to do it in as nutty and disgraceful a manner as possible. Realizing early on that his practically homemade trimaran couldn't survive the rough southern waters known as the Roaring Forties, he abandoned the race and spent several months drifting off the coast of Brazil, sending word to his sponsors that he was actually in the Indian Ocean . Things only got worsemuch worsefrom there. It would have been hard to squeeze a movie out of this Ayn Rand ian fable were it not for Crowhurst's own 16mm footage of his voyage, which the filmmakers found in a dusty BBC  archive. His efforts to film himself look like something you might see on Facebook , but they are haunting evidence of the toll that isolation and exertion can take on a relatively average guy from Somerset. Given that the tedium of months on the open seas could and did drive a man insane, co-directors Louise Osmond  and Jerry Rothwell  have done a commendable job of making Deep Water .  . . well, not boring. Part of their success lies in a canny decision to probe the psychology of Crowhurst's wife Clare, a sad-eyed Penelope who is infinitely more interesting than her sweetly incompetent husband. But they also pay keen attention to the blow-by-blow of the race itself, which unfolds as a practically mono-mythological journey. It's striking how disengaged these yachters were from the sociopolitical turbulence of the late '60s, perhaps because they knew the modern world no longer needed their heroics: They were setting out to conquer the seas a few hundred years too late to be legendary.
