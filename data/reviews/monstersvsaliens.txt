Back in 2007, DreamWorks mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg rather boldly stated that he intended to only release films in 3-D from then forward, making the studio�s Monsters vs. Aliens
 something of a gauntlet throwdown. While the flagship film�s effect happily does not induce the eye-crossing and stomach-turning so common to motion pictures� attempts to bully two dimensions into three, one would hope for an endorsement more ringing than �Monsters vs. Aliens
: Doesn�t give you a migraine!� We meet the pert, if unremarkable, Susan (voiced by Witherspoon) on the morning of her wedding to Derek (Rudd), whose vacantness is telegraphed in his job title of TV weatherman. (Curiously, we never learn how Susan spends her days; her ambition appears limited to a desire to see Paris � and really, who doesn�t?) Soon, an errant meteor pulsating with a mysterious substance signals ceremony-interruptus; Susan, in closest proximity, gets her DNA scrambled and morphs into a literal bridezilla by sprouting like Jack�s beanstalk some five stories tall. The government quickly whisks her away to a containment center, where Susan � now called Ginormica � makes reluctant friends with a whole host of monsters, which is where the film finally has some fun. The Area 51 residents include a half-man, half-cockroach, the product of a mad scientist�s self-experimentation (a deliciously acerbic Laurie); a lovable fish-ape hybrid called the Missing Link (Arnett); and, perhaps most winningly, BOB (Rogen), an amorphous Bicarbonate Ostylezene Benzoate so daft he tries to woo a plate of jiggling Jell-O at a backyard barbecue (he is, after all, technically brainless). The film filters the fantastical plot doodlings of those campy sci-fi classics of yore � the tin-can flying saucers and marauding 50-foot woman � through the modern formula for animated pictures (morality plays tempered by a chorus of wiseacres). It�s a shame the balance didn�t tip more in the direction of the former, because there is something rather dopily sweet in its story of a misfit band of monsters unleashed from quarantine to defend Earth from an alien invader. The misfits, as ever, must take a back seat to the morality, and the result � while in no way migraine-inducing � trafficks in rote truisms (love the skin you�re in; leave no man behind; etc.) that are admirable but perfunctory and leave no greater an impression than BOB did on that Jell-O mold.

If you have to see "Monsters vs. Aliens"  - and if you're a parent, you will have to  - make sure it's the 3-D version. The film's opening scenes deposit the audience somewhere in the middle of the rings of Saturn with a parsecs-wide vastness that is out of this world. Every kid in the screening I attended blurted out a stunned "Whoa," and so did most of the grown-ups: We were witnessing not just the beginning of a film but the start of the next phase of blockbuster-movie technology, like it or not.
The rest of "Monsters vs. Aliens," unfortunately, brings us slowly back to Earth. The latest computer-animated production from DreamWorks  - home of "Shrek," "Madagascar," and "Kung Fu Panda"  - is a perfectly acceptable family movie. The characters are cute even when they're ugly, and the script has the expected mixture of things going boom, gross-out slapstick for the kids, and arch pop-culture cross-referencing for Mom and Dad. My sixth-grade daughter and her little pal happily gave it a thumbs-up, and if that's all you need to know, go with God and Jeffrey Katzenberg.
If the movie's 3-D visuals are above-average, though, everything else just feels average, including the motley-crew story line that pits a heroine and her wacky friends against a silly villain. Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is a modest young woman in Modesto, Calif., who's about to be married to a vain twit of a TV weatherman (Paul Rudd). She's clocked by a falling meteorite outside the church and instantly transformed into a giantess, dubbed Ginormica by the US Army and spirited away to an underground facility somewhere in the desert. (Turn right at Area 51, I think.)
Her prison-mates represent a nifty cross section of 1950s movie monsters, names changed to protect the DreamWorks legal department. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a lab-suited mad scientist with the head of a bug (i.e., The Fly); the Missing Link (Will Arnett) is an egotistical gill-man (The Creature From the Black Lagoon); Insectosaurus is a grub the size of the Chrysler building (Mothra crossed with Godzilla). Funniest of all  - the best thing in the movie, really  - is B.O.B., a cheerful protoplasmic Blob with a brain of Jell-O and the raspy slobbo voice of Seth Rogen.
Susan/Ginormica, of course, is the 50-Foot-Woman, not in attack-mode as in the 1958 movie but crippled by low self-esteem (since all modern family movies have to stop and smell the empowerment). She gets her groove back when a four-eyed alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) sends his giant robot to Earth to seek out the rare element contained in the meteorite, which is now in her. Mayhem and the spectacular demise of the Golden Gate Bridge ensue.
It's not worth kicking too hard against "Monsters vs. Aliens," since it does its job reasonably well and its use of 3-D is superb, from the in-your-face moments (there's a sly shout-out to the paddleball man in 1953's pioneering 3-D film "House of Wax") to the larger use of space and spaciousness. The visual architecture of this movie has been thoroughly and imaginatively thought out, which is more than I can say for the flat script written by co-directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon with four  - count 'em, four  - others.
The bright, enthusiastic performances from Rogen, Witherspoon, Laurie, et al., put "Monsters vs. Aliens" over, not the dialogue that trundles along a well-worn family movie rut. Rudd displays none of his sneaky charm as the fiance  - turns out you need to see this actor to get the joke  - and the same goes for Stephen Colbert as the US president, who's drawn much funnier than he sounds, like a Mort Drucker caricature in a vintage '60s Mad magazine. In general, though, the animation isn't terribly impressive if you take away the 3-D; the monsters are fetchingly bizarre, but all the women look like Bratz dolls.
The big finale, with our monster heroes battling an army of cloned Gallaxhars, feels like "The Incredibles" stirred into "WALL-E" with a little Leni Riefenstahl on the side; it's hectic, noisy, effective, familiar. I wanted more, personally, or perhaps something elegantly less. Maybe we've been spoiled by Pixar's
 patented outside-the-box approach to digital family entertainment.
Or maybe that title just sets the bar too high. If a movie's called "Monsters vs. Aliens," don't you want to see more than five monsters  - one of them an attractive, if plus-size, woman  - and a lot more than one measly alien? DreamWorks has dreamed up a beguiling three-dimensional world, but it hasn't yet figured out exactly who to put in it.
.

Ginormica is a great name for a woman, regardless of her size. As it happens, the California girl so designated in the ginormically showy but super-average 3-D animated entertainment Monsters vs. Aliens  grows into her moniker the old-fashioned sci-fi way: Born plain old Susan Murphy (and voiced by Reese Witherspoon), she's hit on her wedding day with outer-space crud from a falling meteor, causing her to expand to 49 feet 11 inches tall. And although at first she's understandably flummoxed by the transformation, and really steamed when military types lock her up at a top secret government compound with a hidden society of other mutated freaks, the no-longer-plain-old Susan is actually in luck. For one thing, she's now got the figure to carry the skinny-leg-jeans look. For another, the sudden growth spurt saves her from an  ill-advised marriage to a self-involved boob. (The doltish groom-to-be, voiced by busy Paul Rudd, holds the classic punchline job of local TV weatherman.) Shed of her small ways, this wonder woman embraces her sky-high feminine power; she becomes a female role model to, yes, look up to.
Monsters vs. Aliens  is pitched to families; the cuddly drawing style is safely, un-scarily kid-friendly. (Never mind that kids, with their steel-trap memories, haven't forgotten that Pixar already covered the whole disgruntled ogre thing excellently well eight years ago in Monsters, Inc. ) But like so many animated projects welded in the DreamWorks Factory, the movie works hard  desperately hard  to be all things to all audience segments. And the visible effort erodes the sense of gaiety, of unfettered fun .
The portion of the adult audience with moviegoing memories that  extend back before R2-D2 roamed the galaxy will easily calculate that Ginormica is exactly one inch shorter than the giant femme who sought revenge on a loutish husband in the wonderfully awful 1958 sci-fi specimen Attack of the 50 Foot Woman . This same crowd will also note similarities to plenty of other famous 1950s and '60s-style B movies featuring monsters (irradiated and otherwise), aliens, and rudimentary 3-D effects. Ginormica makes friends with her fellow inmates, including the brainy bug-eyed Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie); a half-ape, half-fish Darwinian oddity dubbed the Missing Link (Will Arnett); and a one-eyed splotch of Blob -like blue goo called B.O.B. (Seth Rogen, happily recognizable even disguised as a...thing). There's also a wordlessly braying 350-foot grub from the school of Mothra  called Insectosaurus. Soon, the prisoners of this cartoon gulag are conscripted to battle an onslaught of Earth-attacking aliens, led by a cranky multi-eyed overlord (Rainn Wilson).
Monsters vs. Aliens  is trumpeted in promotional material as the first animated feature ''wholly conceived, developed, and authored in 3-D.'' (A team of three-dimensional humans wrote the script, which was directed by Shark Tale 's Rob Letterman and Shrek 2 's Conrad Vernon.) But the 3-D accomplishment is, in truth, a minor selling point. Is the plastic-glasses experience really any more engrossing or serious now than it was in the 1950s with novelties like It Came From Outer Space ? These eyes say no. The filmmakers will inevitably have more luck enticing Gen-X, Gen-Y, and Gen-Whatever ticket buyers  young adults who swear by Stephen Colbert and Pineapple Express . After all, this iPhone crowd gets to watch Rogen in genial, stoned-stupid Pineapple Express  mode, and Colbert himself  he voices President Hathaway, an American Commander-in-Chief who blends all the weak DNA of George W. Bush, Dr. Strangelove 's President Merkin Muffley, and, indeed, the blowhard host of The Colbert Report .
No one, though, is spared the film's constant ingratiating gobbling and repurposing of  humor, attitudes, and pop cultural references better appreciated in their original forms  and this is the smudgy DreamWorks fingerprint left on every animated comedy from Shrek  to Shark Tale  to Over the Hedge .  Monsters vs. Aliens  sacrifices soul and edge for safety and bland blue goo. Witherspoon's   willowy Ginormica would do well to make a break for freedom, leaving more than an  unworthy fiancé far behind.

 “Monsters vs. Aliens” cheerfully converts the two major sources of cinematic terror — invaders from outer space and inhuman, ungodly terrestrial creatures — into wacky, goofy, familiar figures. The movie, directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon from a many-authored script, comes out of DreamWorks Animation and offers the latest twist on the easygoing, parodic formula refined in the studio’s “Shrek” franchise and last year’s “Kung Fu Panda.”  Just as “Shrek” and its successors pushed aside the sweet enchantment of traditional fairy tale movies in favor of belching and winking (with a saving spoonful of sugar at the end), so does “Monsters vs. Aliens” turn fright and apocalypse into strenuous, noisy, 3-D fun.  The film, like “Coraline” and “Bolt,” tries to take 3-D technology beyond gimmickry and to make it the basis for a new kind of visual spectacle. Since not all theaters are equipped to show the movie this way, it has to work in its flat version as well, and perhaps partly as a result, the effects are often subtle, noticeable less when objects or characters jump off the screen than when they move laterally across it.  “Monsters vs. Aliens” is no better than most family-friendly animated entertainment, but there does seem to be more of it. Everything looks bigger and rounder. The environment is deeper and thicker. The blob of blue goo with one eye and Seth Rogen’s voice is more palpably, quiveringly slimy.  That blob, named B.O.B., is an entirely predictable supporting character in a movie like this:  the dumb one whose off-the-wall observations and behind-the-beat non sequiturs provide a steady stream of mild and easy laughs. Somehow Mr. Rogen, whose next live-action vehicle opens in a few weeks, keeps postponing the moment when we tire of him. His affable stoner vibe is the best thing in “Monsters  vs. Aliens.”  Though perhaps not in itself enough reason to see it. Don’t get me wrong: the movie is not terrible. On the contrary, it is a highly competent, smartly engineered delivery system for the very clichés it pretends to subvert.  The most surprising of these may be the romantic-comedy convention of an interrupted wedding, an apparent disaster that will of course turn out to be a blessing. This is because the would-be bride, Susan (Reese Witherspoon), is a charming young woman betrothed to a self-absorbed cad (Paul Rudd), whose eventual comeuppance provides a nice, sequel-enabling coda after the crazy action sequences are done.  These involve a battle between some monsters, including Susan — who, I should mention, has a mishap that makes her grotesquely gigantic, though since the movie’s sense of scale is wildly inconsistent, it’s hard to say just how gigantic — and what is technically only one alien, a many-legged, many-eyed intergalactic imperialist voiced by Rainn Wilson. San Francisco is destroyed, and a few other kind of cool things happen, but in spite of its striving for visual novelty,  the movie is curiously unmemorable, partly because nearly all of its humor depends on your having seen something like it before, even if you haven’t.  So in addition to Mr. Rogen’s dumb blob, there is a brainy scientist-monster (Hugh Laurie), a vain, macho monster (Will Arnett) and a speechless, fuzzy, gigantic monster that provides the film’s gratuitous hat-tip to the Japanese anime tradition.  These  earthbound monsters live in government-imposed quarantine, overseen by a general with a buzz cut and a drill sergeant’s bark, provided by Kiefer Sutherland. Everyone goes whirling through the air, fires off some wisecracks and generally has a good time. You probably will too, even if you feel a little cheated in the end.  “Monsters vs. Aliens” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some semiviolent action sequences with implied fatalities.  MONSTERS VS.

The concept is higher than the execution in "Monsters vs. Aliens," a funny enough animated faceoff between some famous monsters of filmland and would-be conquerors of Planet Earth. More congenial and less crass than some of DreamWorks Animation's big titles, this why-didn't-anyone-think-of-this-before dust-up involving one-of-a-kind mutants and space invaders boasts sufficient jokes and eye-popping action, especially in the preferred 3-D format, to more or less satisfy anyone attracted to the premise. All the same, that extra inspiration needed to truly knock this one out of the park is noticeably missing. Even if not as many 3-D venues are ready to show the film as Par and DreamWorks had originally anticipated, the heavily promoted picture looks to dominate commercially during the early spring, followed by outsized ancillary returns and a likely sequel.
"Destroy All Monsters!" is the mission of the hostile interlopers here, and it's also the title of the 1968 Japanese picture that had the bright idea of throwing numerous superstar behemoths together in one big monster mash. The brains behind the new picture, Rob Letterman (writer-director of "Shark Tale") and Conrad Vernon (director of "Shrek 2"), could have minted some fresh creatures for their battle of the titans, but instead they have drawn on some legendary sci-fi critters of the '50s to step into the breach and battle an enemy against which conventional armed forces haven't got a chance.
In a picture that could quite accurately be described as "�'Monsters, Inc.' Meets 'War of the Worlds,'�" the filmmakers flex their 3-D muscles right out of the gate with some nifty asteroid-belt vistas and, in a cutely self-conscious gag, having the first human character bounce a rubber-band paddle ball straight at the audience. With that out of the way, the pic gets down to the urgent business of sexy Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) having her wedding to preening TV weatherman Derek (Paul Rudd) interrupted by a crashing meteor. Infected by its oozy contents, Susan undergoes an alarming growth spurt, stopping just one inch short of the amazing 50-foot woman.
Not yet realizing her luck at having been saved from marriage to Derek, Susan gets tied down like Gulliver and, newly resplendent with striking platinum-white hair and a provocatively stretched and torn wardrobe, is spirited away to a top-secret prison for freaks who must be hidden from the general public. There's B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), an indestructible, one-eyed glob of blue who gobbles up anything; Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), a diminutive scientist with a bug's noggin; the Missing Link (Will Arnett), an ungainly humanoid/amphibian fusion; and Insectosaurus, a larval entity of indeterminate origin who's seven times taller than the female newcomer, now known as Ginormica.
Given that all these outcasts have been locked up for years under life sentences, they're a remarkably personable bunch, prone to jokes and a tendency to look on the bright side. As it happens, their optimism is justified; what's bad for mankind -- the arrival of an enormous, bullet-shaped robot (also one-eyed) with infernal intentions -- is good for the MonSquad. With the ineffectual U.S. president (Stephen Colbert) unable to conciliate with the aliens via the theme from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," the monster prisoners' Cold Warrior guardian Gen. W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) promises they'll be freed if they can defeat the seemingly impregnable enemy.
Setup is fine, as is the sheer spectacle of the outsized combatants stomping through San Francisco on their way to a showdown at the Golden Gate Bridge as thousands flee. But a host of minor issues, none of them too debilitating on its own, combine to create a feeling of moderate underachievement.
Because of the kid-friendly intentions, no one and no thing can die, which is a bit of a problem in either a monster or alien battle-picture. Since the human among the monsters, Susan/Ginormica, is far and away the center of the script's attention, the filmmakers' strain at giving the others anything significant to do is sorely felt; often, her monster cohorts seem as peripheral and uninteresting as the woodland critters that hung out with Snow White. These monsters have been neutered and, with the principal male humans (Derek, the president, Gen. Monger) all made to be vain and ridiculous, the film becomes an all-too-rote female empowerment story.
That said, boys and men of all ages will have little to complain about with Ginormica, who's a pretty hot number in the mode of her vocalist, Witherspoon; she's made deliberately sexy enough to feature in some James Bond-style silhouetted end-credits gymnastics. When she comes back home for a brief visit and Derek unceremoniously dumps her, guys will be lining up mentally to take his place with this Amazon, whose fate as a woman without a height-appropriate mate will have to await a sequel (which evidence indicates will at least begin in Paris).
Once the robot is vanquished, Ginormica and her crew must contend with its maker, the nefarious Galaxhar (Rainn Wilson, twirling a verbal moustache) who arrives on his sinister-looking spaceship with the attitude that, if you want anything done right, like taking over Earth, you'd better do it yourself. This megalomaniacal four-eyed squid can produce an unlimited army of identical clones and looks pretty unbeatable until the monsters creatively pool their talents.
"Monsters vs. Aliens" is a film of chuckles, smiles and light amusement rather than big laughs, galvanizing excitement and original invention. Because the characters based on the Blob, the Fly, the Creature From the Black Lagoon and Mothra have been transformed from threatening mutants into benign figures of fun, they possess marginal narrative usefulness, which stands as the picture's central disappointment.
Cast voicings and tech contributions are tip-top.


At the end of 2008, DreamWorks Animation  bossman Jeffrey Katzenberg  embarked on a cross-country tour, toting 20 minutes worth of Monsters vs. Aliens . The reason for his trek? To convince critics that 3-D movies are no longer the snake-oil salesmans hustle, but the future of filmmakingif not the very savior of big-screen cinema. Emotionally immersive, the prophet called it. The Last Word in the shared communal experience.
The five-year-old sitting beside me at a preview screening of Monsters vs. Aliens  last weekend offered his own endorsement not 10 seconds into the moviearound the time chunks of blown-up planet appeared to land in his lap. Whoa , Dad, he said. Awesome . The chorus of children around us agreed, as the theater echoed with giggles, squeals, and the random bleats of adolescent amazement.
Directed by Rob Letterman  and Conrad Vernon  from a screenplay written by more than half a dozen, Monsters vs. Aliens  will heretofore be known as the first 3-D movie to genuinely and effectively and astoundingly merge screen and theater, actors (well . . .) and audienceits The Purple Rose of Cairo   come to life, starring a gelatinous blue blob named Bicarbonate Ostylezene Benzoate . . . or B.O.B. It renders all previous comers headache-inducing charlatans, rinky-dink pretenders. For the first time in the mediums history, you are therefrom the presidents war room (shades of Dr. Strangelove) to a prison facility where the governments been storing assorted mutants and monsters collected since the 1950s.
Of course, such places, plot points, and predicamentsand the attempt to shove them and a red paddle ball in your facehave been around just as long; Monsters vs. Aliens  is a tomorrow very much indebted to movies yesterdays. B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen , nearly as genius a move as the 3-D) has slithered out of Irvin Yeaworth Jr. s 1958 Z-grade classic The Blob , but this time, the blobs a former ripe red tomato injected with ranch-flavored dessert topping, thus rendering him a shape-shifting stoner, a blissfully self-aware naïf with a crush on lime-green Jell-O . Will Arnett  voices the Missing Link, a defrosted ape-fish known for terrorizing spring breakers on Cocoa Beach  back in 1961; only the Link can communicate with Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall silk-snotting grub whos been exposed to nuclear radiation. The film even comes with its very own version of Vincent Price : Hugh Laurie  as Dr. Cockroach, the mad scientist who sports the noggin of a cockroach and the bwah-haw-haw  of his fiendish ancestors.
Reese Witherspoon  is more or less the films star: Susan Murphy  of Modesto , turned a lovely shade of glowing green by a stray meteorite on the day she was to wed an ambitious weatherman named Derek (Paul Rudd ), whos not terribly well-equipped to deal with a suddenly 50-foot-tall fiancée. The egomaniacal Derek, looking to make the move to bigger-market Fresno , cant live in a shadow that size. Which is just as well: Susan is woman, hear her roar as Ginormica, rounded up by the government and recruited to save the planet from the invading five-eyed blowhard Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson , who has turned being a self-aggrandizing blowhard into an art form).
Thats the story: alien-invasion camp commingled with yet another Dr. Strangelove  paranoia parody, strictly playbook material. DreamWorks kidult-friendly pop-culture mash-upsShrek   (as disposable as an episode of Best Week Ever  rebroadcast two years later), Bee Movie  (nothing more than a way-too-long episode of Seinfeld ), and Over the Hedge  (admit it, you forgot all about that one)banked the funds that paid for Monsters  R&D. They were stepping stones to the mountaintop: the ultimate interactive mash-up, the cinematic equivalent of what Nintendo  offered gamers with the Wii , the you-are-there experience.
Monsters vs. Aliens  was conceived from jump as a 3-D work, so every single plot point is tethered to the attendant visual bangthe waves of heat emanating from the militarys attack on a mountainous alien probe; the slabs of concrete falling off the Golden Gate Bridge  as it disintegrates into the bay; the armies of clones marching through Gallaxhars cavernous spaceship; the vast spaces of the Area 51 prison, which looks as though it reaches back a good half-mile.
But children who see the movie on DVD in a few months will wonder what happened to their roller coaster as it morphs into little more than a bumper-car ride. Take away the 3-D, and this is significantly more slight than, say, Madagascar 2  or Kung Fu Panda , DreamWorks movies that had to rely more on the clever factor than the wow factor. The chasm between Monsters vs. Aliens  technical accomplishment and artistic achievement is vast: The storys familiar, and as good as the performers are, theyre still doing their trademark shtick (though Stephen Colbert  as the President is a stroke of casting brilliance). But the grandeur of the effectsthe honest-to-God spectacle of the thingelevates Monsters vs. Aliens  to something approaching art. Its not a masterpiece, but its most certainly a milestone.
