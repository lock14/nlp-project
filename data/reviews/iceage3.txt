First, a clarification  for annoyed paleontologists everywhere: The makers of “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs’’ are aware that woolly mammoths and Tyrannosaurus rexes never actually shared time and space on our planet. But there’s a reason they team up in this 3-D sequel anyway. Dinosaurs are cool.
For those who need more justification, the screenwriters of this third installment in the “Ice Age’’ series offer up a stale and sketchy premise. Their story involves a lost world that plays out far beneath the frozen tundra, where lush tropical jungles somehow thrive, Jurassic beasts still roar, and the most menacing creatures turn out to be total softies once you get to know them.
“Dawn of the Dinosaurs’’ begins, as every movie in this franchise has, with the travails of a hapless, show-stealing, fanged squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge, director of the original “Ice Age’’). Scrat is forever enthralled with a prized acorn that keeps slipping from his grasp, but in this film his love for the nut is tested by a beguiling female. Their fiery romance, set to a Lou Rawls soundtrack, gives Scrat more screen time than ever; unfortunately, it’s largely wasted on cliches (he muscles her during a tango; she makes him rearrange the furniture) barely befitting an episode of “Everybody Loves Raymond.’’
Meanwhile, the official stars of the movie have their own tired tango to dance for directors Carlos Saldanha (“Ice Age: The Meltdown’’) and Michael Thurmeier. As mammoths Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) prepare to welcome their first offspring, Diego the saber-toothed cat (Denis Leary) contemplates leaving the herd to regain his predatory edge. The possums, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), bicker as usual. And lovable, lisping Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) bonds with a trio of dinosaur eggs.
When mama T-rex comes looking for her triplets and kidnaps Sid as well, Manny and the gang are plunged into an adventure that pulls them far underground, through the Jungle of Misery, over the Chasm of Death, across the Plates of Woe, right to the brink of Lava Falls. Their guide through all of this is Buck (Simon Pegg), a crazed, swashbuckling weasel with a leafy eye-patch and a Cockney accent. He’s a spirited and mildly funny addition to the cast, but he’s not a shining comet like Sacha Baron Cohen’s King Julien in “Madagascar.’’
That’s too bad, because “Dawn of the Dinosaurs’’ sure could have used something to grab onto. It’s mostly flat, despite being presented in 3-D, and the writing is so unimaginative that at one point a character yells out “yabba dabba doo!’’
There are a few stirring sequences, including a swooping flight aboard a pterodactyl. Subterranean landscapes are richly drawn. There’s also enough snarling peril (parents beware) to quicken the pulse of young viewers.
Yes, dinosaurs are cool. Just not cool enough to save this sequel.

The bar for 3-D animated movies has been set high. This year alone, the skewed demonic fairy tale Coraline , the pop-up-book clever Monsters vs. Aliens , and the wondrous and heart-lifting Up  make tough acts to follow. So maybe that explains why Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs  has a little trouble measuring up. After a sensational opening few minutes, in which Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel does high-flying battle with the squirrel he loves (all for a tasty acorn), the movie settles into a mode of nice, sweet, safe, and  sorry, I have to say it  slightly dull family fun.
Our glacier-happy regulars have been hanging out for so long now that they seem a bit jaded. Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah), the woolly mammoths, are set to have a baby, and Diego (Denis Leary), the saber-toothed tiger, is still a freelance grouch. Leave it to Sid (John Leguizamo), the lisping sloth, to discover three cuddly baby T. rexes, who lead them all to a viny green prehistoric jungle packed with dinosaurs. A fight with a massive carnivorous plant is neatly executed, and the whole trippy-fauna look of the movie is lost-world magical, but Dawn of the Dinosaurs  just isn't very funny. It lopes and slogs where the first two Ice Age  movies popped.

 I am not someone who insists that cartoons obey the laws of physics or stick to the historical record. The Acme Corporation will not deliver a home catapult kit to an unmarked mesa in the desert Southwest, and, “Up” notwithstanding, even a modest bungalow is unlikely to make an intercontinental flight propelled solely by helium balloons. Everyone is aware of these fundamental truths, and no one is likely to complain when they are flouted for purposes of entertainment.  But the idea that a hot, verdant land, populated by giant lizards and carnivorous plants, might have lain hidden beneath the glacial, prehistoric ice — I’m sorry, but that’s just idiotic. I don’t mean to sound like a 9-year-old or a dogmatic Darwinian, but really. Come on. T. rexes chasing woolly mammoths? “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs”? What? Dawn of the dinosaurs? In the Ice Age? You’ve got to be kidding.  I know. This kind of anachronism is trendy at the moment, what with “Year One” and “Land of the Lost” and “Star Trek.” But weren’t underground dinosaurs in 3-D already tried last summer in the abysmal “Journey to the Center of the Earth”? Couldn’t the creative minds at the 20th Century Fox animation studios, hoping to wring a few hundred million dollars more out of their prized family-animation franchise, have come up with something  more original?  Dumb question. The first two “Ice Age” movies were widely tolerated by adults and children alike, and while nobody has necessarily been clamoring to sample more prehistoric voice work from Ray Romano, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah and John Leguizamo, families who have recovered from the trauma of the “Transformers” sequel are unlikely to avoid this tired, loud little sequel over the coming holiday weekend.  The story, such as it is, concerns the expanding family circle of the mammoths Manny (Mr. Romano) and Ellie (Ms. Latifah) and their sidekick  pals. Ellie is expecting a baby, which inspires the envious sloth Sid (Mr. Leguizamo) to adopt three mysterious eggs he finds in a cave. When they hatch into cute little rambunctious baby dinosaurs, the whole crew — including the opossums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), ancillary, annoying comic sidekicks, just in case Sid’s energy should falter — takes a subterranean voyage into a land of biological diversity and creative desolation.  Not that stuff doesn’t happen. A new, nutty sidekick is discovered, a weasel named Buck, who has an eyepatch, the swashbuckling accent of Simon Pegg and the funniest lines in the movie. And though I might have dozed off, I think some important lessons were dispensed about being yourself, sticking together,  following your dreams and accepting the inevitable extinction of your species. Maybe not the last one, come to think of it, and since future sequels are likely, it would be premature in any case.  As in the previous installment (also directed by Carlos Saldanha), one element of “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs” manages to be authentically charming, and also to make moderately ingenious use of the 3-D techniques that otherwise just add to the jostle and noise. I’m referring, of course, to the dialogue-free sequences, unrelated to the main plot, that involve a plucky proto-squirrel known as Scrat and his quixotic pursuit of an acorn. This time Scrat is distracted by love, and he and his inamorata, who is also his rival for possession of that acorn, breath whimsical, inventive life into the movie.  They also expose its pointlessness and irrelevance. A collection of short Scrat films would be much more pleasing than the elephantine “Ice Age” series, though of course without the same commercial potential. But silliness and simplicity are, in the end, worth more than overblown dinosaur chases or cynical, recycled life lessons, and children’s animation does not require an extra visual dimension or additional celebrity voices as much as it needs an occasional reminder of the value of keeping silent.  “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some scary scenes of cute creatures being chased by predators.

With appreciably greater emphasis on action than its predecessors, and clever use of 3-D trickery to enhance storytelling as well as offer spectacle, "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" could prove the third time really is the charm by expanding an already sizable audience for a popular toon franchise. Fox may have taken a risk by positioning this latest series entry in the middle of summer season -- both "Ice Age" (2002) and "Ice Age: The Meltdown" (2006) were March releases -- but the gamble should pay off with beaucoup cold cash. Even more bountiful green will be harvested in ancillary outlets. 
Once again, the plot is propelled by the extended family led by Manny (voiced by Ray Romano), the lovably neurotic woolly mammoth, who looms large in an Ice Age environment that, in this latest adventure, appears to have recovered nicely from the "Meltdown" of the previous pic.
This time out, Manny is so busy attending to Ellie (Queen Latifah), his very pregnant mate, that he lacks sufficient time and energy to deal with the personal crises of two other returning "herd" members: Diego (Denis Leary), the saber-toothed tiger who now fears he's losing his edge after being domesticated; and Sid (John Leguizamo), the rambunctiously goofy sloth who yearns for respect and, if he's really lucky, his own family ties.
Eager to find someone, anyone, who'll look up to him, Sid adopts three baby dinosaurs hatched from eggs he's found. Trouble is, those eggs were the spawn of an enormous Mommy Dino who emerges from her stomping grounds -- an underground realm where supposedly extinct creatures are alive and well -- to retrieve her offspring. She also takes Sid back down with her, causing Manny, Ellie, Diego and Ellie's two precocious possum "brothers" -- Eddie (Josh Peck) and Crash (Seann William Scott) -- to follow.
Once the familiar characters are below ground, traipsing across a prehistoric landscape that appears equal parts "The Lost World," "King Kong" and "The Land Before Time," director Carlos Saldanha (returning from "The Meltdown") adds another colorful figure to the franchise's steadily expanding cast of characters: Buck, a swashbuckling weasel voiced with aptly madcap brio by Simon Pegg.
Long locked in an ongoing life-or-death struggle with a humongous albino dinosaur, Buck is more than just a tad mad. But that makes him all the more fun to watch during a series of exciting search-and-rescue sequences that are every bit as exciting as anything in any live-action pic on view in megaplexes this summer. Indeed, a high-flying encounter with rampaging pterodactyls might make the makers of "Star Trek" and "Wolverine" turn green with envy.
Even during those stretches where the pace isn't breakneck and the escapes aren't hairsbreadth, "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" impresses with vibrant CGI imagery and animation by the wizards at Blue Sky Studios. The addition of 3-D adds even more depth and detail to the mix, along with allowing the aud to enjoy the amusing illusion of snouts, paw, claws and beaks extending off the screen.
As was the case in the two earlier "Ice Age" toons, the vocal casting is excellent across the board. Romano and Leary are again standouts with their individual styles of sarcasm, but other returnees -- including executive producer Chris Wedge as Scrat, the hyperactive rat/squirrel who this time finds something even more attractive than that elusive acorn -- also are up to their usual high level.
Unlike many other contempo toons, "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is short on jokey pop-culture references aimed at grown-ups more than than small fry. But there is at least one funny allusion to "The Flintstones," and playful use of the old Lou Rawls standard, "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine," as everything from tango to comic counterpoint.

Though hardly landmarks of narrative or animation art, the first two Ice Ages  were warm and goofy and appealing; John Leguizamo 's adorably sibilant Sid the Sloth remains a much-quoted guy in our household. But as with Shrek  and countless other over-extended studio franchises, the well has run bone-dry. Part Three sends woolly mammoths Manny (Ray Romano ), a very pregnant Ellie (Queen Latifah ), and the rest of their cobbled-together family of misfits to a lush land below the ice that's fraught with dangerslike a burping purple plant that ingests foreignersand teeming with the endlessly marketable dinosaurs so carelessly dispatched in the first movie. However spuriously gussied-up with 3-D, this verdant underworld is a playground for animation geeks, but its narrative pull hovers around zero, unless you count the lame post-millennial jokes about helicopter parents and single dads doubling as single moms, and even those are nothing but an excuse to float a raft of cuddly prehistoric babies for audience tots and their elders to coo over. Even with the addition of an (obligatory Cockney) weasel (Simon Pegg ) to steer the herd through the usual slalom ride of hot lava and hostile beasties, there's no breathing life into a formula that ought to have bowed out gracefully while the going was good.
