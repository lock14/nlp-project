First let me soothe the jangled nerves of any purists in the house: Yes, Mamma Mia!
 stays faithful to its source material. By source material, I mean, of course, the hit theatrical show that strung together a bunch of ABBA chart toppers and shoehorned a pittance of plot in between a giggling spectacle of song and dance. Yup, the film adaptation of the Broadway adaptation of a catalog of Swedish disco hits retains all that is giggling and ups the ante with fodder for twitter, snicker, groan, and guffaw. This is astonishingly silly stuff, this musical about the soon-to-be-married bastard child Sophie (Seyfried), who invites to her Grecian isle wedding the three men she knows her mother, Donna (Streep), schtupped during the summer of Sophie�s conception. But it�s not like anybody�s trying to pass this off as anything other
 than silly � there�s a goddamn exclamation point in the title. Which isn�t to say that there isn�t much to quibble with here, like the apparent directive for someone � bride, bridesmaid, scullery maid, whatever � to dissolve into squeals at regular intervals, or director Lloyd�s apparent grudge matches with shot continuity and proper night lighting (it�s cool � she found lasting love with slo-mo instead). There are indignities aplenty heaped atop the cast (Welcome to Ham Town: Streep, in her blue romper, writhing in a lovesick throe atop �the old goat house,� and Firth, reduced in one of the final shots to just his bare, glistening torso cocked to the right of the frame). But to get back to that exclamation point: Once you accept everything it entails, there are fleeting pleasures to be had. Mostly known for TV work in Big Love
 and Veronica Mars
, Seyfried is a lovely find; she has the most accomplished voice in the cast and imbues a zero character with vulnerability and charm. The vets are fun to watch, too � especially Walters, as Streep�s spectacled, sass-mouth gal pal, Rosie, and the unflappable, frog-voiced Brosnan, as one of the maybe-dads. His first solo in the sneak screening was swallowed whole by the audience�s laughter, which might have stung had he not gotten a working vacation in Greece out of the deal, not to mention a nice tan and toned glutes from running up and down all those hillside cobbled steps. We get substantially less, but I suppose unbroken laughter � intended or not � and an hour-plus of air-conditioning on somebody else's dime will do. I could
 do without �Dancing Queen� stuck in my head, but that will unstick soon enough, and with any luck, so too will the memory of Streep noodling on an air guitar.



The tunes! The dancing! And Meryl Streep!! make 'Mamma Mia!' sing
Not even a week ago I was thinking about taking the rest of the summer off. I'd already seen it all. Indiana Jones limping out of retirement? The Hulk turning into Edward Norton? Space robots in love? Then something amazing happened. Meryl Streep jumped on a bed. She leapt over and over in the slowest possible motion, like a 12-year-old girl at a really sunny slumber party. After that she marched with Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and an army of Greek ladies in "Mamma Mia!" through the streets and down to the sea.
They're all village people. Yet they're singing ABBA's "Dancing Queen," and as much as my dignity tried to flee the premises, my heart wouldn't let me go. Watching these women line up on a dock - great actresses alongside extras - and liberate their bodies through "Sesame Street" choreography and mysterious Swedish songcraft, dignity seemed overrated. I was suddenly beside myself.
Even the banalities and dead slang of that chorus seemed like a feminist exhortation: "You can dance! You can jive!" I'll probably never be as happy in a movie theater this year. When the moment is over, there's every reason to think "Mamma Mia!" might be over, too. But the movie takes the ABBA jukebox musical that ate London, and is still eating Broadway, and turns it into a surprisingly sensuous experience.
The excuse for all this exclamation is the marriage of Sophie and Sky (Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper) and the bride's discovery that the father she never knew could be one of three men. She figures this out after reading the diary of her mother, a full-bodied American blonde named Donna (Streep). Donna runs a taverna and hotel on a remote Greek island and appears to have really enjoyed chronicling her erotic adventures.
Sophie invites the candidates - Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard - to her wedding, hoping one of them will disclose himself. Donna, meanwhile, has no idea what her daughter is up to. She assumes these three have randomly come to her villa, and she's overcome with guilt, desire, and a whiff of nostalgia, all of which are assuaged and abetted by pals Baranski and Walters - who, in the old days, used to back her in their girl group, Donna and the Dynamos.
It takes most of the movie and about 15 unstoppable songs for all to be revealed. The lyrics may be tangential to the proceedings, but that barely matters. "Mamma Mia!" is one of the few musicals that celebrates Top 40's colonization of our thoughts.
Director Phyllida Lloyd and writer Catherine Johnson have seen to it that their movie bends toward kitsch without breaking into camp. You need a gay sensibility for camp, and while the movie is certainly, in its way, gay, the guiding energy is robustly feminine, not as a matter of politics but as a principle of pleasure. When Streep writhes and rolls around on a goat house roof to the title song, it's not unlike watching a young Madonna do "Like a Virgin" in that wedding dress: comically orgasmic. Even Baranski - half-broad, half-drag queen - performs "Does Your Mother Know" like a woman who has chewed up and spit out her share of heteros.
The filmmakers have borrowed extensively from the exuberance of Bollywood rather than the slickness of Hollywood or MTV. And while some of the numbers use a lot of cartoonishness (people crashing through and falling off things, unscathed), the really good ones culminate in genuine emotional passion. The movie is emphatically sexual without ever crossing into lasciviousness. Why be lewd when lusty will do?
The arrangements for some of the songs are pure karaoke, and all the actors sing them accordingly: a little bit drunk. Some, obviously, are better than others. Baranski belts for the back of the house, while Walters, who's even better, always seems to be going for something more intimately deranged. At the other end of the bar, Brosnan, Firth, and Skarsgard seem afraid to razzle or dazzle, though a ton of cutting and odd camera angles save them from the worst of it in "Our Last Summer," which they and Seyfried sing on a boat.
Paternity is the film's big mystery, but it's the relationship between Sophie and Donna that gives the movie its emotional center. What Seyfried lacks in emotional range is compensated for in luminousness. You would never believe her as Meryl Streep's daughter, but she's definitely Donna's.
Indeed, Streep brings out the best in everybody. Singing "S.O.S." with her, Brosnan brays through the embarrassment to some sincerely angry place. (I was laughing, then I wasn't. It's the most convincing acting he's ever done.)
Yet the movie itself brings something new out of Streep. She looks like she's having a ball, rebuking Pauline Kael's 1980s put-down that she works only from the neck up. Now her arms and hips and feet are in on the act. She's connecting with an audience in a way she never has - grinning, eye-rolling, bouncing, and, at one point, looking right at us.
Even when wrapped in a scarf and scraping the outer reaches of her voice for "The Winner Takes It All," she's astounding, selling us a droopy ballad as a wrenching piece of opera. I'll remember that moment. But it's her bouncing in joy on that bed that I'll treasure most. It's an electric image that's been 30 years in coming. The greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star.


It's tempting to say that Mamma Mia!  has the worst choreography of any big-screen musical in history, though that would imply that what happens in the film is  choreography. The dorky flippered snorkelers who high-step down a sunlit dock to ''Lay All Your Love on Me,'' embarrassing as they are, can at least be accused of dancing. But most of the film's numbers consist of Meryl Streep , her two fellow feisty broads (Christine Baranski  and Julie Walters ), and a handful of other actors who can sort of sing cavorting on beaches with happy amateur glee, as if it were the first day of rehearsal and the director, Phyllida Lloyd, had tried to tune everyone into the ecstasies of ABBA  by declaring: Let yourself go! Create your own dance steps! Feel  the music! The film's lighting isn't much better. The Greek island where Streep's character runs a cozy-shabby hotel looks about as magical as Fort Lauderdale, and Streep has red-rimmed eyes even when she's not weeping with joy. The flat, stark too-brightness exposes that what we're watching is a piece of kitsch so syrupy it's like a lethal overdose of baklava.
And yet...there are the songs. If Mamma Mia!  didn't have the delectableness of ABBA's music  those percolating disco-pop arias of romance Bubble Wrapped in melancholy  we could toss it onto the trash heap of Hollywood musical follies, right up there with Xanadu   and Paint Your Wagon  . But Mamma Mia!  offers a sublime song every five minutes or so (''Money, Money, Money,''  ''Dancing Queen,'' ''Super Trouper''), and it is also, to be fair, far from unaware of its tacky coyness. On stage, the story of a girl who invites her mom's three ex-lovers from 20 years ago to her wedding  all to learn which one is her father  is vapid, but exuberantly vapid. It works as a delivery system for the joy of ABBA's music. The film, with its bland travelogue visuals and big-name mugging actors (Pierce Brosnan , Colin Firth , and Stellan Skarsgård, as the daddy suitors, compete to see who can shed his dignity the fastest  Firth wins by a nose), is too realistic. Lloyd, who directed it on stage , hasn't found an equivalent to the show's stylized sincerity.
Amanda Seyfried  is adequately sweet as Sophie, who craves  in addition to a father  a princess wedding. But as Donna, the free-spirited, second-wave-feminist mom who asks her two gal pals to the event, Streep is trying so hard to get off her pedestal, to play a woman past all glamour, that she declaims  every line (even when she's croak-singing), like a sailor on a bender. I never thought I'd see a film in which blowsy Christine Baranski is the most restrained person on screen. Yet let's give Mamma Mia!  credit: It's bad in so many ways, yet you can't say that these ladies lack spunk. Their what-the-hell moxie lights up the first girl-power musical to target girls over 50. (And just wait until Pierce Brosnan warbles ''S.O.S.'' You'll laugh. And then you'll be charmed.) I won't really defend Mamma Mia! , but I will recommend how to watch it: Just stop rolling your eyes and listen.

 Even those of us who habitually favor serious, austere, aesthetically correct drinks — single-malt Scotch, green tea, pomegranate juice, whatever — may occasionally indulge in a frivolous cocktail bedecked with fruit and umbrellas and served in a bulbous, sugar-rimmed glass. The next morning’s headache seems a small price to pay for the rush of cheap liquor and uninhibited conviviality. As long as you don’t operate heavy machinery or wake up in the wrong bed,  or operate heavy machinery in the wrong bed,  what’s the harm?  All of which is to say: Don’t be afraid of “Mamma Mia!” (That exclamation point, by the way, is part of the title, and it’s by far the most understated thing about the movie.) You can have a perfectly nice time watching this spirited adaptation of the popular stage musical and, once the hangover wears off, acknowledge just how bad it is.  Actually you don’t have much choice on either front. If you insist on folding your arms, looking at your watch and defending yourself against this mindless, hedonistic assault on coherence, you are unlikely to survive until the end credits (which may, by themselves, kill you all over again). Surrender, on the other hand, is easy and painless. It’s Greece! It’s bellybuttons! It’s Meryl Streep! It’s Abba!  See that girl! Watch that scene! If you change your mind, I’m the first in line. Mamma Mia, here I go again. Like me, you may have spent the last 30 years struggling to get lines like those out of your head — and wondering what they were doing there in the first place — but you might as well have been trying to compost Styrofoam. Those shimmery, layered arrangements, those lyrics in a language uncannily like English, those symmetrical Nordic voices — they all add up to something alarmingly permanent, a marshmallow monument on the cultural landscape. When our species dies out, leaving the planet to roaches and robots, the insects will beat their little wings to the tune of “Waterloo” as Wall-E and Eve warble along.  And the darn thing still won’t make any sense. Nor does “Mamma Mia!,” but that’s hardly a criticism. The story (by Catherine Johnson) is more or less an early Shakespeare comedy reimagined as an episode of “Hannah Montana.” The ingénue, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married on the sun-drenched Greek island where she lives with her mother, Donna (Ms. Streep). Sophie is the just-ripe fruit of a summer fling, with the complicating factor that Donna had three flings during the summer in question, and Sophie doesn’t know whether her dad is Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) or Harry (Colin Firth). But even though she knows them only as names in an old diary, she manages to track them down and invite all three to her wedding. Lo and behold, they all show up, as do Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters), old pals of Donna’s from the crazy days of her rock ’n’ roll youth.  Just when, exactly, those crazy days were is a bit vague. A song lyric refers to the “time of the Flower Power.” (Surely you remember the Flower Power!) But Sophie sure doesn’t look 40. At one point, Harry recalls the Johnny Rotten T-shirt he had back when he knew Donna, which is 10 years closer to the mark but still about 10 years off. Never mind. Abba is timeless: “The history book up on my shelf/ is always repeating itself.”  The real problem is that the director of “Mamma Mia!,” Phyllida Lloyd, seems have taken the unapologetic silliness of the project (which she directed onstage) as permission to be sloppy. Abba made some of the most highly polished, tightly engineered pop junk ever. There is a kind of perfection in some of those hits that is undeniable even if — or maybe especially if — you can’t stand to hear them. But in matters of craft and technique “Mamma Mia!” proves to be remarkably shoddy, a tangle of clumsy cuts, mismatched shots, bad lighting, egregious overdubbing and scenes in which characters appear to have been haphazardly Photoshopped into the scenery.  It is safe to say that Ms. Streep gives the worst performance of her career — safe to say because it is so clearly what she intends, and she is not an actress capable of failure. There is a degree of fascination in watching an Oscar-winning Yale School of Drama  graduate mug and squirm, shimmy and shriek and generally fill every moment with antic, purposeless energy, as if she were hogging the spotlight in an eighth-grade musical.  She is saved, and also upstaged, by Ms. Walters and, especially, by Ms. Baranski, whose cougar-on-the-prowl rendition of “Does Your Mother Know” is the one genuinely, show-stoppingly sexy sequence in a film that more often flails between forced cheekiness and unearned sentiment.  I know: I promised you a good time, and I’m describing a train wreck. But it’s hard not to share the evident delight of most of the performers. Ms. Streep overdoes it, yes, but you can’t accuse her of condescending to the material any more than you can fault her for taking it too seriously.  The impression left by the old pros who make up most of the cast is that they have nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to prove, and that worrying about dignity is for newbies and amateurs. So Mr. Brosnan bellows his way through a couple of duets, Mr. Skarsgard displays his tattooed buttocks, and Mr. Firth consents to appear in a spiked dog collar.  Ms. Seyfried has a harder time, though not for any lack of effort or talent. She has to work while the old timers are having fun, and to carry the picture’s unconvincing, flat-footed attempts at melodrama. Ms. Seyfried’s eyes are as blue as the Aegean and almost as wide, and her natural vivacity makes her performance seem almost authentic, but she’s not in a position to let go of her vanity and clown around.  It’s one thing to ham it up in a zany, messy musical if you’re the actual Meryl Streep.  If you have the desire (or the potential) to be the next Meryl Streep, the stakes are higher and the risks more pronounced.  But Ms. Seyfried, who has proven her skill on “Big Love” and elsewhere, is likely to emerge from “Mamma Mia!” unscathed. Really, this movie is incapable of harming anyone, except moviegoers with the good taste and bad manners to resist its relentless, ridiculous charm.  “Mamma Mia!” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual references and sexy behavior.

Take a Chance on Me� may be one of its most celebrated songs, but little risk is actually involved in �Mamma Mia!,� a predictably glossy screen adaptation of the Abba-scored musical. The pic uses virtually the same creative team behind the stage original -- topped by helmer Phyllida Lloyd, making her film bow -- but subs in bigscreen names like Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan for the leads and adds lush Greek exteriors. But the island-set tale of a young bride-to-be looking for dad offers little else that differs from the stage version and, since its grosses have exceeded $2 billion, why should it? To borrow another song title, Universal should reap reasonable �Money, Money, Money� in all territories.
The tuner shares a basic plot with the lesser-known 1968 Gina Lollobrigida starrer �Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell,� so offers a variation of the recent screen-to-stage-to-screen-again works as �The Producers� and �Hairspray.� One difference is the highly lucrative addition of a soundtrack featuring several No. 1 hits by one of the most profitable music acts in history. With each song inserted to capture a certain moment or emotion in the script, and with the script itself stretched to encompass enough songs to fit the perfect best-of compilation, the storyline plays out more like an oversized Abba promotional vehicle than a fully dramatic piece.
The opening scenes offer a preview of the over-polished, glitzy texture used throughout, as a series of moonlit postcard images introduce us to the Greek island where Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is set to marry heartthrob Sky (Dominic Cooper). 
Having never known the identity of her father, Sophie decides to invite three suspects --suave architect divorcee Sam (Pierce Brosnan), lonely but loaded investment banker Harry (Colin Firth), and roughshod world traveler Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). But Sophie doesn�t give warning to her ex-swinger mother Donna (Meryl Streep), who now runs a bed and breakfast atop the island.
Quid pro quo plays on for much of the pic�s first half, as the slightly bitter Donna -- accompanied by zany friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) -- attends to wedding preparations while reminiscing about the good old days when her trio, Donna and the Dynamos, rocked the scene. Meanwhile, Sophie plays an unending game of �My Three Dads� as she hops from one protective fatherly embrace to the other, unable to determine who�s the real one, and unwilling to confess her hidden agenda to Mom.
A prolonged, dance-heavy centerpiece features simultaneous bachelor and bachelorette parties where the entire cast, and all the subplots (including Donna�s re-emerging interest in Sam), converge in the type of chorus-line bonanza usually timed to wrap the first act with a bang. Yet on film, the scenes play more like �MTV Grind� than Busby Berkeley, with a roving camera breaking up the action into fast-cut singles.
The final reels are devoted to the wedding, set atop a dreamy seaside cliff (covered in one too many helicopter shots). After the truth is revealed, in what amounts to the film�s lengthiest dialogue sequence, the music kicks in for an extended showstopping finale that runs tirelessly through the stretched-out closing credits.
The singing-and-dancing work for the basic excitement and energy of a live performance, butan additional boost of cinematic prowess is needed to sustain a similar rhythm on film. Scribe-creator Catherine Johnson (also in her first screen outing) and theater-opera vet Lloyd can�t seem to find the right tone or style for their globally celebrated material.
Most of the chorus dance numbers -- especially �Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!� and �Voulez-vous� -- feel over-shot and over-cut, never allowing for the pleasure of a sustained, well-choreographed performance. Other, more intimate songs -- including the beach-set �Lay All Your Love On Me� and the cliff-set �The Winner Takes It All� -- feature a twirling Steadicam that does a better job of depicting the gorgeous coastline than the lip-synching cast.
Thesping is all-around pro, although some stars, especially the bouncy and rejuvenated Streep, seem better suited for musical comedy than others, including Brosnan and Skarsgard.
Despite the obvious time and energy devoted to smooth transitioning between studio and location scenes (both are shot realistically yet theatrically by d.p. Haris Zambarloukos), tech work often feels more rushed than mastered. Poor dubbing in some of the outdoor sequences tends to take away from the filmmakers� insistence that we�re actually there.


I've always enjoyed ABBA not in that post-hoc, so-bad-its good hip way, but innocently, the way I like Phil Spector . To this day, howling along in my car to that echoing, cascading, multiply overdubbed wall of sound makes me feel like a member of some dippy but joyous cathedral choir. So I was crushed to learn that the score for Mamma Mia!  isnt canned ABBAthe only way to enjoy those dumb-blonde lyricsbut ABBA covers, sort of.
Sure, its nice that the actors sing their own numbers and all that we already know from Postcards From the Edge  and A Prairie Home Companion  that Meryl Streep  has a fab set of pipes, and the fact that Pierce Brosnan  sings like a bullfrog in heat is used in the movie to adorable effect. But without all the in-studio bells and whistles, the tunes go flat and the words beyond silly, and the only time the music gets its due is when its paired with big production numbers, in those rare moments when Mamma Mia!  decides to be itself: a flashy, appealingly vulgar, tirelessly nostalgic pub crawl through a narrow street in 1970s pop history, when flower power turned to glitter rock.
Mostly, though, Mamma Mia!  is a collection of droopy ditties draped around a threadbare plot about the daughter of a single-mother hippie who secretly invites three meneach of whom might be her long-lost fatherto her Greek island wedding. Threes are the name of the relentlessly symmetrical game here: Sophie, the daughter (wide-eyed, pearly-toothed, vacantly smiling Amanda Seyfried ), is joined by two similarly dewy OMG-ing BFFs who serve as bridesmaids and help her rummage through her mothers 20-year-old diary for clues to her paternity. From various glamorous global locales come the candidates, three middle-aged men in a boat: Brosnan as Sam the businessman; Colin Firth , doing his usual endearing stiff as a pent-up banker; and Stellan Skarsgard , looking as though hed rather be anywhere but here, as a writer with unavailable written all over him. All three are conveniently unattached, which means nothing, nudge-nudge, to the self-sufficient female trio (Streep, with Julie Walters  and Christine Baranski  for backup) who play out the movies themes of regret, courage, and generation gap.
For all its half-hearted stabs at catering to the transatlantic youth market (with a little gift tucked in for the stage shows voluminous gay following), Mamma Mia!  is a (Shirley) valentine to fiftysomething, were-not-done-yet broads. The three fiftysomething British broadsdirector Phyllida Lloyd , screenwriter Catherine Johnson , and co-producer Judy Craymerwho so successfully courted that wildly under-served demographic in the smash-hit stage version of Mamma Mia!  came on board the movie with no prior film experience. They havent a clue, and though their screw-it-all ineptitude lends the movie a sporadically infectious gaiety, basically its a mess.
Like many theater types on their first outing in movies, Lloyd gets anxiously busy with a hyperactive camera, shooting from above, below, and upside-down, and scooting endlessly over the sparkling blue Aegean like a travelogue parody gone wild. Worst of all, she keeps homing in on Streep, who over-emotes with growing desperation as she tries to pull off serious character acting and a vaudeville turn at the same time. For all her girlish simpers and acrobatic splits, the actress in Streep inevitably triumphs. Though she has some touchingly wistful moments as a hippie mom trying to grasp her daughters reactive desire for stability and a fancy wedding, as a performer Streep is completely eclipsed by Baranski. With the legs of Cyd Charisse  and the arch wit of a sitcom sidekick, Baranski steals the show in a coyly filthy dance number with a corps de ballet  of pectorally gifted young blades, who show up elsewhere doing a hilarious routine with frogman flippers.
Its with moments like theseand the show-stoppingly sublime glam-rock performances by oldsters who know better but refuse to give in to their stiffening kneesthat Mamma Mia!  comes into its own and frankly takes ownership of what it is: a stage musical that made a big ol heap of money, shamelessly shoved onto the big screen to make a whole lot more. Given that the movie has no tale worth the telling, well see.
