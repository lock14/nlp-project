I have this theory that Bruce Willis, Nicolas Cage, and Kevin Spacey have one hairpiece between them and simply rotate it amongst themselves as needed. Call it rug-share. Since Cage obviously had dibs on the toupee for "Ghost Rider" (in which it sat atop his head like an angry marmot), Willis had to go without for the filming of "Live Free or Die Hard."
That's a good thing. Willis with hair means acting. Willis bald gets to blow stuff up. This is what you want out of a "Die Hard" movie, even one whose title makes it sound like they shot it in downtown Nashua.
New Hampshire license plates to the contrary, "Live Free or Die Hard" takes place along the eastern corridor from New York to Washington D.C., with a side trip to rural West Virginia. It's this national carotid artery the movie's computer-savvy bad guys want to shut down, by implanting one helluva interruption-of-service outage. Step 1 creates traffic jams and takes out FAA and Amtrak communications. Step 2 sows panic on Wall Street and blows out cellphones. Step 3 aims for the nuclear armory and the banks.
It's a "fire sale" in the words of the scruffy young hacker played by Justin Long ("Accepted," those annoying Apple ads), who the studio has cast so "the kids" will pay attention to daddy's action movie. That, however, means nothing to John McClane (Willis), the NYPD cop with the knack for being present at all attempts by effete terrorist geniuses to take over the world.
Someone here calls McClane "a Timex watch in a digital world," and the pleasure of the "Die Hard" series has always been watching this character keep ticking and ticking on his way to punching out his quarry with bare knuckles. The movies live for that moment when the uber-villain finally understands he just can't shake
 the guy.
In its bonehead simplicity, the original 1988 "Die Hard " remains one of the great modern action flicks, and 1990's "Die Hard 2 " was a worthy sequel: Both were state-of-the-art smackdowns delivered with craft and leavened with wit. The less said about 1995's "Die Hard: With a Vengeance ," the better. Arriving on the scene 12 years after that film and 19 years after the first, "Live Free or Die Hard" falls in the middle. You know how certain men show up at college reunions intent on proving they still have what it takes? So it is here. Better they should have called it "Try Hard."
Still, for the first hour or so, the movie's effective manly entertainment. McClane, in Philadelphia lurking around his estranged daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ), is rerouted to Camden, N.J., to pick up the hacker, Matthew Farrell, for questioning. Since the kid has inadvertently provided computer code to the bad guys, they want him dead; cue the first rock-'em-sock-'em action sequence. By the time McClane and Farrell arrive in D.C., the FBI's Department of Cyber-Security, headed by Bowman (Cliff Curtis ), is presiding over a governmental meltdown.
Everyone's running around the Washington Mall like headless chickens -- the terrorists have evacuated Capitol Hill with a fake anthrax scare -- but McClane just stands atop a stalled car and sniffs conspiracy on the wind. In many ways, he's a pretty representative American archetype: paranoid, truculent, plainspoken, and endlessly, inventively capable. The kind of guy willing to punch through a wall to get at a necessary gun, or to launch a car up a ramp with hopes he'll take out an enemy helicopter.
He does, of course -- you were expecting raised pinkies and Oscar-worthy dialogue? The "Die Hard" movies take place in their own blissfully illogical universe, where every bullet (and axe and rocket launcher) finds its mark except the one pointed at the hero. Even by those standards, though, "Live Free or Die Hard" sails into implausibility far too often.
It's one thing for McClane to run over a fire hydrant at the precise moment for its erupting jet of water to take out a chopper -- there's an absurd Rube Goldberg thrill to the bit. It's another for McClane and Farrell to drive for hours to a massive utilities plant in West Virginia and park outside the exact building
 where the villains are cooking up their next attack. Or for the hero to jump from a truck teetering on a ruined overpass to a pilotless F-35, land on its wing, and slide to safety.
And how can Farrell talk to a car's remote emergency-assistance operator when all satellite communications are down? "There's tough, and there's stupid," someone says here, and "Live Free or Die Hard" crosses the line too easily for even undemanding action spuds to tolerate. The "Die Hard" gimmick was always about an ordinary cop doing extraordinary things, but writer Mark Bomback and director Len Wiseman ("Underworld ") break the series' own rules in their breathless search to give us faster, louder, harder.
They bring on Kevin Smith , the "Clerks " director and, increasingly, an indie-cred muppet for studio movies, as Farrell's fellow badass hacker, but once you're past the initial joke (he lives with his mother), there's not much payoff. The arch-villain is a spurned government cyberwonk; Timothy Olyphant plays him as a metrosexual having a snit. Much better is Maggie Q ("Mission Impossible III ") as Olyphant's sleek second-in-command; she gets a frenetic kickboxing scene with Willis -- or, to be precise, his stunt-double -- that briefly raises the movie's temperature.
The subsidiary evil minions are the same old Eurotrash; McClane snaps them like twigs after they've performed their obligatory parkour
 (that building-hopping aerobic exercise featured in the opening scenes of "Casino Royale ") . Really, the only items missing from the movie's trend checklist are iPhones and fixed-gear bicycles.
But who goes to a "Die Hard" for hipness? These movies are and should be old school: One guy in an increasingly distressed T-shirt against the fiendishly-laid plans of evil masterminds. Willis knows the game, and the film's faults aren't his, but the insistence on pairing him with a kiddie hacker is a sign of the studio's desperation. So is the PG-13 rating, which effectively means only one "Yippee-ki-yay [expletive]" 
in the whole movie.
Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than "Live Free or Die Hard" does with an entire country.
Correction
: Because of a reporting error, the model of an F-35 fighter jet was misidentified in this review of "Live Free or Die Hard.")


         No one winces like Bruce Willis. A man with a million-dollar grimace, the actor gets lots of opportunity to play to his strength in "Live Free or Die Hard," the latest adventure of ultra-violent Energizer Bunny John McClane: He's not exactly cuddly but he keeps on coming on.
 
  The fourth film in the "Die Hard" franchise, and the first  to snare an unlikely PG-13 rating,  "Live Free" has the New York City police detective falling out of moving vehicles, surviving multiple explosions, coping with crack teams of French assassins  and dodging missiles fired by a Harrier jet. All in a day's work for someone who insists he's a hero only because "there's nobody else to do it right now."
 


         






    Yet despite considerable odds, not only does McClane stay alive, his movie does too. Inevitable lapses in plausibility and an inflated two-hour,  nine-minute running time aside, "Live Free or Die Hard" is a slick and efficient piece of action entertainment, fast moving with energetic stunt work and nice thriller moves.
 
 Key in making this happen is director Len Wiseman, a veteran of action extravaganzas "Underworld" and "Underworld: Evolution," a man with a passion for physical stunts and the ability to keep the pace from lagging.
 
 Although "Live Free" has one of the most convoluted writing credits in memory — "screenplay by Mark Bomback, story by Bomback and David Marconi, certain original characters by Roderick Thorp, based upon the article 'A Farewell  to Arms' by John Carlin" — the result is a shrewd, serviceable  premise that feels uncomfortably real.
 
 The notion, inspired by that Wired magazine article, is that the more we as a society have our essential systems run by computers, the more vulnerable we are to having those systems messed with by brainy bad guys intent on catastrophic results. While it seems as if  every third thriller these days has computers as part of the plot, this one makes them relevant.
 
 "Live Free" also has the advantage of a wide-awake Willis. An actor who looks to have sleepwalked his way through parts of his extensive filmography, Willis can be an effective force when he is involved, and being in the franchise that made his feature reputation has certainly concentrated his attention.
 
 Helping with that is the expert work of casting directors Deborah Aquila and Tricia Wood, who've surrounded the star with actors who are right for their parts. Whether it's Justin Long as McClane's computer savvy  sidekick, the deadly duo of Timothy Olyphant as the evil genius and Maggie Q as his mistress of martial arts girlfriend, New Zealand's Cliff Curtis as an FBI honcho or even director Kevin Smith moonlighting as a "digital Jedi" named Warlock, each performer noticeably  adds to the film's effectiveness.
 
  "Live Free" introduces McClane at his least heroic, in New Jersey having a spat with his teenage daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is so fed up with her dad she's changed her name and refuses to talk to him.
 
 Given that he's already in the Garden State, McClane's boss sends him to pick up a young hacker named Matt Farrell (Long) as part of a broader sweep to figure out why someone has hacked into the FBI's Department of Cyber Security.
 
 Wouldn't you know it, the bad guys  want young Farrell dead, and McClane just happens to have the inexhaustible supply of weaponry and bullets necessary to hold the evildoers at bay as he tries to figure out how to save the world one more time.
 
 That this implausible stew works as well as it does is in part a tribute to the unlikely but enjoyable rapport that forms between old school McClane and his youthful computer-savvy  companion. Given how many off-putting ways the part of an arrogant and brainy cyber-geek could have been miscast, it's a pleasure to see how engaging Long, known for his Apple Computer commercials, is in the role.
 
 "Live Free or Die Hard" tries hard to retain the spirit of the original films, to keep alive the notion that McClane, "a Timex watch in a digital age," is just an ordinary guy. The number of impossible situations he manages to get himself out of, however, makes that really hard to sustain, but it matters not. Anyone who says the reason he used a flying car to take down a helicopter was simply because he "ran out of bullets" has our  attention.
 
 
 MPAA rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, language and a brief sexual situation. Running time: 2 hours, 9 minutes. In general release.   

 Correction Appended  The gasping, grunting and oozing hard-body slab that muscles, and sometimes crawls, through "Live Free or Die Hard" sure looks like John McClane. Older if apparently no wiser, the blue-collar super-cop from the "Die Hard" franchise has lost his hair, his foul mouth and apparently his nicotine itch, but he still has the same knack for trouble, the adrenaline-pumping, cheerfully anarchic kind that causes cars to ignite, bodies to fly, eardrums to pop and hearts to race and gladden. He's also lost his sneer, but sneering is cheap,  and movies are expensive, especially when your star has pushed past 50  and slid off the power lists.  A lot has happened in the 12 years since Bruce Willis yippee-kai-yay-ed  in "Die Hard With a Vengeance" with a glowering Samuel L. Jackson in tow. During that time Mr. Willis's star has expanded and collapsed through hits and duds and plenty of personal off-screen noise. The world has changed too, of course, and with it the action-flick coordinates: for one, Arnold Schwarzenegger runs California, while the sober, nonwisecracking likes of Matt Damon's Bourne rules the  bad-boy roost. For another: Mr. Willis has become an increasingly  appealing character actor, the kind who punches up a scene or two ("Alpha Dog," "Fast Food Nation") or an entire movie ("16 Blocks"), mostly by playing it not so nice and very easy.  Life or age or something has mellowed Mr. Willis. He no longer enters a movie like God's gift, as he did almost two decades ago in the first "Die Hard," lips pursed as if he alone were in on the joke — which, given the fat salary he was earning, perhaps he was. In "Live Free or Die Hard" he enters swinging, fist smashing through hard glass and sinking into soft flesh. He's making a point and so is the movie, namely that McClane (and Mr. Willis) is ready to earn our love again by performing the same lovably violent, meathead tricks as before. And look, he's not laughing, not exactly, even if the film ends up a goof.  An unexpectedly funny goof, at that, despite everything, including the mayhem and somewhat creepy plot. The screenplay attributed to Mark Bomback, who shares the story credit with David Marconi, has the whiff of multiple writers, as action-driven productions generally do. It originated with a 1997 story (dubiously titled "A Farewell to Arms") by John Carlin in Wired magazine about the potential for a cataclysmic, nation-crippling "information war," which mutated and stalled, picking up new writers and equally doubtful names ("WW3.com,"  "Die Hard 4.0"). Somewhere along the development line, the real world intruded, which is why the original idea about an information war now includes a plausible-sounding or at least not entirely outlandish hook to Sept. 11 — hence, the creepiness.  In most Hollywood action movies, references to Sept. 11 as well as to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are often tacked on or displaced, used for decorative flag-waving or scenes of torture. "Live Free or Die Hard" tries to engage the real world more directly than most studio-made fantasies, with  a logic-defying plot involving a disgruntled government security expert. That would be  Thomas Gabriel, who seems partly inspired by the counterterrorism expert Richard A. Clarke and partly informed by Bill Gates and is wholly played by the pretty  Timothy Olyphant, dressed in black and wearing  Maggie Q on his arm. Mr. Olyphant has many charms, but annihilating menace is not one of them. Mr. Willis nonetheless keeps any incredulity in check along with his sneer.  Despite its jaw-jutting title, with its evocation of revolutionary America and radical individualism, "Live Free or Die Hard" keeps a tighter rein on McClane, dialing down his man-against-the-world attitude to a low hum. He's still more or less alone, at least existentially, though, as per the action playbook, he quickly picks up a sidekick and audience surrogate in the hacker impersonated  by Justin Long (flicking between annoyance and amusement).  But McClane is also unequivocally playing for team America, helping the F.B.I. and its no-nonsense, supremely capable deputy director,  Bowman (Cliff Curtis), who runs  the sillily named cyber division with blinking monitors and scurrying minions. Heroic in deed and in acquaintance, Bowman knows to side with McClane, saving his contemptuous looks for the guy from Homeland Security.  Nothing on Len Wiseman's résumé — he previously  directed the two "Underworld" flicks, wherein the Goth kids really are vampires — suggests that he could wrangle both Mr. Willis and this new film's nerve-jangling action to such satisfying effect. At least on the second count he has received terrific help from a sprawling cast of stuntmen and -women (and the stunt coordinator Brad Martin), who do a great deal to advance the film's old-school mayhem. The use of Parkour during several fight scenes is particularly tasty, proving that when cinematic push comes to shove, the French, who originated this ultra-cool rough-and-tumble, which finds performers bouncing like balls from wall to wall, rooftop to rooftop and many hair-raising points in between, are definitely in the coalition of the willing.  "Live Free or Die Hard" is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Extremely brutal violence and mild obscenities.

It's the Luddite versus the techies in "Live Free or Die Hard," and guess who wins. Back for a fourth round after a decade on the sequel sidelines, Bruce Willis enthusiastically resurrects resourceful working-class cop John McClane as the unlikely opponent of computer creeps bent on bringing down a digital-dependent nation. Tone careens madly from serious peril to action camp and everything in between, but the sheer quantity of often outrageous stunts should help overcome franchise mustiness to entertain general auds and rack up solid returns here and abroad.
First two "Die Hard" installments appeared in 1988 and 1990 -- the third followed in 1995 -- meaning that those interested in reviving the series had to confront the fact that much of the target aud for such a picture wasn't even born when John McTiernan's original hit the screen. Fox, scenarist Mark Bomback and co-story writer David Marconi have responded in obvious and safe ways, pairing Willis with a scruffy young computer geek with an anti-authoritarian streak and an aversion to physicality (Justin Long), making the villains disaffected (and very attractive) Yanks rather than foreign religious fanatics, and tailoring the package for a PG-13 rating rather than an R, which is what the previous three entries received.
Helmer Len Wiseman, a musicvid vet with a certain following based on the "Underworld"  duo, plays up the incongruity of McClane being forced to confront the technical expertise of very 21st-century baddies who know how to shut down communications, data and security systems with the tap of a laptop key. 
When the FBI realizes its computers have been hacked into, McClane is assigned to haul in Matt Farrell (Long), a New Jersey slacker on a laundry list of suspects. Even this isn't easy, however, as French (!) assassins frantically attempt to take Matt out even as McClane endeavors to spirit him away.
In short order, the ultra-efficient culprits, led by ice-cold, black-clad tech genius Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), bring Washington, D.C., to the sort of standstill it hasn't experienced since "The Day the Earth Stood Still." After Wall Street is thrown into similar disarray, Matt sees that someone is setting off a "fire sale," a three-step plan to shut down everything in the country that's run by computer. 
While the government -- Homeland Security, FBI, NSA, the armed forces, police, et al. -- scrambles to figure out what to do, McClane tries to keep Matt alive at least long enough to reveal what he knows about the dastardly project in which he was an unwitting participant. At every turn, they are attacked by Gabriel's well-armed goons, precipitating numerous action scenes that are ludicrous on the face of things -- McClane successfully battles a marauding helicopter with a fire hydrant, then a vaulting car, and later rides the wing of a spinning fighter jet -- but so much so that they'll become the sort of audience talking points people will have to see for themselves.
Along the way, the anti-gov nasties also kidnap McClane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), making the battle "personal," in time-honored tradition.
All the "Die Hard" films have centered upon terrorists, but the ones until now dwelled in the pre-9/11 world; by avoiding contempo reality (there's barely a mention of it), new entry can legitimately be accused of evasiveness, even timidity. But filmmakers largely disarm this sort of criticism by recasting the film as a virtual action cartoon, one you can laugh at and even enjoy for the preposterousness of its propositions. Any doubts about how seriously pic is intended are dispelled in the third act with the arrival of Kevin "Clerks" Smith as the ultimate high-tech geek who humorously handles an overload of exposition and helps close the noose around Gabriel and his misguided cohorts.
Head shaven and still in fine shape, Willis has no trouble convincing that he's still capable of handling heavy action. Long's character spends so much time seeming desperate that thesp has little opportunity to give him other personality traits, leaving Matt a basically rote creation. Olyphant is all unruffled smoothness as the vengeful villain, while Maggie Q, as Gabriel's martial arts-proficient g.f. and Winstead as McClane's initially estranged daughter provide incidental hottie moments.
Set pieces' outlandishness notwithstanding, pic's physical aspects feel convincingly real.

Still an all-American bloodhound after all these years, Bruce Willis 's Det. John McClane  begins Live Free or Die Hard  sniffing around a Rutgers -Camden parking lot and busting the frat boy who's been trying to cop a feel off his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ). Oh, Dad! Since much of the ol' action hero's aging core audience is presumably tied down these days, the main duty this timefor Fox not leastis to serve and protect the kids. Can we get Kevin Smith  to play a "digital Jedi," joysticking for freedom in his mom's basement? Can we say Yippee-ki-yay, muthafucka  and still get a PG-13?
Of course there's a terrorist scheme in the fourth Die Hard ,  something about a spurned patriot's warped bid to expose the weakness of our hackable homeland securitybetter him bringing Armageddon, this white American says, than "some religious nut job" (and surely the studio agrees). But the real intrigue has to do with whether McClane"a Timex  watch in a digital age," per the lead baddie (Timothy Olyphant )can log in to 2007. This is nothing new for the geezer blockbuster. An arthritic Rocky Balboa  was sweating computer simulations of his slugging ability last winter, and before that Firewall  had Harrison Ford  climactically futzing with an iPod , of all things. (Meanwhile, governor Arnold, out of the multiplex but still serving his constituency via CNN , has been busy making California safe for hydrogen-fueled Hummers.) As for Willis, wasn't it nine  summers ago that he stubbornly fended off Y2K with jumbo drill bits in outer space (not to mention guarded daughter Liv Tyler 's virtue against the advances of frat boy Ben Affleck )?
Maybe McClane, in '80s action parlance, is too old for this shit. But at least he's blessed to have youth in tow, as his new partner is a twentyish hacker from Jersey who helped the villains get a virtual leg up before offering his one-man Geek Squad  to the detective in trade for protection. So as the bad guys (including a Demi-esque Maggie Q ) plot a nationwide blackout by computer, the digitally challenged McClane mans the old reliablespistol, CB radio, various motor vehicles, and what's left of his wit(s)while the kid (Apple  pitchman Justin Long ) remains exclusively in charge of code-breaking, which means he's often seen at a keyboard flipping his bangs and typing really fast. Would you believe these two don't get along at first? Alas, generational conflict here is reduced to a high-speed feud over the merits of Creedence Clearwater Revival : Driving the getaway car, McClane blasts "Fortunate Son" on the stereo ("Oooh, that red, white, and blue"), prompting the kid to declare, "This is like having a pinecone shoved up my ass." (Hello, PG-13!)
Suffice it to say we're far from the original Die Hard  (1988)now a model of restraint and even characterization, an action flick recently chosen as the best of all time  by EW . Where regular-guy McClane was afraid of air travel in '88 (!) and still getting his car towed two years later, these days, despite some 401(k) complications, he's possessed of the kind of superhuman calm that comes with a $20-million paycheck plus a sizable piece of the backend. Even the FX budget bows to the star's demands, as director Len Wiseman  (Underworld  ) duly diverts his July 4th weekend mayhem from pricey D.C. to rural West Virginia , where the power station that controls the entire Eastern Corridor still requires hands-on analog operation: God bless America. As much as any Rocky  bout (if not a Mel Gibson  film), the Die Hard  series remains predicated on the spectacle of its hero's battering. But Willis's newly cultivated Zen is such that swinging into the side of an elevator shaft looks no more fatigable to McClane than an intense session of Bikram yoga. (Under duress, Bruce just breathes through it.)
Where the first three Die Hard s are full-on disaster movies with towering infernos, crashed airplanes, and a Manhattan on red alert, the threat in the post-9/11 installment is virtual. The villains' craftiest trick is hijacking our cable news networkstweaking the ticker ("What if you dial 911 and no one answers?") and otherwise communicating through split-second snippets of presidential addresses from Ike through Dubya. (As per the movie's libertarian title, all commanders in chief are equally scary here.) The baddies' would-be panic-inducing broadcast of a blown-up U.S. capitol won't much rile anyone who saw Independence Day . And though McClane's young sidekick comes on like a junior Chomsky ("The news is completely manipulated!"), by now everybody knows that fear is little more than must-see TVor, at worst, can't-see  TV if there's a blackout.
Maggie Q's particular menace can be put down with another PG-13 quip (she's a "little Asian chick, likes to kick people"), but the trickier challenge in Live Free  is a familiar one to our listless hero: getting Lucy, like Mom in '88, to go by the last name of McClane. Whatever she decides, Dad is really going to have to live freer or die harder next time.
