The recipe for "Pineapple Express" is simple, if thoroughly bizarre. Take one writer-producer (Judd Apatow) and one writer-star (Seth Rogen) known for bright, raunchy hit comedies like "Knocked Up" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." Add one sensitive regional filmmaker (David Gordon Green of "George Washington" and "All the Real Girls") determined to have his Hollywood moment. Fold in that filmmaker's unexpected love of 1980s action trash; really indefensible stuff like "Tango & Cash." Roll it all up in a big, righteous Cheech and Chong doob and smoke it.
It'd be nice to report that the results represent a new kind of fusion cinema, or at the very least two hours of you-got-peanut-butter-on-my-chocolate inspiration. Disappointingly, "Pineapple Express" is less than the sum of its ingredients, even if it's still a good stupid time at the movies. The intentional sloppiness makes for a nice change of pace in a summer of gleaming superhero machinery, but, in the end, sloppy is sloppy.
The film's high point (nudge, nudge) is probably the all-stops-out performance by James Franco, heretofore best known as the cleanly pressed if psychotic Harry Osborn of the "Spider-Man" movies. Franco plays Saul Silver, a pot dealer who exists in a constant state of addled hippie enthusiasm. (The title refers to his latest brand of awesome herb.) His customer and sort-of best friend is Dale Denton (Rogen), a teddy-bear burn-out who has an actual job (process server) and girlfriend (a high school beauty played by Amber Heard, whom the movie introduces, then mostly ignores).
The first 20 minutes coast along on the fumes of Rogen's established likability and the surprise of seeing Franco playing Sean Penn's role from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." The dialogue consists of amusingly stoned riffage fed by a deep love of junk nostalgia: Eddy Grant's "Electric Avenue" on the radio, "The Jeffersons" on Saul's TV. This movie has the pop-culture munchies.
Then the plot kicks in: Dale witnesses a gangland rub-out by local drug kingpin Ted Jones (Gary Cole, looking appropriately Mr. Big circa 1983) and his lady-cop lover and accomplice (Rosie Perez). Dale and Saul have to go on the lam and figure out how to survive, which basically means they drive to the woods and fall asleep.
The movie won't let them be, though. Jones sends in a pair of over-caffeinated thugs played by Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson - Abbott and Costello doing a remake of "Pulp Fiction." There's also Saul's supplier Red (dorky mullethead Danny R. McBride of the recent "The Foot Fist Way"), who's sympathetic to the heroes even as he's selling them out to the bad guys. In one very funny sequence, Saul and Dale have an epic fight with Red that trashes his crummy little house, and the film suddenly seems as if it's breaking out of its own frame.
That scene effectively balances comedy and hellacious violence; other scenes, not so much. There are high-speed car chases and bloody shoot-outs, severed ears and shotgunned feet, all filtered through Green's indie-dozy sensibility, which in turn is filtered through Apatow and Rogen's smart frat-boy anarchy. That's too much filtering: The results are tasteless in more than one sense.
It is fun to see Rogen play at being the action hero, though, and his climactic punch-up with Cole is refreshingly ugly, the way fights are in the real world but rarely in the movies. Franco is consistently funny as a guy who doesn't find reality interesting enough to check in very often. Green even pulls off a few excellent sight gags, the most cheering of which involves Saul trying to kick out the Slurpee-covered windshield of a stolen police car at 60 miles per hour.
What doesn't work is the script's insistence that Dale and Saul strengthen their emotional bond over the course of the movie. Apatow's films have a thing for straight-guy romance - for the way buddies can fall out and make up - and "Pineapple Express" at times plays like "Superbad" with live ammunition.
That's finally one element too many. Guys, you're asking us to swallow a pot farce, a buddy thriller, an action parody, and a touching tale of two men on the run? You must be high.


Can Judd Apatow  be called a subversive force in Hollywood? If you believe so (and I do), you could rightly point to a handful of factors. The comedies he produces overflow with raunch  with dialogue so nasty it's downright skanky , and with skank-outrage behavior to match. In addition to being obscene as hell, his films are thrillingly and madly literate, a jumble of pop culture scholasticism and white-boy hip-hop jargon that is intricate enough to erase the line between stoopid and genius. And at a time when Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise can't be guaranteed to open a film, Apatow has created a revenge-of-the-nerds alternate universe in which an actor who looks like Seth Rogen  can become a movie star.
But there's an additional factor of subversion at play. Knocked Up   was just a glorified sitcom, but starting with the inspired Superbad  , and then with the underrated Forgetting Sarah Marshall  , Apatow has presided over movies that have no plots  that spill forward with casual abandon, wandering down blind alleys and turning those alleys into full-blown highways, which twist and turn with the rambling stoned logic of '70s movies. Pineapple Express   does that quite literally, since it's the tale of two happy, seemingly harmless potheads who get caught in a world of murderous crime. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server (he delivers subpoenas for a living), but basically he spends his days driving around and getting high, smoking the dope he buys from his trusted dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco ), a long-haired slacker in an ancient Jaws  T-shirt and striped pajamas, who is so perpetually blasted he can never see past the next moment. (This is either a state of wreckage or a state of grace, depending on your vantage.)
For a while, as the two sit around Saul's living room, trying out his latest shipment of a super-dynamite weed called Pineapple Express, the movie is amusing in a verbally dissociated, been-there-toked-that way. Rogen and Franco  make an amiably wacked comedy team  it's like watching a buddy film with Albert Brooks and Joe Dallesandro. But then Dale heads off from Saul's apartment, bag of dope in hand, and when he's parked in front of another dealer's home (it's Saul's supplier, in fact), he witnesses a murder. Before long, the two are being pursued by hitmen, cops, and God knows who else, and the film turns crazy and bloody violent  without ever quite violating its goofy stoner vibe. Pineapple Express  is a fitfully amusing tale of drugs and crooks and general dilapidation, but the more it goes on, and the loopier it gets, the less it connects with experience. It becomes Apatow's hash-bar version of a cynical action joyride.
The director, David Gordon Green, is the last filmmaker on earth one would have expected to work with Apatow  he's a creator of somberly beautiful and austere American art films (Snow Angels  , All the Real Girls  )  but he brings the movie his own loping, run-on style, which turns out to be a perfect expression of the stoner rhythm. Green knows what's funny about potheads: They're always trying to think, and act, straight. Saul is a sweet kid who worries about his "bubbe" (i.e., grandma), and Franco, through his slurry daze, makes him an amusing hipster-autodidact  he knows just how to hit a five-dollar word like trifecta . And the more weed Dale smokes, the more Rogen gives him a demented clarity. Dale, another of Apatow's sheepish man-kids, is dating a high school senior (Amber Heard ), which would be gross if the film didn't see it as a pathetic expression of arrested development. As Red, the supplier's middleman who becomes the comrade of our heroes, Danny McBride  is the McLovin of the group, with a quizzical cluelessness that hilariously shreds his pretense of ''danger.''
There's one excruciatingly funny sequence in which Saul, literally in the driver's seat, is cruising along at top speed, with his foot smashed through the windshield: the perfect stoned action posture. But as Pineapple Express  turns into a deranged vehicle of slapstick mayhem, with people getting smashed in the head with coffeepots, its charm begins to ebb away. The movie wants to be a jolly dope spree turned nightmare  just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that vicious thugs aren't trying to dismember you!  but it ends up subverting its own subversion, arriving at a place that can only be called conventional.
More Pineapple Express :   Comic-Con 2008: Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Danny McBride talk Pineapple Express

 In the tradition of Cheech & Chong, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Ricky and Lucy, Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Smothers and Smothers, Sanford and son, Spicoli and Hand, Bert and Ernie, Riggs and Murtaugh, cops and robbers, dumb and dumber, right brain and left, peanut butter and jelly, bong hit, roach clip and Snoop Doggy Dogg comes “Pineapple Express,” a stoner comedy that partakes of a gentle indie vibe before hitting the hard stuff for a major Shane Black-style blowup and meltdown.  If you think you’ve seen this movie before, you probably have caught its multiple inspirations. It was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who turned their adolescent agonies into “Superbad,” a charming smutfest about three hormonally freaked-out teenage boys. The two screenwriters have become major since then, in particular Mr. Rogen, who also starred in Judd Apatow’s family-values comedy “Knocked Up” and has recently lent his voice to one too many children’s movies. In some respects “Pineapple Express” plays out like a louder, nastier, more violent and ostensibly adult follow-up to “Superbad,” except that Mr. Rogen, who had a supporting part in the first film as a slacker cop, has moved far enough up the studio food chain to now take a starring role.  He takes that star role and, after some humorously offbeat dithering with his co-star, James Franco, runs so hard with it that you can count the beads of sweat flying off his increasingly bunched forehead. That’s too bad because the dithering proves to be his finest hour and the movie’s best reason for being. It’s then that the director, David Gordon Green, a regional filmmaker who’s been making a beeline for the mainstream (from the lyrical “George Washington” to the melodramatic “Snow Angels”), hits a sweet, sweet groove while Mr. Rogen’s pot patron, Dale, parties and, yes, of course, bonds with Mr. Franco’s dingbat dealer, Saul, amid waves of playful nonsense, some idle and sentimental chatter, brutal and funny slapstick and a mushroom cloud of smoke.  In doper-comedy tradition, the plot is the least of it. Dale, a process server who rattles around Los Angeles in his junker, chronically tuning out while tuned in to talk radio, needs to score, and Saul is happy to oblige. Alas, the primo marijuana Dale buys during the day — the Pineapple Express of the title — proves near-fatal that evening after he witnesses a murder and leaves a telltale roach behind at the scene. The killer, Ted Jones (the comically reliable Gary Cole), and his policewoman partner (Rosie Perez, unsmiling and unamusing), figure out the pot’s provenance and, like a murderous Hansel and Gretel, trace the smoldering breadcrumb back to Saul, which is how the laidback dealer and his client end up fleeing for their lives.  For a while, it’s all nice and easy and suitably mellow. Mr. Franco, something of a James Dean look-alike who appeared with Mr. Rogen in the cult television show “Freaks and Geeks” (a launchpad for Mr. Apatow, among others), has been best known for playing second fiddle to a superhero in the “Spider-Man” blockbusters. (Those sculptured cheekbones worked well for him in a cable biopic about Dean.) He’s delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It’s an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious.  That mood swing, which plunges Dale and Saul into violence with a whole lot of bad dudes (including generic Asians in ninja suits), guns and explosions, is startling, crudely choreographed and just the kind of big finish a dead-ended writer or two might come up with while searching for a third act and lighting up to a Steven Seagal flick in the wee hours. That sounds better than it plays, largely because Mr. Rogen, who will soon be wearing a mask in a Green Hornet movie, looks so earnest and unfunny when playing the hero. Mr. Franco happily keeps the stoner faith, as does Danny McBride, whose unfailingly polite drug dealer steals the show even as Dale and Saul, of course, of course, fall in brotherly love.  “Pineapple Express” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Extreme violence, generous profanity and copious marijuana usage.

Putting a violent spin on the "Superbad" formula (envelope-pushing raunch plus unexpectedly sweet affirmations of male friendship), "Pineapple Express" emerges as a fitfully funny, tonally trippy but not entirely satisfying effort from the Judd Apatow comic fraternity. Featuring Seth Rogen and a scene-stealing James Franco as two pot-addled losers on the run from a ruthless dealer, director David Gordon Green's first mainstream venture is an unruly, literally half-baked hybrid of bloody hijinks and stoner laughs. A well-earned R rating shouldn't keep auds from riding this "Express" train to a quick summer high, with endless potential for dope-enhanced viewing on DVD.
In a considerable departure from such melancholy mood-pieces as "George Washington" and "All the Real Girls," indie auteur Green here displays a thoroughly commercial sensibility that nonetheless benefits from his knack for tonal experimentation and strong visual sense. This is certainly one of the better-looking efforts to come off the Apatow assembly line, composed in crisp widescreen images by d.p. Tim Orr, whose poetic lensing in Green's previous films helped earn the director comparisons to Terrence Malick.
But production values are somewhat beside the point when the movie in question is more "Harold & Kumar" than "Badlands." Scripted by the "Superbad" team of Rogen and Evan Goldberg, this rambunctious paean to pot retains the trademark Apatow sweetness even as it careens from messy vulgarisms to even messier violence.
As chubby schlub Dale Denton, Rogen offers a slightly more presentable version of the chubby schlub he played in "Knocked Up." When he's not delivering court subpoenas or romancing barely legal high schooler Angie (Amber Heard), Dale buys weed from Saul Silver (Franco) -- a long-haired layabout who, in an amusingly protracted sequence of smoking and shooting the breeze with Dale, immediately wins over the audience with his affable, perpetually stoned demeanor and often hilarious non sequiturs.
While Dale tries to keep the relationship strictly professional, Saul likes his client enough to sell him some Pineapple Express, a high-grade form of marijuana so rare that, in Saul's words, "it's almost a shame to smoke it; it's like killing a unicorn." So rare, in fact, that when Dale witnesses a murder committed by evil drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and leaves behind a joint while fleeing the scene, Ted almost immediately traces the half-smoked doobie back to Saul.
Now on the run from Ted's goons (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson), Dale and Saul embark on a long, weird, pot-fueled odyssey that serves up plenty of slapstick antics and gruesome misadventures in between requisite bouts of male bonding. From a fierce scuffle with Saul's traitorous buddy Red (Danny McBride) to a mortifying first encounter with Angie's parents (Ed Begley Jr., Nora Dunn), Green repeatedly pushes druggy banter and awkward exchanges past the point of discomfort into full-throttle aggression; in addition to its many nasty instances of stabbing, shooting, groin-kicking and head-smashing, the pic offers perhaps the most graphic case of ear mutilation since "Reservoir Dogs."
Beyond that, neither the comedy nor the carnage warrant further Quentin Tarantino comparisons. Some choice lines aside, too much of the humor is predicated on the notion that watching others get high is inherently funny (unless the viewer happens to be in a similar state, it's not). And while its genre-blurring may seem audacious by studio standards, in the end, "Pineapple Express" still feels too safe, too constrained by buddy-comedy uplift, to have any real bite. Ironically, the stakes seemed higher, the test of the central duo's bond more wrenching, in the far less eventful "Superbad."
At the same time, the pic's feel-good aura is undeniably part of its appeal, rooted in the chemistry of its two leads. As the more rational, stressed-out Dale, Rogen makes a perfectly panicky foil to Franco, who delivers a hugely likable turn as a genial bum who's lonely at heart and loyal to the core. McBride also scores laughs as the corruptible but surprisingly resilient Red.
Pic comes saddled with a cautionary warning against pot -- specifically, its effects on the arrested male adolescents that will make up its target demo -- that feels both appropriate and a bit disingenuous. Aside from some playful scene transitions and a 1937-set prologue shot in lustrous black-and-white, the pro tech package shows little of Green's signature retro style.

On the surface, Pineapple Express  offers precisely what it advertises: a roll-'em-up, smoke-'em-up, blow-'em-up bromantic comedy from the freaks and geeks who have made Judd Apatow 's brand of stunted-man yuks a global franchise. Once more, Seth Rogen 's red-rimmed, half-shut eyes peek out from beneath his tousled Jewfro. No longer schlepping home electronics (The 40 Year Old Virgin ) or dicking around with a porn website (Knocked Up ), he's got a real job now—as a process server. It's a gig his Dale Denton  likes because it allows him plenty of time to smoke weed in his car, visit his high-school girlfriend, and play dress-up. (Dale pays homage to Chevy Chase 's Fletch by delivering subpoenas to a doctor while swaddled in surgical scrubs.)
Joining Rogen again, years after NBC flunked their Freaks and Geeks   in the midst of its one majestic season, is James Franco , once more cast as his pal and pusher. Franco's Saul Silver  is the world's loneliest dope dealer, who spends his hours giggling to 227  reruns and hanging with his bubbe  at the retirement home. He's a mensch, this one, offering the latest and greatest in marijuana hybrids: Pineapple Express, which smells "like God's vagina" and smokes "like killing a unicorn." It's this very strain of sticky icky that eventually lands the tandem in trouble, as Dale witnesses a murder committed by a dealer (Gary Cole , the master of deadpan dumbass cool) and a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez )—and leaves behind a roach that Cole's character can ID by taste and smell. In short order, the dopes are on the run, dodging bullets, wrecking cars . . . and falling in love with each other, as men are wont to do in Apatow productions.
But that's just superficial stuff, the noise and nonsense of a plot that's beside the point. Pineapple Express  is indeed a savvy nod to 1980s action comedies, down to the Huey Lewis  original that plays over the end credits. But its greatest achievements lie in the tossed-off non sequiturs, the pop-culture (and Scott Baio ) allusions, and the unexpected respites in the midst of all the bang-bang-boom. Though the screenplay was penned by Rogen and pal Evan Goldberg —the duo whose Superbad  was super so-so and super  long—much credit must also be given to director David Gordon Green , a heretofore beloved arthouse craftsman whose last few films suggested an ache to bust out of the indieplex.
The insertion of Green into the now-familiar mix transforms Pineapple Express  from the inevitable into the unexpected. Green and longtime cinematographer Tim Orr  don't act like they're making an action movie; as far as they appear to be concerned, this is an idyllic romance occasionally interrupted by fisticuffs, gunplay, or car chases—all of which are rendered with a realist's eye for detail, no matter how violently grim or glazed-eye goofy. The Pineapple Express  trailer had all the warning signs of a kingdom out of control—the Superbad  boys unleashed in a maddening haze of pot smoke, Cheech and Chong  locked and loaded. Instead, Green and Orr bring surprising elegance to the proceedings. A scene during which Rogen and Franco play leapfrog in the woods is textbook Malick—a wondrous, poetic detour in a film that's eventually nothing but left turns.
Dale and Saul begin the film as strangers who do little more than conduct the occasional business transaction. But in a film mostly bereft of women, theirs becomes a full-blown love affair built upon accidental proposals ("Imagine I gave you a handjob . . . got  you a handjob") that blossom into dry humping. Even their fights are foreplay, especially a brilliantly staged brawl pitting Dale and Saul against the dope-pushing middleman named Red—played by Danny McBride , who delivers gibberish with an authority's conviction. Three men who've never thrown a single punch in their entire lives brutally lay into each other, usually with a flick or kick to the nuts. The Rogen-Apatow collaboration has come a long way from the "You know I know you're gay" riffing in Virgin ; at last, they're out of the closet.
And don't be fooled by its head-shop appeal: Pineapple Express , like Knocked Up  but ultimately much, much better,  is a stoner's movie that ultimately decides it's time to put down the Bong Mitzvah (a water pipe purchased in Tel Aviv , natch) and get shit done. "We are not very functional when we're high," Dale tells Saul as they're on the verge of a more-or-less breakup; he dreams not of serving subpoenas, but of hosting a talk-radio show. The thought appalls Saul, who earlier was convinced that a car tuned to talk radio had committed suicide. But Saul has dreams, too: "I want to design septic tanks for playgrounds." At last, a Judd Apatow production worth memorizing.
