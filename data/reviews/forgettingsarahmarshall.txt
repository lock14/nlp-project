Written by and starring Freaks and Geeks
 alum Segel (Neil Peart! Yeah!), Forgetting Sarah Marshall
 has Freaks
 creator Judd Apatow as producer, which is rarely a bad thing. Apatow is, of course, the main mover behind recent hits like The 40-Year-Old Virgin
, Superbad
, and Knocked Up
 (and the clunker Drillbit Taylor
), and his particular brand of comedy is both knowing and sweetly perplexed, like a wise old puppy in a microwave. (It also, at times, borders on the non sequitur.) Apatow has, in the past few years, become a cottage industry unto himself, a postmillennial John Hughes, but with little (so far) of the increasingly strident precocity that Hughes evinced as his career devolved from the great (The Breakfast Club
) to the banal and beyond (Baby's Day Out
, the Home Alone
 films). Forgetting Sarah Marshall
, despite its instantly forgettable title, is the perfect vehicle for Segel, who thus far hasn't really found a comic niche to call his own. His regular-joe features make him perfect for "buddy" parts, but there's a wildly neurotic and needy gleam lurking behind that facial facade: Jack Armstrong via Droopy the dog. It's that semihidden male vulnerability � along with his ability to be utterly naked, literally, on camera � that makes his performance in what might otherwise have been a boilerplate romantic comedy feel so fresh and vital. (Not that
 fresh and vital, but still.) When creatively blocked television-score writer Peter Bretter (Segel) is dumped by his up-and-coming actress girlfriend (Bell), for whose CSI
-esque forensic show he does the doomy themes, he wallows in self-pity and then ships off to Hawaii for some heartbreak therapy, not realizing his ex is staying at the same resort with her new beau, smooth Brit-rocker Aldous Snow (Brand). The rest of the film often plays out as you might expect it to, but Segel, scripting himself, injects regular bursts of comic genius into the proceedings, including a giggly-weepy, ongoing gag about a musical version of Dracula
 (with puppets!) he's been working on in his spare time. Segel's Nick was always the most overlooked character in Freaks and Geeks
, a freak who just wanted to hang out and rock hard on his Rush-sized drum kit, amiably hapless but amiable nonetheless. Apparently, he's all grownup now, but thankfully not so much that he's unable to remain freaky when necessary.


The latest Judd Apatow hit, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' is predictable but still keeps you laughing along the way
The movies that come out of the Judd Apatow comedy factory are the real revenge of the nerds. In them the human male at his most woebegone manages to score with women who in the real world wouldn't touch him with a pair of tweezers. The heroes are pudges, mouthbreathers, loners, stoners - the average guy on a less-than-average day. It's a hell of a fantasy, and audiences of both genders seem to love it. (So why hasn't anyone made a movie about a schlumpy woman with dandruff attracting a himbo? Because it wouldn't make any money. Figure that one out.)
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is the latest factory product, and like "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," "Knocked Up," and "Superbad" before it, it delivers belly laughs that explode from the meeting of wit and shock. You've probably already heard about the bit early on when the main character gets dumped by his girlfriend right after he's come out of the shower, dropping his towel in dismay. The scene's rudely hilarious but painful, too; if you've ever been thrown over, that's exactly how exposed you feel. It's full frontal male masochism.
Star Jason Segel also wrote the script, so presumably he knows this turf. His character, Peter Bretter, is a Hollywood layabout who writes cheesy music scores for the hit TV crime show his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), stars in. Maybe they were a cute couple before she got famous, but the gap between her goals (a feature film) and his (wear the same sweatpants for a week) has become an abyss.
There's another man, too, a prat of a British pop star named Aldous Snow, played with creative weirdness by British comedian Russell Brand. Peter looks at this idiot rock god and knows he hasn't got a chance.
The early scenes, with the hero pinballing between revenge sex and wallowing, are funny partly because they're preposterous - the movie locates the massive guy vanity behind self-pity. Then "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" sends Peter to a Hawaiian resort that turns out to be the same one Sarah and Aldous are visiting, and the canned plotting begins.
Debut director Nicholas Stoller makes the pace brisk and the look tourist-generic, but the governing sensibility is that of producer Apatow: Keep things smartly scurrilous and surround the leads with oddballs. Peter's wires get crossed by a growing romance with Rachel, the resort's social director who's likably played by Mila Kunis ("That '70s Show") as a tomboy in a supermodel's body. The real fun, though, is on the sidelines, with character actors Jack Brayer (Kenneth on "30 Rock"), Da'Vone McDonald, and Taylor Wily shooting off their mouths.
Also present are Apatow regulars Jonah Hill (as a waiter obsessed with Snow) and Paul Rudd (as a brain-dead surfing instructor). The former is one-note, the latter blissfully comic; Rudd has made a career niche out of burying his matinee idol looks in riotous supporting roles.
That's the backward genius of the Apatow comedies - they cast character actors as heroes and relegate the handsome dudes to comic support. Brand rises to the occasion, making Aldous a genially snotty reworking of Brit pop-brats like Pete Doherty and the Gallagher brothers. He's a lout, but even his rival has to love him for it.
Segel holds onto our sympathy, too, even as Peter wistfully performs songs from his pet project, a Dracula puppet musical, to an appalled Rachel. A graduate of the class of "Freaks and Geeks" and a star of "How I Met Your Mother," he's all wrong as a leading actor - big and squishy and covered with moles. He knows there's nothing sillier than a large man crying like a little girl, though, and he degrades himself with soul.
Ultimately, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is ordinary in a way "The 40-Year-Old-Virgin" and even "Knocked Up" weren't. It doesn't push into interestingly taboo areas or renovate a tired genre as "Superbad" did to the teen sex-comedy. I'm not sure Segel wants it to. Still, there's a sadness in this actor's eyes the movie doesn't choose to get near. If we're lucky, maybe he'll do something with it someday.


Wrong as it is to objectify the male body, I'll make an exception for that of Jason  Segel in Forgetting Sarah Marshall . As anyone presold on the aptly classified  ''romantic disaster comedy'' probably already knows, the writer and star appears quite emphatically naked, from all angles, very early in the game: As struggling L.A. musician Peter Bretter, he's first seen toweling off at home, anticipating the arrival of his girlfriend of the title (Kristen Bell), a TV star in the magnificently named CSI -like hit series Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime . Peter is feeling frisky, but Sarah, very much the perky media professional, is feeling fed up with the guy after nearly six years of using him as a handbag-holding service at red-carpet events, and has a breakup on her agenda. It's a credit both to the vulnerability of the dumpee (and his refusal to make the business any easier for the dumper) as well as to Segel's love of the hilarity of discomfort that Peter remains altogether in the altogether throughout the kiss-off. Shocked and pleading for a hug from his departing blond cutie, his exposed man flesh looks all the more alien and ungainly when pressed up against his about-to-be-ex's clothed, compact form. Nakedness has rarely looked so...naked. And innately, universally comic.
As embodiments go, the Segel physique, a long, pale, uncooked dinner roll of a shape, is an apt one for the attractions of this very funny, very chewy, partially undercooked comedy. Indeed, with even more ferocity of purpose and Andy Kaufman-school fearlessness than that roly-poly Seth Rogen in Knocked Up  or noodly-oodly Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad , Segel embraces the destiny of male anatomy in yet another clever creation from the Judd Apatow Alumni Association; this one, too, speaks from the male heart (and other parts) in a language accessible to females. Yet it does so with a fresh yeastiness I haven't already seen in other Apatovian products. The droopy physical doughiness of the hero (and his fearless creator), with his hangdog posture and flatfooted walk, is key to his unlikely attractiveness. He's not a nerd, not a commitmentphobe, not an adult virgin in need of special handling or a stripling looking for experience. He's just a less-than-ab-toned man of pleasant musical talents (his dream project is a musical about Count Dracula, with puppets) and recognizable neuroses, at least temporarily on the wrong end of the relationship equation.
And he's got the breakup blues bad. Peter sobs, drinks, has meaningless sex (after which he sobs some more), screws up at work, and falls apart. And thus ''girlified,'' with all the expressed neediness more traditionally ascribed to the touchier-feelier sex, he takes the advice of his intermittently apoplectic married step-brother (indispensable SNL  player Bill Hader) to take a healing vacation in Hawaii, where flesh goes for braising. What are the odds that Sarah would be there too, at the same resort, accompanied by her new dude, a beaded, bangled, and tattooed British rocker with the perfect Blighty name of Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)? One hundred percent.
A dark-haired new woman helps Peter forget Sarah Marshall; she's a cat-eyed beauty named Rachel (Mila Kunis) who works at the hotel and is as magically unpretentious, easygoing, and attracted to the hurtin' Peter as Sarah is brittle and duplicitous. (In fact, Bell, from Veronica Mars  and Heroes , is excellent playing the tricky role of Hardass Girl to Kunis' more sympathetic Softshoulder Girl.) But Forgetting Sarah Marshall  really does forget Sarah Marshall, or at least puts her in perspective  her and all the Sarahs who mess with the heads of their Peters. For better, and sometimes for worse, first-time director Nicholas Stoller (yet another graduate of the Undeclared  Academy  will any feature-comedy maker today who isn't  please step forward?) lets the action shamble along, as  Segel and his co-conspirators riff on varieties of male bewilderment. 30 Rock 's Jack McBrayer plays up his rube-at-the-luau skills as a virginal newlywed who can't figure out which end of his lusty new wife (Maria Thayer) is up; Paul Rudd is priceless (yep, as ever) as a stoner surfer; Jonah Hill has a small, excellently cringe-inducing role as a suck-up to Aldous' rock godliness. Jawing about pop culture with typical School of Judd razor wit, these men might be giants. The rest of the time, they're merely hilariously mortal.

 One way to enjoy “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” — at least vicariously — is to think of the movie as the Judd Apatow Stock Company’s Hawaiian vacation. Those pasty-faced funny guys have been working awfully hard over the past few years, so who can begrudge them a few weeks of surf, sun, babes and fun? I don’t know if Mr. Apatow himself, a producer of this movie (the director is the first-timer Nicholas Stoller), went along for the trip. The members of his troupe who did managed to squeeze in enough work to placate the I.R.S., and also that segment of the audience, myself included, whose appetite for naturally sweetened raunch has not yet abated.  Jason Segel, author of the film’s screenplay and a fixture in Mr. Apatow’s universe since the television series “Freaks and Geeks,” takes his allotted turn as the romantic lead, which is to say as a slobby, goofy but basically decent fellow navigating the uncertain waters of modern sexual ethics. He does so at an island resort where the evening sun bathes the palm trees in honeyed light and imparts a gemlike sparkle to the Pacific Ocean.  Supporting Mr. Segel are some of the usual gang — Jonah  Hill as a waiter, Paul Rudd as a surfing instructor, Bill Hader as the brother back home in Los Angeles — and a few newish dudes (notably Jack McBrayer and Da’vone McDonald) stepping up to deliver YouTube-ready riffs on matters of eros and pop culture. (Politics, the actual YouTube obsession of the moment, doesn’t really exist in Mr. Apatow’s world.)  Not that everything is breezy and casual. “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” is, after all, a breakup comedy, and its overall jollity is streaked with some raw emotions, including jealousy, heartache and humiliation. A few minutes in, Peter Bretter (Mr. Segel), a composer who writes the music for a television cop series, is peremptorily dumped by Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), his girlfriend of five years, who is one of the show’s stars. Sarah has taken up with a louche, longhaired British rocker, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), with whom she escapes to the same vacation spot where Peter, after a montage of meaningless hookups, goes to heal his battered soul. An important axiom is thus established early on: To a single, gainfully employed man in Los Angeles, sex comes easily. Love, however, is hard.  Or complicated, anyway, which is not the same thing. Once in Hawaii, Peter meets — in addition to a beachful of amusing bit players — the friendly, dark-haired receptionist you kind of suspect will be Sarah’s replacement. Her name is Rachel, she is played by Mila Kunis, and she has, for purposes of symmetry, her own history of romantic trouble. But the bad boyfriend in her past may not be quite enough to establish the enabling conceit that a woman like this would be (a) unattached and (b) likely to fall for Peter.  Still, “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” does not entirely play by the established conventions of its genre. Its willingness to explore states of feeling and modes of behavior that tamer romantic comedies never go near is decidedly a virtue, though this same sense of daring and candor also exposes its limitations.  Speaking of which, the filmmakers forgo the cheap and easy thrill of female nudity, preferring the display of male flesh for comic effect. Ms. Bell, Ms. Kunis and Maria Thayer (as a voracious honeymooner in an amusing subplot) keep their tops and bottoms covered even when vigorously feigning naked passion. Mr. Segel, however, appears, near the beginning of the film and again toward the end, in his unclothed entirety, a spectacle that I must report did not entirely impress a quite vocal woman a few rows behind me at the sneak preview. Mr. Segel’s willingness to face the kind of criticism she voiced is surely to his credit.  So is his ability to display both Peter’s charms and his unappealing traits — he is a loose-faced, needy, ingratiating Labrador retriever of a man — and to orchestrate a comedy of betrayal and cruelty that rarely feels meanspirited. For much of the movie’s first half, Sarah seems to be a climber and a two-timer, cheating on her devoted, unglamorous boyfriend and then ditching him for an oversexed celebrity. But at least briefly the perspective is flipped, as Sarah, accompanied by illustrative flashbacks, gently and persuasively explains to Peter what a drag he was when they were together — what a mopey, self-absorbed loser.  Which, curiously enough, is what catches Rachel’s eye in the first place. Her attraction to Peter originates not in lust but rather in pity. Something similar happened in “Freaks and Geeks,” when Linda Cardellini’s character started going out with Mr. Segel’s  largely because she felt sorry for him. In that case, though, the girl’s point of view was much more central, and the shakiness of the ensuing adolescent relationship was both funnier and truer than this grown-up variation on it.  The Rachel-Peter romance is charming but not, in the end, especially credible or interesting. That the contrastingly but equally gorgeous Rachel and Sarah end up as rivals for Peter’s favor is likely to flatter the self-esteem — or at least feed the fantasies — of doughy, underachieving regular guys across America. Which is nice for them, us, whatever.  But the schlub-hottie pairings that have become ubiquitous on screen lately also reinforce a dreary double standard. Guys are permitted to be flabby, lazy emotional wrecks, but as long as they crack jokes, some action will come their way. Girls, ideally, should have a sense of humor — mainly so they can laugh at those jokes — but for the most part they should look good in a bikini and like sex (though not too much and not anything too weird). Maybe someday, though probably not under Mr. Apatow’s aegis, a relatively ordinary-looking woman will have a sex comedy of her own.  “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has crude sexual humor and full-frontal male nudity.

Reprising his successful "Knocked Up" formula of uninhibited bawdiness and chick-flick sweetness, with side orders of slapstick and showbiz satire, producer Judd Apatow looks to have scored another long-legged hit with "Forgetting Sarah Marshall." Crowd-pleasing confection sees the comedy auteur once again hooking up with fellow vets of cult-fave teleseries "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared" -- including, in this case, director Nick Stoller and scripter-star Jason Segel -- who are perfectly in sync with his snarky romantic-comedy sensibilities. Result is a film that, like "Knocked Up," should generate repeat biz among ticketbuyers and memorable homevid sales and rentals.
Peter Bretter (Segel), a beefy teddy bear with a sensitive streak and a slackerish attitude, is a genial underachiever who composes incidental music for a TV crime show toplining his beautiful girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). He's used to living in her shadow -- he holds her purse at premieres and photo shoots -- but he's unshakably certain of her love. So he's devastated when she ends their affair and takes up with Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), a slinky, self-absorbed Brit rocker.
Peter tries to lift himself out of his funk by flying to Hawaii for an improvised vacation. Unfortunately, he checks into the very same resort where Sarah and Aldous are enjoying a lusty holiday. Throughout the ensuing awkwardness of his extended stay, Peter gets emotional support -- among other things -- from Rachael (an attention-grabbing Mila Kunis), a hotel desk clerk recovering from her own heartbreak.
Peter also interacts with characters amusingly played by members of what might be called the Apatow Repertory Company: a genially dazed surfing instructor (Paul Rudd) and a starstruck waiter and would-be musician (Jonah Hill) who's desperately eager for Aldous to hear his audition CD. The rocker's lazily dismissive response to the latter will likely be the pic's most-quoted line.
There's lots of other funny stuff -- withering put-downs, nifty non sequiturs, seriocomic ravings, wisecracks that range from snappy to snappish -- in Segel's casually structured screenplay. Stoller, making his feature helming debut, keeps the pace mostly brisk, but he's also attentive to character development, particularly with two figures who, in similar comedies, might come off as entirely unlikeable.
Aldous may be suffused by his sense of entitlement, but he's arguably the most honest and self-aware person on screen, and Brand's performance is marvelously droll and controlled. Bell (late of TV's "Veronica Mars") executes an equally deft juggling act, so that Sarah often comes across as simultaneously treacherous and vulnerable. William Baldwin and Jason Bateman offer clever cameos as Sarah's co-stars in wink-wink parodies of primetime crime shows.
Segel makes an engaging impression throughout "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," gamely making himself the butt of many jokes that involve Peter's non-macho proclivities. (To paraphrase the old Four Seasons song: Big boys do
cry.) And in a bold move that bespeaks dedication to art or pride of possession (or both), Segel does the full monty no less than twice, in matter-of-fact raunchy scenes that gleefully push at the limits of R-rated acceptability.
Russ T. Alsobrook's attractive lensing of Hawaiian locales and Leesa Evans' witty costume design add to the pic's overall appeal.

Jason Segel  is responsible for two of the most cringe-inducing, hands-in-front-of-your-face moments in the recent history of television, both of which occurred during the sole season of NBC's Freaks and Geeks  . On the episode "I'm With the Band," Segel's bright-eyed burnout Nick imagined himself an arena-sized drummer behind his basement-bound 29-piece kit, where, clad in a KISS tee and green short-shorts, he'd jam along to Rush's "The Spirit of Radio" cranked through NASA -sized headphones. Only he couldn't keep the beat if it were on a leash, and he spazzed out during an audition, finally breaking down and accepting tearful defeat. Which was nothing compared to his behavior two episodes later, when he wooed Linda Cardellini 's Lindsay Weir  by sing-speaking along to Styx's "Lady." It's still a singularly heartbreaking and hard-to-watch scene—a garish, sincere spectacle.
Segel's character was created by Paul Feig  and nurtured by Judd Apatow , and the actor, an Apatow regular in such efforts as Undeclared  and Knocked Up , has more or less offered variations on Nick ever since—the huggable lug and/or schmaltzy stoner for whom no gesture is too outsized. The guy puts it all out there—and, like, it's all  out there, prompting Segel's recent explanation to Entertainment Weekly  of how to be properly turgid in an R-rated comedy.
It takes all of five minutes for Segel to drop towel in the new Forgetting Sarah Marshall : His character, Peter Bretter , is on the verge of being dumped by his longtime girlfriend, middlebrow TV actress Sarah Marshall  (Kristen Bell ), but she won't actually break up with him until he puts on some clothes, and so . . . he doesn't. The way Peter figures it, the moment he puts on some clothes, "it's over."
The scene elicits big, dumb laughs—That dude's naked, haw haw.  But there's also some sad, sweet truth to it that carries over throughout the movie: Absolutely, Sarah would have bailed on Peter the moment he put on his pants. So it's up to Peter, and his peter, to stand there as long as possible, daring her to walk out while he's as vulnerable as it gets—flabby, pasty, and stark effin' nude.
Segel's still getting his freak on—and his geek, too—playing this songwriter who's spent years working on a musical starring a Dracula puppet who just wants a little looooove . Even if his movie, produced by Apatow and directed by first-timer Nicholas Stoller , visits familiar territory—Hawaii , specifically, where he goes to forget his lady love, only to bump into her seconds after his arrival—Segel's willing to go to dark, weird places his contemporaries won't. Peter fits neatly into the Apatow catalog of screwed-up, stunted crybaby man-boys, but he's also Bruce Jay Friedman 's Lonely Guy—nothing more, or less, than a misfit and a mess.
Eventually, of course, he will meet the woman who puts him back together: Rachel Jansen  (Mila Kunis ), a receptionist at the Hawaii hotel to which Peter retreats once he discovers that screwing his way through El Lay ladies won't cure his heartbreak. The film ultimately adheres to the romantic-comedy formula, which demands we root for boy to get girl—any  girl, so long as he winds up happy by the end credits. Rachel's as good as any: She's a smart, tough stunner who initially takes pity on pathetic Peter, before realizing he's a good guy done wrong by Sarah. But their scenes together feel like cogs in the romantic-comedy machine that also finds Sarah hooked up with a loutish British pop star named Aldous Snow  (Russell Brand ), for whom leather pants are perfectly suitable beachwear. (Though, to be fair, Brand's a rather brilliant comedian and no small asset to the picture.)
Several members of Apatow's troupe of regular irregulars also show up: Paul Rudd  as a bottle-bleached surfer, spouting stoner aphorisms; Jonah Hill  as a waiter with a desperate man-crush on Aldous; Bill Hader  as the stepbrother cajoling Peter to get on with what little life he's got; Jack McBrayer  as the simpering newlywed finding Jesus between his wife's thighs. But without Segel bravely channeling "his own anxieties and obsessions into his clowning," as Pauline Kael  wrote about Woody Allen  24 years ago, Forgetting Sarah Marshall  would have been easily forgettable and, one might even say, limp.
