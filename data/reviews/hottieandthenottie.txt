The problem with "The Hottie and the Nottie" is - wait, let me start again. The most crippling of the many problems afflicting "The Hottie and the Nottie" is the radical disconnect between the title and our perception of the movie's star. I'm not sure on what planet Paris Hilton is considered "hot" - one that involves hazmat suits and tongs, possibly - but it hasn't been Earth for some time.
This may not be fair. For all I know, Hilton is in reality a demure young thing who spends her spare time contemplating String Theory while knitting fingerwarmers for the lepers of Molokai. Her indelible public persona, however, is that of a - what's the word? Oh, yes: skank. A rich, brainless, clueless skank.
Well, we need our entitled fools. Always have. From Marie Antoinette to the brats on MTV's "My Super Sweet 16," they serve a social function by reassuring the plebes that money can't buy intelligence or class. Or, in this case, acting ability. "The Hottie and the Nottie" - the title makes it sound like a picture book for remedial readers - is a limp low-budget romantic comedy that more or less remakes "There's Something About Mary" with Hilton in the Cameron Diaz role. Suddenly Diaz is looking like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.
Joel David Moore, a likable beanpole usually relegated to nerd character parts, plays the hero, Nate Cooper, who has never gotten over his grade-school crush on little Cristabel Abbott and decides on a whim to drive cross-country and woo her full-time. Cristabel is grown up now and played by Hilton (who also executive produced), and the nonsensical gag is that she's so beauteous men line up on her Santa Monica jogging route with "Marry Me" signs.
Cristabel is still best friends with June Phigg (Christine Lakin), a.k.a. "the Nottie." Hairy, clumsy, plagued with sores and green teeth, June's the first line of defense against anyone hoping to score with Cristabel. Nate plots to clean her up and set her up, only to wonder if he's falling for the newly refurbished June himself.
As written by TV scribe Heidi Ferrer and directed by Tom Putnam on a budget lower than Hilton's per diem, "The Hottie and the Nottie" is more harmless than hateful. You've seen dozens of movies like this on cable in the wee hours, and most of them were made during the Reagan administration. The tone wobbles between gross-out comedy (June's diseased toenail flies off into someone's mouth) and overwritten rom-com earnestness. The lighting is dimmer than the characters.
Since Moore and Lakin are professionals, they're able to give Nate and June's sub-screwball dialogue a bit of snap even when the momentum slows to a crawl. As Nate's fat-slob best friend, The Greg Wilson (that's how he's billed) is supposed to be crassly charming and manages the first half of the equation.
Then there's Hilton. She delivers her lines in an unmodulated near-whisper and keeps her head lowered, gazing up at Nate as if she'd learned Acting Position #1 and then dropped the class. The film poses her in a succession of bikinis, mini-tops, and short shorts, none of which give her the presence necessary to actually hold the screen. Her head seems too small for her body and stuck on at an odd angle. She resembles nothing so much as a tiny blond velociraptor.
That's cruel, I know, but one's mind wanders when a movie's evaporating up there on the screen. More crucially, there's not a whit of mystery to Hilton, as there must be for any proper movie star. How can there be mystery when she's everywhere in our culture, from reality shows to Internet sex videos to tabloid websites to perfumes and other personal brand extensions? With all her wealth and meaningless celebritude, Hilton is incapable of doing the one thing most of us desperately wish she would do: Go away.

It's a law of nature that Paris Hilton is more beautiful when she keeps her mouth shut. Her voice betrays her by making her sound much worse than bitchy; it makes her sound common . In The Hottie & the Nottie , Hilton is the babe whom Joel David Moore  a tart young clown who's like Tom Green crossed with Paul Giamatti  has lusted after since the first grade. But to get to her, he's got to find a beau for her best pal (Christine Lakin), a walking one-joke troll (rotten teeth, monobrow, toenail from hell). The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie & the Nottie , a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep.

 One would think that after increasingly embarrassing forays into reality television, the Internet and the penitentiary, Paris Hilton might have taken a moment to reflect on her choices. Or perhaps not: with “The Hottie & the Nottie” Ms. Hilton proves yet again that introspection — not to mention shame — is as alien to her as a life without paparazzi.  Custom designed for its smirking star (who is also an executive producer), this tasteless train wreck asks only that she preen and prance on cue. As Cristabel Abbott, half of the film’s title and the entirety of its purpose, Ms. Hilton plays a Los Angeles magnet to a variety of drooling stalkers. Chief among these is Nate (Joel David Moore), a needy nerd whose adoration flowered in first grade and stubbornly resists the evidence of his bathroom mirror.  Before Nate can claim his prize, however, he must find someone willing to deflower Cristabel’s best friend, June (Christine Lakin), a sweetheart buried beneath a crusty coating of plaque, eczema and toenail fungus. But while Heidi Ferrer’s script feigns interest in June’s inner beauty, the camera creeps beneath Cristabel’s swimsuit and hangs on her every word. “A life without orgasms is like a world without flowers,” she pants.  Hallmark, eat your heart out.  “The Hottie & the Nottie” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Characters pass gas, denigrate little people and perform the most revealing downward dog in yoga history.

Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's "Bottom 100." "The Hottie and the Nottie" will make it an even four, being so unfunny that the previously unthinkable sentiment "She deserves better" comes to mind. A certain disappointment sets in when the consummate awfulness subsides after an hour, becoming slightly less painful. But then, dropping a hammer on your foot improves that way, too. Biz will be hot ... not.
Why this low-budgeter (on which Hilton is credited as an exec producer) dared bypass the direct-to-DVD fate of star's priors is a mystery. Even "The Hillz," "Bottoms Up" and "National Lampoon's Pledge This!" were more bigscreen-scaled than "Hottie," which seems to have been shot with home viewing in mind. In any case, the moviegoing public seldom lays down hard cash to see a pop-culture celebrity it's already been overexposed to for free: Ask Liberace ("Sincerely Yours"), Luciano Pavarotti ("Yes, Giorgio!"), Vanilla Ice ("Cool as Ice"), Evel Knievel ("Viva Knievel!") and Madonna (everything).
Yet Paris is far from the wrongest thing about a movie offensively crude in concept and doubly so in execution. Nate (Joel David Moore) has been in love with princessy-perfect Cristabel (Hilton) since first grade. Twenty years later, having just been dumped by a very angry girlfriend (Kathryn Fiore), he realizes he's never gotten over that first crush.
Nate tracks down Cristabel in Santa Monica with the help of fellow childhood pal Arno (played by comedian Greg Wilson, reviving that unlamented '80s comedy tradition of imitation Belushis as sidekick). The good news: She is still hot, sweet and single.
The bad: Then, as now, her best friend is June (Christine Lakin). Balding yet hairy in the wrong places, with feral teeth, warts, sores and actual horse whinnies greeting each appearance, June is destined for old-maidhood. Unfortunately for Nate, loyal Cristabel has vowed chastity until her roommate has a fella of her own.
Eyes on the prize, Nate sets to fixing June up, even if he has to pay someone (Adam Kulbersh). But then Johann (model-turned-thesp Johann Urb) turns up, seemingly earnest in his desire to improve June's lot via dental surgery and such.
Once it stops being incessantly crass and obnoxious, "Hottie" isn't so bad -- not world-class bad, anyway. Lakin (who tries to give a real performance in a degrading role) and Moore actually have a couple charming scenes together. But such praise should be heard very faintly indeed.
But where Hilton is concerned, sheer desire to be photographed doesn't equal the actual presence and training needed to hold the camera. She's laughable preening in frequent slow-mo "Look, I'm sexy!" sequences, ghastly when tiny thespian effort is asked of her in a drunk scene. Elsewhere, when allowed to behave naturally, she doesn't embarrass herself, unlike the real actors expected to be funny with tragic material. (Confident Urb also escapes humiliation.)
It would be easy to blame Heidi Ferrer's script. But since thesps sometimes appear to be floundering improvisationally, it's not always clear there is
 a script.
It should be noted director Tom Putnam's last project was PBS' acclaimed WWII documentary "Red White Black & Blue." Perhaps, like an insurance claim, "Hottie" should simply be labeled no-fault for the future benefit of all involved.
Tech and design aspects are mostly subpar.

Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny, The Hottie and the Nottie  stars Paris Hilton  as . . . But really, need I go on? [Ed.: A little, yes. ] OK, fine: Hilton stars as monosyllabic event-planner Cristabelle Abbott, "the hottest woman in Los Angeles" and absurd object of desire for Nate Cooper  (Joel David Moore ), an unemployed, unsympathetic asshole. Scripted by Heidi Ferrer  and shat onscreen by director Tom Putnam , this strong contender for The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen follows Nate's attempt to woo the "hottie" while suffering the rancid foot fungus, oozing facial blisters, and hideous tooth decay of her best friend, June Phigg (Christine Lakin ). Which leads to such hilarious antics as the yoga-class mishap in which Nate, inching his nose into Cristabel's downward- dogging, spandex-clad ass, gets a whiff of Phiggian foot funk instead. Guffaw! Bonus point for Hilton's straight-faced delivery of the sentence: "Do you think I'm  a pod person?" Unfortunately, I'll have to take it right back for the inclusion of Randy, a retarded albino stalker.
