Saving Grace, Nearing Grace, Grace Under Fire, Will & Grace : It's the thank-less literary fate of any fictional character given a name so rife with catchphrase possibilities to stand for far more than whoever she really is  and whoever she could believably be. True, an actual Grace is actually gone in Grace Is Gone . A wife, mother, and military woman serving in Iraq, Grace Phillips has been killed in action as this anesthetizing indie-made tragedy begins, and it's left to her freshly widowed husband, Stanley (John Cusack), to break the news to their two young daughters. Stanley himself was once a military man until poor eyesight ended his career. Now, although he has joined the civilian army of employees at a heartland big-box home-supply store, he remains a supporter of the U.S. war effort, proud of his wife's choice to serve.
But with her death, the kind of grace that's a blessing to those with faith goes too  or so writer-director James C. Strouse posits in his heartstring-twanging dirge on a theme of quagmire. (Strouse's screenplay for 2006's Lonesome Jim , directed by Steve Buscemi, demonstrated his early interest in the narrative possibilities of self-pity.) A fattened-up Cusack gives his character the trudging gait of a longtime resentful sad sack, suggesting the guy was no lighthearted spirit even in the best of times; maybe he drove his wife a little nuts with his dour act. Now, undone by grief and loss, Stanley can't find the words to break the news to his serious, hypervigilant 12-year-old daughter, Heidi (Shélan O'Keefe), or her more bubbly 8-year-old sister, Dawn (Gracie Bednarczyk). So he doesn't. He stalls by plopping them in the car and whisking them off on a road trip to a theme park in a manic search for the balm of manufactured fun. Who is this uncommunicative stickler for rules who suddenly yanks his girls out of school? Who is this father who thinks he's shielding his kids from pain but is actually prolonging their agony? He's an actor's dream, that's who, an amalgam of arbitrary actions. (Cusack even gets to wear unattractive eyeglasses.) In the background, the Mystic River -y piano tinkles of a score by Clint Eastwood attempt to put music to the plaintive questions of exhausted Americans losing loved ones in distant battle somewhere in the Valley of Elah.
The this-is-America road footage is broken up with a series of studiously calibrated father-daughter scenes signifying alienation (bland chain hotels off the highway, where the family checks in each night, are easily recognizable metaphors for malaise). But although we're told that grace died along with Grace, it's Stanley who's been missing in action all along. Grace Is Gone  grabs on to a name, a war, and the metaphor-come-to-life of a theme park with rides going nowhere. And we, the people, are spun around and shaken for tears.

 For most of its 85 minutes “Grace Is Gone,” a small, tender film about contemporary parenthood in wartime, carries off a delicate balancing act. How do you portray the tragic effects of the Iraq war on the home front without sounding shrilly partisan or evasively neutral? How do you avoid jingoism, cynicism or mawkishness?  The film, written and directed by James C. Strouse,  evokes the daily lives of a father and his two children in perfect, unassuming performances and with a close attention to detail that makes you feel like a fifth member of the family.  The household consists of Stanley Phillips (John Cusack),  the blocky, good-hearted manager of a home-supply store, and his daughters, the 12-year-old Heidi (Shelan O’Keefe) and  the 8-year-old Dawn (Gracie Bednarczyk).  Their mother, Grace (Dana Lynne Gilhooley),  whose presence haunts the movie, is a soldier in Iraq. Except for snapshots and a brief flashback, she is only a chipper voice heard on a telephone answering machine. Early in the movie we learn that Stanley had joined the Army. He was so gung-ho to fight in Iraq that he cheated on his eye exam by having a friend memorize the letters, but was quickly found out and discharged. A scene in which he gathers his store’s clerks in a huddle that ends in a motivational group cheer suggests that he might have made an excellent officer.  While Grace is overseas, the other Phillipses studiously pretend that she is not in harm’s way. Watching television coverage of the war is forbidden in their home, although Heidi sneaks occasional looks. Before Grace left,  she and Dawn synchronized the alarms on their watches so they would beep simultaneously;  when the signal comes, the little girl closes her eyes in prayerful communion.  Stanley’s own state of willful denial ends with a knock on the door. An Army captain and a chaplain stiffly deliver the dreaded “regret to inform” news that Grace died bravely in combat. Stanley reacts with numbed shock. Because the girls are in school, he has several hours to decide how to tell to them.  But when they return, he is at a loss for words. He impulsively decides to prolong their innocence and announces that the three of them are going on a trip to wherever the girls desire. Dawn pipes up that she wants to visit Enchanted Gardens, a theme park in Florida.  Much of the movie follows  the three on their journey from Minnesota to Florida, during which we are shown a revealing picture of highways crowded with chain stores and shopping malls. As Stanley improvises their erratic route, Heidi begins to sense that something is terribly amiss.  Ms. O’Keefe’s portrayal of a serious girl on the verge of adolescence captures the smallest nuances of Heidi’s doubt and confusion. As she catches her father in inconsistencies and white lies, her poker face becomes graver, and her attitude more remote; outside the motels they visit, she spends hours sitting curbside and brooding.  Without overly dramatizing the emotional distance between Stanley and his daughters, the screenplay signals that until now the girls have been much closer to their mother. Stanley buys them pretty dresses and allows them to have their ears pierced.  In the film’s most treacherous scene, Stanley and the girls try to visit his mother (who is away) and find his scruffy younger brother, John (Alessandro Nivola), a floundering student and bitter opponent of the war, sprawled on the couch. The movie allows John’s sarcastic criticisms to stand without serious counter-argument beyond Stanley’s professing his loyalty and trust in the powers that be. One of Donald H. Rumsfeld’s more stirring speeches is later seen on a hotel television.  Mr. Cusack demonstrates once again that he is Hollywood’s second-most-reliable nice guy, after Tom Hanks. Devoid of vanity, with no hidden agendas, he never strains to be likable. Good will, integrity and a native common sense ooze out of him.  The accumulation of detail in “Grace Is Gone,” which is Mr. Strouse’s directing debut (he wrote the screenplay for Steve Buscemi’s “Lonesome Jim”), is so seamless that any prodding of the story calls attention to itself. The most glaring moments of manipulation are Stanley’s phone calls home to hear Grace on the answering machine and to leave a personal message.  It is perfectly plausible that Stanley  would want to hear her voice now and again, but those heartfelt messages in which he vents his grief and sorrow are another matter.  “Grace Is Gone” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The theme of a parent’s death in battle could upset young children, and there is some strong language.

The homefront impact of the Iraq War is dealt with in the most personal terms in "Grace Is Gone." Unremarkable from a filmmaking point of view, screenwriter James C. Strouse's first directorial effort functions best as an eloquent metaphor for an American public unwilling or unable, at least perhaps until recently, to come to terms with the wages of the war. Although clearly coming from an antiwar perspective, the story's emotional effectiveness and family grounding give the film a real shot at connecting with general audiences across the political spectrum, especially if Weinstein Films, which picked it up for $4 million at Sundance, pitches it straight at the heartland and not as a specialized item. 
The setup is simple: An ordinary Middle American man gets word his career soldier wife, Grace, has been killed in Iraq, and must break the news to their two daughters. Finding he can't do it straight out, he takes the girls on an extended road trip during which their suspicions mount as to what's going on, until he finds the right time, place and manner in which to tell them.
The man, Stanley Phillips (John Cusack), is not a prepossessing fellow. A manager at a big box store, he's bespectacled, drably dressed and overall a soft character, hardly one to take on anything challenging. His 12-year-old daughter Heidi (Shelan O'Keefe) seems bright and observant, while 8-year-old Dawn (Grace Bednarczyk) is more interested in just having fun.
With little ado other than a curious opening scene in which Stanley is the only man at a soldiers' wives gathering at which the women gossip about how hot the sex was the night before their husbands shipped out, Stanley receives a "we regret to inform you" visit from two Army reps.
Numb, he sits his girls down to talk, then abruptly pulls back from the task at hand, announcing instead that they can skip school for a few days while they all drive down to a favorite destination, Enchanted Gardens. In addition to lacking courage, Stanley is in denial.
A brief visit with Stanley's layabout brother John (an amusing Alessandro Nivola) provides the opportunity for an airing of political positions. John rants on about the war and a lying government, trying to goad the girls not to blindly accept their father's dutiful, unquestioning patriotism. Much as John may rep the filmmakers' p.o.v., he's scarcely let off the hook, being portrayed as a freeloader who, at 32, is still trying to decide about grad school.
John learns the truth about Grace but reluctantly obeys Stanley's request not to tell the girls. Heidi almost finds out on her own, however, when she phones a school official who speaks to her in exaggeratedly sympathetic tones. As the journey progresses, Heidi seems to mature and deepen, to move from child to young adult before one's eyes, a real tribute to O'Keefe's wonderful performance.
After passing through a procession of junk food/conglom retail landscapes clearly designed to stress the dreary sameness of much of contempo America, the family arrives at the Florida amusement park destination, after which Stanley must finally do the inevitable deed. Even though the climactic scene, set on a beach, is not well-framed, shot or cut, it still carries a mighty emotional charge.
As Hollywood films have generally done when treating social issues, "Grace Is Gone" appeals much more effectively to the heart than to the head. Philosophically, it steers clear of issues relating to the war, assiduously avoiding ideology and complexity. In doing so, it succeeds on its own simple terms and looks to be acceptable both to liberal and conservative viewers as it critiques the war while honoring the troops.
Cusack, who doubles as a producer, jettisons his usual smart-guy persona to effectively enter the skin of an essentially weak man who has never analyzed himself or reassessed his beliefs, and, when the crunch comes, admits to himself that he's always relied upon his wife to know what to do. Performance may be praised as a major change of pace, but it seems a limited one in a small range.
Pic's production values are just passable, its look mundane. At the projection caught, some of the colors, notably the greens and reds, were unrealistically intense, while quality of the images was thin.

Eleven months after winning the screenplay and audience awards at this year's Sundance Film Festival , writer-director James C. Strouse 's Grace Is Gone has received a musical makeover care of Clint Eastwood , who reportedly screened the film and thought that it could do with a new original score, which he offered to compose himself. The musica gently jazzy piano-and-strings themeis just fine, and a good deal less cloying than what was there before. One can only regret that Eastwood didn't offer to reshoot the whole movie while he was at it.
The "Grace" of Strouse's title is a career Marine who's gone off to fight the evildoers in Iraq , leaving her husband Stanley (John Cusack ) behind to care for their two young daughters, 12-year-old Heidi (Shélan O'Keefe ) and eight-year-old Dawn (Gracie Bednarczyk ). The film's early moments show us life as it continues on the home front, somewhere in the suburban flatlands of Minnesota. Stanley tests the waters of a support group for soldiers' spouses (he's the only man in the room); Heidithe quiet, soul-searching kidsteals forbidden peeks at the latest images from Baghdad  on the evening news; and Dawnthe boisterous, doll-faced kidpauses for nightly moments of silence at the chime of her synchronized watch. Then two men in uniform show up at the door, regretting to inform Stanley that Grace is now gone for good. At which point, Stanley does what I suppose Strouse thinks any like-minded parent would do: Instead of sitting his girls down for a sober heart-to-heart, he piles everyone into the car and sets off on an impromptu trip to Disney World . Well, not Disney  exactly, but a fictional Central Florida happy place called Enchanted Gardens, which, when they finally get there, looks neither particularly enchanting nor lush.
First, though, there's a pit stop to visit Stanley's parents, whereupon we also find Stanley's layabout kid brother, John (Alessandro Nivola ), who functions as the movie's voice of blue-state Americaso indicated by his scruffy beard, lack of gainful employment at age 32, and habit of referring to President Bush  as "monkey boy." "How do these girls feel about the fact that their mother is halfway across the world fighting in an unjust oil war?" he asks Stanley. "They think their mother is a hero who's helping to uphold the precious freedoms that allow you to have your traitorous, pinko opinions," Stanley replies. I'm paraphrasing there, but you get the idea. The level of dialectical discourse rarely rises above that, but discourse isn't really part of Strouse's game plan. Like this season's other drama about a family coping with the death of an Iraq enlistee, Paul Haggis 's In the Valley of Elah , Grace Is Gone wants to massage liberal sensibilities about the war without alienating the church-going, Wal-Mart -shopping Middle Americans who might see, in Stanley Phillips , a reflection of themselves.
All the while, Stanley keeps up his morbid shell game in the least convincing of ways, leaving voicemails for Grace on the home answering machine and abruptly changing the subject whenever Heidi asks something to the effect of, "Dad, how come we're playing hooky from school in the middle of the year just so we can go to some dumb theme park?" Some champions of Grace Is Gone  have suggested that none of this is meant to be taken literally and is instead Strouse's canny metaphor for Americans' unwillingness to acknowledge the full toll of the second Gulf War. But rather than challenging our national aversion to unhappy endings, both in life and in cinema, Strouse plays right into it: He's devised Grace Is Gone  to work on our sentiments the way a porn movie works on our libidos, only he delays the money shot with 80-odd minutes of emotional foreplay en route to the inevitable, orgiastic climax where Stanley finally spills the beans and the girls spill forth the entire contents of their tear ducts. If not a happy ending per se, it's a horribly contrived bit of catharsis, and as if to underline the crassness of his instincts, Strouse drowns out the dialogue of that crucial scene with musica reminder that, as in all pornography, talk is expendable.
