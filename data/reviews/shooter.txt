To an extent I�m willing to indulge a dunderheaded commando actioner such as Shooter
 if one of its villains is an omnipotent Cheney-esque senator; in these times we all need catharsis. Less subversive and infinitely less intelligent than 1999�s Wahlberg-starrer Three Kings
, this movie does blow lots of shit up real good
 and punishes contemptible public figures otherwise left unaccountable for massacring African villagers. And would you believe they�re in it � for the oil? So the movie has that going for it. Otherwise? Retired and improbably named ex-Marine Corps sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) falls for the oldest trick in the book � the book being Stephen Hunter�s Point of Impact
, here adapted leadenly to the screen by Red Planet
�s Jonathan Lemkin � and helps a shady G-man (Glover, who�s been instructed to speak as if he�s got strep) �prevent� the assassination of the president. But before you can say �fall guy,� Swagger is wanted for murder and on the run, and though they may have trained him to kill, they want him dead, and all that. There�s a junior agent (Pe�a) who believes Swagger has been framed and Barbie-doll co-stars (Mara and Mitra) who change clothes often and discharge weapons while wearing lots of eyeliner. It�s nice to see Serbedzija rolling around in a Strangelove
 wheelchair, snarling, �Nothing, no matter how horrible, happens without the permission of the government.� But if that�s true, Shooter
 is one more reason to impeach.


How to describe "Shooter"? Mark Wahlberg's bid to become the next Clint Eastwood ? An action-film Humvee with a "support our troops" ribbon magnet slapped on the back?
How about "Rambo" as Al Franken might have imagined it?
That's about right: The new film from "Training Day" director Antoine Fuqua -- he's what you'd get if you put an auteurist on steroids -- is a stylish but essentially businesslike smash-and-crasher about a special forces sniper who gets used by a shadow arm of the US government, only to come back for bloody revenge.
The movie stops short of accusing the villains of masterminding 9/11, but maybe just because they lacked the manpower. For assassinations, Third World genocide, oil-pipeline skullduggery, they're your go-to guys. And up against them is only Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg).
Did novelist Stephen Hunter come up with that name using some kind of NASCAR randomizing algorithm? The author (and Pulitzer-winning film critic for The Washington Post
) wrote "Point of Impact" back in 1993, when Bob Lee was an aging Vietnam vet; the novel's success led to two more books featuring the character and eventually this long-in-development film.
It's too late for Bob Lee to have served in 'Nam, of course, so the filmmakers elect to plop him in northeast Africa in the early part of the new millennium, where a mission protecting US troops goes awry. "Bob the Nailer" -- that's how he's referred to in hushed tones throughout the armed forces -- returns to the States, holes up in a back country shack with his hound dog, grows a mullet, and broods. The movie calls the country he served in Ethiopia, but emotionally it's Iraq and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
A government suit named Johnson (Danny Glover ) arrives three years later and plays on Bob Lee's dormant patriotism: The president of the United States has been threatened with assassination, and they need a shooter to catch a shooter. Or so they say. What the movie needs, actually, is a fugitive with jungle-hillbilly survival skills: Harrison Ford crossbred with Li'l Abner.
Wahlberg brings a grim purposefulness to his role, and he doesn't grandstand or preen. Personally, I prefer the actor when he has his thinking cap on, as in "The Departed ," or when he's at a dimbulb loss ("I Heart Huckabees, " "Boogie Nights "), but he's eminently watchable here. Bob Lee's a man with a serious talent, and while the movie fetishizes the hardware and the long-distance exploding-head shots, the character doesn't have the time to do likewise. There's a lot of pink mist in "Shooter," though, which will excite certain boys of many ages. All I can say is better here than in the Zapruder film.
Bob Lee's an awfully glum fellow to hang a movie on, so "Shooter" gives him Nick Memphis (Michael Peña , the locksmith in "Crash"), an FBI newbie who figures out all is not what it seems. There needs to be a girl, too, so the hero briefly takes refuge with a late colleague's fiancée (Kate Mara , red-haired, wide-eyed, handy with a shotgun). For sadistic villains, we get character actors Elias Koteas and Rade Serbedzija , respectively drooling and sighing fatalistically.
Look fast and you'll even spot dear old Ned Beatty as a porcine senator. Wahlberg's Bob Lee seems he knows how to handle all these folks except the girl.
The film moves at a clip and smartly alternates mayhem and drama. It's as professional as Bob Lee himself and I was never bored, even watching a storyline I've seen in countless variations. All that's new, or new for the first time in a few decades, is that unfocused anger against the people in charge. "Shooter" carries a heady whiff of post-Iraq populist brimstone -- a resentment over the fact that, no matter what the government says, they're not acting in the interests of you, me, America, or the world.
Bob Lee, in other words, is Billy Jack. And he's headed for Washington.



         It's a sentiment not found on the poster, but if you had to sum up Hollywood's latest action thriller in one sentence, you'd select the traditional "Mark Wahlberg is
 'Shooter.' " He really is, and that is a good thing.
 
 One of those elevated B-pictures that runs type across the bottom of the screen to identify cities, "Shooter" has its pro forma, paint-by-numbers elements, but it is executed with such efficiency and energy by action maestro Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day") that ignoring flaws and becoming involved in the proceedings isn't a matter of choice.
 


         






   Starting from a script by Jonathan Lemkin loosely adapted from Stephen Hunter's bestselling "Point of Impact," "Shooter" presents us with the kind of character the movies love: the heroic loner forced to do unequal battle for justice against phenomenal odds.
 
 Bob Lee Swagger (yes, that is his name) is just such an individual. A former Marine scout sniper, he is a shooter so good he can take the rotation of the Earth into consideration and hit a target a mile away. The idea of missing, needless to say, never even crosses his mind, and playing him may do for Wahlberg what playing Jason Bourne did for Matt Damon.
 
 Oscar-nominated for "The Departed," Walhberg is a brooding, convincing actor who seems to gain confidence and improve with every role. With "Shooter," he is called on to carry the picture while adding enough conviction to make its numerous "Mission: Impossible" implausibilities seem reasonable.
 
 He does it and makes it look easy.
 
 That character name notwithstanding, the key to Wahlberg's performance is that he never swaggers. Instead he projects a classic, wary stoicism as the retired marksman turned Wyoming recluse. Like few other actors — Steve McQueen is the classic example — Wahlberg radiates a casual sense of danger. He doesn't come off as an actor playing someone outside the law but the real thing somehow transferred to the screen.
 
  After a prologue showing the events leading to his retirement, Swagger is traced to his mountain lair by shadowy retired Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), who works for one of those nameless, supersecret, quasi-governmental entities thrillers are so fond of. Calling on Swagger's unquenchable patriotism, Johnson asks for help.
 
  The notion is that the government has heard that an ace sniper is planning to kill the president and Johnson claims he wants Swagger to figure out how such a man would do the job so that the plot can be stopped. What Johnson really wants, it soon turns out, is to use Swagger as the convenient fall guy an assassination can classically be pinned on.
 
 Convenient, my foot. Swagger, not surprisingly, turns out to be not exactly patsy material. With his bottomless skill set, he knows how to keep himself alive and escape from any and all traps. Plus, like those old Timex watches, he can take a licking and keep on ticking. When he vows, "I'll burn their playhouse down," no one asks if he's just being metaphorical.
 
  Resourceful as he is, even Swagger occasionally needs the help of fellow humans. Eventually coming to his aid are newly minted FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pea) and Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara), the unavoidable attractive woman who, just as inevitably, ends up being menaced and tortured in her underwear. Surely there is a better way to hold our attention.
 
 Expertly cast by veteran Mali Finn, "Shooter" finds room for the supremely evil Elias Koteas as the baddest of bad guys and a memorable cameo by the Band veteran Levon Helm as a ballistics wizard. Technical credits are all excellent as well, but the script goes in and out of effectiveness and has trouble deciding on a suitable ending: There are no fewer than three climaxes, which is one and likely two too many.
 
  Carrying "Shooter" through its difficulties is, finally, not its crisp action sequences and definitely not the torture. It's Wahlberg's performance, which is the film's most old-fashioned element, and its best.
 
 
 "The Shooter." MPAA rating: R for strong graphic violence and some language. Running time: 2 hours, 2 minutes. In general release.   

In Shooter , Mark Wahlberg, as a former Marine sniper, is brought out of retirement to take out a would-be presidential assassin. It is, however, all a big setup, in a plot that recycles the murder of JFK and the sins of Dick Cheney without becoming remotely plausible  or unpredictable. The ultimate crime of this paranoid enemy-of-the-state pulp, directed with more style than brains by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day ), is how dull it is. Once the conspiracy is revealed, there's still 90 minutes of manhunt to go, with Wahlberg, in blank-slate mode, reduced to Rambo in the concrete jungle.

 Muscles bulge and heads explode in “Shooter,” a thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom (heads, mostly). Did I mention the exploding heads? It is an admittedly primitive pleasure, but I do love watching stuff blow up in movies (heads, not so much). There is something unaccountably gratifying, at times reassuring about watching the screen — the bigger the better —  become engulfed by surging waves of liquid orange, in the image of a car exploding into the air like a rocket, in a room, a building, a boat, a truck, you name it, shattering into confetti.  The late 1980s and 1990s were good times for big movie bangs and bulging movie muscle. It was the golden age of bad boys and Boy Scouts, wisecracks and careless, loving, hardcore American violence. Sept. 11 may have dampened our appetite for destruction, and I know that I squirmed uncomfortably while watching “Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,” a cheap 2002 action film with too many falling bodies. But the violence returned with a vengeance soon after the attack and now signs of war are everywhere on the big screen, in the torture scenes that seem increasingly de rigueur whether it’s James Bond or a tourist strapped to a chair, in foreign affairs and exotic adventures and, yes, even inside the sightlines of “Shooter.”  The story has the simplicity of a fairy tale: A former military sniper, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), having opted out of the Marines after an unfortunate escapade abroad, has retreated into the deep woods with his dog and his guns. An updated, upgraded Jeremiah Johnson, with a garden full of vegetables and a fridge stocked with beer, Swagger comes across as something of a Zen mountain man. He lives simply (but has a computer) and dresses plainly (but wears a trendsetter’s beard). He seems at peace in this world as he sits on a crest overlooking the forest. Yet the world is not at peace, as we know from the first few minutes of the film set someplace dusty and scary and far, far away.  Guns must be raised, and that beard really has to come off. And so they do and so it does, as Swagger comes down off his mountain and drops into an assassination intrigue stocked with villainy and weapons. There are black helicopters, a spunky redhead (Kate Mara) and a shootout boldly painted in red, white and blue. The redhead looks good in a miniskirt and twirls a rifle as lightly as a baton; mostly she ogles Mr. Wahlberg, who, once he shaves his beard, provides ample opportunity for eyeball strain. A natural screen presence, Mr. Wahlberg is charmingly sincere (he’s like a cruder, more street Matt Damon), though when he sheds his clothes the glint in his eyes is as knowing as that of an old Vegas stripper.  Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Jonathan Lemkin, “Shooter” is based on the novel “Point of Impact” by Stephen Hunter, who, when not turning out pulp fictions, works as a film critic for The Washington Post. Mr. Fuqua, the auteur of such rococo diversions as “Training Day” and “Tears of the Sun,” likes to keep the volume cranked and the action relentless. Like many contemporary action directors, he overshoots and overedits, cramming his films with inexplicable, unnecessary visual and aural noise. This maximalist approach can tax the nerves, though it has the benefit of keeping you on alert. It’s also pretty enjoyable. Mr. Fuqua, who happens to be surprisingly good with actors, does have a knack for chaos.  Here that disorder extends to the story, which combines a live-free-or-die vibe with some deep-fried gun-and-flag fetishism for the usual love-it-or-leave-it, lock-and-load, make-my-day Hollywood jumble. Bob Lee Swagger’s name is obviously meant to evoke Lee Harvey Oswald, much like the image of a rifle pointed in the direction of an American president. But it’s tough to figure out how these historically saturated allusions to the Kennedy assassination fit with the angry talk about Congress. In the end all we know about Bob Lee Swagger is that, like the adorable F.B.I. agent (Michael Peña) hot and cold on his trail, he is a good man. Which is perhaps all that we are ever meant to know when an American holds a gun.  “Shooter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

A '70s-style political conspiracy thriller outfitted with contempo action techno gear, "Shooter" is a brawny loner-against-a-duplicitous-government suspenser that asserts its own personality despite adherence to genre specifications. An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination, pic saddles itself with stereotypical villains, hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions. But its skeptical, disillusioned take on big government and official deceptions should strike a vibrant chord with a wide range of audiences, as will the ample serving of dramatic just desserts, resulting in potent B.O. in all markets.
Among other things, "Shooter" provides one answer to the oft-asked question of who can replace the aging action stars of the '80s and '90s. Following up his tangy turn in "The Departed," Mark Wahlberg easily fills shoes that once would have been worn by Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis. He's got the focused determination, the street smarts and the bod; he's aged enough now to have cast off the juvenile callowness, and as an actor he clearly understands the Gary Cooper principle that less is usually more for a stoical hero in such fare.
Adapting Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter's novel "Point of Impact," the first entry in a trilogy featuring military sniper Bob Lee Swagger, scenarist Jonathan Lemkin stirs in recognizable ingredients from "The Parallax View," "The Day of the Jackal," "Seven Days in May" and "Three Days of the Condor," feeding on and encouraging suspicion of nefarious deeds and dastardly motives among men in high places.
In a nine-minute Horn of Africa prologue, Swagger (Wahlberg) is seen doing what he does best, picking off enemies from a great distance in a clandestine operation. When his partner is killed and opposition forces gather, however, the Marines clear out and abandon the marksman to fend for himself. It's just the first of many occasions when he'll be asked to do so, and never does the slightest doubt arise that he'll be up to the task.
Three years later, Swagger is ensconced in a Wyoming mountain cabin with his dog and firearms; when he goes online to survey the day's news and mutters, "Let's see what lies they're trying to sell us today," it's unclear whether he's turned into Jeremiah Johnson or the Unabomber. But when a vaguely defined Washington insider, retired Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), comes to call, he soon finds Swagger's Achilles heel: patriotism. Intelligence suggests the president is about to be the target of a long-distance assassination attempt, and Johnson insists only Swagger can deduce the would-be killer's plans.
Cementing his appeal for audiences on the left and then the right, Swagger replies, "I don't like the president much. I didn't like the one before," then reluctantly agrees to help, reconnoitering public places in D.C., Baltimore and Philly before deducing Independence Hall will be the location for the attack.
When the shooting goes awry and another official is killed, all fingers have been prearranged to point at Swagger, who slips through one tight spot after another with every cop in the country on his tail. Instructing the audience in diverse injury survival skills along the way, he eventually finds sanctuary at the old Kentucky home of his late buddy's former g.f., Sarah (Kate Mara).
Sarah's a lonely hottie, and her rather too extreme allure suddenly yanks focus to other matters. It also reps just the first of numerous improbabilities, among them Swagger's ever-ready vigilance in the face of attack and the stock villainy of clandestine government nasties. Even after more than 40 years, a director should never put an evil, foreign-accented government schemer (played here by Rade Sherbedgia) into a wheelchair and expect not to summon unwanted comparisons to "Dr. Strangelove." Likewise, Elias Koteas' slimy goon all but drools when he gets his hands on Sarah, and Ned Beatty's right-wing senator has in every way been made to resemble a certain vice president with questionable riflery skills.
All the same, Lemkin and helmer Antoine Fuqua have constructed such a taut tale around a man so unfairly scorned by his superiors that one can scarcely help but develop a deep rooting interest. Most crucial factor in the film's success is the conception of the Swagger character; he represents the classic American individualist of the sort one sees less and less of both onscreen and in real life, a don't-tread-on-me patriot, a cowboy loner who's only dangerous when crossed. Anyone with a healthy libertarian streak will embrace the entirely non-partisan way Swagger takes on an overgrown political apparatus.
During a "One-Eyed Jacks"-like second act in which Swagger bides his time while recovering from injuries, centerstage is shared by young FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena). Memphis dares to question the party line on what went down in Independence Square, an attitude quietly encouraged by a sultry bureau cohort (Rhona Mitra).
Arriving in the middle of all this is a show-stopping one-scene cameo by Levon Helm as an aged Southern firearms expert who guides the hero through esoteric realms of ammunition history.
By the time it's over, Swagger has taken down countless well-armed men in Ramboesque one-man-army style on his way to dealing with the big shots they protect. In any future Swagger installments, though, the bad guys will know better than to mess with his dog.
Fuqua and his team serve the action straight up, with no frills and a potent punch. British Columbian locations, including spectacular mountaintops in the Whistler area, stand in for settings as diverse as Montana and East Africa, although actual Philly and D.C. locations are used where they count. All behind-the-scenes contributions are strong.


In the same week that sees Adam Sandler  playing a grieving 9/11 widower in Reign Over Me ,  another lone figure reeling from post-traumatic stress fills the central role in the new Antoine Fuqua directed thriller, Shooter. Named Bob Lee  Swagger and played with appropriately gruff machismo by Mark Wahlberg , he's a former Marine gunnery sergeant and scout sniper who's also lost someone specialnot his wife or girlfriend, but his spotter, Donnie (Lane Garrison ). (In military terms, the shooter-spotter relationship is about as close as two guys can get without asking or telling.) Three years ago in Ethiopia , both men were left for dead by their superiors when their "unofficial" mission got officially all fucked up. Only Swagger made it out alive.
Cut to the present and some shadowy ex-military types (led by Danny Glover ) who show up on Swagger's doorstep with a really big favor to ask: They want him to kill the president of the United Statesor rather, they want him to tell them, O.J. Simpson style, how he would kill the prez if he were to do it. Internal government intelligence, it seems, has uncovered an assassination plot timed to the president's upcoming public appearance in Philadelphia, during which the fatal shot will be fired by an expert marksman from a distance of more than a mile. Swagger's expertise is needed in order to flush the suspect out. The men in black speak of honor and duty and patriotism. "Do we let America be ruled by thugs?" they ask Swagger rhetorically. "Sure, some years we do," he replies. Still, he agrees to take the job, even if we rightly suspect that any deal made by Glover and his oily private contractors (Elias Koteas  and Rade Sherbedgia ) is certain to prove a devil's bargain.
Sure enough, Swagger soon finds himself once again trapped behind enemy lines and on the run from hostile pursuers, only this time he's not in Africa but the city of brotherly love, and everyone in America (save for one rookie FBI agent  and the widow of Swagger's former spotter) thinks he just tried to cap the leader of the free world. The feature-length cat-and-mouse game that follows is nimbly executed by Fuqua (Training Day , King Arthur ), who's grown immeasurably more confident as a director since making his debut with the slapdash Chow Yun-Fat  vehicle The Replacement Killers , which was like the movie equivalent of bad Chinese take-out. Fuqua isn't a virtuoso stylist, but he shoots the kind of lean, efficient action scenes that directors like Ted Kotcheff  and John Flynn  once specialized in, and the entire movie exudes a refreshingly low-tech vibe that's of a piece with the resourcefulness of its protagonist, who can fashion a makeshift IV out of grocery-store sundries and, in what may be the most squirm-inducing act of self-medication since Bruce Willis  pulled broken glass out of his bleeding bare feet in the original Die Hard , applies a granulated astringent called Quik Clot to his gaping gunshot wounds.
Wittily adapted by screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin  (The Devil's Advocate ) from the first in a trilogy of Swagger novels by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post  film critic Stephen Hunter , Shooter is a generically titled studio action picture that turns out to be a surprisingly deft satire about Americans' loss of faith in their government following the 2000 election, the 9/11 attacks, and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq . Betrayed by Uncle Sam both at home and abroad, Swagger starts to seem like the last honest exponent of old-fashioned American virtuea John Rambo  for the Bush II  generationand the more he learns about the conspiracy that has taken hold of his life, the further he sees that it reaches: that everything really is about oil money and that, in the words of the movie's fat-cat red-state senator (a wonderfully smarmy Ned Beatty ), there are no heroes and villains or Democrats and Republicansonly haves and have-nots. Cannily programmed at the start of the 2008 election season, this rampantly amoral and Darwinian film persuasively argues that, in today's America, it's every man for himself and commerce against all. Allow me to be the first to propose: Bob Lee Swagger for president.
