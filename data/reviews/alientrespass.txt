Â Taking its cues from several classic 1950s sci-fi films � the superlative, eerie It Came From Outer Space
 chief among them � Alien Trespass
 is a deeply affectionate homage to the halcyon Red Scare era, when every kid on the block knew what "Klaatu borada nikto" meant and Saturday afternoons were made for flying-saucer matinees and Ray Bradbury's red planet, Mars. Thematically similar to 2002's The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
 (but minus that film's obvious tongue-in-cheek and intentionally cheap-looking style), Alien Trespass
 nicely conjures a near-perfect re-creation of Fifties sci-filmmaking tropes, from its Bronson Canyon locations to the crisp cinematography (in color, it should be noted) of David Moxness, who visually replicates the style of longtime genre cameraman Clifford Stine (The Incredible Shrinking Man
, This Island Earth
). Director Goodwin executive-produced several seasons of The X-Files
 and clearly knows his xenomorphs from his BEMs (that would be bug-eyed monsters for you nongenrephiles), and the film's period accuracy and fun retro tropes are winningly handled by a terrific cast that plays the whole thing as straight and true as Jack Arnold (Tarantula
, Creature From the Black Lagoon
) would have. Set on the outskirts of � where else? � California's Mojave Desert (where all the aliens not affiliated with Ray Harryhausen seemed to crash-land back in the day), Trespass
 finds starry-eyed astronomer and budding SETI fan Ted Lewis (McCormack) possessed by an alien intelligence and hunting down an escaped Ghota: a tentacular, cyclopean fiend that bears a striking (and intentional) resemblance to the titular creeper of It Came From Outer Space
. Ted's buxom, Good Housekeeping
-approved wife, Lana (Thompson), can't seem to figure out what's up with her beloved egghead, but a pair of teenagers (Dunbar and Smyth) who witnessed the alien craft's crash and savvy local waitress Tammy (Baird) quickly suss out the universal situation unfolding in their midst. Omnipresent character actor Lauria (The Wonder Years
) and former T-1000 Patrick play a pair of imagination-bereft lawmen who initially (and traditionally) blame the steady stream of monster sightings on mass hysteria (what, no swamp gas?), but still, they can't account for all the puddles of former human beings oozing around town. This is a genre-specifc film if ever there were one, so nonfans of Fifties alien melodramas likely won't find it all that impressive. But for those who still recall The Thing From Another World
's prescient admonition to "keep watching the skies!" or Kevin McCarthy's paranoid chant, "They're already here!" from that other Red Menace cautionary tale, Invasion of the Body Snatchers
, this is an impressively realized (and, yes, occasionally, unavoidably humorous) valentine to Hollywood's sci-fi glory days � all heart, no snark, and one big eye.

Does the world really need a fond, precise parody of 1950s alien-invasion movies right now? No, but we've got one with "Alien Trespass," and it's pretty endearing  - a low-budget labor of schlock.
The guiding hand appears to belong to director R.W. Goodwin, who produced an awful lot of "X-Files" episodes back in the day and who here bows low to the craptastic sci-fi B-movies of his youth: venerable swill like "It Conquered the World" (1956) and "Attack of the Crab Monsters" (1957). Because Goodwin is torn between his love of deep Eisenhower-era cheese and the need to tell a good story, "Alien Trespass" never breaks free into truly demented inspiration. It's a good cheap thrill, though, which may be all that was intended.
Slumming Hollywood star Eric McCormack ("Will and Grace") has a plum  dual role as Dr. Ted Lewis, a befuddled, pipe-smoking astrophysicist, and Urp, the robotic alien who temporarily inhabits Ted's body after his spaceship crash-lands in the desert near the tiny town of Mojave. Urp has lost an intergalactic prisoner called the Ghota, a 7-foot-tall purple phallic symbol with a giant red eyeball who can reduce humans to puddles of goo in seconds.
The good townspeople of Mojave are a gallery of B-movie types: the blowhard town cop (Robert Patrick), the sheriff three days from retirement (Dan Lauria), the perky, resourceful diner waitress (Jenni Baird, delightful) who gets an unholy romance going with Urp. Three teens cover the gamut from squeaky-clean types modeled on Troy Donahue (Andrew Dunbar) and Sandra Dee (Sarah Smyth) to a greasy Sal Mineo-alike (Aaron Brooks). Everyone plays it straight, which is fine; the theremin on the soundtrack does the overacting for them.
The script by James Swift and Steven P. Fisher plunders the trash-cinema past: The Ghota bears a distinct resemblance to the ice cream cone-shaped alien in "It Conquered the World," and McCormack's Urp is halfway between Michael Rennie's Klaatu and Keanu Reeves's. The movie's looking-glass high point comes when the Ghota invades a movie theater showing 1958's "The Blob" during the scene in that film where the Blob invades a movie theater. . . You can imagine this spiraling on forever at the M.C. Escher Drive-In.
I'm tempted to say that "Alien Trespass" is the real "Monsters vs. Aliens." Instead of state-of-the-art CGI, "Trespass" lovingly lays on the bad special effects: period-specific rear projection, rubber monster suits, UFOs that look like transmogrified hubcaps. There's more simple joy to be found here than in all of DreamWorks' 3-D extravaganza, though  - a pleasure that comes from laughing at the movie and with it at the same time. "Alien Trespass" could be the latest bulletin from "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" except that we're the silhouetted heads and the filmmakers are sitting right there next to us.

The perky little 1950s-style sci-fi drama Alien Trespass  follows soon after the galactic launch of Monsters vs. Aliens , so audiences now have a choice of movies about one-eyed slimy things. Ghota, the ravenous people-eating mutant from outer space who crash-lands in California's Mojave Desert one starry 1957 night in the live-action Trespass , has none of the verbal charms of Seth Rogen's blobulous B.O.B. in the animated Monsters . He doesn't speak, just ogles and gobbles, leaving behind a telltale puddle of ooze. But in this respectful homage to mid-20th-century B movies, the baffled locals who investigate the mysterious disappearance of fellow townsfolk talk out their hopes and hunches in the clean language of American pluck. And that warm tone, along with the picture's bright, saturated, anti-CGI look, is a welcome respite from jokes, irony, and the postmodern malaise of know-it-all-ness.
The characters in Alien Trespass  (directed by X-Files  producing alum R.W. Goodwin) are specimens of Sputnik-era determination, led by a gung-ho Eric McCormack. He plays the dual roles of distracted, pipe-smoking astronomer Dr. Ted Lewis and the come-in-peace alien Urp, who temporarily takes over Lewis' body. A good, gruff police chief (Dan Lauria) and a more sinister cop (Robert Patrick, who better?) stand for the law. And in a gender update, the designated female honey (Jenni Baird) doesn't scream, or trip and twist her ankle: She thinks on her feet, helping Urp as he tries to save Earth.

 A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless hommage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear, “Alien Trespass” proves only that while styles and technology have moved on, the affection for corn is everlasting.  Spearheading this retro revival is Eric McCormack as a prissy astronomer whose cardigan-sweatered body is co-opted in the first act by a foil-wrapped alien. “My name is Urp,” he announces to a perky diner waitress (a scene-stealing Jenni Baird).  “Would you like some Rolaids?” she inquires brightly, demonstrating the script’s notion of humor and her own deadpan skills. But as Urp tracks a tentacled beastie by means of the sticky remains of its human dinners, we wait in vain for the director, R. W. Goodwin, to display more than just fan-boy obsession. Substituting period accuracy — a keening theremin, a rubbery monster and a cast of 10s — for ideas, he and his writers (James Swift and Steven Fisher) stay well clear of the mushroom-clouded corners of the American psyche.  As a result the cast is compelled to play along without wink or subtext, a skill at which the women excel. Fortified with Cross-Your-Heart technology and gorgeous makeup, Ms. Baird and Jody Thompson (as  the scientist’s silky, hot-to-trot wife) act their male colleagues into the margins. Compared with wrangling foundation garments and seamed stockings, besting monsters is a breeze.  “Alien Trespass” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A phallus-shaped monster and a human-shaped alien.

Good silly fun, "Alien Trespass" is a dead-on spoof of cheapo '50s sci-fi programmers done with plenty of self-deprecating humor. Producer-director and longtime "X-Files" intimate R. W. Goodwin clearly knows the territory; the pic gets away with presenting itself as a long-lost classic from a half-century ago while simultaneously sending up the genre's conventions. Set to begin its gradual theatrical launch April 3, this Roadshow Attractions pickup holds appeal to several audience niches, including fanboys, kids and families looking for some laughs, but could ultimately be just too tame and devotedly retro to break out beyond specialty release. Subsequent DVD future looks rosy.
Goodwin, scripter Steven P. Fisher and co-story scribe and exec producer James Swift root their yarn most specifically in Jack Arnold's 1953 classic "It Came From Outer Space," about a crashed alien spacecraft whose passengers inhabit the bodies of local humans while repairs are made, and to a lesser extent in "The Day the Earth Stood Still"; would that this were the only contempo film to pay homage to Robert Wise's 1951 trailblazer.
In an opening that can't help but recall "Citizen Kane" (rest assured it's the only way the two films can be compared), the pic opens with a black-and-white newsreel in which a Hollywood studio head announces the release of a production called "Alien Trespass" has been canceled, its negatives and existing prints burned.
The feature presentation on the "program," however, is that very same picture, which blazes upon the screen in practically radioactive color with the sight of shooting stars and meteorites zipping across the Mojave night sky. One of these nocturnal apparitions, however, is not a piece of a rock but rather a flying saucer that slams into a craggy mountain range.
The crash site attracts the interest of assorted smalltown locals, including hormonal teens, an old desert coot and the cops. But the first one up there is tweedy, bespectacled, pipe-chewing scientist Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack, quite amusing), who enters the ship, only to be snapped up by unseen forces. When he reemerges and returns home, he looks the same but speaks about himself in a third-person monotone to his wife Lana (Jody Thompson), as in "Ted wants you safe."
Ted, it turns out, is temporarily inhabited by a spaceman named Urp. Curiously unmoved by perpetually in-heat Lana, Urp does detect unfamiliar sensations when in proximity to blond waitress Tammy (Jenni Baird), a bright lady who needs to find a way out of town. But Urp is mainly concerned with apprehending the Ghota, a tentacled monster with one large red eye that rapidly devours its way through most of the supporting cast, leaving behind only gooey puddles.
The patently phony Ghota reps a delightful throwback to the rubber sci-fi creatures of '50s drive-in fare. Because it can render itself temporarily invisible, the Ghota can make abrupt appearances that are actually momentarily scary in a very PG sort of way, and it has its big moment in a wonderfully conceived sequence in which it invades a movie theater where a gaggle of dating teens is held spellbound watching the 1958 "The Blob."
Although full of jokes at the genre's expense, "Alien Trespass" doesn't take the "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun" route of all-goof, all-the-time parody, nor is it nearly as funny as those laff-fests. But by playing it straighter, the film does come very close indeed to replicating the sensibility of its inspirations while still inspiring mirth.
Goodwin orchestrates it all confidently, from the earnest tenor of the performances to the impeccably dodgy technical specifications. Rear projection is used wittily, the special effects are charmingly shabby and the Canadian locations, subbing for California, are just right. Holding it all together is a superb score by Louis Febre that exactly captures the melodramatic mystery of the best sci-fi scores -- notably those by Bernard Herrmann -- right down to the judicious use of a quivering Theremin.
At the Palm Springs Fest screening caught, the house lights were turned up and the film turned off the moment the end credits went onscreen, so running time is an estimate that coincides with that provided by the producers.

What's most admirable about onetime X-Files   producer R.W. Goodwin 's Alien Trespass , a simulacra of the '50s flying-saucer flick, is its bypassing of the wink-wink condescension that usually defines screen flashbacks to the Eisenhower era. Its problem is the absence of any detectable personality in place of that wink. The plot is straight Amazing Stories  boilerplate. Dateline 1957: A "meteoroid" touchdown in the Mojave  crash-lands an intergalactic marshal and his prey-a faux-cheap one-eyed purple people-melter a la It Conquered the World . All attention seems to have gone into the period's surface elements (though the pseudo-Technicolor saturation doesn't jive with the black-and-white B-picture material). There's Jody Thompson  as a Good Housekeeping   covergirl in her halter-neck print dresses, mint finback Chevy rentals, and all the proper tropes herded into place: disbelieving small-town constabulary; a tabloid-addled hick; necking teenagers; and a final, contemplative "We're not alone" monologue. But the pleasures of genre depend on invention within margins, not just prop department scavenger hunting. It's hard to see why Alien Trespass  seemed necessary with the well of mid-century sci-fi homage having already been memorably visited by-off the top of my head-Matinee , Maniac Mansion , that The Blob  remake, Mars Attacks!  . . . (the last worthwhile thing Tim Burton  touched). All that's here is diluted nostalgia and Johnny Rockets decor.
