         Every once in a while a veteran character actor, after a solid career in films, theater and television, lands a starring role in a movie that is actually worthy of his talent. With "Fighting Tommy Riley" it has happened to Eddie Jones, and he brings the experience of a lifetime in acting to making his character, Marty Goldberg, unforgettable.
 
  Marty has pretty much given up the battle of his own bulge, and the portly, white-haired high school teacher has learned to expect that quotes from Melville, although spoken by him with the utmost eloquence and understanding, are going to be lost on his students. Not in the best of health, he is a solitary man on the threshold of a lonely old age, living in a book-filled home with his beloved pug. Marty, however, once had another life, as a promising boxer and later as a trainer.
 


         






    The one person who seems to care for him is a forceful young woman, Diane (Diane M. Tayler), a boxing promoter who considers Marty her partner because he steered her away from a path of self-destruction. Diane has come across a moody, insecure young fighter named Tommy Riley (J.P. Davis, who also wrote the film's exceptional script) in whom she sees potential, and she persuades Marty to become his trainer.
 
  It takes a while for the introverted Tommy to begin to trust Marty, but once he does he begins to come alive outside the ring as well as inside it. By the same token it is clear that Marty is in better spirits than he has been in a very long time, and the month the two men intend to spend at Marty's mountain cabin, where they will prepare for Tommy's big match, looks to be an especially happy period for both of them.
 
  Both Davis' script and Eddie O'Flaherty's direction match Jones' performance in subtlety. From the first moment Marty appears there seems to be a shadow hovering over him, and there are signs of an ingrained, unshakable sadness in him. It's not surprising that in time Marty should feel love for Tommy or that the boxer begin to regard Marty as a father figure. There comes a moment of realization when the nature of Marty's feelings becomes clear, and there is at this point a shift in focus, from the consideration of the complex interplay of secrecy and repression within Marty to the contradictory feelings that sweep over the deeply loyal Tommy.
 
  The boxing sequences in "Fighting Tommy Riley" are intense and convincing, but as with "Million Dollar Baby" it's what happens outside the ring that lingers in the heart. In watching Jones become Marty it's easy to see how Jones won prizes for his portrayal of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" on stage. Jones knows how to reach so deep inside himself and is in such command of his acting skills that Marty's every gesture, look and movement is expressive and revealing — even when it means to be concealing. Davis' Tommy is no less fully realized, and Tayler's Diane is also well drawn. Christina Chambers is effective as Tommy's uncomplicated girlfriend, who does not always understand him, which figures because he's often struggling to understand himself.
 
  This small, lovingly crafted film continually surprises with its depth and resonance.

n "Fighting Tommy Riley," another boxing drama is asking audiences to gird themselves for more emotional gut punches. Like "Million Dollar Baby," the pugilist is blessed with the luck of the Irish but cursed by that culture's penchant for calamity. The film, like its Oscar-winning precursor, dwells on a super-close bond between trainer and fighter, but unlike that previous male-female model, this male-to-male dynamic takes on some sexual complications. Tommy Riley (J. P. Davis) is a poor but noble prospect, who has yet to regain his footing after missteps in the Olympic trials. He wins the attention and affection of a corpulent, aging bachelor with his own losses to live down. Marty Goldberg, played by Eddie Jones, teaches Melville to high schoolers and seems more like another McCourt brother than a scrappy Jewish salt. Either way, he is a philosophizing gym rat, and he uses his stentorian aphorisms to make himself a Gandalf-style mentor to the impressionable Tommy. "Whatever special is, in this madness, I think you've got it," Marty tells him. There are many clunky lines that work on Tommy but not the audience, who can detect more quickly than the fighter what this old softie is after. The trainer turns his prizefighter into his own prize, an object that he extracts from its normal setting and admires away from the rest of the world. He invents absurd rules for Tommy to follow, as when he forbids jogging to music since there will be none heard in the ring. It's all part of a regimen of workouts and rubdowns that are meant to foster ferocity in the ring but dependency outside of it. The splendid cinematography favors somber blues and grays in the alleys and unadorned sparring places, and then the film bursts with color when the action travels to a lakeside retreat. There are, unfortunately, many visual clich�s, like the training montage with sports-page headlines scrolling across the screen. The performances are more pretty than gritty, and Mr. Davis is too handsome to appear all that desperate. Then, in one of many unsubtle pronouncements, the secretive Marty spills his own beans: "You never know what tragedies lie in a person's wake. You only know what I let you see." Despite its flaws, the film gets across some genuine melancholy, played up by a sobbing Irish fiddle. The last act dodges and weaves with a well-played episode about sexual bargaining, and again the filmmaker proves that tragedy is best delivered to a heterosexual male audience through a sports context. That said, the pain that "Fighting Tommy Riley" inflicts is an apt payoff, not a sucker punch. "Fighting Tommy Riley" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief scenes of male nudity, adult situations and strong language.

A correction was made to this review on July 15, 2004.
In "Fighting Tommy Riley," the winner by a knockout is Eddie Jones. The vet thesp, regularly seen in colorful supporting roles, flexes his considerable muscles as an aging trainer helping revive the career of a boxer who has lost faith in himself. Without Jones, pic is a standard drama on the sweet science with the usual tropes and a slight tweak on the usual conflicts. With Jones, matchups with fests and distribs are possible, while the cable arena is a sure thing.

Tommy (screenwriter J.P. Davis), all pumped up for his match, mentally flashes back seven months to the time he and g.f. Stephanie (Christina Chambers) broke up and when he was berated in a boxing gym for being too aggressive. But his low point was witnessed by boxing manager Diane Stone (Diane M. Tayler) and her partner-trainer Marty (Jones), who liked what he saw in the kid.
At first, Marty appears to be the stock figure typical in boxing movies, the older, wiser man who sees greatness where others see a loser. Marty starts by testing Tommy in a gym match against a tough sparring partner, while reminding the short-fused boxer that he needs a bit of anger management.
In the heart-to-heart scenes between Marty and Tommy -- so obligatory in the genre and so often phoned in by actors -- Jones personally pushes the movie to a higher emotional plane. An actor who tends not to just inhabit his roles but move right in and take over the mortgage, Jones appears to understand Marty's empathy for Tommy at a gut level. Jones' Marty is several divisions and degrees away from Burgess Meredith's needling codger in "Rocky," and smart enough to spot Tommy's habit of faking injuries.
Director Eddie O'Flaherty demonstrates a flair for widescreen framing, but keeps to a routine moviemaking style (d.p. Michael Fimognari's vid-lensed image was undercut by vid projection at the Los Angeles fest premiere, though a film transfer is promised). Montages of Tommy's fresh string of victories alternate with private dramas between him and Marty, and then Stephanie, who returns to the picture a little too easily.
A retreat to the woods for training before a title bout raises the stakes, even as Tommy gets pressure from powerful, smooth-tongued fight promoter Bob Silver (Paul Raci) to sign with him and leave Marty. The old trainer has his own secrets and desires, which Jones manages to keep so well hidden that when they burst forth, it has the shock of a jolting scene in an Arthur Miller play. The film doesn't end in Milleresque tragedy, though, but with a grown-up sense of loss.
Davis seems initially too good-looking to take seriously, but he grows into a role he wrote for himself, and Tayler does a pro job of playing counterpoint to whatever Marty has to say. Though it always feels too staged when the action's outside the ring, pic has a sweaty background feel that's impressive for an indie production, and fight scenes play like the real deal. Print screened contained wall-to-wall temp tracks from some of Thomas Newman's and Hans Zimmer's better, moodier scores.

June 1 GARDEN STATE  (Zach Braff , 2004) Best-known for his role as a retarded quarterback, anhedonic actor-waiter Andrew "Large" Largeman (Zach Braff) comes home to New Jersey for his mom's funeral. Why hasn't he spoken to his folks in nine yearsand what's with all the mood stabilizers? Braff's triple threat has a patient way with information. The tragic backstory fills in gradually, and the slow reveal feels accurate rather than merely suspenseful. Then there are the goofier, permanent gaps: After an evening of detached debauchery, Large finds "BALLS" inexplicably Magic Markered on his forehead. PARK

June 15 SUPER SIZE ME  (Morgan Spurlock , 2004) Appetite suppressant, frat boy stunt, and anti-corporate head butt, Spurlock's self-starring documentary records the amusingly horrifying consequences of the director's 30-day McDonald's-only diet. The film, which exerts the gross-out fascination of reality TV's muckier specimens, has nothing new to say about America's fast-food addiction and obesity epidemic, but there's no denying its grotesque effectiveness as a work of public health advocacy. Fighting grease with grease, it's a film that has its severely taxed heart in the right place. LIM

July 27 THE AVIATOR (Martin Scorsese , 2004) Scorsese, our foremost moviemaking cinephile, cannonballs into old Hollywood  to tell the story of one Howard Hughes , billionaire, briber, star fucker, plane crasher, occasional movie producer, and all-around neurotic shit storm. Gigantic, blustery, and stuffed with cameoed details (Cate Blanchett 's riff on Katharine Hepburn  makes her the dead legend's avatar), it's a biopic paradigmand an American-dream-gone-rancid tale bidding to complement Raging Bull .

August 3 FINDING NEVERLAND  (Marc Forster , 2004) Johnny Depp  gives an unusually subdued performance as J.M. Barrie , who in befriending a young widow (Kate Winslet ) and her four sons, received the inspiration for his 1905 play Peter Pan  . Inhabiting a green, empty England in endless Edwardian summer, Marc Forster's first film since Monster's Ball  raises all manner of red flags with its surfeit of loaded themesbeatifying illness, bereft children, escapist fantasy, the enshrining of boyhoodbut overall practices a tasteful restraint.

The Big Lebowski intermittently references The Big Sleep  but this wacky series of L.A. adventures featuring a stoned slacker as a surrogate Philip Marlowe  is pure pop ruminationso relaxed as to be nearly free-associative.

August 24 DAZED AND CONFUSED  (Richard Linklater , 1993) No less structuralist than Slacker expressing a fierce muddle of memories rather than a rambling paranoiathis mini-masterpiece about 1970s Texas high school kids inhabiting their self-defined universe is one of the most rewatchable films of its decade, capturing its time and place with anthropological care.

An unstoppable good-mood generator, this resolutely 2-D vehicle has more yuks than Shark Tale  and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express  whole. It's a kids' movie that deigns to understand what kids want to seehysterical amplifications of kid-like behavior and the making fun of oldsters, rather than the pop-cult winking and cruddy nostalgia that said oldsters presumably favor. To wit: When King Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor ) discloses his shiny pate, onlookers shriek, "Bald! Bald!" and "My eyes!" PARK
