         Filmmaker Len Morris' densely packed informational documentary on child labor, "Stolen Childhoods," crisscrosses the globe, visiting eight countries — including the United States — to illustrate the severity of the circumstances under which a reported 246 million children toil. An impassioned plea for change, the film balances bleak, Dickensian conditions with details of a growing number of international programs designed to combat the epidemic.
 
  From a carpet loom in India and a coffee farm in Kenya to a bordello in Mexico City and garbage dumps in Brazil, Morris and his crew traveled to chronicle what Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) calls "the last form of slavery." Interviews with children, some of whom have worked since they were 4, describe kidnapping, enslavement, exposure to dangerous pesticides and worse.
 


         






    Narrated by Meryl Streep, the film thoughtfully lays out the facts while highlighting various programs that aim to eliminate economic incentives to exploit children, and to return them to their families, enabling them to go to school. Although some countries still pay lip service to existing laws prohibiting child labor, others are home to uncompromising advocates of children's rights working tirelessly to end these practices.

 Plunging into 'Deep Blue'
 
 
Numerous films have explored undersea life, but few as comprehensively and as consistently compelling as "Deep Blue," by the creators of the "Blue Planet" TV series. Five years in the making, with 20 camera teams dispatched to about 250 worldwide locations, "Deep Blue" is beautifully structured as it traverses the ocean between the poles and countless points in between. Besides its sheer comprehensiveness, this film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Andy Byatt, differs from most other nature films in its utter lack of sentimentality. Narrator Pierce Brosnan observes up front that sea creatures live in "constant jeopardy" within "the eternal cycle of birth, death and renewal." Nature movies seem reflexively to be rated G, but parents should know that this film is highlighted by some intensely brutal Darwinian sequences: a 30-ton gray whale mother deeply protective of her calf but unable to save it from predators; adorable baby seals becoming acquainted with the ocean only to be savagely devoured by whales; a great swarm of sardines under simultaneous attack by multiple predators — and more.
 
  There is also, of course, much awe-inspiring grandeur, especially in the film's extensive undersea sequences. "Deep Blue" even travels 15,000 feet beneath the surface, a lightless, oxygen-deprived region where stalagmite-like chimneys 16 stories tall belch hydrogen sulfide yet harbor among the largest number of species found anywhere on Earth. Having presented innumerable wondrous creatures, "Deep Blue" ends on a quietly sobering note: The oceans once were home to 300,000 blue whales; today, their population has been reduced to 1% of that number.

Sunset 5, (323) 848-3500. (1:30) Rated G (general audiences).   

ature documentaries, long a staple of television and the Imax screen, have increasingly found a place on regular film screens as well. "Deep Blue," from the directors Alastair Fothergill and Andy Byatt, delves into the vast, mystifying world of the ocean, which they navigated for years in their acclaimed BBC series "The Blue Planet." The United States theatrical version (following last year's British edition), a more visual and less informative re-assemblage of the mounds of footage shot for the show, is alternately mind-blowing and mind-numbing. Through a trite narration by the eternally suave Pierce Brosnan and a lush, often overdone score by the celebrated British composer George Fenton, viewers are guided to the far reaches of the world, where an assortment of sea critters are displayed in their natural environments. Sharks, whales, dolphins, polar bears and emperor penguins (also the subject of another new big-screen documentary, "March of the Penguins") swim, frolic, hunt and are hunted, in the depths of the ocean and on the surface of the ice. In addition to the usual suspects, some truly amazing specimens are found: plantlike sea horses, lacy jellyfish that resemble psychedelic sliced cucumbers and even a beautiful silver tornado of sardines. Much of what the filmmakers and their team of cinematographers capture is undeniably remarkable, but their overt attachment to certain scenes can make watching a chore. Massive waves, seen just as impressively in every surfing film ever made, and dolphins repetitiously spiraling out of the water are held on-screen far too long. And in the most gratuitous bit, an orca slaughters a baby sea lion and proceeds to throw the carcass high into the air over and over again. It is in the chasms, way beyond the reaches of the sun, that "Deep Blue" is most fascinating. The cinematic locale, which could pass for an alien planet, and the rarely sighted freak show of deep-sea creatures that inhabit it, are so exotic they would be the envy of any science-fiction film. It is certainly honorable to try to raise awareness about the more than 70 percent of planet Earth that is still predominantly unknown (some sections have been explored less frequently than the moon), but the experience of "Deep Blue" is hardly enlightening. In the end, a sliver of knowledge may be gained, or environmental concerns only briefly alluded to might be pondered, but mostly what remains are pretty pictures that quickly fade into oblivion.

What "Microcosmos" did for creepy crawlies and "Winged Migration" did for our feathered friends, "Deep Blue" now does for ocean dwellers. An offshoot of David Attenborough's much-admired BBC docu series "The Blue Planet," this majestic film has all the hallmarks of Beeb quality workmanship -- jaw-dropping, sumptuous visuals, a lush George Fenton score, state-of-the-art technology and some of the oddest creatures ever seen without recourse to artificial stimulants. Pre-sales for this family-friendly film have been strong, and niche pickups should be equally so. 
Shot on a $5 million budget over three years at a range of locations -- including the Maldives, Azores, Cayman Islands and Bermuda -- pic is structured in 22 sections, each focusing on an aspect of ocean life, and each with its own mood. Like "Winged Migration," the film is more interested in generating emotion than supplying fact. (Unfortunately, it's not shot in widescreen, presumably because of its tube origins.)
Mood is often violent -- a killer whale moving onto a beach to steal sea-lion pups, or dolphins, tuna and shearwaters in a feeding frenzy that shows them to be participants in a dangerous dance. But it is sometimes humorous, with thousands of crabs emerging from their holes in the sand to a salsa beat.
One particularly tense sequence has a 30-ton gray whale mother and her calf interrupted in their 6,000 mile journey by a pod of killer whales intent on separating the calf and drowning it. After a lengthy struggle, the whales succeed, and the mother, movingly, continues her journey alone. Also, coral reefs, often shown in docus as tranquil places, are revealed to be sometimes treacherous, as a whale shark glides onto the screen.
Footage from the surface -- polar bears, emperor penguins -- is impressively lensed and framed. One image, of hundreds of sleek, fat penguins huddled together against an Antarctic storm as part of their three-month journey across an icy wasteland, is unforgettable. But it is the underwater work, shot at depths of up to 16,500 feet, that stands out. The images have a precision and clarity more synonymous with CGI nowadays, the screen filling with unexplained but always spectacular forms, colors and textures. Pic claims to have discovered new species--not so surprising given that more is known about the surfact of the moon than the ocean floor.
The anthropomorphic commentary, delivered by Michael Gambon, is stately but almost too spare in details: Mood takes precedence over even basic info like the names of some creatures. Fenton's score suggests the degree of order at work in nature and is perfectly synchronized to the images but sometimes bland.
The greatest danger to all this teeming life -- man -- is left until the end, with the commentary explaining that humans have hunted the planet's largest creature, the blue whale, to 1% of its former levels.

Rock of underages: Kids get Zap-tized by tyrannical tutor
The short-fused motormouth who runs the Paul Green School of Rock Music , an after-school program for nine-to-17-year-olds in Philadelphia , has claimed, not unreasonably, to be the inspiration for Jack Black 's character in School of Rock. But where Richard Linklater 's movie approached its central incongruitythe idea that anti-establishment rock can and should be schooled with a breezy mix of ironic farce and fuck-the-Man feelgoodism, Paul Green , the frustrated musician and self-proclaimed "really good teacher" at the center of this documentary, embraces the same philosophy with grim, cranky resolve. Students like Madi, a Quaker folkie, and Will, the resident depressive, attest that rock school is a misfit sanctuary and that Green's manic tantrums serve a motivational purpose. In any case, as Will deadpans, "It's a lovable quirk that he's mentally disturbed."
But with his Hannibal Lecter  impersonations, Vietnam  P.O.W. re-enactments, and borderline abusive teasing, Green tends to be more actively unpleasant than amusing. He almost gets misty-eyed envisioning a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone : "Where did all these bands come from? All of a sudden they start tracing stuff back to me." Given that Green's curriculum is even more ossified than his fictional counterpart's, this immodest forecast assumes the resurgent popularity of Frank Zappa -style art-prog. There's plenty of talent on display12-year-old guitar prodigy CJ kills every time he's onbut as the kids dutifully make the pilgrimage to Germany 's tribute-band Zappanale, it's depressingly clear whose dreams they're acting out. (Is it really fair to be force-feeding drug music to listeners who aren't, um, properly equipped to enjoy it?) Don Argott's lively documentary, ostensibly a paean to alternative pedagogy, extends its subject a long leash, and he in turn does his damnedest to sabotage the project. Rock School ends up being a movie about just how little fun rock 'n' roll can be.
