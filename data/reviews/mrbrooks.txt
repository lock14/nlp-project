Serial killers are a dime a dozen in this often beguiling but essentially ludicrous movie that flirts with the idea that the urge to kill is just another one of the pesky addiction problems that plagues modern society. In fact, the film even shows our buttoned-down serial killer, Earl Brooks (Costner) � aka Portland, Ore.'s Man of the Year � attending AA meetings and reciting the Serenity Prayer in his attempts to stave off his addictive impulses. Costner is great here as the two-sided monster: one, a successful, bow-tie-wearing box manufacturer and devoted family man who has a picture-book life; the other, a psychotic yet methodical murderer of selected strangers, who is known to the cops as the Thumbprint Killer. So far, so good, but then director and co-writer Evans starts piling on the subplots and general nastiness to a point that surpasses all credibility and, sometimes, even coherence. The most glaring narrative conceit gives full life to Earl's id in the form of William Hurt, whom Earl calls Marshall. Earl and Marshall have full conversations in which Marshall goads Earl into giving in to his desires, yet no one but Earl sees the 200-pound Marshall in the room or hears him speaking out loud to his life-sized id. Add in a neighbor (Cook), who happens upon one of the murders, but instead of going to the cops or seeking to blackmail Mr. Brooks, all he wants is to come along and learn the killing trade from such a pro. Then there's the detective (Moore), an heiress who works as a cop and who has tracked the Thumbprint Killer over the years. Somehow, two messy issues from her current life become convenient fodder for Earl's murderous escapades: her messy divorce hearings and the sudden escape from prison of yet another killer she previously put behind bars. As the killers and would-be killers on the loose mount, Earl's daughter, Jane (Panabaker), suddenly returns home from college, seemingly on a whim. But her father seems to fear the worst: His homicidal impulses might be a hereditary addiction. By the time the police come knocking at the front door, Mr. Brooks
 has exploded from its mild-mannered start into full Guignol mode, and it would take a defter filmmaker than Evans to steer the tonal shift. The film is overburdened with plot elements (yet misses various continuity details). Still, it's a real trip to hear the acting pros, Costner and Hurt, cackling in unison as Mr. Brooks chalks up another one for his id.


Mr. Brooks runs a successful box company in the Pacific Northwest. He's solidly upper-middle-class, has a wife, a daughter , and a partiality to bow ties. He's a pillar of the community. He likes to murder people.
It isn't the most original idea for a movie -- the bland, all-American face of evil -- but when that movie stars Kevin Costner as the serial killer, you tend to sit up and take notice. "Mr. Brooks" is Cost- ner's attempt to shake up his somnolent Marlboro-man image, to go to the dark side and get audiences interested in him again, and as long as it's focused on his character (or characters; more on that below), it's funny, dirty, thrilling stuff: Grade-A pulp.
But why be content with one plot when you can have several crashing into each other? "Mr. Brooks" is also a fertile example of the Studio Film Gone Berserk, where too many characters and too many story lines geometrically progress until a level of blissful absurdity is reached. There are three movies crammed into this one: The first is good, the second is so bad it's good, and the third is just plain bad. That's still three times the bargain most movies offer.
The good movie stars Costner as Earl Brooks , who has kept the lid on his homicidal addiction for several years before the movie opens, whereupon it starts calling to him again. Or, rather, he 
starts calling: he 
being "Marshall ," Brooks's malevolent inner demon, played by William Hurt with the glee of uncut Id. Marshall sits in the back seat, whispering murder into the rearview mirror as Earl drives home from a banquet with his lovely wife (Marg Helgenberger ). Marshall is every awful thought you've tried to repress.
The slaughter of random innocents that follows is a shocker: brutal and fast, very aware of the sexual charge Brooks gets from the act. It's in no way fun, though, at least for Earl, who begs Marshall to set him free. It is enjoyable, however, for the sleazy little slacker (comedian Dane Cook ), who witnesses the killing and blackmails Brooks into letting him come along next time.
A dark mentor/disciple relationship develops, with Marshall urging bloody mayhem from the sidelines of the hero's skull. "Mr. Brooks" is witty enough -- just -- to make the distinction between serial killers driven by inner compulsion and soulless modern kids bored by YouTube and looking for the next big kick.
Meanwhile -- here's the so-bad-it's-good story line -- police detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore ) is obsessively following Earl's bloody trail while dealing with (a) the fallout of her divorce from a smarmy playboy (Jason Lewis ), (b) an escaped killer (Matt Schulze ) who wants revenge, and (c) the burden of being an independently wealthy civil servant. Any one of these would suffice for its own movie, but our Tracy's a multitasker.
Indeed, Moore is so grimly purposeful that it's hard not to get the giggles. The older she gets, the more the actress reminds me of late-period Joan Crawford : same rigid face and bulldog ferocity, same air of lunatic conviction. Whatever movie Moore's in, or thinks she's in, she's the queen bee.
The third plot thread involves Earl's college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker ) and I won't spoil it other than to say that it just doesn't work, primarily because the filmmakers have their hands too full to develop it properly. No, the reason you're here -- and you should be here if you have the proper reverence for clever genre sadism and slumming stars -- is the sanguine triangle between Earl, Marshall, and "Mr. Smith," as the blackmailer dubs himself.
Costner and Hurt play together deliciously well. They're like the "Sideways" duo of introvert and extrovert sandwiched into one psychological ham-on-wry. (Cook, freed of the burden of being the hot new thing, graciously steps back and lets the old boys have their way.) A bit in which Earl and Marshall share a nasty laugh over Smith's naivete is so inspired that director Bruce A. Evans (who co-wrote the script with Raynold Gideon ) unnecessarily repeats it a few minutes later.
That's true of the movie as a whole: It's never quite as smart as its central concept or performances. Evans keeps nudging Earl in the direction of a Hannibal Lecter -style omniscient genius -- what's with the scene where Mr. Brooks breezily hacks into Detective Atwood's tax records? Despite that, nothing's as simple or unnerving as the frustrated little moan Costner lets out when Earl burns the photos of his bloody night's work.
That moan is the lament of a white-collar drone who knows his real worth will never be recognized. When it's not completely flipping out, "Mr. Brooks" says that work may be important, but ultimately it's secondary. It's our hobbies that define who we are.


         Earl Brooks is no ordinary serial killer. He's got a secret closet where identical serial-killer outfits hang above a row of matching black boots, and he has all the latest in serial-killer gadgets. He's the Batman of serial killers.
 
 As played by Kevin Costner in the dysfunctional thriller "Mr. Brooks," the character is a prodigious taker of lives. He lives to kill, egged on by a wisecracking doppelgänger — part famished id, part rationalizing ego — named Marshall (William Hurt). The only problem is that Earl wants to stop. He has a beautiful wife (Marg Helgenberger), a daughter in college (Danielle Panabaker), a house straight out of Architectural Digest and, in the film's opening scenes, he's honored as man of the year of Portland, Ore.
 


         






   The whole killing thing is starting to wear on him, but he might as well face it — he's addicted to blood.
 
 The movie is a bold variant on the serial-killer genre with some significant deviations. Written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (the pair scripted "Stand By Me" among some lesser-known credits) and directed by Evans, "Mr. Brooks" treats murder as an addiction. Earl is viewed less as a monster than as someone who has difficulty suppressing a particularly egregious appetite.
 
 The comparison is taken to the extent that Earl attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (specifying only that he is an addict) and periodically mutters the "Serenity Prayer" in times of weakness. Evans and Gideon never really succeed in selling the idea that serial killing is a disease — which would require a degree of realism that the slick, over-plotted "Mr. Brooks" doesn't otherwise aspire to. They seem to be content with occupying the audience with a series of twists and jolts.
 
 The filmmakers have constructed a complex web of subplots that abut the main story line and include the desire of a fan of Mr. Brooks' work (Dane Cook) to go on a ride-along, the unexpected return of Brooks' daughter from college, the ongoing divorce woes of a detective (Demi Moore) working the case and ... the escape of another killer the detective once put away. To their credit, Evans and Gideon somehow manage to tie them all together in the end, but in the meantime, much of the buildup is a snooze.
 
 Although there are weak spots throughout, the nasty divorce negotiations of Det. Atwood (Moore), a multimillionaire cop (don't ask) whose sleazy ex (Jason Lewis) is seeking spousal support, particularly take away from the film's suspense. Actually, anything that steals focus from the existential patter between Earl and Marshall weakens the movie.
 
 Marshall is seen and heard only by Earl Brooks, and the interplay between the two is, at times, inspired. It gives the film a darkly comic component that propels it through some lulls and keeps it from becoming too self-important. The "relationship," which provides most of what we know about what makes Brooks tick, likely could have been mined further.
 
 Like many movie stars, Costner doesn't always get his due as an actor. He's played criminals before — notably in Clint Eastwood's underappreciated "A Perfect World" — but never before has he appeared to have so much fun being bad.
 
 He's given some silly things to do, such as the near-orgasmic trance he falls into while killing, but Costner approaches the character simply as a man with objectives. He doesn't play Brooks as demented but carries out a series of discordant actions that illustrate the lunacy.
 
 The supreme confidence the actor brings to his roles is what makes him effective. We believe him as a ballplayer because he can handle a bat. We buy him as a cowboy because he looks comfortable on a horse and with a gun. Here, he's a credible businessman, father and, yes, serial killer, because he approaches them all with equal deliberation.
 
 The film probably tilts the balance too far in favor of Mr. Brooks at the expense of the uninspired Det. Atwood. There's never really a moment when the audience isn't rooting for Brooks, and more of a "Silence of the Lambs" equilibrium between the two would have yielded a more rewarding film.
 
 
 "Mr. Brooks." MPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence, some graphic sexual content, nudity and language. Running time: 2 hours. In general release.   

As the title psychopath of Mr. Brooks , Kevin Costner plays an executive good citizen  the kind of fellow who wins Man of the Year awards  who is also a brilliant serial killer, and the actor, looking sleek in dark hair, with that politician's wary fish-lipped smile, slips into this image-shifting role as if it were a crisply tailored suit. Mr. Brooks' homicidal desires may be invisible to the world, but they're right in front of us. The killer inside  his id, his Mr. Hyde  is played by William Hurt, who keeps popping up in Brooks' office or the back of his car, cackling with delight to goad him into another murder. It's a fascinating strategy: Hurt acts out the killer's sick inner child so that Costner doesn't have to.
Mr. Brooks  begins promisingly, but it grows steadily more preposterous as it goes along, becoming the first feel-good serial-killer movie. Dane Cook, still trapped in his innocuous comedy rhythms, turns up as a disturbed young man who has photographed (through a convenient open window shade) Brooks' latest handgun execution. He tries to blackmail the killer into taking him on his next ''outing,'' but their relationship converts the movie, in essence, into a far-fetched buddy film. Things just get worse from there. Did Brooks need to have a collegiate daughter who's a chip off the old psycho? And the Costner/Hurt duality should get thornier; instead, the film's notion of complication is to have these two collapse into a teary hug. Costner's bold career move turns out to be a thriller in which even the dark side cares.

 Who knew that serial killing is an addiction that sufferers hope to overcome by attending A.A. meetings and murmuring the serenity prayer? That, at least, is how the buttoned-up title character of “Mr. Brooks,”  a nutty variation of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” deals with such inconvenient urges. “I’m an addict,” he announces at a 12-step meeting while withholding the true nature of his cravings.  This preposterous character, played by Kevin Costner, is one of several afflicted with thrill-killing compulsions in a movie in which half the population of  Portland, Ore., seems to suffer from homicidal dementia.  Earl Brooks, a successful box manufacturer, is  the Portland Chamber of Commerce’s man of the year. A model citizen, ideal husband to his wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), and devoted father to his daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker), Earl leads a lurid double life.  As the notorious Thumbprint Killer, he is also a maniac whose specialty is slaughtering young lovers, arranging their bodies into amorous poses, meticulously vacuuming the crime scene and signing it with the victims’ thumbprints. Earl’s fiendish alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt) — an imaginary figure who leans over Earl’s shoulder while he’s driving — flashes an evil grin and tempts him with descriptions of the fun they could have if only Earl would give in to his darkest impulses.  “Mr. Brooks,” alas, is not a comedy. A werewolf movie masquerading as a thriller, it looks like a canny attempt by Bruce A. Evans, its director and screenwriter (with Raynold Gideon), to establish a “Saw”-like franchise using the names of fading ’80s stars to lend the project a semblance of respectability. If it is not as sadistic as the “Saw” and “Hostel” movies, it is as malignant in its insistence on the omnipresence of evil.  Another would-be killer is a peeping-Tom photographer calling himself Mr. Smith (the comedian Dane Cook), who observes Earl’s double murder of a couple who amuse their neighbors by having sex with the lights on and the shades open. Days after the crime he confronts Earl with his evidence and demands to be let in on the fun. He won’t go to the police if Earl takes him along on his next homicidal spree.  Also on the rampage is Thornton Meeks (Matt Schulze), a convicted serial killer known as the Hangman, who strings up his victims in public places and scrawls mocking graffiti on their corpses. Newly escaped from prison, this standard-issue monster makes a vengeful beeline for Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), the humorless police detective who sent him to jail. Because Tracy has also been assigned to the case of the Thumbprint Killer, she obviously has her hands full.  Finally there is Earl’s baby-faced daughter, who drops out of college in her freshman year claiming she is pregnant. When the police visit the Brooks home to question Jane about a classmate’s murder, Daddy instinctively senses the unbearable truth. “She has what I have,” he declares to Marshall, wringing his hands.  Now we know: Serial killing is in the blood, a curse passed down from generation to generation.  This tightly plotted movie throws in an extra subplot involving Tracy’s ugly divorce from a younger, cheating gigolo (Jason Lewis) whom she married on the rebound and who now demands millions. (The screenplay goes through elaborate contortions to try to explain why a wealthy heiress like Tracy would work as a policewoman, but the explanation doesn’t wash.)  Tracy is the most wooden screen performance of Ms. Moore’s career. Looking exhausted and tense, the actress is as expressive as a wax museum effigy. That is not the case with Mr. Costner and Mr. Hurt, who pull out the stops to play a horror-movie tag team. In their scenes together Mr. Costner’s sinister but tortured Earl and Mr. Hurt’s gleefully sociopathic Marshall do a sadomasochistic soft shoe of psychological bullying and whining.  Marshall is a creepy flesh-and-blood extrapolation of the inner voice inside anyone who has considered raising hell for the sheer thrill of it. In the world of “Mr. Brooks,” there’s no greater kick than acting like a really bad boy and getting away with it.  The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, profanity and gory violence. 

In this ogre-ridden, ocean-going summer of sequels, "Mr. Brooks" reps a classic case of counter-programming. Original, adult and starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer, this suspense thriller with a smirk may not break any B.O. records, but it should provide discriminating audiences the antidote they seek to Clooneys-and-Caribbean fever, while giving Costner's career a considerable kick in the credibility department. 
Costner's mere presence in this noirish Bruce A. Evans-helmed psycho-drama -- which Costner also produced, with longtime partner Jim Wilson and co-writer Raynold Gideon -- is an attention grabber. Although one of the actor's best performances was as murderer Butch Haynes in Clint Eastwood's "A Perfect World," "Mr. Brooks" takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward murder and portrays its serial killer as an addicted personality, who tries 12-stepping his way to a less-murderous lifestyle.
It would have been an entirely different movie with a more conventional star -- Anthony Hopkins springs to mind (as does "Silence of the Lambs''). But Costner delivers a complex cocktail of aloofness, insecurity and reluctant threat, which makes a novel script into something even more unusual.
Add Demi Moore as the detective on the killer's trail -- another case of mid-career adjustment -- and "Mr. Brooks" becomes as much about perception as it is a peculiar take on reality. By all appearances, Earl Brooks is a pillar of his community. He even receives Man of the Year honors from an unnamed group in his unnamed city, as his wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger) looks on adoringly. What none of the town folk--including Emma--know is that Earl has been murdering people for years -- expertly, strategically, cold-bloodedly.
Although he's been keeping his homicidal demons at bay by attending AA meetings, his conscience -- which has a name, Marshall, and is played by William Hurt -- is prodding him to break his tenuous self-imposed sobriety and spill fresh blood.
Enter the subplots: Tracy Atwood (Moore) is a predictably hard-as-nails detective who lost the so-called "Thumbprint Killer's" trail two years earlier and has other things on her mind -- for one, a gold digging, soon-to-be-ex-husband (Jason Lewis).
Earl, too, has tangential concerns: A daughter (Danielle Panabaker), who may or may not have inherited his serial-killer gene (the science of "Mr. Brooks" may leave some viewers bewildered). And once he falls off the wagon, killing a pair of dancers in their uncurtained bedroom, Mr. Brooks acquires a kind of apprentice, Mr. Smith (Dane Cook), who saw what Earl did and wants to go along for the thrill ride.
There are also a pair of crystal-meth freaks out to avenge themselves on Tracy, which provides the film its few shoot-'em-up moments and a car crash or two.
But "Mr. Brooks" is most effective when it's dealing with Earl and his conscience. Hurt and Costner are terrific together as two sides of the same personality and, again, the casting is what it's all about. Marshall could have been portrayed as a grotesque monster, but instead, he's a very close complement to Earl -- similar in age, temperament and physique.
John Lindley's subtle cinematography superbly delivers a morally dark film. Production values in general are topnotch.

Bloody disappointing, that's what Mr. Brooks is. Kevin Costner  plays a respectable Seattle businessman who kills for thrills, thanks to the goading of an imaginary friend who looks a whole lot like William Hurt . Costner's Earl Brooks  is such a square (appropriate, perhaps, for a man who made his fortune in box manufacturing) that he kills all of two people in the movie's first 90 minutes or so. If only Mr. Brooks  weren't trying so hard to make some point about the hereditary nature of addiction, it might have been fun. Instead we get a morality tale in which a father (Costner) passes along to his daughter (Danielle Panabaker ) his killer genes and then tries to reverse the cycle of addiction, lest his little girl wind up as tortured as he claims to be. Mr. Brooks mutters to himself the Serenity Prayer ("God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change . . . ") and goes to Alcoholics Anonymous  meetings (where he admits only to being "an addict"), but the device is hollow and ham-fisteda slight gag meant to elicit an ironic chuckle, not illuminate a character so barely fleshed out he's little more than a bespectacled skeleton firing blanks at the audience's heads.
