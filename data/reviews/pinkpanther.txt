What has happened to Steve Martin's film career? It's nothing but remakes, sequels, remakes of sequels, and sequels of remakes. In this pointless rehash of the 1964 Blake Edwards film that introduced Inspector Clouseau to the world, Martin "re-imagines" (the word used in the press materials) the role of the bumbling French detective without a trace of the comic genius of Peter Sellers. He doesn't come close to reimagining Sellers' inspired nuttiness: His attempts at physical comedy fall flat almost every time, and his prissy and fastidious mannerisms never go beyond the superficial. Martin seems much too aware of what he's doing all of the time � he's a postmodern wild and crazy guy in a role that requires a real actor, one with a comic technique. (Even Martin's French accent � which has traces of Elmer Fudd and Colonel Klink in it � seems painfully calculated for laughs.) The film's script about Clouseau's investigation of a murdered soccer coach is paper-thin, which wouldn't be a problem if Martin and his cast were up to some real funny business. Most of the time, the storyline makes no sense, particularly in those scenes featuring the bootylicious Knowles, whose eye-candy presence here is nothing more than an excuse for a pop single. The casting of Knowles also underscores the fact that this incarnation of  The Pink Panther
 has more in common with the  Austin Powers
 series than anything in which Sellers and Edwards ever collaborated. (There's even a flatulence joke here, no doubt in deference to the snaggle-toothed British secret agent's brand of humor.) Director Levy, who foisted another lousy Martin remake upon the American public (Cheaper by the Dozen)
, is completely inept when it comes to comic pacing; the dead space between the film's feeble attempts at humor acts like a vacuum, completely sucking up every possible laugh, titter, and guffaw that might follow. Ultimately, one has to chalk up  The Pink Panther
 to the good old traditions of Hollywood greed and chutzpah. Nothing this slapdash and badly executed is done for the love of movies.


Well, at least Steve Martin's trying
 to be funny again.
For months a black cloud of disaster has hovered over the remake of "The Pink Panther." Originally scheduled to open last summer, it was later moved to the cinematic dog days of February. Martin's own record of reworking comedy classics has run from the profitable lameness of the "Cheaper by the Dozen" movies to outright fiascoes like "Sgt. Bilko." The original Peter Sellers "Panther" movies -- the good ones, anyway -- are farces beloved by connoisseurs of precision slapstick. Things did not look good.
It's with palpable relief, then, that I can say this new version of the misadventures of Inspector Clouseau -- a prequel, officially -- isn't a black hole of unfunniness. Instead, it's another passably engaging Steve Martin vehicle: a few solid laughs, a lot of dead air, no earthly reason to exist. If it sends you out of the theater thirsting for the real thing, a box of five of the original movies has conveniently just arrived on DVD (minus 1975's "The Return of the Pink Panther," sadly, but including the best of the lot, 1964's "A Shot in the Dark").
If you've seen the trailer, with Martin's fey Clouseau mangling the pronunciation of "hamburger," you've seen the best gag in the movie. Still, the new "Panther" is harmless enough, even if it doesn't stand to advance Franco-American relations. A hard-charging Paris soccer coach (Jason Statham) has been murdered on the field and his priceless pink diamond ring stolen; suspicion falls on, among others, his pop singer girlfriend, Xania (Beyoncé Knowles). Vainglorious Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) assigns the worst police detective in France to head the case; that way, the boob will divert the media while he, Dreyfus, finds the killer and wins the French medal of honor.
Enter Martin in full gendarme regalia as Clouseau; no sooner has he taken the case than furniture gets broken, vases are smashed, and large metal globes go rolling into the streets to take out the front line of the Tour de France. Clouseau is assigned a watchdog assistant in the person of detective Gilbert Ponton, played by Jean Reno with the embarrassment proper to a French actor in a movie where everyone else talks wiz foony acc-zents.
This includes Kline, who trots out his crack "Fish Called Wanda" timing, and England's Emily Mortimer as Clouseau's pert klutz of a secretary. Knowles, for her part, acts with her cleavage, her singing voice, and her big, brown eyes, which is enough to bowl over Clouseau and at least half of the audience. Clive Owen has a cameo as a smooth British secret agent; since Daniel Craig has been cast as the next James Bond, this is clearly as close as Owen's going to get.
Very occasionally, the new "Panther" approaches the droll hilarity of the original movies -- a sight gag involving magnifying goggles is played beautifully straight -- but more often than not, Martin winks at the audience to let us know he knows
 he's being silly. Worse, the script makes the mistake of letting Clouseau solve the case legitimately rather than bumble serenely to victory, and that goes against everything Sellers and the old "Pink Panther" movies stood for. Suffice to say that Shawn Levy, director of the "Cheaper by the Dozen" movies, is no Blake Edwards; for every finely tuned slapstick fillip, there's a ton of messy, family-friendly buffoonery.
It's all in the balance. Not all of the old "Pink Panther" movies had it, but at Sellers's peak, his Clouseau struck a perfect, clueless poise between idiocy and refinement -- between the suave gesture and the bone-rattling pratfall. Those movies were comedy ballet. The best Martin can do here, in one all-too-brief scene, is an inspired wild-and-crazy frug.
.

         "For more than a decade, the beloved franchise has lain dormant," reads a rather delightfully florid passage in the publicity materials for the new "Pink Panther" movie, "its reintroduction to contemporary audiences reliant on finding the perfect actor to step into the late Sellers' shoes," conjuring images of Peter Sellers in a glass casket, surrounded by anxious dwarves debating how best to orchestrate his "reintroduction." It's an all-new spin on compulsive cinematic recycling: The Sleeping Beauty rationale.
 
  But does the grand "reintroduction" theory of remakes and reimaginings really make any sense? Isn't it precisely contemporary audiences who don't require reintroducing to hits of the past, thanks to the magic of recording technology? And if they were unfamiliar with the originals, wouldn't that make the brand-identity factor negligible?
 


         






    The new "Pink Panther" kicks in with an animated sequence featuring a squat cartoon Clouseau and the slinky panther playing cat and mouse to the strains of Henry Mancini's sublime burlesque theme, and it never strays too far from its origins. Director Shawn Levy, takes — perhaps unadvisedly, considering — full possessory credit for this gift-store reproduction of a Blake Edwards movie but basically sticks to the formula.
 
  The story begins when Yves Gluant, France's most famous soccer coach (and boyfriend of the beautiful pop star Xania, played by Beyoncé Knowles) is murdered in plain sight in front of a huge crowd after leading his team to victory against China. By the time anybody notices that Gluant is dead — killed by a poison dart to the neck — the priceless Pink Panther diamond has mysteriously disappeared from his finger.
 
  Enter Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline), who has been nominated for the Medal of Honor for the seventh time. Apprehensive about making any mistakes in such a public case, he assigns it to Clouseau. His plan is to make some headway on the case, then take over when Clouseau inevitably bungles it. Kline's Dreyfus is both more collected and cold-blooded a chief inspector than Herbert Lom's, who was a much more irascible type prone to injuries and breakdowns.
 
  Of course, it was the injuries and breakdowns that lent Edwards' "Pink Panther" movies their latent pathos, which was always visible underneath the inflatable hump jokes. Clouseau and Dreyfus were both exceedingly vulnerable — Clouseau because of his hubris and insecurity and Dreyfus chiefly because of Clouseau. In the new version, that bit of psychological tension has been wiped off the counter and spritzed with sanitizer. Clouseau, dumb-ish, good; Dreyfus, snooty, bad.
 
  Instead of Cato, who might have sparked a letter-writing campaign (one never knows), Clouseau has for a sidekick Ponton (Jean Reno), a detective second-class whom Dreyfus assigns to keep an eye on him.
 
  The film mostly steers clear of postmodern gestures save for a disconcerting scene in which Clouseau encounters a James Bond type in a casino. The scene spoofs "Casino Royale," in which Sellers spoofed Bond. This time, he's played by Clive Owen, who not only lets Clouseau take the credit for his impromptu crime-solving but also introduces Clouseau to his signature drink, the idiotic flaming mojito
.
 
  Martin's Clouseau is as clumsy and hapless as his predecessor and probably more innocent. It's this innocence that lends the love story between him and his secretary, Nicole (an adorably goofball Emily Mortimer), a sweetness that Sellers could not have resisted making just a little dirty. The best thing about the replica is how wholeheartedly Martin throws himself into the physical comedy, which is uniformly hilarious. I won't spoil them by describing them, except to say this: soccer ball, soundproof room, accent coaching, hamburger and background dancing.
 
  But as Martin himself has pointed out, his Clouseau is not bungling so much as he is "living on another plane." This may dovetail more snugly with Martin's old wild-and-crazy persona, but it also suggests an unwillingness to portray Clouseau's more unattractive characteristics. The new Clouseau emerges triumphant from the wreckage of his own incompetence, just like the old one.
 
  But the movie asks us to celebrate his brainless victory over the very bad Dreyfus. And you feel none of the empathy you did for him in Edwards' movies, which repeatedly confirmed that the world really is the kind of place where stupidity is lavishly rewarded.
 
  The beauty of the old Clouseau — apart from his tendency to get his hand caught in spinning globes and the way he pronounced "bump," was that he really wasn't a very likable person. He was snippy and mean to butlers, not just oblivious but willfully blind to his mistakes. So there's some cosmic irony in that Clouseau, incorporated into the first "sequel," "A Shot in the Dark," which was based on a play by Marcel Achard called "L'Idiote," was more of a jerk than an idiot. And that Martin's character in "The Jerk," whom his Clouseau resembles a little, was more of an idiot than a jerk.
 
  So the jerk who was actually an idiot is now playing the idiot who was kind of a jerk. Or something like that. I'm terrible with reintroductions.
 
 "The Pink Panther"
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for occasional crude and suggestive humor and language.   

Steve Martin scholars in search of a thesis topic are encouraged to analyze the inspiration the complicated comedian draws from the mysteries of his own pants. Consider: Martin's great, silent stage act, ''The Great Flydini,'' consists of pulling an abundance of objects from his open zipper. And now in The Pink Panther , playing the role of bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, first made famous by Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards' 1964 caper of the same name, Martin once again brings his trousers to the party. Ensconced in a posh hotel suite with Beyoncé Knowles playing an international pop diva, his Clouseau fumbles with a drink called a Flaming Mojito and, long story short, eventually emerges from the nearly wrecked hotel with his crotch smoking. The sight of the handsome, white-haired Martin (black moustache smartly trimmed and eyebrows set on Go!) maintaining his dignity in the face of self-propelled chaos is the artist's signature philosophical stance. It's a classic.
Everything charming about this pale Pink Panther   as well as everything else much less so  is on display in that scene. Martin's gift for physical and vocal comedy is as deft as ever  he chews over the pronunciation of hamburger the way Sellers masticated his monkey. But the plot, involving a murder, a missing diamond, and a vain police chief (Kevin Kline), makes a short story long. And in fishing for appeal to a younger audience (with a pretty but tonally wrong Beyoncé and the jokes about Viagra, calling plans, and Flaming Mo's), director Shawn Levy and his team squander Martin's old-timey hipster appeal  everything that makes his act fly.


Finally unleashed after multiple delays, "The Pink Panther" is neither the disaster one might have suspected nor a fully realized madcap farce; rather, Steve Martin's foray as Inspector Clouseau exhibits bursts of wild-and-craziness, but hardly enough to sustain even its relatively brief running time. The result is a feature-length "Saturday Night Live" sketch, with arid stretches interrupted by moments of irresistible silliness. The real question is whom this juvenile revival will attract, given that the franchise would seem to possess little resonance among modern youths -- its most likely audience -- beyond Henry Mancini's marvelously playful original score.
Using the title of the 1964 original but little else, Martin (who shares script credit) starts out as Officer Clouseau, whose ineptitude catches the eye of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline, recycling his "French Kiss" accent). With France's soccer coach murdered and his famous Pink Panther diamond stolen, Dreyfus sees an opportunity to achieve fame and renown -- especially if he solves the cases after the newly promoted Clouseau bumbles it.
So after a moribund introductory sequence, Clouseau is let loose on Paris, where he engages in a series of pratfalls, misunderstandings and puns, pursuing suspects that include the victim's girlfriend Xania (Beyonce Knowles), an international pop star. He's also saddled with a stoic sidekick, Ponton (Jean Reno), whose job is to report back to Dreyfus.
Having recently ventilated his serious side in "Shopgirl," Martin has considerable fun with Clouseau's mangled English (perhaps the funniest scene has him struggling to pronounce "hamburger") and subtly pays tribute to Peter Sellers. Part of that homage entails turning earlier "Panther" moments on their head -- a gag featuring a runaway globe, for example, or his decision to periodically attack Ponton the way Cato once assaulted Sellers' Clouseau.
Reunited with "Cheaper by the Dozen" director Shawn Levy, Martin's Clouseau also overwhelms those around him in much the way Sellers did, including Emily Mortimer as a coworker with whom he keeps becoming physically entangled, as well as Kristin Chenoweth and Roger Rees, whose talents are mostly wasted. Ditto for Knowles, who isn't stretching by playing a pop diva and, as in her "Austin Powers" assignment, is again relegated to the status of gorgeous prop.
"Stop browbeating her!" he chides Ponton for interrogating Xania. "Can't you see she's sexy?"
Shot in Paris and New York with side trips to Italy and Prague, at its best this new "Pink Panther" is a hit and largely miss exercise -- a glass about three-quarters empty or one-quarter full, depending on one's eagerness to succumb. Granted, there are some genuine chuckles amid the slapstick, wordplay and flatulence (yes, flatulence), but ultimately the pic can't deliver a consistent level of lunacy. (It's only fair to say that the later Sellers films were equally deficient and, as HBO's recent biopic made clear, the star was completely miserable doing them.)
Notably, in a sign of MGM synergy there's an uncredited cameo by a dashing Agent 006, which at first seems quite clever. Even that, though, doesn't really go anywhere, providing additional evidence that reloading 40-year-old franchises isn't always as simple as just slipping a new star into the old wardrobe.

A collapsed studio, poor buzz, and release date hopscotch all fed expectations that the new Pink Panther  would be a cataclysm worthy of Inspector Clouseau  himself. But really, how bad could it be? This franchise had already plumbed the depths of ineptitude in world-historic fashionnotoriously in Trail of the Pink Panther , which constructed a lead performance entirely from outtakes two years after its star's death. The most that can be said for this strenuously bland reconstitution is that Steve Martin  was clearly alive during filming. But just how alive, unfortunately, is at issue.
Easily the funniest actor to attempt Clouseau's shtick apart from Peter Sellers  (Alan Arkin , Roberto Benigni , and even a pseudonymous Roger Moore  have taken stabs), Martin nevertheless lacks the physical, uh, grace that the role requires. With his uncanny ability to bump into furniture as if by accident, Sellers was impossibly organic as Clouseauand particularly in A Shot in the Dark  (1964), Blake Edwards  would accentuate Clouseau's antics with widescreen long takes, allowing each scene's slow-burning chaos to spin out of control while Sellers unselfconsciously pretended not to notice.
Martin sticks mostly to middle shot and dons an overcooked Pepé Le Pew accent, a strategy that flounders whenever Clouseau isn't agonizing over the pronunciation of "hamburger." A lone camouflage gag notwithstanding, director Shawn Levy  exerts minimal visual imagination; indeed, fans will be horrified to learn that of all 10 Panther installments, this is the first that hasn't been shot in 'Scope. It goes without saying that the mystery was an afterthought: When France's head soccer coach (Jason Statham ) takes a poison dart to the neckand his diamond, the storied pink panther, is stolenClouseau is assigned to crack the case, assisted by a cutely bespectacled secretary (Emily Mortimer ) and karate-proficient sidekick (Jean Reno ), and sporadically hampered by the jealous Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline , too straitlaced for Herbert Lom 's character).
As in all the late Panther movies, the jokes that truly bomba Clive Owen  cameo as "agent 006"; an airport luggage/weaponry swap, for post9-11 chucklesare almost welcome for perking things up. The lack of energy suggests the film might as well have been constructed from outtakes; Beyoncé  is relegated to a bystander role, and the denouementsay zat  in a Clouseau accent! arrives abruptly, but not soon enough. Why update the material with Viagra  humor when the only actor to truly assimilate Clouseau has been in career obsolescence for a decade? That actor, of course, is Leslie Nielsen .
