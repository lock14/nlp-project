''In order to be irreplaceable,'' said the legendary French couturier Gabrielle ''Coco'' Chanel, ''one must always be different.'' The very feminine, very inward-looking French biopic Coco Before Chanel  examines the influences that made Chanel so different  and so irreplaceable  the way an observant fashion student might deconstruct an haute couture garment to understand how it's built. The woman who became Chanel grew up a poor, skinny orphan in a convent school, where she learned sewing as a trade. She idled in her early years as a cabaret singer, lived with one protective rich man while falling in love with another, and hewed to a life of unmarried   independence that hid a tough, sad heart.
Coco Before Chanel  is dreamiest when   director Anne Fontaine  working through muse Audrey Tautou  views the world through young Coco's eyes, literally. We see the girl look at nuns' habits and, later, admire her lovers' masculine wardrobe; the next thing you know, she's cutting up men's shirts and freeing generations of women from the tyranny of corsets and flounce. Tautou is a fascinating, unsmiling, petite presence with a severe brow and an androgynous appeal, so much so that I wish Alessandro Nivola (Junebug)  were a more robust beau as Arthur ''Boy'' Capel, the love of Chanel's life. Still, Tautou looks great in the boy clothes  the foundation of Coco Chanel's womanly empire.


 True to its title, “Coco Before Chanel” chronicles the early life of the woman who would become perhaps the single most influential figure in 20th-century fashion. But the film, directed and co-written by Anne Fontaine, bears less resemblance to a standard-issue biopic (like, say, “La Vie en Rose,” to take a recent French example) than to a novel by Émile Zola or Theodore Dreiser. With a mixture of brutal candor and tender sympathy, it charts the rise of an ambitious, difficult woman, taking note of the obstacles and opportunities offered by her time, place and circumstances.  The tale begins in an orphanage, where the Chanel sisters, Gabrielle and Adrienne, have been deposited by their father. An inkling of Gabrielle’s eventual vocation is provided when the audience is directed to notice her noticing the stitching on the nuns’ wimples, but for the most part Ms. Fontaine avoids the easy prefiguring that deadens so many film biographies.  She also steers clear of the kind of literal-minded psychologizing that finds the germ of future greatness in childhood trauma. Gabrielle and Adrienne, grown into Audrey Tautou and Marie Gillain, wind up in a provincial music hall, singing mildly naughty songs — one, about a lost dog named Coco, provides the nickname with which Gabrielle becomes famous — and trying not to be mistaken for the prostitutes who also frequent the place. Gabrielle, chain-smoking and sarcastic, confronts the world, and the men in it, with a wariness that borders on hostility.  She is, from the start, a complicated, frequently uncharming character, and Ms. Tautou’s fierce and sinewy performance represents a decisive break with the dimpled-pixie typecasting she has been struggling against since “Amélie.” One fact of Gabrielle’s life is that a woman without money or status  can only acquire them by attaching herself to a man, ideally as a wife but more plausibly as a mistress. And so Adrienne finds a baron to keep her, while Gabrielle, after some combative flirting, hooks up with a playboy in uniform, a worldly and cynical fellow named Étienne Balsan (Benoît Poelvoorde).  The relationship between them is affectionate, exploitive, transactional and unpredictable, and it is the most interesting aspect of “Coco Before Chanel.” With a mixture of impulsiveness and blunt premeditation Coco shows up at Étienne’s country mansion, where she installs herself as his mistress. His treatment of her is alternately gallant and appalling. For a long time he sequesters her in a back room and instructs her to eat in the kitchen, where she won’t be seen by his high society friends.  But Coco crashes their parties, befriending a flamboyant actress named Emilienne (Emmanuelle Devos) and catching the eye of an English businessman known as Boy Capel (Alessandro Nivola). His soulful sensitivity makes him appear to be everything Étienne is not, and he offers Coco and the film a vision of true love.  Ms. Fontaine indulges this romanticism but also points out the loose strings and sticking points. Boy, Coco’s ideal lover, is also something of an adventurer, a serial seducer whose only advantage over Étienne may be that he has better looks and better game. As far as acting is concerned, Mr. Poelvoorde wins. He plays each facet of Étienne’s repellent, gracious, selfish and sad personality with dazzling relish.  In any case, such judgments are not really on the movie’s agenda. Rather than take a moralizing or pitying view of its characters, who live according to the social mores of their era and the logic of their desires, Ms. Fontaine examines them with curiosity and compassion.  The result is an unusually vivid and convincing account of the historical past, composed in the present tense. Though its mood and methods are different, “Coco Before Chanel” shares with Jane Campion’s “Bright Star” — another new anti-biopic — a fascination, at once intense and dispassionate, with the lives of women in earlier centuries. Coco and Fanny Brawne, the heroine of Ms. Campion’s film, are not victims of oppression or paragons of resistance but rather individuals, made not of ideology or wishful thinking but of flesh and blood.  And clothes of course. Both Fanny and Coco start out as seamstresses with an eye for novelty and a keen aesthetic sense. Coco disdains corsets, sometimes dresses in men’s garments, and adapts simple hats and fisherman’s shirts to marvelously chic effect. The blossoming of her ambition, as much as her love life, drives the story forward, and turns “Coco Before Chanel” into a costume drama worthy of the name.  “Coco Before Chanel” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and a lot of cigarettes. No nudity, though, which would be a distraction from all those lovely clothes.

More sentimental than chic, Gallic biopic "Coco Before Chanel" nonetheless knits a convincing portrait of the designer's journey from her humble beginnings as a provincial seamstress to the halls of Parisian haute couture. Focusing on the era in which Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel (winningly played by Audrey Tautou) served as mistress of an eccentric millionaire, the film reveals, via meticulous period imagery, how the couturier forged a style that would change the way women dressed in the 20th century. Warner Bros.' April 22 Gaul release should scoot gracefully down the theatrical runway before wafting overseas like a splash of No. 5.
The first of two Chanel biopics skedded to hit screens this year, this one, co-written by helmer Anne Fontaine and her sister Camille, limits its scope to the time in the designer's late 20s when she began showcasing her distinct creative voice. The opening, purely visual flashback shows the young Chanel arriving at an ominous Catholic orphanage after her mother has died and her father has left to support the family.
The stark setting and drab religious garb -- superbly rendered by production designer Olivier Radot and costume designer Catherine Leterrier -- will have an enduring impact on her future designs, whose cornerstones will be simplicity and sophistication.
The action then jumps to a decade or so later, as busy bee Chanel (Tautou) is working days as a seamstress and nights as a cabaret entertainer ("to pay for her dresses"), alongside her sis, Adrienne (Marie Gillain). During a fun and flashy dance number, she crosses paths with debauched heir Etienne Balsan (Benoit Poelvoorde); before long, she's moved to his country estate, where she serves as his friend, mistress and inhouse style consultant.
Caught in a lavish world where women overdress themselves in bails of lace, suffocating corsets and hats oozing with flowers, Chanel begins to experiment with her lover's clothing, designing outfits that are both easier to wear and easier on the eye. These sequences are among the film's strongest, revealing the contrast between the heavy 19th-century styles worn by the epoch's wealthier class and Chanel's vision of a sleek, intelligent wardrobe to help place women on an equal footing with men.
Pic's third section brings a melodramatic twist to Chanel's sudden and impossible affair with a British industrialist (Alessandro Nivola). The drawing-room drama and ensuing love triangle feel a tad forced, but they do explain how Chanel is pushed to liberate herself from kept-woman status through her relentless work ethic and gifted eye.
For a film that is, after all, about fashion, helmer Fontaine ("How I Killed My Father" and the glossy "The Girl From Monaco") and d.p. Christophe Beaucarne ("Irina Palm") make things extremely pleasurable to look at. Between lingering wide shots and gliding p.o.v. camerawork, the crisp visuals show Chanel forever analyzing the stylistic tendencies of her surroundings.
Tautou's perf is one of her finest to date, revealing her character's headstrong personality through smart delivery and a permanent but attractive pout. As with his portrayal of a serial killer in "Man Bites Dog," Belgian thesp Poelvoorde manages to make the fairly despicable Etienne seem quite likable by the end of the movie.

Anne Fontaine 's Coco Before Chanel  gives us Belle Époque Coco, opening in 1893 with a grim scene of the 10-year-old waif and her sister being unceremoniously dumped at an orphanage, and ending around World War I, a few years before the Chanel empire is launched. Jan Kounen 's moldy Coco Chanel  & Igor Stravinsky  , which premiered earlier this year at Cannes  and was also bought by Sony Pictures Classics , picks up essentially where Fontaine's film ends. Both stop well short of the most shameful era of the designer's life: Coco When She Was Sleeping With the Nazi Spy. The Coco of Fontaine's project—which she co-wrote with her sister, Camille, freely adapting Edmonde Charles-Roux 's book L'Irrégulière: ou, Mon itinéraire Chanel —can be described as courtesan before couturiere. Or, more cynically, Coco after corporate synergy: Audrey Tautou , who performs adequately in the title role, recently replaced Nicole Kidman  as the spokesmodel for Chanel No. 5 . (The lush TV spot is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet , who gave Tautou her most syrupy role in Amélie .)
The life of fashion's monster sacré  has been assayed many times before: Katharine Hepburn  in the 1969 Broadway musical Coco , Marie-France Pisier  in the 1981 biopic Chanel Solitaire , Shirley MacLaine  playing her as an old broad last year on Lifetime's Coco Chanel . Demi Moore  is said to be attached to yet another Coco project. The fascination with Chanel is best explained by Judith Thurman 's typically spot-on assessment in a 2005 New Yorker  piece: "Her own rules of the game, distilled over the decades, were a core of beliefs that were as much about womanhood and its paradoxes as about clothing." Fontaine's film attempts to dramatize the most fundamental contradiction—the proud peasant who would liberate women from suffocating corsets, pounds of extra material, and hats that looked liked "meringues" was able to do so by lying in the beds of rich men.
Millionaire racehorse owner Étienne Balsan  (Benoît Poelvoorde ) first meets Coco in 1908 Moulins, where she works as a seamstress and a singer in a saloon with her sister, Adrienne (Marie Gillain ). The enterprising young woman shows up at Balsan's house unannounced, soon to be his pet, hidden when the swells come over. Despite wan protests of "All I need is a job," Coco seems content with the arrangement, which gives her the time to make hats for Balsan's former conquest, the actress Emilienne (Emmanuelle Devos , excellent as always, and the only cast member capable of having any fun with her role). More money—and encouragement—will come from Arthur "Boy" Capel (Alessandro Nivola ), an English industrialist and polo player, who asks his pal, Balsan, if he can "borrow" Coco for two days for a trip to Deauville , where the fishermen's striped sweaters will inspire more androgynous fashion from Coco. Capel's death sparks an interest in how to do things with black.
Coco Before Chanel  concludes with an anachronistic coda: An older Coco, in a signature high-contrast black-and-white suit, sits on the famous steps of her couture house as contemporary models march past her, wearing Chanel's Greatest Hits Through the Decades (recalling a similar scene in Matt Tyrnauer 's doc Valentino: The Last Emperor ). The valedictory moment feels completely unearned in a film so strenuously devoted to the years before its subject's fame—and to avoiding any mention of her unconscionable compromising during World War II (even in the press notes). "Coco Chanel never married," reads the first of the closing intertitles, which the film seems to honor as the designer's most significant accomplishment. Aiming to be a tale of self-creation, Fontaine's film—swaddled in the sumptuous production designs of Olivier Radot  (who devised the glorious interiors for Patrice Chéreau 's 2005 movie, Gabrielle , also set right before World War I)—more often plays as a dull romance, Chanel's role as mistress somehow worthy of noble celebration. The hagiographic treatment of Coco as Legend extends even to Karl Lagerfeld , named creative director of Chanel in 1983, and the subject of Rodolphe Marconi 's documentary Lagerfeld Confidential  (2007). Rather than more Coco, before, during, or after Chanel, perhaps the designer's rival, Elsa Schiaparelli , who collaborated not with the Nazis but Giacometti and Cocteau, and whose life has yet to be told on-screen, would make for a more fascinating biopic.
