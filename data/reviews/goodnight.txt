Martin Freeman, from the BBC's The Office , has just the right semi-stunned mug to play a guy sliding into work-and-love loserdom who finds solace from his undermining girlfriend with a dream woman he encounters in his sleep. The Good Night  doesn't quite comfortably synthesize all the notions writer-director Jake Paltrow wants to play with in his feature debut. But the filmmaker's got good taste  and luck  in casting. Sister Gwyneth gets therapeutically hard-ass in the dark-haired role of the bad GF, while Penélope Cruz coos and smolders appropriately as the fantasy femme.

 “The Good Night” might be described as a Dudley Moore movie without its namesake, who died five years ago. You know the subgenre: a bumbling, tippling fantasist becomes besotted with a dream girl and forsakes reason to wallow in his fantasy. In this variation, the farce has been tamped down to whimsy.  Sometimes he is married, sometimes not. In “The Good Night,” written and directed by Jake Paltrow, the Moore surrogate, Gary Sheller (Martin Freeman), is a single guy in his mid-30s whose relationship with Dora (the director’s sister, Gwyneth Paltrow), his nagging live-in girlfriend of seven years, has turned to ashes. Gary is not the kind of buffoonish drunk that Moore excelled at playing, but he has the same collapsed self-image as a dilapidated specimen of manhood genuflecting before perfectly shaped goddesses.  Like many of Moore’s characters, Gary is also a British musician. Although Gary has a rock ’n’ roll background, he composes for television commercials, and lives in New York City. When his serious artistic side is finally heard late in the movie, the original piano piece he plays is the kind of characterless schlock that movies often try to pass off as modern classical music.  Perhaps to make Gary seem sympathetic, “The Good Night” gives him an obnoxious sidekick in his producer, best friend and former band mate, Paul (Simon Pegg), a slick, self-infatuated misogynist who patronizes lap-dance clubs and mistreats his girlfriend, Terry (Amber Sealey). Compared with this rat, Gary is an angelic sad sack for whom you almost begin to feel sorry.  The kind of humor in which “The Good Night” traffics is the sort that produces smirks of uncomfortable recognition, but hardly any laughter. The object of Gary’s affection is a beautiful woman (Penélope Cruz) who communicates with him telepathically in his dreams. When he first glimpses this phantom lover, who calls herself Anna, she is a shining figure in white strolling on a deserted beach. Their eyes meet, and their instant rapport is so complete that her amorous thoughts register as subtitled words. Anna becomes such a powerful fantasy that Gary would rather sleep than continue living his ordinary domestic life with Dora, who works in an art gallery.  Dora is a role guaranteed not to advance Ms. Paltrow’s screen career. The actress has bravely forsaken all her glamour to play the kind of drab, sullen partner whose whining voice you dread hearing first thing in the morning. Nevertheless, each night before turning off the lights, these miserable people exchange tired, dutiful “Love you” ’s.  Gary becomes so obsessed with having uninterrupted sleep during which to cuddle with the sexually insatiable Anna that he soundproofs the bedroom. He also begins to consult dream experts and settles on Mel (Danny DeVito), an eccentric motormouth nut case who spouts torrents of wacky dream theory in his “lucid dreaming” therapy group. Mr. DeVito’s Mel  is, in a word, unbearable.  What ought to be the story’s kicker arrives when Gary sees Anna’s image on perfume ads plastered on New York buses. Through Paul, he meets this creature, whose real name is Melody. A chain-smoking, tequila-swilling hedonist who is all hard edges, Melody immediately sizes up Gary as a jealous, crazy loser on their abortive date and wisely beats a retreat. Ms. Cruz, as ever, loses much mystique the moment she speaks English.  The comedy of male midlife angst dates back at least to “The Seven-Year Itch,” when it was sweet and innocent. Each time it is recycled, it gets more sour and joyless.    “The Good Night” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

Sweet dreams, indeed. As becalmed and refreshing as a good night's sleep, writer-director Jake Paltrow's first feature delves assuredly into the mind of a lost soul who literally encounters the woman of his dreams. Though its forays into the subconscious may strike more adventurous cinematic palettes as precious and unimaginative, few will be able to resist Martin Freeman's appealing lead turn or the wry Brit wit that gives this fanciful confection a robust comic core. Given the right push emphasizing its marquee names, "The Good Night" could hit sleeper status.
Compared to David Lynch's convulsive dreamscapes and Michel Gondry's "The Science of Sleep" - all films that seek to strand the viewer in an impenetrable chain of dream logic -- "The Good Night's" fascination with hallucination and reverie doesn't go much deeper than the surface level. Fortunately, it's an enchanting surface that doesn't wear out its welcome for a good 93 minutes.
Puzzling mock-doc prologue introduces a trio of characters discussing the life of sad-sack musician Gary Sheller in tones of hushed regret. Of the three, only Paul ("Shaun of the Dead's" Simon Pegg) plays a part in the story that follows, set two years earlier.
Gary (Freeman) is a thirtysomething Londoner now living in New York, a nice but hapless bloke with all the detritus of a movie midlife crisis. Since his band broke up seven years ago, he has eked out a living scoring TV commercials, to the increasing chagrin of his mildly depressive live-in girlfriend Dora (the helmer's sister, Gwyneth Paltrow). Even worse, Gary's friend and former bandmate, Paul, is doing quite well for himself in an advertising career.
Given Dora's irritable demeanor and Gary's tendency to aggravate it by saying exactly the wrong thing, it's no surprise that their love life is mutually unsatisfying. So when Gary starts having recurring dreams about a beguiling mystery woman (Penelope Cruz) who seems to offer more of herself to him every night, they have a rejuvenating effect. Wanting more, he takes an active interest in lucid dreaming - the act of becoming aware of and even controlling one's dream state - getting all sorts of tips from a New Age-y, self-styled expert (an amusing Danny DeVito).
Gary's growing obsession with manipulating his nocturnal entertainment - he sound-proofs his bedroom and gets cranky whenever he's awakened mid-dream - doesn't improve his relationship with Dora; somehow, even Paul's foolhardy dalliances in cybersex manage to widen the rift. Eventually Dora announces they need time apart and jets off to Venice, leaving Gary to indulge his fantasies to the fullest.
But after a wide-awake Gary sees Anna's face plastered on the side of a bus, he soon learns she's a real-life model (whose actual name, Melodia, strikes a rather obvious note), and Paul all too conveniently books her for a commercial. The foundation for Gary's discovery and face-to-face meeting with his fantasy lover isn't particularly well-laid, but by this point, the script has set a fascinating structural dilemma for itself, and Gary and Melodia's waking interactions easily compel one's interest and anticipation.
Subsequent plot turns are anything but predictable, and the tale begins to take on a quiet gravity as Gary's fantasy life is increasingly infected by his reality. The moving denouement is both a testament to the power and necessity of dreams and a bittersweet acknowledgment of their limitations.
With so many first-time helmers lately piling on the flash and visual gimmickry, the measured pacing and almost crystalline purity of Jake Paltrow's direction can't help but come as a soothing relief. The filmmaking is arguably too tasteful at times; intriguing as they are, Gary's dream sequences are absent any real sense of mystery or danger, and the use of stately fade-ins and fade-outs as delineating markers leads to some rhythmic awkwardness. In "The Science of Sleep," dreams and reality blurred together inscrutably; here, they exist opaquely side-by-side.
Best known Stateside for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and the BBC's "The Office," Freeman carries the movie in his sleep, so to speak, showing terrific leading-man chops in a delightfully shaggy, self-effacing role. Continuing her dowdy-brunette look from "Running With Scissors," Gwyneth Paltrow comes through with a prickly, witty characterization that, despite a maudlin streak, occasionally lets the sun peek through.
Supporting perfs are similarly well handled. Looking as ravishing as she did in "Volver" (with no small help from Verity Hawkes' splendid costumes, including one striking white tux), Cruz breaks her so-called English-language curse with a role that requires her to be seductive and not much else. Needless to say, she acquits herself admirably. And Pegg, with his crack comic timing, pockets every other scene as Gary's lovable bastard of a best friend.
Production design is aces, the predominantly gray scheme of Gary and Dora's dreary apartment providing a "Wizard of Oz"-like contrast with the vivid colors and textures of the film's dreamscape; Giles Nuttgen's cinematography astutely follows in kind. Alec Puro's unobtrusively melodic score, which incorporating a tender composition Gary writes late in the picture, plays an especially significant role.
Gotham-set pic was largely filmed in London -- a disjunction that, given the film's Anglophilic bent, almost makes sense.

Director Jake Paltrow 's feature debut has all the hallmarks of an earnest young man's feature debut, and while that is not necessarily a bad thing, I can only imagine that it fit Sundance like a fingerless glove when it had its premiere there earlier this year. Paltrow, a veteran TV and film scriptwriter, has chosen the quirky relationship drama as his milieu, and cast older sister Gwyneth as deathly drab Dora, the female half of the film's rapidly staling couple. Martin Freeman , working the last five minutes out of that butter-knife pixie cut and its attendant charms, plays Gary, a failed musician and emotionally absent boyfriend slumming in the jingle racket to make ends meet. When a kohl-eyed, white-tuxedoed beauty played by Penélope Cruz  begins visiting Gary in his dreams, bearing soothing tidings of well-being and the occasional morning hard-on, Gary retreats from the truly awful Dora into his good night. It's unclear why either half of this interminable couple ever liked the other, and though Paltrow works up a vivid, sensual zetz  for the dream sequences, the murky palette of Gary's waking life gets oppressive in its intentional contrast. Simon Pegg  is abidingly repellent as the best friend and ugly face of male narcissism, playing fast and loose with his own life while Gary tiptoes through dreams, but even the nice twist of a fantasy made unexpectedly, then expectation-crushingly real can't uncork the hermetically sealedif largely inoffensivefate of this boy-meets-compromise tale.
