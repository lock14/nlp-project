If the economy really is headed down the toilet, now is probably the right moment for "Mad Money," a comedy that lets Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Katie Holmes steal a fortune from the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. This is the feistiest Hollywood movie about American women and their thankless jobs since "9 to 5." "Mad Money" isn't an overtly feminist revenge fantasy like "9 to 5," even though the director, Callie Khouri, wrote "Thelma & Louise" and made "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." The fantasy here is tremendous wealth - and that knows no gender.
Keaton plays Bridget Cardigan (that name!), an upper-class ball of energy whose corporate-titan husband, Don (Ted Danson), hasn't worked in over a year. They're in deep debt. He can't find a job, so she takes one as a janitor at the bank (the tip comes from her housekeeper). There are few kookier sights than Diane Keaton in a drab jumpsuit pushing a maintenance cart. On Bridget's first day, she's given a tour of the facility and is shocked to see the shredding room where bins and bins of out-of-circulation bills are pulverized.
Being around all that money does a number on her. She blithely whips up a blueprint of the bank and proceeds to recruit accomplices on the payroll. She gets Nina from shredding (Latifah) first by stalking her, then by pulling on her heartstrings. Nina is a single mother of two in the projects but wants to send her boys to a private school. Both women go after Jackie (Holmes), a sweet-natured dipstick who runs the bins down to the shredding room and lives in a trailer (Bridget and Nina think she's a junkie). The scheme they hatch seems so simple it's unbelievable that no one else has tried it. Over the course of three years, they skim a little of the discarded cash every now and then until it piles up. This plan just requires a lot of nerve. And it's fun watching these three keep theirs.
Khouri actually tries to give the movie's maiden theft - a sub-"Ocean's" scheme if ever there were one - some Steven Soderbergh verve. Everywhere else her touch is light and cutesy. Even so, the dialogue in Glen Gers's script is sharp and sometimes witty, even in the tiny moments, as with Nina and her sons. The movie tries its hand at direct social commentary, but it's not up for that. Like the "Ocean's" movies, the object here is to see if this sustained robbery can come off.
A case is made for why the women would want the money, but there are no real politics behind their taking it. Who'll miss it? Choosing America's centermost Federal Reserve Bank is a neat heartland touch. And things get interesting when Nina considers sleeping with the security guard (Roger R. Cross) harboring a crush on her in order to keep him quiet. But both characters are too fundamentally conscientious to go there. The women, the men in their lives - Adam Rothenberg plays Holmes's slaughterhouse-worker husband - and the movie's races and classes unite in the name of pulling a lucrative fast one. It's unclear where the justice is, but the movie generates enough suspense with the caper and enough compassion for the bandits that we submit to the outlandishness.
Keaton is in rare form. Her usual ranting freak-outs are put to logical ends, as when a hitch arises late in the scheme and the starchy security manager, played by a wonderfully uptight Stephen Root, corners her, and she starts with the hands and the shrieking. As an endearment, her expensive-looking haircut seems undone in some scenes, and in others she doesn't appear to be wearing much makeup. She starts to look the part. She starts to look human.
Latifah is reliably good. She's at her best when forced to be defensive, and the movie keeps her back against the wall. Holmes is likable and shockingly funny. She has a face for comedy. The hilarious snake dances she does while scooping bills off a cart suggest she has a body for it, too. In fact, this character seems like such a mess Holmes should be the only choice to play Britney Spears in "Oops! I Did It Again" or whatever they'll call the tragic farce about Spears's life.
These three are good. So are Danson, Cross, and Rothenberg. And yet, this movie scared me. What is it saying about us? This is basically a bunch of rich people celebrating pathological greed. There's nothing satirical about the film. It's heartfelt - a cautionary comedy whose tonal B-side is a terrifying, if unwitting case study about an addictive lust not for spending or wealth but for cash itself. To that end, the used money in this movie is old and worn-out and sad. There's also so much of it that it starts to make you sick, like too much sugar or too much anything.
One of the posters for "Mad Money" shows Keaton, Latifah, and Holmes ecstatic in a downpour of bills. They look like they just won both showcases on "The Price Is Right." There's a similar, even more pornographic shot in the movie itself. It's galling, mostly since by the time it comes, caution has clearly been thrown to the winds. And a survey of the women's glee suggests a disturbingly euphoric climax. They're having a cash-gasm.


How's this for a money shot? Bridget (Diane Keaton), who has just gone to work as a cleaning woman at the Kansas City Federal Reserve, looks up at a security monitor and sees vast piles of currency. Here's the sexy part: They're being fed through a paper shredder  one of the bank's daily rituals, as grungy old bills are taken out of circulation. Now, that's  temptation. If Bridget, toiling as a custodian after her financial-analyst husband (Ted Danson) was downsized, can figure out a way to lift that cash, she'll be stealing money that no longer exists. Talk about an untraceable  and victimless  crime!
Mad Money , a sisters-in-greed heist comedy that's like Fun With Dick and Jane  crossed with Set It Off , may be a formula flick, but as directed by Callie Khouri (the writer of Thelma & Louise ), it gives you a good, infectious dose of its heroines' money fever. Bridget finds two accomplices: Nina (Queen Latifah), a cynical, seen-it-all inner-city mom, and Jackie (Katie Holmes), a hip-wiggling flake plugged into her headphones. Their plan to lift the shreddable loot is ingenious in its relative simplicity, making Mad Money  a crime caper that agreeably transcends disbelief. The actresses need all their charm, though, since the characters they're playing are just about as thin as those paper bills. Latifah coasts on grit and verve, and Holmes has a goggle-eyed sweetness, but it's Keaton who rules. She makes Bridget a sneaky bourgeois avenger, willing to fake a showboat crazy fit, using her crinkly warmth to say to the audience: Admit it  you'd take that money too.

 In the breezy, amoral heist comedy “Mad Money,” “Fun With Dick and Jane” meets “9 to 5” on the way to recession. If this uncomfortably timely movie lacks the political bite of the first and the cozy star chemistry of the second, it sputters to fitful life in the crooked grin of Diane Keaton, whose character, Bridget Cardigan, an upper-middle-class homemaker in suburban Kansas City, Mo., develops an insatiable lust for larceny.  As in “Fun With Dick and Jane,” financial crisis inspires serious theft. No sooner has  Don (Ted Danson), Bridget’s husband,  sprung the alarming news that he has been downsized from his cushy corporate job and is $286,000 in debt, than she springs into action.  Is there a place in the workforce for an upper-middle-class woman of a certain age with a degree in comparative literature and no job experience? Yes, if she accepts humiliating work as a janitor in the local Federal Reserve Bank. Surrounded by money in a high-security environment of surveillance cameras, checkpoints and employees subject to random searches, Bridget, while pushing a mop, becomes obsessed with getting her hands on some of the dough.  The lucre she craves is literally filthy. Every day carts of old bills are transported under lock and key to shredding machines. Since the money is going out of circulation, diverting some wouldn’t really be theft, would it? That’s how Bridget rationalizes her scheme, in which she enlists two handpicked co-conspirators to change the locks on the carts so they can grab some moola during its transit to the shredders. She airily calls it recycling.  Bridget initially decides to steal just enough to allow her family  to get out of debt and not have to sell its fancy house. But just enough soon becomes more than enough, as she  amasses a basement’s worth of dirty money.  Bridget and her partners —  Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah), a  single mother raising two children, and Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes), a flibbertigibbet who lives in a trailer with her husband, Bob (Adam Rothenberg) — are a demographically oddball threesome calculated to appeal equally to the Woody Allen, Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Springer crowds.  Having grabbed some loot without being caught, the women go  wild and deliriously toss it into the air. As the movie invites you to share their delight, you may feel a tad unclean. Is wealth, ill-gotten or not, the answer to everything? Yes, yes, yes! proclaims the movie, directed by Callie Khouri from a screenplay adapted by Glenn Gers from the British television film “Hot Money.”  The attachment to the project of Ms. Khouri, whose screenwriting debut, “Thelma and Louise,” made her Hollywood’s go-to gal for stories of empowered sisterhood, lends it a feminist credential. And because two of the film’s  women become their family’s breadwinners, “Mad Money” is another fable of sisters doing it for themselves. Mr. Danson’s stay-at-home husband becomes a reluctant collaborator who agrees to run a sham consulting business from the house as a cover story for their affluence.  The movie’s weakest link is Ms. Holmes’s underwritten Jackie, a one-note character who dances  around the bank wearing headphones. While Bridget and Nina bond amiably (Nina is one of Ms. Latifah’s meatier recent screen roles, which isn’t saying much), Jackie registers as a ditsy afterthought. Nina is given a love interest in Barry (Roger Cross), a   soft-hearted security guard who, spotting the signs of money stuffed under her shirt, remarks, “Unless you have very hard, rectangular breasts, we need to talk.”  The film’s other feminist predecessor is “9 to 5,” another movie in which three smart women defy the system. But in “Mad Money,” Glover (Stephen Root),  the stubbornly doltish bank manager who thwarts investigators by insisting his security is unbreachable, isn’t half as pungent a villain as  the evil sexist boss in “9 to 5.”  This movie is awkwardly structured. Beginning with a scene of the thieves frantically disposing of their stolen cash by fire and flushed toilet as the feds close in, it jumps back three years, then periodically leaps ahead to show snippets of the women under police interrogation. The confusion is a sign that “Mad Money” doesn’t trust its audience to stay seated until the caper is underway.  “Mad Money” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Having taken the girl-power movie to new highs (writing "Thelma & Louise") and lows (writing and directing "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"), helmer Callie Khouri settles for a routine payday with "Mad Money." Banking on the appealing chemistry of Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah -- with co-star Katie Holmes awkwardly upsetting the balance -- this strained heist comedy about three cash-strapped femmes is watchable enough for a few reels, but lacks the requisite wit and amoral energy to capitalize on its get-rich-quick premise. January item could generate some distaff interest, but will earn most of its coin on homevid.
Prologue cuts among the larcenous leading ladies as they frantically try to dispose of their ill-gotten gains before the cops arrive. Addressing the camera with the not-so-insightful adage "We're all capable of anything," middle-aged Bridget (Keaton) takes the narrative back three years to the moment when she and her newly unemployed husband, Don (Ted Danson), found themselves on the brink of financial ruin.
More than $200,000 in debt and in danger of losing the house, Bridget is forced to look for a job. After a montage comically illustrating how ill-equipped a certain breed of upper-crust white woman is for the corporate world, Bridget settles for a lowly janitor's post -- at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. How convenient.
Actually, not so convenient, given the bank's intensely routinized and scrutinized security system (random searches, cameras everywhere, cash carts kept under lock and key). But desperate Bridget spies a loophole and eventually persuades two fellow workers -- wary single mom Nina (Latifah) and young, ditzy Jackie (Holmes) -- to help her pull off a robbery or two.
There's something ingenious, and even halfway defensible, about stealing old, worn-out money that's already been earmarked for shredding, and "Mad Money" derives most of its meager pleasures from its central heist sequence -- which, though lacking in Brian De Palma-esque visual bravado, is tightly edited and cleverly worked out.
But even as it aims for a loose, light-fingered touch, Khouri's direction is lukewarm at best. Regular flash-forwards to the inevitable police interrogations (a device employed with more finesse in Spike Lee's "Inside Man," among others) further undercut the suspense and audience involvement, and soon there's little to do but watch as the women's stealing spree spirals predictably out of control.
In the end, "Mad Money" lacks the guts to either embrace its characters' breezy amorality or critique it: While prudent Nina functions as the film's weak conscience, pic repeatedly shows the three women screaming with delight as they literally roll in the dough. It's the kind of image that should draw audiences into a spirit of gleeful collusion, but instead feels phony, even condescending (look, rich people playing poor people who become rich people!).
It's not long before their layabout husbands get in on the action, modestly upping the emotional ante: While Jackie's hubby (Adam Rothenberg) is no brighter than she is, Danson has some warmly amusing moments as Bridget's more rational better half. But a romantic thread pairing Nina with bank security guard Barry (Roger Cross) feels cheap, pointing up both the implausibility and the moral ambivalence of Glenn Gers' script (adapted from the British telepic "Hot Money").
Keaton is a witty comedienne under any circumstances; here, she manages to make Bridget's lack of scruples seem cheery and borderline cute, emphasizing her resourcefulness and devil-may-care high spirits in the worst of situations. She's smartly held in check by Latifah's sassy, sympathetic Nina, who, of the three protags, seems to benefit the most from the pic's otherwise drab lensing.
Faring markedly worse than her co-thesps, however, is Holmes, whose character's compulsive habit and sole defining trait -- listening to music and dancing on the job -- gives her little to work with.
Brent Thomas' production design ably conjures the cold, dreary environs of a high-security federal bank. Though set in Missouri, pic was shot entirely in Louisiana and looks none the worse for it.

In this remake of a 2001 BBC  television production titled Hot Money about women who clean the Bank of England  and smuggle out in their underpants thou- sands of pounds destined for destruction Diane Keaton  plays the pampered Bridget Cardigan , who lives with hubby Don (Ted Danson ) in a sprawling Midwestern manse. When we first meet the couple, Don's shredding dollar bills and flushing them down the crapper, while Bridget's skedaddling out the back door with a bag full of filthy lucre and the cops on her tail. Their story's told in flashback: Don, once a six-figure exec, has been downsized and is drowning in debt. Bridget gets a gig cleaning the toilets at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , where she meets the ditzy Jackie Truman  (Katie Holmes ) and the bored-outta-her-brains Nina Brewster  (Queen Latifah ). It's Nina's job to destroy worn-out currency, and Bridget figures, hell, might as well steal the bills before they're destroyed. So the women stuff the bounty in their panties and walk out the door, a few times too manywhich is no spoiler, as the narrative's often interrupted by scenes of the stars explaining to the feds precisely how the heist worked. And while it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money  worth a few bucks.
