         A leisurely Iberian travelogue, "Americano" stars Joshua Jackson as a recent college grad reevaluating his options toward the end of a European sojourn with his friends Ryan (Timm Sharp) and Michelle (Ruthanna Hopper). Chris McKinley (Jackson) and pals are in Pamplona for the running of the bulls with three days remaining before they return to the U.S. and the impending responsibilities of adulthood begin to sink in.
 
 After a thief makes off with his backpack, Chris' heart is stolen by a vivacious Spanish actress named Adela (Leonor Varela), who leads the trio through the San Fermin festival and allows them to stay at her house. A bullfight, drinking, dancing and some fly fishing engage the romantic notions implanted in Chris from reading Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises" and make his decision on whether to return home more difficult.
 


         






   Writer-director Kevin Noland effectively utilizes his fine young cast and the natural beauty and rich culture of northern Spain in amiably posing a timeless question of youth. Dennis Hopper has a supporting role as an expatriate club owner who asserts an enigmatic influence on Chris.
