This tremendously sincere but at times brutal drama about international sex trafficking faces two hurdles. First, Kreuzpaintner (Summer Storm
) must make real the horrors of kidnapping, enslavement, and rape without exploiting his characters or his subject. Meanwhile, screenwriter Jose Rivera (The Motorcycle Diaries
) shapes an intrigue thriller with a buddy element from Peter Landesman�s hotly contested slavery expos�, �The Girls Next Door,� published in 2004 in The New York Times Magazine
. Thirteen-year-old Adriana (Gaitan) gets grabbed off her new pink bicycle by thugs and enters �the tunnel,� a network of pimps, border coyotes, dirty cops, and Russian gangsters that leads to the very heart of America � tidy suburban homes where Internet pedophiles discreetly exchange thousands of dollars for boys and girls. With her is Veronica (Bachleda), a young single mother lured from Poland by the promise of a new life in Los Angeles; after surrendering her passport, she�s abducted and cruelly initiated into their captors� endless cycle of beatings, druggings, rape, and all-night driving in a delivery van. Along the way there are johns. Kreuzpaintner translates Landesman�s image of a spot in a riverbed where slaves and dozens of johns meet in hollowed-out spaces within a thicket of reeds for 10-minute sessions; the camera lingers outside the makeshift bowers on the sickening image of battery lanterns with kitchen timers stuck on top. Investigating Adriana�s disappearance are her teenage delinquent brother, Jorge (Ramos, who has a certain Jon Cryer quality, for better or worse), and Ray (Kline), a weary, middle-aged bureaucrat whose real investment in human trafficking lurks within his backstory. These unlikely partners bicker over the radio (Ray prefers classical) and whether Jorge wears his seat belt, and during their driving scenes, Jorge razzes Ray about his North American privilege. There�s something disappointingly conventional about their relationship, but Kline helps to sell it with deadpan warmth. In an instance of Rivera�s pointed humor, third-year Spanish students from El Paso Uni High arrive to �help� the captives, by then detained in a barbed-wire camp by the oblivious Border Patrol, and can offer only a copy of Glamour en Espa�ol
. Kreuzpaintner�s direction is less assured, slipping at times into a melodramatic excess that threatens to disengage viewers; elsewhere, he seems to have borrowed circle pans and sun-baked Ektachrome from Traffic
. But is the movie exploitative? Not to the extent its marketing images � a naked woman with a bar code across her back, a Polaroid of the two terrified girls stamped �For Sale� � would suggest. It points a determined finger (a middle finger, almost) at law enforcement, which cannot or will not recognize kidnapping victims in our midst, especially if they are undocumented and brown-skinned.


Human trafficking is an awful societal issue, and "Trade" happens to be an awful movie about human trafficking. So they're made for each other: a wildly overwritten thriller about a shamefully underreported problem. The film brings us the story of two separate road trips that terminate in the same New Jersey house. One is conducted by Manuelo (Marco Pérez), a Mexican crook who's helped kidnap a group of girls and young women and a boy from Thailand and is now dragging them on foot and by van from Mexico to whoever has bought them in an online auction.
The other trip involves Ray (Kevin Kline), the Texas fraud cop who helps Jorge (Cesar Ramos), the young Mexican con man who just popped out of his trunk, to rescue his abducted 13-year-old sister (Paulina Gaitan). Why Ray agrees to do this makes no sense, but his wife (Linda Emond), whom he calls once in a while, goes along with every ounce of it. She's mourning their dead cat, and he's chasing his own melodramatic demons.
The director, Marco Kreuzpaintner, has no problem sensationalizing the rapes, beatings, and other tragic developments, while treating the cop and con man's trip to the Garden State with the chummy icebreaking of a buddy movie. But the script, by Jose Rivera, who wrote "The Motorcycle Diaries," was adapted from a controversial 8,500-word New York Times
 Magazine story about a house in Plainfield, N.J., where four Mexican women between the ages of 14 and 17 were held captive and forced to have sex.
The story was accused of being problematically impressionistic. The movie is problematically desperate to entertain at the expense of logic. Manuelo violently insists one of his hostages pose sexily, like a fashion model, for his camera without waiting for her to stop blubbering or wipe the dirt from her face. At some point, two of the captives break free then make inexplicably stupid decisions that get them recaptured. And the filmmakers want to find the apparent madam behind this operation so superhumanly nasty on top of her already nasty scheme that you root for her comeuppance, not as a matter of moral justice so much as the cathartic requirement of a thriller. This isn't an indicting work of journalism about an ugly global industry with an American hub. It's a rigged public-service announcement girdled into the demands of a very cheap thriller. You might leave wanting to fight sex trafficking, but you'll want to take a long shower first.


A 13-year-old girl (Paulina Gaitan) is grabbed off the streets of Mexico City; a young Polish mother (Alicja Bachleda) is lured out of her country by a bogus nanny agency set up by the Russian Mob. Both are drugged, one is raped, and they are then dragged on a back-roads journey up to the United States, their identities snuffed, their paths all but impossible to trace. The evil captured by the journalistic thriller Trade  begins with a clear-eyed account of the terrors of sex trafficking. It ends disturbingly close to home: in New Jersey, where that girl is placed in a cozy-looking house on a tree-lined block, as her virginity is auctioned off via the Internet to the highest bidder.
It's one thing to ''accept'' prostitution as an ugly but routine fact of human society. It's quite another to confront that there are now brothels, nestled all over middle-class America, in which young women, often underage, are imported as slaves. Trade , based on a New York Times Magazine  story, chronicles that evil with unblinking detail. To watch the movie, however, you have to swallow a more necessary evil, which is the echt Hollywood story of Jorge (Cesar Ramos), the girl's teenage hothead brother, and Ray (Kevin Kline), the Texas lawman who teams up with him to help get her back. Kline gives a quiet, mournful, and effective performance, but too much of his rescue mission is too contrived to believe. As a movie, Trade  is so-so, but as an exposé of how the new globalized industry of sex trafficking really works, it's a disquieting, eye-opening bulletin.

 An eagerly prurient dip into the sex-trafficking trough, “Trade” teeters between earnest exposé and salacious melodrama. Minus the film’s near-visible weight of conscience, success in the second category would have been virtually guaranteed.  Based on a controversial 2004 New York Times Magazine article by Peter Landesman, “Trade” is essentially an odd-couple road movie in which the extras are perverts and the victim is virginity. When 13-year-old Adriana (Paulina Gaitan) is kidnapped in Mexico City, her older brother, Jorge (a ferocious Cesar Ramos), assisted by an uptight Texas cop (Kevin Kline), tracks her abductors to New Jersey and an Internet sex auction.  Presenting Mexico as a country where everyone is corrupt and all visitors are fair game, Jose Rivera’s highly improbable and sensationalized screenplay leaves its actors no room for authenticity. Marco Kreuzpaintner directs with commendable energy, but squanders Daniel Gottschalk’s gold-dust-strewn images on hyperventilating voyeurism and an ending that sticks to your shoes, if not your heart. His intentions may be laudable but his goals are conflicted: in seeking to educate as well as tease, he ends up doing neither.  “Trade” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are raped, beaten, drugged and driven to suicide.

With all of the earmarks of being a serious and thoughtful drama written by talented screenwriter and playwright Jose Rivera and based on New York Times Magazine reporter Peter Landesman's investigative work on the international sex slave trade network, it comes as something of a shock to discover that the final film is little more than a slipshod, trashy, sometimes exploitative thriller. But because of that very quality, distrib Lionsgate looks to have a fear-mongering audience-grabber that will play like a straightforward genre piece for an April 13 rollout, while helping to further the psychic and political divide between the U.S. and Mexico.
Troubling signs are as immediate as the opening credits, in which the eye is assaulted with jazzed-up, touristy views of Mexico City. A robbery of an absurdly naive white Yanqui tourist transmits the unambiguous message that Mexico is a crime-filled cesspool. Warned by his mom that going to the city's main plaza, the Zocolo, is too dangerous (which would be news to natives and visitors alike), Jorge (Cesar Ramos) goes there to con travelers out of their cash.
Meanwhile, Jorge's 13-year-old sister Adriana (Paulina Gaitan) can't wait to ride the bike he has given her. She's immediately abducted by what Jorge soon learns is a Russian network of sex slave traders.
Incredibly, in a city of nearly 20 million, Jorge is able to spot Adriana being manhandled by Russian thug Youchenko (Pasha D. Lychnikoff) and coyote Manuelo (Marco Perez) -- and to follow the crooks' truck 1,200 miles to the border city of Juarez without being spotted.
Going to the cops is pointless, since the pic informs us that all Mexican cops are corrupt and worse. Rather, Jorge finds an ally in a Texas gringo and a federal insurance fraud investigator named Ray (Kevin Kline, in possibly the most stark miscasting of his career), though the slightly roughneck and demonstrably uncivilized Mexican and the meticulously clean and classical music-loving American battle briefly before becoming loyal allies.
Director Marco Kreuzpainter carries on a ghoulish interest in how Manuelo regularly abuses the young girls -- particularly Polish teen Veronica (Alicja Bachleda), and one especially nasty close-up of an Asian boy being forcibly injected in the neck with drugs. The feeling grows that the film has crossed the line from politicized thriller to sordid sensationalism.
Particularly strange, given Jorge's dogged pursuit of his beloved sister -- all the way to New Jersey, no less -- is how Adriana is backgrounded and Veronica foregrounded in the kidnapping sequences.
Given the pic's gaping holes in logic, it hardly flutters an eyebrow that Ray and Jorge are able to worm their way into the operation.
"Trade" undercuts its own worst tendencies for stoking fear and paranoia by letting auds off the hook with at least four happy endings, ranging from a nick-of-time police raid on the sex-trade house to Jorge extracting his pound of flesh from Youchenko.
Shifting from the bucolic mood of his German hit "Summer Storm" to this sleaze marks a bizarre career move for Kreuzpainter, who draws perfunctory performances from his cast, and can do nothing to help Kline convince as a Texas law-and-order conservative.
Pic has the look of a glossy docudrama, with the production ably handling a wide range of locales from Mexico City streets to the Jersey 'burbs.

Based on a 2004 New York Times Magazine   article about the sex-trafficking business and starring a very straight-faced Kevin Kline , Trade  should be a gritty, multifaceted, high-minded story about the price and politics of human slavery. Instead, it's pure exploitationthe kind of movie after which you need a long, hot shower. German director Marco Kreuzpaintner 's movie looks  like Traffic  and Syriana clearly his role modelsbut is little more than our generation's version of 1979's Hardcore . It's set mostly in Mexico, where girls are snatched from streets and airports to become unwilling sex slavesamong them Veronica (Alicja Bachleda-Curus ), who is lured to Mexico from Poland  and is set to go up for auction in New Jersey, and Adriana (Paulina Gaitan ), a teenager knocked off her bike and snatched in the broad-daylight streets of Mexico City. From Mexico to Jersey, we see plenty of pit stops at which these women (and, in one ghastly sequence, a young boy) are abused. (Kline's here as a cop looking for his own grown daughter.) The filmmaker has managed to take an exhaustive and troubling investigative story and render it into a tawdry little thriller. Among its myriad problems is the fact Trade  doesn't say anything about sex trafficking other than "Wow, it's horrible."
