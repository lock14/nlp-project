"Space Chimps" isn't just the title of the new computer-animated film opening today. It's a generic product description. You - or rather your very young children - understand that those functional two words promise monkeyshines and rocketry, and that's all they need to know. A critic's job is harder. Reviewing this thing is like reviewing a waffle iron.
In which case, does it make good waffles? Not really, but kids, the little garbage pails, will eat just about anything. Short, cheap, weird, and passably diverting, "Space Chimps" tells the tale of Ham (voiced by Andy Samberg of "SNL"), a cavalier circus chimp drafted by NASA to lead an interstellar space mission. Problem is he's an irresponsible cowboy, and his arrogance appalls dedicated crew-mates Luna (Cheryl Hines) and Titan (Patrick Warburton). Once on the alien planet, differences fall away as the three contend with Lord Zartog (voiced by Jeff Daniels, who I'm guessing has college bills to pay), a Shrek-ish meanie turned dictator.
"Space Chimps" is notable for the low-cost ugliness of its animation and for a strange bargain-bin surrealism. The movie's surfaces have a hard, plastic sheen to them that's the exact opposite of Pixar's
 fertile detail (the humans especially seem to have come out of the computers half-cooked).
I'm also not quite sure what to think about Kilowatt (Kristin Chenoweth), a tiny, Kewpie-headed critter whose head lights up and who at one point passes blithely through the intestinal tract of a cave monster. Back at Mission Control, our heroes are guided by a kid chimp (Zack Shada), Ham's grizzled mentor (Carlos Alazraqui), a nasty senator (Stanley Tucci), and a trio of scientists, the least amusing of which is a "funny" Hindi nerd (Omid Abtahi) who falls down a lot. "Space Chimps" ain't "The Simpsons" and it shouldn't have gone there.
Aside from teaching your children racist stereotypes - and, really, it's never too early - the movie's acceptable entertainment for the toddler set. Anyone older may resist, especially since there are so many superior animated movies out there already. "Space Chimps" raises the question: How are you going to keep them down on the render-farm after they've seen "WALL-E"?


Three brainy chimpanzees are sent on an intergalactic test flight by scientists too daft to realize the primates are actually smarter than they are. What starts as a simian spin on The Right Stuff   becomes a monkey-brained space odyssey as the apes fight to save an alien world from a despot who looks like the love child of a Teletubby  and the monster from Cloverfield  . While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids, Space Chimps  has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar -given knowledge that CGI can entertain  and not just stupefy  moviegoers of any age.

 Journalism is all about having the courage to write the truth even if it will get you mocked  by your relatives and co-workers, so here goes: “Space Chimps” is hilarious.  Yes, the name combined with the G rating might have parents thinking they should stay in the car while the kiddies go into the theater, but that would be a mistake. It would, among other things, cause them to miss one of the better one-liners of the summer, the capper in a string of chimp puns delivered by a title character. Waiting to read it here? You’ll wait a long time.  If “Wall-E”  pushes the boundaries of what can be done in an animated movie, “Space Chimps” proves that the old formula is still pretty effective when executed well. The old formula being a  child-friendly tale laced with deadpan asides for grown-ups and delivered by top-notch voice actors.  “Before man braved that first giant step, the brave stepped into the rocket,” a narrator intones as the film begins. “And the brave were chimps.”  And then we meet Ham III (Andy Samberg), the smart-alecky grandson of one of the original chimps in space, who has a job at a circus, being fired out of a cannon. He doesn’t aspire to much more, but events are conspiring to put him on a path to his true destiny: a space probe has been sucked into a wormhole, and there are plans to send a crew of chimps after it.  It’s an experiment to see if the chimps can survive wormhole sucking, and the space agency hunts down Ham for the publicity-stunt value, teaming him with Luna (Cheryl Hines) and Titan (Patrick Warburton, the chimp pun maker, who is a droll riot as always).  When do the adults in the audience first know that this film has plenty for them? When that space probe lands on a planet full of blobby things and plays the video it has brought along to tell alien life forms the story of Earth and its humans. Suffice it to say that this video was not properly vetted at NASA.  An evil blobby thing named Zartog (Jeff Daniels) uses the space probe as a weapon to terrorize the rest of the planet’s population (also to build a casino), and it is up to the space chimps to dethrone him. Kristin Chenoweth, the Broadway fave, is the voice of one of the ugliest cute characters in animation history, a thing with a giant head.  Back on the ground, Stanley Tucci leads the group of hapless humans who don’t realize how smart the space chimps are. The film’s writers, Rob Moreland and Kirk DeMicco (who also directed), slyly nod to assorted space movies and clichés. And the music, some of it by Blue Man Group, keeps things rolling along.

As light as a banana souffle and about as substantial, "Space Chimps" is a diverting dish for young moviegoing primates. Though dwarfed by the summer's two 800-pound animated gorillas (well, one panda and a robot), Fox's relatively under-the-radar toon is a fairly fatuous but enjoyably slim family entertainment about three chimps dispatched to retrieve a multibillion-dollar intergalactic probe. Without the massive promo push afforded those other behemoths, pic's theatrical landing may barely register. A more promising payload surely awaits in the home-entertainment sphere.
As much as "Space Chimps" monkeys around with reality, it's inspired, at least in part, by an actual event: In 1961, NASA sent a chimpanzee called Ham (an acronym for the Holloman Aerospace Medical Center) on a brief mission in an initial test run for manned space exploration. In the premise for this comedy, helmed and co-scripted (with Robert Moreland) by Kirk DeMicco, the chimps are drafted for their first space expedition in decades after the Infinity probe crash-lands on an alien planet.
Unsure of the planet's atmospheric conditions, the Space Agency, under the eye of an ambitious senator (voiced by Stanley Tucci), resolves to send three highly trained chimps to retrieve the Infinity probe. Sniffing a PR opportunity, the politician suggests filling a seat with Ham III, grandson of the original space chimp -- never mind that the junior Ham (Andy Samberg) is a contented member of a traveling circus, whose only aeronautics experience is his day job as a simian cannonball.
Initially resistant, Ham becomes intrigued by the mission only after meeting the attractive and brilliant chimp co-pilot, Lt. Luna (Cheryl Hines). Their teammate, self-important monkey Commander Titan (Patrick Warburton), is more brawn that brains. After a turbulent start, they head into space and land on planet Malgor, where they meet the evil alien Zartog (Jeff Daniels), a kind of crazed, insatiable real-estate developer seeking global dominion.
In no time, Luna and Ham must track down the probe, rescue Titan and help liberate the enslaved Malgoreans. They're aided by the diminutive Kilowatt (a part tailor-made for Kristin Chenoweth), who leads Luna and Ham through Malgor's Valley of Really Bad Things, which are, of course, only as bad as a G rating allows.
The quasi-facsimile nature of computer animation -- it's always a hair or two removed from reality -- is remarkably well suited to rendering the chimps, who are so disarmingly (and alarmingly) like humans themselves. Effective, too, is the visual design for planet Malgor: It's as if Dali's withered landscapes and Bosch's cast of eccentrics have been slathered in candy-colored hues borrowed from Strawberry Shortcake.
Though it plainly seeks to satisfy young kids, every now and then, "Space Chimps" offers a winking laugh for the adults in the audience. Luna and Ham's psychobabble dialogue (they're floating on the Dark Cloud of Id), for instance, may mean little to children, but it's a choice allusion. The score, credited to Chris Bacon and the Blue Man Group (who invite alien comparisons themselves), seamlessly blends familiar melodies with jaunty new compositions.
