The premise is out of '70s porn, and so is the overbroad satire and almost total lack of conviction. Katherine Waterston, who's like a bookish Juliette Lewis, plays a teenage wallflower who starts to sleep with the man she's babysitting for (John Leguizamo). Blink and you'll miss the moment she morphs into a heartless pimp-madam, organizing the local Heathers into a ring of babysitter hookers. Director David Ross one-dimensionalizes the girls (they're capitalist vamps) and makes the men victims. He should have called this The Stepford Sluts .


 Until it crosses a shadowy line dividing serious comedy from distasteful exploitation, “The Babysitters” has the makings of an incisive satire of greed and lust in suburbia. Katherine Waterston (a daughter of Sam) portrays Shirley Lyner, a cool-headed high school honors student and baby sitter who stumbles into an affair with her employer, Michael Beltran (a miscast John Leguizamo). A middle-aged advertising executive who feels guilty about their first stolen kiss while taking her home, Michael overtips her. When they eventually have sex, he gives her $200. This paves the way for the enterprising Shirley to enlist her best friend, Melissa (Lauren Birkell), as a “baby sitter” for  Michael’s pal Jerry (Andy Comeau). Before long Shirley is running a teenage prostitution ring and demanding 20 percent of her girls’ earnings.  Her business is threatened by Nadine (Halley Wegryn Gross), a new recruit who balks at paying Shirley a percentage and steals her clients, and by the emotional instability of Nadine’s half sister, Brenda (Louisa Krause), who begins to come apart after being given Ecstasy at a weekend orgy. As the war escalates, the director,  David Ross, loses control of his volatile material, which eventually blows up in his face.  Shirley’s instant metamorphosis from insecure high school student to ruthless madam is ludicrous in spite of the best efforts of the talented Ms. Waterston to convince you otherwise.  “The Babysitters” has the increasingly jerky momentum of a film that was butchered in the cutting room, sacrificing continuity and character development to whip the plot forward. And Cynthia Nixon is wasted in the role of Michael’s prim wife, Gail.  The plaintive story of Michael’s unhappy marriage to a once-wild woman is all but buried under the movie’s unsavory portrait of shame-faced middle-aged men drooling over under-age nubile flesh.  “The Babysitters” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for disturbing strong sexual content, language and some drug use involving teenagers.

An honors student turns into a high school version of Heidi Fleiss when clients request more than child-minding services in the indie misfire "The Babysitters." At first, David Ross' writing-helming debut seems to promise a reflection on the soul-crushing mundanity of suburbia a la� "American Beauty," or some of the cynical satire of "Mini's First Time," but it ultimately fails to deliver on the audacity of its premise. Neither truly original nor a guilty-pleasure genre spin, the pic lacks a hook for general audiences who may find the subject matter distasteful as presented.
Casually amoral tone is set in the opening moments, with an attention-grabbing scene of middle-aged men in compromising positions with teen girls. Voiceover of protag Shirley (Katherine Waterston, daughter of vet thesp Sam) promises to explain about her baby-sitting service, noting, "Paid fellatio's not that much more humiliating than flipping burgers."
Backtracking several months, pic shows ultra-organized, financially challenged Shirley falling into an affair with married advertising exec Mike (John Leguizamo), father of two of her charges. He assuages his guilt by slipping her substantial bonuses.
Mike tells old college pal Jerry (Denis O'Hare) about their relationship/deal while Shirley spills the beans to best friend Melissa (sparky Lauren Birkell). When Jerry wants to schedule a special baby-sitter, Melissa's willing to oblige, and Shirley claims 20% for making the appointment.
Soon, demand for babysitters-cum-call girls outstrips supply, so Shirley recruits stepsisters Brenda (Louisa Krause) and Nadine (Halley Wegryn Gross). In spite of her cool assessment of risk and reward, Shirley loses control as her empire expands and employees rebel.
Ross' skills as writer-director are shown to best advantage in the brightly choreographed, wickedly funny high school scenes. Montage of girls sliding envelopes with Shirley's pimping fee into her locker is particularly nice. He also tips his hat to the gangster genre when Shirley and Melissa stage power plays to frighten a disloyal underling who's trying to cut into the business.
More problematic is the depiction of prostitution (never explicitly shown) as a choice the girls are very much in control of. Strangely, only "dumb" girl Brenda is shown as having any moral quandaries.
Shirley's transformation from principled straight-arrow to amoral, money-grubbing businesswoman is not completely convincing, although it's more due to the script than Waterston's game perf. Leguizamo seems to want to make Mike nicer than the plot dictates, while Birkell and Krause make strong impressions in supporting roles.
Tech package is smooth, with high school scenes boasting the most visual panache.

Used to be that babysitters only solved mysteries or got caught in the middle of Mafia deals. Now they're charging $200 to eat a cock-meat sandwich. How did we get here? So wonders a comatose Shirley (Katherine Waterston ), pert brown nipples trying to break on through to the other side of a wafer-thin white top, and as The Babysitters  leaves the Ecstasy-laden party that the teenage madam organizes for her clients and backtracks to the fateful day when Michael (John Leguizamo ) sowed her groove thang, the obsessive- compulsive high-schooler asserts: "Sometimes I do stupid things. I don't know why." Like her, David Ross 's film parses the rise and fall of a babysitters'-club-cum- prostitution-ring with a near-unwillingness to bust a brain cell, though nuts get a considerable workout. As Shirley introduces her posse of Junos and Heathers to the townies, the occasional social commentary rises to the surface—Ross repeatedly acknowledges the way middle-aged pervs appeal to the insecurities of young girls—but these glints of insight are as colorlessly sketched as the $20 bills that Shirls stuffs under her mattress. Ultimately, the film's view of female self-loathing and girl-on-girl exploitation is as woefully reductive and painful as the it's-all-fun-and-games- until-your-dad-gets-in-on-the-action capper and the propensity for Desperate Housewives  –style summarizing.
