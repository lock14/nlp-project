"I thought it would be funnier," murmured another filmgoer at the close of this celluloid update of Jackie Gleason�s 1950s blue-collar comedy chestnut. And that, I can only assume, is one bravely optimistic man. Four screenwriters, including veteran TV producer Danny Jacobson, have cobbled together a script so rickety that it could itself pass as one of Ralph Kramden�s harebrained get-rich schemes. Schultz�s direction is plodding, with the artistic flair of spackle, and he seems to have instructed his cast to mimic their small-screen forebears down to the last gesture; more�s the pity, because a more radical reworking of the show�s subject matter (the myth of class mobility and the strain upon marriages whose partners sling the hash and fix the sewers of America�s largest and most contentious city) would be worth seeing, particularly with the film�s predominantly African-American cast. Instead, the film engages the issue of racism only once, in its only good joke: fashionably high-strung, glad-handing white partygoers are unable to distinguish two Asian musicians from Ralph (Cedric the Entertainer) and his doofy neighbor Ed (Epps). Sure, there�s a reptilian property developer (Stoltz, who doesn�t have to do much besides show up) threatening to snatch away the Kramdens� only chance at homeownership, but the movie cares more about its "make money" montages, mother-in-law jokes, and the doleful eyes of a spotted greyhound (animal actor Iggy) rescued from a Dumpster. Leguizamo, of course, is the movie�s wild card; as the dubiously credentialed trainer recruited to prep Iggy for the inevitable Big Race, he�s so bizarre that he threatens to make the movie interesting. Otherwise the movie bumbles along in a sort of gimmicky torpor, as if assured that the pedigree of its cast and its strategic marketing campaign can fill enough urban seats for a decent opening weekend. It�s a shame when a movie brings together so many underutilized thespians of color � even Ajay Naidu of Office Space
 is in here someplace � and gives them absolutely nothing to do.


An uncle of mine used to joke that he'd know racial parity had been achieved in Hollywood when black people started making movies as bad as white people's. I always thought his joke aimed too low. But according to his logic, the predominantly black update of ''The Honeymooners" would be an achievement. It's not as bad as the average Hollywood movie, it's stupendously worse.
It's tough to imagine that an American of any stripe has been clamoring for someone to make a movie of the classic television show. But here it is anyway: a vehicle for Cedric the Entertainer to ham and clown and generally look foolish as Ralph Kramden, the irritable bus driver that made Jackie Gleason famous 50 years ago. This Ralph Kramden still drives a bus, and, along with his obtuse pal, Ed Norton (Mike Epps), is still getting himself in trouble with get-rich-quick schemes.
But the movie has a gaping credibility problem whose name is Gabrielle Union. She's the talented and beautiful woman consigned to play Alice, Ralph's wife, and I slouched through this film flabbergasted that such an intelligent, indisputably hot woman would throw her life away on a loser who, to quote my sister in reference to an ex-boyfriend, ''ain't about nothing."
Alice works in a diner, with her best pal, Ed's wife, Trixie (Regina Hall). Alice has been saving money to buy a duplex for the two couples to movie into. Ralph, however, keeps emptying their bank account for nonsense schemes such as hawking T-shirts and racing a dog. That Alice would tolerate this man only makes her look stupid, and the movie is never funny or appealing enough to distract you from the incongruity.
On television, babes married to obnoxious fat dudes is less absurd, principally because, over the course of a season, a show can ingratiate itself enough for an audience not to mind that Jim Belushi, Kevin James, Mark Addy, and Rodney Carrington are less attractive than their TV wives. But there's no love in this movie, and no reason to believe in the Kramdens's marriage for the sake of comedy or romance.
While Alice and Trixie try to stop a slick real estate baron (poor Eric Stoltz) from taking their duplex, Ralph and Ed panhandle, breakdance, and waste money on scratch cards. The movie prizes their ignorance. The black characters are roundly dumber than the white ones. Ed, for instance, thinks Argentina is ruled by a shah. What are the filmmakers trying to tell us? If the idea was to update the show for a generation unaware of its importance in the sitcom pantheon, why have the characters stick so slavishly to dynamics established five decades ago? The movie feels pre-modern.
Inferior remakes appear to be the only way that Hollywood thinks funny black people can carry their own movies. Chris Rock made ''Down to Earth," a version of ''Heaven Can Wait." And Bernie Mac just did ''Guess Who." Cedric is currently signed up for a remake of ''Back to School," that Rodney Dangerfield jalopy from the '80s. How far are we from Wanda Sykes in ''I Love Lucy"?
This is Cedric's seventh movie in a year, and his bellowing, jiggling, hippity-hoppity shtick stopped entertaining me some time ago. His ubiquity makes Jude Law seem like Halley's comet. And his taste in projects suggests a man whose Visa bill is higher than his standards.
''The Honeymooners" is a kindergartner's movie. It's loaded with Cedric's and Epps's exaggerated (not to mention crudely filmed) expressions and one inane pratfall after the next. ''Madagascar," silly as that movie is, has more to offer a conscious adult. Like the critters in that picture, Ralph and Ed are blundering cartoons. But even the cartoons in ''Madagascar" have intelligence and common sense.


         Hey, kids! Remember Ralph Kramden? The cranky bus driver who was forever threatening to punch his wife, Alice, in the face? You know, Jackie Gleason! Audrey Meadows!
 
  OK, forget it. "The Honeymooners" stars Cedric theEntertainer as the aforementioned cranky bus driver, only now there's no threat of domestic violence save for forever threatening his wife's savings account with his get-rich-quick schemes.
 


         






    Alice is played by the gorgeously dimpled Gabrielle Union, whose job in a diner — where she works with Ralph's buddy Ed's (Mike Epps) minxy wife, Trixie (Regina Hall) — keeps her looking sharp, acting sassy and dreaming of buying a gorgeous Victorian duplex before it gets flattened for condos by a smarmy real estate developer (Eric Stoltz).
 
  The duplex belongs to a kindly old British lady retiring to Florida, though not before getting in saucy lines like "What's your poison? Gambling? Drink? 'Ho's?" Whoo! Raise the roof, Grandma!
 
  While Alice hits up her mother, Ralph and Ed try break dancing in the park, buying a Pullman car stuck in a sewer tunnel and racing a greyhound they found in a dumpster. John Leguizamo steals the show as its sleazy trainer — not that there's much to steal from John Schultz's joylessly schematic paycheck.
 
  Still, a $20,000 down payment buys a duplex in Brooklyn? I'm moving to New York!

Less than five minutes into The Honeymooners   an adaptation of the classic TV show as loose as Jackie Gleason's trousers on Art Carney  the movie announces its collapse. ''I'll take you to the moon,'' coos  soon-to-be-wed NYC bus driver Ralph Kramden (Cedric the Entertainer) to his intended, Alice Gibson (Gabrielle Union  looking way too young for him). The pop-eyed marital violence of the series is reduced to a cuddly come-on that reveals the craven synthesis behind this whole venture. It's downright creepy to promise Alice the moon, when we all remember her original mode of transport. The filmmakers have made that matter moot: They keep their cutesy Ralph and his child bride safely separated. (So...why remake this, again?) Instead, the story hopscotches among various sketches, er, schemes hatched by Ralph and Norton (Mike Epps). Epps has a nicely beaten charm to him  among the leads, he alone looks like he knows what a trip to the moon costs.


Yet another remake of a classic TV sitcom, "The Honeymooners" is just funny enough to mollify purists and amuse the uninitiated. To be sure, pic likely will play best with auds too young to know much about the source material venerated by many older ticketbuyers. But even fans who have memorized whole swaths of dialogue from the '50s series starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney might enjoy bits and pieces of this updated version top-lining Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Epps. Expect mid-range B.O. numbers during its summer theatrical run, followed by sunnier homevid sales and rentals.
Scripters Danny Jacobson, David Sheffield, Barry W. Blaustein and Don Rhymer have changed lead characters from white to African-American. Except for that not-insignificant alteration, however, feature remains surprisingly faithful in spirit to the original 39 black-and-white episodes -- arguably the most exhaustively rerun programs in TV history -- produced in 1955-56.
(For the record: Gleason introduced "Honeymooners" as a recurring sketch in his early '50s variety show, and later revived the characters -- in living color -- for mini-musicals presented during the run of "The Jackie Gleason Show" in 1960s. Unofficially, of course, the show also inspired "The Flintstones.")
The low-concept premise, now as then, pivots on New York bus driver Ralph Kramden (Cedric), a would-be wheeler-dealer who dreams and schemes to provide better lives for himself and his long-suffering wife Alice (Gabrielle Union). His get-rich-quick plans usually involve city sewer worker Ed Norton (Epps), his none-too-bright buddy and upstairs neighbor, much to the dismay of Trixie (Regina Hall), Ed's tart-tongued spouse.
Trouble is, Ralph's ambitions far outstrip his abilities, and his repeated failures sorely test Alice's love and patience.
In sharp contrast to the stark, almost Edward Hopperish set where most of the action took place in the '50s sitcom, the apartment conceived for the big-screen Kramdens by production designer Charles Wood seems a more spacious and much cheerier abode.
Still, Alice dreams of living in her own home. And she views a newly available fixer-upper duplex (which she hopes to share with the Nortons) as her dream come true. Trouble is, a supercilious real estate developer (Eric Stoltz) already has his acquisitive eye on the property.
Making a down payment becomes even more of a challenge for Alice after Ralph depletes their bank account to finance another moneymaking scheme. He impulsively buys an antiquated railroad car that Norton discovered in a deserted underground station, hoping to use the vehicle for a sightseeing business.
When that grand plan hits a roadblock, Ralph and Ed next try to transform an abandoned greyhound dog into a champion racer. With a little help from the aptly named Dodge (John Leguizamo), a grungy con artist and self-described "trainer," the two friends almost succeed in reaching the winner's circle. Almost.
Totally at ease in the role of Ralph, Cedric wisely shies away from undue mimicry of Gleason's familiar antics as the sometimes blustery, sometimes abashed bus driver. (This Ralph may promise Alice the moon, but he never 
threatens to send her there.) And while he certainly doesn't banish all memory of his illustrious predecessor, he's amusing and engaging enough to stake his own claim to this particular incarnation of the character.
Likewise, Epps comes across as slightly brainier than Carney ever did as Ed Norton. In a couple of scenes, however, he gets laughs by recalling the fastidious body language Carney brilliantly brought to moments of physical comedy. And while Hall gets overshadowed every bit as often as Trixie did on the old TV show, Union more than holds her own opposite Cedric with an attractive mix of sexy sweetness and steely determination.
Perhaps the most striking thing about "The Honeymooners" is the overall discipline evidenced by director John Schultz ("Like Mike") and his players. Gross-out humor is conspicuous by its absence; sight gags are bound by the laws of physics and gravity.
Nothing -- not even Stoltz's serious villainy or Leguizamo's improvised wackiness -- is allowed to disrupt the storyline. (Jon Polito plays it mostly straight as a dog track official who briefly impedes the protagonists.) This restraint may keep pic from reaching dizzying heights of free-wheeling lunacy, but it also prevents descent into overbearing excess or unbearable silliness. As a result, the lightweight comedy earns far more chuckles than guffaws, but no pained groans at all.
Echoing the tone of the original TV show, pic is too soft-hearted to indulge in easy-laugh cruelty, and too affectionate toward its characters to play the humiliation card too often. Ending is upbeat -- but, once again remaining true to source material, not too
 upbeat.
Production values are first-rate across the board. Much of pic was shot in Ireland -- at Ardmore Studios and Shelbourne Park Greyhound Track -- but filmed-in-Manhattan exteriors provide sufficient New York flavor.

THE GREAT WATER    Directed by Ivo Trajkov    Picture This!, opens June 17, Quad
Orphans and cinema are old friends, at least since the days of D.W. Griffith  and Lillian Gish . Macedonian director Ivo Trajkov 's The Great Water  opens with an elderly politician, Lem Nikodinoski , being rushed to the hospital, as his mind wanders back to the close of World War II. Yugoslavia 's romance with Stalin was in full bloom, and the 12-year-old Lem (Saso Kekenovski) was interned in a re-education camp for the orphaned children of "enemies of the people." There he meets Isak (Maja Stankovska ), a boy who dabbles in occult religious practices and challenges the camp authorities. Despite the choppy script and cartoonishly bad villains, what emerges is a compelling tale of the moral compromises a corrupt system demands of even its most unwilling participants.
