Desire and fantasy fly from the page to the screen with delight in 'Twilight'
Remember the first high school crush who crushed on you back? Remember trembling right at the precipice of desire, of being flattened by emotions for which you had no words? Remember how it felt to know someone else's secret self - the frightening power it gave you and the danger of potential self-obliteration? Remember when love meant more than death?
No? In her canny, inelegant fashion, writer Stephenie Meyer remembered, packaging those fierce longings in "Twilight" and its three sequels. The books tell of the romance between Bella, a quiet, self-conscious high school junior, and Edward, an eternally 17-year-old, eternally misunderstood vampire. Meyer's not the greatest writer, but she located the missing link between gothic fiction and Goth, and it hit 14-year-old girls of all ages (and genders) like a hormone bomb.
Now comes "Twilight" the inevitable movie version - accompanied by a mass adolescent shriek so high-pitched only dogs and shopping mall security guards can hear it - and, lo, it's a darn good hunk of pop moviemaking. Actually, the movie's a better movie than the book was a book, in part because Meyer struggled to put her characters' galloping emotions into print whereas director Catherine Hardwicke just visualizes them in all their inarticulate purpleness.
Anyway, she knows her turf. In "Thirteen," "Lords of Dogtown," and even "The Nativity Story" (a.k.a. "I Was a Teenage Virgin Mary"), Hardwicke has made young, conflicted passion her topic A, and she seems congenitally unable to condescend to her subjects. The volcanic desires in "Twilight" are conveyed with the proper mix of intimacy, over-the-top tempest, and even self-mocking humor, but, more than that, the kids feel right in their hopes and cynicism. Forks High School has been made reassuringly real, the better for fantasy to take wing.
Kristen Stewart plays Bella like a well-balanced Morticia in training. Pale-skinned, her lips thin with impatience at the world's many small failures, she arrives in the small-town Pacific Northwest ready to wrap its fog around her shoulders. Her new friends are outgoing, puppyish, but Bella prefers to "suffer in silence." Then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who with his four undead siblings enters the school cafeteria in a slo-mo shot as funny as it is ridiculous as it is thrilling.
No one else is aware of what the Cullens really are - they're just Kabuki-faced kids who never eat lunch and stay home from school on sunny days, what's the big dealio? - but Bella knows. If she didn't, she'd have to catch on after Edward saves her from an out-of-control van in the school parking lot. The scene's shot as their first real date, the two silent and awestruck amid a tangle of metal.
If you're coming into this cold, please understand that the Cullens are good vampires who avoid human blood and concentrate instead on thinning the deer population of greater Washington State. Edward calls his family "vegetarians" and likens their food choices to tofu: "It keeps you strong but you're never really satisfied," he broods, hinting at the steak tartare he's craving. Somewhere out there, sadly, is a trio of far less picky bloodsuckers (Edi Gathegi, Rachel Lefevre, and Cam Gigandet); to goose suspense, the film shows them working their way toward our heroes much earlier than the book does.
In most other respects, "Twilight" the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it. This isn't a Xerox
 like Ron Howard's dirt-dull "The Da Vinci Code," but rather a cinematic amplification, and while Hardwicke has a lot to learn as a director of action sequences, she walks a wickedly smart line between indulging the corn and keeping her distance. This allows young women like those sitting next to me at a screening to silently mouth the dialogue along with the movie while giving us non-believers enough wiggle room to breathe.
While some of the players have the mannequin handsomeness of "One Tree Hill" extras - Peter Facinelli as Edward's adoptive father Carlisle, Ashley Greene as psychic sister Alice, Billy Burke as Bella's mordant sheriff dad - the heroine's classmates are a nicely unkempt bunch, especially Anna Kendrick as OMG best-pal Jessica. (Some of us have been watching this actress steal scenes since 2003's "Camp.") Stewart leans on her sullen monotone rather too much, but in fineness of features and hesitancy of emotions - Bella swoons, but slowly - she's a good match for her leading man.
And Pattinson is good - close to a revelation, in fact. It's the silliest of roles, really, since Edward has to be noble, messed-up, dangerous, and a sweetie-pie all at once, but the young British-trained actor makes it work by letting us see the absurdity of this vampire boy's life. He knows when to step on the gas and when to hit the brakes - both he and Stewart underplay their lines to keep them from tipping into comedy - and he conveys above all the pain of being, literally, forever young. At times, Edward shivers like James Dean without his jacket. He's a rebel without a pulse.
"Twilight" is at its best when dealing with intimacy rather than plot; the love scenes are filmed in close-ups that are purposefully too close, and when Edward and Bella finally kiss, the moment is as cold as it should be and as hot as it needs to be. This is the opposite of the book, where the love scenes meandered endlessly (caveat: I'm not a 14-year-old girl) and we all perked up when the bad vampires arrived toward the end. Hardwicke is as entranced by desire as her characters are, and she caves into the necessity of story reluctantly and unconvincingly. The baseball game of the undead isn't as weirdly funny as in Meyer, and the showdown with Gigandet's unstoppable villain feels like the filmmaker is throwing in the towel.
Besides, the important stuff has happened earlier, in those lovely, painful scenes between Bella and Edward. Hardwicke understands the dirty little secret of "Twilight," which is that it's all about sex without being about sex at all. In this story, a teenage girl falls for a gorgeous, tormented boy who could overpower and ravage her - could annihilate her - anytime he chooses. Instead, he holds back for her own protection until being annihilated is all she can think about.
As a metaphorical empowerment fantasy, that's a pip, and it's in keeping with both the book's mass spell and a filmmaker's vision of headstrong young women making their own choices, come hell or, in this case, Hell. Mom and Dad may think "Twilight" is just a ripsnorting yarn, but, as Howlin' Wolf once noted, the little girls understand.


If the droolingly awaited big-screen version of Twilight  is any indication, sanpaku  eyes are the new cheekbones. Marilyn Monroe and JFK both had sexy sanpakus  (in which the white of the orb is strikingly visible below the iris), and so does Robert Pattinson, the young British heartthrob who plays Edward Cullen, Twilight 's dreamy, sculpted hunk of a teenage vampire. With pasty skin, red lips, and those peepers that pop open wide with a touch of madness, Pattinson has a look so broodingly unearthly it's no wonder he doesn't sprout fangs. His creepy bedroom stare is a special effect all its own.
Here, as in Stephenie Meyer's 2005 novel, Edward is Romeo, Heathcliff, James Dean, and Brad Pitt all rolled into one: a scruffy-gorgeous bloodsucker pinup who is really an angelic protector. When Bella (Kristen Stewart), who has come to Forks, Wash., to live with her police-chief dad, sits next to Edward in biology class, he acts like he's suffering a seizure (or an attack of bad Mexican food). But it's only because he can barely control himself around her. It's no surprise that Bella tunes out the other kids, even as they try to befriend her. They don't make her tingle with the fear of her own desire. Edward, like any good vampire, has a predatory glamour. As Bella gets to know him, what's irresistible to her is that he promises not a blood consummation but its very opposite: a refusal to give in to the hunger that tempts him most.
For girls, the intense, ego-stroking appeal of Meyer's novel was the way that Bella becomes this undead Byronic stud's soul mate without quite knowing why she's worthy. She's a Kewl Generation damsel waiting to be rescued from her jaded heart. Stewart is an ideal casting choice  she conveys Bella's detachment, as well as her need to bust through it. And getting Catherine Hardwicke to direct Twilight  was a shrewd move, because the youthquake specialist of Thirteen  treats teen confusion without a trace of condescension: She gets their grand passions and prickly defense mechanisms. She has reconjured Meyer's novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies, rippling hormones, and understated visual effects. What Hardwicke can't quite triumph over is the book's lackluster plot. On screen, Twilight  is repetitive and a tad sodden, too prosaic to really soar. But Hardwicke stirs this teen pulp to a pleasing simmer.

Twilight  reviews roundup: And the verdict is...

 It’s love at first look instead of first bite in “Twilight,” a deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set. Based on the foundational book in Stephenie Meyer’s best-selling multivolume series, “The Twilight Saga” (four doorstops and counting), this carefully faithful adaptation traces the sighs and whispers, the shy glances and furious glares of two unlikely teenage lovers who fall into each other’s pale, pale arms amid swirling hormones, raging instincts, high school dramas and oh-so-confusing feelings, like, OMG he’s SO HOT!! Does he like ME?? Will he KILL me??? I don’t CARE!!! :)  And, reader, she doesn’t, the she being Bella (for Isabella) Swan, played with tremulous intensity and a slight snarl by Kristen Stewart. A sylph with a watchful, sometimes wary gaze who’s often cast in daughter roles, Ms. Stewart transformed from an appealing actress into something more complex with her brief, memorable turn in the 2007 movie of Jon Krakauer’s book “Into the Wild.” As the child-woman whose longing for the ill-fated wanderer Christopher McCandless is largely expressed through piercing looks and sensitive strumming, Ms. Stewart gave form and feeling to the possibility that the search for freedom and authentic experiences can be found in the embrace of another human being. This was a girl worth living for, if not for that film’s lost soul.  Since living really isn’t an option for Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the moody, darkly brooding vampire who catches Bella’s eye and then her heart, she becomes the girl worth fighting for, a battle that, as in the book, involves not just malignant forces, but also ravenous appetite. Like all vampire stories, “Twilight” is about repressed desire and untamed hunger and the possibility of blood, the blood that flows from violently pierced necks and that, from John Polidori’s 1819 short novel “The Vampyre” to Alan Ball’s new HBO series, “True Blood,” represents ravishment of a more graphic kind. This is the ravishment that, in its pantomime of seduction and surrender, transforms innocence — like that of Bram Stoker’s sacrificial virgin, Lucy, in “Dracula” — into “voluptuous wantonness.”  Ms. Meyer’s contribution to the vampire chronicles, the trick that transformed her into a best-selling brand, has been to stanch this sanguineous emission, turning a hot human flow into something less threatening and morally sticky. Edward, you see, burns but doesn’t bite. As in the book, he leads a numbingly quiet, respectable life with his vampire family in Forks, a small Washington town under a near-permanent cloud cover. His father, Carlisle (Peter Facinelli), a doctor with a ghostly pallor and silky gait, tends to the living, while the rest of the brood, including his monochromatic mother and siblings, strike pretty poses, play baseball (in thunder and lightning) and occasionally hunt for animals. We think of ourselves as vegetarians, Edward jokes.  It’s no wonder he looks famished. When Edward first meets Bella, who has moved to Forks to live with her father (Billy Burke), he glowers at her threateningly, his hands clenching into fists. Bella is mystified, and you might be too, if Melissa Rosenberg’s screenplay didn’t turn up the volume as the teenagers grow closer and Edward hints at his true nature. “What if I’m the bad guy?” he asks. (Cue the shrieking virgins.) “I still don’t know if I can control myself,” he later confesses, as someone’s guitar gently weeps. A self-described monster, he has all kinds of cool, superhuman powers (running, leaping, mind-reading), but nothing compares to how he masters his universe: he keeps his fangs in his mouth.  That may make him catnip to anyone with OJD (obsessive Jonas Brothers disorder), but it also means he’s a bore, despite the efforts of the capable and exotically beautiful Mr. Pattinson. (The actor first broke hearts as the martyred Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter cycle.) Though her filmmaking can be shaky, the director Catherine Hardwicke has an eye for pretty young things and a feel for the private worlds that younger people make for themselves. But she’s working in shackles here. In her best movie, “Lords of Dogtown,” about the birth of the modern skateboard movement, a teenage boy sneaks out at night by slaloming off a roof while holding a surfboard. It’s a blissful declaration of freedom, including freedom from the big parental no.  Though Edward and Bella reach certain heights in “Twilight,” notably during a charming scene that finds them leaping from piney treetop to treetop against the spectacular wilderness backdrop, the story’s moral undertow keeps dragging them down. If Ms. Meyer has made the vampire story safe for her readers (and their parents) — the sole real menace comes from a half-baked subplot involving some swaggering vampires who like their steak saignant and human — it’s only because she suggests that there actually is something worse than death, especially for teenagers: sex. Faced with the partially clad Bella (who would bite if she could), Edward recoils from her like a distraught Victorian. Like Ms. Hardwicke, the poor boy has been defanged and almost entirely drained. He’s so lifeless, he might as well be dead — oops, he already is.  “Twilight” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some violence, little viscera.

Vampires and the poor human beings who love them have been a hot onscreen item this season, as evidenced by HBO�s lurid hit series �True Blood� and the marvelous Swedish import �Let the Right One In.� For less discriminating palates, there�s the much-anticipated �Twilight,� a disappointingly anemic tale of forbidden love that should satiate the pre-converted but will bewilder and underwhelm viewers who haven�t devoured Stephenie Meyer�s bestselling juvie chick-lit franchise. Built-in femme fanbase will lend this Summit Entertainment release some serious B.O. bite, with Robert Pattinson�s turn as an undead heartthrob keeping repeat biz at a steady pump.
Having shown a real feel for the perilous social and emotional terrain of adolescent girlhood in her 2003 debut, �Thirteen,� Catherine Hardwicke seemed as good a director as any to steer this maiden adaptation of Meyer�s junior-Anne-Rice phenomenon. (Three more novels -- �New Moon,� �Eclipse� and �Breaking Dawn� -- have been released since �Twilight�s� publication in 2005, and the movie is nothing if not a prelude to future bigscreen sequels.)
But even with angsty rock songs, lurching camerawork and emo-ish voiceover at her disposal, Hardwicke can�t get inside the head of her young protagonist, Isabella �Bella� Swan (Kristen Stewart); consequently, Bella�s decision to get hot and heavy with a hot-and-hungry vampire, far from seeming like an act of mad, transgressive passion, comes across as merely stupid and ill-considered. The result is a supernatural romance in which the supernatural and romantic elements feel rushed, unformed and insufficiently motivated, leaving audiences with little to do but shrug and focus on the eye-candy.
Which is what Bella does when she first meets the brooding, intoxicatingly handsome Edward Cullen (Pattinson) at her new high school in Forks, Wash. Bella, a moody, intelligent teen who�s just moved from Phoenix to live with her police-chief dad (Billy Burke), is an outsider in this dreary little Pacific Northwest town. So are Edward and his four equally striking (if unnaturally pallid) siblings, who keep to themselves, go on regular camping trips and have an odd habit of never eating.
Bella finds herself utterly transfixed by Edward. (Judging by the screaming tweens in the audience at the screening caught, she�s not alone.) Yet devoid of the novel�s first-person narration, the chain of events laid out in Melissa Rosenberg�s screenplay -- Edward�s initial and inexplicable hostility toward Bella, his habit of rescuing her from contrived endangerment scenarios, their playfully barbed flirtation, his revelation of his identity as a self-controlled but still-lethal bloodsucker and, finally, their mutual surrender to their feelings -- proceeds with none of the inner logic necessary even for a tale of the fantastic.
Admittedly, it�s a relief that Rosenberg dispenses with Meyer�s often embarrassingly overripe prose (�His hair was dripping wet, disheveled ... his dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips�), and pic�s selective rewriting of the rules of vampire lore (no coffins, no garlic, no fatal aversion to sunlight) does hold interest. There�s a fleeting moment when the two leads -- standing together in a secluded glade, their bodies circled by the camera -- come close to capturing the tale�s lush, swooning romanticism.
Stewart (seen recently and most impressively in �Into the Wild�) makes Bella earthy, appealing and slightly withdrawn, and British thesp Pattinson (who registered poignantly as the ill-fated Cedric Diggory in �Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire�) is every inch the deadly dreamboat. But as helmed by Hardwicke, the actors� early, awkward interactions feel particularly forced, and the script gives Stewart virtually nothing with which to convince the audience of her transcendent love for a guy who�d just as soon drink her blood as jump her bones.
Burke steals a few scenes as Bella�s quietly dependable dad, as does the reliably sharp-witted Anna Kendrick as Bella�s busybody friend, Jessica. Questionable casting of some of Bella�s other classmates may rile purists, though Hardwicke and Rosenberg generate some laughs from the high school setting. Pic duly introduces Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a Native American youth who looks to rival Edward for Bella�s affections in future outings.
In an unwise departure from the book, pic dispels rather than increases the tension by showing random vampire attacks by a sinister trio (Cam Gigandet, Rachelle Lefevre, Edi Gathegi), headed toward a showdown with Edward and his brood. Chase-thriller endgame seems to sputter to a halt when it�s barely begun.
Visual effects, used to convey the vampires� superhuman strength, agility and resistance to gravity, are a mixed bag. Shot in moody, washed-out tones by Hardwicke�s regular lenser, Elliot Davis, pic makes the most of its Oregon locations . 


Stephenie Meyer s wildly popular novel, Twilight the first in a four-book series about a 17-year-old girl who falls in love with the hunky vampire who sits next to her in biology classbored me silly, but thats clearly a minority opinion. In the novel, Bella and her cold-to-the-touch lothario, Edward, talk and talk and talk. For the beautifully photographed (by cinematographer Elliot Davis ) film version, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg  (bless her) has pared the couples blather down to the essentials, as when Edward (Robert Pattinson ) says to Bella (Kristen Stewart ), Youre my own personal brand of heroin. Poor girl. How could she not succumb? Actually, Bellas in love/lust the moment she walks into her new Pacific Northwest  high school and sees Edward, who shuns her, and then loves her obsessively. Eventually, he introduces her to his progressive vampire familythey eat wild animals, not peopleand invites her for a game of bloodsucker baseball, where they encounter a vampire thug (Cam Gigandet ) who begins stalking Bella. Director Catherine Hardwicke  (Thirteen , Lords of Dogtown ) has drawn strong, star-making performances from her two leads, but in the end, shes clearly no more interested in vampires than Meyer herself. In the 17-million-copy land of Twilight , the calling card isnt blood and fangs, but the exquisite, shimmering quiver of unconsummated first love. By that measure, the movie version gives really good swoon.
