While the cartoon penguins of  Surf's Up
 �hang six� and persevere (�Find a way �cause that�s what winners do�), Bridges re-creates the "Dude.� Four screenwriters are credited on this animated avian surf epic, which is most alive when its script calls for radio-friendly pop hits accompanying beauty footage of CGI waves. There�s nothing terribly wrong with Surf�s Up
, except maybe the part where one character calls another a �dirty trash can full of poop.� But the movie isn�t terribly robust, either. It provides a blandly determined surfer hero (teen titan LaBeouf), a cute girl lifeguard (Deschanel), and Chicken Joe (Heder), a Spicoli-esque sidekick who gets all the laughs. There�s a showboating villain (Bader) who knocks kids off their boards, training montages, and a contest � in the end, nothing outside the summer-movie formula and nothing to suggest the artisanship of four writers. The film�s nearly all-bird world is pleasantly amusing � I liked Mario Cantone as a twitchy little sandpiper � and its mockumentary motif affords some laughs for parents, but really the movie is as evanescent as sea foam. Greater effort has been directed toward its marine visuals, which are truly lovely but should support a stronger story and more memorable characterizations. My 5-year-old companion had been wildly excited by the film�s previews but, upon seeing it, opined, �This movie is almost as long as Cars
.� This was not a compliment. The stoner jokes and cameos by surf greats (Rob Machado, Kelly Slater) whizzed over his head yet amused the adults only fleetingly, though he cracked up when a big penguin gave a little penguin a golden shower to heal a stingray wound. Elsewhere in the film, characters go sledding in a volcano � an action set-piece that left us befuddled. Wasn�t it awfully hot in there for a penguin? And full of poisonous gases? No matter.


They've been portrayed as gung-ho military commandos, tap-dancing ecologists, and fatalistic slaves to nature. Now animated penguins can add wobbly wave-riders to the list.
But unlike its predecessors, "Surf's Up," the latest CGI entry in the booming penguin oeuvre, is actually more in sync with "Riding Giants," Stacy Peralta's 2004 documentary ode to the sport, than with George Miller's Oscar-winning sing-a long "Happy Feet." Shooting in a faux hand-held style reminiscent of a Christopher Guest mockumentary, co-directors and animation veterans Ash Brannon ("Toy Story 2") and Chris Buck ("Tarzan") cleverly include reality show-like confessionals, accidentally dipping boom mikes, and flippers to the camera during intimate moments to enhance and make the most of the standard-issue awkward-outsider-finds-acceptance plot.
After a brief introduction to the history of surfing, accompanied by tinny music and scratchy, sepia-toned mock-film of penguins zipping about through the centuries, the camera finds its main subject in freewheeling Rockhopper penguin Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf). A native of Shiverpool, Antarctica, young Cody would much rather catch a wave on his ice-slab surfboard than help his mother and brother with their egg-sitting and fish-slicing duties. (When one of the cameramen, appropriately voiced by the directors, asks, "Do you have any other skills besides surfing?" Cody knowingly jokes, "Like singing or dancing? Yeah, right!")
Cody's salvation comes in the form of a fussy talent scout (Mario Cantone ) who reluctantly lets the wannabe champion hitch a ride and participate in tropical Pen Gu Island's annual surf-off. Before Cody can get his official wave on, however, he wipes out while challenging superstar Tank Evans and must be resuscitated by comely lifeguard Lani (Zooey Deschanel ) and her reclusive uncle, known only as Geek (Jeff Bridges) . Might Geek actually be Cody's childhood surfing hero Big Z, assumed dead after disappearing decades earlier? Will Cody realize fun is more important than trophies? Do fuzzy, wide-eyed baby penguins make tween girls squeal?
Though less preachy than "Happy Feet," "Surf's Up" also delivers a less sophisticated message, sticking to simple and easily digestible aphorisms ("Winning isn't everything," "Never give up"). And while not rife with mile-a-minute pop culture references like the "Shrek" movies, it delivers enough edge and inside jokes (real-life surfer Kelly Slater reporting for SPEN, the Surfing Penguin Entertainment Network, anyone?) between the bodily function jokes to keep parents as involved as their excited tykes.
The cleverest reference, sure to sail over kids' heads, is the spot-on casting of Bridges as the voice of Big Z. Playing off his "Dude" character in the Coen brothers' cult fave "The Big Lebowski," Bridges speaks lazily but sagely as the roly-poly ex-champion. LaBeouf and Deschanel are appropriately chipper and energetic as the young penguin pair, and James Woods and Jon Heder round out the flock of appealing vocal actors as, respectively, an otter promoter with both Don King's demeanor and upright hair and a constantly stoned surfer chicken.
Between the breezy surfer culture and insider references, "Surf's Up" is the most colorful of the penguin 'toons to date, both figuratively and literally. Set away from the pale icebergs of Antarctica, the animators, clearly excited to be expanding their color palette, design Pe Gu Island with attention to detail, conjuring up massive waves and swells with breath taking accuracy. While the simple narrative can't match the film's sparkling visuals, the result is far from a wipeout.


Surf's Up  bobs up and down in the summer-entertainment ocean, sometimes riding the buoyant swells of a giggly stoner joke, and other times cautiously paddling well-tested corporate currents. This is, after all, an animated family movie about  penguins   in the wake of March of the Happy Feet , they're the Angelina Jolie of animals, both cute and admired everywhere. Plus, it's about surfing , the Matthew McConaughey of shirtless American movie genres, always easy on the eyes. Lie on your back in a chlorinated pool  or on the carpeted floor of an L.A. office  and you can just about imagine the Hollywood studio sessions that hatched the casual-Fridays notion of cartoon penguins (among them the cocky young hero in need of fathering, the old-timer in need of rejuvenating, the bully in need of humbling, the doofus best friend in need of validating, the little-kid penguins in need of jokes involving pee and poo)...who enjoy competitive surfing...voiced by appealing movie stars...and buoyed by unmemorable pop songs.
And yet, as formulas go, the movie, team-written and -directed, sneaks in more tubular charm than the average adult ticket buyer might expect  or that very young attendees might appreciate. The conceit that a documentary crew accompanies newcomer surf talent Cody Maverick (a winning Shia LaBeouf) from Shiverpool, Antarctica, as he enters his first pro competition is a cool one, with room for a lot of gentle parody of reality TV conventions. Characters are regularly taken aside to comment on the action, and the omnipresent ''camera'' catches glimpses of personalities not at their best, including Cody's belittling older brother (Brian Posehn), an otter of a sports promoter (James Woods), and an agitated shorebird who's a talent scout (Mario Cantone).
This not being Blue Crush , there are no girl penguins competing in the water at all  there's only Lani (Zooey Deschanel) in the waves, a plucky lifeguard (and fellow waterfowl) who catches Cody's eye. But there are two standout players who convey the movie's laid-back lesson  learned at one's peril  that having fun is more important than winning. One of them's a chicken. Chicken Joe, to be specific, a surfer from fun-to-say Sheboygan, Wis., who is so naturally and genially loosey-goosey, and so stoner-sage in the pursuit of his own bliss, that he could be voiced only by Napoleon Dynamite 's Jon Heder. And he does so, with dime bags of charm.
And then there's the aging surfer legend, the Big Lebowski of the sport himself, a wise daddy-o of an out-of-shape penguin known locally as Geek. The dude could be voiced only by Jeff Bridges, and he makes this whole fabricated snack shack of a summer diversion work. Bridges puts warmth, patience, and innate cool into every line, like he was born to hang ten  a cat, er, penguin who truly has happy feet.

 Correction Appended  Ever since Luc Jacquet's endearing documentary "March of the Penguins" persuaded Hollywood that penguins are the new Bambis, we have endured singing, wisecracking and even tap-dancing versions. Now, treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's "Happy Feet," comes "Surf's Up," a computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards.  To deliver its winning-isn't-everything message, this ho-hum addition to the kiddie canon follows Cody Maverick (engagingly voiced by Shia LaBeouf), a young Rockhopper penguin with surfing in his blood and dreams of greatness in his head. Trailed by a documentary film crew, the fatherless Cody (Dad was eaten by a killer whale) heads for his first professional surfing competition, at which he will learn about love, perseverance and the feet-of-clay principle.  Assisting in his education is a washed-up champ (Jeff Bridges), a coy lifeguard (Zooey Deschanel) and the reigning titleholder (Diedrich Bader), whose relationship with his trophies borders on the indecent.  Directed by Ash Brannon and Chris Buck (both contributed to the screenplay), "Surf's Up" has a friendly, blue-collar vibe (Cody is an ex-fish-sorter from the  Shiverpool, Antarctica) and some sly, low-key humor. Nevertheless, a moratorium on penguins might be called for, despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. Lord help us if "Ratatouille" is a hit.  "Surf's Up" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Characters flirt, urinate on one another and behave lewdly with surfing trophies.

Just when parents managed to calm their tap-dancing tots, along comes another animated penguin pic -- this time featuring South Pole fowl who surf. Like last year's "Happy Feet," "Surf's Up" tells the story of a cuddly outcast who dreams big, much to the consternation of his flock, only this time, the personal journey is captured in the form of a mockumentary, complete with virtual crew and "handheld" cameras. Every bit as entertaining as the early Christopher Guest efforts, Sony toon is well positioned to ride the wave of penguin popularity to success this summer.
Chilly Willy aside, the current penguin craze started well before "March of the Penguins" shuffled to Oscar glory, having reemerged with four wise-talking stowaways in "Madagascar." "Surf's Up" transports the black-and-white birds from their monochromatic Antarctic habitat to tropical Pen Gu Island, where the world's top surfers convene for a championship contest.
Though story, with its warm humor and winning isn't everything message, seems pitched at the younger set, the mockumentary hook should appease parents who might otherwise be feeling burned out on talking-animal toons -- and penguin movies in particular. Though teens could get left out in the cold, the surfing-savvy among them will surely appreciate cameos by wave masters Kelly Slater and Rob Machado (as penguins), along with some of the edgier humor that earned the pic its PG rating.
Blending semi-improvised interviews with ESPN-style coverage, "Surf's Up" begins with a bird's-eye view of surfing history, with penguins naturally taking credit for inventing the sport.
"All you needed was a piece of driftwood or a block of ice, and you were off," Cody Maverick explains, his excitement contagious, the combination of music and scratchy 16mm footage perfectly calibrated to inspire goose bumps (if they could do it for "Grindhouse," why not an animated penguin movie?). As voiced by rising star Shia LaBeouf, Cody comes across as an immensely likeable and energetic acolyte of the sport. 
"Do you have any other skills besides surfing?" prods an off-camera interviewer, the boom mic dipping into the shot. "Like singing or dancing?" Cody laughs. "Yeah, right!" The joke isn't so much a diss at "Happy Feet" as a way of suggesting that, even without that pic's eco-friendly message, "Surf's Up" is no sillier than its musical predecessor. And with laid-back surfing legend "Big Z" (Jeff Bridges) as his guide (and Robin Williams absent from the cast), Cody's arc follows a much less manic trajectory. 
Biggest difference between the two films is the animation style. Where "Happy Feet" helmer George Miller favored a photorealistic approach, in which still frames could conceivably pass for National Geographic photos, "Surf's Up" directors Ash Brannon ("Toy Story 2") and Chris Buck ("Tarzan") anthropomorphize their penguin characters. Design isn't necessarily as striking as other recent CG toons, but the body language and eyes rank among the most expressive to date. 
Animation proves the ideal form to satirize nonfiction filmmaking, since no one could possibly mistake the result for the real thing. It's also forgiving in several useful ways, excusing not only narrative digressions but also trick shots no camera could have possibly captured, such as the climactic vision of Cody and his Big Z riding a perfect tube into the sunset.
The sophomore feature from Sony Pictures Animation, "Surf's Up" looks and feels nothing like last year's "Open Season." Unlike that film, new item benefits from the cast's group recording sessions, with the in-person connection allowing actors like James Woods and Jon Heder to riff off one another and achieve the unscripted quality the conceit demands. 
Much effort was expended in getting the waves to look just right -- do they ever -- but pic's true innovation is the ability to approximate handheld camera work, allowing the directors to "discover" the action within each shot, just as they might in a live-action film. It also enables many a clever gag, notably an interview with lifeguard/love interest Lani (Zooey Deschanel) in which the camera pans away and zooms over her shoulder to find a disoriented baby penguin 
wading in over its head. 
Between its soundtrack of surfing standards and such appealing comic diversions as sidekick Chicken Joe (Heder) and rival Tank Evans (Diedrich Bader), pic keeps the energy and laughs constant.

The cash-cow flippered ones rise again, this time as yellow-tufted surfer dudes riding the waves of life off the coast of an island that looks like a cross between Hawaii  and Venice Beach . If you have to see another penguin blockbuster, you could do worse than this loose-limbed charmer written by, oh, a lot of jokesters and directed by a scant two, Ash Brannon  and Chris Buck . The gimmick is a reality-television premisejust how knowingly ironic do we want our kids to be before they even hit their tweens?but don't expect much fresh by way of plot, which is almost identical to that of Cars  and every bit as pregnant with wholesome messaging. Shia LaBeouf  voices Cody, a cocky but insecure Rockhopper penguin sorely in need of a father figure, who bonds with a washed-up old champion surfer (a delightful Jeff Bridges ) to train for a big surf-off, during which, it goes without saying, both learn to redefine the meaning of winning. As always, the energy comes from a manic supporting cast, of whom the funniest hands-down is James Woods 's Don King like surf promoter. Surf's Up  is copycat movie-making at its smoothest; its one imaginative innovationbillowing, silky, utterly sexy wavesis technical.
