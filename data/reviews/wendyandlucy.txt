Kelly Reichardt, who made the celebrated art road film Old Joy  (2006), has perfected a mode of rapturous minimalism. She's drawn to long, elliptical silences that speak more vibrantly than most movies' words, and to naturalistic camera angles that are cut together with a diamond sharpness. More than that, though, she's drawn to characters who are Dropouts Without a Cause. In Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy , Wendy (Michelle Williams), with her college-punk chop-shop haircut and mopey passivity, looks about 20, but in spirit she's a teenage runaway. On the road with her dog, Lucy, she's trying to get to Alaska in a rusty Honda on a budget of $600. But when the car breaks down in a small town in Oregon, we can see that she's going nowhere. Williams makes Wendy's total lack of affect luminously expressive. Like Will Oldham's cranky hippie in Old Joy , she's a lost-soul bohemian straggler in a world that no longer has context for such a person. (No context, that is, but oblivion.) Then she loses her dog! Wendy and Lucy  is like Lassie Come Home  directed by Antonioni. What's piercing about it, and also disturbing, is that Reichardt views the renunciation of society with something close to righteous purity  as a lefty romantic dream. A–

 Kelly Reichardt’s latest film, “Wendy and Lucy,” is 80 minutes long  —  it would fit inside Baz Luhrmann’s “Australia” twice, with room to spare — and does not contain a superfluous word or shot. Like “Old Joy” (2006), Ms. Reichardt’s modest and critically beloved second feature, “Wendy and Lucy” takes place mainly outdoors and registers the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest with unostentatious affection.  Instead of a musical soundtrack there is, for the most part, the sighing of the wind in the trees, the rumbling of freight trains and trucks and, sometimes, the absent-minded humming of Michelle Williams, who plays Wendy, a young woman drifting through Oregon and Washington on her way to Alaska.  The Northwestern setting might put you in mind of a story by Raymond Carver, whose clean-lined prose has something in common with Ms. Reichardt’s  reserved  and attentive shooting style. At first glance “Wendy and Lucy” looks so modest and prosaic that it seems like little more than an extended anecdote. A young woman pauses on her journey in a nondescript, weary town and encounters a run of bad luck, some of it brought about by her own bad decisions. Her car breaks down. She is arrested for shoplifting. Her dog goes missing.  But underneath this plain narrative surface   — or rather, resting on it the way a smooth stone rests in your palm  — is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society. Much as “Old Joy” turned a simple encounter between two longtime friends into a meditation on manhood and responsibility at a time of war and political confusion, so does “Wendy and Lucy” find, in one woman’s partly self-created hard luck, an intimation of more widespread hard times ahead.  This movie, which was shot  in August 2007   and made its way through various international festivals before arriving in Manhattan on Wednesday, seems uncannily well suited, in mood and manner, to this grim,  recessionary season. We may be seeing more like it, which I suppose would be a silver lining of sorts.  Ms. Reichardt, quietly establishing herself as an indispensable American filmmaker, explores some paradigmatic and contradictory native themes: the nature of solidarity in a culture of individualism; the tension between the lure of the open road and the longing for home; the competing demands of freedom and obligation.  But these lofty ideas  —  the same ones that animated Sean Penn’s “Into the Wild,” another movie about a young person’s trek toward Alaska  —  are grounded in an unyielding material reality, subject to the remorseless logic of the cash nexus. The most expressive, most heartbreaking moment in “Wendy and Lucy” involves a small sum of money changing hands, a gesture that encapsulates both Ms. Reichardt’s humanism and her unsentimental sense of economic reality. Whatever big dreams may be driving Wendy, her mind is necessarily focused on dollars and cents.  Ms. Williams, always a thoughtful, risk-taking actress (see everything from “Brokeback Mountain” to “I’m Not There” to “Synecdoche, New York”), here expunges all traces of movie star glamour, dressing in brown, knee-length cut-off shorts and a shapeless blue sweatshirt, and framing her delicate, slightly elfin face with  drab dark hair. Wendy’s manner is wary and diffident, and she calculates the dangers and possibilities of every encounter as if she were counting out pennies and dimes. She confronts a casually indifferent, intermittently compassionate world with an attitude that seems at once independent and helpless. Contemplating the final leg of her journey, which began in Indiana, Wendy is resilient and determined. Also lost, terrified and alone.  Except, that is, for Lucy, the yellow-brown mutt who is her companion, her responsibility and one of the few fixtures in Wendy’s mobile, minimal world. She has, in addition to her dog, an old Honda Accord, a money belt and a notebook in which she carefully records mileage and expenses. Her plan is to find work in a fish cannery, maybe in Ketchikan.  “I hear they need people up there,” she says. It’s a plain and practical statement that is also terribly sad  in its implications. Apart from Lucy, there may not be anyone else who needs or wants Wendy.  When Wendy calls her sister back in Indiana from a pay phone, the sister is curt and suspicious, expecting a request for money or assistance. Some of the strangers Wendy meets are a little more generous and encouraging, but always within the constraints of their own circumstances. A parking lot security guard (Walter Dalton) becomes the closest thing she has to a friend, but only after he has shooed her off the premises. A mechanic (Will Patton) knocks a few dollars off his towing fee and gives her the benefit of his automotive expertise, which may hurt more than it helps. With one exception  —  a young supermarket worker (John Robinson) who insists on strict enforcement of the store’s zero-tolerance policy toward shoplifters  —  people give Wendy a break when they can.  Ms. Williams and the filmmakers (Ms. Reichardt wrote the screenplay with Jon Raymond, from whose story “Train Choir” “Wendy and Lucy” is adapted) refrain from making too overt a play for our sympathy. Like the locals Wendy encounters, we don’t know enough about her to form a clear judgment, and we may subject her to our own doubts and prejudices.  I think the film’s neutral, nonexpository style encourages this, allowing the more conventional-minded among us to wonder if driving to Alaska is really the best idea, or to question the wisdom of other aspects of Wendy’s plan. Disapproving of Wendy’s choices  is one route to caring about her, which in turn leads to some difficult, uncomfortable questions. What would any of us do in her situation? What would we do if we met someone like her? How can we be sure we haven’t?  What will happen to her? The strength of this short, simple, perfect story of a young woman  and her dog is that this does not seem, by the end, to be an idle or trivial question. What happens to Wendy  —  and to Lucy  —  matters a lot, which is to say that “Wendy and Lucy,” for all its modesty, matters a lot too.  “Wendy and Lucy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some swearing, a little drug use and a brief implication of violence, but no nudity, sex or murder. The rating seems to reflect, above all, an impulse to protect children from learning that people are lonely and that life can be hard.

"Old Joy" helmer Kelly Reichardt plays to her strengths in "Wendy and Lucy," a modest yet deeply felt road movie about an idealistic young drifter, her faithful canine and the wide-open spaces of the Pacific Northwest. Once again working from a short story by "Old Joy" scribe Jon Raymond, Reichardt has fashioned another carefully observed, old-school indie portrait of regional American life that feels, in the best sense, as though it could have been made 25 years ago. Strong reviews and the superb central performance of Michelle Williams should help the film reach Reichardt's largest audience to date.
Living out of her car with barely two spare dimes to rub together, Indiana native Wendy (Williams) has, like the protagonist of last year's "Into the Wild," set out for Alaska, where she hopes to find gainful employment in a Ketchikan fish cannery. Things go awry, however, when her wreck of a car breaks down in Oregon and Wendy takes an ill-conceived stab at shoplifting dog food for her lone traveling companion, Lucy, whom attentive viewers will recognize as the same tan-colored retriever that accompanied the two male leads of "Old Joy" on their trek into the woods. (The dog is, in real life, Reichardt's own.)
Caught red-handed by an overly officious stock boy (well-played by "Elephant" star John Robinson), Wendy is arrested and slapped with a stiff fine. By the time she returns to the supermarket parking lot where she left Lucy tied up, the dog has disappeared.
Remainder of "Wendy and Lucy" concerns Wendy's efforts to fix her car and find her lost pet, which Reichardt dramatizes in a series of two-handers between Wendy and the various strangers, some kinder than others, who cross her path. They run the gamut, from the avuncular rent-a-cop (folk musician Walter Dalton) who lends Wendy the use of his cell phone, the straight-shooting auto mechanic (a delightfully eccentric Will Patton) with a jones for horse racing, and the vagrant (played by horror auteur Larry Fessenden, also one of pic's producers) who gives Wendy a deserved fright during a night she spends sleeping in a park. Collectively, they form a convincing panorama of the types one might encounter on such a journey, and it's a testament to Reichardt's skill with actors that even the smallest bit players give off the same lived-in, workaday feel.
Best of all is Williams, who doesn't say very much (no one in the film does), but who conveys an inexorable sense of longing for something more than life has given her. As with the rudderless, about-to-be-evicted Kurt character in "Old Joy," there is a sense that Wendy may be searching for a bygone, non-corporatized, "real" America that exists in ever-shorter supply, if at all. Also deserving mention is Lucy herself, who has few equals in the world of canine thesping, and was deservedly awarded Cannes' unofficial Palme Dog prize (from a jury that included film critics Derek Malcolm and Peter Bradshaw) for her performance.
Reichardt paints on such a miniature canvas that it seems as though, at any moment, the whole delicate house of cards could come undone -- if the pic were, for example, 81 minutes instead of 80. But like any seasoned traveler, Reichardt doesn't overstay her welcome and knows exactly when it's time to get back on the highway, building, as in "Old Joy," to a memorable ending suffused equally with possibility and melancholy.
Shot in mostly natural light by cinematographer Sam Levy, pic finds a faded but resonant beauty in gas-station restrooms, roadside phone booths and abandoned lots. Hovering above it all is the lyrical, ever-present gloom of the Oregon sky.

Modest but cosmic, Kelly Reichardt 's Wendy and Lucy —shown this past fall in the New York Film Festival —is a movie whose sad pixie heroine, Wendy (Michelle Williams ), already skating on thin ice, stumbles and, without a single support to brace herself, slides into America's lower depths. Introduced calling for her dog, Lucy, Wendy loses first her liberty (briefly), then Lucy (again), and finally, her car in the course of a dead-end road trip from deepest Indiana to the Alaskan frontier. Freedom's just another word . . .
This prescient tale—which, like her previous feature, Old Joy  (2006), Reichardt adapted from a story by Jon Raymond  and shot in the Pacific Northwest—is haunted by lonesome freight trains, hobo jungle solidarity, and the idea of redeeming empty beer bottles for gas money. Reichardt has described her movie as a post-Katrina story: Although it's never made obvious, Wendy apparently lost everything except Lucy in some previous catastrophe. Her beat-up Honda  dies as she's passing through a small Oregon town; waiting for an estimate on repairs she knows she'll never be able to afford, she drifts into a supermarket and, overcome by the spectacle of abundance, pockets a beef jerky and some dog food.
With its quiet camera and fondness for long shots, Wendy and Lucy  is so relentlessly understated that it comes as a shock to notice that the supermarket employee who grabs Wendy as she leaves is wearing a crucifix. Delivered with equal adamancy, his is the movie's key line: "If a person can't afford dog food, they shouldn't have a dog!" Wendy is booked, photographed, fingerprinted (twice, as it's a new machine that the cops are not totally familiar with), and fined $50. By the time she returns to the supermarket, Lucy is gone. Wendy walks around hopelessly calling for her—it's the worst day of her trip, if not her life.
By mid-movie, Reichardt has succeeded in defamiliarizing the whole notion of a dog—or, rather, making it synonymous with Wendy's  humanity, which is to say Wendy's inchoate yearning. At one point, she laboriously crafts a few signs to paste up, captioning Lucy's picture, "I'm lost!!!" as though the identification were total. Lucy, played by Reichardt's own dog, is a suitably charismatic mutt, and Wendy does encounter a few locals, notably a pitiless garage mechanic (Will Patton ) and a sympathetic security guard (Walter Dalton ) who charitably allows her to use his cell phone as her contact with the dog pound. But, save for Lucy, Wendy is alone; the movie is essentially a solo turn.
Trembling throughout on the verge of a tearful breakdown, but far too dignified to allow her character to choke up, Williams delivers a sensationally nuanced performance that, were it not so resolutely undramatic, would constitute an aria of stoical misery. Determined and self-contained in her dark-blue hoodie and cutdown pedal pushers, Wendy is a meticulous vagabond who keeps careful accounts of her meager expenses and manages to perform her ablutions every morning in a gas-station washroom. In the movie's bleakest, scariest moment, this grimy closet serves as her sanctuary.
Spare, actor-driven, socially aware, and open-ended, Wendy and Lucy  has obvious affinities to Italian neorealism. Reichardt has choreographed one of the most stripped-down existential quests since Vittorio De Sica  sent his unemployed worker wandering through the streets of Rome  searching for his purloined bicycle, and as heartbreaking a dog story as De Sica's Umberto D . But Wendy and Lucy  is also the most melancholy of American sagas.
If a person can't afford dog food, maybe they shouldn't oughta live. And if the filmmaker weren't so doggedly, unsentimentally prosaic, she might have called this ballad Pictures of the Gone World  or even "I Ain't Got No Home."
