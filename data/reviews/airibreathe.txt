 “The Air I Breathe” is an ingenious contraption that holds your attention for as long as it whirs and clicks like a mechanized Rubik’s Cube. After it’s over, however, you may find yourself scratching your head and wondering if there was any purpose to this sleek little gizmo.  The debut feature of Jieho Lee, a Korean-American director and screenwriter who, in the production notes, calls it a reflection of his “journey as an Asian-American” in a “bimodal world,” “The Air I Breathe” smothers in its own pretensions. Among other things, Mr. Lee declares, it is a film noir variation of “The Wizard of Oz” and an exploration of the theme of character as destiny. Whew! That’s an awful lot of concepts for one movie to juggle.  A hard-boiled allegory that consists of four vignettes whose characters bleed from one episode into the next, the film was inspired by a Chinese proverb that divides life into four categories: happiness, sorrow, pleasure and love. Three of the four vignettes feature an unnamed character, portrayed by a star, who represents one of the basic feelings. (But what about anger, an emotion that is plentiful in a movie with very little pleasure and little or no genuine happiness?)  What unfolds is a flashy example of the everything-is-connected mode of filmmaking embodied by movies like “Short Cuts,” “Crash” and “Babel,” but the connections in “The Air I Breathe” are paradoxical philosophic abstractions lacking geographic and cultural resonance. In the first episode, “Happiness,” Forest Whitaker — playing against type as a cowering milquetoast with a low-level banking job — overhears his colleagues planning to bet on a rigged horse race. Impulsively betting his life savings, he runs afoul of the scheme’s mastermind, Fingers (Andy Garcia), a gangster who mutilates debtors’ hands; his only hope of avoiding that fate is to rob a bank.  In “Pleasure,” Fingers’s soft-spoken hit man (Brendan Fraser) is instructed to take his boss’s hotheaded young nephew Tony (Emile Hirsch) out on the town and show him the ropes. While night crawling, the henchman, whose talent for seeing into the future is prized by his employer, has ominous flashes of how the evening will end; unexpectedly, his visions don’t pan out. Rid of a gift that has also been a curse, he experiences the same giddy sense of liberation as Mr. Whitaker’s reckless gambler and bank robber.  In “Sorrow,” Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Trista, a k a Sorrow, a terrorized pop star who becomes Fingers’s property after he buys her contract to settle a debt. Mr. Fraser’s character, a thug with a soft spot, impulsively hides her from Fingers and falls in love with her against his better judgment.  “Love,” the final episode, stars Kevin Bacon as a doctor who desperately tries to save the love of his life (Julie Delpy) — who happens to be his best friend’s wife — after she is bitten by a poisonous snake and requires a transfusion of a rare blood type. Circular in structure, the movie, to make its final connection, returns to Mr. Whitaker’s character in a delirious life-or-death moment.  The film’s most fully realized characters are Mr. Garcia’s cold-blooded killer (this is his strongest screen performance in years) and Mr. Hirsch’s gun- and girl-crazy nephew. Because Fingers pulls the plot strings in all four vignettes, “The Air I Breathe” ultimately registers as a gangster movie with delusions of grandeur.  “The Air I Breathe” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual situations and intense violence.

In tyro helmer Jieho Lee's morosely pretentious multistrander, "The Air I Breathe," Forest Whitaker, Brendan Fraser, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Kevin Bacon portray, respectively, Happiness, Pleasure, Sorrow and Love -- the four pillars of life, according to an ancient Chinese proverb. But given the pic's nihilism, overall air of desperation and sped-up, fragmented HD effects, viewers would be hard-pressed to tell these emotions apart without the chapter headings. Stellar thesps gamely strive to elevate the one-note material, but gravity ultimately defeats them in this relentless downer. Name cast insures distribution, but it is unclear where this darkhorse will run. 
Lee and co-scripter Bob DeRosa's loosely interwoven plots include some characters that mesh intimately while others touch tangentially, most of them clustered around Fingers (Andy Garcia), a menacing, soft-spoken moneylender legendary for exacting his pound of flesh in digits. 
The curtain-raiser stars a bespectacled Whitaker, feeling suffocated by the cubicled soullessness of his stockbroker's job. Overhearing colleagues discussing a surefire winner at the track, he follows them to a shadowy establishment owned by Fingers, in which Whitaker loses far more money than he has. To recoup, he undertakes a radically desperate act, ending with nothing more to lose and a fleeting moment of perfect liberation. 
Whitaker proves convincing as the fearful functionary trapped in his own squirrel cage, and his short-lived epiphany (later reprised as it intersects with other characters' destinies) is truly a thing of beauty. For most of his 25 minutes of screentime, though, he simply sweats and looks frantic -- not much of a stretch after incarnating the mercurial Idi Amin in "The Last King of Scotland."
Pleasure, as paradoxically essayed by a brooding Brendan Fraser, pops up next. He can see the future in disconnected flashes, but cannot change it. Only after his preternatural vision deserts him can he fall in love (though not change expression), unfortunately with a singer (Geller) whose contract Fingers has bought in a bid to go legit. 
In this segment, Fingers' young, cocky, and splendidly despicable nephew Tony (Emile Hirsch), whom Pleasure is forced to babysit, brings a much-needed note of humor to the angst-ridden proceedings. The action in this episode at times takes on the slapstick grace of an Asian noir actioner, indicating for all-too-brief moments a more vibrant, tonally flexible film. Afterward, however, all tonal variation in the pic dies an increasingly melodramatic death. 
Geller's Sorrow, like all the other characters' designated emotions, smacks of desperation as she struggles to hold onto Pleasure while evading Fingers' grasp. But her desperateness pales before the insane anxiety of Love (Kevin Bacon) as he searches for a cure for the great (but unrequited) love of his life (Julie Delpy), his best friend's wife, who has been bitten by a snake.
Though Whitaker & Co. are able to hold the script's allegorical absurdities at bay for sustained stretches, the pileup of dour "Pilgrim's Progress"-like moral vignettes, devoid of relevance or originality and filmed in a surprisingly characterless Mexico City posing as metropolitan America, strains both credulity and patience. With Happiness, Love and Pleasure like this, who needs depression?

Ah, January, hallowed dustbin for projects half-baked, too-cooked, or both, as in the case of this overstuffed noir actioner from Korean-American newcomer Jieho Lee . Nothing if not ambitious, this muddled omnibus of zealously interlocked parables of love and deathinspired by an ancient Chinese proverbsuffers from a surfeit of noir influences, glum existential aperçus, and bodies going thwack  on windshields. Lee and co-writer Bob DeRosa  show more taste than respect for their top-drawer actors: Forest Whitaker , grimacing haplessly as a nerdy banker risking all for naught; Brendan Fraser , trying to look world-weary while not collapsing into giggles as a woolly-capped hit man burdened with humanitarian impulses, a sad past, and an unhelpful ability to see the future; Sarah Michelle Gellar , a troubled pop star trapped under the thumb of gangster Andy Garcia ; and Kevin Bacon  in saint mode, risking all for the love of an unaccountably droopy Julie Delpy . The destiny-versus- responsibility hand-wringing is Philosophy 101, the camera angles straight out of film school, and the pacing strictly music-video. Plus, the ta-da! twist ending is foreshadowed roughly 20 minutes into the action, for those still interested. Lee has talent, intelligence, and something to sayif only someone had thought to stop him from packing in every film he ever wanted to make under one roof.
