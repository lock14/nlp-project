District 9
 is a wrenching, riveting, occasionally violent, often heartbreaking, and, above all, socially conscious science-fiction film featuring seamlessly integrated CGI effects alongside flat-out perfect performances from its flesh-and-blood actors, and, best of all, it's a love story. In short, it's the most original and entertaining sci-fi film in ages. Produced by Peter Jackson and directed by Canada-based filmmaker Blomkamp, much of District 9
 is shot in a documentary, "you are here" style, and where you are is Johannesburg (Blomkamp is is a native of South Africa and grew up in Jo'Burg), a densely populated metropolis over which hovers a dead alien spacecraft of immense proportions. It's been hanging there, like some sort of bleak cosmic judgment, for going on 20 years as the film opens, and its crew and occupants � thousands of them � have long ago been removed from their vessel and packed into the sprawling, squalid refugee camp of the title. (Blomkamp never once mentions the word "apartheid," but the reference to South Africa's divided past, not to mention that of many other nations, our own included, is there for those who choose to see it.) District 9
 begins on the eve of a mass, forced resettlement of these alien refugees to an area far from Jo'Burg's unsettled, xenophobic citizenry. Overseen by the ominously privatized military/corporate entity Multinational United, the mass eviction of the aliens � derisively referred to as "prawns" by the human population due to their their insectile, bipedal/crustacean appearance � is headed up by a middle-managment stooge, Wikus Van De Merwe (Copley, in a flat-out amazing acting debut), a fidgety, seemingly fatuous but ultimately capable everyman who at first can't believe the good luck of his sudden promotion and then, as events quickly spin way, way out of control, realizes he's little more than a pawn in a horrific (but all the more believable for it) multinational/intergalactic experiment. The aliens, virtually all of them, are played by actor Cope, who was shot live on set and had his alien likeness rotoscoped around him (itself an amazing special-effects achievement). I'm hesitant to say any more about the specifics of District 9
 � the script was co-written by Blomkamp with Terri Tatchell  � because so many of this remarkable film's terrible wonders are best experienced as they unfold in front of you. Suffice it to say that Blomkamp and his entire cast and crew have created an instant genre classic that transcends the self-limiting ghetto implied by the term "science fiction" and instead, like precursors such as Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still
, engages not only the mind but the heart as well. It's magnificent.

The last time I felt the sort of outrageously kinetic action-movie high "District 9" delivers, it was 1981 and George Miller, Mel Gibson, and "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior" had just come roaring out of Australia.
Like that film, "District 9" is a scrappy day-after-tomorrow epic; like it, too, it was made off the Hollywood grid, directed and co-written by the South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp and shot in Johannesburg and the New Zealand studios of producer Peter Jackson. It's an outsider blockbuster, a juicy, bravura piece of moviemaking pulp, and its hellacious style almost -- but not quite -- disguises its shortcomings as a story.
There are no stars other than the concept. "District 9" asks us to imagine that a massive interstellar spaceship might show up one day and park itself over not New York or Washington, D.C., but Jo'burg. The ship's inhabitants are a click-clacking cross between humans, insects, and crustaceans; quickly dubbed "prawns" by wary earthlings,  they're shunted off to the festering shantytown of the title. Twenty years pass, during which crime and squalor soar in District 9 while humans outside practice a sort of alien apartheid.
That metaphor stings, and stings hard; if only the movie followed through on it. "District 9" is content to be a loud, smart, frenetic action movie with just a hint of interspecies bonding a la "The Defiant Ones." Wikus (Sharlto Copley), a high-level functionary with MNU Corp., is in charge of relocating the aliens to a concentration camp in the desert; a well-meaning wimp and smug anti-prawn racist, he's also the son-in-law of the company's steely CEO (Louis Minnaar).
During the evictions, Wikus gets a face full of a mysterious liquid and -- well, let's just say he starts to go through some heavy changes. Suddenly, he's a man wanted by the government, his company, his company's secret experimental lab, a strutting sadist of an army colonel (David James), and by the Nigerian crime boss (Eugene Khumbanyiwa) who runs District 9's black market economy and wants to shore up his mojo by eating a crucial part of Wikus's anatomy.
The hero's only ally turns out to be "Christopher Johnson," a towering alien who seems smarter than your average prawn and who, in fact, turns out to hold the key to the entire 20-year mystery. Christopher has a young son, too -- a figure of adorable CGI insect resourcefulness -- but the movie doesn't exactly stop to smell the roses. Once "District 9" shifts into gear, each sequence is a white-knuckle action set piece designed to top the one immediately preceding it. Bullets fly, cars detonate, the land-speed record for cursing is broken early and often. After a certain point, Wikus discovers he has the rare human ability to control the alien's biotech weaponry, and the movie really
 takes off the gloves.
This is all visualized with wit, verve, and the narrow worldview of a very well-produced video game. (Blomkamp was originally supposed to make the big screen version of the hit game Halo; this film, adapted from an earlier short, is his consolation prize for losing the gig.) "District 9" is filmed from a confusing multiplicity of fictional sources -- we see the action via security cameras, cable-news footage, a MNU corporate documentary, and Blomkamp's own omniscient narrative eye. None of these sits still for a second; if you have trouble with "Bourne Identity" shaky-cam syndrome, be aware that all of "District 9" has been filmed in seizure-cam.
It's an affectation that wears out its welcome, as do other aspects of the movie (the coincidences that bring Wikus and Christopher together not once but twice, or the mysterious liquid that serves whatever purpose the screenplay needs at any given moment). There's ultimately less to "District 9" than meets the eye, even if an awful lot meets the eye. The details, more than anything, are what stick with you: the mothership that hangs over the city like an immense abandoned car, the aliens' addiction to canned cat food, the way the film co-opts the language of one of the 20th century's most virulently racist forms of government.
To what end, though? That there was actually a District 6 in Cape Town that served the same function for human beings as this movie's District 9 does for computer-generated shrimp is a tragedy Blomkamp doesn't get remotely close to. Despite the bad-boy brainiac production values and the film's relentless pace, there's no poetry to "District 9" -- no vision behind the vision -- until the very final shot. That last image is haunting, certainly, and it makes me want to see what this filmmaker does next, but it's also too little too late.

Were they not tentacled, claw-handed creatures from another planet with bodies like steel-plated shellfish, the ghetto-dwelling underclass in the madly original, cheekily   political, altogether exciting District 9  would look much like any refugee population: They miss home, they're discriminated against, and they're driven by overcrowding, squalor, and hunger to acts of violence that make the local populace hate them even more and wish them good riddance. And that's exactly the point of this great mind-stretcher of a sci-fi actioner  surely the first flying-saucer-and-mayhem movie in which aliens touch down on Earth by way of Johannesburg, rather than a more glamorous port of call. It's no accident that the aliens' massive spacecraft stalls out over South Africa, uniting the citizenry (with its own   infamous history of us-against-them racism) against a population humans of every color can despise. South African-born director Neill Blomkamp knows the history of his homeland.
The political resonance is sharp. But the movie wears its allegorical flourishes lightly.  A thinking person's sci-fi movie from an inventive director of shorts and TV commercials, District 9  revels in the fun of mashing up  narrative styles, with much of the footage presented as if shot by a documentary team on the scene. (Cloverfield  made merry with the same vérité conceit.) The action  and there's plenty  really takes off when a big corporation (any resemblance to Halliburton is...your call) is hired to move the creatures from the slumlike township in which they have been segregated to something like a concentration camp, something meaner and farther away.
Not in my backyard!  cry the good people of Jo'burg about the crustacean-shaped species derogatorily called Prawns. A rule-bound company man named Wikus (played by Sharlto Copley in a killer feature-acting debut) is  selected to implement the massive relocation. Understandably, nothing runs smoothly  especially once Wikus starts poking around the shanty home of a Prawn who's a good dad to his shrimp of a kid  and, it turns out, a powerful scientist with a homegrown workshop. Viva the Prawn revolution! What begins with ''news'' footage out of South Africa ends with headline news here at home: District 9 proves that there's intelligent alien life in the movie universe this summer.


 For decades — at least since Orson Welles scared the daylights out of radio listeners with “War of the Worlds” back in 1938 — the public has embraced the terrifying prospect of alien invasion. But what if, notwithstanding the occasional humanist fable like “E.T.,” all those movies and television programs have been inculcating a potentially toxic form of interplanetary prejudice?  “District 9,” a smart, swift new film from the South African director Neill Blomkamp (who now lives in Canada and who wrote the screenplay with Terri Tatchell), raises such a possibility in part by inverting an axiomatic question of the U.F.O. genre. In place of the usual mystery — what are they going to do to us? — this movie poses a different kind of hypothetical puzzle. What would we do to them? The answer, derived from intimate knowledge of how we have treated one another for centuries, is not pretty.  A busy opening flurry of mock-news images and talking-head documentary chin scratching fills in a grim, disturbingly plausible scenario. Back in the 1980s a giant spacecraft stalled in the skies over Johannesburg. On board were a large number of starving and disoriented creatures, who were rescued and placed in a temporary refugee camp in the part of the city that gives the film its title. Over the next 20 years the settlement became a teeming shantytown like so many others in the developing world, with the relatively minor distinction of being home to tall, skinny bipeds with insectlike faces and bodies that seem to combine biological and mechanical features. Though there is evidence that those extraterrestrials — known in derogatory slang as prawns because of their vaguely crustacean appearance — represent an advanced civilization, their lives on Earth are marked by squalor and dysfunction. And they are viewed by South Africans of all races with suspicion, occasional pity and xenophobic hostility.  The South African setting hones the allegory of “District 9” to a sharp topical point. That country’s history of apartheid and its continuing social problems are never mentioned, but they hardly need to be. And the film’s implications extend far beyond the boundaries of a particular nation, which is taken as more or less representative of the planet as a whole.  No group, from the mostly white soldiers and bureaucrats who corral and abuse the prawns to the Nigerian gangsters who prey upon the aliens and exploit their addiction to cat food, is innocent. And casual bigotry turns out to be the least of the problems facing the exiles. As it progresses, “District 9” uncovers a horrific program of medical experimentation yoked to a near-genocidal agenda of corporate greed. A company called M.N.U. (it stands, none too subtly, for Multi-National United) has taken over administration of the prawn population, which means resettling the aliens in a remote enclosure reminiscent of the Bantustans of the apartheid era.  The M.N.U. executive charged with carrying out this program is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a nervous nebbish whose father-in-law (Louis Minnaar) is the head of the company. Cowardly, preening and hopeless at projecting authority, Wikus is the kind of guy who gives nepotism a bad name. It says a lot about Mr. Blomkamp’s sense of humor, and about his view of his own species, that this pathetic little paper pusher is his chosen agent of mankind’s potential moral redemption.  But I’m getting ahead of the story, and perhaps overselling the allegory. Not that the metaphorical resonances of “District 9” aren’t rich and thought provoking. But the filmmakers don’t draw them out with a heavy, didactic hand. Instead, in the best B-movie tradition, they embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn).  The early pseudo-documentary conceit, which uses footage that pretends to have been harvested from news choppers and security cameras as well as some by the unseen crew accompanying Wikus on his tour of the prawn camp, fades away after a while. The academic authorities do too, having served the dual functions of providing narrative exposition and demonstrating the high-minded uselessness of official liberal discourse.  Once a terrible accident befalls Wikus, we are at his side and under his skin, and “District 9” subtly shifts from speculative science fiction to zombie bio-horror and then, less subtly, turns into an escape-action-chase movie full of explosions, gunplay and vehicular mayhem.  In the midst of it all you almost take for granted the carefully rendered details of the setting, the tightness of the editing and the inventiveness of the special effects. Not the least of these are the aliens themselves, who are made expressive and soulful without quite being anthropomorphized. (Their whirring, clicking speech, partly understood by Wikus and others who work with the creatures, is translated for the rest of us via subtitles.)  One in particular, named Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), becomes Wikus’s protector and ward, and their relationship turns “District 9,” in its final act, into an intergalactic buddy picture, with some intriguing (and also possibly disappointing) sequel opportunities left open.  At its core the film tells the story — hardly an unfamiliar one in the literature of modern South Africa — of how a member of the socially dominant group becomes aware of the injustice that keeps him in his place and the others, his designated inferiors, in theirs. The cost he pays for this knowledge is severe, as it must be, given the dreadful contours of the system. But if the film’s view of the world is bleak, it is not quite nihilistic. It suggests that sometimes the only way to become fully human is to be completely alienated.  “District 9” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense violence and violent swearing in the languages of two planets.

Upon the ashes of his aborted "Halo" vidgame adaptation, producer Peter Jackson has erected "District 9," an enjoyably disgusting sci-fier set in and around a rubble-strewn war zone where extraterrestrial refugees have taken up indefinite residence. Better conceived and executed than one might expect from a low-budget rebound project, this grossly engrossing speculative fiction bears Jackson's blood-splattered fingerprints but also heralds first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp as a nimble talent to watch. A viral campaign reminiscent of the more gimmicky "Cloverfield" should draw hefty hordes initially, but positive notices and buzz will be required to sustain a B.O. invasion.
Shot and set in Blomkamp's native South Africa, "District 9" imagines a present-day scenario in which humans and aliens are forced into an uneasy co-existence and, predictably, bring out the violent worst in each other. As scripted by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, the result reps a remarkably cohesive hybrid of creature feature and satirical mockumentary that elaborates on the helmer's 2005 short "Alive in Jo'burg," borrows plot points from 1988's "Alien Nation" and takes its emotional cues from "E.T."
The film's faux-verite visual style, however, is very much a thing of the present, blending handheld HD camerawork with ersatz news coverage (complete with CNN-style text scrolls) and talking heads, plus actual archival footage from local news agencies, so as to suggest an urgent dispatch from the front lines of an interspecies war.
The introductory 15 minutes are swiftly paced, making modest demands on the viewer to keep up with the jiggly aesthetic and the particulars of the premise: Twenty years ago, an enormous spaceship came to rest over Johannesburg, now a sun-scorched urban wasteland. Since then, the ship's inhabitants, referred to as "prawns" -- four-legged insectoid beings that walk upright, secrete black goo and speak in subtitled grunts and gurgles -- have been moved into the titular ghetto and placed under the control of Multi-National United, a private corporation bent on cracking the secrets of the aliens' ultra-powerful weapons.
Into the fray strides Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an annoyingly chipper, boastful MNU operative overseeing the transfer of aliens to the more remote District 10. Blithely navigating cameramen through the creatures' filthy shack homes, Wikus accidentally comes into contact with an icky substance that, within hours, begins altering his DNA.
In the script's most ingenious gambit, the contaminated Wikus is suddenly coveted by MNU, as well as by a gang of Nigerian thugs and witch doctors who won't win the filmmakers any prizes for ethnic sensitivity. Forced into hiding, Wikus teams up with an intelligent, green-skinned prawn, Christopher Johnson (voiced by Jason Cope), and his kid, Little CJ, who's kinda cute in a hideous sort of way; together, they seek a way to reverse Wikus' alien metamorphosis and help the refugees return to their planet.
Rather than plunge the viewer immediately into unrelieved carnage and chaos, the film opens on a note of anxious uncertainty and tense humor as it probes the varying degrees of hostility in human-prawn relations. Though compelling throughout, "District 9" never becomes outright terrifying, largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty, xenophobic species.
That said, he doesn't skimp on the viscera; it's hard to watch the grisly climactic battle, with its parade of high-tech weaponry and exploding body parts, and not think of the horror cheapies Jackson was making pre-"Lord of the Rings." The pic does take a sentimental turn toward the end, with an excess of alien reaction shots that feel at odds with the much more authentic passion Blomkamp lovingly invests in his grotesque setpieces.
Copley makes the most of the only substantial human role -- and not an especially likable one at that -- with a twitchy, blustery, shifty-eyed performance of ferretlike intensity. Dropping F-bombs in Afrikaans-accented English, he ably conveys not only Wikus' physical transformation but also his mental deterioration and subsequent moral awakening; it's to the pic's credit that when Wikus is shown on the battlefield, his half-mutated body covered with festering wounds and alien protrusions, he has never seemed more profoundly human.
Lensed primarily on the Red-One camera, the film looks and sounds terrific, its seeming improvisation masking the obviously exhaustive planning required in all departments. The interactions between the aliens (a combo of f/x and old-fashioned prosthetics) and the humans are handled as confidently as anything in the "Transformers" movies and are arguably more impressive for d.p. Trent Opaloch's off-the-cuff shooting style. Clinton Shorter's percussive score is effective but at times over-reliant on the loud wailing/crooning that has become a too-easy signifier of Africa and other foreign locales.

The aliens have been with us for 20 years already at the start of South African director Neill Blomkamp 's fast and furiously inventive District 9 , their huddled masses long ago extracted from their broken-down mothership and deposited in the titular housing slum on the outskirts of Johannesburg . Unlike the space invaders of most science fiction, these six-foot-tall E.T.s (pejoratively nicknamed "prawns," but more closely resembling the love child of a cockroach and the Creature From the Black Lagoon) come neither in peace nor in malice. They are, we are told, the worker bees of whatever galaxy they hail from, accustomed to following orders rather than giving them. And so they find themselves dazed and confused in their new home, while their flying saucer still hovers inertly over the skyline, as if waiting for a jump-start from an intergalactic AAA.
A high-end commercials director making his feature debut, Blomkamp (who also co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell ) milks his ostensibly fantastic scenario for all its allegorical worth. With its corrugated tin sheds and abject poverty, District 9 stands in for the township settlements where more than a million South African blacks still live without basic human services, two decades after the end of apartheid. But you don't have to squint too hard to also see the itinerant community as an all-purpose analog for the ghettos of Nazi Germany , America's inner cities, and all of those other places where unwanted, powerless peoples have been herded off far from the backyards of the ruling class. Blomkamp's touch, however, is anything but heavy, and for most of its run time, District 9  whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences: Invasion of the Body Snatchers , Dawn of the Dead , and Starship Troopers .
As the movie begins, a wave of violent prawn unrest—not unlike the one that rocked South Africa 's real townships only last month—has prompted the good people of Jo'burg to crave even greater distance from their sub-human neighbors, and a forced relocation of all alien residents to a Guantánamo -style tent city known as District 10 has become law. Enter Multi-National United, a smarmy private military contractor that places the relocation in the hands of one Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley ), a not very bright corporate lackey who also happens to be married to the boss's daughter. While MNU tries to decipher the aliens' advanced weapons technology (leading to one disturbing scene set in a research lab that Dr. Mengele would have loved), affable but clueless Wikus yearns to surmount claims of nepotism. Then everything goes haywire, with the oppressor getting a crash course in what it feels like to be the oppressed.
District 9  is never better than in its first 45 minutes, as Blomkamp maps out the film's social and economic realities via a grab bag of news reports, corporate videos, and CCTV cameras. The aliens, we learn, can understand English, but speak in their own indigenous language of guttural grunts and clicks (making this one of two major releases this month, along with Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds , to predominantly feature subtitled dialogue). Meanwhile, inside the boundaries of District 9 itself, a cadre of Nigerian gangsters exploit the prawns by charging them exorbitant prices for black-market goods (including the canned cat food the aliens regard as a culinary delicacy). Eventually, Blomkamp adds some straight dramatic scenes to the mix, around the point that the movie itself evolves into a somewhat more straightforward pursuit thriller—albeit one in which Wikus is both Dr. Richard Kimble  and the one-armed man. Taking refuge in the very community he is supposed to be uprooting, the middle manager finds himself forming a tentative alliance with a science-geek prawn known by the anglicized name of Christopher Johnson  (played by actor Jason Cope , with the aid of a few CGI enhancements), who may be his people's only hope for a better life and who turns out to be the most humane, compassionate character in the District 9  landscape.
Even in the movie's most conventional stretches, Blomkamp puts things across with terrific verve, using action and computer effects to enhance rather than trump story and character. District 9  was produced, with help from The Lord of the Rings  honcho Peter Jackson , for all of $30 million (about the average advertising budget on a standard Hollywood  production) after plans for Jackson and Blomkamp to collaborate on a much larger-scale adaptation of the Halo video-game franchise fell apart, and the entire project seems carried along by the scrappy energy of a bright, young filmmaker working far away from Hollywood's prying, homogenizing eyes. Probably only with an advocate like Jackson to run interference for him could Blomkamp have gotten away with a lot of it—the Johannesburg setting (aren't alien invasions only supposed to happen in New York, L.A., or D.C.?), the dweeby hero, the thick South African accents, the subtitles. I can't wait to see what Blomkamp does next, and I very much hope he gets even less money to do it.
