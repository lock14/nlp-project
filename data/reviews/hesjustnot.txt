Beware the chick flick that pretends to tell it like it is; because it wants to send you home happy, it will eventually have to lie. "He's Just Not That Into You" is a fictional romantic comedy based on a nonfictional advice bestseller subtitled "The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys," and, like the book, it's aimed at the kind of single woman who stares at her silent answering machine with geometrically progressing anxiety. That title implores: Ladies, drop the excuses, gather up your self-esteem, and move on.
The film version, a pleasurable if empty-headed all-star roundelay, stays true to that sentiment until it doesn't, at which point smarter audience members will mutter "Burned again" while the gullible will coo in delight and tell all their friends. The movie plays like "Love Actually" with half the brains and none of the nerve.
Still, "He's Just Not That Into You" is good comfort food for most of its running time, thanks to a cast of attractive, unchallenging pros and Ken Kwapis's smooth direction. The script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein settles into the yuppie environs of Baltimore - nice to see someone other than John Waters and the "Homicide" crew there - and introduces us to eight or nine rotating characters.
Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) are the young marrieds, pouring money and energy into a brownstone rehab even as he's tempted by a comely yoga instructor named Anna (Scarlett Johansson at her most lusciously bimbotic). Anna, in turn, is yearned for by realtor Conor (Kevin Connolly), a nice-guy-friend-with-not-enough-benefits; Drew Barrymore plays Anna's self-absorbed boho pal Mary, constantly offering lousy advice. (If it's any comfort, her outfits are worse.)
Over in this corner are Beth (Jennifer Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck), the latter content in their seven-year relationship, the former raging passive-aggressively for an engagement ring that never comes. And then there's Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), the needy singleton for whom the film's title is intended. She works herself into a lather whenever any cute guy at a bar doesn't call her in 24 hours; the idea that he might see she's desperate for any man, as opposed to this man, doesn't occur to her or the movie.
Gigi gets a mentor, of sorts, in Alex (Justin Long), a bar manager who coaches her in "what guys really think" with brutal comic sadism. These are funny scenes: A date tells Gigi he's "leaving town on business for a few weeks," she ducks into his bathroom to phone Alex for advice, he asks where the date says he's going, she answers "Pittsburgh," he says "Run!"
"He's Just Not That Into You" offers a world in which young and pretty people have endless technology for communication at their disposal but still have no clue how to talk to each other. That's a cutting observation, but the movie's content to be a bread knife.
Goodwin, a capable and chameleonic actress, is stuck playing a ninny, and Long's Alex is good company until the screenplay insists he start behaving in ways that make no sense. The triangle between the married couple and Johansson's blithe interloper is strained but more interesting to watch, especially when Connelly sublimates her anger over the husband's infidelity by channeling it into a towering fury at his secret smoking.
Surprisingly, Affleck and Aniston create the two most appealing people in the movie - both actors let their maturity show in unexpected ways - but "He's Just Not That Into You" isn't sure what to do with them until the end, when it caves in to the audience's presumed desire for closure and corn.
That would be fine if it didn't feel like a surrender on the filmmakers' own mild commercial terms. Kwapis and his writers stall the inevitable, dogging each storyline until the movie turns long and then overlong, but they know that for this movie to succeed - for the singletons to not torch the theater in a mob - it has to remember it's a movie, which means it's a fantasy, which means it has to end not just happily but nicely.
It's not often you see a film sell out a paperback advice book, but that's what happens here. "He's Just Not That Into You" serves up a big bowl of Chunky Monkey that says: You know what? He really is.


The only thing more fun than old John Hughes movies is talking about them. In the breezily synthetic love roundelay He's Just Not That Into You , there's a fun moment when Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a breathtakingly insecure single, tries to figure out her relationship with Alex (Justin Long), a lady-killer of a restaurant manager who has been giving her tips on how to land a guy. Suddenly, she realizes that Hughes' 1987 opus Some Kind of Wonderful  (always underrated in my book) can explain, you know, everything. Gigi, as she tells it, is the equivalent of the Eric Stoltz character, whereas Alex is like Mary Stuart Masterson's Watts  the loyal, advice-giving friend who starts to want something more than friendship. For a second, I grinned at the knowing (and gender-flipped) use of a so-cheesy-it's hip teen-movie reference. But then I realized why Gigi and Alex really do  seem like characters out of Some Kind of Wonderful . There's nothing to their relationship  nothing at all  but the thin, Hughesian predicament the two happen to be in. It feels like something out of an old teen comedy because the screenwriters, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, have cobbled together every situation in their film out of familiar, derivative parts: a chick flick here, a Cosmo article there, a Sex and the City  confessional voice-over everywhere. And the director, Ken Kwapis, stages it all with the prefab texture of a TV commercial. He's Just Not That Into You  isn't quite an ensemble romance  it's more like the diagram for an ensemble romance. Just add water and Kleenex.
Gigi, who narrates the film, is a walking whirlwind of desperation, a doormat Carrie Bradshaw. She’s the sort of girl who annoys guys because she’s just too nervous and eager, and Goodwin (the youngest wife in Big Love ) makes her frantic in such a perky, one-note way that there's no shading to her performance, and no letup either. Her Gigi is like the young Woody Allen played by Rachael Ray  she whines with a megaphone. As Alex, Justin Long is supposed to be a snake with a heart of gold, but Long runs the gamut of expression from a leer to a sneer, and I never bought that this guy would be friends with Gigi, let alone something more.
The other couply complications are a bit more believable, if just as cookiecutter. Ben Affleck  and Jennifer Aniston  are sweet together as a devoted couple who aren't married because he ''doesn't believe in marriage'' (it's odd to see Affleck voice this dated hippie sentiment). Their opposite number: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connelly  as a married pair who've so lost their spark that she's hotter for renovating their home than she is for him. And so he strays, jumping into bed with a curvaceous yoga instructor (Scarlett Johansson ), who's caught up in her own Some Kind of Wonderful  conundrum. Her friend-or-is-it-somethingmore? is played by Kevin Connolly, who brings his clean-cut boyish moxie from Entourage   though I wish, as I do watching that HBO show, that Connolly were a little less  boyish. He's like Opie trying to be cool. Johansson, working her lips, looks more than ever like an Andy Warhol Marilyn portrait, and the film needs her husky sensuality, even if it fails to give her a second dimension. The most relaxed, and amusing, performer is Drew Barrymore  as a lonelyheart frustrated  convincingly  by the technology of modern dating, which she correctly nails as a series of walls people hide behind. She makes that complaint a cry from the heart.
Like the nonfiction self-help-as-chick-lit book that inspired it, He's Just Not That Into You  lifts its title from a phrase made famous when it was uttered on Sex and the City . Women, the movie says, can find a hundred ways to deny a simple, stark truth: that if a man doesn't act  interested, it's probably because he's not  interested. That's a prickly, resonant theme  the way that many women, in essence, will project their tendency to play hard to get onto the men they’re pursuing. The film, though, suggests a more reductive reading: It says women are drama queens, with a gene for deluding themselves. It says that they need to start being more sane about love. But He's Just Not That Into You  turns romantic sanity into something so sanitized that it starts to make delusion look good.

 The good Dr. Freud once asked, what do women want? To judge by the recent crop of what are often sneeringly referred to as chick flicks, today’s woman wants designer threads, extravagant weddings and a generous helping of public humiliation served up with  laughs, most at her expense. Where have you gone, Thelma and Louise? Oh, right: those gun-toting runaway heroines played by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who wore old blue jeans and confidently put the moves on the men in their lives in Ridley Scott’s 1991  outlaw female fantasy, drove off the cliff at their big finish. You have been missed, ladies.  I bring up Mr. Scott’s film because whenever faced with another puerile movie ostensibly about women, I play a little game called What Would Thelma and Louise Do? Consider, for instance, the scene from “He’s Just Not That Into You” in which the perennially disappointed Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) says goodnight to her first-time, last-time date, a real estate agent, Conor (Kevin Connolly). As she clings to his every diffident word, her wide eyes shining and smile as fixed as that of the Joker, Gigi comes across less like the bubbly young thing she’s meant to be and pretty much like a crazy person. She walks off and immediately calls a friend to say that the date went well. A few yards away, Conor rings another woman.  What would Thelma  have done? Well, she might have bedded Conor with gusto (and no marriage plans), as she does a hitchhiker with miles of muscle played by the young Brad Pitt. (Her greatest lament: he rips her off.) And Louise? Given that her lover is played by the gruff and grown-up Michael Madsen, I like to think she wouldn’t even have bothered with Conor. (That, or shot him.) Adult women like Louise might pull a Mrs. Robinson on special occasions, though not if there’s a man like Mr. Madsen steaming up the room. But adults have become something of an endangered species in big studio movies, particularly in romantic comedies, where female desire now largely seems reserved for shoes, wedding bells and babies.  These days Hollywood is taking its storybook cues from that old children’s ditty:  Mary and Johnny sitting in a tree  K-I-S-S-I-N-G  First comes love, then comes marriage  Then comes Mary with a baby carriage  Such is more or less the reductive case in “He’s Just Not That Into You,” which is based on an obnoxious so-called advice book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, which in turn took its inspiration from the HBO series “Sex and the City.” The book’s title refers to an episode in which Carrie’s man du jour, Berger, bluntly puts Miranda straight about a guy she’s dating. Miranda thinks she’s receiving mixed messages, but men are just not that complicated, Berger says. The guy simply isn’t interested.  The movie “He’s Just Not That Into You,” directed by Ken Kwapis and written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, takes this bit from a 30-minute show and turns it into an overextended 2  hours and 12 minutes. Mostly it does this by turning Gigi simultaneously into a joke (by playing her desperation for laughs) and a victim (by playing her desperation for tears). It’s a grotesque representation of female desire, one that the appealing Ms. Goodwin can’t save from caricature. It says something about the romantic comedies coming out of Hollywood that the character Ms. Goodwin plays on the HBO series “Big Love,” the youngest wife in a polygamous Mormon marriage, is treated with far more dignity than Gigi.  Despite this, there are a few nice moments, most courtesy of Jennifer Connelly, as the wife, and Scarlett Johansson, as the mistress, of an understandably gaga lawyer, Ben (Bradley Cooper), who doesn’t deserve either of them. Usually tightly wound even when she’s meant to be falling apart, Ms. Connelly cuts loose and goes (relatively) dark with her character, Janine. When she learns of her husband’s infidelity, you can see the storm — the shock, the hurt, the confusion — gathering in her face. Even better, you have no idea if Janine will break into pieces. Life has knocked her sideways, and Ms. Connolly keeps the character there for a while, inserting a bit of the unknown into the otherwise predictable proceedings.  Ms. Johansson’s Anna is, of course, the designated bad girl — she’s also the woman Conor dials after his date with Gigi — but the role doesn’t stick. Ms. Johansson seems too comfortable in her own beautiful skin to pay attention to wagging fingers, particularly when they belong to a twerp like Conor, who delivers a late sermon about her commitment issues. One problem with the movie is that, aside from Ben Affleck, who plays Jennifer Aniston’s marriage-phobic boyfriend, the actors are seriously outmatched by the actresses. Justin Long, the guy from the Macintosh ads, and Ms. Goodwin are a questionable-enough match. But Ms. Johansson and Mr. Connolly, the second guy on the left in the HBO series “Entourage,” make no sense. She’s Scarlett Johansson, for goodness’ sake!  It’s worth noting that in a movie ostensibly dedicated to the relationship worries of the modern (straight) woman, Anna is also the only one in the distaff batch with an active, seemingly pleasurable sex life. Most of the other women are too busy trying to land men, trying to hold on to men or ruining their relationships with men to actually have sex. (Drew Barrymore, meanwhile, pops up a few times, often surrounded by wisecracking gay men.) Imagine an action flick in which the hero spends the entire movie chasing the villain without the compensatory satisfaction of smashing his enemy to smithereens. There’s a reason action producers like Jerry Bruckheimer blow stuff up in their movies: They know what men want.  “He’s Just Not That Into You” is rated PG-13 (Women strongly cautioned). Dating is lethally depressing. 

Everyone's in love with someone in "He's Just Not That Into You," a not-quite-romantic-comedy that should click with the young-adult demos of both sexes. Yes, it makes men look like toads -- how else could Jennifer Connelly, Jennifer Aniston, Ginnifer Goodwin and several other beautiful women not named Jennifer/Ginnifer be on such a recessionary track in the romance market? But heartache is universal; it knows no cosmetic boundaries. And the New Line pic, pushed back by Warners from fall 2008 to a pre-Valentine's Day release, effectively taps into the voyeuristic appeal of watching the beautiful suffer.
They certainly suffer. Slickly adapted by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein from the popular book by "Sex and the City" scribes Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, "He's Just Not That Into You" rolls out like an instructional soap opera. When Gigi (Goodwin) -- who might as well have "desperately needy" tattooed to her forehead -- doesn't get a call back from Conor (Kevin Connolly) in the requisite 20 minutes after their date has ended, she has to go into counseling with her friends/co-workers, Beth (Aniston) and Janine (Connelly), and eventually with Alex (Justin Long), the bartender in the joint where Gigi goes to stalk Conor.
While Gigi's friends talk her off the figurative ledge, it's Alex who lets her in on a few things, such as how to tell if a guy is never going to call
, even though Gigi has a hard time getting any of this through her pretty little romance-befogged skull.
It's all a matter of expectations, and perhaps fear of fulfillment: Mary (Drew Barrymore), for instance, is the ad manager for a gay Baltimore magazine whose guy-pals help her through one love trauma after another, most of them virtual. She's got unanswered emails and voicemails and MySpace and Facebook friends, but love is elusive. And so is Mary, if you count face-to-face encounters.
You can't say helmer Ken Kwapis ("License to Wed," "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants") or his writers are particularly easy on either sex. There's far more insight into the female characters, but they, too, are full of foibles. Gigi doesn't know when to back off. Neither does Janine, whose marriage to Ben (Bradley Cooper) seems OK at first, although she's a freak about his smoking -- which upsets her even more than what transpires between Ben and an overripe tartlet named Anna (Scarlett Johansson), a would-be singer who's also been leading Conor (remember Conor?) around by the nose.
Beth, meanwhile, learns that her sister is getting married, which throws her seven-year relationship with Neil (Ben Affleck) into disequilibrium: Is he ever going to marry her? No. So she leaves him. And another planet spins out of control.
Despite its layer of darkness (Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner), "He's Just Not That Into You" is a fantasy. No one has a problem except
 romance. Neil sails a yacht. Ben and Janine are giving their Baltimore apartment an overhaul that would embarrass Architectural Digest. Perhaps that's the point: No one has anything to distract them from the minutiae of their love lives, which they proceed to incinerate through overanalysis. It's a moral fable, maybe, if you make half a million a year.
Pic isn't quite an ensemble piece; it feels as though Goodwin and Long are the frontmen; Aniston, Connelly, Cooper and Connolly are the backup band; and Barrymore and Affleck are the chick singers. Johansson, as usual, is in her own movie. But the pic may also be the first contemporary escapist comedy that feels fully aware of its place in the economic vortex. The lushness, the leisure, the vicarious wealth are all balms to soothe our savaged selves as we look away from the news and onto the screen. Given the state of things, such a movie almost seems like an act of charity toward the public. It's not screwball comedy, but the underlying sentiments are the same.
Production values are top-notch, especially the work of d.p. John Bailey.


The smirky, overbearing, and subliminally hostile romantic primer He's Just Not That Into You —which sold a regrettable two million copies when it was published in 2004—seizes on some partial truths about the gender wars and blows them up into evolutionary gospel about the crossed wires of male-female dating behavior. The book's title is taken from a scene in Sex and the City   and hinges on the solipsistic worldview of series consultant Greg Behrendt , with faint murmurs of watery feminist protest from co-writer Liz Tuccillo . Behrendt coyly 'fesses up to being a reformed rascal himself, then steams full-speed ahead to the conclusion that if he's that way, then so, too, is the rest of mankind. Further, he is the one to set us myopic females straight. Director Ken Kwapis  is charged with hacking a romantic comedy out of that plotless guide for ditzy daters, played quite well here by assorted Jennifers Aniston, Connelly, and (Ginnifer) Goodwin, with Scarlett Johansson  thrown in as the home-wrecker. If all you ask for is a few gay jokes, a perky score, pretty shots of Baltimore, and some clever but callow observations of sexual mores in the city, He's Just Not That Into You  is an amiable enough night out. What's depressing about this movie—as well as forerunners Sex and the City  and Mamma Mia! —is the low bar they set both for modern women and the movies that seek to represent them.
