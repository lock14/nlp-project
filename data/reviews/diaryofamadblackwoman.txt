Like Stella a few years ago, this new movie tells the story of how yet another black woman, Helen McCarter (Elise), jumps back in the game and gets her groove back. The characters� journeys are somewhat different, as are the two films� storytelling techniques. However, both movies� target audience is the same: urban black women who yearn for a good sudser and a laugh. Diary of a Mad Black Woman
 has enough suds to blow soap bubbles around anything in its path, but the movie�s melodramatic strife is leavened with broad slapstick strokes, which creates a bizarrely uneven tone that requires viewers to shift tears of empathy to tears of laughter often within the same scene. Despite the film�s hoary clich�s and the bad drag of actor/screenwriter Tyler Perry (who plays three roles in the film, one of whom is the outsized Madea, a Martin Lawrence Big Momma type who packs a pistol), viewers seem to respond to Helen�s ups and downs with vocal squeals of enthusiasm and disbelief. "Oh no, she didn�t!" we all seem to squawk in unison at one or another of Helen�s doormat decisions, thus ratifying our communal experience. Even though audiences might have a fun time while viewing Diary of a Mad Black Woman
, that does not make it a good movie � just one that shows potential for ongoing camp value. On the eve of their 20th wedding anniversary, Helen�s husband, Charles (Harris, of The Practice
), literally throws her out of their Atlanta mansion in favor of a younger, more fertile, new wife. At a loss, Helen returns to her grandmother Madea�s home, which Madea also shares with her randy brother (also played by Perry). Madea shows Helen how to claim what is hers and then chain-saw the rest to bits, and eventually Helen finds new love with soulful Orlando (Moore). Yet more twists and turns are in store when Charles is shot and paralyzed by an angry client, a situation that leads Helen through more character shifts than Sybil
. Cruelty, church redemption, miraculous healings of limbs and junkie relatives � all have their moments onscreen. Accomplished video director Grant makes a clumsy debut as a feature director, bringing little sense of oversight to the proceedings. Elise effectively manages this role that requires her to shift on a dime from happy to sad, and the film provides a vivid showcase for Perry�s instinctive talents. The movie does no service to veteran Tyson though, and if one desires to see her on the screen again they�re better off advised to go see Because of Winn-Dixie
, which is also in current release. Diary of a Mad Black Woman
 is a shambling affair, but its mixture of suds and slapstick make it a slippery contender.


Blows to the head are delivered with more subtlety than the message of ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman." But the movie seems intended as a blunt instrument, so its lack of finesse is very much the point: Certain women (and you know who you are) need a wake-up call to free them from the grip of a dead relationship.
''Diary" is part broad comedy, part domestic drama, part extended R&B slowjam, and total audience-tickler, with a lot of church and even more soap opera thrown in. It leaves no mood unswung as it shares with us the feel-bad-then-feel-really-good story of Helen McCarter, whom Kimberly Elise plays with a fearsome mix of honey and hot sauce.
Helen is literally dragged out of her great big Atlanta house. The occasion is her 18th wedding anniversary, and to celebrate, her husband Charles (Steve Harris) has decided to trade her in for a vapid, younger, less black woman. Oh, Helen wails and fights, but it's no use. Charles is a high-powered attorney, and knowing she signed a prenup, he's determined to be rid of her.
Helen's movie periscope might be not be working but mine spied Orlando (Shemar Moore), the ''strong, sensitive, and Christian" (not to mention unbelievably patient) metalworker who begins to sweep her off her feet the moment she's expelled.
But before Helen collapses into the arms of a ''knight in shining armor," she must find a career. She must grieve, she must grouse, she must move all the way back to the ghetto -- or, at least what the movie advertises as the ghetto.
It's really just a working-class neighborhood whose central figure, Helen's bawdy and vulgar Aunt Madea, is on hand to remind us that ''ghetto" is merely a state of mind. She carries a gun in her purse, curses up a storm, and prefers to say ''cleanting" while the rest of us say ''cleaning."
She also drags Helen back to her husband's home, and, in a sendup of Terry McMillan, the aggrieved wife destroys the clothes in her replacement's walk-in closet, while Madea chainsaws the living room and offers the movie's dedication: ''This is for every woman who's ever had a problem with a black man."
Judging from the applause that erupted when I saw the film, that number is pretty high.
Madea is the movie's warehouse of crudeness and its pulpit of truth. (Her name is less Euripides and more a Southernism for ''mother dear.") Along with two other characters, she is played by the movie's writer, actor-playwright Tyler Perry, whose cross-dressing inspiration for this top-heavy caricature appears to be Martin Lawrence in ''Big Momma's House."
Perry's brand of touring ''urban" theater has made him a star in black America. I've seen a couple of his shows on DVD while waiting to get my hair cut at the barbershop. On the stage, their overall hamminess wears down your resistance, and the frisky interplay with the live audience makes them passable fun. A precise double take is always good for a big laugh. But there's nothing precise about the movie that director Darren Grant has made of ''Diary."
In the very same scene, the movie hops from farce to melodrama and back to farce without regard for tone. Seeing Perry's Madea cut up with the intensely humorless Elise is like watching the mask of comedy mock the mask of tragedy until somebody laughs. (Having the ultra-serious Cicely Tyson play Helen's mother is the movie's one stroke of genius; they have the same mouth and the same wig.)
The stage can handle Perry's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dramaturgy. The movie lacks the patience and the skill to handle the character contradictions and all the strands of story, which include Helen's cousin's travails with his drug-addicted wife and an inane plot twist that lands Charles back in Helen's life.
It's all tied up with a sloppy bow in a single church-bound scene. Anyone who's thought about a sitcom of ''The Color Purple" should know Perry has beaten them to it.


         Playwright-screenwriter Tyler Perry exudes considerable raw talent and abundant passion, which energizes "Diary of a Mad Black Woman," directed by Darren Grant from Perry's adaptation of his play. But Perry short-circuits his serious effort to dramatize a woman's attempt to rebuild her life after her husband has dumped her by casting himself not only as Madea, a gun-toting, loud, outsized battle-ax, but also her foul-mouthed brother Joe. These characters, which Perry worked into the narrative from other stage performances, may have been entertaining in those venues, but they undermine the film.
 
  Comic relief is often welcome in drama, but these broad caricatures, which draw easy laughter as the minstrel turns they are, destroy the sense of reality that a large and hardworking cast is otherwise striving to create. Perversely, Perry also casts himself as the heroine's attorney cousin, and he is completely acceptable as a normal husband and father trying to cope with a junkie wife (Tamara Taylor).
 


         






    On the eve of his 18th wedding anniversary, Steve Harris' Charles, a successful Atlanta area attorney, receives an award at a lavish banquet and graciously thanks his beautiful wife, Helen (Kimberly Elise), for the loving support that made his success possible. After the couple get home, Charles announces to Helen that their marriage is over and literally throws her out, with all her clothing and personal possessions to be carted away in a U-haul. Charles is eager to move in his tough-dame mistress — and their two small children.
 
  Helen takes refuge with Madea, a grandmother figure to her, and copes with the shock of rejection by the man she loves, rebuilding her life step by painful step. Her cousin Brian (Perry) steps forward to represent her in the divorce case, she gets a job as a waitress at an upscale restaurant, and she warily allows herself to be courted by the handsome and sensitive Orlando (Shemar Moore), a factory worker who just happened to have been hired to drive that U-haul. The anger and pain Helen must work through to begin to trust the solid Orlando, who has been dumped by his steady for a rich guy, is entirely plausible — and the heart of the film.
 
  Elise was also the star of the recent and powerful "Woman Thou Art Loosed," and like that film, "Diary" is grounded in religious faith. Both films' true believers accept human frailties and life's realities in a nonjudgmental way. When Helen and her friends and relatives, including Cicely Tyson as Helen's elegant mother, a devout Christian with a strong belief in forgiveness, go to church, it is to participate in a joyous expression of faith and belief in the healing power of salvation. "Woman Thou Art Loosed" and "Diary," both based on plays widely seen in African American communities, are part of a growing number of religious-themed African American films that are beginning to make a dent at the box office; it's not for nothing that Lions Gate Films is distributing "Diary."
 
  As in "Woman," Elise has the vivid, full-bodied presence melodrama demands, and while Grant's control over his cast and material is wobbly, Perry's sure dramatic instincts inspire him to create a climactic double-whammy payoff. Florid but psychologically and emotionally valid and satisfying, it makes his turns as Joe and Madea in particular all the more unfortunate.

The gonzo soap opera Diary of a Mad Black Woman  is a bad movie so over-the-top that at moments it's almost good  or, at least, more arresting than it has any right to be. At the beginning, Helen (Kimberly Elise), who is sprightly and angel-faced and has been married for 18 years, gets kicked out of her home in the Atlanta suburbs. To state that basic fact doesn't begin to describe the deranged spectacle of the event. The house is no mere house: It's a stone mansion bigger than Wayne Manor or Gosford Park. That house is the film's way of saying, This is not your father's movin'-on-up assimilation daydream. You'd imagine the lord of the manor might be some sort of multinational CEO, but no: Charles McCarter (Steve Harris), Helen's husband, is merely an attorney, albeit a very prominent one. He is also a rat bastard, a heartless and conniving philanderer who has two children with his mistress (Lisa Marcos). After informing Helen that their marriage is over, he hits the point home by literally dragging her out the door, as the (notably light-skinned) bitch-mistress looks on. At least one thing is wrong with this picture: If Charles is supposed to be such a poshly pretentious, imperiously self-interested customer, it seems highly unlikely that he'd go out of his way to make a scene in which he behaves like a low-dog pimp. Yet that's all part of the shameless trash-fantasy broadness that gives Diary of a Mad Black Woman  its crudely rousing tent-show juice. The film, directed by music-video vet Darren Grant, was written by Tyler Perry, a playwright and burlesque character actor who's developed a major following on stage (he plays three roles in the film), and he pumps his clichés so full of hot air that they stay aloft even as you're laughing at their brazenness.
Tossed out on her own, without a penny of Charles' fortune (she had signed a prenup), Helen is like the heroine of An Unmarried Woman abandoned into a world of pulp retribution and princess romance. Charles, you'd better believe, gets exactly what's coming to him, but Helen also meets a too-good-to-be-true suitor, a steel-factory worker named Orlando (Shemar Moore) who, with his cornrows and soft manner, is like a hip-hop Ken doll. (He actually says, ''I want to be your knight in shining armor.'') Kimberly Elise, who has been featured in such films as The Manchurian Candidate  and Beloved  and was the star of Woman Thou Art Loosed  (which was earlier a play by Perry), has a face that's all sexy, winsome curlicues. She's as beautiful as Michelle Pfeiffer, and she's got range: She can glow adoringly one moment and rage, with a dash of hellfire, the next. Aiding Helen at every turn is Madea, her rascally, big-bottomed, gun-totin' ancient giantess of a grandma  played, by Perry himself, in a drag act that would look even more outrageous if Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence hadn't gotten there first.
Madea, who is Perry's most popular stage character, schools Helen in the art of payback, as in the scene where they rip up the mistress' clothes. ''This is for every black woman who ever had a problem with a black man!'' whoops Madea, and she might be speaking for the entire film, which is presented as a kind of passion play for black women. Helen, the saintly housewife scorned, never transcends being an archetype, yet she's offered up as a soulful super-martyr for every sister in the audience to project onto. She's a walking one-woman Waiting to Exhale , and Diary  could end up rousing its audience in a similar way.
One of the most insidious lies in Hollywood is that its decision makers don't care about black or white  that the only color that matters to them is green. This has always been a fashionably cynical way of explaining why there aren't more black films, yet what it does, in effect, is to blame African-American audiences for the racial blinders of the film industry. Where were all the black chick flicks that were supposed to follow the success of Waiting to Exhale ? (There was How Stella Got Her Groove Back  and then...not much.) If Hollywood were doing its job, there'd be no need for  or defense of  a movie as outsize in its melodrama as Diary of a Mad Black Woman , yet it's Tyler Perry's belief that he isn't just telling a story, he's telling the story, that kept me watching. The climactic gospel number, ''I Want to Be Free,'' seems to let loose all the pent-up emotion of the characters' trials and dreams. Diary  is a crock, all right, but a crock made with conviction.

iary of a Mad Black Woman" is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's re-ascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak. Playing every end against a shamelessly mushy middle, the movie's producer, writer and composer, Tyler Perry, inhabits three major roles, including Madea, a wisecracking, gun-toting grandmother of immense girth. Like Flip Wilson's Geraldine or Martin Lawrence disguised as Big Momma, Madea is an uncensored matriarch and ferocious comic tornado. When the dumped wife, Helen (Kimberly Elise), shows up on her doorstep after being physically ejected from the Atlanta mansion she shared for 17 years with her bigwig lawyer husband, Charles (Steve Harris), Madea springs into action. With Helen at her side, she marches to Charles's home, shotgun in hand, and proceeds to divide the couple's possessions in half - literally, with a chainsaw. A closet full of fancy dresses belonging to the floozy Charles has installed as Helen's replacement is ripped to shreds. Mr. Perry, the show-business impresario who wrote the play from which this movie is adapted, is a commercial phenomenon who has produced, directed and starred in seven theater works that have grossed more than $75 million, according to the film's production notes. For the African-American crowds who lap them up, their mixture of unedited rage and raucous hilarity promises a vicarious letting off of steam. Because Helen was a faithful, devoted wife to the brute who turned her out, when the tables are turned and she becomes Charles's tormentor, the movie offers jilted wives and girlfriends a guilt-free pass to crow. Waiting in the wings for Helen is a handsome, courtly Prince Charming, Orlando (Shemar Moore), with all the right Christian values. Helen becomes the recipient of two marriage proposals (accompanied by achingly sincere "I love you's") on bended knee from this impossibly perfect hunk. Helen, now sanctified by romance and the church, to which she drags a newly humbled Charles, triumphs as an unblemished, bling-free Christian goddess, living happily ever after with her courtly hottie. "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for strong language and sexual situations.

An ungainly hodgepodge of vaudeville-style comedy, turgid soap-operatics, and joyful epiphanies of gospel-flavored uplift,  "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" may appear to be based on an unworkable formula, but pic could wind up a sleeper success. Written by popular legiter Tyler Perry, whose plays have proven phenomenally popular with African-American auds in touring and regional productions, pic is pitched primarily (if not exclusively) to urban femmes yet has potential to score impressively as a long-legged crowd-pleaser. Sturdy homevid biz should compensate for probable dearth of crossover theatrical prospects.
First-time feature helmer Darren Grant stresses sudser elements too insistently in opening scenes that introduce Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) as narrator and eponymous protagonist. On the very evening her lawyer-husband Charles (Steve Harris) is honored by peers in their Atlanta community, Helen is literally tossed out of their palatial digs after 18 years of marriage. Her wails and pleadings fall on deaf ears, since Charles already has picked out a younger -- and, pointedly, more fertile -- trophy wife-to-be (Lisa Marcos).
Mood lightens abruptly when Helen seeks refuge in the home of her beloved grandmother Madea, a trash-talking, pistol-packing firecracker played in outrageous drag by playwright/scripter Perry. (Think Martin Lawrence in "Big Momma's House," only more heavily padded and less feminine.) Madea offers heartfelt sympathy and blunt-spoken advice, suggesting that Helen get mad and 

get even.
Vertiginous mood swings continue throughout pic, as "Diary" lurches back and forth between domestic drama and cartoonish slapstick, sometimes shifting gears two or three times within a single sequence. Perry goes for gut-busting belly laughs in dual roles of Madea and Uncle Joe, Madea's crotchety (and horny) brother. But actor-writer plays for keeps during serious turn in third a role: Brian, Helen's cousin, who's trying to raise his children as a single parent while estranged wife Debrah (Tamara Taylor) wallows in self-destructive cycles of drug abuse.
Like most other suddenly unmarried women in femme-skewing pics, Helen gets a new lease on life and love when she drops her defenses and embraces a hunky Mr. Right. But just when it appears she'll be happily-ever-aftering with soul mate Orlando (Shemar Moore), Helen gets pelted with a third-act curveball: Charles is attacked by an unhappy client, and requires help to recover from paralyzing injuries.
Loudly enthusiastic responses at recent preview screening suggest "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" hits the bull's-eye with its target demographic. Less empathetic auds may respond to spirited funny business, but remain unimpressed by melodramatic excesses, unremarkable production values and wildly uneven performances. It doesn't help that more than a few players tackle heavily emotional scenes with overstated sincerity more appropriate to a special episode of a routine sitcom. Even vet Cicely Tyson, cast as Helen's mom, isn't at the top of her game here.
Some problems might be attributable to Grant's relative inexperience as director of actors. (He comes to project with background primarily in music vids and commercials.) But, material likely would have defeated even the best efforts of a vet helmer to sustain a consistency of tone and style.
And the prominence of an obviously cross-dressing thesp in central role will keep many from taking pic seriously. "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" doesn't call for mere suspension of disbelief. Rather, it demands that disbelief be wrestled to the ground and chloroformed.
Even so, pic can be appreciated as a genuine hoot by more indulgent auds, and may play particularly well with those who experience shocks of recognition while enjoying themselves.

Here are two mid-career Seijun Suzuki  opuses that didn't get him in trouble, but should havethe man's timeless disgust with formula and studio prescription radiates like desert heat from his movies, whose narratives are really just cheap suits endured on the wacky path to self-destruction. Fighting Elegy (1966) is as iconic as its title, a jumpy cartoon vision of 1930s Japanese youth culture driven into paroxysms of crazy, militaristic violence by its own sexual frustration. Often as broad as a Keystone two-reeler, the movie is virtually a mission statement by its apostatic director, and was the last Nikkatsu Studio film he made before being fired for Branded to Kill . Youth of the Beast  (1963), at any rate, should've given the company men a hint. Another reimagining of Red Harvest , the film posits Suzuki axiom Jo Shishido  as a dyspeptic, chipmunk-faced thug pitting one yakuza organization against another, but the resulting meth-cranked circus of jazzy chiaroscuro design and cartwheeling sadism has to be seen to be believed. With an essay by Howard Hampton  that's almost as much outrageous fun as the movie itself.
