Completely forgettable in nearly every way, Haven
 follows the stories of several strangers who cross paths during one fateful night on the heavenly shores of the Cayman Islands. Taking its visual cues from Traffic
 and Crash
, the film displays little to no innovation or reason in its use of supersaturated colors and handheld camera techniques. Though brazenly derivative, the visual style is at least pretty, but the script never transcends tired melodrama. The plot, a mishmash of Pulp Fiction
 and (again) Traffic
, with elements of (believe it or not) West Side Story
, follows Carl (Paxton), a shady businessman who flees Miami with his precocious 18-year-old daughter, Pippa (Bruckner), in order to escape some  particularly aggressive FBI agents. Arriving on the island of Grand Cayman with $1 million duct-taped to his chest, Carl attempts to track down his deceitful attorney (Dillane) while his daughter wanders off with a goofy local party boy (Rasuk). At this point the film inexplicably abandons these characters, in whom I wasn't really feeling much investment anyway, and introduces the lowly boatman Shy (Bloom) and his one true love, Andrea (Saldana), the wealthy daughter of a local magnate. The two star-crossed lovers coo and whine about their mutual infatuation until Andrea's brother (Mackie), otherwise known as the obsessive character without any motivation, brutally attacks the unsuspecting Shy. The young lovers' lives are thus thrown into (gulp) more drama and turmoil. Ultimately, everyone more or less collides on the same night at the same party where Shy confronts Andrea's brother while Carl manages to avenge his jackass lawyer, ensure his daughter's financial future, and protect his stolen money, all before getting taken away by the men in the black SUVs. The result is a  film that feels like an exercise in futility. The characters are mostly annoying, and the convoluted plot jumps around with countless unmotivated flashbacks and -forwards. Lacking purpose or thoughtful complexity, Flowers' film is an overly ambitious mess.

         "Haven" is being quietly slipped into theaters, but this is not the usual end-of-summer jetsam dump. The film, which has been recut since it screened two years ago at the Toronto International Film Festival, is probably a victim of its own complexity.
 
 This genre-crossing ensemble piece switches from the sublime (suspended moments of lovers' bliss) to the stomach-churning (the constant threat of violence) without breaking its swaying stride. Set in the Cayman Islands, it intertwines stories of corrupt businessmen fleeing the feds into tax havens, local small-time operators overestimating their own abilities and, at its center, forbidden romance. It's about the paradises the characters seem to find, each of which turns out to be more than just a letter away from "Heaven."
 


         






   Although writer-director Frank E. Flowers, making his feature-film debut, falls into the common traps of MTV-Soderbergh progeny, busybody editing and camera action, he generates tension with relatively strong storytelling and compelling relationships. The movie's not quite a thriller, not just a love story; it's told in a nonlinear style that can abruptly downshift to a leisurely gait.
 
 Flowers reportedly grew up in the Caymans, which would explain the fine detail sprinkled throughout. He has given his actors some well-observed characters, such as the big-talking island lothario who "cleans up" a kitchen beer spill by rubbing it with his shoe, or the teenage sidekick whose pimped-out ride is a ratty bicycle with a boom box strapped to the handlebars. Flowers gets relaxed, naturalistic performances from a strong cast that includes Orlando Bloom, who executive produced the film, Bill Paxton and Stephen Dillane.
 
 As the romantic dreamer Shy in "Haven," Bloom is at his best since a roguish jaunt in "Ned Kelly." Zoë Saldana ("Guess Who," "The Terminal") gives a sweet and complicated performance as Shy's secret love, Andrea. As the smooth-operating island kid Fritz, Victor Rasuk ("Raising Victor Vargas") is simultaneously charming and reprehensible.
 
 "Haven" is far from perfect, with some uncomfortable pacing, wayward accents and less-than-satisfying denouements. But it's a refreshing, character-driven antidote to the late-summer movie-house blahs, and Flowers looks like a talent worth watching.

The terminally muddled crime drama Haven  is set in the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean outpost as famous for its tax-free, no-questions-asked banking attractions as for its tropical beauty. That's where a shady Miami businessman (Bill Paxton) flees the feds, dragging along his restless 18-year-old daughter (Agnes Bruckner), who falls in with a scamming local kid (Victor Rasuk), while elsewhere on the island a different sort of poor local (Orlando Bloom, yes, his dreamy, low-energy self, cast as another cutie of lowly birth) is conducting a secret romance with the comely daughter (Zoë Saldaña) of a powerful, rich man (Robert Wisdom), the Romeo and Juliet-ness of which is uncovered by her family's hotheaded weakling son (Anthony Mackie), who throws acid in the cute poor boy's face. Then the screen goes black, followed by those traditional words of cinematic defeat, ''four months later.''
I haven't even found room in the previous run-on sentence to mention Stephen Dillane as a nefarious financial adviser, Bobby Cannavale as a federal agent, or Jake Weber as a cop, three more of the bemused name-brand cast. Perhaps they were all lured to the project (written and directed by Frank E. Flowers, who grew up in the Caymans) by the offer of an exotic vacation  no questions asked about character motivation, story coherence, or whether the mania for movies composed of seemingly unrelated, interlocking stories peaked even back in 2004, when Haven  was made. I can answer the last: No. Wait for Babel .

 From a producer of “Crash” comes “Haven,” an even phonier exercise in manufactured conflict, facile irony and preposterous contrivance. The story begins with an American businessman (Bill Paxton) who, betrayed by a British financier (Stephen Dillane), flees to the Cayman Islands with his daughter (Agnes Bruckner). Enter Fritz (Victor Rasuk), a local delinquent, along with all manner of trouble (greed, racism, colonialism, acid flung in the face), not least of which is a violently arbitrary rupture in the plot.  “Haven” now turns its mind, so to speak, to Shy (Orlando Bloom), an introspective fisherman whose love for a local girl (Zoë Saldana) breeds trouble with her family (Anthony Mackie and Robert Wisdom). If by this point, the writer and director Frank E. Flowers has not convinced you of his subtle genius, note that Shy mans a boat named Destiny.  Eventually the plot strands twist together and the movie goes completely berserk, looping back and forth through time and space in a flailing attempt at nonlinear poetic frisson. Achieving instead only convoluted nonsense, Mr. Flowers stirs up a combustible blend of social ills and sub-Shakespearean passions, doses it with overburdened metaphor and stands back as it blows up in his face.  “Haven” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex, drugs, cursing and violence.

A seesaw chronology and generally chaotic approach plagues "Haven," an overly ambitious, multicharacter love story-cum-underworld revenge drama set on a fleetingly exotic island. The presence of Orlando Bloom, who also has a co-producer card here, as a young dock worker literally scarred by love may attract a teen audience, but the foundation of fans Bloom's built on the basis of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "Pirates of the Caribbean" will find far shakier shelter here.
On a Friday afternoon, affluent Floridian Carl Ridley (Bill Paxton) is warned by fax that the feds are about to swoop down on him for shady business practices. Grabbing $l million in cash and his rebellious 18-year-old daughter, Pippa (Agnes Bruckner), Ridley flees to what he thinks is the famously safe haven of Grand Cayman Island. But he learns the banks are closed until Monday morning, his island lawyer Mr. Allan (Stephen Dillane) is nowhere to be found and Pippa has been lured to a "gangsta kid" party by fast-talking local punk Fritz (Victor Rasuk).
Meanwhile, genial British native and newly minted Caymanian Shy (Bloom) is involved in an increasingly violent dispute with Hammer (Anthony Mackie), who's angry over Shy's love affair with his sister Andrea (Zoe Saldana). In the four months since Hammer caught Shy in bed with her, Andrea has begun experimenting with sex and drugs in Fritz's circle, which is overseen by local crime boss My Nigga Rich (Raz Adoti).
As events escalate, Ridley discovers lawyer Allan has another agenda, Fritz tips crime boss Rich off to the cash cache and Hammer throws acid on Shy's face.
Debuting helmer and Caymanian native Frank E. Flowers brings street-smart energy to the proceedings, but needlessly complicates the film with a disastrous time-shifting structure that proves nearly impossible to follow.
A welcome flurry of early-reel title cards sorts plot strands into "The Americans," "The Brits," "The Caymanians" and various locations, but numerous subplots muddy the waters considerably. Pic sporadically cuts to an outdoor concert by singer John the Baptist (Kymani Marley) for no apparent reason.
English subtitling in key passages would help, as lilting Caymanian patois, peppered with street slang, is often unintelligible.
Beyond a tender bedroom scene with Andrea and a violent showdown with Hammer, Bloom seems just as swamped as everyone else in a part Flowers retooled and expanded specifically for the actor. "Raising Victor Vargas" star Rasuk makes a fleeting impression as the annoying Fritz, while Paxton, whose story arc as Ridley is abandoned for long stretches, is given little to do beyond his trademark anxiousness.
Editor Peter Christelis does the best he can with the labyrinthine structure and Michael Bernard's over-caffeinated camerawork. Helmer Flowers doesn't show much of the Caymans -- only a few locations reveal anything distinctive about the British territory (which, per producers, had been used as a backdrop only once previously, for Tom Cruise thriller "The Firm").
Toronto fest catalog confusingly lists pic as a Cayman Islands-U.K. co-prod, though closing credit crawl specifies British-German-American-Spanish alliance. Flavorful source music includes tunes by Ziggy Marley, Toots & the Maytals, Gregory Isaacs and Bob Marley & the Wailers.
