In the sensual and womanly-wise period drama Bright Star , Abbie Cornish looks at once demure and succulent in astonishing peony-colored garments as Fanny Brawne, while Ben Whishaw, in a teal waistcoat, is a vision of 19th-century emo tubercular hotness as the great Romantic poet John Keats. In life, Brawne was the girl next door who loved Keats deeply; the two were engaged when the poet died in Italy, coughing blood, at the age of 25. Today Brawne is remembered mostly as the recipient of passionate Keatsian love letters. (His poem ''Bright Star'' was dedicated to her.)
But in Jane Campion's quiet, luscious, stately meditation, an empathetic identification with Brawne's view of the world is tied to the filmmaker's thematic interest in young love (especially seen from a girl's point of view), the creative process, and the meaning of poetry. Brawne, a talented seamstress who found artistic expression in designing her own clothes, may have lived in an age of restrictive garments and equally restrictive rules of feminine conduct. But Campion's big-sisterly encouragement of Cornish's lovely, openhearted performance  and Whishaw's well-matched response  results in a character instantly, intimately recognizable to anyone remembering her own first love.


 John Keats was a Romantic poet. “Bright Star,” which tells the tale of Keats and Fanny Brawne, the love of his short life, is a romantic movie. The vernacular of popular culture and the somewhat specialized language of literary history assign different meanings to that word, but the achievement of Jane Campion’s learned and ravishing new film is to fuse them, to trace the comminglings  and collisions of poetic creation and amatory passion.  This is a risky project, not least because a bog of cliché and fallacy lies between the filmmaker and her goal. In the first decades of the 19th century, some poets may have been like movie stars, but the lives of the poets have been, in general, badly served on film, either neglected altogether or puffed up with sentiment and solemnity. The Regency period, moreover, serves too many lazy, prestige-minded directors as a convenient vintage clothing store. And there are times in “Bright Star” when Keats, played by the pale and skinny British actor Ben Whishaw (“Perfume,” “I’m Not There”), trembles on the edge of caricature. He broods; he coughs (signaling the tuberculosis that will soon kill him); he looks dreamily at flowers and trees and rocks.  But these moments, rather than feeling studied or obvious, arrive with startling keenness and disarming beauty, much in the way that Keats’s own lyrics do. His verses can at first seem ornate and sentimental, but on repeated readings, they have a way of gaining in force and freshness. The music is so intricate and artificial, even as the emotions it carries seem natural and spontaneous. And while no film can hope to take you inside the process by which these poems were made, Ms. Campion allows you to hear them spoken aloud as if for the first time. You will want to stay until the very last bit of the end credits, not necessarily to read the name of each gaffer and grip, but rather to savor every syllable of Mr. Whishaw’s recitation of “Ode to a Nightingale.”  Keats’s genius — underestimated by many of the critics of his time, championed by a loyal coterie of literary friends — is the fixed point around which “Bright Star” orbits. Its animating force, however, is the infatuation that envelops Keats and Brawne in their early meetings and grows, over the subsequent months, into a sustaining and tormenting love. Mr. Keats, as his lover decorously calls him, is diffident and uneasy at times, but also witty, sly and steadfast. The movie really belongs to Brawne, played with mesmerizing vitality and heart-stopping grace by Abbie Cornish.  Ms. Cornish, an Australian actress whose previous films include “Stop-Loss,” “Candy” and “Somersault,” has, at  27, achieved a mixture of unguardedness and self-control matched by few actresses of any age or nationality. She’s as good as Kate Winslet, which is about as good as it’s possible to be.  Fanny, the eldest daughter of a distracted widow (Kerry Fox), has some of the spirited cleverness of a Jane Austen heroine. A gifted seamstress, she prides herself on her forward-looking fashion sense and her independence. She is also vain, insecure and capable of throwing herself headlong into the apparent folly of adoring a dying and penniless poet, something no sensible Austen character would ever do.  If it were just the poet and his beloved, “Bright Star” might collapse in swooning and sighing, or into the static rhythms of a love poem. And while there are passages of extraordinary lyricism — butterflies, fields of flowers, fluttering hands and beseeching glances — these are balanced by a rough, energetic worldliness. Lovers, like poets, may create their own realms of feeling and significance, but they do so in contention with the same reality that the rest of us inhabit.  The film’s designated reality principle is Charles Brown (Paul Schneider), Keats’s friend, patron and collaborator and his main rival for Fanny’s attention. For Brown, Fanny is an irritant and a distraction, though the sarcastic intensity of their banter carries an interesting sexual charge of its own. In an Austen novel this friction would be resolved in matrimony, but “Bright Star,” following the crooked, shadowed path of biographical fact, has a different story to tell.  Brown and Keats are neighbors to the Brawne brood in Hampstead in 1818, when the story begins. In April of the following year the poets are occupying one-half of a house, with Fanny and her mother and siblings on the other side of the wall. After nine months Keats, in declining health, is dispatched to Italy by a committee of concerned friends, but until then  he and Fanny consummate their love in every possible way except physically.  Ms. Campion is one of modern cinema’s great explorers of female sexuality, illuminating Sigmund Freud’s “dark continent” with skepticism, sympathy and occasional indignation. “Bright Star” could easily have become a dark, simple fable of repression, since modern audiences like nothing better than to be assured that our social order is freer and more enlightened than any that came before. But Fanny and Keats are modern too, and though the mores of their time constrain them, they nonetheless regard themselves as free.  The film is hardly blind to the sexual hypocrisy that surrounds them. Fanny can’t marry Keats because of his poverty, but Brown blithely crosses class lines to have some fun with (and impregnate) a naïve and illiterate young household servant (Antonia Campbell-Hughes). That Fanny and Keats must sublimate their longings in letters, poems and conversations seems cruel, but they make the best of it. As does Ms. Campion: a sequence in which, fully clothed, the couple trades stanzas of “La Belle Dame Sans Merci” in a half-darkened bedroom must surely count as one of the hottest sex scenes in recent cinema.  The heat of that moment and others like it deliver “Bright Star” from the tidy prison of period costume drama. Ms. Campion, with her restless camera movements and off-center close-ups, films history in the present tense, and her wild vitality makes this movie romantic in every possible sense of the word.  “Bright Star” is rated PG (parental guidance suggested). It is perfectly chaste and insanely sexy.

The Jane Campion embraced by 1990s arthouse audiences but who's been missing of late makes an impressive return with "Bright Star." Breaking through any period-piece mustiness with piercing insight into the emotions and behavior of her characters, the writer-director examines the final years in the short life of 19th-century romantic poet John Keats through the eyes of his beloved, Fanny Brawne, played by Abbie Cornish in an outstanding performance. Beautifully made film possesses solid appeal for specialized auds in most markets, including the U.S., where it will be released by Bob Berney and Bill Pohlad's yet-to-be named new distribution company, although its poetic orientation and dramatic restraint will likely stand in the way of wider acceptance.
Keats died in 1821 at age 25, and his final years were marked by an incredible burst of creativity as well as by his one great romance, which inspired some extraordinary love letters. By concentrating on the latter, as experienced by Fanny, Campion gives rather short shrift to the former, leaving the viewer with a vivid picture of the social constraints on grand passion and romantic fulfillment in England at the time. While avoiding the typical biopic template, the film nonetheless honors the facts of the central relationship, which means some typical, central audience expectations concerning emotional payoff aren't met.
Most of the action is confined to two neighboring houses in Hampstead Village, North London, beginning in 1818. Living in one is the Brawne family, a fatherless brood consisting of matriarch Mrs. Brawne (Kerry Fox), 18-year-old daughter Fanny (Cornish), teenager Samuel (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and little sprite Toots (Edie Martin), while the bearded, boorish Mr. Brown (Paul Schneider) and Keats (Ben Whishaw) occupy the other.
While unobtrusively laying in the character dynamics -- Brown, highly protective of his Keats, is pointedly rude to Fanny and does all he can to keep her away from his friend, whom he tirelessly helps with his work -- Campion devotes special attention to the physical and aural aspects of this little middle-class corner of British society, thereby highlighting the sensual qualities of life that particularly captivated Keats himself. The opening shots convey the act of sewing -- Fanny's frequent activity -- with unsurpassed intimacy, while a performance by a small male  chorus at a domestic party carries oddly moving force, and other scenes pointedly focus upon pastimes that quiver with quasi-sexual sublimation, including dancing, sport, butterfly-collecting and hunting for the most fragrant flowers.
Then there is the poetry, which brings home the realization of how few films have ever dealt with poets and their work. Effectively establishing herself as an onscreen proxy for most viewers, Fanny early on confesses to Keats that "poems are a strain to work out," but then volunteers to take lessons in poetry appreciation, which allows Keats to recommend an emotional, impressionistic reaction rather than an intellectual one. Writing her screenplay in a way that plainly speaks of another era and yet comes across as natural and unaffected, Campion works in snippets of Keats' work at relevant moments, even under the end credits.
Although he makes a point of articulating his perplexed attitude about women, the slim, dreamily attractive Keats is clearly captivated by Fanny, who stands out by virtue of the direct gaze with which she meets all people and predicaments. All the same, she can scarcely throw off the constraints of family expectations and social norms, just as Keats feels unable and even unqualified to pursue a proper courtship with Fanny due to his poverty and lack of prospects.
For these and other reasons, which initially include the fatal (and foreshadowing) illness of Keats' brother Tom and persistently involve Brown's interference and the poet's periodic absences, the great romance blossoms very slowly. Even at its height, it is physically expressed only by gentle kissing and caressing; actual consummation is not in the cards, and Campion stringently avoids even so much as a grand clinch or music-swelled embrace, permitting the emotions to be expressed largely through letters and verse.
Keats, who feels himself "dissolving" in his love for Fanny, also begins to dissipate physically from tuberculosis. Advised to move to a warmer climate, he decamps for Italy, where he succumbs. Rightly judging that, like the act of writing, endless coughing up of blood does not make for very edifying viewing, Campion conveys the climactic information as Fanny learns it, to palpably convulsive effect.
With brown hair pulled tightly back and a tad more filled out than before, Cornish is made to look plainer than she actually is, which better emphasizes the importance of Fanny's character for Keats. The majority of her performance's success rests in her eyes, which are remarked upon by Brown for their amber hue and which, one senses, see and process so much. All of Campion's films center upon strong, complicated women, and Cornish's Fanny takes her place among the most memorable of them.
What's missing is an equally compelling sense of Keats' singular attributes. Everything one reads about the poet emphasizes his extreme sensitivity to nature and his almost swooning reaction to sensory stimuli. While these qualities are embedded in the filmmaking here, most particularly in the work of production and costume designer Janet Patterson and cinematographer Greig Fraser (who previously shot the shorts "The Water Diary" and "The Lady Bug" for Campion), they are not so evident in the writing of Keats' character or in the performance of Whishaw, which is appealing but not nearly as trenchant as that of his co-star.
Schneider's oozing presence as Brown creates a constant sense of unease for Fanny, while Martin is entirely winning presence as Fanny's redheaded little sister. Mark Bradshaw's score reps a major plus.


Set in the bucolic suburbs of early-19th-century London , as fresh and dewy as a newly mowed lawn, Jane Campion 's Bright Star  recounts the love affair between a tubercular young poet and the fashionable teenager next door. It's more conventionally romantic than wildly Romantic—but no less touching for that.
Fanny Brawne  (Australian actress Abbie Cornish ) is a self-assured, imperious girl who makes her entrance in a dress of her own design, accessorized with a bright red, yellow-plumed stovepipe hat. Lippy as well as eye-catching, she immediately gets sassy with the self-important scribblers, John Keats  (Ben Whishaw ) and Charles Brown  (Paul Schneider ), who rent the house across the way. Brown, an irascible, hairy Scot in hideous checked trousers, will be her rival for the attentions of Keats, whom, as Fanny discovers, is not only good-looking and sensitive but also the greatest unknown writer in England.
Still, it initially seems as if Bright Star  might be about a girl genius. Fanny is, as she informs the poets, a creative personality in her own right and more successful than they are. (Did she really invent the pleated skirt, the triple-petal mushroom collar, DIY fashion?) Her outfits are invariably conceptual works of art, while the unimaginative writers always wear the same dreary thing—the girl's interest in Keats is signaled when she opines that he would look well in blue velvet.
As played by Whishaw (Keith Richards  in a 2005 Rolling Stones  biopic and the most poetical of Dylan's avatars in I'm Not There ), Keats is clearly a proto–rock star—driven, yet lovable, and always attuned to himself. Mr. Keats and Miss Brawne make a fabulous couple: It's a pleasure to watch and, for the most part, listen to them. Her emphatically smooth brow and his artfully tousled hair seem designed to counterpoint the turbulence beneath their restraint. This emotional turmoil is evident in Keats's famously jealous love letters but, Fanny's competition with Brown aside, it is mainly manifested here in material problems. Keats's lack of professional prospects and poor health ensure that these super-adolescent lovers can never marry and thus consummate their love.
Keats argued against an art founded on certainty. However, Bright Star  has little interest in mystery—or even ambivalence. Keats's involvement with Fanny churned up all manner of demons, including the witchy femmes fatale of "Lamia" and "La Belle Dame Sans Merci." But when, late in the movie, Campion has the couple quote the latter to each other in precise call-and-response, rather than in a fevered outburst of erotic obsession, it becomes a decorous meditation on mortality.
Campion's self-contained Fanny is hardly the manic minx that Keats described in a letter to his brother: "Her shape is very graceful and so are her movements. . . . She is not seventeen—but she is ignorant—monstrous in her behavior flying out in all directions." The poet deemed the disturbing Miss Brawne "beautiful and elegant," yet "silly, fashionable, and strange." That could describe some of Campion's earlier films—Sweetie , Holy Smoke! , even her perversely skewed Henry James  adaptation, Portrait of a Lady —but not Bright Star . There's no weirdness here, despite the jarringly humid sensuality of the scene in which a lovesick Fanny transforms her bedroom into a butterfly terrarium.
Bright Star  is a movie of few discords, least of all in Mark Bradshaw 's faux-Baroque score. England 1818 seems like a Fragonard garden, the pastoral height of civilization. Conversation is witty; summer feels eternal. Zephyrs cool the heat, and classical compositions are animated by the adorable little girl (adorably named Toots) who dances attendance on the lovers. Their passion is both impossibly mad and hopelessly bourgeois—and as artfully turned-out as one of Fanny's outfits.
Bright Star , which might have been adapted from the Jane Austen  novel that Emily Brontë  never wrote, creates its own hermetic world. The requisite end titles suggest that Fanny consecrated her life to Keats's memory; in fact, she married and had three children who eventually became rich on the sale of the letters she sensibly saved. Shadowed by the knowledge of love's evanescence, this is a movie of undeniable pathos. But that does not make it sublime.
