When last we saw symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks), in 2006's The Da Vinci Code
, he had outwitted Opus Dei and uncovered Mary Magdalene's mortal remains, both under the handicap of a modified bob. Langdon returns in Angels & Demons
, another Roman Catholic Church conspiracy piece from bestseller Dan Brown, as do many of the same calling cards of the first: oogly boogly men in vestments, foreign-speaking lady sidekicks, and elaborate puzzles teased in dead languages. What doesn't carry over? Hanks' haircut from the first, and that omission � work with me here � says a lot, none of it promising, about A&D
's diminishing returns. The unholy union of Anna Wintour and Timothy Hutton, Hanks' Da Vinci
 locks seemed to shape-shift at different angles from bowl cut to mullet to Prince Valiant. It was comically bad, a giggling affront to good taste, not unlike the film at large: so ludicrous and overpuffed as to be, well, kinda fun. But Angels & Demons
 will have none of that. Okay, a little of that: When we are first reunited with Langdon, he's snugged into a sporty little Speedo, but that may very well be the first and only crack in the filmmakers' obsessively straight face. (I, on the other hand, had a hard time not snickering at composer Hans Zimmer�s opening salvo: Nothing intimates doom like the Carl Orff-like combo platter of timpani and a men's chorus.) This time around, the church itself calls in the agitator Langdon for help when the Preferiti � the four favorites to replace the newly dead pope � are kidnapped. All signs point to the Illuminati; to prove science's superiority over religion, the secret sect intends to kill one cardinal an hour and then � the big finish � demolish Vatican City with a stolen canister of antimatter (the so-called "God Particle"), which will set off a Hiroshima-like house-cleaning at the stroke of midnight (when, um, the canister's battery dies). Langdon attempts to decode various clues leading to the captive cardinals before the clock runs out; the bulk of Angels & Demons
 takes place in chase mode. Two sequences stand out as suspenseful and smartly rendered � we know what's at stake (death by suffocation or drowning), and we know what needs to be done (a breath of fresh air, in both cases) � but something's surely amiss, especially in a production of this scale, with this kind of talent at the helm, when these are exceptional instances and not the norm. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman don't require, or even particularly encourage, the audience to use its own little gray cells in unraveling the plot (which mostly consists of Hanks pointing at an ancient text or crumbling cathedral and muttering something explanatory), so the only thrill here comes from the adrenaline kick of the chase. Alas, it's an empty, Pavlovian kick at best.

Not all trash is art, but there's an art to making trash. So, father, forgive the makers of "Angels & Demons," for they know not what they do. Dan Brown's mystery novel, full of flamboyantly murdered cardinals, facts of every gratuitous stripe, and information kiosks masquerading as characters, has been given the serious treatment. OK, no movie whose climax includes a man of God plummeting, in his vestments, from the sky with a parachute is entirely serious.

But given the book's indecent juiciness, there's every reason to lament the creaky contraption Ron Howard and his screenwriters, Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, have devised. Howard also directed "The Da Vinci Code," based on the blockbuster Brown wrote after 2000's "Angels & Demons." Asking whether the new movie is better than the first is natural if moot. Would you prefer to drown in a swimming pool or an ocean?

"Angels & Demons" puts us back in the company of professor Robert Langdon, the droopy Harvard symbologist played once more by Tom Hanks. The Vatican has summoned Langdon to look into the meaning of mysterious ghastly events on the premises. The professor has been selected for his "expertise," his "erudition," and, most certainly, for his hair, which appears to be growing hydroponically from his scalp. The Church believes in miracles, yes, but what about Miracle-Gro?

Langdon arrives in St. Peter's Square not long after the pope has died. A conclave is underway for a replacement. But this ghastly killing, with its awful markings, suggests a conspiracy is afoot. Indeed, Langdon deduces that the branding is the work of an ancient, evil secret society called the Illuminati.

The group has come out of hiding, having hired an assassin to kidnap and kill each of the four papal candidates (one per hour) until midnight (the chase gets underway at 6:53 p.m.), at which point a stolen canister containing less than a gram of antimatter will explode in the Basilica, destroying everything, killing everyone. The late pope's chief aide  (Ewan McGregor) wants the threats publicized. But the elder cardinal overseeing the conclave (Armin Mueller-Stahl) demands secrecy and order.

Who in the Church is behind this craziness? Can Langdon read the signs quickly enough to stop it? Such lines as "Shining star at the end of the path? I thought so, too!" suggest that he'll at least get close. Langdon is speaking there to Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist with luxurious curls. A colleague was slain when the canister was taken in Switzerland, and she spends the movie running around Rome at Hanks's side.

Zurer, an Israeli using a shaky Italian accent, has some zest for the nonsense thrown her way. But all the chemistry between her and Hanks occurs strictly between their hair. She's a "bio-entanglement physicist." So presumably when she's not working on developing antimatter, she's coming up with the most amazing shampoos.
At many junctures the film makes wild, sad divergences from its source. I was truly looking forward to seeing Zurer say to Hanks, "You've never been to bed with a yoga master, have you?" So much for that. Catholic groups are throwing fits about the film's alleged irreverence, but it's not irreverent enough. Howard seems more afraid of crossing the almighty ratings board than potential boycotters.

The film tips its cap to the campy and the risible. Stellan Skarsgard, playing the head of the Swiss Guard, speaks witheringly when he can ("Thank goodness. The symbologist is here"), the public protests near the Vatican over stem cell research are badly enough staged and acted to be enjoyable, and there's a cut from a burning cardinal to an oven full of roasting communion wafers that's in delightfully poor taste.

Oddly, the filmmakers hold back at the risk of offense, as if a way exists to sugarcoat the ridiculousness of it all. Toward the end of the film, Mueller-Stahl's cardinal gives Langdon some advice for his next book. "When you write of this  - and write of this you will," he says with Yoda-like prescience, "be gentle." Just what's needed for a movie about an ancient heretical outfit threatening to blow up the Vatican with a drop of antimatter: a Puritan touch.

In the 1970s, the trash impulse gave us movies like "The Exorcist," "The Omen," and "The Manitou," where the line between sacrament and excrement was unimportant. In "The Manitou," seeing Tony Curtis take on the angry Native American demon growing out of Susan Strasberg's back was a hoot both because and despite of how inane it was. "Angels & Demons" is more conspiracy-minded, but its base antics and profaning of the sacred are trashy.

Even so, Howard and the screenwriters seem to really want to make a case for the grand themes in Brown's book. So just like "The Da Vinci Code," the film goes on for long, discursive stretches in which Langdon and whoever happens to be standing near him volley the Big Ideas. This is beside the point, like getting access to Pamela Anderson and reporting back that she can read.

The delight of Brown's book was entirely backhanded. "Angels & Demons" was crap, but it was exhilarating crap. He wrote with riveting badness. Langdon was pompous, Brown condescending, and the sentences purple enough to give Prince pause! Watching what Howard has done with the book  - covering up the lewdness, blunting the snobbery, and spackling the amazing plot holes  - is dismaying.

This adaptation has the stink of superiority about it. It thinks that by deleting all the sex and playing up the theological struggles it's somehow better than the novel. But Brown writes with glee and gusto, like a man who recently discovered that fingers applied to a keyboard produce words. The novel was a 137-chapter typing spree.

Howard simply isn't as good a filmmaker as Brown is a blissfully terrible writer. He hasn't directed with that kind of joy since "Splash." The self-mocking sense of humor he uses in the political ads he stars in and cameos he makes (Howard recently put in a hilarious appearance in Jamie Foxx's video for "Blame It") never surfaces in his movies. His Oscar has only exacerbated his addiction to prestige commercialism. It's a real problem. He can't make trash or art.

 




Let others sermonize about Angels & Demons . Let voices rise on matters of truth versus fiction, entertainment versus religious heresy, book plot versus screen adaptation, and old hairdo versus new coif in Tom Hanks' portrayal of heroic Harvard scholar Robert Langdon, previously seen irking the Vatican in The Da Vinci Code . What matters to this secular tourist visiting a high altar of bombastic filmmaking is whether this rococo religio-action pic holds together on its own cinematic terms. Lord knows, for all the provocation of its bloodlines-of-Jesus subject matter, the movie version of The Da Vinci Code  fell apart.
So half a hallelujah  this one does work, mostly. At least until the end, when the climactic Hail Mary plot twist might try the patience of a saint, Angels & Demons  barrels along with a confidence  and, more fundamentally, a pulse  missing from director Ron Howard's first encounter with the best-selling novels of Dan Brown. True, the new movie is an opulent-bordering-on-hysterical mass of chitchat and chase scenes. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman pack in highfalutin lectures about art history between gory murders (particularly of men of God) staged with a lust that might challenge a parent's faith in PG-13. But at least there's forward movement here, an energy focused by the necessity of managing two plotlines of equal urgency: Cardinals gathered in Vatican City must elect a new pope following the death of a beloved pontiff. And a ticking time bomb planted by enemies of the church must be found before Rome is blown to kingdom come.
As readers are already aware, Langdon is brought in to decipher telltale squiggles that turn out to be the marks of the Illuminati, an ancient secret brotherhood of wily church haters. (The Vatican hates the Illuminati right back.) Inevitably, the characters who surround the professor have been assembled to lead us astray  to confound our reading of good and evil. It's all the more important, then, that each costar look impressive against a backdrop of lovingly photographed crypts, catacombs, and streets. Ewan McGregor favors a fervent, pious look as the priest who, following the pope's death, acts as head of Vatican City until a successor is chosen. Stellan Skarsgard exaggerates his sour puss as the grumpy head of the Swiss Guard, which is devoted to the pope's protection. Settling for one of his reliably deadpan expressions that mean his man could be good, bad, or both, Armin Mueller-Stahl plays Cardinal Strauss, a smooth old operator in bright red clergy wear.
In contrast, there's little doubt about the goodness (and gorgeousness) of Vittoria, a smart, capable, and sexy-but-demure scientist portrayed by Munich 's Ayelet Zurer. (Vittoria's feminine role is to listen to Langdon explain stuff  stuff she usually already knows but that the audience needs to learn  and occasionally to do some light Latin translation.) By the way, the charismatic guy you won't take your eyes off, the one who plays an assassin, is the great young Danish actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Open Hearts , Brothers ), who's due for stardom.
They're a colorful lot, these angelic and demonic players. But there'd be no point revisiting Dan Brown's Vatican without Hanks: He's reliable and businesslike, as Da Vinci Code  viewers remember him, and he does a nimble impersonation of a resourceful scholar trapped, at one point, in an airless library. But his greatest trick may be one of humankind's simplest: the ability to walk and talk at the same time. Or, in this case, to tear ass and expound simultaneously on church history without sacrificing speed for intelligibility. By Da Vinci Code  standards, this counts as a miracle. B–

 Since “Angels  & Demons” takes place mainly in the Vatican, and is festooned with the rites and ornaments of Roman Catholicism, I might as well begin with a confession. I have not read the novel by Dan Brown on which this film (directed, like its predecessor, “The Da Vinci Code,” by Ron Howard) is based. I have come to believe that to do so would be a sin against my faith, not in the Church of Rome but in the English language, a noble and beleaguered institution against which Mr. Brown practices vile and unspeakable blasphemy.  And it was partly, perhaps, because I chose to remain innocent of the book that I was able to enjoy “Angels  & Demons” more than “The Da Vinci Code,” which opened almost exactly three years ago to an international critical hissy fit and global box office rapture. (The novel “Angels & Demons “was published three years before “The Da Vinci Code.”)  This movie, without being particularly good, is nonetheless far less hysterical than “Da Vinci.” Its preposterous narrative, efficiently rendered by the blue-chip screenwriting team of Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, unfolds with the locomotive elegance of a Tintin comic or an episode of “Murder, She Wrote.” Mr. Howard’s direction combines the visual charm of mass-produced postcards with the mental stimulation of an easy Monday crossword puzzle. It could be worse.  The only people likely to be offended by “Angels & Demons” are those who persist in their adherence to the fading dogma that popular entertainment should earn its acclaim through excellence and originality. It is therefore not surprising that the public reaction so far has been notably calm. Theological hyperventilation has been minimal, and Columbia  Pictures  has not been accused of falsifying the history or corrupting the morals of Western civilization.  L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, has found nothing worthy of rebuke, and who can quarrel with that judgment? In the busy, bloody course of the picture a few hot topical buttons are gently grazed, but in the end (sorry if I’m spoiling anything) “Angels  & Demons” boldly insists that science and religion must coexist, an empirical observation elevated to a statement of principle. Both the persecution of Galileo by the  17th-century church and the more recent (apparently fictional) practice of murdering priests in popular tourist locations in the name of reason are roundly condemned.  It is such killing — undertaken by an anxious grad-student type in the service of an obscure cause — that naturally preoccupies the film’s scholarly hero, the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. Langdon, no favorite of the Holy See and long denied access to the Vatican archives, is summoned to Rome to assess, and then defuse, a deadly threat involving antimatter, papal succession and the ancient pro-science terrorist underground known as the Illuminati. You didn’t suspect the Illuminati? Nobody suspects the Illuminati. Except Robert Langdon of course.  Played by Tom Hanks in his high minimalist mode, his face stroboscopically snapping from wry smirk to worried squint and back again, Langdon is something of a cipher in his own right, a walking embodiment of skeptical intellect who seems, most of the time, not to have a thought in his head. Once again Mr. Hanks is accompanied by a ravishing international movie star, in this case the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer (“Munich,” “Vantage Point”).  She plays Vittoria Vetra, an Italian scientist —  specializing in “bioentanglement physics” — whose role is to serve not as a romantic foil for the sexless professor but rather as his sidekick sleuth and fellow panelist in a high-velocity interdisciplinary seminar.  The high-minded shop talk, half buttressed by real historical information, half floating in the ether of cocktail party nonsense, seems to be a crucial feature of a Robert Langdon adventure, and you can only be charmed when the symbologist says things like: “An obelisk! A kind of pyramid adopted by the Illuminati! If he’s going to kill, he’ll do it here.”  And as an exercise in extreme mass-market tourism “Angels  & Demons” gives pretty good value. Unable to shoot in the Vatican itself, Mr. Howard and his team have deftly blended actual Roman locations with Hollywood stage sets and C.G.I. confections to make a dreamy, ephemeral Eternal City.  The costume and production design — all those red  cardinals’ robes swirling  dervishlike in the incense-tinted light, those sensuous Bernini sculptures and soundless library stacks —  nearly steal the movie from the bland, dogged heroes. Luckily an international squad of potential villains and victims — you’ll figure out who is which soon enough, since Mr. Brown tends to let the wiring show when he rigs his surprise twists — has already carried out the larceny.  Just as “The Da Vinci Code” was rescued, or at least mitigated, by the twinkling nonsense of  Ian McKellen, so is “Angels  & Demons” kicked into something like life by the histrionic professionalism of Armin Mueller-Stahl, Stellan Skarsgard and Ewan McGregor. The three of them are players in a Vatican power struggle that takes shape after the death of a beloved  pope.  His likely successors have vanished, and in trying to find them and prevent Vatican City from being blasted into oblivion, Langdon and  Vittoria  find themselves  in a mare’s nest of hidden agendas and competing jurisdictions. Mr. Skarsgard, commander of the Swiss Guards, and Mr. Mueller-Stahl, a powerful  cardinal, are obvious heavies, while Mr. McGregor has a fine time playing a wide-eyed Irish Obi-Wan with a wee bit of a  messiah complex.  The utter silliness of “Angels & Demons” is either its fatal flaw or its saving grace, and in the spirit of compassion I suppose I’d be inclined to go with the second option. The movie all but begs for such treatment.  “When you write about us,” an erstwhile nemesis says to Langdon near the end, “and you will write about us, do so gently.” It was as if he were looking right into my soul. And how could I refuse such a humble, earnest petition? Go in peace.  “Angels and Demons” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some fairly gruesome deaths.

Science and religion collide, commingle and eventually reach a state of peaceful coexistence in "Angels & Demons," a follow-up to "The Da Vinci Code" in which director Ron Howard conspicuously gives top priority to the story's beat-the-clock thriller elements. Less turgid and aggravating than its predecessor, this cleverly produced melodrama remains hamstrung by novelist's Dan Brown's laborious connect-the-dots plotting and the filmmakers' prosaic literal-mindedness in the face of ripe historical antagonisms, mystery and intrigue. Although unlikely to match the $750 million-plus worldwide haul of the same team's much-maligned 2006 "Da Vinci" sensation, this adaptation of a lesser-known Brown book will nonetheless make an unholy amount of money.
Although "Angels & Demons" was the first novel to feature Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, the film version is sensibly positioned as a sequel to "Da Vinci" in an early scene in which a Vatican emissary requests the professor's help in spite of the existing bad blood. This sequence takes place at a Cambridge swimming pool, enabling it to exhibit Langdon (Tom Hanks) in much fitter condition than he appeared three years ago. He's also clearly changed hairdressers, a good move.
With the last pope dead and the college of cardinals gathered in conclave to elect a new church leader, Rome enters hyper-crisis mode when four eminent cardinals are kidnapped, with the announcement that one will be killed each hour leading up to a bombing that will destroy the Vatican. The culprit, apparently, is the Illuminati, a secret society with roots in the Enlightenment that is now bent on avenging the church's violent attacks against it more than 200 years ago.
Zipped over to Rome with less than 24 hours to piece together arcane clues as to the clerics' whereabouts, Langdon is this time asked to put his talents in service of the Catholic Church, not to dismember it, as in "Da Vinci." Filmmakers are currently getting lots of mileage out of how they were prevented from filming at numerous church-controlled locations in Rome, just as Catholic orgs continue to denounce the picture sight unseen -- the irony being that this story takes the side of the church against those who would destroy it.
In the company of Italian scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), who works for the CERN particle physics lab that produced the canister of antimatter that threatens to blow St. Peter's to kingdom come, Langdon dashes from church to crypt to nave to catacomb, finding freshly killed cardinals and others about to be as he employs his unique expertise to hash out the Illuminati's insidious plan.
Perhaps recognizing how static and talky "Da Vinci" was, Howard and lenser Salvatore Totino this time have the camera thrashing and thrusting about while keeping Langdon constantly on the move and laying Hans Zimmer's thumping score on top. While more superficially stimulating, the adrenalized approach can't hide the utter absurdity of a timeframe that gives the characters just an hour each time to navigate the labyrinths of the Vatican basement archives, figure out what to do next and make their way through crowds and Roman traffic to the location of the next atrocity.
While the minutes tick away, everyone in the inner circle of Vatican power comes under suspicion of being a possible infiltrator, including the late pope's most trusted aide and now Camerlengo, the caretaker of church business in between papal tenures (Ewan McGregor); cagey old Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who's presiding over the papal election; and the belligerent Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard), head of the Swiss Guard. 
Brown's straight-line plotting, streamlined by scenarists David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman, creates some impatience and a hunger for any kind of surprise. The latter is satisfied to an extent by the climax, which, however far-fetched, is visually spectacular and dramatically both evenhanded and unexpected.
Hanks is kept in motion so much, there's hardly time for characterization as such; it's enough that the borderline risible aspects of his character in "Da Vinci" have been eliminated. Zurer takes a while to make an impression but a thoughtful intelligence finally breaks through to favorable effect. McGregor -- like Hanks, looking better than he has in his last couple of films -- is OK as the custodian of church power during the traumatic transition, and Mueller-Stahl keeps his character's hand hidden like an ace poker player.
If, as reported, the production shot in Rome for only two weeks, it sure doesn't show; pic is saturated with local atmosphere, evidently achieved through expert location lensing combined with wizardly sleight-of-hand in the visual effects and production design, especially in the climactic section set in St. Peter's Square. Dark exterior scenes accurately reflect the low lighting levels of much of nocturnal Rome.


At the tail end of The Da Vinci Code, having traipsed around scenic Paris and London for more than two hours to find out whether the Holy Grail was just an old cup or the womanly seed of Jesus and Mary Magdalene , Tom Hanks 's Robert Langdon , ace symbologist, sloped off back to Harvard , though not before wishing the womanly seed (a wan Audrey Tautou ) "Godspeed"—a strange farewell coming from an avowed agnostic, but excellent advice for part deux of the Dan Brown  franchise, which has roughly the same amount of God, but a lot more speed than its predecessor.
Angels & Demons is still no more than another treat for whacked-out male conspiracy theorists, mind you, and at 138 minutes, it's a scant 10 minutes shorter than The Da Vinci Code. But the movie clips along, tricked out with state-of-the-art hardware and a hotter, brighter partner for Hanks in the race against serial prelate–murder by yet another ancient secret society with evil designs on the Vatican . As the enchantingly alliterative particle physicist Dr. Vittoria Vetra , Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer  furrows her brow and wrings her hands over the catastrophic danger posed to the Holy See  by a stolen canister of something nuclear, which she had designed for noble civic use.
And that's just the half of it. The incumbent Pope has died, his tongue has turned suspiciously black, and four of the extremely red cardinals most likely to succeed him have been abducted for medieval branding and/or burning by a wild-eyed predator named "The Assassin" (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), whose most attractive quality is that, unlike the mad albino Paul Bettany  played in Da Vinci  , he's not into mortifying his own flesh. His rimless glasses bespeak a man of intellect, and Langdon, tossing off deconstructed signifiers like Roland Barthes  on steroids, strongly suspects him of membership in the Illuminati, a secret society whose fondness for science has drawn the ire of the Catholic Church for hundreds of years.
Once again, there's much screeching of tires and desperate racing through the underground tunnels of Rome 's lovelier churches. For what it's worth, in the three years since he made The Da Vinci Code, with time off for the intelligently sedate Frost/Nixon, Ron Howard  has grown into a more confident director of florid action sequences. Gift-wrapped in production design lifted from The Godfather and a score by Hans Zimmer  that sounds like the rumbling tummies of a thousand underfed monks, Angels is studded with capably brutal set pieces building to an impressive, if ineffably silly, bit of business involving a helicopter, a parachute, and a huge crowd fighting over stem cell research in St. Peter's Square .
But what of the life of the spirit—even Dan Brown's vulgar spirit, channeled with dismaying fidelity to his ornate prose by David Koepp  and Akiva Goldsman ? Will science trump belief, or will the two lie down together like lambs? Will Honest Bob, the lubricious Dr. V, and half the population of Rome be done in by Illuminati unbound or, worse, by the vicious internal politics of the Vatican? There's no place for anything so retro as character development in the Brown universe—either you're an angel masquerading as a demon, or the other way around. When they're not getting spectacularly knocked off, just about every salient player—from Stellan Skarsgård  as head of the Vatican's Swiss Guard to Ewan McGregor  as the progressive young papal protégé in charge of electing the new Pontiff—waves at the audience to hint that he might be the lone rotten apple in Catholicism's otherwise sound barrel.
Brushing away accusations of factual inaccuracy in an interview with Britain's Radio Times, Hanks gave the movie its most succinct review: "It's not important, but it's fun." Evidently, the Vatican thought exactly the opposite while Howard was shooting—the director has accused the Church of backroom politicking to deny him access to the gargoyles and frescoes of Rome. To my mind, the Holy See got off very lightly. I was dying to ask the two jolly nuns sitting in front of me if they felt insulted, but I couldn't tell whether they were actual sisters in Christ, or Sony plants in drag designed to show that no offense to the Church was meant or taken, or Sacha Baron Cohen  plus one.
