Folks, welcome back to Hazzard County, Ga. Round these parts life moves slower than a key grip with union wages, even when Bo and Luke Duke (Scott and Knoxville) are blowing things up with flaming arrows and Boss Hogg (Reynolds) is grabbing more farmland than you can tear up with 26 Dodge Chargers and a case of moonshine. How can a movie narrated by Junior Brown and backed with wall-to-wall Southern rock � a movie that at one point features co-stars Nelson and Carter tied together, surely a first in celluloid history � be so uneventful? Why, it�s lazier than Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane�s good-for-nothing hound dog, Flash. If you don�t cotton to Simpson�s cleavage, which you�ll see in just about every scene (and which is replaced by the more low-rent jiggle of The O.C.
�s Nikki Griffin when Simpson is absent), there�s just not much going on in these 106 minutes of ain�t-it-cool quasi-nostalgia. The boys jump a bridge; the boys brawl in a roadhouse; we freeze-frame on Scott�s repertoire of "Oh, shit!" expressions. The cast seems to be enjoying themselves � Knoxville could probably enjoy waiting his turn at the Social Security Administration office � but not even Reynolds� Machiavellian capering (minus the Sorrell Booke fat suit) drew a laugh from the audience. Left to fill the void are Baker (give him a few scenes to warm up) and a fo-shizzling nameless inmate in the Dukes� Atlanta holding cell. (Now he
 gives Reynolds something to play against.) Scriptwriter John O'Brien (of last year�s similarly tepid Starsky & Hutch
) drops references to e-mail and The Usual Suspects
 � out of boredom? Would that this movie were trashier than it actually is. You�ll have to wait for the closing credits to see Knoxville stick his ass in Scott�s face. Blink and you�ll miss Rip Taylor! (No confetti.) Director Chandrasekhar (of the Broken Lizard comedy troupe) seems at times overly devoted to the source material � the after-dinner guilty pleasure of a generation, but hardly sacrosanct � yet he somehow manages to simultaneously strip it of whatever joy is to be had watching backwoods parolees stick it to the Man. Instead we transplant the Duke boys to Atlanta for some fish-out-of-water hijinks, and the heavy lifting is left to the crusty old character actors (even Barry Corbin shows up for a spell) and Simpson�s heinie. Which is a lot less fun than it sounds.


As the corrupt Georgia commissioner, Boss Hogg, in the movie version of "The Dukes of Hazzard," Burt Reynolds wears cream-colored three-piece suits that match his teeth. His hair is a shiny silver pelt, and he won't enter a scene unless he can walk off with it.
The movie, sadly, lets him down. There's nothing to steal. "The Dukes of Hazzard" is a cheap, greasy time at the multiplex. You leave annoyed at having been hungry enough to have ever wanted it in the first place.
The film remains faithful to the gamboling spirit of the series. But Jessica Simpson's bodacious contributions notwithstanding, there's just no body. Cousins and moonshine couriers Bo and Luke (Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) race from one vehicular pileup to the next, in the name of stopping Boss Hogg from razing their Uncle Jesse's farm to build a strip mine for coal.
Hogg's scheme manages to rope in a famous homegrown stock car racer who's too good for Hazzard. And it affords the boys a trip to a college campus, which had been like kryptonite to them. Then Luke gets a gander at some of the co-eds.
Simpson, the singer and reality-television wife, plays Daisy Duke, the cousin who's always bailing the boys out of trouble. She acknowledges that her resources are simultaneously ample and limited. Bo and Luke will surely get themselves locked up, "and I'm gonna have to wag my [butt] to get them out," she complains with refreshing awareness.
The movie lets her be as canny as Catherine Bach was in the original show, yet she's still just a tease for the horndogs on the set and in the audience. Her wiles consist of walking up to men in her eponymous short-shorts. Simpson has legs for weeks, and while this is hardly the occasion to evaluate her craft as an actor, she does give her scenes a charge that the movie can't sustain. Every time she knocks our hair back, the film abruptly moves on.
Screenwriter John O'Brien and director Jay Chandrasekhar attempt to bring the Dukes into the 21st century, but their efforts don't pan out. When Bo and Luke leave their backwoods county for Atlanta, they're given grief over the Confederate flag painted on the roof of their car, the General Lee. But the boys' encounters with a house full of randy sorority girls, annoyed African-Americans, and a college science lab just confirm that they're brainless, live-action cartoons. (Though Luke teaches us that the politically correct term for "redneck hillbilly" is "Appalachian American.")
O'Brien was a writer of last year's "Starsky & Hutch," which was a gas because it shrewdly, if crudely, had fun not merely with the premise of the TV series but with the essence of its era. The filmmakers transformed a serious cop show into a wall-to-wall work of kitsch. "The Dukes of Hazzard," by comparison, just feels like an extended lost episode of the original show. (As Uncle Jesse, Willie Nelson does get to revel in his unabashed love for weed, and it's a funny moment that comes far too late in the action.)
The real trouble is that the movie can't determine what type of dumb it would like to be. Raucous? Juvenile? Ironic and knowingly dumb? Is it good-natured? Mean? With bigger or more interesting stars on display, these aren't questions you'd be forced to ask. But Scott and Knoxville are crash-test dummies. They both have stick-on accents, and Scott spends half the movie in a regionally inappropriate Led Zeppelin T-shirt that should have won him a black eye from an Allman brother. His idiot shtick has its amusements, which surface whenever the movie throws a girl in his way. But it's not enough to wrest "The Dukes of Hazzard" from mediocrity.
This is a movie crying out for actors to bend the proceedings to their will, the way Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson might. With the Bo and Luke we get, it's tough to tell whether Scott and Knoxville are in on the joke or the brunt of it.
The worst news is that "The Dukes of Hazzard" arrives thoroughly upstaged by Simpson's cheeky music video for the film. (Given the brevity of her Daisy Dukes, you can take "cheeky" however you like.) The song is a customized version of "These Boots Are Made for Walking," and the video farcically suggests, in three-and-a-half minutes, the exuberant musical hoedown the whole thing should have been, right down to Simpson giving the General Lee a sponge bath in a bikini. The movie itself is 100 minutes of anticlimax.


         "The Dukes of Hazzard" is a film that is not there. It can't really be reviewed because it doesn't really exist. It is not empty calories, which implies pleasure, but simply empty. It's a cosmic void where a movie ought to be.
 
  A collection of promotable elements strung together until it's time for the next show, "Dukes" is vapid even by the standards of the venerable TV series about Southern boys and their toys — rarely confused with "Omnibus" or "Masterpiece Theater" — it's based on. With no plot, character or dialogue worth experiencing, let alone remembering, the film merely occupies space on the screen and hopes for the best.
 


         






    True, there are signs that "Dukes" has been carefully engineered in the hopes of pleasing teenage boys and the grown men who wish high school was eternally in session. But even those who remember being amused by the casualness of the small screen version will find that 104 labored minutes of this material stretches it tighter than Daisy Dukes' celebrated shorts.
 
  The best thing you can say about director Jay Chandrasekhar's version of the 1980s sitcom is that it is good-humored, no small thing in this disagreeable day and age. We return one more time to mythical Hazzard County, "where people are never too busy to say howdy" and adults do more cackling than the entire cast of "Chicken Run."
 
  The film's promotable element No. 1 is that devilish pair of eternally grinning Duke boys, closer to action figures than actual people, good-looking cousins Bo (Seann William Scott) and Luke (Johnny Knoxville). Forever "fightin', fussin' and funnin,' " happiest when they're walloping each other with phone books, the Dukes never saw a problem a car crash couldn't solve.
 
  The boys dote on their ride, the celebrated Dodge Charger nicknamed the Gen. Lee, a.k.a. promotable element No 2. Between racing the back roads, delivering the prime moonshine made by genial Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson) and smooching with girls, preferably all at the same time, the over-subscribed Dukes barely have a minute to call their own.
 
  Promotable element No. 3 is the aforementioned Daisy Duke, played in her screen debut by Jessica Simpson, who's become quite the celebrity for reasons no one seems to remember. Simpson is not a great actress, but then the part of a hot tamale who dresses like a Las Vegas
 cocktail waitress doesn't exactly call for one. What it does call for is someone who understands the dynamics of those famously abbreviated shorts. Simpson worked out for two hours a day and "cut sugar and fried foods out of my diet" just to fit into them. And you thought being "considered an international style icon" was easy.
 
  Having as much chance of besting these good people as Wile E. Coyote had of catching the Road Runner — but still willing to try — is nasty Boss Hogg, played by Burt Reynolds as a parody of a parody of his better performances. The boss is so politically incorrect, he wants to strip mine Hazzard, something that leaves the residents aghast. For shame, Boss, for shame.
 
  The credited writer behind all this feckless piffle is John O'Brien, but members of director Chandrasekhar's Broken Lizard comedy troupe have let it be known that they had a hand in the script. Why anyone would want to boast that they wrote lines like "Man, that rattled my sphincter" is not immediately clear, but Hollywood has always been a strange place.
 
  The only person who thinks "The Dukes of Hazzard" is a substantial piece of work might be its producer, who told the Los Angeles Times, apparently with a straight face, that the film is "a tougher, more subversive movie than one might expect." If you buy that, you probably think Krispy Kreme doughnuts are one tough, subversive food group.
 
  The last word on this non-film film should go to a man who likely has not seen it, cartoonist Wiley Miller of the daily comic "Non Sequitur." A recent strip featured a movie marque reading "Now Showing: Another Lame Movie Version of a 60s Sitcom, as Hollywood Has Completely Run Out of Any Semblance of Creativity and Is Banking on Your Being Too Stupid to Notice." Change the decade, and that about says it all.

Whenever Bo Duke (Seann William Scott) and Luke Duke (Johnny Knoxville), the rowdy, horny, and profoundly literal-minded good-ol'-boy cousins of The Dukes of Hazzard , get into a car chase, which happens to them about as often as most people pull up to a stoplight, you can be relatively certain of one thing: the  General Lee, their orange hot rod with the Confederate flag painted on top, will careen down the road or (more likely) through the woods with such loosey-goosey, no-holds-barred abandon that it zooms ahead at a razory diagonal angle, perpetually in mid-swerve. The movie, likewise, guns forward at a sustained zigzag. It's trash, all right, but perfectly skewed trash  a comedy that knows just how smart to be about just how dumb it is.
Bo and Luke, who sell jars of moonshine manufactured by their grizzled Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), want nothing more out of life than to fight, party, race cars, and chase curvalicious Dixie chicks. The two are loopy cornpone hedonists devoted to the American dream: the pursuit of happiness, white-trash yokel style. Somehow, though, the law has a way of always squashing their freedom, and fighting back is no simple trick. It takes lots of schemes and plans; it takes entire convoluted episodes.
When Luke, with his scuzzy scowl, and Bo, with his maniacal infantile gleam, attempt to break into the safe of Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, a-twinkle with sin), the corrupt commissioner who is plotting to strip-mine Hazzard County, it's a job as tricky as splitting the atom, albeit with somewhat more primitive means. The safe gets dragged by tow truck through the office window, then down the road, where it smashes a bunch of mailboxes, then down the road farther, with Luke pulled along on top of it. A few strategically placed explosives, along with a flaming arrow, finally do the trick, but what gives the sequence its nuthouse kick is that it's staged with utter demented conviction, as the epitome of common sense. In Hazzard County, this is how you bust open a safe, dammit. By any idiotic means necessary.
When it premiered in 1979, The Dukes of Hazzard  looked like the final chapter in the schlockification of TV. It drew on the corporate jiggle of Charlie's Angels , the how-low-can-you-go cheesiness of Fantasy Island , but what gave Dukes  its unique doltish appeal was the innocuous ease with which it co-opted the dregs of '70s outlaw culture. Bo and Luke may have been Ken dolls in Stetsons, but the series, which drew on the New South kitsch of CB radios, Smokey and the Bandit , and the lame-duck aimlessness of the late Jimmy Carter era, had the brain-dead temerity to insist that these plastic hicks were true-blue ''rebels.'' On TV, at least, this is what bad-boy insouciance had come to: beefcake ciphers with paste-on accents sticking it to the man between station breaks.
As a movie, The Dukes of Hazzard  is more fun than it has any right to be, perhaps because it's not a cynical hipster campfest. Unlike, say, the strenuously tongue-in-cheek buddy movie that was fashioned out of Starsky & Hutch , it doesn't condescend to the original show. It hardly needs to: The  condescension is built into the material, and so the director, Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers ), out-hips the hipsters by playing it straight, italicizing the dopiness ever so slightly, letting the throwaway chicanery of The Dukes of Hazzard  wink at itself. He makes the chintzy pleasures of one-dimensional storytelling seem like hog-wild innocence rather than an insult.
Then, too, Chandrasekhar kicks up the series' sexy energy. The car chases are blissful celebrations of movement and flight, cued to the burnt-rubber scorch of '70s Southern-rock chestnuts like the Allman Brothers Band's ''One Way Out'' and Molly Hatchet's ''Flirtin' With Disaster,'' and Scott and Knoxville are a rudely charming pair of low-down freewheelers. When they sneak into a lab at a university in Atlanta, pretending to be Japanese science geeks, the film cuddles up to racism without quite crossing over into it. Bo and Luke are such ingenuous nitwit tricksters that they turn xenophobia into a half-cocked state of grace.
And then, of course, there's Daisy Duke, their perversely wholesome sex-bomb cousin, who uses her willowy assets to ease them out of tight spots. On the show, Catherine Bach got famous for mainstreaming a disco fashion trend, but apart from those butt-cleaving cutoffs, she was a flavorless wedge of cheesecake. Jessica Simpson, with skin as tawny as melted caramel and a smile of joy to rival Julia Roberts', turns Daisy into a vibrantly luscious comic tease. She's Little Annie Fanny as the world's most self-mocking Hooters waitress, and it will be no surprise if Simpson's star keeps rising long after she has hung up her short shorts.

 "The Dukes of Hazzard" is the latest evidence that, for Hollywood studios at least, there can never be too much of a mediocre thing.  Some folks who were in grade school in the late 70's and early 80's may have fond memories of the original CBS series, which caught the tail end of the era's rednexploitation boom, but those people are probably perfectly happy to watch reruns on cable. The series's enduring contribution to the culture was lending the name of one of its secondary characters to cutoff denim shorts. Come to think of it, that may be the reason for this thoroughly pointless big-screen adaptation, which features the enigmatic Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke, the sight of whose body will apparently turn any man in the state of Georgia into a drooling moron.  Which, according to this picture, is a pretty short trip. "The Dukes of Hazzard," directed by Jay Chandrasekhar ("Super Troopers") from a script by John O'Brien ("Starsky & Hutch"),  sells itself as a good-natured exercise in rebel pride, a red-blooded red-state romp replete with moonshine, shotguns, stock car rallies and Southern belles. (There is also, by the way, quite a lot of swearing for a PG-13 movie.) But let's be honest: what this really is is a white-face minstrel show, which happily traffics in stereotypes, hoping that the people being made fun of - white, rural Southerners - will laugh along instead of picketing or writing angry letters. (If the box-office performances of the season's other two big television-recycling movie projects - "The Honeymooners" and "Bewitched" - are any indication, what Southerners and most other Americans are more likely to do is stay home.)  It would help if the movie were actually funny - or if it actually bothered to be a movie, rather than some car chases punctuated by shots of Ms. Simpson sashaying toward the camera (or more often, away from it). There is very little real Southern flavor or humor, though a few supporting performances are amusing (notably Kevin Heffernan as the Dukes' pal Sheev), and some of the automotive mayhem is fun, especially when it partakes of the anarchic spirit of Johnny Knoxville's do-it-yourself "Jackass" stunts.  Mr. Knoxville plays Luke, who rides shotgun in the General Lee, the bright orange Dodge Charger driven by his cousin Bo (Seann William Scott). Mr. Scott (no relation) deploys the same antic, wide-mouthed goofiness he brought to the "American Pie" movies, but with facial stubble as unconvincing as the Southern accent he occasionally tries out. Mr. Knoxville, whose adopted surname is a tribute to his Tennessee hometown, is a bit more credible as a good ol' boy.  Not that authenticity is really the point, notwithstanding the participation of Willie Nelson and of Burt Reynolds, who personified mid-70's Southern macho in movies like "Gator" and of course "Smokey and the Bandit." Mr. Reynolds, in a white Cadillac and a matching ice cream suit, is Boss Hogg, the corrupt local official who is Luke and Bo's nemesis. He is seizing land - including the Duke farm - to convert Hazzard County into a strip mine, and using a hometown racing legend named Billy Prickett (James Roday) to advance his dastardly scheme.  The Duke boys run moonshine for their Uncle Jesse, played by Mr. Nelson with the mellow ease of a man who can earn a paycheck just by showing up. Well, he does a little more than that. He tells a few bad jokes, punches Mr. Reynolds in the face and then sings the old "Dukes of Hazzard" theme song over the final credits and the blooper reel.  "The Dukes of Hazzard" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some leering sexual humor, drug use, profanity and disrespect for law enforcement.

There's a legitimate philosophical argument about whether the world really needs a "The Dukes of Hazzard" movie, but assuming that someone was determined to remake this mediocre but iconic TV show, this is probably as good as it's going to get. Loud, silly but kind of lame-brained fun with car chases aplenty, "Dukes" faithfully plays like an extended episode of the series, albeit with an additional gallon or so of fuel-injected raunchiness. Urban box office appears unpredictable, but hicks don't figure to nix this sticks pic.
Warner Bros. certainly has a bit extra riding on the project, having recently paid $17.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the producer of the 1975 film "Moonrunners" to clear the path to its release. The more risque content, meanwhile, has already earned the disapproval of the actor who first played "Cooter," for what that's worth.
Frankly, though, there wasn't much to the original program, and "Super Troopers" director Jay Chandrasekhar (of the comedy team Broken Lizard) has with only a few exceptions largely eschewed revisionist subtext. "Bewitched," this isn't.
Rather, John O'Brien's script simply juggles and updates elements from the program that made its debut in the 1970s, serving up impressive stunt work, Jessica Simpson squeezed into Catherine Bach's Daisy Duke shorts (its own kind of special effect) and one big-city road trip to Atlanta that delicately expands the concept -- including how a group of African-American youths responds to a bright-orange car named General Lee with a Confederate flag on it.
Other than that, it's the ol' "Dukes" on steroids, down to the familiar narration and complete disregard for property and authority. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are closer-than-brothers cousins Bo and Luke Duke, two "good ol' boys" with an appreciation for fast cars and loose women. Living with Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson) and cousin Daisy (Simpson), they run a moonshine racket and irritate the town-dominating Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) and his corrupt sheriff (M.C. Gainey).
After a slow start, the modest chassis of a plot takes shape, as Hogg orchestrates a high-profile auto race to distract the locals, hoping to push through a plan to consolidate his land holdings and strip-mine Hazzard County. That leaves it to the none-too-bright Bo and Luke, along with their eccentric pals and relatives, to thwart the scheme, evade the law and somehow find time for the race in 105 minutes.
Chandrasekhar wisely dispenses with any pretensions here, realizing it's hard to sell narration that calls Boss Hogg "canny as a fox, tough as a badger" without an unflinching commitment to absurdity. Fortunately, he has a world-class doofus in Scott, who demonstrated this peculiar but highly marketable gift in the "American Pie" movies.
Some of the other performances are a little hit-or-miss (particularly wrestling with them darn Southern accents), and there are arid stretches where yet another mad dash along the back roads starts to feel like a hostage situation.
Still, the unassuming overall approach helps offset those shortcomings -- recognizing that enough leaping Dodge Chargers and interludes like the one involving naughty sorority girls will go a long way with the young-male demo. It's hard not to admire the technical craftsmanship, too, after seeing how many General Lees were damaged in making the film thanks to an outtakes sequence that perfectly underscores the goofy tone the movie seeks.
Beyond stoking appreciation for the stunt driving, those closing outtakes provide a reminder that screwball comedy is hard work. In that respect, credit "Dukes of Hazzard" with managing to make a juvenile romp with free-spirited rednecks go down as smoothly as a slug o' moonshine on a hot August night.

Far be it from me to deny the appeal of sliding across the hood of a car and hopping in through an open window; it's a maneuver scrupulously mimicked by countless syndication-saturated American youths, regardless of state shade. This method of automobile entry, an orange Dodge flying through the air, and the most storied pair of hot pants in modern human history are un-fuck-with-able icons of Hazzard  lore, parts that have taken on greater pop significance than the down-home whole. So wary Dukes  fanslike TV Cooter Ben Jones , who, sight unseen, termed the film a "sleazy insult" on his websiteprepare to witness an amazing feat of filmmaking: Shocked and delighted will you be to see real  Hollywood  actors and real  musicians outperformed by your favorite inanimate objects! Watch smarmy Jackass Johnny Knoxville  dominated by his aviator sunglasses! Enjoy hopelessly sweet chickenhead of the sea Jessica Simpson exuding lacquered fembot hotnessshamed by a pair of shorts! Relish leatherface Burt Reynolds 's capitulation to a bright white suit! And see old Willie Nelson  lose out to a cloud of smoke!
Seann William Scott  is nearly outdone by his car's running monologue (vroom, vroom), but with his amphetamined-ferret mien, he makes idiocy breathtaking. Super Troopers  ' Kevin Heffernan  is the true revelation, though, as the Dukes' dim-witted pal Sheev. Director Chandrasekhar, a Broken Lizard vet, flirts with cultural commentary in freeing the Dukes from their hermetic Appalachia , plopping them in an Atlanta traffic jam, where the Confederate-flag-roofed General Lee   is applauded then reviled by passersby, and later introducing the good ol' boys togaspblack people. But then he punks out, bringing the film back to Hazzard County  for a lame save-the-farm drive. Dukes  insults not "family values," as the original Cooter claims, just general intelligence. Yee. Haw.
