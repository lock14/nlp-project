The Final Season
 follows the story of a small-town high school baseball team. The 100-student school in Norway, Iowa (population just more than 500), is merging with a bigger school. While the principal (Bell) is all for it, the whole town is up in arms. The merger means the end of a team that never loses, and, with 19 consecutive state championships, the town is defined by its baseball. So the principal concocts a strange plan. He recruits a new coach who he believes will lead the team into a losing final season. All this will somehow make the merger more appealing to the townsfolk. Make sense? Doesn�t matter. Little does the principal know that the former girls volleyball coach he recruits (Astin) is actually exactly what the team needs to make their last season a winning one. Based on a true story, the raw elements of the film could potentially result in inspiring power drama. Kind of Hoosiers: Part 2
. But the storytelling is so backassward that it�s impossible to care about any of the characters or really engage in the movie whatsoever. The main emphasis is on allowing the actors to really take their time in delivering such verbal gems as, "you might actually learn something [very pregnant pause], something important.� As executive producer of the film, Astin must have considered this a passion project. And there�s certainly a lot of passion to go around this colorful mess � just no character development or coherent storytelling. Additional plotlines include a love interest (Cook), a rebel (Angarano) who finds his way, and an aging coach (Boothe) struggling to pass the torch. Did I mention Tom Arnold makes a few appearances? The cinematography (by Dan Stoloff) plays like a beautiful Toyota commercial, with lots of boys running through fields and tractors resting against wide Midwestern skies. There are montages galore and a score that�s nearly nonstop. So, if I ever wondered what I should be feeling (which was frequent), there was plenty of music to let me know that, for the most part, I should be feeling inspired. Sadly, it wasn�t nearly enough to do the trick.


The US corn surplus is in no way eased by "The Final Season," an Iowa high school baseball saga that goes heavy on the inspiration, sports-movie cliches, and high-fructose syrup. Based on a true story (aren't they all?), the movie is decent and heartfelt, and it eventually settles into some sharp diamond action, but the small-town homilies are dropped like an anvil. If you thought 1993's "Rudy" was too spare and unsentimental, "Final Season" is for you.
Interestingly, Sean Astin stars in both movies. Here he plays Kent Stock, a girls volleyball coach brought in to oversee the final baseball season at Norway Community High School in 1991. The tiny farming town (pop. 586) has won 19 state championships in 23 years, but a callous administrator (Marshall Bell) is merging the school with a bigger one 20 miles away, firing the team's beloved coach (Powers Boothe) to make his point.
Mr. Meanypants expects the untested Kent to bring the Norway nine down in flames, but he obviously hasn't seen enough underdog sports films. Director David Mickey Evans and writers Art D'Alessandro and James Grayford take the 1986 basketball classic "Hoosiers" as a blueprint, using the lives of the players and their coach to build a portrait of a caring, deeply rooted community.
When it works, "The Final Season" coasts along on earnestness and the memory of better movies. When it doesn't - when the characters are delivering lines like "It's about more than winning. It's about playing the game right" - the film sinks to the level of a Ford commercial. Or maybe Nathan Wang's obnoxious faux-Americana score just makes it seem that way.
The calculus here is Small Town Good, Big City Unspeakably Evil. (The film's not even making it out of suburbs into Boston theaters.) Unfortunately, that approach strands actor Michael Angarano and his character, Mitch Akers, a rebellious Chicago teen sent back to Grandpa's (James Gammon) to larn him some manners and morals. If there's a dramatic turning point between Mitch's James Dean phase and his reincarnation as the Jason Varitek of Iowa, the film doesn't bother to show it.
It does get into some fairly smart baseball toward the end - the music eases up on the Coplandesque fanfares for a few innings, as though hunkering down to watch. "The Final Season" knows when a player would bunt and why (and where), and it knows the hard-won miracles of infield defense. Somebody here understands that such things can be more validly moving than heartland platitudes.
Young ballplayers and grandparents should enjoy the movie, then, and those who prefer their championship seasons more predictable than anything unfolding at Fenway tonight. Respectful and old-fashioned to a fault, "The Final Season" wants simply to be the Best Picture of 1952.



There's not quite as much corn in "The Final Season" as there is in the Iowa farm fields that run through it, but it's close. The quintessential sports movie (beleaguered players overcome adversity and summon up the grit to win), this David Mickey Evans-helmed cockle-warmer is overscored, underwritten sometimes awkwardly shot, but for the most part capably acted and armed with a story that's a sure thing. Film, too, could be a B.O. winner with the right support from the bullpen.
Based on the true story of the Norway High School Tigers, who won 20 straight Iowa state baseball championships before their school was deemed redundant, "The Final Season" recounts that ultimate 20th season -- when longtime coach Jim Van Scoyoc (Powers Boothe) was fired, his assistant Kent Stock (Sean Astin) took over, and the team was all but relegated by the public to the dustbin of schoolboy sports history.
Astin is solid as the sober, plucky Stock, who is being set up for defeat by school board president Harvey Makepeace (Marshall Bell), the main proponent of a merger with the larger Madison school system. This would destroy the Norway kids' baseball tradition, and the town's identity along with it, as Harvey thinks a losing season will make the merger an easier sell.
"I don't know why anyone would want to destroy something that means so much to these kids," says Van Scoyoc. Indeed, the answer is never quite made clear; Harvey is pure villainy, without much of an articulated motive.
But there's more amiss in "The Final Season" than one character's motivation. With more plots than Forest Lawn, the film creates a virtual gridlock of intersecting narratives: Van Scoyoc is the crusty vet, Stock the natural but unproven leader; that's one story. School board adviser Polly Hunt (a very nice Rachael Leigh Cook) provides a love interest for Stock; that's another. Then there's sullen hipster teen Mitch Akers (Michael Angarano), who's been dragged to Norway by his dad (Tom Arnold).
Mitch's struggle to fit in -- he ultimately joins the team -- is a movie of its own, although the filmmakers don't seem to have had Angarano and Arnold around long enough to make full use of them. Meanwhile, the team wins, loses and lurches toward the finals, with Kent inspiring his squad with lines like, "How do you want to be remembered?"
What "The Final Season" doesn't do, despite all its impassioned pleading on behalf of Norway baseball, is make a solidly convincing argument why the concerns of 20-odd baseball players should determine the fate of a school system. Yes, the town is proud of its team, its players and its years of trophies, but should sports really determine how everyone is educated? It's an instance of filmmakers being so sure of their case they assume auds will come along.
Production values are often subpar. The shooting is unimaginative and the editing is rough; Angarano at one point hits a ball in a batting cage while looking the wrong way, and a fantastic catch toward the end of the film is set up, via cutting, to be a physical impossibility. The loudest flaw, though, is the� music, which is grand, heroic and as subtle as a fungo bat to the head;� infield practice is scored like the burning of Atlanta.�
