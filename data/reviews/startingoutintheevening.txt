As Leonard Schiller, a once-revered, now quasi-forgotten literary lion of the Upper West Side, Frank Langella gives a performance that is so layered with mourning and wit and experience that, for once, an acting-showcase movie lives up to its promise. Schiller is measuring out his life in typewriter strokes when a brilliant, adoring graduate student (Lauren Ambrose) enters his world. Their relationship flirts with sex, but it's so much more. Andrew Wagner has made a lovely comedy of death and rebirth.

 A crepuscular glow suffuses “Starting Out in the Evening,” Andrew Wagner’s intelligent, careful adaptation of a near-perfect novel by Brian Morton. This is not only a matter of the cinematography — digital video given an unusual burnish by Harlan Bosmajian, the director of photography — or of the setting. Late in the day, the sun slanting down over the North American mainland cloaks the brick and limestone of the Upper West Side of Manhattan in a somber, serious light that may, more than anything else, explain the area’s reputation for deep and lofty thought.  One of Mr. Wagner’s themes (and also Mr. Morton’s) is the waning of that old, literary New York, the twilight of an idea of the city as a capital of the modern mind. Leonard Schiller, one of the main characters, is a retired teacher and all-but-forgotten novelist. His four completed novels are long out of print, and we find him, in his  70s, pecking slowly away at a fifth.  Not that he feels sorry for himself or solicits our pity. No, Leonard, as embodied by Frank Langella, is a picture of old-fashioned decorum and steadfast dignity. There is a certain kind of man who will not leave his house without putting on a tie. Leonard wears one, firmly knotted in a crisp white collar, at his writing desk or his kitchen table.  His routine, which is also the slow unwinding of his life, is interrupted by Heather Wolfe (Lauren Ambrose), an ambitious young graduate student who wants to write a master’s thesis on Leonard and then also, perhaps, reintroduce him to the reading public. He is both flattered and unnerved by the attention — which is more than simply scholarly — but to say too much about what happens between them would risk spoiling one of the most delicate and peculiar romances recently depicted on film.  The romance is not only, indeed not primarily, between them, but between each of them and an exalted notion of literature, a passion that the film honors but does not sentimentalize. Writing and reading do not make Leonard and Heather better than they might otherwise be —  they may have the opposite effect — or even more complicated.  Ariel (Lili Taylor), Leonard’s nonliterary daughter, is in some ways the most complex character in the story, her temperament a thicket of contradictory impulses and desires. Approaching 40, she wants to have a child but finds herself drawn back into a relationship with Casey (Adrian Lester), whose resistance to parenthood had been the cause of their earlier breakup.  Those four people — Leonard, Heather, Ariel and Casey — pretty  much constitute the film’s universe. But even though it is less populous than Mr. Morton’s novel (which featured a cameo from the literary critic Alfred Kazin and a few more fictitious old-timers to keep Leonard company), the adaptation, with a screenplay by Mr. Wagner and Fred Parnes, rarely feels unduly claustrophobic or rarefied. Allusions and incidents that evoked the milieu of Leonard’s younger days, and the texture of his mind, have been pruned away. But in their place is the marvelous fact of Mr. Langella, who carries every nuance of Leonard’s experience — including his prodigious, obsessive reading — in his posture and his pores.  There are not too many screen performances that manage to be both subtle and monumental. Watching Mr. Langella’s slow, gracious movement through “Starting Out in the Evening,” I was reminded of Burt Lancaster in Luchino Visconti’s adaptation of “The Leopard.” In some ways the comparison is absurd — Visconti’s film is a sweeping historical symphony, while Mr. Wagner’s is a stately string quartet — but both movies concern an old man who has outlasted the social order in which his life made sense. And what is so remarkable about Mr. Langella is that he seems to hold Leonard’s intellectual cosmos inside him, to make it implicit in the man’s every gesture and pause.  Instead of nostalgia, “Starting Out in the Evening” offers a clear-eyed elegy for that world. It also notes the persistence, personified by the seductive, uncertain Heather Wolfe, of the urge to connect to experience through the written word. Ms. Ambrose is self-assured enough to hold her own with Mr. Langella and Ms. Taylor (whose sister-in-law she played on “Six Feet Under”)  and brave enough to show the vain, insecure, unformed aspects of Heather’s personality. The character’s evident immaturity shows that the actress is wise beyond her years.  And wisdom — the chastened acceptance of limitation, the resolve to keep going anyway — is the subject of this fine, modest film. Not everything in it works — the score, for one thing, is vulgar and obvious in a way that Leonard Schiller would never tolerate in his own writing or anyone else’s — but it has the quiet beauty of a late afternoon, late in the autumn, when New York seems to be not just the center of the world but the crystallization of its finest tendencies.  “Starting Out in the Evening” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity, sexual situations and references to the work of D. H. Lawrence.

Director Andrew Wagner draws topnotch work from a pro cast in "Starting Out in the Evening," a wise, carefully observed chamber drama about an elderly novelist whose daily routine is interrupted by the arrival of a young grad student with more than academics on her mind. While its New York lit-world setting, focus on aging and preference for intelligent dialogue over kinetic action will do little to create a feeding frenzy among potential distribs, this small yet deeply resonant pic should be embraced by upscale arthouse auds and spark awards talk for star Frank Langella.
A contemporary of Saul Bellow and Delmore Schwartz, Leonard Schiller (Langella) hasn't been the same man since his wife died, and even less so since he suffered a heart attack. His four novels are out of print, and his fifth has been sitting in his typewriter for more than a decade.
One day, Heather Wolfe (Lauren Ambrose) shows up wanting to interview Schiller for her master's thesis and, not the sort to take "no" for an answer, tells Schiller's daughter, Ariel (an excellent Lili Taylor), that she plans to "reintroduce your father's work to the world." And if, at first, Heather seems a touch naive -- the scenes of her caressing Schiller's writing desk as though it were the shroud of Turin are a bit much -- Ambrose soon shows us the naked ambition lurking behind her character's wide, sparkling eyes.
Heather's passion for Schiller's words is genuine, and as she asks the old man about his life and work, he warms to her in measures that are as unhurried as the sun creeping towards the horizon. First, there is merely a clasping of hands. Later, in a scene that Langella plays with a sublime mixture of bafflement and desire, she teasingly spreads a dollop of honey across his forehead. Finally, in a moment of exquisite tenderness and carefully controlled eros just prior to a strategically placed fade out, they lie down together fully clothed while he moves his hands along the length of her body, seeming to touch her without ever making contact.
Like "Venus" (to which it will surely invite comparisons), "Starting Out in the Evening" skillfully navigates the terrain of a relationship pitched somewhere between master-pupil and May-December. But Wagner's pic, which was adapted by the director and Fred Parnes from Brian Morton's novel, is a knowing portrait of three complex individuals of very different ages, all of whom feel the breath of Father Time at their necks. For Schiller, there is the challenge of finishing his novel against the deadline of his own mortality. For the 40-year-old Ariel, there's the desire to have a child before her biological clock ticks its last fitful beats. And for Heather, there's the dilemma of wanting to write serious literary criticism in a cultural climate where seriousness is ever less appreciated.
Wagner, who made stars out of his parents and siblings in his 2005 Sundance entry "The Talent Given Us," keeps those competing storylines in a delicate balance, and the result is a sophomore film of unusual maturity and confidence -- the work of a filmmaker with a sure grasp of his characters and an appreciation for the untidiness of lives that fall short of their bearers' expectations. And if, on their surfaces, Wagner's two films to date bear little in common, upon closer inspection they are both tough-minded studies in the complex relationships between parents and children, and the ways in which our bodies betray us as we age.
In a career-crowning performance, Langella plays Schiller with utter vulnerability and lack of vanity -- the former seducer whose stage Dracula made women swoon here invests himself fully in the part of a man weakened by illness and regret. At times, he appears to be acting only with his eyes, the rest of his body as unbending as a petrified oak; yet he commands our deepest attention from first frame to last.
Made on location in New York City on a tight 18-day schedule, pic sports impressively high production values, notably d.p. Harlan Bosmajian's elegant soft lighting schemes and production designer Carol Strober's warm, lived-in interiors.

In Starting Out in the Evening , a new film by Andrew Wagner , a pneumatic graduate student spreads honey over the face of the elderly New York novelist she's trying to seduce. Later, the two will lie down on his bed with their hands by their sides, and later still, he will slap her face, lightly but definitively. If you've seen Wagner's sly family comedy The Talent Given Us , you'll know that he's very skilled at goofy moments like this. But in Starting Out , the snapshots are uncharacteristic and sparely used, punctuating the quieter but more telling gestures in this novelistic film. Faithful in style and spirit to the award-winning novel by Brian Morton , which Wagner adapted with Fred Parnes , this wise, observant, and exquisitely tacit chamber piece complicates every May-December, academic-novel cliché in the book.
A mutually dependent relationship unfolds between Leonard Schiller  (Frank Langella ), an old-school writer of the Bellow-Roth-Howe generation of realists, and Heather (Six Feet Under  's Lauren Ambrose ), the eager-beaver Brown University  grad who worms her way into Leonard's life and tries to persuade him that her forthcoming master's thesis on his work will put a new shine on the old man's dusty reputation.
When Heather, a thief in more ways than one, bursts in on Leonard's cramped, poorly lit Manhattan apartment with her long red hair and chipmunk cheeks, the long-widowed writer is putting the finishing touches to a manuscript 10 years in the making that no hip publisher will even look at. Langella is superb, at once held-in and intensely physical in his rendition of this proudly anachronistic man, a shell imprisoned in his impressive bulk and formal suit, with only the slightly hunted look in his otherwise blank eyes revealing a fear that his day may be done.
Starting Out in the Evening  is about people who are just ticking over, not just Leonard but his devoted, equally becalmed daughter Ariel (Lili Taylor ), whom he loves but distractedly holds at arm's length. A former dancer and Pilates instructor whose biological clock keeps murmuring "pushing 40," Ariel is girlish and eager to please in the awkward way of women who have fallen behind in the business of finding an adult identity to grow into. (She tiptoes in and out of her dad's apartment bearing soup.) Her lack of self-definition also makes her both a victim and an exploiter of poorly chosen men, notably a similarly under-evolved former boyfriend (Adrian Lester ) whose re-entry into Ariel's life earns the reflexive disapproval of her father, even as he succumbs to the blandishments of a woman less than half his age.
Like Heather, Wagner went to Brown, and his grasp of the clash between old and new academe is witty and quietly assured. But if there's little question about whose side he and Morton are on, neither world gets off lightly, or without sympathy. Callow, ambitious, and raring to connect the dots between what she thinks she knows about Leonard's life and his art (the movie takes a discreet swipe at dirt-driven magazine writing in the form of a canny Village Voice   editor nicely underplayed by Jessica Hecht ), Heather is a parasite. But she's a useful one, for Leonard, with his fastidiousand, did he but know it, terrifiedwithdrawal from the world, is the embodiment of snooty ivory-tower detachment. Heather may not know as much as she thinks about Leonard's life, but she galvanizes him, albeit with a high cost to them both.
If Starting Out  is a movie about how little we know and how much we presume, it is also about transformation, about heartbreak and halting renewal. There's no vulgar equivalence between Leonard and Heather, and when it comes down to it, Starting Out in the Evening comes down squarely on the side of the old-fashioned literary life. Yet if Leonard may be kept going (and kept out of print) by "the madness of art," he can't proceed without the painful recognition that, as he ruefully puts it, his characters haven't been doing anything interesting. He's always known that the unexamined life is not worth living. Heather may be an intellectual and emotional thief, but she has forcefully awakened Leonard to the fact that the unlived life may not be worth examining.
