This overlong, lurchy homage to John Cassavetes' 1980 film Gloria  is a mess, but a fascinating one, given Swinton's desperately avid performance in the title role. The star flings herself into the skin of a wild alcoholic in L.A. who kidnaps a kid (Aidan Gould) for ransom and winds up in Mexico  there's a splashy scene when she crashes her car through to Tijuana. Nothing coheres in Erick Zonca's movie, Julia , only his second since his striking 1998 debut, The Dreamlife of  Angels ; halfway through, Julia becomes a competent, rather than pass-out, drunk. But just try to take your eyes off her. B–

 There are few film  actresses working today who can embrace the extremes of beauty and ugliness as persuasively as Tilda Swinton, and fewer still, I suspect, who have the guts to try. She’s a magnificent, bold, sometimes viscerally  uncomfortable screen presence, with an otherworldly alabaster glow and a piercing gaze that seems to nail you to your seat. (She’s one of the few  performers who justifies that overworked critical superlative,  riveting.) When she’s on screen, you don’t want to look anywhere, even if the story is so bleak, so utterly and overwhelmingly pitiless that you want to look anywhere but  at the screen, at anyone but her.  There are about 20 minutes in her latest, “Julia,” a venture in extreme acting and audience provocation in which she plays an alcoholic child-snatcher, when I wanted to split the theater.  Directed by Erick Zonca, who seems to have signed a mutually assured destruction pact with his star, pushing her toward an abyss both might have fallen into, the film is a perverse blend of sadism (the director’s, Julia’s) and masochism (ours, Julia’s). But Ms. Swinton demands to be seen even when her character is on a self-annihilating bender so real that you can almost smell the stink rising off her. So I sat in my seat, cursed the screen   and was grateful to watch an actress at the height of her expressive power claw toward greatness.  Claw, crawl, stumble, scurry, fly like a bat out of this hell — Ms. Swinton does it all. She’s yelling with pleasure  in the first shot, a gaudy image of her at a Los Angeles nightclub that Mr. Zonca frames from a slight remove so that the camera (and us along with it) has some distance from  her. She’s exquisite, with long,  spidery eyelashes and a wide-open laugh. Everything looks different with the lights turned low,  and so does Julia as she gulps her drinks and finally gives the nod to a guy who cannot believe his luck. But that gulping mouth is more of a maw and in time the lights go up, brutally. The next morning, the glamour is smeared all over her face.  For Julia, every morning is another ugly morning after. Not that she seems to notice or care. Her whole life is organized around booze, about getting to that moment when she’s throwing another one back either alone or in a crowd, it doesn’t matter. There’s no pride here, no real friends, save for the alcohol, which is always there, keeping her company. The one person in her life, Mitch (Saul Rubinek), moons about, trying to help keep her real-estate job (at the pointedly named Reality House) and goading her toward sobriety meetings she refuses to sit through. When a woman at one meeting introduces herself, saying they’re neighbors, Julia fires back, “I’m not really down with the good neighbor” thing.  No kidding.  At first, “Julia” seems to be shaping up as a portrait of an alcoholic nearly scraping bottom. The early, naturalistic scenes slip into one another seamlessly with no obvious dramatic arc, which fits with a life that feels similarly unstructured. But the story shifts gears soon after the neighbor, Elena (Kate Del Castillo), drags a passed-out Julia home one evening. The next morning, Elena spins a wild tale. Her only son, Tom (Aidan Gould), is being raised by his wealthy grandfather who refuses to let her visit the boy. But Elena has a plan and, she claims, money, and will pay Julia to kidnap Tom, whom she will then spirit off. Julia doesn’t just listen to Elena’s far-fetched scheme, she also follows through on it.  What transpires  is so ludicrous, so improbable and so appallingly messy that it actually registers as far more realistic than most movie crimes, like one of those ghastly news stories about a crazy woman who runs off with someone else’s baby for love or money or just because she’s nuts. The smell of money seems to unhinge Julia, who, after a lifetime of self-destruction, decides she deserves a break. (From what? Herself?) The kidnapping is a disaster, horrible and difficult to watch  because it’s always difficult to watch  a child in distress,  and the young actor makes his character’s fear   palpable. It doesn’t help that Mr. Zonca is a  French filmmaker  — there isn’t a Hollywood beat in his storytelling —  which means that any bad thing could happen. That’s a joke, but also true.  However heart-thuddingly real, the crime and some motel scenes that follow are so tonally relentless, so claustrophobic and harrowing that I found myself pushed right out of the movie. It was hard to get back in, particularly after Julia runs over a guy  with a car, not once, but twice, a scene that drives  the film dangerously toward self-parody. But Mr. Zonca, whose best-known feature  is the 1998 drama “The Dreamlife of Angels,” pulls back from the edge just in time, largely by channeling John Cassavetes’s “Gloria,” about another tough broad (Gena Rowlands, who else?) on the lam with a kid. Ms. Swinton doesn’t have Ms. Rowlands’s tenderness, but, damn,  she has just about everything else you need or want.  “Julia” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Graphic violence.

Admittedly inspired by John Cassavetes� �Gloria� and its gritty central perf by Gena Rowlands as a tough-talking dame on the run with a little kid, the miscalculated and overlong �Julia� proves a startling misfire for �The Dreamlife of Angels� writer-helmer Erick Zonca and dependably fearless actress Tilda Swinton. Stateside chances are negligible for this English-language, Los Angeles-set pic (set to open in France on March 12) that uncomfortably welds an arthouse sensibility to genre tropes.
A swaggering floozy with a monumental drinking problem, 40-ish Julia Harris (Swinton) staggers from one booze-fueled hookup to the next. When she�s fired from her job, her ex-b.f. Mitch (Saul Rubinek) pleads with her to slow down and attend AA meetings.
When a ditzy fellow attendee, Elena (Kate del Castillo), begs Julia to help kidnap her son Tom (Aidan Gould), whom Elena is not allowed to see, it�s a measure of Julia�s sheer desperation that she goes along with the plan -- or what passes for a plan. Julia ends up with Elena�s boy stuffed in her trunk, engineering inept ransom negotiations with the boy�s never-seen industrialist grandfather and eluding some Mexican lowlifes when she literally crashes her car across the border to Tijuana.
Everything feels emotionally skewed in Zonca�s English-language debut. Pic�s first half-hour yields precious little flavor of the Los Angeles milieu (shifted from Cassavetes� beloved New York); scenes awkwardly improvised at an emotional fever pitch go on far too long; and sequences in which the boy is held at gunpoint or hogtied to motel-room water pipes are uncomfortably exploitative. 
Helmer made his rep as an eloquent portrayer of marginalized French young people caught up in the tumult of day-to-day existence, and vestiges of that remain here. Yet pic is defeated by a tin ear for the kind of slangy, musical English dialogue that made Cassavetes� films what they are. Last reels devolve into a series of screaming matches between Julia and the absurdly exaggerated Mexican toughs.
As she seems to do with each successive role, Swinton becomes the character with a fierce alchemy. Unfortunately, by the time Julia is actually meant to care for the boy, the redemption feels more convenient than emotionally earned. Pic�s most authentic perf is turned in by German-born Canadian mainstay Rubinek, whose monologue about striking his child while drunk during a long-ago marriage marks a rare moment when pic is firing on all cylinders. 
Tech credits are pro, led by Yorick Le Saux�s crisp widescreen lensing.

Tilda Swinton  doesn't merely act the title role in French director Erick Zonca 's Julia —she devours it, spits it back up, dances giddily upon it, twirls it in the air. It's a big, all-consuming performance, and in the hands of a lesser actress and filmmaker, it might have consumed the movie, too. But Julia  is nearly as electric as its heroine, a leggy, vodka-guzzling tart in false eyelashes and cheap sequined gowns who tells men she can make their dreams come true, and who can, provided those dreams involve parking-lot sex and sunlight-blasted mornings after. The key to Swinton's performance (and to the movie) is that she's playing an actress—not a professional one, but a wily, desperate woman under the influence who adapts herself to what each new situation calls for, sometimes well, sometimes badly, but always with every fiber of her being. Her faces are many, including the eerie black death mask she wears when she agrees to help her unstable Mexican neighbor (the superb Kate del Castillo) kidnap her young son from the clutches of his wealthy grandfather. It's a crackpot scheme made more so by Julia's half-cocked attempt to secure herself a bigger share of the ransom money, and by the time the movie winds its way from Los Angeles to Tijuana , one kidnapping gives way to another with no end in sight. Directing his first theatrical feature in the decade since the neo-Bressonian The Dreamlife of Angels , Zonca tips his hat to the entire John Cassavetes  oeuvre while crafting a messy, nervy, and frequently exhilarating thriller that operates on instinct rather than plot and features richly pulpy dialogue by Zonca and co-screenwriter Aude Py. Jeered upon its premiere at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival  and only now receiving a token U.S. release, Julia  demands to be reassessed and reckoned with.
