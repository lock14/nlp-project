In "The Reaping," Hilary Swank endures the 10 biblical plagues and takes on a backwoods Satanic cult. Having faced killer homophobes in "Boys Don't Cry" and deadly bedsores in "Million Dollar Baby," the two-time Oscar winner would seem perfect for the job of snuffing out evil.
But this long-delayed, pitiful excuse for a horror film feels like penance for her great success. She's all wrong for this sort of effects-drenched disaster picture, anyway. To get a sense of the incongruity, imagine Sally Field in her prime carrying, say, 1985's "Howling II."
"The Reaping" does have a kernel of campy promise. Swank plays professor Katherine Winter , an ex-missionary minister who, after losing her entire family in some Sudanese blood rite, trots the globe using science to debunk supposed miracles. She's a merciless, atheistic Lara Croft, kicking the poor and the hopeless while they're down. But since this is the rare horror film about the power of belief, we quickly know she'll have the bejesus scared back into her by the time it's over.
After overturning her 48th purported miracle in Chile, Katherine returns home to Louisiana State University, where she's greeted by David Morrissey , last seen opposite Sharon Stone in "Basic Instinct 2 ." He plays a schoolteacher who provides Katherine with her biggest case yet.
A river in his little bayou town, hilariously called Haven , flows with blood, and the townsfolk have placed the blame on a blond girl (AnnaSophia Robb ) who was found nearby with her dead brother. They think she murdered him.
The schoolteacher tells Katherine that the town is convinced this is the start of the plagues. Sure enough, when she arrives with her co-worker Ben (Idris Elba ), a practicing, religiously tattooed Christian, the countdown begins: a hail of frogs, a swarm of locusts, diseased livestock, nasty boils on the skin, etc.
In Exodus , the plagues were calamities that God wrought on the Egyptians for enslaving the Israelites . But Katherine is unmoved, offering a perfectly natural rationalization for it all. Such explanations require Swank to speak in paragraphs that illuminate her literacy but not her talent.
She may rely on facts, but Katherine's unconscious has a mind of its own. She has nightmares of the Sudan and sex fantasies about the schoolteacher. She also has to figure out why her old priest friend (Stephen Rea , looking suitably embarrassed) keeps insisting she's in danger.
The screenplay by Carey W. Hayes and Chad Hayes (they wrote that 2005 "House of Wax" remake), never credibly explains what's going on. Not after one viewing -- and that was enough for me, thank you. None of what we discover is ever interesting enough to make us care . The story vaguely cribs from "The Wicker Man ," "Rosemary's Baby ," "The Exorcist ," and "The Omen ," but doesn't come close to the lasting fright of any of those titles. And why drag Louisiana or Sudan into any of this, only to portray the people who live there as insultingly backward ?
Stephen Hopkins directs "The Reaping" according to the Satanic horror manual, right down to the choral chanting on the soundtrack. The lighting is often too dark to see what's happening, and the editing makes a mess of even the most tolerable scenes (the locust attack, for example). Like most of these movies, the film is cut like a trailer for a horror flick instead of being a horror flick proper. And the staging of the final sequence is laughable. Surrounded by explosions, and computer effects worthy of any Atari game, the actors appear to be standing around while a wind fan blows .
Swank, of course, is a trouper, playing a part meant for 
an actor with a quarter of her fame and half her Oscars. But would Sarah Michelle Gellar even have dared?


Katherine Winter, played by Hilary Swank in her dutiful-yuppie- good-listener mode, is a former minister, and now a professor, who travels the world defusing the lustrous credibility of miracles. Swank must know the feeling: She has won two Academy Awards, and she's still doing movies like The Reaping . Katherine is summoned to the sleepy Bible Belt backwater of Haven, La., and the first thing she confronts is a river of blood  a pretty cool image, to be sure, though Katherine is certain there's a rational explanation for it. To her, science can explain everything, and she hews to that belief (which is really a lack of Belief, you see), at one point delineating how the 10 biblical plagues were all natural phenomena. This woman could witness the parting of the Red Sea and think, without hesitation, that it should be reported to the Weather Channel.
In The Reaping , every one of those biblical plagues appears, but they can't be accounted for by science, only by studio executives who theorize that an apocalyptic ''religious'' horror movie is the perfect way to tap into the evangelical market. (It sure beats the PG-rated piffle released by FoxFaith films.) Having seen the error of her ways (science = bad!), our heroine finds the reverence to battle frogs, dead cows, locusts, and  just to hedge the movie's bets  a spooky blond girl who could be Satan's messenger. But no belief on earth can rescue Swank from a film that's a chain of disaster chintz masquerading as a sermon.

 The tagline for the inane horror flick “The Reaping” asks, “What hath God wrought?”  The question really should be addressed to Warner Brothers, the studio releasing this schlock-o-rama, and all those clever little gnomes in Hollywood who keep trying to squeeze boffo opening weekends from even the lamest horror premise. The only remotely notable thing about this particular jumble of boos, bangs and door creaks, swaying Spanish moss, creeping blond kids and swelling décolletage, creatively presented from various angles in various contexts, is that it tries to wed the horror trend with the heated-up God market.  That décolletage, alternately swelling and heaving, belongs to Hilary Swank, who as Katherine Winter, a faith-bound minister turned science-crazed miracle-buster, travels the world debunking signs of grace. Katherine turns feasts into fish, wine into H2O and her findings into a lesson plan for her students at Louisiana State University, where she works side-by-side with the crucifix wearing-and-fondling Ben (Idris Elba). When the film opens, the miracle-busters are investigating an event in Santiago, Chile, where the mumbling, mesmerized faithful have taken to adoring the decades-old corpse of a priest that, for one worshiper, is literally finger-licking good. Sure enough, Katherine discovers it isn’t the waxy corpse that’s making the faithful twitch and howl, but rather fumes from a local oil refinery. Case closed.  Not so the movie, which goes on and on, largely due to a smiling stranger, Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey), who brings Katherine news of strange doings in a secluded bayou town called Haven. Armed with their lab equipment, computers and his-and-hers faith and doubt, the miracle-busters plunge first into a river that has recently turned the color of blood and then into a fast-rising tide of nonsense involving motorcycle toughs and Satanic love, shaky accents and sweaty sheets. There’s a strange girl who used to live in the village of the damned and a fat man parading a white suit and bluster redolent of Burl Ives. There are falling frogs, buzzing flies, crawling lice and really mad cows. Alas, there are also five other plagues.  To judge from the landscape shots, the director Stephen Hopkins would have done better shooting a cable show for National Geographic. He frames his star almost as attractively, which is smart because the always-game Ms. Swank has little to do here but look pretty. But there’s nothing to be done with the screenplay by Carey W. Hayes and Chad Hayes (“House of Wax”), which, at least in its onscreen manifestation, bags and sags without finding a core reason for being.  The invocations of God and the Devil are especially unfortunate, because they’re at once opportunistic and pusillanimous, and because they serve to remind you, again and again, that you’re watching this hooey, not “Rosemary’s Baby.” The allusion to Hurricane Katrina, on the other hand, is just tacky.  “The Reaping” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Discreet sex, overt blood and some way-ugly boils.

Few recent studio horror pictures have courted (or, depending on one's perspective, pandered to) a Christian audience as blatantly as "The Reaping." Revisiting the book of Exodus in a feverish Southern-gothic context, this lurid, often ludicrously entertaining slab of Biblesploitation builds an earnest case for spirituality in a skeptical age. As demonstrated by the thematically similar "The Exorcism of Emily Rose," there's an audience for this kind of faith-based sensationalism, and the chance to see righteous acts of Old Testament payback spectacularly re-enacted on the bigscreen should help Warner Bros. reap solid theatrical turnout, with an even richer ancillary harvest.
From a commercial standpoint, it's entirely understandable (if sadly telling) that the horror film has become Hollywood's primary vehicle for addressing matters of faith. Still, even among the religio-horror ranks, "The Reaping" stands out for its bold advertising ("What hath God wrought?" scream the posters) and its loony conviction as it rains down all 10 of the biblical plagues -- frogs, lice, boils et al. -- on a small Louisiana backwater town called Haven.
With the ostensibly God-fearing locals whipped into hysterics, schoolteacher Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey) enlists the aid of university professor Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank), who sees it as her mission to investigate and debunk "miracles" with scientific explanations.
So when Katherine arrives in Haven with devoutly religious partner Ben (Idris Elba) and finds the river has turned blood-red, she immediately begins speculating about pH imbalances and toxins in the water. But the villagers blame a clan of alleged devil-worshippers living in the nearby woods, specifically their young daughter, Loren (the gifted AnnaSophia Robb).
While the script by brothers Chad and Carey Hayes ("House of Wax") gives nonbeliever Katherine some rhetorical ammo -- her fiercely rational explanation for the Egyptian plagues is certainly something to hear -- it's obvious that this stone-hearted skeptic will be on her knees before the movie's over. Crudely inserted flashbacks reveal that Katherine was once a missionary in the Sudan, but turned her back on God after her husband and daughter were murdered.
Working with visual effects supervisor Richard Yuricich, helmer Stephen Hopkins ("The Life and Death of Peter Sellers") is clearly having fun staging modern-day acts of God (or is it Satan?) on a CG-enhanced widescreen canvas. Never mind rivers turning red; Cecil B. DeMille would've turned green to see this stuff. Most artfully visualized is the plague of locusts, first viewed from inside a house as the windows ominously darken, the computerized critters crawling about in a state of eerie calm before the inevitable frenzied attack.
Trouble is, plagues fall more in the realm of spectacle than scares, and to crank up the fright factor, pic resorts to the standard cheap thrills: cold-sweat nightmares, creaking doors, candles that mysteriously burn out, etc.
Other plot elements -- ominous Third World interludes, a priest (Stephen Rea) who tries to warn Katherine Before It's Too Late, whisperings about the long-awaited spawn of Satan -- can't help but conjure ill-advised comparisons to any number of horror classics including "The Exorcist," "The Omen" and "Rosemary's Baby." And for all its high-minded aspirations, "The Reaping" really shows its cards in the final reels, with a descent into visual bombast and spiritual chaos that is almost riveting in its silliness.
Born to play tough, unflinching heroines, Swank resists the temptation to turn Katherine's atheism into an easy irritant, instead portraying her as someone who quietly respects the beliefs of others even as she's lost her own. Still, the character's prodigal journey is so circumscribed from the outset -- and Swank's own bid for B.O. success in a genre vehicle is so transparent -- that very little she does here feels spontaneous or surprising, save for a few warmly maternal flashes that emerge in her interactions with Robb (who was long overdue for a terrifying-tot role).
Swampy Louisiana locales give pic more color and sweaty atmosphere than most horror-thrillers, while Peter Levy's wavering handheld camerawork adds some tension. In addition to being packed with the usual sudden jolts and guttural shrieks, the soundtrack makes lyrically inventive use of wind chimes.

Those two age-old foesscience and blind faithtango yet again in this noxious slice of Biblical horror about a series of Old Testament plagues being visited upon a Louisiana bayou backwater. Hilary Swank  stars as the resident nonbeliever, an ordained minister turned university professor recruited by a rural schoolteacher (David Morrissey ) to convince the locals that there's a perfectly rational explanation (global warming?) for why their once crystalline lake has turned into a crimson tide pool. In short order, frogs rain from the heavens, bad CGI cattle drop dead in their tracks, and hideous boils break out on human skin, until Swank starts to wonder if maybe she was wrong to turn her back on the Lord after her husband and daughter were killed on a missionary trip to the Sudan . Cue overexposed flashbacks of ooga-booga tribesmen.
