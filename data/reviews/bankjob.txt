In 1971, a group of low-rent thieves dug into the vault at a Lloyds bank in central London, raided the safe-deposit boxes they found there, and made off with an enormous amount of cash and jewelry. For days, the robbery was the talk of London: the brazenness of the criminals, the inability of the police to secure their arrests or retrieve the stolen goods, and, most fascinating of all, the story of the amateur ham-radio operator who had randomly stumbled upon the walkie-talkie conversations of the heist men as they dug their tunnel. The so-called �walkie-talkie bank job� became a cause c�l�bre. And then � just like that � it was gone, buried underneath a government gagging order that forbade coverage of the story for 30 years. The reason for the order was unclear, but popular lore regards the government as responsible for the break-in, having hired the robbers in order to get inside the safe-deposit box of a controversial black nationalist/drug smuggler who, it was said, was sitting on compromising photos of Princess Margaret. Well, it�s been 30 years, so now we get The Bank Job
, which blends together the daring of the bank-heist genre with the looming dread of the political-paranoia genre and, in the process, creates its own particular world: Call it the Pandora�s box genre. When Terry Leather (Statham) and his motley gang of thieves pop open those safe-deposit boxes, they don�t just blow the lid off a criminal extortion ring; they stumble into a whole universe of police corruption, financial malfeasance, sexual degeneracy, political conspiracy, murder, torture, and upper-class salaciousness. In other words: a moviemaker�s dream. Unfortunately for our heroes, there are consequences to actions that upset rich and powerful people, and where The Bank Job
 really thrives is in its depiction of the cold, hard realities of a life spent dipping your hands in other people�s pockets. Unlike the other great caper films of the last 10 years, like Ocean�s Eleven
 and The Italian Job
 � stylish affairs in which punishment is close enough to give the audience a sense of lingering danger but never so close that it gets in the way of the technological fetishism and love of tailored shirts that apparently make grand larceny such a kick � the blowback in The Bank Job
 is real and ugly and involves some sort of pneumatic paint-stripping machine that would freak out the Coen brothers. Rather than work under the modern-day Hollywood theory that the right suit and the right haircut are just as important to a successful heist as criminal expertise, The Bank Job
 makes the rather more daring argument that neither is really necessary as long as you have an excess of moxie, dire financial need, and a willingness to accept that prison, death, and other (considerably less pleasant) punishments are the risks of a life spent on the wrong side of both the law and the lawbreakers.


Regarding Jason Statham: I suppose a man can't wipe the floor with stunt extras forever. If you keep sticking a camera in his face, at some point he'll want to act. And what we've learned from last year's "Revolver" and today's "The Bank Job" is that Statham is more a man of action than of acting. Unless he can kick, spin, run, jump, choke, kill, or drive really fast, he's an emotional black hole. What was said about the far more charismatic Burt Reynolds loosely applies to Jason Statham: At 60 miles an hour, he's a star.
He doesn't go half that fast in "The Bank Job," a soundly generic heist-gone-wrong movie loosely based on the true story of a 1971 London robbery. Statham is Terry, a family man and car salesman who owes the wrong people money. Conveniently, a gorgeous old friend named Martine (Saffron Burrows) appears and offers him "the big score." She's up to her neck in cheekbones and up to her cheekbones in deception.
What she hasn't told her old mate is that she has proposed this operation on behalf of the intelligence agency MI5, who'd like the contents of a certain safe-deposit box: compromising sex photos of the royal family. The box belongs to the Caribbean-born, London-based revolutionary Michael X (Peter De Jersey), who has been holding onto the photos to keep MI5 off his back. The best parts of this movie are the overheated description of Michael X in the script written by the longtime British duo Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Someone calls him a "crazy, dope-smoking, lunatic pimp extortionist." That's a ringing advertisement for the movie I'd rather be watching.
Instead, we see Terry and his crew of petty-thief buddies tunneling into the bank vault, and the Australian director Roger Donaldson delivers these sequences with the commendable, if forgettable, professionalism you'd expect from the man who also made "Cocktail," "Species," and "Dante's Peak." Donaldson is a good director, but with "The Bank Job" it's hard to tell where his interests really lie. The Black Power stuff devolves into sensationalistic nonsense. The less said about the scenes from Terry's fractured marriage the better, especially coming from Donaldson, who made one of the greatest relationship films (1981's "Smash Palace"). And the heist, with its latticework of double-crosses, never pops.
Only when it's time for Statham to hurt people, in the last 10 or so minutes do "The Bank Job" and its star really demonstrate personality. The movie doesn't hang together as a thriller, and the characters don't hang together as interesting people. Is this a work of realism or does the movie fancy itself a cartoon? Is it Jules Dassin's smoky nail-biter "Rififi" or one of Guy Ritchie's crime trifles? Either way, it's something new for heist pictures: a movie that can't even rip off its predecessor with any panache.


Heist films, from the Ocean's  movies to The Italian Job ,  have evolved into fantasy. They've become capers of sci-fi technology and unreal  cunning, executed with a timing so split-second it's almost atomic. One of the pleasures of The Bank Job  is that it returns us to the days when robbing  a bank was a gritty, hole-in-the-wall affair. In this crackling tale of low crooks and highball politics, set in 1971 (it's based on a true story), the blokes who break into a vault of safe-deposit boxes haven't set out to do anything all that  ingenious. Led by Jason Statham, that sexy scowler who's like Michael Madsen crossed with Daniel Craig, they rent out a storefront two doors down from a Lloyds Bank in London, dig a deep hole, and tunnel through the sewer with a jackhammer, making an unholy racket in the chicken joint above. They're not clever, just committed.
What they don't realize is that the crime has been set in motion by the British government, which wants to retrieve a stash of photos that show Princess Margaret at an orgy. It's not clear that this actually happened, but it's nice to think that it did, and the logistical details of the crime are mostly true. Watching The Bank Job , you buy the heist, and you also buy the entertaining layer cake of British society  the black radicals, smut lords, and MI5 agents who treat cops like janitors, all fighting for their piece of the action.

 The workmanlike title “The Bank Job” is a nice fit for this wham-bam caper flick. Efficiently directed by Roger Donaldson from a busy script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, it fancifully revisits the mysterious whos and speculative hows of a 1971 London vault cleanout on Baker Street labeled the walkie-talkie robbery. (The thieves squawked on the airwaves like crows.) It was headline news and, then, with a wave of the official wand, it was hush-hush. That’s one story, anyway.  True or not, the on-screen follies mostly amuse and generally divert. Working off a hot tip, a gang of charming lowlifes of varying capabilities and intelligence make like moles, tunneling under a women’s handbag store until they hit the larcenous lottery: safe-deposit boxes crammed with sparkling treasures, fistfuls of bank notes and delectable smut involving some Very Important Personages. The thieves — led by the bullet-headed looker Jason Statham as Terry — scoop up their ill-gotten  goods and scram. Assorted coppers and villains give chase, as do some stiff-lip types in bespoke suits from the British security services.  The filmmakers have claimed that the British government put a kibosh on media reports about the robbery by issuing a D Notice (now called a DA Notice, for defense advisory), a form of media self-censorship jointly agreed upon by representatives of the press and the government. In February The Guardian published an article stating that no D Notice had been issued after the heist, but the truth is usually beside the point when it comes to this sort of breezy entertainment, so it’s hard to care. Far more important is the way Mr. Statham, a B-movie action pinup (“The Transporter”), pumps like a piston across the screen and fills out his natty leather coat, both of which he does with palpable brute force.  Blink and you may well miss the whodunit and what for, much less what does it all mean (if anything). Stuffed with personalities, the fast, fast, fast story unfolds somewhat like a three-dimensional chess game, with the pieces moving among the different levels: on the bottom are Terry and his lads, the shaggy-haired Kevin (Stephen Campbell Moore) and the snaggle-toothed Dave (Daniel Mays); in the middle are the designated villains, including a charismatic if dubious black-power gadfly, Michael X (Peter De Jersey), and the so-called Soho porn king, Lew Vogel (David Suchet); and, on the very top, pulling strings or so they believe, are  the security services,  represented by the well-heeled silky and sneery Tim (Richard Lintern).  Mixed in with this dodgy crowd is a question mark named Martine, a pulpy femme fatale who’s been sensitively shaded in by Saffron Burrows. A former model, this angular, melancholic beauty has, after making the usual independent rounds — Mike Figgis directed her in his screen adaptation of the Strindberg play “Miss Julie” — slowly and somewhat unexpectedly emerged as an actress to watch. Sadness clings to Ms. Burrows: it hoods her eyes, tugs at her mouth and wraps around her like a gossamer shawl. It gives her mystery and, like the hints of age edging her face, blunts the impact of her beauty, making her character more human and emotionally accessible than she might register otherwise.  Ms. Burrows is particularly welcome, given that the caper itself is pretty much a yawn. Central to the pleasure of a great heist film is the spectacle of men (rarely women) at work, men who through their hard labor, their sweat and stratagems — and, if they’re in a Jean-Pierre Melville film, their honor — defy the law and society. (There’s a reason so many of these movies seem like metaphors for moviemaking.) The walkie-talkie gang, by contrast, comes across here as more lucky than cunning. They blunder into the heist, at times comically, which amps the laughs, but helps drain what little suspense remains after Mr. Donaldson has whisked his characters through their paces, and the ruthlessly efficient editing has nipped at their heels.  Amid all the period wheeling and stealthy dealing, the story carves out a little time for a short detour involving Michael X — also known as Michael de Freitas, also known as Michael Abdul Malik — a native of Trinidad   who became a radical-chic figure in London during the late 1960s and early 1970s and, years later, cannon fodder for the writer V. S. Naipaul, who saw him as a fraud. The film’s cartoonish depiction of Michael X doesn’t begin to do justice to the strangeness of his story — he partied with John Lennon and was championed by William S. Burroughs, Dick Gregory and Heinrich Böll — though it adds a nicely outré detail to this embroidered fiction. Maybe Mr. Statham can play Mr. Burroughs in the sequel.  “The Bank Job” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some nasty, nasty blowtorch violence.

A gang of cockney boys attempt to rob a bank, little realizing they've been set up by Her Majesty's spymasters, in "The Bank Job," an engrossing if underwhelming period thriller. Helmed by Roger Donaldson ("The World's Fastest Indian") and written by august scribes Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (who penned the classic '70s Brit sitcom "Porridge"), pic feels downright old-fashioned -- not in an arch-pastiche way, but not really in a good way, either. Opening wide in Blighty on Feb. 28, and Stateside a week later, "Job" could bank coin from male demos if marketing gets it right. 
Plot is loosely based on the so-called "walkie-talkie bank job" of 1971, during which a ham-radio operator picked up the two-way communication between a lookout and some burglars who had tunneled into Lloyd's Bank on Baker Street in Central London.
From this historical kernel, the script spins a reasonably complex and not implausible work of sheer fiction. Here, the impetus to rob the bank comes not from the burglars themselves, but from MI5 or MI6 (it's a running joke that no one understands the difference), who are under pressure to recover incriminating photographs locked in the safe-deposit box of a "royal princess" (maybe Princess Margaret, who allegedly had a naughty sexual history). The photos were taken by one Michael X (Peter De Jersey), a real-life Trinidadian gangster-cum-Black Power leader who was eventually hanged for murder in Trinidad.
Supercilious spy Tim (Richard Lintern) thus promises to get his lover Martine (Saffron Burrows) out of trouble from a drug bust if she puts together a gang to rob the bank -- they can even keep the loot as long as they hand over the saucy snaps. An East End girl made good, Martine goes back to her old stomping grounds to recruit shady used-car salesman Terry Leather (Jason Statham, a Brit gangster-pic regular willingly typecast once again), along with their old mates, photographer Kevin (Stephen Campbell Moore) and part-time actor Dave (Daniel Mays).
Just to complicate things further, one of the safe-deposit boxes has a ledger recording all the bribes paid to corrupt cops by Lew Vogel (David Suchet, dressed in wig and glasses so as to resemble the late, beloved British comedian Ronnie Barker). After the job is pulled off successfully, despite the attempted intervention of the police, Vogel goes on the war path to track down the gang, proving himself a more ruthless foe than either the spies or the cops.
Helmer Donaldson, a clean pair of hands but no master craftsman judging by his previous output, efficiently keeps all the script's potentially slippery balls in the air, averting outright disaster in what could have been a tortuously confusing story. Without overdoing it, pic (shot in the U.K., with some location work in Australia) evokes the politically precarious atmosphere of the time, when sex scandals had far more impact and radical-chic politics made for some strange bedfellows, for instance Black Power leaders and conservative MPs' daughters (Hattie Morahan plays one of the latter in a vivid supporting turn).
However, the filmmaking lacks flair and looks as though it were done a bit on the cheap. Period details in production design and costumes are accurate-looking, but in a low-key way. Tight shots of locations used, mixed with studio-shot footage, seem to be just barely keeping contempo details out of frame (a sign at Paddington Station uses 1990s fonts). Lensing on HD, Michael Coulter opts for a dark, grungy palette that suits the period but makes only a nominal effort to mimic the cantered angles and zoom shots one associates with '60s and '70s British films (such as "Get Carter").
Instead of a soundtrack of hits from the period, J. Peter Robinson's monotonous score sounds like off-the-shelf thriller music, all kettle drums and droning synths. Dialogue, likewise, often sounds as though it were bought by the yard. Thesping is generally OK, but no better.
Reportedly a long time in development, pic went through a couple title changes (including "Baker Street" and "D-Notice"). Following a long line of British gangster pics, "The Bank Job" suffers by being neither fish nor fowl: It's not a flashy, youth-skewing, violence-soaked slice of cool in the style of Guy Ritchie ("Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels") or Nick Love ("The Business"), but it's also not quite clever enough to appeal to an arthouse crowd as "Sexy Beast" did.
Nevertheless, in the U.K., pic could benefit from weak competition in its opening week and the lockout of "Rambo" in the Odeon multiplex chain.
