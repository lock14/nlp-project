The standoff starts in medias res , with bystander Jinx (Nick Stahl ) locked in a bank vault with Jessica (Erika Christensen , in Meg White  wig), herself forced into a life of crime by the lack of career opportunities for gorgeous young thoroughbreds. The rest of the stickup team is cornered in the lobby; the SWAT team's guarding the street beyond. Despite an 81-minute runtime, the plot has to stretch to go the distance, mostly by reiterating its theme (the danger of ATM surcharges) compulsively. So we get an endless chain of cell-phone negotiations, spritzes of "kinetic" stylization that not even a home- schooled adolescent seeing his first movie could find cool, and a sepulchral whiff of the mid-'90s in the form of Roger Avary  mannerisms and that guy from Bush  (Gavin Rossdale ), now an actor. Even the mighty Terry Crews , who made White Chicks  sporadically watchable, is herein defeated. So objectively awful it ceases even to be a reflection of writer- director Andrews Jenkins 's non-talent, How to Rob a Bank  calls into question the distribution filtration process that should protect delicate consumer eyes from things like this. WTF IFC?
