         Parker Posey, the queen of the indies, is a stylish actress, but there's not much she can do with the flat, trite sex comedy "The Oh in Ohio," written by Adam Wierzbianski and directed by Billy Kent without a trace of imagination or originality.
 
  Posey's Priscilla is an elegant, hotshot Cleveland advertising executive whose frigidity, after a decade of marriage to bearded high school teacher Jack (Paul Rudd), has at last driven them apart. While Priscilla belatedly seeks help, leading to a variety of sexual adventures, Jack commences an affair with an 18-year-old student (Mischa Barton).
 


         






    There's no sense of pace or reality in this film, which seems a rehash of countless other movies. Liza Minnelli gives the picture a jolt of energy as a New Age sex guru, and Danny DeVito steals the show — were it worth stealing — as a brash swimming pool impresario who's a lot more than he seems. Ohio, and Cleveland in particular, deserve much better than this.

I'm convinced that what Truman Capote did for Philip Seymour Hoffman, a Katharine Hepburn biopic could do for Parker Posey. Take a good look at her: She's Hepburn's double, and so naturally stylized that you can just imagine her slipping into those head-tilting gestures, that playful aristocratic lilt. Yet it's Parker Posey's extreme stylization, her distinctive way of putting air quotes around joy or despair, that has also limited her as an actress. Mostly, she has thrived in goofy-camp indie throwaways that exploit her penchant for alluring self-mockery.
This year's model is The Oh in Ohio , in which Posey plays a married Cleveland commerce PR executive who has never had an orgasm. Until she discovers the vibrator, that is, at which point she becomes a big-O addict, squirming around in her bedsheets, then finally having one right in the boardroom  an over-the-top scene that the movie gets away with only because Posey brings it off, so to speak, with such disheveled charm. The Oh in Ohio  is a silly, amusing trifle. Paul Rudd, as the frustrated high school biology teacher to whom Posey is married, creates a surly sympathy as he pursues his own questionable liberation (he sleeps with a student, played with sexy impassivity by Mischa Barton), and then Posey, having unlocked her inner pleasure seeker, does something truly extreme: She falls for the local swimming-pool salesman, an aging munchkin in a ponytail played, rather sweetly, by Danny DeVito. It's safe to say that this is one actress who has yet to meet her Cary Grant.

 “The Oh in Ohio” is that rare American sex comedy that doesn’t involve teenagers making love to pastry. Directed by Billy Kent from a screenplay by Adam Wierzbianski, this nicely naughty indie is full of unexpected pleasures, not least the casting of Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to “liberate your labia!”  One such “sexually dysfunctional” woman is Priscilla Chase (Parker Posey), a Cleveland advertising executive who has never had an orgasm. Her marriage to Jack (Paul Rudd), a high school biology teacher, has suffered as a result, and the movie is concerned with the connections they make after separating.  He will seek happiness in the arms of a precociously bodacious student embodied by Mischa Barton. She will venture on a stimulating voyage of self-discovery that begins with vibrator advice from the hottest lesbian sex-shop clerk in the history of cinema (Heather Graham) and ends on a water slide with Danny DeVito, here giving a marvelously gentle performance as a roly-poly swimming pool salesman.  A feel-good movie about feeling good, “The Oh in Ohio” thrums with happy vibes and amiable performances. A delectable if limited actress, Ms. Posey locates a few real feelings within her usual goofball shtick. Ditto, in a less realized role, the hammy Mr. Rudd.

If the Farrelly Brothers were to film their version of a naughty, bawdy dinner-theater trifle from the '70s, the result likely would resemble "The Oh in Ohio." Amusing indie comedy blithely blurs the line between risque and raunchy, often to hilarious effect. With shrewd marketing, pic could click with adult auds during theatrical run, and make a bigger splash as homevid fare.
The titular "Oh" stands for orgasm, a state of sexual arousal that has remained consistently elusive for Priscilla (Parker Posey) throughout a decade of marriage to Jack (Paul Rudd). And while Priscilla claims she is perfectly satisfied with their lovemaking, Jack is growing increasingly frustrated by his inability to fully excite his wife.
Worse, he's also nearing premature burn-out as a high school teacher -- making him all the more vulnerable to the alluring appeal of Kristen (Mischa Barton), a willowy student who wants to ease his pain.
While Jack grapples with temptation -- far less successfully, it should be noted, than Kevin Spacey's character in "American Beauty" -- Priscilla seeks help from a flamboyant sex guru (Liza Minnelli) who advises a do-it-yourself approach. Priscilla normally channels most of her time and energy into her PR job of attracting industry to Cleveland (where pic was shot). But, after breaking down and buying a vibrator from a slinky lesbian sex-shop salesclerk (unbilled Heather Graham), she becomes addicted to self-stimulation, to the point of finding inventive new uses for her vibrating cell phone. Latter twist cues an uproarious set piece that plays like equal parts soft-core porn and "I Love Lucy" while showcasing Posey's talent for physical comedy.
When Jack moves out of the house (and, of course, into an affair with Kristen), Priscilla finds an unlikely Mr. Right: Larry (Danny DeVito), a paunchy and balding swimming pool mogul who's two or three decades her senior. Despite the age difference, however, he's even better than a battery-operated appliance when it comes to causing climaxes.
Working from clever but uneven script by Adam Wierzbianski, helmer Billy Kent relies on his strong cast to get pic through occasional bumpy spots. DeVito gives a thoroughly engaging and surprisingly sweet performance in a role that other thesps might have overplayed unattractively. He cracks wise with gusto, but expresses emotion with heart. That goes a long way toward keeping "The Oh in Ohio" on an even keel as it shifts gears in the final reels, moving from broad farce to romantic comedy.
Posey gracefully maneuvers a tricky transition of her own, tracing an arc from uptight denial to lusty excess to serene self-confidence. (Her final line is the perfect capper for both her character and the pic itself.)
Rudd is at his funniest while Jack stews in discontent, spewing barbed commentary that indicates serious self-loathing. He's also adept at infusing romantic longing with sardonic, self-deprecating wit.
Keith David brings a touch of sly-fox mischievousness to his supporting turn as Jack's best buddy, while Barton is appealing and poised as the mature-beyond-her-years Kristen. Minnelli and Robert John Burke (as Kristen's father) score laughs while demonstrating how to score maximum impact in single-scene cameos.
Overall tech package is impressive enough to suggest Priscilla would approve of pic as suitably image-enhancing for Cleveland.

Priscilla (Parker Posey ) has never had an orgasm, and even though her high school teacher hubby Jack (Paul Rudd ) admits she's great in the sack, he's being driven to drink by the fact that there is no known way to satisfy her. Priscilla's job is to woo big business to Cleveland, which might be a lot easier if she were to realize what may be Ohio's biggest selling point: that the age of consent is only 16which Jack's star pupil (Mischa Barton ) knows well. First-time feature director Billy Kent  seems proud that his movie deals with sex in such frank fashion. But if you're going to brag about your explicit sexuality, it doesn't quite work to go out of your way avoiding skin. Every actor here probably has a no-nudity clause, but for a film like this, it might have been better for the storyand the box officeto find a cast that doesn't. Except for Danny DeVito  and Liza Minnelli their clothes can stay.
