Who doesn't have a sweet tooth for intrigue on a train? Hercule Poirot  grilling dining-car dandies in Murder on the Orient Express  ? Steven Seagal  snapping necks in Under Siege 2  ? There's something about a claustrophobic tube whistling at breakneck speed that makes mayhem go down smooth. So a thriller aboard the Trans-Siberian line, stretching roughly 5,000 miles from Beijing to Moscow, should be a cinch, right? Not so fast, Casey Jones.
Transsiberian  director Brad Anderson, whose résumé includes underseen gems like 2000's Happy Accidents  , certainly has fun with the exotic setting  a moving freak show of pear-shaped babushkas and burly men tossing back vodka shots. But his main characters could use more spice. Woody Harrelson  and Emily Mortimer  play an American couple returning from a charity mission in China who are later joined in their cramped compartment by Carlos and Abby, a pair of backpackers who may or may not be heroin mules. One look at the former (Eduardo Noriega), with his creepy Eurotrash stares, and there's no question that trouble lies around the next snowy bend in the tracks. How exactly that trouble unspools is one of the film's sole tense pleasures, so it's not worth spoiling here. But by the time Ben Kingsley  takes over as a Russian inspector chewing on the word nyet  as if it were made of beef Stroganoff, Anderson's once-promising trip is seconds away from jackknifing off the rails.

 “Transsiberian” is a handsomely remodeled variation of a cherished genre you might call the mystery-train movie. Updated by the director Brad Anderson (“The Machinist”), who wrote the screenplay with Will Conroy, it skillfully manipulates familiar tropes: innocents abroad, ominous glowering foreigners, conspiracy and duplicity, erotic intrigue. Until it fizzles in an anticlimactic train crash, it is extremely entertaining.  Ben Kingsley, seen briefly at the beginning of the movie before disappearing, only to re-emerge much later, plays Grinko, a duplicitous narcotics detective. A sophisticated embodiment of a cynical middle-aged Russian with a double vision of his country during and after Communism, he lends the movie a modern Dostoyevskian gloss.  As the ill-fated train whistles from Beijing toward Moscow through a desolate, snow-covered landscape, with many stops along the way, you lean back and prepare to get lost in a Siberian gulag where you can’t speak the language and have no global positioning system or even a compass for guidance. The paranoid mood intensifies during the first two-thirds, in which the suspense is comparable to that found in the best films of that mystery-train master, Alfred Hitchcock. Once the movie turns into an action-thriller aboard detached, runaway railroad cars, however, it ends up sidetracked.  The train, on which most of the movie is set, is  not to be confused with the luxurious  Orient Express of earlier train dramas. The rickety Communist-era relic has an overtly hostile crew, toilets that don’t flush and sleeping cars in which travelers are packed like sardines. Instead of glamorous, well-heeled tourists with stacks of expensive luggage, most of the passengers are sullen peasants and rowdy drunks. At each stop policemen with drug-sniffing dogs patrol the aisles.  Into this human clutter arrive Roy (Woody Harrelson) and Jessie (Emily Mortimer), a naïve American couple returning to the United States from China where they have been teaching English as part of a church-sponsored charity program. There are ominous portents. Early in the trip they are regaled with the story of a passenger from whom a corrupt Russian policeman extorted thousands of dollars and cut off two toes because the name on his passport was misspelled.  Roy is a chirping parody of the gregarious American abroad. Jessie, an amateur photographer, is a reformed bad girl with a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Roy met her when she had hit rock bottom and stood by her during her recovery. She still clings to a cigarette habit. While Roy longs for children, Jessie wants to put off having a family. For all her surface primness, underneath she is a reckless adventurer. When faced with sexual temptation, she muses darkly, “I sure wish I’d met you back in the day.”  That they break the mold of the picture-perfect all-American couple facing danger as a cozy unit injects the genre with a bracing psychological complexity. In a compelling performance, Ms. Mortimer takes her complicated character and runs with it.  With the arrival of their companions in the sleeper’s double-decker bunk beds, the mystery soup thickens. Carlos (Eduardo Noriega), a handsome Spaniard in his late-30s with a crooked flash in his eyes, and Abby (Kate Mara), a glum 20-year-old runaway from Seattle, are a suspiciously odd pair of international nomads who claim to be returning from a stint teaching English in Japan.  Carlos ogles Jessie, who pretends not to notice. A little later, when he shows her a sample from the suitcase of tchotchkes he says they are planning to sell in Amsterdam, you wonder if these little porcelain dolls might be stuffed with drugs.  At the Siberian city of Irkutsk Roy misses the train. As Jessie awaits his arrival the next day, Carlos and Abby stay by her side, and the movie teases you with the notion that something dreadful happened to him. With time on their hands, Carlos coaxes Jessie to take a bus into the countryside and hike into the forest to visit a crumbling church, leaving Abby behind in their seedy hotel. The rest of the drama hinges on horrific events that take place during this traumatic side trip.  Roy, returning safe and sound and chipper as ever, is accompanied by Grinko, whom he met and befriended in Irkutsk. With his glittering eyes and mocking smirk, dropping cynical aphorisms about Soviet versus capitalist Russia, Grinko is a fascinatingly ambiguous figure, simultaneously wise and corrupt, good and evil, with scary psychological radar. “In Russia, we have an expression,” he says, fixing his eyes on Jessie, who is frozen with panic. “With lies you may go forward in the world, but you may never go back.”  The cat-and-mouse game that ensues leads “Transsiberian” from tantalizing mystery into clanking melodrama.  “Transsiberian” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, one scene of torture, strong language and sexual situations.

The long sidelined subgenre centered on mysterious doings aboard exotic trains is put back on the tracks in "Transsiberian," an engagingly up-to-date melodrama steeped in local color and steered by a treacherous sense of morality. Stalwart indie helmer Brad Anderson spreads his wings considerably here by moving further into action and genre territory than he ever has before with a film that will likely achieve more theatrical traction internationally than in the U.S. but looks promising everywhere at tube and home viewing destinations down the line.
One of the most famous train routes in the world, the Transsiberian links Beijing and Moscow with 7865 kilometers of track for a journey that requires a week to complete. It's a trip Anderson took after studying Russian in college in the late '80s, and one embarked upon herein by two Yanks, married couple Roy (Woody Harrelson) and Jessie (Emily Mortimer), after having put in a church-sponsored stint helping children in China.

Earlygoing is agreeably spent just soaking up some of the sights, as the unglamorous old-style train leaves Beijing Station, chugs past the Great Wall and stops at the Russian border to change wheels, required by the gauge difference. The couple banter with colorful passengers in the dining car, but cut short an initially lusty interlude due to a disagreement over trying to make a baby.

They are soon joined in the four-berth compartment by another couple, Carlos (Eduardo Noriega), a handsome, priapic Spaniard, and Abby (Kate Mara), a hard-looking Yank who doesn't say much. Except for the abstinent Jessie, they all get drunk with the other passengers to fill the journey's long hours, while Carlos doesn't miss a chance to insinuate his sexual interest to the rattled Jessie, who, during a station stop, pairs off with Abby and reveals her checkered past as a wild young woman, very much the sort that would have taken up with someone like Carlos.

When the train starts out again through the snowy Siberian forest, Roy isn't on board, so the remaining trio get off at the next rural station to await his promised arrival on the next day's train. Carlos presses his advances on Jessie, especially during a bus trip they take to the middle of nowhere to visit the ruins of a beautiful church for Jessie to photograph.

First thumping surprise in Anderson's and Will Conroy's script arrives at the 50-minute mark, and more lay in wait. It comes as no surprise, however, to confirm that Carlos and Abby are drug dealers, nor that the train voyage is thereupon joined by narcotics inspector Grinko (Ben Kingsley), who has been seen in the opening sequence investigating a drug-inspired murder in Vladivostok.

Things get hairy for all concerned during pic's second half, which includes another murder, a torture-driven interrogation, hand-to-hand combat on board the train and some very queasy moral decisions made under the stress of sheer survival. Especially as seen through Kingsley's character, a grizzled vet of the Soviet days with a pragmatic assessment of old-style corruption versus the new brand, the film can be viewed as a microcosmic snapshot of the value system of the new Russia, even as its interest remains squarely on the narrataive.

Usually seen in appealing if limited secondary leads, Mortimer is blessed with the only fully developed character here and runs with it in a very flavorful performance as a reformed bad girl presented with a whopping opportunity to backslide. If the other characters, especially that of her husband, had been similarly filled out, "Transsiberian" could have been even more complex and compelling.

But Roy is disappointingly conceived as a simple country boy, a gee-whizzing rube that tiresomely reads like a several decades-old stereotype. As written, he can't possibly hold his own against the worldly Carlos, whose life story one can pretty much imagine. Abby remains enigmatic, although it doesn't matter much in the overall scheme of things.



Though not one for literal smoke and mirrors, master of horror Brad Anderson , with his panache for arousing fear from harried reality and rotted atmosphere, is still a shaman. In his latest spooker, Anderson locates dread not just inside his characters' psyches but also in the lines across a babushka's face, the insides of a matryoshka doll, and Ben Kingsley 's ushanka . The setting this time is the wintriest wasteland of Siberia , through which a train lumbers toward Moscow  from China with a bobble-headed Christian dweeb (Woody Harrelson ) and his wife Jessie (Emily Mortimer ) on board, plus a lascivious Spaniard (Eduardo Noriega ), a fishy narcotics officer (Kingsley), and a half-dozen other easily excitable foreigners seemingly pulled from Eli Roth 's go-to central casting. At its queasy best—when absorbing the naturally phantasmagoric vibes of Siberia and surveying Jessie's grueling efforts to discard a backpack filled with unwanted goods—Transsiberian  more subtly critiques our American sense of privilege than any of Roth's Hostel  pictures. But just as nasty as the titular mode of transport is the script's wanton declaration of theme and a cynical and fashionable belief in moral grayness that may complement the frosty setting but nonetheless feels easy.
