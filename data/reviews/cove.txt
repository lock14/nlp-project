Most documentaries strive for drama, and a few, like Man on Wire , achieve suspense. But The Cove  is the rare documentary specifically designed as a thriller. It follows Richard O'Barry, a renegade knight of the marine world, as he attempts to get near a heavily guarded cove in Taiji, Japan, where the secret killing of dolphins for food and profit has been going on for years. O'Barry intends to record this atrocity for the world to see, and so he and his team sneak in at night to plant cameras, hiding them inside of fake rocks. O'Barry has the fevered look of Richard Widmark, and the cove-infiltration scenes give you that full-on, night-vision-goggles, look, we've been spotted!  thriller treatment. They're exciting to watch, though you can feel how hard the movie  is working to turn a vital ecological subject into crowd-pleasing entertainment.
Nearly 50 years ago, O'Barry trained the dolphins on Flipper , and he came to deplore their capture (one of the show's dolphins died in his arms  from depression, he says). His crusade to rescue them comes off as both righteous and quixotic. The Cove  doesn't always give you the facts you want (how harmful is the Taiji slaughter to the world dolphin population?). Yet its images of blood in the water are worth a thousand preachy words. The movie forces you to ask: Are some creatures really too sensitive and beautiful to kill?

 When the director Louie Psihoyos slipped into the little coastal town of Taiji, Japan, it was under cover of documenting the degradation of ocean reefs. Once there, however, he proceeded to mount one of the most audacious and perilous operations in the history of the conservation movement.  “The Cove” is much more than just a record of that adventure. Like the director’s cover story, the movie is a Trojan horse: an exceptionally well-made documentary that unfolds like a spy thriller, complete with bugged hotel rooms, clandestine derring-do and mysterious men in gray flannel suits. Those men — perhaps cops, perhaps worse — tail Mr. Psihoyos and his crew unrelentingly, determined to prevent anyone from filming the enormously lucrative dolphin capture and slaughter that support the town’s economy and employ  its fishermen.  This killing may be legal — dolphins and other small marine mammals are not protected by the ban on commercial whaling — but, as we shall see, the methods used  are so nonchalantly brutal and gut-churningly primitive that Taiji officials are understandably publicity-shy. (And, we learn later, there are other secrets lurking beneath the town’s thriving tourist industry and cute, dolphin-shape pleasure boats.) Consequently, anyone straying too close to the kill zone — a secluded lagoon protected by steep cliffs, manned tunnels and razor-wire gates — is violently harassed by videocam-wielding fishermen hoping to record an imprisonable offense.  None of which fazes Mr. Psihoyos, an urbane eco-warrior who pops up periodically to provide context and clarification. His soothing tones, however, can’t disguise a relish for the fray: beneath the silver-fox exterior beats a rabble-rousing heart. (“You try to do the story legally,” he insists, eyes twinkling in remembrance of every cloak-and-dagger move.) That heart invigorates every frame of “The Cove,” as does Mr. Psihoyos’s eye for a powerful image (his photographs have graced many an issue of National Geographic) and savvy narrative style: this is no angry enviro-rant but a living, breathing movie whose horrifying  disclosures feel fully earned.  Seduced by the familiar rhythms of the heist thriller, we watch as Mr. Psihoyos recruits his dream team — including a former avionics engineer with the Canadian Air Force and a pair of champion free divers — and turns it loose. Planting ingeniously camouflaged, state-of-the-art equipment in and around their target, they capture sights and sounds of uncommon beauty and quiet revelation: a group of fishermen reminiscing about blue-whale pods as dense as “a clump of bamboo” and a ghostly, thermal handprint clinging to a gatepost like arcane spoor. Viewed from below, the hypnotically graceful progress of a free diver resembles nothing so much as an undulating mermaid with a giant can opener for a tail — an inadvertent clue to the movie’s intentions.  Adroitly  assembled by the award-winning editor Geoffrey Richman, the movie’s many interviews and interests (ranging from dolphin-human relations to the mystery of where all that slaughtered meat ends up) interweave seamlessly. And if the film’s villains are sometimes difficult to untangle, it could be because one of them, the worldwide marine-park industry, is not formally represented; it could also be because without our patronage, that industry would not exist.  Heroes, however, are instantly identifiable, like the shy Japanese councilmen who risk their jobs to protect schoolchildren from mercury-tainted  dolphin meat. But “The Cove,” like the dolphins, would be lost without Richard O’Barry, who captured and trained all five of the animals who made Flipper a television star and a household name and sparked the craze for performing sea mammals. His drooping eyes and sagging shoulders testify to the bone-deep exhaustion of someone who has spent the last 35 years atoning, and when he gate-crashes a meeting of the International Whaling Commission, the video screen strapped to his chest is like a physical manifestation of decades of guilt.  “If a dolphin is in trouble anywhere in the world, my phone rings,” he says. (We don’t need to be told that his heart breaks.) You may not give a fig for dolphins, but Mr. O’Barry is giving enough for us all.  “The Cove” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Blood in the water and tears in the eyes.

Eco-activist documentaries don't get much more compelling than "The Cove," an impassioned piece of advocacy filmmaking that follows "Flipper" trainer-turned-marine crusader Richard O'Barry in his efforts to end dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan. Casting a very wide net, this powerful polemic is simultaneously a love letter to a beloved species, an eye-opening primer on worldwide dolphin captivity, a playful paranoid thriller and a work of deep-seated (if sometimes hot-headed) moral outrage. The devastating final images demand to be seen on the bigscreen, though cable exposure won't blunt their impact.
There's deep remorse in O'Barry's voice as he recalls how he caught and trained the five dolphins that played Flipper in the popular 1960s TV show. Since then, he has devoted his life to speaking out against all forms of dolphin captivity, even for educational/entertainment purposes. O'Barry argues that theme parks like Sea World, with their deafening human voices and tight confines, are no place for these sound-sensitive, free-spirited mammals -- an idea underscored by magisterial shots of dolphins at play on the open seas.
While those who aren't animal lovers may quibble with the way the film all but exalts the dolphin as a higher life form, it's hard not to feel that there's something uniquely barbaric about the destruction of this exceptionally intelligent, human-friendly species. And no form of cetacean abuse angers O'Barry more than the mass harpooning that occurs in the Japanese port town of Taiji, where fishermen use sonar to lure the dolphins into a cove that becomes their deathtrap.
The confrontational O'Barry, who has been arrested many times for trying to free captive dolphins, is practically Taiji's Public Enemy No. 1. Pic is larded with footage of fishermen barring him from entering the cove, where all photography and recording have been banned.
Produced by the Oceanic Preservation Society (of which director Louie Psihoyos and exec producer Jim Clark are members), "The Cove" tells the story of O'Barry's mission to obtain hard evidence of what goes on in Taiji. Mark Monroe's clear, intelligent text traces a conspiracy built of many parts, all of which can be chalked up to human greed or stupidity: the widespread mercury poisoning that has rendered dolphin meat almost inedible; the mislabeling of dolphin meat so as to unload a product for which there is little human demand; and the refusal of the Intl. Whaling Commission (which has banned O'Barry as a member) to protect cetaceans from commercial whaling.
Midway through, the pic morphs into a heist movie of sorts, as O'Barry and Psihoyos enlist a crack team of activists and divers to get past the tight security and plant hidden cameras in the bay. Despite the fun thriller riffs in J. Ralph's fine score and the crew's ingeniously subversive methods, this section is arguably the film's least effective: The night-vision footage of their exploits is hard to follow, and despite the 24-hour presence of Taiji security, a sense of danger never really takes hold. But the shocking footage they obtain turns out to be well worth their trouble, ending "The Cove" on a note of truly harrowing pure cinema.
Tech package is first-rate, benefiting from Psihoyos' experience as a photographer for National Geographic. Coverage of the events described is superbly comprehensive and cut together with forceful clarity by editor Geoffrey Richman.

Late in the infectiously frisky documentary The Cove , an older man calmly gate-crashes an international conference on whaling with a television screen strapped to his chest, showing bloody images of the mass slaughter of dolphins in a pretty cove off the coast of Japan . It's a show-stopping publicity stunt by dolphin advocate Ric O'Barry , and also one act of an ongoing ritual of public penance by this one-time hunter and trainer of dolphins for the popular 1960s television series Flipper . O'Barry came to understand that dolphins cutting up on TV or in aquaria around the world may provide oceans of fun for audiences, but that it's torture for the sociable, intelligent mammals forcibly separated from their fellows and habitat.
The sleepy-eyed but intense O'Barry—who now spends his days slipping into Japan in silly disguises to avoid getting arrested by the police or attacked by irate fisherman at the infamous cove where dolphins are culled for export or killed—is the perfect star for this forthrightly activist film.  But he's far from the only performance artist in the rousing blend of pop entertainment, faux-thriller, horror movie, and naked agitprop that is The Cove , a benign feat of manipulation designed to make you rue every minute you spent ooh -ing and aah -ing at SeaWorld .
It's also designed to make you call for the blood of the Japanese government, which lobbies strenuously against international efforts to protect small crustaceans and secretively protects the fishermen who cruelly trap thousands of dolphins a year to either sell for export or kill for, as it turns out, mercury-contaminated meat that shows up not only in delicatessens around the world, but in the school lunches of Japanese children.
"To my mind, either you're an activist or an inactivist," says director Louie Psihoyos , a photographer and co-founder of the Oceanic Preservation Society , whose smooth skin and emerald eyes make him look more than a little cetacean himself. Psihoyos possesses the showboating instincts and righteous rage of Michael Moore , but without Moore's bile or self-importance. The Cove  is the exuberantly theatrical and often very funny story of Psihoyos and his team of overgrown authority-averse schoolboys (and one tender girl, deep-sea diver Mandy Rae-Cruikshank , whom we see, in a beautiful sequence, mimicking the graceful movements of the dolphins as she swims underwater with them). This self-described "Ocean's Eleven" includes a stuntman and a gung-ho team of designers from Industrial Light and Magic , who create fake rocks with hidden cameras to plant around the cove and record the mass murder of these lovely mammals.
"Lovely" is the operative word. Skillful and hugely entertaining as it is, I'm not sure The Cove  would be quite as potent as it is if the subject were, say, walruses instead of dolphins—a made-for-Disney  sub-species if ever there was one. Programmed by nature to make us go, "Awwwww," dolphins are the Goldie Hawns  of endangered species. They're bright, funny, playful, and cute—and, by some freak of nature, they appear to be grinning most of the time. O'Barry laments the anthropomorphization that has turned dolphins into circus clowns in aquariums around the world, but he's not above ascribing human motivation to them himself. When one of the dolphins stops breathing in his arms, he calls its death a suicide. Maybe, maybe not. The Cove  is properly enchanting, horrifying, and rousing, but it comes dangerously close to making the narcissistic case that dolphins deserve to be saved because they're cute and breathe air like we do. But then where does that leave the overfished salmon I went home to poach after the movie?
