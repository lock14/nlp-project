With Nicolas Cage the question is usually why? Why National Treasure? Why The Wicker Man? Why, why, why Ghost Rider? I ask a question like that, furrowing my brow and groaning my way through his movies. Then at some point, the same thing occurs to me that probably does to the tens of millions of people who help keep Nicolas Cage up to his gleaming teeth in leather jackets: The man is a movie star.
Arent a lot of people in movies movie stars, you ask? Probably. But unlike too many of Cages peers, he actually seems to enjoy being one. He might like being a star so much that he doesnt care what he does as long as hes doing something. What difference does it make? Theyll still come, you can imagine him saying as he fixes his hair in the morning (and if that gets any longer, darker, or fuller, well have to start calling it a mane). Seriously: He just made a hit out of a movie about a stunt man with a burning skull for a head.
Now hes back with a watchably absurd popcorn flick about a man who can see two minutes into the future. Incidentally, the man wears a tan suede jacket and the movie, generically enough, is called Next, which, at Cages rate of production, could be the name of all his upcoming movies.
Next has been adapted from the 1954 Philip K. Dick story The Golden Man, to which the movie bears almost no resemblance. Cage plays Cris Johnson, a low-rent Las Vegas magician. Right away Cage hooks us. He wears a velvet tux with a ruffled seafoam-green shirt and does his magic tricks with a stoners deadpan. Hes not taking this seriously: Theres barely anyone in the audience, hes playing to us. Theres something about gambling towns that just suits Cages blend of arrogance and self-deprecation  Next is at least his third Vegas movie. But this one doesnt stay there long.
Cris finds himself hounded by the FBI, represented here by an enjoyably curt Julianne Moore. The feds have learned of Cages gift and want to use it to save Los Angeles from being taken out by a nuclear bomb. But he fears exploitation and takes off to Arizona, setting off a wild chase that does produce one silly yet exciting sequence (the director is Lee Tamahori) in which trucks and boulders and logs go tumbling down a hill.
For fabric-softening, the films three screenwriters give Cris visions of a woman. Her name is Liz, and shes played by Jessica Biel, the movies current must-have item. Alongside Cages spontaneity, Biel seems humorless and earnestly dull, the same way Eva Mendes did in Ghost Rider. It makes you wonder whether Cage is avoiding the Drew Barrymores of the world as a matter of vanity: Does he fear being upstaged? Not that Barrymore would want Biels part: Shes bait for the movies nuke-obsessed Eurobaddies. (The must-have items of 1988 are back.)
The filmmakers have their fun playing with Criss premonitory powers. One foot chase in a casino is sublimely choreographed, with Cris knowing precisely when to bend over or turn a corner so the security guys on his trail keep missing him by a nanosecond. Meanwhile, his visions look like regular scenes until they stop and start again in the movies reality. Of course, this happens so often that youre never entirely sure when youre watching real action or Criss prediction of whats to come.
This is fun for us, too  until it turns crass. (We have to watch someone get blown up at least twice.) The movies attempts to psych us out are actually desperate, not least because the filmmakers and the effects department want to detonate stuff and have it not mean anything. When youre being toyed with that cheaply, you forget how much you admire Nicolas Cages shamelessness and start to resent the movies.


         When we first see Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) in "Next," a confusing new thriller directed by Lee Tamahori, he's sitting alone in a diner sipping a martini and looking strikingly like Richard E. Grant after a terrible night's sleep. Cris, we soon learn, is a sad-sack Las Vegas
 magician whose rather astounding psychic abilities (he has the gift of being able see what happens to him two minutes in advance) have failed to attract much of a paying audience. Consequently, he's reduced to supplementing his income at slot machines and card tables — a talent that has
, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of casino security and a federal agent named Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore).
 
 What the casino people want from him is obvious. What the feds are after is not — and fans of the Philip K. Dick story "The Golden Man," on which screenwriter Gary Goldman based the script, will find themselves at as much of a disadvantage as everybody else. Unlike Dick's story, "Next" is set in the present, the man in question is neither golden nor particularly irresistible to women (though you might wonder if some voodoo was involved in the seduction of Jessica Biel's character), and the feds' interest in him is strictly humanitarian.
 


         






   Early in the film we learn that a nuclear bomb belonging to the Russian federation has gone missing and somebody intends to use it. Surely, a situation as grave as this would require the coordinated efforts of worldwide intelligence communities, so "Next" takes us directly to the heart of the operation: a top federal agent (Moore) who will stop at nothing to capture a clairvoyant magician who might be able to help locate the bomb.
 
 This, needless to say, inspires little confidence in the system, not to mention the movie, especially since the magician in question just wants to be left alone to pursue his dream girl. Liz Cooper (Biel) is the apparition he's been doggedly stalking since his recently expanded fortune-telling abilities first alerted him to her imminent arrival in his life. Granted, he's also worried that if he volunteers to help the authorities, he'll spend the rest of his natural life strapped to a chair with his eyelids pried open, watching newscasts to divine the location of missing children and tax frauds. You can see his problem. If this is how matters of national security are handled, we'd all do well to hole up in a rustic motel with somebody cute, forget about saving the world.
 
 For an action thriller based on a Dick story, "Next" is peculiarly low-tech and hokey. Along with his ability to see two minutes into the future, Cris is able to dodge bullets and, once he's warmed up, peel off various layers of himself to test out alternate outcomes of any given situation. As Cris romances Liz, he's dogged by the hard-driving Ferris, a cookie so cartoonishly tough her jaw seems constantly on the brink of jutting out beyond her face and punching someone. Moore has never looked more tense or, weirdly, more bored than she does here.
 
  In fact, "Next" comes across like a standard clock-puncher for almost everyone involved. We never do learn what it is that the terrorists — a small band of attractive French and German ne'er-do-wells — are up to, or why they choose the top level of the Los Angeles Times parking structure as the location of their final showdown. That part stuck with me, though. I kept wondering for hours afterward: How did they even get in there without magnetic I.D. cards? Otherwise, the title pretty much sums it up.
 
 
 
 "Next." MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action, and some language. Running time: 1 hour, 36 minutes. In general release.
 
 
   

In “Next,” a crummy action and speculative-fiction hybrid, Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future two minutes at a time.  It’s too bad that Mr. Cage couldn’t tap into those same powers of divination to save himself from making yet another inexplicably bad choice in roles. Once one of the more enthralling actors in Hollywood (“Leaving Las Vegas”), Mr. Cage these days seems all too content to waste his and the audience’s time in tacky genre throwaways, not that “The Wicker Man” or at least the hilarious highlights reel of same that eventually made it onto YouTube didn’t provide some serious yuks. What’s bittersweet about all this is that Mr. Cage remains an insistently watchable screen presence, as even this dopey movie proves. In his day job, Mr. Cage’s Cris Johnson works in a low-rent Vegas casino as a no-frills magician pulling doves out of his coat sleeves and modest factoids out of the minds of his audiences. He supplements his earnings by playing the slots and blackjack. Allergic to trouble and the overly curious, he keeps his profile low by betting only against the house, trying to cash out before he attracts too much attention. Ah, but there’s trouble afoot in the form of a pushy F.B.I. agent named Callie Ferris, played by Julianne Moore, yet another performer who seems intent on breaking the hearts of the faithful. Jaw locked, Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to be here,  and it’s no wonder. Her character is working the anti-terrorism beat, which requires her to be at once expert at her job, because she’s one of the stars of the show, and a political straw woman who freely doles out cruel and unusual punishment while talking about the greater good, mostly because the screenwriters are obviously bored. She may not be nice, but, dammit,  she is on the side of might and right. You see, there’s a Russian nuclear device gone missing, and Agent Ferris knows, despite the eyeball-rolling of her superiors and underlings, that the only thing that stands between humanity and annihilation is a Las Vegas magician with a taste for martinis and blondes. There’s more, barely. Directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Gary Goldman, Jonathan Hensleigh and Paul Bernbaum, “Next” is based on a nifty short story by Philip K. Dick titled “The Golden Man.” First published in 1954  in the science-fiction magazine If,  the story imagines a world in which mutants are rounded up and destroyed. The title character, a literally golden-hued mutant said to resemble a god, but whose intelligence comes nearer to that of an animal, can see far enough into the future to evade capture. Mr. Dick explained that the story was written when the trend in SF literature  was to glorify mutants, which he saw as a self-serving, “dangerous hunger for power on the part of neurotic people.” Mr. Dick’s story and “Next” have so little to do with each other that the writer’s die-hard fans can relax: the great man’s reputation has not been tainted by yet another knuckleheaded adaptation. Mr. Cage and Ms. Moore have it worse, since the spectacle of these two grimacing through so much risible dialogue and noisy action seems as wearing to them as to us. About the only performer who comes out unscathed here is Jessica Biel, who plays Cris’s love interest, a honey-dipped blonde named Liz Cooper. Ms. Biel enters in a gauzy light and sticks around to make goo-goo eyes at Mr. Cage in an itty-bitty towel,  delivering a vision of gilded perfection that comes tantalizingly close to Mr. Dick’s original conception. “Next” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Among the palpitating distractions are gun violence, explosions and the sight of Ms. Biel in a low-cut shirt, a sheet and that towel.

The tagline says, "If you can see the future, you can save it." For that matter, if you don't see "Next," you can save 96 minutes. What starts out as a mildly diverting thriller blows itself to smithereens in the final reel -- rather appropriately, given the nuclear bomb ticking away in the background. As a fugitive whose clairvoyant powers make him a target for both the U.S. government and some Eurotrash terrorists, Nicolas Cage should help boost audience turnout, suggesting a solid but not dazzling B.O. future for the pre-summer Paramount release.
Having recently blazed up the screen in "Ghost Rider," Cage (who also produced "Next") is once again in reluctant action-hero mode as Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas man whose ability to see two minutes into the future -- and thereby alter it -- turns out to be both a blessing and a curse.
Cris uses his talents to perform magic tricks and swindle the local casinos out of a few bucks, but the government wants him for matters of national security: Tough-as-nails FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is convinced he can help them track down a nuclear weapon that's been smuggled into the country. Likewise, the French-accented terrorists commandeering the nuke (led by German thesp Thomas Kretschmann) are desperate to eliminate Cris, lest he foil their devious (not to mention weirdly apolitical) plot.
Exactly how the feds and the bombers become aware of Cris' ESP is one of the script's many instances of narrative expediency; ditto Cris' perfectly timed meet-cute with Liz (Jessica Biel), a beautiful young woman who's been haunting his visions. After using his powers to worm his way into her affections, Cris and Liz end up leaving Las Vegas and holing up in a motel near Flagstaff, Ariz., cleverly staying ahead of his pursuers but inevitably getting himself and his lover caught in the crossfire.
From the start, the film's seeing-the-future conceit alerts the viewer that every scene might be booby-trapped -- a mere "gotcha!" speculation about what might
 happen, making "Next" play like the cinematic equivalent of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" novel. Overused gimmick not only feels all too pleased with itself but, more damagingly, has the effect of draining all suspense from the picture: Since anything can happen, who cares what does?
Pic was adapted from a Philip K. Dick short story, but while there's an unmistakable whiff of "Minority Report"-style illogic to the proceedings (and one unmistakable visual reference to "A Clockwork Orange"), the script's lack of ambiguity or moral inquiry, casual disregard for its own rules and soft-hued romantic interludes won't be to many sci-fi fans' liking. Stunning cheat of a climax, which will probably have auds hurling their wristwatches at the screen in disbelief, suggests the filmmakers were less inspired by Dick than by "Dallas."
Still, helmer Lee Tamahori ("XXX: State of the Union," "Die Another Day") handles the action capably enough, staging all manner of complicated sequences with helicopters, hordes of faceless gunmen, and cars that are all too willing to be smashed and flipped over. Beat-the-clock, defuse-the-bomb showdown, set largely on the rooftops of Los Angeles, is highly redolent of TV's "24," minus the real-time element.
Wearing a high-browed haircut with a bit more ease than Tom Hanks did in "The Da Vinci Code" and philosophizing in monotone voiceover about the nature of fate, Cage delivers his usual laconic, low-intensity antihero, consistently maintaining the upper hand without firing so much as a single shot. Thesp's lazy charm effectively counteracts the creepiness of Cris' borderline-stalkerish approach toward the much younger Liz; he actually strikes more sparks with Moore's brittle, humorless FBI agent, even if the latter spends most of the pic looking as if she could use a good night's sleep.
Tech package is on the stripped-down and grungy side, despite some fairly obvious application of visual effects (with contributions from no less than seven f/x houses). Locations, sprawling from Sin City to the Grand Canyon, add some personality, while Mark Isham's percussive score ably conveys the sense of time quickly passing.
