A vibrant, mature love letter to the making of movies, the meaning of movies, and the dark-eyed muse Penélope Cruz, Pedro Almodóvar's Broken Embraces  doesn't so much break new ground in the filmmaker's instantly recognizable terrain as deepen an Almodóvarian's understanding of how this uniquely stylish Spanish artist sees the world. And as every frame of this chic and playful comedy/melodrama attests, he sees the world  of personal relationships and creative collaboration, of natural landscape and man-made decor  through a cinephile's magnifying lens.
Lluís Homar plays a blind screenwriter who was once a movie director and who once loved his leading lady (Cruz, delectable). As for the lady, she was once the mistress of a jealous tycoon, who once bullied his gay son into spying on the mistress by documenting the shooting of their ill-fated collaboration   a movie bearing a crazy resemblance to Almodóvar's own classic Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown . The plot thickens! Further fun: Many of the characters go by two different names. So best advice for optimum viewing is, see Broken Embraces ...twice.


 Can there be such a thing as exuberant melancholy? I can’t think of another way to describe the spirit of “Broken Embraces,” Pedro Almodóvar’s latest film, the title of which carries a telling hint of paradox. It is grave and effervescent, tender and cruel.  The story might seem simple at first — a film noir potboiler of jealousy and revenge — but as it unfolds, the narrative reveals an intricate and enigmatic structure, full of twists and reversals. The visual and aural textures are lush and sensual, as we’ve come to expect from Mr. Almodóvar, and yet the rich colors and deep sonorities somehow illuminate an unusually austere emotional terrain.  Like “All About My Mother,” “Talk to Her,” “Bad Education” and “Volver” — not a bad decade’s work, by the way — “Broken Embraces” leaves the viewer in a contradictory state, a mixture of devastation and euphoria, amusement and dismay that deserves its own clinical designation. Call it Almodóvaria, a syndrome from which some of us are more than happy to suffer.  Mr. Almodóvar’s characters tend to be stricken with their own versions of the malady — subject to strong and confused longings, surprised by pain in their pursuits of pleasure. When we first meet him, Harry Caine (Lluís Homar), the central male figure in “Broken Embraces,” seems to have found a cure. A writer and former film director, Harry is blind as the result of a long-ago car accident and skilled at using his disability as a tool of seduction. He is looked after by Judit (Blanca Portillo), who used to be his production assistant, and by her son, Diego (Tamar Novas), and generally appears content to live in a sunny present tense of casual sex, steady work and easy friendship.  Mr. Almodóvar has a gift for happy beginnings. But the law of narrative (and the law of desire, to cite one of his early titles) mandates trouble, and Harry’s curious English pseudonym, evoking both “The Third Man” and “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” is a premonition of lurking shadows. Harry’s current life, it turns out, is an edifice of willed forgetting and strenuous denial. His past is a secret he is trying to keep, above all from himself. But circumstances conspire to pry open the vault, and Harry is compelled to tell the tragic story of the man he used to be.  Reviewers are frequently cautioned against ruining the end of a movie. In the case of Mr. Almodóvar, whose plots thicken and explode according to their own peculiar logic, we risk spoiling the middle, so I’ll try to be circumspect when it comes to further summary.  At the same time, though, the tale framed by Harry’s reminiscence is so strange and beautiful, so perfectly realized, that no exposition could damage it. The word flashback hardly does justice to the episode from Harry’s old life — when he was a dashing, sighted cinéaste named Mateo Blanco — that lifts “Broken Embraces” into the company of Mr. Almodóvar’s other recent masterworks.  Back then, 14 years before the bright, blinded present, Mateo, whose surname connotes both innocence and blankness, embarked on an ambitious film project — a comedy called “Girls and Suitcases” — and also on a headlong, perilous affair with an actress. Her name was Lena, and she was the mistress of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel (José Luis Gómez), who was the film’s main financial backer. Let the past tense in that sentence stand as an indication of how it all ended. The fact that Lena is played by Penélope Cruz may tell you everything else you need to know.  Or maybe not. Ms. Cruz has become Mr. Almodóvar’s link to the glorious movie-star traditions of the past. In “Volver” he made her an incarnation of melodramatic maternity, evoking the wounded resilience of Anna Magnani and Joan Crawford without sacrificing her natural comic verve. Here she adopts a more haunted and haunting persona, that of a woman trapped by circumstances and by her own choices in a wrenching professional and romantic dilemma.  But since Mr. Almodóvar’s sympathy gravitates naturally toward women, Lena is much more than a static image of female suffering or an object of male hunger. Shadows of past screen goddesses may still flicker across her face and form — Audrey Hepburn, Gloria Grahame, Simone Signoret — but she seems at once freer and more vulnerable than they were.  Mr. Almodóvar’s engagement with the great traditions of movie melodrama is never merely nostalgic. In the phase of his career that began in 1995 with “The Flower of My Secret” he has drawn particular inspiration from Hollywood directors of the 1950s, including Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray, all of whom used relatively new techniques of color cinematography to discover fresh and uncanny registers of feeling. The unsettled intensity that was Ray’s particular specialty — the sense, so vivid in his best films, of wild emotions obeying their own dangerous logic — infuses the middle section of “Broken Embraces,” much of which takes place on the windswept volcanic island of Lanzarote.  But the most direct and striking dialogue the movie conducts with a filmmaker from the past is with Pedro Almodóvar himself. Aficionados will recognize “Girls and Suitcases,” bits of which turn up in “Broken Embraces,” most powerfully at the end, as a replica of “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” Mr. Almodóvar’s marvelous madcap comedy from 1988. Its appearance is not vanity or clever self-quotation. Rather, the director’s pastiche of his early, funny work becomes, in the context of this somber new film, a poignant reflection on aging and loss. To catch a glimpse of “Women” in the mirror of “Embraces” is to see how cinematic images can be both tangible and ghostly.  And also — literally in the case of Harry Caine and “Girls and Suitcases” — invisible to their maker, who is no longer the man he was. He has lost so much over the years. Every one of us has, and if Mr. Almodóvar has grown wise enough to understand that art is a dreadfully inadequate compensation, he is still generous enough to offer it to us anyway.  “Broken Embraces” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity and adult sorrow.

Partly a film about films and partly a film about love, Pedro Almodovar�s �Broken Embraces� can�t quite decide where its allegiances lie. A restless, rangy and frankly enjoyable genre-juggler that combines melodrama, comedy and more noir-hued darkness than ever before, the pic is held together by the extraordinary force of Almodovar�s cinematic personality. But while its four-way in extremis love story dazzles, it never really catches fire. The Spanish helmer�s biggest-budgeted and longest movie to date will get warm hugs from local auds on release March 18; headed for Cannes in May, it goes out Stateside via Sony Pictures Classics later this year.
There�s a sense here that Almodovar, who�s now a stylistic law unto himself, may be more interested in stretching himself technically than in engaging with issues of the wider world. Card-carrying fans can prepare themselves for a rare treat. But those who hoped the pic would extend the quieter, more personal mood shown in �Volver,� as the 59-year-old helmer moves into the late phase of his career, will be disappointed to find that �Embraces� is made not of flesh and blood, but of celluloid.
  Harry Caine (Lluis Homar, �Bad Education�) is a blind screenwriter and former director whose real name, which he abandoned after losing his sight in a car crash, is Mateo Blanco. News arrives of the death of corrupt stockbroker Ernesto Martel (Jose Luis Gomez), who once produced a movie Blanco directed, �Girls and Suitcases.�
Blanco�s former production manager, Judit (Blanca Portillo), who holds a candle for him, seems nervous at the news. And then a pretentious young man calling himself Ray X (Ruben Ochandiano), who turns out to be Martel�s son, asks Blanco to help write a script that�s intended as an act of vengeance against his neglectful father.
The film now flashes back to 1992, when Martel fell for his secretary, a wannabe actress-cum-part-time call girl, Lena (Penelope Cruz). By 1994, he and Lena are an item. However, when Lena auditions for �Girls and Suitcases,� Blanco also falls for her.
Chagrined, Martel gets his son (also Ochandiano, here as a wildly gauche, camp teenager) to spy on Blanco and Lena under the guise of making a docu about the shoot. Watching Martel�s life fall apart, as a lip reader (Lola Duenas) decodes Lena and Blanco�s conversations in the boy�s footage, is hilarious. But any compassion for Martel evaporates in the laughter -- one of several moments when the film deliberately undermines a particular mood.
Following a disastrous trip to Ibiza, Martel and Lena break up, and Martel initiates a slow, costly revenge designed to destroy Blanco. Hereon, much of the action takes place amid the volcanic landscapes of Lanzarote, opening things visually even as the drama becomes more and more claustrophobic.
Script moves fluidly back and forth in time, with superb editing by regular Jose Salcedo, and some of the witty, pointed dialogue is among Almodovar�s best. The labyrinthine plot is thick with twists, turns and resonances. But a couple of questions linger -- especially that the revelations in the final reel would hardly have remained under wraps for 14 years, given Blanco�s suspicions.
Cruz delivers a compelling, subtle perf as a woman continually aware that the shadow of tragedy hovers over her. But because her character is effectively split into three -- Magdalena the grieving daughter, Lena the actress and lover, and Pina in �Girls and Suitcases� -- auds will struggle to locate an emotional center behind the thesp�s dizzying range of costumes and wigs.
Homar, who literally wears Almodovar�s own �90s wardrobe, makes a commanding screen presence as Caine/Blanco, but the character�s reactions to his multiple tragedies (including being blinded) seem stoical to the point of catatonia. Gomez and Portillo are solid in theslightly smaller roles of Martel and Judit, respectively. Multiple cameos -- including one by the helmer�s producer brother, Agustin -- are enjoyable, though none help move the story forward.
Visually, the pic is an exquisite treat. Every richly hued wall is covered with eye-candy artwork, every doorway reps a second level of framing, and there is beauty even in the scattered contents of a drawer or in a pile of torn-up photos. Closeups are regularly used, particularly of Cruz�s hypnotically photogenic features.
Cinematic references abound. Several scenes featuring dangerous staircases recall Henry Hathaway�s �40s noir �Kiss of Death.� Pic�s title alludes to the Pompeii scene in Roberto Rossellini�s 1954 classic, �Voyage to Italy,� which Lena and Blanco watch in Lanzarote. And the entertaining �Girls and Suitcases� is a clear homage to Almodovar�s 1988 hit, �Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.� Score by longtime collaborator Alberto Iglesias superbly evokes the moods and movies �Embraces� is so in thrall to. 


"Everything's already happened to me," admits Harry Caine , the blind, middle-aged filmmaker in Broken Embraces . "All that's left is to enjoy life." ¡Sí!  His own sights set low these days in his latest movie, reformed bad boy Pedro Almodóvar  has at least hit on a vivid metaphor for his diminished condition. Indeed, three decades into his career as a name-brand fashioner of zesty soapers, Spanish cinema's most beloved export could direct un film de Almodóvar  with his eyes shut and still get a rise out of his fans. So who could blame the matador for letting the bull run the show this time?
Equal parts comic melodrama and film noir, and twice as fun as it ought to be, Broken Embraces  boasts more bifurcations than any two Hitchcock classics. Channeling Audrey Hepburn , Almodóvar muse Penélope Cruz  plays Lena, a Madrid  secretary who moonlights as a hooker named Severine before turning full-time to (what else?) film acting. Pretending to be in love with ancient Ernesto (José Luis Gómez ), her boss-turned-producer, Lena is secretly carrying on with her director, Mateo Blanco  (Lluís Homar), who changes his name to Harry Caine upon losing his eyesight in a car crash. Fourteen years after the accident, a gay, twice-married goofball who calls himself Ray X is identified by blind Harry as actually being Ernesto Jr. (Rubén Ochandiano ), who had once shot a documentary on the set of Harry/Mateo's Girls and Suitcases , starring Lena. That zany comedy—vindictively edited by its producer, Ernesto Sr.—is a dead ringer for Almodóvar's Women on the Verge . . . .
Got all that? No matter. Though Almodóvar takes 10 sheets of press-kit paper to summarize and explicate the film, he still leaves out some details, none of which are terribly important. For all its narrative incident, related through a flurry of loosely motivated flashbacks and -forwards, Broken Embraces  goes disarmingly light on cause and effect. Call it a labyrinth of passion. Harry's production manager, Judit (Blanca Portillo ), silently carries a torch for him; her DJ son, Diego (Tamar Novas ), lands in a coma by accidentally mixing Ecstasy and GHB; Rossellini's Voyage to Italy  is playing on TV while Mateo and Lena are on vacation themselves—this is the shaggiest of Almodóvar's movies, the most enamored of storytelling for its own sake, since 1984's enjoyably baffling What Have I Done to Deserve This?  Many critics have responded negatively after festival screenings, docking the erstwhile master of candy-colored mise-en-scène for leaning too heavily on dialogue—but Almodóvar's talk-to-me approach here seems perfectly suited to his protagonist's loss of vision, if not to his own.
Blatantly cruddy by Almodóvar standards, the first shot of Broken Embraces  is a brown-tinged peek through the kind of video camera used on a film set to deliver instant playback of scenes. What it shows is a group of actors, including Cruz's Lena, getting ready for a take; what it represents is an old-school celluloidist's fear of DV. Pushing 60, Almodóvar seems aware of both bodily and aesthetic fragility as never before; some of the bloom has faded even from his rosier images, which gives Broken Embraces  an extra dimension of melodrama despite the director's bid to hang loose in his "old" age.
Fossilized Ernesto, plotting revenge from behind the scenes, conspires to rearrange Suitcases  and Lena both. Is it too late for another of Almodóvar's miraculously happy endings? As the power of cinema brings a Broken  character back from the dead, some of what's been out of order fits back together—not least in the editing room. Maybe Almodóvar—blindly optimistic, confident enough to coast—has still got it after all.
