Let no one ever say that Dark Streets
 doesn�t have the perfect title. It may not be much more than a stylized regurgitation of creaky film-noir clich�s and crime-fiction conventions � but its streets are undeniably dark. As are its bedrooms, boardrooms, hallways, and power plants. In fact, the whole movie looks like it was shot through a piece of cheesecloth, as if the search for the right visual complement to this tale of urban decay, melancholy, and murder caused director Samuels to overshoot symbolic murkiness and crash-land in a world of near-comic indecipherability. Watching it, I felt like Claudius at the opening-night performance of The Mousetrap
 � Give me some light!
 � and entertained a similar notion of stomping out of the theatre. But no one ever said being a film critic would be a bowl of chocolate ice cream, so I toughed it out (with help from the film�s soundtrack, a collection of blues originals performed by legends like Etta James, Aaron Neville, and B.B. King, all of whom know a little something about spinning darkness into art) and managed, with considerable squinting, to tie together the various strands of the movie�s muddled storyline. Mann plays Chaz Davenport, the despondent son of a rich but recently deceased father living in a crime-ridden Depression-era city where gangsters have hijacked the municipal power supply. He�s in debt to loan sharks all over town, but the nightclub he owns doesn�t make any money. So, facing the prospect of an unpleasant death, Chaz does what any red-blooded man living on borrowed time would do: He drinks to excess and sleeps with as many of the club�s dancers as he can. This includes mysterious new girl Madelaine (Miko), a femme fatale with doe eyes, a seductive singing voice, and a creepy father (Koteas) who looks like Erich von Stroheim in The Grand Illusion
 � if von Stroheim�s character in Grand Illusion
 were the synthesizer player in a goth band. It�s not clear what Madelaine and her dad are up to, whether they�re looking to protect Chaz or ruin him, or if Chaz realizes just how much trouble he�s in, but what is
 clear is that Samuels and screenwriter Wallace King are huge Mickey Spillane fans. They happily chart their hero�s descent into the criminal underworld with that familiar brand of naked-city, private-detective, raincoats-and-fedoras, tough-guys-and-dangerous-dames, pop-existential street poetry Spillane raised to an art form but that has long since become a formula and a gag. Dark Streets
 may be rich in mood, but it�s less an original movie than a copy of a copy of a copy of something Hollywood once dabbled in and then forgot about, a collection of 1950s B-movie mannerisms that would have made for a great parody if only it were capable of laughing at its own hard-boiled absurdity.

Dark Streets , a pre-WWII-set oddity, attempts to marry two faded genres: the musical and film noir. Mad Men 's Gabriel Mann stars as a playboy investigating the supposed suicide of his father. Meanwhile, the fact that he owns a nightclub provides the excuse to feature some vibrantly choreographed, extravagantly costumed song-and-dance numbers. Alas, the flimsy plot  less a whodunit than an isn't-it-screamingly- obvious-that-that-guy-done-it!  will have thriller fans singing the blues.

“Dark Streets” has atmosphere coming out its ears, but not much going on between them. Based on a stage musical by Glenn M. Stewart and brought to the screen by the director Rachel Samuels, this lush film noir musical spares no imaginative expense on the décor of sultry nightclubs, the density of fake fog on brooding streets, the lighting of Art Deco lobbies and the parade of sleek, glittering, sexed-up costumes that variously suggest the 1930s, haute couture sadomasochism and “Cabaret Beyond the Thunderdome.” It’s a whole lot to look  at, and there’s plenty to listen to as well: the score includes performances by Etta James, Aaron Neville and Chaka Khan. This music, mostly the blues, is pantomimed by the denizens of the Tower nightclub, who find themselves ensnared in a lackluster mystery involving the playboy owner, Chaz Davenport (Gabriel Mann), a shady police lieutenant (Elias Koteas) and a pair of femmes fatales (Bijou Phillips and Izabella Miko). Diverting enough as a series of music videos, “Dark Streets” strikes postures in place of drama. The plot, such as it is, seems like a pretext for the nonstop musical numbers; you can feel the energy slacken every time the spectacle pauses to register, ineffectually, a human presence or a story worth telling. “Dark Streets” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some sexual content, drug use and brief violent images.

Feebly mixing film noir and the old-time nightclub musical, "Dark Streets" could do with illumination in more ways than one. Snapped up after its odd jury prize at CineVegas, this under-budgeted, '30s-set pic wants auds to believe power blackouts in an unnamed city are to blame for the woes of club owner Chaz Davenport (Gabriel Mann), even as ostentatious production numbers in the spirit of Coppola's "Cotton Club" keep the joint jumping. A dozen original blues tunes, featuring vocals by Etta James, Natalie Cole and others, likely won't push the film past its mid-December platform release in Gotham and L.A.
Based on producer Glenn M. Stewart's 2004 stage musical "The City Club," the pic opens with a literal bang, as a man is shot point-blank in the head, followed by a narrator's hardboiled voiceover: "A bullet's kiss is a cold way to meet betrayal." That ridiculous line inspires an early wish for camp, which director Rachel Samuels ("The Suicide Club"), straining to capture period on a budget, doesn't fulfill.
As a dancing chanteuse, Bijou Phillips gives it her all, which isn't enough, and a wooden Mann doesn't help, although Izabella Miko brings a modicum of unaffected charm to her role as the Other Woman.
Tech credits run the gamut from impressive sound design to editing that tries and fails to paper the production's cracks. Pretentious film, shot largely in downtown L.A., is dedicated to the New Orleans musicians affected by Hurricane Katrina.


So obsessed with mimicry it's practically a tribute band of a movie, Dark Streets  throws copious amounts of film-noir style at the screen in the hopes that something will stick. Based on Glenn M. Stewart 's musical The City Club , Dark  Streets  unfolds in and around a rollicking urban nightclub that, despite mounting debts, miraculously manages to keep delivering new extravagantly choreographed and costumed song-and-dance numbers every night. As if owner Chaz (Gabriel Mann ) wasn't busy enough keeping the place afloat, he's also juggling the rival affections of his featured singer (Bijou Phillips ) and a new chanteuse (Izabella Miko ), while also investigating a possible connection between citywide blackouts and the mysterious death of his father. Directed by Rachel Samuels , Dark Streets  is less a narrative than a suite of original blues and jazz songs that occasionally pauses to allow for some convoluted exposition, replete with hard-boiled dialogue. Photographed with generically "moody" cinematography meant to emulate noir's sultry sex-and-sin atmosphere—basically, it looks like Chicago  and Moulin Rouge , but cheaper—the film has its shallow pleasures, but once it becomes obvious that that's all Dark Streets  has going for it, the affected performances and forced tough-guy speak stop feeling playful and start to become oppressive. The filmmakers seem to think that if they ape their influences enough, maybe some of the grit and soul will rub off on their own project. It don't work that way, toots.
