Many a tear has been shed over gentrification's pitiless march. But no one has wept with as much ingenuity as writer-director Michel Gondry in "Be Kind Rewind." When the goodly Passaic, N.J., developers tell old Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) the city's going to tear down Be Kind Rewind, his corner video mart, to put up a nicer building, you might take a look at the cramped brown shack and wonder, "Does a store specializing in VHS rentals have any business being open in 2008?" Probably not.
But logic on any level is the last thing Gondry is worried about. It's the last thing you should worry about, too. Especially once that store becomes a makeshift film studio in whose name Mos Def and Jack Black remake Mr. Fletcher's damaged inventory. It starts with "Ghostbusters" and culminates in a flurry of no-budget round-the-clock custom-made productions - "RoboCop," "Last Tango in Paris," "King Kong," "Carrie," "Boyz N the Hood." Their rousingly bad moviemaking brings out some of Gondry's most blissful.
How this comes to pass is better left for a first-hand encounter or for a roundtable discussion at a science-fiction convention. Suffice it to say that Mike (Mos Def) and Jerry (Black) spring to action after Jerry demagnetizes all the videocassettes in a freak accident. Mike is minding the store while Mr. Fletcher's away and decides it'd be easier to shoot a ghetto "Ghostbusters" than buy it from the West Coast Video down the street. So with a lot of tinfoil and Mike's emergency casting ("I'm Bill Murray and you're everybody else") a craze is born.
Soon hipsters, thugs, regular folks, and Mia Farrow (having a ball playing a woman named Miss Falewicz) are lining up to order titles. And Mike, Jerry, and their quick-thinking co-conspirator Alma (the heart-meltingly wonderful Mel onie Diaz), are charging $20 rental fees for movies they claim are from Sweden. Thus their remakes are instantly called "sweded" versions, a perfect term less since it recalls the cinema of Ingmar Bergman and more because it evokes the process of assembling cheap, boxed furniture yourself. Gondry has hit upon the Ikea version of moviemaking.
Really, all these three are making is viral videos. Here, though, the virus brings people out of their houses and onto the streets. Once things start looking especially dire for the store, the people of Passaic come together to help with the sweding. Production increases, as do the odds of raising enough money to save the store. This is WeTube.
It's refreshing to see Gondry's moviemaking still possessed by the community spirit he caught a few years ago with "Dave Chappelle's Block Party." That terrific documentary required the director, in part, to defer his own dreaminess to help make the dreams of some everyday people from Ohio come true. He filmed their trip to an all-day, all-star concert Chappelle put on in Brooklyn.
The movie was full of celebrities, but amazingly Gondry made no distinction between the kids in the marching band and Kanye West, Erykah Badu, or Mos Def, who stole his scenes from behind a drum kit. Mos Def is as pragmatically hilarious in this new movie as Jack Black is epically obnoxious. If Bill Cosby and Jerry Lewis had made a Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder comedy by Hasbro
, it'd go something like this. I'll have "Bustin' Loose," super-sweded, please.
Gondry's illusory summer-camp aesthetic (all the tricks feel done with Popsicle sticks, paste, and construction paper) is as accessible here as it is in his ads and music videos. In this movie, it's made to seem egalitarian: Anyone can do this. (Would that it were so.) But the situationists in the audience will be thrilled: Gondry makes art part of everyday social life. The remakes themselves double as tributes and feats of film criticism. I doubt I could better explain what's wrong with "Driving Miss Daisy" than to have Mos Def rolling his eye at Black's Jessica Tandy impersonation.
"Be Kind Rewind" is as civic-minded an adventure as "Block Party." But Gondry still refuses to succumb to the perceived limits of common sense or realism. His naivete (and his characters') bumps up against certain urban realities that may be too strong to ignore. The movie's title is an unheeded plea for mercy and a sense of history.
Gondry may have overwritten parts of his petition. There's a mythical subplot about how the video store was also the birthplace of the jazzman Fats Waller. But even that occasions a beautiful collection of scenes in which Be Kind Rewind productions shoots a movie about Waller, and one funny moment in which the cast and crew of the biopic stop in their tracks at the sight of Jerry, who mistakenly assumes he'll be playing Waller. Glover, who's great, takes him outside and gives him a lecture we see but don't hear. Presumably he's saying, "You're not Jack Blackface."
This is all a radical thematic departure from Gondry's "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "The Science of Sleep." Now the director wants to build communities and connect people rather than dreamily personify the erasure of the bonds between them. The interiority and subconscious surrealist eruptions that seem so nocturnal in his other movies see the literal light of day in this one. And the sunshine here really does feel eternal. It comes from the sky and from street-level, too. It's in the faces of the charismatic men and women acting for his cameras and for Mike and Jerry's.
Of course, the reason for all this lightness is actually rather sad. Another local business is on the verge of biting the dust. You'd expect a magician obsessed with warping the rhythms of time - with rewinding - to stop the clock. But he bravely concedes that even he's powerless to stop this.


The real Passaic, N.J., is a polyglot industrial city north of Newark, with a great immigrant history and a finger-snapping shortlist of showbiz native sons including Donald Fagen and Paul Rudd. The imaginary Passaic of Be Kind Rewind  is an urban playground situated somewhere between Brigadoon and Sesame Street. In this town not so much forgotten by time as turned into a touristic Retroland and hobby camp by writer-director Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ), dreamers, doodlers, and people who like things just the way they've always been tend to hang out at the local video-rental store, Be Kind Rewind, a shop stocked in the Soviet-era Bulgarian tradition: If it's not VHS copies of Ghostbusters, Rush Hour 2,  Driving Miss Daisy , or a few other moldy crowd-pleasers you want, go to some other, more impersonal video-chain outlet across the street.
At Be Kind, time stands defiantly still. The store's owner, Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover), is a proprietor in the tradition of oldies about to be run over by the wheels of progress. He fights off modernity with a Frederick Douglass haircut and a passion for the late jazz genius Fats Waller. Mr. Fletcher is proud to claim that back in the day, Waller was born right upstairs from the shop; and in the face of insensitive civic plans for charmless urban renewal, he argues that the historical significance of the Waller connection ought to be enough to protect his corner from demolition. The old man is supported in his fight by his acolyte and employee, Mike (Mos Def), and Mike's childhood friend Jerry (Jack Black), a local mechanic who lives in a junkyard trailer and fights the power, literally, of the local power plant in his considerable spare time.
Mike and Jerry bloom into full-tilt Gondrian characters when the latter has an ill-advised close encounter with the power plant's electromagnetic field, briefly turns into a walking magnet, and accidentally erases every videotape in the shop. Mr. Fletcher is fortuitously out of town, so Jerry and Mike dream up a scheme. Whenever a customer requests a movie, the guys simply reshoot it, Ghostbusters  being the test case. Their tools: found objects, local talent, and the kind of abundant whimsy in which the filmmaker has always earnestly delighted, from his first feature (Human Nature ) to his most recent (The Science of Sleep ).
The boys also inadvertently save the town. Be Kind Rewind  is, on one level, then, about the magic that can happen in fairy tales  and only in fairy tales  when enough people who like the good old ways band together to keep things simple yet cunning, like the handmade-crafts e-tailers who sell on etsy.com. (Gondry's French artisanal ethic finds its American counterpart in that of Wes Anderson, as does his Gallic liability to let his stories waft off into Euro-whimsy; this Passaic might as well nestle on the banks of the Loire River.) On another level, though, the movie is a sop to the indulgent prevailing notion that other people's art is fair game as the raw material for our own funsy home projects  mash-ups are one of a dozen examples  and that group in-jokes count as citizen involvement. The Be Kind remakes catch, especially when marketed by Mike and Jerry as Swedish imports. (In Gondry's twinky jargon, the new homemade version is said to have been ''Sweded.'') Ostensibly made out of little more than cardboard and love, these reconstituted movies are in fact sophisticated stylistic deconstructions  it just so happens that the supposedly average Our Town  locals possess artistic skills worthy of a Bauhaus student ball.
Def doesn't do much new, walking a familiar character line between earnest and simple; Black does even less new, running the same crazy-jerk-hipster machinery that was in peak operating condition five years ago in School of Rock . Still, there's nothing not to like about the movie, a teensy, hand-crocheted trifle, fitted with embroidered pockets of guest stardom, including Mia Farrow as the nice local lady who wants to see what Ghostbusters  is all about and Ghostbusters ' own Sigourney Weaver as a movie-studio corporate meanie, ha-ha. (Weaver appears to have wandered in off the set of Working Girl .) Then again, there's no logic to hang on to either, in Gondry's fiddle-di-dee suggestion that commercial movies are cooler when they are rewound into home movies with the production values of YouTube parodies.

 In its sweet, lackadaisical way, Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind” illuminates the pleasures and paradoxes of movie love. Its two main characters, a pair of Passaic, N.J., loafers named Mike and Jerry, are devotees of the Hollywood mainstream, paying tribute to well-worn classics like “Ghostbusters,” “Driving Miss Daisy,” “Rush Hour 2” and “The Lion King.” The way they express this affection lands Mike and Jerry in a spot of copyright trouble, but they (and Mr. Gondry) provide a welcome reminder that even the slickest blockbuster is also a piece of handicraft, an artifact of somebody’s nutty, unbounded ingenuity and the potential object of somebody else’s innocent, childlike fascination.  Mike (Mos Def) works in a shabby video store whose owner, Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover), has not yet made the leap to DVD. His business threatened by the dubious improvements of a city-backed redevelopment scheme, Mr. Fletcher sneaks away on a mysterious trip, leaving the blundering, well-intentioned Mike in charge of his stock of battered VHS cassettes. Jerry (Jack Black), an avant-garde auto mechanic and tireless tinkerer, suffers an accident that magnetizes his body, causing  him to accidentally erase all the tapes.  So when a loyal customer named Miss Falewicz (Mia Farrow) shows up for her daily rental, Mike and Jerry must improvise. They do what anyone would: hurriedly reshoot famous movies using a camcorder, various local characters and some common household objects.  Of course, not everyone would or could figure out how to turn pizza pies and cardboard boxes into special effects. Mr. Gondry is a highly skilled and practiced professional, a visual magician responsible for such enchantments as “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (in collaboration with Charlie Kaufman), “Dave Chappelle’s Block Party” (with Dave Chappelle) and “The Science of Sleep” (all by himself). But as tricky and refined as his techniques may be, the spirit in which he deploys them is delightedly amateurish and winningly democratic. In the world of his films drab city neighborhoods are zones of oddity and wonder, their possibilities waiting to be unlocked by accident or whim. Daily life is a series of art projects waiting to happen.  “Be Kind Rewind” is pervaded by an easy, occasionally antic good humor. Like “The Science of Sleep,” it meanders occasionally toward melancholy or misunderstanding, but for the most part avoids conflict or intense feeling. In their speech patterns and styles of behavior, Mos Def and Mr. Black seem like a couple of overgrown 12-year-olds, and Alma (Melonie Diaz), the young woman who joins their cinematic enterprise, seems less like a potential love interest than a girl given permission to enter the secret clubhouse.  In any case, Mr. Gondry’s shaggy-dog neighborhood chronicle is really a loose frame for Mike and Jerry’s creations, and for the exquisite black-and-white Fats Waller biopic that turns out to be their masterpiece. Miss Falewicz, who has never seen “Ghostbusters,” is glad to be fooled by the clumsy, highly foreshortened version that Mike and Jerry send her home with. But their way of remaking movies —  called “Sweding” for no very compelling reason — catches on even with customers who know better, and before long lines are forming around the block.  And why not? At the “Be Kind Rewind” Web site (bekindmovie.com), Mr. Black’s voice defines Sweding as “putting YOU into the thing you like,” and there is a quiet strain of populist defiance buried in Mr. Gondry’s wonder cabinet. Commercial pop culture is, too often, understood as a top-down enterprise, its expensive, disposable products passively consumed by the public.  And yet at the same time that stuff is capable of inspiring a deep and durable sense of ownership. The movies we love belong in some profound way to us, and part of us lives inside them. Sweding is Mr. Gondry’s way of making that rather abstract sense of connection literal, of suggesting that even if we are not strictly speaking the owners and authors of the movies we like, well, then, perhaps we should be.  It goes without saying that this is a naïve, utopian point of view. The travestied films in “Be Kind Rewind” are the intellectual property of large corporations (as is Mr. Gondry’s movie), and you can be sure that teams of lawyers were consulted and paid before the Sweding went very far. But “Be Kind” hardly pretends otherwise. Instead it treats movies as found objects, as material to be messed around with, explored and reimagined. It connects the do-it-yourself aesthetic of YouTube and other digital diversions with the older, predigital impulse to put on a show in the backyard or play your favorite band’s hits with your buddies in the garage.  And the deep charm of Mr. Gondry’s film is that it allows the audience to experience it with the same kind of casual fondness. It is propelled by neither the psychology of its characters nor the machinery of its plot, but rather by a leisurely desire to pass the time, to see what happens next, to find out what would happen if you tried to re-enact “Ghostbusters” in your neighbor’s kitchen. It’s inviting, undemanding and altogether wonderful. You’ll want to see it again, or at least Swede it yourself.  “Be Kind Rewind” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing and Sweded sex and violence.

It's a quick trip from whimsy to silliness in "Be Kind Rewind," a notably ephemeral work by Michel Gondry, whose flights of fancy can't overcome the egregious illogic of the premise. A few geeks and VHS cultists may cotton to the spectacle of two videostore clerks compensating for the accidental erasure of commercial tapes by shooting their own versions of "Ghostbusters," "Rush Hour 2" and "Driving Miss Daisy," but inspiration is as meager as the antics of Jack Black and Mos Def are lame. Fact that, after its fleeting theatrical runs, this New Line release will rapidly move to its natural home on DVD -- but emphatically not on VHS -- ironically underscores the film's screwy cultural and technological disjunctures.
After partnering with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman on his first two features, "Human Nature" and the borderline sublime "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (which had to do with erasure of a slightly different kind), Gondry penned his own scripts for "The Science of Sleep" and this one. Left to his own devices without a strong collaborative scribe, Gondry has a tendency toward frivolous quirks and contrived farce that is not encouraging.
One can feel unkindly toward "Be Kind Rewind" on either a literal-minded or an impressionistic basis. Taken at all realistically, the yarn's very foundations are preposterously corny.
Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) maintains a video-only rental shop in run-down Passaic, N.J., in a building he claims was once home to jazz great Fats Waller. With the place condemned for redevelopment, vacation-bound Fletcher leaves the store in the hands of clerk Mike (Def), hoping he can revive business and keep the dingy place open.
The neighborhood wild card is Jerry (Black), an unshushable misfit who becomes electrified and magnetized by the local power plant and, in short order, begins unwittingly erasing the store's videos. Rather than finding substitute copies or taping them off DVDs from the big competitor down the street, the buddies procure a large video camera and shoot their own highly abbreviated versions and pass these on to customers, at least one of whom, lonely sparrow Miss Falewicz (Mia Farrow), doesn't know the difference.
Gondry places the action emphatically in the present, when the mere existence of a vid-only store (unlike, for instance, a vinyl LP specialist) is a total anachronism; moving back the time frame 15 or 20 years would have removed a big credibility issue and sacrificed nothing except the absurdist dimension.
Worse, however, is that the videos (inexplicably called "sweded" films) Mike and Jerry make would seem to be totally terrible. Gondry concentrates on the vids' frantic production -- with makeshift costumes and special effects for the likes of "RoboCop," "2001" and "King Kong," hopeless stunts for "Rush Hour 2" and preschool-level docu and animation facsimiles for "When We Were Kings" and "The Lion King," respectively -- and shows almost nothing of the final results (which are, however, offered for viewer delectation online). Film's Preston Sturges-like, young-doofuses-make-good resolution pivots on the proposition that the homemovies become popular with local residents, but there's no internal evidence that this could be in any sense true. To the contrary.
But enough small-minded literalism; Gondry would seem to have intended "Be Kind Rewind" more as a generous, sweet-tempered comic fable. But the souffle never rises, for reasons that begin with the fact that the disheveled Jerry seems like a certifiable lunatic in immediate need of extended treatment. With the exception of a couple of nice pantomimic moves immediately after having been zapped, Black overdoes it awfully here in an overwhelmingly unamusing performance. No matter what he did, Def couldn't help but seem low-key by contrast, but, in any event, his mild-mannered turn makes a soft impact. Sigourney Weaver turns up briefly as a corporate lawyer who confronts the boys with some legitimate copyright infringement issues.
Given the setup's spoof potential, "Be Kind Rewind" might have cut it as a sophomoric student project or a goof-off comedy. But sticking it in something resembling the real world and pinning idealistic social significance to the desperate shenanigans of its screw-loose protags knocks it down for the count almost before it begins.
Production values are a few notches higher than those of the boys' own productions, and notably so in the musical department, especially when Fats Waller chimes in.

Like his previous feature The Science of Sleep , Michel Gondry 's gently outlandish Be Kind Rewind  is a fantasy about fantasy—a fragile, somewhat precious celebration of DIY filmmaking and cult-film consumption that, given its gaps in logic, spectators are more or less obliged to mentally assemble on their own. The setting is a counterfactual universe in which VHS tapes remain rentable commodities, and Passaic , New Jersey, is the former world capital of jazz—mainly because someone claims it as the birthplace of the movie's presiding deity, stride pianist Fats Waller . Although shot on location, Gondry's Passaic is a sister city to Chelm, or one of the other towns found in Yiddish folklore that is populated by cheerfully self-absorbed fools. The two principle village idiots, Jerry (Jack Black ) and Mike (Mos Def ), are introduced painting a Fats Waller mural beneath a highway underpass—an example of vernacular surrealism in which an eye is mistakenly substituted for a nostril.
Mike is a clerk in the rundown Be Kind Rewind video store located, according to its crusty proprietor Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover ), in the ground floor of the very building where Waller was born. Jerry, an auto mechanic, is Mike's childhood buddy and the store's most annoying customer—his natural idiocy exacerbated by his trailer's proximity to the local power plant. Hence the protective strainer he wears on his head. While Mos Def is effectively (and affectingly) dim, Black is iconic. He's a fully developed comic presence—quick-witted yet stupid, charmingly obnoxious, expansively sarcastic.
"Microwaves" are not the only menace. The good folks of Passaic, which is to say the simpletons who patronize Be Kind Rewind, are menaced by the encroaching gentrification—or at least urban renewal—poised to level the video store. All that history turned to dust. Before the bulldozers arrive, however, Jerry's paranoid attempt to sabotage the power plant backfires. Dressed in tinfoil and lurching like Frankenstein's monster, he returns as a human magnetic force field who both distorts the movie's image and provides its situation when he inadvertently erases all the VHS tapes in the store.
Jerry has the ability to create minimalist video art simply by touching a TV screen, but, to make up for the lost inventory, he and Mike begin producing new 15-minute videocorder versions of '80s and '90s movies—beginning with Ghostbusters . ("I'm Bill Murray —you're everybody else.") The hilariously impoverished special effects are predicated on scribbled pictures, giant cutouts, and pragmatic camera placement. Reducing movies to their most infantile level, they're like kids at play. Jerry's assistant Watson (rumple-faced Irv Gooch ) assumes the female parts until the filmmakers draft Alma (Melonie Diaz ), a bored employee at the dry cleaner next-door.
Subsequent productions include RoboCop , The Lion King , When We Were Kings , and Driving Miss Daisy  (with Jerry an aggressive Jessica Tandy  to Mike's sullen Morgan Freeman ), but not Back to the Future —the movie that Be Kind  most resembles in its tricky premise, double-edged sentimentality, and convoluted nostalgia. Hardly industry calling cards, these ridiculously low-tech little movies—which Jerry and Mike refer to as "sweded"—are exercises in junkyard whimsy. The customers are thrilled (this is Chelm, after all), and anyone with a feel for film form will be delighted. The sweded productions are pure underground, somewhere between the 8mm epics the teenaged Kuchar Brothers made a half-century ago in the Bronx  and the ritual developed by the Peruvian Indians  in Dennis Hopper 's Last Movie .
Given the inspired cheesiness, obsessive object animation, and wild creative geography that enlivened The Science of Sleep , it's obvious Gondry conceived Be Kind  mainly as a means to orchestrate these grotesque fan remakes. It's also unavoidable that their brio would overshadow everything else. For all of Black's physical comedy, and despite Gondry's attempt to texture Be Kind  with throwaway sight gags and a Preston Sturges –like density of comic secondaries—most disturbingly Mia Farrow , genuinely nutty as the store's most loyal customer, Miss Falewicz—the mini-movies inevitably drain energy from the straight narrative.
Is this comic bricolage a form of criticism? Gondry privileges audience devotion over corporate profit and argues that studio movies have grown ever more depleted since the '80s and '90s. (Having studied a successful DVD store, Mr. Fletcher realizes that there need be only two sections: Action Adventure and Comedy.) Villainy arrives in the form of an intellectual-property lawyer (Sigourney Weaver , herself a ghost of Ghostbusters ), who shows up to enforce the piracy statutes and levy a $3 billion fine. The loss of the sweded tapes forces the community to produce an original movie—Fats Waller Was Born "Here."  (Mike and Jerry both assume themselves physically appropriate to play the lead; everything grinds to a halt when Jerry shows up in blackface.) Structurally, Be Kind Rewind  is a sort of warped Möbius strip—only at the end does it become apparent that we've been watching bits of the Fats docudrama all along.
Although frequently funny, Be Kind  doesn't have the same pathos as The Science of Sleep . (Nothing approaches the loneliness projected by Gael García Bernal  and Charlotte Gainsbourg .) As suggested by the recurring ensemble scenes that dramatize the filmmakers—Jerry, Mike, and Alma—trying to think, Be Kind  is essentially cerebral. Their sweded films are serious examples of the grassroots "imperfect cinema" imagined by Cuban cultural theorist Julio García Espinosa  back in the days of '68. And Be Kind 's utopian project is made explicit in several ringing declarations. Alma wants to involve the townspeople in the production, making them "stockholders in their own happiness." Miss Falewicz is even more radical: "Our past belongs to us—we can change it if we want to."
