Think and say what you will about the beliefs and actions of Mel Gibson. One conclusion, however, is undeniable: He's a powerfully effective filmmaker. The films Gibson has directed demonstrate an increasingly deft understanding of epic scope, narrative mechanics, and visceral response. With his fourth feature film as a director, Mel Gibson continues his (probably unintentional) study of the mortification of the flesh through the ages. This is the theme that forms the consistent thread in his work and will prove more revealing than any scrutiny for sexism, Jew-baiting, and whatnot. Only now, after the graphic displays of extreme physical torture in Apocalypto
 and The Passion of the Christ
, can we really notice Gibson's fixation on the scarification of the flesh in his two earlier films, Braveheart
 and The Man Without a Face
. Whereas 2,000 years of Christian-era storytelling had prepared us for the ferocity of the injuries inflicted on Jesus Christ, we were not prepared for Gibson's near-pornographic obsession with the fleshy details of their depiction. Apocalypto
, which emphasizes the barbarity of late Mayan culture at the expense of its accomplishments in the sciences, written language, and city-building, is rife with assaults on the body � be they the tearing out of a living heart from a human sacrifice or the image of an animal impaled on the many sharp prongs of a hunter's trap. These details have the desired visceral effect on the viewer, and when combined with Gibson's command of the film's basic story of a husband and father's heroic journey to rescue his family, Apocalypto
 becomes an absorbing drama. Youngblood plays the husband and father, Jaguar Paw, a forest-dwelling and self-sustaining tribal Mayan who, along with his brethren, is taken captive by urban Mayans, who plan to use the captives as slaves and human sacrifices. The movie is taken up with the physical trek into slavery, the spectacle of the human sacrifices in the strange urban center, and an escape that inches forward in a constantly changing balance of power and wits. Gibson shrewdly uses Native American and Mayan Indians as actors and employs subtitles to translate the minimal dialogue, which is delivered in the dialect currently spoken by the Mayan descendents on the Yucatan. Yet for all Gibson's attention to accuracy, there are many aspects that just don't jibe. Why, for example, are the forest-dwellers taken completely by surprise by the unfamiliar rituals and barbarism of their urban-dwelling distant relations, yet all speak the same dialect? And how is it that a climactic solar eclipse so baffles and confuses the same citizenry whose historical accomplishments include their advanced understanding of astronomy? Despite all these mitigating reservations, Apocalypto
 is a dazzling achievement. Not only does it showcase a civilization little seen on the silver screen, the film (which opens with a quote from Will Durant) also advances larger questions about the natural and unnatural life cycles of civilizations. (That virtually all the Mayan natives eventually converted to Roman Catholicism I'm sure had nothing to do with Gibson's interest in telling this story � wink, wink.) Gibson is everywhere these days telling of how his made-up word "apocalypto" translates as "a new beginning." No one probably wishes for this more than he.


Mel Gibson may be a lunatic, but he's our lunatic, and while I wouldn't wish him behind the wheel of a car after happy hour or at a B'nai Brith function anytime, behind a camera is another matter.
"Apocalypto," his new film, is ridiculous and foolhardy; it has the grandiose ambition that comes from personally clearing $600 million on your last movie. It's a two-hours-plus celebrity-free period epic about men running through the rainforest in loincloths -- in Yucatec, with subtitles -- and at times I found myself howling from the sheer derangement of the thing.
But here's the catch: The movie transports you. It's overbaked, and it piles on the violence until you have to cringe or laugh in disbelief, but it immerses you fully in its harsh, luxuriant world. Say what you will about Gibson, but he's a genuine filmmaker, and "Apocalypto" gallops along the thin line between the deluded and the inspired with such conviction that you're yanked into its wake.
The director, who wrote the script with Farhad Safinia, sets his story in a rough Eden: the Yucatan peninsula in the early 1500s, before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. (It's also the period of the Maya's "post-classic" decline, which Gibson acknowledges with an opening quote from historian Will Durant : "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." How this relates to the movie we're about to see remains rather fuzzy.)
"Apocalypto" begins with a frenzied hunt through the forest -- highlighted by what stands as the first tapir-cam in the history of the cinema, thank you -- after which the animal organs are divvied up and we get to know the guys. There's Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and Curl Nose (Amilcar Ramirez ), Smoke Frog (Israel Contreras Vasquez ) and Cocoa Leaf (Israel Rios ), Donner and Blitzen. There's the wise old leader Flint Sky (the imposing Morris Bird) and his son Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the latter lean and resourceful. Since his piercings and tattoos are the least baroque of the bunch, he must be the hero.
The group gets back to their village in time to be overrun by a raiding party led by the fearsome Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo ). The assault is extremely bloody and distressing; Gibson does like his war games. Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and young son (Carlos Emilio Baez ) from the invaders before he is taken prisoner with the rest of his tribe and marched off to slave labor in the mines of the city.
It's during that arduous trek that you begin to appreciate what Gibson is after. The journey is really from pre-history to the pinnacle of Maya civilization, and it is an astonishing sequence, as fully visualized and as rich in pomp and circumstance as the finest old-school Hollywood epics. It just has more severed heads.
The sequence culminates at the top of a towering ziggurat, where "Apocalypto" drops hints about the power-mongering manipulations of the priestly ruling class. Mostly, though, we're here for the gore. In all his movies -- the ones he has starred in and certainly the ones he has directed -- Gibson sees violence as a lamentable truth of human existence, but he also digs it. A lot. So why have one pulsing human heart torn out of a chest when you can have three?
Still, the wallowing seems more germane to "Apocalypto" than in a story about, say, a man who embodied the Christian God's love for humanity. In its first half, the movie aspires to brutal Homeric poetry, with James Horner's score pounding the drums and Dean Semler's cinematography swooping and soaring; this is a foundation myth with a touch of decline-and-fall, and all that keeps it from taking full flight are the flat English translations, more "Entourage" than "Odyssey."
The second half of the film is a prolonged chase sequence, and the going gets silly at times. As Jaguar Paw staggers homeward, pursuers hot on his trail, "Apocalypto" unwittingly becomes a game of Ten Little Meso-Americans, and our suspension of disbelief threatens to snap. On the other hand, maybe it is 
possible to outrun a jaguar when you've lost several pints of blood.
The violence in these scenes is creative to the point of absurdity: Gibson shows us what that jaguar looks like biting into a human face because -- well, because he can. The filmmaking turns primitive, too, and the movie boils down to hero, villain, and a damsel figuratively tied to the tracks. (Not too figuratively: Jaguar Paw's wife is stuck in a pit and the rains have begun. And her water just broke. She's having a good hair day, though.)
This is exciting without being terribly involving; by now you're outside "Apocalypto" peering in and occasionally having a giggle. Gibson throws one last sociopolitical curveball at the end, but the oh-wow effect it delivers has little bearing on the story.
If you have the stomach for it, though -- or if you like keeping in touch with the works of one of our wealthier outsider artists and/or don't mind funding an anti-Semite -- "Apocalypto" should be seen. Gibson is unique in modern pop culture: He's a troubled, self-made visionary with reprehensible personal ideas and real creative gifts, and he's financially free to do what he pleases. This is a dangerous and illuminating position, and where it will lead I haven't the foggiest.
It's fascinating to watch, though. Gibson may even turn out to be our generation 's flawed, outsized Charles Foster Kane; if so, "Apocalypto" could be his Xanadu, cluttered with intermittent marvels. God help us if he ever finds his Rosebud.


         Who knows what violence lurks in the hearts of men? Mel Gibson knows, and he just can't resist putting every last ounce of it on screen. He also can't resist pulling those bloody, still-beating hearts out of human bodies and putting them up on screen as well. And that's just the beginning.
 
  Numerous good things can be said about "Apocalypto," the director's foray into the decaying Mayan civilization of the early 1500s, but every last one of them is overshadowed by Gibson's well-established penchant for depictions of stupendous amounts of violence.
 


         






    Despite a genuine talent for taking us to another time and place, a gift that under other circumstances would be worth experiencing, Gibson has made a movie that can be confidently recommended only to viewers who have a concentration camp commandant's tolerance for repugnant savagery.
 
  Mountains of hacked up corpses, exit wounds spewing fountains of blood, spears shattering teeth, warriors literally beating each other's brains out, it's all here in living and dying color.
 
  This is the kind of movie in which a person known as a finisher does not work on your floors, a jaguar graphically munches on a man's face, and when someone says, "I will peel his skin and have him watch me wear it," we can only pray that it doesn't come to pass.
 
  Perhaps even Gibson himself doesn't know what deep need is satisfied by putting this kind of brutality on screen. But no one who's seen the disemboweling scene in "Braveheart" or the torture and crucifixion in "The Passion of the Christ" (not to mention the Gibson parody on "South Park") can doubt that need is there.
 
 
Given that penchant, it was only a matter of time until the director would find his way to a civilization that enthusiastically practiced human sacrifice. If ever there was a filmmaker congenitally unable to resist shots of severed heads bouncing, bouncing, bouncing down the side of a steep pyramid, this is the man.
 
  In a Gibson-directed movie, it's usually not very long until someone sticks the knife in and does his worst, and "Apocalypto" is no different. It opens with a ferocious tapir hunt in a verdant jungle that ends with the animal impaled and eviscerated with its throat cut for good measure. Welcome to Mel's World of Fang and Claw. 

 
  The men in the hunting party, including tribal elder Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) and his son Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), soon to be the film's protagonist, are weighed down with so many body and facial piercings, including what look to be nuts and bolts under the lower lip, that it would not be surprising to see True Value Hardware with a product placement credit.
 
  These men are part of a small village living in peaceful serenity in all that jungle. (The Mexican rain forest of Catemaco location has been beautifully shot in high definition digital video by Dean Semler, an Oscar winner for "Dances With Wolves.") The first hint that the future will be less bucolic is an encounter with the fleeing people of another village. The look on their faces is enough to cause Flint Sky to give a pep talk to his son, telling him that fear is a disease that must be kept at bay at all costs.
 
  That talk turns out to be especially timely, as early the next morning the ultrafierce Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) leads a group of sneering, sadistic warriors from a more advanced civilization in a savage attack on the village. Women are raped, men die in grotesque ways, but, for reasons we can easily guess, the attackers are as interested in taking prisoners as in meeting Gibson's bloodshed quota.
 
  After hiding his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their small son in a deep hole, Jaguar Paw gets captured and taken on the long journey to Zero Wolf's city. Along the way he sees crop failure, drought and plague, all symptoms of a civilization in serious crisis.
 
  It wouldn't be fair to detail all the trials the script by Gibson and Farhad Safinia puts Jaguar Paw through, though his exploits do make the sprinting in "Run Lola Run" look like a Sunday stroll. Attention must be paid, however, to the pains that have been taken to make the look and feel of this vividly imagined world both authentic and involving.
 
  For one thing, Gibson has insisted that all his actors, most of whom are new to the screen, speak their dialogue in the primary Mayan language of Yucatec. The director also employed a movement teacher to ensure that everybody's body language would be convincingly primitive.
 
  Equally impressive is the high quality work that has gone into the physically imposing Mayan buildings and pyramids . Ditto for the convincingly otherworldly head-to-toe look of the urban Mayans themselves, who look like habitues of the "Star Wars" cantina crossed with extras in a Carmen Miranda musical.
 
  Gibson unblushingly intends "Apocalypto" as a clarion call warning modern man to watch his step or risk following the Mayas into decline and near-extinction. To this end he opens the story with a famous quote from historian Will Durant about the fall of Rome: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."
 
  This is all well and good, but the reality of "Apocalypto" is that this film is in fact Exhibit A of the rot from within that Gibson is worried about. If our society is in moral peril, the amount of stomach-turning violence that we think is just fine to put on screen is by any sane measure a major aspect of that decline. Mel, no one in your entourage is going to tell you this, but you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. A big part.
 
 
 MPAA rating:

Promoting Mel Gibson's Apocalypto  as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto  is more than a matter of truth in advertising. The possessory drumroll is a declaration, a challenge, a promise: This is a movie by Mel Gibson, pals, in which everything one has ever loved, hated, been stirred by, or hooted at in the man's repertoire to date (both on and off screen) looks even bigger and crazier. So let the buyer beware  or be titillated. Gibson's preoccupation with torture, rage, psychosis, faith, male bonding, (fear of) homosexuality, sin, redemption, sadomasochism, and, for that matter, the fate of the rain forest  it's all here, in a movie for which Hieronymus Bosch might have drawn the storyboards.
Without Mel Gibson, Apocalypto  would just be a violent, exotic historical epic/action flick with a nebulous political message about the decline of a corrupt civilization, and the need to seek, as the script says, ''a new beginning.'' It would be a hullabaloo gone native, a National Geographic  grindhouse pic with subtitles, about the impulse of men to destroy one another, and the insatiable moviegoing appetite for visual novelty. But it would not feature a fellow chomping down on the testicles of a slaughtered animal, a father slit open in front of his son, a pregnant woman nearly drowning, or an extended scene of human sacrifice in which heads roll down steep temple steps like bowling balls. And the nogginless bodies that remain would not be photographed in piles inspired by old Holocaust imagery.
No, my friends, the Mel Gibson part of the marquee is crucial to the full...appreciation of this astonishing, id-soaked work. And if ''astonishing, id-soaked'' ends up in the ads, then marketers have simplified my meaning.
Rather than immediately attaching a value to the intensity of the spectacle, I'd prefer to talk about the spectacle itself, which begins with the hunting of a wild boar for one pre-Columbian Mayan village. An impressive chieftain called Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead, an unknown actor like everyone else in the gigantic loinclothed and befeathered cast) leads a pride of local men on the expedition, with his soulful son Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) close at hand. The kill is celebrated with the parceling out of body parts, during which the aforementioned genitals are handed, allegedly for medicinal consumption, to Blunted (Jonathan Brewer), a hulking chap whose wife has yet to conceive a child. Laughter ensues when the ball-eating prescription turns out to be a classic Gibsonian prank involving threatened manhood and homoerotic roughhousing. Punk'd!
Then the real slaughter begins, and with it, the movie's frenzied race to a finish in geography that serves as a Bizarro World to the glories of Terrence Malick's The New World . The peaceful village is attacked by marauding Others (assuming Lost 's ancestral Others decorated their faces like Christmas oranges studded with cloves), who slaughter and torture with vivid inventiveness. Those who aren't dead are captured, among them soulful Jaguar Paw, who stares with Jesus eyes. But before he's carted away, the resourceful young man manages to hide his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and little son.
The future is a grim one for the living: They're replacement stock for the prevailing political rulers  deciders who have decided that the gods demand human sacrifice, and follow through in an orgy of sadism. The lingering depiction of this carnage marks one of Apocalypto 's two climaxes, and it's a hideous sight, something perilously close to porn. The movie's final act  Jaguar Paw's escape from death, his race back to try to save his family, and his pursuit by crazed Mayans determined to stay the course (led by a terrifying Raoul Trujillo as head crazy)  is as elemental in its goals as anything out of the Mad Max yarns or Braveheart . The message may be that we're all members of a rotting civilization. Or it may be that pregnant women can do miraculous things.
Never let it be said that Gibson the director (he also co-wrote the script with former assistant Farhad Safinia) doesn't know how to pace and build action like a pro. Freed from the roadblocks inevitable in telling the story of, say, Jesus' crucifixion, the movie barrels and lunges on jaguar paws itself. But never forget, either, that there's so much dark material jammed into this complicated, conflicted, challenging, and charismatic man's own noggin that sometimes he knows not, I think, what he's done. Here, behold, Mel Gibson has made the weirdest, most violent movie of the year.

 “I’m going to peel off his skin and make him watch me wear it.” This grisly threat is delivered by one of the main bad guys in Mel Gibson’s  “Apocalypto.” The promised flaying never takes place, but viewers who share this director’s apparently limitless appetite for gore will not be disappointed, since not much else in the way of bodily torment has been left to the imagination. There are plenty of disembowelings, impalings, clubbings and beheadings. Hearts are torn, still beating, from slashed-open chests. A man’s face is chewed off by a jaguar. Another’s neck is pierced by darts tipped with frog venom. Most disturbing, perhaps, is the sight of hundreds of corpses haphazardly layered in an open pit: a provocative and ill-advised excursion into Holocaust imagery on this director’s part.  Violence has become the central axiom in Mr. Gibson’s practice as a filmmaker,  his major theme and also his chief aesthetic interest. The brutality in “Apocalypto” is so relentless and extreme that it sometimes moves beyond horror into a kind of grotesque comedy, but to dismiss it as excessive or gratuitous would be to underestimate Mr. Gibson’s seriousness. And say what you will about him — about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews — he is a serious filmmaker.  Which is not to say that “Apocalypto” is a great film, or even that it can be taken quite as seriously as it wants to be. Mr. Gibson’s technical command has never been surer; for most of its 2-hour 18-minute running time, “Apocalypto,” written by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia, is a model of narrative economy, moving nimbly forward and telling its tale with clarity and force. It is, above all, a muscular and kinetic action movie, a drama of rescue and revenge with very little organic relation to its historical setting. Yes, the dialogue is in various Mayan dialects, which will sound at least as strange to American ears as the Latin and Aramaic of “The Passion of the Christ,” but the film’s real language is Hollywood’s, and Mr. Gibson’s, native tongue.  When I first heard about this project, and later when I saw the early trailers, I halfway hoped that Mr. Gibson might turn out to be an American (or half-Australian) version of Werner Herzog, setting out into the jungle to explore the dark and tangled regions of human nature. Once you get past the costumes and the subtitles, though, the most striking thing about “Apocalypto” is how comfortably it sits within the conventions of mainstream moviemaking. It is not an obsessive opera like Mr. Herzog’s “Aguirre: The Wrath of God,” but rather a pop period epic in the manner of “Gladiator” or “Braveheart,” and as such less interested in historical or cultural authenticity than in imposing an accessible scheme on a faraway time and place.    The setting is Central America before the arrival of the Spanish, when the Maya empire, in Mr. Gibson’s version, was already in the process of collapsing from within. The basic moral conflict — as it was in “Braveheart,” directed by and starring Mr. Gibson, and in “The Patriot,” a vehicle for him directed by Roland Emmerich — is between a small group of people trying to live simple, decent, traditional lives and a larger, more powerful political entity driven by bloodlust and greed. This kind of conservative anti-imperialism runs consistently through Mr. Gibson’s work;  whether the empire in question is Roman, British or Mesoamerican, and whatever its political resonance might be, it allows the viewer to root for an unambiguously virtuous underdog.  “Apocalypto” begins with a group of young men out on a hunt and lingers for a while in their happy, earthy village, a place that might double as a nostalgic vision of small-town America were it not for the loin cloths, the tattooed buttocks and the facial piercings. Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) is nagged by his mother-in-law and teased by his buddies because he hasn’t yet made his wife pregnant, but he accepts his humiliation in good humor, like the jolly fat kid on a family sitcom.  Meanwhile Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose father (Morris Birdyellowhead) is an admired hunter and warrior, snuggles down with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their young son, Turtle Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). There’s fresh tapir meat on the grill and an old-timer telling stories by the fire. Life is good.  Needless to say, this pastoral idyll cannot last. The ominous strains of James Horner’s score indicate as much. Before long the village is set upon by fearsome marauders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), who rape, burn and kill with ruthless discipline and undisguised glee. The locals resist valiantly, but the survivors are led away to an uncertain fate. Seven and Turtle Run stay behind, hidden in a hole in the ground.  Jaguar Paw’s mission will be to rescue them and also to avenge his friends and kin. First, though, he will accompany us on a Cecil B. DeMille tour of the decadent imperial capital, a place of misery, luxury and corruption, where priests and nobles try to keep famine and pestilence at bay with round-the-clock human sacrifices.  Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of “Apocalypto” is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill.  Perhaps because he is aiming for an audience wary of subtitles, Mr. Gibson rarely uses dialogue as a means of exposition, and he proves himself to be an able, if not always terribly original, visual storyteller. He is not afraid of clichés — the slow-motion, head-on sprint toward the camera; the leap from the waterfall into the river below — but he executes them with a showman’s maniacal relish.  And it is, all in all, a pretty good show. There is a tendency, at least among journalists, to take Mr. Gibson as either a monster or a genius, a false choice that he frequently seems intent on encouraging. Is he a madman or a visionary? Should he be shunned or embraced? Censured or forgiven?  These are the wrong questions, but their persistence reveals the truth about this shrewd and bloody-minded filmmaker. He is an entertainer. He will be publicized, and he will be paid.  “Apocalypto” is rated R (Under 17 must be accompanied by parent or adult guardian). See the first paragraph above.

Mel Gibson is always good for a surprise, and his latest is that "Apocalypto" is a remarkable film. Set in the waning days of the Mayan civilization, the picture provides a trip to a place one's never been before, offering hitherto unseen sights of exceptional vividness and power. In the wake of its director's recent outburst and unwanted publicity, commercial prospects remain anyone's guess, and those looking for a reason not to attend will undoubtedly find one, be it Gibson's tirade, the gore, the subtitles or outre subject matter. But blood-and-guts action audiences should eat this up, Gibson is courting Latinos, eco-political types will like the message and at least part of the massive "The Passion of the Christ" crowd should be curious, so strong biz is possible if these distinct constituencies are roused.
Despite the subject's inherent spectacle, conflict and societal interest, Central America's pre-Columbian history has scarcely been touched by filmmakers; Hollywood's only venture into the territory was the little-remembered 1963 quasi-epic "Kings of the Sun," with Yul Brynner and George Chakiris.
Cast largely with indigenous nonpros speaking the prevailing surviving dialect of the Mesoamericans, "Apocalypto" is exotic, wild, ferocious, teeming with startling incident and brutal violence.
With co-screenwriter Farhad Safinia, Gibson has cooked up a scenario that is fundamentally a survival and chase film, with a final act that trades on the human hunt motif of "The Most Dangerous Game" and Cornel Wilde's "The Naked Prey."
But both the grand conception of a civilization in decline and the extraordinary detail with which the society is presented make the picture much more than that, to the extent that it startlingly echoes another portent-laden year-end release, Alfonso Cuaron's "Children of Men;" one film is set in the past, the other in the near-future, one was made in Mexico by a Yank-Aussie, the other in Britain by a Mexican, but both are contemporaneously resonant stories of pursuit through poisoned, dangerous lands on the brink.
Starting at a run and seldom stopping for a breather, pic opens on an animal hunt that occasions a graphically gross two-prong practical joke that instantly humanizes the characters. It establishes the relaxed, intimate, sensual nature of family-oriented life in a small jungle settlement occupied by the fearsome-looking but free-spirited protags. Chief among them is Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), an athletic young man who has long flowing locks, sports tattoos, designed body scars, large ear adornments and a sort of chin plug, and wears nothing but a well-fitted loin cloth. His teeth are not quite as bad as those of his pals, which are very bad indeed.
Paradise comes to an abrupt end a half-hour in with the dawn attack of marauders who pillage with ruthless expertise. These guys are more heavily decorated than the locals, with bones through their noses and elsewhere. Two members of what the press notes identify as Holcane warriors stand out: the leader, Zero Wolf (the supremely imposing Raoul Trujillo), whose left arm and head are festooned with human and animal jaws, and the sadistic Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios, fantastically hateful), who, restrained from killing Jaguar Paw by Zero Wolf, instead murders the captive's father in front of him, launching an antagonism that runs through the picture. Both of these heavies could stay in costume and stride straight into another "Mad Max" film.
With his surviving fellow villagers, Jaguar Paw is bound and marched off through the jungle, but not before he's secreted his very pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and little son (Carlos Emilio Baez) in a deep pit, promising, rather against the odds, to return.
The greatest mystery surrounding the Mayan civilization is why it collapsed so suddenly. Gibson adroitly lines his film with hints of the numerous possible causes, including famine, disease, drought, increased warfare, a corrupt ruling class and general societal breakdown. A bedraggled group of emaciated natives is glimpsed moving through the forest early on, and the prisoners later pass by a haunted girl with "the sickness" who warns about the coming "blackness of day."
The long central section of "Apocalypto" is simply great epic cinema, with generous dollops of chilling horror and grisly human sacrifice. Production designer Tom Sanders makes a huge contribution to the captives' gradual entry into the great and chaotic Maya City. Each neighborhood is brilliantly detailed, from the derelict outlying shantytown to the industrial and more prosperous commercial districts, the slave market where the women are sold off and, finally, the staggering central plaza, where the first thing seen is a freshly detached human head being bounced down the long steps of a towering pyramid toward a frenzied crowd below.
Only then does it dawn on the shackled prisoners what's in store for them. At the summit preside dissolute royals as well as a high priest who, time and again, plunges a knife into a man's belly and, while the victim is still alive, tears out his still-beating heart as an offering to placate the gods to end the drought.
It takes a freakish act of nature to save Jaguar Paw, but he and the few other survivors are quickly made objects of sport in an arena, from which commences the long and eventful chase of Jaguar Paw by Zero Wolf and his minions back through the jungle. Double-whammy ending tips over into undue melodrama that some may find risible, and one aspect of the climax establishes the film's time frame as much later in Mayan history than one might have guessed.
Notwithstanding the fantastic sets, costumes, makeup, body and hair designs and natural locations, perhaps the greatest impression is made by the performers' faces, which are superbly photogenic and unlike any normally seen in movies. The attractive, agile Youngblood carries the film with room to spare, and is entirely convincing in his many dramatic moments as well as in the intense action. Casting director Carla Hool rates a huge bonus for tracking down the people who play everyone from the most savage looking warriors to the paralyzingly weird female aristocrats in the city.
One notable aspect of the characterizations is the general attitude toward death. The Mayans as portrayed here naturally fear it like anyone, but they accept it, just as they acknowledge physical pain as an everyday aspect of life. They are utterly without sentimentality, tears or remorse; when one is about to die, another will sincerely tell them, "Travel well," and that is that. Blood and violence is abundant, but doesn't feel exaggerated or out of line in relation to the material.
Production is a wonder. Dean Semler's camera moves relentlessly through the densest of foliage and over the roughest of terrain on locations near Veracruz and in the rainforests of Catemaco, with some additional shooting done in Costa Rica and the U.K.; Gibson clearly knew the impact the lenser of the second and third "Mad Max" films could deliver. More remarkable still is that pic was shot on the new high definition Genesis camera system. Without a doubt, "Apocalypto" is the best-looking big-budget film yet shot digitally; one can't tell it wasn't shot on film.
James Horner composed an uncharacteristically low-key and moody score, full of threatening, choral-like synthesizer growling, woodwind interludes and alarming percussive strikes.

Apocalypto  has a faux Greek title and an opening quote from historian Will Durant  that ruminates on the decline of imperial Rome . It may seem an odd way to comment on the supposed end of an imaginary, unspeakably barbaric Mayan civilizationbut WWJD? Mel Gibson  means to be universal.
Not just a walk in the park with Mel and the guys (in this case a large cast of mainly Mexican Indians speaking present- day Yucatec), this lavishly punishing picture is the third panel in Gibson's "Ordeal" triptych. The Martyrdom of the Braveheart  and The Passion of the Christ  have nothing on The Misadventures of the Jaguar Paw  , junior citizen of a generally jovial, practical-joke-loving 16th-century Central American social unit. Given the absence of any identification, and with regard to their good looks and family values (that is, keeping pet monkeys and having babies), these noble savages might be called the Sugar Tit tribe.
Over the course of Apocalypto 's 140 subtitled minutes, Jaguar Paw (American actor Rudy Youngblood ) endures two calvaries. After the Sugar Tit village is overrun, sacked, and more or less crucified by a marauding group of "civilized" Mayans, JP is dragged through the jungle, carrying his cross (as well as his brothers) to the Temple of Doom. After he's saved from ritual sacrifice by a timely miraclehis Mayan captors are so degenerate they've forgotten the astronomy they inventedthere's an hour of running barefoot, bleeding, back home to the cenote where he stashed his pregnant wife and child. JP dodges spears, vaults waterfalls, and slogs through quicksand. It's a nonstop sprintcomplete with irate mama jaguar nipping at his keister.
Following the gory trail marked by Braveheart  and The Passion of the Christ , Apocalypto is a blatantly sadistic spectacle albeit not without a certain chivalry. Women are raped and children butchered but Mel shows no taste for such savagery. (You might even call him protective: In one feeble bid for a PG-13, the surviving children of Sugar Tit village are left to fend for themselves in the charge of a teenage babysitter.) Mel is a glutton for male punishment. There's not a man in this movie who isn't scourged, bashed, or puncturedunless he's disemboweled.
Unlike its predecessors, however, Apocalypto  is unburdened by nationalist or religious pietyit's pure, amoral sensationalism. By those standards, the most engaging sequence is played in the evil heart of the Mayan sacred city. Give the devil his due: Hieronymus Bosch  or Matthias Grünewald  would have appreciated Mel's vision of paganism run wild. The place is a monstrous construction site cum marketplace where life is cheap (and so are the extras), and the blood pours over the stone monuments like molasses on Grandma's griddle cakes. It's political too: Gesturing muck-a-mucks in feathered masks rise from their human footstools atop garish temples to address the juju-dancing mob below.
No mean panderer he, Gibson has compared the "fear-mongering" Mayan leadership to "President Bush  and his guys" and their ritual human sacrifice to the deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq . He may also be recycling material from his canceled miniseries. The spectacle of a village torched and its peaceful inhabitants rounded up and marched to a remote industrial complex run by slave labor under the heel of gratuitously cruel, fetish-bedecked warriors, there to be systematically mass murdered on the altar of some irrational ideology does  suggest Poland  circa 1944. There's no denying this holocaustcomplete with vast corpse-disposal pitor is there?
Maybe the Mayans really did bounce human heads down the steps of their pyramids but, being as their civilization collapsed hundreds of years before the Spanish conquest, how would we know? "A lot of it, story-wise, I just made up," Gibson confessed to the Mexican junketeers who visited his set last year. "And then, oddly, when I checked it out with historians and archaeologists and so forth, it's not that far [off]." Or far out, for that matter. Irrational as it may be, Mel's sense of history does have a logic: JP's trip to hell ends when the Christians arrive.
