         In Jonathan Jakubowicz's jolting "Secuestro Express," sweeping panoramas of Caracas reveal hillsides paved with brown shacks like tiles, give way to views of skylines thick with skyscrapers and then offer darting glimpses of busy streets, finally settling into a sleekly spare nightclub where an exceptionally modish young couple are doing a line of coke. Martin (Jean Paul Leroux) is a rich playboy, while Carla (Mía Maestro) is the beautiful daughter of a hospital physician (Rubén Blades).
 
  That the couple have been engaged five years figures, because their relationship seems sustained by physical attraction and class and perhaps drugs. Martin is clearly spoiled and self-indulgent, while Carla, despite her lifestyle, has a social conscience and works with underprivileged children.
 


         






    In the next few minutes, Carla's enlightened point of view is going to count for next to nothing. The couple has been targeted by a trio of thugs — the savvy Trece (Carlos Julio Molina), the brutal, unstable Budu (Pedro Peréz) and the trigger-happy Niga (Carlos Madera). They are part of the "secuestro express" phenomenon that has swept Latin America in recent years, in which a small band of crooks snatches people who seem clearly upper class and holds them for a reasonable enough amount of ransom to ensure their families will pay off swiftly without involving the authorities. The idea is that a quick turnover will minimize risk for the perpetrators.
 
  That Carla is so gorgeous, Martin so petulant and foolish and their captors doing drugs themselves makes for a highly volatile and intermittently savage situation. Jakubowicz is a whiz at setting up an exceedingly tense predicament and then building upon it a nearly unbearable suspense with ingenuity and insight. "Secuestro Express" goes full-throttle; it has so much energy that its strobe cuts, split screens, constantly fluid camerawork are expressive and exciting rather than distracting. Jakubowicz, a native of Caracas whose only previous feature was "Ship of Hope," a documentary on Jews who fled the Nazi menace to Venezuela, is a talent.
 
  The director knows how to rev up his actors and play coincidence and irony for all they're worth. The unfolding of Carla and Martin's nightmarish ordeal is punctuated with bursts of savagery, clumsiness, humor and even asides involving their captors' relatives, forcing the viewer to acknowledge the captors' humanity, such as it is. Through this kidnapping, Jakubowicz lays bare a society in which the chasm between the haves and have-nots has opened so wide that the desperately impoverished think increasingly that they have nothing to lose in picking off the privileged. Jakubowicz has aptly said of his film that "the beauty of 'Secuestro Express' is how localized it is. The more local it becomes, the more universal it becomes." The truth of his remark resonates throughout this fast and furious film.

 Wasting no time, "Secuestro Express" kicks off with an opening montage depicting a brutal way of life in a troubled Caracas, Venezuela, and never lets up its relentless assault on the senses. Literally translated as "Kidnapping Express," the title refers to a thriving but deadly abduction business to which many poverty-stricken Latin Americans have turned as a means to secure quick cash.  A trio of hoodlums set their sights on an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux), who are just about to head home after a wild night of partying. Once they've been snatched and the ransom demands have been phoned in to Carla's father (Rubén Blades), the victims face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the money's arrival - knowing there's no solid guarantee for their lives even after they've been paid for.  The film, written and directed by Jonathan Jakubowicz and shot on digital video, uses a variety of surprisingly effective gimmicks. The jarring speeded-up and slow-motion scenes effectively evoke a sense of dread, raw urgency and adrenaline-filled drug rushes (reflecting the perpetual narcotic intake of both captors and captives). Split-screen segments, commonly used to bring proximity to characters separated by great distances, here cleverly reveal the simultaneous actions of people located in the claustrophobic setting of one car.  Brief moments of peace occasionally materialize from within the chaos, and it's then that the complexity of the characters - perfectly cast across the board - can be glimpsed. As stereotypes are stripped away, the villains become more human, even sympathetic. And while Martin's truly unflattering colors reveal themselves, Carla begins to feel more at ease with her kidnappers, perhaps because their cruelty isn't as personal or painful.  Whenever a feeling of calm or security starts to set in, the film spins out of control again - each time escalating to an even more extreme level. The constant threat of violence and rape is difficult to endure, but the unpredictable "Secuestro Express" is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief. It manages to raise awareness of frightening  real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in a world where the cops are more treacherous than the crooks, and no one can be trusted. Even the most hard-core criminals have to watch their backs, because there is always someone more dangerous lurking around every corner.  "Secuestro Express" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has harsh language, violence, sex and drug use.

Assuming the victims' point of view in the type of kidnapping that's now epidemic in Latin America, Jonathan Jakubowicz's "Kidnap Express" depicts a nocturnal Caracas with tense energy while gingerly trying not to offend any political group in the current class wars embroiling Venezuela. Pic can be seen as a raw, grassroots South American response to Tony Scott's extremely problematic Mexico City kidnap thriller, "Man on Fire," but is also an entertainment that should bust out of the local market to rack up good dinero in other Latin American territories. 
In a night pregnant with a strange mix of tension and dizzy abandon, lovers Carla (Argentine thesp Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux) prowl clubs before drunkenly wandering back to his swank car. While he comes across as crass nouveau riche, she appears more liberal.
Their conspicuous affluence, however, makes them ideal targets for kidnappers, and the trio of Trece (Carlos Julio Molina), Budu (Pedro Perez) and Niga (Carlos Madera) gets a bead on them and promptly sweeps them up at gunpoint.
The kidnappers demand $20,000 to be delivered in two hours, and the resulting action plays out in a roughly compressed version of real time, cleverly clocked by occasional cutaways to a Caracas DJ announcing the time. Carla phones her rich father Sergio (Ruben Blades), but chaos soon ensues. A botched ATM robbery is followed by an amusing stopover at the palatial estate of a gay drug dealer.
Writer-director Jakubowicz allows the anger of the kidnap victims to be vented while also airing the views of the kidnappers who come from the city's dreadful slums. Just as Carla's and Martin's political views clash, so do the kidnappers' personalities, with good guys and bad emerging within the gang.
"Kidnap Express" thus dallies in politics while remaining resolutely apolitical, with its only straightforward message being that when it comes to Colombian cops, none can be trusted. Both sides of the Venezuelan political divide -- the haves and the have-nots -- will be able to glean from pic what they will and feel convinced that the thriller speaks to their cause.
In a considerable shift from her recent subdued work in Lucretia Martel's "The Holy Girl," Maestro works up a firebrand's emotions and wrath in the face of her capture. She infuses each scene with considerable human terror and vulnerability, and unexpectedly, doses of irreverent wit. As the gang's most brutish member, Perez (a vet Venezuelan hip-hop artist) makes a literally huge and ferocious impression. Blades, by contrast, has little to do.
Though vid lensing allows maximum, jittery mobility, transfer to film is poor. Music tracks, per several hip-hoppers in the cast, is rap heavy.

A focus on a timely social problem paired with an archetypal class-war tale would be a winning combination for Secuestro Express , were it not for the movie's strangely exploitative nature. The film centers on the late-night kidnapping of an upper-class Caracas  couple (Mia Maestro  and Jean Paul Leroux ) by three sadistic blackmailers. Surely the Venezuelan director did his homework, but the scenario capitalizes on stereotypes of a sensationally dangerous Latin America as if to tell us, "It's really as bad as you think down there." Secuestro Express  uses fast cuts and sped-up urban joyrides to portray criminal, coke-induced mania, which although irritatingly recognizable ( GoodFellas , City of God  ) still rouses a desperate energy. As social commentary, Secuestro Express  doesn't go much further than regurgitating character types (poor little rich girl, thief with heart of gold) and reminding us of Caracas's class differences. The movie's raw depiction of Caracas is its strongest point, providing some fly-on-the-wall footage of a pulsating city.
