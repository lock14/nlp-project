The lesson learned from The Tale of Despereaux
 is that an overabundance of vocal talent does not a good cartoon make. Adapted for the screen by Pleasantville
 and Seabiscuit
 director Gary Ross from the 2004 Newberry Medal-winning novel by Kate DiCamillo, The Tale of Despereaux
 adds up to much less than the sum of its parts. The animation looks decent enough, but the narrative is a choppy story that bobs among human characters in the human kingdom of Dor, where soup seems to be its inhabitants' main preoccupation, and the rodent residents of the separate municipalities of Mouseworld and Ratworld. Despereaux Tilling (voiced by Broderick) is a young mouse who is the shame of his parents and all the rest of Mouseworld. He prefers to read books rather than eat them and is more prone to acts of bravery than the natural mouse state of cowering. He is banished to the lower depths of Ratworld, where he makes the acquaintance of Roscuro, a Ratso Rizzo-type mentor (voiced, of course, by Hoffman) who caused the death of Dor's queen when he fell from a chandelier into her soup. Consequently, the king banishes soup and mice from his realm, and the residents grow sad (presumably from the lack of soup, not mice). Despereaux eventually makes friends with Princess Pea (voiced by Watson), and Roscuro attempts an apology. A servant girl (voiced by Ullman) is among the many other characters that bustle about Dor. The movie becomes so intent on introducing characters and revealing the dark chambers of the Ratworld dungeon (enough so that the "G" rating should be called into question) that it loses many of the book's messages about individuality and valor. Most crippling is the narration by Weaver, which ladles out platitudes by the heaping spoonful. Maybe it's just too difficult to make an original rodent movie in the wake of last year's superlative Ratatouille
 and the year before's Flushed Away
 (which Fell also co-directed) � especially when The Tale of Despereaux
, like Ratatouille
, emphasizes the relationship between rats and the culinary arts. "Is it soup yet?" we might ask of The Tale of Despereaux
. The answer comes like an Amy Winehouse chorus, "No, no, no."


In 'Despereaux,' rat and mouse fairy tale is a prize
It's understandable that the movie with a talking rat running around a Frenchman's kitchen might produce a "Ratatouille" hot flash. And certain close-ups of some of the more stoutly drawn humans might make you wonder when "Shrek" became the going model for out-of-shape cartoon characters. But "The Tale of Despereaux" overcomes enough of what it seems like to be completely enjoyable for what it is: a skillfully managed fairy tale about a mouse, a rat, and fairy tales in general.
This tale begins, more or less, in tragedy. The festive kingdom of Dor turns dour after the queen keels over dead at the sight of a rat in her lunch. The king cancels Soup Day, a holiday bigger than Christmas. He banishes rats. The sun refuses to shine. Think Victor Hugo's France without the rampant starvation. In Dor's recesses and its dungeons, the movie's ambitions come to life: a tale of two rodents who refuse to behave according to the rules of their species, and a poor, chubby country girl (Tracey Ullman) who refuses to behave according to the rules of hers.
Roscuro the rat, with Dustin Hoffman's voice, won't act like a savage. Despereaux, the teeny mouse with big eyes and giant ears who speaks with Matthew Broderick's boyish voice, confounds his genteel family and exasperates all of Mouseworld with his thirsts for literacy, extroversion, and adventure. They both genuinely like humans and find themselves mixed up in separate but interwoven plots to restore Dor and its royal family to their former soup-loving selves. The girl, who winds up inside the kingdom, wants to be princess.
This film has a lot to do, and the directors, Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen, and the screenwriter, Gary Ross, manage to get it all done. They even have time to spare for an excursion to a pig farm and two exuberantly rendered passages with a pot of veggies that magically becomes a farmer's market scaramouche named Boldo (Stanley Tucci). Boldo has a melon head, cherry eyes, garlic bulb joints, and a peapod mouth. Children may not understand a word of what he says, but I'm sure he'll inspire a raft of little eaters to play with their food.
So much of the design for "Despereaux" is so good - not at the Pixar
 level of visual transcendence (that, apparently, is hard to do) but a notch beyond the "Space Chimps" and "Madagascars" of the megaplex. The flotillas of technicians here are truly inspired. There is a cloud of flour, bowls of reflectively oily mealworms, and stains on a French chef's teeth that bespeak many glasses of Bordeaux and even more packs of Gauloises.
The movie's handsomeness makes it easier to ignore the occasionally enervating absence of sunlight and the possibility of some troublesome identity politics. Ratworld is a putrid ghetto that pulses with the rhythms of Afro-Arabian percussion, and its leader is a long-snouted creature - Botticelli, voiced by Ciaran Hinds - who could certainly have played Nosferatu for F.W. Murnau. Mouseworld, by contrast, is Walton's Mountain. Since neither the rat nor the mouse likes his respective home, no harm is done.
The blueprint for all this is Kate DiCamillo's Newbery Medal-winning book, whose subtitle - "Being the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup, and a Spool of Thread" - deserved some kind of prize in its own right. When the book's title showed up on screen during the closing credits, the audience cheered. I held my applause for Sigourney Weaver's name. Weaver narrates the film, and with all due respect to anyone who ever read me a book, none of you was quite this effortlessly entrancing. None of you sounded quite this wise. It's as though she were perched on the edge of my bed. Weaver might be perfect for recession-era entertainment. Save your shrinking production budgets, give this woman a book, and say, "Action!"


Based on Kate DiCamillo's children's book about a chivalrous mouse, The Tale of Despereaux  looks like an illuminated manuscript brought to life. The screen glows with Renaissance golds, mice dressed like serfs, and a princess with Botticelli hair draped over a permanently foreshortened face. Too bad the story's such a mess. As Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) tries to foil a royal kidnapping, his tale snags on loose-knit subplots about a seafaring rat (Dustin Hoffman), and a kingdom-wide obsession with soup. The latter, involving a snooty French chef and visions of floating veggies, gives the movie a whiff of leftover Ratatouille. 

 Once upon a time there was a charming tale of a wee little mouse with wide-open eyes and ears as large as saucers. Named Despereaux Tilling, the mouse grew up, though not by much, to become a reader of books and the besotted friend of a lovely human princess named Pea. In time he saved the day, battling an army of rats, and won the hearts of millions of readers and eventually a contract with a Hollywood studio. This is how the book “The Tale of Despereaux: Being  the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup, and a Spool of Thread” became a computer-animated movie, though without the rambling subtitle and as many eccentricities.  Being  a Hollywood story of a mouse, a princess, some soup and thread — not to mention rats, hats and a girl named Mig  with the unfortunate looks of a pig — the movie “The Tale of Despereaux” offers up other changes too. It begins as all fairy tales should, with a narrator (an efficient, somewhat cool-sounding Sigourney Weaver) recounting the story of the pastel-hued Kingdom of Dor, where the peasants were content, the rulers were just,  and the rats scuttled about unmolested. The balm for this peaceable kingdom was soup, a fragrant broth that flowed out of the royal kitchen and into the waiting bowls of the populace. But good times turned to bad when a rat named Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) fell into the queen’s soup, producing a fatal reaction.  Directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen and written by Gary Ross (who also served as one of the producers), “Despereaux” is a pleasantly immersive, beautifully animated, occasionally sleepy tale. Like most American animated movies, it centers on a plucky hero (softly voiced by Matthew Broderick) who, against the nominal odds (though, really, the odds are always stacked in his favor), overcomes adversity of some kind.  As in Kate DiCamillo’s enchanting, Newbery Medal-winning book, Despereaux has to triumph over both his home life (he’s far too bold for the other mice) and the forces of darkness shrouding Dor. What’s particularly sweet about his journey is that it begins with a book he was supposed to nibble, not read.  Reading transforms Despereaux, turning a bold little mouse into a great big hero —  a wonderful moral for any children’s book. The story he reads is a fairy tale about a sad princess and a brave knight, an adventure that periodically springs to expressive life because Despereaux doesn’t merely read this tale, he visualizes it so we see it too.  Animated in a more graphically bold style than the rest of the movie, the fairy tale becomes a story within a story. And in one clever scene, which finds the mouse describing the exploits of the knight and the princess to a separate character, the fairy tale plays on the wall next to him as if it were being projected like a movie.  It doesn’t take long for Despereaux to experience the dangerous lows and exultant highs of a knight’s quest. Like many other misunderstood heroes, he suffers for his specialness, which in this case finds him banished from Mouseworld, an orderly Lilliput, to Ratworld, a menacing purgatory filled with bones and introduced with a flourish of Middle Eastern flute  music. (The casbah vibe thankfully fades fast.)  There he meets Roscuro, and together they embark on the road to redemption,  with justice and a happily ever after for all, including the princess (Emma Watson) and Mig (Tracey Ullman), a peasant whose porcine qualities suggest that ugliness is destiny. But “The Tale of Despereaux” is on the side of kindness, not cruelty, and it encourages smiles if not the book’s flights of fancy.  The movie has a fine sense of pictorial detail — the mouse’s delicate whiskers, the images of soup ladles carved into the palace stairs — and an agreeable gentleness. It deviates from its source material in generally modest and unobtrusive ways; for instance, by reorganizing the book’s fragmented, parallel story lines into a linear whole.  The main difference between the source and its adaptation is that while the book exudes charm, the movie leans toward cute, a substitution that largely speaks to the influence of Disney on animation. In the movie Despereaux wears a red cap that makes him look more like a well-dressed bunny than like a mouse. But at least he’s not wearing Mickey’s gold clodhoppers and bottom-line grin.  “The Tale of Despereaux” is rated G (General audiences). Some children and city-raised adults might find all the hungry, scurrying rats a bit (or very) creepy.

Kate DiCamillo's delectable novel about rodents, royals and the restorative properties of soup gets the star-laden, CG-animated bigscreen treatment in "The Tale of Despereaux." Nobly striving to realize the source material's many intricacies and chronological shifts, this graphically well-rendered kidpic is less crass and mouthy than many recent feature-length toons, but also more sluggish and ungainly as it tries to approximate DiCamillo's singularly delicate tone. Drawn by a name-heavy voice cast, family auds should lap up the Universal release in healthy but hardly "Ratatouille"-sized numbers. Ancillary biz looks tasty.
DiCamillo's 2004 Newbery Medal winner tells the story of a valiant mouse, a vengeful rat, an ill-treated servant girl and the beautiful princess who, in different ways, transfixed them all. The novel was written in a hushed, almost incantatory prose style, with a tender direct address to the reader that allowed the author's moral insights -- about the virtues of nonconformity, the power of storytelling and the universal need for forgiveness and redemption -- to sink in without condescension.
Yet condescension ends up creeping into the screenplay by "Pleasantville" and "Seabiscuit" director Gary Ross (with screen story credited to Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi), due to lecturesome voiceover narration (by Sigourney Weaver) that spells out every last nuance as the film proceeds along its multiple parallel threads.
The first of these threads concerns the rat Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), who arrives in the kingdom of Dor in time for the unveiling of the castle cook's latest concoction. Soup is a big deal in Dor -- at least, until hungry Roscuro accidentally falls from a chandelier and lands in the queen's bowl, the shock of which hastens Her Majesty's death and impels the heartbroken king to issue a royal ban on soup and rats.
In a different timeframe, deep within the castle's walls, a runty little mouse named Despereaux Tilling (Matthew Broderick) is born. Mentally as well as physically, Despereaux is different from other mice: He's brave, literate and deeply curious about the human world, and the pic spends too much time on comic-psychobabble sequences of Despereaux's parents worriedly discussing their son's rebellious tendencies ("He never cowers!").
One of the rules of this storybook realm is that mice, rats and humans speak the same language, so it's not long before Despereaux forges a heartfelt bond with the lovely, grief-stricken Princess Pea (Emma Watson) -- an unspeakable transgression in the mouse world, for which he is banished to the dungeon to be preyed upon by fearsome rats. There, he crosses paths with Roscuro, who's tormented by his inadvertent role in the queen's death, and plump, freckled Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman), a lowly scullery maid as unattractive as her name.
In keeping with the novel, with its free-flowing compassion for all creatures great and small, the characters here are fuller and more complicated than one would expect. Roscuro is unusually introspective for a rat (as in "Kung Fu Panda," Hoffman delivers the toon's standout vocal turn), and his guilt ultimately leads him on a twisted quest for revenge that endangers the princess -- and calls forth Despereaux's inner hero.
Visually, these critters hew closer to subdued 3-D photorealism than the more colorful, cartoonish style of, say, the "Madagascar" franchise. Action is confined almost entirely to the castle, elegantly detailed by production designer Evgeni Tomov and lensed with an emphasis on moody grays and browns by Brad Blackbourn. While beautiful enough to look at (and nicely supported by William Ross' score), the film feels emotionally muted as a result, and often turns downright laborious as it tries to shift gracefully from one character strand to the next.
As if to compensate, helmers Sam Fell ("Flushed Away") and Rob Stevenhagen crank up the action elsewhere. Among their innovations are the lively kitchen sequences, in which a strikingly designed culinary spirit, composed entirely of fresh produce, inspires the cook's soup recipes. Less successful are the gladiatorial bloodsports held in the rats' underground lair -- which, though hardly violent enough to call the G rating into question, are sufficiently unpleasant to suggest that DiCamillo avoided describing such horrors for a reason.


Kate DiCamillo 's 2003 children's novel about a big-eared mouse with an inspiring case of shining-knight envy is one of the finest expositions of loss, grief, reactive vengeance, and forgiveness for kids. I was looking forward to seeing what Sylvain Chomet , who made the fabulously weird The Triplets of Belleville  , would bring to this great yarn, which trusts small children enough to understand the concept of mixed motives and empathize with hurt rats who hurt in return. Alas, for murky reasons, Chomet was bounced from the project shortly after it was green-lit; only his production designer, Evgeni Tomov , remained. So The Tale of Despereaux  looks good, in a washed-out, Flemish-masters sort of way. Otherwise, screenwriter Gary Ross , who made the cornball Seabiscuit , and directors Sam Fell  and Rob Stevenhagen  have seen fit to turn this delightful tale into, of all things, an intermittently vicious CGI action movie in which the mouse (voiced by Matthew Broderick ) who refuses to cower gets dumped down a well into a dungeon and shoved into a terrifying gladiatorial battle with a gruesomely drawn cat before he can even start saving the world from darkness and gloom. Clumsily wedged in like a TV commercial between deafening stunts, the emotional storytelling sinks without trace, leaving you with only one flawed character to cling to—a morally challenged Cabbage Patch–like servant (wittily voiced by Tracey Ullman ), who learns that every girl is somebody's princess.
