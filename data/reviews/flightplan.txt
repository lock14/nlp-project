No longer the ingenue, Jodie Foster is still a topliner but has entered her 40s with another mother-in-distress role. Remember Panic Room
? Foster�s moms are smart and kick some serious butt, yet it�s depressing to note that this kind of work is the best Hollywood has to offer to a double Oscar winner. In Flightplan
, which aims to be a Hitchcockian-type thriller set within the tight quarters of a jetliner, Foster plays Kyle Pratt, a grieving aeronautics engineer who, with her 6-year-old daughter Julia (Lawston), is accompanying her dead husband�s body home for burial on a intercontinental flight from Berlin to New York. Once the flight takes off, Pratt and her daughter stretch out for a nap, but when she wakes up three hours later her daughter is missing. Even though no one can remember ever having seen her daughter onboard the flight, a search of the double-decker airplane is begun, and when no sign of Julia�s whereabouts surface Pratt grows increasingly frantic. Then it�s revealed that the child�s name is not listed on the passenger manifest, and the crew begins to doubt the widow�s sanity. Pratt is at first aided in the search by air marshal Gene Carson (Sarsgaard), who later cuffs and restrains her as worries about Pratt�s disruption of the flight grow. (Note to pilots: If any passenger ever jumps to the rescue and declares themself to be an air marshal, please ask to see their ID or badge.) The first half of Flightplan
 is taut and reasonably thrilling � a sort of Das Boot
 on an airplane. The relative spaciousness of the double-decker jetliner allows the characters extra space to roam, and as Pratt knows the inner workings of an airplane we get to see the avionics area and cargo holds below. The early parts of the movie also set a creepy tone as things seen out of the corner of Pratt�s eye or words overheard in snatches of dialogue penetrate her consciousness without really making a dent. Pratt�s sanity, however, is never really in doubt for the viewer, despite the disapproving clucks of annoyance she receives from the flight crew and other passengers. And any viewer not suspicious of Carson from the get-go should be sent to Remedial Movie-Watching 101. The last third of the movie devolves into a vicious cat-and-mouse chase as Pratt begins to figure out what�s going on (and it�s pretty far-fetched), and she still has to find her daughter while eluding the bad guys. Director Schwentke's sleek images reveal a bent for weird angles and disorienting viewpoints (the DP is Florian Ballhaus, son of master cinematographer Michael Ballhaus), while the script (by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray) maintains a contemptuous attitude toward the disinterested flight crew and its obnoxious passengers � all 425 of them. Flightplan
 should have remained grounded for repairs.


In "Flightplan," a muscular new thriller, Jodie Foster plays Kyle Pratt, a widowed propulsion engineer who disrupts the calm on a jumbo jet bound for New York City from Berlin after her daughter goes missing. None of the crew can confirm the girl was ever on board (her name doesn't show up on the manifest), and the captain (Sean Bean) implies that Kyle's consumption of sleeping pills and antidepressants might be affecting her judgment: Is she hallucinating this?
People, please: Her husband just fell off a roof; that's him in the high-tech casket down in the luggage hold. Would she really make this up? Post-traumatic stress is possible; Greta Scacchi even appears as a shrink for an in-flight therapy session. But we 
saw the little girl; though I must admit she was such a whiny thing I didn't really miss her once she was gone.
With an increasingly annoyed air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard) as her minder, Kyle demands the attendants check every nook of the plane, whose design she knows intimately. She rushes the cockpit. She accuses a couple of Arabs of taking her daughter and causes all manner of calamity from parts of the plane I never knew existed. (Do they all have shiny crawlspaces that resemble a set from "2001: A Space Odyssey"?)
Halfway into the movie, the basket case mother becomes a shameless terrorist, and, incredibly, you go right along with it. Aside from Sigourney Weaver, Jodie Foster is the only other woman in the history of movies who can play a part like this -- widow, mother, victim, depressed scientist, righteous, angry, agile, scared, distraught, intimidating, much stronger than you, and springing into action with a man's name -- and have you root for her. When Foster pulls off her black long-sleeve T-shirt and reveals the gray short-sleeve one underneath it, the audience is primed to explode with excitement. We know the movie will kick up to a more intense level.
But "Flightplan," which was written by Billy Ray and Peter A. Dowling and directed solidly by Robert Schwentke, doesn't have its heroine's conviction. It'd be better if it had. When a group of Arabs gets swept into Kyle's suspicions, the movie's potential audacity is nerve-racking: Will it really go there? Yet because "Flightplan" operates in a post-9/11 world of air safety, it also remains acutely sensitive to offense.
So while Kyle freely says she couldn't care less about political correctness, the movie does her caring for her. She singles the Arabs out because she thinks she saw them peeking into her Berlin apartment the night before. One of the accused Arabs, Ahmed (Assaf Cohen), says it's all ridiculous, and he is rightly miffed: the movie dares you to think the worst.
In any case, the outcome is so prehistorically apolitical, it's tempting to think the reason Foster's character has a man's name is because Bruce Willis could have played the role two decades ago. But while it's all thoroughly illogical, so is my cellphone's calling plan, and I go along with that.
Ultimately what makes this picture fly is Foster, who's playing another character who turns jeopardy into vengeance as a rite of motherhood. The last film she carried was David Fincher's "Panic Room," which failed to live up to the formidability of its star. Foster doesn't work a lot (Fincher's movie was more than three years ago), so every film she stars in feels like an event: The camera in "Flightplan" devotedly swings around her whenever she stands up. Foster's infrequent appearances lend a sort of urgency to both her work and our response to it.
Her arrival now feels timely given the exasperation with the foot-dragging concerning the Gulf Coast hurricane victims. What we applaud in her character is a woman who refuses to accept "sit tight, ma'am" as an answer in a moment of crisis. When the movie's turmoil subsides, if she's no longer interested in airplanes, there might be a job open for her at FEMA.

         Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone isn't out to get you, as Jodie Foster learns the hard way in the boilerplate, if histrionically entertaining, airline thriller "Flightplan." An amped-up psychological thriller in a tube, "Flightplan" makes good use of the natural free-floating anxiety, claustrophobia and hostility that are par for the course on any routine transatlantic flight, especially in coach, to tell the story of an overwrought supermom flexing her moral authority at 30,000 feet.
 
  Kyle Pratt (Foster), mother, aeronautics engineer, raw nerve, is understandably shaken after the sudden death of her husband, who was killed when he fell off the roof of their Berlin apartment building. A week after the accident, she and her 6-year-old daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston), prepare to take the body back to New York for burial. When Julia disappears three hours into the flight, Kyle discovers that not only do none of the passengers or crew members remember setting eyes on the girl, but her name has disappeared from the passenger log and the airport has no record of her ever having boarded the plane.
 


         






    Naturally, the flight crew members take this information as their cue to apply the iron-hand in kid glove treatment; and from this point forward, Kyle is on full auto-pother, air-raging up and down the aisles in a wide-eyed frenzy of righteousness and mother-love, racially profiling some Arab businessmen and repeatedly demanding to speak to the captain (Sean Bean), who is otherwise occupied. Meanwhile, a genial U.S. air marshal named Carson (Peter Sarsgaard) alternately calms, humors and tries to restrain her as she tries to break into the brand-new, state-of-the-art aircraft's attic, holds, nooks and crannies. No need to tell you that her engineering background comes in handy.
 
  Director Robert Schwentke gets a lot of mileage out of insincere flight attendant smiles — which really can seem sinister in the right context — and weird, periodic rumbling noises that sound like a cross between turbulence and a dump truck depositing its load. He also sets the record straight on what would happen if oxygen masks were to drop from the ceiling: The passengers freak out with abandon, instead of continuing to chat amiably, as though lunch were being served, like they do on those in-flight safety videos. More amusingly, the director, who is German, seems to having some sly fun at the expense of the archetypal American rogue every-person transformed by adversity into an instant vigilante hero with mad technical skills, physical endurance and mental prowess. Kyle is completely comfortable with the idea of inconveniencing (for starters) then endangering (while she's at it) the other 500 passengers onboard, purely on the authority vested in her by motherhood; just as a whiskey-swilling bruiser a couple of rows away is waiting for someone to give him a reason to punch the Middle Eastern gentlemen in the bulkhead. (For businessmen, though, they sure are dressed-down and scruffed-up.)
 
  Loud, abrasive, demanding and just blinkered enough not to stop to consider that she may be in danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, Kyle is not, to put it mildly, the most likable character ever committed to screen.
 
  There's something about watching her tear up the place looking for a child only she believes exists that feels awfully familiar. The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks. But I guess there's nothing like blowing things up to put an end to an argument about who's right.

Flightplan  is one of those thrillers that pivots around the question of how daring  or how focus-group cautious  we suspect the filmmakers will turn out to be. On a double-decker airliner so huge and luxe it looks like the Hindenburg, Jodie Foster, as a newly widowed propulsion engineer (i.e., she knows everything about the design of airplanes), is taking the red-eye from Berlin to New York along with her 6-year-old daughter (Marlene Lawston). When Foster wakes up, the girl has vanished, leaving behind a rumpled blanket and Teddy bear. As the crew members search the plane, turning up nothing, Foster, her face chalk-white, her mouth drawn into a grimace of despair, ratchets up the anxiety. She struts down the aisles in raging fits of hysteria, ticking off the other passengers as she demands that something be done, even as the flight data turns up no record of her daughter ever boarding. Is she crazy, or is she the victim of a conspiracy that would have to be fragile, if not tortured, in its logic?
Since Foster plays warming-up-for-a-straitjacket panic with a clenched intensity rare to behold in a Hollywood actress, I, for one, was rooting for the radical  that is, nuthouse  option. Flightplan  has been ingeniously shot by Florian Ballhaus (son of the great cinematographer Michael Ballhaus), who sweeps the camera with stately dread through the blueish night glow of the aisles, penetrating to the plane’s eerily minimal electro-tech chambers. Peter Saarsgard plays a flight marshal with a bit too much oily fey menace, and as far as the crucial plausibility factor goes, let’s leave it at this: If you actually believed anything that happened in Red Eye , then you have no right to object to Flightplan . Everyone else, object away.


The care and craft exhibited by director Robert Schwentke in "Flightplan" is largely undone by a script that self-destructs in the third act of an otherwise well-made thriller toplining Jodie Foster as a passenger on a transatlantic flight who's lost track of her young daughter. While Buena Vista is hoping the pic can achieve the fine biz done by Foster's previous mom-and-kid thriller, "Panic Room," the distrib may have to settle for the more middling returns garnered by recent airline-hostage pic "Red Eye."
Distraught widow Kyle (Foster) is seen in frozen repose in Berlin's empty Alexanderplatz subway station, then confirming her dead husband's identity and imagining his companionship on the way back home through snowy streets with 6-year-old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston, with strikingly large, sad eyes). German-born helmer Schwentke ("Tattoo") knows these settings and establishes a portentous mood that points to a human-scale suspenser.
As she and Julia board the jumbo jet for the trip Stateside to bury her husband (who, we're told, fell from their apartment building's roof), Kyle reveals she's a propulsion engineer who built the plane's engines and knows the craft inside and out. Such a detail enormously helps her character later on, but, as it unfolds, also points to one of the plot's myriad unlikely story elements.
Julia wanders off in one scene, sending Kyle into a tizzy, but it's nothing like the girl's seemingly total disappearance three hours into the flight.
Refusing to accept that Julia could simply vanish, Kyle grows increasingly frenzied as she demands action from the crew, led by Captain Rich (Sean Bean), a good listener who wonders if he has a delusional passenger. Whether a crime is afoot or a woman is losing her mind is what sends "Flightplan" to full boil, with Schwentke's camera gracefully following the agitated Kyle and setting her in foreground shots against a sea of disbelieving travelers.
Watching her every move is federal air marshal Carson (Peter Sarsgaard), who worries Kyle could become a loose cannon -- as when she eyes an Arab passenger (Michael Irby) and becomes convinced he spied on her in her apartment. Such moments begin to feel like distractions from the main event, which is so astoundingly improbable that it makes all of the film's clever and meticulous craftsmanship feel like a ruse. Especially in a post-9/11 environment, Kyle's actual dilemma emerges as a desperate third-act storytelling escape.
Foster throws herself into her tense role with every fiber. Except in one crucial instance, casting choices are well made, highlighted by Bean as the plane's palpably conflicted commander.
As fellow German director Wolfgang Petersen did for subs in "Das Boot," Schwentke creates a fascinating and suffocating atmosphere aboard the swank aircraft, and lenser Florian Ballhaus (working brilliantly in widescreen) and production designer Alexander Hammond (amazingly inventing an aircraft from the bolts up) erect a thoroughly credible cocoon in which cabin fever can fester. Visual effects in the finale look rushed and fake. James Horner borrows from Gyorgy Ligeti for an itchy score.

How many buttons can a single movie push? Flightplan , Hollywood 's latest airliner-as-pressure-cooker diversion, has its finger on some crucial ones: the panic of losing a child, the fear of going mad, the dread of being stuck on a transatlantic flight with a resourceful lunatichell, even the suspicion of rampant Hitchcock pilferage. But in the passage between its obscure first act and sloppy last one (that is, the portion detailed in the movie's egregiously revealing trailer), Flightplan  becomes more satisfying than the stock thrillerstar vehicle it begins and ends as.
Hung on a plot familiar to anyone who's seen The Lady Vanishes  (to say nothing of this summer's Red Eye ), Flightplan  follows avionics engineer and recent widow Kyle Pratt  (Jodie Foster ) onto a plane she helped design, where her six-year-old daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston ), promptly disappears. Kyle goes nuts trying to find the kid, while an air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard , whose sloe-eyed gravity telegraphs too much here), the captain (Sean Bean ), and a bevy of pouty attendants attempt to assist her and contain her increasing mania. The film collapses into an illogical mess once its central mysterywhether Julia was ever actually onboardis solved and Foster is called upon to play action hero. Before that, her performance is shocking and raw, milking the screenplay's uncomfortable echoes of her own life ("People do terrible things to little girls, sick things!"). Moreover, during the search for Julia, our sympathies and suspicions are bandied expertly from the desperate Kyle to the exasperated crew to a scapegoat Arab passenger. In what may be the first post9-11 movie to use the phrase "post9-11," we're starkly reminded that there's nothing quite so fickle as paranoia, and that some people are never more persuasive than when they're out of their minds.
