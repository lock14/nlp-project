Jennifer Baichwal's gorgeous documentary Manufactured Landscapes  amplifies the powerful work of Edward Burtynsky, a Canadian artist who specializes in large-scale photographs of terrain transformed by civilization into rivers and tides of industrial ugliness. As Burtynsky trains his contemplative eye on seismic economic changes in China  distilled in the country's epic Three Gorges Dam project  Baichwal makes those still pictures come alive. The opening tracking shot through a Chinese factory where 23,000 employees make most of the world's irons is a stunner.


 At one point in the absorbing if unsettling documentary “Manufactured Landscapes,” about the work of the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, a few unnamed voices try to assure a couple of Chinese officials not to worry. Mr. Burtynsky, these voices say, will make everything — meaning the mountains of coal that seem to stretch on forever behind them — beautiful. And so Mr. Burtynsky does. Whether in a coal distribution center or a garbage dump, he turns the grotesque into something beautiful, or at least something that looks good on a gallery wall.  It’s unclear if those Chinese officials are government minders or work for the enormous company that funnels those mountains of coal first into factories and then into the environment. “Manufactured Landscapes” is one of those contemporary documentaries that put a premium on their visuals (which are estimable) and  their  conceptual underpinnings (a bit vague), and pay rather less attention to nominally irrelevant details like dates and names, facts and figures, history and politics. Thus, while some black-and-white video images of Mr. Burtynsky (shot by Jeff Powis) during his photographic safaris is time-stamped to a few years ago, much of the film takes place in a nonspecific present.  In this present, Mr. Burtynsky and an indefinite number of helpers trot across China taking glossy, large-format, generally long-view color photographs of factories, welding sites and recycling centers, with an abbreviated side trip to the Bangladesh coast where young men disassemble oil tankers, at times ankle-deep in sludge. Directed by Jennifer Baichwal and sensitively shot in 16-millimeter film by Peter Mettler, “Manufactured Landscapes” (which is also the name of a 2003 book of Mr. Burtynsky’s photographs) is partly a Great Man documentary, a record of an artist immortalized at the moment of creation: point, shoot, voilà! Rather more interestingly, at times, it also appears to be a rather tentative, perhaps even unconscious, critique of that same artist and his vision.  Critique may be too strong a word. Still, at its most arresting “Manufactured Landscapes” does suggest that Ms. Baichwal and her excellent cinematographer are not entirely at ease with Mr. Burtynsky’s work, which tends to subordinate the human form to the harmonious use of color, the balance of graphical forms and the overwhelming man-made and man-ravaged environments. In many of these landscapes (which I have looked at only in this film and online), scores of anonymous workers become specks of canary yellow and blots of bubble-gum pink, a pointillist population. The angles of their bowed heads and raised arms, carefully arranged before assembly lines, are just some of the decorative, precise formal elements. Note how those angles dovetail with those of the machinery.  What’s missing from these photographs, those populated and not, is any sense of process, of context and consequence. For the most part, the film remains equally silent on the same, though the film’s repeated close-ups of the workers’ faces locked in Mr. Burtynsky’s sightlines suggest that Ms. Baichwal is more concerned with people than the subject is. In this film, at least, a mountain of coal is strictly an aesthetic subject for Mr. Burtynsky, not an index of the miserable conditions of its mining or a ghastly reminder of the nearly 6,000 workers who died in Chinese coal mines in 2005, the year the film was shot.   Or a warning of the pollution that wafts from China’s smokestacks to the Western United States, coating mountains in Oregon, California and Washington State.  The almost freakishly, crystalline detail and obsessively exacting compositions of Mr. Burtynsky’s work can bring to mind that of Ansel Adams, though the subject matter means that it more rightly belongs to the technological sublime than to the natural sublime. In his book “American Technological Sublime,” a study of manufactured sublime experiences — beautifully represented by Walker Evans’s celebratory photographs of the grandeur and engineering feat that is the Brooklyn Bridge — the historian David E. Nye writes that “one person’s sublime may be another’s abomination.” As this film indicates, intentionally and not, an artist may not always be able to gauge the difference between the sublime and the abominable, but with knowledge and a will to conscience a viewer just might.

Eight minutes. That's how long it takes director Jennifer Baichwal's swift-moving camera to track from one end of the 480-meter-long Cankun factory floor to the other in "Manufactured Landscapes'" opening shot. Conceived as a tag-along record of photographer Edward Burtynsky's latest excursion, this landmark glimpse into China's modern-day industrial revolution becomes something more -- a profound, open-ended meditation on man's physical impact on his environment. Without the involvement of a former vice president to catalyze publicity, this eye-opening docu will depend on festival awards,and impassioned critics to drive arthouse interest.
Scale is everything in Burtynsky's large-format color photos. The 51-year-old artist has made a career of documenting "the largest industrial incursions" he could find: giant rock quarries and city-sized coal and copper mines where nature has been carved away and reshaped to leave abandoned slag heaps. "In one frame," he explains, "you can show the dimensions of our extraction in the landscape."
His latest Asian tour provides an entirely new set of subjects: mountains made of recycled computer parts, the rusting carcasses of freight ships, a 600-kilometer reservoir-in-the-making at the future site of the Three Gorges Dam (the graveyard of 13 cities, razed and relocated in the name of progress). Each photo conveys its own paradox, twisting together visions of past and future, beauty and decay: The scenes evoke century-old images when America and Europe underwent their own industrial revolutions, even as they forecast China's rapid, often reckless urbanization.
Following along, Baichwal deftly uses the moving image to reinforce the spirit of Burtynsky's still pictures, expanding the discourse by providing valuable context. Moving through a platoon of factory workers, Baichwal and d.p. Peter Mettler come to rest on Burtynsky setting up a complex crane shot. The shutter clicks to show his final composition, then Baichwal's camera pulls back to reveal the image hanging on a gallery wall, where Western museum-goers examine the details.
The gesture serves as an invitation to consider the deeper philosophical implications of Burtynsky's work. Much as director Nikolaus Geyrhalter does in food-industry docu "Our Daily Bread," photog encourages auds to interact with these static tableaux and draw their own conclusions.
But Baichwal favors a more active camera. She's not afraid to forge personal connections with the individual workers rendered as anonymous, microscopic blips in Burtynsky's photos, even going so far as to interview several of them against the wishes of the Chinese authorities.
The artist's own comments, culled primarily from lectures back home, focus on the tension between the disposable conveniences of today and the long-term environmental effects of industrialization. "Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled," Burtynsky explains, as editor Roland Schlimme cuts from an electronics assembly line to the scrap heap where workers pick through piles of "e-waste."
Still, helmer keeps commentary to a minimum, while Dan Driscoll's score encourages an ethereal, trance-like viewing experiencing by melding music with the ambient grind of industrial noise.
Even without the alarmist undercurrent of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth,""Manufactured Landscapes" serves as a staggering wake-up call, underscoring how far removed Western consumers are from the production of everyday objects. Quite literally "made in China," pic goes a long way to explore the implications of that phrase.

Nothing illustrates the monstrosity of globalized commerce more vividly than the lateral tracking shot that opens Jennifer Baichwal 's mesmerizing documentary Manufactured Landscapes . Maintaining a glacial, Kubrick-like creep for eight minutes of screen time, the camera glides almost a third of a mile through the bubble world of one titanic Chinese factory. Afterward, massed on the street outside in color- coordinated formation as far as the eye can see, the many thousands of employees are robbed of all individuality. Pictorially, though, the image is breathtaking, even playful Metropolis   as designed by Busby Berkeley .
The sight should scare the hell out of environmentalists as well as economic protectionists. But Baichwal's meditative, mood-altering filmstrongly recommended to fans of Koyaanisqatsi and An Inconvenient Truth , and no less important than eitheris more suggestive and unnerving than a mere jeremiad. Its focus is photographer Edward Burtynsky , who specializes in macroscopic panoramas that show how industry has smashed, scarred, and altered the environment. With cinematographer Peter Mettler  working to approximate Burtynsky's eye-in-the-sky perspectives, Baichwal follows the artist's travels through China, where he leaves government officials puzzled over why he'd rather photograph, say, the Martian desolation of Shanghai 's endless Bao Steel  yards than pandas and temples.
But the yards are templesOzymandian monuments to man imposing the will of commerce on entropic disorder. Strip-miners, outsourcers, and earth movers do Burtynsky's processing for him, raking the wilderness into strikingly patterned Japanese gardens of ruin. It's the terrifying vastness of his subjectsa mountainous computer graveyard, the mammoth Yangtze River  Three Gorges Dam  project shown in Jia Zhangke 's Still Life that gives both his photographs and Baichwal's film the hypnotic otherworldliness of science fiction. Yet the scale and symmetry of Burtynsky's work tends to eclipse outrage with awe, which adds to its snake-charming potency.
By finding beauty in appalling heaps of corporate waste and industrial devastation, is Burtynsky aestheticizing the plunder of the planet, and are we lulled into cowed complacency by his Olympian vantages? As in her excellent Shelby Lee Adams  doc The True Meaning of Pictures which refuses to resolve the tension between genuine concern and freak-show gawking in Adams's Appalachian photographsBaichwal undercuts easy answers. Her subject is the discrepancy between how an artist sees the world and how the world sees the art. Where Burtynsky sees the coppery glow of a river of toxic waste, we're inclined to see unnatural disasteruntil we stand rapt before his elegiac photograph. Manufactured Landscapes challenges us flyspecks to relocate our compass, if we can, within the cosmic enormity of Burtynsky's pitiless vision.
