"Ich rieche Blut"
 is the title of a pricey-looking lithograph that adorns the wall of Dr. Michael Glass (Morrissey), himself a pricey-looking London psychiatrist sporting a strictly bargain-basement sense of professional ethics. But don't blame him, and don't blame the bossa nova, either � lay this garish, deliciously awful sequel at the feet of screenwriters Leora Barish and Henry Bean, who have contrived Sharon Stone’s Venus mantrap Cat Tramell back from the clutches of apropos obscurantism and onto the screen, where she positively oozes freaky kink like Tom of Finland oozes leather. "I smell blood," is Dr. Glass' helpful translation to untethered Scotland Yarder Roy Washburn (Thewlis, biting down hard), who's finding both bodies and bodices � torn asunder, naturally � wherever this particular Cat creeps. Stone still dazzles the eye, but this wholly unwarranted sequel is so outrageously preposterous (and so very chockablock with quotable examples of the fine art of bad dialogue) that the end result achieves a basement grandeur of near-epic proportions. I'm tempted to thank original Basic Instinct
 scribe and sometime Hollywood animal Joe Eszterhas for this on at least some level, since he also has the pleasingly asinine Showgirls
 notched on his bedpost. But a � "based on characters created by" credit is hardly the stuff of reliable r�sum�s these days, and so the credit/blame/outrage is to be shared by former Doc Hollywood
 director Caton-Jones and his two screenwriting compatriots. But what fun! In the 15 years since the original film stoked its initial, audience-baiting outrages, Stone's Cat has relocated across the pond � not much else is revealed about that interim span � and reappears on the screen hurtling through an apparently abandoned London at the stroke of midnight in a glistening, black Spyder, with a famous footballer's fist ratcheting her gearbox. Oh, but the bitch is back, and then some: Chaos ensues. Just how bad is Basic Instinct 2
? Well, for starters, there's far less sex than you've been hoping. The conservative timbre of the times may have forced this on the filmmakers, but they've countered with some injudiciously placed dialogue (the female orgasm gets, shall we say, something of an oral workout here) and one helluva cornball plot – a thing of dark, wretched beauty far too complex to go into here, or, to be honest, for anyone to ever fully understand. Thankfully, that's not at all key to the audience's enjoyment of this film, which only asks that you allow it to wash over you like a late-night Skinemax soft-corer, minus the bump �n�' grind but with new, improved histrionics. Blood? Nein, Herr Doctor, Ich rieche schei&#223e;



Absurdly overheated and unforgivably dull, "Basic Instinct 2" is the accidental comedy sensation of the year to date, and while some of the people involved seem to be in on the joke, director Michael Caton-Jones isn't one of them. The sequel to the 1992 thriller is 14 years late and many dollars short of plausibility, and the only risk associated with it is Sharon Stone's.
In once more taking up the role of Catherine Tramell, the amoral sex-freak underwear-spurning possible-serial-killer novelist that made the actress a household name back in the early '90s, Stone is betting that a 48-year-old woman can be as hot and dangerous as the 20-somethings the film industry is addicted to. Bully for her -- in theory. In practice, Stone appears to have had so much work done that her face resembles a tautly made bed, and her unchanging expression of smoldering arrogance seems less an acting decision and more the result of neurotoxins. The body may be willing but the flesh has been immobilized.
All right, that's cruel, but "Basic Instinct 2" is so dramatically slack that there's little to do but ponder the wonders of up-market plastic surgery. The film does open with a scene that promises deranged entertainment: Catherine tears through the deserted streets of late-night London in a Porsche
 Spider, a drugged and barely sensate young man (Stan Collymore) in the passenger seat beside her. She licks his finger and proceeds to, ah, pleasure herself while flooring the accelerator and sailing off a bridge. The police later estimate her speed at 100 mph. "110," she growls. "I hit a pothole."
The young man, a famous soccer star, drowns, and the court assigns Catherine a psychiatrist to judge her sanity. This is Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), handsome and tightly wound and terribly uninteresting. Michael Douglas's Detective Nick Curran from "Basic Instinct" would have wiped his shoes with him. Over the course of the movie, Catherine takes the starch out of Glass's upper lip and reduces him to a puddle of proper British lust, but, like David Ortiz facing a softball pitcher, these two just aren't in the same league.
Catherine seems to have much more fun getting to know everyone in the doctor's orbit and lurking suspiciously nearby when they turn up dead. Potential victims include Glass's ex-wife (Indira Varma), her current boyfriend, a nosy tabloid reporter (Hugh Dancy), and Glass's colleague (Charlotte Rampling, whose numb expression suggests she didn't read the script until she got to the set).
Dogging the hero's steps is Detective Roy Washburn, and the gifted David Thewlis bats this role around with the high-spirited resignation of a man who knows exactly what he has stepped in. Stone also has as much fun as she can under the circumstances; the scene where she straddles a chair in Glass's office and barks out a demand to know what arouses him is close to camp heaven. Say what you will about the first "Basic Instinct," but in the hands of screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and the great, subversive Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, it didn't bother with such piddling issues as restraint.
Alas, "Basic Instinct 2" is all too British, and when it tries to get down and dirty, it just seizes up. At one point, Glass watches through a skylight as Catherine takes part in an orgy, and that's a nice metaphor for the movie as a whole -- it has no idea how to use vulgarity to its advantage. Caton-Jones seems more turned on by architecture (there are a lot of shots of the phallic Swiss Re building in London where Glass works; it's also known as "the Gherkin," nudge-nudge) and he has his hands full trying to make head or tails of the plot.
It's a losing battle. "Basic Instinct 2" makes no sense whatsoever, especially after the Big Twist toward the end. Neither did the original, but that somehow added to its lunatic charms. This time you just hoot in derision and walk out feeling burned. Back in 2001, Stone sued the producers for breach of contract; in essence, she was trying to ensure this movie got made. A smarter actress would have sued to get out.
.


         With "Basic Instinct 2," the "Basic Instinct" franchise (who saw it coming?) enters its unhinged rococo phase. Set in a carefully curated London, abstracted and glamorized to a fare-thee-well, the new movie makes the original Verhoeven-Eszterhas collaboration look positively Hellenic. It's just that fancy. Every surface is buffed, shiny, unbelievably expensive — including Sharon Stone herself, who, should the situation arise, could double as her own limited edition action figure. One thing's for sure, director Michael Caton-Jones has no interest in replicating what by contrast now looks like the vérité
 grittiness of the first movie, in which the occasional character might have possessed a small apartment, bad clothes or a big butt. His London — a glass-and-steel backdrop for the couture collections of the superrich — makes the San Francisco of the first movie look positively poky.
 
  Come to think of it, it makes the whole 1992 notion of superrich look poky, which actually is the most interesting thing about the movie. Were future generations to unearth both DVDs, they'd get a neat lesson in the direction the culture has moved within the interval. Remember when obscene wealth was presented as something to gawk and marvel at? In the first movie, someone tells Michael Douglas' character that Stone's character is worth $100 million and he whistles. It seems so long ago. These days, we're supposed to witness exponential levels of affluence and take them in stride. We're cool. In "B.I. 2," psychiatrists and magazine writers kick back and learn Hungarian in multimillion-dollar digs, and nobody bats an eye. That's because "Basic Instinct 2," for all intents and purposes, is a luxury goods and services commercial aimed at the top 1 percentile, turbo-charged by generous injections of too-graphic-for-network-TV sex and violence. It's so 2006.
 


         






    If the old Catherine Tramell, footloose and panty-free crime novelist and ice-pick murderess, was a femme fatale
 with a soft spot, the new Catherine Tramell is a robo-vamp who has apparently spent the last decade and a half channeling "Sex and the City." (Guess which character was her favorite.) We first encounter her as she charges through a tunnel in her Spyker Laviolette at 100 mph, a wasted soccer star gurgling and cooing in the passenger seat. This time, writers Leora Barish and Henry Bean waste no time introducing us to Stone's privates, so it's racy in every sense. The car goes off a bridge, and Catherine leaves the immobilized footballer to sink as she floats to the surface of the river like an exterminating angel.
 
  Once again, the soccer star's death mirrors the plot of one of Catherine's novels, and soon she is being hauled in by the police for questioning. The detective, this time, is no leonine tough guy with a thing for rough sex. He's a wry, cynical and possibly crooked Det. Roy Washburn, played by a comically mustachioed David Thewlis, who appears to be the only cast member in on the joke. But Catherine has written a book about a cop, as we know. This time, it's the handsome evaluating shrink who catches her eye.
 
  Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) glides along the glossy surfaces of the movie with a lightly concerned look on his face, and, naturally, he has reason to worry. Like Catherine's last subject, he has a troubled past he's working hard to move beyond — a patient he vouched for went on to kill his girlfriend. The strain resulted in a breakdown that ended the doctor's marriage and jeopardized his career. When the production notes describe him as "physically drawn to Tramell and mentally intrigued by her," they're not kidding about the mental part.
 
  In another sign of the times, the diabolical Catherine's psychopathic behavior is reduced to a syndrome. She's a risk addict, you see, and soon she's going to ask Glass for professional help. (The professional impropriety of treating a patient he has evaluated in court is no match for her scissor-like legs.) When she abruptly terminates therapy, the hangdog stalking begins, as do the mind games — no small feat in a mindless universe.
 
  Skulking around her bat lair, and popping up in the most unexpected places modeling backless cat-suits and see-through shirts, Stone plays Catherine as an updated Cruella De Vil with a total disregard for smoking ordinances (anything for art, I guess), slinking and stalking her way through a Byzantine web of plots and couplings involving Glass, his mentor and mother-figure Dr. Milena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling), his ex-wife Denise (Indira Varma), Washburn and the sleazy magazine writer Adam Towers (Hugh Dancy), who happens to be in possession of some damaging goods on either Washburn or Glass or both.
 
  Watching Stone slink along with a diabolical smirk frozen on her face, trailing bodies and clichés, is not, however, without its pleasures. What we may very well be looking at here is another "Showgirls," a drag camp-fest for the "Baby Jane" crowd, fabulous fodder for future cabaret acts, and a pleasure probably best enjoyed in a crowd — preferably a vocal one. Dead serious and stone idiotic, the only basic instinct in evidence here is desperation.
 
 "Basic Instinct 2"
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for strong sexuality, nudity, violence, language and some drug content   

Basic Instinct 2  opens, as it should, with a bang  or about as close as you can get to one in a car that's going 100 miles per hour. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) and her latest conquest  we'll learn, soon after he's dead, that he's a soccer star  are speeding along in the glistening steel-gray London night. Catherine, who's at the wheel, which is just the way she likes it, shoves her fingers into the guy's mouth, and then, as she grabs his fingers and places them somewhere hotter, she laughs and writhes, then moans, then crashes  literally, driving off the road and plunging into the Thames. A ludicrous moment? Yes, but knowingly so, and you've got to say this much for it: Everyone involved looks as if they're having a good time (at least, until they start drowning).
That may be the last moment of unbridled horny joy in Basic Instinct 2 . Theoretically, it was a smart move to set this sequel in England, where Catherine, the best-selling pulp novelist of death-tinged erotic danger, has moved. London, choked with cash, is now swinging in a way that it hasn't since the late '60s, and even Woody Allen, in Match Point , found the inspiration to make a sexy femme-fatale thriller there. But Basic Instinct 2 , directed by Michael Caton-Jones (Scandal ) from a script by Leora Barish and Henry Bean, doesn't unfold in a dirty urban pleasure zone; it's more like the London of drizzly old-school British repression. The sky is overcast, the S& M clubs are dank peeling lairs, and the investigator Catherine has set her sights on is a dour criminal psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass, played by a refined, tall, rosebud-lipped actor named David Morrissey, who looks like the rock star Morrissey  that is, if Morrissey had become the vice president of a bank.
Glass is called on to evaluate Catherine in the wake of her car accident, which probably wasn't an accident, and he then becomes her therapist, diagnosing her with ''risk addiction.'' Putting Catherine on the couch is an amusing idea, but it also diminishes her: a sex goddess reduced to a pathology. As she does her number, sprawling around Glass' ridiculously oversize designer penthouse office in strappy stilettos and zinging him with little verbal daggers, he's lured in a way that's so abstract we're not quite sure if he wants to go to bed with her or write a thesis about her.
Sharon Stone, with lacquered skin and breasts like missiles, her hair styled in a Xaviera Hollander platinum shag, looks coarser now, like one of those vamps on the cover of a hardcore DVD, but she hasn't lost her ability to turn sexual resentment into fiercely insinuating play. In the original Basic Instinct , a fleshpot Vertigo whose randy spirit anticipated the mainstreaming of porn, Stone seemed to channel Madonna, doing blond contempt with a smile, and the shrewdness of her acting was that she took all that bad Joe Eszterhas dialogue and winked at its corny purplish ''heat.'' What counted wasn't the words but the subtext Stone brought to them, her persistent toying glimmer of You know you want to f--- me. Everything else was just talk.
In the 14 years since, Stone has kept on trying to prove she's a real actress, damn it, but Catherine Tramell remains her one indelible character. Famously frustrated at Hollywood's sex-symbol ghetto, Stone, as she did before, pours that resentment right into her role, drawing on the rage of a thousand bimbo casting sessions, that rage now extending, paradoxically, to the moment that sealed her stardom (the simultaneous bravura/ humiliation of the interrogation scene in which she flashed the audience). In Basic Instinct 2 , she successfully revives her performance as Catherine, the vamp who screws and mocks at the same time, who's cold even when she's in heat, who seduces men by turning their desire against them.
Catherine has become, if anything, an even more devious liar than before, to the point that her is it my life or just my novel? web-spinning is now a greater obsession for her than sex. That's a problem. Basic Instinct 2  isn't bad, exactly, but it lacks the entertaining vulgarity of the first film; it's Basic Instinct  redone with more ''class'' and less thrust. (Catherine and her shrink indulge in erotic asphyxiation, which doesn't exactly make you want to try it at home.) As Glass, echoing the original film, tries to clear up a scandal from his past, Charlotte Rampling, as his analyst mentor, and David Thewlis, as a cop who may or may not be a scoundrel, add color, but what Basic Instinct 2  lacks, apart from a line quite as laughable as the original's ''You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind,'' is a sexual tension brazen enough to justify the mounting preposterousness of the twists. It's a treat to see Stone rev her evil-vixen engine again, but apart from that Basic Instinct 2  mostly takes the fun out of kink.

 IT should come as no surprise that "Basic Instinct 2," the long-gestating follow-up to Paul Verhoeven's 1992 blip on the zeitgeist screen, is a disaster of the highest or perhaps lowest order. It is also no surprise that this joyless calculation, which was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and possesses neither the first film's sleek wit nor its madness, is such a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. Acting always involves a degree of self-abasement, but just watching trash like this is degrading.  Once again, Sharon Stone stars as Catherine Tramell, a mass-market crime novelist with a psyche as overheated as her prose style. Jacqueline Susann by way of Jeffrey Dahmer, Catherine the Not-So-Great has something of a black-widow complex, to judge by the body count she seemed to leave in her wake in the original flick.  Old habits die hard, especially in genre films. And so  "Basic Instinct 2" opens with Catherine racing through a sleek cubist cityscape that looks like the usual futurist fantasy but is really just dirty old London after hours. With her hunk du jour drooling in the passenger seat, she flexes her ambidexterity by manically shifting gears while simultaneously pleasuring herself. Mission accomplished, she promptly sails off the road and into the Thames, sinking the car.  This enjoyably sleazy  opening soon proves, much like Catherine herself, to be a cruel tease. As written by  Leora Barish and Henry Bean,  "Basic Instinct 2" turns out to be nothing more than a police procedural freighted with some solid acting talent (David Morrissey, Charlotte Rampling, David Thewlis) and tricked out with a little kink (garrotes, handcuffs and chains, oh my). In between the bullets and heavy breathing, the screenwriters have wedged in some high-brow allusions that suggest either acute desperation or extreme pretension. Certainly this has to be the only film from those reliable schlockmeisters Mario F. Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna  —     Mr. Kassar brought us  the original "Basic Instinct," and together they had a hand in much of  Sylvester Stallone's well-oiled oeuvre —  to feature the word Lacanian.  Namedropping an abstruse school of psychoanalytic theory probably seemed terribly clever at one point; given this film, however, it's grounds for  screenwriting hell. The conceit of a beautiful woman who kills her lovers by lethally jabbing them with an ice pick helped turn "Basic Instinct" into a hot-button success (no panties helped). At once seductively female and fatally male, an outsize vagina dentata and a freakily phallic woman, the original Catherine was an elaboration on the sex-equals-death fantasy spun the previous decade in "Fatal Attraction." Like Glenn Close's bunny-boiler, she embodied both sexual panic and a welter of fears about female power. And just like her bad sister, just like every bad girl who takes temporary control of the screen, she seemed primed to get hers.  The problem is, Catherine didn't die. "Fatal Attraction" ends with the aggrieved wife shooting her home-wrecking rival. Catherine arguably faced a worse end in "Basic Instinct": after running entertainingly amok, with the agreeably game Ms. Stone stealing her every scene, the character wound up in bed with Michael Douglas's detective. As bad as that sounds, nothing compares to the fate that awaited Ms. Stone  simply by growing older  — older at least in Hollywood years. Now 48, the actress retains the same lucid gaze and  whippet-thin body, but in this film her face  looks strangely inert, and she seems deeply ill at ease.   Ms. Stone has famously denied having plastic surgery, and maybe that's true, but, man, does she look weird here.  It's part of an actor's job to change appearances, of course, to put on whiskers and wigs and funny noses, to turn back the clock with hair dye and face tape. And it has long been part of the star's job to undergo a little surgical correction, a nip here, a tuck there. That said, and Ms. Stone notwithstanding, the mania for increasingly youthful-looking faces — these bizarrely unfurrowed landscapes that are absent the normal filigree, absent even a laugh line — seems fundamentally different from the old-fashioned ruse  in which  the Broadway actress  temporarily pulls her loose skin back with some tape. For one thing, the tape comes off. For another, unlike the film actor, the stage performer doesn't have to navigate the close-ups that inevitably betray every secret, no matter how artfully hidden.  The last few decades  have been calamitous for American film actresses  (of any age), who have been increasingly marginalized by the very industry they helped build. It would be wrong to put all the blame for Ms. Stone's appearance and performance in "Basic Instinct 2" on the industry; greed and vanity surely played a part, as did behind-the-scenes wrangling. (Among the directors once expected to take the reins was David Cronenberg.) To judge by the unflattering lighting and camera angles, Mr. Caton-Jones had no particular love for his star. He wasn't about to save her from herself and indeed seems to have decided that the best way into or maybe around the material was to divide it into two films: one, a  fairly somnolent procedural with British actors; the other, a hysterically pitched Hollywood star vehicle.  For amusement's sake, it is possible to read "Basic Instinct 2" as a metaphor for contemporary American-British political relations (a psychotic Yank lures a decent Brit into a web of deceit and murder), but this is a poor reward for two hours of drift and sludge. The camp pleasures fleetingly promised by the crazy opener and the first few minutes of Ms. Stone's vamping soon give way to boredom and time to contemplate, yet once more, just how brutal it is to be an actress in Hollywood. Last year, Ms. Stone delivered a gem of a performance in Jim Jarmusch's "Broken Flowers," reconfirming that her work in films like "Casino" was not an aberration. She was luminous and touching in Mr. Jarmusch's film partly because the role called for her to act her age, and she happily complied.  "Basic Instinct 2" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Soft-core sex, harder-core violence.

Whether thanks to nature or suture, main attraction Sharon Stone looks fine in "Basic Instinct 2"-- it's the movie that needs Viagra and a walker. Those hoping for either a sizzling -- or an unintentionally hilarious -- good time will be disappointed by this inexplicably dull sequel, which exchanges the San Francisco-set original's robust vulgarity for a polite restraint that may be in line with its London locale, but is wholly at odds with public expectations. How much aud remains after 14 years? As with most excessively overdue follow-ups, quick theatrical in and out will likely be followed by serious money via ancillaries. Pic opened in France Wednesday, in advance of U.S. bow. 
Ironically, the demographic that protested in 1992 might be among the few opening weekend loyalists this time around -- lesbians and gays once incensed by the original "Basic Instinct's" bi-sexploitation are now likely to queue up in anticipation of a stereotype-riddled, all-out campfest. "BE-2's" faltering nerve and energy won't turn that trick, however.
Ostensibly living in London to research another pulp novel, erstwhile ice-pick murderess Catherine Tramell (Stone) hurls her sports car around The Square Mile's boulevards with a handsome if barely conscious star soccer player (ex-footballer Stan Collymore) in the passenger seat. She licks his finger, then guides it south of her personal equator.
Lost in the ensuing orgasm, Catherine plunges their vehicle off a bridge. After a cursory attempt to unlock the too-stoned-to-care b.f.'s seat-belt, Catherine swims to safety, looking unshaken.
Nor does she seem remotely remorseful as she smirks through a subsequent police interview with Scotland Yard homicide detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis). Washburn not only found drug paraphernalia in the car, but discovered the soccer dude was dosed with a substance that paralyzed his lungs, killing him before he could drown.
Washburn's friend Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) is called in to provide a psychiatric evaluation of Catherine. Dropping double-entendres like grand pianos, she makes a definite impression on the doc. In court he brands her a manipulative, pathologically lying "risk addict" who might prove a harmful to herself and others if released. Unfortunately, she's walking free moments later on a technicality.
Claiming Glass' analysis "made me think," Catherine becomes a five-day-a-week couch patient of the doctor -- the first of numerous hard-to-swallow instances where the Michael Douglas-manque's sound judgment and professional ethics get tossed aside far too easily.
Suspicions she's simply toying with Glass are fast confirmed as she makes discomfiting inroads with every important person in his life: ex-wife (Indira Varma), her muckraking-journo lover (Hugh Dancy), close colleague (Charlotte Rampling) and esteemed mentor (Heathcote Williams).
Natch, some of these people start turning up dead, and the evidence incriminates Dr. Glass himself.
First reel is promisingly crass and lurid, if sometimes cringe-inducing in its blunt efforts at linguistic shock value. Stone sashays about as if waving an invisible feather boa, pausing for silent ka-boom-cha! after each line, forever scissoring legs in umpteen little-black-dresses. (Perversely, her hairdos and line-free visage at times suggest the soccer-mom winner of a Hilary Duff look-alike contest.) She's fun like Mamie Van Doren was fun -- subtlety need not apply.
But script credited to Leora Barish and Henry Bean then spends so much time following Morrissey around that Stone ends up a guest star in her own movie. A respectable if uninspired directorial choice, Michael Caton-Jones allows a little too much restraint here. While Paul Verhoeven gave the original a sleek pseudo-Hitchcockian surface, he also juiced the sleazier elements to keep viewers awake. The sluggish, talky narrative of Caton-Jones' glossy sequel keeps even the lamentably limited sex and violence which does occur (not much seems left after purported wrangling with the MPAA) from raising viewers' pulses.
The first film outraged and amused by providing the ultimate cinematic articulation of one illogical yet popular definition of "lesbianism": As something hawt girls do just to frustrate and titillate men
.
Beyond a couple eyebrow-waggling hints that she might deploy Sapphic voodoo on Rampling, Catherine is now a "For Men Only" zone. Even her ice-pick has been traded in for a fussier, duller leather choke-collar.
Given an unflattering haircut that makes him look unnecessarily middle-aged, and stuck having to pretend La Tramell is more sexually irresistible than she is camp gorgon, Morrissey maintains an admirable straight face. As do Thewlis and Rampling, though none of the thesps' dignity (nor that of John Murphy's hitherto nondescript score) hold up during a climactic scene as silly as it is talky and unimaginative.
Physical package is handsome enough, with an air of moneyed, primarily nocturnal luxury imparted in all design contribs as well as the well-chosen locations.

At one point in Basic Instinct 2 , Sharon Stone 's castrating nympho-bitch is diagnosed as a "masked psychotic"a sneaky acknowledgment, perhaps, that the real subject of this sadly anticlimactic sequel is not sexual warfare or the pleasure principle or the death drive but cosmetic surgery. It's been 14 years since Stone's Catherine Tramell  sent the San Francisco police force into a horny tizzy. She returns, at 48, with a performance that lends new meaning to "Stone-faced." If we accept the actress's repeated claims that her glossy, creaseless visage is all-natural, then her work here constitutes an eerie tour de force of muscle controla weirdly minimalist form of mugging. As she tries on one nominally come-hither look after another, the immobilized upper portion of her face has the unsettling effect of rendering her expressions doubly ambiguous, as if she's wearing half a kabuki mask. (At this rate, Basic Instinct 3 , due when Stone is 62, should be a Noh play.)
The original Basic Instinct  was both a manifestation and a critique of sex panic, an effortless distillation of a late-'80s/early-'90s zeitgeist: the end of second-wave feminism, the peaking of AIDS anxieties, the dawn of the Clinton years. Stale and corny, BI2  isn't even accidentally relevant. With a Brit journeyman (Michael Caton-Jones ) subbing for Dutch libertine Paul Verhoeven  (David Cronenberg  was slated to direct at one point), there are only the faintest traces of the first movie's lunatic oomph: The riotous opening could almost pass as a Camille Paglia  recuperation of Eminem 's "Stan" video. Crazy Cathy speeds through the London night in her sports car (a Dutch Spyker, perhaps in homage to Verhoeven), fucking herself with the tongue-moistened finger of a semiconscious stud in the passenger seat; at the moment of orgasm, she soars off the road and into the Thames. (The black widow leaves her date to drown.) The final few scenes mount a belated, scorched-earth charge into Grand Guignol territory, but in between, it's nearly two hours of yawnsome exposition and dopey psychoanalysisCatherine doesn't flash anyone, let alone the audience, but there are numerous shots of her squeakily writhing on her shrink's leatherette chaise.
The first film rested on the unbeatably icky/iconic presence of über-'80s specimen Michael Douglas . Here David Morrissey 's psychiatrist, a pasty patsy of a leading man, is no match for Stone. As in the original, Catherine's mind-warping hotness supposedly inspires men to new heights of animalistic bedroom technique (eyeing her dust jacket photo, prominently propped on his nightstand, Morrissey's character proceeds tooohtake his girlfriend from behind!). But the few sex scenes (all hetero) are sub-softcore and pretty much kink-free, unless you count a sweetly affectionate instance of garrote play.
The screenplay, by Leora Barish  and The Believer 's Henry Bean , never approaches the brutish tackiness of Joe Eszterhas 's blueprint. In fact, the dutiful dirty talk ("Would you like to come in my mouth?") is a lot less funny than the random high-toned name-drops ("How Lacanian," Charlotte Rampling 's senior psychoanalyst murmurs, apropos of not very much). Additionally, Stone's costumes are tamelittle black backless numbers and strappy stilettosand she doesn't even have cool props. Divested of her ice pick, Catherine is reduced to touristy kitsch, fondling lighters in the shapes of London's phallic landmarks.
Not content simply to examine the relationship between sex and death, BI2  ponderously blurs the boundaries between art and life, and the plot, already mired in nonsensical backstory, collapses with the late-inning introduction of a tired metafictional device (not to mention a wildly lunging Usual Suspects  twist). The intriguing final shotin which one of the characters struggles in vain to stifle a smileclues us in to the movie Caton-Jones might have hoped he was making. But for most of Basic Instinct 2 , as Stone decisively demonstrates, it's all too easy to keep a straight face.
