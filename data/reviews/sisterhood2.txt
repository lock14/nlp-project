The only title more unlikely than "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" is "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2." Wait, you mean those faded jeans are still out there, with all the customized doodads and the magical ability to fit Ugly Betty, the former Joan of Arcadia, and two CW girls (one Gossip, one ex-Gilmore)? Aren't these ladies too old for this? They are, and in this crowded, borderline epic sequel to the 2005 hit, they're thinking about folding the pants for good.
The jeans were an authentic unifying device in the first film, equalizing and harmonizing four very different women. In a bitchy, mean-girls era, these four seemed like sincere friends. The second installment, which like the first is based on Ann Brashares's book series, is watchable despite its tedious weave of stock plots. The movie finds the sisterhood in that awkward summer between college freshman and sophomore years, when high school relationships suffer neglect at the prospect of an expanded socio-extracurricular universe. You'd think a Facebook account might solve some of that angst, but this is a world where people are lackadaisical about sending and reading e-mails. The movie is old-fashioned that way - very 2005.
Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) has a pregnancy scare with her boyfriend (Leonardo Nam) while taking an NYU screenwriting course (will she use her experience to write "Juno 2"?). Bridget (Blake Lively) goes on an archaeological dig, discovers letters her father has hidden from her, and heads from Turkey to Alabama. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is caught between the advances of the nude model (Jesse Williams) in her RISD drawing class and the remorse of her first love, Kostos (Michael Rady), now like a walking episode of "Guiding Light." Poor Carmen (America Ferrera) is woebegone that her pals don't want to spend the summer together and heads to drama camp, where she's embroiled in a Disney Channel version of "All About Eve" opposite the Yale classmate (Rachel Nichols) who invited her.
Directing from Elizabeth Chandler's script, Sanaa Hamri takes over from Ken Kwapis, and she generates familiar human warmth. She's also raised the number of interracial relationships and without the fuss of her previous interracial romance, "Something New." But in oscillating among all these plots, arguments, fantasies, and pratfalls ("I just fell off a donkey!"), the movie drags something awful. The film's climax takes us, with hilarious ease, to a seaside village in Greece, and it's disappointing, to say the least; you come all this way and not one ABBA song.
The adults who show up to guide and inspire are distinguished enough: Kyle MacLachlan swishing it up at drama camp, Blythe Danner regal in Alabama, Shohreh Aghdashloo wise and glamorous in archeological safari wear, Rachel Ticotin underused again as Carmen's mom. The real trouble is that Tamblyn, Lively, Bledel, and Ferrera, while lovely in their respective sections on "Traveling Pants 2," make the greatest sense together: the hugging, the fighting, the sitting around staring out at the sea. What they have goes beyond basic chemistry. They seem spiritually fused and, at this point, exceedingly womanly. In the intervening years, they've become pretty good actors, too. Now where's the filmmaker who'll give them more to do than pregnancy scares and falls off donkeys?


The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants  and its sequel, the less elegantly titled Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 , both make a good-natured case not only for equality among women but for equality among a far cattier subset: up-and-coming starlets. In each film, the story  easily shorthandable as a young-adult version of Sex and the City    follows the separate adventures of four best teen gal pals as they compulsively mail each other the same pair of ''magic'' vintage jeans. But three years ago, in Sisterhood   1, half the cast were way more famous than the other. Back then, TV stars Alexis Bledel  (Gilmore Girls  ) and Amber Tamblyn  (Joan of Arcadia  ) were the well-known pair of actresses, although you'd never know it from the movie, which smoothly offered all four performers equal time to be cute, freak out about something, and literally wear the pants.
Perhaps it's no shocker, given the way Hollywood likes to turn 'em over, but now it's the other two members of the sisterhood  Blake Lively of Gossip Girl   and America Ferrera  of Ugly Betty    who are a lot bigger deals outside the multiplex. Once again, much to the sequel's credit, the story doesn't seem to care. The movie keeps moving quickly (but not sloppily) among the heroines, so that if you're overloaded, say, on one sister's sugary plotline, it only comes around every fourth scene or so, and never sticks around too long. Even at 111 minutes, Pants  mostly sprints.
This time, the summer after our heroines' first year of college, Carmen (Ferrera) arrives at theater camp a backstage tech and  whaddaya know  discovers she's a leading lady; Bridget (Lively) ditches an archaeological dig in Turkey to learn more about her dead mother; Tibby (Tamblyn) almost has a breakdown after a bad experience with a two-year-old condom; and Lena (Bledel) wastes time with a fella who (oh, no!) doesn't believe in the idea of one true love. As with the first movie, only two of these plots (this time, Tamblyn's and Lively's) transcend being kinda silly; the other two are harder to take if you're over the age of 15 and old enough to know how the world really works. But even cynics might concede that, again, four capable actresses have pulled off a relatively rare thing: They've convinced us they're an honest-to-God movie sisterhood.

 “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2” is the movie equivalent of being patted on the shoulder by an encouraging high school guidance counselor and assured that you are doing just fine. Never mind that the four main characters in this sequel to the first film, a modest 2005 hit,  are now college age. Individually and collectively, they are still in high school.  A protective layer of fairy-tale wish fulfillment keeps its characters, adapted from Ann Brashares’s novels,  at a studious distance from brute reality. That’s because “Traveling Pants 2,” directed by Sanaa Hamri from a screenplay by Elizabeth Chandler,  knows its target audience  —  tweens and up  —  and would rather stroke romantic fantasies than dash them. Observed through emotional gauze, its four likable women are symbolic cheerleaders for personal loyalty and wholesome living. Their boyfriends are the stuff of girlish fantasy: tender, unspoiled dreamboats with sculpted abs (over which the camera lingers), puppy dog eyes, hearts of gold and well-scrubbed vocabularies.  All four are potential high achievers. Bridget (Blake Lively), who has won a scholarship to Brown, goes to Turkey for the summer on an archaeological dig and, with the help of a wise, earthy professor (Shohreh Aghdashloo), begins coming to terms with her mother’s suicide. She eventually  visits Alabama to reunite with her grandmother (Blythe Danner, playing a salty Southern matron). Bridget is the only one of the four without a boyfriend.  Lena (Alexis Bledel), recovering from  ruptured first love with her Greek sweetheart, Kostos (Michael Rady), is studying drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design and has a romance with Leo (Jesse Williams), a handsome artist’s model and amateur chef.  Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), who is studying film at New York University  and working in a video store, is thrown into a tailspin after sleeping with her boyfriend, Brian (Leonardo Nam), and missing her period. Moody and wisecracking, she has the most personality of the four. When a young couple visits the store looking for something romantic, her boss overhears her sarcastically recommending “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”  Carmen (America Ferrera), a lonely Yale student, tags along after her friend Julia (Rachel Nichols), a drama major, to a summer theater in Vermont, where she does backstage work until she is pressured to audition for a production of  “The Winter’s Tale,” in which she is cast as Perdita. She has a crush on Ian (Tom Wisdom), a courtly, handsome young British actor. Ms. Ferrera may be adorable in “Ugly Betty,” but her facility with Shakespeare is another matter.  The movie hopscotches haphazardly from one story to the next, connecting the friends through the same pair of magical, one-size-fits-all patched jeans that they pass around and that originally bound them. Each time the jeans change hands, they confer blessings.  In the three years since the first “Traveling Pants” movie, the balance of celebrity power has shifted among the stars. In 2005  Ms. Tamblyn and Ms. Bledel were riding high from the series “Joan of Arcadia” and “Gilmore Girls.” Because of “Ugly Betty” and “Gossip Girl,” Ms. Ferrera and Ms. Lively have pulled ahead.  If an unspoken rule among the sisterhood is never to poach on a friend’s romantic territory, it doesn’t apply to their other friends and relatives. It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie’s designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine Carmen’s triumphs in romance and onstage.  But “Traveling Pants 2” has little appetite for viciousness. It would rather impart the positive life lessons summed up by its characters in two-sentence sound bites than wallow in cutthroat competition, treachery and revenge.  “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2” isn’t entirely a mean-girl-free zone, but you have the sense that it would like to be.  The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has one mild love scene.

With very little sex and very little city, "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2" still seems a good bet to grab a sizable chunk of the underserved chick-flick demographic, boosted by its young stars' blossoming profiles (particularly "Gossip Girl's" Blake Lively) and a blithely shallow approach to story. A likable quartet of players, a surfeit of male bimbos and an appetite for quick-cooked emotion should make the Aug. 6 Warner Bros. release a bigger hit than its 2005 predecessor, which grossed $39 million domestically.
Adapted (like the first film) by Elizabeth Chandler from the novels by Ann Brashares, pic finds our girls no longer girls: Bridget (Lively) is playing soccer at Brown; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is at NYU film school; Lena (Alexis Bledel) is attending the Rhode Island School of Design; and Carmen (America Ferrera) is miserable at Yale. "I was lost without them," Carmen says of her friends during the treacly recap of events since the last movie.
Carmen is expecting them all to reunite for the summer, but her pals have other plans. Tibby has summer school in Manhattan. Lena is taking a drawing class, where she meets hunky model Leo (Jesse Williams), who may help her forget her true love, Kostos (Michael Rady). Bridget is going on an archeological dig in Turkey, where she meets the inspiring Professor Mehani (Shohreh Aghdashloo), gets to dress herself from Barneys Antiquities Excavation Collection and thinks about how much she misses her grandmother (Blythe Danner).
So Carmen accepts an invitation to a Vermont theater camp from a Yale classmate, Julia (Rachel Nichols), who's far too blonde and Waspy not to eventually turn evil. (Along with sisterhood, pic isn't afraid to embrace galloping cliche.) There, Carmen assumes the backstage role she was playing at Yale, until she's brought out of the wings by the hunky, Brit-accented Ian (Tom Wisdom). Cast as Perdita in "A Winter's Tale," Carmen blooms like a Shakespearean rose.
Ferrera gives by far the best performance in the film -- Lively is all mannerism and smoky looks, Tamblyn is doing shtick inspired by Liza Minnelli and Joan Blondell, and Bledel is fine, if prettily unengaging. But as great as she is, Ferrera is not a classical actress, and the enthusiasm that greets her every Elizabethan utterance is a bit hard to swallow. But "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2" is about pleasability, not plausibility.
Meanwhile, the pants keep traveling: In the original, the girls found a pair of dungarees that mysteriously fit their disparate physiques (through, it must be assumed, jean-etic mutation) and stay in touch with each other's rapidly changing worlds by FedExing the garment back and forth. What the pants will do when confronted by a pregnant member of the sisterhood becomes an issue -- in fact, it's the
 issue, since every other crisis in the film is basically much ado about nothing. Eventually the pants bring them all to a gloriously shot Greece, where Lena will have to resolve things with Kostos, who's either married or not (it's hard to say).
Helmer Sanaa Hamri ("Something New") exposes her musicvideo roots in the glib way she and d.p. Jim Denault use the four young stars as props and arrange the story's emotionally wrenching moments as if they were peaks in a bowl of whipped cream. It's all largely eye candy, especially the men, although this can be forgiven: Women have a long enough history of being superficial in the movies, and a little payback is perfectly understandable.
Production values are first-rate.

Resist if you dare, and for as long as you must, but even the hoariest haters eventually succumbed to the girly, cottony charms of 2005's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , if in the privacy of their Netflix  queues. I foresee a similar fate for its blandly engaging sequel: moms, daughters, and faux-ironic twentysomethings filling the theaters, the rest of us filling our jammies and DVD players in six months. New director Sanaa Hamri reunites the cast, who keep the more trepidatious viewer's shame-o-meter in check with genuinely appealing performances: Back are Alexis Bledel  and her primly knitted brow; Amber Tamblyn 's delightfully transparent hardass rap; America Ferrera 's earnest, wounded mother hen; and Blake Lively 's thoroughbred lope. A year at Ivy League  colleges has forged some cracks among the foursome, and the theme of that first, painful breach among formative cronies is surprisingly acute, despite the soapy flourishes (multiple false pregnancies, a grandma resurrection, courtly confusions) that its target audience will eat up with a spoon. The conceit of the magical denim conduit quickly fades into the background as the girls—apart now not just for the summer but the foreseeable future—grapple with the implications of losing touch and growing up, and whether those might be the same thing.
