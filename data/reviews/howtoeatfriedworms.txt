Doubtless the idea of watching people eat worms for more than an hour will likely entice any conscious 10-year-old, but I can't deny more than a little reticence about the possibilities for an enjoyable moviegoing experience. Fortunately, the result was a pleasant surprise. While the film version of this hugely popular book lacks the complexity and wit to achieve the status of a classic, How to Eat Fried Worms
, which was filmed in Austin, delivers heart and humor in a simple and straightforward manner. It's charming, funny, and even has a few good jokes for the over-18 set. The film tells the story of 11-year-old Billy (Benward), the new kid in a school suffering under the reign of the villainous bully Joe (Hicks). Every student bows in terror at the thought of young Joe and his "death ring." Upon puncturing the skin of its victim, the ring inserts a poison, which lays dormant until the recipient dies in the eighth grade. On his first day at school, Billy inadvertently and publicly humiliates said bully, thus opening the door for incessant retribution via Joe and his small army of devoted followers. In attempt to end the taunting, Billy agrees to a bet demanding that he eat 10 worms in one day. As a result, Billy must contend with his notoriously weak stomach, his annoyingly adorable brother, and Joe's cadre of ragtag supporters. The dynamics among the young boys (reminiscent of, though not as good as, the excellent Holes
) is repeatedly entertaining while the parade of fifth-graders runs around town concocting new and crazier ways to prepare a worm. Additional highlights include Cavanaugh (TV's Love Monkey
 and Ed
) as Billy's father, also struggling to fit in and contend with an overly eager new co-worker. Panitz is also very funny as Billy's younger brother and the perpetual center of attention. Ultimately, the film displays mature storytelling techniques, while never steering from the wide-eyed perspective of a kid who has to eat worms to prove his worth. Though Fried Worms
 is not a kids' movie that adults should run out and see, it is a kids' movie that adults should run out and take their kids to. The sweetness of spirit and rapidly moving story will keep parents entertained while blessing the kids with a mildly raunchy good time.


The new kiddie gross-out movie ``How to Eat Fried Worms" will not appeal to two types of people. The first is anyone who feels squeamish about worms in general and especially
 worms that have been microwaved or pureed or fried into blubby lumps and then (deep breath) consumed.
The second group consists of anyone who holds dear the original 1973 book by Thomas Rockwell (Norman's son, purveying a rather subversive version of his dad's Americana). Several generations of kids have turned the page with bated (or baited) breath, waiting to see whether Billy will slurp down another wriggler and win his $50 bet, but the filmmakers toss the book over their shoulders and start from scratch.
There's a kid named Billy, and he eats worms on a dare, and that's about all the movie has in common with its source. Truth to tell, that's all the movie needs to have in common with its source. ``This is really disgusting
," my 9 -year-old's friend whispered to her during the screening. Then he added , ``But I like it."
From a parent's viewpoint, two feet higher off the ground, ``How to Eat Fried Worms" is lackadaisical stuff, easily the least of the unpretentious children's book adaptations produced by family-ori-ented Walden Media (``Because of Winn-Dixie," ``Hoot," ``Holes"). If it grows more genial as it pokes along, it still feels like a lesser Nickelodeon special, with adults who are shrill cartoons and kids who are one-note character tics.
New kid in school Billy (an uncharismatic Luke Benward) stands up to class bully Joe (Adam Hicks) by taking a dare that he can eat 10 worms in one day. Joe's minions scamper to collect the crawlers and come up with suitably foul ways of preparing them, even as Billy tries to hide the fact of his nervous stomach and keep a helpful classmate -- a girl
, ewww -- at arm's length. The girl is played by Hallie Kate Eisenberg, once the cute li'l tyke singing in Aretha's voice in those Pepsi commercials, and with her graceful new height and way with a bow and arrow, she's much the classiest person here. Needless to say, the movie wants nothing to do with her.
``How to Eat Fried Worms" is a boy movie in word and spirit, and it plays like a Little Rascals short with a few messages about being true to your conscience folded in for nutrition. Most of the calories come from the worms, which alive or parboiled (none were harmed during filming, you'll be glad to know) are given close-ups worthy of Garbo.
Eventually, we learn that Joe is a bully because his older brother (Nick Krause) is a thug, and that the gang -- Twitch, Techno, Plug, Benjy -- will come to his emotional rescue even after switching sides to Billy. ``How to Eat Fried Worms" gets that right, at least: the way kids create social groups that, if they're young enough, fluidly split and re-form several times in the course of a lazy afternoon.
It's the grown-ups who are stuck playing cliches: the ramrod principal (James Rebhorn), the idiot history teacher (Andrea Martin), even clueless, well-meaning old dad (Tom Cavanagh , miles away from ``Ed"). Wouldn't it be interesting if one of these kiddie movies did the math and hinted that its young heroes will grow up to be
 these people?
No, that would be scary; scarier than eating worms, anyway. ``How to Eat Fried Worms" ultimately keeps the compact of the book by insisting its hero's icky dilemma is the most important development in human history -- until dinnertime, when something else will have come along. The movie has a pleasing skinned-knee innocence that makes you wish everything else about it wasn't so shoddy.

Walking into How to Eat Fried Worms , the adaptation of a 1973 kid-lit classic that I remember enjoying back in grade school  not as much as Encyclopedia Brown  but more than Hooples on the Highway   I had two questions: Why did we have to wait 33 years for the movie, and why did they have to make it now ? To the first point, Fried Worms ' appeal is right there in its title, only the second-best title of the month (after Snakes on a Plane ) but still maybe the second-best title of all time. They should've filmed it a generation ago. Especially instead of waiting till now, the grody age of Fear Factor , when it's easy to imagine the movie going overboard on the gross-out stuff. We're lucky they didn't ''reimagine'' it as How to Eat Fried Squirrel Sphincters .
Happily, after a cartoon opening-credits sequence that overdoes it on the barf, Worms  goes light (but not too light) on the gore and the goo. The movie is still about a kid (Because of Winn-Dixie 's winning Luke Benward) who, strong-armed into a bet at school, has to eat creepy crawlers into the double digits, and once he gets started, the focus is more on boys being funny and weird than invertebrates getting microwaved. If only writer-director Bob Dolman hadn't added on an unnecessarily rotten bully (Adam Hicks). Aren't squiggly, wiggly worms  whether prepared with lard, marshmallow sauce, peanut butter, or a blender  antagonist enough?

 THE worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly what they do in the children’s film “How to Eat Fried Worms” is end up battered, splattered, pureed, deep fried and nuked (in a microwave).  The story, based on the popular book by Thomas Rockwell, first published in 1973, involves the new kid on the block who, in a spasm of nutty, if age- and gender-appropriate braggadocio, agrees to a wormy dare under pressure from the school bully. Nicely directed, the film version proves refreshingly free of the customary blights that affect most modern children’s movies, notably adult condescension. But, man, is it mean.  It could hardly be otherwise. As the title says, “How to Eat Fried Worms” is, at least in part, about how to eat fried worms.  Recently transplanted to a new town, 11-year-old Billy (Luke Benward) has barely climbed off his bicycle when he becomes a target of scorn and abuse. Led by a pint-size terror named Joe Guire (Adam Hicks), the boys in Billy’s fifth-grade class immediately give him the freeze and then stuff a handful of worms in his lunch thermos.  Initially appalled, Billy retaliates with some big talk and a fearsome gesture that wins him the approval of some of the other school outcasts: he tosses one of the worms in Joe’s face, turning his carrot-topped tormentor’s freckles a darker shade of red.  Joe exacts his revenge of course, which is how Billy, strong of heart but weak of stomach, ends up eating and sometimes slurping one creepy crawler after another over the course of one Saturday afternoon.  For Billy — whose predictably useless if warmly loving parents (played by Tom Cavanagh and Kimberly Williams-Paisley) can offer him no help, largely because he doesn’t tell them what’s going on — the crucible of the worms has the potential glory, certain agony and epic dimension of a knight’s quest. If he succeeds in completing his gastronomic journey, he earns his freedom and more; if he fails, it will be an exceedingly long school year. For as the worms and his stomach turn, so does his life.  If “How to Eat Fried Worms” sounds like Iron John for peewees, that’s more or less how it plays out, though with more intentional laughs than provided by Robert Bly. The questing young males in the film don’t bang drums to satisfy their mythopoetic needs; they just throw another worm on the barbie.  As important to their strange rite of passage and to the film’s plangent realism, the boys also join forces whenever a grown-up (including the great Andrea Martin as their teacher) comes snooping. The secret worlds that children make for themselves are delightfully realized in a scene in which Billy’s father asks the boys, enemies and friends alike, what they are up to and receives a collective “having fun” in response.  Directed by Bob Dolman, who also wrote the fine adaptation, “How to Eat Fried Worms” is an easygoing entertainment in which a sensible message about growing up also rationalizes the abuse of power. However lightly played, this is, after all, a film in which children learn to stand up for themselves, and for one another, by killing animals.  Yeah, yeah, we’re talking worms, sure. But the lesson remains the same, whether it’s an invertebrate squirming on the grill or a puppy. On the page Mr. Rockwell’s humor produces hoots. (“Tomorrow I’ll roll the crawler in cornmeal and fry it. Like a trout.”) But transposed to the big screen, yuck! No worms may have been harmed in the making of this film, but it’s unlikely the under-age audience will care.  “How to Eat Fried Worms” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There is some talk about poop and lots of cooked worms.

Not long ago, the titular dish in "How to Eat Fried Worms" would have elicited a repulsed grimace (or at least a raised eyebrow). But a generation inured to gross-out contests on "Survivor" and "Fear Factor" may find eating worms fairly tame stuff. Based on the popular 1973 book about a boy who finds his courage through a worm-eating challenge, this is a decidedly old-fashioned family film that may prove too quaint for modern auds. Unlikely to spawn a gustatory sensation, "Worms" should fare modestly in theaters, finding its real legs as a rental.
Thomas Rockwell's classic tale (worldwide sales top 3 million) harks back to a more innocent time, faintly recalling the era immortalized in his father Norman's Saturday Evening Post covers. As adapted and helmed by Bob Dolman ("The Banger Sisters"), the tale's anachronistic innocence remains refreshingly intact; whether kids will take the bait is another matter.
A jaunty animated title sequence indicates that 11-year-old Billy Forrester (Luke Benward) and his family have moved to a new town. At school, Billy is ostracized by freckle-faced bully Joe Guire (Adam Hicks), whose attempt to sabotage Billy's lunch (with a thermos of live worms) leads to a cafeteria skirmish.
Joe dares Billy prove his mettle: Eat 10 worms by 7 p.m. Saturday. The loser must come to school with worms in his pants.
With the exception of the gawkily tall Erika (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), Billy is friendless, so he has little to lose. His mom (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) and dad (Tom Cavanagh) are too busy tending to his annoyingly adorable 5-year-old brother (Ty Panitz) to notice Billy's struggles. After an aborted attempt to run away, Billy decides to face the challenge.
Joe enlists a gang of kids with monikers like Twitch (Alexander Gould) and Techno Mouth (Andrew Gillingham) to oversee the challenge. With Joe's henchman Benjy (Ryan Malgarini) serving as chef, each earthworm concoction is more vile than the last, until every culinary permutation is exhausted. The worms are not just fried, but boiled, stewed, pureed, nuked: "Radioactive Slime Delight" and "The Barfmallow" are fully deserving of their names.
Paradoxically, the worm-eating dare, though disgusting to watch -- kudos to the prosthetic worm creators; the crawlers look appallingly real -- is the film's most enlivened sequence. Dolman has wisely condensed the challenge into one day (in the book it takes two weeks) and fleshed out the motley gang to make the contest more cinematic. He also added the sensible Erika to stimulate female interest.
Other than the gifted Eisenberg, who is blossoming into an offbeat dimpled beauty, the child thesps resort to a lot of mugging, which soon wears thin. As with many family pics, grown-ups are marginalized, though rarely are decent actors like Cavanagh, Williams-Paisley and James Rebhorn (as the school principal) wasted as fully as they are here.
As deftly captured in Richard Rutkowski's lens, Caty Maxey's color-splashed production design evokes a bygone era -- one in which an 11-year-old can (gasp!) be left alone to babysit his 5-year-old brother. Animated sequences are more effective as title and credit bookends than in one awkwardly inserted fantasy.
