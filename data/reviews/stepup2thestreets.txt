"Step Up 2 the Streets" has an instant-messenger title, a text-message story, and camera-phone cinematography. Some people won't know whether to watch it or hold it up to their ear. It does manage to bring some optimism out of Baltimore, which for five seasons has been under grim realist siege on HBO's "The Wire."
Our heroine in this so-so sequel to the so-so 2006 Channing Tatum hit is a b-girl named Andie. She's played by Briana Evigan, who has Demi Moore's charbroiled coo and about the same lack of charisma. Andie is a member of the 4-1-0, the kind of hip-hop dance crew that terrorizes commuters with snaky slides, crab-walks, and tornado spins. They krump. The passengers cringe. And the keyed-up local news coverage leads you to think Al-Qaeda has struck.
Having just lost her mom to cancer, Angie refuses to behave, spending too many nights competing in underground dance battles called the Streets. Her mom's friend (Sonja Sohn, conveniently a "Wire" detective) tells her to shape up or she's shipping her out to Texas. Suddenly, Tatum magically drops in for two scenes and gets her to enroll in the Maryland School for the Arts, where the rest of the movie's cliches live. Andie meets Chase (Robert Hoffman), the rich heartthrob; Moose, the loose-limbed nerd (Adam G. Sevani); Chase's brother, Mr. Collins (Will Kemp), the young hip-hop-dance-loathing instructor; and an assortment of other multiethnic outcast prodigies. Every locker in this school probably has Debbie Allen's headshot taped to the door.
"The Streets" is cobbled together from After School Specials and scraps of other urban dance dramas - "Fame," "Take the Lead," "Save the Last Dance." The recycling is good news only if we're judging movies by their carbon footprint. Otherwise, "Step Up 2 the Streets" is only any good when people are dancing. (The choreography is by Dave Scott, Hi Hat, and Jamal Sims, whose moves run from Michael Jackson to Missy Elliott.) Otherwise, there's too much time to notice that the movie's politics are unkind.
Andie is the only member of the 4-1-0 apparently in school. While she falls asleep studying, the rest of gang is partying and PlayStationing; they mostly happen to be black, which I'd be tempted to say the movie hadn't noticed, if some of the forces of real positivity were black, too. The upside is that the happiest place in Baltimore appears to be the house of Andie's friend Missy (Danielle Polanco), where all her big Latin family does is salsa. The current, much better Canadian movie "How She Move" has a more realistic grip on the racial politics of hip-hop-dance.
Eventually, Andie gets kicked out of the crew for missing rehearsal. She was in school. But as the virile, no-nonsense leader and maybe Andie's boyfriend (the movie never tells), Tuck (Black Thomas), insists the 4-1-0 comes second to nothing - not some stupid plies and definitely not self-betterment. Of course, when Chase hears about Andie's eviction, his advice sounds too simplistic to be possible: "Start your own crew!" God bless his blue-eyed soul.
Together, they cobble together an energetic, ragtag gang of classmate freestylers to seal an aerobic, rain-soaked happy ending that defuses racial and social politics by getting them soaking wet. It's a finale only Rihanna could love. Bring an umbrella ella-ella-ella-eh.


In a sequel that features the original's Channing Tatum only in cameo, a Baltimore teen (Briana Evigan, very winning) enrolls at an arts academy, leaving her street-dancing pals behind. So far, ho hum. But when she decides to form a new crew with her classmates, Step Up 2 the Streets  improves considerably  and it doesn't skimp on cool pretzel moves. Never mind that the movie heedlessly asks you to cheer against the less white, less privileged street kids. (Okay, mind a little.)

 “Step Up 2 the Streets” is an earnest sequel to the 2006 cornball musical drama “Step Up,” mixing new characters into the original’s setting, the neighborhoods surrounding the Maryland School of the Arts in Baltimore.  Like its predecessor, this follow-up takes place in a gritty neighborhood, has a white lead, posits a universe where racial and class differences are minor obstacles to fun and pretends its clichés aren’t clichés.  The heroine of this one is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphaned girl and a member of the 410, a notorious crew that stages musical pranks in public places and competes in dance contests at a club called the Streets. Andie auditions for admission to the school and gets in on the good word of its star dancer, the handsome, blond Chase (Robert Hoffman), who saw her dance at the club. Andie’s commitment to her new school gets her kicked out of her old crew, but no matter. She forms a new crew with Chase, who fantasizes about winning the grand prize in a contest at the Streets.  When Andie and Chase, both of whom are white, hold forth on the values of the Streets and barge into the club demanding that its mostly nonwhite patrons give them respect and a shot at the title, the movie is writing socially aware checks that its trite, fake-inspirational story can’t cash. This willfully clueless attitude about race and class — factors examined in the recent, vastly superior “How She Move” — is irritating.  But there are saving graces, notably exuberant musical sequences (the best of which depicts couples salsa-dancing at a backyard barbecue) and a likable supporting cast, including Adam G. Sevani as Moose, a diminutive, goofy but preternaturally confident dancer who might be the baddest nerd in movie history.  “Step Up 2 the Streets” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and one violent scene.

With more dancing and less Channing Tatum than the original, "Step Up 2 the Streets" offers the illusion of edgier fare than "High School Musical," but uses much the same formula to separate youngsters from their allowance. In this contempo fairy tale, an orphan girl and her bashful love interest learn self-expression through street dancing. Rather than mixing classical and modern styles the way "Step Up" did, this hip-hop-powered sequel is all about new moves, which should keep the kids coming back after the pic's initial Valentine's Day crush.
Tomboy Andie (Briana Evigan) belongs to an elite inner-city dance crew called the 410 whose latest prank--invading a subway car posing as muggers and staging an impromptu dance show for bewildered passengers-- gets its members labeled delinquents by the Baltimore media.
Watching reports of the 410's "public disturbances" on TV that night, Andie's guardian (Sonja Sohn, pic's only connection to HBO's gritty, Baltimore-based "The Wire") threatens to send the unruly orphan to Texas. As in the first film, the wayward teen lands herself at the Maryland School of the Arts, where her street-dancing style clashes with the institution's conservative methods.
By this point, 
it's clear the strait-laced dance academy is the sequel's only tie to the original, but fans needn't take down their Tatum pinups just yet. The hunky "Step Up" star returns long enough to make auds swoon anew, challenging Andie to a dance-off. If she wins, the movie's over and everybody can go home. But if he wins, she agrees to take MSA seriously and attend classes without question.
And so Tatum reminds us why the first movie was such a runaway sensation, using trampolines to outdance the newbie. But even this display gives only the faintest indication of the incredible dancing in store. "Step Up 2" features nearly as much dancing as it does dialogue, and that's a good thing, considering the after-school special quality of its obligatory emotional scenes.
Flirtation proves most effective on the dance floor anyway, best exemplified by an otherwise throwaway scene choreographed by Jamal Sims (one of the original's few alums). The most popular kid in school, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman

), has been trying to win Andie over the entire movie, and at a friend's backyard barbecue, these two work out their connections through dance.
It's when things slow down long enough for the characters to start talking that "Step Up 2" gets itself in trouble. Pic culminates not onstage but at an underground dance competition called "the Streets," where rival crews battle it out for respect. After getting dropped from the 410, Andie allows Chase to convince her they can put their own group together, plucking misfit students from MSA and assembling the fiercest crew Baltimore has ever seen.
In order to make the ultimate showdown appropriately dramatic, the writers turn the 410 into hoodlums who play dirty, which effectively cancels the spirit of civil disobedience and independent expression the pic espoused during its opening scene, trading instead on the very stereotypes it set out to counter.
Director John M. Chu, a recent USC graduate making his feature debut, proves more than capable of handling the high-energy dance sequences, applying a few slick moves of his own behind the camera. Evigan and Hoffman, both dancers-turned-actors, come across as more natural than their more mannered co-stars, and though pic is all about grrl-power, it's Hoffman who seems poised to break out.
Additional choreographers worked to define the routines, with Nadine "Hi Hat" Ruffin handling the 410 and Dave Scott tackling the MSA group. The soundtrack (which features infectious new tracks from Flo Rida, T-Pain, Missy Elliot, Enrique Iglesias and more) looks likely to extend the movie's dance craze to the clubs. A MySpace-sponsored contest has been encouraging the group-participation spirit for months, with winners showing their best moves in the film.
