Fatih Akin, the German-born Turkish writer-director of the propulsive culture-clash drama Head-On , returns to the notion of East-meets-West with an inviting music documentary that's more about sound than sight. Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul  emphasizes the unique geography of the city to explain its eclectic music scene, and a generous sampling of performances clinches the argument. As filmmaking, the docu is only travel-diary so-so. But the chance to experience the machine-gun rhymes of ''the Turkish Eminem''  a young man called Ceza  is priceless.

 If life were fair and film exhibition better, you could watch Fatih Akin's musical mystery tour "Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul" while standing up,  or, more ideally, while swaying, spinning and shimmying. An infectiously enjoyable survey of contemporary Turkish music, the documentary works as a corollary to Mr. Akin's breakout fiction film, "Head-On." A tough-love romance about cultural identity and the sustaining joys of punk rock, that film brought Mr. Akin, a German native born to Turkish immigrants, international acclaim.  This new film feels like something of a gift, as if the director had decided to burn some of his favorite songs for his newfound friends, the world-cinema audience.  To help him with his survey, Mr. Akin, who wrote and directed the film and also served as a camera operator,  has enlisted Alexander Hacke, the bassist from the industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten. Narrating in German, the bushy-faced Mr. Hacke makes a wonderfully appealing guide, partly because he's an unabashed enthusiast, partly because he's a genuine character.  The musician is clearly following a path laid out for him by the filmmaker, whether he's conducting interviews with fellow musicians or roaming the city's atmospheric streets. Yet while the whole thing could come off as perilously twee, the artificiality of  Mr. Hacke's role and the setup (he checks into the same Istanbul hotel that the hero in "Head-On" stays in) only adds to the film's unexpected charm.  Like the characters in "Head-On," Istanbul straddles two distinct, sometimes conflicting and violently contradictory worlds. On both sides of the Bosporus strait, the city brings together the continents and cultures of Europe and Asia in a single geographically unique, heterogeneous package that clearly fascinates Mr. Akin.  "We try to be European," one musician says early in the film, "but at the same time we're open to the East."  The man's friend, seated next to him in an outdoor cafe, gently smiles at this comment, and then adds his perspective: "He who tries to be European is not European."  The musician doesn't bother to dispute this, but does contribute a rather more pragmatic final thought: "Wherever we are, we are. And that goes especially for musicians."  Although the film ranges far and wide  musically and geographically — from the tongue-trippingly fast rap of Istanbul to the soulful Romany instrumentals and haunting Kurdish dirges in outlying towns — Mr. Akin never strays far from the idea that making and, by extension, appreciating music is itself identity-forming. That point is underscored by the younger musicians in the film who consistently offer thanks to the most unlikely progenitors, including Orhan Gencebay, one of the  most famous film and music stars in Turkey. Mr. Gencebay, seated below a portrait of his younger self, his trademark mustache and dignity securely in place, strums a saz like nobody's business. Seated nearby, Mr. Hacke records this Turkish legend with the seriousness of a true believer. Though he's traveled far, he is right at home. 

One of the world's great cities comes vibrantly alive through its music and musical denizens in "Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul." Docu by Turkish-German helmer Fatih Akin (2004 Berlinale winner "Head-On") is a belated love letter to a metropolis which also reflects his own mixed-cultural make-up -- poised between East and West, with influences from both Europe and Asia. With Akin's name attached, this looks to have sizable fest legs prior to pubcaster and cable play, with minor theatrical chances in certain territories.
Alexander Hacke, longtime member of German avant-garde band Einstuerzende Neubauten, unlocks some of Istanbul's cultural secrets. Hacke recorded a few songs for Akin's partly Istanbul-set "Head-On," and the city has fascinated him ever since.
Checking into the venerable Grand Hotel de Londres in Istanbul's flavorsome Beyoglu district, Hacke first hooks up with Turkish "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula and stands in for the band's absent bassist. He then starts a musical journey through Turkish rap, experimental music, street music, Kurdish laments and even a couple of modern Whirling Dervishes.
Intercut with these encounters and jamming sessions is footage painting the city's bustling street life, both by day and by night, that avoids the normal tourist cliches. There's also some early discussion of Istanbul's unique location. But more importantly, as one observer points out, the city is also a living rebuttal of the old chestnut, "East is East, West is West, and never the twain shall meet" -- the "clash of civilizations" geopolitical theory currently revived by the White House.
Less convincing are Turkish rappers' claims that they're doing their own thing and not simply imitating black Americans. But once the docu has got such cultural matters off its chest, the music does most of the talking, culminating in two emotionally powerful sessions by legends of popular Turkish music: former matinee idol-cum-composer Orhan Gencebay and legendary songstress Sezen Aksu.
Gencebay, whose movie career is briefly shown in a series of clips from corny actioners and melodramas, gives an electric performance of one of his songs, playing his 38-year-old saz
 (a long-necked, full-bellied lute). But it's Aksu's perf of one of her '80s hits, the melancholy "Memory of Istanbul," that hits the spot -- intercut with B&W pics of period Istanbul that perfectly parallel the song's emotional content.
Tech package is smart throughout, and the musical mix (by Hacke himself) clear and sharp -- heard to most powerful effect in a barnstorming solo by Kurdish chanteuse Aynar.

The romantically nihilist heart of Head-On  fluttered to punk and Turkish folk, seemingly contradictory genres that both sang the song of amour fou . Fatih Akin 's rich documentary follow-up, Crossing the Bridge , digs deeper into Istanbul 's musical and social history. The project began when Alexander Hacke , bassist for German avant-everything band Einstürzende Neubauten , worked on Head-On 's soundtrack and was bewitched by the local sounds. The film follows him on his return trip as he records every tune he stumbles over. In briskly edited sequences peppered with fascinating found footage, each genre is tightly linked to a neighborhood. The grunge kids ape Nirvana  in gentrifying Beyoglu, hip-hop takes baby steps in quaint Kadiköy, and clarinetist Selim Sesler  drops jaws in a rural bar in Kesan. There is a general fear among the film's subjects that local traditions are dying amid the rush to modernization. This uncertainty is rendered sublime by national icon Sezen Akzu in her command performance of "Memories of Istanbul," evoking the city's rapidly disappearing past with impossibly noble resignation.
