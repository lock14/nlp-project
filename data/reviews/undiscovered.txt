The nice dude singer-songwriter in ''Undiscovered" keeps insisting that, contrary to the opinions of the girls who jump him midsong, he's not a rock star: ''I'm a musician, " he says. What's impressive about this otherwise unimpressive little movie is how it doesn't force the issue. Luke Falcon (Steven Strait) has bad hair and a worse name, and, indeed, he is not a rock star. His voice is too meek, his songs too tender, his outlook too humble. He doesn't appear to want to conquer the music business; he wants to hug.
But for a few weeks Luke's life changes. Fame knocks, although under the circumstances, he should have answered only for ''Fame." He was so much more likable before the record deal, the Brazilian model girlfriend, the online fan sites, and the Porsche
. Not because he becomes a jerk (he's too sensitive for that), but because he's just not terribly excited about success. Isn't that what he traded New York City for the dive lounges of Los Angeles to attain?
Before I get ahead of myself, ''Undiscovered" is also a romance between Luke and Briar Tucket, a model who has come to Los Angeles to make The Leap to acting and who is played by Pell James (these names!). She and Luke actually met once, briefly, on the subway in New York and now they're in LA together. Her scenemate at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute (seriously, Lee Strasberg) is also Luke's buddy. (With screenwriting like this, who needs Friendster?)
But the movie coughs up obstacles to keep them from getting too close too soon. Briar, for instance, has run away from her boyfriend, a Jagger-tastic rock star (Stephen Moyer) who'll sleep with anything. He's shown in a pool, where beautiful women circle him like a sharks. How'd a sweet girl like Briar wind up with such a pig? Yet she's fighting her attraction to Luke the earnest teddy bear, who's a bit of drama queen too. (''Newsflash," he says to her, ''You didn't hurt me. You killed me!")
Kip Pardue, as Luke's hippie brother, seems to get the joke of his character, but somehow it's never funny. Carrie Fisher shows up as Briar's agent, a woman who rightly sounds as if she's seen it all. As it stands, the movie is plain, like a pumpkin that failed to be turned into either a carriage or a jack-o'-lantern. Occasionally the moviemakers aim for cynicism about the music industry -- Fisher Stevens plays a smug A&R guy in one of the worst performances I've ever seen -- but how can we trust the movie's distrust when one of its stars is Ashlee Simpson?
Incidentally, Simpson is pretty good, playing Luke and Briar's spunky pal. But her inoffensive goodness is a symptom of the movie's relentless homogeneity. It doesn't belong at a megaplex. It should be playing on a Clear Channel station.

         A vacuous show-biz trifle (now there's a triple redundancy for you), "Undiscovered" delves into the criminally neglected world of aspiring musicians and actors trying to make their mark in Hollywood. Directed by Irishman Meiert Avis, a veteran of U2 music videos, from John Galt's script, it's a film in which coincidence and serendipity function as script doctors but to no avail.
 
  Singer-songwriter Luke Falcon (Steven Strait) glimpses Nebraska farm girl-slash-model Brier Tucket (Pell James) on the New York subway, where she picks up his dropped glove and he tosses her its mate (an apparently romantic gesture) but she's gone before he finds out so much as her name. He declares himself "smitten" to his brother Euan (Kip Pardue), but unfortunately is headed at that very moment to try his luck in L.A. and figures he will never see the lovely blond again.
 


         






    But this is a movie, after all, so in a New York minute Brier is informing her fairy god-agent Carrie (Carrie Fisher) that she's ankling the Apple for the Coast to try her hand at acting. In a class at the Strasberg Institute, Brier meets Clea (Ashlee Simpson, star of pop music and reality television), who leads her to Luke, who's become a regular at the Mint, but it's really complicated because Brier is, like, sort of dating this philandering British rock star (Stephen Moyer) and really doesn't want to getinvolved with another musi-cian.
 
  Though Luke is described as Jeff Buckley meets Elvis Costello and we see him making an aborted in-studio appearance on KCRW, his music is strictly the kind of goopy, sensitive guy stuff played by Ryan Seacrest on Star. Equally artificial, the L.A. of the movie is the neon-lighted, hipster (their word, not mine) hangout ripped from glossy magazine spreads and "Access Hollywood." HBO's "Entourage" feels like a gritty documentary by comparison.
 
  By the time Peter Weller turns up as a mythic record label exec to cleanse everyone with his philosopher-guru mantras and save everyone from sleazy A&R man Garrett Schweck (an enthusiastic Fisher Stevens), the film has more or less euthanized itself, and the audience will be wishing for the same. When the sight of a skateboarding bulldog is the most entertaining thing on the screen, you know you're in trouble.
 
  At one time called "Wannabe" — which would have been far too self-aware — "Undiscovered" is the kind of elliptical romance in which any scenes of substance (say, where the lovebirds get to know one another or have an actual conversation) have been omitted to clear space for the music video montages. In fact, the whole movie could be clipped by about 95 minutes and it would make a swell little video for Simpson's performance of the title cut from the soundtrack.

 In general release.   

 "Undiscovered," the first film by the music-video director Meiert Avis and the writer John Galt, is about young people in Los Angeles who dream of becoming famous. And since the characters are played by young people who are themselves grasping for celebrity, the picture carries more than a whiff of the self-referential. In other words, if Ashlee Simpson appears to be playing herself, she probably is.  The movie begins in New York City, where the aspiring musician Luke Falcon (played by the musician and actor Steven Strait) has a brief but heart-stopping encounter with a willowy model named Brier (Pell James). More than a year later, they reconnect in Los Angeles, where Luke is pursuing his dream of becoming a singer-songwriter. Brier, despite the misgivings of her motherly agent, Carrie (Carrie Fisher), has come up with the original idea of parlaying her runway skills into an acting career.  Though filled with romantic contrivances and overlong musical numbers, "Undiscovered" is curiously lifeless. Bland actors portray single-cell characters in a plot scarcely more diverting than Ms. Simpson's reality vehicle, "The Ashlee Simpson Show." Here, she is Clea, an acting student who sings (quite a lot, though that probably has nothing to do with the fact that Ms. Simpson's father, Joe Simpson, is one of the film's executive producers).  When not mesmerized by Luke's wayward shirts and artistic integrity, she and Brier scheme to create fake buzz for him on the Internet. This backfires, of course, and Brier is devastated. "All we tried to do was make a nice guy a rock star," she wails. That's just what men love: women trying to run their lives for them.  Ms. Simpson may be a likable lightweight in the acting department, but beside the two leads she's a veritable Dietrich. While Ms. James drifts through the movie looking like an anesthetized Gwyneth Paltrow, Mr. Strait struggles painfully to emote. He should consider taking lessons from Peter Weller, who shows up for five minutes near the end of the film to play Wick Treadway, a hotshot record producer. Even wearing dark glasses and a suspiciously immobile expression, Mr. Weller displays more natural presence than any of his young colleagues; and when he tosses in a Hemingway quote, the moment is sublime. To hear RoboCop quote Hemingway is one of those surreal cinematic pleasures that can illuminate even the dimmest movie.  "Undiscovered" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual material, including dialogue, partial nudity, language and drug content.

As a cautionary drama on the price of fame, "Undiscovered" could not tread on more exhaustively discovered territory, and the result is a reel-by-reel trail of cliches. Pretty young things -- he a solemnly serious songwriter thrust into rock stardom, and she a Gotham model-turned-wannabe thesp -- are rendered skin-deep and unable to love each other, even though everyone knows they're the perfect match. What may have been originally conceived as a significant project has ended up pallid and will quickly exit from theatrical gigs.
In an opening moment recalling "Closing Doors," model Brier (Pell James) draws songwriter Luke's (Steven Strait) attention at the door of a New York subway train, and he tosses her his winter gloves.
Soon, Luke bids farewell to his goofy musician brother Euan (Kip Pardue), and sets off to Los Angeles, where he hopes his career can be kick-started.
Meanwhile, Brier, suffering the serial infidelities of rocker b.f. Mick (Stephen Moyer), suggests a move to the City of Angeles to test her acting bug to her manager Carrie (Carrie Fisher).
All too easily, Brier lands a spot in an acting class at the Lee Strasberg Institute in L.A., scores a long-term residency at the Chateau Marmont and spots Luke gigging at the Mint. Luke even knows Brier's fellow student and new pal Clea (Ashlee Simpson). Los Angeles, as depicted in "Undiscovered," is a tiny neighborhood composed of nothing but clubs, struggling yet beautiful young people and fat-headed showbiz grownups who talk like used-car salesmen.
Latter would be record producer Garrett Schweck (Fisher Stevens), so obviously insincere and obnoxious that no real artist like Luke, described as a "combination of Jeff Buckley and Elvis Costello," would ever get within spitting distance of him.
John Galt's script is soon desperate for an angle, however, so Brier hatches a scheme to "stage" buzz for Luke. The scheme includes hiring a slinky woman (Shannyn Sossamon) to pose as a date for Luke, while Brier half-heartedly insists Luke isn't for her.
Brier's feelings have something to do with no longer trusting musicians, but nobody believes it, and neither will viewers, who will see the creaky drama's roller-coaster patterns of fame and betrayal and self-renewal long before they happen.
Musicvid director Meiert Avis works best arranging solid musical performances (especially for Strait), but appears lost as a helmer of narrative cinema.
All the weight is on Strait and James, who both look fine and seem to feel comfortable as leads, but who can't find the emotional range needed to humanize their stereotyped roles. James' character is especially weak, since once Brier is introduced and set up, she has little to do in a story that's all about Strait's Luke.
Stevens, Fisher and Peter Weller -- in a curious role in which he must misquote Hemingway and make it sound believable -- play their various, long-maintained personae by rote, making this sketch of Hollywood seem even more fake.
Postcard glimpses of Los Angeles, as seen through Danny Hiele's jittery rack-focus lensing, lend the impression the filmmakers lack understanding of a town depicted here as a glittery hell-hole. Strait and Simpson, who holds her own as an actor, share some warm moments in front of the mic, though why David Baerwald's score dips into Nino Rota-like riffs is anyone's guess.

A PG-13 dramedy set in L.A. about some attractive, way-too-earnest aspiring stars has the potential to be a delectable good-bad favorite, but Undiscovered  is nowhere near the guilty pleasure it could have been. One, Ashlee Simpson  is no Britney. Two, she's not even the star in her own star vehicle. Instead, the spotlight is on a love affair between a bland version of Kelly from 90210  (Pell James ) and an unfortunately ponytailed musician (Steven Strait ), facing the ups and downs of burgeoning fame. These guys give us nothing to work withno priceless cheesy lines, no shocking scandals, not even a steamy sex scenejust two tortured artists passing up a chance to get laid. Their friend, Simpson's vaguely cute Clea, while not quite pulling off the hipster-cool chick she's supposed to be (who did  choose those outfits?), is a relief from the couple's Dawson's Creek   banter. Above all, Undiscovered  makes poor Ash the latest example of a fascinating paradox: jack-of-all-trades celebrities who are famous for no good reason.
