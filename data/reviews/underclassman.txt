Let�s make something clear: I like Nick Cannon. And when a person is basically given the keys to a Miramax production � Cannon is the star, executive producer, and story writer here � I can certainly understand the temptation to gad about onscreen: riding ATVs and Sea-Doos (no "jet skis" � these are Sea-Doo brand Sea-Doos), romancing Rush Hour 2
 hottie Sanchez, shooting endless scenes of rugby and paintball, and basically making as little of a movie as possible. Underclassman
 was probably a gas to film. Watching it, on the other hand, is like sitting in afterschool detention. Cannon plays a smart-aleck LAPD bicycle cop, a rookie on the force. You will not be surprised to learn that he�s always getting in over his head, that he�s always aggravating his captain (Marin), that he�s going to be asked at some point to hand in his badge and forget about the case, which of course he won�t do because he�s got a hunch that could blow this thing wide open, and the detectives properly assigned to the task are bumbling nimrods. An interracial-buddy element develops. A stuffy British guy might or might not be the villain. Five people � counting Cannon � collaborated on this story and the script, yet the movie seems to have been generated from a batch file. Here�s the cutline: Cannon goes undercover with rich, white party kids at a prep school to catch a killer. Cannon is charming enough to float some edgy jokes at Biff and Muffy and the West Side Kids ("Y�all beat me so bad I thought I was going to have to call Al Sharpton, get him to organize a march," he quips after the rugby game), and maybe there�s something to be said for that. Perhaps years from now graduate students will defend Cannon�s work here as a modern interpretation of trickster lore; maybe they�ll call it subversive and brilliant. Until then the movie feels a lot like Guess Who�s Coming to The OC With a Lethal Weapon 2?
 except that Adam Brody has been replaced by Johnny K. Lewis (of MTV�s Undressed
), who has a Clay Aikeny kind of thing going on. Its star, who injected such life into the surprisingly unformulaic Drumline
, is adrift in a sea of cop-movie clich�s, and Siega�s party-to-go direction hews more closely to his music-video beginnings than to his critically noted Pretty Persuasion
.


The new Nick Cannon comedy, ''Underclassman," is rated PG-13, but that puts an awfully large slice of America at risk of actually seeing the thing. Let me float the suggestion that it be rated PG-13-only
, since anyone older than that will quickly realize he or she has better things to do than attend this pitiful ''Beverly Hills Cop" retread.
''Underclassman" is saved from total puff only by the obnoxiousness of its star, who seems to be laboring under the delusion that he's the next Eddie Murphy. He is -- how to put this kindly? -- not even a third-string Wayans brother. As Tracy Stokes, a Venice Beach bicycle cop who aches to prove he can bring down the bad guys, Cannon (''Drumline") preens and wisecracks with a maximum of sass and nothing that remotely resembles charm. In LAPD parlance, the kid has no backup.
But there's trouble at Westbury High: A reporter for the student newspaper has been murdered, and a young detective is needed to go undercover. The dropout son of a legendary cop, Tracy pleads his case to Lieutenant Delgado (Cheech Marin, looking in vain for an off-screen bong to ease the pain) and is soon the new kid in the halls.
Westbury High is one of those typical private schools where all the kids drive high-end cars and speak impeccable rap; the principal is a poncy Brit, and the impossibly hot Spanish teacher, Ms. Lopez (Roselyn Sanchez), wears belly shirts to class. Tracy decides to fit in by acting as outrageously as possible, and we're invited to take this as solid if overenthusiastic police tactics.
Befriending poor little rich kid Rob (played with exactly one facial expression by Shawn Ashmore, an actor who looks intriguingly like an adolescent George W. Bush), Tracy uncovers a carjacking ring, romances Ms. Lopez (''you're the most gangsta teacher I ever had"), and continually howls in delight at his own lack of wit. The film matches him stride for stride, reaching its nadir when a fellow cop is stuck in a bush ''dropping a deuce" while the bad guys get away in a Corvette. Not to worry, Tracy can catch up to them -- on foot.
Cobbled together from the body parts of a hundred better movies, ''Underclassman" ends with the hero temporarily kicked off the force but still managing to save his Spanish teacher from the clutches of the surprise villain (hint: he has a British accent). By this point, even reasonably sentient teenagers in the audience will have bailed and sneaked into ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin" in the next theater. Or ''Valiant." Or Ingmar Bergman's ''Saraband." Anything
.
Another cinematic lemon orphaned by the Miramax breakup, ''Underclassman" has been sitting on the shelf so long that it's opening the same day as director Marcos Siega's next movie, ''Pretty Persuasion," a comparatively ambitious black-comedy attempt to court the ''Heathers" crowd. The earlier movie is thus like a dorky high school photo that some prankster has pinned to the front door of a college dorm -- Siega must be looking at it and blushing with chagrin. If he's not, he sure as hell should be.

         A likably brash Nick Cannon stars in the routine "Underclassman" as a free-spirited Venice Beach bicycle cop who gets his long-sought chance to make detective when his captain (Cheech Marin) reluctantly agrees to let him pose as a student at a posh Westside prep school to investigate a murder. In the process Cannon discovers the merit of buckling down and getting a diploma and suspects that a popular student (Shawn Ashmore), with whom he strikes up a friendship, knows more than he's willing to reveal.
 
  Marcos Siega's direction is well-paced, but writers David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg haven't brought anything sufficiently fresh or original to a formula plot to allow "Underclassman" to rise above the level of a mildly diverting video rental.
 


         






   "Underclassman,"
 PG-13 for violence, sexual references, drug material and some teen drinking. Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes. In general release.
 
 
 
  'Eternal' has fangs but no real teeth
 
 
Wilhelm Liebenberg and Federico Sanchez's "Eternal" is a lush-looking but laughable lesbian vampire movie. It seems that 16th century Hungarian countess Erszebet Bathory, credited with torturing and killing about 650 women, inspired the legend that she was a vampire whose bloodlust preserved her youth and beauty. As Elizabeth Kane (stunning Caroline Néron), she turns up in a secluded Montreal mansion where via the Internet she lures her victims, including Irina (Victoria Sanchez), the bi-curious wife of foul-mouthed, tiresomely macho vice detective Raymond Pope (Conrad Pla), who soon comes calling in search of his missing wife. (Elizabeth's victims don't turn into vampires but simply wind up dead.)
 
  Raymond, who indulges in kinky sex with his partner's wife (Ilona Elkin), begins a cat-and-mouse parrying with the enigmatic and seductive Elizabeth that leads to a lurid bloodbath orgy at her Venetian palazzo. That the acting is stilted and that the filmmakers and especially Pla take themselves so seriously serves to make "Eternal" deliriously silly camp fare.
 
 "Eternal,"
 Unrated. Nudity, strong sexuality and language, lurid vampire bloodlust, violence. Running time: 1 hour, 48 minutes. Exclusively at the Regent Showcase, 614 N. La Brea Ave., L.A., (323) 934-2944.   

The loserville teen comedy Underclassman  is like a student project sloppily cribbed from other kids' notes  kids who have seen Rush Hour  and still can't get over how funny it is to stick a noisy black guy in a distinctly nonblack setting. Imagine a mouthy bicycle cop called Tre (Drumline 's Nick Cannon, a bantamweight Chris Tucker) who goes undercover in a snooty white L.A. prep school to bust a case involving drugs, car theft, murder, and basketball rivalry. (Don't question why a brother who dropped out of high school gets the gig.) Imagine Tre's captain is a blustering Cheech Marin, and that no possible lame joke is left unspoken so long as it involves blacks, Hispanics, whites who can't speak proper hip-hop, and a fat cop preoccupied with his own bowel movements.
Imagine the poor grade Underclassman will receive. The movie also features a foxy-chica  teacher (Roselyn Sanchez of...Rush Hour 2 !), who inspires Tre to study, and who is charmed when he hits on her. That this is director Marcos Siega's second toxic high school fable to be released following August's Pretty Persuasion  is reason to wonder what bad things happened to him back in study hall.

 The latest bit of damaged goods offered up in the Miramax clearance sale, "Underclassman" plays like the longest episode of "21 Jump Street" ever made. It seems to have been conceived to help its star, Nick Cannon, make the transition from television tweener heartthrob to big-screen action hero. Mr. Cannon, whose idea the whole thing apparently was, has a loose, quick-talking charm - he was delightful in Charles Stone III's "Drumline" - but in this picture he tries on a series of secondhand movie star identities, trying so hard to be the next Will Smith or Eddie Murphy that his own personality all but dissolves.  The movie itself, directed by Marcos Siega from a script by Brent Goldberg and David T. Wagner, is a grinding hodgepodge of threadbare ideas. Even the songs on the soundtrack are out of date, and the picture seems unsure whether it wants to be a kid-friendly comedy or a rough-and-tumble PG-13 cop thriller.  Mr. Cannon plays Tracy (Tre) Stokes, a third-generation Los Angeles police officer who dreams of being an undercover detective but who mostly works beachfront bike patrol. Tre's improvisational approach to law enforcement annoys his grouchy, avuncular commanding officer (Cheech Marin), though not nearly so much as Mr. Cannon's lame one-liners are likely to annoy the audience. In any case, Tre's big chance comes when a student journalist at a fancy West Side private school is murdered, requiring an undercover investigation of the car-stealing and drug-dealing operation that is apparently infesting the school. So Tre talks his way into a group of campus alpha males (led by Shawn Ashmore) and does a bit of sleuthing. He also plays some basketball, indulges in some class clowning and develops a crush on a pretty Spanish teacher (Roselyn Sanchez).  There are a few halfhearted attempts to turn race and class into comedy, including one of the least convincing variations on the white suburban wannabe-black teenager ever committed to film. Apparently the spectacle of pale-skinned folk mangling hip-hop slang is endlessly funny - or at least easy. Fo-shizzle.  The picture's swerve toward equally unimaginative car chases and plot twists comes as something of a relief, though not as much as the sight of the end credits.  "Underclassman" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence, profanity and drug-related plot elements.

A rookie police officer goes back to high school and stumbles on murder, corruption and some awfully boneheaded plot twists in the low-IQ action comedy "Underclassman." So far-fetched as to make "Kindergarten Cop" look comparatively austere, and further hampered by its obnoxious motormouth of a protag, this late summer entry from Miramax should be expelled from theaters in a short order.
The appealing Nick Cannon (of "Drumline" and MTV's improv-comedy series "Wild 'N Out") is given little opportunity to show off his appeal in the role of baby-faced LAPD officer Tracy "Tre" Stokes. An impulsive man of action, Tre has "good instincts" for a cop, but too often pursues those instincts at the reckless expense of orders from detectives (played by Kelly Hu and Ian Gomez) or his curmudgeonly superior, Capt. Delgado (Cheech Marin, whose discomfort with the material is palpable).
Not long after Delgado issues him a stern warning ("You've got a long way to go before you become as good a detective as your father was"), Tre talks his way into a dangerous undercover assignment investigating the mysterious death of a student at a prep school. Why someone so irresponsible and inexperienced would be entrusted with such a sensitive operation is only one of many unanswered questions provoked by David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg's script.
Forced to masquerade as a student, Tre must cope with the predictable indignities of the school dress code, a sneering headmaster (Hugh Bonneville), and -- as he never passes up an opportunity to vocalize -- the visible difference between the school's mostly lily-white population and an undercover brother like himself.
Dripping with attitude and stereotypical indignation, Tre shoots off one execrable racial quip after another ("Y'all need some color on the court!" he says, trying to ingratiate himself into a basketball game), most of which are met, appropriately, with stony silence. Character's behavior is no doubt intended to convey some sort of loud-mouthed, anarchic charm, but all it does is point up what a lousy fit he is for this line of work: He's about as undercover as Chris Rock.
After much effort, Tre befriends a popular student named Rob Donovan (Shawn Ashmore, the "X-Men" movies). Rob may or may not be linked to the slain youth, who had been writing several investigative pieces for the school newspaper. Escalating complications -- a drug racket, an ex-student with a grudge against Rob and the theft of several expensive cars from the surrounding neighborhood -- keep Tre busy, but not too busy to hit on his dishy Spanish teacher (Roselyn Sanchez).
Buried somewhere between all the flirting and gunplay is a nice lesson about staying in school and applying yourself, but otherwise, rarely has a film seemed more indifferent to what goes on in the classroom. Instead, pic projects a loopy, borderline-irresponsible vision of high school. Parents, to say the least, are nonexistent.
Displaying an obvious lack of confidence in his audience's attention spans, helmer Marcos Siega (whose background is in musicvideos and commercials) piles on the set pieces -- not only basketball games but a rugby match, a jet-ski race and even a paintball tournament -- which are smashingly orchestrated but have little narrative relevance. Elsewhere, violence of the action seems to rise in inverse proportion to the story's plausibility.

Nope! I'm sorry, this won't donot the murder-drug-bust plot, not the criminally pabulum high school "antics," not even Tracy "Tre" Stokes, the spunky bike cop turned undercover high schooler played by Nick Cannon . And really, Cannon's damn lucky this 95-minute flick's got 85 minutes of extreme-sports sequences; otherwise he may have had to do more than sleep through his character's trouble-with-authority pageantry. "Critics just don't understand," boy genius might plead, but no, we do, actually: British bliss czars, the doughnut-loving LAPD , and bitchin'-hot Spanish profs, no matter how many, how fat, or how bitchin' hot, can't make up for easy double entendres and zero character development.
