 Brisk pacing and an excellent cast of mostly B-list actors can’t make up for the commonplace premise and execution of Simon Brand’s twisty thriller “Unknown.” Borrowing conceptually from “Reservoir Dogs,” the “Saw” series and too many others to mention, the film locks five men — played by Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Sisto — inside a dingy warehouse, where they regain consciousness following mysterious blackouts.  With no recollection of who they are, how they got there or who’s responsible for their various states of injury, the nameless characters gang up against one another, act tough (something the seriously miscast Mr. Kinnear cannot pull off) and engage in endless macho banter while attempting to assemble the pieces.  Memory flashes, awkwardly set off by mirrors, along with outside scenes depicting a woman and the police seemingly working together to ransom her wealthy husband, suggest they are somehow involved in a kidnapping gone horribly awry.  A drawn-out game of cat and mouse, the film waits as long as possible to reveal the identities of the victims and the perpetrators. And after a whole lot of buildup, and a real letdown of a payoff, the only enigma left is why we should care.
The nifty premise owes a large debt to Memento  and The Usual Suspects , but first-time screenwriter Matthew Waynee  and music video/commercial director Simon Brand  will need more experience before achieving the atmospheric intensity or narrative dexterity of those films. Five battered and bruised men wake up in a locked warehouse, unable to recall who they are or how they got there. Fragmentary memories and a two-day-old newspaper suggest the men were all part of a kidnappingbut fail to indicate on which side of the crime each one stands. The pacing is slightly off, with the action switching between the imprisoned men and the police who are trying to find them, and what should be a mounting sense of urgency inside the warehouse (think Reservoir Dogs ) falters and goes slack.
