 The loss of two women sparks an unlikely bond between strangers in “Looking for Kitty,” the writer-director-actor Edward Burns’s latest exercise in maleness. Abe (David Krumholtz, who is first-rate), an impossibly rigid but kindhearted high school baseball coach from upstate, travels to Manhattan in search of his wife, who may or may not be shacking up with a geeky rock star. He hires Jack (Mr. Burns), a disgruntled cop turned private investigator whose wife recently died, to find out, and pays extra to tag along.  Even by Burns standards (he’s still best known for his charmingly unpolished 1995 debut, “The Brothers McMullen”), this is a modest film on various levels, in terms of budget, length, cast size and technical craft. Though passable at best, the digital camerawork does aptly convey the bleakness of the city’s sidewalks and streets during winter.  Despite a few too many forced moments involving a potential romance between Jack and a generically blond neighbor, and an overkill of political jabs (however deserved) at the current White House and the high-rise developers of New York City, the central friendship that develops between Abe and Jack feels as authentic as the film’s locations (a specialty of Mr. Burns). And the emotions drawn from their interactions should resonate with anyone who’s ever dealt with extreme loneliness or the slow, painful process of letting go.  “Looking for Kitty” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and some very slight sexual references.
Clearly, Ed Burns  feels he has something to say about working-class New York Irish guys and their beery romantic problems, but after seven low-budget, Woody Allen on-Guinness projects I'll be goddamned if I know what that is. The sixth, in limbo for over two years, Looking for Kitty  is actually the most bearable indulgence from the Burns oeuvre yet, thanks largely to a narrowing of the fieldno overlay of thin story threads, just a simple investigative trajectory with two fellas talkingand the presence of David Krumholtz  as a rejected husband in search of an errant wife with Burns's tetchy PI. An underappreciated but busy local boy with a scientist's eye for semi-disclosed behavior, Krumholtz gives even Burns's 2-D dialogue an emotional life; his Abe is an obsessive high school baseball coach in perpetual self-sell, wounded but frisky and thoroughly trained in everyjock congeniality. It might be the most maturely conceived role in Burns's films, but the plot around it is flimsy, the visual storytelling simpleminded, and the general ideas for character one-note. At 78 minutes, the movie says howdy, rewards little, and does not test its welcome.
