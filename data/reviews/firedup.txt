In the interest of upping my national profile as a writer, I hereby present my first attempt at quotable movie criticism (Sony Pictures International, feel free to reprint this on any of your posters or billboards): �If you loved Wedding Crashers
, then you�ll absolutely, positively kind of like Fired Up
.� OK, I admit it may lack the primal force of a �laugh-out-loud funny!� or the poetry of an �edge-of-your-seat entertainment!� but I think there�s something there. The only problem is that the sentiment isn�t completely right. What it should probably say is, �If you loved Wedding Crashers
, then, for all intents and purposes, you�ve already seen Fired Up
� � because this new movie borrows from the 2005 Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson hit with such utter shamelessness, you have to wonder if royalty checks are already in the mail. Here�s the recipe: Take two best friends, one laid-back and charming (D�Agosto), the other smarmy and verbose (Olsen). Show them, in extended montage sequences, to be the unrepentant, unremitting Lotharios of their social sphere (in this case, high school), bedding women with ease and moving on without a hint of conscience, remorse, or romantic sentiment. Plop them into an unfamiliar social setting they believe will be beneficial to their lives as belt-notching philanderers (say, cheerleading camp). Have the laid-back one fall in love, against his better judgment, with a beautiful and decent woman (cheer captain Roemer) who has an absurdly obnoxious and wealthy boyfriend who wears sweaters tied around his neck and calls people �bro." The smarmy one, meanwhile, should lecture the laid-back one about the dangers of falling in love while finding himself agitated by a gay stereotype or two. Stir in scatology, snarky observations, and a few dozen pop-culture references that pass for jokes; mix well with life lessons and some low-grade existential collapse; and voil�!: a movie. Actually, Fired Up
 isn�t really a movie at all; it�s just the residue from assembly lines churning out copies of copies of once-successful formulas in the hopes that one in 100 touches a cultural nerve. In fact, if there�s anything notable about Fired Up
 at all, it�s that it somehow manages to be a sex comedy that�s both sexist and prudish. It not only paints all women as hopeless dimwits just waiting to be duped into bed by the first sleazeball who comes along; it follows all their painfully awkward seduction scenes with absolutely zero nudity, robbing an entire generation of kids of the only reason to sit through movies like this in the first place. It�s the same reason why my friends and I suffered through Porky�s
 and Hot Dog � The Movie
 20 years ago, and why underage teenagers now creeping into adulthood lied, cheated, stole, cajoled, and coerced their way into Wedding Crashers
 back when George W. Bush was president and the world was still young and horny.

It's worth noting that the movie about two dudes who ditch football camp to crash an Illinois camp for competitive cheerleading knows it's dumb. It just doesn't know how dumb it wants to be.
An incomplete sendup of sports movies, a half-hearted spoof of teen hormones, a straight (though not thoroughly heterosexual) romantic comedy, "Fired Up!" sends Shawn and Nick to ogle and seduce as many nubile tumblers as they can handle (everybody talks nasty, but no nasty ever gets done).
The jokes aren't all terrible. They build over the basic premise like mildew; after a while only a good bathroom cleaner can cut through all the bad gags. The dialogue feels piped in from a Twitter proverb feed ("To win the biscuit you have to risk it") and the succession of broad, slack scenes suggests yet another movie made of bloopers and outtakes. Anyone who's seen a good cheer routine should wonder how these teams would ever make it to nationals. "Fired Up" feels like everybody's first time doing anything  - writing, acting, directing, cheerleading.
A sports farce like "Caddy-shack"  - eons ago, I know, but what's there been since? "Caddyshack 2"?  - knew what it found funny about golf and country clubs. What's "Fired Up!" laughing at? It's actually not cheerleading. Sexuality is the target for most of the gags. But those never come into any comedic focus. Gay panic, for instance, always appears on the verge of breaking out. (Men hit on Shawn about three times.) But the movie doesn't have the fortitude to flip this tired plot over. What didn't work in the cheerleading comedy "Bring It On" (low-key social commentary) or the gymnastics melodramedy "Stick It" (emotional sincerity), doesn't work here, either.
Truly entertaining vulgarity never happens. The movie has no comic or hormonal sensibility of its own  - every feeling in "Fired Up!" feels borrowed from another comedy, television show, or pop song. At best, it's a movie with the generic arc and canned personalities of MTV's self-help reality ("I Want to Be a Cheerleader"). What it needs is a devilish director  - a recent graduate from the John Waters Outlandishness Academy. Or it needs the devil himself to put some camp in this camp. Sign me up for "Friday the 13th: Jason Joins the Spirit Squad."

Two piggish high school football jocks pack themselves off to cheerleader camp, where they cut a swath through the hardbodied gymnastic lovelies. The teensploitation premise is like something a porn filmmaker from the '70s might have come up with. But Fired Up! has one added quirk: The script, credited to Freedom Jones, is a riot of tongue-twisting ironic sleaze — it sounds like the first (and last) collaboration between Diablo Cody and Artie Lange. Olsen, who's like a blond Jim Morrison, and D'Agosto, as scampish as he was glum  in Rocket Science, establish an interplay that's halfway amusing and terminally smug.
 At once funnier than it should be and more witless than it should have been, “Fired Up!” is the latest addition to the wave of cheerleader movies that first hit way back in 2000 with “Bring It On.” Although the deeper reasons for this sub-genre’s new popularity remain obscure — a character in “Fired Up!” does mention that George W. Bush was a cheerleader before he was president — it’s clear that the spectacle of flexible and lithe young female hardbodies stretching and jumping and bending over to salute the camera with their derrières constitutes its own rationale, particularly when a studio is in the stupid business.  Hence “Fired Up!,” a kind of dumb but also kind of smart-about-being-dumb comedy centered on two teenage horndogs on full sniff at a cheerleading camp. Football players and best friends, Shawn (Nicholas D’Agosto) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen), both of whom look well north of 20, join their school’s cheerleading squad in order to spend part of their summer at a camp surrounded by little ladies  in tiny tops and micro shorts. Though the boys are in it for the honeys, the story gets sticky when Shawn develops a crush on the squad’s leader, Carly (Sarah Roemer), a predictable turnabout that allows the filmmakers to indulge in all sorts of ha-ha sexist blather and high jinks before Mr. Porky makes way for Mr. Sensitivity.  The director, Will Gluck, making his feature debut, hasn’t a clue where to put the camera, but he gives the pop-culturally savvy lines rhythm and zing. “You know what John Lennon said,” one teenager says in a typical exchange. “Not really,” says the other, “I’m not in my 50s.”  Someone behind the scenes here appears to have ambition, at least on the page: the script also includes an out-of-context and -character riff pegged to Hepburn and Tracy, which suggests that the anonymous screenwriters, working under the team name Freedom Jones, are taking a few cues from that screwball postmodernist Diablo Cody. (A clip from “On the Waterfront,” by contrast, seems like a bid to prove that the filmmakers aren’t as shallow as their movie.)  Still, no matter how meta and self-consciously knowing, teen  comedies like “Fired Up!” are basically just recycling the same jokes, plots and mating rituals that fueled the Frankie and Annette beach party flicks of the 1960s. These new parties tend to be racier, of course, but they nonetheless boil down to a scantily clad boy going gaga over a scantily clad girl amid the usual cacophony of thudding music, a phalanx of adolescent wisenheimers and at least one wacky, sexually ambiguous authority figure. Paul Lynde took on that role, if without much ambiguity, in the 1965 Frankie and Annette romp “Beach Blanket Bingo,” and here John Michael Higgins does same as Coach Keith, pompom royalty.  “Fired Up!” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Double-entendres and triple-time raunch.

Getting high and mighty on teen-sex comedies is a sucker's game, but it's worth noting how particularly abhorrent a movie like Fired Up  is. Not content to be just another dumb high school flick, it's actually teaching young, virginal viewers to treat women like stupid, submissive slut-cattle for the rest of their lives. Bored of banging every last chick in school, horny football studs Shawn (Nicholas D'Agosto ) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen ) ditch their team for a couple weeks of cheer camp, where they will be the only straight dudes in a sea of 600 tits, er . . . 300 cheerleaders. They're basically the same insipid conquistador, except Nick is the more officious schemer and Shawn is the science whiz who helps all the (brainless) girls with their homework. Learning a few cheers, but never punished for their piggish insolence (the third-act inspirational speech, literally: "Be a cocky asshole"), Nick eventually wins over an older coach (Molly Sims ) with his secret poetry, and Shawn falls in love with squad leader Carly (Sarah Roemer ) because she's the only girl who didn't want to whore around on first sight. We're light years away from Animal House , sure, but who ever thought we would long for the richer, funnier dignity of American Pie ?
