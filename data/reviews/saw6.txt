The Saw  series long ago cannibalized its cleverest bloodbath gimmicks, but now it's figured out a new way to torture us: by taking a barb-wire stab at political relevance. In the opening sequence of Saw VI , two parasitical bureaucrats of the pre-crash American economy  the implication is that they're subprime mortgage vendors  pay for their sins, and compete for survival, by seeing which one can lop off a weightier portion of body parts before a timer runs out. The pudgy white guy saws away at his belly fat, but the fierce black woman is way ahead of him  she grabs a butcher knife and hacks, hacks, hacks  off her forearm, easily outdoing his measly pound of flesh. The fact that each one makes the choice  to suffer (rather than die) is the key to the sadomasochistic appeal of the Saw  films. The characters' effective collaboration in the series' pain games plays as a metaphor for those of us in the audience, who have all made the choice to get off on these mutilation-porn theatrics.
John Cramer (Tobin Bell), the Jigsaw puppeteer and twinkly-eyed sadist-mechanic-ringleader of the Saw  series, was killed off several installments ago, but thanks to the miracle of pre-taped torture-play instructions, he seems busier in death than he ever was in life. His mission in Saw VI  is to teach a lesson to William (Peter Outerbridge), the CEO of a health-insurance company who hides his lust for profit behind a welter of fake smiles and byzantine actuarial data. It's fine that the producers of the series have come up with some topical bad guys, but I'd be remiss in my duty as a critic if I didn’t write the following sentence: The trouble with Saw VI  is that it never devises cool enough ways to torture people. Where are the baroquely jaw-dropping (if not jaw-snapping) De Sadean Rube Goldberg contraptions? At one point, the CEO has to decide which of his six underlings, all strapped to a carousel, will live or die (the game is supposed to reveal to him that in his insurance work, he's really playing God), but since we don't give a hoot about any of them, and the method of death is unremarkable, the sequence is a dud.
So is the rest of the movie. Saw VI  is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw  films. It's the first one that's more or less consumed by backstory  which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks. If your goal is to do a quick study for a round of Saw  Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time.

Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with "Saw VI," a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called "Saw It Already." At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition, whose grotesque punishments extend even to a man guilty of (horrors!) cigarette smoking. Serial not only in terms of killing, the "Saw" franchise has essentially become a gory soap opera, its die-hard viewership addicted to following the entangled narrative viscera of Jill (Betsy Russell), Det. Lt. Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and, of course, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell).
Deceased since "III" but still calling the shots from beyond the grave, the diabolically vengeful Jigsaw, aka John, is given an added grudge in "VI," as flashbacks show he was threatened with the cancellation of his health insurance. (Not even mass murderers are immune to HMOs.)
That explains the viciously elaborate series of traps set for Umbrella Health executive William (Peter Outerbridge), who's forced to feel the gravity of choosing one patient's life over another's. The pic's most memorably gruesome contraption is a spinning carousel with half a dozen of the executive's colleagues on it; of those, only two are permitted to escape death by shotgun blast.
Other arguably deserving victims in this most topical of "Saw" sequels include a pair of predatory lenders forced to sever their own body parts and weigh them on a scale. As crudely fixated on ultraviolent vigilante justice as anything in the series (the proverbial "pound of flesh" is made literal here), this sequence begins the movie on an aptly torturous note.
Key revelations in "VI" include the contents of the box Jigsaw willed to his widow, Jill -- who, in an obvious lead-in to the seventh installment, appears to be vying with Hoffman for the right to carry out the dead killer's sick bidding from here. Meantime, Hoffman's attempt to pin all post-Jigsaw murders on the late Peter Strahm -- crushed to death in a giant trash compactor at the end of "V" -- isn't working for the newly healed and still-vigilant Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis).
As Jigsaw's kindred victim-turned-vindicator, Mandylor has significantly less screen time than he did in the talky "V," which benefits the new movie considerably. Flashbacks allow Shawnee Smith to reprise her role as Jigsaw accomplice Amanda, but the new performance is a cut below her surgical work in "III."
Russell doesn't do much but prepare to accept a larger part in "VII." Bell might appear to be tiring of Jigsaw, though it's hard to tell, since the film's flashbacks center on the psycho's cancerous final days.
Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous "Saw" pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best -- "downright slick," as Jigsaw would say.
Still, whatever technical improvements "Saw VI" makes on earlier entries can only be seen as marginal in the context of a series that remains as revolting as its fans would seem to insist.
