         In Josh Sternfeld's understated "Winter Solstice," the absence of a wife and mother in a family household is palpable. Long before Sternfeld lets his audience know the woman did in fact die in a car accident, it is clear that Anthony LaPaglia's Jim Winters, a New Jersey landscape architect, is a widower and not a divorcé. Well before Jim angrily reminds his older son, Gabe (Aaron Stanford), how hard he has worked to hold his family together, his efforts are abundantly clear.
 
  Although the Winters' home, an attractive vintage frame house in an upscale suburb, is well maintained, it's a little drab — in a subtle way that characterizes the entire film — there's a suggestion that a woman's touch is lacking. What is also lacking in the Winters household is communication.
 


         






    A stocky, solid-looking man in early middle age, Jim clearly loves his two sons but hasn't a clue how to express it — or how to get them to be open with him in return.
 
  Gabe, the responsible type, is working overtime at his warehouse job to save money to go to Florida, where a friend can get him a job on a boat. Pete (Mark Webber) is bright but a terrible student who for the second time has been told he must go to summer school to make up some classes.
 
  Jim is sustained by his love for his work and his sense of obligation to his sons. Gabe wants only to escape, while Pete is sinking into aimlessness. The Winters family is steeped in long-standing sadness, and "Winter Solstice" covers several months in their lives.
 
  As spring arrives, there is the inkling that the family, each member in his own manner, may be beginning to find a way of working past the grief.
 
  Sternfeld's approach is rigorously minimalist, which is a plus since the Winters family is in no way extraordinary or distinctive. Since their community is clearly pricey, however, it defies credibility in an otherwise persuasive drama that college never seems to come up.
 
  "Winter Solstice" is a graceful ensemble piece with effective performances from the entire cast, which includes the always wonderful Allison Janney as a single woman new to the neighborhood, Michelle Monaghan as the girl Gabe is preparing to leave behind and Ron Livingston as a self-possessed and imaginative history teacher with whom Pete might just connect. "Winter Solstice" is a film not of conclusions but of awakened possibilities.

In Winter Solstice , writer- director Josh Sternfeld takes the prefab indie-flick building blocks  uncommunicative families, impacted grief, and suburban stagnation  and constructs something quite marvelous: a realistic drama that looks and feels as inevitably true and moving as a good documentary. Understatement is Sternfeld's strength: Assembling muted vignettes about a bewildered New Jersey widower (Anthony LaPaglia), his two dammed-up teenage sons (Tadpole 's Aaron Stanford and Storytelling 's Mark Webber, both outstanding), and a neighbor (Allison Janney) who offers sunshine, the filmmaker is at his finest when he employs silence and inaction. What doesn't happen is more moving than what does.

inter Solstice" is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its gentle, understated power or quietly bore them out of their skulls. Like its protagonist, a taciturn New Jersey widower named Jim Winters (Anthony LaPaglia), the film plays its cards close to its vest. As a measure of the movie's restraint, it's not until two-thirds of the way through its running time that we learn how and when Jim's wife died (in a car accident, five years before the film begins). By that point, though, an attentive viewer will have gathered everything he needs to know from the movie's richly detailed context. A moderately successful landscape gardener in an idyllic suburb, Jim has two teenage sons, Gabe (Aaron Stanford) and Pete (Mark Webber). The younger of the two, Pete, is a rebellious underachiever, desultorily attending summer school and picking fights in convenience-store parking lots. Gabe has a steady job and a devoted girlfriend (Michelle Monaghan), but his apparent calm masks a bone-deep sadness. The father sips coffee and broods at the kitchen table; the boys shoot hoops and scuffle in front of the television. And that's pretty much it - until a newly arrived neighbor named Molly Ripken (Allison Janney) invites the Winters family over for dinner, upsetting the fragile equilibrium of their bachelor household. The boys, particularly Mr. Webber as Pete, are astonishingly good, and Ms. Monaghan, who looks like a slightly more tomboyish Liv Tyler, makes a deep impression in a minor role. Mr. LaPaglia, of the television series "Without a Trace," brings a tender gravity to the shell-shocked Jim. But Ms. Janney is an actress so indelibly associated with her role on "The West Wing" that she may never be able to escape its shadow. I don't even watch "The West Wing," and I kept expecting her to stride in with a white paper on defense spending and slam it down on Mr. LaPaglia's desk. It doesn't help that Ms. Janney's character is the least developed in the movie; though her back story is briefly sketched in, she serves mainly as a plot device in what is ultimately a film about masculinity and its discontents. "Winter Solstice" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and some mild violence.

A minor-key drama about loss, adjustment and the fragile yet enduring bonds of family, "Winter Solstice" represents an accomplished debut for writer-director Josh Sternfeld, a New York U. Graduate Film Program alumnus. Story of a still-grieving widower and his two troubled teenage sons is distinguished by its emotional integrity, sustained mood of aching melancholy and superbly understated performances. The television popularity of thesps Anthony LaPaglia and Allison Janney should help secure a theatrical sale for this unsentimental yet moving indie feature.
Developed at the 2001 Sundance Institute Screenwriters Lab, Sternfeld's debut on paper recalls any number of intimate dramas that surface each year in Park City. But like Karen Moncrieff's "Blue Car" from 2002, this is a superior example, showcasing a director with a gift for sensitive observation and narrative economy, a pleasing sense of composition and a strong guiding hand with the ensemble cast.
Jim Winters (LaPaglia) is a landscape gardener living with his sons Gabe (Aaron Stanford) and Pete (Mark Webber) in leafy New Jersey suburbia. While no direct reference is made to Jim's wife or her death in an accident five years earlier until more than an hour into the movie, the unspoken weight of her absence is as palpable a character as anyone else on screen.
Jim declines friendly attempts by neighbors to set him up on dates, while Pete, who has a hearing impairment, has stopped focusing on his schoolwork, sliding into disastrous grades and standard slacker malaise. Gabe has a loving relationship with his sweet-souled girlfriend, Stacey (Michelle Monaghan), but nonetheless feels similarly disengaged. The family receives a jolt when Gabe announces his intention to uproot and move in with a friend in Florida.
Relatively little happens in Sternfeld's screenplay, the rewards of which lie in its intelligent refusal to offer artificial, clean solutions or to broadcast the characters' conflicts in big, showy scenes. Instead, the writer-director coaxes out their fear, bitterness, hostility and sorrow through small revelations or telling silences.
Relationships and connections are tenderly drawn, notably the fractiousness mixed with deep solidarity that binds the brothers, Stacey's poignant retreat from Gabe as soon as his departure is announced, and Jim's difficulty in reaching out to his sons while still hurting from his own emotional scars. But despite the sadness that hangs over much of the movie, this is a profoundly optimistic drama, represented by Gabe's choice to find a new environment with less painful memories, Pete's tentative communication with a summer-school teacher (Ron Livingston) and Jim's first flickers of romantic interest in a new neighbor (Janney).
While Janney does a fine job etching a bright, sensitive woman open to new experience, both her character and that of Livingston are a little underutilized. But performances from the entire cast are hard to fault. LaPaglia's restrained turn easily stands alongside his impressive work in "Lantana," while Stanford ("Tadpole") and Webber convey damage and vulnerability with subtle strokes. Both actors are well served by Sternfeld's sharp ear for dialogue and his grasp of the awkward surliness and reticence of youth.
Harlan Bosmajian's graceful lensing captures the stillness, soft light and surface tranquility of the suburbs, editor Plummy Tucker lays out the short, quietly loaded scenes in an unhurried, flowing pace, and John Levanthal's guitar music provides gentle accompaniment.

IN SATMAR CUSTODY    Written and directed by Nitzan Gilady   April 6 through 12, Two Boots Pioneer
These days, on the sidewalks of leafy enclaves in upstate New York , bearded men sporting black hats and long, curling side locks pass women with covered heads pushing old-fashioned prams. The scene, straight from some shtetl described by Isaac Bashevis Singer , conceals a contemporary tragedy of ancient Greek proportions in director Nitzan Gilady's chilling and thoroughly engrossing documentary In Satmar Custody .
Gilady, a secular Israeli of Yemeni origin, disguised himself as a Hasidic Jew to film a fervently anti-Zionist, ultra-orthodox Satmar sect, who recruit new members among Yemen 's impoverished Jewish community. A young Yemeni couple, Yahia and Lauza Jaradi, heeds the call, with disastrous results. Stranded upstate, fed gefilte fish, taught only Yiddish and Torah, the Yemenis find themselves culturally adrift. One day, an accident lands the Jaradis' youngest daughter in the hospital; after allegations of abuse, all five of their children are removed and placed with Satmar families.
Gilady builds the tension as in a noir thriller, with haunting music, lots of night scenes, and men in dark coats shot from low angles and car windows. Yahia wanders about, seeking clues to his life's unraveling, as the community's crude manipulations become increasingly clear. Lauza, the bereft mother, remains a mystery worthy of Dostoyevsky or Flaubert. Gilady's film would like to absolve her (and to a large extent it does), but it leaves behind a perhaps more disturbing question: What is left of a person whose points of reference have all been taken away?

HAPPILY EVER AFTER    Written and directed by Yvan Attal    Kino, opens April 8, Paris Theatre
If there is any doubt as to whether French cinema is in a state of free fall, Yvan Attal's Happily Ever After  should put such uncertainties to rest. This would-be comedy about a thirtysomething family man (Attal) and his foray into infidelity is probably the worst in the putrid bushel of recent Gallic imports. Whiny and petulant, Attal's bourgeois schmuck sure has a lot to complain about: a svelte wife (real-life spouse Charlotte Gainsbourg ) who graciously tolerates his kvetching, an exceedingly well-behaved tot, and a job as a luxury-car salesman that apparently permits ample time off. Adultery tempts both husband and wifehe acts on it, she doesn'tand the resulting rounds of shrill soul-searching quickly crescendo to an earsplitting cacophony. As an actor, Attal is comically tone-deaf, flailing about like an attention-starved baby. As a director, he's a hack for whom subtlety is anathema. (A third-act reconciliation cues "Can't Help Falling in Love.") Always a fascinating screen presence, Gainsbourg has more to do than in Attal's previous solipsism-fest My Wife Is An Actress , but she's again stuck playing the marble goddess opposite her hubby's schlub. The more Attal insists on his inferiority, the greater his narcissism grows. Happily Ever After  is almost worth sitting through for cameos by Anouk Aimée  and Johnny Depp two consummate actors whose near wordless scenes are like oases of calm amid the self-important chatter.
