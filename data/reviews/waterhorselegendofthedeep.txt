A family film in the best sense, Water Horse
 plays like a cross between a World War II-era Boy's Own
 adventure and Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend
, minus the soppy treacle of the latter but with just the right amount of RAF fighter flybys to qualify it as a rather ripping yarn, indeed. There's even an English bulldog named Churchill (always a plus). Set on the coast of Scotland, the ingratiatingly plucky Etel (Millions
) plays Angus, a steadfast young dreamer whose mother and sister tend to Lord Something or Other's sprawling country estate, while he skitters around the tide pools digging up neat stuff. Unable to swim and thus simultaneously entranced and terrified of the ocean that laps virtually at his doorstep, Angus is a lad without a dad and pensive, as well. (Though it's not dwelled upon, brief mention is made of his father, a sailor, having been killed in the war.) The discovery of a barnacle-encrusted egg changes all this, however. The hatching of the egg reveals the titular "water horse," aka the Loch Ness beastie, and coincides with the arrival of a pair of dueling surrogate father figures for Angus. One is the dashing British Regiment Capt. Hamilton (Morrissey), and the other is the charming scruff of new handyman Lewis (Chaplin). Then, too, there's the problem of Angus' ravenously vegan aqua pet, which grows to adulthood quicker than Ray Harryhausen's "Ymir" from 20 Million Miles to Earth
 and, once out of the manor and into the Loch, rapidly draws the attention of Capt. Hamilton and his overeager artillery emplacements. With its Shrek
y ears and newborn, puggy snufflings, the water horse is extremely � and unthreateningly, to younger members � well-designed, via CGI and more tactile effects work. Despite the title, this is Etel's film all the way, however. His expressive, peaches-and-cream face, overhung by a frequently furrowed brow, is simply a bang-on depiction of childhood anxiety. Life during wartime is different for children, who can often manage to dream their way past dark reality into more interesting (if not necessarily safer) fantasy worlds. Angus, lucky lad, doesn't even need to do that.


'The Water Horse' is an enchanting monster tale
If you want to take the kids to a cockle-warming tale of humans and computer-generated critters, do yourself a favor: Skip the singing rodents and head for the baby Loch Ness Monster in "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep." The movie has as many cliches as "Alvin and the Chipmunks," but they're better cliches and the cast acts like they're fresh. Sometimes that's enough.
"Water Horse" is essentially "E.T. the Extraterrestrial" moved underwater and choreographed by the Scottish Tourist Board. Little Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel, the wide-eyed charmer of 2004's "Millions") lives in a rambling estate near the loch; it's World War II and his father (Craig Hall), the local laird, is off at war. Angus keeps the old man's workshop clean with a fervor several shades too dark, as his mother (Emily Watson) and older sister (Priyanka Xi) look on with worry.
A mysterious stone washed up on shore turns out to be an egg; it hatches and soon Alex is hiding a squawking, wriggling baby Nessie from his family and the local army garrison headed by Captain Hamilton (David Morrissey), a preening toff. This proves difficult when Crusoe, as Alex dubs the wee beastie, outgrows the guest bath and attracts the attention of the cook's bulldog.
Like its computer-generated star, "The Water Horse" starts out cute and becomes increasingly ungainly. By the time Crusoe has grown to the size of a plesiosaur and been relocated to the open water, it's difficult to believe he could be kept a secret from the grown-ups, harder still to buy that Alex could ride him down to the bottom of the loch without freezing to death.
The movie has enough faith in itself, though, to convince the kiddies, if not quite enough inspiration to hold mom and dad's attention. The grown-up actors turn in discreet and professional performances, with Watson striking muted notes of sorrow that occasionally flower into something bigger and messier. (But not too messy; this is Great Britain.) Ben Chaplin smolders nicely as a scarred young handyman who's in on the secret, and there's a funny bit with a pair of villagers cooking up the famous Nessie image known as "the surgeon's photograph."
Director Jay Russell made "My Dog Skip" and the movie version of "Tuck Everlasting"; like them, "The Water Horse" moves along at a dutiful clip, engaging us without transporting us. The digital effects are convincing - maybe too much so for the youngest children, once Crusoe is full size and the army is firing on him in a panic - but the real-life locations are much more awe-inspiring. Ironically, those locations are in New Zealand. If there's anything in that loch, it's a waterlogged hobbit.
The film's most special effect, at least for the grown-ups, is Brian Cox as the story's narrator, spinning this yarn to a pair of credulous American backpackers from his perch in a lochside pub. Your kids will think he's the real deal, but watch Cox's eyes: He's shoveling pure Nessie manure and having the time of his life. If only the movie were as wicked.


         An enchanting tale of friendship and evolving relationships, "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep" engagingly grafts coming-of-age movie chestnuts onto Scottish folklore. Though most of the narrative won't surprise anyone who has seen "E.T. The Extraterrestrial" or numerous similar stories, director Jay Russell and screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs create a realistic world in which the fantastical is credible.
 
 In a present-day Scottish pub, a young American couple looking at the infamous photo of the Loch Ness monster is offered the true story behind the legend by a charming old man (Brian Cox). They bite and the man quickly whisks them back to World War II with the tale of a young boy named Angus MacMorrow struggling with his sailor-father's absence.
 


         






   Simultaneously scared and fascinated by the water, Angus (Alex Etel) discovers a large, barnacle-covered egg in a tide pool at the seashore. He smuggles the egg back to the stately manor where he lives with his sister, Kirstie (Priyanka Xi), and mother, Anne (Emily Watson), the head housekeeper. Perched on a large loch, the home is empty save for a small domestic staff.
 
 That changes when an army regiment, led by Capt. Hamilton (David Morrissey), arrives to use it as its billeting quarters, and Anne hires a secretive handyman named Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin). The suddenly bustling grounds make it a challenge for Angus to hide his discovery, especially once the egg hatches, releasing an adorably strange sea creature with four flippers and a tail.
 
 Angus bonds with the tiny beast and dubs his new friend Crusoe after being unable to identify its genus or species. Kirstie and Mowbray are unavoidably recruited to help in hiding Crusoe after discovering him in an upstairs tub, and the latter tells the children the myth of the water horse, a mysterious creature of which legend dictates only one exists at a time.
 
 Though the duo of Angus and Crusoe initially conjures images of "Beany and Cecil" ("Help, Cecil! Help!" "I'm comin', Beany-boy!"), the relationship deepens as the boy attempts to fill the void left by his father. Etel is excellent as Angus, helping to ground the film in the uncertainty of wartime. Watson also shines as the protective mother unable to salve her son's emotional wounds. Morrissey and Chaplin give depth to their roles as men from opposite ends of the British social spectrum innately pitted against each other.
 
 Best known for family-friendly fare such as "My Dog Skip" and "Tuck Everlasting," Russell, along with director of photography Oliver Stapleton, shot the film primarily in New Zealand but manages to beautifully evoke the Scottish coast and the 1940s. The visuals comfortably balance warmly nostalgic hues with the harsher shades of the film's more serious themes and action sequences.
 
 Adapted by Jacobs from the Dick King-Smith ("Babe: The Gallant Pig") book, "The Water Horse" treads carefully on issues of loss and at times may be too intense for small children. Crusoe morphs rather quickly from cuddly urchin to fierce sea monster, and likewise, some of the film's shifts in tone are equally jarring, moving from kitchen-sink realism to slapstick, high adventure and back again.
 
 Still, given the lack of intelligent, nonpandering family films, "The Water Horse" provides substantive entertainment. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in execution.
 

 
 "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep." MPAA rating: PG for some action/peril, mild language and brief smoking. Running time: 1 hour, 51 minutes. In general release.   

Parents can trust that none of their wee ones will ask for a stuffed water horse for Christmas. The star of this Scottish fable, about the mythical Loch Ness monster, looks like a raw chicken breast with teeth when he hatches. The boy who raises him (Millions ' Alex Etel, from the Freddie Highmore school of cute) is nice and freckled, and the chirping creature helps him mourn his WWII missing-in-action father. But the pet grows into one angry growler; if he doesn't scare the kids, the adults chasing him will.

 Many lonely children yearn for a pet to call their own. In “The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,” based on a novel by Dick King-Smith, a  boy, Angus (Alex Etel), finds not only that, but a best friend as well, after the mysterious egg he stumbles across hatches a creature unlike any he’s ever seen. Adorable and full of mischief, his new companion, Crusoe, who looks something like a cross between a dinosaur and a snail, immediately adds spice to his drab life.  Set in 1942 in coastal Scotland, the film consistently evokes an authentic sense of time and place and features remarkable computer-generated graphics work from Weta Workshop, the company responsible for the groundbreaking visuals of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.  When Crusoe grows into the magnificent Loch Ness Monster and must be released to sea, its survival skills are put to the test, and the aggressive pursuit of the creature by townspeople and visiting soldiers alike stirs up “King Kong”-esque feelings of dread.  Brian Cox appears briefly, serving as the film’s present-day narrator. His character’s identity offers no surprise — nor does much else in the film — but that detracts little from this family-friendly escapist fare that should enthrall, without insult, fantasy-minded viewers of any age.    “The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has mild violence.

Taking the legend of the Loch Ness monster out for an engaging ride, "The Water Horse" benefits from a strong sense of time and place (WWII-era Scotland), lush photography and committed performances -- not least from the initially cute, finally fearsome CG creature of the film's title. Though it strikes some predictable coming-of-age notes, this moving, well-wrought adventure should appeal to fans of "E.T." and Carroll Ballard, though as Ballard's pics have proven, quality is no guarantee of an audience in this genre. Careful handling will be needed for the family-friendly Sony release to register more than a B.O. splash.
Scenarist Robert Nelson Jacobs ("The Shipping News," "Chocolat") has brought some conventional dramatic hooks to bear on Dick King-Smith's slim tale about a 1930s family adopting an increasingly hard-to-manage sea monster -- namely, making the story's protagonist a lonely, emotionally troubled young tyke and recasting the events against the war-torn '40s.
Set in the Scottish region bordering the giant lake known as Loch Ness, the boy-meets-egg saga kicks off with Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel, "Millions") discovering a rock-encrusted object washed ashore one morning, which he takes back to the sprawling estate where he lives with his housekeeper mom Anne (an excellent Emily Watson) and older sister Kirstie (Priyanka Xi). When a purplish creature resembling a baby dinosaur hatches from the egg, Angus immediately decides to secretly adopt the raucous little beastie.
Crusoe, as Angus names the slimy castaway, has a horselike snout, webbed feet, Shrek-like ears and a marked affinity for water. (There are also traces of dog, eagle and giraffe present, at least according to the press notes.) Eating and growing at a persuasively alarming rate, the creature soon gets too big for the bathtub, threatening discovery by Angus' stern mother.
Complicating matters are the British soldiers stationed at the house, under the rather bogus pretext that German subs are expected to pass through the loch. While Anne flirts with the dashing but smug Capt. Hamilton (David Morrissey), the script duly trots out handsome, hard-drinking handyman Lewis Mowbry (Ben Chaplin), who bonds with Angus and Kirstie, helps them keep Crusoe a secret, turns out to have a military record even more distinguished than the captain's, and in general couldn't be more likable to auds if he defeated Hitler singlehandedly.
Yet despite the obvious setups -- and the potential mawkishness of Angus' memories of his dad (played by Craig Hall in flashback) before the latter left for the frontlines, never to return -- "The Water Horse" never drowns in bathos. Director Jay Russell (who also helmed such family fare as "Tuck Everlasting" and "My Dog Skip") displays a sensitive touch with conventional material, nurturing the story's slapstick potential (i.e., when a soldier's dog realizes there's another animal on the premises) without going overboard.
Just as the creature quickly swells from pint-size pet to gargantuan behemoth, necessitating its relocation to the Loch Ness, so the film transitions seamlessly from a gently spirited comedy to a harrowing drama that might prove frightening to especially wee tots. As Angus fights to protect Crusoe from the eyes and cannons of the British militia, the pic quietly captures the frustration and dangers that plagued even those on the sidelines of the Good War, most notably in Watson's deeply felt performance as a single mother struggling to hold on to her sanity.
Vividly rendered by the visual-effects artists of Weta Digital (also behind "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "The Chronicles of Narnia" franchise which, like this film, was produced by Walden Media), with especially close attention paid to the creature's gradual metamorphosis, Crusoe never quite makes viewers forget they're watching a ginormous special effect, but comes close enough to establish the poignant, all-important bond between boy and beast. Supporting thesps are uniformly strong, including Brian Cox in an affectionate turn as the story's present-day narrator.
Oliver Stapleton's sweeping widescreen compositions are gorgeous enough to jumpstart Scottish tourism (though New Zealand locations subbed extensively), while the surging score by James Newton Howard (who turned in subtler work on this year's "Michael Clayton") overdoses a bit on the bagpipes and Celtic overtones.
Though the pic is being marketed as "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep," the title on the print screened read simply "The Water Horse."
