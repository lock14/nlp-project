Handsome James Caviezel crash-lands from space to Vikings-era Norway in "Outlander" and proceeds to help a tribe of heavily bearded crypto-medievals rid their community of the "Aliens"-caliber creature the spaceman brought with him.
What's that? Handsome man? Medievals? Science fiction set in the distant past? I know, I know. But it's "Out-lander." "Highlander" is something else. (Basically.) Both are high-concept effects adventures, but Christopher Lambert didn't spend five "Highlander" movies in a wetsuit the way Caviezel does here. In many scenes, he looks like he's on his way to a spinning class on the Starship Enterprise. "Hi, I'm Captain James T. Kirk. I'll be your instructor this morning."
Caviezel, playing a man named Kainin, acts with that kind of push, too. He really is leading a workout - the grunting, the beads of sweat, the shouts of encouragement. He shows the Norsepeople (feisty Sophia Myles, chest-beating Jack Huston, John Hurt as king, and, all-too-briefly, Ron Perlman as a rival tribesman) how to obliterate this people-eating creature, called the Moorwen. (It's from outer space but has a name straight out of "Beowulf.") Nothing seems to work. And the movie builds a fair degree of intrigue over how this massive, impressively designed special effect can be stopped. But as handsome as "Outlander" is to look at, it's never exciting or interesting enough to justify waiting 100 minutes for an answer.
Anyway, the real question is will the Norsefolk learn to worship Kainin? Caviezel, who hasn't been in a whole lot since "The Passion of the Christ," gets to play another savior.
Director Howard McCain does nothing wrong, per se. The showdowns and stunt work are watchable. But proficiency is beside the point in a venture like this. You need a spark of madness or glee. Something unforeseen or shameless but a little embarrassing - like Sean Connery in two "Highlanders." Once or twice the camera splatters with blood, but where's the joy?
By taking nonsense seriously "Outlander" never achieves camp. It's a comic book that's mistaken itself for scripture.



Conceived, per the filmmakers, as a "sci-mythic" version of "Beowulf," but playing more like a monster mash of B-grade offshoots of classier genre movies, alien-vs.-Vikings actioner "Outlander" delivers occasionally but more often misses the mark. Not helped by a wooden perf from Jim Caviezel as a humanoid alien who accidentally imports a real
 alien to eighth-century Earth, and then helps the baffled locals destroy it, this is a fast-playoff item that may not make it past ancillary in some markets. Hardcore genre fans will turn out but word of mouth is likely to be pic's biggest enemy.
Project started a decade ago in the minds of co-writers Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain; latter was eventually attached as director, and lensing was originally set for New Zealand. Following various financial snafus, the production finally lensed in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on a tab of around $31 million. But despite the script's long gestation, the finished product shows signs of hasty shooting and ideas that don't reach the screen fully formed. No fewer than 14 producers take credit.
A spaceship crashes into a fjord in Norway, 709 A.D., and only one astronaut, human-looking Kainan (Caviezel), survives. Reprogramming his language lobe into Norse -- which then simply switches to English -- Kainan comes across a smoldering settlement before being captured by the inhabitants of the wooden-walled village of Herot, where he's christened "Outlander."
Bullish young warrior Wulfric (Jack Huston, all flashing-eyed intensity) doesn't trust Kainan, and when the wounded outlander is cared for by Freya (Kate Winslet lookalike Sophia Myles), the feisty daughter of Herot's king, Rothgar (John Hurt, in full Viking hairpiece and whiskers), tension between the two alpha males only worsens.
Only when a half-glimpsed monster attacks Herot, and Kainan saves Rothgar's life, is the outlander grudgingly accepted. Wisely, Rothgar accepts Kainan's offer to exterminate the monster, called a Moorwen, but first, Rothgar has to convince his own longtime enemy, Gunnar (a rampaging Ron Perlman), that it wasn't the forces of Herot that trashed his village.
Script tries to build up a full range of heroic characters in conflict but is let down by workaday dialogue and direction that doesn't conjure any special atmosphere. Only Hurt, who can always be relied on to turn the most basic dialogue metal into something resembling gold, comes close to giving the picture any verbal style. But despite a couple OK action sequences, the first hour largely passes before delivering any serious mano a mano with the mean Moorwen.
When this finally comes, with nods to everything from "Alien 3" to "The Descent," pic does gain some momentum. But the confused structure, with more flashbacks to Kainan's backstory and an undeveloped guilt strand between Kainan and the Moorwen, too often gets in the way. With no special development of the era's heroic codes, the screenplay hardly makes a convincing case for being set in the Viking Age rather than any other period.
Color processing has a cold, grungy look in daytime exteriors and a slightly fuzzy, amber-drenched look in interiors. Geoff Zanelli's score is off-the-shelf heroic-action wallpaper. However, production and costume design do sport an impressive authenticity, and effects work does the job in a genre-ish way. Alas, Patrick Tatopoulos' monster simply recalls elements of other, more famous aliens.
