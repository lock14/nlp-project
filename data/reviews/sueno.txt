         First-time writer-director Renée Chabria's sincerity and commitment to "Sueño" are so complete they override its sentimental streak and some overly familiar plotting. Chabria inspires her cast to reveal the kindness and caring in her characters in a most endearing manner. "Sueño," which means "dream" in Spanish, is a sweet-natured film, steeped in richly varied and seductive Latin music.
 
  John Leguizamo, just as effective expressing tenderness as he is in his more familiar brashness, is a young Mexican who comes to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a singer-composer. Never mind that his uncle turns out not to be the Taco King of L.A. but the assistant manager of a taco chain store who can provide him only with a less-than-permanent job as a waiter.
 


         






    Leguizamo's cheerful Antonio is determined to remain undaunted. Still, he's close to giving up and returning to Mexico when things begin to happen.
 
  First he's befriended by a Latino radio DJ (Nestor Serrano), who encourages him to enter the "Chance of a Lifetime Mystery Musician Contest," and finds he has a new next-door neighbor, Mirabela (Elizabeth Peña), a newly divorced woman with two young sons.
 
  Once Mirabela and her husband, who has dumped her for a younger woman, were a successful singing duo in Mexico, but now she is resigned to being a dowdy mother. She does, however, encourage Antonio, who in turn begins the delicate but determined task of persuading her to join the group he is trying to form. Peña, who can be wistfully amusing, vulnerable and strong all at the same time, is always a pleasure to behold, but here she has one of her best roles.
 
  While Antonio has fallen for the demure beauty Nina (Ana Claudia Talancón), who puts him off because of her devotion to her widowed, ailing father, the crux of the film is the relationship between Antonio and Mirabela, who is not nearly old enough to be his mother but is also aware that he is in love with Nina. It's not an easy situation for Mirabela, who feels no longer attractive or confident, but her maturity and the innocent Antonio's determination to launch a comeback for her proves to be a resilient combination.
 
  While the contest, which offers a $10,000 prize, draws closer, "Sueño" effectively emphasizes the overriding importance of Antonio, through trial and error, finding the right group to back him and persuading Mirabela to join in creating his own kind of music. Leguizamo and Peña prove to be not only terrific singers but also good dancers, as is Talancón.
 
  There is a beguiling folkloric quality to the good-humored and affectionate "Sueño," and while it provides Leguizamo to show yet another facet of his protean personality, it is most significant for providing Peña with a rare opportunity to explore the wide range of her talent.

Brimming with fanciful ideas about life, romance and the rejuvenating power of music, "Sueno" sings a lovely tune but chokes on its own banal lyrics. Facile rags-to-riches tale doubles as a bracingly eclectic Latin music sampler, though fans will probably be sufficiently contented with their Ozomatli CDs to skip the feature.
John Leguizamo stars as Antonio, a Mexican-born singer-guitarist who moves to Los Angeles shortly after his mother's death. Predictable hardships -- the loss of his job at his uncle's taco restaurant, the indignity of frozen dinners -- are offset by Antonio's infectious goodwill and passionate love of his art.
Naturally, two shy women in the neighborhood soon come under the new guy's spell. First is Nina (Ana Claudia Talancon), a beautiful pre-med student who initially resists Antonio's advances out of devotion to her ailing father.
The other, Mirabela (Elizabeth Pena), is a recently divorced mom who, once she lets down her guard, turns out to have an unexpectedly fine singing voice -- making her the perfect addition to Antonio's new group, which is gunning for the $10,000 grand prize in a radio-sponsored battle of the bands.
Story doesn't get any less predictable as Antonio gets ditched early on by his initial set of bandmates, then considers dumping his manager (Nestor Serrano, in an engagingly low-key perf) and old-school bolero
 roots to pursue a solo English-language career. Faster than you can say "sellout," however, pic swoops in and solves these routine conflicts with similarly routine solutions.
Helmer Renee Chabria (who also scripted) gets the best performance out of Pena, who makes Mirabela's emergence from her emotional cocoon -- complicated by hang-ups about her age and weight -- a delight to watch.
Leguizamo is on less certain footing, not because he's too old for the part (though he is) but because there's something depressingly retrograde about the sight of this dynamic, well-established character actor trudging his way through the role of an amateur. Results admittedly would be more interesting if Antonio were not so blandly written -- if he provided even a small outlet for Leguizamo's edgier side.
Chabria occasionally takes stabs at more adventurous territory with surreal musical sequences that unfold, "Dancer in the Dark"-style, in Antonio's head, but these garish flourishes -- one of which finds Pena belly-dancing in a Bollywood-style number -- do little but accentuate the dullness surrounding them.
Slightly overstuffed soundtrack showcases more than 20 different acts from a wide range of genres including Latin electronica and rap. In pic's musical highlight, pop star Jose Jose takes the stage with Antonio and his bandmates, who all look thoroughly intimidated.
