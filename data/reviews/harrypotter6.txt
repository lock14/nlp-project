Installment six of the “Harry Potter’’ series, “The Half-Blood Prince,’’ merely gets us one movie closer to the finale, which, apparently is so big (and by big, I mean “$$$$’’) that it’s being split into two parts. This is the latest dot in the blockbuster equivalent of points of ellipses.
“The Half-Blood Prince’’ introduces Jim Broadbent as Professor Horace Slughorn, the new, extravagantly dithering potions professor. The performance is a lovely concoction of tics, stammers, and squints. But the character is a device, something to be unlatched and opened so the plot can move to the next locked door. Sadly, that door is in the next movie. There’s enough cliffhanging to give you vertigo.
Slughorn knows crucial information about the world-ending dark lord, Voldemort, who killed Harry’s parents and whom we get to see, courtesy of a vial containing his memories when he was a mean young Hogwarts student named Tom Riddle. Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) recruits Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to get the professor to open up. Harry’s proficiency at making a “living death’’ potion makes Slughorn easier to charm; Harry happens to be using an old textbook that, according to an inscription once belonged to someone called the Half-Blood Prince.
Meanwhile, the young, moody, and acutely blond Draco  Malfoy (Tom Felton) begins his stint as Voldemort’s recruit to assassinate Dumbledore, with the secret backing of Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman, as deliciously reptilian as he always is in these films).
There’s a biblical tinge to some of this, even if most of these movies feel interchangeable with Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings’’ trilogy. Partly, it’s because Gambon’s Dumbledore  - with his long white hair and matching, scrunchied beard  - looks like Moses by way of George Clinton and Gandalf the White. At some point, Gambon uses a staff to part an infernal red sea, which I think I’ve seen Clinton do.
Steve Kloves has written five of the “Harry Potter’’ screenplays, and “The Half-Blood Prince’’ reeks of formula. An hour or so of interesting character development followed by 30 minutes of boredom, then an hour of plot development. That second hour always feels as if Kloves just remembered that he has to lay the groundwork for the subsequent movie. The individual installments become extensions on a lengthening fuse.
Until the final installment arrived two years ago, this had been the darkest of the books, and the movie picks up on most of those strains. Voldemort and his followers are terrorists. But for a series so faithful to its source, these movies, this one in particular, also omit some of the boldest, grimmest deeds. The film’s Malfoy maximizes only a fraction of his capacity for conscripted evil. He does, however, totally maximize his likelihood to appear as the frontman in an ABC tribute band.
“The Half-Blood Prince’’ does remain true to the book’s hormonal action. Harry and his best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), fend off eager suitors while pursuing the object of their own affections. Lust in this movie is far freakier and more exciting to these kids than magic. There are moments when the actors in this movie look like they want to be ravaged as much as Kristen Stewart does in “Twilight.’’ Radcliffe spent a wildly publicized almost-year onstage playing a sexually troubled kid in “Equus.’’ But
he’s still subdued as Harry. When a waitress hits on Potter in a diner, I was hoping she’d say to Radcliffe, “I saw what you did with that horse.’’
I like how magic in these movies is not a metaphor for sex. The metaphor for that, at least for this film, is Quidditch, a sport whose players joust astride brooms and protect giant hoops. There’s also the hint of druggy subculture whenever the divinely droll Evanna Lynch appears as Luna Lovegood. She combats the movie’s occasional sluggishness with a hilarious sluggishness of her own. She’s part Anna Faris, part hippie, part pusher. And whatever she can do to bring out the psychedelia in the last two movies would be greatly appreciated.

Darkness is visible from the outset of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . The Death Eaters mobilized by the return of Lord Voldemort at the end of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   are on the loose in London, streaking through an anxious metropolis on missions of urban destruction that, in a different fantasy cosmos, might challenge the talents of Batman. Thunder rattles a gray sky; the camera alights on a heavyhearted young man reading his newspaper in a sad subway café out of an old Edward Hopper painting while he ogles a pretty waitress out of modern multiracial England. Yet there's cause for audience spirits to be high: The universally recognizable fellow is Harry Potter, embodied in blossoming manhood by Daniel Radcliffe . The newspaper is The Daily Prophet , that model of innovative print journalism in which every photo not only tells a story, but morphs into a moving picture, too. And it's abundantly clear that director David Yates , returning to the magical realm after Order of the Phoenix , and indispensable Potter screenwriter Steve Kloves (he's written all but the Phoenix  script) have perfected a crucial potion: They've found just the right balance of timeless spiritual profundity and contemporary teen specificity, of awe and humor, necessary to steer J.K. Rowling's   enthralling seven-book saga to a satisfying conclusion. Will Hermione (Emma Watson ) attract Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint )? Will Ron kiss flouncy, pouncy Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave)? Will Harry connect with Ron's no-longer-such-a-kid sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright)? And will good triumph over evil? Stick around till Yates and Kloves' final two-part Potter production, scheduled for 2010 and 2011, and find out.
Even loyal readers who enjoy the gift of clairvoyance may appreciate a reminder or two about the plot of Half-Blood Prince . Just before Harry is set to return to Hogwarts, the star student is recruited by venerable headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon ) for a mission. The old wizard wants to lure the retired Potions professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent , doing a juicy inside-out version of his role   in Topsy-Turvy  ) back to Hogwarts to find out what the vain old goat remembers about a certain former star student named Tom Riddle. (Long story short for Muggles: Riddle became Voldemort.) In the meantime, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is being groomed to do some major evil. And Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman ) appears to have Draco's back  as well as the most delicious ability to. clip. his. words.
All the while, the teenage wizards-in-training have enough to handle just being regular teens under the spell of raging hormones. ''Excuse me, I have to go and vomit,'' Hermione announces with a bite worthy of Gossip Girl   when she observes Ron getting all snoggy with Lavender, who's one of the great lovestruck steamrollers of teen literature. And anyone who has survived 12th grade has passed a pale individualist classmate like Evanna Lynch's Luna Lovegood in the hallway, or encountered an imperious dragon-lady teacher like Maggie Smith 's Minerva McGonagall.
On the other hand, not many teens face a hero's quest as daunting as the one set for Harry, with a showdown scheduled for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  . Half-Blood Prince  encompasses important plot developments involving both love and death. But the story is, still and all, only a pause, deferring an intensely anticipated conclusion. And it's in that exquisite place of action and waiting that this elegantly balanced production emerges as a model adaptation. By now, as played with utmost loyalty to the cause by some of Britain's most illustrious actors, the supporting characters are as familiar as the population of Homer Simpson's neighborhood (and that's a great compliment). Yet with a big assist from cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel  a Potter newbie who memorably shot Amélie   and Across the Universe    the filmmakers have found a way to refresh our eyes and enhance our appreciation for this rich, amazing creation.

 Correction Appended  Are we there yet? Well, not quite. “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” the latest big-screen iteration of the global phenomenon, is merely the sixth chapter in a now eight-part series that, much like its young hero, played by Daniel Radcliffe, has begun to show signs of stress around the edges, a bit of fatigue, or maybe that’s just my gnawing impatience. Not that the director, David Yates, doesn’t keep things moving and flying and soaring, his cameras slashing through the gloom that has settled onto this epic endeavor like a damp, enveloping fog and at times threatened to snuff out its joy as terminally as a soul-sucking Dementor.  That any sense of play and pleasure remains amid all the doom and the dust, the poisonous potions and murderous sentiments, is partly a testament to the remarkable sturdiness of this movie franchise, which has transformed in subtle and obvious fashion, changing in tandem with the sprouting bodies and slowly evolving personalities of its young, now teenage characters. The series is now almost as old (it took off in 2001) as Harry was when he started his journey, which found the orphan whisked after his 11th birthday from a cramped, tragic nook to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry in a parallel world teeming with wondrous creatures, including an embarrassment of lavishly talented British screen actors.  Surgically adapted by Steve Kloves, who has written all the screenplays save for No. 5, “The Half-Blood Prince” was to be the penultimate film, the corollary to the J. K. Rowling book. Instead, the concluding volume, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” has been deemed hefty enough by Warner Brothers — 784 hardcover pages, 2.4 pounds shipping weight, a fight to the death — to be split into two movies that will hit in late 2010 and summer 2011. Considering that the take for Harry Potter and His Big Pot of Cinematic Gold now totals almost $4.5 billion in international box office, the studio’s reluctance to embrace the end is touchingly obvious.  But, seriously, could we just get on with it? For at least one committed follower of the series, who closed the last chapter on Harry soon after “The Deathly Hallows” was published in 2007, the lag time between the final books and the movies has drained much of the urgency from this screen adaptation, which, far more than any of the previous films, comes across as an afterthought. Mr. Yates, who directed the last movie, “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” which also arrived in summer 2007, does a fine job of keeping Ms. Rowling’s multiple parts in balanced play, nimbly shifting between the action and the adolescent soap operatics. Yet even with a surer directorial touch, he can’t keep the whole thing from feeling like filler.  Not that he doesn’t juice the material for all it’s worth, starting with some preliminary mayhem meant to signal that this  isn’t your 10-year-old’s Harry Potter.  After a nod to the last movie’s big finish, with Harry bloodied but victorious, the new picture opens in London, where an office filled with nonmagical humans (Muggles, in Rowling-speak) are staring out the high-rise windows — as slack-jawed, presumably, as those filling theater seats — at sinister gray clouds surging in the sky. Suddenly three plumes of black smoke, Death Eaters in fast, fuming motion, cut through the moody overhead dome, race through the streets and wobble the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge that slings across the Thames, snapping cables, fatally upending human bodies and further unnerving the wizardly world.  If you haven’t been keeping up with the story, well, there’s always Wikipedia. Although Mr. Kloves has done an admirable job tailoring Ms. Rowling’s progressively longer and baggier books, he or, perhaps more accurately, the series’s producers have not made many concessions for the uninitiated. If you have kept pace, you will grasp why Dumbledore (the invaluable Michael Gambon), the headmaster of Hogwarts, has placed so much trust in Harry, a callow student with prodigious wizard gifts and little discernable personality. The chosen one, Harry has been commissioned to destroy the too-little-seen evildoer Voldemort, a sluglike ghoul usually played by Ralph Fiennes (alas, seen only briefly this time out) and here played, in his early embodied form as Tom Riddle, by the excellent young actors Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Frank Dillane.  There must be a factory where the British mint their acting royalty: Hero, who plays the dark lord as a spectrally pale, creepy child of 11, is Ralph Fiennes’s nephew, and Frank is the son of the terrific actor Stephen Dillane (Thomas Jefferson in the HBO mini-series “John Adams”). The younger Mr. Dillane, who plays Voldemort at 16, conveys the seductiveness of evil with small, silky smiles he bestows like dangerous gifts on Jim Broadbent’s Horace Slughorn, a professor whose trembling jowls suggest a deeper tremulousness. When Slughorn, the fear almost visibly leaking from his body, shares the secret of immortality with Voldemort, you feel, much as when Ralph Fiennes raged through “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” in 2005, that something vital is at stake.  If that sense of exigency rarely materializes in “The Half-Blood Prince,” it’s partly because the series finale is both too close and too far away and partly because Mr. Radcliffe and his co-stars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, as Harry’s friends Hermione and Ron, have grown up into three prettily manicured bores. Unlike the veterans, notably the sensational Alan Rickman, who invests his character, Prof. Severus Snape, with much-needed ambiguity, drawing each word out with exquisite luxury, bringing to mind a buzzard lazily pulling at entrails, Mr. Radcliffe in particular proves incapable of the most crucial cinematic magic. Namely the alchemical transformation of dialogue into something that feels like passion, something that feels real and true and makes you as wild for Harry as for all those enticingly dark forces.  “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The movie is more suggestively than overtly violent, though sometimes rather intense.

Kids' stuff is a thing of the past in "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." Suddenly looking quite grown up, the students at Hogwarts are forced to grapple with heavy issues of mortality, memory and loss in this sixth installment in the series of bigscreen adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Potter tales. Dazzlingly well made and perhaps deliberately less fanciful than the previous entries, this one is played in a mode closer to palpable life-or-death drama than any of the others and is quite effective as such. Delayed by Warner Bros. from a late 2008 release date so as to spread the wealth after "The Dark Knight" scored so mightily last summer, this "Prince" is poised to follow its predecessors as one of the year's two or three top-earning films.
After sitting out "The Order of the Phoenix," screenwriter Steve Kloves happily returned to once again skillfully condense a massive book into manageable dramatic form; among many tough narrative decisions, he has cut back on the violent mayhem surrounding the murderous climax and put off the introduction of Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour until the next episode. 
Director David Yates, after a prosaic series debut on the prior film, displays noticeably increased confidence here, injecting more real-world grit into what began eight years ago as purest child's fantasy; messenger owls and chattering house elves have been superseded by a frank Underground tea-room flirtation, school security checks and raging teenage hormones. The sets have been stripped down to reduce Hogwarts' fairy-book aspects and emphasize its gray medieval character, and even the obligatory Quidditch match is staged with greater attention to spatial comprehensibility than ever before.
As the overarching story ramps up toward one major character's death at the end of part six and the final confrontation between Harry and archfiend Voldemort in the climactic "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," which is being shot as a two-part film, this increased seriousness is all to the good. It's hard to imagine watching "Half-Blood Prince" as a "Potter" virgin without a clue as to what's come before, but it's a formidable entry with a heft and cinematic texture compromised only by a certain lack of dramatic modulation.
With the villainess of the last picture, Dolores Umbridge, out of the way but the unseen Lord Voldemort in the ascendant, neither London, subject to a startling opening-scene Death Eater attack, nor Hogwarts itself can be regarded as safe from the Dark Lord's gathering storm. While Dumbledore takes Harry along to recruit former colleague Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as new potions professor and, he hopes, to provide crucial revelations about Voldemort, Harry's student nemesis, Draco Malfoy, prepares to commit a heinous crime designed to pave the way for Voldemort's comeback.
While Harry remains mindful of his status as the "Chosen One," he is not entirely exempt from the lusts, jealousies and intrigues that preoccupy his fellow teenagers as never before. While Harry's growing fondness for Ron's sister Ginny is slowly developing, Ron is a sitting duck for the attentions of the irrepressible Lavender Brown. But, as we know, the brilliant Hermione unaccountably loves the comparatively slow-witted Ron, and she has only Harry's shoulder to cry on when he's not squiring space cadet Luna Lovegood.
But assessing the romantic entanglements is not nearly as much fun as simply beholding the big physical changes in the young actors, whose onscreen maturation will have been documented across the span of a decade when all is said and done. The biggest change since "Phoenix" two years ago has been registered by Tom Felton, who plays Malfoy; he's now a tall stringbean in the Jimmy Stewart mold, with a face that's come to resemble that of Jonathan Pryce, and he towers over Daniel Radcliffe's Harry, who looks to be the shortest person in the cast (not true when Imelda Staunton was around).
Rupert Grint, as Ron, has always looked a tad older than the others and continues to while showing more character. Emma Watson, perennially appealing as Hermione, has become a very attractive young woman, and Bonnie Wright's Ginny intrigues as the sort of initial plain Jane who keeps growing on you.
Joining such returning stalwarts as Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Warwick Davis among the Hogwarts staff is Jim Broadbent, who makes a terrific disguised entrance and is then simply grand as the eccentric old prof whom Harry presses for crucial insights into Voldemort; latter's student incarnation as Tom Riddle is seen in two crucial memory sequences.
It's this chapter in the Potter saga that obliges the always nasty but ambiguously motivated Severus Snape to show his true colors, and the indispensable Rickman delivers, as always, with line readings that are delicacies of the infinitely mordant kind. He is periodically egged on by the insidious Bellatrix Lestrange, a role Helena Bonham Carter plays with such mesmerizing abandon that one hopes the role fully pays off in the final chapter.
The particulars of Dumbledore's final quest with Harry could prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated, although there are unlikely to be many of those in the audience at this stage. Otherwise, the film is clear-headed and clean-lined; now that he's at home with the material, Yates has made a "Potter" picture that is less desperate to please than any of its predecessors, itself a sign of series maturity.
Among the always outstanding production values and top-drawer visual effects, special note should be made of series newcomer Bruno Delbonnel's exceptionally atmospheric cinematography and Nicholas Hooper's emotionally churning score, which contains only the slightest trace of John Williams' original themes.
After two PG-13-rated entries, this one has won a PG, matching the first three. At 153 minutes, "Half-Blood Prince" is the third-longest feature in the series and seems just about right; "Order of the Phoenix," at 138 minutes, actually felt too short. 


Don't let the PG rating fool you: The dark arts are back with a vengeance in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , the generally grim, occasionally startling, and altogether enthralling sixth chapter in a movie franchise that keeps managing to surprise just when one would expect it to be puttering along on auto-broomstick. Going a few shades blacker than 2007's already funereal Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , this penultimate Potter  picture includes the firebombing of a series regular's home, an episode of demonic possession that wouldn't look out of place in an Exorcist  movie, and multiple attempts on the life of Harry himself. The greater threat, however, is those unseen forces that compete for the hearts and minds of impressionable boy wizards.
You can credit Potter  creator J.K. Rowling  with some of the darkening mood, but also director David Yates , the British TV veteran and feature-film neophyte who brought a nightmarish jolt to Order of the Phoenix , effectively clearing out the cobwebs accrued two years earlier by Mike Newell 's stolid Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . Yates, who returns to the director's chair for Half-Blood Prince , may not be as lyrical a film artist as Alfonso Cuarón  (whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  remains the gold standard), but he's a bracing stylist in his own right, whose gritty, tactile images seem of a piece with the story's descent into what Joseph Campbell  termed "the belly of the whale." By the end of Phoenix , Harry had once more narrowly escaped the clutches of the resurrected Lord Voldemort , witnessed the demise of his last living relative, and beheld a prophecy that says when it comes to Harry and the Dark Lord, only one can survive. And, as the story resumes, death is once again rapping on young Mr. Potter's door.
Whereas the previous Potter  was structured as a coming-of-age story (with a pointed subtext about the benefits of real experience over book learning), here we get a double-barreled detective story, with the venerable Hogwarts  headmaster, Dumbledore  (Michael Gambon ), searching for clues to Voldemort's apparent invincibility, while Harry (Daniel Radcliffe ) ferrets out an assassin lurking among the student body. Mostly, though, the film concerns itself with matters of destiny and the origins of evil. Like many a mythical arch villain, Voldemort was (we learn in flashback) once a boy, too, plucked by Dumbledore from a Dickensian orphanage and enrolled in Hogwarts, where he quickly rose to the head of the class, until the tree of wizardly knowledge tempted him with its forbidden fruit. Now, a present-day Hogwarts student may be preparing to follow in the Dark Lord's footsteps.
The movie isn't all  gloom and doom, mind you: After the mercifully quidditch-free Phoenix , the sport of choice for Hogwarts athletes is back. So, for that matter, are the adolescent hormonal stirrings (first seen around the time of Goblet of Fire ) that wreak havoc on longtime BFFs Ron (the ever-ganglier Rupert Grint ) and Hermione (Emma Watson ), and periodically turn Half-Blood Prince  into something closer to Fast Times at Hogwarts High . There's an expanded role this time for Harry's moon-child classmate Luna Lovegood  (Evanna Lynch , who has the dingbat charm of the young Carol Kane ). And, lest he be the one U.K. character actor of his generation not already gainfully employed by the Potter  factory, Jim Broadbent  joins the cast as potions teacher Horace Slughorn , a former Hogwarts professor lured by Dumbledore back into the fold.
With his quivering voice and fusty, absentminded charm, Slughorn is the sort of teacher we have all had at one time or another—an avuncular, unapologetically old-fashioned bachelor or widower who endears himself to his students by treating them as equals rather than peons, and who, in turn, validates himself through his students' successes. He "collects" people, Dumbledore advises Harry—literally, in the case of the photos of famous ex-pupils adorning his mantel. But Slughorn also carries a deep, private shame, and Broadbent, who plays the part quite brilliantly, lets it infect the character's entire physicality. Perhaps it goes without saying that a photo of Slughorn's most famous former student is conspicuously missing from that gilded shrine, and the closer Harry gets to discovering why, the more he finds in his newest teacher a fellow tragic, tortured soul.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  won't make converts out of those who can't tell a Thestral from a Dementor, and the series as a whole lacks the enveloping, full-scale mythos of the Lord of the Rings  trilogy. But I'd be lying if I didn't say this movie gave me as much innocent pleasure as any I've seen this year.  So I, for one, eagerly await the upcoming, two-part series finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  , whose title alone suggests it will still be a while before gray skies clear up for our intrepid hero. Yet, curiously, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  closes on the incongruous image of sunlight poking through parted clouds, burnishing Hogwarts in a radiant autumnal glow. Surveying the landscape, Harry comments on its beauty, even as he realizes that his supreme ordeal still lies before him, and that it is sometimes dawn just before the darkest.
