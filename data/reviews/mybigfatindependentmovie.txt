         "My Big Fat Independent Movie" is a big fast bust â€” and one would have thought co-writer/producer Chris Gore, founder of the website Film Threat and author of "The Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide," would have been involved with something a lot funnier than this lame spoof of a plethora of '90s indie films, directed in ham-fisted fashion by Philip Zlotorynski.
 
  The plot Gore concocted with co-writer Adam Schwartz finds two L.A. hit men (Neil Barton, Eric Hoffman) assigned to stage a "botched robbery" in a Las Vegas warehouse for undisclosed reasons. They mistakenly pick up a forlorn trombonist (Darren Keefe), thinking he's a member of their gang, and eventually a sex-starved convenience store cashier (Paget Brewster) tags along with them.
 


         






    What's most amusing about "My Big Fat Independent Movie," billed optimistically as "a lowbrow comedy for the highbrow crowd," is that its promotional materials audaciously place it in the same league of spoofery as "Blazing Saddles," "Airplane!" and "Scary Movie." Now that's a laugh.
