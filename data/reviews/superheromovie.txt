How can you tell the target age for "Superhero Movie" is exactly 13 1/2 years? Because most of the jokes are Internet-related.
Facebook, My-Space, YouTube, and everything Apple come in for fond lumps, and when a character says "You're no longer in my Five," it's a giggle for anyone under 20 and crickets for everyone else. This could be the first iComedy.
As such, it's not terrible - splattery business as usual from the folks who gave us the "Scary Movie" franchise. Like its forebears, "Superhero Movie" delivers generic-brand Mad Magazine yuks, the broader and smuttier the better. You don't mind much until the comic inspiration runs dry halfway through.
An anything-goes spoof of the "Spider-Man," "Batman," "X-Men," and "Fantastic Four" movies - but mostly "Spider-Man" - "Superhero Movie" tells the tale of Rick Riker (Drake Bell, of Nickelodeon's "Drake and Josh"), a 98-pound high-school weakling bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly during a school trip. Before you can say "shazam," he's climbing walls and dazzling the citizens of Empire City as the Spandex-clad Dragonfly, a superhero who can do everything except fly.
Director Craig Mazin wrote the script, making this as close to an auteur film as these movies ever get, and one of the producers is David Zucker of "Airplane!" fame. Accordingly, there's a strong genetic strain of that classic in "Superhero Movie," from a flashback cameo by Robert Hays as the hero's unlucky father (he tells the kid to sell Google stock and buy Enron
) to Leslie "Don't call me Shirley" Nielsen as Rick's Uncle Albert. Marion Ross plays Aunt Lucille like Mrs. Cunningham from "Happy Days" with a severe flatulence problem.
The cast plays along with game deadpans, in tune with the silly vibe: Sara Paxton as wholesome girl-next-door Jill Johnson, Christopher McDonald as the power-crazed CEO who becomes the dastardly Hourglass, "Star Trek: TNG" alumnus Brent Spiner as a scientist, and Tracy Morgan ("30 Rock") as bald-domed Professor Xavier. Pamela Anderson is briefly glimpsed, sort of, as the Invisible Girl.
The best gags here, though, are topical and extremely rude, from an appearance by Professor Stephen Hawking (Robert Joy), pining electronically for female companionship, to a spot-on parody of Tom Cruise (Miles Fisher) in an online video interview much like his notorious Scientology testimonial. "Superhero Movie" is the kind of film that features a fistfight between Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, and the Pope, and dares you not to laugh.
You do - for a while, anyway. The hit-to-misfire ratio is about 50-50, and it tilts further as the plot wears on, not in the movie's favor. "Superhero Movie" would make a decent long-form short on the "Funny or Die" website, but at 85 minutes - 15 of which are outtake-heavy end credits - its powers of amiability wear off fast.



Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it�s saying something that �Superhero Movie� provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of the gags that just lie there aren�t actively painful. This comicbook actioner sendup should do solid if unspectacular biz.
Primary model/target here is the first �Spider-Man� movie.  High school dweeb Rick Riker (Drake Bell, of Nickelodeon�s �Drake & Josh�) has lived with dear Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross) and Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielsen) since his parents died.  He�s in love with the girl next door, Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), but she barely knows he exists and is dating jerk jock Lance (Ryan Hansen). 
On a school field trip to a local manufacturer, Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals, Rick is accidentally spritzed with a powerful artificial pheromone, which attracts unwelcome amorous attention from the lab�s entire range of genetically modified animals. 
One of them is a dragonfly that bites Rick, who, once he�s regained consciousness, seems to have gained superpowers -- including, natch, the ability to climb up walls with his super-grip. (Though that grip, of course, also leads to some embarrassing hands-on-the-wrong-thing experiences.)
Rick begins fighting crime across Empire City as the mysterious costumed Dragonfly. Meanwhile, jock Lance�s uncle and Amalgamated CEO Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald), who is terminally ill but seeks immortality, plans a mass murder coinciding with the city�s hosting of the World Humanity Awards. 
Climax at latter event allows for cameo appearances by an ersatz Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and others, following earlier ones by a foul voice-boxed Stephen Hawking (Robert Joy) and berserk Tom Cruise (Miles Fisher, who�s so good maybe the sequel should be �Tom Cruise Movie�).
Writer-helmer Craig Mazin --whose prior directorial feature was another superhero spoof, �The Specials� (2000), and who, like several others here, is a vet of the �Scary Movie� franchise -- keeps things slick and brisk. Very brisk, in fact: Without lengthy end credits that break for inclusion of numerous deleted gags (rather than bloopers), �Superhero Movie� would barely nudge past 70 minutes. Still, 70 minutes of good if unmemorable fun sure beats 80 or 90 minutes of excruciating parodies for dummies, a la �Date Movie� and �Epic Movie.�
While �Superhero Movie� has its share of rote slapstick and scatological jokes (though one urination bit is actually a highlight), Mazin does think beyond the midget-throwing, accidental-dude-kissing, other-movie-referencing box.
Perfs are solid if seldom inspired. Tracy Morgan provides one of the better turns (as Patrick Stewart�s equivalent) in a sequence that digresses into �X-Men� territory. Pamela Anderson gets good billing for just one scene; others making cameo appearances include Charlene Tilton, Robert Hays, Lil� Kim, Craig Bierko and Regina Hall.
Tech package is smooth, with some f/x deliberately on the cheesy side.
