         A wickedly funny satire about a lonely slob from Queens, the Burmese bride he orders from a catalog and the documentary filmmaker who chronicles the debacle before luring her away, "Mail Order Wife" sends up everyone in its circuitous path — self-deluded lonely slobs, self-deluded documentary filmmakers, pretentious chef-worshipping dinner guests, salty old Florida swingers, gold-digging Geisha-girls and that specialized subset of muddle-headed manhood that confuses sexual exploitation with humanitarian concern.
 
  Adrian (Adrian Martinez) is an Eldorado-driving doorman who agrees to let Andrew, a documentary filmmaker, chronicle his marriage to the beautiful Lichi (Eugenia Yuan) in exchange for the cost of the setup. Adrian has selected Lichi from the bride sampler of an "international matchmaking agency" catering to silver-haired gents in yachting caps and the comely but poverty-stricken villagers who love them.
 


         






    Within minutes of bringing her home, though, he is instructing his new bride on the finer points of toilet-scrubbing and amateur porn video production. Things get ugly. And when Andrew comes to the rescue, things get even uglier. (Andrew is played Andrew Gurland, who co-directed "Mail Order Wife" along with Huck Botko).
 
  If the nuggets of P.C. piety and social pretension skewered by "Mail Order Wife" were any meatier, the movie would be a shish kebab.
 
  There's something here to offend every sense of cultural identification and domestic sensibility, and if that doesn't sound wildly appealing, best to check out "Hostage."

 Just remember to dot all the 'I's
 
 
A meet-cute British romance genetically spliced with a cat-and-mouse thriller, "Dot the I" flaunts its mood swings from the opening credits, in which a spunky girl flounces around cool-kid London while someone marks up surveillance stills, forensic style, of the apartment in which she lives.
 
  Carmen (Natalia Verbeke), a volatile but emotionally vulnerable Spanish flamenco dancer and sometime burger flipper, lives with the plummy Brit Barnaby (James D'Arcy). He induces trancelike midcoital ceiling fixations in her, but she agrees to marry him anyway. The real trouble begins on the night of Carmen's bachelorette party, when, in compliance with French tradition enforced by her waiter, she kisses one last man before walking the aisle. The lucky guy turns out to be a half-Brazilian filmmaker named Kit (Gael García Bernal in his first English-speaking role), who from then on devotes himself to chasing Carmen. Kit commits their every stolen moment to video, but the rhythmic crackle of static interference on the soundtrack suggests he's not the only one.
 
  As Carmen is torn between two lovers, the movie vacillates between teasing out the romantic agonies of Carmen, Kit and Barnaby, and torturing its trumped-up, self-referential plot about moviemaking. The principal actors are charismatic enough to have carried the love story. But first-time writer-director Matthew Parkhill prefers to lean on clever plot devices, amp up the roles of the movie's sideline jesters Tom (Tom Hardy) and Theo (Charlie Cox), crank up the static noise and fail to notice that his engaging little romance has broken with reality and veered into hollow pastiche.

 It's 'Off the Map' in so many ways
 
 
It takes a rugged survivalist mentality to sit through 108 minutes of "Off the Map," a self-consciously loopy and mystical drama about a family that lives off the map, off the grid, off the land and mostly off their meds in the mangy desert of New Mexico.
 
  Directed by Campbell Scott ("Final" and, with Stanley Tucci, "Big Night") and adapted by Joan Ackermann from her own play, the movie plays like the al fresco production of a parody of social realist theater — all rangy speeches, quirky characters and wild, roaming symbols. Bo (Valentina de Angelis) is a precocious, home-schooled 11-year-old whose father, Charley (Sam Elliott), comes down with a crippling depression one summer.
 
  While dad weeps mutely in the outhouse and mom Arlene (Joan Allen) hoes the garden naked, Bo pines (who wouldn't?) for the all-American pleasures denied her: a suburban lawn, a new Girl Scout uniform, parents with jobs, a credit card. Salvation appears — or so she thinks — in the form of a newly minted IRS agent who weathers a 10-mile walk in the desert to find them. William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost) comes for the audit but stays — forever — for the enchantment. Fans of the irrepressibly kooky will enjoy such flights of whimsy as a preadolescent scrub-dweller ordering a custom-made sailboat on her new "MasterCharge." How does the delivery guy find the unchartered homestead? She draws him a map.

his strange, often silly mockumentary compares the love that two very different men feel for the same simple, submissive helpmate. The first suitor meets Lichi through Paradise Girls, a matchmaking service for American men and Asian women. A young filmmaker named Andrew is on hand for her arrival and her indoctrination in the household preferences of Adrian Martin, her new husband. He is a doorman who owns an El Dorado, likes his home in Queens well scrubbed and wants his chili spiked with long squirts of ketchup. She must also learn to feed his pet snake, Chipwich, a diet of live rats. Lichi's subjugation rankles the filmmaker, who soon discovers that she submits to more than fastidious cleaning regimes. She is shown shaving Adrian as he sunbathes in his paved backyard and indulging in his dungeon fantasies, and then the relationship and the film begin to break apart. Lichi takes refuge in the filmmaker's home, inspires him to ditch his fianc�e, and a new romance arises with its own set of injustices. A collection of clever details - her first foam Statue of Liberty crown, her penchant for toy pigs - get lost in a contorted plot. The narrative manages 30 solid minutes of ingenuity, before breaking into a version of Charlie Kaufman-style absurdity. The writer-directors, Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko, build some solid emotion from realistic performances, especially those of Eugenia Yuan and Adrian Martinez, who play the initial Queens newlyweds. Then the scrappy project crumbles into gags and screaming jags, wasting some intelligent comparisons about race, gender and class. In the plot's wreckage, there's the trenchant and timely focus on men who no longer want women partners to be their equals and prefer the mute smiling type, until they don't anymore. The directing duo, who cast themselves as the on-screen filmmaker and his sidekick, keep doggedly after their madcap mission of revenge for much too long, certainly outlasting the attention of many viewers. But maybe the film affected me too deeply, since my feelings for "Mail Order Wife" are akin to each man's romance with Lichi. It felt so good at first, but it was all wrong. "Mail Order Wife" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and strong language.

 Huck Botko, whose calling card was a series of "dessertumentaries" about poisoning members of his immediate family, and Andrew Gurland, responsible for the infamous ersatz docu "Frat House," have joined forces to beat up on the non-fiction genre again in "Mail Order Wife." This black comedy on the making of a docu about mail-order wives finally breaks down under the weight of its twists and turns, but mostly maintains a creepy fascination with its scuzzy characters. Skedded for February 2005 release, pic could find a cult following.

 Huck Botko, whose calling card was a series of "dessertumentaries" about poisoning members of his immediate family, and Andrew Gurland, responsible for the infamous ersatz docu "Frat House," have joined forces to beat up on the non-fiction genre again in "Mail Order Wife." This black comedy on the making of a docu about mail-order wives finally breaks down under the weight of its twists and turns, but mostly maintains a creepy fascination with its scuzzy characters. Skedded for February 2005 release, pic could find a cult following.

Docu director Andrew (played by Gurland himself) is making a movie about Adrian (Adrian Martinez), a chubby doorman from Queens and his quest for a mail-order bride. Adrian's charm (or lack there of) is such that the question of why he is seeking a wife in this fashion seems redundant.
Choosing from the Paradise Girls Intl. catalog, Adrian picks the demure-looking Burmese girl Lichi (Eugenia Yuan of "Charlotte Sometimes"). They exchange letters, in which his El Dorado and his "security property management" job play prominent parts. Before Lichi arrives, the camera "indirectly" captures Andrew paying the bridal fees for Adrian in exchange for the rights to film the new couple.
Adrian and Lichi are hitched and Lichi is put to work as an unglorified servant in Adrian's house, given lessons in chili preparation and detailed instructions on how to clean the toilet and feed live rats to the resident albino python.
But a visit to a doctor's office that has not been discussed to have her tubes tied proves the final straw for Lichi. She leaves Adrian and is soon installed as a guest in Andrew's luxury apartment while he tries to find her employment.
Andrew and his girlfriend sponsor Lichi's training as an Asian chef. They dine on her experiments and heap her with praise, until her hysterical refusal to serve dessert at a trial dinner reveals that the "desserts" Andrew had been partaking of were not on any menu.
Botko and Gurland get lots of mileage from the banal unlikability and casual venality of their characters' exchanges. Even Lichi turns out to be different than advertised. And pic's parody of a modern documentary is dead-on, particularly in its penchant for turning exposes into personal diaries in a quest to explode the myth of objectivity. But a muddled revenge plot that reunites Adrian and Andrew in Miami turns campy and unfocussed, ending pic more sloppily than intended.

"How can shit like this happen to the same guy twice?" was Bruce Willis 's lament in Die Hard 2 , which shouldered both its Xerox  plot and its body bags lightly thanks to a pervading air of jokey self-reflexivity. No such luck for the similarly repetition-compulsive Hostage , which stacks its corpses with the same baroque hysteria that Björk brought to the murder scene in Dancer in the Dark . Ex-SWAT Willis is a cocky longhair hostage negotiator in L.A. until a crisis slips from his grasp, leaving a mother and her son dead. No sooner has Willis shaved his head and moved to a PD in the sticks than three well-armed local teens attempt to steal an SUV and instead end up locked in a hyper-modern hilltop fortress with affectless accountant Kevin Pollak  and his two brats. Turns out Pollak has some nasty dealings with guys in balaclavas, who detain yet more innocents . . .
Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage  is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods. Much of the rescue strategy, for instance, hinges on the head captor never noticing that the younger kid is loose in the house, and the filmmakers scrabble desperately for a class subtext, pitting dirty-rich Pollak versus poor white trash, with Willis caught in the middle class. Once the craziest of the housejackersthe baleful spawn of a Crispin Glover -Trent Reznor  hatefuckgets a knife through the cheek and turns pyromaniacally love-lorn, Hostage  begins to evoke the notebook scrawlings of a trench-coat-mafia goon.
