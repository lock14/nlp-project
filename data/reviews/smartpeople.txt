"I never tire of Bleak House
," says Lawrence Wetherhold (Quaid), a widowed professor of Victorian literature at Carnegie Mellon University, who reveals no trace of ironic self-awareness in his statement. He's the central "smart person" in this comic drama, a guy who would be able to spell "dysfunctional" with ease but never recognize the word as a description of himself and his family. Lawrence is acerbic and demanding yet wholly disinterested in his students, family, and career. He's heartless and condescending to his students, whose names he refuses to learn, and remote and unobservant toward his two nearly grown children, Vanessa (Page), a high-school senior whose character traits are even worse than her old man's, and James (Holmes), who lives in the college dorms, probably in an attempt to get away from the family dysfunction. It's unclear how long ago it was that Lawrence's wife died; it's clear, however, that he still grieves for the person who must have lent some humanity to this family and that "know-it-all" Vanessa fills in as a surrogate housewife when she's not acing the SATs and volunteering for the Young Republicans (an off-key note in an indie movie about "smart people"). Vanessa is the one who came up with the off-putting title for Lawrence's new book: You Can't Read
. The film, which premiered at Sundance, is the first feature effort for commercials director Murro and novelist-turned-screenwriter Mark Jude Poirier, who make a distinctive, if not entirely successful debut. Poirier's language is often delicious, highlighted by barbs and dialogue that are as well-aimed as they are socially inappropriate, and Murro evidences none of the ADD flash that often makes commercials directors ill-equipped to handle character arcs. Yet there's something amiss in Smart People
 that fails to get a fire going among any of the characters. At the start of the movie, Lawrence's ne'er-do-well brother, Chuck (Church), shows up with the hope of couch-surfing for a while. The dissolute ways of the brother (whom Lawrence is always quick to introduce as his "adopted" brother) are set up as a foil for the tight-assed Vanessa, whom Chuck labels a "monster." The pairing is schematic and never gets a realistic dynamic going. Parker is cast in the thankless role of the love interest, an ER doctor who patches up Lawrence after a fall and remembers him as her former teacher. The reasons why this accomplished woman might revive her schoolgirl crush and become involved with this nightmare boyfriend strain credulity. It's hard to imagine Lawrence working up a passion for anything � even sex. The performances are all good, but only Church is fully believable. No amount of beard, paunch, slouch, and sarcasm can disguise Quaid's innate likableness as an actor. Page (Juno
) is truly one of the great acting discoveries of recent years, but, God bless her, she's already too old to pass for a high school senior. Another acting great, Christine Lahti, also appears in a minuscule, nonessential role, and it makes one wonder if there was a scrapped subplot or something else askew. There's much more roiling beneath the surface of these characters, and it's a shame we don't come to understand them better. Smart people, dumb choices: It's true for both the characters and the filmmakers.


When Thomas Haden Church is the wisest person in a movie called "Smart People," look out. This is one of those university comedies where the characters take themselves too seriously to be funny, which, come to think of it, seems a reasonable account of some lives on and off the tenure track. But it's a comedy despite the self-seriousness. The movie conjures up Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid), a self-absorbed, sad-sack English lit professor at Carnegie Mellon. His superiority complex also makes him covetous of a vacant department chair position.
Lawrence has been in a funk since his wife died. So complaining about him is like hitting a guy with glasses, I suppose. And based on the movie's obligatory upbeat ending (reasonable success, love), I'm guessing we're supposed to like Lawrence enough not to root for somebody to slug him, which Church comes closer than anybody to doing. He's playing Lawrence's half-stoned adopted brother Chuck, another of Church's endearing middle-aged slackers. (The movie's producers also brought us "Sideways," which also featured Church as a blissed-out underachiever.)
Chuck moves himself and his untamed goatee in with Lawrence and Vanessa (Ellen Page), Lawrence's know-it-all Young Republican daughter, who, in the movie's only interesting turn of events, develops a serious thing for her uncle. Chuck appears to be an adopted brother solely to make the attraction between him and Vanessa less unseemly. But the movie is soggy with seemliness. Lawrence can't remember the names of students, let alone see the future memoir-in-progress under his roof. He doesn't even know his older kid (Ashton Holmes) writes poetry. He's too busy trying to date Janet (Sarah Jessica Parker), the sexy doctor who treats him after a fall. She also happens to be a former student. (He gave one of her papers a C.) Wait, suddenly we're in a pilot for a precious CBS drama?
Written by the novelist (and professor) Mark Poirier and directed by Noam Murro, in his debut, "Smart People" is as feeble as the pained wimp-rock mewling on the soundtrack. If one scene starts with a half-hearted guitar strum, they all do. Like "Juno," "Smart People" is a hipster's iPod playlist in search of a mug of locally brewed beer. At least in the other movie, the songs, annoying as they were, sounded like stuff Juno herself might like. Here it's unclear how Nuno Bettencourt's coffeehouse music applies to anyone in the film. Page, at least, seems to get how creepy Vanessa is. (What if Wednesday Addams  
were played by Tracy Flick of "Election"?) She approaches her latest older-man crush with her usual surly wit, vulnerability, and delusional world-weariness. And yet as I grow to like Page's bitter stylings, there's reason for concern. Vanessa reminds me of you-know-who. Might Page be forever Juno, trapped in whip-smarts and sarcasm? I worry that when the day comes for her to do "Medea," it'll sound more like Diablo Cody wrote it than Euripides.
In "Smart People," there's one funny scene where Lawrence can't bring himself to upgrade Janet's C, and for once his pained snobbery is comical. Otherwise, "Smart People" wields its intelligence defensively. The filmmakers are smart enough to know who wrote "Bleak House" and how to define "eft." (Quaid, Parker, and Page try to out-vocabularize each other before super-smug Vanessa takes the SAT.) But not smart enough, say, to consistently use the same-size pillow for Lawrence's potbelly, or give Christine Lahti more to do than hand Quaid sheets of paper in a scene or two.
None of the characters' or the filmmakers' knowledge illuminates, deepens, or complicates this movie in a way that keeps you from thinking longingly of Curtis Hanson's "Wonder Boys," which was also about a grouchy Pittsburgh professor. That movie had adventure. This movie has a lot of sitting around. At some point Lawrence takes Janet to Manhattan, and Janet never leaves the hotel - she doesn't even phone Kim Cattrall or Cynthia Nixon. Mostly, "Smart People" is a failure of imagination. When Church turns to Quaid and says, "We should be gay," all you can think is, "Well, why aren't you, then?"


If I had to name one actor of the last 30 years who should have been a much bigger star  who, with a different roll of the dice, might have been as big as Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks  it would be Dennis Quaid  . In the '80s, in movies like The Right Stuff , Innerspace , and The Big Easy , he had an effortless rakish charm, and one of the greatest smiles ever. It was a guy-can't-help-it grin  a face-splitting beam of pleasure that invited the audience into complicity with the delight he took in it. A down-home Texas mensch, with the tiniest hint of a devil inside, Quaid was made for the chick-flick era. Somehow, though, it passed him by. (It was inaugurated, instead, by Billy Crystal and Richard Gere.)
Even without megastardom, of course, Quaid has done just fine. In 2002, he initiated a comeback when he took on the wholesome-hero role of the over-the-hill pitcher in The Rookie , and he has given a handful of searing performances; he marinated  spectacularly  in a martini of self-loathing as the closeted husband in Far From Heaven . What makes the Quaid of the '80s  the boyish matinee idol who never quite went supernova  so relevant to the Quaid of today is that in his best current roles, he plays men defined by failure, by the shadow of unfulfilled expectation.
In Smart People , a small, sharp, and pleasingly literate comedy, he's Lawrence Wetherhold, a burnt-out English professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has been drifting ever since his wife died. Lawrence is a crusty and miserable pedant, the kind of academic snob-cynic who uses his knowledge against his students; to him, they're so shallow he might as well make them feel like crap. The campus is dotted with former members of his seminars whom he can't recall, because he barely registered them in the first place. Quaid wears a beard that's like a billboard of scruffy depression, and he has thick, unkempt hair that looks as if it gets washed about once a week. Lawrence truly loves literature  especially Victorian novels  but he is also its prisoner. Nothing in the modern world can measure up. He has written a book no publisher likes, some sort of glum meta-critical harangue entitled You Can't Read . The fun of Smart People , which was written by Mark Jude Poirier and directed by Noam Murro, is seeing Quaid bite, with darkly funny and misanthropic gusto, into the acrid soul of a man whose life has curdled.
In essence, it's a Philip Seymour Hoffman role (a cousin, in fact, to Hoffman's academic basket case in The Savages ), but even when Quaid plays a man who wears his gloom like a suit of poison quills, his warmth doesn't disappear. You don't just get the gray storm clouds; you get a hint of the sun they're covering up. Lawrence has two kids  James (Ashton Holmes), a student at Carnegie Mellon, and Vanessa, a frighteningly tart-tongued 17-year-old who's so wise beyond her years, such a cool and precocious and ironic chip off the old block, that she could only be played by Ellen Page. The actress shot this movie before Juno , but it already feels like the sequel, and that turns out to be a mixed blessing: Her timing is just as ace (she gets many laughs), but there are, if anything, fewer cracks in her facade here. It's time she took on a gentler role. Lawrence also has an adopted brother, Chuck (Thomas Haden Church  ), who's a flaky and annoying parasite  and therefore the perfect catalyst for Lawrence's renewal. Their relationship is a clear gloss on the one in Sideways , yet Poirier's script is full of nicely offhand slap-down banter, and Church projects something beyond the lines  he makes the very act of screwing up a sign of grace.
Smart People , unlike Sideways  or The Savages , has a plot that's a little too rote. Trying to bust into a parking lot, Lawrence suffers a minor seizure and lands in the hospital, and since he isn't allowed to get behind the wheel of a car until he's fully recovered, the ne'er-do-well Chuck moves into his cozy-creaky Pittsburgh home and becomes Lawrence's (unreliable) designated driver. Lawrence also starts to date the doctor who admitted him  a former student played with crisp, sexy vitality by Sarah Jessica Parker  . Most of these story arcs are functional, rather than urgent, and I do wish the movie had more scenes set inside the trenches of academia. Yet the actors in Smart People  are such lively, offbeat company that you're happy to spend time with them. The movie is too savvy to let Lawrence shake off his curmudgeonly vibe. He doesn't ''grow,'' he just emerges, and that's enough.

 If you are in the mood for a movie about the rejuvenation of an aging, widowed college professor — and don’t pretend you aren’t — then this is a weekend of rare and unexpected abundance. By some miracle of film industry serendipity, two such movies are opening today in limited release. Even more bizarre: each is pretty good.  In “The Visitor”, Richard Jenkins plays an economist whose flagging joie de vivre is restored when he takes up drumming. “Smart People” is more or less the same deal, except that its protagonist, played by Dennis Quaid, is a specialist in Victorian literature, and his flagging joie de vivre is restored when he goes to bed with Sarah Jessica Parker. Whatever gets you through the semester, I guess.  Seriously, though, what these two films — one a restrained drama, the other a frisky comedy — share is less the situation of their main characters than the superior work of the men who portray them. There is something about impersonating thwarted intellectuals, their early promise and ambition fading into vanity and irrelevance, that inspires a certain kind of actor to tap into deep veins of pathos and wit. Jeff Daniels struck the modern template for this kind of performance in “The Squid and the Whale,” and in their different ways Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Quaid live up to his high standard.  Mr. Quaid, his handsomeness distorted and obscured by stooped shoulders, a sagging belly and wayward facial hair, plays Lawrence Wetherhold, an English professor at Carnegie Mellon whose general unpleasantness seems less like a personality trait than like a belief system. His narcissism is a seamless coat of many colors, a weave of grief for his dead wife, resentment at how much the world demands of him and the conviction that he is smarter than everybody else.  His son, James (Ashton Holmes), an aspiring poet and a student at the college, finds Lawrence’s imperiousness nearly intolerable, while his daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page), carefully tends the flame of her father’s ego and takes him as a role model in contrarianism.  Secure in the sense of her own superiority and proud of her political conservatism, Vanessa is Diablo Cody’s Juno rewritten by Ayn Rand.  Actually, the excellent script for “Smart People” is the work of Mark Jude Poirier, a fiction writer who has clearly spent enough time around English departments to have studied the tribal ways of the literary professoriate with ethnographic rigor. The scenes of Lawrence in the classroom or in department meetings are among the most frighteningly, comically accurate such moments I have ever seen on film.  That may sound like a minor accomplishment, but the great virtue of “Smart People,” attributable to Noam Murro’s easygoing direction as well as to Mr. Poirier’s wandering screenplay, lies in its general preference for small insights over grand revelations. There is a fairly busy plot, and some of its developments — an unplanned pregnancy, a flicker of quasi-incestuous sexual interest, the acceptance of a poem by The New Yorker — clatter onto the screen like carelessly flung darts. But to a greater extent than in most comedies, the narrative seems more like background or scaffolding than like the engine that drives the characters, who are propelled instead by their own colliding, confusing, idiosyncratic energies.  Lawrence, sour patriarch and weary pedagogue, may dominate the landscape, but the people surrounding him are much more than mere foils or supporting players. Ms. Page is both sharp and brittle, but as she did with Juno, she allows Vanessa’s callowness and uncertainty to show through her veneer of sarcastic poise. Ms. Parker, as Janet Hartigan, a former student of Lawrence’s whose undergraduate crush on him is revived when they meet in a hospital emergency room (she as doctor, he as patient), cuts her natural charm with a very real sense of anxiety and disappointment. And above all there is Thomas Haden Church, suavely stealing scenes from Mr. Quaid in the slightly implausible but nonetheless charming role of Lawrence’s ne’er-do-well adoptive brother, Chuck.  Chuck, whose refusal to act his age seems as defiant and deliberate as his brother’s decision to act much older than his, crashes in Lawrence’s guest room and strikes up an occasionally awkward friendship with Vanessa. Lawrence, meanwhile, pursues an equally awkward affair with Janet, whose consequent rivalry with Vanessa is both unstated and unmistakable.  Over the course of the movie  everyone changes, but the filmmakers don’t force them into preordained postures of redemption. They are defiantly fixed in their personalities even as they show — and eventually acknowledge — some room for improvement. But none undergo the kind of hokey, wholesale transformations that too often turn brisk comedies into damp melodramas. They, and the filmmakers, are too proud — and too smart — for that kind of nonsense. The ordinary nonsense of human imperfection will do just fine.  “Smart People” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing, drug use and two lingering glances at Mr. Church’s naked buttocks.

Novelist-turned-scenarist Mark Jude Poirier and commercials director Noam Murro make a competent but just mildly diverting transition to features with "Smart People." Dysfunctional family seriocomedy is well cast, but characters and conflicts lack the sharper definition of similar recent exercises like "Little Miss Sunshine," "The Upside of Anger" and Noah Baumbach's films. It ends up less a dark comedy than a medium-gray one, the impact further muffled by its marinating in a tepid pool of generic soft-rock sounds. Unlikely to catch fire in theaters, these "People" will eventually find their company most welcome on cable.
Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) is a widowed English-lit professor at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon. He's bored with teaching and contemptuous toward students, and has had his latest tome turned down by the usual academic publishers.
Things are also sour on the home front. University enrollee son James (Ashton Holmes) barely speaks to him. Daughter Vanessa (Ellen Page), a hypermanaging Young Republican, operates as dad's verbal sparring partner and substitute housewife.
Lawrence is dismayed when ne'er-do-well adoptive brother Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) shows up unexpectedly, broke as usual and wanting to crash for a while. He'd be refused, but alas: Climbing a fence to retrieve his briefcase from his yet-again-impounded car, Lawrence toppled, suffering a head injury. ER chief Dr. Janet Hartigan (Sarah Jessica Parker) informs him he can't legally drive for six months, in case real brain damage surfaces. Ergo, wholly unreliable Chuck must be tolerated as his chauffeur.
The curmudgeonly prof has a telling fault of never remembering his students, past or present. A hospital worker informs him on the sly that not only was Janet in his class, she harbored an unrequited schoolgirl crush. Long rusty with dating, or even being pleasant, Lawrence blows their first date. A second goes well until Janet has a sudden, unexplained bout of postcoital heebees.
Abandoned by dad's new preoccupations, Vanessa develops a sort of friendship with middle-aged polar opposite Chuck, who views her as a near-"android" who needs loosening up.
This relationship seems forced, as does Janet and Lawrence's chemistry. Perhaps if Quaid played up his character's misanthropy more (he can't help but be likable in a nice change-of-pace turn), or Parker (in a vague part) less glum, there would be more of a frisson. Holmes' James is barely developed, getting far less screen time than Page, who's solid in yet another smartass role.
Despite so-so material, Church lends the movie undeniable juice as the family member who's the biggest mess, yet also the happiest and most emotionally open.
Location-shot widescreen presentation is pro but flavorless. Nuno Bettencourt's soundtrack of mono-flavored folksy guitar strummings and lame songs (sample lyric: "Whirlwind uh/She's a turnin'�") are contemporary fern-bar music that make one long for the cutting-edge days of Seals & Crofts and Bread.

Smart people got no reason to live—and, sure, that's not quite how Randy Newman  sang it, but the point still stands. Because in Noam Murro 's directorial bow—one of those Sundance premieres starring famous people slumming it in dingy Indieland—the smart people ain't doing much l-i-v-i-n' at all. They're just drifting along, heads in hands and up their posteriors whilst moping and groping their way toward another wanh-wanh  tomorrow, during which they'll wake up and commence bitching and moaning about how crappy yesterday was. Look . . . see . . . don't you get it? The title's ironic .
Like, take Lawrence Wetherhold , played by Dennis Quaid  beneath a greasy moptop and a brushy beard. Lawrence  is a misanthropic college prof who, when he's not willfully forgetting his students' names or altering clocks to duck office hours, is out peddling a pissed-off rant to publishers totally disinterested in his treatise on how he's right and every other literary critic in the history of words is wrong, wrong, wrong . He's also a crap single dad who has no idea what his children are capable of: His college-age son James (Ashton Holmes ) is an aspiring poet worthy of The New Yorker , while his high-school-senior daughter Vanessa (Ellen Page ) is too chickenshit to tell her father she got into Stanford .
The geniuses in the Wetherhold household can't and won't connect. They're kept apart by the ghost of the late Mrs. Wetherhold, whose clothes still hang in a closet like she's just off to the grocery store for a bit, and by their big brains, which have apparently devoured their hearts. Cue Chuck, Lawrence's adopted brother, played by Thomas Haden Church  (and rockin' the best porn mustache this side of 1974). Against Lawrence's wishes, the fuck-up Chuck moves into the room with all the dead wife's clothes and starts loosening up the Wetherhold household—first, of course, with a little THC, followed by more appropriate doses of TLC.
Then there's the other smart person added to the mix: Dr. Janet Hartigan  (Sarah Jessica Parker ), Lawrence's former student, who still has a thing for the prof—understandable, as somewhere beneath the scruff and behind the gut is Dennis Quaid; inexplicable, as he's a sumbitch sans class or manners. Their off-campus meet-cute takes place in a hospital, after Lawrence dings his head on the concrete while trying to steal his towed-away car from the university impound. That's what they call "falling hard."
The film progresses apace: Bastard meets beauty while heart meets brain, and the hard widower's slowly softened into something more easily recognized as "human." Which is all well and good and nice and sweet, except Lawrence is more interesting as a prick—funnier, in fact, more human than the guy who emerges from the hardened shell. But more to the point, the movie never really gives a reason—a motivation—for his evolution toward softydom. It just sort of, kind of, barely happens, not because it has  to—not because the film's shown anything approaching evolution or a love so great as to be life-altering—but because it's supposed  to, this being a movie about dumb-ass brainiacs obsessed with their own navels forced to consider someone else's bellybutton.
It's almost impossible to bear the film ill will, as it makes a case for compassion and tries awfully hard to be awfully sweet. But then what? Written by first-timer Mark Poirier , it's all action without any meaning, a beginner's-class screenplay populated by archetypes—the wise-beyond-her-years teen, the hardboiled widower, the reckless and feckless half-sibling, the nice lady who rescues the dick from himself—who just do things till they run out of unhappiness, the end.
Quaid tries awfully hard, as he lumbers through university corridors and threadbare hallways with the gait of a battered, broken man. Everyone else feels like they're stepping into mushy, familiar footprints: How many times will Thomas Haden Church play the wisecracking ne'er-do-well, or Ellen Page be cast as the teen who sounds like a snarky 42-year-old? And Parker has two speeds nowadays, the humorless intruder who steps into a bastion of dysfunction only to emerge as loving and whole (see also: The Family Stone ) and, well, Carrie Bradshaw .
A colleague offers the perfect description of a film like Smart People , in which the plot lurches toward an inevitable, obvious, and not particularly well-thought-out finale: It's like the entire season of a sitcom whittled down to a single episode. There's no time for characterization, no room for emotion, no interest in anything other than moving the story forward. It's all action, no reaction. One minute they're miserable; 90 minutes later, aww better .
