Only very rarely do romantic comedies reinvent the wheel, which is why whole decades passed between Annie Hall
, When Harry Met Sally
, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
. Realistically, we know what we're getting into when we queue up for the latest studio romantic comedy � something which will surely cling to a formula so firmly fixed that any halfway movie-literate dope could graph its course from meet-cute to ever-after. At best, then, we can hope for an inspired flourish, a curveball or two, but even those eventually get swallowed into the machine (hence the codification of the ethnic, comic-relief bit player, the sassy grandparent, and the embarrassingly public avowal of love, all featured in The Proposal
). When you strip all that away, what you're left with is the likability of the leads. The Proposal
 counts two deeply charismatic performers at the helm, although, combined, they share the chemistry of second cousins. Bullock, in her first romantic comedy since 2002's Two Weeks Notice
, plays an all-work-and-no-play Manhattan literary editor named Margaret Tate. When the Canadian-born Margaret is threatened with deportation (and, by extension, professional ruin), she bullies her long-suffering assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into agreeing to a marriage of convenience, the reasoning being that if her career goes down the drain, so goes his, too. With a suspicious agent from Immigration Services breathing down their newly engaged necks, Andrew and Margaret head to Andrew's native Alaska to break the news to his family, including his 90-year-old grandmother (White, ever the Golden Girl, cheerfully straddling the ground between the dotty and the profane). The script  by first-time writer Pete Chiarelli could have used a stronger point of view � the split perspective ends up rendering both characters' inner lives somewhat remote � and it almost entirely ignores its would-be lovers' gap in age and power (Bullock is 12 years Reynolds' senior, and her character is his workplace superior). I suppose one should be grateful that Chiarelli didn't waste his time on cougar wisecracks, but still � there was risky, fertile ground there to be explored in the gender politics of the pairing. (What we do get, in a snippet of nearly nude physical comedy, is confirmation that Bullock is still in possession of both irresistible comic timing and a slammin' body.) Fletcher demonstrates, as with her second film, 27 Dresses
, that she can put together a funny, able romantic comedy that is a cut above, but no more. Still, those leads are awfully likable, the Massachusetts-for-Alaska landscape rather picturesque, and if The Proposal
 doesn't reinvent the wheel, merrily we roll along nonetheless.

Casting a romantic comedy is like eating. Just because you like sardines and cheese doesn’t mean you like them together. Sardines and cheese together is gross. As it turns out, so is the pairing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Individually, his sarcasm can be amusing, and her straining for comedy is occasionally funny. In “The Proposal,’’ neither brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try hurts the eyes, the tummy, and the libido. The nature of the genre, regardless of how it begins, ends with both parties in each other’s arms. And while I watched these two sets of lips (one set being a little fuller than I recall) head for collision, I prayed the movie might fall off the assembly line and jostle loose the dreaded oncoming event. I’ve rarely been less lucky. What is the opposite of fireworks? When two people kiss, can firing squads go off?
Bullock plays Margaret, the type of high-powered New York book editor who sends an entire office running for cover when she comes to work. (“It’s coming,’’ read the instant messages.) The movie had already lost me at that point since this is the kind of panic reserved for Faye Dunaway, Glenn Close, or Simon Cowell. In any case, Margaret learns that she’s being deported (she’s from Toronto). Thinking quickly (someone mentions the words “married’’ and “engaged’’), she informs her bosses that she and her unwitting, unwilling assistant, Andrew (Reynolds), are soon to be wed.
Why a screenwriter would think hilarity would ensue from this premise is anybody’s guess. Pete Chiarelli is that deeply uninspired screenwriter, and he sends Margaret and Andrew to Sitka, Alaska, so they can break the news to his well-heeled family (Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, and Betty White). It’s a ridiculous distance to go just to produce a location that, at least in this movie, looks like it could be anywhere (in fact, it was shot in and around Massachusetts). Sadly, the closest we get to so-called local color is Oscar NuÃ±ez, as both the town Hispanic and the only person who works (from stripper to cashier to reverend, he does it all).
Reynolds gets to drop his considerable jaw, arch his eyebrows, and wrinkle his forehead, always in disbelief. Bullock is back to doing her uptight shtick, and here it made me laugh exactly once, when she vamps around the woods singing Lil Jon & the Eastside Boyz’s “Get Low,’’ which is exactly what she has to do to make the comedy work here. She seems simultaneously too old for these low-calorie sitcoms and somehow still not experienced enough to pull them off. Meanwhile, White’s vulgar-old-lady act  is tired but funnier. (Is she the spryest 300-year-old on earth, or what?)
Directed by Anne Fletcher with the same pokiness she applied to “27 Dresses,’’ the movie builds to a heavily advertised sequence in which Margaret and Andrew run into each other naked then peel themselves away in disgust. The physics involved is impressive. But how is an audience supposed to believe, an hour later, that love could possibly be in the air when one lover’s sight of the other’s body provokes this kind of revulsion? Romantic comedies avoid sex, yes. But even by Doris Day-Rock Hudson standards, recoiling from the possibility of it is pathological. Unless, of course, you’ve paid  - or are being paid  - to sit through this. In which case, recoiling is not only understandable. It’s involuntary.

How are the elements of the charming,   traditional romantic comedy The Proposal  like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways...
Something old:  The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other  until they realize they love each other  is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get...loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw  she's Canadian. (So is X-Men's Wolverine ; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice .) Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap  executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) Okay, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.
Something new:  The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe. Reynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks. Who knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods.
Something borrowed:  The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nuñez from The Office ). The snappy screwball  dialogue in Pete Chiarelli's script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates...it's all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work .
Something blue:  As the wise and saucy matriarch of the family, the divine 87-year-old Betty White has fun as one hot grandma  and inspires her younger stars to say ''I do,'' too.

 Blame the heels. In her new movie, “The Proposal,” Sandra Bullock, playing a Type A (rhymes with) witch, totters around in a pair of exquisite high heels, the kind that elongate the legs and give a woman’s derrière the gentle backward thrust familiar from fertility figurines. The character, a no-nonsense, no-smiling publishing executive, otherwise favors an aerodynamic look (pencil skirts and ponytails), but the heels betray her. They throw a curve into her straight line and force her to tilt, sway and wobble. She might be the mistress — the harsh and exacting mistress — of her universe, but she’s clearly been prepped for a fall.  Like most Hollywood romantic comedies these days, “The Proposal” is all about bringing a woman to her knees, quite literally in this case. The simple premise is partly telegraphed in the advertising tag line, “Here comes the bribe,” which evokes wedding bells and desperation. One day at the office, Margaret Tate (Ms. Bullock), a Canadian who’s let her visa expire, suddenly finds herself scrambling for a way to stay in the United States and the big New York office where she rules with an iron fist clutching a designer bag. She finds the means to her salvation, yes, in more ways than one, in the pleasant form of her assistant, Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), a beleaguered Guy Friday who slavishly attends to many of her needs.  A stud-in-waiting, Andrew will soon be attending to Margaret’s other desires, of course. Overlong story short: Margaret blackmails Andrew into a sham marriage proposal in exchange for a promotion. He agrees, though only after making her kneel on the sidewalk. They fly to a cute little town in Alaska, where she discovers his family lives on its own island in a mansion picturesquely surrounded by mountains. You can’t see Russia from the front door, but there are loads of amenities, if remarkably no visible hired help. Mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Dad (Craig T. Nelson) are on hand, as is Grandma Annie (Betty White), the resident unfunny old-lady kook who’s about to turn 90 and could use a little face time with a big pillow.  You know the rest because you’ve seen (and read) it many times before. After nestling in the bountiful bosom of family and some unexpected naked slapstick with Andrew, Margaret melts. He mans the ramparts, she lowers her defenses. He thrusts, she parries. He chops wood and loses his shirt. She loses her cellphone and ditches the heels. He rescues her, scooping her out of the water after she falls from a boat. She shivers and smiles and tears up as she talks about her tragic past, revealing the sad little girl who’s long been hidden behind the cruel disguise of a sensationally successful professional adult. Ding-dong the witch is soon dead and in her place, well, here comes the bride.  The director marshaling all these clichés and stereotypes is Anne Fletcher, whose last gig was the similarly obnoxious “27 Dresses.” Working from a script by Peter Chiarelli, Ms. Fletcher betrays no originality from behind the camera and not a hint of visual facility. The opening scenes, including shots of Andrew rushing through the streets while balancing coffee cups, are right out of “The Devil Wears Prada,” minus the snap. The scene in which Margaret runs around naked is borrowed from “Something’s Gotta Give,” though here the point isn’t that desirability transcends age but that at 44, Ms. Bullock still has an amazing body. The rest of the movie looks like many industrial entertainments of this type: it’s decently lighted and as lived in as a magazine advertisement.  Ms. Bullock, who excels at playing spunky, is as appealing as usual, but the role proves as awkward as those heels. (Mr. Reynolds is equally likable,  though more decorative than anything else.) She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel (“Speed”) and take the spotlight (the “Miss Congeniality” flicks), an independence that persists all the way through the last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act. Certainly she’s no shrew in need of taming. She’s just another female movie star in need of a vehicle that won’t throw her overboard for sexist giggles and laughs.  “The Proposal” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film has the line, “Show her who’s boss.” Enough said.

"The Proposal" won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women -- including Ryan Reynolds' boyish charms, a hip granny and even a beyond-adorable puppy -- this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops. Mostly, this safe and calculated Reynolds-Sandra Bullock pairing constitutes savvy counterprogramming, what with the "Transformers" sequel about to invade theaters and "The Hangover" mostly hanging onto men. So even if the movie stumbles a bit on the way to the altar, the net result should leave Disney celebrating reasonably happy returns.
Director Anne Fletcher ("27 Dresses") is working from a script by Peter Chiarelli, but the story draws from so many sources the whole exercise has the feel of a committee effort. Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a book editor so tyrannical -- holy "The Devil Wears Prada," Batman -- that the message "It's here!" is instantly dispatched when she enters the office, as her minions hop to appear as busy as possible.
Anticipating Margaret's needs is the job of her assistant Andrew (Reynolds), but he's thrown for a loop when Margaret -- a Canadian suddenly facing deportation -- tells him they must get married, a maneuver that will not only keep her in the U.S. but save his job. Andrew blackmails her right back with the threat of backing out, and before you know it, they're flying off to his hometown in Alaska to break the news to his family -- and throw an officious immigration agent (Denis O'Hare) off the scent.
So "Green Card" segues into "Northern Exposure," as the starched, high-heeled Manhattan-dweller Margaret is exposed to Andrew's colorful clan, including his aloof father (Craig T. Nelson), loving mom (Mary Steenburgen) and wacky, about-to-turn-90 grandma (Betty White, still more than capable of stealing every scene she's in).
Inevitably, a thaw begins between the assistant and the boss he dubbed "Satan's mistress" -- one helped along by seeing each other in various stages of undress, which is sure to elicit whoops from the appropriate demographics. For Reynolds, that will only bolster his romantic-comedy credentials, as he and Bullock deftly capture the requisite awkwardness of having to deceive those around them. (Notably, Bullock found herself in a similar predicament in "While You Were Sleeping.")
Although there's plenty of rustic scenery (with Massachusetts as a stand-in for Palin country), prolonging the buildup eventually leads to some tired and silly flourishes. Fletcher started out as a choreographer and even gives Bullock a chance to show off some amusing dance gyrations, but all that nifty footwork becomes a bit more frantic down the home stretch.
By then, though, "The Proposal" has generated enough goodwill to get by -- and there's even a parting shot of White holding that fluffy, snow-colored puppy. In that respect, it's difficult not to admire a project that not only knows what's expected of it, but precisely what its assets are.

Starring Sandra Bullock  as the publishing-house boss who blackmails her assistant, played by Ryan Reynolds , into marrying her, lest she face deportation to Canada, this is nothing but a faint echo of its myriad predecessors, which are too numerous to name. You know every tinny beat and false note by heart, from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish. The Proposal , in fact, appears to have been written using a secret cache of computers stored beneath Walt Disney  HQ since 1978—codename "Pete Chiarelli ," the first-time screenwriter who receives credit for having pilfered every rom-com convention since the invention of breathing. (It was directed by Anne Fletcher , who stitched together 27 Dresses  out of the leftover scraps not used here.) Or, perhaps, it's the product of a book of MadLibs in which spaces are left blank for The Handsome Male Ingénue Specializing in Cocked Eyebrows, The Former Rom-Com It-Girl on Comeback Trail Who Looks 10 Years Younger Than Her Age, and The Ex–Golden Girl  as Dirty-Minded Grandmother. Already filled in: Craig T. Nelson  and Mary Steenburgen  as The Parents and Malin Akerman  as The One Who Got Away. And there you have it: HBO  instaclassic! "Here comes the bride," utters the poster's tagline. Genius. Such great minds.
