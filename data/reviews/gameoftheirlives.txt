It's easy to see how indifferent this country is toward soccer when you look at the movies we have -- or haven't -- made about it. The ones that do exist tend to be rambunctious kiddie flicks front-loaded with funnymen and crotch kicks. It says everything about American movies' interest in the game when ''Fever Pitch," Nick Hornby's soccer-fan memoir, is made over as the story of a stark-raving Red Sox nut.
The only major depiction that comes to mind is the 13-year-old Rodney Dangerfield-Jackee Harry vehicle ''Ladybugs," although this summer there is ''Kicking and Screaming," but that just looks like coach Will Ferrell out-bratting a bunch of 10-year-old boys.
In the meantime, ''The Game of Their Lives," a perfectly reverent feel-good portrait, is sneaking into the Fresh Pond multiplex today. The film retells the 55-year-old story of how the American men's soccer team scored a major upset against England in the first round of the World Cup. The film does so with as little fuss as possible without being completely indolent. But given that it's merely another sports-triumph flick (Team USA was a 500-to-1 underdog), the story could pretty much tell itself.
The filmmakers are none other than director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo, who made ''Hoosiers," that classic high school basketball odds-beater, and the college football weepie ''Rudy," an ESPN classic. Here they're working with considerably lower dramatic stakes.
A group of first-generation Italian-Americans from St. Louis is recruited to play with a band of East Coast preppies. The culture clashing goes on for a few scenes but it doesn't take long for everybody to lay off the ethnic slurs and play as a team. The guys even embrace the Haitian-born New Yorker Joe Gatjeans (Jimmy Jean-Louis) and his voodoo.
The cast is hard-working. ''Phantom of the Opera" star Gerard Butler plays goalie Frank Borghi, and he's much more appealing now that you can see his entire face. Wes Bentley, the pot dealer in ''American Beauty," resurfaces as team captain Walter Bahr. The grunge singer-turned-Mr. Gwen Stefani, Gavin Rossdale, plays the cocky English star Stanley Mortensen, who seems to have been the David Beckham of his day.
The big news, aside from the appearance of ''Home Improvement" son Zachery Ty Bryan, is the teaming up of the Mandylor brothers, Costas of Skinemax fame and Louis, star of the martial-art flicks that turn up on Cinemax's Action Max channel. They play hotheaded Charley ''Gloves" Columbo and softhearted Gino Pariani, respectively.
The 1950 World Cup was the first after World War II, and the US team was heading down to Brazil as a public relations move and an investment in the American future of soccer. They weren't supposed to beat anybody, let alone the country that invented the sport. (The team eventually lost to Chile.)
It's that objective that gives ''The Game of Their Lives" its wistfulness. The movie opens in the stands at a D.C. United match, where the indelibly named Dent McSkimming (Patrick Stewart), the reporter who covered the Cup that year, rejoices in how the game's popularity has grown over half a century. Indeed it has! Warming up on the field are Landon Donovan and Freddy Adu.
Stewart narrates the movie and does the commentating during the matches, which are pretty exciting. What the cast members lack in sharpened skill they more than make up for in raw gusto and athletic scrappiness (most of the actors have logged a lot of soccer in their pasts). These guys give a sport that is virtually nameless in the movies a good name in this one.


         Thirty years prior to the U.S. Olympic hockey team's 1980 gold medal triumph in Lake Placid, N.Y. (dramatized last year in the film "Miracle"), an equally unlikely upset occurred when a hastily assembled American squad beat international soccer powerhouse England, 1-0, in the first round of the World Cup.
 
  "The Game of Their Lives" — written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, the team that brought you the crowd-pleasing "Hoosiers" and "Rudy" — follows that 1950 World Cup team from tryouts held only weeks before they departed through to the climactic tournament in Brazil.
 


         






    Opposites clash as a group of scrappy players from an Italian section of St. Louis known as the Hill attempts to mesh its loosely improvisational style with the more disciplined approach employed by the East Coast players who make up the rest of the team in this oddly flat film.
 
  Despite strong performances by Gerard Butler and Wes Bentley as the leaders of the two factions and crisply directed soccer action, the movie lacks a powerful central presence to carry the drama. Like a corner kick that doesn't quite bend, "Game" is a faithful, straightforward docudrama that fails to become something more rewarding.
 
 "The Game of Their Lives," PG for some mild language and thematic elements. Running time: 1 hour, 41 minutes. In general release.
 
 

 
 Putting 'Madison'
 
  back on the map
 
 
Jim Caviezel, who last year played one character capable of walking on water ("The Passion of the Christ") and another who could drive a golf ball over it ("Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"), stars as the pilot of a hydroplane racer that skims the water in the painfully sincere drama "Madison."
 
  The film is based on the true story of Madison, Ind., an Ohio River town that in 1971 was on the verge of becoming a Rust Belt casualty of modernization after trucking superceded shipping as the region's preferred mode of commercial transit. Caviezel plays the volunteer crew chief of the municipally owned boat, the Miss Madison, who rallies his fellow citizens as they attempt to raise $50,000 to stage hydroplaning's prestigious Gold Cup in the hope of turning around the town's fate.
 
  Directed by William Bindley from a script he wrote with his brother Scott, "Madison" was made before "Passion" or "Bobby Jones" and benefits from Caviezel's ability to project earnestness better than nearly any actor currently working, but its near-comic predictability, "What else could go wrong?" plotting and cliché-ridden screenplay sink it.
 
 "Madison," PG for some mild language and sports peril. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes. At selected theaters.
 
 
   

In the unabashed little fan-oriented film The Game of Their Lives  (based, as such movies always are, on a real story), a motley group of athletes find common cause and team pride in representing the U.S. of A. against opponents from the smug country that dominates their sport. And against all odds, on unfamiliar soil, the Americans...well, guess. Only this time the sport is soccer, the setting is an immigrant enclave of St. Louis in 1950, the supercilious enemy is England (embodied by Gavin Rossdale), and many of the well-mannered young men are recent GIs who would never use the word ''miracle'' loosely. (The ridiculously good-looking cast of footballers includes Wes Bentley, Gerard Butler, and Richard Jenik.)
Coaching from the same playbook with which they made Rudy  and Hoosiers , director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo create a reverent fable of such soothing proportions that it would be churlish to ask if America ever really looked like that  or sounded like that, either: As an old sportswriter, Patrick Stewart tries out an accent left over by the Pepperidge Farm cookie man.


The routine genre of inspirational sports movies becomes more rote with "The Game of Their Lives," the true story of a ragtag squad of Yank soccer players' upset of a Blighty team during the 1950 prelims for the World Cup. Picturesque pic, however, lacks even a penalty kick's worth of tension and is paradoxically inert for a movie about guys running up and down the pitch for the glory of the U.S. Tale is much better known in the Mother Country than in the States, assuring the film a cellar position in B.O. standings and a quick drop to vid leagues.
Director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo (adapting from Geoffrey Douglas' tome) attempt to apply the same magic that worked for them with "Hoosiers" and "Rudy," two similar but more energetic underdog sagas. Centered on a minor match to begin with, "Game" especially suffers in comparison to the recent"Miracle," a re-creation of a considerably more famous U.S. sporting upset.
In a packed RFK Stadium in D.C. for the MLS all-star game in 2004, the elderly soccer journalist Dent McSkimming (Patrick Stewart) relates the story, replete with voiceover observations to guide clueless Yank viewers. Clunky beginning sets an overly solemn tone relentlessly underlined by William Ross' impersonal score, and Dent's recollections of talented Italian-American players from St. Louis is decorated in gooey nostalgia, due in no small part to lenser Johnny E. Jensen's excessive backlighting.
Team leader is sure-handed goalkeeper Frank Borghi (Gerard Butler), while scorers are led by "Pee Wee" Wallace (Jay Rodan) and Gino Pariani (Louis Mandylor) and protected by enforcer Charlie "Gloves" Columbo (Costas Mandylor).
The younger Dent (Terry Kinney) reports on the squad for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but is as surprised as everyone else when the guys are invited to tryouts for a Yank team to vie for the World Cup.
Instantly, personal complications ensue. However, factual though they may be, the problems lack drama. Nonetheless, Pizzo's script is constantly bending over backward to insert as many strands of conflict as possible.
The next hurdle is meshing with a squad of upscale Easterners led by straight-arrow war vet Walter Bahr (Wes Bentley). Walter sagely gets goalkeeper Frank on his side, introducing him to gifted Haitian emigre Joe Gaetjens (Jimmy Jean-Louis). Coach Bill Jeffrey (John Rhys Davies) at first objects to Joe joining the team, presumably because he's black, but any cultural clash is swept under the carpet by a movie that gets softer by the reel.
Few characters are individualized enough to humanize the perfunctory storytelling, and the tendency to give each lead near-identical haircuts and clothing is no help. As a result, Butler and Bentley are good actors penned in by the blandness, with only Rodan's Pee Wee able to show off any quirks.
Prelim match outside Rio (effectively lensed on Brazilian locales) against the Brits may be the game of their lives, but its outcome comes across as rigidly predictable. BBC soccer reporter Tim Vickery injects real vitality into the action with some of the best sports pic play-by-play this side of Vin Scully, but even Vickery's efforts in the final minutes are too late to bring this snoozer back to life.
