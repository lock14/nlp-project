Clerks II
 will find Kevin Smith's detractors saying that the filmmaker simply regurgitates the past, while his loyal fan base will applaud his return to the tried and true. Either way, Smith recovers his solid footing with this sequel, after stumbling in epic fashion with his last couple of films, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
 and Jersey Girl
. Twelve years have passed since we left counter clerks Dante Hicks (O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Anderson) at the New Jersey Quick Stop and next-door video store. Their thoughts and conversations are still as raunchy and witty as they were when they were in their 20s, and their aspirations are just as absent as they were a decade ago, yet now their contentment is a little sadder to observe. They've moved on from working at the Quick Stop to Mooby's, the themed fast-food joint whose lurking presence has been referenced in previous Askewniverse films (so named after Smith's production company View Askew). Not even the shift in working environment comes of their own volition – as the film's opening gag so brilliantly demonstrates. However, fate has landed the compliant Dante with a bossy fiancée, who's convinced him to move from Jersey to Florida, get married, and run one of her father's car washes. Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, Dante is about to head south because it's so unbelievable that this beautiful babe actually wants him and also because it just seems like the appropriate thing to do. Then, Dante's final day at Mooby's turns out to be event-packed and life-changing – not least because of the presence of temporary Mooby's manager Becky (Dawson). Dawson is a knock-out in this movie as she challenges Dante, as well as the entire audience, to fall completely in love with her. Her performance is so breezy and seemingly effortless that she almost single-handedly elevates the quality of Smith's movie, which is predominantly performed by his usual ragged repertory corps. Another newcomer, Fehrman as Mooby's virginal employee, is also a standout as he argues with Randal the virtues of The Lord of the Rings
 trilogy versus the Star Wars
 cycle and soils his naivete with the company he keeps at Mooby's. Although the added charms of Dawson and Fehrman burnish the rudimentary acting skills of O'Halloran and Anderson, there is little that can be done about Schwalbach Smith as Dante's fiancée Emma other than to point out to the filmmaker that it's rarely a good idea to cast your nonprofessional spouse in a leading role in your movie. (Smith's daughter also makes a brief appearance in Clerks II.
) Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) also return as the pot-dealing duo that's permanently parked outside the store, and Mewes, following a stint in rehab, has never been sharper or funnier. Cameos from Askewniverse regulars Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Ethan Suplee, as well as a comic interlude with Wanda Sykes and Earthquake, provide welcome moments. Smith's filmmaking technique has matured a bit, along with his characters; however, the liveliness of the film's dance sequence set to the Jackson 5's "ABC" may reveal one of Smith's hidden talents. Randal and Dante, despite approaching middle age, remain as profane and scatalogical as ever – if not more so. (The fact that Clerks II
, which contains vivid scenes of "interspecies erotica" among other affronts, earned Smith his only uncontested R rating from the MPAA says more about the mysteriously shifting standards of that agency than it does about Smith.) Extended riffs on impolite subjects abound, and even Randal finds a cause to believe in when he decides to reclaim the validity of a certain racial slur. Shrewd music selections also buoy the movie and help compensate for some of its more gratuitous moments (I'm talking about the Go-kart sequence here). All in all, Clerks II
 finds Smith and his heroes at the precipice of maturity and moving ahead with cautious baby steps. (See p.51 of this week's Screens section for an interview with Kevin Smith.)



Class reunions are funny things. People show up looking for their younger selves while trying to convince everybody else they've grown up. The old rallying cries sound vaguely silly coming from men equipped with love handles. And the angst and anger and boredom of early adulthood have been replaced by the last thing a kid wants to hear about: sentiment.
All that and you wouldn't miss it for the world.
So it is with Kevin Smith's long-awaited ``Clerks II," which might better be termed a low
-class reunion. The 1994 original was a blast of straight-outta-Jersey bile, shot in black and white and paid for out of the loose-penny cup by the cash register. Foul-mouthed, dirty-minded, mostly hilarious, it was Smith's way of climbing out of his own convenience-store McJob and helped kick - start the mid-'90s indie-film boom.
Smith went on to ``Chasing Amy " and ``Dogma ," got married, had a kid, then took a tumble with 2004's ``Jersey Girl ," a perfectly OK heart-tugger that had the misfortune of getting caught in the Ben Affleck/J-Lo pile-on. With ``Clerks II," the director retreats to home turf, but is Smith playing it safe or is he really interested in seeing how the old nabe has changed?
Bit of both, actually. Dante (Brian O'Halloran ), the hapless check-out drone of ``Clerks," is now 32, on the beefy side, and working at a fast-food franchise called Mooby's (the beloved Quick Stop having burned to the ground). He's engaged to an ambitious hot patootie named Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach , Smith's wife) and is on the verge of moving to Florida. At long last, maturity beckons, so why is he terrified? Is it because he yearns for his boss, Becky (Rosario Dawson ), a more grounded (not to mention gorgeous) Jersey girl?
The script, by the way, does what it can to convince us that Rosario Dawson might conceivably be found running a strip-mall restaurant. Personally, I'm not buying it. But I'm not arguing either.
While Dante is sizing up belated adulthood, his best friend, Randal (Jeff Anderson ), has regressed even further. O'Halloran looks his age, but Anderson appears to have awoken from a cryogenic sleep: same baseball cap twisted on backward , same dead-eyed contempt for the world, same delight taken in extreme political incorrectness and torturing the Normals. When Dante chides him for insulting a handicapped woman, Randal snorts, ``It's not like she's Anne Frank." Helen Keller, you mean? Whatever.
``Clerks II" notes where things in this cultural dead end have changed and where they've stayed the same. Out in the parking lot, Jay (Jason Mewes ) and Silent Bob (Smith) are still selling weed, but they're fresh out of rehab, and Jay insists (in language unfit for a family newspaper) that he has found Jesus. Of all the reassembled cast, Mewes looks as if he's been through the worst, but his devil-boy fury seems tamed here.
The movie tries to have it both ways and comes out addled and sweet. There are some scathingly funny exchanges between Randal and Dante, as the former vents against ``The Lord of the Rings " trilogy and tries to insist that the phrase ``porch monkeys" is not a racial slur. Cue Wanda Sykes as an outraged customer to straighten him out, as well as Ben Affleck and Jason Lee in pitch-perfect cameos.
At the same time, Smith impulsively throws in a musical number -- you start out shaking your head in disbelief, but it keeps getting bigger and bigger, and you finally give in -- and he slowly raises the stakes in Dante's relationship with Becky. The word ``love" is tossed around more than once, even by -- horrors! -- Randal.
Has Kevin Smith gone soft? Yes and no. True, he lets Dante pour his soul out late in the film, with a passion the one time Quick Stop clerk would have scorned (and which unregenerate ``Clerks" fans will probably ridicule). But please note that the scene takes place against the (unseen) backdrop of a live sex act with a donkey. So what if you can't go home again? According to ``Clerks II," home is wherever you park your ass.


If you're a fan of Clerks , the convenience-store slacker comedy made for $27,000 that, in 1994, established Kevin Smith as the who-needs-a-budget-when-you've-got-attitude?  auteur of his generation, then you'll probably want to see Clerks II . Yet it's precisely devotees of the Smith universe (porn jokes, cruddy camera angles, surprise flights of grunge eloquence, more porn jokes) who have a right to be wary of a Clerks  sequel. Can Smith, after finding fame and fortune beyond the mini-mall parking lots of New Jersey, now successfully revive the talky, dead-zone limbo of postadolescent wage slaves whose lives are going nowhere? Can he recapture the store-as-movie-set authenticity of the original film? How about its innocently sacrilegious horndog wit?
The answer, of course, is that Kevin Smith can recapture all of this  or, at least, enough of it to make Clerks II  an agreeable mischievous romp instead of a rip-off  because he never truly abandoned it in the first place. Clerks II , unlike Clerks , has been shot in color and given the semblance of a plot  will Dante Hicks grow up into a responsible citizen?  but really, the movie, like Clerks , is a low-budget excuse for talk: dirty talk, dorky talk, obsessive pop-culture talk (which is better, The Lord of the Rings  or Star Wars ?), great gushing geysers of talk, much of it prickly and obscene and hilarious and, in that Kevin Smith way, so smart about being stupid that the characters' verbosity becomes, in every sense, their saving grace.
In Clerks II , the Quick Stop has been closed down due to a fire. Dante (Brian O'Halloran), the neurotically rational, wheel-spinning underachiever who looks like Charlie Sheen after being whacked with a geek stick, and Randal (Jeff Anderson), that spiky, even less evolved specimen of dedicated...uh, randiness, now work the counter of a Mooby's fast-food franchise. They wear goofy purple uniforms that, if possible, mock their status even more than the Godot-at-the-Ring Dings-rack atmosphere of the convenience store did. Slinging burgers and onion rings to the rare customer who wanders into the place, they jabber, in their nothing-matters/everything-matters way, about such vital topics as Transformers, the Proustian joy of go-carts, the issue of whether two particular body parts should ever meet during sex, and also whether either of these two human zeds plans to get, you know, a future.
Dante, at least, wants one. At 33, he has a tawny, domineering fiancée (Jennifer Schwalbach), and he's planning to go with her to Florida, where he's to spend his life running a car wash. The complicating factor is Dante's boss, played by Rosario Dawson  convincing as a rival love interest, though not necessarily as the manager of a Mooby's. The romantic plot is standard-issue, but the real love story  the one between Dante and Randal  is brought to a satisfying, even touching, conclusion. And I haven't even mentioned the donkey sex, or the way Jay (Jason Mewes), with boom-box backup from Silent Bob (Smith), massages his nips as he replays the killer's dance from The Silence of the Lambs . Talk about touching.

 The 1990’s, you may recall, were a golden age of cheaply made movies about white guys in their 20’s sitting around doing nothing. This is not a genre that has spawned very many sequels. The white guys who made those movies either faded away, went on to bigger things or kept making variations on the same picture again and again.  Viewed alongside his peers, Kevin Smith, the director of “Clerks” and now, 12 years later, of “Clerks II,” seems both typical and exceptional. After the success of “Clerks,” his debut, a black-and-white study in suburban convenience-store stasis  made for $27,000, he did go on to bigger (though not always better) things: among them “Mallrats,” “Chasing Amy,” “Dogma” and “Jersey Girl.” But he also kept coming back to the themes and attitudes — and to a few of the characters — that made “Clerks” an especially durable example of its type.  So “Clerks II” — which begins in familiar black and white, at the familiar Quick Stop minimarket in Leonardo, N.J., before switching to color and a fast-food restaurant down the road — can be taken either as Mr. Smith’s sentimental homecoming or as evidence of arrested development. His filmmaking technique, charmingly rudimentary when he started out, has not developed very far, but then again aesthetic polish has never been among his priorities.  He does however put the money at his disposal (not a whole lot, by the look of things, but certainly quite a bit more than $27,000) to good use, shelling out for some tasty music permissions, an imaginative custom-built set (designed by Robert Holtzman), a trained donkey (don’t ask) and, to give an aerial perspective on his show-stopping musical number, a crane.  Which is not to say that he has sold out. On the contrary, what makes “Clerks II” both winning and (somewhat unexpectedly) moving is its fidelity to the original “Clerks” ethic of hanging out, talking trash and refusing all worldly ambition. If anything, the sequel is more defiant in its disdain for the rat race, elevating the white-guy-doing-nothing prerogative from a lifestyle choice to a moral principle. This principle is upheld by Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Mr. Smith), fixtures of the director’s universe, who function as Greek chorus and comic relief, interrupting the usual barrage of non sequiturs and smutty jokes with even more gratuitous filth and absurdity.  But the chief defender of the virtues of obnoxious laziness — most notably in a ringing, utterly sincere speech that provides the film’s emotional climax — is Randal (Jeff Anderson), the less responsible half of the underachieving twosome whose lives seem not to have changed much since the first movie. Along with his best friend, Dante (Brian O’Halloran), Randal has transferred his cynical, lazy carcass from the Quick Stop to Mooby’s, a hamburger franchise whose product names are both revolting and eerily plausible. (The signature dessert is called a Cow Pie.) Dante, always more of a worrier and a planner than his buddy, is finally ready to move on. He is about to quit Jersey for Florida with Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach), his jittery, domineering fiancée, whose father has promised Dante a job.  Complicating the plan is Dante’s devotion to Becky (Rosario Dawson), the Mooby’s manager, whose toenails he paints in the back office. The conventional romantic-comedy outlines of the story emerge almost casually, and they are camouflaged by the film’s humor, which is gleefully and abrasively obscene.  Ms. Dawson, a good sport as well as a nimble actress (her professionalism is really what holds “Clerks II” together) first appears on screen in the middle of a grossly candid discussion of sexual etiquette, to which she contributes her point of view without blushing or breaking stride.  Mr. Smith’s fondness for jokes about excrement, bestiality and related topics is so evidently childish that it is hard to be offended, or even especially provoked, when he tries to test the limits of taste. Unlike “Dogma,” his misunderstood satire on religion, “Clerks II” is not really interested in smashing taboos or exposing hypocrisy. The characters talk dirty as a way of passing the time, dispelling boredom and expressing their squeamish fascination with the messy weirdness of being human.  Randal, blithely stomping through the minefield of contemporary cultural sensitivities, is the most extreme dramatic embodiment of this sensibility. His social interactions are almost entirely abusive, especially when it comes to Elias (Trevor Fehrman), a delicate 19-year-old Christian “Lord of the Rings” fan who completes the Mooby’s work force.  Randal’s jokes at Elias’s expense are cruel (and very funny), but they also point toward the buried spring of pathos that bubbles ever closer to the surface as the movie wanders toward its end. Randal and Dante, after all, are no longer feckless 20-somethings. They are a few years into their 30’s, at an age where a lack of ambition can start to look cowardly and pathetic, less a form of resistance to social norms than a sign of psychic defeat.  As I get older, I find myself less and less sympathetic to movies that celebrate the revolt against adulthood, which have more to do with promoting an endless hedonistic consumerism than with any meaningful assertion of individual freedom. But Mr. Smith’s sincerity is disarming, and his love for his characters, even at their weakest or meanest, is hard not to share.  In the years since “Clerks” he has become a husband (he married Ms. Schwalbach in 1999) and father, as well as something of a Hollywood player, and a glimmer of tolerant adult wisdom shines through the scatology and willful immaturity. “Clerks II” has a dirty mind, but its heart is pure.  “Clerks II” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompany parent or adult guardian). It has abundant obscenity and crude sexual humor. I can’t even talk about the donkey.
It's Dante and Randal who strike back in "Clerks II," a softer, flabbier and considerably higher-budgeted follow-up to Kevin Smith's 1994 indie sensation that nevertheless packs enough riotous exchanges and pungent sexual obscenities to make its 97 minutes pass by with ease. Politically incorrect raspberries and the umpteenth appearance of Jay and Silent Bob aside, a gentle feeling of nostalgia pervades this hit-or-miss sequel, which relocates the gang to the ninth circle of fast-food restaurant hell. "Clerks" cultists will need no kicks in the groin to step up to the counter for this second go-round, courtesy of the Weinstein Co.
Brief prologue neatly dispenses with both the Quick Stop supermarket and the black-and-white aesthetic from the original film, forcing New Jerseyites Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) to move on to the Technicolor glory of Mooby's. Behind the counter of this cow-themed burger joint (where menu items are prefaced with words like "udderly delicious"), affable Dante and confrontational motor-mouth Randal continue their routine of doing nothing in particular, occasionally reporting to manager Becky Scott (a sassy Rosario Dawson). Dante has grown unusually close to Becky in recent months, despite the fact that he's engaged to a perky control freak (played by Smith's real-life wife, Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) and intends to start a new life with her down in Florida.
The use of color may strike some auds as a concession to the mainstream (the first "Clerks" wore its grungy monochrome like a badge of honor), as might the prominently played and occasionally gooey scenes of romantic flirtation between Dante and Becky, some of which involve toenail-painting. Yet if "Clerks II" doesn't have quite the scabrous kick of its predecessor, the chance to revisit a classic premise must have renewed the writer in Smith, whose banter here often achieves a sharpness and quality that haven't been in evidence since 1999's "Dogma."
In addition to all the gags, quips and extended rants about subjects like masturbation, anal-oral contact, bestiality, sex with pickles, and the difference between Anne Frank and Helen Keller, Smith is at his best as a self-implicating satirist of geek culture. The apex is a genuinely inspired debate between Randal and lower-ranking employee Elias (Trevor Fehrman) about the relative merits of "Star Wars" vs. "Lord of the Rings" ("They're three movies about walking!").
What's missing is a colorful gallery of customers comparable to those who wandered in and out of the Quick Stop in the original pic. The best "Clerks II" can do is cough up brief cameos from Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, as well as a typically noisy display of attitude from Wanda Sykes. And of course, drug-dealing, wall-leaning duo Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) are back in the flesh, still contributing nothing to society in mildly amusing fashion.
As a director, Smith's visual command remains strictly rudimentary, though perfectly suited to his ambitions. Final scene, which briefly reverts back to black-and-white, has the wistful feel of both a return and a farewell.

 With: Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith.
 


 

Two weeks ago a colleague insisted that Superman Returns  isn't a remake of the 1978 original, but a reinterpretationits melancholy flip side. Where the Christopher Reeve  model was pop art and a cool breeze, the Brandon Routh  version is heavy and solemn, weighed down by the responsibilities that come with growing up and moving on.
Maybe that's how one should also approach Kevin Smith 's Clerks II not because Smith wrote a script for an aborted Superman  sequel, but because his new movie's a note-for-note cover of its predecessor, 1994's Clerks, the charmingly crude black-and-white heap upon which Smith built his frustratingly uneven career as a maker of cult favorites about average people leading below-average lives. At times, Clerks II  can't even qualify as a remake, because it's little more than a recycling effort. If the footage weren't in color this time and if the actors reprising their roles were a little thinner, you'd swear this outing was cobbled together from outtakes.
But Smith acolytes would insist that is the point: Here we are, a decade later, and nothing has changed for Dante Hicks  (Brian O'Halloran ) and Randal Graves  (Jeff Anderson ). The movie begins where its predecessor left off, with Dante schlepping to work at the Quick Stop in New Freakin' Jersey. Randal still works at the video store next door. They're still go-nowhere men, moved off-site only by the inferno that devours the Quick Stop during Clerks II' s opening moments. But they crawl only as far as Mooby's, the fast-food joint featured in other Smith films, because, try as the writer-director might to escape his View Askewniverse, he can take only right turns.
And there they stay, doing the same shit they did in the first movieonly, somehow and inexplicably, less so. Dante, once more, is torn between two women: his fiancée, Emma (Smith's wife, Jennifer Schwalbach , who should never try to act again), and his boss, Becky (Rosario Dawson , who deserves a bonus). The former promises him an escape from New Jersey: She is ready to drive him down to Florida, where her family awaits with a new job, a new house, and a new life that will likely involve fewer discussions about the etiquette of going ass-to-mouth and debates over which was better, the Star Wars  movies or the Lord of the Rings  trilogy. Becky, whose toenails Dante paints while Randal teases virgin doofus Elias (Trevor Fehrman ) and offends customers with offhanded talk of porn and "porch monkeys," offers only true love and Jersey. Well, that and she can deliver dialogue without sounding like she's reading a foreign tongue translated onto cue cards being held up three miles away.
So, yeah, even as they're going through the motionsand even as Jay (Jason Mewes ) and Silent Bob (Smith) are still dealing dope in the parking lothanging over the proceedings are the melancholy musings of a filmmaker revisiting old haunts while trying to leave them behind for the promise of something different, if not better. This is the kind of movie one expected from Smith after the middlebrow sitcom Jersey Girl , in which he found himself smacked down by the fans who wanted nothing to do with his move toward domestication. He had little choice but to go back to the Quick Stop; that's what viewers wantedanother prolonged dick joke sprinkled with comic-shop small talk.
Smith's heart is in it, but it's sort of a broken heart now; Clerks II  feels as though it was made by a man who needs a change but isn't permitted to make one. Part of that is his own fault: He's too erratic a writer and too flaccid a director to balance the smirky-dirty humor with the schmaltzy sensitive shit. You want to give him credit for trying, for going back home and pushing his friends out into the real world. It's such a nice thought especially the way Smith handles Randal, who's the star here in the same way Dante was in Clerks . Randal is still a pustule of lewd ruminations, but he can't bear the thought of Dante abandoning him, so he acts like a spurned girlfriend, unconsciously scheming to sabotage his pal's impending departure. Twelve years on, the cutout cutup has depth and dimension.
Yet Clerks II  is as clumsy and junky as the first movie, and there's no excuse for it at this late date; Smith has made too many movies that cost too much money to keep hoping the camera's in the right place or that the scene of the dude fucking the donkey's gonna work when jammed next to the prolonged exchange between Randal and Dante in which they reveal how they really feel about each other. Clerks II can't bear the strain of its amateur-hour theatrics, no matter how big its heart or how many crocodile tears it manages to squirt. The dramatic moments become melodramatic; the bawdy moments turn icky. The fans will eat it up.
