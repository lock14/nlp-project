Watching Jennifer Garner produces a strange cognitive dissonance: Why would such a nice girl want to put her boot in your throat? On "Alias" she plays a spy. In "Elektra," which opens today, she plays an assassin. And the only difference between Garner's new movie and her four-year-old television show is that the movie is boring. In it, she does all the stuff you can see her do on Wednesday nights -- namely, some of her own stunt work in outrageous costumes -- but without an ounce of zeal, charisma, or purpose.
As she sashays, mirthlessly, from one thankless confrontation to the next, it's unclear why anyone would find Garner any more deserving of stardom than certain mannequins. And the vehicle she's chosen for herself is like an Atkins edition of "Charlie's Angels" -- entirely sugar-free.
"Elektra" has risen from the ashes of 2003's "Daredevil," which aroused similar feelings of "whatever." Though that movie at least had the rambunctious Colin Farrell in it, this spinoff is even more vestigial and curiously superfluous, like a third nipple, sixth finger, or another Hilton sister: Who asked for this?
In "Daredevil," Garner's Elektra Natchios lost her father and fell for the blind superhero played by Ben Affleck. She died in that movie, but for the spinoff she's been reborn (rather inexplicably, I might add) with the help of Terence Stamp. He plays Stick, her guru in matters of physical and spiritual wellness. After teaching her martial artistry, he ends up expelling her from his academy, where she was the most violent student and the only non-Asian boy, for not knowing "the Way." Based on Garner's humorlessness, lack of vocal inflection, and generally bland disposition, "the Way" she has yet to grasp seems to be that of acting.
Not that the film's plot leaves room for much of that. After being kicked out by Stick, Elektra becomes a hired killer fond of fighting in a silly-looking silken costume. Her latest assignment from her agent, McCabe (Colin Cunningham), is to schlep out to an idyllic lakefront cabin and bump off a sexy single dad, played by the "ER" actor Goran Visnjic, and his nosy tweener daughter (Kirsten Prout). But for reasons that remain unexpressed, Elektra can't quite bring herself to complete the job.
Because the movie has to have something to do during its final hour, another group of assassins shows up and -- sigh -- Elektra has to stop them. This leads to a kooky revelation about the family that reminded me of that old Eddie Murphy jalopy "The Golden Child." (And while we're back in time: Elektra and Stick's scenes together were better as part of "The Next Karate Kid.")
The script for "Elektra" is attributed to three writers. Presumably, each new scribe came along and deleted the work of his predecessor, until all that remained was this raggedy story. Rob Bowman, the director, has a long television career that includes a definitive stretch helming a slew of "X-Files" episodes. He never finds his footing here. There's almost nothing graceful or visually witty, and the fight sequences feel cribbed from far superior films. Worse, he seems to have encouraged his star to pour herself into the physical rigors but none of the human ones. All the emoting is saved for the overblown flashbacks, in which we're shown Elektra's dead mother and the devilish creature that may have killed her.
"Elektra" has the misfortune of following other movies about women who know how to leave a nasty bruise, everything from the incomparable (Ziyi Zhang in "Hero" and "The House of Flying Daggers" and Uma Thurman in "Kill Bill") to the incompetent (Halle Berry in "Catwoman" and Milla Jovovich in "Resident Evil"). In theory, Garner should be in the same company as Thurman and especially Zhang, who truly makes innocence look fatal. But Garner exists purely as a physical specimen in peak condition. Yes, that's her doing one-armed pullups and rope jumping her keister off. But Garner sprints through her lines, too, swallowing the last words in a sentence or steamrolling over ones in the middle.
Her physical comedy in last year's "13 Going on 30" had its charms. She at least seemed to have an inner vitality that she was eager to share. That movie was the only recent one of hers where she didn't seem like American Girl's wholesome gun-toting doll. We get that Garner can snap our necks, but she seems more programmed to do so (by men, most likely) than driven by fury, pain, lust, or joy. In "Elektra," in particular, she's like the Stepford assassin, the girl next door with nobody home.


         Director Rob Bowman's Elektra doesn't have a complex. She has disorders. She's an obsessive-compulsive workaholic celibate with daddy issues. (Not to be confused with a daddy "fixation," which might inspire more freewheeling behavior). She's a Tri-Delt, in other words. If she weren't a ninja assassin she'd work in publishing and cry after sex.
 
  What is it about comic book supergirls and big-budget action heroines that compels screenwriters and directors to condemn them to lives of neurotic monasticism? Would it kill a tough girl to crack a smile or eat a Twinkie or make a pass once in a while? Does she have to be a squinty jerk with intimacy issues in order to be considered super? These and other questions are raised, but never answered, by "Elektra," who, for an ultraviolent "nimbo" (that's ninja bimbo, for the uninitiated) who does her salaried killing in a red satin teddy and stiletto heels, is no fun at all.
 


         






    Originally created by legendary Marvel Comics writer Frank Miller in 1980, the comic book Elektra (a distant but simpatico relation to the Hellenic myth, presumably) is the daughter of a Greek ambassador and his unfaithful wife, Christina. She grows up to become Daredevil's lover, dies, and is brought back to life in her own lurid limited series.
 
  In the comic, terrorists murder her beloved father, and only remaining parent, and Elektra turns to a life of salaried crime. Far be it from Fox, though, to promote such cynicism and sluttishness in what it hopes will be a major new franchise starring a squeaky-clean Jennifer Garner. Perhaps in an effort to clean up the role (she's a killer, OK, but other than that she's a nun), Bowman and screenwriters Zak Penn and Stuart Zicherman & Raven Metzner have decided to rehabilitate Elektra's mom's checkered reputation: Instead of being shot in half while dozing placid and pregnant on a Greek beach, she's killed during her noonday nap in a Greek-themed American mansion. The deed is done by a beastly representative of the Hand, an evil ninja syndicate, and young Elektra discovers the body and is forever haunted by the image of her saintly, martyred mom. Turning the rage inward in the manner of anorexics worldwide, she gives herself over to exercise, OCD and loneliness.
 
  Why Fox has taken a character named Elektra and given her a mommy fixation is anybody's guess. As for daddy, he's not the lovable parent of the book but a tyrannical sports-dad who repeatedly appears onscreen in flashback just to scream at her from the side of the pool. Presumably, he's still among the living, though obviously estranged.
 
  Miller's Elektra lived in a world of greed and near-total corruption. But Bowman's Elektra inhabits the same old dualistic Bushworld we keep hearing about in White House news conferences: "Since time began," a voice informs us at the start of the movie, "a war has been waged in the shadows between the forces of good and evil." But only good has decent representation. Yes, Elektra has an agent — the weaselly McCabe (Colin Cunningham), who says things like, "You're crashing on me, baby. I said you were crashing on me and you're crashing on me." This sort of thing makes him either one of the best or the worst things about "Elektra" — which patently refuses to give itself over to gaudy melodrama but occasionally settles on low-key camp.
 
  Bowman lets his ghostly ninja keep the get-up depicted in the book (and omitted in "Daredevil"), but he bleeds as much of the Miller darkness from the story as he can. The movie is not so much tenebrous as it is adolescently surly. Despite an introductory sequence in which Elektra dispatches a man patiently awaiting death in front of a roaring fire, she spends much of the movie's first half brooding, counting and arranging things just so. (You half expect her to jog to Joni Mitchell, eat an apple and throw it up.) Her performance is so clenched, steely and bloodless I found myself agreeing with her agent's rather crassly suggested method of relaxation.
 
  She never takes his advice, of course, though she does thaw to room temperature upon meeting Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby Miller (Kirsten Prout), a father and daughter living on a remote island. All it takes is one not-so-friendly dinner with the gifted teenager and her handsome dad (who spends most of the movie kicking dirt on the sidelines) for Elektra's maternal instincts to come alive. This bovine vision of female comic book heroism is especially dispiriting considering Garner's prior experience in the genre. As Sydney, on ABC's spy series "Alias," Garner fights badness, wears good outfits and enjoys a personality and a love life all at the same time.
 
  From then on, she has a mission, and it's not the one her agent got her. Hired to kill them both, Elektra opts instead to save them, setting in motion the deployment of a parade of comic book supervillains led by her judo-robe wearing nemesis Kirigi (Will Yun Lee). The villains — Kinkou (Edson T. Ribeiro), the man who can't be knocked down; Tattoo (Chris Ackerman), who commands the animals inked on his skin to leave his body and do his bidding; Typhoid (Natassia Malthe), a Poison Ivy act-alike who causes everything in her path to wither and die; and Stone (Bob Sapp), who is large and in charge — look like refugees from a Crunch Fitness staff retreat, and for a moment it seems like they'll help raise "Elektra's" heart rate. By the time they arrive, though, the movie has all but sputtered to a halt.
 
  As Stick, the sensei
 who taught Elektra to fight, Terence Stamp seems to waver between sightedness and blindness, and his character is as vague and yet somehow familiar as the movie's rote plot. We know he trained Elektra, we know he banished her, but other than that, we don't know much — except that sometimes he plays pool with guys who look like Gillette models, and he's been waiting for his angry student to calm down and discover her own inner purity.
 
  "Elektra" is so bogged down by its heroine's rancid mood, it takes nearly the length of the movie for her to whip off her outer garments and get down to lingerie-fighting. Her big showdown with evil transpires on the site of her ancestral home, apparently the same place Victoria's Secret rented out for those TV ads. I kept waiting for Bob Dylan to pop up, but there were just more ninjas, quickly dispatched. Will the surly, emotionally stunted, Type A superheroine resonate with audiences? Maybe, though I got the feeling that the big moment of audience identification would probably come when she said of her young protégé, "Please don't let her turn out like me."

The security guard on the lookout for movie critics who might moonlight as video pirates during a recent screening of Elektra  supplied more diverting action than Elektra herself, and that's not good. He was just a gray-haired guy on the clock, and she's a Marvel Comics action heroine played by iron-jawed changeling/Alias  star Jennifer Garner. He wore an anonymous navy blue jacket, and she crouches and leaps in a cunning red bustier picked from Madonna's castoffs. He lugged only night-vision goggles, while she wields fancy three-pronged daggers and steely glances on her rounds as a contract killer  an assassin who shakes up the natural order of this comic-book universe when she decides to protect the lives of a father (ER 's Goran Visnjic) and daughter (Canadian TV actress Kirsten Prout) she's supposed to eliminate. The guard had a strange and interesting  job to do; she did not.
Once, Elektra was Daredevil's squeeze (I dare you to remember Daredevil), and then she was dead, and then she was returned to life through the mystical ministrations of a blind guru (Terence Stamp). But you know what? Just as all regular models can't be supermodels, so all action chicks can't be superheroines. Elektra Natchios turns out to be walled off rather than mysteriously alluring; blank rather than deep. And since no spirit flows through Elektra , who's dammed up in a way Garner avoided in 13 Going on 30 , it follows that no spirit flows through Elektra, either. The psychotherapeutic subplot in which she works out her own childhood trauma through her relationship with the (rather super) girl whose life she saves doesn't make her any happier; the jumpy pace established by Reign of Fire  director Rob Bowman doesn't enhance the impersonal special effects. Chased by evil henchmen from the dark-side syndicate known as The Hand, Elektra girds her loins with less intensity of purpose than if she were scanning the darkness for signs of copyright infringement.

he latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, "Elektra" stars Jennifer Garner as a superheroine who dons fetish-wear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. "Your parents must have had a sense of humor," the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no they did not and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. Created in the 1980's by the comic-book auteur Frank Miller while he was working on Marvel's "Daredevil," Elektra initially popped up as the titular superhero's onetime romantic foil turned nemesis. Decades later she showed up again, this time in the barely watchable potboiler of the same name starring Ben Affleck. Mr. Affleck, wearing an unfortunately snug get-up more appropriate for a Las Vegas showboy, was the hero of that flick, but Ms. Garner was its saving grace. The actress stole every one of her scenes and for her troubles has now been rewarded the starring role in its equally dreary spinoff. What a waste, not only because Elektra should and could seriously rock - she is, after all, a na�ve college student turned ninja assassin - but also because Ms. Garner can and sometimes does. Female superheroes are a strange breed. There are all sorts of reasons for this, including that culturally there's always something disturbing, even disrupting about a woman who walks (or flies) alone. That may explain why so many female superheroes travel in gendered packs or hook up with supermen. (Remember, before she donned that cute red, white and blue suit, Wonder Woman was hanging with the sisters on Paradise Island.) Given its track record when it comes to women, it's no surprise that Hollywood has failed to create superheroines as richly conceived as those running around on television or in Hong Kong cinema, where for decades alpha gals have been soaring through the air and kicking up their high heels to battle villainy and, often times, their own personal demons. Hollywood has a fairly miserable track record when it comes to superheroes too, as witnessed by the diminution of the "Batman" franchise (soon to be reborn) and the overrated "X-Men" movies. Still, the need for new female stars with smiles as wide and inviting as that of Julia Roberts is urgent enough that you would have expected the studio releasing "Elektra" to have demanded as much creativity from the movie's director, Rob Bowman, and screenwriters - Zak Penn, Stuart Zicherman and Raven Metzner - as from its costume designer, Lisa Tomczeszyn, and Ms. Garner's personal trainer, Valerie Waters. Mr. Miller's Elektra doesn't have the pedigree of the character conceived by Euripides and Sophocles, but she's the type of creation - moral conflict plus hot bod - that could have executives laughing all the way to the bank. There are a few laughs in "Elektra," principally because the script is a joke. The story, such as it is, involves the brooding love interest (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter (a miscast Kirsten Prout), who are the target of a shadowy group called the Hand. A mostly Asian gang that treads dangerously close to stereotype of the Fu Manchu variety, the Hand is ruled over by the fine actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Mr. Tagawa doesn't have much to do except look mysterious; his character leaves his dirty work to a group of murderous youngsters with names like Tattoo and Typhoid, who try to glower menacingly while wearing too much eyeliner and come accompanied with some tacky and very unpersuasive special effects. No question, the film's best special effect is Ms. Garner, especially when she's in costume. As Edna Mode, the pint-sized costume designer in "The Incredibles," explains, it's the costume that makes the superhero, and that holds true here. Like many comic-book women, Elektra usually looks like she was drawn by a man with a deep familiarity with the oeuvre of Russ Meyer. Ms. Tomczeszyn has swapped the character's bondage-wear for something that brings to mind a Valentine's Day window display at Victoria's Secret, but the general principle (hot bod) remains. It's worth noting that whenever Elektra slips on her satiny outfit, she also puts down her long hair, which you would think would impede her warrior skills. It never does. That must be some kind of superconditioner. "Elektra" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film shows Ms. Garner in various stages of very modest undress and has some mild violence.

Jennifer Garner's Elektra was clearly the most memorable thing about "Daredevil," so they revived her from apparent death and jettisoned her horned boyfriend. Yet solo adventure "Elektra" proves no more than fitfully satisfying, a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot. Garner's ascendant star, eye-catching billboards and a relatively modest budget should yield a respectable bounty as the pic fights its way through various forms of exhibition, but additional Lazarus-like resurrections appear unlikely.
In theory, there should be something liberating about adapting more obscure comicbook creations to the bigscreen, inasmuch as they arrive burdened with fewer expectations and preconceived notions. After "Elektra" and "The Punisher," however, consideration needs to be given to capturing the dark streaks in these Marvel properties without bleaching out most of the fun.
Despite a promising start, ultimately this tale of an icy assassin who becomes a young girl's protector feels alternately too talky to triumph as an action vehicle and too frenetic to be fleshed out to succeed as a drama.
Trained as a ninjalike warrior after her mother's murder (recounted in a series of flashbacks), Elektra is introduced in a smooth sequence showcasing precisely how dangerous she can be, as she overcomes multiple guards en route to her quarry. Lightning quick, she wields a pair of three-pronged knives called sais
, perfect for as much shish-kebabbing as a PG-13 rating will allow. (The bad guys conveniently disappear in puffs of smoke once eliminated, reducing the post-fight mess.)
Soon, though, she is hired to kill 13-year-old Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her father (Goran Visnjic), targets of the Hand, a shadowy organization opposed by Elektra's former mentor, Stick (Terence Stamp) and his equally chopsocky cohort.
Determined to save the girl, Elektra faces a formidable team of adversaries under the stewardship of Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), whose now-you-seen-him, now-you-don't antics parallel her own.
Director Rob Bowman cut his teeth on "The X-Files," but the moody atmosphere (aided immeasurably by Christophe Beck's percussive score) can't mask the film's shortcomings in the later reels. Once the action finally kicks in, too much of it lacks the requisite excitement and, frankly, the most intriguing villains get dispatched too easily.
Established as an action heroine in her TV series "Alias," Garner could be that rarest of female stars -- comfortably flitting from a charming turn in the romantic comedy "13 Going on 30" to bad-ass action roles where she can put those enviably sculpted abs to use. But "Elektra" affords her only limited opportunities to flex much more than her pouting muscles, combined with an inordinately purposeful strut.
Glimpses of wit do emerge from the trio of credited writers, such as Elektra's deadpan explanation that her work involves "payroll deductions." Who knew, moreover, that assassins employ agents who settle for 10% of the gross?
Still, the film can't sustain any sense of rhythm in the way, say, that the "X-Men" films managed to do. That's despite first-rate physical trappings, from the lush forest scenery (shot in Vancouver) to Garner's form-flattering costumes.
Bringing comicbooks to life always represents a particular challenge, with words and images that don't quite survive the leap from page to screen. "Elektra" earnestly tries to complete that jump but, once the fighting's over, can't quite stick the landing.

When contract assassin Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner ) arrives to fillet a target with her trusty sais , it turns out her prey has been expecting her. "I guess it's all true," he says. "The red outfit, the knives." By now, the rote adaptation of second-tier Marvel is a slow-season tradition meant to satiate comic book fans while they wait for the summer blockbuster (in this case, July's Fantastic Four ). The pedestrian Elektra offers no surprises, and whether or not you'll appreciate its modest charms depends entirely on whether you too have been anticipating Garner's new outfit.
On the still-underrated TV series Alias , Garner plays CIA  agent Sydney Bristow , whose undercover assignments require more costume changes than a Cher  concert. But besides techno-goth fashion, Alias  is about a vexed father-daughter relationship, not unlike the one Elektra had with papa Natchios, who was slain in 2003's dismal Daredevil , but who appears here (different actor) in flashbacks to our anti-heroine's manse youth. Garner's Elektra is what vulnerable Syd might look like if she went roguea remote, ascetic killer.
Director Rob Bowman  squanders the impressive comic facility Garner demonstrated in 13 Going on 30 , saddling her with the OCD behavior and portentous self-control of a Michael Mann  character. The nominal story, wrapped in more unnecessary Star Wars  allusions than Bowman's last feature, Reign of Fire , revolves around a supernatural cabal called the Hand, which wants to turn a teenage girl with prodigious ninja abilities to the dark side, or else destroy her.
