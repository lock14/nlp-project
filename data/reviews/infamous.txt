Comparisons are inevitable, although they're not truly necessary. The last couple of years have bestowed two Truman Capote pictures on the moviegoing public, and not only that, both movies concentrate on the same period of the writer's life ï¿½ the years during which Capote worked on his stylistically groundbreaking book In Cold Blood
. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman received the Best Actor Oscar for his shape-shifting turn as the diminutive author, that doesn't preclude British actor Jones from also turning in a marvelous performance as the distinctive writer. Director McGrath has based the Infamous
 screenplay on George Plimpton's book about Capote. The finished film places a greater emphasis on Capote's sexuality than the earlier film does, creating a character whose brazen queerness becomes an issue for those he encounters but not for the man himself. This leads to speculative sequences in which there's a hearty lip-lock between Capote and incarcerated murderer Perry Smith (played by Craig, the next James Bond), as well as implications that further sexual contact might have occurred. Capote's slow demise during the time in which he waited for the book to be published and the years afterward, in which he published nothing of consequence for the rest of his life, is subtly implied by the movie to be the result of his agonizing love for the killer. The second half of the movie is filled with these sorts of questions, yet they are all left basically unanswered. The sense in which the movie really shines is in its portrait of milieus: the New York society whirl in which Capote was a shining light and the Kansas farm town in which Capote and his writing companion Harper Lee (Bullock) were citified fish out of water. The textures of the film feel so right, especially in its opening stroke: a nightclub scene at El Morocco in which Paltrow croons from the stage like a sultry Peggy Lee while backed by a house band featuring Austin musicians Mark Rubin and Glover Gill, among others (the movie was filmed in Austin), Capote and Weaver as Babe Paley, wife of the president of CBS, listen and dish. As Bennett Cerf, Bogdanovich also delivers another of his near-perfect impressions. Yet, McGrath employs a technique in which all these observers to the Capote myth speak directly to the camera, a ploy that probably helps capture the cut-and-paste tone of Plimpton's work but does little to help advance the film narrative. Nevertheless, Infamous
 successfully captures a sense of the loneliness of a writer's life. Capote may be surrounded by tout le monde, but in essence, he is just using them as a sounding board for his words before committing them to print.


Why, a year after ``Capote," would you want to see another movie about how Truman Capote came to write ``In Cold Blood"?
Because it's almost as good, for one thing.
It's certainly more obvious. As written and directed by Douglas McGrath (``Emma," ``Nicholas Nickleby"), based on the George Plimpton book ``Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career," ``Infamous" is a pungent, entertainingly poignant cartoon version of the same events covered in Bennett Miller's 2005 film. Rarely do battling productions -- these two were shot mere months apart -- result in equally valid films, but that's the case here.
The focus this time is only partially on the legendary writer's betrayal of journalism and his sources while turning the 1959 Clutter family killings into a best-selling ``non fiction novel." By probing the relationship between Capote and convicted murderer Perry Smith -- and by having in Daniel Craig a brooding, powerful Smith who cuts a more dramatic figure than Clifton Collins Jr. in the earlier movie -- ``Infamous" becomes a story of thwarted love between two shipwrecked men.
The film opens in a Manhattan nightclub, as Capote (Toby Jones) and his harem of power-women drink in the sounds of lounge singer Kitty Dee (Peggy Lee by any other name, played gamely by Gwyneth Paltrow) singing ``What Is This Thing Called Love?" That's the central question posed by ``Infamous": what is
 this thing called love? It flees from all who touch it, including socialites Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver) and Slim Keith (Hope Davis). Their boudoir misery becomes Truman's gossip -- the coin that keeps this court jester in business.
Capote has a comfortable long-term relationship with writer Jack Dunphy (John Benjamin Hickey), but there's a hole in his soul that he fills with ambition. Spying a newspaper account of the murders, the novelist departs for Kansas, towing childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock) along as an assistant.
So far, so familiar, but the pleasure of ``Infamous" is in its gallery of larger-than-life portrayals. Davis is miscast as the glittering Keith, but Weaver has great fun (Lee Ritchey plays her grumpy husband, CBS head William Paley), and Juliet Stevenson is a drop-dead delight as Diana Vreeland. In one of the many reminiscent ``interviews" that pepper the film, she describes Capote as ``what a Brussels sprout would sound like if a Brussels sprout could talk."
Isabella Rossellini and Peter Bogdanovich are in there too (as Marella Agnelli and Bennett Cerf respectively), and so is Jeff Daniels as Alvin Dewey, lead detective for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. But ``Infamous" is primarily a showcase for Jones, a diminutive character actor (``Finding Neverland") getting a welcome lead role here.
Comparisons are unavoidable. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning turn in ``Capote" was a thing of subtle malice and need; you sensed his Truman holding his cards to his chest and playing only the ones that mattered. Jones's Capote fans the whole deck for everyone to see.
Being the right physical size frees up the actor to camp outrageously and intelligently: He appears at the Kansas train stop like the Dowager Empress disembarking from the Orient Express, then turns up at the Dewey house in cowboy drag, calling the lawman ``Foxy." ``The DA doesn't take calls from strange women," a receptionist tells him over the phone. ``Who says I'm strange?" snaps Capote.
That Munchkin superiority is a mask for a misfit's pain, and ``Infamous" presses the case that the writer met a twisted soul mate in Smith. The scenes between the two are the dark heart of the movie and Craig is superb in them, conveying both tenderness and homicidal rage. In case you're still not sure the next James Bond is an actor of range and capability, here's your answer.
Bullock's Nelle is the conscious conscience of the movie -- she's softer, more thoughtful, and more present than Catherine Keener's version of the same character -- but when she scolds Truman that ``reportage is creating, not re-creating," you miss the nuances of Dan Futterman's script for ``Capote."
Much more effective is the sequence, late in the film, in which the writer tells the same horrific anecdote about Smith to a succession of his wealthy friends and coolly checks off the variation that gets the best response. That's broad but it's brutal, and it effectively shows Capote editing emotion right out of his life. The tragedy in ``Infamous" -- one that the film comes close to fully grasping -- isn't what ``In Cold Blood" did to journalism, but what it did to Truman Capote. The title of his book, you realize, applies to him.


         As writers as diverse as Cervantes and Christopher Marlowe have noted, comparisons are odious, but in the case of "Infamous" and "Capote," they are also inevitable. Both films cover exactly the same period in author Truman Capote's life, so much so that "Infamous" was held out of release for a year to put some distance between the two films. Even a year, however, isn't long enough to disguise the gap in quality between the two. "Capote" not only did it first, it did it considerably better.
 
  It's not just that that film, nominated for five Oscars, including best picture (and a winner for Philip Seymour Hoffman in the best actor category), is a tough act to follow. As written and directed by Douglas McGrath, "Infamous" would be frustrating in all areas save one even if "Capote" had never been made.
 


         






    That weakness is not due to a lack of ambition. McGrath, whose previous films include the Gwyneth Paltrow-starring "Emma" and "Nicholas Nickleby," has tried a difficult maneuver, a change in tone that he accurately describes in the press notes as attempting a "shift from light to dark, from comic to tragic."
 
  McGrath is quite funny as a writer: He was Oscar-nominated for co-scripting "Bullets Over Broadway" with Woody Allen and he has a gift for lines, such as comparing his current situation to being "in the same predicament as those people who made the competing asteroid-hitting-the-Earth movies."
 
  The problem is that the first half of "Infamous" is nowhere near as comic as McGrath intends. Instead the picture gives off a tone of arch stylization that plays as artificial, overwrought and off-putting.
 
  This part of the film so lacks dimension and humanity, not to mention genuine humor, that neither the attempted seriousness of the second half nor the vivid performance by Daniel Craig as killer Perry Smith can possibly rescue or renew it.
 
  This difficulty is much in evidence in the casting of elfin British actor Toby Jones as Capote. He looks much more like the writer than Hoffman ever could, but while the difference made Hoffman work harder, the resemblance seems to have encouraged Jones to fall back into a kind of weird impersonation that verges on caricature and makes a hash of the writer's legendary ability to charm one and all.
 
  "Infamous' " difficulties begin in its opening sequence, which has Capote in the audience at El Morocco when singer Kitty Dean (a Paltrow cameo) stumbles over the lyrics of Cole Porter's "What Is This Thing Called Love" as, we presume, the reality of her life momentarily intrudes on her art. It's intended to be a foreshadowing of what happens to Capote, but because the emotion of the scene is held at a remove, the moment feels more studied than genuine.
 
  The same thing is true of the film's portrait of the writer's high society Manhattan world, shown in vignettes and imagined talking-head interviews with actors playing Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver), Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson), Slim Keith (Hope Davis), Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich) and others. Sandra Bullock, who plays lifelong friend Nelle Harper Lee, comes off better, but her attempt to give a serious performance is so at odds with the film's tone she too flounders in the end.
 
  Once Capote arrives in rural Kansas dripping with flamboyance, we get a new and rather unpleasant twist on the now-familiar tale of how he convinced detective Alvin Dewey (Jeff Daniels with little to do) to cooperate with him.
 
  "Infamous" portrays the residents of Holcomb, Kan., as wide-eyed yokels who are won over to Capote's side by his willingness to name-drop and share tidbits of gossip about his celebrity friends. Unlike its predecessor, this film projects a kind of supercilious dismissal and takes pleasure in sneering at the townspeople just as much as Capote himself might have.
 
  Beginning with Capote's spooky first visit to the murder victims' house, "Infamous" eventually sets out on its quest for a darker, more meaningful tone, but the first section has left such an unpleasant aftertaste that these stabs at seriousness are largely unconvincing.
 
  The only section where "Infamous" achieves the gravitas it is after is in its portrayal of Perry Smith, the killer Capote formed an emotional attachment to. As played by British actor Craig (powerful as Ted Hughes in "Sylvia" and slated to be the next James Bond), Smith comes across as a chilling dark force, fully capable of murder, and his interactions with Capote have a more dangerous edge than they did in the previous film.
 
  Though Craig's strong work is all it should be, without the appropriate foundation to build on, it can't help the film as much as it should. What one character says about Capote's book on the murders â "I thought the writing lacked kindness" â could be said, to its loss, about this film as well.

So much for my high-minded vow to avoid comparisons to Capote  when discussing Infamous : The latter's own promotional campaign recognizes  that thoughts of formidable Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman will inevitably arise at any mention of a new movie about the pint-size novelist with the outsize persona who wrote In Cold Blood . ''There's more to the story than you know,'' the  Infamous  ads promise, acknowledging that last year's popular, award-laden biodrama about how Capote researched and wrote his masterpiece is still vivid in the memory of those interested in this year's biodrama about how Capote researched and wrote his masterpiece. What more do we need to know about the Clutter-family murders in Holcomb, Kan., in the fall of 1959, the two killers who were eventually hanged for the crime, or the fish-out-of-water sight of a Southern-born, Manhattan-steeped novelist of screamingly effeminate plumage traipsing around the Midwest and changing the art of novelistic reportage forever more, at the expense of his complicated soul?
The added value that writer-director Douglas McGrath has in mind is gossip Â and a goggly interest in gossip becomes the glittering gimmick of Infamous , as well as its undoing as a work that can measure up to the rigorous, sophisticated understatement of Bennett Miller's Capote . Did you know that glamorous socialite Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver) sent the author (her favorite court jester and confidant) emergency rations of caviar? That she shipped delicacies to darkest flyover country while Capote (British stage actor Toby Jones, a physical doppelgÃ¤nger with a touch of frog about the eyes) was burrowing in with the Velveeta-cheese-eating townsfolk of Holcomb and forging ties with killers Perry Smith (Daniel Craig, playing the antiâJames Bond and unable to make sense of this strange gig) and Dick Hickock (Lee Pace)? Did you know that local detective Alvin Dewey (Jeff Daniels) fell into boyish swoons of fandom when Capote dropped the names of celebrity friends Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra? Or that the journalist and Perry shared a jailhouse kiss Â and an electric current of homosexual love, one yearning man to another?
I don't know if any of this is true, or if Mrs. Paley did teach her fellow socialite swingers to do the twist one madcap night. Truth, according to Infamous , has less to do with fact than with feeling, especially in the case of Mr. C. But I do know that McGrath invests almost all his storytelling capital in the contrast between lavishly staged scenes of vapid New York high life and a dark American melodrama of loneliness that turned one man into a killer, the other into a writer.
The filmmaker likes those conflicts clear and even charming Â a primer on early-1960s period manners both in New York nightclubs and at Kansas dinner tables, re-created with the same perkiness he brought to his delightful 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma . (Emma herself, Gwyneth Paltrow, croons a number in a partytrick cameo as a nightclub singer and then disappears.) Arriving by train in Kansas, Capote and his indispensable friend Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock) stare at the flat, low skyline as if the view were an art installation of Midwesterniana. (Bullock, costumed in mousy green sweaters and sad ankle socks, keeps herself nicely muted.) There's no stinting on set decoration and ambience; Infamous  is, in fact, prettier than Capote , with every visual detail more voluptuous than in last year's sparer version. Jones himself is more voluptuous in his mannerisms than Hoffman, too Â a perfectly good perf with the rotten luck to arrive second.
But that charm, flirting so cozily with satire in the New York scenes, doesn't know where to put itself in Holcomb. The newer movie (made at the same time as Capote , then put in a holding pattern until Oscar had safely left the room) revels too delightedly in both the time-capsule fame of the players and the real-life characters being played Â Peter Bogdanovich as publisher Bennett Cerf, Hope Davis as socialite Slim Keith, Isabella Rossellini as Euro society's Marella Agnelli, Bend  It Like Beckham 's Juliet Stevenson as Vogue  editor Diana Vreeland. (The key players are also interviewed, documentary-style, their accounts differing from time to time in another demonstration of the subjectivity of truth and the irresistibility of gossip.) Before long, the famous in Infamous  have overshot the movie's modest contours Â and that's even without the fame of Capote  singing like another, more haunting voice in another room.

 Truman Capote is surely a large enough figure â or perhaps I mean small enough â to fill out two motion pictures. Since multiple literary lives are the norm in book publishing, why not in the movies? Capote, a fascinating, sometimes appalling literary celebrity in his lifetime, has been posthumously served by two highly readable biographies, Gerald Clarkeâs elegantly written portrait and George Plimptonâs engrossing collage of interviews and recollections. Now those books have served as the scaffolding for cinematic interpretations of part of Capoteâs career that are not quite complementary, but also not really in competition with each other.  There is no reason to choose between Bennett Millerâs âCapote,â which came out almost exactly a year ago, and Douglas McGrathâs âInfamous,â which opens today. Both concentrate on the period, from the late 1950âs through the mid 60âs, during which Capote researched and wrote âIn Cold Blood.â And both stand out above the biopic pack. âInfamous, â the picture under consideration here, based on Plimptonâs book, is well worth your attention. It is quick-witted, stylish and well acted. The release of two movies on the same subject is somewhat unusual, and the arrival in close succession of two good movies that tell more or less identical stories, each one distinguished by real intelligence in conception and execution, is downright uncanny.  In Mr. McGrathâs version, Capote is played by Toby Jones as a clever imp of the Manhattan social scene. He describes himself as âa wind-up toyâ and is the pet and confidant of a loose network of lunching ladies, including Slim Keith (Hope Davis), Marella Agnelli (Isabella Rossellini) and Babe Paley (a divine Sigourney Weaver). (Capoteâs circle also includes the publisher Bennett Cerf, ebulliently played by Peter Bogdanovich.) Capoteâs betrayal of his friendsâ confidences is habitual, and more naughty than cruel. One day he happens upon a news article about a gruesome quadruple homicide â an entire family slaughtered â in a small Kansas town, and then. ...    Well, by now we know what happens next. In the company of his friend Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock, whose mellifluous Alabama accent, like the performance in which it is embedded, is a marvel of observant precision), Capote transplants himself to Holcomb, Kan., where the killings took place. There, some of the locals pretend to mistake him for a woman, while others recognize him as an ambassador from a faraway world of glitter and glamour. He brags that he once beat Humphrey Bogart at arm-wrestling, and his prowess when challenged by some skeptical Kansans is a sign of the strength and ferocity that lie beneath his goosey, fluttering surface.  Capoteâs character is illuminated by testimony from actors playing his friends and contemporaries, including a deliciously feline impersonation of the young Gore Vidal by Michael Panes. (When asked what he thought of Capoteâs writing, the real Vidal is supposed to have answered, âI have diabetes.â) Jeff Daniels is in fine, low-key form as Alvin Dewey, who leads the investigation of the murders and whose doughty Midwestern masculinity makes him an amusing (and frequently amused) foil for the writer.  Mr. Jonesâs impersonation is touching and credible, and his notion of the character is interestingly different from that of Philip Seymour Hoffman, star of âCapote.â In general, âInfamousâ is warmer and more tender, if also a bit thinner and showier, than âCapote,â which focused on the deep ethical questions raised by the writing of âIn Cold Bloodâ and emphasized the writerâs cold, manipulative narcissism.  The contrast between the two films is most apparent with respect to Capoteâs relationship with Perry Smith, one of the killers and a central character in âIn Cold Blood.â Daniel Craig, the next James Bond, endows Smith with a coiled, frightening sexual intensity. Unlike Clifton Collins Jr.âs volatile lost boy in the earlier film, Mr. Craigâs Smith is more predator than prey, even when heâs at Capoteâs mercy. Whereas Mr. Millerâs film explored Capoteâs power over Smith, Mr. McGrathâs reverses the charge, placing the writer very much in the killerâs thrall.  And also in love with him. The connection between them makes Capoteâs ambiguous inability to help Smith and his accomplice, Dick Hickok, as they moved toward execution a matter of weakness rather than callousness. Capoteâs book has overwhelmed him, and he is undone as much by sensitivity as by vanity.  âInfamousâ is less a parable of literary ethics than a showcase of literary personality, and it is in the end more touching than troubling. It does, however, contain one scene â the very first, as it happens â that is itself a small tour de force. Capote is at the El Morocco with Babe Paley, feasting his eyes and ears on a singer played by Gwyneth Paltrow (who vanishes from the picture as soon as her song is over). In midsong, her voice catches and falters, as if a real surge of bitter, unbidden feeling had disrupted the lyricâs smooth description of heartbreak. The nightclub audience, Capote included, holds its breath: are they witnessing something excruciating and real, or a performance whose mastery resides in its perfect mimicry of authentic, uncontrollable emotion? (And what exactly is the audience in the cinema looking at when we see a movie star playing a singer pretending to be a lovelorn, anonymous woman?)  Some related questions shadow âIn Cold Blood,â and for that matter Capote himself. The book is reportage, as he notoriously said, âusing the techniques of fiction.â And he himself was an actor in much of his life, adopting a persona that both was and wasnât his true (so to speak) self. No wonder he has proved so attractive to filmmakers and ambitious actors: he was, supremely and enigmatically, his own invention, and now heâs theirs to reinvent.  âInfamousâ is rated R. It has strong language, some violence and sexual references and situations.

Held back for a year to distance it from "Capote," which deals with the same period in the writer's life, "Infamous" inevitably won't escape comparison with the earlier film. Regardless of the liberties taken, there was an integrity and character-complexity to the 2005 release that's missing from this glossier biopic. Writer-director Douglas McGrath's boldest stroke is to impose a more overtly gay interpretation on a central relationship in which the attraction was generally supposed to be unspoken. Whether or not audiences buy into that, "Infamous" doesn't measure up to its predecessor and seems unlikely to echo the attention it received.
The key point of both "Capote" and "Infamous" is that while the seminal true-crime tome "In Cold Blood" made Truman Capote --giving him a level of fame and success far beyond that of his previous books or his social standing among the Gotham glitterati -- it also broke him. It's a central failing of McGrath's film that this bitter irony is stated but unfelt. In fact, pic delivers greater poignancy in author Harper Lee's acknowledgement of her failure to follow the success of "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Sandra Bullock's understated performance as Capote's friend Lee is a high point here -- wrapped in a cardigan and puffing on cigarettes, she creates a bracingly sturdy character of this plain-speaking, unfussy woman amid a cardboard gallery of flashy sophisticates.
In addition to its lighter tone, McGrath's attention to Capote's New York social circle is the chief difference between his film and director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman's more intimate portraiture. "Capote" focused more tightly on the writer's time in Kansas researching the killings of the Clutter family, and then on the protracted birth of his book, its development impacted by Capote's complex relationship with one of the murderers, Perry Smith.
To readers of the Capote biogs by George Plimpton and Gerald Clarke (respectively the basis for McGrath's and Miller's films) many of the anecdotes about the subject's insatiable taste for gossip and his fork-tongued wit will be familiar. The problem, however, is that McGrath has made an inherently artificial world even more artificial so his attempt to contextualize the Truman-Perry relationship feels empty. His reliance on the overused and intrusive docu-drama device of talking-head inserts (against a stylized Manhattan skyline) only amplifies this.
It's entertaining to watch Juliet Stevenson camping it up with her impersonation of Diana Vreeland (in production designer Judy Becker's meticulous recreation of the fashion maven's ornate apartment). But impersonation is exactly what it is. The parade of famous names playing famous names -- Sigourney Weaver as Babe Paley, Isabella Rossellini as Marella Agnelli, Peter Bogdanovich as Bennett Cerf, Hope Davis as Slim Keith -- is diverting but they're like glamorous wallpaper in a slick package. (The rich colors and sumptuous look of Bruno Delbonnel's lensing favor the city milieu over the Kansas plains.)
Only Gwyneth Paltrow is memorable in an arresting opening scene at El Morocco as a singer named Kitty Dean (clearly modeled on Peggy Lee). McGrath uses her fragility and Capote's rapt response to establish that sadness often lurks beneath the spotlight.
In the central role, British thesp Toby Jones is a good physical match for Capote, getting his flamboyant mannerisms and creepy, nasal voice down. But unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning turn, there's no texture, no under-the-skin sense of the conflict between Capote's ambition for his book and his compassion for, and attraction to, Perry.
McGrath leans hard for comedy in the fish-out-of-water scenario, with Capote flouncing into town like nothing Kansas had ever seen before (locals initially keep calling him "lady") yet refusing to modify his behavior. Some scenes, like his Christmas visit to the home of detective Alvin Dewey (Jeff Daniels in one of the script's more solidly drawn roles), play like a gay sitcom.
In a production that assembles its star roster regardless of the actors' appropriateness for their roles (Weaver is especially awkward), it seems apt that Capote wins over the locals with celebrity name-dropping. But as the tone grows darker, the drama's balance is thrown off.
Miscasting of the drifters responsible for the murders doesn't help. His sinewy physique and craggy good looks make Daniel Craig more of a natural for Dick Hickock than for Smith. The latter was documented as short and physically unprepossessing, shared traits that made Capote feel an instant affinity. With his delicate features, Lee Pace, who makes a sexy, surly Hickock, might have worked better. Vulnerability isn't Craig's strongest suit.
He's also stymied by ham-handed writing of the physical and emotional attraction between the two men. When Perry says things to Truman like "We really connected, didn't we?", the dialogue is out of character and context. Worse is a heavy-breathing prison-cell clinch in which Perry's anger with Truman turns from threatening to borderline sexual.
McGrath isn't clear on whether this is meant to have happened or to be a fabrication from the embellishment-prone writer and gossip. Either way, none of it rings true, making the subsequent execution scene -- which should be shattering -- and its emotional fallout for Capote play out at an unaffecting distance.

There is no way of sidestepping the issue, so why not jump right into it: Infamous , this year's retelling of how Truman Capote  wound up in Kansas writing his nonfiction novel In Cold Blood , never comes close to approaching the quiet, devastating brilliance of Capote , last year's retelling of how Truman Capote wound up in Kansas writing his nonfiction novel In Cold Blood . Which is not to say Infamous , written and directed by actor Doug McGrath , is a far inferior version of Capote , which was written by actor Dan Futterman ; it's just a lesser version, light in weight and absent the ache that permeated the movie for which Philip Seymour Hoffman  won an Academy Award . It can't withstand the comparisons. It's good, especially during its first half, just not good enough.
Had Infamous  been the first version of the story to hit theaters, one might have regarded it as a very minor triumphÂin no small part because of Toby Jones 's performance, which makes up in warmth what it lacks in weight. Jones, who is 39 but has always looked all of 19, seems somehow closer to the Capote who survives on old talk-show appearances and in biographiesÂthe gentle, elegant, protective, impish troublemaker, storyteller, and partygoer/thrower who only seemed larger than life.
Hoffman always looked too big to play CapoteÂmore like some swollen version of the writer, an interpretation cobbled together from overblown myth and half-based memory. Jones has the lightness of a sprite; you can believe this guy might have worn pink lingerie while entertaining law enforcement officers in his hotel room, as a Kansas Bureau of Investigation officer claims in George Plimpton 's 1997 oral history (which McGrath uses as his source). Hoffman would have looked like an elephant in a tutu.
For a good while, Infamous  is actually nothing like its predecessor; you won't recall Capote 's first half being in such high spirits and so willing to laugh at itself or its protagonist, who floats through McGrath's movie like a champagne bubble. The first half plays like a gossip column in which the boldface names have been brought to life by other boldface names, with Isabella Rossellini  as CondÃ© Nast  editor and photographer Marella Agnelli , Sigourney Weaver  as media-mogul missus Babe Paley , Juliet Stevenson  as Vogue  editor Diana Vreeland , and Hope Davis  as Slim Keith, a former Mrs. Howard Hughes  and one of Capote's myriad "swans" (as Plimpton called the women with whom Capote shared and spilled secrets). Sooner or later, McGrath puts all of them in front of the camera as talking heads decorating a talk-show set, with a twinkling Manhattan in the background; he's aping Plimpton here, who offered in lieu of narrative a collection of unverified and likely hyperbolized anecdotes.
Joining their ranks is Nelle Harper Lee , played by Sandra Bullock  with far more weariness than Catherine Keener  brought to Capote . She's allowed long monologues, to the point where the movie for a while becomes more about her own failure to follow To Kill a Mockingbird  than Capote's inability to write anything of any consequence after In Cold Blood . Would that Bullock, at last proving she's more estimable an actress than her choices would suggest, were allowed to devote an entire film to Lee's story. After all, we know Capote's by now.
To begin with, Infamous  is all fun and gamesÂespecially in the copious scenes in Kansas during which the natives of Holcomb refer to Truman as a "lady" and "ma'am," which alternately puzzles and tickles him. But the second half just follows in Capote 's footsteps, from the prison cell to the gallows to a career left in tatters. Sure, Infamous  dares to say that Capote probably fucked killer Perry Smith  (Daniel Craig  in jet-black hair and clunky American accent) while he was in prison, but the change in tone is so jarringÂfrom breezy sitcom to noir theatricsÂyou're less jolted by Smith and Capote's scenes together than you are by the solemnity that crashed down and sucked the life out of the movie. Turns out, there was only so much blood left in the rehashing of In Cold Blood . The sucker's a stiff now; time to move along.
