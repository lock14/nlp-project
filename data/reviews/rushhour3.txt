It says something that the most inspired comedic performance in Rush Hour 3
 comes from director-cum-fugitive Roman Polanski, whose turn as the head of the Parisian police arrives midway through the film: He and his flunkies torture returning intercontinental buddy cops Los Angeles Detective Carter (Tucker) and Hong Kong Inspector Lee (Chan), hanging them from the ceiling and bashing them about with phone books before going deep-down trauma hound on them with a latex-gloved index finger. It's either the most inspired Chinatown
 gag ever or a sure sign the diminutive Oscar winner has gone �round the bend. Either way, this third outing in the series (the last entry wobbled in six years ago) falls flat faster than most of Chan's goofy line readings � he's never quite mastered the idiomatic inflections of Yank slang, and as a result Chan's Inspector Lee always seems half a beat off his patter, making the whole film feel like a Hope and Crosby road movie lodged in first gear. The story, which reunites Lee and Carter as they head to Paris to uncover the would-be assassin behind the shooting of Lee's friend Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), is a sterling example of how not to make a crisp, surprising action film. It's The Bourne Ultimatum
's evil twin, relying, as it repeatedly does, on tired, cookie-cutter, clich� action set-pieces (Chan no longer seems to have the sinewy grace of his younger Police Story
-era self, nor is Tucker's pop-eyed, horn-dog cop schtick anywhere near as funny as he thinks it is) and a by-the-numbers script that feels as though it were concocted by writer Jeff Nathanson's son. Even Lalo Schifrin's pounding, percussion-heavy score seems retrofitted from some other, better movie. Ratner, a director not known for his subtlety, understands full well that audiences often enough expect more of the same when it comes to action-comedies of this stripe, but there's a fine line between the frenetic fun to be found in returning to a familiar roller-coaster ride and the dead-end slog of a dying franchise. If only someone had thought to replace the ever-more-annoying Tucker with the ever-more-elfin Polanski, Rush Hour 3
 might've mustered some severely warped brilliance. As it is, it just signals a series that's plainly out of gas.


Popular culture consumers are a generous and forgetful bunch. Something can disappear, then come back the same but different, and it'll seem like it never left. Certain entertainers, like Cher, have that kind of crowd-pleasing durability. So, too, does the "Rush Hour" franchise. These movies are the Cher of cartoonish action-comedies: hard to embarrass and probably not biodegradable.
"Rush Hour 3" puts Chris Tucker's Carter and Jackie Chan's Lee in another senseless plot -- Chinese triads, the streets and sewers of Paris, kick, bang, boom! When the ambassador who Lee has been protecting is shot at an international conference in Los Angeles, he and Carter go looking for the culprits and the mysterious gangland list behind it all. Unnaturally, this leads to a Parisian chanteuse named Genevieve who's played by Noémie Lenoir, the light-skinned European supermodel who suggests that Beyoncé is French for "great, big mannequin." (She's actually put to more ludicrous use, but you have to see it to believe it.)
Along the way, we get refried scenes. Look, it's Carter and Lee bickering on the plane and in the hotel, and look out, here comes a deadly dragon lady (Youki Kudoh) with a daggered Chinese fan. This is the same parade of cheery racism and blithe misogyny that we got six years ago with "Rush Hour 2." This new one has even been sprinkled with unashamed movie icons (Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski have small parts) and has made room for Yvan Attal to steal all his scenes playing a Parisian cab driver who falls in love with America.
This movie makes a fine replacement for the previous two installments. They've all been directed with lots of affection by the incurably average Brett Ratner, who sets his climactic fight atop the Eiffel Tower and demonstrates how the French flag can double as a parachute.
Of course, he also remembers that part of the appeal of these movies is the fantasy it promotes: We can all be jive, even Dana Ivey, who has an amusing cameo as a nun who translates a French-Asian baddie's racial slurs for Tucker and Chan. Being around Tucker makes you want to say obliviously ignorant stuff to everybody in a voice that squeals.
"Rush Hour 3" reminds us that Tucker is an utterly strange entertainment phenomenon: He exists only in the world of these movies. He's done virtually nothing else since the first one came out in 1998 (I guess it takes about six years to count $20 million, which was Tucker's salary for the previous installment), and you miss the instrument that is his voice. It's like the zither or the theremin -- you want to get close enough to hear how he makes that sound. For this sequel, Tucker gets to sing a lot more. He does Prince's "Do Me, Baby" and "The Star-Spangled Banner."
And his lasciviousness is taken up a notch, as though Tucker's only chance to approach women is when he's making these movies. "These girls are sushi-grade," he says about two ladies he's arresting. His Carter is a walking R. Kelly song -- he's not heterosexual or bisexual. He's just sexual. You get the sense that he'd hit on a park bench if it would say yes.
But Ratner, working with a script by Jeff Nathanson, is open-minded enough to admit what "Rush Hour 3" is: a love story between its two stars. When they fight and split up, Elton John fills the soundtrack, Lee sees African tribesmen on TV and wistfully orders fried chicken, while Carter, feeling the same, orders moo shu. For their reconciliation, they lovingly sing to each other "The Closer I Get to You" (with Genevieve, basically serving as an afterthought) on stage in front of hundreds of Parisians. This all feels borderline radical: a series of gags that seem sincere despite themselves.
Between this and "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry," it feels a lot like Hollywood is prepping us for some kind of seismic coming out. Who knows where Carter and Lee are dancing off to together at the end of this movie. But I'm ready to pronounce them Chris and Jackie.


         In terms of creative content, "Rush Hour 3" may be one of the most conservation-minded movies ever made. Hardly a joke, stunt, musical interlude or  special effect is deployed that doesn't seem to directly reference one or both of the earlier "Rush Hour" movies. Director Brett Ratner, screenwriter Jeff Nathanson and stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker appear to be trying to save the planet one gag at a time by recycling as much material as humanly possible.
 
 As the summer of threes comes to a merciful end, "RH3" (arguably the least anticipated of the season's litany of Part 3s) brings up the rear one week after the third "Bourne" movie opened and three months after "Spider-Man 3." The action buddy-comedy franchise feels worn out, and its insistence on relying on "greatest hits" doesn't help matters, but it still  probably possesses enough action set-pieces and mismatched partner humor to satisfy fans of the first two "Rush Hours."
 


         






   In the new movie, Tzi Ma's consul-general from 1998's "Rush Hour" has been promoted to ambassador and calls upon Chan's Inspector Lee to provide security while he delivers an important speech to the World Criminal Court in downtown Los Angeles. His plan to reveal a piece of secret information that could lead to the downfall of the Triads -- China's dangerous crime organizations -- is thwarted by an assassin's bullet, leading to a reunion of Inspector Lee and Tucker's hyper LAPD detective, James Carter.
 
 Chan and Tucker still project the same chemistry borne of complementary talents that helped establish the franchise in the first place, but the culture-clash conflict between them has given way to the complacency of an old married couple. It's a natural development for the characters, but it creates a dramatic void, leaving the moments between action and comedy feeling increasingly drawn out.
 
 The duo promise the ambassador's daughter (whom they saved as a child in the first movie and is now played as an adult by Zhang Jingchu) that they will protect her and capture the man who tried to kill her father. Also feeling threatened is the World Court's French head, Reynard (Max von Sydow), so everyone decamps for Paris, where the court's next meeting is scheduled.
 
 Enough exposition to sink a much sturdier vehicle is unveiled in order to link Lee to the movie's main villain, Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada), and set up a vertiginous finale at the Eiffel Tower. While Tucker does his usual verbal riffing, Chan relies more on being the straight man and less on the martial arts this time out.
 
 The fight scenes are all done with workmanlike precision but in some cases feel truncated. With the exception of an amusing "Who's on First?" bit at a Chinatown martial arts studio and some welcome relief provided by French actor Yvan Attal as an initially anti-American cabbie, there's precious little that is fresh or new about the movie. Considering the earlier movies grossed more than $360 million domestically, who's to blame the filmmakers for sticking with the formula?
 
 It's been pointed out that the outtakes that traditionally accompany the closing credits on Jackie Chan movies are sometimes more enjoyable than the movies themselves. If there's a "Rush Hour 4," somebody might want to consider swapping the time allotted to plot with the time devoted to the gag reel. A two-minute movie followed by 89 minutes of outtakes doesn't sound like such a bad deal.
 
 
 MPAA rating: PG-13 for sequences of action violence, sexual content. Run time: 1 hour, 31 minutes. In general release.   

Rush Hour 3  is the third installment of the action/comedy/ East-cliché-meets-West-cliché blockbuster franchise, but in a sense it could almost be the seventh or eighth. It's a jerry-built kick-ass insult machine assembled entirely out of secondhand parts. In the opening scene, Chris Tucker, dressed in a police uniform, stands in the middle of a Los Angeles intersection, twirling his limbs around like a windmill as he does a full, choreographed sing-along to Prince's ''Do Me, Baby,'' which is playing on his iPod  a performance that slightly interferes with his job, since he's directing traffic. It doesn't take long for Tucker to send two cars hurtling into each other (''I didn't think you'd go!'' he shouts, in his amped-up siren falsetto), but the gag, good as it is, would be funnier if a part of your brain weren't thinking back to the first time you ever saw this sort of routine: the introduction of Eddie Murphy in 48 HRS. , happily oblivious as he sang ''Roxanne'' along with his Walkman.
That Murphy reference is far from incidental. The eager yet lazy Rush Hour 3  often made me think of one of those mediocre Beverly Hills Cop  sequels; it's that derivative and slapdash. Like the previous two Rush Hour  films, it's a hybrid (black supercop crime comedy-meets-outlandish martial-arts action!), conceived to tap a demographic bonanza, in much the same way that the Run-DMC/Aerosmith ''Walk This Way'' launched a rap-rock musical form largely out of commercial opportunism. The movie got me to thinking: As the last chapter  or, perhaps, the final nail  in our glorious summer of threequels, is this picture the quintessential 2007 throwaway, or is it a vision of our cinematic future?
I remember when part 3 sequels were an automatic low-rent proposition. In the '80s, if you went to see something like Poltergeist III , you knew that you were getting the juice of an already-squeezed lemon  a concept stretched to the breaking point. Part 3 sequels had a faintly whorish aura; no one could kid themselves that the merchandise was fresh. Now, though, Hollywood has learned to build a better franchise, and to scale our collective expectations toward movies that are different yet the same. This summer, all of us saw high-powered threequels we dug or disliked. The best were the spangly and intricate Ocean's Thirteen  and the nervy and diabolical The Bourne Ultimatum ; the worst may have been Shrek the Third , in which the unjolly green ogre had (to me, at least) plainly run out of gas. And Spider-Man 3 ? At World's End ? They were just okay, but to a great many viewers they were good enough. Part 3 sequels have become like those stadium-size celebrity-chef Vegas restaurants: They offer the lights, the effects, the expensive dishes, the show , even if the guiding creative force hasn't been around the building for a while. One way or another, we've all learned to stop worrying and love the repetition, to crave the addiction to movies that feel, reassuringly, just like the movies that came out the summer before, and the summer before that. It's Copy Machine Culture.
Brett Ratner, who directed all three of the Rush Hour  films, is a product of that culture. He isn't a filmmaker, exactly. He's a shrewd, lively hustler who throws parties on screen, encouraging his stars to work up the sort of lo mein-versus-fried chicken racial effrontery that is now so corny it ends up just this side of offensive. In Rush Hour 3 , Chris Tucker once again leers and raps as Jackie Chan stutters and chops and body-slams. The two are such a well-oiled team that the movie scarcely has any pretense that they could really be at odds with each other. That's one reason it's less lively than Rush Hour 2 . The other is that Tucker has lost some of the skinny-bodied ferocious insanity  of his early years. He's still a quick-draw cutup, so dazed with self-concern that the world isn't quite real to him, but he's no longer acting from hunger.
Watching Rush Hour 3 , which is set, for some reason, in Paris, even though its barely functional plot is rooted in the Chinese underworld of the Triads, you react, mostly, to the tossed-off bits, which are like leftover morsels of buddy-comedy fast food. There's a Tucker-meets-the-Asian-Mob ''Who's on first'' routine (''Yu?'' ''That's Mee!''), which is moderately funny; Roman Polanski as a French cop who insists our heroes undergo a full cavity search (not at all funny); a French cabbie who longs to be an American hero (sort of funny); Tucker thinking Chan is having sex when he's only fighting (not so funny); Tucker and Chan disrupting a showgirl burlesque with a soft-pop duet (pretty damn funny); and a climax atop the Eiffel Tower (not funny at all, but pretty damn exciting). The end. Until next summer, that is, when we will see it, in one form or another, all over again.

 “Rush Hour 3,” the junky, clunky, grimly unfunny follow-up to the marginally better “Rush Hour 2” and the significantly finer “Rush Hour,” isn’t the worst movie of the summer. But it’s an enervating bummer nonetheless, largely because it shows so little respect for its two likable stars and its audience. Once again Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, playing seriously unlikely detectives, bumble and slog through muddled setups, graceless action, crude jokes and even cruder stereotypes, sacrificing themselves on the altar of the director Brett Ratner’s vulgar success.  The arc of Mr. Ratner’s career can be summed up entirely with numbers, namely the $247,538,093 that “Rush Hour” raked into theaters worldwide; the $328,883,178 that “Rush Hour 2” made across the globe; and the mind-boggling (especially if you saw the movie) $453,796,824 earned, again worldwide, by “X-Men: The Last Stand.” These figures, from Variety, don’t include DVD revenue, cable sales and the like, but you get the big tautological picture: Mr. Ratner has a gift for making products that companies can sell to the public, which is why he makes products. Even so, given the anonymity of these products, the possessory credit “A Brett Ratner Film” seems largely ceremonial, even nostalgic, not to mention hubristic.  There’s nothing new about any of this, yet it does bear repeating every so often, even in a movie review. Like a lot of big-ticket productions “Rush Hour 3” will flood into theaters this weekend (gobbling up more than 3,700 of the nation’s approximately 38,000 screens) and, because of its ubiquity and its brawny advertising muscle, will pull in a sizable chunk of change. Bad reviews won’t make a lick of difference to its box office, though franchise fatigue might. Mr. Chan’s and Mr. Tucker’s star power has waned in the six years since “Rush Hour 2” (their bodies have noticeably slowed), and that might hurt, as will “The Bourne Ultimatum,” which opened last weekend and delivers far more action bang along with real filmmaking.  Part of the reason I’ve strayed from discussing “Rush Hour 3” is that there’s not much to say about the actual movie. It’s a generically crummy action flick. It’s ugly. It’s noisy. It’s stupid. And unlike, say, “Transformers,” which sells militarism alongside children’s toys, it doesn’t raise hackles, much less blood pressure. Thus, as an object, “Rush Hour 3” offers precious little of interest, although it does take a special kind of talent to make Paris, where some of the story takes place, look this uninviting. There, rather depressingly, Roman Polanski shows up wearing a mustache and a smirk to harass Mr. Chan’s and Mr. Tucker’s characters, who are globetrotting after some villains. Max von Sydow also pops up for a few scenes, a reminder that Ingmar Bergman really is dead.  Mr. Chan and Mr. Tucker don’t get to wiggle off the hook entirely. But people have to make a living, even movie stars, and there are limited opportunities for an aging Hong Kong martial-arts giant and an eccentrically talented black comic actor. Given how much pleasure both have provided over the years, especially Mr. Chan, here’s hoping they were paid by the truckload. Mind you, it would be nice if they could find mainstream projects that didn’t insist that the only way an Asian man and an African-American man can hold the screen together is if they engage in mutual abasement and self-humiliation. It would be nicer still if Mr. Chan didn’t have to play the sexual neuter and Mr. Tucker stopped popping his eyeballs.  “Rush Hour 3” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has racist stereotypes, mild violence and partly naked women.

Watchers who warned that a six-year gap between installments would cost the �Rush Hour� franchise some energy �  especially from Jackie Chan, now in his early 50s �  aren�t entirely off the mark. But the latest picture to feature one of the movies� oddest crime-fighting tandems nevertheless stays true to the franchise formula of East-West fusion action, broad cultural comedy and international intrigue, this time largely in Paris. August rollout is like money in the bank for New Line, which will milk this likely final installment for maximum revenues down the ancillary stream.
Though late summer timing is just right for the franchise, "Rush Hour 3" opens just a week after "The Bourne Ultimatum," and while auds may take some relief in the bouncy comic rapport between Chan and Chris Tucker, they're bound to find the action mild if not downright tame by comparison. The action bar has been raised to exceptional heights -- higher than even the great Chan can leap across.
It may take younger viewers awhile to figure out the background plot in the new pic, since screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the superior "Rush Hour 2") revives characters from the first "Rush Hour": Chinese Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma) and his now-20-year-old daughter Soo Yung (now played by Zhang Jingchu, from "Peacock" and "Seven Swords"). Han is shot by an assassin in Los Angeles just as he's ready to blow the cover on a secret triad conspiracy before the World Criminal Court.
Carter (Tucker) has been demoted by the LAPD to mere traffic cop, a job he executeswith his usual soul-hipster musical-comedy flair. As bodyguard to Han, Lee chases the assassin across downtown Los Angeles freeway ramps and bridges (where Chan has a few minutes for impressive stunt work that doesn't involve hand-to-hand or foot-to-foot combat), only to discover the culprit is Kenji (the busy Hiroyuki Sanada), his long-lost companion and "brother" from their childhood orphanage. Emotionally unable to shoot Kenji, Lee lets him get away.
This sets up a potentially more interesting personal conflict for Lee than in "Rush Hour 2," in which his character had to confront his father's ex-partner and murderer. It's not to be, however: The Lee-Kenji battle never goes beyond the emotional level of a stare-off.
Carter and Lee hunt down an envelope with key info on the triad conspiracy. Until recently, the evidence had been under Soo Yung's care at her kung fu studio in Chinatown (where the guys have a hilarious run-in with a giant dude played wordlessly by Sun Ming Ming, who makes Yao Ming look like a runt). Triad henchmen now have the envelope, but with a little bit of (witty) torture, the duo determine the truth lies with Genevieve (the exotic Noemie Lenoir), the star attraction at an underground Paris nitery.
The old black-Asian cultural parries between Lee and Carter have been retired; now in Paris, it's Americans vs. the French --hence characters like stuck-up taxi driver George (Yves Attal), who's so Americanized he dons a Lakers cap and thinks he's an international spy. Shift is a bit of a stretch, but the Gallic friction is made more amusing by Roman Polanski (making a terrific uncredited cameo as Paris' sadistic police chief) and the wonderful Julie Depardieu as George's highly skeptical wife.
Also involved in all this is World Criminal Court topper Reynard (Max Von Sydow), who may or may not be the upholder of global justice his title suggests. By the time Kenji phones Lee for a final confab at the Eiffel Tower, two things will be obvious to attentive viewers: Pic is following the always-compact "Rush Hour" formula, down to wrapping things up in less than 90 minutes' playing time; and Chan has far fewer stunt set pieces here than in any previous film in which he's starred.
Jumps, thrusts and falls across and down the Eiffel are quite impressive, despite a few visible CGI effects, and the capper stunt involving a giant French flag is just goofy enough. Still, the pic ends rather flatly; the previous adrenaline rush just isn't there anymore.
As if to compensate for an understandable diminution of physical prowess and martial artistry, Chan moves more aggressively into purely comic territory, offering a preview of his second career as a comedy star. By contrast, Tucker's shtick is starting to feel long in the tooth, and the thesp feels increasingly like a second fiddle. Sanada, always a strong presence, has an underwritten role that cheats the pic of several juicy action and psychodrama possibilities. Lenoir and Attal uphold their Gallic pride, while Von Sydow plays the role Hollywood has regularly tagged to this supremely great actor: The Elegant European.
Helmer Ratner knows the "Rush Hour" routine by heart, and production values, even with several new contributors to the franchise (including solid lenser J. Michael Muro), maintain the franchise's sharp, shiny look.

In this third installment of the guilty-pleasure Rush Hour series,  squeaky-voiced LAPD  cop James Carter  (Chris Tucker ) once again teams up with Honk Kong's rather goofy Police Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan ). This time they're off to Paris, where they're given a decidedly unfriendly welcome by a French police inspector (Roman Polanski ) and later enlist the assistance of an America-hating cabbie (French filmmaker Yvan Attal ) in their search for the kidnapped daughter of the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. A Chinese triad wants to silence the ambassador, though I must admit that only a few hours after see- ing this movie, I couldn't quite recall why. Instead, my mind's eye called up a small moment from the movie's elegantly staged and superbly photographed Eiffel Tower  finale, when Lee, jumping for his life, scurries like a spider up a giant French flag, wrapping himself inside it as he goes. Chan is still the Gene Kelly  of martial arts.
