         Comparisons between the new New Zealand nerd opera "Eagle vs. Shark" and "Napoleon Dynamite" are probably inevitable, given both films' appreciation for social ineptitude at its most hopeless and intractable.
 
 A meet-awkward love story between geeky service-sector serfs with sad pasts, writer-director Taika Waititi's first feature was developed at the Sundance Director's and Screenwriter's Lab a year after "Napoleon Dynamite" premiered at the festival and shares many of its aesthetic and ethical concerns. Namely, "Eagle vs. Shark" wants to examine the deepest recesses of its characters' alienation and poke at its findings with a long stick and do so while luxuriating in the kind of nerd kitsch that Australian movies from "Strictly Ballroom" to "Muriel's Wedding" made mainstream long before Pedro ever ran for president.
 


         






   The film's title was inspired by the costumes worn to a party by Lily (Waititi's girlfriend, Loren Horsley, who created the character), a fast-food drone unanimously shunned by her fellow Meaty Love employees for being a loser, and Jarrod (Jemaine Clement), the passive-aggressive, baselessly arrogant electronics-store clerk she adores from afar. Jarrod hadn't intended to ask Lily to his "animal party" — the flier he handed her was intended for her more attractive, totally uninterested colleague.
 
 Lily shows up dressed as a shark and after graciously letting Jarrod, who is dressed as his favorite animal, an eagle, win a videogame tournament, cheerfully agrees to go to bed with him. A perfunctory come-on leads to even more perfunctory sex — the shark costume never even comes off — and soon Jarrod is asking her out, standing her up, and showing up at her house later, claiming a complicated emotional life.
 
 Horsley and Clement are completely convincing as the dorkiest people for miles — she talks as though she's trying to swallow her mouth and gazes at everyone with sideways puppy eyes, he's a consummate mouth-breather. But in the nerd-world ethos, wherever there is social awkwardness and terrible taste in clothes, family trauma and emotional repression lurk nearby. Lily accompanies Jarrod to his home town, where he plans to challenge the bully who tormented him in high school to a fight. Once there, he leaves her stranded with his oddball family.
 
 As with most movies of this genre — and I think it's safe to call it one now — "Eagle vs. Shark" fares better at the beginning, when such lunatic details as an inside-out Meaty Love burger (the bun's on the inside) and a candle in the shape of a pointing fist feel fresh, than at the end, when it's hard not to feel like one's emotional investment has surpassed anything the characters are capable of and has therefore not really paid off.
 
 The film's absurdist dialogue is consistently funny — "He's going to reap what he's sown," Jarrod says of his erstwhile tormentor, "and it's not corn — or wheat." But as it turns out, spending a couple of hours with emotionally arrested, socially moronic characters is not a whole lot more fun than spending a couple of hours with actual emotionally arrested, socially moronic people. In other words, shunning exists for a reason, and it's not like "Eagle vs. Shark" doesn't know it.
 
 There's an undercurrent of savagery to the love story of Lily and Jarrod. When Lily tries to nudge Jarrod's father into developing an interest in his son, she fills him in on his favorite animals. Of course, Lily is the type to have a favorite animal too. Lily is the type to have a conversation about her favorite animal.
 
 The rest of us can marvel at her sincerity and purity of heart, but after a while you start feeling like they deserve each other and you deserve better.

Or, Napoleon Not-So-Dynamite . Made in New Zealand, which ups the whimsical-yuk factor because of those funny accents, Eagle vs Shark  is the coy and coyer comedy of a cartoon-passive geek (Loren Horsley) who falls for a cartoon-angry dork with Mick Jagger's lips. He's played by Jemaine Clement (of HBO's Flight of the Conchords ), who has genuine presence but, in this film, only one note to play. Before Clement gives in to romance, he must take revenge on the bully who once beat him up. It's a tale that reduces angst, not to mention love, to a generational tic.

 “Eagle vs Shark,” the feature debut by the New Zealand director Taika Waititi,  is one of those movies  — “Napoleon Dynamite” is an obvious recent precursor  —  that invite you to laugh at its misfit characters and empathize with them at the same time.  Jarrod (Jemaine Clement) and Lily (Loren Horsley), the couple whose passive-aggressive, on-and-off romance anchors the film, are easy targets of mockery. At the fast-food restaurant where Lily works, her co-workers laugh behind her back and sneer in her face. Only the unconditional love of her equally eccentric brother (Joel Tobeck) saves her from a complete loss of dignity.  Jarrod, for his part, may be even easier to laugh at because, like Napoleon Dynamite, he is convinced, against all evidence, that he is a cool, complicated warrior-stud. Lily, infatuated with him from the start, is amenable to this view. And when, later on, she sees through his poses, her affection is only deepened.  But I’m ahead of the story, which is a small, intermittently charming, sometimes tiresome celebration of quirkiness, complete with cute animated sequences featuring apples and ants. Lily, noting that she and Jarrod have matching moles on their upper lips, catches his eye at a party where he is dressed as an eagle, she as a shark. She nearly beats him at a video game, he shows her his collection of homemade candles, and they go to bed.  So far, so endearingly quirky.  But the quirk stakes are raised considerably when Jarrod announces that he must go on a “mission” that takes him back to his hometown, a seaside enclave of oddness and frustration. His stated goal is to find the bully who tormented him as a schoolboy and deliver some payback.  Really, though, he must face down the memory of his super-achieving dead brother, Gordon (played in home video flashbacks by Mr. Waititi), and their father, whose favorite son was certainly not Jarrod.  This is some heavy emotional baggage for such a slight movie to manage, and “Eagle vs Shark” cannot quite escape the twin traps of forced whimsy and sticky sentimentality. That it comes close is the result of Mr. Waititi’s dry, efficient direction and the devotion of Mr. Clement and Ms. Horsley, who believe absolutely in the integrity of their characters long after everyone else, in the movie or watching it, has grown tired of them.  “Eagle vs Shark” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some swearing, a brief sex scene and glimpses of violent video-game action. 

"Eagle vs. Shark" is a deadpan romantic comedy about two geeky losers whose out-of-itness is clearly meant to be funnier than it is. Writer-director Taika Waititi's Oscar-nommed short, "Two Cars, One Night," world preemed at Sundance in 2004, the same year "Napoleon Dynamite" bowed there, and his first feature is aimed at the same audience, which might be expected to find the uncouthness of these vid-game whiz characters hilarious. Some light laughs ensue and loner protags possess an offbeat appeal, but the 30ish characters, Kiwi accents and profoundly twee nature place a large question mark over its commercial prospects with the "Napoleon" demo, at least for Miramax in North America.

Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley play lovers in 'Eagle vs. Shark.'
Title refers to the predator costumes worn by the two leads at an animal costume party thrown by hulking game store clerk Jarrod (Jemaine Clement) and crashed by gawky admirer Lily (Loren Horsley). Curtly dismissive when he's not being downright hostile, Jarrod is nevertheless impressed by Lily's video combat skills and puts the make on her with an abrupt, "Do you want to have sex?," to which the homely gal meekly relies, "Yup." Resulting physical encounter is equally speedy.
Despite subsequently being stood up by him, Lily still decides Jarrod is the guy for her; after all, they've got matching moles. But Jarrod backs off, announcing that he's in training to take ultimate revenge on the bully who tortured him in high school a decade back.
The pair shortly decamps to Jarrod's distant small hometown, where an ultimate dysfunctional family awaits. At its very best, the low-key, chuckle-inducing humor occasionally reminds of the regional Scottish flavor in the films of Bill Forsyth, but generally the proceedings feel closer to just tolerably amusing sketch comedy that's given no added distinction by the utterly plain visual presentation.
The intended martial arts showdown between Jarrod and his old tormentor is unexpectedly un-p.c. and startlingly funny for a moment, but final stretch bogs down in an unnecessarily prolonged misunderstanding between the gawky lovebirds.
Developed at the Sundance Lab, this was a project among old friends, as Horsley, credited with the story, and Waititi are a couple, and Clement and Waititi formerly paired as a comedy team called "Humourbeast." The mutual complicity in the collaboration is evident and Jarrod and Horsley, odd as they are as screen subjects, undeniably make an indelible impression, but result is still innocuously mild and inconsequential.
Production values are punched up by intermittent animated interludes of animal life and some distinctive tunes from the Wellington band the Phoenix Foundation.

Napoleon Dynamite  looks like Cary Grant  next to the hero of this Kiwi quirk-a-thon: a hulking, sullen creep named Jarrod (Jemaine Clement , co-star of HBO 's new Flight of the Conchords  ) whose goony sulking, petulant selfishness and dweeby videogame obsession somehow work like Spanish fly on mousy burger-flipper Lily (Loren Horsley ). If the intent were to have Lily's unconditional love redeem Jarrod, who plots half-assed revenge on the bully who thumped him a decade ago in high school, no such luckher regard for the insufferable prick comes off more as sodden masochism, or maybe brain damage. You can't see the forest for the twee in writer-director Taika Waititi 's thicket of cutesy conceits, from the stunted supporting characters to the precious animated interludes. But Jarrod's strident ugliness definitely serves as a critique of geek-chic narcissism. Maybe Judd Apatow 's comedies also flatter the maturity-impaired by making their 10th-grade hang-ups lovable, but Apatow doesn't leave you thinking less of the women who abide them.
