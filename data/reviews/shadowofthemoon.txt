         THEIR number is small and their status is elite: They are the only humans to have visited another world, to have actually walked on or been in close proximity to the moon. Their story, as captured in the riveting documentary "In the Shadow of the Moon," is an unexpected knockout.
 
 Unexpected because after years of NASA publicity bombardment, most people no doubt figure they know as much as they want to about America's string of Apollo missions to space. I know I did. But this fresh and compelling film, made with intelligence and emotion by British director David Sington, proved me wrong. Even if you care so little about the moon that you wouldn't mind if it's made of green cheese, the romance of this endeavor will capture you entirely.
 


         






   That's because "In the Shadow of the Moon" made the very shrewd decision to avoid narration and have the only voices come from archival footage and thoughtful and extensive interviews with 10 of the 15 surviving moon voyage astronauts.
 
 Now mostly in their 70s, vigorous enough to be commanding presences yet old enough to be candid, these men, alternately wry, acerbic, perceptive and funny, form as remarkable a group of individuals as anyone is likely to meet. There is a great spirit to them, and to have each of them talk to us as they'd talk to old friends is a rare opportunity.
 
 Also special is the space footage "Shadow of the Moon" has assembled, much of it never seen before and all of it remastered from original NASA footage. The almost abstract shots from robot cameras showing the crafts separating and docking in space are jaw-dropping. Images of the Earth,  rising up over the horizon and then floating in the sky "like a jewel hung in the blackness," as one astronaut puts it, are also stunning.
 
 The early astronauts, drafted into the space program in the 1960s when President Kennedy decided to race the Russians the 240,000 miles to the moon, were test pilots who thought sitting on top of an unreliable rocket was, in Jim Lovell's words, "a quick way to have a short career."
 
 The space program did have some shocking moments (including the abortive Apollo 13 flight celebrated by Ron Howard's film) which director Sington does not shy away from. Most poignant is Gene Cernan's recollection of Gus Grissom saying, just days before he died in a fire on the launching pad, that he was afraid to complain about the conditions that killed him and two other astronauts because "they'll fire me."
 
 Understandably, most of this film's attention is on the 1969 Apollo 11 flight which saw man's first steps on the moon. We meet the self-involved Buzz Aldrin, the superb raconteur Mike Collins, but not the increasingly reclusive Neil Armstrong, the man who took those initial steps.
 
 Though Armstrong chose not to talk on camera, he is very much a presence in the film, both through archival footage and the recollections of other astronauts, all of whom are still in awe of his coolness under stress. Alan Bean remembers Armstrong coming within a second and a half of dying in a training exercise, only acknowledging it when asked with "Yeah."
 
 Not only do the astronauts themselves display potent senses of humor, the film itself does as well. The Byrds' song "Mr. Spaceman" is on the soundtrack, and an amusing clip of Armstrong's parents on the game show "I've Got a Secret" gets a prominent place. Sington chooses to end things with the astronauts' deadpan responses to the conspiracy theory charges that the moon landings were all faked.
 
 What is perhaps most unexpected about "In The Shadow of the Moon" is that its depiction of both an America and Americans we can believe in lifts the spirits in a way that has not been felt in years. "We did something the whole world appreciated, participated in," Collins remembers. "Everyone felt, 'We, the human race, did it.' "
 
  It feels good to remember those days, even now. Especially now.

Watching In the Shadow of the Moon , a transporting documentary in which astronauts from all the Apollo missions recall what it was like to travel to the moon and back (the film features sublime, never-before-released footage of their doing so), I experienced a feeling that came as a shock: not just the usual admiration and ooh-and-ah wonder, but a bedrock nostalgia for an age when technology could seem innocent  when it was infused, on a mass scale, with mystical humanist longing. (Sorry if I don't get that same feeling from YouTube.) I experienced a similar sensation watching Deep Water , a spooky, moving doc that chronicles the first solo  attempt, also in the late 1960s, to circle the world by boat. It may have been technology that made these voyages possible, but it was something else  the ability to dream  that made them real.
It's funny to think how much the '60s, in hindsight, seem a relatively low-tech era: no cable, no Internet, no videogames, no iPod. The space program, more than anything, helped to lay the groundwork for the age we're now in, and In the Shadow of the Moon  doesn't hide the apocalyptic botched test launches or the tragedies (a trio of astronauts perishing in a capsule fire) that set the stage for the lunar-landing program. The vulnerability that the astronauts felt is there in the homespun eloquence of their recollections: the intensity with which their bodies vibrated during liftoff, in a way the simulator never came close to preparing them for; the scary moment, as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about to touch down on the moon, when their module's computer got overloaded; the way Earth looked from space (''The overriding sensation I got,'' says Mike Collins, his eyes glowing like Yoda's, ''was 'My God, that little thing is so fragile!'''). We've all seen images of the astronauts roaming the lunar surface like schoolboy explorers, but the spookiest thing here is when the moon just appears, in the capsule window, looming up like a gorgeous slate-gray cosmic graveyard. In the Shadow of the Moon  finds new resonance in the moment when America redefined progress  but also when it heeded the siren song of a world so desolate it reminded you what a paradise ours truly is.
Donald Crowhurst, the fascinating central figure of Deep Water , heard a siren song of his own. In 1968, he took part in the first race of yachtsmen to circumnavigate the globe  a contest inspired, in no small part, by the space program. A fusty British electronics-shop owner, Crowhurst had no business competing to be the Charles Lindbergh of the seas. When he set sail, he was wearing a sweater-vest and a tie, and he was soon bailing water by hand out of his rickety winged trimaran. He should have turned back, but he faced debts and disgrace, and so he did the opposite. He sailed on, vanishing into his mind to cling to the storybook journey he'd dreamed of. He left films, audiotapes, and a log, and Deep Water  turns these haunting records into the tale of two adventures: the one Crowhurst took, and the one he conjured so the whole world could join it.

Correction Appended When the Apollo 11 astronauts toured the world after  their July 1969 moon landing, recalls Mike Collins, the pilot of the mission’s command module,  he  heard the phrase “We did it” everywhere they went. The “we,” he remembers in David Sington’s documentary “In the Shadow of the Moon,” didn’t refer to Americans, or to any nationality, but to the human race. Millions around the world who had watched on television as men walked on the moon for the first time felt that  they had participated in a great adventure that ennobled the species. If Mr. Collins’s recollections make you swell with vicarious pride, they may also make you shudder. When was the last time the wonders of technology received such wholehearted endorsement? If today’s world is even more strife-torn than the world of 1969, when the Vietnam War was raging, one reason may be that the same technology that produced Apollo 11 has since come under a cloud. The good vibes are gone. The tone of international political discourse has toughened, and the United States is increasingly viewed as an arrogant, dangerous superpower. The concept of a cooperative multinational “we,” working together for world peace,  with America leading the way, is almost as quaint as the cozy concept of “the global village.” The planet that looked so pretty to Mr. Collins from 240,000 miles away is more fragile than we realized. That’s why “In the Shadow of the Moon” is  such a morale booster. The power of its archival images hasn’t diminished with familiarity. There is Earth, spinning in space, a blue and green paradise ringed with clouds. And there is the moon’s surface, up close and forbidding, with shadowy craters like pockmarks: a place of absolute desolation. Yes, we did it. Mr. Collins, who    offers his memories in a tone devoid of grandiosity,  is the most articulate of the 10 astronauts from various Apollo missions interviewed in the film. While Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11’s lunar module  pilot, and Neil Armstrong, its overall commander, walked on the moon, Mr. Collins never set foot on it. His regrets seem minimal. In down-to-earth language he describes the same feelings of awe and humility that millions back on Earth experienced when looking at the pictures relayed from afar. Putting his thumb in front of his face, he marvels, he could make the Earth disappear. Mr. Aldrin’s observations aren’t as indelible, while those of the notoriously private Mr. Armstrong, who refused to participate in the film, are secondhand. Mr. Collins and Mr. Aldrin both express awe at Mr. Armstrong’s coolness under pressure and his ability to come up with the perfect phrase — “that’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind”  —  when the occasion demanded. But Mr. Armstrong’s absence  leaves the movie with a hole. A grainy vintage television excerpt of his parents on the game show “I’ve Got a Secret” doesn’t begin to fill the gap. Around the story of Apollo 11  the documentary spins a sketchy history of the NASA space program, beginning with its cold war origins. It includes President John F. Kennedy’s famous 1961 speech to Congress declaring his goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade and bringing him safely back to earth. It recalls how the Apollo program nearly ended in January 1967 when a flash fire erupted on Apollo 1 while it was on the launch pad during a simulated countdown,  killing three astronauts. When a manned mission finally left Earth’s orbit in December 1968 and circled the moon, President Kennedy’s goal suddenly seemed attainable. Apollo 8 and 10 took men close to   the moon’s surface, and on July 20, 1969,  the dream was finally realized. A creepy footnote is an excerpt from a sad television speech prepared for  President  Nixon to deliver should the Apollo 11 mission fail. Threaded through the film are fragments of taped interviews with eight other Apollo astronauts:   Alan Bean, Gene Cernan, Charlie Duke, Jim Lovell, Edgar Mitchell, Harrison Schmitt, Dave Scott and John Young. These snippets appear almost randomly, in no particular order, and it is impossible to keep track of who’s who.  Cumulatively, however, they create a group portrait of explorers with “the right stuff”: men with a much higher resistance to fear than average. Mr. Collins remembers the intense physical sensations that he experienced during the Apollo 11 mission but that he never associated with panic. What could have been more terrifying than the moment when the module’s computer was found to be overloaded, just as Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin were about to touch down?  But Mr. Armstrong calmly went about improvising a solution. If there was a lack of fear, there were a thousand little worries. Through every phase Mr. Collins fretted about the details that had to mesh for the mission to be successful. But he never feared for his life. That, in a nutshell, is the right stuff. “In the Shadow of the Moon” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild language, brief violent images and incidental smoking.

The excitement, majesty and extraordinary human accomplishment of the American lunar program of the '60s and early '70s is rousingly captured in "In the Shadow of the Moon." Deftly mixing a treasure trove of archival footage with engaging commentaries of surviving astronauts from all nine Apollo moonshots, this British production will bring it all back for those with first-hand memories of the time, while providing a stimulating primer for younger generations. Astute handling could generate a nice theatrical run for this Sundance audience award-winner in the current docu-friendly market, while the sky's the limit in television, educational and DVD incarnations.
First remarkable aspect of David Sington's film is that it's never been done before. The U.S. space program and other aspects of the topic have been dealt with in numerous ways, including dramatically ("The Right Stuff," "Apollo 13," HBO miniseries "From the Earth to the Moon"). But while it naturally sketches in the Cold War origins of the race to the moon and uses as a springboard JFK's inspiring 1961 speech dedicating the country to reaching the moon before the '60s were out, the pic achieves its focus by concentrating specifically on the Apollo program itself.
Another important point is that, technically, the pic possesses a visual and audio vibrancy that allows it to play well today. Producers went back to the original NASA film cans, found some material never used before and remastered everything, meaning that the mostly color footage looks as good as new. HD-shot interviews with the now-aging but often articulate space travelers also looks sharp.
Sington skips over technological aspects confronting scientists working on a ferociously competitive deadline, just as he ignores budgetary issues, choosing instead to exclusively spotlight the men who actually traveled the 240,000 miles each way in the cramped three-man Apollo capsules.
They are a lively, thoughtful, impressive bunch, by and large; Some are more macho, others humorous or self-deprecating. But to a man, they possess something in common that sets them apart -- a humbled, philosophical side that, whether they state it or not, came from journeying to another world and seeing our own from afar. One can sense that they are changed men for having done what they did -- 24 men have traveled to the moon, and only 12 have ever walked on the surface -- and this sense of a special perspective comes through clearly if uninsistently.
Backed by endlessly wonderful archival footage, the fliers themselves recount their selection process, their training and the setbacks, most notably the tragic 1967 fire during a simulated countdown that killed three astronauts; it's a wonder the program continued apace in its wake.
Informed by the CIA that the Russians were getting close to putting a spacecraft into lunar orbit, the U.S. moved quickly to send Apollo 8 around the moon at Christmas, 1968. After two more test flights, it was time for the real thing, and NASA gave itself a window for three attempts at a moon landing in the second half of 1969. Fortunately, the first one worked, and Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon on July 21.
(The reclusive Armstrong is not among those interviewed, although others salute him for being the coolest of them all under pressure, and the pic includes a very amusing pre-moonshot excerpt from the TV gameshow "I've Got A Secret" featuring the space pioneer's parents.)
Aside from the great footage of the flights and moonwalks themselves, the pic makes a point of showing the elated international reactions to this "one giant step for mankind." Docu material from all around the non-communist world shows people thrilled about the accomplishment, and the film's implicit comment is that, despite concurrent events in Vietnam, this was when global regard for the United States was at its highest level. Looking at it another way, one of the astronauts states that, when he and his colleagues say "we" went to the moon, they don't mean just them personally or the U.S. as a nation, but all of humanity.
The near-tragedy of Apollo 13 the following year is given a once-over, and there were four more visits after that before man departed the moon for the last time in December 1972, not having yet returned.
The overwhelming perspective of the moon voyagers is that, from above, Earth looks like a serene but fragile bastion of life hanging in space, a unique oasis in what otherwise appears to be a void. Any film that can remind viewers of this unique viewpoint, witnessed firsthand by so few, would always seem welcome.

Four decades ago, the American space program was synonymous with the pinnacle of human achievement. Thirty-eight years later, the program that punched a hole in the heavens barely dents the public consciousness. It took a vengeful astronaut in diapers to put NASA  back on the nation's front pages this yearonly to be eclipsed within weeks by another dizzy star falling from the Texas sky, Anna Nicole Smith .
"NASA is, at bottom, a myth-spinning public relations machine, a giant image factory whose principal goal is to hype metaphors of human frontiersboth physical and intellectualin exchange for enormous sums of taxpayer money." So wrote Texas Monthly  earlier this year, in a piece that lambasted the waste and needless risk of NASA in general and the deathtrap space shuttle in particular. Our been-there-done-that attitude toward space travel had ended the agency's main purpose: serving as a weapon of mass distraction.
As a well-timed corrective, now comes a British documentary, In the Shadow of the Moon , to restore the space program's luster. A stirring account of the Apollo program's mission to the moon, as remembered by some of the few men ever to view the Earth from the other end of a telescope, David Sington 's doc recaptures the thrill, the terror, and the heroism of man hurling himself into the void.
The wide-eyed, square-jawed kid brother of the Manhattan Project 's atom-age skullduggery, the U.S. space program was the smiling face of technocratic Cold War rivalry: tug-of-war as opposed to the nuclear Stratego  being played off the Florida coast. In the Shadow of the Moon  swiftly sketches the speed-up of the space race: Yuri Gagarin 's pre-emptive flight in 1961, followed by Alan Shepard 's orbital journey a month later, and JFK's challenge to seize the lead.
Soon the president is fallen, and the mission takes on new urgency, even if to Apollo 8 and 13 vet Jim Lovell , one of the film's many sage talking headsthe many misfires and kablooey launches signaled "a quick way to a short career." But the test pilots of Apollo, one cool crop of cukes, had dreamed of pushing the envelope from childhood on. "It was a time when we made bold moves," one astronaut shrugs.
It was also a time when a diversion couldn't have come in handier. A chopper and a corny music cue usher in glimpses of student protests and hell-yeah clips of Operation Rolling Thunder cratering the Vietnamese countryside. The stock images of blooming fireballs queasily echo the blastoff shots, mirrored demonstrations of shock and awe through Yankee firepower. Meanwhile, the astronauts say, they were oblivious to the upheaval sweeping the country in the late 1960sand as long as they were airborne, so too was everyone else.
And yet the movie's appeal and NASA'slies in the ennobling accomplishment of that one giant leap for mankind, a triumph that lifted the species with a single footprint in the lunar dust. The astronauts' laconic machismo in the face of this death-defying mission recalls The Right Stuff , without Tom Wolfe 's mock-heroic only-angels-have-wings jive. But Sington's tone is elegiac and deferential. The movie contrasts the paradoxically down-to-earth reminiscences of Apollo vets Mike Collins , Gene Cernan, Buzz Aldrin , and the merry Alan Bean  with footage of their youthful rocket-jockey selves, sometimes in the same frame. The extra beats that linger over their creased faces as they remember the world beyond are faintly mystical inner glimpses of men who have seen the inexpressible. Each appears humbled (or, like Aldrin, haunted) by his privileged view of man's true scale in the cosmos.
The stark HD interviews set off the movie's treasure trove of NASA archival footage, much of it unseen and/or synched up with sound for the first time. Apollo 11's moon landing represented the summit of scientific progress, but it also triggered a new post-Zapruder distrust in film as a recording medium: If Stanley Kubrick  could fake all this stuff, why couldn't Uncle Sam? The spruced-up shots of space travel here won't win over Capricorn One  adherents, but if these are special effects, they have a mundane serenity missing from subsequent decades of CGImodules that disappear lazily into darkness, a POV from a lunar rover that's exhilarating even at bumper-car speed. No less alien are the fragments of cultural ephemera surrounding the mission, from the low-tech TV coverage ("The epic journey of Apollo 11 . . . brought to you by Kellogg's !") to a sweetly awkward clip of Neil Armstrong 's mama on I've Got a Secret .
Behind In the Shadow of the Moon 's worshipful stance, a darker story peeks through, which only starts with future Apollo casualty Gus Grissom 's reluctance to complain lest he be canned. But as Sington chronicles rocketry's role in the salvingor salvagingof the American psyche, the romantic sweep of all this space-age chivalry is undeniable. Need a pick-me-up after the bitter foreign-policy failures reported in Charles Ferguson 's No End in Sight ? Here's every nation on eartheven the pouting Sovietsfixed on the comet of can-do U.S. optimism streaking into the stars. Even the French loved us then. In the Shadow of the Moon  recalls the wondrous moment when America had the entire world looking up, up, and not away.
