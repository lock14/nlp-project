         Like most homecomings (or at least most good ones), Pedro Almodóvar's "Volver" is warm, emotional and forever on the brink of tears — peppered with bouts of pique, old resentments that flare up and moments of intense and lyrical longing. But what matters most are the kisses — madcap machine-gun smacks that the characters plant on each others' cheeks as though underlining their affection in triplicate. The title means "coming back," and it marks a return, as the Spanish director has said, to the La Mancha of his youth, to his comedic roots, to the world of women, to mothers and to the actress Carmen Maura, one of the original "Chicas
 Almodóvar" with whom he had a painful falling out 16 years ago.
 
  "Volver" represents a radical shift from the dark catharsis of "Bad Education," a story of corrosive lust and cruelty. The new movie is reminiscent of his work from two decades ago, especially "What Have I Done to Deserve This?," in which Maura played a frustrated working-class housewife and part-time cleaning woman who eventually kills her husband with a leg of ham. (As in the episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" that inspired it, she later cooks the ham and offers it to the detectives.) That film was in many ways a precursor to "Volver," though the new film, saturated with color and melancholy, is drained of the acid satire and gallows humor that flowed through the first, more melodrama than punch in the gut.
 


         






    "Volver" is just as funny as "What Have I Done," but it's also more sanguine and complex. Its humor is brighter and loopier, more a function of the characters' indomitable spirit than of their terminal despair. The characters' lives are similar — small-town women living in the depressing low-rent hives on the edges of Madrid, where housewives befriend prostitutes and husbands are good for very little. No glum victims, the women of "Volver" are survivors in the mold of characters once played by Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren (whom Penélope Cruz is styled to resemble more than a little).
 
  Also very present is the spirit of Joan Crawford in "Mildred Pierce," which lends the story its central predicament. Maura plays Irene, who was killed along with her husband in a fire, and returns as a ghost to rectify some things she was unable to take care of in life. Specifically, she's come back for her daughters, the fierce, headstrong Raimunda (Cruz) and her sister, melancholy Sole (Lola Dueñas). The sisters now live and work in Madrid — Raimunda as an airport cleaner, Sole as a hairdresser who runs an "illegal" salon from her apartment — but when we first see Raimunda and Sole, accompanied by Raimunda's daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo), they are tending to their parents' graves in their hometown. The cemetery is a hive of activity, as the town's widows busily polish headstones and change flowers. One neighbor, Agustina (Blanca Portillo), tends to her own grave, which, as Raimunda explains to Paula, is customary in the town.
 
  Agustina has been looking after her neighbor, Raimunda and Sole's aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave), who despite having lapsed into the late stages of dementia seems to be looking after herself suspiciously well. Her house is tended to and well-stocked, and she sends the sisters off with containers of homemade food. Agustina's explanation: The ghost of Irene has returned to care for the elderly Paula — she knows this to be true because several villagers have spotted her. Raimunda, whose difficult life and marriage to the perennially drunk and unemployed Paco (Antonio de la Torre) leave her little time for whimsy, finds the idea as ludicrous as the lonely Sole finds it terrifying. When Irene smuggles herself back to Madrid in the trunk of Sole's car, she finds she has to insinuate herself carefully into her daughters' lives.
 
  Irene's reappearance turns out to be well-timed, as Raimunda and her daughter Paula soon find themselves in a serious predicament. For the director, the incident presents less of an opportunity for tension and suspense than for a bittersweet expression of strength and solidarity. The spirit of La Mancha is present in more than the return of Irene — it's infused in the depressing big-city neighborhood that small-town laborers now share with undocumented foreign workers. Raimunda turns to her friend Regina (María Isabel Díaz), a Dominican prostitute, when she needs help — making sure to pay her hourly rate. In the absence of men — who, even when they appear, don't last long — the women form their own cooperative society. Despite their many "woman troubles" (a perfect joke Raimunda makes at a tense moment) — or possibly because of them — the women's cheerful solidarity is at once surprising and surprisingly natural.
 
  Almodóvar has cast himself as the chronicler of the Spanish soul, and in "Volver" he deftly weaves the old Spain with the new. The town, now a klatch of superstitious biddies, is in many ways itself a friendly ghost of the past. As arid and wind-swept as ever, the countryside of La Mancha is dotted with wind turbines instead of Quixotic windmills, though this obvious sign of modernity has done nothing to curb the high incidence of fires and madness in the region Cervantes made famous.
 
  The director has said that, for him, returning to La Mancha is like returning to the maternal bosom. And much is made of Raimunda's throughout the film. ("Between my mojitos
 and your cleavage," Regina tells Raimunda after they take over an absent neighbor's shuttered cafe and set up shop catering meals for a film crew.) But the smattering of desultory advances from a couple of would-be suitors seems to evaporate on contact with the force field that seems to surround Raimunda. Subtly padded and pushed-up, her eyes lined and ears hooped like Carmen, Raimunda is a striking symbol of the Spanish feminine. And Cruz, who has remarked that in Hollywood she's rarely allowed to be anything more than pretty, instills her with an awesome resoluteness and strength of character.
 
  It's no wonder, then, that the obstacles in her life — doozies all — seem to recede as she advances. There's a crime, but no investigation. Some romantic interest, but no follow-up. It's as if all that is sordid about the characters' lives pales in comparison to their love, devotion and care for one another. As a result, as its title implies, "Volver" feels less of a journey than a longed-for respite. Once there, you want to stay a little longer.
 

 
 'Volver'

 
 MPAA rating:
 R for some sexual content and language
 
  A Sony Pictures Classics release. Writer-director Pedro Almodóvar. Producer Esther Garcia. Director of photography José Luis Alcaine. Editor José Salcedo. Running time: 2 hours.   

Watching Volver , Pedro Almodóvar's latest poker-faced extravagance, you realize just how far his women have come from the days when they were living on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Take Raimunda (Penélope Cruz), who arrives at home one night to find her husband drunk, crashed out in front of a TV soccer game. A scene or two later, he's lying in the kitchen in a pool of blood, having been killed after trying to rape the couple's 14-year-old daughter (Yohana Cobo). An event like that one might have thrown an earlier Almodóvar heroine into a tizzy of neurotic soul-searching. But Raimunda, played by Cruz with sexy severity, is all business. She cleans up the mess with paper towels and a mop, dumps the corpse into a freezer in the diner next door (her neighbor, who runs the restaurant, had asked her to look after the place), and then, in case anyone doubts her resilience, she proceeds to open the diner herself, serving lunch each day to a 30-person film crew. (The daughter, meanwhile, reacts to all this trauma as if she'd just broken a fingernail.)
Then there's Sole (Lola Dueñas), Raimunda's sister, who's unsettled by some craziness of her own when she sees the ghost of their mother, who burned to death four years ago in a horrible accident. It's not a wispy, spooky, ethereal ghost either: Abuela Irene, played by the weary-faced yet winsome Almodóvar veteran Carmen Maura  (Women on the Verge... , Matador ), looks to be as flesh-and-blood as everyone else, and the director strikes such a diamond-hard, matter-of-fact tone of surreal credulity that we accept this phenomenon without blinking an eye. Sole, no dysfunctional slouch herself, wastes no time recruiting her spectral mom to assist in running an illegal living-room hair salon, passing her off as a Russian vagabond rescued from the streets.
Volver , a solemnly flipped-out soap opera of love, family, and the ties that blind, is Almodóvar working in a lighter shade of purple. The movie opens as borderline Hitchcock, echoing the tone of the filmmaker's bravura Bad Education  (2004), and then turns into a kind of overly conceptualized Tennessee Williams, as Raimunda, finally meeting up with her mother's ghost, confronts the deep, lost, messy truth of her past. At one point, Almodóvar rips the rug out from under the audience in a most delightful way. Yet as artfully clever as Volver  can be, will I be alone in feeling that the movie is more talky than transcendent? Almodóvar has made a comedy of feminine strife in which the women we see are ''healed'' from wounds we barely knew they had. Cruz, who looks stunning, summons so much more authority here than she does in her English-language films that you wish she'd also found more shadings, a palpable heartbreak beneath her goggle-eyed beauty. Volver  has oodles of ''empathy'' without being particularly moving. Then again, I've never responded with half the passion that others do to Almodóvar, who more than perhaps any other filmmaker gets celebrated simply for spinning his wheels.

 The action in “Volver” moves back and forth between a workaday neighborhood in Madrid and a windswept village in the Spanish countryside. Really, though, the movie takes place in a familiar, enchanted land — Almodóvaria, you might call it, or maybe Pedrostan— where every room and street corner is saturated with bright color and vivid feeling and where discordant notes of violence, jealousy and fear ultimately resolve in the deeper harmonies of art.  Pedro Almodóvar, the benevolent deity of this world, has revealed it — or, rather, created it — piece by piece from one film to the next. His two previous movies, “Talk to Her” (2002) and “Bad Education” (2004), explored previously uncharted regions of masculine melodrama, while “Volver,” whose title can be translated as “to return,” revisits the woman-centered territory of “All About My Mother” (1999) and “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” (1988). Drawing on influences ranging from Latin American telenovelas to classic Hollywood weepies and on an iconography of female endurance that includes Anna Magnani and Joan Crawford, Mr. Almodóvar has made yet another picture that moves beyond camp into a realm of wise, luxuriant humanism.  “Volver,” full of surprises and reversals, unfolds with breathtaking ease and self-confidence. It is in some ways a smaller, simpler film than either “Talk to Her” or “Bad Education,” choosing to tell its story without flashbacks or intricate parallel plots, but it is no less the work of a master. And it’s a testament to the filmmaker’s generosity of spirit that he effectively hands the movie over to its ensemble of lively and resourceful actresses, and in particular to its star, Penélope Cruz.    Ms. Cruz plays Raimunda, a hard-working woman pulled in every direction by terrible events and by the needs of the women around her. At one point in the film she answers a knock on the door from her neighbor, Emilio (Carlos Blanco), one of the tiny, mostly superfluous handful of men who appear on screen. Emilio, who clearly has a crush on Raimunda, notices a streak of blood on her neck and asks if she’s all right. “Women’s troubles,” she says with a quick smile, which is both a startlingly risqué joke and the literal truth.  Such troubles! The blood belongs to her husband, Paco (Antonio de la Torre), who has recently expired in a bright crimson pool on the kitchen floor after taking a carving knife to the belly. His killing is not exactly to be shrugged off — and he does eventually receive a proper burial of sorts — but he is not exactly mourned either. Men, for Raimunda and her circle, tend to be malevolent, irrelevant or simply absent: straying husbands, predators, dead bodies. They cause a fair amount of trouble, but the point of “Volver” is that it’s not about them.  It is about what American feminists of an earlier era called sisterhood, and also about the complicated bonds of kinship and friendship that Mr. Almodóvar observed as a child growing up among women in traditional, patriarchal, gender-separated (and fascist) Spain. Raimunda’s troubles may be extreme, but she bustles through them with passionate determination, making room for every emotion except self-pity. There are too many other people who need her sympathy, above all her teenage daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), who was subject to Paco’s lecherous, unwelcome attention. Raimunda must also tend to Sole (the wonderful Lola Dueñas), her sister, whose face registers loneliness and disappointment even as she tries to radiate busyness and good cheer; to their elderly Aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave); and to Agustina (Blanca Portillo), a neighbor whose sorrows could easily fill another movie. There is also a restaurant to run (it’s Emilio’s, but Raimunda takes over in his absence) and, on the other side of the screen, an audience to tease, charm, provoke and wrap around one of her long, expressive fingers.  With this role Ms. Cruz inscribes her name near the top of any credible list of present-day flesh-and-blood screen goddesses, in no small part because she manages to be earthy, unpretentious and a little vulgar without shedding an ounce of her natural glamour. What’s more, Mr. Almodóvar has had the sly inspiration to cast Carmen Maura, one of the stars of his early, madcap period, as Raimunda’s mother, who seems to have returned from the dead to add a touch of the gothic (and the surreal) to the proceedings. Ms. Maura’s warm good humor is a crucial element in the film’s emotional design. It is a chronicle, mostly, of tragedy and horror, rendered in bright, happy colors.  To relate the details of the narrative — death, cancer, betrayal, parental abandonment, more death — would create an impression of dreariness and woe. But nothing could be further from the spirit of “Volver,” which is buoyant without being flip, and consoling without ever becoming maudlin. Mr. Almodóvar acknowledges misfortune — and takes it seriously — from a perspective that is essentially comic. Very few filmmakers have managed to smile so convincingly in the face of misery and fatality: Jean Renoir and Billy Wilder come immediately to mind, and Mr. Almodóvar, if he is not yet their equal, surely belongs in their company. “Volver” is often dazzling in its artifice — José Luis Alcaine’s ripe cinematography, Alberto Iglesias’s suave, heart-tugging score — but it is never false. It draws you in, invites you to linger and makes you eager to return. It offers something better than realism. The real world, after all, is where we all have to live; for some of us, though, Mr. Almodóvar’s world is home.  “Volver” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, obscenity and sexual references.
Men are literally disposable in Pedro Almodóvar 's Volver. But the film, particularly for fans of the gynophilic, flamboyantly color-coordinating maker of loco melodramas, is essential. The title translates as Coming Back as in "back from the dead," referring to the matter-of-fact resurrection of Irene (Carmen Maura ), an old grandmother who refuses to let her own demise get in the way of unresolved family matters. Always an admirer of vintage Hollywood , the Spanish director has offhandedly referred to the new movie as being a throwback to Arsenic and Old Lace , itself a casual nod to the uncanny persistence of the past.
For Almodóvar, Volver  represents a return of other sorts as well: to his childhood home of La Mancha, to lighter material after his elaborately Hitchcockian Bad Education , and to All About My Mother 's Penélope Cruz , who, cast here as Irene's catering daughter Raimunda, delivers her most loose-limbed and endearing performance. In fact, the film's playful ode to female resilience owes enormously to the dynamic ensemble work of five gifted comediennes, all fully deserving of their special award at Cannes . Fair warning: If you're not terribly fond of women, you probably shouldn't see Volver , a movie wherein mere mortality doesn't stop mothers from loudly smooching their daughters' cheeks, a breezy comedy in which a seemingly typical male gets stabbed, stuffed into a fridge, and buried at swamp's edge. Not amused? Almodóvar and his fans would be reasonably delighted to go about their business without you.
Suitably for a film that celebrates the supernatural strength of women's work, Volver  opens on the image of ladies scrubbing headstones in a windswept cemeteryas if to suggest that their scrupulous care of the departed will bring material benefits in this life and maybe the next. Almodóvar gets a gentle kick out of mixing the extraordinary and the everyday, putting otherworldly elements in the most familiar of contexts: Maura's reincarnated Irene is a bemused granny with stringy hair and a slightly ratty turquoise shawl; her first appearance, startling but hardly flabbergasting her daughter Soledad  (Lola Dueñas ), is on a staircase in the middle of the afternoon. Later she shows up in the trunk of Sole's car.
Dueñas, as a Madrid  hairdresser with the straightest bangs on the block, adorably evokes the niña  next door, whereas Cruz, even in proletarian costume, playing protective mother to fragile teen Paula (Yohana Cobo ), inevitably signifies International Movie Star . Almodóvar tailors Volver  to Cruz's specifications, using her cleavage as the dominant element of countless shots and temporarily halting the narrative so that she can enjoy belting out a musical number that wouldn't look out of place in a Doris Day  vehicle. The reel flirts freely with the real: Almodóvar has also name-dropped the eternal Mildred Pierce, though the fate of Paula's lazy, lecherous stepfather, Paco (Antonio de la Torre ), more closely resembles that of Johnny Stompanato , legendarily carved up in 1958 by Lana Turner 's 14-year-old kid Cheryl.
Red, in every conceivable shade, is, not surprisingly, a key color in Volver , a movie about the towering virtues of high heels and the indomitable power of good old 35mm celluloid. (David Lynch  may have gone digital, but this director never will.) About a half-hour into the film, Almodóvar's effortlessly gorgeous shot of blood saturating two sheets of paper towelyou'd think you were watching time-lapse images of a rose in bloom momentarily suggests a tonal shift for the entire movie, white turning to a crimson so deep it's practically noir. Channeling Hitchcock even in this, the slightest work of his 16-film career, Almodóvar isn't what he used to be (who is?), but he's a master of the medium nevertheless, deploying color and light and shadow not merely to express emotions but to tap into ours, directing the blood flow of the audience as much as he directs the movie.
Volver could veer anywhere from that sopping towel, so complete is Almodóvar's control of the mood, but it's no disappointment that the movie remains in a relatively low-key register. With a corpse on ice and in need of burying, Cruz's caterer is suddenly, absurdly saddled with 30 extra mouths to feed and it's hardly a burden: In a single shot, Almodóvar follows Raimunda up the road as she meets one girlfriend and then another, easily enlisting them to supply pork and some sausages. The meatball in the fridge can be dealt with later.
