The early sign that a good time will be had at Danny Boyle's new space marvel, "Sunshine ," comes when we discover the name of the ship meant to launch a bomb at the sun. It's called the Icarus II , meaning Icarus I totally failed, and now, 50 years into the future, a new eight-person crew will attempt to succeed where its predecessor failed. It may cost everyone their lives, but the achievement will be historic: the rare sequel that trumps the original.

Boyle made "Sunshine" in collaboration with the novelist Alex Garland , who wrote the script (they also made the zombie allegory "28 Days Later "). If their movie doesn't float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition.

The movies as a medium began more or less with a trip to the moon. And now we have the crew of the Icarus II hurling itself at the sun -- for the future of mankind, sure, but for mankind's entertainment, too. One crew member, the shrink (Cliff Curtis ), likes to sit on the ship's deck and stare in awe at the sun at the risk of his complexion and his sight -- this solar movie, whose light the ship filters for him, is so brilliant it leaves him blinded, burned, and strung out. The darkness of space becomes the ultimate single-screen theater, and the idea of dying to save a planet is equal to the idea of dying to make art. But Boyle and Garland don't push that metaphorical parallel. The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own.

Ever since a portion of the sun went on the fritz, a solar winter has gripped the Earth . The Icarus II's mission is to jump-start the sun. The ship itself is like an enormous, ornate antenna situated behind a giant absorptive red disc that serves as the ultimate sun block. (It's simply the most beautiful Frisbee ever filmed.) Inside, the ship speaks in ominously soothing cadences, like the HAL 9000 from "2001: A Space Odyssey." Icarus II, though, has a woman's voice (Chipo Chung ). She takes commands, intones unwelcome alerts ("Fire in the oxygen garden "), and offers increasingly dire statistical probabilities to her international-looking crew, which includes the captain (Hiroyuki Sanada), the pilot (Rose Byrne), the engineer (Chris Evans), the communications expert (Troy Garity), the navigator (Benedict Wong), the botanist (Michelle Yeoh) running that doomed oxygen garden, and the physicist (Cillian Murphy).

It takes about 15 minutes to get over the fact that none of these people resemble the average-looking middle-aged white people you see on the typical US space expedition. They kind of look like they're on their way to Sonic Youth's solar-system show. But they're dedicated to their jobs: One crewman's dire miscalculations leave him suicidal with shame. The cast is similarly dedicated.

As the mission starts to go awry, the crew is forced to debate how to proceed in terse, well-written arguments. Soon, even those debates seem like a luxury in the face of lethal repair missions, a diminishing oxygen supply, and the unexpected if disorienting detour the movie makes into a sort of spiritual horror.

The tale of unlikely people (Evans, coming off a little Tom Cruisey, and Michelle Yeoh?) co-existing in the close quarters of a vast spacefaring vessel is a familiar one -- "Alien" being the most reputable example. But Boyle and Garland free their science fiction from impenetrable mumbo-jumbo and nebulous artiness. They're not going for the gargantuan cosmic profundities of Stanley Kubrick's "2001." (Talk about flying into the sun.) Whether you're taking "Sunshine" as action or metaphor, it has an unmitigated intensity.

But there are gorgeous physical touches, too. The golden space suits for the repair missions are very astro-disco: Elton John goes to Pluto. And the production design itself is astounding. Unlike the way that the effects and art direction suffocated everything in George Lucas's last three "Star Wars" movies, the sets and effects in Boyle's movie are breathtakingly persuasive. You're not watching a toy drift through space. You're watching the future -- even though the movie beats with an old hippie's heart.

"We are stardust," someone says climactically at one point. Here we are 50 years into the future, and people are still quoting lyrics from Joni Mitchell's "Woodstock." But, in a nice blockbustering twist, if we're going to get ourselves back to the garden, we'll first have to blow up the sun.

Because Boyle is a protean filmmaker who doesn't care to get traction in any particular film style or genre -- "Shallow Grave," "Trainspotting," "The Beach," "A Life Less Ordinary," "Millions," and "28 Days Later" are different cinematic planets -- each of his pictures has a jarring freshness. Boyle seems to disdain repetition, so his movies seem wonderfully egoless, which is not to say they lack wit, kick, or personality; he's actually the rare director who can make entertainments that run deep. Each movie sends him straight into the sun. But he returns anew, eager to fling himself out there again.



         Brightness has never seemed as menacing as it does in "Sunshine," the nail-bitingly tense science-fiction thriller that emphasizes both the fearsome power of our friend the sun and how bereft we earthlings would be without its warming rays.
 
 "Sunshine" is the latest film from British director Danny Boyle, whose eclectic résumé, including "Millions," "Trainspotting," and "28 Days Later," reveals a fierce disinclination to make the same film twice. Perhaps this philosophy allows Boyle to bring the energy and enthusiasm of newness to each genre he tries. For though it can't maintain its momentum all the way to the end, "Sunshine" until it stumbles is gratifyingly far from the usual space-opera stuff.
 


         






    As written by novelist and previous Boyle collaborator Alex Garland, "Sunshine" has a strong pulp concept at its core. The time is half a century in the future and the sun, billions of years ahead of schedule, is dying, presenting mankind with the unpleasant threat of extinction.
 
  Not a species to take this danger lightly, humanity unites to send up a nuclear device the size of Manhattan intended to jump-start the sun into renewed activity. The first spaceship sent on this journey has disappeared, and "Sunshine" joins successor Icarus II and its eight-member astronaut/scientist crew 16 months into its journey.
 
  Like those multiethnic platoons beloved of Hollywood World War II movies, Icarus' crew comes from all over. Capt. Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada) epitomizes the stoic samurai spirit, while pilot Cassie (Australia's Rose Byrne) is the most emotional. Trey (Benedict Wong) is the navigator, Harvey (Troy Garity) handles communications, biologist Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) takes care of the on-site garden, and medical officer Searle (New Zealand's Cliff Curtis) gets more fascinated by the sun than is good for him.
 
 Sixteen months in space  would make anyone edgy, but getting on one another's nerves the most are two strong-minded men. Capa (the excellent Irish actor Cillian Murphy) is a sensitive physicist, the man in charge of the care and feeding of that enormous bomb. And engineer Mace (Chris Evans, the "Fantastic Four's" Human Torch) is a macho individual with a can-do-or-else attitude.
 
 No sooner do we make everyone's acquaintance than a crisis arrives in the form of a signal from long-lost Icarus I. Should Icarus II deviate from its course to possibly save lives? Is the original Icarus' nuclear payload something the second ship could use? Whatever the crew decides, audiences can be sure that everything that can possibly go wrong will proceed to do so.
 
 Not reflected in a synopsis is the way screenwriter Garland has made "Sunshine" a thoughtful genre film, one with philosophical concerns about God, man and morality. It's not for nothing that Icarus' talking computer echoes Hal of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey."
 
 Garland and Boyle also have devoted time and effort to character psychology, to making the members of the Icarus' crew into recognizable people and not Hollywood stick figures. The director even had the cast members bunk together for two weeks in cramped London student housing to give them that lived-in mind-set. "Sunshine" may be genre, but it is good to see it being treated with respect.
 
 One draw of science fiction is always its look, and "Sunshine" certainly has a singular one. Thanks to cinematographer Alwin Kuchler, production designer Mark Tildesley and strong work in computerized imagery, both the interior of Icarus and the exterior of deep space have a strange, unnerving aura,  that helps keep things unsettled. An especially wonderful touch are gold lamé space suits (designed by Suttirat Anne Larlarb) that are the very thing Elvis would have worn if astronauting had ever come his way.
 
 All these good things enable us to buy into "Sunshine's" story for a considerable span, creating a palpable tension that underlines that no one should feel safe in the far reaches of space.
 
 Sadly, however, this film eventually floats free of the plausibility that has been its anchor and falls victim to hoary plot devices.  The conventional lies in wait to ambush even the most ambitious genre work, and though "Sunshine" is far too smartly done to be fatally wounded, it's hard not to wish it wasn't smarter still.
 
 
 "Sunshine." MPAA rating: R, for violent content and language. Running time: 1 hour, 48 minutes. In general release.   

Elements of the exciting space adventure Sunshine  have been repurposed from other sci-fi projects with a resourcefulness ecologists might applaud even if screenwriting students protest. There's the last-ditch attempt to jump-start Earth's dying sun in the year 2057 by nuking it, a Hail Mary maneuver straight out of Armageddon  or The Core . There are the mysteries of the doomed and vanished first crew, resonant of Solaris  (or, for those lower of brow, Event Horizon ), which now haunt the vulnerable second crew as they embark on their life-or-death assignment. There's even a computer (ominously named Icarus) with a speaking voice trained at the same diction academy as HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey , as well as a contemplation of infinite consciousness in an infinite universe that invites a humming of ''Also Sprach Zarathustra.''
But the pieces come together in this brooding odyssey with a bang. Sunshine  is another thinking-person's thriller from director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, also co-pilots on 28 Days Later . And if the movie's dramatic trajectory shortcircuits at the end, the experience is never less than a blast. While the unfathomable burning brightness of the sun bathes the whole picture in flashes of cinematic dazzle, Boyle and his team ground the story in details chosen for their sophisticated, underplayed authenticity.
An international space mission could  look like this, right down to the composition of the crew of eight dining together with chopsticks  logical utensils, since half are Asian, including the captain (The Last Samurai 's Hiroyuki Sanada) and the onboard botanist (Michelle Yeoh). The psychologist is from New Zealand (Whale Rider 's Cliff Curtis). One of the pilots is Australian (28 Weeks Later 's Rose Byrne). And the narrator (Cillian Murphy) is Irish via the Milky Way, at least judging from his extraordinary peepers. Even peering from a slit in a massive helmet, those blue orbs hold their own against anything the universe sends one lone space traveler's way.

 This is the end, Danny Boyle sings  in his spooky and spookily beautiful science-fiction thriller, “Sunshine.” Mr. Boyle, the sly-boots British director of movies as seemingly different as “Trainspotting” and “Millions,” has a knack for turning dire setups and very bad things into visually arresting, tingly experiences, whether his characters are doing one another in by hook or by crook or through some robust chomping, as in his exemplary zombie flick, “28 Days Later.” The end may be nigh in “Sunshine” — the Sun is dying, as is, alas, poor Earth  — but Mr. Boyle is having a grand old time.  Old is an operative word here. Like a lot of science fiction, “Sunshine” owes as much of a debt to the past as to the speculative future, including some of the usual suspects, notably Stanley Kubrick’s classic head-scratcher, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” with flashy bits and pieces borrowed from “Alien” and “Blade Runner,” Ridley Scott’s back-to-back masterworks. Like the globe-trotters in Olaf Stapledon’s 1930 science-fiction novel, “Last and First Men,” who jump planets to keep the race going, humankind in “Sunshine” has been forced to extremes to survive the Sun’s collapse. The latest extreme is a manned spaceship with a nuclear payload that, when dropped on the dying star, will trigger a big bang to thaw our global freezing.  That’s the bright idea, or at least the most vivid one, in “Sunshine,” which also flirts with questions about scientific progress, ethics and the limits of rationality. For the young, overly pretty crew of white and Asian astronauts, the mission initially entails watching monitors, twiddling dials and counting miles. There are hints of discord, as when a fight breaks out between two crewmen, the pacific Capa (Cillian Murphy) and the macho Mace  (Chris Evans), a tussle wearily described by one of the ship’s two women, Cassie (Rose Byrne), as “an excess of manliness.” More alarmingly, the resident shrink, Searle (Cliff Curtis), has developed a fondness for staring into the Sun, bathing in its increasingly dangerous light.  As the hubristically named ship, Icarus II, races toward its fiery destination, the crew picks up an eerie distress beacon beeping from someplace out in the great black beyond. In the face of this unsettling unknown, the captain, Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), keeps his cool, while the streamlined crew — including Michelle Yeoh as Corazon, Benedict Wong as Trey and Troy Garity as Harvey  — more or less keeps it together. But, like the Icarus of myth, these all-too-human voyagers who make like gods also risk punishment. Alarms sound, nerves shred, light flares, hope dims, and at one point and without much surprise, life ebbs, pooling picturesquely over the immaculate production design.  A first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer, Mr. Boyle always sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears. He’s wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in “Sunshine,” but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion. With the exception of “Millions,” about a motherless boy, Mr. Boyle’s movies are more likely to make you whimper than choke up or feel deeply. That’s to be expected because keeping the audience amused and distracted comes a little too easily to him. Like Steven Soderbergh, another cool, crafty dissembler, Mr. Boyle is awfully clever, which can be a great strength as well as a weakness.  In “Sunshine,” that cleverness is most evident in the fluid orchestration of the brisk editing, the prowling camerawork and unnerving sound design. As the ship moves closer to the Sun, and people and things begin to  fall apart, Mr. Doyle and his screenwriter, Alex Garland, goose their science fiction with action- and horror-genre beats, increasingly turning up the chills and thrills.  Less effectively, they also introduce a disappointing philosophical bogeyman. This creature enters late in the game with some blather that recalls, though with less poetry, some words of the replicant played by Rutger Hauer in “Blade Runner,” who offers the agonizing admission, “I’ve done questionable things.” (Kind of says it all, doesn’t it?) Mostly, though, the bogeyman just goes, “Boo!”  If “Sunshine” plays out more like a viscerally pleasurable diversion than an intellectually stimulating head trip, it’s largely because Mr. Boyle tends to lean on familiar genre stratagems and his estimable technique rather than risk anything by going too far out and freaky. Always an expressive colorist, he floods the screen with gold, splashes on the green and dots the image with jolting blue. He has enormous fun turning the lights up and down (your pupils will get a workout) and makes the most of the film’s major visual trope, a human eye. Again and again, he shows us human eyes blinking in close-up and the enormous round, golden shield that protects the ship from the Sun’s violence with its dead-eye gaze.  We look at all this looking, but what do we see? Beauty, for starters — the fast-approaching Sun looks like a hot, burbling and bloody stew — and death, of course. The crew members engage in a few deep-dish discussions, as in, Would you slit one man’s throat to save all of humanity? But this chatter is simply a way of moving the story forward and doesn’t open up larger questions of morality and scientific discovery, the domination of nature and the survival of the species. That may be because what’s most interesting about “Sunshine” isn’t whether the crew members survive but that they’re willing to blow themselves up for their beliefs.  “I think it will be beautiful,” says one, contemplating annihilation, which doesn’t make this the first movie about suicide bombers, only one of the more curious.  “Sunshine” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody violence, adult language and intimations of the apocalypse.

Like a collapsing star, "Sunshine" initially burns brightly but finally implodes into a dramatic black hole. Augmented by an ace digital soundtrack, the high-concept sci-fier, about scientists sent to reignite the dying sun, delivers some atmospheric drama that's gripping for two-thirds of the voyage. But like helmer Danny Boyle's other collaborations with writer Alex Garland ("The Beach," "28 Days Later"), it's finally an odyssey to no-ideas-ville that ends up relying on technical oomph. Sans marquee names, pic will depend on savvy marketing and positive reviews to click with a young demographic, with good rather than dazzling business likely.
Already screened at several German fantasy fests in mid- to late March, pic goes out rapidly across much of the globe starting April 5. In the U.S., Fox Searchlight is holding back release until Sept. 14.
Film surfs any number of space movies in which a journey becomes a metaphor for travel into the human subconscious. At the arty end of the spectrum, "Solaris" and "2001" are clear inspirations; more mainstream parallels include "Event Horizon," "Alien" and the much-fraught "Supernova."
But the closest parallel doesn't even appear on Boyle and Garland's published viewing list -- Peter Hyams' "2010," right down to its terrestrial coda. Substitute the sun for Jupiter and, in structure and theme, as well as on-board character drama, "Sunshine" is almost a remake.
Time is 2057, seven years after the spacecraft Icarus and its crew were lost on a previous mission to kickstart the fading sun. As pic opens, a replacement ship carrying a massive nuclear device is 16 months into its voyage and only 36 million miles from its target. Per the opening v.o. by mission physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy, "28 Days Later"), who clearly studied script pitching sessions, "Eight astronauts strapped to the back of a bomb, my bomb. Welcome to Icarus II."
In a nod to the probable reality of future power-sharing (as well as international box office), almost half the crew is of Asian descent, including Captain Kaneda (Japan's Hiroyuki Sanada, "The Twilight Samurai"), biologist Corazon (Malaysia's Michelle Yeoh) and navigator Trey (British-Chinese thesp Benedict Wong). As the story opens, Trey is cooking stir-fried noodles in the kitchen and everyone is eating with chopsticks.
On the occidental side, apart from Capa, there's pilot Cassie (Aussie actress Rose Byrne), med officer Searle (Kiwi Cliff Curtis) and two Yanks, communications officer Harvey (Troy Garity) and engineer Mace (Chris Evans).
As Icarus II enters the "dead zone," in which all communication with Earth will end, most of the initial character interplay is between the combustible Mace and maverick Capa, with a smidgen of sexual chemistry between the latter and Cassie. With scientific jargon centering on the sun's power, and some impressive visual effects for both the seething orb and a virtual-reality cure chamber, the script develops an atmosphere of possible realism, in a movie kind of way, avoiding the grunge beloved of '90s sci-fiers.
Plot picks up in the third reel as the crew detects a faint signal from the original Icarus and has to decide whether to check it out. It's the first of several decisions that are dealt with in a practical, scientific way; later ones, involving sacrifice for the greater good, come down to a sheer numbers game that generates its own drama when applied to human lives.
When Trey bungles the course adjustment, a series of events are set in motion that have escalating consequences. First big set piece, as Capa and Kaneda exit the ship to repair sun shields, is handled with a good balance between f/x and the human drama. Ditto the later boarding of the Icarus -- a dust-covered ghost ship that may hold a secret -- and the nail-biting transfer back to Icarus II.
It's during the final act that Garland's science-based approach starts to go haywire, as he struggles for a conclusion to his Big Idea and can only come up with a fuzzy religioso message (rather like "2010") capped by an increasingly visceral, killer-on-the-loose finale. Latter becomes progressively more ridiculous after the script's earlier, careful calibrations.
Still, for the first hour or so "Sunshine" is gripping enough with its solid performances, good-looking CGI, underlying tension and resonant, iron-hard digital soundtrack. Pic could have done more, however, to emphasize the claustrophobia of eight humans attached to a nuclear bomb that's (literally) the size of Manhattan.
Though it takes a while to sort out who's who among the Westerners, and only Yeoh gets much of a part among the Asians, Boyle generally directs fluidly, making the most of p.d. Mark Tildesley's sensible, not-too-futuristic sets, lensed with cool reserve by Alwin Kuchler. (Whole pic was shot in East London's 3 Mills Studios.)
Performances blend OK, with Murphy making a charismatic lead and Byrne making the most of a smaller role. John Murphy's techno-rock music refreshingly avoids the usual outer-space cliches.

In the observation room of the spacecraft Icarus II , passengers sit on a bench in front of a large, rectangular screen displaying a view of what lies ahead. They gaze at the spectacle as you might marvel at special effects on some ostentatious plasma monitor. A seething orb of gas and flame burns in the void. Icarus II  is en route to the sun.
It is the year 2057. Approximately five billion years ahead of schedule, the sun is beginning to die. In a desperate attempt to keep the lights on, global resources have been directed toward a solution, presumably with input from Al Gore  and the writers of Armageddon . A team of experts will deposit a bomb the size of Manhattan inside the fading light, thustheoreticallygiving birth to a vigorous new star. Given its ominous name (was Fat Chance already taken?), it comes as no surprise that the first Icarus  expedition failed and then vanished. Enter Icarus II , a fresh crew, and the convolutions of Sunshine , a heady science fiction written by Alex Garland  and directed by Danny Boyle .
We begin in the observation room as Searle (Cliff Curtis ), the medical officer, converses with the onboard AI in that deep, slumberous monotone common to ponderous outer space sagas. He requests to view the sun at maximum brilliance, is obliged, and staggers out in a state of quasi-religious rapture. Within the sequence, Boyle rhymes the bright circumference with Searle's dazzled corneas. This correspondence of shapes is sustained throughout the film as if in homage to the poet Ronald Johnson , who liked to imagine the eye as an organ evolved by the sun to contemplate itself.
Oh, yesthere will be poetry. As it rockets toward the fate of mankind, Sunshine  alerts all passengers that they have boarded a first-class head trip. Big Questions are posed. (What is man's role in the universe? What happens when you stare into the abyss? Is Chris Evans  hotter with long hair or short?) Ethical Quandaries are dramatized. (How do you reframe the basic tenets of civilization when faced with its imminent extinction?) There will be ghosts in the machine, signs and miracles, manifestations of the intergalactic sublime. And there will also be a rampage by what appears to be Freddy Krueger  in the throes of one seriously gnarly God complex.
Ideas scintillate over the surface of Sunshine without ever quite igniting, but at least the movie sparkles. What it doesn't do is cohere. Action flick, sci-fi thriller, metaphysical adventure, incoherent allegory, ethical hypothesis, and horror film all at once, this mad multitasker has the agenda of a dozen movies. Problem is, we know which ones.
Sunshine is a nearly perfect pastiche, every computer glitch, hazardous space walk, navigational gambit, and act of mad heroism traceable to the sci-fi canon. These genre tropes are slyly acknowledged when the crew locates, and boards, the mysteriously vacant Icarus . "Afraid we might get picked off by aliens one by one?" they tease each other, and us. That's good for a laugh, but how are we supposed to take things seriously when this is more or less exactly what happens later in the picture?
Funny thing is, Sunshine works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious. It crescendos with a legitimate sense of wonder (if not profundity) thanks in large part to the luminous and uncanny score by electro legends Underworld. Cillian Murphy  heads an ensemble graced with vivid physical presence (Hiroyuki Sanada , Michelle Yeoh ), an asset given the dialogue's tendency for sci-fi boilerplate. It is what it is as a movie of ideas, but makes an evocative contribution to the Malfunction Adventure drama.
Stupid things happen in Sunshine e.g., a finale plagued with redundancy and cheap thrillsyet the movie never feels stupid. Its achievement falls somewhere between a pair of underated oddballs maudits : Steven Soderbergh 's suavely introspective Solaris  remake and the earth-drilling disaster flick The Core , a movie rich in pulp abstraction. Boyle plays it safer than both. Neither philosopher nor hack, serious or ridiculous, he's an able craftsman with a canny sense of timing. Just as Trainspotting  spoke to '90s disaffection and 28 Days Later  to post-9/11 anxiety, Sunshine suits a climate where the possibility of ecological apocalypse 50 years hence is no longer the stuff of science fiction.
