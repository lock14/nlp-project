You can�t read one of Clooney�s endless People
 profiles without hearing the Cary Grant comparison, but here, he�s all Gable � same rakishness and stubble and tanned-leather basso profundo. Nearing 50, he�s still almost improbably puckish, but the picture � his third directorial effort � isn�t quite as fleet. Set in the 1920s, when the nation was still recovering from the Great War, Leatherheads
 charts, with what I presume is very little actual historical accuracy, the awkward birth of professional football. Clooney�s Dodge Connelly leads the rough-and-tumble Duluth Bulldogs, who break all the rules, but no bother � the limping-along pro league never had any rules to begin with. When the Bulldogs turn cash-poor and fan-deficient, Connelly cooks up a plan to save the team: enlist the services of war hero and Princeton star quarterback Carter �the Bullet� Rutherford (The Office
�s Krasinski). Connelly�ll have to get in line, though � Chicago Tribune
 reporter Lexie Littleton (Zellweger, in a regrettable weave) is in hot pursuit of the Bullet, too, on a tip that the boy wonder maybe fibbed some on his war record. And there you have the makings of a crackerjack love triangle, with each leg entirely game � and faithful, too, to the period charms of lipsticked cigarettes and speakeasy brawls. (Krasinski, especially, with his wide, eager face and sweet, dumb-lug grin, feels like the happy accident of some tear in the time-space continuum.) Leatherheads
 comes practically gift-wrapped in goodwill � it�s a celebration of an American pastime (if not the
 American pastime) and a loving nod to the screwballs of yore. The film is appropriately scored, well-acted, and possessing of a handful of truly transportive moments. It's awfully agreeable � so why doesn�t it entirely work? I think it�s a question of comic timing. This kind of backward-glancing, even ga-ga-ing, material begs for barmy, and barmy begs for no brakes, but Leatherheads
 takes a full half-hour of stops and starts to find its footing. Even then, it skips from fizzy water to flat tap from scene to scene. In spirit, it�s right-on � knowing but never ironic � but in execution, Leatherheads
 is less sure. And when you set a scene in the rattling cage of a train-car sleeper � a tip of the hat to Sturges, Wilder, and Big Al Hitchcock � you�re only setting yourself up for failure.


Clooney's 'Leatherheads' mostly just fumbles around
George Clooney wins frequent comparisons to Clark Gable and Cary Grant. But we don't have to go back that far: 2005's "Good Night, and Good Luck," with its obvious political leanings (to the left, to the left) proved that Clooney is more like Warren Beatty. (He acts, he directs, he deflects the praise he seeks. What a gentleman.) Now they've both made romantic comedies tinged with football. I'm partial to "Heaven Can Wait," Beatty's 1978 gauzy remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941), with Beatty as a dead quarterback's ghost. The joke premise turned into a sort of existential crisis. Clooney's movie, "Leatherheads," comes out today and turns the birth of professional football into a screwball farce.
For a few early scenes, that idea is reasonably entertaining. The film moves slowly and steadily, but it's never exactly dull, just mild. The year is 1925, and the college circuit is more popular than the lowly, stagnant pro leagues, where a good game is one that ends in fistfights and yelling. Clooney plays Dodge Connolly, the captain of the Duluth Bulldogs, a gang of anonymously rugged lugs. It wouldn't be surprising if at the end, we learned that the movie was actually about how professional wrestling was born. They smoke. They drink. They wear wool uniforms. And Dodge more or less writes the team's press.
To get more rumps in the seats, Dodge recruits Carter "The Bullet" Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the Bulldogs. A decorated war hero (the story goes he forced Germans into submission) and a Princeton football star, he appears to be the most popular man in America. The Bulldogs are a Mickey Mouse operation. But after Dodge promises the kid a lot of money, his manager (Jonathan Pryce) signs him up.
Pretty soon Renee Zellweger turns up as Clooney's verbal sparring partner. She's playing a hard-working big-city reporter named - alliteration alert - Lexie Littleton. Lexie gets a tip that Carter's war story is bogus and follows the kid around, trying to seduce the truth out him. Naturally, Dodge is smitten with her, too, and the film breaks out into screwball hives. Zellweger glides into the movie wearing a hat impaled by a feather. The boys in the newsroom cringe at it, but somewhere Rosalind Russell is tipping her cap. Russell might have something else to say about Zellweger's lack of vigor. She's not miscast so much as misdirected. As Dodge is arriving to introduce himself, Lexie is telling another suitor to take a hike.
"You're just substituting my bosom for your mother's."
"I didn't come here to be insulted."
"No, where do you go?"
The way Zellweger says this, it's unclear whether she's serious or not. The movie's obvious model for Lexie (and her hat) is Russell in Howard Hawks's "His Girl Friday." But where's the vinegar? The dialogue in Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly's script doesn't pop or zing out of the actors' mouths. And the pace keeps going slack. The final game, for instance, is a real mess. Are we supposed to care who wins?
The movie doesn't have even tone, either. Clooney ransacks other directors' styles or themes - Preston Sturges's cynicism, Frank Capra's earnestness, Ernst Lubitsch's sexual insinuations, Robert Altman's randomness, Steven Soderbergh's riveting glibness, the Coen brothers' mocking obsession with idiots and fat people. This is an unmade bed of a movie - and ambiguous to a fault. (Even the happy ending feels washed out. The movie wraps up with two characters driving off into the sunset - although I can't be sure what time of day it is, and the sky is overcast.)
"Heaven Can Wait" wasn't perfect. But it floated, where Clooney's movie doesn't. Beatty made "Heaven" with Buck Henry. Maybe "Leatherheads" needed a copilot to keep it steady. The movie is a cartoon comedy that keeps changing its mind about how silly it really wants to be. Eventually, the plot about Carter's tall tale overwhelms the movie, straining to draw hollow parallels to today's wars, journalism scandals, and pro-sports woes.
Clooney is pathologically moral. Even when masterminding heists, he's the good guy. In that sense, he might not be a bigger narcissist than Beatty (Clooney has not taken to lighting himself the Streisand way), just a better one: We don't notice it as much because Clooney's pretending to be one of us. But Clooney knows he's the star. He even installs himself in earlier eras where movie stars really counted for something. Clooney's heard that he's like Clark Gable and Cary Grant. In "Leatherheads," he can be Gable and Grant - until, of course, he decides he also wants to be a politician.
Beatty always seemed like he was running for president of Hollywood. Clooney's films leave you with the same feeling. But where a movie like "Reds" is sometimes rousing as Tinseltown art, Clooney's movies sacrifice everything to wag a finger. That can make for dispiriting moviegoing: You never feel like you're good enough for him.

Early in his stardom, George Clooney   figured out how to convey both a grateful amusement at his own good luck and good looks, and a serious awareness of the power he's got while the going is good. That's also how he became a walking American character ideal, with a responsible carbon footprint and a villa in Italy. Clooney appears to be a guy who knows how not to sweat the small stuff, while making his commitment to big stuff look really exciting: Michael Clayton, Syriana, Good Night, and Good Luck ; humanitarian activism in Darfur; nontraditional, energy-saving automobiles. But when he takes on comic, Rat Pack-y projects that overtly tweak his own marketable suaveness  O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Ocean's Eleven  through Thirteen   something vexing happens. That's when this coolest of cats looks like he's trying too hard.
Reproducing a period-piece screwball comedy for a modern audience turns out to be one playful, self-deprecating wink too many for the star, who also directed Leatherheads   with what may have been only vague awareness going in of just how difficult it is to control the speed and bounce of a successful screwball trajectory. In this slowest of ostensibly madcap romps, Clooney strains at the chin strap as Dodge Connolly, an athletic scrapper at play, on the field and off. Leatherheads  is set during the early days of pro football circa 1925, before big money and damn rules changed and, the movie argues, ruined the game. (The script is credited to former Sports Illustrated  writers Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly  pros at covering college football, but not so much at screenwriting. Since the first draft, dating back to the early 1990s, a lot of hands have touched the ball, among them Clooney's own.)
Dodge loves a playful brawl, a snoot full of drink, and a great dame. And the dame he's got his eye on is Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger  ), a snappy news hen from the His Girl Friday  school of gal reporters, with a nifty wardrobe in shades of red. Lexie, meanwhile, has her investigative eye on Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski), a straight-arrow college football hero with an impossibly noble WWI record, recently recruited by Dodge to boost spectator numbers for his struggling pro team, the Duluth Bulldogs. While she sniffs out inconsistencies in Carter's battlefield stories, this tough honey also finds herself attracted to the big fellow. Why not? It's Krasinski's irresistible Jim Halpert from The Office   , redux, with a bonus of athletic prowess.
And so Leatherheads  plays out in a sequence of romantic rivalries, on-field scuffles, backroom maneuvers (many of them involving Jonathan Pryce as Carter's slick sports agent), chastely sexy moments of flirtation, and wacky digressions meant to simulate the mechanics of the original '30s and '40s comedies by George Cukor, Lewis Milestone, and Howard Hawks to which Leatherheads  doffs its helmet. Reportedly, Clooney himself really pushed for more spring to the screwball quotient  the better, perhaps, to play off that bon-vivant, guy-among-guys, smoothie-among-women persona he has established so comfortably.
But he never gets that bounce. The dialogue drags no matter how fast Clooney and Zellweger rattle off their he-said-she-said lines in a studious imitation of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Zellweger is a physical match for the showier spitfire hats in which she's framed, but she's a personality mismatch for the role of a career-girl toughie who thrives on brainy banter with the boys. She seems stranded here, a bruisable actor who has wandered, as she sometimes does, into the wrong role and the wrong era for her idiosyncratic talents. (Lexie, in a railway sleeping car, where the two are unwitting bunkmates: ''So you want to play dirty?'' Dodge: ''Maybe later, I'm a little tired right now.'') Clooney, in contrast, just seems grimly determined  to pretend to be jazzed by Zellweger's tense interpretation of banter, to pretend to be having a grand time, to get through the movie.
Under the circumstances, the collegial bond between Clooney and Krasinski is a relief from so much strained jocularity. Both exceptionally likable personalities, both beholden to TV for their seasoning, the natural ease between the pair hints at what Leatherheads  could have been had Clooney the filmmaker not tried so hard to re-create a specialty genre rooted in so psychologically different an American time. And  had Clooney the star not tried so unnecessarily hard to convince his already convinced fans that his fame and fortune are just the luck of the game.

 In the good old days, around 1925, according to “Leatherheads,” professional football was a lot more fun, a rough, ragged enterprise, untrammeled by corporate influence and unconstrained by rules and regulations. And in the slightly more recent old days — the ’30s and ’40s, more or less — movies were also more fun. They had zip, pep, moxie, trains, hats and double-entendres.  “Leatherheads” makes the second case as strongly as it does the first, but mainly by showcasing its own dullness and timidity. The picture labors so strenuously to approximate some of the old screwball spirit that it winds up in traction. The actors, writers and directors who made those old studio whirligigs spin — Clark Gable and Carole Lombard; William Powell and Myrna Loy; Preston Sturges and Frank Capra and all the rest — made it look easy. By contrast “Leatherheads,” the third and by a wide margin the weakest movie directed by George Clooney, looks to have been nearly as hard to make as it is to watch.  Mr. Clooney, mugging and flexing his eyebrows and lingering needlessly in the frame when he should be taking care of business behind the camera, plays Dodge Connolly, aging star of a Duluth, Minn.,  football squad on the verge of bankruptcy. The professional game is a marginal, low-rent undertaking played in front of sparse crowds in cow fields. The glamour is all at the collegiate level, where lantern-jawed scholars in smart uniforms fill vast stadiums with ardent fans.  Dodge, a smooth-talking sharpie on and off the gridiron, persuades Princeton’s star player, Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski), to join the Duluth team. Carter and his oily manager, C. C. Frazier (Jonathan Pryce), agree. A while later Mr. Clooney and Mr. Krasinski punch each other in the face.  But in the meantime they and we make the acquaintance of Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), a fast-talking, ambitious lady reporter for The Chicago Tribune who admires the sound of her own voice and the sight of her own legs just in case no one else will. They all do, of course, because the script (by Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly) requires them to. It also stuffs Ms. Zellweger’s mouth with hard-boiled witticisms that have all the intoxicating fizz of Diet Coke.  But since it’s Prohibition, everyone drinks whiskey until the cops raid the speak-easies. The music, by Randy Newman, gooses the action along in a desperate effort to create an atmosphere of madcap Jazz Age insouciance, and the screenplay multiplies subplots in the same doomed cause. Before he was a football hero, Carter was a war hero, and Lexie aims to use her womanly wiles and her journalistic smarts to debunk his claims of battlefield glory.  This sets up a botched farcical climax that will require several viewings of Sturges’s “Hail the Conquering Hero” to chase from your mind.  Lexie, at least, has a clear goal in mind, which is more than can be said for “Leatherheads.” Mr. Clooney is known to be high-spirited as well as high-minded, and it’s perfectly reasonable that he would follow the earnest moral inquiry of “Good Night, and Good Luck” with a lighter, looser excursion into the American past. It is also interesting to note that all three of the movies he has directed (“Confessions of a Dangerous Mind” was the first) share a passing concern with the ethical problems of journalism and the conundrums of celebrity culture at various points in 20th-century history.  What is harder to comprehend is how Mr. Clooney turned out such a sloppy, haphazard and tonally incoherent piece of work. “Leatherheads” lurches hectically between Coen brothers-style pastiche and John Saylesian didacticism, while Mr. Clooney works his brow and his jaw and waits in vain for his charm to kick in and save the day. Unless he’s just vamping until the director shows up and gives him some clear instructions.  “Leatherheads” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual innuendo and comic violence. 

In his third spin behind the camera, George Clooney attempts one of the hardest things there is to do -- re-create the fizz of old Hollywood screwball comedies -- and creates just a mild buzz. �Leatherheads,� a larky romp about the early days of professional football, aims only to please and proves perfectly amiable, but ultimate effect is one of much energy expended to minimal payoff. Arch and funny in equal measure, this looks like a theatrical non-starter that Clooney fans and football devotees might be tempted to check out down the line on DVD or on the tube.
It�s always been hard to interest modern moviegoers in the early days of even the most popular sports -- �A League of Their Own� seems the well-liked anomaly in the field -- and Clooney goes about it here by giving a �20s story a �30s feel a la the madcap romantic comedies made by Howard Hawks, George Cukor, Frank Capra and others during the genre�s heyday.  
Establishing its throwback status by using a vintage Universal logo (just as �The Sting� did) and its jaunty attitude via period tunes, the film focuses on a moment, in 1925, when college football reigned and the so-called professional version was so derelict and disreputable it was threatened with extinction. Teams were made up of miners, farmers, high schoolers and men old enough to be the latter�s fathers, brawlers who drank on the field and knew nothing of rules. Sometimes it seemed there were as many people on the field as there were in the stands.
When the Duluth Bulldogs -- not the worst team around at the time -- are faced with bankruptcy, their leading player, Dodge Connolly (Clooney) hatches a scheme to recruit the nation�s most famous college player, Princeton�s Carter �The Bullet� Rutherford (John Krasinski, of TV�s �The Office�) to play for them. For $5,000 per game, Carter�s  well-heeled agent (Jonathan Pryce) agrees, further placated by Dodge�s platitudes about wanting to legitimize the game.
Carter is a big deal not only for his speed and brawn, but for his touted wartime heroics; like Sergeant York, he is celebrated for having single-handedly induced many Germans to surrender. But one newspaper editor (Jack Thompson) thinks Carter is a fake and assigns sassy reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) to �break the myth.�
Clooney, the other actors and the scripters, former Sports Illustrated reporters Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, clearly know the name of the game they�re playing; one feels their genuine desire for the film to look, sound and feel right, to recapture the spirit of the great old movies, and to convey a certain moment when the sport changed from a freewheeling, down-and-dirty game men played because they loved it, to something that suddenly involved enough money for rules, ethics and codes of conduct to be imposed.
Many of the genre requisites are accounted for -- a colorful cast of characters, rambunctious behavior, glamorous clothes and settings, and quick-witted repartee among good-looking people. Dodge and Lexie have initially opposing interests -- he needs Carter�s heroic image maintained for mercenary reasons, while she means to destroy it -- and the verbal duels in their one-on-one scenes are actually pretty good. Maybe a bit too good, however, as their exchanges sound so finely polished that they stand distinct from the talk in the rest of the film.
The romantic triangle also proceeds in fits and starts. Lexie and the tall, manly Carter seem to quickly take to one another, but as considerable time passes their relationship doesn�t really develop, while Dodge is obliged to watch from the sidelines even as he sneaks into Lexie�s sleeping car berth one night. There�s considerable joking about Lexie being too old for Carter and Dodge being too old for Lexie, although it wouldn�t seem that Clooney needs to hang up his romantic leading man spurs just yet.
Other incongruities emerge: World War I ended in 1918, so why is Carter only a junior at Princeton in 1925? And how is it that, shortly after it looked as though pro football was about to go belly-up, the game is being played at large stadiums in front of packed houses with the games broadcast on radio?
Resolution of the Carter scandal and the climactic gridiron contest, which resembles mud wrestling, are smoothly handled, although, once again, they feel like obligatory motions nicely executed rather than anything urgent or surpassingly entertaining. 
Physically, �Leatherheads� is entirely inviting. Newton Thomas Sigel bathes the South Carolina locations in an attractively autumnal amber. Working in immaculate concert are Jim Bissell�s vivid production design and Louise Frogley�s lively costumes; the opening scene, at a Princeton-Penn game where everyone in the crowd is beautifully dressed in long coats and hats, makes a striking impression. Randy Newman�s score has genuine flavor and avoids cliches (tunesmith appears briefly as a speakeasy piano player).
Led by their able player-coach Clooney, the pleasure-inducing cast performs with uniform spirit and energy. Peter Gerety all but takes over the latter stretch of the picture as the newly installed football commissioner; his looks and glances of complicity, warning and power-yielding are indelible. 


When Time  recently featured George Clooney  on its cover accompanied by the headline "The Last Movie Star "—not even a question mark at the end—you didn't have to read the article to know where it was coming from. After all, stars of the post-pubescent variety are an increasingly rare commodity these days, whereas Clooney, in just about everything he's done since he checked out of ER  , has seemed a supernova of effortless old-Hollywood  élan.
On-screen and off, Clooney is like a holdover from a time—which, admittedly, may only have ever existed in the movies—when men were witty gentlemen who knew how to dress, how to charm the pants off a lady, and how to throw a punch if the occasion called for it. All of which makes Clooney's third film as a director, Leatherheads , sound almost too good to be true: a screwball comedy set in the 1920s, with Clooney as a scrappy hustler trying to put a respectable face on the then (literally and figuratively) down-and-dirty sport of professional football. And the opening scenes of Leatherheads  are full of promise, as the vintage Universal Pictures  logo gives way to crowd of period extras cheering on Princeton  college-football phenom Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford (The Office   star John Krasinski ), all to the tune of composer Randy Newman 's jaunty, ragtime-flavored score. In fact, for its entire two hours, Leatherheads  is rarely less than very promising—and also rarely more.
The Leatherheads  screenplay, which was written by Sports Illustrated   journalists Duncan Brantley  and Rick Reilly  and given an uncredited polish by Clooney, offers a minor-key variation on that enduring bit of folk wisdom that, on the football field or the battlefield, America loves a good hero, regardless of whether he's genuine. ("Print the legend," you can practically hear the ghost of John Ford —and of Preston Sturges —saying.) Here, the self-made (or, rather, media-made) hero is Carter, who took time off from school to fight in World War I, where he is said to have singlehandedly caused the surrender of an entire company of German soldiers. That faint whiff of exaggeration is enough for The Chicago Tribune   to put its ace female reporter, Lexie Littleton  (Renée Zellweger ), on Carter's case, under the guise of writing a sycophantic puff piece. It's thus that Carter and Lexie come to cross paths with one Dodge Connelly  (Clooney), the down-on-his-luck captain of a nearly bankrupt pro-football team, the Duluth  Bulldogs. Where Carter regularly takes to the lush college field before a few thousand adoring fans, Dodge and his rag-tag teammates play on muddied, makeshift fields before crowds of a few . . . well, just a few. So Dodge, whose eyes twinkle with entrepreneurial invention, comes up with a plan for Carter to help save his pigskin.
It's an appealing screwball premise, and there's little question that Clooney has done his homework. He's decked out Leatherheads  with fast-talking ink-slingers who seem to have walked right out of The Front Page , a train that might have pulled out of the Twentieth Century 's station, and a battle-of-the-sexes bedroom scene borrowed from It Happened One Night . He's also cast actors who play very well in period mode, and the dialogue is strewn with rat-a-tat rejoinders.
So what's the problem, exactly? Partly that, for all that looks and sounds right here, Leatherheads  never quite feels  right.  The tempo seems a half-beat or so off Sturges or Hawks—it aims for clickety-clack and ends up closer to clickety-clunk. There are even a few long scenes, such as the first extended meeting between Carter, Dodge, Lexie, and Carter's self-interested agent (Jonathan Pryce ), during which the pace slows to a veritable crawl. And for all the novelty of setting a movie against the early days of that national religion known as the NFL, Leatherheads  devotes curiously little time to on-field action, even though that action makes up some of its liveliest scenes—the players' bodies a blur of muddy motion, the refs consulting their newly minted rule books before making calls. It's also, I think, the least visually adventurous of Clooney's three films—an intentional choice, according to the press notes, where Clooney and his cinematographer, Thomas Sigel  (who also shot, quite brilliantly, Clooney's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ), speak of their affection for the "static" filmmaking grammar of the '30s and '40s comedy classics to which Leatherheads  is an homage. But look closely at those films and you will see that while their directors didn't move the camera ostentatiously, when they did move it, they did so as elegantly as a camera has ever been moved.
These aren't easy criticisms to make. Clooney isn't just the "last movie star"—he may be the last of a breed of multi-hyphenate mini-moguls who use their charm and popular clout to back risky projects; indeed, in what have been generally bleak times for mainstream American movies, Clooney has done a great deal to sustain our belief in the possibilities of smart Hollywood movies for grown-ups. (And besides, screwball comedy is hard, and Leatherheads  is nothing if not an admirable stab.) My point is simply that Clooney makes us expect the best of him each and every time out, and Leatherheads  is a good deal less than that.
