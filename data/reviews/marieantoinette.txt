�Dear God, guide us and protect us,� whispers Louis XVI (Schwartzman) upon his coronation, after his father�s death from smallpox. �We are too young to reign.� Thus does writer/director Coppola render the story of his bride, the famous Marie-Antoinette (Dunst), and her court as a sort of 18th-century teenage riot, replete with a shopping montage set to Bow Wow Wow. There�s nothing terribly problematic about Coppola�s anachronistic New Wave needle-dropping, which halts before the Bastille falls and the tumbrels start rolling, but for a simple excess of it. Still, is there a more perfect soundtrack to a forbidden romp between a teenage princess and Count Axel von Fersen (Dior model Jamie Dornan) than �Kings of the Wild Frontier� by Adam & the Ants? Based upon British historian Antonia Fraser�s 2001 biography, Coppola�s script follows the 14-year-old dauphine to Versailles, where she is entirely divested of her Austrian heritage and subjected to humiliating domestic rituals before her court. (�This is ridiculous,� she scoffs to the Comtesse de Noailles � the excellently forbidding Davis � who replies matter-of-factly, �This is Versailles.�) Unable to arouse the ardor of her shy, puffy new husband � he prefers hunting and possibly men, it is rumored, and Coppola makes gentle sport of his strenuous eating habits � she sates herself on the pleasures the palace otherwise provides: finery, champagne, masked balls (cue Siouxsie & the Banshees), gambling, opium, gossip, pastries, opera, and her bucolic chateau. Her indulgences are entirely apolitical, born of youthful hedonism and the frustrated drive to maintain her royal foothold � and a tenuous alliance between Austria and France � in the absence of an heir. Finally, as motherhood transforms Marie-Antoinette into a more sympathetic figure, Dunst transforms, as well � from a callow pleasure-hound whose translucent beauty belies a well-aimed smirk to a grave and haunted woman, dead-eyed, wandering the halls of a empty palace while a mob gathers outside, calling for her head. It�s a fine performance, a true star turn. Don�t fear the film�s early reviews from Cannes, which too often slighted Marie Antoinette
 for being fluffy (it isn�t, though its heroine is) or ahistorical (it isn�t, though it is contemporary). In casting an all-American Jersey girl and surrounding her with Manolo Blahniks and the Strokes, Coppola draws a connection between her audience (domestically, at least) and the doomed dauphine, who is likewise insulated and distracted from her country�s pointless involvement in a disastrous foreign war that is bankrupting its government and starving its people � and all the while she spends, spends, spends.


Well, she never was the people's queen. In ``Marie Antoinette," Sofia Coppola's beguiling consideration of the teen monarch's controversial reign, she never gets around to it. Stuck in big, boring Versailles, while combat and famine seize Europe, Marie (Kirsten Dunst) orders shoes from Paris and gets fitted for dresses. She devours pastry, gets her hair done by a flamingly fabulous friend, and runs off to masquerade balls. This Austrian lass sounds and acts like a Southern California princess.
In the opening minutes, Marie arrives in a French forest, after an eternal carriage ride, for the handover ceremony between Marie and her French fiance, the Dauphin Louis Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). When her door pops open, slouched in her seat, she asks her loyal adviser (Steve Coogan), ``Are we there yet?"
The marriage is to unify her country and Louis's. And the gist of the story finds Marie under tremendous pressure from her family to seduce her boyishly asexual husband for an heir that will seal the Franco-Austrian alliance. For her part, Marie looks both enthralled with and skittish about her new assignment. She gains a husband, but she loses a dog. ``Mops!" Marie cries as someone takes away her tiny pocket pug.
What, you ask, is Coppola up to? ``The Simple Life Versailles " ? It's a tempting possibility, since the first quarter of ``Marie Antoinette" presents, in unsparing detail, the minutia of royal etiquette and Marie's annoyance with it.
One morning dressing ritual leaves her shivering naked as the woman of the highest rank wins the honor of slipping a gown over her. ``This is ridiculous," Marie snarls. The film makes delicate comedy of the spectacle that her marriage is required to be. Dozens stand by as she and Louis climb into bed for the first time. Scores look on as they sit before copious piles of food. Before there was reality television, there was this: reality tableaux vivant. But only up to a point is Dunst's Marie like a certain American heiress with fake-French trappings. And only up to a point is the filmmaker offering satirical commentary.
Does Coppola mean to tell us that were Marie Antoinette with us today that she'd listen to the Strokes and issue decrees via MySpace? Is it that she was just grossly misunderstood, as Antonia Fraser demonstrated in the terrific book that inspired this movie? Or does Coppola feel a bond with Marie as a tastemaker? As art, the movie is neither shallow nor profound, just inconsequential. Yet Coppola is too clever a filmmaker to dismiss the movie out of hand. If her film is mostly surface then she skims with style.
Here and there, the requisite chamber music falls away, and the yips and yowls of Gang of Four and Bow Wow Wow tear up the soundtrack. The costumes, by Milena Canonero, are works of art in themselves. Do yourself a favor and savor the detailing on each garment: The clothes are where all the drama is. Given Coppola's fashion-first approach, it's a miracle the film doesn't feel more like a long perfume ad. But the movie has atmosphere, beauty, spirit, and exquisite production design, photography, and editing.
Sometimes ``Marie Antoinette" feels like a knowing knock on tourism (let's make a movie about the French with American accents!), and a more intentional jab at American cluelessness than ``Lost in Translation," which for all its prettiness reduced Tokyo to a sideshow. Coppola just lacks the wisdom or the focus to crystallize any particular critical idea.
Her movie is cool, as a matter of fashion, yes, but also of mood. The film that occurred to me frequently during ``Marie Antoinette" was Stanley Kubrick's fastidious ``Barry Lyndon," from 1975, another self-conscious approach to 18th-century Europe, featuring Canonero's marvelous clothes. While Kubrick's film was far bigger in scope and more uptight, both movies operate at a comical emotional remove.
``Marie Antoinette" is also the more shameless work of hipsterism. Behold Marianne Faithfull as Marie's mother. Look: Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson as gossipy aristos. As Louis XV, Rip Torn plows through the movie like an enormous pig, and Asia Argento vamps along as his slutty mistress.
Dunst is more than a bauble, though. No one will mistake Coppola for a discursive screenwriter, so the actress doesn't have much to say. But the director provides ample opportunity to show what a marvelously transparent performer her star is. This is not a part that calls for fire or angst. It requires frolic, mirth, exasperation, and ennui, and I can think of no better woman in Hollywood for that job than Dunst. Who else can express boredom without seeming bored?
What you miss in ``Marie Antoinette" -- and in ``Lost in Translation," for that matter -- is the burning human urgency and aesthetic wit Coppola brought to 1999's ``The Virgin Suicides," her first and still her best movie. They're glimpsed only in the final shot of a trashed Versailles. The image is pure rock 'n' roll. We're to believe the revolutionaries did the smashing. But since Coppola doesn't say, who's to stop us from thinking Marie and the gang didn't demolish the place before she and Louis checked out?
It's in these last minutes that Coppola's faux-historical sheen proves surprisingly eloquent. She spares us details of the Terror. Yet as a carriage speeds away with Marie and Louis, we know the after-party is going to hurt.


         Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" opens with a shot of the last queen of France reclining on a chaise while a maid tends to her feet, surrounded by a parapet of pastries. On the soundtrack, the 1980s post-punk band Gang of Four belts out its class-baiting, anti-consumerist anthem, "Natural's Not in It." ("The problem of leisure / what to do for pleasure," it goes.) A confection herself, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) selects a pastel-colored macaroon from a tray and takes a nibble. The whole time she's gazing saucily at the camera as if to ask if we'd like to make something of it. Maybe we would.
 
  It's funny, when it's put to you this way, how much of the lore surrounding Marie Antoinette is dessert-related. Combine the cream-puff fashion and design sense, the infamous (and apocryphal) cake quip and the sweet retaliatory indulgence of her demise, and you get a clever, visually gorgeous theme that's both emblematic of an unfathomable life and somehow weirdly familiar.
 
 


         






   FOR THE RECORD:

  'Marie Antoinette': In Friday's Calendar section, the Motion Picture Assn. of America rating with the review of "Marie Antoinette" was given as PG. The film is actually rated PG-13 for sexual content, partial nudity and innuendo. —
 

 
  "Marie Antoinette" gives a wide berth to the conventions of period dramas, especially their time-capsule remove, and instead tries to mainline the singular personal experience of the arch-villainess of French history (and freedom history, for that matter). The result is a startlingly original and beautiful pop reverie that comes very close to being transcendent.
 
  Since the movie's premiere at Cannes, where legend has it was met with a chorus of boos (who was in the audience, Robespierre?), the reaction to the movie has been polarized. This sort of thing seems to happen a lot to big-budget, star-studded movies that look like Hollywood but feel like art-punk. The movie was inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography "Marie Antoinette: The Journey," a compassionate and thorough account (or so I understand) of the monarch's life. But Coppola is less interested in setting the historical record straight than in making an emotional connection to a misunderstood young girl whose coming-of-age took place under conditions familiar to a pampered zoo animal.
 
  The youngest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I and Maria Theresa, archduchess of Austria, a 14-year-old Marie Antoinette was shipped off to Versailles to marry the dauphin of France, thereby securing a fragile Franco-Austrian peace. Her mother (played by an imposing Marianne Faithfull) warns that the French court is not like the Austrian, and she's not kidding.
 
  From the moment the soon-to-be dauphine steps onto French soil, she finds herself trapped in a funhouse of bizarre protocol. From the ritual handing-off ceremony where her new chaperone, the Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis), rids her of every last scrap of her Austrian past — including her clothes and her puppy — almost to the day she and her husband, Louis XVI, get packed off to Paris by an angry mob, Marie Antoinette's life was at once cloistered and open to the public. The massive spectacle of her quickie wedding to the future king (played by Jason Schwartzman) is rivaled only by her well-attended wedding night, which is kicked off by a bed-consecration ceremony to which le tout
 Versailles apparently has ringside seats. This, unfortunately for Marie, is about as freaky as it gets. The marriage remains unconsummated for seven years — a fact of which everyone, her mother included, is mortifyingly well apprised.
 
  So begins a lonely, lost Marie Antoinette's transformation from dutiful, pliable daughter to party girl and eventual tabloid whipping post. (Pamphlets printed on illegal presses in Paris routinely portrayed her as anation-bankrupting hussy.) Trapped and powerless, she soldiers through the marriage and succumbs to the bizarre rituals and internecine rivalries of the court until the sudden death of the lusty and dynamic Louis XV (Rip Torn) grants the teenage couple the run of the country, at which point the queen begins to close ranks.
 
  What with the best-friend entourage (Mary Nighy as the Princesse Lamballe and Rose Byrne as the Duchesse de Polignac), the vindictive rival (Asia Argento as the infamous Du Barry), the gossipy hangers-on (Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson as Aunt Victoire and Aunt Sophie), the limitless credit, shopping addiction, round-the-clock partying, reckless gambling and public dissection of her love life, Marie Antoinette was the original teenage celebutante princess. And who better to empathize — and feel at home in the milieu — than Coppola? A style icon and member of Hollywood royalty herself, she slips easily into Marie Antoinette's beautiful, unbelievably whimsical shoes (which were designed for the movie by Manolo Blahnik), hooking into the soundtrack of her teenage years to impart the experience. Incidentally, and really quite beautifully, that particular period in pop corresponds with the transition from post-punk to New Wave to New Romanticism; that is to say, from yawping social criticism to desolation to ironic baroque decadence.
 
  Coppola has a soft spot for characters who live their lives at once cut off from and exposed to the world. And she captures the gilded-cage experience, in all its romantic decadence, like nobody else. The movie is at its strongest when it focuses on Marie Antoinette's private, sensual world, which — as she drifts into her much-mocked Rousseau-inspired pastoral phase, in which she attempts, in her inimitably artificial way, to connect with her natural self — becomes ever more abstract and cut off from reality. Dunst's sleepy, detached quality is perfectly suited to the character. What Marie Antoinette wants is to lose herself in a dream.
 
  Coppola empathizes with the queen's private suffering as well as with her detachment but recognizes this detachment as dangerous. At the beginning of the movie, Marie Antoinette is 14. At the end she's 34. The country is deeply in debt, bankrupted by excess and a foreign war (the American Revolution) it can't afford. Meanwhile, the queen has been trying to find herself through shopping.
 
  This feels not so much like a warning as a melancholy and resigned realization — which is interesting for a movie that aligns itself so closely with punk rebellion. Toward the end, I found myself waiting for clues to the coming eruption of reality. But when it finally comes, it feels cursory. Hermetically sealed inside Marie Antoinette's world, you don't see it coming, and you don't know what to make of it when it arrives. The hungry mob shows up waving pitchforks, and you half wonder if perhaps they might like a piece of cake.
 
 
 'Marie Antoinette'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for sexual content, partial nudity and innuendo
 
  A Columbia Pictures release. Writer-director Sofia Coppola. Producers Ross Katz, Coppola. Based on the book "Marie Antoinette: The Journey" by Antonia Fraser. Director of photography Lance Acord. Production designer KK Barrett. Editor Sarah Flack. Costume designer Milena Canonero. Music producer Brian Reitzell. Running time: 2 hours.
 
  In general release.   

Pampered princess, poor little rich girl, misused celebrity, lonely bubblehead, underappreciated trendsetter who misses her subscription to the 18th-century equivalent of TEEN PEOPLE   the adolescent queen envisioned by writer-director Sofia Coppola in Marie Antoinette  is, at one time or other, all of these lost clotheshorses. And since this is Ms. Coppola we're talking about, stylish and soft-spoken Godfather  royalty from the Hollywood kingdom herself, it's tempting to read autobiographical identification into the filmmaker's madly chic, tauntingly shallow biopic, set during the young queen's married life. Following Lost in Translation  (in which a lonely, effortlessly hip girl rattled around Japan), here's Coppola's Lost in Versailles . In this rarefied universe, the privileged go shopping while, unseen and unheard until the very end when they storm the palace, the less style-conscious masses apparently get by on their own.
It's tempting to search for autobiography, yes, but too easy: This yummy-looking, artfully personal historical fantasia, borne on currents of melancholy and languor and rocking out to a divine soundtrack of 1980s New Romantic pop music (plenty of the Cure, Bow Wow Wow, and Adam Ant), is the work of a mature filmmaker who has identified and developed a new cinematic vocabulary to describe a new breed of post-postpostfeminist woman. And that contemporary creature is also of the artist's own invention.
Call that girl…Kirsten Dunst, a vision of bewildered loveliness as the 14-year-old Marie of Austria, betrothed, in a political deal, to the even more bewildered 15-year-old future Louis XVI of France, played by Jason Schwartzman. (The marriage was famously unconsummated for seven years due to the child king's withering lack of sexual know-how.) With her winning touch of girlfriend-of-Spider-Man resilience and the easy, modern way she wears her formidable ball gowns, Dunst embodies the teen girl of today and  of more than 200 years ago. And in returning to the star of her first feature, The Virgin Suicides , as muse, the filmmaker wisely lets Dunst set the movie's tone of voluptuous lostness.
Marie Antoinette  uses Antonia Fraser's marvelous 2001 biography as a reference, but Coppola's movie views the world through the young queen's eyes. And eventually, that narrow POV loses focus and veers toward distractedness as the seriousness of the brewing revolution becomes clearer. Instead, friendless in an adopted  country strangled by its own demands of etiquette (Judy Davis is a hoot as the worst of the sticklers, the Comtesse de Noailles) and unable to arouse her husband, Marie turns to luxury as solace  cakes, jewels, parties, shoes. Was she a flibbertigibbet,  a casualty of gossip and mean press coverage, a Princess Diana before her time? Coppola's stranded royal suggests that at heart, Marie Antoinette was just a simple girl who wanted to have fun, and got her head handed to her.

 “The problem of leisure/What to do for pleasure.”  The opening lines of “Natural’s Not in It,” by the Gang of Four, are the first words in Sofia Coppola’s “Marie Antoinette,” and they suggest one of that film’s paradoxical themes: The pursuit of sensual delight is trivial compared with other undertakings — just as “the problem of leisure” is surely more of a privilege than a burden — but pleasure is also serious, one of the things that gives life its shape and meaning.  It may be tempting to greet “Marie Antoinette” with a Jacobin snarl or a self-righteous sneer, since it is after all the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence. But where’s the fun in such indignation? And, more seriously, where is the justice? To say that this movie is historically irresponsible or politically suspect is both to state the obvious and to miss the point.  “Marie Antoinette,” which will be shown tonight and tomorrow  at the New York Film Festival and opens next Friday,  is a thoroughly modern confection, blending insouciance and sophistication, heartfelt longing and self-conscious posing with the guileless self-assurance of a great pop song. What to do for pleasure? Go see this movie, for starters.  “Natural’s Not in It” (speaking of great pop songs) blasts over the electrifying pink-and-black opening titles, kicking us into 18th-century Versailles with a jolt of anachronism. (Later there is some period-appropriate Rameau to go with the 80’s post-punk Ms. Coppola favors, and a high-top sneaker tucked amid the fabulous ancien régime couture.)  But despite all the bodices and breeches, the horse-drawn coaches and elaborate perukes, “Marie Antoinette” is only masquerading as a costume drama. It would be overstating the case to call it a work of social criticism, but beneath its highly decorated surface is an examination, touched with melancholy as well as delight, of what it means to live in a world governed by rituals of acquisition and display. It is a world that Ms. Coppola presents as exotic and unreal — a baroque counterpart to the Tokyo of “Lost in Translation” — but that is not as far away as it first seems.  Ms. Coppola, who drew upon Antonia Fraser’s revisionist biography of Marie Antoinette, “Marie Antoinette: The Journey,” in preparing her script, is less a historian than a pop anthropologist, and her portrait of the young queen, played with wily charm by Kirsten Dunst, is not so much a psychological portrait as a tableau of mood and atmosphere. Highly theatrical and yet also intimate and informal, “Marie Antoinette” lets its story slink almost casually through its lovingly composed and rendered images.    The costumes, designed by Milena Canonero, are arresting; K K Barrett’s production design is appropriately sumptuous; and Lance Acord’s cinematography catches both the swirls of high-fashion color and the quieter, candlelighted tones of the French court. No mere backdrop, Versailles, where much of “Marie Antoinette” was shot, is the film’s subject and, in some respects, its star. Like Hollywood — which it resembles in some interesting and hardly accidental particulars — Versailles is a place with an aura and a power of its own, with an almost mystical ability to warp the lives of those who, by accident or choice, come to dwell on its grounds.  Marie is, at first, very much an outsider, summoned from Austria as a 14-year-old to be the bride of the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Crossing the border, she is stripped of her clothes and her beloved pug, Mops, and welcomed into a world of rigorously observed, often ridiculous forms.  Her chaperone, the Comtesse de Noailles, is played by Judy Davis, who seems to have had extra tendons added to her neck for the role. The comtesse’s job is to instruct Marie in French protocol, and she is only one of several figures who shuffle into the princess’s line of sight every now and then to offer scolding, advice and instruction. Others include Count Mercy D’Argenteau (Steve Coogan) and Joseph of Austria (Danny Huston), Marie’s beloved older brother, who also counsels her husband on some delicate matters of conjugal duty, about which the young man seems to have no clue.  The poor would-be king is in some ways even more lost than his bride, who has a spark of mischief and an extravagant sense of style. Louis is overshadowed by his grandfather, Louis XV (Rip Torn), a rambunctious old goat whose fleshly appetites seem not to have been passed down to his heir.  Mr. Schwartzman mumbles and bumbles, looking younger and softer than he has in previous films, and quietly showing the pathos of this hapless boy’s situation. He is happiest out hunting with his pals or tinkering with locks, and he quite literally does not know what to do with the girl that fate has tossed into his bed. The royal marriage is unconsummated for seven years, and the absence of new blood in the royal line becomes grist for gossip and a potential political crisis.  Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson are two of the principal mean girls of Versailles, and their chosen scapegoat is the elder Louis’s mistress, Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), who is also Marie’s rival for influence at court. The mingling of private matters with affairs of state is a hallmark of this kind of monarchy, and in Ms. Coppola’s hands the analogies to modern celebrity culture are simultaneously clear and subtle. Marie’s life is one of obscene entitlement, but it is also heavily constrained, and the story the film tells is of her efforts to accommodate her headstrong, spirited individualism to the strictures of her role as queen.  She is profligate and self-indulgent, yes, impetuously ordering up shoes, parties and impromptu trips to Paris. She breaks with tradition by applauding at the opera, and then appears onstage herself. She takes a lover — a dashing Swedish nobleman — and turns Petit Trianon, a royal retreat that was a gift from her husband, into a kind of Versailles V.I.P. room, where she drinks, gardens, reads Rousseau and plays shepherdess. These activities have often been mocked — and were the source of scandal and outrage in the years before the revolution — but through Ms. Coppola’s eyes they are poignant as well as a bit silly.  And the film’s visual extravagance somehow conveys its heroine’s loneliness as well as the sheer fun of aristocratic life. We know how this story ends, and Ms. Coppola refrains from showing us the violent particulars, or from sentimentalizing her heroine’s fate, preferring to conclude on a quiet, restrained note that registers the loss of Marie’s world as touchingly as the rest of the film has acknowledged her folly, her confusion and her humanity.  “Marie Antoinette” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has glimmers of sexuality and brief glimpses of naked flesh amid all the fabulous clothes.  MARIE ANTOINETTE  Tonight and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival; opens nationwide next Friday.  Directed by Sofia Coppola; written by Ms. Coppola, based on the book by Antonia Fraser; director of photography, Lance Acord; edited by Sarah Flack; production designer, K K Barrett; produced by Ms. Coppola and Ross Katz; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 123 minutes.  Tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 3 p.m.  at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center.  WITH: Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), Jason Schwartzman (King Louis XVI), Rip Torn (King Louis XV), Judy Davis (Comtesse de Noailles), Asia Argento (Madame du Barry), Marianne Faithfull (Empress Maria Teresa), Danny Huston (Joseph), Molly Shannon (Aunt Victoire), Steve Coogan (Count Mercy D’Argenteau), Rose Byrne (Duchesse de Polignac) and Shirley Henderson (Aunt Sophie). 
"Let them have eye candy" pretty much sums up Sofia Coppola's approach to her revisionist and modernist take on the famous royal airhead who in the end lost her head. It is far from unpleasant to watch an attractive cast led by Kirsten Dunst parading around Versailles accoutered in Milena Canonero's luxuriant costumes to the accompaniment of catchy pop tunes. But the writer-director's follow-up to her breakthrough second feature, "Lost in Translation," is no more nourishing than a bonbon. Opening in France simultaneously with its Cannes bow, "Marie Antoinette" will depend for Stateside success in October release by Sony on its draw with teen girls and young women, who may warmly embrace the picture as a heady fantasy of luxury and riches.
Conceptually, Coppola has reconceived the tale of the Austrian princess sent to France at age 14 to marry the 15-year-old future king of France as one of a girl who would just rather have fun. Costumes and decor conform to correct historiography, but otherwise the film more closely resembles a story of a youngster moving to a new high school, with its environment of gossip and petty rivalries, than it does any previous screen account of pre-revolutionary France.
To her credit, Coppola makes it surprisingly easy to swallow her conceit of laying out momentous history against a backdrop of contempo tunes, largely by not dealing with the history at all. Aside from the mounting pressure on the young bride to produce an heir, there is very little plot here; palace intrigue, political strategizing, scandal and accounts of growing unrest in the country are all but forsaken, the better to concentrate on the repetitive rituals of royal life and to evoke the virtual cocoon in which she lives.
On its own terms, the approach succeeds. From the moment Marie Antoinette arrives by gilded coach at the French border and, in a historically correct scene, is required to strip entirely naked to divest herself of all things Austrian, the film evinces a symbiosis with its subject in its fascination with the trappings of privilege and the behavior of the upper class, and not a speck of interest in the chess game of diplomacy or conditions outside the immediate realm of concern. As a portrait of oblivious self-absorption, it's letter-perfect.
With its tightly framed shots of Marie Antoinette's arrival showing off the costumes' fabrics in intimate detail, and with evident free rein to film all round Versailles, the film revels in its setting without ostentation. Mild comedy ensues from the presence of a large retinue, led by a bishop, presiding over Marie Antoinette and young Louis (Jason Schwartzman) bedding down on their wedding night, and persists in its scrutiny of the continued, and increasingly worrisome, failure by the teenage couple to consummate their marriage. When Marie Antoinette's older brother Joseph (Danny Huston) comes all the way from Austria to educate Louis on successful bedroom conduct, one would dearly love to hear the conversation.
But here, as elsewhere, Coppola avoids writing, or filming, involved dialogue scenes, as if aware she can't pull off anything too complicated. Despite the vast number of people onscreen in many sequences, scarcely any scenes feature sustained group dynamics, multiple moves, ambitious staging or numerous characters interrelating verbally. To get around this, she tends to attractively and straightforwardly film individuals or simple groupings and then lay in the desired content via voiceover snippets of letters, isolated conversational snippets or, better yet, songs that can simply be played over a brief montage of shots. It's an easy-listening style of filmmaking, where the basic visual notes are hit but complexities, nuances and deeper meanings remain ignored.
To pull off such an approach, great flair would be a help. This is not forthcoming, so one must be content with watching the lovely, perfectly cast Dunst adroitly making her way through a succession of scenes in which not much more is asked of her than to effortlessly hold center screen for two hours � a task she handles as if it were second nature. Dunst's Marie Antoinette reacts to the pressures of the court as if nothing all that significant were at stake and, later, adapts gracefully to the role of mother and queen, with time out for some fun at balls and the theater and a dalliance (historically questionable) with a Swedish count. Her happiest moments occur at her private preserve in and around Le Petit Trianon, where she luxuriates in well-manicured "nature" and coddles her adored children.
When "the mob" finally materializes, the movie is practically over; Marie Antoinette's insulation from the common people and their discontent has been virtually total. Coppola avoids famous incidents that would normally make up the essence of drama: the affair of the necklace that so seriously stained her reputation, the chance discovery of the royal family as it fled; the king and queen's imprisonment and eventual execution. High schoolers won't be able to use info they learn here to pass any history tests.
Production looks plush without being extravagant. Some of the distinctive supporting thesps never really pop out of the backgrounds for lack of anything interesting to do, but several others have their moments. Despite his inescapable Americanism, Rip Torn projects vitality and a strong regal bearing as King Louis XV; Schwartzman grows appreciably into his problematic role as the initially disinterested, uncommunicative dauphin; Huston's urbane self-confidence suits his royal role perfectly; and Steve Coogan's wry circumspection gives the right edge to his role as the queen's personal advisor.

Drop-dead hip or cluelessly clueless? Sofia Coppola 's Marie Antoinette  , a candy-colored portrait of France's infamous teen queen, screening this weekend at the New York Film Festival  before opening next Friday, is a graceful, charming, and sometimes witty confectionat least for its first hour.
The famously shy Coppola may be an inscrutable personality, but her bold exposé of backstage royalty opens with a big wink and a few crashing chords, courtesy of Gang of Four . A slice of Austrian apple strudel imported to marry the 15-year-old French dauphin, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst ) arrives nakedly vulnerable in Versailles . Here, as with Coppola's previous features, an unformed young woman must find her way in a confusing, if stylish, worldit's as though the defining moment in the filmmaker's artistic life was her arrival as a 20-year-old actress on the set of Dad's Godfather III .
Coppola, who not only directed but also wrote the screenplay, has no sense of being overawed by her material. Where The Virgin Suicides  and Lost in Translation  were dreamy, Marie Antoinette is more like marvy. (The director's preferred term is "girly.") Largely shot on location at Versailles, the movie is purposefully hermetic. If it were a prison film, which in some ways it is, the title might be The Big Doll House . Marie finds herself in a hissing snake pit where the devil wears Prada  and goodness knows what else. She soon gets a white-wig makeover and a closet full of satin hoopskirts, but her position is scarcely secure. Everyone in this kingdom of gossip knows that her marriage to the awkward prince (Jason Schwartzman ) has yet to be consummatedlet alone produce an heir.
Basically a small story in a gilded frame, with relatively little dialogue to distract from the spectacle, Marie Antoinette  is not without a certain vérité. When it premiered at Cannes , few foreign journalists missed the opportunity to compare the rigid hierarchies and inexplicable protocols of the French court to those of the film festival. (Marie's naive complaint, "This is ridiculous," squelched by the haughty rejoinder, "This, madam, is Versailles," got the movie's biggest laugh.) Coppola, who directed what remains Scarlet Johansson 's least mannered performance, here "documents" Dunst's innocent boredom as she takes solace in jewels, clothes, and sweets. The ruling complex is more edible than Oedipal.
Marie Antoinette 's sanitized view of 18th-century hygiene is as tasteful as its deferentialand seemingly unappreciatedFrancophilia. Although widely touted (not just by Coppola family retainers) as a leading contender for the Palme d'Or, Marie Antoinette  was greeted at Cannes with sour boos. Indeed, likely miffed by her movie's contemptuous reception, Coppola seems to have violated one of the festival's sacred rituals by blowing off the traditional post-premiere banquet hosted by Cannes supremo Gilles Jacobleaving early with her dad in tow.
Such petulance, if that's what it was, is understandable. Cued by Bow Wow Wow 's "I Want Candy," Coppola's pink-and- pistachio color schemes and sugar-frosted mise-en-scéne, all heaps of haute cuisine and powdered towers of hair, are nothing if not easy on the eye. (As a representation of the late-18th-century good life, her images are closer in their shiny opulence to Fragonard's paintings than Watteau's.) There's no disputing Coppola's adroit party- planning or her delicious casting. Talking from the side of his mouth as though swapping yarns at the Lion's Head, Rip Torn  makes a swaggering Louis XV; a confidently skanky Asia Argento  is no less hilarious as his paramour Madame Du Barry . Coppola cousin Schwartzman is suitably diffident as the future Louis XVI***  . Steve Coogan and Judy Davis are droll courtiers; Marianne Faithfull  is an appropriately grand Empress Maria Theresa .
When the king dies, the young people are stunned, but Mariewhose Valley Girl enthusiasm has already inspired a snooty opera audience to applaud the showrises to the occasion. Cover girl avant la lettre , she becomes queen of the all-night rave, takes a lover, and, with motherhood, creates her own domain. (Like the NYFF's opening court pageant The Queen , Marie Antoinette  seems haunted by the specter of Diana Spencer , another royally persecuted broodmare who, as noted by Camille Paglia , also met a violent end, pursued by the mobin France, no less.)
Carefree proprietress of a miniature play farm, Marie A. takes the notion of a people's princess literally. She masquerades as a milkmaid and reads Rousseau to her ladies-in-waitingas if. What could be more decadent than such fashionista rusticity? Coppola, however, is temperamentally unable to distinguish history from personality and personality from dress-up; the filmmaker's attempt to redeem her heroine's shallowness reveals her own. The more problematic aspects of Marie's reignthe embarrassing "affair of the necklace," her mega-Imelda clothes budget, and likely treason against the revolutionare airbrushed away.
Marie's gravitas arrives like a bolt from the blue; the bubble bursts and the movie crashes definitively to earth at the moment when, informed of her legendary one-liner, the queen turns all, like, serious: "I would never say that." Whatever. Coppola ends on the image of a tragically trashed imperial boudoir. Let 'em lick icing.
