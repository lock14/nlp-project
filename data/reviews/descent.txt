Is The Descent
 the
 horror film to beat for the foreseeable future? That depends, I suppose, on a number of things, not the least of which is how horrific you find the notion of watching a sextet of city folk take to the Great Outdoors without benefit of either John Boorman or �Dueling Banjos.� Granted, the outdoorsy types here are all female, and there�s not a Ned Beatty among them, although pretty much everyone ends up squealing like a pig at one point or another. But still, you�d think that we as a species would have picked up a thing or two from Burt Reynolds� foray into the Georgian no-man�s-land: Forced by that which is within us to test our mettle against boundless nature, we always come up short, and occasionally in pieces, howling like mad at our own stubborn inability to stay put and read a good Joe R. Lansdale book. Fortune favors the brave? Not bloody likely, and certainly not in the North Carolina Appalachians (doubled by Scotland), where spelunking troupers Sarah (MacDonald), Juno (Mendoza), Beth (Reid), Rebecca (Mulder), Sam (Buring), and Holly (Noone) have assembled to wipe away the horrors of one year previous, when blunt-force tragedy struck Sarah�s family and ultimately nearly did her in as well. After an affecting reunion of these women � with only the barest of tough-girl clich�s visible � and an extremely well-paced and -written series of expository dialogues, the real meat of director Marshall�s horror show begins to take shape. The outing is alpha-female Juno�s surprise for the lot: She�s discovered a new, unexplored, subterranean cavern in the area, and this is her gift to her friends. Despite misgivings (uncharted caves can be dicey propositions, even in the harsh light of day), the group heads off into the unknown, and it�s not long at all before one disaster after another occurs and then � things with teeth
 show up. Things with pale, distended, and, most importantly given the nature of The Descent
, empty
 bellies. Marshall directed the justly praised werewolves-versus-British-soldiers-in-Scotland film Dog Soldiers
 a few years back, and, if anything, The Descent
 manages to ratchet up both the carnage (this is an extremely wet
 bloodbath) and his basic premise, which remains, �What happens to professionals when they encounter a contingency nobody planned for?� The answer, it will come as no surprise, has razor teeth and ghastly claws, fully extended. What The Descent
 does is take the woodsy, above-ground nightmare of Dog Soldiers
 and drag it down to, well, if not hell, then somewhere awfully nearby. It�s a smart move on Marshall�s part. I watched a special screening of this film in a real cave, underground, in the dark, and while the presence of an army of like-minded gorehounds did little to kick up my hackles, that primal fear of being buried alive � out of sight of the sun, of the sky, of anything at all but coffin-ready perma-night � worked wonders for my love of unencumbered daytime. Claustrophobic in a fun way while maintaining a brutally grim (but not so grim that domestic distributor Lions Gate kept the director�s unequivocally downbeat ending) tone to the bitter end, The Descent
 may not be everything you�ve heard, but man, it�s also a lot of things you haven�t.


``The Descent" is a new British horror movie that leaves us exactly where we want to be at a film about six women stranded in a cave several miles underground -- afraid of how in the dark we are, literally and otherwise.
It all begins with a lack of promise. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald ) loses her husband and daughter in a car accident. A year later she joins some friends, a group of outdoorsy types, for spelunking and rock-climbing in North Carolina . The women giggle about one friend's pajamas, talk about men, and throw food at each other. It all feels like the start of a bad lesbian drama or an ad for herbal tea. But we're meant to savor the cheesiness. This is as happy as things get.
It seems that in her quest for pioneering glory, Sarah's ultra-jock pal, Juno (Natalie Mendoza ), has intentionally left the guidebook in the car and led the gang into a cave that wasn't on the itinerary. (``That other cave was for tourists," she sneers.) The ladies find themselves lost and clueless about how to get out. (The mysterious scribbling on the wall might be trying to tell them something. Maybe that an M. Night Shyamalan film is playing in the adjacent cave.)
Being trapped is a terrible situation for them and great news for us, because right around the time that Holly (Nora-Jane Noone ), the ``mentalist who jumps off buildings," plummets down a hole and breaks her leg, the movie starts to treat us to the unspeakable wickedness that surrounds them. Namely, it's a gang of perfectly evolved, pale-skinned batmen, who look like fanged condoms. The cave is their home, and these girls are what's for dinner.
Before the feasting begins there is plenty of time to appreciate that these women will not be easy prey. They're brave, resourceful, educated, athletic, willing to fight, and their clothes stay on. (For lad-mag subscribers, this summer's wet T-shirt drought persists.) The movie doesn't do too much to flesh out all six women. So since five are from the United Kingdom I was forced to label them: Spiky Spice, Passive-Aggressive Spice, Post-Traumatic Spice, etc.
Selfish Juno appears to be the lone American; her decision to drag a bunch of unsuspecting Englishpeople into hostile territory under false pretenses might strike some as a tad presidential. Really, though, she's a woman who will stop at nothing to survive. She's actually Sigourney Spice.
It's nice to get a British movie that stars no dames, although you can imagine a sequel set 30 years later, with Judi Dench as Sarah and Helen Mirren as Juno, rappelling alongside Imelda Staunton and Julie Walters . I'll let them fight over who'd be Old Spice.
Until then, ``The Descent" works quite effectively. Writer-director Neil Marshall has some fun with the woman-in-jeopardy conventions of the slasher-horror flicks from the 1970s and 1980s . And the gotcha editing and use of shadows give the movie mischievous style.
Mercifully, this is not the hackwork you expect from a Lions Gate release. A Shakespearean seed of doubt is planted about one of the women's motives, and a functioning video camera contributes a texture of grainy, ghoulish realism to the proceedings. (That device actually makes you realize the film might be too polished, and that the illusion of truth digital video creates would have made the movie enjoyably harder to take.)
Otherwise there are the women themselves to admire. Of course, one doesn't pique our interest until she's vengeful and blood-soaked, evoking the ghost of Sissy Spacek's prom-night Carrie. Her graduation from scaredy-cat to wraith-like superhero is perfect for a movie whose characters wend their way through a rocky womb and its birth-canal labyrinths only to pop triumphantly through the earth at the end. That's when we know we've witnessed something special. A cult classic is born.


No disrespect for my own gender is intended when I say that women are traditionally the shriekier sex in horror movies. And sure enough, some of the femme adventure junkies who willingly climb into a foreboding, unmapped cave deep in the Appalachian Mountains in The Descent  are inclined to let loose some mighty screams. But that's only because, in the prelude adventure that opens Neil Marshall's wily, exhilarating, and psychologically canny modern horror pic, the girls negotiate perilous white-water cascades in bobbing rafts  and triumph!
To a woman, the six friends who meet up a year later for some extreme spelunking in this rewardingly terrifying little British production  a boo!  beaut out of 2006 Sundance  are specimens of resourcefulness and physical conditioning; to watch them revel in what their muscles (and some cool technical gear) can do in such a dark, claustrophobic landscape is a marvel. And Marshall, whose 2002 cult-hit creep-out Dog Soldiers  featured six guys plus werewolves in the Scottish woods, hints at just enough psychic unease among the women (some nursing emotional scars from an accident following that rafting trip) to foreshadow trouble even before things go wrong underground. Terribly wrong. ''Hey, there's something down here,'' one member of the party observes, in classic giggle-and-shiver language right out of the horror-flick bible. Before long, each woman is battling for her life against predators that  well, let's just say Gollum might be a distant relative of these monstrous nightmares-made-flesh.
The bowels of the earth, the pit of madness, the collective unconscious, the elemental feminine core  call it what you want, Marshall is thoughtfully postfeminist enough to leave room in his scary story for metaphoric musing on the nature of femaleness  assuming there's any time left between the jumping and screaming his playful pacing incites. Without being so crass as to assign ''types,'' he suggests a little something in each woman that contradicts her athletic confidence and messes with the myth of female cooperation. (Are the members of this sorority capable of turning on one another?) And although he'd never suggest that all men are slime, he doesn't stint on the scummy ruthlessness of his humanoid cave dwellers.
Working with an admirably toned cast of not-so-known players (among them Edinburgh-raised TV actress Shauna Macdonald as the jumpiest of the sextet and Moulin Rouge 's Natalie Mendoza as the most mysterious), the director of The Descent  is savvy enough to suggest even more than he shows. And he's old-school enough to load up on glimpses of good, clean, gruesome gore. Made with a connoisseur's love of muck, blood, inky darkness, and equal parts elegance and ewwww , The Descent  raises the level of the post-“Blair Witch , post-“Open Water  horror game.

 The babes are buff and the scares bountiful in “The Descent,” a full-throttle horror freakout about six women on a caving expedition. This is the second feature from the British filmmaker Neil Marshall, who four years ago set loose a pack of protein-starved werewolves in “Dog Soldiers,” tossing in some explosions and novelty-shop entrails along the way. In the years since, Mr. Marshall has learned a couple of important lessons, notably that for sheer visceral impact, few images beat that of a woman slicked head to toe in blood — think “Carrie” — save for, of course, the image of that same woman unleashing unholy terror.  By the time Mr. Marshall tips his hat to that Brian De Palma classic (along with “Alien” and “Apocalypse Now,” among other touchstones), a few of the cavers have bitten the dust, or rather have been shredded to bits. As might be expected, there are monsters on the prowl in “The Descent,” and while they’re shriek-worthy, they aren’t the only things stirring up trouble. The women stir their share, as we discover when Mr. Marshall throws out his first big shock, which arrives with a surprisingly hard jolt in the first few minutes. Not long after, two friends, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and Beth (Alex Reid), are motoring toward an adventure that will find them crawling through tunnels and over somewhat trickier metaphoric ground.  Set deep in a remote pocket of the Appalachian Mountains (actually Scotland and some superbly tricked-out soundstages), the film hinges on the kind of extreme caving that marks the women as gutsy or reckless or maybe even insane, depending on how you view belly-crawling through passageways only slightly wider than your body. Because these six are exceedingly fit, though more in a cinematic than in an athletic sense, they can squeeze through breath-impedingly narrow spaces, a seeming advantage that soon works to their catastrophic disadvantage. If any of these women were packing serious muscle or an ounce of hip fat, this story would end dramatically differently. Then again, if any of these cavers also behaved like responsible outdoorswomen, this would play out like a Discovery Channel special, not a fantastical chiller.  It’s under a canopy of deep-woods green that Sarah and Beth meet up with the other cavers, their friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) and Sam (MyAnna Buring). Each is meant to come loaded with a distinguishing accent or visual marker, but outside of Ms. Mendoza, the only nonwhite cast member and one tough-looking hottie; the appealing Ms. Noone, who starred in “The Magdalene Sisters”; and Ms. Reid, who delivers the most credible performance, the women tend to blur. That’s true even of Sarah, who comes to the trip bearing weighty emotional baggage and is meant to serve as the point of empathetic entry, which she could be if Mr. Marshall had worked as hard on his characters as on his scare tactics.  After an evening of giggles and beer, and an uneasy new dawn, the women get down to the business at hand: they slap on their helmets and gear and lower themselves into a yawning cave. What follows is a sensationally entertaining escalation of frights, the kind that make you wiggle and squirm as you alternately laugh at your own gullibility and marvel at the filmmaker’s cunning and craft. And what is all the better, and indeed helps make “The Descent” one of the better horror entertainments of the last few years, is how Mr. Marshall, working with the resourceful cinematographer Sam McCurdy, messes with our heads long before the monsters do — simply by tapping into one of our most primitive fears, that of the dark.  With a nod to childhood, Mr. Marshall carves out an increasingly unsettling and claustrophobic shadow world principally by keeping the lights down. He also toys with color, interspersing the white beams from the women’s headlamps with washes of green and red from their glow-sticks and flares. The ingenious palette adds to the spooky beauty of the otherworldly setting, which, with its vaultlike chambers, wavy crawlways and spiky stalactites, takes on unmistakable sexual overtones, particularly as the women’s breathing becomes more labored, and their shirts grow clingy with sweat. Like Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley, who runs around in “Alien” wearing a peekaboo shirt and panties, the women in “The Descent” are sexualized, though only up to that critical moment when being a girl takes a back seat to being a survivor.  If “The Descent” boils down to little more than the survival of the fittest (and nastiest), a Darwinian soap opera for the Just Do It generation, it is also indisputably and pleasurably nerve-jangling. The American edition comes with a nominally more upbeat ending than the British original, but it’s basically just kill or be killed, and with as much eyeball-gouging, neck-gnawing, head-bashing and outright fear-mongering as possible. The film has neither the aesthetic grandeur nor the mythic resonance of “Alien,” which stays in your body long after the goose bumps have retreated. But its B-movie minimalism is fairly irresistible, as are those swarming monsters that, designed to the director’s specifications, look like a cross between Iggy Pop and a bat. If that’s not a recommendation, I don’t know what is.  “The Descent” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film’s extreme gore seems a nibble away from an NC-17.
The old Lucas/Spielberg stunt of turning B-movie peekaboos into E-ticket thrill rides remains the industry standardto the virtual exclusion of other multiplex fare, particularly when school's out. But as not every kid who remade Raiders  in Super 8 either gave up the dream or morphed into Michael Bay , there's at least one next-generation movie brat whose acrobatic genre workouts have lingered below budgetary ground zero without going straight to video helland his name is Neil Marshall . Just how unique is this penny-pinching wrangler of seven-foot-tall werewolves and cave-dwelling gargoyle people-eaters? Not since John Sayles  and Joe Dante  unleashed Piranha  and The Howling  on Hollywood 's New Morning  have two features torn open the horror movie with the cut-rate ferocity and gleeful disreputability of Marshall's Dog Soldiers and The Descent both made without CGI or celebrities (and, as you might guess, without U.S. financing, either).
Whatever this thirtysomething Brit auteur lacks in satiric savvy (a lot, alas) he recoups through cheeky showmanship, razor-sharp 35mm shooting in low light (Michael Mann  might want to rewire that HD cam), and as much Karo syrup as he can spill. Dog Soldiers , Marshall's brutal, hilarious debut, takes all of two minutes to dismember its first pair of lycanthrope victims, a young couple making out in a tent. (Wolves at the door, indeed: One zipper pull leads to another in Marshall's camp.) Comparatively subdued, The Descent  waits a full three  minutes to commence its bloodbath: A road-tripping dad and young daughter are swiftly skewered in one of those Omen -style highway accidents (ingeniously staged by the director), leaving poor Mom (Shauna Macdonald ) to suffer guilt-tinged nightmares. After a year of mourning (offscreen, of course), our Scottish heroine Sarah is coaxed into an Appalachian cave-diving expedition with her clique of absurdly extreme sportswomenthe sort who like to hang upside down from rocks and crawl through body-sized crevices several miles below ground. In one such tight spot, Sarah, stricken with both claustrophobia and enduring grief, takes momentary solace from one of her five fellow spelunkers (indistinguishable except for the one who's a ruthless bitch): "The worst thing that could've happened to you has already happened."
Hardly. If Dog Soldiers  is Platoon  at war with Predator , The Descent , once its army of slithering, sharp-toothed hominoid fiends traps the women in its maze-like lair, is an underground Aliens  with shades of the mid-'50s Mole People . In the great B tradition, Marshall gets a lot out of nothing, the dark in particular: A good half of the wide screen is pitch-black much of the time; although this genre excavator begins his subterranean adventure with a half-dozen flashlights, one strapped to each woman's helmet, that number quickly decreases as horror conventions require. Exploring gender as well as genre, Dog Soldiers  and The Descent  play out differently (let's just say the Lone Wolf is no Final Girl), but both are barebones survivalist shockers by a fanboy populist who clearly relishes the challenge of being out of time, low on ammo, down to his last two shots. Released stateside in August to capitalize on blockbuster burnout, The Descent  stands to scare up a fortune, which could threaten the career of a director whose resistance to budgetary bloat has been his rarest virtue. Marshall's jolly command of the genre Cuisinart " Remains of the Day  meets Die Hard " is how he has spun one potential follow-up to The Descent hardly begs for a $200 million budget or even a $50 million one, much as studio Bruckheimers will want to bribe him with such a bounty.
Or maybe Marshall's playfully assaultive slashers, less piercing than Saw , represent the new cutting edge; maybe The Descent  points to our downward mobility in a way that even conservative moguls can recognize as shrewd. After all, not even Superman hits the stratosphere these days; no less than George and Steven have been heard mulling a return to their "roots." (Can you picture Duel 's demonic semi pulling into Mel's Drive-In for a chocolate malt, "That'll Be the Day" spilling out of the speakerbox? Would that be before or after Indy 4 ?) Nearly every newspaper profile of the Newcastle-born Marshall has him gushing that his young life was saved by Raiders of the Lost Ark and indeed The Descent  does dig into the Spielbergian treasure trove, wherein the creepy-crawlies elicit as many smiles as screams. Still, what's most exciting about Marshall, 30 years after Jaws  and Star Wars  blockbusted the lowbrow, is his bid to return the B's to their rightful place belowground.
