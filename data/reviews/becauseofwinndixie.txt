During one sun-dappled summer a cute girl (newcomer Robb) and a cute dog (dubbed Winn-Dixie) cure one another's loneliness, and through their companionship bring together the fractured inhabitants of a small Florida town. Based on the Newberry Award-winning book by Kate DiCamillo, Because of Winn-Dixie
 seems an unusual choice for director Wang, who, despite his success with the family-oriented book-to-screen adaptation of The Joy Luck Club
 and the recent Jennifer Lopez starrer Maid in Manhattan
, generally tends toward adult fare. His new movie is truly family-friendly: It has a sincerity that should make it appealing to kids and their parents and also harkens back to the kind of old-fashioned movie that tells the heartfelt story of a kid and her dog. Robb plays 10-year-old Opal, who lives with her father (Daniels), whom she calls the Preacher, which is indeed his job. It's an occupation that requires them to move frequently, and because Opal's mother left them when she was 3 (something that is mysterious to Opal and about which her father is reluctant to talk) Opal is a loner in the tiny town of Naomi, Fl. After Opal and the homeless dog meet cute and go through some predictable �we can only keep him until we find him a good home� sequences, the story gradually heats up as Opal and Winn-Dixie begin to make some new friends. The musician Dave Matthews appears as the pet-store owner Otis, who can soothe the caged animals with his song. Veterans Eva Marie Saint and Cicely Tyson make welcome appearances respectively as the local librarian who spins a good yarn and the near-blind old woman who is thought to be a witch. Their work in the movie, along with Daniels' career-honed haplessness, make Robb's inexperience less noticeable while allowing us to focus on her lovely young face. There are no big surprises in Because of Winn-Dixie
, but neither is the admonition against working with children and animals appropriate here. Because of Winn-Dixie
 should provide a pleasant family outing free of any cinematic mange.


In one scene in "Because of Winn-Dixie," two young boys, all grass stains and whifflecuts, peer through the front door keyhole of a faded Southern mansion. One turns to the other and says with immeasurable disgust, "They're just sittin' in there talkin' about how they feel
." Then the two run off like frightened cats.
Children who are used to the rapid-fire sugar shock of Disney and Nickelodeon movies may feel the same way. No one gets slimed in "Winn-Dixie" -- except, occasionally, by life -- but this adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's 2000 young-adult novel has sturdier strengths than the latest digital-effects whiz-bang or pandering Hilary/Lindsay extravaganza. In pace, sensibility, and big, beating heart, this is a child's first indie film, and it's the better for it.
Ten-year-old Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) has moved with her dad, whom she calls Preacher (Jeff Daniels), to a flyspeck Florida hamlet called Naomi, where he has been hired to minister to the local Baptist congregation. The "church" is a converted storefront; father and daughter live rent-free at a local trailer park so the crotchety owner (B.J. Hopper) can get a tax deduction; the few kids Opal's age don't want anything to do with her. It's high summer and the girl's spirits couldn't be lower, especially since Preacher refuses to talk about her mother, who vanished when she was 3.
Girl needs a dog, clearly. And so, one afternoon when she runs down to the local Winn-Dixie supermarket, there is a rawboned mutt scampering through the produce section. Opal claims him, names him after the store -- this is serendipity, not product placement -- and brings him home to a slack-jawed father.
Oh, for pity's sake, haven't we been here before? Repeat after me: Winn-Dixie will bring Preacher around, he'll introduce Opal to all the lonely individuals of Naomi, and he'll teach her the value of friendship and connection before worrisome plot contrivances kick in during the final act. And he won't die because no one has killed off a dog since "Old Yeller."
All these things happen, true. But it's the way
 they happen that gives "Because of Winn-Dixie" its jerry-built charm and considerable emotional impact. Directed by Wayne Wang (a long way from his artful street-film beginnings with 1982's "Chan Is Missing"), the movie unfolds to the rhythms of summer in the deep South and finds humanity in everyone Opal meets. The prissy girl (Courtney Jines) has reasons for her meanness; those twin boys (Nick Price and Luke Benward) turn out to have gentlemanly streaks. A kid named Sweetie Pie (Elle Fanning, Dakota's sister) drifts through like the ghost of Truman Capote in the body of a 6-year-old girl. The genteel town librarian (Eva Marie Saint) tells Opal about her Civil War-era forebear, who invented a candy imbued with sadness -- and in a touch of magical realism, she produces a tin and gets everyone in the cast sampling and sighing.
By contrast, the local eccentric, Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson), puts her sins in old bottles, hangs them from a tree in her yard, and lets the wind carry them away. Tyson defeats a fright wig and a Moms Mabley accent to deliver a deft performance, and she becomes the surrogate grandmother to Opal and the town's other lost kids, even as Preacher is slowly filling in the blanks about his errant wife. The scene in which he grudgingly tells his daughter 10 Things About Her Mother is a tart object lesson in memorializing those who hurt us most.
The dog, obviously, gives the finest performance -- or dogs, since more than one was used. They're Picardy shepherds and they have rather more screen charisma than Dave Matthews, who plays a young ex-con named Otis who runs the pet store. Even here, though, the movie's subtlety works in its favor. The sequence in which Otis, a sort of St. Francis of Assisi with guitar chops, tells Opal his sad story and turns it into song as he strums, shouldn't work -- at all -- but its very tentativeness gives it weight.
Given his background as a mega-selling recording artist, it's fair to say Matthews gives a two-note performance, but he doesn't drag the movie down. The same can't be said for Harland Williams ("Dumb and Dumber"), whose slapstick buffoonery as the town cop seems imported from some dim "Home Alone" clone. But you understand why Wang put him in. "Because of Winn-Dixie" is so interior at times, so attuned to private sorrows, that you can sense the filmmakers desperately looking around for comic relief, even if it has no business there.
Judging from the steady stream of moms and small toddlers toward the exits at the screening I attended, "Winn-Dixie" isn't for the wee ones. Too much happens between the characters and not enough to
 them. Instead, this sweet, slow coming-of-age drama should hit the sweet spot for girls 8 to 12 (mine loved it), kids who read, dog lovers, and parents of all of the above. After the screening, I asked one mother of a 4-year-old whether the movie had gone over his head. "He was restless," she admitted, wiping a tear from her eye, "but I 
loved it." Take that, Disney.


         Sometimes a movie can be so faithful to the book it's based on as to squeeze the life out of it. Such is the case with "Because of Winn-Dixie," adapted from Kate DiCamillo's award-winning children's book. The novel, likened by critics to the writing of Carson McCullers and Harper Lee, is a sweet, melancholic ode to the Southern tradition of storytelling and the characters — real and apocryphal — to whom being a good listener can introduce you.
 
  The movie, which changes very little from the story about a lonesome young girl named Opal and the dog she finds at a supermarket who changes her life and the lives of those she meets, unfortunately flattens that world, leaving a dreary, uninspired tale in its place.
 


         






    Ten-year-old Opal has recently moved to Naomi, Fla., (population, 2,524) with her preacher father who has taken over a congregation that worships in a former convenience store. Opal has yet to make any friends and has increasingly begun to miss and wonder about her mother, who left seven years earlier. One day, the preacher sends her to the local Winn-Dixie grocery store, where she finds a stray dog, and she impetuously names him after the market.
 
  The dog, Winn-Dixie, is huge — able to place his paws on a grown man's shoulders and look him in the eye — and it has the uncanny ability to smile. Opal's veil of loneliness quickly lifts as Winn-Dixie drags her around Naomi, alternately getting into trouble and creating a series of situations in which they meet some of the town's loners and misfits.
 
  Young AnnaSophia Robb, making her film debut, is an agreeable enough presence as Opal but lacks the beguiling candor that makes the book so appealing. Too often she is tentative, when the character in the book would be assertive and persuasive.
 
  Screenwriter Joan Singleton and director Wayne Wang echo the episodic structure of the book, in which each new character regales Opal with his or her story. But whereas the book's Opal leaps off the page as a conduit for the reader, interpreting the stories along the way, here she is reduced to a passive listener. The result is a ragged sequence of vignettes that fail to form a convincing narrative.
 
  The supporting roles are well cast, with Jeff Daniels as the understanding if remote preacher; Cicely Tyson as Gloria Dump, a blind woman children believe to be a witch; Eva Marie Saint as Miss Franny, the spinster librarian who provides the sorrowful-tasting vintage Litmus Lozenges; and musician Dave Matthews as Otis, a painfully shy drifter with a gift for song.
 
  Although Wang captures the chipped-paint, rusted-out feel of Naomi in details such as the convenience-store-turned-church and with a strong, folk-infused soundtrack, "Because of Winn-Dixie" never quite works as a film. The failure to create appropriate cinematic metaphors reduces it to "happiness is a warm puppy" superficiality.

Millions who love the book on which Because of Winn-Dixie  is based already know that cause and effect begins with an orphaned dog named after a convenience store and adopted by a lonely girl. Kate DiCamillo's award-winning, kid-size 2000 novel is about sorrow, companionship, and spunk, with a kick of Southern comfort: The residents of fictional Naomi, Fla., where 10-year-old narrator India Opal Buloni has recently moved into a trailer park with her distracted preacher father, are colorful oddball types. Inevitably each also has something useful to teach the motherless newcomer about life. But to Winn-Dixie 's great credit, both as a book and as a dandy, dignified movie, there's nothing condescendingly lesson-like in the wisdom India acquires.
Nor is there anything goopy in director Wayne Wang's evocative production (from a screenplay by Joan Singleton)  and that's saying something, considering that the central heart-tuggers are a girl whose mama left when she was 3 and a doggy who smiles. It's the rare kid flick that attracts the participation of grandes dames  Eva Marie Saint (as the town's librarian) and Cicely Tyson (as Gloria Dump, the memorably named blind gardener), along with Jeff Daniels (as the preacher) and guitar-playing popular musician Dave Matthews in his feature acting debut (as a guitar-playing pet shop custodian). Yet as India, rookie actress AnnaSophia Robb holds her own with spirit  not to mention an unfakable chemistry with the fancy Picardy shepherd passing as a mutt in this well-bred charmer.

ere it not for a couple of cars, a little girl's pink poodle backpack and a reference to eBay, "Because of Winn-Dixie" could easily be mistaken for a film set in the 1950's. It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. Adapted from Kate DiCamillo's best-selling children's novel, this is the story of a girl, a dog, a single father and a circle of colorful supporting Southern characters. Opal Buloni (AnnaSophia Robb) is a very lonely 10-year-old since she and her father (Jeff Daniels), a preacher, have moved to Naomi, Fla., a town so small (or odd) that church services are held in a convenience store. So when Opal sees a scruffy dog loose in a Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, knocking down bumbling adults and scattering fruit everywhere in movie-clich� fashion, she claims the animal, names him for the place where they met and takes him home to the trailer park. Once Opal has Winn-Dixie at her side, she makes friends easily. They include the librarian (Eva Marie Saint), who tells a story about a bear stealing a copy of "War and Peace"; Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson), known as the Witch but really just a nice blind woman who lives alone; and Otis (Dave Matthews, as in the Dave Matthews Band), a gentle young man with a guitar who gives Opal a job at Gertrude's Pet Store. Opal feels so empowered that she begins pressing her emotionally shut-down father to tell her more about her mother, who ran away seven years ago. The dog that plays Winn-Dixie is cute enough, so it seems believable that normally sullen churchgoers might be won over when he disrupts services during the hymn "Just as I Am." Opal explains: "He just don't know the words, is all. But he sure is moved by the spirit." Ms. Robb, 11, is charming, and "Because of Winn-Dixie" is a harmless, pleasant comic drama, but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric on the page take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film. Naomi is the home, for instance, of the Litmus Lozenge Company, now defunct, which made candy in which sorrow was an actual ingredient. A taste leads Opal to observe "how the sweet and the sad were all mixed up together." In this movie, so are the magic realism and the corn. "Because of Winn-Dixie" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity, grown-up discussions about alcohol and the brief illusion of a dog eating a live mouse.

Uneven though it is, "Because of Winn-Dixie," based on Kate Di Camillo's novel, is tough to dislike. Yarn about a lonely girl, a homeless dog and their healing effect on a disjointed Florida community features a gifted, eclectic adult cast that helps overshadow its 10-year-old lead's inexperience. Generally pleasing where it could have been sickly sweet, pic will undoubtedly be marketed by Fox for its Feb. 18 opening as a contempo family classic, a movie to which kids can take their grandparents. While theatrical bonanza seems a long shot, film should enjoy a thriving ancillary life in DVD. 
Given "Winn-Dixie's" appeal to the under-13 and over-60 sets, helmer Wayne Wang seems an odd choice. Though Wang has previous experience with book-to-screen adaptations ("The Joy Luck Club"), his interests have never veered toward this sort of tyke-driven sentimentality. Wang has stated the characters in his movies share a common sense of longing -- a tenuous thread at best, but one that does permeate this film.
Left by her mother when she was a toddler for reasons unknown to her, Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) aches for a fulfilling home life, but her emotionally distant preacher dad (Jeff Daniels) is oblivious to her needs. When Opal discovers an abandoned mutt whom she names Winn-Dixie (after the local supermarket), the new friends embark on a summer of adventure as they discover others who share a similar need to connect.
Meandering through their small Southern community, Opal and Winn-Dixie begin to dismantle misconceptions: They befriend Miss Franny (Eva Marie Saint), a librarian who regales them with stories of her childhood; Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson), an eccentric recluse mistakenly thought to be a witch; and Otis (singer Dave Matthews), an oddball loner who manages the local pet shop and serenades the animals with his guitar.
Back at home, Opal's dad, advised by their landlord the dog must go, sets about finding it a new owner. But he's also pleased to see his daughter so happy, and as his crusty exterior starts to crack, he begins to unlock his cache of painful private memories.
Wang and scribe Joan Singleton cut back and forth to interweave the stories, leading to a celebration that unites the characters for the first time.
"Winn Dixie" is never quite as poignant as it means to be, except when it's not trying so hard, a flaw mostly traceable to Robb's lack of depth. In the obligatory "don't take my dog away" scene (Animal Control arrives to scoop up Winn-Dixie), the lovely, wide-eyed blonde doesn't genuinely convey the terror a girl would feel at watching such an event.
It's good to see vets Tyson and Saint on the bigscreen again. Singer Matthews imbues Otis with a natural, unaffected charm.
Kudos to the production team, including lenser Karl Walter Lindenlaub, who bathes the locations in a warm Southern light; production designer Donald Graham Burt, whose sets feel musty and real; and costume designer Hope Hanafin, whose outfits elucidate and embellish characters. Music by Rachel Portman provides narrative force and nuance, and thankfully avoids treacle. At 105 minutes, pic feels a bit weighty for younger audiences.

A nutso look into brotherly love blurring into boyband buggery, Harry and Max  plays like an episode of Behind the Music  as scripted by Dennis Cooper . Harry (Bryce Johnson ), a 23-year-old booze-swilling, fading teen idol, goes camping with his beloved younger sibling, tender high schooler Max (Cole Williams ), whose own burgeoning recording career has landed him an in-depth Q&A in Teeny Bopper  magazine. Johnson, who bears a passing resemblance to Jordan Knight  of New Kids on the Block , and Williams, who looks like the littlest Hanson brother, preen and pout like Tiger Beat  pinups. The boys speak of hurt feelings of the past and the trouble with Mom and Dad, making Suddenly, Last Summer -like references to a family vacation in Bermuda . Fraternal closeness morphs into Max orally pleasuring Harry. Mmmbop.
The rest of Harry and Max 's slim 74 minutes is a swirl of messy boundaries and loony dialogue. "We're not fucking. We're helping each other work things out," protests Harry to the charges of incest by his mortified ex-girlfriend Nikki (Rain Phoenix ), who's fresh from getting it on with Max. The family romance wears thin; the emotional lives of the leads are as vacuous as a Joey Fatone  B side. Director Christopher Munch  explored the homophilic leanings of pop stars far more successfully in his first film, The Hours and Times  (1991), a smart, graceful imagining of a sex-charged night between Brian Epstein  and John Lennon  in a Barcelona  hotel. That movie was made for adults; his latest offering is a taboo-busting pilot for the WB audience.
