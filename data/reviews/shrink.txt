Why is it that movies can never get the rhythms, the prickly  defensive and confessional dance, of a therapy session  at least, not the way The Sopranos  did? In Shrink , this sick-soul-of-Los- Angeles drama, Kevin Spacey plays a psychiatrist to the stars, but the character is such a wretch  an addict who's gone numb over his wife's suicide  that he just sits there, slack and glum, without the pretense that he's helping anyone. The movie is slack too. It wants to be Good Will Hunting  set in the land of Entourage , but its bummed-out touchy-feeliness is every bit  as concocted as its overly jaded showbiz corruption. C–


 Like smog settling over Los Angeles, a creeping sense of anomie haunts the Hollywood power players and parasites sidling nervously through “Shrink,” a portrait of a disenchanted therapist to the stars and his clientele. Directed by Jonas Pate from a screenplay by Thomas Moffett, based on a story by Henry Rearden, this dissection of a soul-sick community of self-medicating actors, writers and agents would like to think of itself as a contemporary “Play It as It Lays,” only kinder and gentler.  “Shrink” doesn’t peer into the abyss as fixedly as “Play It as It Lays,” the 1970 Joan Didion novel or its screen adaptation by the director Frank Perry (for which Ms. Didion wrote the screenplay with John Gregory Dunne). Nor does it have the ruthless satiric thrust of Robert Altman’s “Player,” or the pungent gallows humor of a Bruce Wagner novel.  But its central character, Dr. Henry Carter (Kevin Spacey), is afflicted with the same metaphysical malaise that engulfed Ms. Didion’s characters. A widower whose wife recently committed suicide for reasons left unspecified, Carter is a best-selling author of pop psychology books who has grown to believe that he can’t fix people and that his profession is useless. During a television interview (Gore Vidal conspicuously overacts the role of host) Carter has a meltdown and tears up the pages of one of his books.  No actor is better than Mr. Spacey at conveying a bone-deep cynicism, in his case usually accompanied by a malicious, needling wit. But Carter, pacified on marijuana, booze and cigarettes, doesn’t have the leftover energy to be nasty. One of the most revealing shots finds him passed out in the early-morning hours on a poolside lounger at his sleek home in the Hollywood Hills, empty bottles at his side. Only once in the movie, when his father (Robert Loggia) stages an intervention, does he snap out of his lethargy long enough to get on his high horse and angrily refuse treatment.  The doctor’s clients, many of whom are professionally interconnected, make up an unglamorous composite picture of players and hopefuls in the Southern California entertainment axis. The most vivid are Patrick (Dallas Roberts), a superagent and hypochondriacal worrywart suffering from extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder; and Jack (an uncredited Robin Williams), an alcoholic movie star who frets about his possible sexual addiction while refusing to acknowledge his drinking problem.  Mr. Roberts’s character gets off some nifty zingers; in one he sneers that he hasn’t seen a movie since “Titanic,” which had a “spoiler alert — the boat sinks.” Nostalgically recalling his premarital wild days, Mr. Williams’s character draws from an endless storehouse of amusingly raunchy euphemisms.  Other characters, none of whom is as sharply drawn, include Patrick’s perky, unmarried assistant, Daisy (Pell James), who is pregnant and dreams of being a producer; Shamus (Jack Huston), a self-loathing Irish movie star whose careless mixing of pharmaceuticals catches up with him; and Kate (Saffron Burrows), a beautiful actress with a cheating husband, coming to grips with the fact that she is no longer 27 in a youth-obsessed profession.  The one Hollywood outsider among Carter’s clients, Jemma (Keke Palmer), is a troubled African-American teenager and avid movie lover, recovering from a family tragedy, whom he treats pro bono. Jemma develops a conflicted friendship with another Carter client, Jeremy (Mark Webber), an unscrupulous, aspiring screenwriter.  These characters are mostly too sketchy and their connections too contrived for “Shrink” to jell as an incisive ensemble piece. But the atmospheric cinematography (by Lukas Ettlin) and hovering music (by Brian Reitzell and Ken Andrews) lend “Shrink” a queasy downbeat mood.  Mr. Spacey’s therapist, bearded, bleary-eyed and exuding dejection, is not someone you would recommend to a friend seeking help. If we really knew our therapists’ closely guarded personal stories, whom would we trust?    “Shrink” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has drug content, profanity and sexual references.

Kevin Spacey leads an impressive cast playing an asylum's worth of disturbed Hollywood types in "Shrink" by helmer Jonas Pate, who can only hope there are enough of those disturbed Hollywood types out there to see it. As pot-smoking psychiatrist-to-the-stars Henry Carter, Spacey is solid, sympathetic and has an ennui-ridden detachment to his affluent patients' problems. But the film may be too inside-baseball, with strained sympathy and contrived emotions -- even if Keke Palmer's performance as a high school-age film nut provides some welcome grounding in reality. Theatrical seems a no-brainer.
The cast of characters provided by Thomas Moffett's script is a tad predictable: an aging actress (Saffron Burrows) with a cheating, country-singer husband; an alcoholic film vet (an uncredited Robin Williams) who'd prefer to think himself a sex addict; a young writer (Mark Webber) whose big problem is having nothing to say; a superagent (Dallas Roberts) with more ticks than a cornfield; his beleaguered and pregnant assistant (Pell James); and Jemma (Palmer), a high school girl who finds a balm for her broken heart in matinee movies.
Henry is the intersection of all these people, including Jemma, who is assigned to him as a pro bono case, and ought to give Henry some perspective on his clients -- who include a sexy Irish actor with substance problems (Jack Huston). Without naming names, it seems Moffett is skating on the thin ice of libel with some of these characterizations, but he's also jamming 20 pounds of character into a 10-pound Gucci bag: Things happen too quickly, without sufficient development; bonds are made, broken and remade, without concern for emotional plausibility. As a result, the vacuous nature of some of the characters -- Patrick, notably, with his vile combination of neurosis and cruelty -- seem to have no point. Or none for anyone outside psychiatry or the film biz.
There must have been a carrot behind the stick that got all these folks together --perhaps Pate's agreeable nature. Actors are allowed to vent their inner ham to their heart's content. (Gore Vidal even shows up, as a TV host during a crucial scene, but you're too busy saying, "That's Gore Vidal," to pay attention.)
Production values are good, with standouts including d.p. Lukas Ettlin's use of light.

We know Kevin Spacey  is one depressed psychiatrist because he doesn't shave and he chain-smokes pot. (What Elliott Gould  did for cigarettes in The Long Goodbye , Spacey does for joints in Shrink .) Broadly about therapy, Jonas Pate 's film is also about the dark side of Hollywood, which he signifies by shooting the famed sign from behind—the other view of the high life! But, really, it's one of those multiple-connections movies: If I'd never been to L.A., I'd be convinced by now that all people do there is wander around, only bumping into each other by coincidence. As it is, Spacey's Henry Carter  self-medicates to get over the pain of his wife's suicide, while his various patients—actress Kate (Saffron Burrows ), agent Patrick (Dallas Roberts , excellent), and aging alcoholic actor Jack (an uncredited Robin Williams )—intersect and inch along to epiphany. Pate's eye isn't bad, but Thomas Moffett 's screenplay is self-serious piffle. The Hollywood meetings and negotiations are legitimately hilarious, but that target's easy enough. Finally, amid all the sadness, the movie does Magnolia , Crash , et al. one better. Inner peace doesn't come from the hard work of therapy—just get that screenplay deal signed! Hollywood movies don't get much more self-regarding than this.
