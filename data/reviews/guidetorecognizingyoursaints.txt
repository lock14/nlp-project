         Drawing loosely upon his own coming-of-age in Astoria, Queens, Dito Montiel with "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" traverses familiar territory with a fresh and intense perspective that wrests new meanings from the New York ethnic working-class neighborhood experience.
 
  Dito (Robert Downey Jr.), a successful writer living in Los Angeles, receives word from his mother, Florie (Dianne Wiest), via a childhood friend that he must come home to get his ailing but stubborn father, Monty (Chazz Palminteri), into a hospital. Dito has not been in Astoria for some 15 years and has apparently been out of touch with his parents all that time. A flood of memories takes him back to the fateful summer of 1986 when he was a high school student.
 


         






    Astoria has changed far less than other sections of New York, and the view of its rooftops from an elevated train is enticingly lyrical — a community of solid early 20th and late 19th century buildings constructed on a human scale and offering a sense of enduring security and stability. First-time feature director Montiel, son of a Nicaraguan father and an Irish mother, evokes a deep sense of community but ever so casually introduces an element of danger that threatens to undermine it, through increasing tensions between long-entrenched residents, largely Greek and Italian, and more recent arrivals, Puerto Rican and African American. Montiel, who also wrote the screenplay, approaches this dicey situation with a highly effective indirectness typical of the entire film.
 
  The "saints" of the film are Dito's friends, and on first impression they aren't very saintly or even very interesting. It's clear that the teenage Dito (Shia LaBeouf) is bright and probably talented, as is his new friend Mike O'Shea (Martin Compston), an Irish kid recently arrived from Scotland. They hang out with, among others, Antonio (Channing Tatum), a big muscular guy with an abusive father, a kid who seems headed for trouble. Dito has a girlfriend, Laurie (Melonie Diaz, of the ingratiating "Raising Victor Vargas") who seems more serious about him than he is about her.
 
  It is Montiel's special knack to make these young people, including his alter ego plus his parents, seem archetypal and therefore surprisingly powerful in their impact. Montiel doesn't ask the viewer to care for them as a conventional writer-director would but reveals the adult Dito discovering how important they all were to him because of their unshakable allegiance. Primarily these teens hang out, and the film spends lots of time in Dito's kitchen, where his loving father dispenses nonstop conventional wisdom as a devoted wife looks on. Yet for the young Dito his neighborhood isn't just getting rougher but also more stifling, as he and his pal Mike plot their escape to California.
 
  The central irony of the film is that adult Dito discovers how much he cares for those who by and large haven't much going for them, and in the instance of Dito's father, can even seem tiresome.
 
  There's a quality of daring in Montiel's approach, trusting that the intensity of his feeling for his characters can become contagious, and in the distinctive way he backs into his story and its scenes, moving from jagged, intimate moments to large-scale images that imbue the film with a sense of the beauty and magic of memories.
 
  The actors, who include Rosario Dawson as the adult Laurie, are all clearly caught up in their writer-director's vision — they couldn't be more committed than if they were acting in Eugene O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh." It's understandable that earlier this year at Sundance, Montiel would take the dramatic directing award and his cast a special jury prize for best ensemble performance. In "A Guide," passion and imagination go a long way in transforming seemingly conventional material and characters.   

The gods of cool appear to have kissed Dito Montiel's fingertips. First a street punk, then a downtown N.Y. hipster and musician, then a Sundance cat  now the first-time director has adapted A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints , his memoir about growing up in ungentrified 1980s Queens, into something kinda fictional, kinda loose, and made a damn interesting piece. He also got Robert Downey Jr. to star as the grown-up ''Dito Montiel'' and the lavishly talented Shia LaBeouf to play young Dito. This gallantly imperfect indie pops with attitude.

 “You’re not going anywhere.” That’s what young Dito Montiel (Shia LaBeouf) hears again and again from his father. Like many sensitive young men in rough circumstances, Dito, growing up fast in Astoria, Queens, in 1986, dreams of flight. He says he wants to go to California with his new friend, Mike (Martin Compston), but really it seems as if any place other than Astoria will do.  And even as he gets lost in the big brown eyes of his girlfriend, Laurie (Melonie Diaz), Dito still can’t wait to get away from home — from the noise and violence of the streets, and from the cramped chaos of the house where he lives with his irascible father, Monte (Chazz Palminteri), and his gentle, weary mother, Flaurie (Dianne Wiest).  Monte’s response to Dito’s desires is dismissive but also anxious. When he says, “You’re not going anywhere,” he really means, in part, “Please don’t leave me.”  The failure of communication between father and son is one of the painful elements in “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,” which arrives in theaters today after winning several awards at the Sundance festival earlier this year. We know that Dito will eventually   leave because the movie, in addition to chronicling the events leading up to his departure, also observes his return, nearly 20 years later. (When he comes back, Mr. LaBeouf has grown into Robert Downey Jr., and the casting of these two itchy, inventive actors in a single role is nothing short of revelatory. Ms. Diaz, for her part, is replaced by Rosario Dawson, who takes possession of the movie for the few minutes that she’s in it.) We also know that the real Dito Montiel grew up to be the author of a memoir and the director of this film.  Though autobiographical, “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints” is also a coming-of-age story set against a tough urban background, in which the protagonist’s emerging sense of his own individuality cuts against his loyalty to friends and kin. What sets the film apart, and makes it one of the more remarkable American directing debuts in recent years, is Mr. Montiel’s passionate, almost reckless engagement with the possibilities of the medium. Adapting his impressionistic, often rambling memoir for the screen, he demonstrates an autodidact’s exuberant self-confidence and the eye of a born filmmaker. Working with a large, mostly young cast, he has made a picture so full of life and feeling that the screen can hardly contain it.  There is certainly a lot of screaming and yelling and fighting. Monte has a temper, but he is less a domestic martinet than an anxious, timid man hoping, against evidence and reason, that things will work out.    “Those kids are all right, they’re all right,” he says to Flaurie, speaking of Dito and his friends and trying to reassure himself. But Dito’s pals, whom Flaurie likens to “a pack of wolves,” are not all right. A simmering, racially-tinged feud with a gang from another neighborhood threatens to explode into serious violence.  The boisterous, antisocial behavior of the young men Dito hangs around with walks a fine line between annoying and menacing. Antonio (Channing Tatum), the alpha dog in this crew, is regularly beaten up by his father and compensates for the hurt and humiliation with bluster and brutality. Mr. Tatum, who has the bullish physicality of a young Brando, is an electrifying actor, and I suspect we’ll be seeing a lot more of him after this breakout performance.  Busy as the film is, it also pauses for reflective, intimate moments in which the camera’s movements and the texture of the sound design mirror the wide-eyed, confused state of Dito’s youthful consciousness. Mr. LaBeouf has a watchful, excited demeanor, and his character, miserable as he sometimes is, is also curious and adventurous, savoring the funny, strange and beautiful things the world throws in front of him. He and Mike ride the subway to Manhattan, where they work for a flamboyant and somewhat unstable dog walker (Anthony De Sando).  The closing credits roll over the sounds of Kiss performing “New York Groove,” and that silly, glammy Kiss anthem has never sounded more apt. Mr. Montiel’s nostalgia for the New York of his younger days is unabashed, but it is also unclouded by illusions and tempered by a ragged kind of wisdom.  Terrible things happen in “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.” Mr. Downey warns at the beginning that some of the people we meet in the movie will die before it’s over, and the nostrum that time heals all wounds is shown to be a lie. But though the picture is wrenching, at times devastating, it leaves you with that buoyant feeling of having encountered a raw, authentic work of art. All those howls of pain are its way of telling you that it is madly, defiantly, uncontrollably alive.  “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian); there is violence, obscene language and nudity.

Dito Montiel writes what he knows in his autobiographical and unkempt debut feature, "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints." Homing in on the sections in his 2003 memoir about his experiences growing up on the violent streets of Queens' Astoria neighborhood, writer-director Montiel creates a movie of many parts that don't always congeal. Mix this with the many meaty scenes and a roster of often exceptional actors and the effect is one of a fabulous acting showcase more than a wholly finished work. Specialty distribs will be clamoring for the rights, but wider sales abroad are far riskier.
Actor Richard E. Grant's recent feature debut "Wah-Wah," is a more realized work of film autobiography than "Guide." But Montiel unmistakably writes from the heart, and allows his cast -- most notably in the cases of Dianne Wiest, Chazz Palminteri, Martin Compston and newcomer Channing Tatum -- considerable freedom to create roles that they own on screen.
Pic is rarely better than opening shot of a silently anguished Wiest as Dito's mom Flori struggling to make a phone call asking her son to visit ailing dad Monty (Palminteri); a lifetime of pain registers on Wiest's face. In present day, Dito (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful author of the book of the pic's title, and reads certain passages in voice-over that serve to bridge scenes.
Older Dito's return home, after many years away, wraps around and through the main story set in the hot and muggy summer of 1986, when Dito (Shia LaBeouf) and his pals Antonio (Tatum), Giuseppe (Adam Scarimbolo) and Nerf (Peter Tambakis) kick around the Astoria streets. Monty respects Antonio as the oldest and toughest of the bunch, but unconditionally loves Dito, who displays both rowdy and softer sides, particularly around his savvy g.f. Laurie (Melonie Diaz). Graffiti attacks by local punks dubbed "The Reapers" trigger tit-for-tat hostilities that brings out Antonio's vengeful side, with Dito caught in the middle. 
Dito is still years away from developing his writing voice. But along with Laurie, newly arrived Scottish kid Mike (Compston) offers Dito a counterpoint to the brutalized world of Antonio; Mike writes poetry, and inspires Dito to consider forming a band with him. Dito is gradually forced to make life-changing choices.
The present-past interplay works effectively in the early passages, but as the 1986 story begins to dominate, Dito's homecoming doesn't so much buttress the tale as intrude upon it. Montiel and editor team Christopher Tellefsen and Jake Pushinsky labor with mixed results to make the time periods flow into each other, but it isn't until Dito's emotional clash with his bitter father, and then a heartbreaking time-out with his mother that a fuller sense of Dito's personal journey is realized. 
In lesser actors' hands, several scenes would stop cold. Yet Tatum creates a powerful study of a self-destructive street guy trapped with no good options (with Eric Roberts in a virtual cameo as his older self). Wiest and Palminteri enliven standard domestic scenes -- with Palminteri delivering his best perf in some time. Compston, a bit more grown-up since Ken Loach's "Sweet Sixteen," makes Mike's so fascinating that Dito would credibly be drawn to him. Diaz's intelligence turns potentially trite scenes involving Laurie into stories within the story. 
If there's a casting hiccup, it's LaBeouf in effect playing a young Robert Downey Jr. Appearing more baby faced than streetwise, LaBeouf seems wrong for the role. Downey, in a morose key, beautifully expresses his author's trepidations and concerns about returning home.
Location work in Queens is smashing, and Eric Gautier's lensing is typically world class. Jonathan Elias' moody synth-guitar score ultimately sounds like too many other dreamy minimalist soundtracks, and seems out of place for the ethnic-urban setting.

They say youse  can never go home again. Nevertheless, Queens -bred big-timer Dito Montiel  revisits his old Astoria stomping grounds in A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints , a Sundance-sanctioned indie loosely based on the thirtysomething writer-director and occasional fashion model's neo-Beat semiautobiography of the same name. Montiel may be a singular talentmaker of one of the more arresting New York neighborhood penny-pinchers since Mean Streets but this is a tale of at least two Ditos. The real Montielthe one of press-release legend, anywaygot 15 minutes with Warhol before the Factory closed, primped for Versace, and started a punk band, Gutterboy, that signed to Geffen. As if eyeing a movie deal, the Dito  of Montiel's 2003 memoir drops purple mescaline, patronizes a Times Square  brothel, and contrary to the moral of Mean Streets , makes up for his sins in the church.
Called by Ma (Dianne Wiest ) to come home and see the old man (Chazz Palminteri ) before he croaks, Robert Downey Jr. 's weathered hipster scribe takes a break from his spotlit L.A. reading engagements and, sporting the kind of designer blazer that remains rare even in gentrifying Queens, slowly climbs the crooked stairs to Apartment 2B. At least half of Montiel's movie comprises extended flashbacks to the moist summer of '86, when teen Dito (Shia LaBeouf ) came of age by carousing with his crew of fellow pubescent hotheadsi.e., ogling girls in tank tops and jean shorts when not engaging in violent ante-upping with "the Puerto Ricans." If this tit-for-tat sounds a lot like Saturday Night Fever  (and I didn't mention the half-accidental-death-by-public-transit scene), the borrowing isn't necessarily Montiel's alone: Sampling the greatest hits of Tony Manero 's fuck- and fight-fueled white-boy-on-the-rise routine has hardly been unique to budding artists in the outer boroughs for the past 30 years. Still, Dito is a special case: He dreams of hopping the $39 bus to California with Mike (Martin Compston ), a recent arrival from Scotland  who writes poetry.
Right from the jump it's clear that, like Travolta's high-stepping bridge-crosser, this downtown-bound Queens kid is going to leave everyone: Montiel dutifully includes a shot of young Dito breaking the fourth wall to declare, "I'm going to leave everyone." (Dito's less fortunate crush Laurie, tenderly played by Raising Victor Vargas 's Melonie Diaz , looks at the camera and says, "Everyone will leave me.") Whatever the first-time filmmaker lacks in subtlety and finessenot even the snow-white Sundance Screenwriters Lab  could bleach Montiel's script of its corner-deli grithe recoups by other, more playfully attitudinal means. Beat for beat, the dialogue rivals classic rock for being familiarly catchy, skimping not at all on the bada-bing  and yo yo yo  en route to the relative gravitas of Downey's "Daddy, did you love me or not?" Palminteri's Pops ain't exactly a talker, as Ma admits, but even this typewriter repairman has his riffs: "Hey, you know me, rock o' Gibraltar , right?"
Classic rock it is: Despite the mid-'80s setting, DJ Dito favors choice cuts from the decade prioreven shit like Welcome Back Kotter  , which positively kills in this stayin' alive context. Gerry Rafferty 's "Baker Street"cued by Frank (Anthony DeSando ), a coked-out, queer dog-walker who might've graced the real Dito's 'hood but wouldn't be here without Boogie Nights builds indelibly to the cheesy guitar solo, whereupon Montiel cuts to the startlingly commonplace and flat-out perfect image of cherry-red squad-car lights reflecting off the flimsy siding of a shack. Cinematographer Eric Gautier ( Clean ) plainly digs Montiel's preference for poeticism over vérité; indeed, he might have taken the job just to show that wood paneling under soft white bulbs emits an orange glow, that the Manhattan skyline beckons like Oz when seen through the rain-spattered window of an elevated train in Queens. Montiel, whose book includes photos by no less than Bruce Weber  and Allen Ginsberg , may have declined to dramatize his own fabled tutelage under Drella. But, blessed enough to have drawn Gautier and Downey away from better-paying gigs, the kid hasn't likely failed to recognize his saints.
