Imagine if Napoleon Dynamite were to pretend to be Ben Stiller, slap on a patently false mustache and daredevil costume, and then imagine himself to be a professional stuntman. That will give you some idea of the impression cast by Samberg as Hot Rod
's Rod Kimble, a self-styled Evel Knievel. The film even opens with (and often returns to) the same kind of inept stunt jump that helped endear the hopelessly optimistic character of Napoleon to so many viewers. Despite his boyish looks, Samberg seems a bit old to be playing such a rube, and one might legitimately question whether something has gone awry in his family gene pool, but then we meet his family and friends and discover that none of them is swimming particularly close to the deep end. Hot Rod
 is a stupid movie about stupid people doing stupid things � and, by golly, that seems to be the way we like our comedies these days. Hot Rod
, however, also carries the whiff of the SNL
 feature-film imprimatur, a distinction that doesn't necessarily come with bragging rights. Unlike most SNL
 film spin-offs though, Hot Rod
 is not based on characters popularized on the weekly sketch show. Instead, the film belongs more to the Will Ferrell school of SNL
-alum film comedies: Invent a ridiculous character, and hope that fun and froth follow. Hot Rod
, with a script by South Park
 vet Pam Brady, is mostly the invention of Lonely Island � the trio of actors Samberg and Taccone and director Schaffer (whose videos include the broadcast and viral sensations, "Lazy Sunday" and "Dick in a Box," among others). Spacek (clearly hoping the film will do for her career what Waterboy
 did for Kathy Bates') shows up to play Kimble's mom, while McShane seems to have fun playing the stepdad. Fisher continues her near-flawless record as a  delightful comedy presence. Yet no one seems to have told the Lonely Island boys that the stakes are a little higher in features than they are in music videos and that underlighted shots and sloppy editing are more distracting on the big screen than on television. Hot Rod
 ought to appeal to fans of this kind of comedy, but if it turns out that more than $47 was spent to make it, it's possible that a crime has been committed.


"Hot Rod" delivers Andy Samberg from "Saturday Night Live" to the movies. The occasion is a piece of nonsense about Rod Kimble (Samberg), the adult son of a dead stuntman, who attempts to jump a fleet of buses to raise $50,000 for his emasculating stepfather's heart operation. Rod hates the stepfather (Ian McShane) but desperately wants him healthy so he can finally win one of their regularly scheduled cellar brawls. It will, at last, make him feel like a man.
If the movie weren't so playfully dumb -- did you ever think you'd see Ian McShane throw Andy Samberg through a basement shelving unit? -- this would be exasperating. Doesn't Rod know he's already a man? He should just click his Chucks together.
But manhood is not the entire point of "Hot Rod." The movie is up to its neck in mid-1980s cheesiness: The melodramatic synthesizers of Giorgio Moroder and the feathery wail of the Swedish rock outfit Europe are disinterred to happy ends. The filmmakers, though, have skipped right past the kitsch of tribute and gone straight for jokey delusion: They really seem to think it's 1986. And in that sense, "Hot Rod" is post-parody, taking nothing seriously, not even being a movie.
Pam Brady wrote the script, but I don't think anybody used it. The cast includes Sissy Spacek as Rod's mother, Isla Fisher as his girlfriend, Bill Hader and Danny R. McBride as his belligerent buddies, and the priceless Chris Parnell as a clueless, velvet-voiced AM radio manager. They all seem to be making their stuff up as they go.
Only when Rod's half-brother, Kevin (Jorma Taccone), shows Rod a promotion he made on his computer for the big jump does the movie classify its collection of loosely related bits and tableaux. "Hot Rod" is Hollywood's first real YouTube movie: a bunch of moments clothes-pinned to a line of plot.
It's amusing every five or so minutes; and some sequences, like a surreal musical number that abruptly erupts into a street riot, warrant being forwarded to friends. This is great news for those of us who like the beginning of a film to reach the end in under five minutes. It's not so good for people who like to get lost in a movie.
Samberg, Taccone, and "Hot Rod" director Akiva Schaffer are part of a short-filmmaking comedy trio called the Lonely Island, and Taccone and Schaffer also write for "SNL." Samberg starred in two of their heavily forwarded clips. The funnier and more popular of them, a song that first appeared last year on "SNL," deserves a spot on the Mount Rushmore of viral video. It has an unprintable title and, in the style of certain ludicrously explicit R&B songs from the early 1990s, offered instructions for how to gift-wrap your penis for the woman in your life.
Nothing in this movie approaches the lewd genius of that video. But it's doubtful that anything will. It was, alas, a moment. The question with "Hot Rod" is: Can Andy Samberg give us more? He seems to be the sort of entertainer whose career will specialize in nothing but such moments.
As a director, Schaffer has a cool, punchy style, but his full-length movie dead-ends. The flavor runs out. He may lack the focus to sustain a feature film, but he knows his way around short, poppy nuggets. This isn't such a terrible limitation. Were somebody from the French New Wave raised on nothing but TV commercials, sketch comedy, and music videos, the movie he'd make would go something like this.


         The new stuntman comedy "Hot Rod" should come with a warning: Anyone above the age of 42 is not going to get it. Chock-full of references to bad teen movies from the '80s and saturated with sarcasm, "Hot Rod" is a cheekily fun sendup of Gen X iconography.
 
 "Napoleon Dynamite" fans are sure to like Rod Kimble, the moronic and talentless Evel Knievel-wannabe played by "Saturday Night Live" regular Andy Samberg. Sporting a fake mustache, coveralls and cape as he attempts, and fails, to launch his moped over a milk truck, then a swimming pool and, finally, a stretch of 15 school buses, Kimble is on a mission to show his worth to a disapproving stepfather and also to get the girl.
 


         






   That girl is Denise, played by Isla Fisher. Unfortunately, Fisher isn't allowed to demonstrate the comedic chops she so handily displayed as the redheaded bombshell in "Wedding Crashers." She's merely eye candy in what is clearly a star vehicle for Samberg, who plays the part of an affable, if emotionally unevolved, loser with a sort of buff but nerdy sex appeal.
 
 A lot of the comedy in "Hot Rod" will be meaningless, campy fun for teen viewers but in-jokes for Xers, who'll test their powers of recall and cringe with recognition when they hear songs and watch scene reenactments from "The Karate Kid," "Flashdance" and "Footloose," the most notable being an outrageously drawn-out sequence that has Kimble back-lighted  and dancing wildly in a forest, then pommel horsing on a log, then falling -- endlessly -- down a wooded slope.
 
 Much of the humor in "Hot Rod" consists of "Jackass"-caliber gags that often  result in bodily injury. At least the gags hang together as a viable plot. When Kimble vomits on Denise after nearly drowning in a kiddie pool, then plummets into an RV at the tail end of a street luge run, then flies through the air after a hit from a friend's van, it all has a purpose. It's training for the big jump, which Kimble is "too legit to quit," he tells Denise, complete with M.C. Hammer hand signs.
 
 Executive produced by "SNL" star Will Ferrell and directed by Samberg's  childhood pal and "SNL" writer Akiva Schaffer, "Hot Rod" was written by Pam Brady, an Emmy-nominated writer-producer for the animated comedy series "South Park." Together, they've managed to stitch together a funny and irreverent movie that's likely to create the same sort of adoring, if temporary, fan base as the movies it spoofs. My guess is it won't be long before the red Team Rod T-shirts that Kimble's team wears in the film begin showing up in low-rent trinket shops, à la Vote for Pedro.
 
 
 "Hot Rod." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude humor, language, some comic drug-related and violent content. Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes. In general release.   

Hot Rod 's highlight features the hero  a moped-riding Evel Knievel wannabe (Andy Samberg)  doing a dance in a forest that looks like '70s-spastic Steve Martin reinterpreting Footloose . There are a few other minor laugh sequences in this puttering vehicle for the affable SNL  viral-video star Samberg of ''Lazy Sunday'' fame, but most of them (like a long goof on the phrase ''Cool beans!'') don't really flow into the otherwise conventional frame of the movie. Wait until the best parts pop up on YouTube.

 “Hot Rod” might be called the poor man’s “Eagle vs. Shark” if “Eagle vs. Shark” were not already the poor man’s “Napoleon Dynamite.” It certainly lacks the conceptual purity and aesthetic integrity of the “Jackass” movies. In any case poor certainly describes the quality of the filmmaking. Directed by Akiva Schaffer from an improvisation-enhanced script by Pam Brady, “Hot Rod” is unapologetically, almost proudly crummy looking, as though paying tribute with its sloppy framing and clumsy editing to the goofy, half-baked quality of its hero’s stunts.  “Hot Rod” is primarily a vehicle meant to propel Andy Samberg from “Saturday Night Live” and YouTube celebrity into the stratosphere of comic-movie stardom. As such it is a bit like the rickety moped that Mr. Samberg’s character, Rod Kimble, uses for his not-quite-death-defying stunts. In one of these he tries to leap a municipal swimming pool and lands in the water.  Similarly “Hot Rod” sets itself modest, pointless goals and then falls short of them. Mr. Samberg is as much a movie star as Rod is a daredevil stunt man, and “Hot Rod” is less of a movie than Mr. Samberg’s “SNL” digital shorts, which are a lot of fun on the laptop.  Mr. Samberg’s wide smile and eager manner are engaging, but he labors under the misapprehension that he is automatically, innately funny. There is a difference between finding humor in laziness and self-delusion and lazily deluding yourself that anything you do will bring big laughs. The laughs to be found in “Hot Rod” are small and easy. Mr. Samberg falls down, or collides with a blunt object (a washing machine suspended from a tree by a rope, for instance), or utters lame, self-conscious catchphrases.  Rod is the latest version of what is fast becoming a cliché: the guy who thinks he’s cool but is actually, objectively a loser. You are meant to laugh knowingly at the discrepancy between his self-image and the reality he cluelessly inhabits, and then, to excuse the cruelty latent in this laughter, to sympathize with the sincerity and nobility of his dreams and root for their fulfillment. Rod, who lives with his mother (Sissy Spacek, if you can believe it) and stepfather, Frank (Ian McShane), dreams of living up to the legend of his deceased father and also of winning Frank’s respect.  Styling himself after Evel Knievel — since no movie of this kind can survive without a wink at the endlessly parodied pop culture of the 1970s — Rod is assisted by a crew of nerds and misfits, including his half-brother Kevin (played Mr. Samberg’s longtime pal and sometime creative partner Jorma Taccone). Rod also has a crush on his next-door neighbor, Denise (Isla Fisher), who has a jerky rich boyfriend (Will Arnett) and an endlessly sweet disposition. Ms. Fisher, an actress who showed herself to be a nimble comic performer in “Wedding Crashers,” is not allowed to be funny in this infantile comic universe. Funny is apparently a guy thing.  “Hot Rod” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some drug and sexual references.

It worked for Will Ferrell in "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights": Devise a cocktail-napkin sketch of a character and hope the movie falls in place around it. But by the time "Hot Rod" reached the screen, Ferrell had stepped aside, leaving "Saturday Night Live's" Andy Samberg to play amateur stuntman and accident magnet Rod Kimble. Those hoping for feature-length doses of Samberg's "Lazy Sunday" wit will have to settle for just plain lazy, as "Hot Rod" aims low and still manages to miss its target. Even if pic crashes and burns at the box office, it should emerge unscathed on DVD.
In one of "Napoleon Dynamite's" more memorable gags, Jon Heder set up a sweet bicycle jump, only to nosedive on liftoff. "Hot Rod" repeats the same joke ad nauseum as Samberg's unflappable Rod Kimble barrels headfirst into one daredevil stunt after another, eating pavement every time. Nothing seems to break his spirits -- except for the obligatory second-act self doubts, which are solved hastily enough for Rod to make good on his plan to jump 15 school buses in a single bound.
With precious little in the way of plot, "Hot Rod" relies on a combination of Samberg's winning screen presence and the sheer stupidity of its premise: Rod needs to raise $50,000 to pay for his stepfather's heart transplant, and the only way to save the miserable old guy's life is by defying death itself.
Although Samberg hasn't quite developed a style of his own, the up-and-coming comic boasts something unusual for an "SNL" regular: sex appeal. Between his sideways grin and hipster appeal, it's easy to see why Paramount would want to sign the actor before he hit it big, even if the best script they had to offer was this half-baked suburban stuntman comedy.
Samberg makes the move to features with cohorts Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone; trio got their start as Web-based comedy troupe the Lonely Island. Schaffer directs, while Taccone co-stars as Rod's half-brother Kevin. They're funny guys, but longform is a stretch. "Hot Rod" is most amusing when it veers into pure absurdity -- don't be surprised to see a sequence like the movie's "Cool Beans" rap find a viral afterlife on YouTube.
Kevin's "Stuntman Forever" short, an outtakes reel featured as a movie-within-the-movie, has already made its way online. But scripted wipeouts aren't nearly as satisfying as the real thing, which explains why "Hot Rod" feels old-fashioned next to the outrageous, unpredictable spontaneity of "Borat" or "Jackass."
If anyone could warn Rod his stunts won't go as planned ("They're all going to laugh at you!"), it would be Sissy Spacek, who plays Rod's mom, in little more than a paycheck part. Isla Fisher is equally underused as Rod's love interest, stuck playing the straight girl to boorish boyfriend Will Arnett -- a shame, considering the obvious comic talent she showed in "Wedding Crashers."
"Deadwood's" Ian McShane fares better as Rod's abusive stepfather, and the entire movie builds not to the bus-jumping gimmick (shown in closeups and reaction shots, not an actual leap), but rather a final knock-down, drag-out fight between Samberg and McShane (which actually features the movie's best stuntwork). Stunt junkies will also appreciate a "punch dancing" sequence in the woods, a clever riff on training montages featured in countless sports movies, which ends with Rod taking an extremely bumpy tumble down a very long hill.
"Hot Rod" exists in the moment, offering plenty of laughs in passing while paying minimal attention to character. It is yet another example of a comedy that refuses to be taken seriously -- concept as clothesline for all manner of silliness.
End credits and final soundtrack were missing from the print screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, in advance of Par's Aug. 3 rollout.

The Saturday Night Live   comedy trio of Andy Samberg , Jorma Taccone , and Akiva Schaffercollectively known as the Lonely Island shot to the heights of YouTube celebrity with their parody music videos (including the immortal "Lazy Sunday," a.k.a. "The Chronic of Narnia "). Unfortunately, their aggressively silly debut feature film, which stars Samberg as an amateur motorcycle stuntman who dreams of Evil Knievel style glory, more immediately recalls a different sort of viral videothe ones where anomic suburban teens film themselves engaging in backyard wrestling throwdowns and other sub- Jackass antics. It's not that Hot Rod , which Schaffer directed from a script (by Pam Brady ) originally conceived as a Will Ferrell  vehicle, doesn't have its moments: I dug the Flashdance -style training montages in which Samberg readies himself for a death-defying 15-bus leap, and I found it hard to resist the movie's '80s nostalgia (running the gamut from the long-forgotten Paul Rodriguez  comedy The Whoopee Boys to the musical stylings of Europe). But like so many movies from the SNL  factory, there are perhaps 10 to 15 minutes of good, gag-worthy material here stretched out to interminable lengths. Or to put it another way: It's a very small dick in an oversized box.
