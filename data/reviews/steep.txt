 One of the daredevils in “Steep,” a documentary about extreme skiing, insists he is not hooked on the adrenaline rush of this death-defying sport. His denial is hard to believe.  In one scene after another of this movie, written and directed by Mark Obenhaus, skiers hurtle down slopes at angles of 55 degrees or greater and leap off precipices into the unknown. The tiniest miscalculation, we are repeatedly told, could result in death.  The sport’s practitioners — addicts might be a better word — would rather talk about how extreme skiing puts them totally in the moment and gives them an appreciation of life so acute it makes this sport, which has a high fatality rate, worth pursuing at all costs. There is a lot of mystical mumbo jumbo about how mountains are living, breathing things whose moods must be gauged before you venture onto their slopes; on a bad day a grouchy mountain can bite back.  Behind it all is the same competitive spirit that disciples of religious cults dish out to the uninitiated. The proselytizer fervently believes that he or she (but usually he) has a richer life than his unenlightened audience. That may be why “Steep” so often sounds like a promotional film.  The movie, photographed in high-definition video by Erich Roland, is an undeniably impressive visual spectacle that follows the sport from Wyoming to France, British Columbia, Iceland and Alaska. Like that of its sister sport, surfing, extreme skiing has a history of one feat topping another as techniques are developed and challenges devised.  The worldwide search for the highest wave is paralleled by the search for the steepest, wildest, most dangerous slopes and for perfect snow. Perfection is to be found, according to the movie, in the extreme-skiing mecca of Valdez, Alaska, where the white stuff has the texture of velvet.  “Steep” arbitrarily begins its history with a lone descent of Bill Briggs in 1971 on Grand Teton mountain in Wyoming. His accomplishment, witnessed by no one but attested to by aerial photographs of his ski tracks, was all the more remarkable because he was born without a hip joint, and multiple surgeries had left him with a limp.  Since then a widening search for adventure has sparked the popularity of what is called big mountain skiing, two of whose hubs, visited by the movie, are Chamonix, in the French Alps, and Valdez. The sport’s popularity has been spread by video, with Greg Stump’s 1988 film, “The Blizzard of Aahhh’s,” cited as a seminal work.  We meet the sport’s macho clown, Glen Plake, a wild man with a two-foot high Mohawk, and its composed, apparently fearless female virtuoso, Ingrid Backstrom. Pushing the limits of extreme skiing is Shane McConkey, who has pioneered ski basing: skiing off a cliff at full speed carrying a parachute.  The most consistent presence in the film is Doug Coombs, who in 1991 won the first World Extreme Ski Championship in Valdez. With his wife, Emily, he founded Valdez Heli-Ski Guides, which made the Chugach Range in Alaska a magnet for skiers, who are dropped off by helicopter on mountain peaks from which they descend at lightning speeds.  In the film Mr. Coombs, who died while skiing with friends on April 3, 2006, reflects on the risks of his sport and sounds resigned to his luck eventually running out. To the detached observer the line between this cheerful fatalism and flirting with suicide seems imperceptible.

Like its sister films in the surfing-movie genre, the extreme-skiing movie �Steep� is less a documentary than a sales pitch -- not for a product or a place, but for a sport, one its practitioners feel requires pugnacious self-promotion. Spectacular alpine landscapes, suicidal descents on 70-degree mountainsides and skiers with an inflated sense of self (and no sense of self-preservation) will make for a cultish theatrical release and -- given that the doc already seems cut for commercial interruptions -- a reasonable life on TV and DVD. 
Given the risks involved (extreme skiers purposefully choose the most dangerous, inaccessible, sharply pitched and unstable surfaces in the world), �Steep� is willfully blind to the questions it inevitably raises, such as: Why? Why do these men -- and except for the heartstopping Ingrid Backstrom, the film is a virtually all-male endeavor -- do what they do? There�s a lot of blather about the mountain making them come alive, but considering how many people die on the slopes, the viewer really wants a little less of the gnarly dudes and something closer to a professional diagnosis.
To the strains of Anton Sanko�s often oppressive faux-metal soundtrack, �Steep� doesn�t really advertise skiing so much as skiing films (even though ski-film godfather Warren Miller isn�t mentioned). Very little of what goes on in the sport isn�t recorded and made commercially available, so in a way, pic reps a kind of porn -- in which people engage in senseless, life-threatening and therefore obscene acts of titillation for viewers who will be watching it from the less-than-alpine altitude of their couches. 
Marking the birth of extreme skiing from Bill Briggs� seemingly impossible descent of the Grand Tetons in 1971, the film touches on a number of sports luminaries, some crazier than others, much like the stunts: The scariest jump in the movie doesn�t even take place in snow, but rather over a river, as Shane McConkey -- who combines skiing and parachuting -- leaps off a bridge and plummets for what seems like a mile before opening his chute and gently gliding toward earth. 
 �Steep� has its moments. Some are exhilarating, others seemingly insane. But the movie also feels like a sermon. The featured skiers protest too much about the value of what they do, sounding as if they�re defending and ultimately trying to ennoble it. But they�re not curing cancer; they�re sliding down hills on two sticks. It should be fun. So should �Steep.� 
Production values are phenomenal. 


The three deepest profundities plowed by Mark Obenhaus 's blandly beautiful, inarticulate extreme-skiing doc are: (1) Alaskan snow feels unusually velvety, (2) "You're not a big mountain skier unless you've skied Chamonix ," and (3) "Mountains always have the last say." That final quote, from the wife of pioneering ski mountaineer Doug Coombswho died while trying to save a friend on a slope, mere days after completing his last interviewcarries an existential weight that the film never attempts to lift. For what justifiable purpose do these passionate boundary-pushers risk their lives, beyond recreation and a possible career as a hi-def ESPN2  porn star? Is the lifestyle of an adrenaline junkie any less self-destructive than a drug addict's? And how does Ingrid Backstrom , a female rarity to the sport, feel about being likened to "a guy with a ponytail"? Such explorations might've boosted interest in this niche film, which ekes out much of its feature length with nostalgia for the Frenchmen who popularized "Le Ski Extreme" in the '70s and mohawked superstar Glen Plake 's breakthrough 1988 ski video The Blizzard of AAHHH's . An avalanche-in-progress aside, there's no hook for the audience, who would probably have more fun getting drunk in the lodge.
