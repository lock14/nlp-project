Climates  begins in the summer warmth of western Turkey and ends in the wintry snow of the east  the shift is as metaphorical as it is meteorological in  Nuri Bilge Ceylan's exquisitely structured, pitiless study of a middle-aged man trapped in a stagnant emotional weather pattern. In his rejection of his younger girlfriend (Ebru Ceylan, the filmmaker's wife), Isa (Ceylan himself) is a close cousin of the dour loners in the director's previous film, Distant . But a rough sex scene between Isa and a sometime lover, shot in one long take and featuring a stray hazelnut, hints at a sense of humor about relationships as nutty as it is deadpan.

 Some killers do their work in a frenzy of violence. Others wield the knife quietly: they carve out your heart without spilling a drop of blood. In “Climates,” a man and woman break up with hot tears and lacerating words; there isn’t a knife in sight and their hands look immaculate.  There are early signs of trouble between them, but it isn’t until one night, when their anger escapes like poison gas, polluting the air and making them reckless, that the violence of their feeling emerges. In his voice you hear an old, familiar impatience: he talks to her as if she were a child. And when she laughs at him, you hear the bitterness.  “Climates” is the story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other’s love. It was written and directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a Turkish filmmaker who, with four features, has become an internationally recognized name. (His third feature, “Distant,” won the grand, or second-highest, prize at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival and had  a limited release in America.) His interest in how we isolate ourselves from one another seems as simple as his visual style, which encourages contemplation rather than distraction. He holds his shots longer than most contemporary filmmakers, inviting you to rummage around images in which a change in focus and a darkly brooding sky mirror the discreetly   shifting emotions creeping around their edges.  Mr. Ceylan is, as it also happens, a fine actor. He plays the lead in “Climates,” Isa, a professor who, when the film opens, is on a road trip with his younger girlfriend, Bahar (Ebru Ceylan, the director’s wife). The unhurried opening, which takes place amid ancient ruins,  sets  the pace and fixes the current climate: under the hot sun, Bahar watches as her lover distractedly walks around crumbled columns taking photographs and briefly stumbles (he smiles at his misstep),  while remaining apparently oblivious to the tears that begin streaking her face. It’s on this same trip that they drink too much wine at dinner and that, one afternoon,  she covers his eyes with her hands while he’s driving their scooter, causing an accident.  Isa and Bahar walk away from the accident intact though not unscathed. She returns home to Istanbul alone. Much of the rest of the film follows Isa, who, over the course of the ensuing fall and winter, emerges as a man of great surface charm. He teaches, plays tennis, politely rebuffs friends and, during one bravura scene, engages in a bout of raucous sex across a hardwood floor with another lover, Serap (Nazan Kesal). This blast of heat is so surprising (and funny) that it would be easy to overlook the intricate choreography involving the bodies and the camera, and how the nut that Isa playfully throws at Serap, and that hits the floor just before they do, finds a visual echo in one of her dropped earrings.  Like “Distant,” this film paints a haunting portrait of existential solitude, one in which the images speak louder and often more forcefully than do any of the words. Mr. Ceylan doesn’t write speeches or flatter the audience by offering us more information than he gives his character. His scenes play out to the natural rhythms of life, their meaning often articulated in silences, digressions and awkward laughter, as when Isa visits his mother, who repairs the pants he tore during his rollicking session with Serap, and then, with touching obliviousness, asks when he plans to settle down. Even when the dialogue sounds sharper, more obviously pointed, as in a casually sexist conversation between Isa and his office mate, its thematic importance tends to sneak in after the fact.  Although the film’s  provenance and the calamitous distribution climate for foreign-language cinema in America mean that it’s destined for eye-blink runs at a handful of art-house theaters, “Climates” isn’t difficult or obscure. Its metaphors are transparent, its narrative structure uncomplicated. It’s a satisfyingly adult film about men and women and relationships that might  seduce audiences more easily if it were French, though in that case it would probably be three times as chatty.  Mr. Ceylan has clearly been influenced by any number of modernist auteurs, including Michelangelo Antonioni. But while his films are similarly personal, they’re more accessible; h isn’t adding anything new to the language, he’s just extremely fluent. The mysteries of his work are those of the heart, the head, the soul.
Turkey's elegist of existential ennui, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, comes up with his most approachable pic in "Climates," a study of a failed relationship shown largely through the eyes and mind of the middle-aged male partner. Immaculately shot and composed as always, and moving at Ceylan's usual measured pace, this one is slightly enlivened by more likable perfs and a trim 98-minute running time. Co-produced with French coin, a first for the director, pic will be manna for Ceylan's loyal band of critical admirers, feted at serious fests, but a B.O. dud in most territories.
Stylistically, there's little new here that hasn't been seen in his two previous color films, "Clouds of May" (2000) and the 2003 Cannes prize winner, "Distant." Story takes place during three seasons (summer, autumn and snowbound winter); the quality of the images is remarkable, with only one brief night shot hinting at pic's HD origins; and the soundtrack is immensely detailed, from the soft crackle of burning tobacco to the susurration of a summer breeze.
However, as in "Distant," all this technique is in the service of very little at the end of the day. Like many arthouse helmers obsessed with spiritual decay, Ceylan shows the symptoms but not the cause or diagnosis. Though the summertime segment, shot by the resort town of Kas, does much to lighten the mood, there's still an awful lot of mooning around, long silences and internalized emotions.
Film falls into three sections, each roughly half-an-hour long, starting with the central couple, university lecturer Isa (Ceylan himself) and TV art director Bahar (Ebru Ceylan, helmer's real-life wife), on vacation in Kas. Bahar is down in the dumps, and during a dinner with friends and a subsequent day by the seaside the couple's relationship fractures, with Bahar going home alone to Istanbul.
Cut to a rainy autumn in that city and Isa looks up a longtime g.f., Serap (Nazan Kesal), who appears to be partly the cause of the bust-up. At Serap's apartment, she and Isa engage in some rough sex (shown in a single long take) which seems to be a well-rehearsed feature of their on-off relationship. On a later occasion, Serap tells Isa she's heard Bahar has been working in a remote eastern part of the country.
Cut to that location during a snowy winter, and Isa tracks Bahar down in a small town where she's working with her crew on a period TV drama.
Though there's very little in the script that gives much away about his character, Ceylan makes Isa a bearable protag for most of the time, with flashes of lightness -- as in a scene with his parents (played by helmer's own parents, M. Emin and Fatma Ceylan) -- that mask the fact he's a quietly calculating man.
Most substantial of the two women is Kesal's Serap, who accepts Isa on his own terms; as Bahar, Ebru Ceylan spends most of the film staring into the middle distance or sobbing.
Lensing by Gokhan Tiryaki conjures up some remarkable vistas and cloudscapes, as well as some impressively detailed closeups (notably in the beach scene), to accompany the thin tale. But like Isa, pic remains behind a glass wall emotionally.

A terrific movie in the Antonioni tradition, Climates  confirms 47-year-old Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan  as one of the world's most accomplished filmmakershandling the end of a relationship and the cloud of human confusion rising from its wreckage as if the subject had never before been attempted.
Urban professionals on vacation: Bahar is a sullen twentysomething TV art director; Isa, 20 years older, is an overbearing university instructor. The opening sequence alternates between mega close-ups of bored Bahar in the summer sun and long shots of Isa, glimpsed between the pillars of the Roman ruins that he's photographing for his still unfinished dissertation. What is she looking at and what is he looking for?
The imperfect not-quite-disengagement of these two isolated figures makes for a more emotionally complex tale than Ceylan's 2003 Distant , in which a country bumpkin moves in with his massively indifferent city cousin. The tone is pensive and the narrative fluid. (Sitting on the beach, Isa wants to end the affair; he rehearses a line that segues into his actual conversation with Bahar.) A symbolic motorbike mishap notwithstanding, the couple's breakup is more mediocre than bad. The situation is rendered extraordinary through Ceylan's use of landscape as objective correlativethe action, such as it is, moving from Black Sea  resort to Istanbul  to wintry province in eastern Turkey .
Superbly crafted on high-definition video, Climates is a movie of intimate, unbalanced compositions. Ceylan specializes in human microbehavior. Were it not for the studied sound mix (so crisp you can hear the cigarettes sizzle), he might be directing a silent movie. Climates ' best moments chart the reactions of one character to another when the second unexpectedly appears. The default mode is a watchful look at once sheepish and challenging. Alienation is palpable and ambivalence universal. (The sense of the human condition is that expressed by Marilyn Monroe  in There's No Business Like Show Business : "After you get what you want you don't want it.") When the newly single Isa drops in on his ex, she can't decide whether to be hostile or hysterical. After a few preliminaries, he pins her on the floor.
Climates  is filled with unforced metaphors the tacky music box Isa gives Bahar, the televised earthquake he watchesmany of them meteorological. Isa tells a colleague that he's going south for his vacation: "I need some decent weather." He next appears in a snowy dump where he's heard Bahar has gone on location. (In one of the movie's several extraordinary one-on-ones, Isa corners her as she waits in a van, the film crew loading equipment behind them, and proposes.)
Knowledge that Isa is played by the director and Bahar by his wife, Ebru Ceylan , inflects Climates  less toward confessional psychodrama than ultra-professional acting exercise. Ceylan wants to make certain that his character is understood as a mildly odious, self-pitying passive-aggressive type; his wife's character has the monopoly on inner life, expressed not only by her mood-flickering close-ups but two dreams. The wonderful ending ponders her face once more. The falling snow substitutes for unshed tears.
