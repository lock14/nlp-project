The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  is the most beautiful movie ever made about a man who could only move one eyelid  almost dangerously beautiful. I tend to be wary of ethereal composition applied to unpoetic, human, physical mess, for its romanticizing, narcotizing effect. But this assertive adaptation brings Jean-Dominique Bauby's phenomenal memoir, Le scaphandre et le papillon , to life honestly.
Bauby (a bravura Mathieu Amalric from Munich , ablaze even when motionless) was in his robust 40s, the high-flying editor of French Elle  magazine, when a massive stroke spared his mind but permanently paralyzed his body in a condition known as ''locked-in syndrome.'' After he emerged from a 20-day coma, a devoted nursing team taught the patient to communicate by blinking that eyelid, yes or no, as an alphabet was read to him with which he could spell one word, letter by letter, and then another. And with those blinks, Bauby produced a testament to living, loving, raging, even laughing. He died a few days after the book was published in France, in 1997. He was 45.
It's of no small interest that while he wrote, Bauby (ever the editor attuned to cultural trends) communicated his keen interest in getting the book made into a movie. Indeed, it wouldn't surprise me if the worldly, once powerful arbiter of tastes blinked out the name Julian Schnabel as his director of choice, so temperamentally suited is the outsize filmmaker to Bauby's own dynamic prose. Set free by Ronald Stevenson Harwood's striking script, which views the story from Bauby's eye and his experience of a deadened body and roving mind, Schnabel treats The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  as a giant canvas. Here, the artist who used to glue broken pottery to his own paintings has scattered, layered, and shuffled images to create a very specific universe as sensual as the subject himself described it in hard-won words.
When Bauby is rolled in a wheelchair to a hospital balcony for a view of the sea, or visited by his three children, or cleaned like a baby, those exterior events flow seamlessly into exquisite visual evocations of the writer's interior fantasies. Beautiful women parade in and out for our delectation, including the mother of his children (Emmanuelle Seigner), who remains faithful at her straying man's bedside; the angel-like therapists who encourage him (including a beatific Marie-Josée Croze, Anne Consigny, and Schnabel's wife, Olatz Lopez Garmendia); and, fleetingly, in memories of his lover (Lady Chatterley 's Marina Hands), who now can't bear to see her man.
Bauby invented his own metaphor for the reality of his body held prisoner. ''My diving bell becomes less oppressive, and my mind takes flight like a butterfly,'' he wrote. ''There is so much to do.'' This movie does what Bauby wanted to, with appropriate panache.

 Julian Schnabel has made three feature films: “Basquiat,” “Before Night Falls” and now “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.” All are biographical, examining  the lives of real people, and in each case the protagonist struggles with a condition of literal or metaphorical imprisonment. Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mr. Schnabel’s younger colleague in the New York art scene of the 1980s, is trapped by addiction and by his outsider status. Reinaldo Arenas, the gay Cuban poet whose memoir was the basis of “Before Night Falls,” is censored, harassed and locked up by successive dictatorships.  Jean-Dominique Bauby, a French fashion magazine editor and the author of the international best seller on which “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” is based, suffered an even more extreme form of confinement. In his early 40s, he suffered a stroke that left him in a rare affliction called “locked-in syndrome.” He retained vision and hearing, and his mind continued to function perfectly, but his body was almost completely paralyzed. He could not move or speak. In the film a friend, visiting him in the hospital in Berck, a wind-swept seaside town in northern France, reports the latest gossip from the cafes of Paris: “Have you heard? Jean-Dominique is a vegetable.”  “What kind of vegetable?” Jean-Dominique wonders. “A carrot? A pickle?” Like his condition, the metaphor is cruel, but not altogether unredeemable. As we come to understand in the course of this fierce and lovely film, his existence is not that of a vegetable but rather of a garden, a hothouse of consciousness, memory and ecstatic imagination.  Jean-Dominique is played by Mathieu Amalric, a French actor whose twitching, antic physicality makes the character’s immobility all the more painful. But “The Diving Bell,” true to its hero and its literary source, is neither morbid nor mawkish. Propped up in a wheelchair, able to communicate only by blinking his left eye (the other, in one especially nightmarish scene, has been sewn shut to prevent infection), he remains a sensualist, a bon vivant and a keen literary wit.  But never a saint. Before his stroke  Jean-Dominique led a life of glamour, pleasure and self-indulgence, for which he never apologizes. He had recently left Céline (Emmanuelle Seigner), his longtime partner and the mother of his three children, an abandonment that seemed to follow a series of betrayals. Céline appears, nonetheless, at the hospital in Berck, fighting back tears and demonstrating a loyalty that comes close to masochism. In spite of his lapses, she clearly loves Jean-Dominique, and she is not alone.  Besides other women (Marina Hands, most memorably), there are acquaintances, colleagues (notably Isaach de Bankole) and Jean-Dominique’s father, a rogue of the old school played with magnificent poignancy by Max von Sydow.  The phrase “triumph of the human spirit” hovers over “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés. But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind. Limitation, constraint, incarceration —  these may be, as I’ve suggested, the shared premises of Mr. Schnabel’s films (and also of some of Mr. Harwood’s work, notably his script for “The Pianist”).  Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual.  But Mr. Schnabel is not content simply to state or to dramatize this idea. Rather, he demonstrates his own imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.  And yet he also shows astonishing formal control. The movie begins  claustrophobically, as we see the blurry bustle of the hospital room from Jean-Dominique’s hazy, panicked perspective. Faces loom suddenly and awkwardly into view, while his captive consciousness writhes in its cage, trying to make contact with the world outside.  After a while it  does, with the help of a speech therapist (the marvelously sensitive Marie-Josée Croze) who patiently teaches Jean-Dominique to turn his left eyelid into a means of communication. She sits beside him, reciting the alphabet and stopping when he blinks, piecing together words and sentences from his signals.  Later an amanuensis (Anne Consigny) takes her place, and together she and Jean-Dominique compose the compact, lyrical book that will become Mr. Schnabel’s expansive, passionate film. Their attention also introduces both the patient and the audience to an intense, nonsexual intimacy that is itself a form of love.  As Jean-Dominique’s eloquence takes flight, so does Mr. Schnabel’s. Condemned to live in an eternal present, Jean-Dominique is also freed from the tyranny of time, and so the film ranges freely into fantasy, speculation and remembrance, given shape not by a plot but by the ecstatic logic of images and associations. Working with the brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, he uses light and color to convey the world of sensations from which Jean-Dominique is exiled, but which he appreciated all the more acutely for that reason.  And so, curiously enough, a movie about deprivation becomes a celebration of the richness of experience, and a remarkably rich experience in its own right. In his memoir Mr. Bauby performed a heroic feat of alchemy, turning horror into wisdom, and Mr. Schnabel, following his example and paying tribute to his accomplishment, has turned pity into joy.  “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It has some sexual situations.

The almost unbearably poignant memoir of Jean-Dominique Bauby, who found himself immobilized by "locked-in syndrome" after a stroke, becomes a ready-made canvas for the painterly indulgences of Julian Schnabel in "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly." Most compelling in its attempts to re-create the experience of paralysis onscreen, gorgeously lensed pic morphs into a dreamlike collage of memories and fantasies, distancing the viewer somewhat from Bauby's consciousness even as it seeks to take one deeper. Still affecting, and already sold to a number of territories, bittersweet "Butterfly" should find a warm worldwide reception upon release from the Cannes cocoon.
It's impossible to read even a sentence of Bauby's miraculous memoir -- published in 1997, three days before the former Elle editor-in-chief died at 45 -- without an awareness of the monumental exertions it must have taken him to write it. Painstakingly dictated, one letter and one blink at a time (his eyelid being the only muscle he could control), it's the work of a fantastically keen and witty mind, trapped in a vegetative state.
The viewer experiences that state alongside Bauby (played by Mathieu Amalric) from the film's disorienting first frame, which opens, "Twilight Zone"-like, from the p.o.v. of a hospital bed as he awakens from a coma. Realizing he can't move or speak, Bauby learns from the smarmy Dr. Lepage (Patrick Chesnais) that his brain stem has been incapacitated, leaving him paralyzed.
Early sequences are inventively shot by Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski, who blurs the focus and makes the images quake and shudder, mimicking the sensations of drifting in and out of consciousness. It's from this vantage that we meet the people in Bauby's life, including his children, Theophile (Theo Sampaio) and Celeste (Fiorella Campanella); their mother, Celine (Emmanuelle Seigner); speech therapist Henriette (Marie-Josee Croze), who teaches him the rudimentary, blink-powered alphabet system that becomes his means of communication; and Claude (Anne Consigny), who takes dictation for his book.
Staying at a naval hospital in northern France, Bauby also receives visits from friends Laurent (Isaach de Bankole) and Roussin (Niels Arestrup). Latter's own amazing backstory, involving four years spent as a hostage in Beirut, awakens unresolved feelings of guilt in Bauby.
Though the initial first-person perspective may try some auds' patience, Amalric's delightful interior monologue -- by turns wry, sardonic, panicky and lascivious -- proves continually involving. It doesn't hurt that almost every woman who enters the frame (health-care professionals included) looks young and beautiful enough to have stepped from the pages of Bauby's magazine, or that the walls of the coastal hospital are such an inviting shade of sea green. Even when portraying the lower depths of human suffering, artist-turned-filmmaker Schnabel paints a pretty picture.
Eventually, the camera's scope broadens and the viewer is taken outside Bauby's motionless form, shown confined to either bed or wheelchair. Additional stimulation is provided by the vivid interpretations of Bauby's very active imagination: The titular symbols of oppression and freedom are both literalized, as is an extended hallucination of the Empress Eugenie. "I cultivate the art of simmering memories," Bauby writes, and the book is crammed with intimate reveries and recollections that Schnabel all but lunges at in his eagerness to craft a surreally creative essay on the human condition.
In that respect, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" fits snugly alongside 1996's "Basquiat" and 2000's "Before Night Falls" in Schnabel's gallery of tortured, misunderstood artists. But the fact that Bauby suffered for every word of his art, whereas Schnabel has bottomless visual resources at his disposal, inevitably makes the film a less intimate, more exterior experience.
Amalric is perfect within the tightly circumscribed parameters of his role, spending much of the pic immobilized with one eye wide open and his lip in a permanent droop. Thesp also has a pair of wonderful scenes with Max Von Sydow as his aging father, who weeps when he realizes, during a phone call, that Bauby can't answer back.
Pic reps a talent reunion of sorts from Spielberg's "Munich," reteaming producer Kathleen Kennedy, actors Amalric and Croze, and d.p. Kaminski, whose work is a continual wonder to behold. Juliette Welfing's editing maintains coherence despite multiple shifts in perspective.
Paul Cantelon's piano music amplifies the film's delicate, conflicting emotions, while somewhat less gracefully, the soundtrack samples everything from U2 and Tom Waits to the scores from "The 400 Blows" and "Lolita." Inventive credits sequences were designed by Schnabel himself.

At this year's Cannes Film Festival , the American painter turned filmmaker Julian Schnabel  won the jury's Best Director award for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , his French-language adaptation of the bestselling memoir by the late Elle  magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby . Felled by a massive stroke at age 43, Bauby was left fully conscious but completely paralyzed, save for the ability to rotate his head and blink his left eye. (It was by blinking in reaction to an ingenious alphabet system devised by one of his speech therapists that Bauby was eventually able to "dictate" his book.) If such awards were determined on the basis of quantity alone, there'd be no question that Schnabel's was deserved, for there is more directing per square inch of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly than one is likely to find in any other movie released this year.
The movie's central gimmickand make no mistake, it's a gimmickis that for large chunks of the running time, we see things as Schnabel imagines Bauby (played by Mathieu Amalric ) saw them, from a fixed perspective and with many strange tricks of the light. Shot by the acclaimed Polish cinematographer Janusz Kaminski , Diving Bell is an ocular orgy of blurred images, flickering exposures, distorted wide angles, and extreme close-ups. In one especially you-are-there moment, we see the occlusion of Bauby's atrophied right eye from the inside-out (an image Schnabel and Kaminski devised by applying two layers of latex to the camera lens and then sewing them together). And even when Schnabel drops the subjective p.o.v. or lapses into flashbacks from Bauby's pre-stroke life, he employs the same rampant overstylization. It's the most sensually assaulting movie in recent memory with the possible exception of Michael Bay 's Transformers , and yet many of the same people who criticized Bay for his attention-deficient aesthetics are falling over each other to praise Schnabel. Why? Because instead of ransacking the storehouse of commercial advertising for his inspiration, he steals his visual tricks from more highfalutin sources like Fellini and Stan Brakhage .
Of course, Bauby's story is  remarkable only not just for the reasons that Schnabel and his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood , keep telling us. The movie focuses so narrowly on the idea of communicationon how Bauby, despite his condition, manages to re-establish contact with the outside worldthat it's as if My Left Foot had never moved beyond its early scene of palsy-stricken author and painter Christy Brown  picking up a piece of chalk between his toes and writing for the first time. But what made My Left Foot great was the sense that being confined to a wheelchair in no way ennobled Brown or diminished the messy tangle of his personal life. Much the same could be said of Bauby, a bon vivant who, at the time of his stroke, had recently separated from the mother of his three young children and moved in with another mistress. But the delicious idea of these two beauties continuing to vie for Bauby's affections, even in his semi-vegetative statewhereupon they are joined by a parade of heart-stoppingly gorgeous therapists and pathologistsis touched on by Schnabel and Harwood only fleetingly, chiefly during one extraordinary scene not in the book, in which Bauby must prevail on his former lover (the superb Emmanuelle Seigner ) to "translate" for him during a telephone call to his current flame.
There are a handful of similarly affecting moments scattered throughout, including two scenes featuring Max von Sydow  as Bauby's 92-year-old father. They work in a way the rest of the film doesn't because Schnabel (who himself has five children from two marriages and cared for his own nonagenarian father toward the end of his life) seems to be communing with his subject on a particularly personal level. Far too often, though, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly feels grotesquely calculated, especially the more Schnabel ratchets up the inspirational platitudes of exactly the sort that Baubywho maintained an acerbic sense of humor about his situation until the very endwould have despised.
The inelegant yet functional name of Bauby's rare condition was "locked-in syndrome," and here, too, there's a vastly more intriguing movie existing somewhere beneath the surface of a boilerplate Hollywood  weepie. It's like a butterfly with lead for wings.
