Although this movie stokes the dying embers of uncertainty regarding the 1959 death of George Reeves, TV's Superman, it nevertheless seems that the result should be more provocative and scandalous. As it is, Hollywoodland
 is a Tinseltown story without the tinsel, a whodunit that has little mystery. Reeves died from a single gunshot wound that was ruled a suicide, although some suspicion lingers to this day as to the accuracy of that determination. It is presumed that Reeves committed suicide because he was despondent about the stasis in his career, having begun auspiciously with his screen debut in Gone With the Wind
 but having stalled unexpectedly as a result of the typecasting that haunted the actor in his post-Superman hunt for work. The film is quite insightful about the pitfalls of Hollywood fame, and the casting of Affleck (who also has some firsthand knowledge of the subject) is full of sly resonance, apart from the overt physical resemblance of the two cleft-chin actors. In fact, the acting in the film is terrific and goes a long way toward creating the film's old Hollywood feel � even though Hollywoodland
 never achieves the same definition as its obvious model L.A. Confidential
. The script, by Paul Bernbaum, loses its focus by turning Brody's low-rent private eye, Louis Simo, into the central character of the story. Despite his separation from his wife, Simo still tries to be an attentive father to his young son, who becomes devastated over Superman's suicide. A parallel story about a marital-infidelity case Simo is working on, which goes awry, only adds extra clutter. And the film's last third, which plays out several death-scene scenarios, is the kind of a la carte filmmaking that bespeaks an ultimate lack of viewpoint. The introduction of MGM head of publicity Howard Strickland (Spano, in bad make-up) comes too late in the story to carry the pervasive sense of menace the character is meant to convey. Director Coulter, who has helmed many excellent episodes of The Sopranos
 and Sex and the City
 seems less sure of himself in his first-time feature directing gig. The window Hollywoodland
 offers into old-style workings of the company town is fascinating to behold, however, the film doesn't always know where to direct our gaze.


Set in 1950s Tinseltown, ``Hollywoodland" has scraps of old movie glamour. It also has shades of later movies that sullied all that class and refinement with a lurid touch, namely Roman Polanski's ``Chinatown." But that's all ``Hollywoodland" is: scraps and shade.
Written by Paul Bernbaum and directed by Allen Coulter , ``Hollywoodland" turns the 1959 death of George Reeves (Ben Affleck ) -- television's first Superman -- into a pulpy murder mystery: Did he off himself or was he actually killed?
Another tale of a gruesomely dead lesser actor (Bob Fosse's ``Star 80" and Paul Schrader's ``Auto Focus" precede Coulter's), the movie's flashbacks to Reeve's life are inconclusive. And since the film can't say what happened one way or the other (ruled a suicide, the official case remains unsolved), ``Hollywoodland" often feels uncertain. Half of the film is more persuasive than the other, and the connective threads are thin.
In the hope of fleshing it out, the film concocts Louis Simo (Adrien Brody ), the type of private eye who goes spying on the wives of cuckolded husbands. He's a bottom - feeder, taking cases the Los Angeles Police Department can't be bothered to investigate further. Simo gets a tip from a detective friend that the Reeves shooting might not be a suicide. Reeves's mother (Lois Smith ) certainly doesn't think it was. She hires Simo to look into it. The film cuts between his investigation and scenes of the actor in the years before his death.
Here, George is a strapping fellow of modest talents and moderate success, frequently cast in small parts. His aspirations of being a leading man fail to materialize, although he has been able to live off the fumes of his brief appearance in ``Gone With the Wind." Nonetheless, George is a fun-loving and sensitive lug. And at a party one evening, his charm wins him a break. In the film's best sequence, he has a nice, flirty conversation with luminous Toni Mannix (Diane Lane ), whose husband, Eddie (Bob Hoskins ), is a publicity bigwig at MGM.
That doesn't prohibit Toni and this handsome younger man from beginning a mutually advantageous affair. He beds her and makes her laugh. She buys him a bungalow and introduces him to the right people, one of whom tips him off to an audition for a new show called ``Adventures of Superman." This isn't what George has in mind for himself , but he takes the part anyway -- it's lucrative. ``Superman" makes him a star, but the show blinds the public and Hollywood from seeing him as anyone else. His limited career opportunities coupled with Toni's increasing possessiveness make him feel captive.
There are degrees of torture, grief, and self-pity in Affleck's performance. But the real surprise is his comfort with looking like a star. He is classic-Hollywood handsome (for once that jaw line has a purpose), and there is real crackle between him and Lane. She looks seductive, and he seems seduced. But the movie is up to too much -- and yet not nearly enough -- to give either star room to breathe.
Indeed, that part of this story is so well told, and Affleck so good in the telling, that it's hard to understand, aside from the most pretentious artistic aims, why the filmmakers bothered with the detective story. The flashbacks only amplify the discordant tone. Characteristically tough and feeble-seeming (he always looks like something the Rat Pack dragged in), Brody acquits himself.
But Simo is justifiable only as an excuse to root through the dirt of this sordid story. Saddling the character with a melodrama involving his ex-wife (Molly Parker ) and increasingly estranged little boy is transparent. The happy news is that his search does turn up a delightfully nasty Robin Tunney as the suspect woman to whom George was engaged as he tried to extricate himself from Toni.
Yet the movie doesn't build to anything dramatic or enlightening. You can tell that Bernbaum and Coulter, the director of several fine ``Sopranos" episodes in his feature debut , want to achieve cultural resonance. It's there in their depiction of Reeves's career trap: What is the elusive ``It" that makes an actor a movie star? And it surfaces when the film mentions how freaked out American children are by the irony that Superman is dead.
Sadly, those are small parts of the film. ``Hollywoodland" really wants to conjure the decadence of those other two iconic Los Angeles period movies, ``Chinatown" and ``L.A. Confidential." But it's incapable of dredging up the psychological horrors in Polanski's film or capturing the fraught social history in Curtis Hanson's.
Only Affleck comes close to embodying a complete sense of despair, and there's not enough of him. Why? That's the movie's biggest unsolved crime.


         "Hollywoodland" is an ambitious film that succeeds only up to a point but no further. This overly derivative motion picture thinks it is doing and saying more than it is. Instead, it ends up as little more than a reasonable facsimile of the real thing, despite a subtle and effective performance by Ben Affleck, of all people.
 
  In some ways that unfulfilled trajectory matches that of "Hollywoodland's" protagonist, the real-life actor George Reeves, who wants to have Clark Gable's career but detours into the wasteland of 1950s series television to star in "Adventures of Superman." When his body is found in the Benedict Canyon home he shared with his fiancée (Robin Tunney) on June 16, 1959, the police call it suicide, but several people have their own reasons for not being sure.
 


         






    Chief among them is fictional private detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), newly on his own after splitting with both his agency and his wife, Laurie (Molly Parker). Simo gets himself hired by Reeves' mother (Lois Smith) and starts looking into who might have had it in for the 45-year-old actor who'd started his career so promisingly with a featured role in "Gone With the Wind."
 
  Simo's investigations, and glimpses of his own messy private life, alternate with flashbacks of what Reeves (Affleck) was up to when he was alive.
 
  As written by Paul Bernbaum and directed by Allen Coulter, both in their theatrical feature debuts, "Hollywoodland" wants to ask all the important questions about the nature of power and celebrity, about the traps and snares of the Hollywood life. It has its eye on prizes like "Chinatown" and "L.A. Confidential," but its execution falls short.
 
  This kind of push-pull, "yes, but ... " quality characterizes a lot of what "Hollywoodland" does. The film is a bear for visual accuracy, putting a lot of effort into getting the look of the 1950s just right, but its very authenticity starts to feel oppressive, as if too much of the project's energy went into sweating those details.
 
  Similarly, though inside-Hollywood scenarios can have an intrinsic watchability, there is a pro forma quality to the way "Hollywoodland" follows its two parallel stories. Perhaps because Brody's casting as a narcissistic, toothpick-chewing private eye, cocky to a fault, is so on the nose, neither the unfolding of his personal life nor his travails as a private eye completely hold our attention.
 
  What happens to Reeves is of greater interest. A man serious about his acting reduced to "The Adventures of Sir Galahad," a Saturday matinee serial so low-budget "we all rode the same horse," Reeves is introduced at Ciro's celebrity nightspot maneuvering into a photograph to enhance his visibility in the hopes of future employment.
 
  It's at Ciro's that he meets the older but still attractive Toni Mannix (the always invaluable Diane Lane), the wife of MGM's powerful vice president Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins).
 
  They begin an archetypal torrid affair, with Toni buying him expensive presents, including a watch with a "Mad About the Boy" inscription cribbed from "Sunset Boulevard." Reeves genuinely cares about Toni, but he chafes at being a kept man. He's also uncertain about being cast as Superman, worrying that he'll "look like a damn fool." When the show becomes an unexpected success, and Reeves finds that his public is largely younger than 10 years old and male, that is also not particularly to his liking.
 
  Perhaps because his own career has had its unexpected downturns, Affleck is particularly effective as a man simultaneously desperate and full of himself. He captures the sensitivities and insecurities of an actor who is not being taken seriously, someone who is worried to death despite his glib repartee. With its combination of vulnerability and charm, this is perhaps Affleck's most interesting performance, and certainly one of his best.
 
  Though his part is much smaller, Hoskins does a splendid job as studio fixer Mannix, a thug in Hollywood clothing whose only comment on "Gone With the Wind" is to note "that picture made money." In some ways Hoskins' performance is the most real and most grounded one in this picture, the one that shows the direction "Holly-woodland" should have taken if it could. For despite its virtues, "Hollywoodland" never fully succeeds due to the unfortunate air of artificiality that hangs over it. Caught in a netherworld between re-creation and reality, it only sporadically feels like it is actually happening. Director Coulter, nominated four times for Directors Guild of America awards for work on "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City," has ended up with something that is hollower than it wants to be, a picture unable to manage the fuller resonances its role models took for granted.
 
  This inability to fully involve us extends to the question of what caused Reeves death. "Hollywoodland" offers three scenarios to choose from, but the mystery becomes less rather than more interesting as the film goes on. The question critic Edmund Wilson famously asked in his attack on detective stories — "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?" — works just as well with George Reeves in the title.

Back in the 1950s, when lumpy could pass for hunky, George Reeves was  the Man of Steel. Planting fists on hips clad in a man-girdle over tights, sucking in sixpackless abs, and letting wind machines flutter the kind of beach-towel cape that made The Incredibles ' Edna Mode ban those garments from her couture collection, the amateur boxer-turned actor wowed the pint-size TV-watching audience of The Adventures of Superman  with his pursuit of truth, justice, and the American way, and became one of the young medium's first superstars. He also became one of the first to be tripped up by his own TV-size celebrity: Not only was he stereotyped at the expense of further movie-role opportunities but he was also entangled in a very public, long-term affair with Toni Mannix, the jealous wife of an MGM studio exec with gangster connections. (The Mannixes had a marital understanding; if she was extracurricularly happy, he was happy.) In desperation, an unemployed Reeves was considering a turn to exhibition wrestling when he died in 1959, in his bedroom, of wounds from a speeding bullet. He was 45 years old. Although ruled a suicide at the time, there has never been definite proof as to who pulled the trigger: Was it a despondent Reeves himself? A thug dispatched on behalf of Edgar Mannix? Or was it maybe Leonore Lemmon, the ambitious young socialite for whom Reeves had left a distraught, older Mrs. M?
The elegant biodrama Hollywoodland  presents all options in its meditation on the price of the American way of fame, a toll exacted even back when ''land'' still completed the letters of the sign famously visible from high in the Hollywood Hills. But a bit too daintily, the pic also sides with none of them, as if ''all of the above'' is the safe answer to the mystery. The chief frustration of this otherwise well-made, well-acted, well-heeled picture  a movie classy in its artful modesty, with every detail of plot and period furnishings lovingly conceived, every lick of jazz-influenced score true to the times  is that it is so very self-absorbedly graceful about something so very insular and...unremarkable. Intertwining the dissatisfactions of Reeves (Ben Affleck) with the compromises of Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), the fly-by-night detective hired by the actor's mother to look further into who might have shot her famous son, writer Paul Bernbaum (in his first produced feature screenplay) and Sopranos  director Allen Coulter (also making his feature debut) clearly aim to double the weight of Tinseltown soullessness by adding together the self-delusions of both men; instead the filmmakers detract from the puny, innocence-busting sadness of Reeves' unique TV-tinsel story, so that Hollywoodland  becomes just another L.A. confidential about Sunset Boulevard, about gods and monsters, and the way most men share DNA with Clark Kent, not Superman.
On the other hand, no false refinement obscures the gusto with which the cast chomp down on their tasty roles: Brody slithering and prowling, Diane Lane willing her sensual beauty to weariness as Toni Mannix, Bob Hoskins snarling and potent as her husband, Robin Tunney brandishing the pout of a bored wannabe as Leonore, and all of them enhancing Affleck  hungriest of all  as Reeves. There's something simultaneously heartfelt, wised-up, playful, and fierce about the way the onetime Daredevil acknowledges that he knows that we know that he knows that we're bound to read something of the actor's own skids with fame in his expiatory portrayal of a star who couldn't quite steer his own image.
The Society for the Rehabilitation of Thespian Reputations would be proud of Affleck as he packs himself into his Superman duds, aware of the absurdity of a grown man hauled around by wires to juvenile acclaim; when the cameras aren't rolling, his Reeves smokes and drinks like a superhero out of MAD  magazine, not DC Comics. ''You can't see my penis, can you?'' he checks backstage before making a promotional appearance in full super-underpants regalia before a crowd of pip-squeaks, as telefilm-trained cinematographer Jonathan Freeman captures the savagery just behind all that visual wholesomeness. It's impossible not to be just a little bit more charmed than usual when it's Ben Affleck asking the question. Look! Up in the air! It's the likable Clark Kent of a star who survived Gigli , and whose exploits both on and off the screen have been held up to an X-ray scrutiny intense enough to burn through kryptonite.

 A POSTER for the period drama “Hollywoodland” says that “dying in Hollywood can make you a legend.” George Reeves would have been flattered. A two-bit talent who is the film’s nominal reason for being, Mr. Reeves is best remembered, if at all, for two things: playing Superman on TV, and a bullet in the head. In 1959 someone blew his brains out in a house tucked between Sunset Boulevard and Mulholland Drive. The death was ruled a suicide, but the movies love a tasty murder, which is why Ben Affleck has packed on the pounds, slipped on some tights and given this exasperating film far more than it gives in return.  “Hollywoodland” tells several stories, one of them reasonably well. Before he became a cautionary tale about making it in the movies, Mr. Reeves was a smoothie with brilliantine hair as slick as his pickup lines. In the early 1950’s he was hustling hard, hitting auditions while the sun was up and cruising the nightclub scene after dark. He was trying to build on his decent roles in forgettable films and negligible parts in memorable ones, including a bit as an eager young caller who worships at Scarlett O’Hara’s feet in “Gone With the Wind.” Even now, if you didn’t know Mr. Reeves from “The Adventures of Superman” you might not notice him next to Vivien Leigh and David O. Selznick’s expensive sets, which of course was the problem.  Mr. Reeves didn’t have the requisite acting skills that might have led to steady work, much less marquee billing: he was a would-be star in a town full of extras with superior luck, looks and talent. In the late 1930’s, when he appeared in “Gone With the Wind,” he was pretty, if not pretty enough to break ranks. As the years passed, and the pounds and disappointment mounted, the prettiness disappeared as did the opportunities.  By the early 1950’s what remained was a puffy face that was quick to smile but, at least on “Superman,” could seem impatient, almost irritable. As it happens, all those times Clark Kent took Jimmy Olsen to task, it might have been Mr. Reeves who was expressing his own discontent. That, at any rate, is how the world turns in “Hollywoodland.”  In 1951 Mr. Reeves met the older, far richer Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), a Hollywood wife made vulnerable, if not yet humble, by age. A former actress of no note, she was married to the MGM executive Edward J. Mannix, played by Bob Hoskins, perhaps accurately, as a thug in a front-office suit. Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, with his-and-her paramours to go with the other servants, the couple was powerful enough to take their playmates out on a double date. Pets yukking it up with their masters at the dinner table is an ideal setup for the director Allen Coulter, who until now has only worked on a small canvas directing for television.  Mr. Coulter and the screenwriter Paul Bernbaum want to bend Mr. Reeves’s biography as an actor-cum-gigolo into a tragedy, and Mr. Affleck is more than up to the task. When the actor first eases up to Toni, sweet and softly talking, he makes you see what a woman like her might see in him besides a good time. Buzzing with life, he has yet to fall prey to self-pity, and Toni draws on his youth and his optimism as if from a deep well. Later, as defeat takes its grinding toll, Mr. Affleck lets weariness creep into his face, pulling his features down until it becomes difficult smile. Mr. Reeves’s career shrinks, his silhouette bloats; the pounds turn his body into dough, and then into lead.  George Reeves was a sad case, but not every sob story or even every suicide has the makings of a tragedy. Even the filmmakers don’t seem especially convinced on this count, since half of “Hollywoodland” involves a dead-end pseudo-noir about another hustler, a private eye named Louis Simo, whom Adrien Brody fails to shape into a character of interest despite much aggressive eyebrow raising. Hired to investigate the Reeves death, Simo subsequently enters on a journey that distractingly toggles between his life and that of the dead man, and involves feeling and healing, fathers and sons and an occasional knuckle sandwich. In time Simo learns about facing the life you have rather than the life you want, which may be grand advice in therapy but doesn’t make for involving drama.  Hollywood history is filled with stories as bleak as that of the man who was Superman, if only on TV,  object lessons about hungry hopefuls who went looking for fame and found nothing, or maybe just a little something.  Mr. Reeves might have been disappointed by life whether he became a doctor or a soda jerk at Schwab’s. To amp the pathos, though, the film implies that he was edited out of “From Here to Eternity” because audiences were distracted by Superman trading lines with the star Burt Lancaster. Yet Mr. Reeves is still in the picture, and he’s fine. As a gossipy off-duty soldier in a Hawaiian shirt, he gets the job done. And then he ambles off, leaving the rest of the film to those who could manage it better.  “Hollywoodland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Salty language, partial nudity, gun violence.

"Superman Kills Self" ranks as one of the most traumatic newspaper headlines of the 1950s to many Americans who were kids then, and the little-discussed sad and seamy aspects of the case are explored in "Hollywoodland." First-time scripter Paul Bernbaum's framing story, designed to stir up suspicion that George Reeves was a murder victim rather than a suicide, unfortunately proves far less intriguing than does the melancholy tale of a limited actor reaching the end of the line during a transitional period in Hollywood. Despite solid cast names and the notoriety of the subject matter, just moderate biz looms for this generically titled piece of Tinseltown self-reflection.
Real poignancy might have been wrung from the predicament of Reeves, a good-looking he-man type who started out prominently with a small role in "Gone With the Wind" but whose career did not soar until he started leaping off tall buildings in the '50s TV smash "Adventures of Superman." Even this inadvertent success was undercut by a certain feeling of ridiculousness, this on top of the fact that he was partly supported by an older mistress, the wife of a top MGM executive. At age 45 in 1959, there was the very real possibility that he was washed up, one more pretty face Hollywood had used and spit out.
Bernbaum uses the doubt that has swirled around the circumstances of Reeves' death as a framing device that serves to enumerate the other possibilities -- most prominently, that Reeves was whacked on orders from his scorned mistress's husband -- but that annoyingly distracts from the most flavorsome and involving matters at hand.
Adrien Brody rather frantically plays a young private detective, Louis Simo, who's close to washed up himself. Tipped off that foul play may have been involved in Reeves' death, Simo persuades Reeves' estranged mother (Lois Smith) to make a stink about an alleged cover-up, which puts the desperate dick at odds with civic powers-that-be.
Adding to Simo's woes is his separation from his wife (Molly Parker) and son (Zach Mills), who's withdrawn into a near-catatonic state over "Superman's" demise.
Simo's discoveries about and encounters with Reeves' intimates trigger flashbacks, although it soon becomes clear that Bernbaum should have taken a cue from "Citizen Kane" and realized that there was no need to beef up the investigator's story when the core material held so much more potential.
Pic begins clicking when Reeves, appealingly played with evident depth of sympathy by Ben Affleck, meets Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), showgirl-turned-BevHills grand dame who's all over Reeves within minutes.
The openness of Toni's marriage to Metro "fixer" Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins) is neatly illustrated in an amusing scene of the couple dining together with their respective lovers; the relationship between Reeves and Toni is a civilized and mature one with needs tended to on both sides; the only slightly eyebrow-raising element is Toni's purchase of a lovely Benedict Canyon home (for $12,000!) for Reeves.
Reeves takes the Superman role -- initially for a low-budget 1950 movie, "Superman and the Mole-Men," that a year later morphed into the TV show -- out of near-desperation at the insistence of his practical agent (Jeffrey DeMunn). Toni attends the shooting, both to support and keep a close eye on the new "star" -- and behind-the-scenes glimpses reveal near-Ed Wood-level production values, from the grungy gray-and-brown Superman costume to a flying rig that causes the Man of Steel to crash ignominiously to the floor.
Nevertheless, the show becomes a sensation, a universally shared experience for kids of the era. It's never stated how much (or little) Reeves was paid but, whatever it was, it clearly wasn't enough. He also suffered the curse of the public's total identification of the actor with the role, to the point where his taking other parts became nearly impossible.
All the same, pic errs in implying Reeves was cut out of "From Here to Eternity" due to a preview audience's reaction (a doctored clip from the 1953 Oscar winner shows Affleck in a scene alongside Burt Lancaster); Reeves received 21st billing for his brief part.
Eventually, Reeves dumps Toni and takes up with a younger woman, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney). Trying to get to the bottom of the murder possibilities, detective Simo invades the Mannix home and has sporadic encounters with Leonore, enabling him to imagine scenarios in which Reeves is murdered by a Mannix goon and, alternatively, is accidentally shot by Leonore. It hardly supports the time given over to Simo's investigation that neither theory plays out very plausibly.
The film's strengths lie in the unstated assumptions and emotional undercurrents developed among Reeves, Toni and, to a lesser extent, Eddie Mannix, along with its unstressed but vivid portrait of a Hollywood still dominated by big studio grayhairs but in the midst of a major overhaul to youth and television.
Detracting are not only the mess of Simo's life but the lack of resonant period feel. First-time feature helmer Allen Coulter, responsible for many impressive episodes of "The Sopranos," "Sex and the City," "Six Feet Under" and "Rome," juggles the action competently but without real flair, and the drably brown images suppress the sort of strong atmospheric charge that can still be achieved on modest budgets, such as in "Auto Focus."
Along with Affleck's happy change-of-pace turn, Lane impresses strongly while riding the emotional rollercoaster from self-assured seductress -- she at one point acknowledges she's got seven years left to trade on her looks -- to devastated woman scorned. This is not Brody's finest hour, to put it kindly. Stand-out supporting work comes from Joe Spano, who with great subtlety suggests the supreme power of veteran MGM publicity man Howard Strickling.

If Superman Returns  attempted to resurrect the Man of Steel as mythic hero, the season's other Superman movie wants to disabuse us of any such childish illusions. Glamorously adult, Hollywoodland purports to part the veil on the circumstances by which George Reeves , the actor who embodied the superhero on '50s television, wound up with a bullet in his brain.
Hollywoodland , directed by Allen Coulter  (a veteran of The Sopranos   and Sex and the City  ) from Paul Bernbaum 's screenplay, aspires to a certain authenticity. Suavely self-satisfied Ben Affleck  (natural candidate to star in Kevin Smith 's oft announced, never made Superman Lives ) is typecast as the unfortunate Reeves. Serious intentions are signaled by a somewhat choppy Citizen Kane  structure. Scenes from the actor's life alternate with the investigation into his death conducted by private eye Louis Simo  (Adrien Brody ).
Louis is an enigmatic bottom-feeder; George is a desperate bon vivant, introduced avidly scanning the room at Ciro's for useful contacts. "Hel-loo Billy Wilder ," he remarks to a buddy in the first of many references to the original Hollywood  noir. George fails to connect with Sunset Boulevard 's director but does insinuate himself into a parallel scenario by picking up an experienced dame in Toni Mannix  (Diane Lane ). Or is it vice versa? "I have another seven good years, then my ass drops like a duffel bag," she cheerfully informs him.
An ex-showgirl, at once kittenish and maternal, Toni is married to a much older (and far tougher) MGM executive, the excarny bouncer Eddie Mannix  (Bob Hoskins ). Theirs is an open arrangement. Toni introduces her new fling to Mannix over dinner: "George was in Gone With the Wind , Eddie." (Reeves is in the very first scene among Scarlett O'Hara 's phalanx of beauxa cameo that, for anyone born after World War II, places the entire movie on planet Krypton.) "That picture made money," the deceptively addled thug replies without looking up from his plate.
A kept man and a struggling actor, George takes the Superman  gig in desperation. Coulter provides an amusingly hyper-real reconstruction of this primitive kiddie showwith George suffering the humiliation of a collapsible flying machine. After two years, Kellogg's  decides to sponsor Superman  and George becomes culture hero to the nation's Cub Scouts . This ridiculous success ends his serious career (it's the Gone With the Wind  effect). He's cut out of From Here to Eternity  when the preview audience starts to snicker. George dumps Toni for an ambitious little trollop (Robin Tunney ) who sees Superman as her meal ticket. During the course of a drunken party three days before their wedding, he goes upstairs andcommits suicide?
That's what the LAPD  called it, but starting with Reeves's mother (played by Lois Smith  as the most cantankerous harridan in all Indiana), others suspected foul play. Who arranged the hit? Was it jealous Toni? A vindictive Eddie? George's fiancée? And what's angst- ridden Louis's interest? Somehow, he gloms on to the case in an effort to establish his own super bona fides. Dropping in on his estranged wife soon after Superman's death, Louis learns that "every kid on the block is upset." His own boy has a super breakdown, setting fire to his blue tights and cape. Not that everyone took it so hard. My dim memory of Reeves's demise is mainly a matter of callous schoolyard witticisms concerning kryptonite bullets and actors who imagined they could fly.
Actually, such jejune cynicism is the basis of Hollywoodland 's critique. George does live kiddie shows, during which he entertains the backstage crew by smoking, drinking, and joking about his penis. Like its protagonist, Hollywoodland  has an easy, sleazy appeala languid descent into the mystery's murky depths. The truth turns out to be unknowable, but Hollywoodland  does have a knowing look. Beyond the Googie-style beaneries and Fiesta-ware fashions, behind the fat, florid dialogue camouflaging the unconvincing Rashomon  riffs on Reeves's demise, the movie is steeped in Hollywood lore. Louis, too, has a showbiz past. His head and heart were broken in the so-called Battle of Burbank , when strikers battled goons outside the Warner Bros. studio.
George may be a sap and Louis a hustler, but Hollywoodland has a lot on its mindinflating a scandal that rates barely a page in the second volume of Kenneth Anger 's Hollywood Babylon  into a meditation on the price of fame, the nature of acting, and the basis of fantasy. The dream is a priori corrupteven before MGM tries to sugar Louis off the case. Props then to Affleck. Coulter contrived a neat behavioral trick by inducing his star to play a comparably big-jawed bad actor. Surrounded as he is by canny professionalsLane, Hoskins, Smith, and Jeffrey DeMunn  as an unctuous glad-handing agentit's an unexpectedly touching performance.
In fact, Hollywoodland turns turgid whenever it switches to the gritty Louis Simo story. Real actor Adrien Brody wrestles with an underwritten part whose painful domestic arguments and drunk scenes serve only to parallel those walked through by the fantasy boy. At a certain point, the protags begin to mergethe dick takes a beating that might have been meant for the starbut it's an unequal situation. Brody has to act to make it in Hollywoodland; Affleck simply is .
