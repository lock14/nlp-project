Steven Soderbergh�s Bubble
 is likely to be remembered as the adequate but unspectacular first volley in Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner�s modern experiment in vertical film integration. Through their new media company 2929 Entertainment, the Broadcast.com
 billionaires are now owners of the distribution company Magnolia Pictures, the national arthouse theatre chain Landmark Theatres (which operates the Dobie Theatre in Austin), and the HDNet cable TV channels and production company. Through the integrated cooperation of these companies, Bubble
 is being simultaneously released on cable and in theatres on Jan. 27, and on DVD the following Tuesday, Jan. 31. It�s a move that�s being closely watched throughout the industry, whose executives are currently rethinking their traditional production and exhibition strategies in these days of declining theatre attendance and the explosion of media formats. The Bubble
 release is additionally interesting in light of its being the first major instance of vertical integration in the movie industry since Reaganomics and subsequent economic policies eroded the 1948 ruling against vertical integration in the U.S. movie industry. That antitrust ruling made it illegal for one company to exercise a potentially monopolistic stranglehold by producing, releasing, and exhibiting a movie under the same corporate auspices. Digital technological advances have further streamlined 2929�s ability to manage all aspects of the film pipeline, and to kick off their new experiment the company hired the iconoclastic Soderbergh to make its first six digital features. Bubble
 is the first film to be made and released through this arrangement. The film is a modest story about three workers in a doll factory in a small town in Ohio, near the West Virginia border. Nonprofessional actors star in the movie, which was also shot and edited by Soderbergh, using pseudonyms. The script, by Coleman Hough (who also penned Soderbergh�s last experimental picture, Full Frontal
), spends the first 50 or so minutes observing the lives of the workers before segueing into a wan murder whodunit. Dowdy Martha (Doebereiner) lives with her shut-in father and considers young Kyle (Ashley), who lives with his mother in a trailer, to be her best friend, even though her sentiments are never reciprocated. When Rose (Wilkins) starts working at the factory, her self-serving streak prompts a disruption of the status quo. The murder mystery arrives too late in the story and is too transparent to arouse much narrative curiosity, and the performances are too perfunctory, despite their welcome naturalism, to demand automatic interest. The scenes at the doll factory that reveal the details of the manufacturing process are among the film�s most interesting � which may or may not be the point of the movie. At any rate, Bubble
 is likely to be remembered more for its method of manufacture and release than for any inherent qualities of its own. It will also become one of the many fascinating footnotes in the always provocative career of Steven Soderbergh.


"Bubble" is a stunt in search of a movie, and it almost finds one.
Steven Soderbergh's latest little provocation -- as opposed to the big, slick Hollywood movies like "Ocean's 11" with which he pays the bills -- has been raising a lot of dust in the film industry because of its unusual release pattern: It's arriving today in theaters and on DVD, and can be seen in two showings tonight on the HDNet cable channel. That's a lot of exposure for a murder mystery so minimalist it makes "Dragnet" look like a rave.
The particulars of how and where the movie gets seen don't concern us here, for "Bubble" has novelty enough as a movie. Soderbergh traveled out to the Ohio River Valley and landed in the town of Belpre, where he cast local amateurs and had them improvise dialogue from an outline by screenwriter Coleman Hough. The film was shot on high-definition video in mundane locations: diners, one-bedroom houses, a creepily surreal doll factory. You might mistake the results for reality TV or a home movie if not for a stylistic rigor that's the mark of a born filmmaker.
The movie's a three-hander, really -- a triangle made not out of passion but loneliness. The central character, Martha (Debbie Doebereiner, a KFC general manager in real life), is a dumpy, middle-age factory worker with an air of slightly desperate good cheer. She has curly red hair and myopic eyes, and she clings a little too closely to her co-worker, a quiet young man named Kyle (Dustin James Ashley). They have their small routine: Martha gives Kyle a ride from his mother's house every morning, shares a lunch break with him, drives him home. To her, he's a close friend and her one link with the rest of the world. To him, she's just Martha.
Then Rose is hired to work on the doll assembly line. A sharp-angled girl played by Misty Dawn Wilkins -- what a name! She could be a stripper or an air freshener -- Rose has a 2-year-old daughter and an angry ex-boyfriend (Kyle Smith), and it quickly becomes apparent that she's sizing up Kyle as husband material. It also becomes clear that she's a first-class user underneath the slacker exterior.
Soderbergh films all this with flat, uninflected camera angles and yawning gaps of dead air between the lines of dialogue. The conceit is that this is what fly-over country's really like -- that middle America is a no-man's-land of aimless clock-punching existence and stifling banality and the occasional burp of violence. Someone in "Bubble" ends up murdered and someone else did it, but it almost doesn't matter who, since the people here are almost as interchangeable as doll parts. The film's style holds a mirror to characters who have no reflections.
Well . . . maybe. For all its showy slowness, "Bubble" gets intriguing performances from its cast -- I won't forget Doebereiner's Martha for a long time -- but the way it treats them as found objects borders on the insufferable. The film shares with "Junebug" and other heartland dramas made by smart young filmmakers the rather snotty assumption that it's one big McWasteland out there. There's truth to that, certainly, but there are other, less easy truths lying between the coasts if directors would bother to look for them. Soderbergh has made an experiment worth seeing, but how much do you want to bet his actors have richer lives than the characters they're playing, even if those lives look just as ordinary?
.

         Steven Soderbergh's new movie is called "Bubble," which would suggest that somebody — the characters, the audiences, the filmmakers — is supposed to be hovering above cold, hard reality in a fragile membrane of some kind. Nothing in the lives depicted on the screen reflects the effervescence of the title, though, and the director stares at his protagonists with such austere, Bressonian intensity it starts to feel impolite after a while. Shot on high-definition video on location in Ohio and West Virginia, and directed by Soderbergh from a grimly matter-of-fact (and matter-of-factly grim) script by Coleman Hough ("Full Frontal"), the movie finds so little humor, warmth, spark or purpose in the lives of its protagonists, you wonder if it's intended as satire of the smugness of the art-house beholder — if the bubble of the title, in other words, refers to the one around the audience. More likely is that the filmmakers mean to flip the fluorescent lights on the numbness of working-class life, though it's done from such a cool remove you sort of feel like a jerk for seeing their point.
 
  "Bubble" is the first of six digital movies by Soderbergh for Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban's 2929 Entertainment, which plans to release them on pay TV and DVD at the same time they open in theaters, and it's an odd first choice for the experiment. Stark and slow-moving, "Bubble," which makes "Full Frontal" look like "sex, lies, and videotape," is in little danger of becoming a runaway indie hit.
 


         






    It is, however, strangely absorbing — and its unadorned naturalism and metronomic editing style go a long way to create a feeling of floaty isolation and disconnect. Debbie Doebereiner, who in real life has managed a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Parkersburg, W.Va., for 24 years, plays Martha, an overweight doll factory worker in her 40s who cares for her elderly father and sews doll clothes in her spare time. Her "best friend" is co-worker Kyle (Dustin James Ashley, who in real life is studying to become a computer technician), who lives with his mother in a double-wide trailer. Kyle is functionally mute in the manner of semi-literate, semi-sober dudes everywhere, and his very existence seems permeated with a sort of permanent embarrassment. Whether he reciprocates Martha's friendship is not entirely clear — he's affable enough , but then he relies on her for rides to his other job.
 
  Their daily routine is disrupted by the hiring of Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins, a hairstylist from Belpre, Ohio), an attractive and opportunistic girl in her 20s to whom Kyle is immediately drawn. Rose has an acid tongue, a decadent nonchalance and an easy sexuality that Martha finds inexpressibly threatening. "She scares me a little," Martha tells Kyle, after accompanying Rose to a the modest suburban house Rose is hired to clean, and winding up drifting through it dumbstruck at what she perceives as its opulence, while Rose soaks in the master bathroom tub. Martha picks up her daily crullers at a bakery whose walls are decorated with crucifix cake pans; but the filmmakers choose not to comment— which seems like a pretty clear sign that the whole thing is going to end in tears. Still, Christian-themed baked goods don't quite prepare one for the severity of the ending.
 
  A humanizing moment of romantic awkwardness between Martha and Kyle would have packed twice the punch of the low-key "shocker" ending without compromising anything, but instead we get sly winks (such as Martha describing a middle-class house in a housing development as "gorgeous" and "fabulous") and bafflement (Martha, in church, suddenly spotlighted, presumably by the Lord himself).
 
  Scenes like these nudge "Bubble's" perspective from cold to condescending, especially given the parallels between the characters' lives and the actors' real ones.
 
  Shot by Soderbergh (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) as a series of compelling evidence snapshots, and set to a simple but powerful acoustic guitar theme by Robert Pollard, the movie is a quiet rebuff to what usually passes for naturalism in Hollywood movies.
 
  But despite its refreshingly straightforward style and compelling performers, the movie feels encased in an invisible, filmy membrane of its own. Soderbergh keeps his characters on one side of the wall and his audience on the other. As to which is living in the real world, I guess that's open to discussion.   

What will independent films look like in 30 years, and how will we watch them? Bubble , a devious and fascinating feature written by Coleman Hough and directed by Steven Soderbergh, provides a possible glimpse. The movie was shot on high-definition video for a budget of $1.6 million, and it's being released simultaneously in theaters, on DVD, and on cable television  an innovative strategy designed to inject a bite-size movie into the national bloodstream, instead of letting it languish in the usual snail-paced, platform oblivion.
What lends this distribution experiment a special resonance is that Bubble , which is set in small-town Ohio and West Virginia and features a cast of nonactors who drew their performances out of their own lives (every last one of them is terrific), seems to have emerged, in form and spirit, from an America that the movies usually leave out. I'm talking about the heartland fringe dwellers who live from paycheck to paycheck, and who've done it long enough to have forgotten how to imagine a future. Bubble, which follows the intersecting lives of three workers at a doll factory, is an authentic vision of wage-slave America, with a tinge of Diane Arbus-at-the-shopping-mall creepiness, but it's also a tricky and satisfying entertainment  a deadpan portrait of cultural anomie that turns into a casually credible murder mystery. All in 75 minutes. Of the idiosyncratic ''little'' movies that Soderbergh has made to clear his head (Full Frontal , Schizopolis ), this is the first that truly connects.
In the opening scene, Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), morosely overweight, with hair the color of Tang, rises at dawn in the tract house she shares with her ancient father, then drives down the block, as she does every day, to pick up Kyle (Dustin James Ashley), a pleasant young co-worker with a crooked shy grin. Arriving at the factory, they settle into the job of constructing plastic babies (we see the latex poured into body molds, the marble eyes popped into those big bald heads), and Soderbergh, working with clean, documentary-like precision, presents their job environment as a kind of winking purgatory: the living dead making the living dead. Martha, who gorges on junk carbs, eating away her misery, considers Kyle her best friend, but it's not clear if the feeling is entirely mutual. As they sit in the lunchroom, scarfing fast food, the atmosphere of casual disaffection is beautifully evoked, the blah flickers of talk delivered with compulsive American good cheer. A new co-worker arrives: Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), 20ish and pretty, who speaks in the same numb yet upbeat mode. She makes eye contact with Kyle and takes smoking breaks with him, and before long they arrange a date, with Martha, so passive and eager to please, babysitting for Rose's 2-year-old daughter.
What happens that evening is, in essence, the entire movie. It would be a crime to give a scrap of it away, but Soderbergh, sticking to the exotic desolation of these bleak ''whatever'' lives, finds a comic poetry in the blankness; he has made a minimalist domestic Executioner's Song . The acting in Bubble  is powerful enough to shame many of the performances in Hollywood movies. Debbie Doebereiner, who in real life manages a Kentucky Fried Chicken, makes Martha a touching gargoyle of sadness, a cipher stewing in her forlorn juice. Dustin James Ashley plays Kyle as the most quizzical and recessive of stoners, and Misty Dawn Wilkins makes Rose an everyday femme fatale, her pert and girlish charm concealing an economic desperation that has turned her into a petty criminal. Soderbergh stares at every one of them with open eyes: a shrewd affection and detachment that lends this little movie a big echo.

 There are a couple of ways to read the title of Steven Soderbergh's latest and willfully perverse excursion into experimentation, "Bubble." Set in a small Ohio town, the rigorously minimalist story involves three factory workers whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked, leading to an act of cataclysmic violence. Murder liberates the three from the bubble of their everyday existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated Mr. Soderbergh from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking.  The restlessly imaginative Mr. Soderbergh, whose Hollywood credentials include an Academy Award for "Traffic" and a handful of box-office hits, has never been a director to settle into a groove. Since making his feature debut in 1989 with "Sex, Lies and Videotape," he has ranged across genres and media, pursuing different visual and narrative idioms. He has purposely strayed off the mainstream with films like the critically maligned "Full Frontal," dipped into television (the undervalued "K Street") and found popular success with studio baubles like "Ocean's Eleven." Although "Bubble" has generated sizable notice for its unusual release — it opens in 32 theaters today and plays on the cable network HDNet Movies tonight, hitting DVD next week — in many respects it is just par for the Steven Soderbergh course.  This filmmaker has said that the genesis for "Bubble" was his curiosity about whether he could hack factory work, which may have been inspired by his experiences inside the studio machine. Whatever the case, "Bubble" is nothing if not independent from that machinery, having been bankrolled by HDNet Films, one of the companies owned by Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner. (The two also own some of the theaters, as well as the cable network, that will show the movie.) Written by Coleman Hough, who also wrote "Full Frontal," the script weds Mr. Soderbergh's germ of an idea about routinized labor both to some melodramatic contrivances (a triangle leads to jealousy leads to murder) and to the real-life experiences of its nonprofessional cast,  who all live either near or in Belpre, Ohio, where "Bubble" was shot.  The bare-bones story tracks what happens when a young single mother, Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), is hired at a doll factory, where she quickly intrudes on the friendship between Martha (Debbie Doebereiner)  and Martha's self-declared best friend, the much younger Kyle (Dustin James Ashley). The movie — which was shot using the same type of digital camera used for  the  "Star Wars" franchise — unfolds as a series of loosely strung-together episodes that have the flavor of real life, seen through a glass darkly. The mood is muted, almost depressed, and the naturalistic dialogue is as spare as the acoustic guitar fragments, composed by Robert Pollard in the melancholic key of Nick Drake, that bridge the narrative bits and pieces. Nothing much happens until, as is always the case in movies, something most definitely does.  Easier to admire than love, "Bubble" is a fascinating exercise that seems calculated to repel most audiences, which probably suits Mr. Soderbergh just fine. As he has with  many of his films, he shot the movie himself, working under his usual alias, Peter Andrews. Eschewing the loose shooting style he's favored in recent years, he presents this world as a series of exquisitely framed images, almost as if it were a series of tableaux vivants. The ordinariness of the faces inside those frames suggests that Mr. Soderbergh had been riffling through the collected works of photographers as varied as William Eggleston and Nan Goldin, both portraitists of everyday pain, while the milieu and dead-eye gaze show the influence of early Fassbinder. The results are beautiful and bleak.  When "Bubble" played at the New York Film Festival last year, it made an interesting contrast with "L'Enfant," the latest from the brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Belgian directors whose earlier films include "La Promesse." The Dardennes live in the area where they shoot their rigorously naturalistic fictions, which all  involve working-class or outsider characters engaged in furious life struggles. But whereas these films feel as if they were made from inside the worlds in which they are set, "Bubble" feels as if it were made from the outside looking in. Mr. Soderbergh is not a naturally warm director, and while that doesn't usually hurt his work, here his native chilliness makes it seem as if he were doing lab work rather than taking the measure of his fellow man.  Again, I'm not sure that Mr. Soderbergh would necessarily mind that take. And, indeed, "Bubble" is a test case of a kind, the first of six digital features that he will make for HDNet Films. These features will all be, like this one, site specific, shot outside major metropolitan areas using nonprofessional casts for what the director called, in an interview last September, "a sort of oblique angle on what it's like to be in America." The politics of that oblique angle come across as both overtly obvious and almost too subdued to bother mentioning. With its somnolent, alienated characters, its violence and a despairing late-act acknowledgment of guilt ("Oh, my God"), "Bubble" can easily be seen as a metaphor for a country that has been forcibly released from its own protective shell. Or not.  If Mr. Soderbergh was interested in floating such a critique, you wouldn't know it from the DVD for "Bubble." Among the disappointing extras included with it is an on-camera interview with the director that is almost entirely devoid of interest, along with an unfortunate faux-documentary in which Ms. Hough, the screenwriter, tries to make casual with the principal cast and comes across like a visiting dignitary. Also on tap are the original interviews with the lead actors by the casting director Carmen Cuba and, best of all, a brilliant trailer for the movie. Consisting solely of still images of doll parts in various states of assembly and decay, without a single human face or whiff of story, it distills the movie's creepy vibe in perfect miniature. The trailer ends with the words "Another Steven Soderbergh Experience," which really says it all.  "Bubble" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some crude language and some oblique violence.

"Ocean's Eleven" and "Twelve" must have lit a fire under Steven Soderbergh to direct a film that is, in spirit, far from Hollywood. In financially depressed Ohio, the lives of three doll factory workers are overturned. Soderbergh uses a non-pro cast to deftly sketch the dullness of a mid-American burg normal enough for a Stephen King horror extravaganza. Here, an unmotivated murder, instead of stirring emotions, unveils a frightening moral vacuum. The stuff of limited release and TV sales, this likeable if unexciting little tale could swing Euro arthouse audiences with its sly humor and commentary on the U.S. 
The first 50 minutes are devoted to building up the small-town, empty-pocket atmosphere through well-chosen detail. Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), a plump red-haired woman in her 30s, lives with and cares for her aging father (Omar Cowan). She is one of five employees in a factory that mass-produces plastic baby dolls.
Martha has developed a connection with taciturn young Kyle (Dustin Ashley). Their lunchtime conversations are so numbingly bland they're almost funny. She puts more stock in their "friendship" than he does, and when the pretty Rose (Misty Wilkins) is hired as a temp worker, Martha instantly goes on the defensive.
Compared with the unflinching dullness of her co-workers, Rose drives in an extra gear. When she goes to clean a woman's house, she scandalizes Martha by taking a bath in the absent lady's bathtub.
She admits to Kyle that she was a rebel in high school and ran away from home at 15. She also has a 2-year-old daughter, the fruit of an unhappy relationship with her ex-b.f. Jake (K. Smith).
Rose asks Martha to baby-sit while she goes out on a date. The scene in Rose's cramped living room develops with off-handed horror as Martha realizes Rose's date is with Kyle. Rose and Kyle's evening unfolds with ritual banality, but when Rose gets home, she finds Jake waiting for her. They have a shouting match in front of a terrified Martha, who is further insulted when she tries to talk to Rose about it, and Rose tells her to mind her own business.
The next morning, Rose is found strangled on her living room floor. Neither the police inspector (Decker Moody) nor the audience is long left in doubt about whodunit. The last 20 minutes of the film nevertheless have a curious fascination, as everyone tries to figure out why the crime was committed.
Not even the murderer can come up with a plausible answer, which seems to be precisely the point. The final shots of smiling, empty-faced dolls -- another classic horror image -- conjure up nothing so much as a gaping void, a "bubble" far from the real world.
The three principals, all non-professionals from the Ohio location where the film was shot, are well cast and skilfully directed. There is little to suggest an emotional spark capable of filling their loneliness or bridging their isolation. Even the relationships between Martha and her father, Kyle and his mother (Laurie Lee), and Rose and her daughter are perfunctory and unstated. One of the sources of the pic's subtle humor is the actors' under-reaction to dramatic events, a case where their natural deadpan, particularly Doebereiner's wide-eyed sameness, probably has the jump on an expressive, trained actor.
The dialogue has a pleasing low-key realism that complements Soderbergh�s understated direction, though one can sense a firm hand always guiding the straightforward story. Lenser Peter Andrews (Soderbergh�s pseudonym) goes for even lighting and simple framing that underline the ironic charm of the ultra-familiar. Editor Mary Ann Bernard (also Soderbergh) delivers a smoothly cut film with no dead time.

The circumstances surrounding the genesis and delivery of Steven Soderbergh 's new film Bubble shot on hi-def as the first of six low-budget experiments and then distributed simultaneously to theaters, cable, and DVDwill doubtless constitute the why of it, as the movie itself waits mopily for attention like an ugly child. "Consumers," the press kit says, "will truly have their choice of how" to see Bubble ; nowhere in the backstory does anyone ask "whether." Of course, we should care only about what's on-screen, and Soderbergh, as adept at exploiting his Hollywood  cachet for low-budget purposes as Gus Van Sant , should know that. Shot in a depressed West Virginia  sub-suburbia of trailer homes, aging minor industries, and fast food, and utilizing only nonprofessional actors, Bubble  is Soderbergh vying for a local purity he doesn't have rights to. Which isn't, alone, too terrible, even if the movie strives for the back-to-the-soil integrity of Springsteen's harmonica albums but seems afraid to bare its soul. Is minimalism as easy as Soderbergh thinks it is? Bubble  seems deadly accurate in its capture of heartland small talk, but it's also spectacularly enervated, an affected zombie diorama of low-rent American life that somehow doesn't mock or condescend to its characters. Fine, but what does  it do?
Hard to say: Soderbergh, an academic-class Southerner, keeps a stranglehold on his working-class people; no one in Bubble ever cracks a joke, or taps a toe. His launchpad is a sweet and thoroughly exploited metaphor: a six-man doll factory we see at work in fascinating detail. (Casting rubber torsos, airbrushing lips, squeezing the bald heads grotesquely so eyeballs can be popped intry and resist the radiant vision of a tabletop filled with chubby baby legs.)
Coleman Hough 's screenplay is so sparse that the machinery and disassembled plastic infants could come off as a tumid flourish, but it's the movie's most disquieting and beautiful idea. Working there are Kyle (Dustin James Ashley ), a taciturn twentysomething whose only glint of individualism is the joint he secretly smokes in his bedroom, and Martha (Debbie Doebereiner ), a motherly, obese middle-aged redhead seemingly content with her blue-collar situation. Carpooling, the two bond by way of ritual and idle chat, until the shop hires a new hand, Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), a young, willowy single mom who, we're led to suspect by Martha's watchful eyes, represents a threat to the co-workers' stasis.
There is, eventually, a crime and an investigation, by which time either we are charmed by the metronomic textures or have given up hope. Soderbergh's restrained, near motionless style (he shot and cut the film under pseudonyms) is never as arid as the relationships; the three stars are all perfectly naturalistic, but their roles are too bloodless and their patter too dry. The title's "bubble" may well be the swelling chaos, heading for a burst, underneath the relentless flyover politeness (the "sure will, huh-huh!" inflections used for yuks in Fargo  , four states away). But that equation is cheap, and Bubble 's expression of class inequity, despite Martha's awestruck tour through a McMansion, never comes to a head. Thrifty but also skimpy at 73 minutes, Soderbergh's movie ambitiously focuses on movie-rare Americans (never in this country has a film occupied itself so steadfastly with someone like Doebereiner), but never wonders what makes them tick.
