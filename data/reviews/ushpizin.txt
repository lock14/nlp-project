         "Ushpizin" is one of those films that has a direct line to the Almighty. When a character says "we need a miracle," it's only a matter of time until not one but several take place. But what's especially noteworthy about this popular Israeli film is that the greatest miracle of all is that it got made in the first place.
 
  A gently humorous fable about the power of faith and the possibility of change, "Ushpizin" not only takes place in Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, it was filmed with that media-shy group's cooperation and followed religious law at all times.
 


         






    Israeli films have dealt with that country's haredi
 community before, but, as with Amos Gitai's "Kadosh," their view is usually a bleak one. "Ushpizin," by contrast, is much sunnier, so much so that it struck a chord with the Israeli public and won the equivalent of the Academy Award for its star, Shuli Rand.
 
  Rand also wrote the script, taking inspiration from his own life. Once a successful Israeli movie star, he left acting in 1996 to became a baal teshuvah
, someone who returns to the faith. Here he costars with his real-life nonprofessional wife in part because of Orthodox strictures against close personal contact between nonmarried members of the opposite sex.
 
  The film is set during Sukkot, a fall holiday when it is traditional for Jews to spend part of their days in temporary wooden buildings called sukkahs. It's also considered a blessing to have visitors share the holiday with you; the Aramaic word for them, ushpizin
, translates as "holy guests."
 
  When "Ushpizin" opens, Moshe Bellanga (Rand) and his wife, Malli (Michal Bat Sheva Rand), relative newcomers to a Hasidic community, are too synagogue-mouse poor to be able to celebrate the holiday at all. But then Moshe remembers what a rabbi once said: "If something is lacking, it was either not prayed for, or not prayed for enough." So Moshe throws himself into ecstatic prayer and soon enough spending money and a sukkah both almost miraculously come his way.
 
  This absolute belief in the deity as determiner of all things is "Ushpizin's" bedrock. Lines such as "We put our trust in God," "That's what God wanted," "God will not forsake us" and "Everything is God's plan" are constantly on its characters' lips, but director Gidi Dar has kept the tone so genial that the film never seems overbearing.
 
  The couple's hope for guests also gets answered, but in a most unexpected way. Showing up at the sukkah are Eliyahu Scorpio (Shaul Mizrahi, a Harry Dean Stanton look-alike) and his pal Yossef (Ilan Ganani), a pair of escaped convicts who have a connection to Moshe's shady pre-Orthodox life.
 
  Obviously, these guests are not exactly pillars of Talmudic rectitude, and though the convicts wonder just how sincere Moshe's change of life is, Moshe and Malli treat them as part of God's plan, as a test from the Almighty. A comedic clash between these oil-and-water lifestyles is inevitable, and "Ushpizin" works up some amiably funny moments as the Almighty's intentions for these people are slowly revealed.
 
  A respectful comedy whose interest for most audiences will be part anthropological, "Ushpizin" walks an interesting line. While it only glancingly refers to some of ultra-orthodoxy's more controversial elements — the childless Malli suggests her husband divorce her to marry someone potentially more fertile — the film idealizes the community in an entertaining way.
 
  "Ushpizin" was approved at the script stage by actor-writer Rand's rabbi, who felt it could diminish the tension that sometimes exists in Israel between secular and religious elements, and in this it seems to have succeeded. Which is kind of a miracle all by itself.

 The Israeli film "Ushpizin" is groundbreaking on more than one count. It is a rare collaboration between secular and ultra-Orthodox Israelis and one of the first movies filmed in the insular Jerusalem neighborhood Mea Shearim with ultra-Orthodox actors.  Its warmhearted vision of marriage among Hasidic Jews is also radically different from the depiction of anguished female subservience to patriarchal authority portrayed in movies like Boaz Yakin's "A Price Above Rubies" and Amos Gitai's "Kadosh." That's because the screenwriter, Shuli Rand, and his wife, Michal Bat Sheva Rand, who play a beleaguered married couple, are themselves ultra-Orthodox.  Mr. Rand, who won an Israeli Film Academy Award for his performance, was formerly a secular Jew. With permission from his rabbi, he teamed up with the director, Gidi Dar, an old friend, to make the movie.  The Rands' characters, Moshe and Malli Bellanga, are a devout but childless couple struggling to make ends meet. Both are intensely emotional. A robust woman with a temperament as fiery as her husband's, Ms. Rand's Malli may follow the patriarchal rules, but she's the furthest thing from a wilting handmaiden bowing and scraping before her master.  "Ushpizin" (the title, roughly translated from Aramaic, means "holy guests" and is pronounced OOSH-piz-in) reflects Mr. Rand's secular-to-Hasidic history by imagining that Moshe's wild past suddenly catches up with him. And the scraps of information revealed about his younger days suggest that he was once a formidable hell-raiser.  As the story begins, Moshe and Malli are wringing their hands in anxiety. It's the eve of Sukkot, a seven-day religious holiday celebrating the fall harvest. The Bellangas have neither the money to build a sukkah, a tentlike structure occupied by holiday celebrants during the festivities, nor the money to buy food for the weeklong feast. Both worry that the cause of their poverty is Malli's infertility after five years of marriage, and both pray continuously and loudly for God's help.  Lo and behold, miracles arrive. A donation of $1,000 from a yeshiva is slipped under their door, and a friend of Moshe's gives them a sukkah. What appears to be another miracle occurs when Moshe's old friend Eliyahu (Shaul Mizrahi) knocks on their door, accompanied by Yossef (Ilan Ganani), a goofy sidekick with a shaved head.  The guests arrive just in time for dinner. Chowing down like famished dogs, they proceed to eat and drink the Bellangas out of house and home. But the hosts are thrilled. The appearance of guests during a holiday celebrating hospitality must be another sign of divine beneficence. And when Eliyahu and Yossef make no signs of leaving, the hosts adjust their thinking and gratefully accept the boorish behavior of the men who came to dinner as a divine test with a reward at the end.  Unbeknownst to the Bellangas, Eliyahu and Yossef have just escaped from prison and are actually hiding from the police. Eventually, the guests go too far. After demanding money from Malli to buy meat, they set up an outdoor grill, blast pop music on a portable sound system and dance around wildly, incensing the neighbors.  Stylistically "Ushpizin" belongs to a classic tradition of raucous Yiddish comedy that is easy to enjoy if taken lightly. At the same time, it sustains a double vision of ultra-Orthodox life. To outsiders, the Bellangas' blind trust and constant praying make them look like patsies exploited by buffoonish, unscrupulous crooks. To the faithful it is more likely to be taken as a joyful affirmation of unshakable faith, humorously exaggerated, of course, but an affirmation nonetheless.  "Ushpizin" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and mild violence.  Ushpizin  

Groundbreaking in its sympathetic insider depiction of Jewish ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem, "Ushpizin" reps the first collaborative effort between Israel's religious and secular communities, spearheaded by thesp-scripter Shuli Rand. An enjoyable seriocomic tale of a poor couple whose holiday-time miracle becomes a test of faith, pic received the critics' award at the Jerusalem Fest, plus best actor for Rand at the Israeli equivalent of the Oscars. An obvious winner for Jewish fests, pic's genial warmth never feels overtly preachy, and could easily transfer to arthouse play on both U.S. coasts.
The ultra-orthodox don't go to the movies, let alone participate in productions, so secular helmer Gidi Dar's coup of not only using religious actors but shooting in their normally closed community was entirely due to Rand's participation, with the agreement of his rabbi. Stipulations on release included no screenings on the Sabbath; many religious Jews illegally downloaded pic from the web rather than go to the cinema at all, leading to a rabbinical e-plea that all felonious perps should send money to the production company as compensation.
Rand plays Moshe, an impoverished ultra-Orthodox man struggling to make ends meet. Penniless on the eve of the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot, he goes to the local yeshiva charity but is told there are no more funds to go around. His wife Mali (Rand's real-life wife Michal Bat Sheva Rand) accuses Moshe of not standing up for himself, and they both fervently pray for a miracle.
The miracle comes in the unexpected arrival of $1,000, left over from the yeshiva fund. For Moshe and Mali this is a gift from God, possibly also signaling an end to her years of barrenness. Now they can construct the sukkah


, the tradi-tional open-air holiday structure where religious Jews have meals and welcome guests ("ushpizin" is Aramaic for guests).
Out of the blue arrives Eliahu (Shaul Mizrahi), a colleague of Moshe's from his wild secular days, with the restless Yosef (Ilan Gannai) in tow. Seeing this as another divine gift, Moshe and Mali invite the newcomers to stay in their sukkah


, without knowing they're on the lam from a prison day-release program. Despite their guests' slov-enly, outrageous behavior, the couple lay on the hospitality, believing they're being tested by God.
Once the guests are introduced, Rand's script doesn't really know what to do with them, forcing him to find a quick and tepid solution. At times teetering on the brink of sentimentality, helmer Gidi Dar prevents it from spilling over, thanks to his warmth for these characters and their Yiddishkeit
 humor.
Like Moshe himself, Shuli Rand was a secular Jew who became religious. "Ushpizin" is his labor of love, and obviously a defense of the ultra-Orthodox community; presenting it in a positive light brought him back to the screen after nine years away. In a genial but firm riposte to the depiction of Orthodox women in pics such as "A Price Above Rubies," Rand consciously makes Mali a vital partner in their loving relationship: the rabbi (Daniel Dayan) pointedly tells Moshe, "You should make your wife happy. That's the most important thing."
As a couple, Shuli and Michal's ease with each other and evident affection beautifully translates onto the screen -- they have fun together, not something usually associated with the ultra-Orthodox. Religious strictures forbade him from performing with a woman other than his wife, and although Michal Bat Sheva Rand never acted before, she winningly conveys Mali's contempo sense of humor along with her tough intelligence.
Dar makes superb use of the location shooting, giving the courtyard where the sukkahs 
are erected the feeling of an old-time Hollywood stage set which in turn fills in for an entire world. Music incorporates catchy klezmer melodies but occasionally threatens to overdramatize.

Ushpizin  mines a vein of Jewish humor not often seen in the movies. The mode is religious parable, the protagonists are Hasidim, and there's even a seasonal hook. This warmhearted Israeli feature, shown earlier this year at Tribeca, opens in time for Sukkota harvest festival during which observant Jews move from their home into the rustic temporary shelter of a sukkahand that's what it's about. The title, which could be translated as "holy guests," alludes to the prayer in which Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, and David are invited into one's frond-festooned hut.
The actor Shuli Rand , who wrote Ushpizin 's screenplay as well as starred in it, is himself a nouveau Hasid, making his return to the screen after an eight-year absence and with the blessing of his rabbi. Rand and his wife, Michal Bat-Sheva Rand, play Moshe and Malli, a penniless scholar and his ostensibly barren wifeshe's never acted before, but their affectionately bickering rapport is infectious. Too poor to afford a sukkah, the couple pray for a miracle and when they believe that they've been granted one, having been given someone else's sukkah, they respond with comic enthusiasmwelcoming a pair of unexpected guests, who slink in with their hands covering their heads.
Unbeknownst to Malli, her pious Moshe has what might be termed a history of violence. These ushpizin  are not biblical patriarchs but two scurvy criminals on the lam, one of whom was Moshe's buddy in his earlier incarnation. The guests are pleased to accept the couple's hospitality and more; partying in the sukkah, they torment the pious neighborhood by blasting their boombox (as if the secular could ever so bully the religious in Jerusalem ). Meanwhile, Moshe and Malli imagine that God has given them a test. That one of the "holy guests" is called Eliyahu is a clue; his biblical namesake has a long career in Jewish legend making house calls in disguise.
As directed by Gidi Dar, Ushpizin  has a disarming folk quality. Moshe pleads, Tevye-like, with God to help him keep his temper when the ushpizin trash his home and use the Sukkot esrog  (a fertility charm for which Moshe has paid a small fortune) to make a salad. Although this earthy I-Thou relationship is never cloyingly cozy, it's abundantly clear that the movie's ending proves the existence of Moshe's deityat least to Moshe.
