No literature was harmed in the making of "The Kite Runner," because, to be brutally frank, the beloved best-selling novel on which the movie is based doesn't qualify. The story of an Afghan émigré coming to terms with the sins of his childhood, Khaled Hosseini's book is a gripping fictional memory play that devolves into a human rights potboiler, with enough melodrama, coincidence, and guilt to make D.W. Griffith blush and Oprah swoon.
That's all right - the movies run on melodrama and they always have. Even at its most tortuously plotted, the book has the sentimental sweep of cinema; it opens up like a film as you read it. An actual big-screen adaptation seems a little redundant.
But here it is anyway, scripted by David Benioff ("Troy") and handsomely directed by Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball," "Finding Neverland"), whose way with a narrative is more skilled than Hosseini's but just as earnest. "Kite Runner" the movie is an honorable, middlebrow affair - a solid double - that replicates the strengths and shamelessness of the book. The first half is an incisive portrait of a Kabul boyhood, the second a spiraling series of convenient events.
Perhaps the nerviest aspect, at least from the multiplex perspective, is that it asks mainstream American audiences to attend to a tale lacking Hollywood stars and English-language dialogue, one that takes place in a country known to many only from misunderstood headlines. Zekiria Ebrahimi plays the central character, Amir, as a young boy, growing up rich and risk-averse while his best friend, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), the son of the family servant, takes all the chances. Ethnic and class divisions are alluded to, but this is mostly a uni versal tale of youth - an Afghan "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Like that classic, "Kite Runner" has an all-knowing father figure: Homayoun Ershadi as Amir's Baba, gruff and Westernized, spitting contempt at the Islamic priests. It also has a combination magic child/sacred martyr in Hassan, who takes on a heavy load of abuse, especially after the citywide kite-flying competition of the title.
Forster films this with soaring digital camerawork that follows the paths of the kites as they battle aloft: The sequence begins in the sky and ends in a squalid back alley with boyhood sickeningly coming to an end. The delicate play of betrayal, guilt, and projection is dealt with more clumsily than in the book - a camera can only photograph the outside of repression - and our sympathy with Amir is tested further by the blank-faced coldness of the young actor playing him.
On the other hand, the movie sketches a smart and subtle portrait of Kabul before the fall - before the Soviet tanks rolled in, before the Taliban took over, back when Afghanistan's soul belonged to more than its mullahs. Amir's father, confident in his hip '70s suits, is an embodiment of that soul, as is the father's friend, the more quietly observant Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub from "Crash," giving the strongest performance in the movie).
"The Kite Runner" re-creates Amir's and Baba's harrowing escape from the invading Russians over the Khyber Pass and comes to ground in central California. Amir (now played by Khalid Abdalla, one of the terrorists in "United 93") graduates from college as a wannabe novelist and Baba pumps gas - another poke at our Western complacency, inviting us to see the backstory every time we pull up to the pump. The scenes in America have a mawkish but satisfying comic ordinariness to them: the drama of learning to fit in.
Amir needs absolution, though. In an odd way, "The Kite Runner" parallels another current book-to-film property, "Atonement." Both films wonder how (and if) youthful wrongs can be forgiven, but while "Atonement" finds an answer in art and austerity, Hosseini's tale is more literal: the now-married Amir plunges back into Afghanistan and confronts the Taliban's crimes in an effort to come to grips with his own misdeeds.
This is the angst-ridden daydream of every émigré - to return home and get it right, earning love and respect from those who stayed (in this case Said Taghmaoui as Amir's cynical driver). Where the book turned overwrought to the point of masochism, though, Forster pulls back, easing up on most of the coincidences except the big one involving the return of a bully from Amir's youth.
I'm of two minds about this. A movie that held on to all the breathless tearjerkery of the novel would probably have to star Bette Davis as Amir, but as amended by Forster the story is now touching and somewhat dull. The movie glances at the real horrors of a theocratic dictatorship - the public stonings, the private power-mongering - but only on the way to soothing a fictional dilemma.
That's a loss. The symbolic self-flagellation Hosseini puts his hero through could make a great, crazy movie about guilt and homeland, assimilation and ethnic authenticity, but you'd need a less cautious cook to make it - one willing to break some eggs. "The Kite Runner" will be loved by many moviegoers for its taste and humanity, but for all the places Forster takes us he doesn't show us anything we haven't seen.


Few Americans will recognize any of the actors in The Kite Runner , and anyone unfamiliar with the Dari language must lean on subtitles. That's not a bad thing. ''Foreignness'' is the great leveler in this pretty good adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's pretty good 2003 best-seller. Here's a case where those who have read the book and those who haven't are on the same playing field  the same kite-flying field.
As in Atonement , the themes are a writer's education and a guilt-edged destiny shaped by a childhood act of betrayal. This time, the youthful offender is Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi), a privileged Kabul kid. Back in the days before the oppressive Soviets invaded Afghanistan and the repressive Taliban followed, Amir abandoned his boyhood servant and pal, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), in Hassan's moment of terrible brutalization; soon after, Amir and his father emigrated to America. So adult repentance involves a return to a homeland in ruin  and, at one point, a violent showdown with a mad mullah.
It's a big saga  and not all of the book fits on the screen. (How could it?) But the challenge invigorates Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland ), a filmmaker who in the past has approached his material like he's examining a specimen from another planet. (The streamlined script is by David Benioff.) In making a movie about the hot mess of Afghan history, a sense of reserve turns out to be a useful tool for peace.

 Much like the best-selling novel on which it’s based, “The Kite Runner” tells the story of an Afghan refugee who, long after arriving in America, sifts through memories of his cosseted childhood, his emotionally remote father, his devoted best friend, the kites they flew and the stories they shared. The back of my paperback copy of this Khaled Hosseini  novel is sprinkled with words like “powerful” and “haunting” and “riveting” and “unforgettable.” It’s a good guess that this film will be rolled around in a similarly large helping of lard.  There’s another word on the back of my copy: “genuine.” The portrait of Afghan culture broadly painted by its narrator, a 38-year-old novelist known as Amir (played in the film by the Scottish-born Khalid Abdalla), certainly seems like the real deal, a sense of authenticity underscored by the book’s evocation of the Afghan diaspora in America, its descriptions of traditions and rituals and the numerous italicized words like “Kocheh-Morgha” (“Chicken Bazaar”) and “Shirini-khori” (“ ‘Eating of the Sweets’ ceremony”).  That said, it is difficult to believe in the authenticity of any book (and its author) in which a born and bred Afghan  narrator asks of the Taliban — as this one does in June 2001 — “Is it as bad as I hear?” David Benioff’s clumsy screenplay doesn’t broadcast its political naïveté as openly, but only because the filmmakers seem to assume that unlike the book’s readers, the movie audience doesn’t care about such matters.   Mr. Benioff gestures in the direction of Communists and mullahs, the Soviet invaders and the Taliban insurgents, but none of these players figure into the story in any meaningful fashion. The director Marc Forster, following the script’s  lead, scrupulously avoids politics and history — there are no causes or positions, just villains and horrors — and instead offers us a succession of atmospheric, realistic landscapes, colorful sights and smiling boys. And kites. Lots and lots of bobbing, darting, high-flying kites.  Like the recent film version of Ian McEwan’s novel “Atonement,” another story ignited by the destructive behavior of a pubescent child, “The Kite Runner” presents a world informed by a variant of original sin. In both, a child’s damaging words and deeds give way to — and seem to foreshadow and somehow even to incite  — the larger violence of war. The two stories register very differently, both on the page and on screen, yet what’s curious is how each presents childhood as an already corrupted state that is redeemed only by adult grace. In these stories war becomes a kind of cleansing agent for the destructive child, who, after enduring hardships, matures into a properly contrite adult (and a fiction writer to boot).  It takes a while for that contrition to surface in “The Kite Runner.” First the adult Amir has to conjure up a leisurely flashback during which his 12-year-old self (Zekiria Ebrahimi) rushes through the dust and the exotica — past the woman in a burka and the  severed animal heads — pausing to read, write and fly kites. He worships his gruff father, Baba (Homayoun Ershadi), a businessman who swills alcohol and dismisses the mullahs as “monkeys.” Amir, in turn, is adored by the illiterate servant boy Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), whose father has worked for Baba his entire life. Amir loves his younger friend in his selfish fashion, but because Baba favors Hassan (if not enough to educate the boy), Amir  also betrays him.  Mr. Forster, who previously directed “Monster’s Ball” and “Finding Neverland,” has been soundly defeated by “The Kite Runner.” Despite the film’s far-flung locations (it was shot primarily  in China), there is remarkably little of visual interest here; the setups are banal, and the scenes lack tension, which no amount of editing can provide. With the exception of Mr. Ershadi, whom art-house audiences may remember from Abbas  Kiarostami’s “Taste of Cherry,” it also lacks credible performances. The two lead child actors, both nonprofessionals, are predictably appealing, but only because they’re children. Unlike Mr. Kiarostami, who has a genius for translating the natural rhythms of nonprofessional performers to the screen, who siphons real life and bottles it, Mr. Forster never makes you believe in these children or their woes.  In both novel and film form, “The Kite Runner” recounts a simple yet shrewd story about that favorite American pastime: self-improvement. Amir’s childhood mistake isn’t a careless juvenile offense; it’s a human stain that must be scrubbed out through self-abnegation, confession and personal transformation. Yet, watching this film, you are  left to wonder whom precisely is all this suffering for — is it for Amir? Hassan? Afghanistan? Or do Hassan and the story’s other sad children — especially those hollow-eyed boys and girls glimpsed during the preposterous climax in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan — suffer because it’s possible to package other people’s pain and turn it into a commercial diversion? It’s no surprise that for all its foreign trappings, “The Kite Runner” tells the same old comforting story. We wouldn’t have it any other way.    “The Kite Runner” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is a discreetly shot if entirely unnecessary scene of a child’s rape and an extended bloody fight involving punches and a slingshot.

An Afghan emigre returns to his homeland to redeem his sins -- and those of his father -- in "The Kite Runner."�With careful nurturing, helmer Marc Forster's richly detailed screen translation of Khaled Hosseini's beloved bestseller should reach beyond the book's many fans. Nuanced perfs and standout production design convey story in cinematic terms, preserving the narrative's emotional power and historical sweep as it spans continents and decades. While the largely unknown cast and subtitled dialogue may present a marketing challenge, they also create a feeling of authenticity in this poignant, intimate epic, which should attract a strong following among discerning audiences.
Paramount Vantage, which is rolling out "The Kite Runner" under its Paramount Classics label, has delayed the pic's release by six weeks owing to a rape scene featuring young Afghan thesp Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada. New release date -- Dec. 14, after the end of the boy's school year -- is a response to expressed fears that he could be attacked for his participation in the scene.
Deft adaptation by David Benioff ("25th Hour," "Troy") condenses cast of characters and events, but incorporates nearly all the novel's major moments, while the dialogue, much of it lifted directly from the page, finds a natural balance between English and Dari delivery. Most noticeable change -- the absence of a first-person narrator -- serves to make the visuals an equal purveyor of narrative information.
Central idea -- that no matter what a person's done in the past, there's an opportunity for a second chance -- provides a universally resonant emotional hook for protag's journey from cowardice to courage.
Pic is divided into three parts, with the longest piece outlining the character's youth in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. Fascinating midsection, set in California's expat community during the late 1980s, gets somewhat short shrift compared to the book. Final segment, also much abridged, skips ahead 12 years to bring his odyssey full circle.
Tale begins in San Francisco in 2000, as writer Amir (Khalid Abdalla) is summoned by phone to the Pakistani sickbed of his father's friend. Latter's enigmatic promise, "There's a way to be good again," speaks to the younger man's long-simmering sense of guilt.
Cut to cosmopolitan Kabul in 1978, where privileged 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and his faithful companion/servant, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), run freely through the Afghan capital. Contrasts in their dress, dwellings and vocabulary clearly evoke the difference between city's affluent Pashtun majority and denigrated Hazara minority.
A sensitive only child whose mother died in childbirth, Amir yearns for the affection of his emotionally distant father, Baba (Homayoun Ershadi, "A Taste of Cherry"), and feels jealous whenever Hassan earns his praise. He relates more easily to empathetic family friend Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub, "Crash").
Kabul's annual kite-fighting competition offers an opportunity for Amir to earn Baba's respect, but also sets the stage for the lad's failure to rescue Hassan, who's brutalized by neighborhood bullies (in a scene not quite as explicit as it is in the book). Amir's sense of shame soon leads to a second, more definitive betrayal.
It's this shame that haunts Amir over the years, catalyzing a dangerous journey to Taliban-controlled Kabul in 2000. Here, in stark contrast to the melting pot of cultures and colors of the 1970s, the grim, gray production design forcefully depicts the devastation wrought over the years. Broken buildings rot in disrepair, with no vegetation to be seen. Cripples sell their artificial legs to feed their families, and public executions take place in the soccer stadium.
The climactic surprises that await Amir in Kabul, which were already credulity-straining in the book, remain so in the film, but fast-paced action helps suspend disbelief. Epilogue provides a satisfying conclusion to pic's focus on family connections.
Cogent production design is matched by convincing perfs from the entire cast, all of Middle Eastern ancestry. As the adult Amir, Abdalla ("United 93"), in his first leading role, creates a sympathetic, multidimensional character that remains believable even in the most melodramatic situations. Ershadi's Baba is not the great bear of a man described in the book, but he successfully projects the character's outsize personality and physical courage. Toub makes wise Khan the perfect foil.
Remarkable nonpro child thesps Ebrahimi and Mahmoodzada perfectly embody the ethnic differences and class tensions between Amir and Hassan, as well as the chemistry of brotherhood.
Pic's emphasis on Amir's early relationships leaves relatively little screen time for his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and her parents, characters who further illustrate Afghan traditions of honor and pride.
Shot on location in the Western Chinese desert that borders Afghanistan, the film marks the first use of China to portray another country. Ace widescreen lensing by Roberto Schaefer makes aerial shots of swooping, feinting kites pic's leitmotif.
Only clunker among tech credits is Alberto Iglesias' overly insistent score.

Kites fly high over the San Francisco Bay  and Kabul  (OK, China), but not much else soars in Marc Forster s flaccid adaptation of Khaled Hosseini s vivid 2002 novel, which covers three decades of Afghanistan s misery under serial totalitarian rule. Arriving on the heels of Atonement , The Kite Runner  tells a parallel, if far more potboiling tale of family secrets, betrayal, cowardice, and making amends. Hosseini is an instinctive and unpretentious storyteller whose direct prose, transparent plot symmetries, and exotic locales have made him a middlebrow unifier of reading publics high and low. Add to all that his tactful tiptoeing around the United States role in arming the Taliban  in Afghanistan, and youve got yourself a runaway American best-seller.
So youd think Forster, who made the admirably strange and lively Stranger Than Fiction , would seize the day and all manner of audience demographics with the colorful movie equivalent of a page-turner. Instead, armed with a capably hands-off screenplay by David Benioff , hes made a drama as bland and beige as its tasteful palette, whose pacing wouldnt look out of place in the Sunday-night slot on PBS . It doesnt help that the central character Amir, an expatriate Afghani writer, is played with dour lack of expression by Egyptian-born actor Khalid Abdalla , more forcefully seen taking down that doomed plane in Paul Greengrass s United 93 . True, Amir has a dark secret for which he cant forgive himself, but thats no reason to mope around Northern California like Eeyore on a rainy day, especially when your first novel has just come out, youve just married the lovely and supportive Soraya (Atossa Leoni ), and even your hard-to-please father (Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi , who played the would-be suicide in Abbas Kiarostami s A Taste of Cherry ) has come around nicely.
Indeed, The Kite Runner  only wakes up, and then just a little, on its trips back to Kabul, where the close friendship between two motherless little boysthe privileged, secular Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi ) and his houseboys saintly son, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada )withers on the vine due to jealousy, a long-buried secret, and a predatory act that underscores the internal ethnic frictions that plagued Afghanistan even before Russian tanks rolled in. You cant fault Forsters efforts to honor his subjectthe dialogue is in Dari, an Afghan dialect, and the boys, both played by kids found in Kabul, make a soulfully appealing pair. But the care he has taken to respect local culture drains even the final actwhen Amir returns to Kabul to atone for his sins and gets beaten within an inch of his lifeof the novels propulsive momentum.
I wont deny that, along with Michael Winterbottom s In This World  and a slew of documentaries about the plight of child soldiers, laborers, amputees, and refugees, The Kite Runner  grieves potently for the most vulnerable casualties of our savagely warring world. But the movies most powerful drama has unfolded off-screen, with Paramount  pulling all possible strings to get the boys who play young Amir and Hassan out of Afghanistan before the mullahs get to them. Though the publicity value of their arrival in the United Arab Emirates  the week before the films release will be lost on no one, I doubt that the studios efforts were cynically motivated or that fears of reprisal by the boys families were unfounded.
The threat to the boys well-being and the plot of The Kite Runner  turns on two unspeakable acts of homosexual child exploitation. The twisted sexuality that lies beneath most forms of extreme fundamentalism makes both the novel and the movie brave, if weirdly partial, in telling it like it is. In the teeth of the worst that the Taliban can do, Amir experiences, of all things, a religious conversion; for a different response, see the excellent upcoming Persepolis  . And like Hosseinis novel, the movie is all too circumspect about Americas role in making Afghanistan the mess it is today. For that, see Mike Nichols s upcoming, and far more entertaining, Charlie Wilson s War .
