At first glance, it might seem as though the twin filmmaking brothers Michael and Mark Polish (both write, while Michael directs and Mark acts) have scuttled their inclination toward oddball delights as seen in their previous films, Twin Falls Idaho
, Jackpot
, and Northfork
. True, there are only upright Americans in The Astronaut Farmer
 and none of the conjoined twins, professional karaoke singers, or wandering angels here that populated their earlier work. Yet, even though the Polishes� purview has downshifted from damaged exotics to grassroots individuals, their perspective remains refreshingly skewed toward the unusual and uncommon. The Astronaut Farmer
 could almost be a relic from the golden age of Hollywood, an inspirational drama about staying true to one�s hopes and ideals no matter the social, economic, or emotional cost. �If we don�t have our dreams, we have nothing,� goes the story�s underlying refrain � a mantra that might sound like pure cheese were it not delivered with such note-perfect gravity by Thornton, who stars as Charlie Farmer. A former astronaut, Charlie quit NASA�s program when tragedy struck on his family�s farm back in Texas (New Mexico filled in for Texas during the shoot). However, having always wanted to go into space, Charlie has taken his can-do spirit and built a rocket ship in an empty grain silo on his property. With his 15-year-old son, Shepherd (Theriot), as his one-man ground-control operation, Charlie eventually blasts off, much to the government�s chagrin. The feds don�t seem to want anyone with a modified John Deere and contraband rocket fuel to steal their thunder. Plus, the anxieties dredged up by our modern age of terrorism lend an extra edge of suspicion and confrontation to the government�s interference in Charlie�s affairs. Although The Astronaut Farmer
 feels something like a throwback to a gentler time, what makes the film work is its utter sincerity and perfect command of the overall tone. Madsen, as Charlie�s wife, Audie, is equally disarming as the emotional ballast that keeps Charlie and their family afloat. The actors all achieve a certain ingenuous tone that helps sell the movie. It matters little that we have no idea of things like how the farm survives when nobody seems to be working it or why no one balks when Charlie pulls the children out of school to help him with his project. Shot in stunning widescreen by the Polishes� longtime cinematographer, M. David Mullen, Audie and the others are frequently backlighted to achieve that certain heavenly glow. And Willis turns up as a fellow astronaut in an unbilled role that provides the movie with some bomber-jacket cachet. Fans of the Polish brothers and fans of inspirational movies may all depart the theatre scratching their heads: The Astronaut Farmer
 is not exactly the movie any of these viewers expected to see. This is almost always a good thing � even if the movie is a deserved head-scratcher.


It's not that "The Astronaut Farmer" is so farfetched.
I mean, yeah, it's about a space cowboy in training (Billy Bob Thornton) who quits NASA to concentrate on saving his family's Texas ranch. And yeah, the guy ends up building a rocket in his barn -- twice, no less, because he crashes the first one -- with junkyard parts, the aid of a six-figure bank tab, and the full support of his neighbors. But none of that is the reason this movie ultimately falls to earth like an expensive chunk of space debris.
The real problem with "The Astronaut Farmer" is that it has no spark.
From the very first shot of Thornton on horseback, herding stray cattle in his spacesuit, this is a work that often feels orchestrated instead of inspired, literal rather than ethereal. Though its vision is as flat as the world is round, it asks us to cheer on Charles Farmer, a hardheaded dreamer who doesn't always deserve the support of his beautiful wife (Virginia Madsen), his tech-savvy teenage son (Max Thieriot), or his impressionable young daughters (Jasper and Logan Polish, offspring of the movie's creators). And boy, is it loaded down with warmed-over corn (official tagline: "If we don't have our dreams, we have nothing").
Director Michael Polish ("Twin Falls Idaho") and his twin brother/co-writer, Mark, do know how to be amusing, particularly in scenes where the rocket man's genius is psychoanalyzed by a high school nurse and his sponsorship potential is evaluated by the local Dunkin' Donuts manager. But they also take themselves way too seriously this time out, mishandling many obvious plot absurdities and foolishly insisting that the American dream is the same as the American dream-at-all-costs.
Farmer isn't Neil Armstrong or John Glenn; he's David Blaine with sketchier priorities and less common sense. Even if most people will gladly suspend disbelief for an honest, well-written story about a misunderstood renegade, this is not that story.
Thornton plays his Capra-esque, thoroughly flawed everyman with easygoing restraint that might be welcomed anywhere else; here it just contributes to the lack of magic. And Madsen is fine if unchallenged: She has little to do other than waitress, fret, accept, repeat.
Bruce Dern shuffles around as Farmer's regret-filled father-in-law, Tim Blake Nelson is the helpful lawyer who battles government dolts and party poopers (because what American doesn't want the neighbors to have 10,000 pounds of missile-grade fuel for their private Mercury-Atlas replica?), and there's a perky uncredited cameo that re-teams Thornton with a well-known action star.
"The Astronaut Farmer" does not acknowledge being inspired by any real person or thing and, in a way, that's comforting. The kind of people who really build their dreams in barns have to be far more interesting.


         The brothers Polish, Michael and Mark, make a credible leap to big-budget studio features with the feel-good, dreamer drama, "The Astronaut Farmer." Though they relinquish some of their trademark quirkiness and visual flair, the sibling filmmakers nevertheless emerge with a movie that's atypical of Hollywood fare.
 
  There's something old-fashioned about "The Astronaut Farmer" that's so conventional it feels unconventional. It follows the paradigm of inspirational movies so perfectly that even the smallest deviation seems rebellious. The movie's orthodoxy is precisely what allows us to take such pleasure in its irregularities.
 


         






    The film's general message is familiar from the many movies about men crazy enough to think they can do anything as well as numerous episodes of "Oprah." It's summed up simply in the tagline, "If we don't have our dreams, we have nothing."
 
  In the movie, the words are spoken, or more precisely, spat out by Billy Bob Thornton, playing middle-aged Texas rancher Charles Farmer. The phrase hangs in the air, dripping with scorn, as if the idea of forgoing his dream repulses Farmer.
 
  His dream happens to be a pretty wild one. As a young pilot, Farmer was forced to drop out of NASA's space training program when his father died and he was called home to take over the ranch.
 
  Now, many years later, Farmer builds a rocket in which he plans to orbit the earth solo, with his 15-year-old son acting as his mission control. This doesn't sit well with an alphabet soup of government agencies that are determined to shut down the operation.
 
  The idea of a man, generally a loner, pursuing a singular goal while ignoring those who think him a fool, is almost always an attractive one. After all, who among us has not had some dream that has eluded us?
 
  The goal, like Farmer's, is often looked upon by others as an irrational one. As with Ray Kinsella, who plows under his cornfield to build a baseball diamond in "Field of Dreams," Farmer sees it not as an improbable ambition but an unavoidable one. It's not the right thing to do, it's the only thing to do.
 
  Much of the credit for the movie succeeding goes to Thornton. In his able hands, Farmer is not so much someone who simply has faith in what he is doing but a man who believes with incontrovertible knowledge of what can be accomplished.
 
  The filmmakers have surrounded him with a uniformly strong cast including Virginia Madsen, Max Thieriot, Bruce Dern, Tim Blake Nelson, J.K. Simmons and an unbilled Bruce Willis.
 
  As in their three previous independent features — "Twin Falls, Idaho,' "Jackpot" and "Northfork" — the Polishes mine a swath of Americana that seldom turns up in movies, at least with their sense of magic realism and poetry. It seems only fitting that even as they move into a more pragmatic and traditional narrative structure, they should maintain a tantalizingly blurred line between reality and their dreamscapes.
 
  With this movie, the brothers have been given a giant coloring book. While both write and produce, Mark directs and Michael acts (here he plays a stumbling FBI agent) and for the most part, they attempt to stay within the lines. But it's in the few moments when they go outside those lines that the movie momentarily soars.
 
  A weary but heroic man wearing a retro spacesuit astride a horse?
 
  Cool.
 
 
  "The Astronaut Farmer." MPAA-rating: PG for thematic material, peril and language. Running time: 1 hour, 44 minutes. In general release.   

In the shimmering first moments of the eccentric, endearing follow-your-bliss drama The Astronaut Farmer , a spaceman appears to be navigating the surface of the moon. Except that he's on a horse. Wearing a NASA helmet and flight suit. The terrain  turns out to be an expanse of farmland. And the homespun astronaut, played by Billy Bob  Thornton, is a farmer  named Charlie Farmer.
Charlie was once a bona fide NASA man, but he left the space program to save the family farm. Now his freelance goal is to circle the earth in a rocket of his own construction  an orbiting Field of Dreams, let's say. And to that end, he's built a DIY rocket in his barn. The townsfolk are tolerant enough (except at the bank, since he's defaulting on the mortgage), and his family is downright saintly, considering. Beaming wife Audie (Virginia Madsen, also spousely this week in The Number 23 ) stands by her man even though Charlie walks a thin line between aspiration and insanity, and the three Farmer kids love their daddy even though he eats dinner in his silver orbit-wear. Only the persnickety, rules-and-regs-hampered government, personified with energetic bluster by indispensable character actor J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man  films), objects to Charlie's project.
It's either a measure of Charlie's certifiable craziness or an expression of the gumption and enterprise that's generally considered all-American that the would-be Rocket Man just can't fathom why the feds might frown. (Yes, Elton John's ''Rocket Man'' is rented out for the soundtrack.)
Now might not be the ideal time to release a movie about an astronaut with an obsession, but Charlie's madness is far grander than any ho-hum NASA employee meltdown: Twin filmmaking brothers Michael (he directs) and Mark Polish (he co-writes with Michael) have long been fascinated with the solutions dreamed up by men who don't fit into the patches of piquant America where they happen to be planted, going back to their strong 1999 Sundance debut Twin Falls Idaho . After teeny indies, this studio release retains the trademark love of warped American gothic that the Polishes share with David Lynch and the brothers Ethan and Joel Coen. But the unexpected streak of yearning sunniness  the Spielbergian touch of boyhood dreams propelling a grown man  gives The Astronaut Farmer  a warmth that's new for them.
Charlie is both maddeningly barmy and a fascinating, ornery mule. And as such, there's no one I'd rather see orbiting the earth than Thornton, who plays the part with the exact illogical, earnest seriousness required for the mission. By the time Bruce Willis drops by, equally sincere, in a lovely cameo as NASA brass that grins at the actors' roles in Armageddon , the movie is so serenely in orbit that there's nothing to do but float along and enjoy the strange, sweet ride.

 There is a thin line separating visionaries from fools, and Billy Bob Thornton walks it adroitly in “The Astronaut Farmer,” a disarmingly sincere follow-your-dreams fable from Michael and Mark Polish, twin brothers who have previously specialized in surrealist indie-whimsy. Mr. Thornton, a bit less gaunt than usual, plays Charles Farmer — even his wife calls him by his last name — who is not a farmer at all, but rather a rancher in the small town of Story, Tex. That, at any rate, is his job, but Farmer’s true calling is space travel. In the face of local skepticism and government interference, he builds a rocket in his barn and makes plans to blast into orbit.  The tone of the film (directed by Michael Polish, who wrote and produced it with his brother) is wide-eyed and unapologetically sentimental. Story is a quirky, friendly place, where Farmer’s obsession is viewed with tolerant affection that only occasionally shades into exasperation. With another actor in the title role (Kevin Costner, say, just off the top of my head) the mawkishness would be unbearable, but Mr. Thornton can be relied upon for understated dignity accompanied by an intriguing undertone of serious craziness.  Not that Farmer is nuts, exactly. The loving patriarch of a loving family, he is just unwilling to compromise an ambition that has been with him since childhood and  was derailed by sad circumstances beyond his control. His wife, Audie (Virginia Madsen, glowing in an underwritten role), sticks with him long after a more sensible, less romantic woman would have fled. The couple’s teenage son (Max Thieriot) and two young daughters (Jasper and Logan Polish) worship their dad, and Farmer receives crucial moral and logistical support from his father-in-law (Bruce Dern), a loyal ranch hand (Sal Lopez) and the town lawyer (Tim Blake Nelson).  Among the doubters and obstructionists, who express their doubts with varying degrees of condescension and hostility, are an initially sympathetic Air Force buddy (Bruce Willis) and several departments of the federal government. Farmer’s attempt to buy an enormous quantity of rocket fuel attracts the attention of the F.B.I., and his spread is soon aswarm with black SUV’s and black-suited agents. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (J. K. Simmons) arrives in Story to hold hearings at the school gym, and the upshot is that solo space flight is strongly and officially discouraged.  As Farmer contends with the feds, the media frenzy that follows their arrival and also the bank threatening to foreclose on his ranch, the movie emits a flicker of cantankerous libertarianism. Invoking the proud history of the American space program, Farmer complains: “Somewhere along the line we stopped believing we could do anything. And if we don’t have our dreams, we have nothing.” Individual initiative, in his somewhat revisionist view, is the engine of such belief, which the government strangles by tying up dreams with rules and red tape. Those darn bureaucrats want to take away a man’s right to launch a rocket from his barn. What will they come after next?  But then again: what if everybody decided to launch his own space capsule? Needless to say, such practicalities are alien to the wide-eyed, can-do spirit of “The Astronaut Farmer.” So too is any real dramatic complication. The Polish brothers, in earlier films like “Twin Falls Idaho” and “Northfork,” have always placed wonderment above storytelling, and the availability of big stars and a reasonable special-effects budget has not entirely blunted their taste for odd, resonant images. The opening shots, of Farmer on horseback in his space suit, hint at a strangeness that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to, but it does have a visual freshness that makes the bromides and clichés palatable.  “The Astronaut Farmer” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some naughty words and a few mild double-entendres about the size of the main character’s rocket.

The Polish Brothers, sibling creators of hipster pics "Twin Falls Idaho" and "Northfork," seem unlikely candidates to make a film that might play most successfully to deep-heartland family auds. But such is the case with "The Astronaut Farmer," whose quirky-sounding premise -- Billy Bob Thornton as a Texas rancher and family man determined to launch himself into orbit via a self-built rocket -- belies the "Field of Dreams"-style opus whose principal notes are inspirational, sentimental and downright square. Planned for a wide February opening (after December awards-qualifying dates), Warner release will need careful marketing to build word-of-mouth. Critical support should run lukewarm.
Thornton plays Charlie Farmer, husband to the devoted Augie (Virginia Madsen), father to 15-year-old son Shepard (Max Thieriot) and younger daughters Stanley (Jasper Polish) and Sunshine (Logan Polish). As we eventually learn, Farmer was once an astronaut-in-training, but had to drop out when tragedy struck back at the ranch. In the decades since, the space race lost momentum. But Farmer didn't -- in fact, from spare parts, he's managed to assemble a shiny, sizeable, perhaps functional rocket ship in the barn.
This obsession is treated more like pie-in-sky lunacy by many locals, who don't expect Farmer to get off the ground. The effort has also run him deep into the red -- and the bank he's just asked for yet another loan threatens foreclosure.
The Feds take notice when Farmer attempts to buy 10,000 gallons of rocket fuel. They descend en masse, fearing some nutjob building his own Weapon of Mass Destruction. Jon Gries and Mark Polish as Mutt 'n' Jeff FBI agents, J.K. Simmons' hostile FAA chief, and Bruce Willis in an extended retired-astronaut cameo exert pressure to dissuade Farmer.
Meanwhile, international media arrive at the behest of protag's local lawyer pal Tim Blake Nelson. They deliver some public rooting interest, but also make a freakshow of the "Farmer Space Program."
Panicked, Farmer abruptly launches. His ride is short, disastrous, and (all-too-conveniently) avoids injuring anyone but himself. Chastened, he recoups. Film's biggest suspension of disbelief is called for when Madsen's supportive wife decides that a possibly dead husband is still a better role model than one who "gave up." Emotionally and economically, she underwrites subsequent construction of a second ship.
Some viewers may wonder just how inspirational -- or even sane -- a man can be while pursuing his single-minded obsession at the highest potential cost to loved ones. But "The Astronaut Farmer" demands most literal acceptance of Farmer's statement, "If we don't have our dreams, we have nothing." There's no room to consider that some dreams may be wrongheaded. Farmer's climactic launch does generate some wonder and suspense, but anyone expecting ironic commentary will get the silence of deep space.
Thornton carries the film with relaxed authority, though the earnest tone doesn't let him explore the nuttier aspects of a character who, from any reasoned distance ought look more screwy than heroic. Madsen is radiant -- often literally, given beatific-backlighting nature of M. David Mullen's widescreen photography -- as an ideal wife and mother. Support players are fine, but given little room to make a major impressions.
Lensing is by far the outstanding element in the smooth $13 million production package (shot in New Mexico doubling as Texas), with several truly gorgeous sunset and sunrise sequences highlighting a visual presentation that at times borders on the excessively prettified. (Does anyone actually work on this ranch, by the way?) All tech contribs are high-grade. Abetted by numerous alt-country tracks, Stuart Matthewman's original score is least interesting when sticking to familiar Americana-uplift orchestration.

The fourth film from Mark and Michael Polish  will very likely alienate fans of their earlier work, who will wonder what became of their rueful inscrutability and scoff at the cornpone, heart-on-the-sleeve sentiments that permeate every second of this latest. But those who do turn up their noses at this story of a former astronaut (played by Billy Bob Thornton , blessedly shirking the drunken shit-heel parts that have defined his filmography of late) who still dreams of space travel and inspires his family with his indefatigable spirit will miss out, because The Astronaut Farmer remains very much in line with the Polish brothers' earlier work. It's still a fairy tale, only for grade-school children for whom such aphorisms as "If we don't have our dreams, we have nothing" are not hackneyed greeting-card sentiments but inspiration. There is no denying it: This is male-weepie, Field of Dreams  territory, a tale of a son risking farm and family in order to escape the specter of his daddy's failures. But this movie works precisely because it's bereft of modern cinema's cynicismthat above-it-all sneer that permeates most of the well-intentioned kiddie films made more to hold parents' attention than their children's.
