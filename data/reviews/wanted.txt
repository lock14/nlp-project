If Maxim
 magazine ever decides to branch out into filmmaking, Wanted
 is just the kind of ear-throttling nonsense it�s bound to produce. Based on Mark Millar�s ultraviolent comic-book miniseries of the same name, Wanted
 isn�t so much a movie as it is a testosterone-fueled parade of fast cars, big guns, heavy metal guitars, exposed cleavage, and tests of masculinity. Plot? Characters? Meaning? Who cares about those trifles when you�ve got Jolie easing herself languidly out of a bathtub after an evening spent killing perfect strangers with a gun that comes with a video camera attachment allowing her to see around corners? Definitely not director Bekmambetov, who slobbers over this weapon like a 12-year-old eyeing his first Penthouse
 magazine � more, in fact, than he slobbers over Miss Jolie. Wanted
�s hero, Wesley (McAvoy), doesn�t need such toys, however; he can make bullets bend in midflight just by sheer force of will, no digital recording device required. Apparently he�s the son of the world�s greatest assassin and possessed of the ability, under high-adrenaline circumstances, to slow down the world until it looks remarkably like a low-budget version of The Matrix
, complete with CGI-enhanced shots of bullets flying through the air and a warping effect that makes the screen pulse like concentric ripples on a pond, which is funny, because, until recently, Wesley could have sworn he was just an ordinary anxiety-ridden nebbish cowering namelessly in a dead-end cubicle job. (The one and only clever moment in Wanted
 comes when Wesley Googles himself at the office and not a single match comes up. How�s that for a 21st century existential crisis?) Instead, he�s snatched up by the mysterious Fox (Jolie) and taken to a man named Sloan (Freeman, channeling Lawrence Fishburne�s Morpheus), who informs our reluctant hero that it�s his destiny to join a group of assassins called the Fraternity (perfect!), who are descended from a group of rebel medieval weavers and to whom the names of targets are relayed though the fabrics produced by a magical loom that communicates the wishes of the Fates. Now, I know what you�re thinking: Why, exactly, would weavers become assassins? And why is Wesley capable of throwing curveballs with bullets? And what the hell is Freeman doing in this movie? The answer to these questions is simple: There is no answer � and it�s a fool who looks for one, especially when there�s so much sadistic fun to be had watching cars flip and people�s heads explode in slow motion, so salacious and voyeuristic as to be almost pornographic. With every bit of sliced flesh and every punctured skull, I found myself wondering who exactly this movie is for. Its unflinching violence has earned it an R rating, meaning its desired demographic � teenage boys � is out of contention. That raises the question: Are there really adults who want to sit through this kind of mindless, bullying mayhem? Maybe I don�t want to know the answer to that one.


Jolie is rough, tough, and out to kill in 'Wanted'


In the preposterous, luridly entertaining "Wanted," we have this year's model of the Angry Young Man Power Fantasy. 1999's "Fight Club," which had some ideas, was the progenitor; 2007's "300," which didn't, was a recent entry. "Wanted" plays it down the middle, being neither too stupid to entirely discount nor smart enough to take seriously. Fortunately, the movie's onto the cruel joke at its center: That the roughest, toughest SOB on the planet these days is Angelina Jolie.
It's important that an Angry Young Man Power Fantasy be directed within an inch of its life by a talented up-and-comer, or the boys will get restless. Here we have Timur Bekmambetov, whose 2004 fantasy-action epic "Night Watch" was a sensation in Russia and a cult item here, tossing cars, trains, and heavy weaponry around with heartless abandon. Bekmambetov should have a rewarding Hollywood career: He makes you see the same old violence with fresh, often astounded eyes.
It's important, too, that an AYMPF have a weenie for a hero, a pallid cubicle drone who's taught to be a man, dammit, by a pillar of testosterone. As mentioned, said pillar in "Wanted" is Jolie, and as actress and found object she's more than happy to work that irony. A sleek, tattooed avatar of adolescent desire, she also knows better than to give her character any human qualities.
The weenie is Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), quivering from the combined assault of castrating boss, girlfriend, best friend, job, apartment, 21st-century existence. Wouldn't you know it, though - he's really a superhero, descended from a secret thousand-year line of gifted assassins called The Fraternity. Those stress attacks he keeps having? They're actually the genetic adrenalin boosts that allow Wesley to slow time down and deliver roundhouse kicks in mid-air.
Dreams of omnipotence rarely come this blunt, and after the initial disbelief on Wesley's part, "Wanted" takes great delight in letting him exact revenge on his puny tormentors. Imagine Harry Potter beating the Dursleys down, or Walter Mitty with a case of 'roid rage.
Then the movie's careering off on its rip-snorting main story line. There's a traitor in the ranks of the Fraternity, and among his victims is Wesley's long-lost daddy (David O'Hara). The head of the ancient brotherhood, Sloan (Morgan Freeman, who else?) asks the young man to fulfill his destiny by avenging his father, but first - the training sequence!
This involves ritual beatings (taken from "Fight Club"), suspended beef carcasses (taken from "Rocky"), the ability to bend bullets (taken from "The Matrix"), and long, healing baths in a gooey white substance (taken from Kripalu by way of Sigmund Freud). As a fellow assassin named Fox, Jolie is Beatrice to McAvoy's Dante, or Brad Pitt to his Edward Norton, or something. In any event, "Wanted" never allows a romance to develop between these two since that would be, like, gay.
Wait, have I mentioned the bedsheets? The Fraternity, it turns out, was founded by a medieval guild of weavers, and their modern descendants - a paradoxically multiracial crew that includes rapper Common as a weapons expert - hole up in a garment factory, taking their orders from a giant loom in which the names of their targets (all bad men, we're assured) are mystically encoded into the weave. You could try this at Linens 'n Things, but the thread count's just not there.
"Wanted" has clearly gone lunatic by this point, and the juicy pop subversion of the early scenes has vanished, replaced by dizzying action sequences that dispatch screaming extras as if they were so many Pez. A high-speed Eurail train hangs insanely off the side of a cliff and still Wesley and the evil Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) duke it out. Bekmambetov and his effects team allow us to both scoff and goggle at the glistening mayhem, yet there's a sense the movie has stopped riding the wave of macho fantasy and become swamped by it instead.
Eventually the script tosses us a decent twist, followed by further formulaic revenge, followed by a funny capper wherein McAvoy stares down the fanboys in their seats and dares them to grow a pair. It's as if Dirty Harry had gone into the self-help business.
The real subject, though, is the sexualization of ordnance. Nothing new there. More than once, Bekmambetov's camera magically follows a bullet backward through reverse-trajectory, out of the victim's head and into the womb of the shooter's muzzle; more than once, two bullets mash together in a homoerotic embrace. "Wanted" is quite happy to judge a man by the size of his gun. The irony is that the biggest one here belongs to Jolie, and her Amazon
 smile indicates she knows exactly how nervous that makes the boys.


         "WANTED" straddles the line between the delightfully absurd and the merely ridiculous. As its heroes race through the city at barely subsonic speeds, they execute the kind of maneuvers that are normally performed only by 8-year-olds making "vroom vroom" noises. As digital effects approach seamless integration with live-action footage, what dazzles is not the sophistication of the technology but the audacity of the ideas, and "Wanted" has audacity to burn.
 
 Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy)
 is a nobody. Really, the
 nobody. He's such a blank that he doesn't even show up on Google. A scrawny, squeaky-voiced cubicle drone, he is henpecked by his girlfriend, cuckolded by his best friend and bullied by his petty tyrant boss. It's enough to make you want to kill somebody.
 


         






   Wesley is filling his latest prescription for anti-anxiety meds when a sly, feline creature named Fox ( Angelina Jolie)
 offers him stress relief through homicide. Fox informs Wesley that he, like his father, was born into a shadowy fraternity of superpowered assassins who can flood their bodies with adrenaline at will, giving them superhuman strength, speed and the ability to shoot bullets in wicked, curving arcs.
 
 Wesley barely has time to absorb the news when he is swept quite literally off his feet. Pursued, he is told, by the rogue fraternity member who killed his father and has designs on him, Wesley stands helplessly in the street until Fox approaches in a speeding  car, which goes into a 360-degree spin, knocks a goggle-eyed Wesley into its passenger seat and speeds off without so much as a tap of the brake pedal.
 
 At this point, Timur Bekmambetov's “Wanted”
 presents you with a choice. You can let yourself, like Wesley, be carried off by a slick vehicle moving at breakneck speed, or you can grumble, mutter something about the laws of physics and start checking your watch.
 
 After a training process that consists mainly of being beaten into several kinds of hamburger (the movie, which is not for the squeamish, showcases multiple scenes of extravagant violence), Wesley is initiated by the fraternity's dapper head honcho, Sloan ( Morgan Freeman), who explains that the brotherhood was founded by a clan of weavers who saw a chance to alter the world's destiny. What turned these men of the cloth into stone-cold killers is never exactly explained.
 
 The fraternity takes its orders from a giant contraption called the Loom of Fate, which issues the names of targets through a code embedded in its fabric. The assassins are not meant to question, merely to accept their role in some grand, unseen design. That this means killling people without any hint as to their crimes bothers Wesley only briefly.
 
 In a movie that musters barely more than a dozen speaking parts, there are heroes and there is cannon fodder. In a thrilling face-to-face battle that sends a passenger train plummeting into a gorge, there's not even a pause to acknowledge the collateral damage of the duel between supermen. Bekmambetov savors the way a target's forehead explodes as a bullet burrows through from the back, but the slaughter of innocents fails to hold his interest.
 
 As much fun as it is to watch Bekmambetov play with his action figures, the movie would be more engaging if he ever got under their polyurethane skin. McAvoy tries mightily to bridge the gap between wheezy nebbish and eager assassin, but there's nothing pushing him forward beyond the movie's pronounced contempt for his former life. In "Wanted's" cosmos, there are wolves and there are sheep, and the sheep are not even worth pitying.
 
 Jolie is all wolf, kohl-eyed and coldblooded. But for all her lethal skills (and drop-dead physique), there's something approachable about her. She plays Fox with a hint of sardonic remove and a touch of down-to-earth grit, as if this pumped-up killing machine hasn't forgotten what it's like to be one of the girls. She puts her  catsuit on one leg at a time.
 
 "Wanted's" hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy.  But the adrenaline-overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men. As long as Bekmambetov keeps the pedal to the metal, you don't notice the rotten scenery outside.
 
 "Wanted." MPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence throughout, pervasive language and some sexuality. Running time: 1 hour, 44 minutes. In general release.   

Wanted  is kind of unintelligible and idiotic. Also kind of nasty and brutish. And also undeniably kind of fun, especially when Angelina Jolie, as an assassin (assassiness? assassinix?) appropriately named Fox, narrows her cat eyes, sets her lush mouth, flashes an Illiad 's worth of tattooed text on her impossible bod, and brandishes firearms.
But hold that thought a minute, let's get back to unintelligible idiocy. See, there's an overmedicated office drone named Wesley (Atonement 's James McAvoy) who hates his sucky life  his girlfriend cheats on him, his work supervisor is an outsize shrew. (Tsk!  Women!) Then Fox shows up to tell Wesley he's destined to join a secret society of good-guy assassins who also happen to be weavers. I mean, they're a guild of killers who can read the names of future evildoers woven into encoded cloth by a magical Loom of Fate. Then, as Loom monitor Morgan Freeman explains it, it's up to the assassins to ''kill one and maybe save a thousand.'' I mean  oh, screw it, it's a comic book , from the series by Mark Millar and JG Jones.
Anyhow, the Scottish-born McAvoy proves to be as nimble a befuddled hero as he is an unlikely choice for the gig. The nasty and brutish component, meanwhile, arrives courtesy of director Timur Bekmambetov; he's the crazy Kazakh action stylist who made the 2004 international thriller Night Watch  and the equally mad 2006 follow-up Day Watch . Wanted  is set in America  Wesley is ostensibly a cog out of a Dilbert  comic strip  but there's global realpolitik glee to the filmmaker's fancy-splatter approach to violence. There are also a lot of exploding rats.
And best of all, there's a lot of Jolie, barrels blazing. The star's fearlessly sexy hauteur is unique in the biz today. And when she works it in Wanted , she kills, bullets optional.

 The money shot in “Wanted,” its pièce-de-special-effects-résistance and reason for green-lighted being, appears in the opening minutes of this noisy, ultraviolent shoot-’em-up with Angelina Jolie, her many tattoos and some guys. A man has soared onto the roof of a high-rise where he has laid a handful of others to waste. Suddenly the camera cuts to his face as a bullet exits his forehead in slow motion, his skin stretching forward as the projectile tears through it, going straight for the camera and our already numbed skulls.  Well, that’s one way to get the attention of fickle moviegoers, particularly if, like the director Timur Bekmambetov, you’ve got nothing else going for your big Hollywood debut except Ms. Jolie and a couple of ideas recycled from “The Matrix” and “Fight Club.” Mind you, Ms. Jolie has been perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin named (wait for it) Fox. Few American actresses, especially those with such pin-skinny arms, can make beating a guy to the ground look so easy and, yeah, man, like fun. With her mean smiley-sneer and snug clothes, her heels and hieroglyphics, she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring antsy boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.  Beating down the audience is what the crudest entertainments try to do, and in this respect, and in every other, “Wanted” is nothing new. And Mr. Bekmambetov, a Russian filmmaker who has earned a cult following with his razzly-dazzly thrillers “Day Watch” and “Night Watch,” certainly proves here that he knows how to use every blunt tool of the bullying trade: flashy effects, zippy cuts, simulated death, walls of sound, wheels of steel and, in between the bullets and blood, a hot mama to make the brother-to-brother, man-on-man action less worrisome. This is, after all, a movie almost entirely organized around the sights and sounds of men piercing one another’s bodies, which makes for a whole lot of twitching and spurting.  “Wanted” is a goof, then, and for a short stretch a pretty diverting one. The basic story, culled from a comic-book series by Mark Millar and J. G. Jones, revolves around a pusillanimous cubicle drone named Wesley (James McAvoy, going for cheeky and packing new muscle), who, at least in the movie, has been conceptualized along the same Everyman lines as Edward Norton’s character in “Fight Club.” Both have soul-sucking jobs, self-mocking voiceovers and a glamorous comrade in violence who ushers them into thrilling worlds of excitement and life-altering action, except that Mr. Norton’s friend is played by Brad Pitt, and Mr. McAvoy’s friend is played by Mr. Pitt’s real partner, Ms. Jolie, which, for about a millisecond makes this sound far more interesting than what actually materializes on screen.  What does turn up looks familiar — the slowed bullets, the air that ripples like water, an underground group, here called the Fraternity — especially if you’ve seen “The Matrix.” Although Mr. Bekmambetov and his team take plenty of cues from that film, they have tried to distinguish their dystopian nightmare by borrowing from even farther afield. To that end the Fraternity practices its murderous skills on pig carcasses (much as Daniel Day-Lewis does in “Gangs of New York”) while bunkered in a sprawling factory (that looks like Hogwarts). I’m pretty sure I saw the fabulous recovery room —  a concrete spa filled with sunken tubs and lighted candles where Fraternity members go for restorative soaks after a hard day of carnage —  in a layout in Vogue.  The problem is that after a grindingly repetitive rotation of bang-bang, boom-boom, knuckle sandwiches and exploding heads, I wanted to sink into one of those tubs myself (minus the rats scuttling nearby). There’s no denying Mr. Bekmambetov’s energy or enthusiasm: he blows people and stuff up with gusto. But all his visual ideas, or at least the memorable ones, are borrowed, as are the pitifully few thoughts in the script by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Chris Morgan. Even if the ideas in “The Matrix” didn’t blow your mind or stir memories of college-age woolgathering, at least it has ideas and real feeling. There’s something at stake in its world, which is why its fusion of skepticism and sincerity worked so well, and still does.  Things happen in “Wanted,” but no one cares. You could call that nihilism, but even nihilism requires commitment of a kind and this, by contrast, is a movie built on indifference. Fox and the rest of the Fraternity  —  headed by Morgan Freeman, voice and eyes glazed with boredom  —  initiate Wesley into their killing ways. He, in turn, discovers their dusty secrets (blah-blah, monks and weaving), eyeballs the other guys (Common and Thomas Kretschmann, both wasted) and learns how to make a bullet curve through the air, a trick that soon loses its wow factor. Mr. Bekmambetov jerks the strings, setting his puppets to dancing. Right on cue Mr. McAvoy swaggers and Ms. Jolie smiles even as Mr. Freeman checks his watch, beating me to the punch.  “Wanted” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Nonstop violence, brief kitchen-counter sex.

"Wanted" devilishly ups the ante to a new level in adapting violent graphic comics to the bigscreen. By confidently grafting nastily creative, high-tech new ways to kill people onto traditional dramatic themes involving professional assassins and family revenge, Kazakhstan-born Timur Bekmambetov assures himself the distinction of becoming the first modern director to emerge from Russia to carve a high profile in Hollywood. Relentless, in-your-face action and a classy cast led by a beefed-up James McAvoy and a heavily tatted Angelina Jolie combine to promise powerful B.O. prospects worldwide for Universal. 
As the man responsible for the two highest-grossing films in Russian history, "Night Watch" and its sequel "Day Watch," Bekmambetov, a helmer with muscular visual skills akin to those of top commercials directors, was a good bet to supply the desired edge and a distinctive flavor to this type of genre fare. Often fruitfully and sometimes gratuitously, he gooses every shot with some extra jolt or manipulation, be it an abrupt change in camera speed, skip-framing, odd pulsation or just good, old-fashioned rack focus. He can even use the leading character's accelerated metabolism as a plausible excuse to create a visual correlative in the film's often breathless rhythms.
Like it or not, "Wanted" pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration.
Opening action sequence provides a pretty good indication of what's in store in this adaptation of the popular cult comics created by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones: After deftly avoiding assassination in his office in a Chicago skyscraper, the formidable-looking Mr. X (David Patrick O'Hara) leaps through glass and across the void to the roof of the building across the way, only to finally lose a gun battle fought with bullets that follow curved trajectories when fired by shooters who know what they're doing.
Next day, put-upon account manager Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is abruptly informed by a mysterious woman (Jolie) standing in a supermarket line that his father, one of the all-time great assassins, died yesterday. Suddenly, this woman, whose name aptly happens to be Fox, is in a firefight with Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who killed dear old dad -- a duel that continues in insanely speeding vehicles on the Chitown streets. That's two hyperventilated action sequences in the first 25 minutes.
Fox takes Wesley to the fortress-like headquarters of the Fraternity, where a nattily attired Morgan Freeman, as the org's boss, Sloan, explains how the 1,000-year-old institution takes it upon itself to eliminate people who are fated to die for reasons dictated by hidden patterns in textiles woven at the factory. Learning that this is as good a reason as any to bump off people he doesn't know, Wesley undergoes training -- repeatedly getting the living crap beaten out of him by menacing guys with names like the Repairman, the Butcher and the Exterminator -- in brutally sadistic interludes designed to make the wimpy loser tough enough to take on the rogue former Fraternity brother Cross.
Once he's graduated by perfecting the art of the bending bullet, Wesley achieves his rite of passage to ultimate manhood -- defined as being able to kill without hesitation or remorse. Wesley's transformation, from one-time pushover to indestructible powerhouse, is not unlike that of any number of Marvel heroes,although the context and implications here are much darker than in the worlds of Spider-Man and his brethren.
Desperate to go toe-to-toe with Cross, Wesley heads to Europe and the birthplace of the Fraternity, where, under duress, its monkish leader (Terence Stamp) arranges a rendezvous aboard a train. This spectacularly outlandish action sequence, which parallels multiple earlier scenes of Wesley and Fox training on top of Chicago's El, would seem designed to cap things off. But as concocted by scripters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas (who collaborated on "3:10 to Yuma" and "2 Fast 2 Furious") and Chris Morgan ("The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"), there are multiple betrayals, avenged misdeeds and literal mind-blowing still to come in a film that never lets up.
The diminutive McAvoy might have seemed an unexpected choice for this sort of kickass role, but the always inventive thesp proves he's got a bit of Russell Crowe in him as he brandishes an impressive amount of muscle, grit and anger. He may be one of those rare actors who can do just about anything. Fox is a perfect role for Jolie, a sort of fancified extension of her Mrs. Smith that allows her to be a tough babe and also gently send up the caricature. While intoning the dialogue with his usual elan, Freeman gets to be nastier than usual as the big boss in charge of all the secrets. Most of the supporting thesps register strongly on the basis of being memorable physical types.
Bekmambetov's Russian films showed he knows how to achieve the visceral effects he wants, and the vastly greater means at his disposal here provide him with the tools to supercharge his work; he will have his pick of projects now. He and his highly pro team of lenser Mitchell Amundsen, production designer John Myhre, editor David Brenner and myriad hands in the effects, makeup, stunt, location and other departments manage a consistent blend of live-action with computer effects, and Prague studio work with Chicago and New York street shooting. As if the picture needed it, Danny Elfman's score provides additional propulsion.

Of the summers many revenge-of-the-nerd fulfillment fantasiesfrom The Incredible Hulk  all the way down the megaplex food chain to The Foot Fist Way Wanted  stands the best chance of dislodging Fight Club  from fanboys Facebook  pages. It has the same dizzying flipbook style, the same kicky ultraviolence, the same undeniable appeal of punch-clock paybackand best of all, no irony! Fed up with your shit job, your bitch boss, your slut girlfriend, your shriveled manhood? Screw reading The Purpose-Driven Life . Embrace your inner hitman and cap a few asses.
The first rule of David Fincher s Iron John uprising was: Dont tell anyone. Fuck that noise (or lack thereof). If Fight Club  was a cautionary tale, Wanted  comes on like a recruitment videothe story of how a meek, pallid cube jockey, Wesley Gibson  (James McAvoy ), morphs from loser to bruiser by joining a secret society of assassins. Though adapted by screenwriters Michael Brandt , Derek Haas , and Chris Morgan  from a Mark Millar-J.G. Jones comic-book series, its origin lies less in comics themselves than in the old back-of-the-book ads that promised 98-pound weaklings how to find the brute within. So when shaky, pill-popping Wesleycheated on by his girlfriend, betrayed by his so-called best friend, and berated by his harridan boss at a soul-sucking account-management McJobgets yanked out of a drugstore checkout line by a lithe hottie with a knack for zigzag marksmanship, he becomes the prime candidate for a hired-gun makeover. Turns out Wesleys absentee father belonged to The Fraternity, a clandestine clan of weavers who have maintained order (all evidence of human history to the contrary) by weeding out the worlds undesirables, the names of whom appear in coded fabric. (For delivering this hooey with customary gravitas, Morgan Freeman , The Fraternitys oracular Mr. Big, deserves something bigger than an Oscarmaybe something in the Vatican .) And like his old man, Wesley is a natural born killerwith superhuman reflexes, mad stunt-driving skillz, and death strikes that swerve bullets into serpentine trajectories.
Even with a well-deserved R ratingthe Red Cross  should develop funnels to catch all the zero-gravity splatter floating in the movies screen spaceWanted  is the most juvenile of the summers superhero movies, and in some ways the most up-front about its stunted playground machismo (the source of Fight Club s irony). This is a boys, boys world. As played by McAvoy, Atonement s aggrieved innocent, Wesley is a cartoon of whipped male drudgery, needled by his best friends smarmy refrain of Hes the man. Women figure into the story as either obstacles or turncoats. The battle cry here is Grow a pair, and theres no more blood-boiling insult than being called a pussywhich is bizarre, since the most lethal ass-kicker on call is a woman.
Then again, as Wesleys initiate into the otherwise all-male Fraternity, Angelina Jolie  transcends gender the way a thermonuclear warhead overrides boundaries. In her videogame-avatar roles, with her sharpened cheekbones, telescopic-sight intensity, and a chest-forward walk like the coming of an icebreakers prow, Jolies default setting is an omnivorous, dehumanized take-no-prisoners sexuality that begs for military metaphors. (Even in the softcore tropical breezes of Original Sin , her nipples stood at Def-Con 4.) Here, given little to play besides robotic assurance, she sneaks some welcome physical wit into the movie, as in the coolly contemptuous cock of her head when Wesley nearly punks out on the program. But shes there mostly as a presexualized adolescent boys sex object. Apart from a fleeting nude shotmy crowd responded with a bought-and-paid-for Yesss !her only erotic moment exists to make Wesley look studly to his dumbfounded ex.
At least Wanted , like the giddily preposterous Transporter  movies, has the self-awareness to push its incessant CGI into the realm of abstraction. When Wesley exacts revenge on a co-worker with a keyboard head-smash, the flying keys deliver a parting obscenity in airborne Scrabble (with a tooth for a blank tile). Photorealism applied to such nonsensical ends produces a uniquely surreal effectas when pixilated pixie dust allows us the magic of watching bullets pierce flesh from the inside . The director, Timur Bekmambetov , whose Russian vampire diptych Night Watch  and Day Watch  introduced a little Joel Silver  CGI overkill to the cinema of Eisenstein, Ptushko, and Kalatazov, thrives on kinetic hyperbole. Here cars flip like flapjacks and continue unharmed; running leaps cross concrete canyons; a speeding train plunges down a thousand-foot gorge only to go faster.
But the appeal of Bekmambetovs stylethat everything exists for sensation, logic and natural law be damnedis also its limitation. Wanted  never tops its gee-whiz opening sequence, in which a Fraternity brother takes out a rooftop of bad guys with wicked gun fu. There are limits even to the number of times this Grand Theft Auto  admirer can watch blood slung across the screen in fetishized slow-motion globules. In the end, Wanted  may be most notable for cementing the connection between superhero movies and the cinematic craze they have temporarily supplanted, torture pornboth genres that, like Fight Club , address our ambiguous fascination with being powerless and invulnerable at the same time. But Bekmambetovs movie evaporates pretty quickly after its consumedsomething you can't say of Fincher's film, which shadows most every frame of this cowering-male power trip. The first rule of Wanted  should be: Don't tell anyone about Fight Club .
