This modest, melancholic road-movie drama concerns two brothers (Adam Rothenberg and Ethan Peck) who travel from New Mexico to Tennessee in search of their violent father. Why? Because Peck's character has developed leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. Tennessee  veers dangerously  close to made-for-TV territory. But you utterly believe the bond between the siblings, and Rothenberg excels in his role of a protective older bro who also happens to be a haunted binge drinker. Mariah Carey is perfectly fine playing a waitress who dreams of becoming, yes, a  singer  even if the superstar's presence in such a small venture seems jarring. B–

 There are signs that Aaron Woodley, the director of “Tennessee,” an earnest, increasingly preposterous road movie about unhealed family wounds and fraternal bonds, wanted to make a Terrence Malick film. In the early scenes of the movie, whose setting shifts from the desert outskirts of Albuquerque to Texas, Oklahoma and finally Tennessee, the camera studies the glowing Western sky at twilight as though determined to find a visionary beauty in desolate wasteland.  It is outside Albuquerque that Carter Armstrong (Adam Rothenberg), a cabdriver in his early 30s, lives a marginal existence in a trailer with his younger brother,  Ellis (Ethan Peck, grandson of Gregory). Awkward flashbacks reveal that 15 years earlier the young Carter (Ryan Lynn), a high school football star, fled his childhood home in Knoxville, Tenn., dragging Ellis with him, after being terrorized by his drunken, abusive father, Roy (Bill Sage). Like his dad Carter is now a bitter alcoholic hothead itching for excuses to lash out at the world. But he is also fiercely protective of Ellis, who, as depicted in Russell Schaumburg’s lumpy screenplay, is too angelic to be true.  The brothers’ lives are uprooted when Ellis is found to have  leukemia. After Carter proves incompatible as a bone marrow donor, he decides they must return to Knoxville to determine if their father would be a suitable candidate. At a Texas diner Ellis befriends Krystal Evans (Mariah Carey), a waitress and aspiring country singer-songwriter. When she offers to put them up for the night, they encounter her monstrous husband, Frank (Lance Reddick), a state trooper who loathes the brothers on sight and threatens Krystal’s life if she touches one of them.  Seizing her opportunity to escape, she flees with them before dawn. On discovering her disappearance, Frank, convinced she has been kidnapped, gives chase.  Although the setup has its gripping moments, “Tennessee” collapses once the three stop in Nashville with Frank breathing down their necks. Although Ms. Carey makes a brave effort to put on a Texan accent, later in the movie she seems to have forgotten it, and there is nothing countrylike about her singing or the song with which she wows the audience in a Nashville talent competition. It isn’t saying much, but at least her work here is more substantial than in the catastrophic “Glitter.”  By this time Krystal has metamorphosed from goodhearted to gooey sweet. The story cedes its final shreds of credibility in a contrived scene where Frank, observing someone else’s abused wife, miraculously sees the light and softens. From here on “Tennessee” wades hip-deep in mush.  “Tennessee” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and mild violence.

A deglamorized Mariah Carey, unexceptional in her cinematic followup to the disastrous "Glitter," hitches her wagon to a road movie about two brothers racing cross-country to find a bone-marrow match to save the younger sibling from leukemia. While "Tennessee" scribe Russell Schaumberg never met a cliche he didn't like, helmer Aaron Woodley ("Rhinoceros Eyes") tries to inject authenticity into script's prefab structure, helped by Adam Rothenberg's strong perf as a bitter alcoholic older brother. But ultimately, nothing can save this pic from the warm fuzzies. Theatrical prospects look weak, though curiosity over Carey could propel the pic in ancillary. 
A teenage Carter (Rothenberg) bundles his mother and little brother into their car after knocking out his alcoholic, abusive father (Bill Sage), leaving behind his g.f. and a chance at a career in football.
When he next appears, Carter (still played by Rothenberg) is a cynical, hard-drinking cab driver with no ambition and less hope. His younger brother Ellis (Ethan Peck, Gregory's grandson), who obsessively photographs mountaintops, falls ill with leukemia and Carter reluctantly agrees to take him back to Tennessee in the hopes their detested dad may prove a bone-marrow match.
Their car breaks down, and the siblings are picked up by waitress Carey, herself in an abusive marriage to a state trooper (Lance Reddick, a strong presence in an overly simplistic role). Soon the three are tooling merrily along the road to Nashville to fulfill Carey's modest dreams of making it as a singer-songwriter (gulp). Carey's homicidal cop husband, though, is hot on their trail.
Up to this juncture "Tennessee," though painfully predictable, coasts on the strength of its tensely contained thesping and quietly atmospheric helming. Once the script hits meaningful wrapup mode, however, improbabilities pile up with dizzying speed.
Many picturesque vistas, a mild Carey number and a few illness-induced swoons later, the moral scales are gently and miraculously balanced and the actors try desperately not to get drowned in the sentimental backwash.
