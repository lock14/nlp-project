Studios probably gave You, Me and Dupree
 a green light without even reading a script. Imagine the pitch: �It�s a wacky comedy with Owen Wilson, fresh off last summer�s megahit The Wedding Crashers
! And hey, there�s a wedding in it!� At this point, the execs likely respond, �Here�s $50 million. Deliver a funny trailer and make sure to show that wedding.� To point, the actual quality of You, Me and Dupree
 probably won�t impact its opening weekend gross. So, it�s a nice surprise that the filmmakers and cast deliver a funny, reasonably well-written diversion with some impressive acting and refreshing bits of realism. Wilson carries the film as Randolph Dupree, a gainfully unemployed idealist who moves in with his newlywed best friend, Carl (Dillon), and Carl's wife, Molly (Hudson) after losing his apartment. At first, the film adheres closely to an episodic formula: Dupree screws up, Molly gets mad, the couple threatens to kick Dupree out, then ultimately reconsiders because, dammit, he�s so lovable. However, first-time writer Mike LeSieur eventually offers some inventive twists in character dynamics that the trailer never hints at. Mostly though, the film benefits from a fine cast that puts more effort into their roles than they probably need to. Wilson ratchets up the charm and crafts a character who is infinitely more likable than his sleazebag-turned-sensitive guy in The Wedding Crashers
. He keeps Dupree mostly anchored in reality, which is no small feat in this sort of comedy. Dillon and Hudson also go above and beyond, lending some genuine emotion and complexity to their grounded characters. Even Douglas seems like he�s earning his paycheck, though his role as Molly�s surly father proves mostly unnecessary. However, there�s a tension throughout the film that threatens to sink it. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who previously directed TV, most notably several episodes of Arrested Development
) clearly want to develop realistic characters and they take the film�s premise beyond the comic mayhem seen in the trailer. But it seems they also want to make money. Lots of it. And so, for every scene that feels natural there�s another that�s obviously scripted to keep the film�s target audience (i.e., those still quoting The Wedding Crashers
) within their comfort zone. It�s an awkward mix that culminates in a drawn-out, by-the-numbers conclusion where Dupree saves the day and everyone ends up ecstatic with their position in life. Not that the film needed to head into darker territory, but sidestepping even half of the clich�s of the final act might have kept the film from feeling so uneven and disposable. But, as far as disposable entertainment goes, it gets the job done.


In some relationships, a moment arrives when you look over at your boo and think, ``Why do I love you again?" After watching Owen Wilson as a shiftless bum in ``You, Me and Dupree," his tedious new sitcom of a movie, I'm prepared to dump him.
A few years ago, Wilson's lazy approach to Hollywood comedy seduced me. He seemed so much smarter than the movies he was in, say ``Shanghai Knights" (2003) or ``Around the World in 80 Days" (2004). That stoned, sideways strategy suggested a man who knew how to play dumb without looking stupid. But what was so fresh just a few movies ago is now just shtick.
The thrill, for me, is gone, though it's not all Wilson's fault. The material here is bad (Michael Le Sieur wrote the script), and the careless direction, by Anthony and Joe Russo, shoves the action along. But the star, who's as whiny and impossibly blond as ever, is charmless.
Unofficially, ``You, Me and Dupree " is a companion piece to last summer's ``Wedding Crashers," a movie whose lunacy is desperately needed this summer. There, Wilson and Vince Vaughn invited themselves to strangers' receptions and poached the women. This movie's premise is a lot less inspired: He's crashing a marriage by himself.
Newlyweds Molly and Carl (Kate Hudson, Matt Dillon) agree to let Wilson's Dupree, who was Carl's best man, move into their nice suburban home after he loses what we can only assume is yet another job. His stuffed moose head, board game, and irritable bowel come with him. Soon a toilet overflows, and a bathroom is fouled up (and not the one with the runny toilet, either). Dupree has the guys over to watch football, serves nachos on an heirloom tray, and sets the living room on fire during a date. None of this prompts an eviction. In fact, there's more where that came from.
Maybe we're meant to find an aimless, jobless 36-year-old couch-surfer appealing. But during and after every transgression, he just stands there oblivious. When a 13-year-old futzes around with the outgoing voice-mail message, brazenly orders HBO, or breaks into your secret porn stash, it's obnoxious. When a guy over three times his age does it -- then reacts like a 13-year-old -- it's grounds for a shrink. Still, the movie tries to force us into believing that Dupree is a free spirit, not a loon.
For comparison, we're shown Carl toiling thanklessly for his wicked father-in-law, a big-time land developer played by Michael Douglas. These sections of the movie are like ``The Devil Wears Today's Man." With Douglas and Wilson, Dillon does comic exasperation surprisingly well, but Wilson requires a counter-puncher both to keep him in line and egg him on. He needs Vince Vaughn. Otherwise, there's no mischief.
Dupree isn't even ambitious enough to make a move on Molly or to confess that he's been in love with Carl all these years. Only in America could a movie called ``You, Me and Dupree" not culminate in some sort of three-way.
This year Hollywood has given us feeble men who evade adulthood. Matthew McConaughey wouldn't leave the nest in ``Failure to Launch." Adam Sandler uses a magic remote control to make his problems go away in ``Click." And Superman has returned from wherever, lacking the gumption to tell Lois Lane he loves her.
Wilson is the most intolerable of all. Watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didn't like Dupree. I wanted him deported.


         In the movies, letting someone crash on the couch is usually step one on the ruinous road to loss of privacy, destruction of personal property, family strife and at least one fire. And the studiously by-the-book houseguest comedy "You, Me and Dupree" leaves nothing out. When Dupree (Owen Wilson) loses his job, his apartment and his car after flying to Hawaii to be the best man at his friend Carl's wedding (he forgot to tell his boss), Carl (Matt Dillon) and his schoolteacher bride, Molly (Kate Hudson), soon find themselves sharing their love nest.
 
  Having been down this road before, plot-wise, we've come to expect something more from the interloper than just crazy antics and slovenly personal habits. We expect that he be a certifiable nut-job or at least a non-ejectable member of the family. Dupree, though, is neither — he's just a watered-down amalgam of past Owen Wilson roles (played by Wilson) who spends his aimless days mechanically spouting homilies and pep talks; a mop-haired, pop-psyched man-child apparently raised by some wild development executives: Follow-your-heart-and-just-be-yourself guy.
 


         






    Carl, an ambitious real estate developer married to his boss' daughter, seems to have outgrown Dupree even before the movie begins. He indulges Dupree and tries to honor their past friendship — but you can tell the guy makes him uncomfortable. The thing is, we're with Carl. There's not much that's charming about Dupree, despite the movie's dogged insistence that he's a lovable guy. He's a creepy, occasionally tragic, loser (in one scene, he unintentionally talks a manager at Levitz out of hiring him, realizes what he's done and quietly wraps up the interview), and there's something manipulative and narcissistic about his compulsive, self-induced failure.
 
  It used to be Chris Elliott played characters like him, only we didn't root for him. These days, what with the emergent "rejuveniles" and all, we're supposed to admire Dupree for his childlike sense of wonder and his magical ability to charm neighborhood children, promiscuous librarians and mean executives wherever he goes. He's the sucker whisperer. Dillon, meanwhile, looks pained — for some people, relating to the developmentally challenged can be an uncomfortable thing.
 
  Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo from a script by Mike LeSieur, "You, Me and Dupree" doesn't aspire to be much more than a serviceable summer comedy, and the script displays the engineered precision of a theme park ride.
 
  After dutifully crossing every item on the couch-surfer's not-to-do list— inviting the guys over for a game, ordering cable, etc. — Dupree learns a valuable life lesson the hard way, turns heel and begins his ascent to redemption as the world's greatest houseguest.
 
  Suddenly, the guy who was clogging the downstairs toilet is a poet, chef, handyman and sage. He wins Molly's indulgence, then her affection, then the affection of her intractable father (Michael Douglas), who has unaccountably dedicated his life to making Carl miserable. Carl, naturally, isn't happy about any of it. So Dupree makes it his job to re-wrought what he has torn asunder.
 
  Not that the movie knows it, but in a way Dupree is like the worst-case scenario version of what might have become of "Bottle Rocket's" Dignan had he dropped his 50-year plan and starting smoking lots of pot. The bad news isn't that this Wilson character has failed to flower into a productive member of society but that he seems to have been coddled into remaining an ossified parody of the lunatic dreamer he was.
 
  The tone of "You, Me and Dupree" is smarmy in that institutional way that doesn't seem to know what the tongue is doing in the cheek, exactly, but keeps it there just in case. This tone would suggest there's some irony at work here — especially at the end when Dupree puts his dubious skills to work. Maybe his unlikely turnaround is some kind of a sarcastic retort to the idea that this sort of thing ever happens. But it's hard to pinpoint who the joke is on, exactly. Judging from the final scene, you'd have to be a sucker to listen to the guy in the first place.   

Remember the shaggy-haired stoner, all fog-brained earnestness and Valley boy dude-speak? How about the corporate weasel, who hid his killer moves beneath a heat shield of mock-gregarious ''Hey, guy!'' irony? Put the two together, and you have Owen Wilson, a slacker for the cutthroat age.
With his surf-bum hair, his broken nose, and that voice that seesaws up and down, grinding out each word with cracked, pained sincerity, as if he were trying to talk while holding in a bong hit, Wilson has always led with his sexy-foolish, natural-man charm. Yet if the voice is baked, the mind is clear, and it's working overtime, usually for himself. In Wedding Crashers , he was perfectly cast as a scoundrel who used his soulful ''honesty'' to hustle women into bed, telling them what they wanted to hear. His actions may have been deplorable, but what made them so funny was that the romantic lies seemed to trickle right out of Wilson's good nature; it's as if he lived to please, and couldn't help that everything happened to work out his way in the process. No wonder Owen Wilson is a star: He's the first actor of his generation to turn innocence into sleaze, then back into innocence again.
From the moment Wilson appears as the free-spirited screwup of You, Me and Dupree  (yes, he's Dupree), landing in a yellow prop plane in Hawaii, the movie uses his crooked smile and craftier-than-it-looks faux doofishness as a subtle form of one-upmanship. Dupree is set to be the best man at the wedding of Carl (Matt Dillon), a land-development executive who's his oldest pal, and Molly (Kate Hudson), a sunny grade-school teacher. The two enjoy an idyllic wedding, but back home, before they have a moment to savor their lives as newlyweds, in walks Dupree, toting a moose head and a ukulele (are you laughing yet?), desperate for a place to crash after losing his job and his apartment. It isn't his fault, of course  nothing ever is  but we can see that he's the sort of infantile, moonstruck underachiever who can't get a career going because, deep down, he doesn't want one. He just wants to drink beer and eat nachos and watch a big TV and pretend he never has to grow up.
You, Me and Dupree  isn't a very funny movie (it preaches nonconformity in the rote style of an overlit sitcom), but Wilson, at least, keeps it afloat. The shrewdness of his performance is that he makes Dupree adorable and overbearing at the same time, so that you can't separate the two. Carl and Molly start out united in their disdain for Dupree's benignly reckless, me-first antics: the sight of his bare butt poking out from the rumpled couch covers, his ordering of premium cable TV, the fact that he seduces the librarian at Molly's school  a nice girl! a Mormon!  by doing nasty things with butter on the first date right in their living room, just before he accidentally sets the place on fire. Before long, though, his hedonistic indolence begins to cast its spell. As a man in his 30s who still lives like a couch-potato jock out of college, Dupree is destined to be likened to such recent child-man slobs as Matthew McConaughey in Failure to Launch  and Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up . But whatever observations the movie has to make regarding the Gen-X tendency toward arrested development, what we're really watching is a less witty version of What About Bob? , with Dupree as the innocent invader who's been placed on earth to drive Carl, the humorlessly toiling, overly rational middle-class breadwinner, crazy.
As Dupree, a saintly pest, lets his charm flow over Molly (he even writes poems), inviting her to enjoy life in a way that her systematic husband can't, he becomes Carl's nightmare: the slacker id who succeeds by doing nothing, seducing the world simply by letting it pass by. You, Me and Dupree  is a three-headed comedy in which the situation really goes all the way back to Green Acres , where poor, uptight Oliver Douglas was driven to frothing fits by his wife's fondness for the loopy neighbors he couldn't abide. If only this movie were half as hilarious.
You, Me and Dupree  would have had more bite, more comic anger, if it didn't stack the deck by giving Carl an external reason for losing his grip: His boss is his father-in-law (Michael Douglas, clenching his teeth as if they were receiving radio signals), who happens to take a psychotic delight in abusing him. Matt Dillon is miscast anyway  by temperament, he's close enough to slacker nonchalance that we don't quite buy him as a yuppie control freak. The joke, of course, is that it's really Owen Wilson who's in control. He can't play the dazed rogue forever, but for now he's the happy master of that domain.

 THE movies have long nurtured the arrested development of the American male, serving as a virtual playpen for legions of slobbering big babies for whom Peter Pan isn’t a syndrome but a way of life. Where once Lou Costello’s roly-poly cheeks shuddered as violently as a milk-starved newborn in “Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man,” Vince Vaughn’s jowls now tremble excitedly in “Wedding Crashers.” The difference being, of course, that while Costello  had only Abbott, Mr. Vaughn conquers vixens and virgins alike with his signature mix of alpha-male braggadocio and thumb-sucker hunger.  And what of Owen Wilson, Mr. Vaughn’s partner in booty call from “Wedding Crashers,” the smooth operator with the zigzag nose who’s looking to score again this week with a trifle called “You, Me and Dupree”? This time Mr. Wilson’s partner in bad-boy crime is Matt Dillon, providing yeoman straight-man support as Dupree’s best friend, Carl, whose new marriage to Molly (Kate Hudson) puts a kink in the men’s friendship. Will Carl and Dupree remain tight? Will Carl and Molly do the same after Dupree moves in and almost burns down their house? Will it all end happily after the poop jokes, pratfalls and modest disturbances? Are you kidding? Will you laugh anyway? Possibly. Loudly? Not so much.  Fans of the director Wes Anderson know Mr. Wilson as the writing partner on his best films — “Bottle Rocket,” “Rushmore,” “The Royal Tenenbaums” — as well as one of his most important on-camera collaborators. Mr.  Wilson’s brother, the actor Luke Wilson, wore his heart on his hospital togs in “The Royal Tenenbaums,” and eventually secured both the beautiful girl and a melancholically happy ending. But as crucial to the film’s emotional and psychological texture was Owen Wilson’s turn as a drug-addled writer of purple-sage prose fated to unwittingly stick pins in his own pomposity. Mr. Anderson was clearly the artistic genius in residence, but it was Owen Wilson who helped make sure the air they breathed never became too rarefied.  With his beach-bum good looks and an instantly recognizable twang suggestive of easy and high times, Mr. Wilson has in recent years become something of an unexpected if modest star. Although he has taken on serious roles — a serial killer in one film, a downed fly boy in another — he often plays Zen masters and slackers with more than a passing resemblance to Spicoli, the stoner-surfer played by Sean Penn in “Fast Times at Ridgemont High.” The shocks of blond and the broken beaks are the obvious points of comparison, but there’s something of Spicoli, the eternal teenager, in Mr. Wilson’s characterizations, too. Now 37, he has found success splashing in the shallow end of the pool alongside Vince, Ben, Will, Jack and the other boy-men of modern Hollywood comedy.  “All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz and I’m fine,” Spicoli explains in “Fast Times.” Dupree doesn’t say anything nearly as memorable (the writer is Michael Le Sieur, earning his first big-screen credit), though he embodies a similar hang-10 vibe. The film actually opens in Hawaii with a blowout wedding paid for by Molly’s creepily overprotective father, whom Michael Douglas tries and fails to make funny. Soon after, Dupree moves in with the newlyweds and proceeds to stink up the bathroom, among other offenses. More entertainingly, he woos a lady friend by serving up Tone Loc’s ridiculous hit “Funky Cold Medina” with a large helping of butter, an amusing bit that, like most of the setups, is soon lost amid too much choreographed mayhem.  There are several problems with “Dupree,”  not least that there is no filmmaking to speak of, just a progression of competent-looking scenes in which the actors appear to have successfully hit their marks. The  directors, the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, have made a few other features, including “Welcome to Collinwood,” an unnecessary redo of “Big Deal on Madonna Street” that nonetheless looked like someone was paying attention to the lighting and how objects and bodies fit in the frame, which isn’t the case here. That said, they do manage to shoot Ms. Hudson most attractively in a fantasy sequence that finds her promenading in a bikini, thus fulfilling her primary function in the film as a decorative accessory.  Despite Ms. Hudson’s itsy-bitsy bikini and that dollop of butter, “You, Me and Dupree” remains a limp attempt to wed a romantic comedy to a buddy comedy, largely because the filmmakers see women as visitors from another planet, which is more or less what they now are in Hollywood. Not surprisingly, as is often the case with comedies like this, the important love in the film — the one that dares not speak its name, but compels the guys to toss  around the word “homo” so  no one gets the wrong idea — isn’t between a man and woman, but two male friends. Considering that Molly comes off as such a killjoy, clucking and scolding and nagging like mom, you understand why Carl and Dupree might want to sneak off — so do we.  “You, Me and Dupree” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild adult language and sexual innuendo.

Three's a pleasant enough crowd in "You, Me and Dupree," a middling third-wheel comedy elevated a couple of notches by the ineffably weird charms of Owen Wilson. Proceeding from a conventional easy-laugh premise -- a pair of newlyweds� forced to put up with an obnoxious houseguest -- pic sidesteps the potential gross-out monotony of its setup by heading in an unexpected and dramatically effective direction, though rarely eliciting more than a chuckle along the way. Still, the strong cast and genial execution should have broad demographic appeal, making this a welcome (and financially self-supporting) lodger in Universal's summer house.
Land developer Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon) would seem to have a great life: He's just married a beautiful schoolteacher, Molly (Kate Hudson), received a hefty promotion at work, and moved into a classy suburban neighborhood. Unfortunately, his new home is about to be crashed and partially immolated by his best friend, Randy Dupree (Wilson), an affable blond bum who has just been fired and evicted and has nowhere else to go.
Predictably, Dupree's "temporary" stay leads to all sorts of unwanted (and sporadically amusing) shenanigans involving skateboard accidents, clogged toilets and some involuntary coitus interruptus, as when Molly walks in on Dupree and his new girlfriend re-enacting a scene from "Last Tango in Paris." To their credit, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (helming their second feature after the heist comedy "Welcome to Collinwood") don't overdo the sight gags and keep up a fairly swift pace from one pratfall to the next.
As Molly's patience with Dupree wears thin, Carl faces even bigger problems with his boss, Mr. Thompson, who also happens to be his new father-in-law (Michael Douglas, last seen with Dillon in "One Night at McCool's"). Thompson barely conceals his contempt for Carl, undermining his projects and making insulting suggestions that he adopt Molly's last name and undergo a vasectomy.
Merely the latest addition to Douglas' roster of rich, tyrannical CEOs, Thompson is an all-too-convenient villain who turns Carl into an irritable crank, forcing Molly to seek comfort from an unlikely source. As Dupree cleans up his act, he morphs from accident-prone nuisance into lovable substitute husband -- a reversal that, as worked out in Mike LeSieur's screenplay and played by Wilson, comes off as surprisingly canny.
Wilson's amiable slacker charm masks a wholly alert sense of comic delivery and, crucially, a knowledge of how to play annoying without annoying the audience. The character Dupree is smarter and more complicated than he looks -- selfish but selfless, irresponsible but resourceful, clueless but sensitive, mediocre but inspiring. Much of the pic's humor originates from the sheer silliness of Wilson's appearance; few thesps can wear a pastel-purple bandana with such imperturbable conviction.
Offering solid support are Dillon, whose suggestion of an underlying rage makes him an ideal straight man; and Hudson, whose Molly is almost too sweet, sensible and sexy to be true. Seth Rogen ("The 40 Year Old Virgin") also makes a potent impression as Carl's even more obnoxious friend Neil, offering an ugly alternate view of married life.
If the Russos demonstrate a skill for directing actors, their sense of resolution isn't at the same level. After several third-act stabs at humor that fall flat -- including a violent chase sequence that goes on far too long -- pic belabors its conclusion with a series of face-to-face reconciliations that feel obligatory.
A random appearance by Harry Dean Stanton as a local drunk suggests the actor's best scenes -- along with his reason for appearing in the first place -- were left on the cutting-room floor. Lance Armstrong also has a cameo that's decidedly inferior to his work in "Dodgeball."

Owen Wilson  has moved up in the world: He's gone from crashing weddings to crashing entire marriages. In this listless farce, his eponymous thirtysomething ne'er-do-well takes up residence on the sofa of a childhood best friend (Matt Dillon ) and his newlywed bride (Kate Hudson ), wreaking the kind of comic havoc that will catch only the most nearsighted of audience members by surprise. Played by Wilson at the end of his stoner-doofus tether, Dupree walks around in the nude, backs up the toilet, barges in on his friends having sex, and for an encore, nearly burns the whole house down. Then, after an hour or more of these tiresome houseguest-from-hell antics, directors Anthony and Joe Russo  try to turn Dupree into a kind of enlightened mystica slacker Sufiimmune from the emasculating effects of marriage and grown-up responsibility. At which point the movie goes from being another mildly depressing lump of unrealized comic potential to being an actively unpleasant experience.
