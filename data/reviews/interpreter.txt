The Interpreter
 is touted as the first commercial movie to shoot inside the United Nations, which means that this thriller is blessed with a truly incredible set-piece. The movie also toplines two of the best actors around � Kidman and Penn � who, along with director Pollack (he also appears in a minor role), are both bona fide Oscar winners. By all measures, The Interpreter
 should be one of the sharpest movies around, but it is not. It is intelligent, intriguing, and topical, but it too often gets mired in its own good intentions, too many plot convolutions, and character ambiguities that try to pass for suspense. The Interpreter
 tries to cast itself in the Hitchcockian tradition of Secret Agent
 and The Man Who Knew Too Much
, but apart from the film�s climactic bus sequence and another nicely crafted sequence toward the movie�s end, this thriller never visually builds much tension or suspense. Instead, the intrigue stems mostly from the two central characters, whose distrust of each other deepens as they withhold important aspects of themselves from each other. Silvia Broome (Kidman) is an interpreter at the UN who accidentally overhears a death threat against a genocidal African tyrant who is due to speak in the General Assembly the following week. He is from the fictional country of Matobo, and the threat is spoken in the Ku language (also fictional), which just happens to be one of Silvia�s proficiencies. Penn plays Tobin Keller, a Secret Service agent who Silvia at first mistakenly believes has come to provide protection. But no, she is a suspect too, and further inexplicable actions on her part further promote that idea. There are enough threads and plot twists here for several movies and it seems the script retains equitable remnants of the original screenplay by Charles Randolph (The Life of David Gale)
 and the rewrites by Scott Frank (Out of Sight)
 and Steve Zaillian (Schindler�s List)
 each. The Interpreter
 also pauses for lovely speeches about the peaceful mission of the UN (not wholly unwelcome in this UN-deflating day and age, but nevertheless hindrances to the film�s momentum). Kidman and Penn make an interesting pair � she so coolly intellectual, he so spontaneously visceral, and while they are always interesting to watch onscreen, The Interpreter
 will not be remembered as either�s best work. Keener (Being John Malkovich)
 is sadly underused in the role of Keller�s wise-cracking partner. The Interpreter
 is ultimately fluent in many things, but an out-and-out thriller it is not.


The best intentions have a way of producing the worst movies.
''The Interpreter," a righteous but wrongheaded thriller, chokes on its well-meant outrage and leaves a moth-eaten plot and handful of nonsense characters on its way to a dopey finish. This is a Hollywood potboiler, with Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, about African genocide that's set in and around the real United Nations headquarters.
As directed by Sydney Pollack, the estimable man behind ''Tootsie," ''Out of Africa," and ''The Firm," the movie is so slick that it should probably be out chasing ambulances instead of preaching in multiplexes.
This is one of those pictures whose intrigue is bound up in the nightmares of a little, made-up country whose fictional status is meant to say something sweeping about injustice while giving the filmmakers license to do whatever they want on its soil. The pseudo-republic is a southern African hotbed called Matobo, a land with political crises that are an ambiguous stew of the troubles plaguing several actual African nations: ethnic cleansing roiling under a tyrant's nose. (Matobo happens to be the name of Zimbabwe's national park.)
The fictitious country's plight comes into our view when a faulty metal detector forces a complete evacuation of the UN. Hours later, Silvia Broome (Kidman), an African-born translator who happens to be fluent in the Matoban dialect of Ku, goes back to fetch a bag she left in a sound booth. There she overhears what she believes is a plot to assassinate Matobo's leader, President Edmund Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), who is on his way in to give a redemption speech intended to save himself from prosecution for crimes against humanity.
Needless to say, Silvia is spotted, and as the plot thickens her life is in ever-worsening jeopardy. You know the drill: mysterious phone calls, mysterious break-ins at her homey-chic apartment, a mysterious black town car hounding poor Silvia on her Vespa along clogged Manhattan avenues.
But for all this mysteriousness, little is more mysterious than Silvia herself. Eventually, she's placed in the protective custody of Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn), who almost immediately begins digging around in Silvia's past and turns up one incriminating tidbit after the next. There she is marching with the rebel leader Ajene Xola (Curtiss I'Cook) in what looks like a picture that was doctored in Photoshop, but never mind: Something doesn't wash about this woman.
Once she demands that an agent drive her out to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where she hops on a bus with another anti-Zuwanie leader, ''The Interpreter" loses its mind and never quite recovers it. (Nicole Kidman waiting for the bus is the stuff of science fiction.)
Still, that sequence is Pollack at his most muscularly suspenseful. You know it's strong because even after it's over and none of it makes sense, you're still aware of how riveted you have been.
But the movie has a lot of explaining to do, and none of its alibis are all that persuasive. The screenplay is credited to Steve Zaillian, Scott Frank, and Charles Randolph, three men who have a mixed bag of titles among them, including ''Schindler's List," ''Out of Sight," and the execrable ''Life of David Gale," respectively. Presumably, they didn't collaborate, and even if they did the movie seems piecemeal, particularly where Penn's character is concerned.
Agent Keller is that grieving, skeptical yet dutiful agent we've seen so many times before. He's mourning the loss of his ex-wife, but only because the character needs to be sympathetic enough that we don't feel too manipulated when he holds Silvia in his lap after she confesses her own bereavement. Aside from some occasionally prickly banter, Penn has nothing interesting to do with Kidman or with Catherine Keener, who turns up as his partner, sporting her typical arid sarcasm and some unusually ill-fitting pantsuits.
Casting Kidman is the movie's only great stroke of inspiration -- up to a point. She wears mystery as naturally as Marilyn Monroe wore her mole. Her milkiness and opacity serve her well here. The less we know about Silvia (her political, familial, and sexual past) the sharper the performance is. But once the movie has unraveled her back story and collapsed, single-mindedly, into a bathtub of melodrama and bathos, the character seems less like a woman and more like a blunt political instrument.
All the movie's authenticity seems to have been spent getting permission to film at the UN, which Pollack and his crew, to their credit, capture as a nearly living organism that merely puts up with humanoids racing around it. But the production's bid for realism leaves most of the African people stranded. We meet lots of corrupt and murderous black Matobans but not a single conventionally decent one, which leaves the film with a gaping credibility problem in the racial-representation department. (In fact, Randolph recently told Entertainment Weekly that he wanted a white actress to play Silvia to demonstrate that not all white Africans are racists.)
''The Interpreter" is about the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of black Africans, whose murders Silvia is forced, alas, to interpret. Kidman becomes the face of genocide, and I'm dismayed to report that atrocity has never looked so lovely.


         "The Interpreter" is a good film that would very much like to be better, but that was not to be. While it would be a mistake to devalue the qualities director Sydney Pollack and stars Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn bring to this complex political thriller, that's not the same as saying it is completely successful.
 
  A canny veteran whose directing career began 40 years ago, Pollack (whose résumé includes 1975's similarly themed "Three Days of the Condor") brings the kind of burnished professionalism to his films that is on the way to becoming one of Hollywood's lost arts.
 


         






    In Kidman and Penn, Pollack has actors who can add credibility to standard lines and melodramatic situations, an asset that is especially useful for what is basically a B picture scenario with A picture aspirations.
 
  Kidman plays Silvia Broome, a native of the mythical African country of Matobo, now working for the United Nations in New York as one of those word wizards who sit high up in glass booths and coolly translate while delegates pontificate on the General Assembly floor. The actress, always the chameleon, manages to be appropriately geeky (but in a glam way) as one of the idealistic worker bees who keep the U.N. functioning.
 
  In the kind of venerable plot device beloved by screenwriters (of which "Interpreter" has more than its share), Silvia just happens to be in her booth late one night when she overhears a sentence in Matobo's equally mythical Ku language. "The Teacher," a man says, "will never leave this room alive."
 
  Silvia not only understands the words, she knows what they mean. The Teacher is Matobo's aging tyrant, President Edmund Zuwanie, who is scheduled to come to the U.N. to respond to charges of genocide. As its "Who Wants to Kill a Great Despot of Africa" plot kicks in, Silvia is placed in the care of federal agents Tobin Keller (Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener).
 
  If Keener has all the film's funny lines ("Ma'am, please don't touch the prime minister," she says as only she can to an overeager lap dancer hovering over another head of state), it falls to Penn to capably play the stern, no-nonsense operative who is dealing with a personal crisis as well as the looming assassination plot.
 
  The collision of Kidman and Penn's characters — guess what, they don't initially get along — is one of the advertised lures of "The Interpreter," with the director saying in the press notes that he was looking for "oil and water, sandpaper and silk." Not surprisingly, when the script calls for the agent and the interpreter to be mutually mistrustful and spar verbally about grief, vengeance and the like, their antipathy is convincing. So convincing, in fact, that their inevitable rapprochement, their deepening emotional connection, feels like it takes place only because it's mandated by the script.
 
  This inability to deliver completely on its aims is one of the drawbacks of "The Interpreter," a defect possibly due to the fact that so many credited (and likely some uncredited) writers were used it may have been difficult to get them all on the same page, so to speak.
 
  In addition to a screenplay by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian, based on a story by Martin Stellman and Brian Ward, the film seems to be crediting yet another source when it offers the following enigmatic acknowledgment: "With the help of 'The Interpreter' by Suzanne Glass." In this case, the more is definitely not the merrier, even with some of the best writers in the business as part of the team.
 
  While recently successful political thrillers like "The Bourne Identity" and its sequel concentrated on being the best nail-biters possible, "The Interpreter," with an interest in being a serious drama, sacrifices tension in a search for something nobler that it is unable, finally, to pull off.
 
  But though "The Interpreter" doesn't crackle with tension as much as it might, it does have the kind of intelligence and concern with real-world political issues (for instance, its savvy dissection of the political rivalries in poor benighted Matobo) that are valuable in political melodramas.
 
  Typical of this concern, on a production level, is the way Pollack's perseverance led to "The Interpreter" being the first film to receive authorization to shoot inside the U.N. building in Manhattan. (Even Alfred Hitchcock had to make do with a mock-up in a key scene from "North by Northwest.")
 
  Equally impressive, in a time when the U.N. has turned into everyone's favorite punching bag as well as an institution the U.S. seems to be in the process of disowning, is the film's implicit plea for this organization as the best way to deal with the world's difficulties.
 
  Yes, this could be a better film, but the good qualities it does have are rare enough to hold our interest on screen and off.

One needn't be a delegate to eat at the Delegates Dining Room in the United Nations and enjoy one of Manhattan's great unadvertised pleasures. Advance reservations, passport security clearance, and appropriate dress will do to admit a visitor into an elegant, affordable lunchtime adventure that may be the closest a nonemployee will ever get to experiencing the daily hum of ritual, mystery, diplomacy, and bureaucracy with which the world's deliberative body has held together in imperfect harmony for 60 years.
Or you could watch The Interpreter , an elegant adventure of a different kind: Among its many accomplishments, this capacious and worldly drama directed by Sydney Pollack is a serious invitation  a mature filmmaker's exhortation, really  for Americans to engage globally even while seeking local entertainment. (In this regard, the man who made Three Days of the Condor  and The Firm  is back where his heart lies, in the realm of crisp, engrossing dramas about power.) It's also an old pro's demonstration of how a politically relevant big-release flick can still effectively be done, old school  not snazzily, by no means perfectly (what with popcorn conventions grafted onto matters of current events), but squarely, in the best, most adult sense of the word.
In setting a thriller about explosive politics to the rhythms of moderation  the beat of the U.N. itself, in all its sober and sometimes maddening temperateness  Pollack chooses the unusual architecture of making the actual corridors, crannies, and cool modernist expanses of the United Nations the star of the show. The human luminaries Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are mere mortals in proportion, their characters' overplotted and intertwined personal and professional anguish a light distraction from the affecting themes at hand.
And the change of scale is tonic for both of them. Kidman applies her essential, milk-tinted stillness to the role of Silvia Broome, the sad, estranged daughter of the unstable, fictional African country of Matobo. She holds the title job despite a political activist past (and, it quickly emerges, present) that might eliminate a less ethereally stylish-looking candidate from the job. In her microphone booth after hours one day, she overhears something  she says it's a death threat against the oppressive Matoban head of state due to give a speech to the General Assembly  and when she's spotted, her life is put in danger. It is perhaps inevitable that Tobin Keller (Penn), the federal agent assigned to check her story, is himself a man of constant sorrows, or that despite uneasy suspicion about his charge's own involvement in the plot, Tobin finds himself drawn to Silvia's brand of hurting.
It is less of a given that Penn's concentrated intensity  volatility pulled inward  should work so brilliantly against Kidman's soft inaccessibility, her daintily careful African accent of indeterminate provenance. The unusual pairing of powerhouses, both skilled at intelligent risk-taking in the line of Hollywood duty, results in a strong partnership that overcomes the plot's twitchy insistence on complications above and beyond the call of a movie about revolution, political activism, and an all-too-believable climate of terrorism. And Pollack, working with cinematographer Darius Khondji, shoots the stars with a kind of grandeur, lighting and setting them with grave regard for their wattage. (Catherine Keener, outstanding in a subtle, serious performance as Tobin's partner, receives similar A-game treatment.)
The Interpreter  argues for a lot of things  too many. The story advocates the power of words over more lethal weaponry (Silvia speaks eloquently about the precision of language, explaining to Tobin that ''if dead and gone were the same thing, there'd be no U.N.''), but pays attention to the desperation that can lead a populace to guns. The script (a relay-team effort, as emphasis and world events, including 9/11, changed the project's focus over its long years in development) honors the importance of the U.N. in a way no permission-to-film-granting authority could fault, but still captures the obtuseness that is as much an institutional trademark as the contours of its famous buildings.
The film's hodgepodge agenda doesn't, though, matter in the end, and neither do the position speeches about everything from grief (Tobin is an alarmingly fresh widower) to protocol in the General Assembly, inserted  between bouts of cat-and-mouse action. What does signify, and what builds with unexpected poignancy, is the movie's expression of love  for an authentic New York City so fondly photographed, for a U.N. so remarkable in its very existence, however complicated, and for people trying to work things out in a civilized way. The alternative, The Interpreter  makes very clear, cannot be interpreted as anything other than disaster.

ilvia Broome is not just an employee of the United Nations, where she works as an interpreter. She is also a passionate believer in its goals and ideals, and holds fast to the conviction that it offers the best hope for addressing the violence and corruption running rampant across the globe. When she explains this to Tobin Keller, a Secret Service agent assigned to protect her from a sinister conspiracy (and also to investigate her possible involvement in it), he responds with a smirk. "You've had a tough year," he says. And that is pretty much the only contact that "The Interpreter," a glossy new picture directed by Sydney Pollack, makes with the world as we know it. This kind of movie, stuffed with intimations of faraway strife and people in suits talking frantically on cellphones and walkie-talkies, is conventionally described as a political thriller, but "The Interpreter" is as apolitical as it is unthrilling. A handsome-looking blue-chip production with a singularly impressive Oscar pedigree, it disdains anything so crude, or so risky to its commercial prospects, as a point of view. The role of the United Nations in the face of shifting geopolitical alliances and ferocious ethnic conflicts is a rich and complicated topic, as a glance at the past few weeks' newspapers will confirm, but none of that complexity troubles the shiny surface of this film, which is mainly interested in the United Nations as a piece of architecture. It should be said that the organization's headquarters building on First Avenue at 44th Street in Manhattan is beautifully shot, both from without and within. Darius Khondji's cinematography captures the clean, elegant modernism that at once expresses the building's idealistic purpose and places it in a bygone era of internationalist optimism. Making the United Nations look good is easy compared to the movie's main imaginative ambition, which is to turn Nicole Kidman, apotheosis of all that is blond in Hollywood today, into the embodiment of African suffering. Silvia, Ms. Kidman's character, may have a European education, but her roots are in the troubled (and fictional)  African nation of Matobo, where her parents were white farmers. Lest we think that she was therefore aligned with apartheid or colonial oppression - "The Interpreter" is not, after all, Mr. Pollack's sequel to "Out of Africa," or at least not quite - we see old photographs of Silvia and her brother bearing arms in a noble multiracial cause. She is fond of quoting the wisdom of the Ku, a tribe whose views on vengeance and mourning are at odds with the grim state of her country. (The moral of "The Interpreter" is, in effect, do as the Ku say, not as the Ku do.) Matobo is ruled by one Dr. Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), a vaguely Mugabe-like figure who followed a familiar path from liberator to genocidal maniac, and who has squandered both the hopes of his people and the respect of the United Nations  member states. It is a measure of just how bad he is that both French and American diplomats agree that he should face some kind of justice, and also that his two main rivals - an old-school socialist (Curtiss I' Cook) and an apostle of capitalist development (George Harris)  - have put aside their differences to oppose him more effectively. As it happens, the dictator is on his way to New York to address the General Assembly, and Silvia, returning to the office to retrieve her African flutes, overhears someone plotting to kill him when he makes his speech. This strikes Tobin (Sean Penn) as too convenient to be entirely coincidental, and as he digs into Silvia's background he begins to suspect that she is more deeply enmeshed in Matobo's intrigue than she lets on. The great disappointment of the script is that it fudges the question of her involvement, leaving some gaping holes you can discuss with your friends at your favorite Matoban restaurant after the movie. More thought has gone into addressing the challenge of giving Mr. Penn something to do that couldn't be done by a second-string cop-show actor on television. To ensure that Silvia does not suffer alone, Tobin is provided with his own back story of grief and loss, which Mr. Penn must relate in tearful moments when the plot takes a break from third world misery. At first, Mr. Penn and Ms. Kidman, his brow as dramatically furrowed as hers is smooth, promise some interesting chemistry. Their first scene together has a brisk, parry-and-thrust rhythm, as Silvia, hiding behind a lock of hair gone strategically astray, frustrates Tobin's attempts to figure her out. But after that, nothing much happens. Ms. Kidman, as ever, nimbly switches between vulnerability and clever toughness while adding another unusual accent to her roster of achievements. Mr. Penn seems a bit more uncertain, burrowing with his characteristic earnestness into a role that hardly exists. From time to time, you may detect a wink of Brandoesque detachment, but more flagrant subversion would have turned this character from the pedestrian confection of a screenwriting committee into someone worth watching. That committee  - which included Steven Zaillian, who won an Oscar for "Schindler's List," and Scott Frank, nominated for "Out of Sight"  -  failed to come up with either a diverting whodunit or a plausible moral melodrama. Mr. Pollack's direction walks the line between competence and complacency. As the day of Dr. Zuwanie's arrival approaches, the pace of the narrative accelerates, the action moves from Turtle Bay to Crown Heights and something blows up. The two principals are driven by their respective hardships into a chaste moment of snuggling, and Tobin's partner, Dot, fires off some impatient wisecracks. Dot is played by Catherine Keener, a wonderful,  underused actress who, if there is any justice in Hollywood, will someday have her own chance to embody the sufferings of the African continent. "The Interpreter" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence and some profanity.

A genuine international thriller set almost entirely in New York City in and around the United Nations, "The Interpreter" is coolly absorbing without being pulse-quickening. A return by director Sydney Pollack, after the misfires of "Sabrina" and "Random Hearts," to the twisty suspense terrain of "Three Days of the Condor," the film is plot-heavy and superficially suffers from a lack of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn that is not inconsistent with their characters' interactions. Commercial prospects look reasonable rather than rousing.
No film, not even Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest," has ever been given permission to shoot at U.N. headquarters before (it reportedly took a personal meeting between Pollack and Kofi Annan to clinch the deal), and "The Interpreter" takes outstanding, but unostentatious, advantage of its opportunity to show off the nearly 60-year-old building in all its modernist splendor. The most recognizable room, the General Assembly, is also where the most decisive and extensive action takes place, but good use is also made of the Security Council, lobby, private rooms and outdoor courtyards as completely fresh locations for narrative drama.
The story, concocted by two scribes and fleshed out by three more, does not lack for contemporary relevance, even as it transplants the conflicts of a far-away region to America's doorstep. On balance, the structural machinations drive the characters, although its political orientation is liberally well-intended to highlight the plight of those -- in this case Africans -- suffering under murderous dictatorial regimes.
In a country one could be excused for imagining is Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe but is called Matobo, a five-minute pre-credits sequence has a white observer being shown dozens of rotting corpses at a dusty soccer stadium before being blown away by a pubescent boy with a very large gun. The man's photographer friend, waiting in a car, grabs a few pictures before escaping with his life.
It's an hour before we see the friend again or are led to hope we might learn what happened at the arena.
In the meantime, the pic takes up the life of U.N. translator Silvia Broome (Kidman), one of whose languages happens to be Ku; it's the dialect (concocted for the film) spoken in Matobo, where Silvia was raised. On an evening after a precautionary General Assembly evacuation, Silvia overhears a barely audible whisper in Ku threatening death to the Teacher, the nickname of Dr. Zuwanie, the genocidal longtime leader of Matobo, due to address the U.N. in a few days.
Brought in to assess Silvia's trustworthiness is Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn), a heavy-hooded fellow morose over his wife recently having flown the coop. Quickly pegging Silvia as a liar, Tobin has a number of measured, testy talks with the translator, who speaks with an accent that's British by way of southern Africa and is more easily rattled than most heroines in this era of self-assured bigscreen female role models.
Clearly, there is more than so agreeably meets the eye where the silky blonde Silvia is concerned, and it's little surprise that with her, as well as with nearly all the supporting characters, all roads lead back to Matobo and the nasty things that happened there. While Tobin, his world-weary associate Dot (Catherine Keener) and other feds peer into Silvia's apartment through binoculars and follow her all over New York, a number of other suspicious characters are shuffled into the mix, including Nils Lud (Jesper Christensen), Zuwanie's white security specialist; Kuman-Kuman (the vibrant George Harris), a Gotham-based opposition leader to Zuwanie; Jean Gamba (Byron Utley), a dangerous provocateur of mysterious allegiances, and Philippe (Yvan Attal), the photographer who can't cope with what went down at the soccer stadium but who brings some key information to the table.
Due to Silvia's hypertension and Tobin's mournful demeanor, the characters' dialogue exchanges have a hushed, tight-reined quality that keeps the proceedings at a relatively low temperature. With different casting, a romantic/erotic undercurrent might have been established between these two highly pressured individuals, which, without bubbling over, would still have given the drama an extra charge.
As enacted by Kidman and Penn, Silvia and Tobin seem like people who never would have gotten together under any circumstances. They're essentially opposites, and ones that don't attract. This fits all right with the story, but may frustrate general viewers on basic movie-movie terms.
Pollack nicely pulls off the two big set pieces, first a long, tense scene aboard a bus in Brooklyn that ends in shocking violence, then the assassination attempt on Zuwanie at the General Assembly indicated at the outset. A follow-up sequence is significantly marred dramatically when a central figure is unaccountably left alone and unprotected, and wrap-up is mealy-mouthed.
As always, Pollack's polished professionalism reps a significant pleasure in itself, and the presence of the U.N. front-and-center is a spectacle to behold. Darius Khondji's splendid widescreen lensing and Jon Hutman's production design are major bonuses, whereas James Newton Howard's score is too on-the-money in its emphasis on would-be suspense.
Her hair like corn threads and her skin the color of the moon, Kidman looks more youthful than she has in her last few pictures, and more fragile. Her seeming mastery of the invented Ku language (not to mention French) is duly impressive. Penn's usual volatility is suppressed as much as it's ever been.
Supporting cast members uniformly succeed in the important task of etching strong impressions so one can more or less remember who's who when multiple foreign names are rapidly rattled off. Earl Cameron, who portrays the reviled Dr. Zuwanie, may be remembered by buffs from his appearance 40 years ago in James Bond pic "Thunderball."

The Interpreter , Sydney Pollack 's reasonably effective and old-school geopolitical thriller, sets its prologue in the Zimbabwe -esque southern African state of Matobo, but it's a veritable Woody Allen  flick of New York City locations, unfolding mainly at the United Nations  while staging its most elaborate action calamity on a Brooklyn  bus.
Pollack, whose Three Days of the Condor  was a credible exercise in '70s political paranoia, handles the action with satisfying panache, although pyrotechnics ultimately take a back seat to histrionics. Nicole Kidman 's evasive translator of mystery is investigated by Sean Penn 's grimly brokenhearted federal agent once she overhears what might be a plot to assassinate Matobo's bloody tyrant when he addresses the General Assembly. More prim in this role than gorgeous, Kidman brings a plausible intensity to the role of a U.N. true believer with a hidden agenda. Her willingness to engage in personal diplomacy, even as a small army of cops pirouettes around the city discovering bombs and bodies, is a beacon of irrationality in a script whose occasional lack of clarity may have something to do with the efforts of five credited writers.
Given her résumé, the Kidman character is an exoticand even unlikelycreature, usefully fueling Penn's annoyed but fascinated incredulity. The principals don't exactly fall in lovetoo much of the movie is fueled by their antipathybut they have two showstopping scenes in which, maxing out on conviction, they suggest two star acting students thrown together to show their classmates how it's done. Adding to the Method flavor, Actors Studio alum Pollack casts himself as a sort of director, periodically popping into the action to advise Penn or explain that "we've got a credible threat." (The Interpreter  is a distant descendant of '30s Hitchcock films like Sabotage  and The 39 Steps does Pollack think that he's Hitchcock? For anyone who recognizes him, his cameos function as a genuine distraction.)
The Interpreter  is not only old-fashioned but unfashionableit flies in the face of U.S. unilateralism in giving the U.N. more glamour and credibility than at any time since the old trick-or-treat-for-UNICEF  days. Indeed, it's being heavily promoted as the first movie ever allowed to use U.N. interiors as a location. Not so: Hitchcock may have been denied permission for North by Northwest  in 1959 and DreamWorks  for The Peacemaker  in 1997, but 52 years ago, director Maxwell Shane  managed to use the unfinished U.N. building for the climax of The Glass Wall  .
A precursor of Spielberg's The Terminal  starring Vittorio Gassman  as a Hungarian concentration camp survivor attempting to illegally enter the U.S., this unusual left-liberal Cold War artifact (brought to my attention by Bill Horrigan  of the Wexner Center ) is rich with New York City locations. Not only is The Glass Wall  not anti-Communist, it offers the added kick of Gloria Grahame  as an exploited factory worker.
