Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov contrasts images of sweeping landscape and propulsive battle with potent scenes of emotional intimacy in Mongol , his quite grand, quite exotic, David Lean-style epic, a foreign-language Oscar nominee. Here are the early-12th-century days of Temudgin (Tadanobu Asano, from Japan), the brilliant military tactician who would become Genghis Khan, with emphasis on Temudgin's loving relationship with his wife (Khulan Chuluun, from Mongolia) and his frenemy relationship with his ''blood brother'' Jamukha (Honglei Sun, from China).

 “Mongol” — or, as I prefer to think of it, “Genghis Khan: The Early Years” — is a big, ponderous epic, its beautifully composed landscape shots punctuated by thundering hooves and bloody, slow-motion battle sequences.  Directed by the protean and prolific Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov (who wrote the script with Arif Aliyev), it is, among other things, a stubborn defense of old-fashioned, grand-scale moviemaking. (It is also an old-style international co-production financed by some fairly new players in world cinema, including companies in Kazakhstan and Mongolia.) Without irony or digital effects “Mongol,” the first installment in a planned trilogy, tells the story of a solitary man’s rise to a position of great power.  Mr. Bodrov follows his hero, a young warrior named Temudgin (played by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano), from boyhood to the eve of world conquest in 1206, when he would become the Genghis Khan known and feared by millions. There are some gaps in the narrative, but the portrait that emerges is of a reformer and a unifier, a leader who consolidates rival tribes and factions and who modernizes some of the traditional Mongol ways.  At his side in these efforts are a few allies and, above all, his wife, Borte (Khulan Chuluun), to whom he is betrothed as a child and to whom he remains loyal in spite of many setbacks and temptations. When she is kidnapped by marauding Merkits,  Temudgin musters a small army to bring her back, a mission that astonishes his friend Jamukha (Honglei Sun). “What Mongol ever went to war for a woman?” he wonders.  Jamukha, Temudgin’s blood brother and semicomic sidekick, eventually becomes his enemy for reasons that are somewhat obscured in the fog of Mongol custom and legend. But the two of them are nicely matched foils, with Jamukha’s levity and braggadocio dispelling some of the sober gloom that gathers around his friend.  “Mongol” moves solemnly across the decades, accumulating rich ethnographic detail and enough dramatic intrigue to sustain a viewer’s interest through the slower stretches. While it takes a sympathetic view of  young Genghis Khan — whose name, in the West, is a synonym for rapacity — it does not force him into conformity with modern sensibilities. His world feels authentically raw and refreshingly archaic, and also strangely beautiful.

Encompassing shifting tribal alliances, a love story for the ages and a sworn friendship transformed into enmity, �Mongol� traces the formative years of legendary warrior Genghis Khan. Spanning his life from age 9 in 1172 through 1206, when the feuding nomadic clans united under his leadership, this Central Asia-set historical epic from Russian helmer Sergei Bodrov (�Nomad�) boasts breathtaking landscapes, dazzling cinematography, bloody battles and unique traditions. The beautifully mounted actioner, the first entry in a proposed trilogy, should conquer auds in the khan�s former territories and, with savvy marketing, may also draw new blood to the film when Picturehouse releases it Stateside next year.
Shot on locations in Kazakhstan and the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, pic captures the nomadic lifestyle of the 12th century and the harsh climate and varying terrain of the Mongolian steppe, a place where a man�s not a man without a horse. It also introduces a strong, resourceful female character: Borte, first wife and lifelong adviser to the man born as Temudgin.
Opening in 1192, during one of many periods of captivity Temudgin suffered, the story flashes back 20 years to show him as a lad (Odnyam Odsuren) with his father Esugei (Ba Sen), a tribal leader. On the way to choose a bride from the fierce Merkit clan, the boy finds heart captured by spirited Borte (Bayartsetseg Erdenabat), and he selects her instead.
It�s a choice that changes Temudgin�s life forever. On the way home, his father is poisoned, and as soon as the funeral rites are complete, resentful follower Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) seizes power -- and the property of Temudgin�s family.
Tradition prevents Targutai from spilling the boy�s blood until he�s grown, so Temudgin becomes a fugitive. Alone on the snow-covered steppe, he meets tribal prince Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvinbayar), and the two become blood brothers.
Eventually, Temudgin is captured and escapes. When he�s captured again in 1186, he�s grown into a strong, defiant man (Tadanobu Asano).
After another escape, Temudgin obtains a horse and sets off to claim Borte (Khulan Chuluun). Their brief, tender idyll is interrupted by vengeance-seeking Merkits who kidnap Borte. With the help of blood brother Jamukha (Honglei Sun), Temudgin rescues Borte, but later, the blood brothers fall out and eventually end up at war with each other. 
Perfs by the multiethnic leads mesh well. Japanese indie idol Asano smolders as maverick Temudgin, charismatic Chinese thesp Sun brings some welcome humor to the role of Jamukha, and Mongolian non-pro Chuluun makes an adroit Borte. They�re nicely supported by a roster of Mongolian thesps in bit parts and an accomplished group of Kazakh and Kyrgyz stunt riders.
Vivid lensing by Sergey Trofimov and Rogier Stoffers lends needed momentum to the sprawling tale, particularly during the horse-mounted chases and battle sequences.
Spectacular production design by artist Dashi Namdakov and handsome folkloric costumes by Karin Lohr keep the pic easy on the eyes. Lush score by Tuomas Kantelinen is hauntingly supplemented with the ethno-folk stylings of Mongolian band Altan Urgan.
According to the press notes, pic was conceived as the first of three films designed to cover the entire lifetime of Genghis Khan. Opening credits on print caught in Toronto indicated title as �Mongol, Part 1.� 



You want a history lesson? Take a class. You want clanging swords, sneering villains, storybook romance, and bloody vengeance? Here's a brawny old-school epic to make the CGI tumult of 300 , Alexander , and Troy   look like sissy-boy slap parties. "Do not scorn the weak cub; he may become the brutal tiger," the opening title card reads, and Russian director Sergei Bodrov  (Prisoner of the Mountains ) shrewdly casts this reverent retelling of Genghis Khan : The Early Years  not as the rise of an emperor, but as a classic underdog tale. Using mostly real extras, stuntwork, and staggering locations, Bodrov recounts the 13th-century conqueror's path from childhood enslavement to tender lover, doting dad, all-around square dealer, and—oh yeah—builder of the Mongol Empire. As storytelling, aside from its unobtrusive flashback structure, the movie's as straight as the arrows that fly in close-up—a CGI trick that, like most of the movie's limited digital effects, is more effective for being seldom used. It's powered by a quietly commanding lead performance by Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano , and by the forceful evocation of its physical details: horses traversing a field of boulders, the heft of its bulky costumes. Last year's Academy Award  nominee from Kazakhstan  for Best Foreign Film, Mongol  is purportedly the first in a multi-film saga on the wrath of Khan; as such, it's probably the last thing you'd expect—great fun.
