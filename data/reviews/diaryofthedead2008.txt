Horror movie Rule #1: The only way to kill a zombie is to shoot it in the brain. George Romero himself laid this maxim down with his first film, the endlessly influential 1968 gutter classic "Night of the Living Dead." Forty years later, with "George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead," the venerable filmmaker has done something almost as startling: He has put brains back into the zombie genre.
This was not how it was supposed to go. Romero is 68, and his last film was 2005's "Land of the Dead," a love-it-or-hate-it studio film that felt oddly gutless despite the churning gore. Against expectations, the director has returned to the drawing board, producing "Diary" independently and rebooting the narrative back to the present day, when the undead are once more freshly with us. This time, though, the film's shot entirely through the lens of the characters' own video cameras.
Oh, yawn, more first-person horror? Another "Clo verfield Witch Project"? Not quite. "Diary of the Dead" explicitly wonders what's worse for your soul: becoming a flesh-eating corpse or hiding from the world behind a viewfinder. The movie plays like "Cloverfield" for grad students or anyone else up for a ruthless exegesis of our omnipresent media culture. In a world where reality exists only if someone's filming it, Romero has one character dare to ask, "What happens when no one's left to watch?"
All this, plus cheesy exploding heads. Refreshingly, "Diary" has a lean, mean low-budget thrust that delivers both the shocks and subversive implications of Romero's earliest work. The movie begins with a televised crime-scene news report that turns apocalyptic when the victims come back to life. We abruptly cut to a reality documentary, pompously titled "The Death of Death," that's being posted to the Web after supposedly having been shot by a Pittsburgh-area film student named Jason (Josh Close).
At first Jason is shooting his own fictional zombie movie in the woods, complete with panicked babe actress (Amy Lalonde), boozy film professor (Scott Wentworth) on the sidelines, and strict adherence to the Romero Rules. Then reports filter in about the real-life undead attacks in the cities, and the crew hits the road in their production van, aiming for the Scranton home of Jason's girlfriend, Debra (Michelle Morgan).
Now, the reason a point-of-view shot is so baseline efficient at generating suspense is that you never know what's going to go "Boo!" (or in this case "Urggghhhh") when the character holding the camera swivels around. "Diary" thus wrings the maximum screams from a visit to an eerily empty hospital, while a stopover with a deaf-mute Amish farmer named Samuel generates unexpected hilarity along with the expected zombie-scything.
As the body count increases and the film crew gets winnowed down, Romero illustrates society's response to Armageddon with his usual cold-eyed dyspepsia. We meet looters and jackals, some of them in Army uniforms. There's a band of African-American survivalists happy to be the Man for a change.
And there's the emergence of a resourceful, no-nonsense hero in Debra. Because she's not stuck behind a camera like her wimp boyfriend, she's free to deal with reality as it's happening. This mostly involves fleeing, shooting, cursing, and chopping. A lot of chopping. Jason, for his part, constantly has to stop and recharge - unlike Hud in "Cloverfield," he doesn't have a MagicCam - while uploading to the Internet on the fly. But, hey, he just got 72,000 hits in eight minutes, so he must be doing something right.
Debra's scorn for such Internarcissism is only outmatched by the filmmaker's, and if "Diary of the Dead" has a fault it's that Romero's outrage keeps turning didactic. He's a '60s radical at heart - check those survivalists - and his zombie films have always reflected our worst tendencies as a culture: consumerism, groupthink, a reliance on fascism when all else fails. You suspect his sympathies are really with the zombies, who after all have pretty basic needs (human flesh and an open field to stagger through). Hardcore horror junkies may nonetheless object to the fingerwagging here, or point out the irony of an anti-blogging screed itself having a healthy MySpace promotional page.
The meta-narrative of "Diary," meanwhile, patches into various video feeds as it goes - security cams, cellphones, yada yada - and we sense that Jason's editing it for maximum dramatic impact (and to make him look good: An argument with Debra neatly excises her half of the discussion). He expresses shock at the doctored news feeds broadcast by the mainstream media, but how's he any better? Romero says our urge to shape what we see deludes us into thinking we can control reality.
Heady stuff, especially when intercut with the guts spilling out of a mangled zombie. "Diary" acknowledges its own B-ness - it's schlock Brecht, with thin characters and italicized dialogue - but Romero has still delivered a merry, blood-soaked kick in the Facebook. His bleakest joke comes toward the end, when one of the characters begs the others to shoot him. For a second, nobody's sure whether he means with a camera or a gun.

Forty years after the revolution in low-budget nightmare splatter that was Night of the Living Dead , it's worth remembering that that film's garish power, apart from the sheer, outrageous, who will be the next to get chomped?  insanity of its violence, arose out of the scary elusiveness of what it said about America. There was no exact correlation between the attack of flesh-hungry zombies  and the attack on them (''Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul!'')  and the horrors of Vietnam or the general late-'60s breakdown. The metaphor was there, but it was ominously free-floating.
Contrast that with George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead , in which Romero has the dead rising up for the umpteenth time, this time chowing down on a new generation of human meat. The opening sequence, in which a local news report gets turned into an eyewitness slaughterhouse on the street, is vintage Romero: explosive, funny, bristling with dementia. But the half-dozen college kids who scurry, by van, from one location to the next (abandoned hospital, Amish farm, rich kid's mansion), fleeing the zombies at every turn, aren't too much different from the Abercrombie & Fitch ciphers of Cloverfield . Here, as well, we track the characters through one kid's shaky camcorder, a trendy device that has never worked as effortlessly as it did in The Blair Witch Project . There's a great deal of babble about how images of the zombies are being taped, all over the world, on personal cameras and shown on the Internet. The film keeps telling us that we've become a society of passive voyeurs, hiding behind our technology. (We're the real zombies, get it?) But the message is far from fresh, and you didn't have to pretend Cloverfield  was making a statement.
That said, Diary of the Dead  isn't bad; it's a kicky B movie hiding inside a draggy, self-conscious-work-of-auteurist-horror one. There are some gruesomely imaginative deaths, the kind that get you laughing because they're as snappy as speed-metal power chords. In a medical ward, a zombie gets zapped with a defibrillator, and her singed, bugging eyes make for a priceless effect. And when the stalking dead are viewed on a flickering home-surveillance system, it has a grand and creepy immediacy. As horror, Diary of the Dead  delivers the gross-out goods, but only the gullible will confuse these ritualized shock-videogame tactics with something relevant.

 In “George A. Romero’s Diary of the Dead,” the loosest, goosiest chapter in the filmmaker’s continuing zombieland epic, we meet the enemy and he is us, with video cameras. Set in Mr. Romero’s usual Pennsylvania stomping and chomping grounds (a k a Canada), the story pivots on a clutch of University of Pittsburgh students who, in the process of fleeing legions of the undead — despite their obvious handicap, zombies always find fresh meat — have taken up cameras, thus becoming the producers of their own snuff biopic.  If this sounds a little like “Cloverfield” it is, superficially, though “Diary” is a lot cheaper-looking, generally smarter-sounding and a whole lot funnier. Its lead characters — played by Michelle Morgan, Josh Close and seven other serviceable actors I’ve never heard of — run and strategize, point and shoot, and not just cameras. They flee from doom, not toward it. They’re real and prickly and all too human, and their mistakes feel true to life rather than a consequence of bad writing. One guy even plugs his camera into the wall when the juice runs low. They’re trying to make it out of zombieland alive, not knowing, as we do — take another look at the movie’s title — that the guy running this show thinks they are already dead.  Yeah, the kids are not all right, says Mr. Romero, and here’s the lowdown on the meltdown. It’s those blasted cameras, those infernal machines, the blinking screens and humming monitors that we run 24/7 and are now running us, shutting us off from the real world (whatever that is). To be honest, I kind of agree, but agreeing philosophically with a movie doesn’t make it any good, particularly when that movie insists — as this one does — on hammering home the obvious point again and again. There’s some striking filmmaking in “Diary of the Dead,” but there’s also a lot of less-than-elegant speechifying. Having already scared the stuffing out of us with his past films, Uncle George has decided it’s time for a good talk.  Some of that talk does tickle the funny bone, as when a couple of the characters — film students shooting a girl-meets-mummy cheapie — engage in some metacriticism and argue whether the dead are supposed to move fast or slow. Mr. Romero, who inaugurated the era of the modern zombie with his 1968 masterpiece “Night of the Living Dead,” maintains that the undead should shuffle through this mortal coil, not race, as they do in some recent flicks. His purism has its point. Zippy zombies are frightening less because they’re dead (and hungry), but because their speed — particularly when combined with fast editing and agitated camera moves — affects you on a visceral level. The filmmaking gets into your body; Mr. Romero also wants to get into your head.  But the body has its needs, and one of the problems with “Diary of the Dead” is that it doesn’t get into your body; it doesn’t shake you up, jolt you, make you shiver and squeak. It’s clever, or at least clever enough to keep you going and interested from start to finish. It just isn’t scary. Paradoxically, the movie’s self-reflexive conceit — that you’re watching what the characters are supposedly shooting — works against its fear factor. Because most of the characters wielding the cameras happen to be film students, the images are somewhat finessed (and edited). But because most of the images are also meant to resemble nonprofessional visuals — there’s some surveillance material too — they’re not just drab, they’re also stale.  What looked fresh in 1998 in Thomas Vinterberg’s “Celebration,” which was shot with a hand-held digital video camera and has the feel of a home movie, now looks tired, wrung out. The reason has nothing to do with video or hand-held cinematography, but with the idiom of amateurism, with a visual style that swaps artistry for a spurious authenticity. “Diary of the Dead” is supposed to look as if it had been shot by some freaked-out college kids who are as securely tethered to their video and cellphone cameras as a fetus is to its umbilical cord. And because their experience of the world is largely defined by mediated images, they turn their lives and deaths into a spectacle, just not a very exciting one.  There’s always been a political edge to Mr. Romero’s zombieland epic, which he began during the civil rights and Vietnam era and is now using to engage with the contemporary American scene. “Cloverfield” trades on the iconography of Sept. 11, turning familiar images of billowing smoke and swirling paper into virtuosic production design. By contrast, in “Diary of the Dead” Mr. Romero pokes and prods and awkwardly struggles with some aftershocks of that day, specifically, what happens when a culture — particularly one gripped by fear — is overrun with images, particularly atrocity images, that ostensibly numb and dumb down that culture by blurring the real and the unreal, true life and its canned image. Never mind that movies are part of the mix and that the movies lie too, sometimes beautifully.  “George A. Romero’s Diary of the Dead” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Zombie carnage.  GEORGE A.

Scaling back the broad sweep of previous horror opus "Land of the Dead" and largely jettisoning the increasingly comedic possibilities of the concept in favor of pointed, impassioned social criticism and close-in genre thrills, gore's godfather audaciously and successfully reboots his incalculably influential zombie franchise as a lean, mean teen-survival machine in "George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead." Gripping, intimate genre triumph reps a not-insurmountable marketing challenge in the wake of "Land"'s larger canvas, with emphasis on college-age protags and their tech wizardry sure to inject the fan base with copious new blood.
Fifth franchise entry might best be viewed as a provocative inverse of "The Blair Witch Project," with which it shares a general p.o.v. structure and some themes. At its heart a stinging indictment of child-rearing practices that produced sullen offspring, incapable of thinking for themselves or working in groups during a crisis situation, "Witch" has given way, less than a decade later, to "Diary'"s bevy of confident, savvy coeds.
These go-getters are highly motivated for success via self-expression, and possess the vidcam and Internet tech chops to attract attention to themselves by getting their personal projects made and circulated. In short, they create content to validate their own existence.
Though set in the present day, "Diary" rewinds to the mysterious zombie outbreak that set the franchise in motion. Suspicious of lies being fed through the mainstream media as society disintegrates, a surviving member of a student film crew has assembled a docu, "The Death of Death," from the crew's own footage and Internet grabs, as testament to what really went down. (The survivor apologetically warns that some music cues and thrills have been added for entertainment value.)
"The Death of Death" begins as compulsive filmmaker Jason Creed (Josh Close) tries to finish a student mummy film in the Pennsylvania woods. Hearing of the zombie crisis on the radio, lead actor Ridley (Philip Riccio) takes off in his expensive sports car for the family compound across the state, leaving cast and crew to fend for themselves in a rickety RV.
In addition to Jason, behind the camera and thus seldom seen for much of the movie, the core group for the bulk of the action includes his disgruntled g.f. Debra (Michelle Morgan); disbelieving film school rival Tony (Shawn Roberts); mummy scream queen and real-life Texas firecracker Tracy (Amy Lalonde); tech dweeb Eliot (Joe Dinicol); and cynically alcoholic Brit prof Maxwell (Scott Wentworth).
During their mad dash to Debra's house in Scranton, they encounter a nearly deserted rural hospital, an Amish farmer whose deafness doesn't impede his resourcefulness, a gaggle of renegade National Guardsmen and, eventually, Ridley's deceptively fortress-like mansion.
If the actual body count is relatively low, Romero's inspiration level is sky-high; at 67, he's got his finger squarely on the pulse of the younger generation's facile relationship with media and technology. He's also brought his always healthy skepticism of broadcasting and government to the fore; it's giving nothing away to point to pic's sad, brutal coda as one of the most powerful antiwar statements since America invaded Iraq.
Pic also reps a watershed in Romero's direction of actors. As Debra, Morgan is easily the most swaggeringly self-confident heroine of any "Dead" adventure, while Lalonde does a terrific job balancing the humor inherent in her story arc with genuine fear.
Production values are precisely what they need to be. Other than some perfectly miked characters deep in the frame, illusion of pic being stitched together from vidcam footage, Internet video and surveillance cameras is entirely logical. Decision to massage good, old-fashioned latex with CGI splatter pays off in imaginative and startling gags, produced with Greg Nicotero, Gaslight Effects and Spin. Ontario locations stand in nicely once again for rural Pennsylvania.
How influential is Romero's work? Closing credit crawl gives special thanks to Romero pals, disciples and supporters Wes Craven, Guillermo del Toro, Simon Pegg, Stephen King, Quentin Tarantino and Tom Savini. They should be proud.

Fleet-footed corpses are, from a physiological point of view, complete bullshit. "If you run that fast, your ankles will snap off," says Jason Creed  (Josh Close ) to fellow film student Ridley (Phillip Riccio ), the gauze-wrapped lead of his no-budget mummy opus The Death of Death . Pausing to regroup, cast and crew putter about the woods under the bleary eye of Andrew Maxwell  (Scott Wentworth ), professor of cinema studies and grade-A alcoholic, when suddenly there arrives, arising from the gravethe death of death. Like, for reals.
Reports of vivified corpses with a bad case of the cannibalistic munchies scatter over the radio; back at the dorms, panicked webcasts confirm the new reality, even as the Department of Homeland Security , raising the national threat level to orange, spins the incipient apocalypse as mass psychosis brought on by a "previously unknown viral strain." Please. Everyone knows you can't trust The Man, and while you might find a more or less rational zombie infestation in a civilized place like England, traceable to an outbreak of the rage virus (28 Days Later ), here in America that shit just happens .
To wit: the savage satires of George A. Romero , master of the inexplicable flesh-eating allegory, whose magisterial zombie cycle rose from the shadows in Night of the Living Dead (1968), proceeded to Dawn  (1978), then persisted through Day  (1985), only to find its terrors (spiritual and social) totalized across the Land  (2005). Nominally set in rural Pennsylvania (but shot outside Toronto), Romero's latest update, Diary of the Dead , unfolds in the ephemeral realm of electronic mass media. Told as a collage of video footage assembled from multiple platformsfirst-person reportage, surveillance cameras, YouTube, cell-phone camerasDiary  pictures the spiritual stasis and moral collapse of a people resigned to hopelessness: "All that's left to do," says one of our heroes, "is record what's happening for whoever remains when it's over." When there is no more room in hell, the dead will create a MySpace  page.
There's a lot of huff and puff here about the media and its messages as Diary  tracks the camera-wielding coeds on the road to nowhere in a zombie-splattered Winnebago. The dialogue can be overly self-reflexive ("If it's not on camera, it doesn't exist!"); the sharpest words tend to sneak in at the margins of the sound design ("The problem used to be people crossing the border," a radio pundit comments). Visually, Romero's  ersatz-DIY experiment isn't as suave as Brian De Palma 's similar effort in the recent and risible Redacted , nor as exactingly engineered as the video convulsions of Cloverfield , but its scrappy, ultra-low-budget edges are part of its charm. Romero initially conceived the project for Web-only broadcast, and if Poppa Zombie isn't quite the second coming of McLuhan when it comes to media critique, his return to small-scale indie filmmaking delivers big genre kicks.
The devil's in the details, and Diary is diabolically resourceful within its circumscribed framework. Conceptually abstract as it is, the movie is vividly grounded in place: the institutional banality of university housing and deserted hospitals (priceless defibrillator- to-the-head bit here); the cluttered, shadow-strewn warehouse hideout where the kids meet up with a radicalized band of black survivors; the frightfully porous farmhouse of Samuel, a dynamite-chucking, deaf-mute Amish zombie slayer; the suburban McMansion, replete with six bathrooms, indoor pool, and steel-reinforced panic room ("We can sit and play Nintendo  until this whole thing blows over"), where Diary climaxes as a kind of Zombie Year at Marienbad .
Shades of 28 Days Later 's finale there, though Romero claims never to have seen it. He has been watching the news, however, and Diary  makes chilling appropriation of Katrina footage to double for the zombie disaster. To what end? "I don't try to answer any questions or preach," Romero explained following Diary 's ecstatic midnight premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. "My personality and my opinions come through in the satire of the films, but I think of them as a snapshot of the time. I have this device, or conceit, where something happens in the world and I can say, 'Ooo, I'll talk about thatand I can throw zombies in it! And get it made!' You know, it's kind of my ticket to ride."
Romero's 40-year ride through the twist and turns of Undead America is motored not by the refinement of his ideas (late-'70s consumer culture = zombies at a shopping mall) but by the brute force of their execution (sociocultural critique comes alive when it sinks its teeth literallyinto human viscera). Which is to say, the movie comes first, the memorandum second. "I don't want to make this kind of movie," whines a Diary  protag in the midst of exploding brains. "I don't want to make this kind of movie either," comes the reply, "but I can't change the script."
Diary of the Dead  gets a late-night preview in a fearful edition of "Film Comment  Selects," the annual program of unfamiliar, overlooked, undistributed, and, this year, exceptionally unnerving films hosted by the Film Society of Lincoln Center . Best in show at FCS '08 is Jacques Nolot 's acerbic melodrama Before I Forget ; best in horrorshow is another nasty number from France, an exquisitely twisted, supremely uncompromised trauma called A l'intérieur . Picked up by the brothers Weinstein after brutalizing audiences at the Toronto Film Festival, Inside,  as it will be knownthough not well enoughin America, is reportedly heading straight to DVD. That's a very dumb decision for this razor-sharp shocker: My monkey could make a buck on it with nothing but a tagline: "Say hello to the motherfucking anti-Juno ."
