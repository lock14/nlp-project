         "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" may be advice film producers would be wise to ignore. After sinking a reported $40 million into a Paul Schrader-directed prequel to the 1973 horror hit "The Exorcist," Morgan Creek Chief Executive James Robinson shelved that version and brought in director Renny Harlin — known as much for his duds ("Cutthroat Island," "Mindhunters") as his hits ("Die Hard 2," "Cliffhanger") — to reshoot it at considerable expense. Harlin's film, titled "Exorcist: The Beginning," was released last August to poor reviews and negligible box office.
 
  In an unusual move, Morgan Creek and the film's distributor, Warner Bros., are now releasing Schrader's film, "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist," before it settles into ancillary perpetuity. It would be exciting to report that "Dominion" is a hidden gem rescued from beyond obscurity by a rare act of Hollywood humility.
 


         






    Unfortunately that's not the case, as Schrader's version is only marginally better; and though the two directors' prior work could not be more different, both films fall into the category of instantly forgettable.
 
  Schrader, the scholarly, acclaimed screenwriter of "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" and director of "American Gigolo" and "Affliction," among other films, is the more subtle and complex filmmaker, and "Dominion" takes a more psychologically intricate path in exploring how a Dutch parish priest becomes an exorcist extraordinaire in 1947 British East Africa. The film, however, is marred by some of the same problems as Harlin's version — namely, weak supporting characters, unintentionally funny dialogue and poorly executed special effects. William Wisher and Caleb Carr are the credited screenwriters on "Dominion" and received "story by" credit on "Beginning," which was rewritten by Alexi Hawley.
 
  Stellan Skarsgard once again stars as Father Lankester Merrin, the role played by Max von Sydow in the original 1973 adaptation of William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel. There are some major differences between the two prequels, key among them changes to the story and the recasting of the second and third leads. Gabriel Mann as Father Francis and Clara Bellar as Dr. Rachel Lesno were replaced in Harlin's version by James D'Arcy and Izabella Scorupco, respectively.
 
  Schrader's film is also less bloody and significantly less scary, but more effective at rendering Merrin's metaphysical transformation from doubter to demon fighter.
 
  The release of "Dominion" allows Schrader to get his version seen and counters the notion that it was an unreleasable failure, but more important, it illustrates the folly of Hollywood's practice of throwing good money after bad. Films are continually delayed in production and postproduction as producers and studios try to fix problems that should have been addressed at the script stage. Rarely does any amount of recasting or reshooting save a film at that point.

If you're a certain kind of moviegoer  my kind  then the announcement that Paul Schrader's prequel to The Exorcist , was being shelved after it had been fully shot and edited only stoked your desire to see it. After all, what crime against popcorn could Schrader, the acclaimed director of Auto Focus  and Affliction , possibly have perpetrated that would inspire Morgan Creek, the film's production company, to dump his version and reshoot the entire thing  with Renny Harlin, that hack-of-all-trades, directing? Reports at the time indicated that Schrader, working from a script co-written by novelist Caleb Carr, had delivered a slow and brooding ''art film'' instead of the gory, sensationalist head-twister the studio wanted. But one executive's pretentious dud is another's masterpiece. Could Schrader's film really have been that bad  or was it a victim of degraded tastes, the daring and poetic franchise horror movie the Man didn't want you to see?
The strange saga of Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist  is now complete, since the  Man, in his wisdom, has chosen to release it after all. Perhaps he looked at the tepid box office grosses generated by Harlin's Exorcist: The Beginning  and figured that he had little to lose by shoving another slab of overcooked deviled ham into theaters. Schrader's film is a notch better than Harlin's (it's elegantly framed, and stately where the other one was music-video pushy), but when you boil out the demon feathers...it's the same damn movie.
Once again, we're treated to the dusty desert saga of the 40ish Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard), who undergoes a crisis of faith after being forced, at Nazi gunpoint, to make a Fatal Moral Choice. Trading his priest's robes for an archaeologist's khakis, Merrin arrives in East Africa, where he finds a cadre of British military colonialists running roughshod over the natives. He also finds a church, buried up to its dome in sand, haunted by the spirit of the Antichrist. The key word in that sentence is ''spirit.'' The Exorcist  showed you the devil, but Dominion  mostly suggests  him, with oodles of omens and stylishly arid tableaux.
Dominion  is far too straightforward in its spook tactics to be pretentious. There are moments, however, when it does seem as if the director is making Diary of a Country Priest  as a light show of floating dread. The movie shares one jolting shock image with Harlin's Exorcist   a bloody fetus covered in maggots  but the relative absence of crude effects would be more compelling if Skarsgard had something to do aside from looking impotent in his anguish. Schrader, in Auto Focus , displayed a devious sense of sin, but in Dominion  the Calvinist schoolboy in him insists on trumping sin with guilt. Had the movie stayed on the shelf, it might have haunted Schrader's résumé as a theoretical lost gem. As it is, viewers can now decide for themselves whether it was his version or Harlin's that squeezed this franchise dry.

reputable filmmaker courting a rendezvous with Satan might do well to keep a stash of pea soup on hand to toss in viewers' faces should they start nodding out. A splash or two would have added some pungency to "Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist," Paul Schrader's tastefully gloomy, sometimes plodding and occasionally impenetrable prologue to the 1973 horror blockbuster. But those dribbles, had he allowed them, would have sabotaged the director's perversely high-minded goal of enshrining the remnants of a tacky horror franchise by treating them as sacred relics in a serious metaphysical investigation. "Dominion" includes some terrible events, the worst being the discovery of a classroom of slaughtered African children, but the gratuitous gore is minimal. "Dominion" offers no visceral shocks to approach the projectile vomiting of green gunk or the 360-degree head spinning in the original "Exorcist," directed by William Friedkin. You will not hear a demonically possessed child spit potty-mouthed expletives in the gravelly voice of Beelzebub, Mercedes McCambridge or anybody else. Satan, when finally encountered, is an androgynous levitating Buddha-like figure, by turns seductive and ominous. Morgan Creek, the company that produced Mr. Schrader's ambitious, brooding hybrid of semi-horror and semi-art, rejected it and hired a flashy hack, Renny Harlin, to reshoot the movie with a mandate to reinstate the grotesque equivalents of spewed pea soup (here, a maggot-covered newborn baby and a pack of ravenous hyenas tearing a man apart), along with growled profanity. In pop music terms, Mr. Harlin's movie, released last summer, might be described as a crude heavy-metal demolition of Mr. Schrader's sensitive singer-songwriter album. Both films star Stellan Skarsgard as Father Lankester Merrin, the Dutch parish priest turned archaeologist who loses his faith after being forced by Nazi soldiers to carry out an atrocity in 1944. The movies' contradictory intentions are illustrated by their handling of this material. In Mr. Schrader's film, everything follows from this event, which begins the movie. Mr. Harlin's movie, "Exorcist: The Beginning," carelessly shoehorns an abbreviated flashback of the same atrocity late into the film as an explanatory afterthought. It would be nice to report that Mr. Schrader's Nazi sequence in which Father Merrin faces a predicament reminiscent of "Sophie's Choice" has the weight of Alan J. Pakula's 1982 film, or of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List."  But it comes off as shrill, tinny melodrama. The story then leaps ahead three years to find the former priest working as an archaeologist in the Turkana district of British East Africa (present-day Kenya). To his astonishment he discovers a fifth-century Christian Byzantine church in almost perfect condition, buried beneath the sand. As the story develops, we learn that this church when originally excavated was found to be a source of evil and immediately reinterred. Besides the superstitious, volatile Turkana tribe, the clashing members of the desert community include Father Francis (Gabriel Mann), a devout young Catholic priest dispatched to monitor the dig; Major Granville (Julian Wadham), a cynical, hard-nosed British officer and racist who blames all the upheaval on the Turkanas; and Dr. Rachel Lesno (Clara Bellar), a humane concentration-camp survivor who operates a clinic. But the most compelling local is Cheche (the pop star Billy Crawford), a severely crippled teenager and cowering pariah, who, tended by Rachel, is miraculously healed only to find his body becoming a furious battleground between good and evil. Mr. Schrader bets all his philosophic chips on this ambiguous, fascinating figure. Where Father Merrin in Mr. Harlin's movie was a dour adventurer embarked on a desert safari, here he is all grim metaphysical business, glowering in the grip of a spiritual crisis whose resolution will carry him a quarter-century hence to Georgetown (in the person of Max von Sydow) as a formidable ghost buster. How seriously does Mr. Schrader take all this mumbo jumbo? His throwing in of an eerie dream sequence that pays direct homage to Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" suggests his personal artistic investment was considerable. But there's no escaping  that "Dominion" is finally an act of commercial scavenging. You may retrieve the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from your trash and assemble them into a cute, novelty gift basket. But if you bend down and take a whiff, your nose is still met with the scent of garbage. As any chef will tell you, it's the ingredients, stupid! Mud cannot be turned into a chocolate souffl�, nor can "The Exorcist," in its many incarnations, be transformed into anything beyond a lurid supernatural shocker. "Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence.

Two years after being shelved by producing company Morgan Creek -- and almost entirely reshot by Renny Harlin as "Exorcist: The Beginning" -- helmer Paul Schrader's "Exorcist: The Prequel" finally emerges from its crypt: Result is hardly a diabolical failure, if not quite a heavenly masterpiece. Schrader's intelligent, quietly subversive pic emphasizes spiritual agony over horror ecstasy, while paying occasional lip-service to the need for scares. Probably too talky and angsty for mainstream auds, this version could claw some cash back, especially on ancillary, from the need-to-see factor alone.

In Belgium, where it world preemed at the Brussels Intl. Fantasy Festival March 18, pic will be theatrically released as "Paul Schrader's Exorcist: The Original Prequel." Legal wrangling is still going on over whether the movie will get any U.S. release, though title is likely to remain that on print caught: "Exorcist: The Prequel."
Those familiar with Harlin's version, released by Warners last summer to an $82 million worldwide gross split evenly between domestic and foreign, will immediately recognize the broad span of the plot is much the same, albeit with variations that crucially shift emphasis. Opening scene set in 1944 Holland finds Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) forced by a Nazi officer (Antoine Kamerling, who like Skarsgard and many of the supporting thesps, also appeared in Harlin's version) to choose 10 of his flock to die, a trauma that shakes his faith.
The first person the Nazi shoots in Schrader's pic is a grown woman, whereas in Harlin's it's a cute, braided-hair moppet -- which pretty much sums up the difference in tone between the two.
Action jumps to 1947. Merrin, on "temporary sabbatical" from the priesthood, has become an archeologist in British East Africa (modern-day Kenya, repped by Morocco) and has uncovered a mysterious 5th century Byzantine church. Father Francis (Gabriel Mann; replaced by James D'Arcy in the Harlin version) is assigned by the Catholic Church to keep an eye on Merrin, while British officer Major Granville (Julian Wadham, also in Harlin's version) keeps an eye on the restless native Turkana tribe.
Also living near the dig are doctor Rachel Lesno (Clara Bellar), a Holocaust survivor; Chuma (Andrew French), the translator-liaison between the Turkana and the whites; and crippled teen Cheche (Philippines-born popstar Billy Crawford), an outcast Merrin befriends.
As the crew digs deeper, it becomes clear the church was not intended for worship but more as a consecrated plughole -- to keep the evil in its ancient crypt from escaping.
Unlike in Harlin's movie, where there's a twist at the end over exactly who is possessed, here it's made clear early on that it's Cheche. As the teen's limbs heal and skin clears, the film slyly reverses the franchise's normal trajectory, which dictates that the stronger the possession the more impasto the make-up job. By the end, Cheche looks like a creamy-complexioned little Buddha, sitting cross-legged in a loincloth.
While the final reels make less theological sense and partly degenerate into metronomic horror beats, pic's midsection is impressively meaty and smart -- with a dense feel to virtually every scene, as in Schrader's best work like "American Gigolo," "Mishima" and "Light Sleeper."
Ever the film buff, Schrader even includes a surrealist homage to the dream sequence in Hitchcock's "Spellbound." With its floating clocks and bandaged figures, it's more unsettling than any of the CGI in the rest of the movie.
Likewise, a note of authentic horror is rung when a whole schoolhouse of innocents is slaughtered by Turkana tribesmen, a sequence absent from the Harlin version. Woven throughout are extended arguments between Merrin, Rachel and Father Francis about faith and the nature of evil which play far better here -- in a screenplay credited to William Wisher and Caleb Carr -- than in the more dumbed-down Harlin version. It's worth noting, however, that some of the most memorable lines survived in Alexi Hawley's rewrite for Harlin.
Though the movie is about demonic possession, the audience is reminded of mankind's own capacity for evil, including Nazism and colonialism. It's the kind of message that must have struck real horror into Morgan Creek execs investing a reported $45 million into a franchise prequel.
Aside from the enormous success of William Friedkin's original pic, the franchise has long held a B.O. curse, with poor performances by both John Boorman's 1977 "Exorcist II: The Heretic" (1977) and the subsequent "Exorcist III" (1990), by the original novel's author, William Peter Blatty. Shortly before his death, John Frankenheimer was set to direct this long-mooted prequel, with Liam Neeson as Father Merrin.
Morgan Creek's surprise decision to hire Schrader, for the first franchise movie in his career, was both inspired and "what-were-they-thinking?" insane. Schrader has delivered a 100% Paul Schrader film, drenched in the spiritual and moral angst that's watermarked his career from "Taxi Driver" (as a writer) to "Auto Focus" (as a director).
As a drama about faith, infused with metaphor and doubt, film achieves moments of real cinematic poetry. It's the horror-movie shocks that are pic's least convincing component, especially given the ropey quality of the CGI work.
Performances are good to excellent. As Merrin, Skarsgard is in much better, more soulful form here than in the Harlin version, and some of the supporting players who worked on both films get a chance to show off real chops with better material. That's particularly the case with Wadham, Kamerling, and Ralph Brown as a racist sergeant-major (last ended up mostly on the cutting-room floor in Harlin's version).
Mann shines as a more neurotic Father Francis than D'Arcy in Harlin's version. On the distaff side, Bellar has a smaller but more complex part than Izabella Scorupco did in the Harlin movie, and makes more of it.
Tech side has similar personnel overlaps and variations. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who shot both versions, downplays the drama here at first with a naturalistic look and then builds to some extraordinarily stylized, richly colored compositions. Production designer John Graysmark's version of the devil's crypt is both more authentic and creepier than the one in Harlin's version.

 review of Renny Harlin's cut, "Exorcist: The Beginning," click here
.

In 100 years of movie business goldbricking, impulse production, and high-flying market pursuit, we've never seen anything quite like this: a moviea prequel and the fourth entry in a decades-old horror franchisemade twice, the two variations on a theme released nine months apart, constructed by two different directors from two disparate screenplays and with minor cast overlap. (Historically, the only parallel is the 1930s Spanish-language versions Universal and other studios sometimes shot on a film's sets after hours, for Mexican release.) In a nutshell, astringent moralist Paul Schrader  shot, cut, and delivered his Exorcist  filmdetailing the African backstory of Father Merrin in the years after WW IIto Morgan Creek  prez James Robinson , who was reportedly put off by the shortfall in monster F/X and by the surplus of ethical debate. He canned it, fired Schrader, hired Renny Harlin  to reshoot, and voilà. Robinson's seemingly madcap decree has proven to be its own publicity coup, and now Schrader's once shelved, DVD-rumored half of the diptych is hitting real screens. "In the end, it's a revenue stream," Schrader told The Guardian  last year, "and all revenue streams eventually reach the sea."
Together, Exorcist: The Beginning  and Dominion  are a fascinating object lesson in new-millennium Hollywood , demonstrated by a pandering '90s-formula slophog and one of the '70s' great aging tyrannosaurs, respectively. In the void between them, you can read in minute detail the industry's crazed tension between coherence and sensationalism, story and light show, interest in mature viewership and condescension to the lowliest teenage brainpan. Both filmsthe original screenplay was by William Wisher  and Schrader-fouling novelist Caleb Carr , while the second film's rewrite was credited to Alexi Hawleyhone in on Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard ), on clerical hiatus due to his guilt-sowing war trauma, pursuing instead a Christian archaeological dig in East Africa . He unearths an ancient temple, and everyone from the native workers to the British army begins to bug out in the familiarly baritone, contact-lens-wearing manner.
The similarities dry up thereafter. Predictably, Schrader's versionwhich stands as the first film to use prequel  in its titleis as sober as Harlin's is beery. For Schrader, the Nazi flashbacks aren't merely background, but a queasy slice of history that inevitably repeats itself; the question of whether evil is man-made or sui generis is tortured over, even as the levitating begins and the digital hyenas approach. Merrin's female foila doctor attending to the localsis here played by the eager and unglamorous Clara Bellar ; the remake replaced her with the semi-dressed Polish sexpot Izabella Scorupco , who also got to fly, rasp, and vamp possessedly. Choose your Pazuzu experience accordingly.
In Schrader's world, demons are best considered metaphoric abstractions, and the evil perpetrated is restricted to the tried-and-true human variety. The rather shoddy material is even upgraded so the metaphysical plague functions as a neat metaphor for colonialisman easy and apt sprig of resonance too heady for the likes of Harlin. Of course, Dominion  is itself too cheesy by half, complete with an oddly Hindu-ish, lounging-in-midair possessee and a cheaply biblical finalebut Robinson wasn't wrong. It's pulp in defiance of its own reading level. The film will come to share the video store shelf with Harlin's infinitely stupider rendition soon enough, but it's a shame they couldn't have been released theatrically head-to-heada death match-cum-clinical trial that might've supplied some objective stats on how much condescension the American moviegoer actually enjoys.
