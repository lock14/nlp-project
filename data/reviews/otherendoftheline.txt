Let's say you're out at dinner one night after a long day in advertising. Your girlfriend is blabbing on her phone while you do the same. You get another call. It's a customer service agent, ringing to inquire about thousands of dollars in suspicious charges on your credit card. Do you A) immediately get to the bottom of this problem or B) hang up on her?
If you're Granger Woodruff, you terminate the call, since resolving the situation means "The Other End of the Line" ends up being a five-minute ad for buyer's insurance instead of an interminable interracial, international, intercultural romantic comedy. Inter-what?
Oh, right: The customer service agent sits in a Mumbai, India, call center. Her name is Priya (Shriya Saran), and she has been promised for marriage to a local mama's boy. Granger (Jesse Metcalfe) lives in New York and can't stop thinking about Priya's fake American accent.
Bursting with attraction, she hightails it to San Francisco, where Granger is trying to win an account and Priya's cousin is getting married. As for the dramatic tension: He has no clue that she's the call center girl. Her family shows up. So does his girlfriend. They all leave "romantic" and "comedy" in the dust.
Watching Granger and Priya chase each other around a hotel like squirrels in a park, you wonder what these two see in each other. Saran, with her big eyes and sweet demeanor, seems like the cute girl in your study group who you're afraid to Facebook. It's mysterious what she could possibly get from Metcalfe, who's the guy you know is in your class because he always needs to borrow your notes.



The title makes it sound like a Western, but �The Other End of the Line� is more of an Eastern-Western, offering a pretty savvy take on the romantic possibilities of subcontinental telemarketing. Girl calls boy, girl meets boy, boy loses girl and girl�s parents come from Mumbai to San Francisco to do a whole lot of handwringing in this frothy comedy from helmer James Dodson, a winning Stateside debut for beautiful Indian actress Shriya Saran. Despite its charming cast, this MGM release managed to dial up just $57,000 from 91 engagements for a per-location average of $626. 
Most Americans react to Indian telemarketers the way they react to a jury summons, but they seldom get anyone as professional or as winning as Priya Sethi (Saran). Priya is the most eager-beaverish at Citi One Bank Card�s Bangalore call center, the employee with the best American accent, the most nuanced knowledge of American fast food, the one who can distinguish Sarah Jessica Parker from Mary-Louise Parker. Thus, she�s also the best at convincing Americans on the phone that she isn�t an Indian woman, but rather Jennifer David of San Francisco.
Some of scripter Tracey Jackson�s best material is in the call-center scenes, where often beleaguered, well-mannered Indians are abused daily over the phone. (�Can I get out of New Jersey?� one worker pleads. �Everyone�s swearing at me.� No, her supervisor says: �Everyone starts in New Jersey.�) Investigating a case of identity theft, Priya ends up calling good-looking Bay Area ad man Granger Woodruff (Jesse Metcalf) so often that they develop a phone relationship, which leads to expectations on both ends. The problem: Priya is being pushed into an arranged marriage and, unbeknownst to Granger, doesn�t live in San Francisco.
But that�s where they end up meeting, via a series of contrivances that should be tiresome but end up being tolerable, mostly thanks to Saran. Her Priya is in fact a little too hip for a supposedly obedient Mumbai girl -- hipper than Granger, even. He and his pal and partner, Charlie (Austin Basis), are trying haplessly to develop a campaign for a chain of hotels whose owner, Kit Hawksin, as played by Larry Miller, is the other reason to see this movie. The comedian isn�t in nearly as many movies as he should be, and his timing here is hilariously deft. Where much of �The Other End of the Line� has to adhere to a daffy sweetness, Miller takes Jackson�s material into a different realm entirely.
That�s a good thing, because the rest of the film shoplifts from any number of movie romances, including �Pretty Woman,� �Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House� and, most shamelessly, �An Officer and a Gentleman.� But as cross-cultural bridge-builders go, pic is smart, funny and sweet enough to make you reassess your attitude next time you get reach tech support in New Delhi.




This meager cross-cultural romantic comedy stars Jesse Metcalfe  as ultra-smooth New York advertising executive Granger and Bollywood actress Shriya Saran as Priya, the credit-card customer-service rep who falls for him over the phone thousands of miles away in Mumbai , India. They decide to meet in San Francisco, but because she's led him to believe she's an American (i.e., white girl) named Jennifer David , complications ensue when he begins courting this Indian woman he thinks is a stranger. On one level, director James Dodson 's love story is so innocuously pleasant that attacking its obvious plot developments and sitcom-shallow observations about dating feels almost ungracious. But the one truly unforgivable element is Granger, who Metcalfe plays as the most noxious sort of self-satisfied yuppie creep who, amazingly, doesn't have to shed a fraction of his smugness to win Priya 's heart. The Other End of the Line  wants to show how people from different corners of the globe can make a connection, but in reality, the U.S.-obsessed Priya must defy her cultural mores and empty her measly bank account to be with the man of her dreams, while all Granger has to do is learn to tolerate spicy Indian food. At a time when our global standing is sinking like a stone, it's comforting to know that, at least on the big screen, we can still land the babes no matter how obnoxious we are.
