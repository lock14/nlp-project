Die-hard fans of Nick Hornby�s first, best novel, Fever Pitch
, which chronicles in hypermasculine minutiae the ups and downs (mostly downs) of the legendary Highbury, North London, footballers Arsenal F.C., and which serves as the basis for this drastically Americanized remake, should read no further. Instead, I recommend you either crack a lager and break out your tape of the �79 FA Cup Final rout of Manchester United, or � and this may be the wiser option, since there�ll be others like you around to commiserate � head on over to Fad� and wait for the next match to shimmy down the satellite pipeline. Whatever you do, don�t go into the Farrelly brothers� Fever Pitch
 seeking an adaptation along the lines of the merely Yankified remix of the Hornby novel High Fidelity
: This is not that. Instead, the Farrellys and writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have chucked Hornby�s exhilarating ode to the Gunners, and by extension all things football, and replaced the novelist�s finest hour with � wait for it! � baseball
. Specifically, it�s about the Boston Red Sox and their splendid, wholly miraculous 2004 World Series victory, which, to be fair, did indeed rival the Gunners and their rabid, emotionally suicidal, eternally optimistic fans the "gooners." But still � baseball? Godsend striker Ian Wright would be spinning in his tomb were he dead. The "pitch" here, obviously, refers not to the grassy green of Highbury but to Curt Schilling�s Fenway fastballs, and that single noun is just about the only similarity between Hornby�s book and this film. (For a more literarily accurate outing, I suggest renting the 1997 British version, which at least features Colin Firth as Hornby�s alter-ego.) Here, instead, we get former SNL
er Fallon as Ben, a middle school math teacher and Red Sox fan nonpareil, who falls in love with fast-tracking career gal Lindsey (Barrymore), and then sees both his love of the game and the girl jeopardized by each other. It�s a romantically comedic take on the metaphysics of love, loss, and Beantown brouhahas, and as such it�s a sweet, charming little puffball, the same one Barrymore�s been doing for what seems like ages now. This Fever Pitch
 only comes alive � and only sporadically at that � when it dips into the emotional reservoir of alpha-male underdoggery, as evidenced by Ben�s ravenous diet of all things Red Sox. The scenes of him shrieking at the ESPN cameras with unbridled glee as he and his pals hang out in Florida at Sox spring training is a nakedly honest depiction of what it means to love sport � any
 sport � but Fever Pitch
 also, less charmingly, holds the moment up for ridicule. "Who are these nutjobs, anyway?" the Farrellys appear to be saying, and then completely fail to answer the question. Hornby, at least, lets you in on the secret. Here, it�s replaced by a trite, clich�-ridden pas de deux that feels craggy in its first few blossoms. Ugh. The Farrellys, too, are treading water. They�ve replaced their earlier, more juvenile (and vastly more entertaining) schtick with something approaching what passes for mainstream comedy these days. Ultimately, it�s a bore. Don�t see the movie � read the book, play the game.


You're a young professional woman who's been dating for, what, your entire adult life. Your problem (you've been told) is that you intimidate too many men. You meet this cute, funny, sensitive, straight guy, a high-school teacher, which is not exactly the profession you had in mind. You fall for him, anyway, and he's totally falling for you.
But there's this one problem: He's already in love -- with 25 dudes who call themselves the Boston Red Sox. Sure, it's only for half the year, but can you make this work?
''Fever Pitch," which has its red-carpet premiere tonight and opens widely on Friday, is the effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy made from this scenario. For women in these parts who this week are starting to lose their men to NESN, ESPN, and Fenway Park itself, the movie may play like a particularly painful documentary.
Business consultant Lindsey Meeks (Drew Barrymore) finds herself stuck in this very jam when she starts dating Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon), who teaches math at East Boston High. After several dates, he comes out to her as a season-ticket-holding member of Red Sox Nation. He gets down on one knee and asks for her hand to Opening Day.
Barrymore and Nancy Juvonen produced the movie, which is very loosely based on Nick Hornby's book about British soccer lust. Impressively, it's been made with women in mind. There's no shortage of scenes shot at Fenway, but there's room for Lindsey's girlfriends to speculate, in the raucous manner of ''Sex and the City," about why Ben is still single. ''How is he not tranquilized and tagged by now?" asks Robin (KaDee Strickland).
Ben is
 a little suspect. He has no cellphone and a closet full of jerseys. The living room wall of his North End apartment is done up to look like the Green Monster. And his only apparent family are his equally fanatic childhood buddies and the lovable Fenway vets with whom he's been watching games since he was a kid.
But Ben also takes good care of Lindsey when she gets sick on their first date. He's a keeper, and she swears that she won't be one of those whiny women who complains that his devotion means he's not paying enough attention to her. Besides, she's putting in insane hours at the office angling hard for a promotion. But what happens when a workaholic locks horns with a Sox-aholic?
Directed by New Englanders Peter and Bobby Farrelly, ''Fever Pitch" arrives with the stink of Soxploitation. The sight, last year, of Fallon and Barrymore hopping onto the field and making out at Busch Stadium after the team won the World Series smacked of Hollywood opportunism at its most nauseating.
But those scenes are an afterthought in the finished product. As it turns out, ''Fever Pitch" is respectful and heartfelt about the problems that come with extreme fandom and how they might impinge on the happiness of a person who couldn't care less about Carl Yastrzemski. A Red Sox fan is an unusual breed of devotee, and it takes a strong person, probably a fellow diehard, to handle the moods that swing with the outcome of every game.
Lindsey, however, is clueless about baseball. She sweetly thinks that when Ben goes to spring training, it means he gets to practice with the team.
Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (''Parenthood," ''Robots") replace Hornby's English wit with surprising emotional insight. After one of the couple's disagreements, a student of Ben's reminds him, ''You love the Sox, but do they love you back?" Humorously but sincerely, the movie asks, can Ben and Lindsey love around his obsession?
I was worried that a straightforward romantic comedy would neuter the playfully bruising humor the Farrellys inflicted in ''Kingpin" and ''There's Something About Mary," two coarse benchmarks in popular film comedy of the last 20 years. Once Barrymore is heard vomiting in one scene and is clocked with a foul ball in another, I relaxed. In fact, the brothers seem at home with the movie's lovey-dovey lightness and sense of maturity. This is the first movie they've made where all the characters seem like people rather than jokes.
Fallon still flails away like an over-caffeinated Muppet, but there's enough of a character for him to play so that his shtick (thrown-away lines, dumb faces, booming outbursts) becomes adorable as opposed to merely endurable.
Barrymore, meanwhile, might be the funniest woman in the movies. Like the most interesting romantic comediennes, she does more heavy lifting than the man. And she's unafraid of looking goofy, which is good news for the Farrellys.
Since Cameron Diaz gave male fantasies an effervescent good name in ''Mary," the brothers have struggled with how to let an actress be lunatic without looking stupid, the way Gwyneth Paltrow did in ''Shallow Hal." Barrymore gives the directors their first humanly offbeat performance. She makes you truly believe that Lindsey can stop worrying about her and Ben and just ''cowboy up."


         Mixing romance with baseball, the Farrellys' 'Fever Pitch' displays winning ways.Asweet and often hilarious movie about modern romance and its fearsome adversary, modern life, "Fever Pitch" was adapted from Nick Hornby's memoirs of obsessive soccer fandom. The hapless hero of the book is an Arsenal fan, and the American version finds a neat parallel universe in Boston. Translated from the British, it's the story of a love triangle involving Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore and the Red Sox. Real life just provided the extra-happy ending.
 
  Ben (Jimmy Fallon), a boyish middle school math teacher, meets the go-getting Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) on a field trip to her office, where he's taken his honors geometry class to meet someone who has applied her math skills in the real world. An ambitious executive on the rise, Lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in Ben, and she's somewhat taken aback when he asks her out. Their first date gets off to a disastrous start when Lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning — and her sonorous retching provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a Farrelly brothers movie. But there's a discreetness — a gurgling delicacy, if you will — to the grossness, which somehow makes the scene feel intimately, endearingly disgusting. Rather than accept Lindsey's (rather urgent) request to reschedule, Ben sticks around to play nurse. And orderly. And janitor. To watch Ben scrub the toilet and the dog's teeth (you don't want to know) after his love interest has passed out with a bucket next to her bed is to be won over. When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards. "I date poodles, basically," she explains later to Ben, who is clearly more the lovable mutt type. And to her friends, she rationalizes: "Why does everything in my life have to be a trophy?"
 


         






    As is par for the course in movies like this one, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends. Lindsey's strictest buddy, the skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30. "He should be with the wrong 
person by now," she reasons, scaring Lindsey with one of the nastiest dating horror stories ever told. Plump, curly-haired Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) supply the optimistic view.
 
  Of course, Robin is onto something — Ben is a lifelong Red Sox fan, a condition that in many ways resembles martyrdom. Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, Ben has organized his life around the season — he's never missed a game. The relationship, which has progressed without a hitch through the winter (we know so via the requisite happiness montage), hits a snag at the start of the season.
 
  As closely as the movie sticks to formula generics, the script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel also manages to incorporate Hornby's lyrical analysis of sports fandom without resorting to voice-over or time-stopping speeches. The roots and significance of Ben's devotion/affliction add unexpected dimension to a character that could have come across as merely immature and selfish, and Fallon embodies the goofy but solid Ben with a lightness and tenderness that's quite winning. When the relationship hits the skids, a wise fifth-grader suggests that he ponder the unrequited nature of his Sox love, but it's through his conflicts with Lindsey — who has her own issues — that Ben comes to understand what role the team has played in his life.
 
  Barrymore, who seems to have grown up lately, is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs. For example, duty requires that she get up during the introductory dinner with her parents and cover her boyfriend's ears (he's holding lobster claws) when a loudmouth at a nearby table nearly reveals a score to a game he's taped for later. Things get more difficult when their priorities directly contradict each other, and both Fallon and Barrymore do a nice job of rendering the complicated negotiations that make up the daily ins and outs of any relationship.
 
  "Fever Pitch" has its share of inspired comedic moments — Ben's version of hitting rock bottom, for instance, is priceless. Even if you can see the formula paces coming from a mile away, "Fever Pitch" is a warm and funny enough diversion to make up for it. It's a prettified view of love, for sure, but as Sox fans would surely attest, sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true.

Fever Pitch , a fable that pits true love against baseball love, is one of the most ingratiating romantic comedies in quite some time, yet the fact that it was directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly almost works against it. The Farrelly name, to the extent that it remains a brand, sets up expectations  of a raucous sports satire, of laughter on steroids  that this winningly low-volume and humane little movie can't satisfy. In comedy, we've all been conditioned to seek out the brash and the obvious: the fractious situational mix-ups, the Adam Sandler baby-men, the goo in the hair (thanks, Peter and Bobby). Performers are rewarded for their winking hipster absurdism, and so you might assume that Jimmy Fallon, a former Saturday Night Live  star now trying to break into the Sandler/Ferrell stratosphere, would be packaged as another wild-eyed postmodern misfit  a goof-meister in italics.
In Fever Pitch , though, Fallon gets a chance to be that rarest of creatures, a comic actor who plays it straight. As Ben Wrightman, who teaches honors geometry to ninth graders, Fallon doesn't overdo the stammering dorkiness; he's nervous and sincere in a way that makes him a sweetly infectious Everyguy. A movie star can't just be pretty. His features have to knead together in an interesting way, and Fallon, with those felt-tip-marker eyebrows, that chiseled nose and smile that make him look like Pinocchio the moment after he was transformed into a real boy, has an off-kilter cuteness. His anxious mental agility and eagerness to please make you root for him, because they come from a childlike place that can't be faked.
The film is clever about setting up Ben's romance with Lindsey Meeks (Drew Barrymore), a yuppie with a flirty grin and a vaguely defined high-powered job whom he meets when he takes a handful of students on a tour of her office. According to Lindsey's 21st-century rule book, the fact that Ben teaches high school should make her run the other way (she must earn multiples of what he does). Yet he's handsome and, in his scruffy and tentative fashion, rather witty, and we're asked to enjoy his successful courtship as a symbolic victory for squarely dressed earnest geeks everywhere. That, how-ever, is a mere prelude to Ben's big secret, which is that he has already given his heart away. He's married to the Boston Red Sox.
Based on an essay memoir by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity ), Fever Pitch  was adapted by the veteran screenwriting team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (Splash ), who have transplanted Hornby's tale of love, soccer, and suburban England into a tale of love, baseball, and Boston proper. This is the rare Farrelly film the brothers didn't generate themselves, yet it's a perfect addition to their gallery of men who haven't grown up and the women they must remake their infantile souls for. Lindsey is more than happy to meet Ben's Red Sox fixation halfway, as she joins him in the stands with his ''family'' of fellow fans. She graciously endures his Red Sox pillowcases, his outbreaks of freakish behavior like yelling in a restaurant lest he hear the results of an away game that he has yet to view on tape. It turns out, though, that there is no halfway. Ben won't part with the Sox, not even for an amorous weekend in Paris. When Lindsey gets struck on the head by a foul ball, his reaction  he high-fives the guy who nabs the ball  is not what is meant by love being blind.
Fever Pitch  provokes tender chuckles rather than guffaws, yet you can feel the Farrelly touch in their eye for detail: Ben and his friends smelling the package of season tickets, the ingenious way that the 2004 season has been  woven into the story. The biggest surprise is that the film is understated rather than exaggerated. Fallon brings off the neat trick of making Ben not a laughable sportsaholic but a lyrical young romantic with his wires crossed. There's nothing macho in Ben's worship of the Sox. His late uncle left him lifetime tickets just behind the dugout, and he has the starry-eyed excitement of a true believer. What he loves about the players, the contests, the mood of Fenway Park is that they represent a perfect world. Even the curse of the Bambino, the fabled myth of why Boston (until last year, of course) hadn't won a championship since 1918, is a secret source of comfort: It testifies to the purity of his obsession  the ultimate in sports loyalty.
In Fever Pitch , Ben's baseball ardor becomes a funny, moving metaphor for the arrested male's inability to surrender himself entirely to love. High Fidelity featured the same setup, with rock fervor instead of baseball, only this is a far more urgent variation. The two actors are wonderfully matched. Barrymore has never lost her honey-glazed cuddliness, but there's a hint of melancholy to her now, and it roots her big go-for-broke scene at Fenway Park, a moment of the deepest cornball perfection. It's been a while since a movie made the game of love this winning.

o watch "Fever Pitch," the new, thoroughly winning if not especially good film by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. That is, of course, not big news. If Hollywood has taught us anything over the last century it is that every so often a seemingly ordinary commercial enterprise can afford us fleeting access to the sublime. And for my money, there are few movie moments right now more sublime than the image of Drew Barrymore running across a major league baseball field and, with that famous jaw jutting into the wind, dodging ballplayers and storybook clich�s to save the windup of this imperfectly true romance. Written by the industrial-strength team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel ("Splash," "City Slickers") and loosely based on the Nick Hornby memoir of the same title, "Fever Pitch" is one of the few Farrelly movies that the brothers didn't  also (officially) write.   And while it features a lengthy sequence involving regurgitation - mind you, an unabashedly romantic sequence involving regurgitation - this is the first of their films that doesn't lean on sight gags and the various insults and humiliations that come with having an all-too-human body. When Ms. Barrymore's character, Lindsey Meeks, turns an alarming shade of green after a bout of food poisoning, the Farrellys sneak in some delightful business with a dog and an electric toothbrush, but otherwise keep an uncharacteristically discreet distance. For longtime Farrelly fans, this turn to relative discretion may set off alarms. Ever since their first movie, the gleefully stupid "Dumb and Dumber," the brothers have been doing their part to flush American comedy down the toilet. In contrast to many of their barf-bag brethren, however, who seem stuck in the anal and oral stages, content to manufacture poop jokes and sail along on their own flatulence, the Farrellys have consistently pushed their comedy into new territory, including fatherhood, brotherly love and romance. Equal parts Three Stooges and classic screwball comedy, "There's Something About Mary" was a crudely funny valentine of a movie, but a valentine nonetheless. In their last comedy, "Stuck on You," a story about conjoined twins with conflicting desires, the brothers sent another valentine, this time to each other. "Stuck on You" didn't fully work and neither does "Fever Pitch," but it's good to see the Farrellys pushing their own comedy comfort level, if only because they're running out of body fluids to exploit. Ms. Barrymore's character is an alpha-gal Bostonian with designer tastes, a high-stakes consultant who crunches numbers for high-end clients. One day at work, she finds herself performing career show-and-tell for some elementary school math nerds and their equally nerdy teacher, Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon). After some hemming and hawing, he asks her out and she hesitantly agrees. It isn't that he isn't cute (with his fluttery lashes and tentative smile, Mr. Fallon has cute down). The problem, one of her friends suggests, may be that she makes more money. After all, when it comes to most men, "It's like you're dating yourself." But Ben isn't like most men and it's the very specific way in which he stands apart from the herd that's meant to give "Fever Pitch" its singular kick. What makes Ben special isn't his love for teaching, the way he never tucks in his shirt or any of the little things that make up the sum of a person; it's that he is a major league Red Sox fan, an obsessive, a true believer, a nut. Having been inducted into the Sox cult at the impressionable age of 8, Jimmy has turned the team into his church and his home. A reproduction of the Green Monster - the left field wall in Fenway Park - covers half his living room. He sleeps in a Sox T-shirt, buys beer with a Sox credit card. He even uses Yankees toilet paper. For Lindsey, who first falls for the man she calls Winter Guy only to end up a few months later with the single-minded demon she comes to know as Summer Guy, the road to happiness (or maybe madness) may be lined with team jerseys, Johnny Damon bobble-head dolls and countless iterations of red-and-white socks. Working off of Mr. Hornby's memoir, which recounts his lifelong obsession with a soccer team, the filmmakers try to attenuate Ben's fixation and balance the lopsided relationship by turning Lindsey into a workaholic. But her friendships have nothing to do with work and her apartment doesn't resemble a 12-year-old's rumpus room. Other than the fact that she looks like Drew Barrymore and is impossibly beautiful, Lindsey is just like any other overworked single woman who has ever turned a blind eye to a beer gut, a receding hair line and years of indulgent  mothering for a date. Try as they might, the Farrellys don't seem wholly comfortable with this material. Unlike Chris and Paul Weitz, who translated Mr. Hornby's novel "About a Boy" to the screen with such fluidity, the Farrellys have a hard time finding the right rhythm for their film, perhaps because for once the actors aren't spinning in circles. This is the first Farrelly movie not stuffed to the gills with comic bells and whistles and booming yuks, which may explain why the first 20 minutes are so excruciating. The film has the flat lighting and sound of canned television, and the actors look as if they have  been dropped on the set without instruction. Things improve as the story unfolds, or maybe I was just too eager to see it all work out to continue fussing about the filmmaking. Still, despite the visual clumsiness and the production's tattered seams, I found myself rooting for this movie anyway, partly because Lindsey and Ben make a nice fit, as do the actors playing them, partly because the Farrellys bring so much heart to their movies, and partly because Ms. Barrymore inspires more goodwill than any other young actress I can think of working today in American movies. She doesn't give a performance for the ages in "Fever Pitch" (we may have to wait for her movie with Curtis Hanson, "Lucky You," to see what she is capable of), but she does enough. Like a loyal Sox fan, you root hard for her to make it across that baseball field, just as you root hard for the Farrellys, hoping against hope that they have hit another one out of the park. "Fever Pitch" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild adult humor and very discreet lovemaking.

The Farrelly brothers are growing up, which in this case isn't a bad thing. With a tacked-on ending made necessary by the Boston Red Sox's improbable World Series run last fall, "Fever Pitch" proves a charming romantic comedy against "A Beautiful Mind"-type framework -- the "illness" here being a grown man's addiction to baseball. Likely to appeal to both men and women with its mix of sports mania, "Aw" moments and occasional flourishes of Farrelly-esque goofiness, this genial rookie should keep turnstiles clicking long enough to be scored as a hit, if not a blast into the cheap seats.
Accommodating men's infatuation with sports, actually, is an under-utilized device, especially considering the pangs of recognition that greeted the moment in "Diner" when a Baltimore Colts fan subjects his would-be bride to a trivia test.
Cleverly adapted from Nick Hornby's book about his obsession with soccer, "Fever Pitch" seizes on the long-suffering Red Sox loyalists, laboring under the curse of the Bambino, and wonders whether a true die-hard can find love. It's an oddly logical impediment to romance, adding a quirky wrinkle to boy meets girl, foul ball hits girl, boy loses girl, etc.
Jimmy Fallon captures the right touch of boyishness as Ben, an affable if slightly nerdy schoolteacher who begins wooing Lindsey (Drew Barrymore), an ambitious, promotion-seeking corporate exec. At first, the class differences appear to represent a small hiccup, but Lindsey's snooty friend Robin (Kadee Strickland) insists there must be some darker reason why a cute, almost-30 guy is on the market.
Lindsey gets her answer soon enough, since the courtship began in the winter, before those six months that Ben devotes to the Sox -- from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia. Soon enough, the issue becomes whether he can modulate his interest to meet Lindsey halfway, or if she must accede to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work.
Much like "A Beautiful Mind," the problem is that Ben can be a dreamboat one moment and a loon the next -- pitching a near-fit during dinner with Lindsey's parents (James B. Sikking and JoBeth Williams) so he won't hear the final score of the Red Sox game, which he's taping. As a practical matter, given the duration and frequency of the baseball schedule, there's not much room for a truly committed Sox supporter to get a life, as much as Ben would like to have one.
Although the Red Sox obviously have a storied history of frustration, Ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan. At the same time, the Farrellys, along with writing tandem Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, have toned down their customary gross-out excesses (albeit with a few tips of the cap in that direction), resulting in a film not as howlingly wicked as, say, "There's Something About Mary," but likable nonetheless.
After stalling out in "Taxi," "Saturday Night Live" alum Fallon exhibits real bigscreen potential, overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unsympathetic. Barrymore, meanwhile, slips breezily into another romantic comedy role that accentuates the former, and the filmmakers have assembled a nicely fleshed out supporting roster, including Ben's extended family at the ballpark, whose level of dedication mirrors his own.
Enough shooting was done at Boston's Fenway Park to convey a sense of authenticity as well as the ambience of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. That said, "Fever Pitch" is one of those nicely grooved pitches with which even a novice ought to be able to connect.

As regional yuck-meisters, the Farrelly brothers  (like Todd Solondz ) might once have been considered the spawn of John Waters . Always commercial, their work has grown increasingly sentimentala trend that culminates in Fever Pitch , which, written by veteran schmaltzers Lowell Ganz  and Babaloo Mandel , reconfigures Nick Hornby 's confessional account of his obsession with the North London soccer team Arsenal  into a feel-good celluloid footnote to the Red Sox 's triumphal 2004 season.
Happy-go-lucky grade school teacher Ben Wrightman  (Jimmy Fallon ) falls in love with high-powered career-something Lindsey Meeks  (Drew Barrymore ). After two movies opposite Adam Sandler , Barrymore is more than equal to the task of feigning passion for Fallon. Class differences can be resolved as well; what's most important here, albeit disguised as the question of whether Ben can grow up, is Lindsey's capacity to adjust to his summer identity as the most fanatical of Red Sox fans.
With half the movie set in a Fenway Park  box a half-dozen rows behind the home dugout, Fever Pitch  is barely a screwball comedy, let alone a gunk-loaded spitball like There's Something About Mary . The movie makes a few feeble gestures toward disgust and embarrassment. Lindsey gets food poisoning on the eve of her first date with Benhe cleans up the puke, and in an unmistakable Farrelly touch, brushes her dog's teeth. But the ickiest thing about Fever Pitch  is its reverential Field of Dreams  music.
Damn Yankees!  used baseball fandom as the basis for a pop Faust . Fever Pitch  is closer to The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima  ; it's a religious movie made from within its particular cult. The crisis occurs when Lindsey causes Ben to miss "the greatest game ever played." Unlike other references to the 2004 season, this bottom-of-the-ninth, come-from-behind victory over the Yankees is fictitious. I was, however, pleased to see Ben flagellate himself by compulsively watching Game Six of the 1986 World Seriesthe real greatest game ever played.
