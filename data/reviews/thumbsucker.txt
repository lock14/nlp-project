         Although the intellectual level of "Thumbsucker" is quite a few cuts above many teen angst movies and the film boasts several impressively nuanced portrayals as well, it is not sufficiently distinctive to stand wholly apart from the pack. Furthermore, its literary roots peek through rather too often in dialogue that might play well on the page but doesn't sound real when coming out of the mouths of actors.
 
  It is also not altogether surprising that it's a first film for its director, Mike Mills, who focuses intensely on his actors but reveals little cinematic flair. This is crucial because at heart "Thumbsucker" is yet another film about the self-absorbed, the young especially, and "Thumbsucker" could have been enriched by a filmmaker who could link his people to their world in a manner that would be in some way revealing. Most definitely, "Thumbsucker" is a film of words rather than images.
 


         






    In the title role, Lou Pucci as Justin Cobb is a pale, thin 17-year-old with angular features who still sucks his thumb, much to the consternation of his father, Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio), a college football star traumatically sidelined by a knee injury and now the conscientious manager of a large suburban sporting goods store in Oregon, apparently near Portland. The Cobbs live in a spacious home near a forest; Mike's wife, Audrey (Tilda Swinton), is a registered nurse smitten with a TV heartthrob (Benjamin Bratt) with whom she will cross paths in a most unexpected fashion. Justin, who doesn't fit in neatly with his peers or in the classroom, is too self-preoccupied to regard his resilient and self-reliant younger brother Joel (Chase Offerle) — a character actually more original than the oh-so-sensitive and vulnerable Justin — as anything but obstinate.
 
  Justin has somehow managed to end up on a debate team, though he has no taste for debating. This at once enrages and challenges his coach, Mr. Geary (Vince Vaughn, cast stunningly against type). In tandem with a high school official, Geary declares that Justin, though bright, is doing poorly in school because he suffers from attention-deficit disorder and prescribes Ritalin or its equivalent. How Audrey, as a registered nurse, could go along with this arbitrary, unscientific and dangerous diagnosis defies credibility, but out of somewhere comes a prescription. In no time Justin is transformed into a confident achiever, a champion debater, articulate, glib and arrogant.
 
  Although the focus remains primarily on Justin, who is not all that intriguing a character despite Pucci's mercurial portrayal, the clear point of the picture is that the insecurities of its teens mirror those of adults, and this is Justin's big discovery.
 
  Mills' adaptation of Walter Kirn's novel is an episodic film of fits and starts. Justin's orthodontist (Keanu Reeves) figures out a way to break Justin from thumb-sucking rather easily, and Geary drops out of the film. Kelli Garner, on the other hand, is a pretty classmate who intrigues Justin and then disappears only to return to toy with him cruelly.
 
  Mills does best by D'Onofrio, whose Mike is a highly intelligent man but, like many American males, unable to express his feelings, and by Offerle, whose Joel seems like a real, live boy.
 
  Vaughn's Geary, smart and overbearing yet ultimately overeager to be accepted by his students as a peer, is perhaps the film's most intriguing presence, but the film leaves one wanting to know more about him. Swinton reveals all the sides of Audrey, but the role remains problematic.
 
  Reeves' orthodontist is no more than a literary conceit and, despite Reeves' charm, remains a caricature of a New Age guru subject to drastic philosophical swings. (Reeves and Pucci have a slight but weird physical resemblance, and they're both guys whose long hair keeps falling down over their faces.) Bratt has presence and humor, but his big scene is as improbable as all of Reeves' scenes.
 
  "Thumbsucker" aims high but swerves too frequently between the engaging and the credibility-defying to be satisfying.

Justin (Lou Pucci), the 17-year-old hero of Thumbsucker , is one of those long-haired indie-flick adolescent pretty-boys who act out their deep reservoirs of disaffection by not saying very much. Adapted from Walter Kirn's 1999 novel, the film isn't nearly as witty as its source, but just as you're growing weary of its shaggy morose cool, Justin, who has never stopped sucking his thumb, is put on Ritalin, and he becomes a debate-team champion  a precocious star, reveling in his mouthy superiority. Alas, his newfound jerkdom doesn't last, but even after the film returns to its alt-rock-flavored preciousness, Pucci proves to be one of the most charismatic male ingenues since Johnny Depp.

Emo cinema adds another quirky, wistful member to its ranks with Thumbsucker , whose young suburbanite hero fits the type of pharmaceutically enhanced searcher-seer previously established from American Beauty  to Garden State.  Justin Cobb  (Lou Pucci ) is 17 and still suckles his thumb, an intractable habit that marks him out for mockery at school and incurs the wrath of his macho dad, Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio ), who interprets his sensitive kid's every shortcoming as a personal affront. Justin's "holistic orthodontist," Dr. Perry Lyman , tries hypnotherapy, urging Justin to invoke his "power animal"a deer in the forest, as it turns outfor help in casting out his organic pacifier. As played by Keanu Reeves  in a nicely self-parodic turn, pensive stoner Lyman isn't a quack; indeed, if Freud was onto anything in attributing oral fixation, and the catastrophic dentistry that goes with it, to bad parenting, then every orthodontist should cross-train as a shrink. Nor would Freud call a thumb a thumb if he could see how longingly Justin gazes at his mom, Audrey (Tilda Swinton ).
School authorities take a more prosaic approach, diagnosing Justin's listlessness and indirection not as adolescence but as ADHD. Hopped up on Ritalin , Justin becomes a cocaine-tongued speed reader, exuding debate team prowess and a certain lack of inhibition about lying. Justin's parents join him at the displacement activity group table, whether they realize it or not: Mike projects his embitterment about his truncated college football career onto his family, while Audrey, a nurse who's startled to find herself in early middle age, is obsessed with TV hunk Matt Schraam  (Benjamin Bratt ). Everybody has a thumb, be it prescription meds, celebrity, nostalgia, or heaps of potthe movie looks away for a moment and Justin's crush, Rebecca (Kelli Garner ), transforms from earnest do-gooder to raccoon-eyed burnout, a mutation any high school vet will recognize with a shiver.
Enriched by Joaquín Baca-Asay 's richly hued, blurred-edges cinematography and the enveloping faux-gospel of the Polyphonic Spree , Thumbsucker  isn't as sour as the 1999 Walter Kirn  novel on which it's loosely based, and is less beholden to sitcom-episodic set pieces. Exiting a press screening a while back, however, I overheard an otherwise mild-mannered audience member growl, "Another fucking American suburban teen-angst film." Snip off the expletive and you've got a perfectly fair nutshell of the endearing and well-acted Thumbsucker , and you can throw in much of whatever's left of the Sundance-Amerindie project too (The Chumscrubber  and Me and You and Everyone We Know  also premiered this year at Park City ). The inevitably irritating prevalence of this limited subgenre is something of a chicken-and-egg phenomenon: In a different filmmaking climateless dependent on proven formulas, less lab tested and producer oriented (Thumbsucker  has nine), less flushed with book-option feverone wouldn't necessarily expect an established short-film director, designer, and gallery artist like Mills to choose Donnie Darko  Redux  as his first feature any more than you'd anticipate Miranda July  to make a movie lightly redolent of Todd Solondz . When Justin at last finds an escape hatch from tree-lined limbo, the optimistic viewer might read it as an allegory of the American Filmmaker's dearest wish.
