         Julianne Moore is back in a permanent wave and cardigans for Jane Anderson's adaptation of Terry Ryan's bestselling memoir, "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio," which caps Moore's long-suffering 1950s housewife trilogy with a smiley face and a proffered hanky.
 
  Based on the true story of a housewife who kept her family in fish sticks by writing prizewinning advertising jingles while her machinist husband blew the milk money on whiskey and beer, "Prize Winner" picks up with Evelyn Ryan after the birth of her 10th child, just before she wins a washer and dryer, a freezer and $5,000 for a down payment on a house. The freezer turns out to play a major role in the movie, as Evelyn fills it with comestible prizes while husband Kelly alternately pummels it and tosses steaks out the back door.
 


         






    In a disconcerting rug and black-rimmed glasses, Woody Harrelson cuts a pathetic figure as a man who takes his anger at his wife's emasculating copywriting skills out on the appliances. But despite this, and the fact that Kelly and Evelyn call each other "mother" and "dad" (endearments not cute in any decade), Anderson handles their relationship with tongs. Evelyn is no luckier in marriage than her counterparts in "The Hours" or "Far From Heaven," but she dutifully insists on making lemonade from the lemons life pelts her with. There's a lesson to be extracted here — something about making the best out of less-than-optimal circumstances. But considering Evelyn's feudal relationship to her drunken lord of a husband, it would probably require one of those old-fashioned citrus presses you can get at Restoration Hardware for the price of a 1959 mortgage payment. There's a price to pay for all that nostalgia.
 
  Considering how closely Anderson worked with the book's author, child No. 6, Terry "Tuff" Ryan, it isn't surprising that the on-screen Evelyn submits to her trials with the patience of a saint. She's a reflection of the admiration of her loving children, which probably accounts for why so much of the story concerns what's for dinner. The director feigns some distance from the subject by applying the occasional postmodern styling, such as kitschy '50s-style animations, and Moore-as-narrator sauntering into scenes in which she's already present as a character. (There's something creepy about the fond, arm-over-the-shoulder bonhomie the actress displays for herself as the protagonist.)
 
  But it's one thing to write a loving ode to your mother; another to direct an ode to an ode. For all its aggressive chirpiness — which reaches operatic heights when Evelyn meets her soul mates in a jingle-writing group of housewives called the "Affadaisies," headed by a bubbly Laura Dern — "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" leaves a bitter little aftertaste that isn't rinsed away by Anderson's decision to include a scene of "the real Ryan children" (a title helpfully informs) rummaging through their late mom's things and making bassett eyes at her typewriter. It's probably safe to say that we've had our fill of stories about little ladies in twin-sets making the most of it — and considering those days are practically upon us again, it seems about time to start waxing weepy about those brave, plucky moms who tacked chore-wheels to the fridge before heading out to barbecue their bras. Talk about days gone by.

Is Julianne Moore to the girdle born? In The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio , Moore comports herself once again with Eisenhower-era placidity as an ideal and idealized housewife and mother  a sister in diminished expectations to the perfectly groomed, oxygen-deprived, unhappy women she played in Far From Heaven  and The Hours . Stepping off the pages of a 2001 tribute memoir written by Terry ''Tuff'' Ryan, Moore plays Terry's mother, Evelyn Ryan, a real-life domestic goddess who supported her family with cash and prizes won in jingle contests during the 1950s and '60s. Churchgoing mother of 10 kids and long-suffering wife of a weepy, childish, alcoholic husband (played by Woody Harrelson) who effectively counted as her 11th, this Evelyn is never less than minty fresh in rose-colored shirtwaist dresses, determined to squeeze sweet lemonade from the sour lemons of her circumstances.
Screenwriter Jane Anderson (Normal ) makes her feature directorial debut with this caramelized production, and the tone she employs  a candy-colored perkiness that bathes every triumph, every setback, and every Ryan in the forgiving light of Simpler Times  is very much an aesthetic choice. (I assume the surviving Ryan children, who also make an appearance, approve of the color palette.) As a result, though, Anderson's adaptation is heavy on production numbers in which jingles come to life and light on conveying any real feelings of Eisenhower-era darkness the prizewinner herself might have felt during her decades of marriage to an abusive, drunken man. Here, nostalgia becomes its own form of defiance.

 In Jane Anderson's bittersweet, satirically savvy film "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio," Julianne Moore portrays a downscale version of the picture-perfect 1950's housewife she played in "Far From Heaven" and "The Hours." In the earlier movies, Ms. Moore's character was a doggedly supportive spouse who cracked under pressure. Here, her alter ego, the real-life Evelyn Ryan, is an anchor of resourcefulness and optimism in a sea of trouble.  "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio," adapted from a memoir by Terry Ryan, tells the true story of the author's mother, Evelyn, who reared 10 children through a domestic nightmare. Evelyn's bitter, self-loathing husband, Kelly (Woody Harrelson), a would-be band singer whose show-business hopes were dashed when an accident destroyed his voice, works at a dead-end in job as a machinist and squanders his meager paycheck on booze.  Using her skills as a jingle writer, Evelyn enters and wins the television contests that proliferated in the 50's and early 60's, when contestants were invited to describe the benefits of a product, often in catchy rhymed verse. Evelyn's winnings in cash and products keep the family afloat.  The film is the first theatrical feature directed by Ms. Anderson, whose credits include the television movies "Normal" and "The Baby Dance." But she is best-known as the Emmy Award-winning writer of the screenplay for "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom," a 1993 movie that recounted the story of an ambitious mother (played by Holly Hunter) who hired a hit man to kill her daughter's rival for the high school cheerleading squad.  Like that movie, "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" sustains the slightly zany, offbeat tone of a surreal documentary that never loses sight of its characters' emotional lives. Pungent musical seasoning is supplied by the 50's hits of Les Paul and Mary Ford, whose loopy, space-age guitars and overdubbed vocals distill a period mood of compressed giddiness.  Every now and then, Evelyn addresses the camera. And every so often one of her jingles comes to life like a genie released from a bottle, as a smiling group of women in 50's costume materialize to harmonize and whirl before your eyes before they retreat into the heavenly supermarket whence they came.  Such moments capture a sense of the American home in the 1950's as a technological wonderland in which miraculous appliances like televisions and freezers and food products like frozen vegetables arrived heaven sent to lighten a housewife's workload. Coinciding with the decade's explosive affluence, these wonders infused the rigidly conformist social climate with a whoosh of wide-eyed optimism.  In the film's most delightful scene, Evelyn wins an opportunity to charge through a supermarket and pile everything she can grab within 10 minutes into a giant shopping cart. Like a military strategist, she carefully plots her invasion. Once in the store, she makes certain to grab exotic gourmet items she could never ordinarily afford like caviar and capers and, at Kelly's request, shrimp cocktail. When she brings home the loot, her husband is initially too resentful of her success to sample the treat she has thoughtfully remembered to take for him.  Never mind that Ms. Moore's Evelyn appears impossibly svelte and pneumatic for a woman who has given birth to 10 children, or that the announcements of her winnings are a little too conveniently timed to solve the family's immediate financial crises. These exaggerations underline the pluck and true grit of a woman who convincingly transcends the grim feminist cliché of the downtrodden domestic goddess as a victim who swallows her disappointment, tolerates an abusive husband and sacrifices all  for her children.  In the film's most revealing and touching moment, the teenage Terry (Ellary Porterfield), nicknamed Tuff, badgers her mother to admit she has had a miserable life. Evelyn rebuffs her by declaring how she treasures the moments like the one she is just now sharing with her daughter on a rare trip out of the state. This talent for living in the now attests to Evelyn's astonishing spiritual strength.  The film's political attitude could be described as sensibly post-feminist. If the movie pays tribute to the 50's ideal of the subservient domestic goddess, it does so conditionally. Observing Evelyn with a rueful blend of admiration and sympathy, it sees her as a magnificent exception. In a deft insertion, the movie slyly alludes to that vintage daytime game show "Queen for a Day," which simultaneously enshrined and humiliated its desperately needy contestants.  As you watch Evelyn endure Kelly's rages, sulks and such outrageously irresponsible acts as taking out a second mortgage on the Ryan home without telling her, you admire her ability to deflect his fury with her sweetness and her courage to confront him when necessary without flying into a fury. But you also hold your breath each time he arrives home from work, red-faced, glowering and itching for a fight. Mr. Harrelson, instead of portraying Kelly as monster, plays him as a loving but broken man, wallowing in shame and self-hatred but trying in his pitiful way to be a responsible father and breadwinner.  Gently, affectionately and with wit, this lovely movie gives the 1950's its due, but not for a moment does it go overboard and make you want to go back there.  "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and disturbing images of domestic conflict.

A true account of how a woman's intelligence and stoicism saves her huge family, "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" sensitively presents an unvarnished view of the 1950s and early '60s through the subtle filter of the present. Tailor-made for writer-director Jane Anderson -- making her first feature film after several small-screen triumphs ("The Baby Dance," "Normal," etc.) -- pic allows Julianne Moore to again inhabit the conformist '50s, but in an entirely different key than "Far From Heaven" or "The Hours." Depending on how well DreamWorks' sub-division Go Fish gets the word out, women should respond, and appeal of this all-American tale will be felt in smaller cities as well as large.
As far back as her brilliant solo theater work, "How to Raise a Gifted Child," Anderson has been concerned with the relationship between mothers and children --as well as true sagas. Though her original work can be quite dark, as in "The Baby Dance," "Prize Winner," which Anderson also scripted, is told in a memoir form that both lightens and deepens the story about a woman with exceptional talent for writing jingles, yet is born in the wrong era to fully realize it. Even more than in "Far From Heaven," Moore's housebound wife is a study in pent-up brilliance, with extraordinary devotion to her family.
Having delivered her 10th (and final) child in 1956, Evelyn Ryan is already a frequent winner of the jingle contests companies used to hawk their consumer products after WWII. Inserting contest forms into her Underwood as easily as she slips off a diaper, Evelyn and her Defiance, Ohio, home appear to be the picture of Midwestern bliss.
But cracks soon appear below the domestic sheen, and the family's lower-middle-class condition is only part of it. Husband Kelly (Woody Harrelson), a factory machinist, drinks himself into a lather every evening. It's Evelyn's steady winnings that provide the margin to barely pay for essentials like milk.
Evelyn's occasional winnings -- one of them big enough to place a down payment on a house feel like the well-earned victories of a talented writer who happens to be a full-time mom, rather than scripted fantasies. Yet they also feel somewhat hollow, since the family can never get ahead; consumer goods being produced by America's exploding economy are frequent prizes, and a large freezer, plunked down in the middle of the kitchen, strikes Kelly as a symbol for what's wrong with his life.
As years roll into the '60s, the film develops a fine novelistic view of the sacrifices made by ordinary people growing older. Few of the kids are foregrounded, but one who is -- Tuff (Ellary Porterfield) -- learns valuable lessons at 16 when she's able to meet some fellow ace contestants with her mom across the Indiana border.
The trek to get there, and meet Dortha Schaefer (Laura Dern) and her gal friends, marks the first time Evelyn has gone anywhere. Tuff (nickname of author Terry Ryan) asks her mom why she's put up living such a "miserable life," and the mother's stoic response is the film's anthem for grit.
A deception by the pathetic Kelly and a last-minute contest win by Evelyn that rescues the clan from dissolution feel too dramatic, yet there's hardly a moment onscreen that doesn't ring of truth. Huge credit is due Moore, in a fascinating performance that again show's she's among the best American actresses onscreen. Ever mindful she must keep up a good face for the kids, Moore's Evelyn, rather than being a re-creation of '50s-style feminine selflessness, is a character who knows her resourcefulness is the best way for her to fulfill her expected role in life. This makes the her rare emotional breakdowns all the more shattering.
Harrelson, with a limited range of options as little more than a drunken slob who's jealous of his wife's abilities, soon grows tiresome. Dern makes a brief but charming impression, and Porterfield, in a striking debut, crafts a beautiful role built on teen smarts.
Anderson's dalliances with tiny flights of fancy serve as visual contrasts to her deliberately plain direction, which are confidently supported by Jonathan Freeman's desaturated color lensing and a superb design team (production designer Edward T. McAvoy, art director Andrew Stearn and costume designer Hala Bahmet) capturing the period in a way that feels fully lived in.

Based on Terry Ryan 's bestselling memoir about her mother, Evelyn, Prize Winner  is shameless Eisenhower-era corn. In her third 1950s matriarch role in as many years, after 2002's Far From Heaven and The Hours , Julianne Moore  struggles valiantly to maintain her dignity as a saintly housewife who writes commercial jingles. Evelyn dutifully tends to her brood of 10 while her machinist husband, Kelly (Woody Harrelson ), spends the kids' milk money on hooch, spiraling into alcoholic rages during Red Sox games. Evelyn's wordsmithery wins toasters, freezers, exotic comestibles, cars, and cash; when Dr Pepper  prize money saves the Ryan home from repossession, Kay Starr 's "Wheel of Fortune " plays redundantly on the soundtrack. Helming her first feature, TV vet Jane Anderson , who also wrote the screenplay, relies too heavily on treacly gambits like direct address and, most horrifyingly, showing the real Ryan progeny rummaging through Mom's notebooks and caressing her Underwood. Only the utterance of words like homophone  and inner rhyme  spice up the bland proceedings for Moore's Midwest Mother Courage. There's no possible interracial romance to consider, no Mrs. Dalloway  to read, no Toni Collette  to smooch.
