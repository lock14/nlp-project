         One of the few pleasures consistently denied modern children is the opportunity to wallow for an hour or two in tales of childhood angst and horror unencumbered by pluck or uplift. Whether this is an accurate reflection of contemporary childhood (at least among the filmgoing classes) is hard to say, but if there's such a thing anymore as a melancholy kid in touch with his or her own powerlessness, he or she isn't getting much satisfaction at the movies these days.
 
  Who better, then, than Roman Polanski, master of the grotesque and an authority on the cruel vagaries of fate, to add an adaptation of "Oliver Twist" to an already heaping pile? Polanski's version, though handsomely realized, is a fairly conventional rendering of the novel that probably won't be counted among his best films. But as his first movie for children, it's striking in the way it revisits the director's abiding themes, dialed down for a PG-13 rating.
 


         






    The director one website categorizes under the heading Filmmaker/Actor/Fugitive has more in common with the Victorian novelist than might be apparent at first glance. Like Charles Dickens, Polanski tells stories about innocents imperiled by fate, corruption and the institutionalized hypocrisy of the powers that be. Then there's the fact of his own Dickensian childhood: During World War II, Polanski escaped from a Jewish ghetto in Kraków, Poland, shortly before his parents were sent to concentration camps. He survived, much like Oliver, by aligning himself with street gangs and relying on the kindness (where he could get it) of strangers.
 
  But if Dickens emerged from his difficult childhood (separated from his family, sent to work in a factory) as a champion of the dispossessed whose work helped change laws regarding child labor and the age of consent, Polanski has tended to dwell on the psychological effects of a particularly grotesque kind of systematic victimization. His victims — which is to say, his protagonists — suffer grievously for an identity that has been imposed or defined by others. So it comes as no surprise that his identification with Oliver is eerily palpable. Not only does Barney Clark, who plays Oliver, make for a credible, if more beautiful, Polanski as a child, he seems to radiate a painful craving for love and a sense of outrage at his character's fate in more or less equal measure. Brought before a magistrate who will oversee his transfer from the workhouse to the custody of a terrifying chimney sweep, Oliver looks up at him with an expression that seems to reflect all the injustice in the world, a single tear signaling his rage and grief.
 
  Shot in Prague, meticulously designed by Allan Starski, photographed by Pawel Edelman and costumed by Anna Sheppard, Polanski's Victorian England is grimy, loud and crowded with thugs, fools and villains. But whereas David Lean's 1948 adaptation (which seems otherwise to have served as a source of inspiration), creates an expressionistic nightmare world of harsh shadows, off-kilter angles and stark, Gothic menace inspired by the original George Cruickshank illustrations, Polanski has created something subtly crueler, inspired by the moody illustrations of Doré: a world in which warmth, beauty and kindness exist just beyond Oliver's grasp.
 
  The story opens on Oliver's ninth birthday, when he is summarily dispatched to a workhouse by the group of self-satisfied jackasses that compose the board of the orphanage where he's lived until then. Soon after his arrival, Oliver draws a short straw and is made to ask for a second helping of gruel. The incident leads to his being pawned off as an apprentice to an undertaker. Eventually escaping to London, he is taken under wing by a young pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and taken to Fagin (Ben Kingsley), who runs a home for young thieves.
 
  If Alec Guinness' Fagin, with his disturbing physical resemblance to anti-Semitic caricatures of the 1930s, sparked outrage, Kingsley's Fagin is likelier to cause bewilderment. Covered in grime and matted nests of hair and missing all but his two front teeth, Kingsley resembles a repulsive, though not entirely unfriendly, rat. Unlike the violent thug Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman), Fagin walks a line between exploiter of children and grotesque mother hen. By the time Oliver reaches Fagin's lair, he's had two gruesome jobs and narrowly avoided a third, but he's never been shown anything resembling affection. Having walked for seven straight days to get to London, Oliver is more grateful for Fagin's kindness than anything else. Gratitude surfaces again when Oliver winds up with Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), a gentleman who takes him home after Oliver is wrongly accused of robbing him.
 
  In the biggest departure from the book, Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood have omitted references to the family connection between Brownlow and Oliver, eliminating the part of the story that explains Oliver's provenance and his rightful place in Brownlow's home. In Polanski's version, Oliver remains a boy whose past and family connections have been erased, and his position remains inalterably one of reliance on a stranger's arbitrary kindness. It's this sort of luck, which visits Oliver at irregular but well-timed intervals, that save him from corruption, exploitation and death, which seem to await him at every turn. That Polanski chose this as the movie he wanted to make for his own children feels motivated by more than a septuagenarian dad's desire to take a $60-million stab at a bedtime story. It feels inspired by a need to tell them who he is.

On the face of it, Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist , with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood, is in the tradition of every faithful Oliver Twist  ever filmed  a photogenic, straightforward, CliffsNotes staging of Charles Dickens' harrowing story about a penniless orphan negotiating among cruel and occasionally good adults in a world that has no time for children, and even less for penniless orphans. The London that Polanski reconstructs (in Prague) is a fetid, heartless place that must be navigated by wits, not maps. And as if to prove it, the director propels his action up and down stairs, through dank streets, and even across rooftops, often in the dark or in the rain. The grimy, pint-size pickpockets Oliver falls in with have the crazed, hardened look of children ripped from childhood too soon, and their scaly handler, the sniveling Fagin (Ben Kingsley), is appropriately decayed, all bent of nose (with Semitic intimations) and mossy of teeth. When Fagin clutches Oliver, played by angelic-looking newcomer Barney Clark, in a gnarled gesture of possessiveness (and, in Kingsley's nuanced portrayal, warped love), the contrast between the rotten ''Jewishness'' of the old man and the Christian luminosity of the boy couldn't be more acute.
Yet precisely because this is by Roman Polanski, it's irresistible to read his sorrowful and seemingly classical take, from a filmmaker known as much for the schisms in his personal history as for the lurches in his work, as something much more personal and poignant. As in his previous movie, The Pianist  (also written by Harwood), Polanski here considers the case of a person shaped (or is it misshaped?) by a fate over which he has no control. Like the musician played by Adrien Brody, Oliver survives by chance. Some people, Polanski darkly observes, are good, others are bad. But most, like Fagin, are mutants, strangled combinations of both.


Without his name on the credits, it would be difficult to identify the latest version of "Oliver Twist" as the work of Roman Polanski. Conventional, straightforward and very much within what used to be called the Traditional of Quality, this handsome film is a respectable literary adaptation but lacks dramatic urgency and intriguing undercurrents. Coming off the director's Oscar win for his last film, "The Pianist," Sony/TriStar will have no trouble positioning this as a prestige fall release on ramp-up to its Sept. 23 opening, but story's modest impact in this umpteenth screen retelling looks to limit B.O. to moderate levels.
Just as Polanski was drawn, 27 years ago, to Thomas Hardy's "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" for the opportunities it provided to meaningfully embellish a story designed to express the arduousness of life, so one could imagine that he would be drawn for similar quasi-autobiographical reasons to Dickens' tale of an orphan boy forced to make his way in a treacherous world.
The biggest surprise, then, of his "Oliver Twist" is that it seems so impersonal. In fact, it's very close to what a director such as William Wyler or George Cukor might have done with the story in the Hollywood of 70 years ago, albeit not as colorfully acted. And it doesn't approach the impact of the dark version David Lean directed in 1948, a film that for long stretches resembles silent cinema and one that was so controversial for its characterization of the Jewish villain Fagin that its U.S. release was delayed for three years, and then came out significantly cut.
Rather than as a tapestry of life's trials and tribulations, Polanski and his "Pianist" scenarist Ronald Harwood approach the classic tale as something of a boy's adventure yarn. Dispensing with the harrowing episode of Oliver's birth and his mother's death, pic opens on Oliver's arrival on his ninth birthday at the workhouse, where he joins dozens of other youths doing menial labor until he's exiled for his presumptuous request for more gruel at mealtime.
After a disagreeable spell working for an undertaker, Oliver makes his way on foot to London, where he's quickly taken under wing by the Artful Dodger, top boy among the pre-pubescent lads working as pickpockets for the sniveling, devious Fagin. Hunched over, dressed in layers of rags, with matted reddish hair and missing several teeth, Ben Kingsley's creation looks a fright (and would assuredly smell even worse), although he is decidedly without the exaggerated hooked nose and nasal intonations that made Alec Guinness' interpretation in the Lean version so invidious to some.
So although Fagin technically retains his place as a criminal, Kingsley and Polanski appear most interested in attempting to humanize him, to argue that, even though he takes advantage of his boys and makes them break the law, this might be preferable to their fates if they were left to their own devices on the streets. In the service of this view, Kingsley does a fine job, instilling Fagin with a certain feebleness and insecurity that make him more pathetic than hateful.
Unfortunately, it's a level of performance unmatched by most of the other actors. In any Dickens adaptation, one expects a raft of fabulous supporting actors to flesh out the author's inimitable characters. Oddly, Polanski has chosen to employ little or unknown thesps, a tactic that can work when surprise or lack of previous associations are important but which has an indifferent effect here. Leanne Rowe's doomed Nancy breaks through with a few markedly emotive moments, while others are adequate but unexceptional.
Crucially, Barney Clark is disappointingly wan and unengaging in the title role, giving the film a hole in the middle; when he disappears for a spell in the latter-going, it's a bit of a relief.
Professionally but without inspiration, pic reenacts the key scenes that will be familiar to many via the book, previous film and TV versions and/or the musical.
Saved for the very end, the most interesting scene, in that it has appeared in none of the other prominent versions of the story and attempts to cast its principal characters in a fresh moral light, shows Fagin in prison just prior to his execution. Oliver insists upon paying a visit to forgive this half-insane "wretched man."
Pic conveys the impression of Polanski coasting through this one, rather than investing much of himself or injecting it with the unmistakable personal touches that reliably marked his earlier work. Shot in Prague on extensive sets, it's a good-looking enterprise outfitted with detailed production design and costumes. Rachel Portman's score hits the dramatic musical cues with frequent obviousness. With its PG-13 rating, film is probably a bit strong for kids much under that age.

Early in the new rendition of Charles Dickens 's novel of social injustice, a camera shot briefly holds the friendless orphan between the bars of the workhouse gate. Oliver Twist  (Barney Clark ) is in prison, where he was born and where he is destined, though not absolutely guaranteed, to die. Previous attempts to adapt the harsh and problematic Oliver Twist  for the screen have not aged well: Alec Guinness 's grotesque portrayal of Fagin, with a huge hook nose prosthetic in a key supporting role, deformed David Lean 's lavish 1948 try, while the musical revue Oliver!  (1968) wore itself out with frenetic camp. If a 21st-century version is necessary, then Roman Polanski 's your man: In his films, as in Dickens, the strong prey upon the weak with a monomaniacal glee that often borders on the grimly comic, while the director's own blighted childhood lends an inevitable autobiographical frisson to Oliver's travails.
Accomplished if lacking in urgency, this Oliver Twist  (scripted by Ronald Harwood , who also wrote The Pianist ) showcases Polanski's proven gift for Dickensian caricature, beginning with the jowly ranks of the workhouse board, a quivering pile of gluttonous entitlement. Harry Eden  conjures a spry, confident, yet vulnerable Artful Dodger (and pulls off a delightful meat-under-hat trick to boot); Jamie Foreman 's Sykes is a discomfiting marvel of dead-eyed contamination; and Ben Kingsley 's wizened Fagin is a deeply ambivalent figureat once Oliver's benefactor and curse, he's by turns impish, repellent, avuncular, terrifying, and pathetic, and Kingsley simply disappears into this musty rag-and-bone shop. The film's real star, though, is Prague  in the role of East End London, which has rarely looked so infernal: a diseased tangle of cobblestone arteries choked with shit and trash and squalling herds of misery. Oliver Twist is a horror movie, but as its potent last scenes attest, there's a twinge of the supernatural about its hero's resilient goodness. The quality of mercy is strained, but by some strange feat it doesn't dissolve entirely.
