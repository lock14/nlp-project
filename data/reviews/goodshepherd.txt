Damon here abandons the cat-and-mouse theatrics of his Bourne identity to play Edward Wilson, the reserved fictional functionary whose life serves as the prism through which The Good Shepherd
 examines the early years of the CIA. Damon plays Wilson as a tight-lipped, button-down professional, the kind of bright and dependable guy the WWII-era OSS and later the fledgling, postwar CIA would recruit to oversee their shadowy and covert spy operations. There's fascinating material here in this behind-the-curtain look at the early formation of our nation's spy agencies. Screenwriter Eric Roth (Munich)
 has clearly done his homework, and episodes such as Wilson's college initiation into the secret Skull and Bones Society (the breeding ground for future presidents and captains of industry) and the group's private retreats to Deer Island are imbued with the sense of observing something strictly off-limits to the rest of us commoners. Despite successfully creating the illusion of forbidden glimpses, The Good Shepherd
 slogs through most of its lengthy running time. In his second turn in the director's chair, De Niro (who also has a cameo) is unable to marshall this film into an effectively told narrative. Adding to his difficulty is the film's nonlinear structure, which jumps around in time for scenes from Wilson's childhood, his recruitment in 1939 during his college career, years spent in Europe during the war, years spent at the CIA's Langley headquarters, the Cold War, and the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The out-of-order sequencing adds little in terms of thematic structure, and thwarts all attempts to get swept up in the film's narrative flow. Further muddling the cloak-and-dagger dynamics is a wholly melodramatic storyline about Wilson's loveless marriage to Margaret "Clover" Russell (Jolie), the sister of a college classmate who maneuvers Wilson to the altar. Although you might anticipate any marriage portrayed onscreen by Damon and Jolie to sizzle with sex appeal, this affair droops with disdain and indifference. The marriage is a marked contrast to the passion we witness in Wilson's college romance with a deaf girl named Laura (Blanchard, in a marvelous performance), which provides a hint of what might of become of this man if the government hadn't gotten its hooks into him first. Only Turturro, playing Wilson's  streetwise adjutant, adds any personality to this drama. Certainly, the absence of personality that's required for the job but is ruinous to family life is one of the film's primary points. The conundrum, however, is how to make a movie about close-to-the-vest characters without making a movie that's drained of all life. A section of the film concerning Wilson's grown son makes the rigors of the clandestine life all too clear, but it comes too late in the story and serves mostly as a reminder that the thorny relationship between fathers and sons is as central to this movie as it was in De Niro's first directing job, 1993's A Bronx Tale
. Like Wilson's hobby of building little ships in bottles, these good shepherds know how to keep their innards reined in while never solving the bigger mysteries of how and why.


For his second directing assignment, Robert De Niro has taken on the unenviable task of dramatizing the story of the CIA. It's a big, unwieldy thing whose recorded histories already number in the dozens. "The Good Shepherd" focuses on the agency's start as the tiny Office of Strategic Services and its evolution into a Cold War-era outfit maneuvering against the KGB. We're shown how a government group's patriotic aim to keep America safe had gone dangerously to its head by the time of the Kennedy administration.
Ambitious and timely as it is, this look at the politics of national security is always at odds with the obligation to entertain. Lest it fail to be taken seriously, De Niro tries to keep "The Good Shepherd" from moving as swiftly as an airport page-turner. The result is a movie that lumbers between its domestic and international intrigues.
Screenwriter Eric Roth , who's logged many hours in the 20th-century history department ("Forrest Gump," "Munich"), has winnowed the CIA's evolution down to one fictional man. His name is Edward Wilson, and Matt Damon stares through the character's horn-rimmed glasses with a mortician's solemnity. But De Niro tries to inject levity and a thrill where he can, kicking off the picture with a bang of sorts: grainy footage of what looks like two bodies writhing in passion. Who are they? Why are we watching them?
To solve that mystery (it has something to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion), the film moves backward every now and then to tell Wilson's story. In the early going, he's shown peering through blinds like Norman Bates in "Psycho" (Damon's entire performance is intelligently observational). Then, to show us that he wasn't always so dour, it's back to 1939, where Wilson is camping it up in drag for a Yale undergraduate production of "H.M.S. Pinafore."
Wilson is a sensitive English major whisked from intimate poetry seminars to induction into Skull and Bones, the university's most elite secret society, which for years flourished as a brotherhood for the rich white men groomed to become the country's future leaders. Among other hazing rituals, Wilson mud wrestles and shares a traumatic boyhood confession about his late father.
At Yale, an F B I operative, played with fine average-Joe crustiness by Alec Baldwin, recruits Wilson for a covert assignment. He's to spy on his beloved poetry professor (Michael Gambon ), who might be recruiting for a Nazi front. The job is presented as a patriot's duty, and Wilson's reluctance to carry through is reversed by an unseemly and preposterously convenient act of impropriety.
In any case, Wilson trades his promise as a man of letters for a life of conspiracy, quickly climbing the ranks of the CIA, a far more insidious secret society, many of whose masters are blue-blooded Bonesmen, including William Hurt as the agency's director. De Niro shows up as Bill Sullivan, the wheelchaired Army general who helped shape American intelligence.
The movie goes out of its way to show Wilson as simultaneously flawed and exemplary. He marries Clover, a Bonesman senator's daughter (Angelina Jolie), only because he got her pregnant, and he did that only because his sweet, hearing-impaired girlfriend (Tammy Blanchard ) was too virtuous to have sex with him.
Thanks to an assignment from his higher-ups, he spends six years apart from the wife he barely knows. He's plopped in Europe near the start of World War II, where he gets an education in espionage from a sleek British spy, played by Billy Crudup .
Those on-the-job tutorials are useful for Wilson's most pressing adversary, his KGB counterpart (Oleg Stefan ), whose nickname is "Ulysses." The Russian, in turn, calls Wilson "Mother," and there's a wonderful insinuating tinge of affection when he does.
The American's attempts to outsmart him turns the movie into a suspenseful sort of intellectual chase picture. Indeed, "The Good Shepherd" is chock full of everything -- assassinations, betrayal, comeuppance, marital discord, the rise of Castro, an intense torture sequence, defenestration, John Turturro as a sociopath agent, De Niro "Strangelove"-ing it up in that wheelchair, the brief return of Joe Pesci as an informant, and a manmade plague of locusts.
But that also leaves it a 2 1/2-hour farrago: a character study, a soap opera, a psychological profile, and a docudrama full of Roth's obvious affinity for cool spy jargon ("The doctor has no more patients," says Hurt to Damon about a CIA-backed coup in Cuba).
"The Good Shepherd" is based vaguely on the life of the former long-serving CIA chief James Angleton . Needless to say, Angleton cut a more complexly paranoid figure in "Cold Warrior, " Thomas Mangold's biography, and a loonier one in William F. Buckley Jr.'s inane but readable fictional account, "Spytime. " The movie uses Angleton's legacy to a strictly cautionary end.
De Niro seems to enjoy himself only in the last stages of the picture when the flashbacks finally -- finally
 -- catch up to the present and the Wilson family's trashy domestic drama, which includes a plot twist between Wilson and the adult son desperate for his father's love. The dam breaks on the film's rank urges, and, dramatically, the film is better for it.
Still "The Good Shepherd" leaves you longing for the other, better political thrillers it evokes. You crave the speculative audacity of "JFK," the grim existential chill of "The Third Man," or the darkening psychosexual contours of "The Conformist," a film with which it has a lot in common. "The Good Shepherd" is also a portrait of a man shaped by, and shaping, a dangerous political age. But De Niro's movie doesn't know what to make of its title character. Wilson drifts through the highlights of the Cold War impervious to his lethal machinations. This is a deadly, dirty job he has, and it's a mystery as to whether he's pleased to do it.


         Given that its subject matter is spying, counterespionage and the Central Intelligence Agency, it's not an accident that the first words we hear in "The Good Shepherd" turn out to be a complete lie.
 
  "You are safe here with me," a woman says to a man, but it's not true. In fact, this complex, quietly dramatic film creates a world where that sentence is never true, a world of constant, mind-altering betrayal and mistrust, a world that makes the biblical words carved on the CIA building in Langley, Va. — "And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free" — seem ironic at best.
 


         






    It's taken a dozen years for Eric Roth's smart, thoughtful, psychologically complicated script to reach the screen under Robert De Niro's careful and methodical direction, and it is easy to see why.
 
  When Hollywood thinks spies, it thinks "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," it doesn't want to deal with an intricate, deliberately paced 2-hour and 37-minute work that not only quietly presents this quicksand world but also makes us feel what it would be like to live in it.
 
  At the heart of this drama is Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), whose life in and out of the agency we follow for more than 35 years. He is the spymaster's spymaster, in the espionage business from the earliest World War II days of the Office of Strategic Services, the organization that gave birth to the CIA.
 
  Wilson, however, will remind no one of James Bond. He is a gray bureaucrat, a meticulous perfectionist, seemingly humorless and emotionless, who speaks only when he feels he has something worthwhile to say.
 
  One of the earliest glimpses we have of Wilson, however — playing Little Buttercup in drag in a Yale performance of "HMS Pinafore" — gives the hint of the potential development of another kind of man.
 
  What "The Good Shepherd" is intent on showing us is how the one man became the other, how Edward Wilson's belief in duty above all else became his salvation and his betrayal, how a version of doing the right thing took over his life. It's about how a soulless occupation can destroy souls, about the price you pay for being the way you are.
 
  Damon, in his second major role of the year (after "The Departed") once again demonstrates his ability to convey emotional reserves, to animate a character from the inside out and create a man we can sense has more of an interior life than he is willing to let on.
 
  An argument could be made, in fact, that De Niro himself, famously undemonstrative in interview situations, was in part able to direct this role and this picture so well because he perhaps saw something of himself in its protagonist.
 
  Because of the great regard his fellow performers have for him, De Niro was able to attract an impressive cast of costars. These include — besides Michael Gambon as a Yale professor, Angelina Jolie as Wilson's wife and Tim Hutton in flashback as his father — a notable group of fellow intelligence operatives: Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Lee Pace and John Turturro. Not as well known but equally strong are Tammy Blanchard as an early romantic attachment and Eddie Redmayne as Wilson's adult son.
 
  The film's frame is the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco, the failed invasion of Cuba that will likely cause some heads to roll. As Wilson tries to find out what went wrong and to protect himself from internal attacks that could come from anywhere, a series of flashbacks shows us how he went from an idealistic Yale man to someone fanatically dedicated to his World War II work to the troubled man locked in a Cold War dance of death with his Soviet opposite number.
 
  There's way more plot in "The Good Shepherd" than can be easily summarized, and that is a good thing. And even though some things are expected, like coded dialogue of the "I'm here to see the tailor about a fitting" variety, much of what's here is not.
 
  An extended series of sequences, for instance, showing in detail how the agency goes about analyzing a photograph and a tape recording to see where they're from, are truly fascinating.
 
  Though biographer Tom Mangold, author of "Cold Warrior: James Jesus Angleton: The CIA's Master Spyhunter," is thanked in credits, it is clear from interviews that "The Good Shepherd" is most concerned about being true to the spirit and broader truths of the spy game than any specific details. When Gambon's Dr. Fredericks, a professor of poetry, tells young Wilson "you have to look behind the words to understand the meaning," he is telling us all we need to know.
 
 
 "The Good Shepherd."
 MPAA rating: R for some violence, sexuality and language. Running time: 2 hours, 37 minutes. In general release.   

The Good Shepherd  is a buttoned-up, shadowy dramatic recounting of the early days of the buttoned-up, shadowy Central Intelligence Agency. Here, the entire CIA is embodied by a zip-lipped, fictionalized founding operative named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon). Normally I would assume that such a pronounced tonal echo of the hush-hush subject matter is deliberate on the part of a director as serious-minded as Robert De Niro. But the movie, with its factoid-oriented script by Eric Roth (The Insider , Forrest Gump ), is also adamant in its insistence that a good CIA type doesn't trust anybody. So now I'm second-guessing: Did the filmmakers really intend The Good Shepherd  to be so methodical, so glum, and so unemotional?
If they did, was the casting of live wire Angelina Jolie as Wilson's frustrated wife (lassoed in ladylike dresses and pearls) a ruse, dangling a headline-grabbing star famous for her sexuality in a determinedly unsexy production? And one more conundrum: Does the movie actually succeed because of its failure to make the founding of the CIA exciting or even entirely intelligible?
Thus does paranoia play a part in fathoming this well-bred, slippery production. Wilson, we learn in one of the movie's many portentous flashbacks, was a WASPy boy of good breeding whose father committed suicide when Wilson was young; the young man was a member of the ultrasecret Skull and Bones society at Yale University, a club famous for its arcane rituals (and therefore a fertile breeding ground for future judges, spooks, and U.S. presidents, including former CIA chief and 41st president George H.W. Bush). A principled square so committed to patriotism that he turns in his admired poetry professor (Michael Gambon, just one of the many plummies in supporting roles) as a Nazi sympathizer, Wilson proves himself over the years to be a perfect spy indeed, doing the right thing even when there is no clear right thing to do, e.g., when the Cold War with the Soviet Union is at its perilously iciest. The toll such a stoppered-up existence takes on those closest to Wilson is severe (he misses an early chance at real love with a sweet, deaf young woman played by Tammy Blanchard; his relationship with his own sad adult son, played by Eddie Redmayne, is desperately strained). But still he puts on his pinched  little hat and glasses and pledges allegiance.
Matt Damon has had a great year at the movies, first with The Departed , as a cop with secret loyalties, and now as a company man of the highest order. As he has aged from boyishness into full manhood, the actor has excelled at subverting the all-American openness he projects and creating characters more adept at thinking on their feet than they're given credit for. Here, he's the ultimate enigma machine, a man willing to erase himself for his country. Does that make him a hero? The Good Shepherd  is too closemouthed to let on.

 “The Good Shepherd,” a chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. In between there is a spicy, lively interlude in the 1930’s at Yale University, where little boys are made of skull and bones and secret societies. Yale leads to World War II, cloak and dagger and a British spy cut from the same bespoke cloth as Kim Philby. Then it’s over to Washington, where the citadels of power loom against the cheerless sky like tombstones.  Mr. Damon, who plays a super-spy warrior in the “Bourne” films, excels at secretive men, and few are as mysterious as Edward Wilson, the spy catcher in “The Good Shepherd.” (The title refers to the Bible passage in which Jesus says: “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”) Though a composite,  Wilson seems largely based on the fascinating, freakishly paranoid James Jesus Angleton, a Yale graduate and poetry lover who served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and ran C.I.A. counterintelligence from 1954 to 1974.  Mr. Angleton cultivated orchids; Wilson builds the more prosaically symbolic miniature ships in bottles.  Mr. Angleton is now widely thought to have hurt the C.I.A. more than he helped it, and articles on the agency’s Web site (cia.gov) frame his tenure in generally unfavorable terms (it had “devastating results,” for one). Written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro, “The Good Shepherd” doesn’t address the full consequences of that devastation, partly because it wants to take on the institution as well as the man, and partly, one imagines, because Mr. Angleton’s crippling paranoia would have been too difficult to shape into a neat narrative. “The Good Shepherd” is an origin story about the C.I.A., and for the filmmakers that story boils down to fathers who fail their sons, a suspect metaphor that here becomes all too ploddingly literal.  Certainly fathers and sons offer a serviceable alternative to martinis and Aston Martins. Created in 1947, the C.I.A. has been responsible for many deeds, including our abiding fascination with spooks. No matter which way public sentiment shifts about the agency and its handiwork (Chile, Nicaragua), we remain fascinated with spies, or at least an idea of them, an idea in which matchbox cameras and microphones invariably figure more prominently than miles of locked filing cabinets. Secrets make agencies like the C.I.A. sexy, no matter how rumpled the raincoats. The most interesting thing about “The Good Shepherd” is how hard the filmmakers work not only to demystify the agency, but also to strip it of its allure, its heat.  In “Betrayal,” a book about Aldrich Ames,  the double agent who for years ferried C.I.A. secrets to the Soviets, the agency is characterized as “a cross between Yale’s secret Skull and Bones society and the post office.” In its basic outline Mr. Roth’s overly busy screenplay takes the same approach to the agency as it follows Wilson’s journey through institutions of power. At Yale he joins the Skull and Bones, where the power elite helps reproduce itself by bonding and dressing like the orgiastic partygoers in “Eyes Wide Shut.” The all-male members of this clandestine group don’t have sex with one another, at least on screen, but they do mud-wrestle naked, a ritual that underscores the homosocial nature of Wilson’s world.  Yale and World War II are the juiciest bits of the story, partly because they involve the charismatic Dr. Fredericks, played by a superb Michael Gambon. A Yale professor with a leer as insinuating as his walking stick, Dr. Fredericks tries to seduce Wilson into some antidemocratic chicanery through their shared love of poetry. (At Yale, Mr. Angleton helped found a poetry magazine in which he published Ezra Pound, a family acquaintance.) This attempted seduction parallels a rather more comical one involving Angelina Jolie, who plays Margaret Russell, the sister of  another Yale student. With her poppy-red lipstick and raucously aggressive sexuality, Margaret proves a far more successful seducer than Dr. Fredericks, as female pulchritude and power triumph over manly poetry and secrets.  Ah, but not for long. This is a man’s world, after all, filled with specters skulking through alleys with blood on their hands and the world on their shoulders. Conscripted into the O.S.S., Wilson travels to London, where he apprentices in espionage and intelligence and meets Arch Cummings (Billy Crudup), a fop with a posh accent patterned on Kim Philby. The film shies away from the more provocative aspects of Mr. Angleton’s long acquaintance with Mr. Philby, and the years they lunched together while Mr. Philby worked for the Soviets. Whatever its true nature, the friendship hurt Mr. Angleton’s marriage, as he later admitted: “Once I met Philby, the world of intelligence that had once interested me consumed me. The home life that had seemed so important faded in importance.”  That spells trouble for Ms. Jolie, alas, who after her spectacular entrance has to spend most of the film as the aggrieved, abandoned wife. It is not a good fit. A force of nature, Ms. Jolie reads more believably when she’s running through the jungle in boots and a bikini, as she does in the “Tomb Raider” flicks, than when standing on the sidelines in a domestic nightmare. But stand and screech and gamely slosh the booze she does while Mr. Damon’s spy helps win the war and later helps turn the C.I.A. into a shadow empire with some dependable character actors: Mr. De Niro as one of the agency’s founders, the dependably great Alec Baldwin as an F.B.I. agent and an equally fine William Hurt as the pipe-smoking head of the C.I.A.  Mr. De Niro does fine in his avuncular role and, in the main, even better as the film’s director. He imbues “The Good Shepherd” with a funereal vibe that works especially well on the dark, dank streets of London, where Wilson learns his first repellent lesson in spy-catching, and during his early years in Washington. Among the film’s most striking visual tropes is the image of Wilson simply going to work in the capital alongside other similarly dressed men, a spectral army clutching briefcases and silently marching to uncertain victory. In silhouette the men recall the gangsters in a Jean-Pierre Melville film, even as their anonymity evokes the drones in Madeleine L’Engle’s book “A Wrinkle in Time” who are ruled by an evil disembodied brain called IT.  Who rules the drones in “The Good Shepherd”? Who is IT? The president, the people, American mining and banana companies, the ghosts of fathers past, the agency itself? It’s hard to know, though now the C.I.A. answers to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These are hard questions, but they are also too big, too complex and perhaps too painful for even this ambitious (2 hours, 37 minutes) project, which can only elude and insinuate, not enlighten and inform. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, and the postwar Berlin rubble looks as real as the documentary footage of Fidel Castro slipped between the lightly fictionalized intrigue, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create.  “The Good Shepherd” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying  parent or adult guardian). There is some violence, including a scene of torture, as well as adult language and tactful sex.

The birth of the CIA and the life journey of one of its founding operatives is a fascinating subject, one that is done only lukewarm justice in "The Good Shepherd." Robert De Niro's second film as a director adopts a methodical approach and deliberate pace in attempting to grasp an almost forbiddingly intricate subject, with a result that is not boring, exactly, but undeniably tedious. Cast and material's intrinsic interest will provide a sufficient media profile for a decent B.O. launch, but lack of excitement and suspense will translate into a quick commercial fade.
Eric Roth's heavily researched original script fictionalizes known events big and small as it hops, skips and jumps through some 40 years of an ever-changing geopolitical landscape. Pivoting on the CIA's role in the failed Bay of Pigs operation in 1961, ambitious yarn casts its eye on such other historical signposts as the Skull & Bones society, the formation of the OSS on the eve of World War II and the long chess game of the Cold War, all the while developing an arching theme involving the legacies of fathers and sons.
Given the glacial emotional temperature and withholding nature of the characters, it would not be surprising to learn that De Niro's artistic template here was the Al Pacino portion of "The Godfather: Part II," which itself serves as a reminder that executive producer Francis Ford Coppola once planned to direct this project himself.
But the long and short of the problem is that the director never finds a proper rhythm to allow the viewer to settle comfortably into what turns out to be a very long voyage. Like many films of the moment, this one keeps jumping around in time, not confusingly in the least, but in a way that has no natural flow to it. Tie that to a central character who defiantly offers no glimpse into his inner life and you have a picture that offers scant returns for the investment of time it requests of the viewer.
Beginning with a sketchy account of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the narrative bounces back to 1939, when blueblooded Yale student Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is initiated into the secret future leaders training ground, Skull & Bones -- which in turn triggers another flashback to 20 years earlier, when little Edward discovered the body of his father, who committed suicide.
A square, upright fellow with a gift for poetry, Edward attracts the attention of an FBI agent (Alec Baldwin), to whom Edward displays his advanced sense of loyalty by exposing the evident Nazi connections of his doting English professor (Michael Gambon). In this patriotic act of personal betrayal, a long and fruitful career begins.
A man of few words and no humor, Edward possesses a purposefulness that impresses the high society of his classmates. His stony seriousness poses only a momentary challenge to a spirited and flirtatious senator's daughter, Clover (Angelina Jolie), who gets herself knocked up just as Edward has taken an interest in an appealing deaf girl, Laura (Tammy Blanchard). Edward dutifully marries Clover and promptly disappears for six years to blitz-plagued London at the behest of "Wild Bill" Sullivan (De Niro in a wryly sage turn), who's been put in charge of FDR's foreign intelligence unit, the nascent Office of Strategic Services.
When Edward finally returns, he meets his son but has virtually nothing to say to the wife he scarcely knows. Things remain frosty between them, a consequence of Edward's professional policy of disclosing nothing and trusting no one. But it's one of the film's key failings that this relationship is never defined at least to the point of explaining why Clover stays with Edward when he ignores her so totally, a situation aggravated by the casting of Jolie, who one knows would never sit around waiting for a man forever.
Nevertheless, Edward Jr. (Eddie Redmayne, good) comes to play a critical role in his father's life, as shadowy exchanges between East and West come to dominate. Particularly central is the CIA's wary acceptance of a Soviet defector, Valentin (John Sessions), only to be confounded by the later arrival of another Russian (Mark Ivanir) claiming to be the real Valentin, all against the backdrop of Edward's efforts to learn all he can about his own KGB counterpart, "Ulysses" (Oleg Stefan).
Inherent tragedy of the story lies in the seeming inevitability of betrayal on both personal and professional fronts when matters are pushed to their furthest limits. Here, too, are found echoes of the "Godfather" films, but the thematic similarities merely point up "The Good Shepherd's" shortcomings where directorial command is concerned. Crucially missing is slowly building momentum, a firm hand on pace, a way to convey gradual moral decay and a talent for magisterial storytelling, gifts that are impossible to fake in the long run.
Seemingly based in great measure on the ever-intriguing James Angleton, Damon's Edward remains an opaque, impenetrable figure throughout, and neither actor nor script provides the subtext to reveal any layers of personality. Many of the supporting players provide welcome personal flavors, but thesping overall is restrained rather than flashy or deeply felt.
Considerable care has gone into period details, as exemplified by the rich contributions of production designer Jeannine Oppewall, costume designer Ann Roth and cinematographer Robert Richardson, which combine for a darkly burnished look. Score by Marcelo Zarvos and Bruce Fowler provides imaginative, atypical backdropping.

It took Norman Mailer  seven years and 1,282 pages to write 1991's Harlot's Ghost: A Novel of the CIA  , and if memory serves, it took me 12 years to actually finish it. So director Robert De Niro  and screenwriter Eric Roth  can be forgiven for taking two hours and 40 minutes to tell The Good Shepherd  (a/k/a A Movie of the CIA )but then why does it feel so empty? As long as it is, Shepherd  speeds through its leading man's life, cramming in 30 years without elaborating on any of them. The fictional story here is about Edward Wilson  (Matt Damon ), a CIA agent tied to the failed Bay of Pigs  invasion. Edward's involvement in the spy business dates back to his days studying poetry at Yale , where he was indoctrinated into the world of deceit though Skull and Bones. Then he's off to fight World War II as an agent in the Office of Strategic Services , then it's the Cold War, and then and then and then.
The Good Shepherd needed to be either considerably longermore like 1979's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy  miniseriesor considerably shorter (word has it De Niro cut 30 minutes). Right now, it's stuck in the deadly dull middle in which everything happens but nothing matters since the filmmakers can't stick with one event or idea long enough for it to, well, stick.
When first introduced, Edward's leaving for Cuba with his right-hand man Ray (John Turturro , who valiantly attempts to breathe life into Damon's corpse). All, of course, does not go well. There's been a leak, and Edward's boss (William Hurt ) suspects that it's Edward. Later we flash back to Yale in the '30s, where Edward is splayed nude on a couch, revealing tales to his well-heeled brethren of a suicidal daddy who shamed the family. And not long after that, Edward's ratting out a Nazi-sympathizing poetry professor (Michael Gambon ) at the request of the FBI . Oh yes, there is time for love, first with a deaf girl played by Tammy Blanchard , and then with Angelina Jolie , who stumbles into the picture as a woman looking to trap the right kind of husband, whom she keeps for no apparent reason at all. (A Damon-Jolie pairing is hardly as sexy as it sounds; indeed, theirs is a glum and clumsy coupling.)
De Niro, who cameos as a secretive military man hobbled by a rotting foot, and Roth, who penned Munich   hobbled by guilt, intend theirs as a movie about the consequences of keeping secrets in the name of national security. Shepherd  is supposed to be about the breaking of the heart and the gutting of the soulthe hollow nothing left when you're constantly told to trust no one , not even a wife or a son or the ghost of a dead father who went to his grave burdened by his own furtive follies (played for a few seconds of screen time by Timothy Hutton ). Yet, to care about how secrets eradicate our humanity, you must first have humans, and Edward is barely that.
The story should heat up once Edward is suspected of being a mole, but Roth and De Niro, so eager to show off their meticulous research and shine a bright light onto the world of shadows, have no interest in something as conventional as a whodunit. The closest the movie ever comes to a throughline is the story involving a KGB  agent nicknamed Ulysses (Oleg Stefan ) and Edward's grown-up son (Eddie Redmayne ), but just as we begin to understand that complex relationship and the movie begins to lurch forward, we're thrown back into Edward's past in a vain attempt to reveal something more about our Deep and Disturbed Man of Great Purpose and Mystery, who has found himself at the center of all this intrigue.
Certainly, the plight of the average man caught up in extraordinary circumstances can work; what else did Alfred Hitchcock  have up his sleeve but this one great gag? But De Niro and Roth want so badly to impart the details of the spy trade, to illuminate the entire history of the OSS and CIA, that they trade extraordinary for methodical, as the hush-hushed passing of manila folders between characters amounts to little more than tedious busywork. They do succeed at making the spy business appear routine, even mundane. What a feat.
