This world-famous British series is one of the great achievements of the cinema, one that reveals the potential of an observant camera plus the passage of time to capture reality. Begun 42 years ago in 1964, the UK-based World in Action team gathered a diverse group of 7-year-olds from all over England and asked them questions about their lives and thoughts regarding the future. The idea, which grew from the Jesuit saying "Give me a child until he is 7, and I will give you the man" was for Seven Up!
 to provide Britons with a sense of what life would be like in the year 2000 when these children were adults and reaching the height of their individual powers and societal contributions. Michael Apted, a crew member on the first film who has gone on to direct such Hollywood features as Coal Miner's Daughter
 and The World Is Not Enough
, has continued the series, revisiting the same individuals every seven years, and consequently creating a living portrait of … growth, atrophy, life, humanity. The last couple of series' entries, which caught the subjects at ages 28 and 35, found them mostly to be their first grownup successes and disappointments and gave the films a more downbeat quality as they recounted a succession of marital difficulties, parental passings, and the like. Now approaching the half-century mark, the participants at 49 seem more reflective, as they address new topics such as grandchildren, second homes, and career changes. They are also questioned about their feelings about being ongoing participants in this project, and the answers may be surprising in this age of ubiquitous celebrity. Viewing 49 Up
 does not require familiarity with the whole series in order to be appreciated. Snippets of footage of each subject throughout the years are included as the film seems to flash forward and back through each life. Consistencies, changes, the permutations of the flesh – all are fodder for the camera's gaze. Life happens in front of your eyes: It's sometimes fascinating, boring, revelatory, tedious, and compelling, but the movie camera almost seems custom-made to capture its essence. The films draw no definitive conclusions about the sum of their parts, although the sociological attention to class distinctions in the early years has given way to more psychological focus on individual development. What the series means in the long run is anybody's guess; I just know I sleep better at night knowing it's out there. AFS@Dobie



``49 Up" marks the latest chapter in one of the most ambitious documentary projects in movie history. Make that the history of any
 medium, for how often do we get to witness a time-lapse study of human life?
The British men and women who were interviewed as 7-year-olds in 1963, and to whom director Michael Apted (a BBC researcher on the first installment) has returned every seven years, are 49 now. Bald spots and bellies have broadened, wrinkles and wisdom have made inroads. Grandchildren are popping up along with second marriages. In general, the flesh is sagging but the spirits are, surprisingly, more at peace than in ``35 Up" or ``42 Up." The new film marks a period of serene reassessment between the struggles of early adulthood and the onset of old age.
Tony, the East End kid who became a cabbie when his jockey career didn't pan out, is still married to Debbie and their union is more solid than ever (now that he's no longer playing the field). Bruce, the Oxford grad whose life mission was to teach children in Bangladesh and London's poorer neighborhoods, has retreated to an upper-class public school, a victim of burnout. Nick, the farmer's son who became a physicist in America, has encountered career setbacks while finding new love with second wife Kris.
And what of Neil, the series' unofficial star, who moved from inquisitive childhood to homelessness and mental illness at 35? At 49, he's in Cumbria, in the northwest of England, living a frugal life as a local councilman and a licensed minister. Like the others, he's starting to look oldish, and like the others he's beginning to dwell on the long view. There is stock-taking in ``49 Up," and it includes the very film in which the subjects are taking part.
``Every seven years, a little pill of poison" is how Charles, an upper-class barrister, describes the project he never volunteered for. Some of the original 12 participants have dropped out over the years; Charles is one who has returned, if only to draw attention to his charity for Bulgarian schools. Nick makes no secret of his dislike of Apted and, in the film's most welcome and telling sequence, the tough-as-nails Jackie lets the director have it right in the class bias.
``You edit our problems as you see fit," she insists. ``I have no control over it. This may be the first one that's about us rather than your perception of us." She's right, and you understand her distress -- and also why she and the others keep opening their doors to Apted and his crew. The ``Up" series strips the human experience of any larger meaning we assign to it as we're in the trenches; it's a nature documentary about the life cycle of a curious animal called man.
If that's depressingly reductive, the films connect the dots of existence in a way that highlights a lovely commonality. No matter their wealth or social status, these people share disappointments and elations and a sense that life, in the end, may be what life is about. Some of them, like the upper-class Suzy, are fairly uninteresting, and this, of course, is what makes them interesting. No one deserves to be left out of the grand experiment.
If you're new to the project, ``49 Up" may leave you scratching your head. It's a holding pattern, an unresolved series of notes that will begin fading in future installments, as the subjects start passing away. If you've been with the ``Up" films for a while, though, this is a muted, reflective family reunion, and the family is bigger than the mind can entertain.


         The seventh installment in Michael Apted's ever-evolving masterpiece, "49 Up" is a buoyant surprise that, perhaps contrary to its initial assumptions, has in the long run defied more expectations than it has confirmed. Richer and more textured than its predecessors (each chapter includes interviews with the participants from every stage in the process), and more likely to inspire bouts of entirely defensible sentimentality (some reversals are nothing short of remarkable), "49 Up" is more than a deeply satisfying movie; it's a reminder of the wonder contained in ordinary lives. 
 FOR THE RECORD:



         






    '49 Up': A review of the film "49 Up" in Friday's Calendar section said that one of the men featured in the movie was married to a professor at the University of Minneapolis. She is a professor at the University of Minnesota. —
 
  A project begun 42 years ago for BBC Films by the British television company Granada Films, where Apted was a researcher, the series was inspired by the Jesuit maxim, "Give me a child until he is 7 and I will give you the man." After the latest update, the Jesuits might want to rethink the saying.
 
  In the original program, "7 Up," 14 7-year-old British kids from different backgrounds were randomly selected and asked to share their views on love, family, money, education, class and their hopes for the future. The results were predictably hilarious. (Charles, an upper-class boy at a private preparatory school, famously explained that it was right for schools to cost money or else "the poor would come rushing in.") Also crystal clear was the film's not-so-sly class-related agenda. The two boys growing up in group homes, and probably the farmer's son, would come up against the limitations of their birth at some point. The girls, regardless of class, would grow up, get married and have babies.
 
  In fact, the three upper-class boys did — apparently breezily — fulfill their dreams of attending Oxford and Cambridge and going into law; and after a brief bout of cynicism following her parents' divorce, the well-heeled Suzy snaps into a happy marriage with a suitably rich husband.
 
  Otherwise, for the rest, life has more closely resembled a journey of discovery. Mischievous East Ender turned London cabby Tony, who dreamed of becoming a jockey, rebounds from what looks like the end of his marriage at age 42 and emerges as an energetic retiree in Spain, re-bonded to his wife and giddily surrounded by grandchildren ("It's like an obsession of love," he says, explaining how the feeling differs from that of having children). Farmer's son Nick becomes a physicist and professor in Wisconsin but carries a sense of loss for his faraway roots that surprises him still and is echoed in his happy second marriage to a professor at the University of Minneapolis who lives five hours away.
 
  As though confirming more recent views on the nature-nurture debate, the film quite incidentally raises issues of personality. Simon, who grew up in a group home, struggles with ongoing depression but survives it with the help of a loyal, cheerful wife. Neil, who grew up middle class with two parents in a suburb of Liverpool, struggles with it too, and is all but done in.
 
  Jackie, the chubby East End girl who confronted Apted at 21 for suggesting she was too young to get married (she later divorced, remarried and divorced again), confronts Apted a second time for focusing on her illness (rheumatoid arthritis) in the last installment. When the director asks what she'd rather he focus on, she says she wishes he'd ask her what she still hopes to do.
 
  The subjects' across-the-board staunch hope and constant desire for transformation is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the film. From the solicitor to the cabby to the once-homeless drifter, the participants display an astonishing capacity for change. After decades of work, strife, disillusionment and adjusted expectations, all of them (including, presumably, the two who dropped out, now documentary filmmakers) have found their happy endings; the more modest and hard-won, the more poignant. Neil, who began life as a bright, spirited, confident middle-class boy and drifted into homelessness and psychological turmoil, finds peace and contentment late in life as a Liberal Democrat councilor. His success, in part, is owed to the help of another subject, Bruce, the public schoolboy who dreamed of going to Africa to help people.
 
  Nearly half a century since its inception, Apted's sociological look at England has evolved into a stunningly comprehensive document of life in the late 20th century and at the turn of the millennium. "49 Up" is more than a film. It's an affirmation of life that feels like a gift.

There's a Jesuit saying that goes something like ''Give me the child until he is 7 and I will give you the man.'' 49 Up  says, here is  the man  and behold, he is a grandfather, too. At least, Tony is, the cab driver who, as a boy, dreamed of becoming a jockey. The 14 British children of varied background who were first interviewed about their lives 42 years ago in the trailblazing TV documentary Seven Up!  are now nearing the half-century mark. And the seventh edition of this singular series, begun by a team from Britain's Granada TV and devotedly updated every seven years hence under the direction of Michael Apted (he began as a Granada researcher), only deepens our awe: Not only do we marvel at the miracle of individual human personality and the self-acceptance that can be a hard-won benefit of aging, but we also give thanks for the honor these men and women have bestowed on us in continuing to open their private selves to millions of strangers. Even the ones who have chosen not to participate make a silent statement about the dignity of choice.
As ever, Apted weaves in snippets of previous footage to illuminate the shape of the person we see before us. Neil, the sensitive boy who had unraveled by the time he was in his 20s, has always been the series' most fragile participant, and it's deeply moving to meet up with him again  now sturdy in his own way. But it may well be Jackie, one of the working-class children, who comes to represent this latest installment at its most powerful: Challenging her unseen interlocutor, she makes clear that she is who she is  not who Apted or anybody else who ever saw her at 7, 14, 21, and up might have imagined or wanted her to be. As real as reality TV is fake, 49 Up  is a precious document, and must viewing.
[Previous films in the Up  series were collected in a DVD box reviewed here   in 2004]

 Like its predecessors “49 Up” begins with black-and-white images of British children frolicking on a playground, as a portentous voice-over recites a Jesuit maxim: “Give me the child until he is 7, and I will show you the man.” Ever since they were heard in “7 Up!,” a “World in Action” television documentary first broadcast in 1964, those words have served as the motto for one of the most remarkable experiments in the history of cinema.  Every seven years the director Michael Apted has checked in with as many of those children as were willing to sit for his camera. The resulting films — 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and now “49 Up” — have confirmed, complicated and in some cases subverted the assumptions of that first inquiry, which promised a glimpse of Britain’s future.  The subjects ranged from children of London’s rough-and-tumble East End to the son of a Yorkshire farmer to three upper-class schoolboys, quite certain at 7 that they were bound for Oxford or Cambridge. But now that they have settled into middle age  — discovering that the thinning of hair and the thickening of midsections respect no rank or station — their lives reveal less about the British class system than about marriage, family relations and the slow turns of the life cycle.  In many ways they are more alike than different. Most married younger than their American counterparts and are now sending their children out into the world, or in some cases welcoming grandchildren. No longer sociological case studies — the boys from the group home, the girls from the council houses, the suburban lads on their bicycles — they are now stubborn and unforgettable individuals. Tony, Suzy, John, Jackie, Andrew, Bruce, Sue, Simon, Paul, Lynn, Nick and Neil: each is a universe of perceptions and experiences, some of which they explain to Mr. Apted, who remains discreetly unseen.  “Forty-Nine Up,” screening tonight at the New York Film Festival and opening nationwide tomorrow, feels less dramatic than the earlier films, which sometimes revealed shocking changes and reversals. The surprises that pop up here — a divorce, a remarriage, a bout of depression, the threat of a lost job — are less dramatic, and the overall mood hovers somewhere between resignation and contentment. Forty-nine, it seems, is not an age for hatching  big plans or foreseeing major changes, but rather a time for taking stock, getting comfortable and keeping an eye on the next generation.  By now, if you have been following the series (and you can catch up with it thanks to a must-have DVD boxed set released two years ago by First Run Features), you recognize, for example, Tony’s playful good humor and entrepreneurial drive. Disappointed in his early hope of becoming a champion jockey, he did rather well as a London cab driver and occasional actor, and now he and his patient wife, Debbie, have built a vacation home on the sunny southern coast of Spain. You are also aware of Neil’s difficulties adjusting to adult life, and of the professional and marital ups and downs experienced by Sue, Jackie,  Suzy and the others.    Rarely has ordinary existence seemed so multifaceted and enigmatic, even in its banal everyday details. Mr. Apted’s method is straightforward. There are interviews, and what television producers call b-roll — slightly stiff sequences of the subjects pretending to go about their daily business at home or at work — and illustrative flashbacks to earlier episodes. Because Mr. Apted avoids intrusive cinéma vérité or tabloid television techniques, the feeling of intimacy, which has grown over time, is rarely uncomfortable.  Except, as it turns out, for the subjects themselves, several of whom reflect, with a degree of bitterness that may startle fans of the series, on how it has affected their lives. John, one of the public school boys whose conservatism announced itself early and has moderated only a little, compares the “Up” project to reality shows like “Big Brother” and “I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!”  Suzy, who could not meet the filmmaker’s eye at 14 and could barely control her anger at 21, has grown into a mild, apparently contented adult. Of her participation in the films, she says, “I haven’t enjoyed it in any way,” which feels like a rebuke not only to the filmmaker but to the audience as well.  It is impossible to dismiss her indictment, echoed by a handful of her peers. There is something ethically troubling about this project, however serious and high-minded it has been. But one of the remarkable things about these films, which have lavished so much attention, however unwelcome, on their subjects, is that the subjects turn out to be the most trenchant critics.  This only makes me like the films more, even as I feel a bit ashamed of myself for liking them so much. I agree: Suzy’s marriage, Nick’s divorce, Paul’s work history: none of it is my or anyone else’s business. But these things — these people — have become, through Mr. Apted’s films, a vital part of modern life, which seems to grow richer every seven years, when the new “Up” movie comes out.  49 UP  Plays tonight at the New York Film Festival; opens nationwide tomorrow.  Directed by Michael Apted; director of photography, George Jesse Turner; edited by Kim Horton; produced by Claire Lewis and Mr. Apted; released by First Run Features. Running time: 134 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown tonight at 6 at Alice Tully Hall, at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, as part of the 44th New York Film Festival; opens nationwide tomorrow; in Manhattan at the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. 

The seventh chapter in helmer Michael Apted's long-running "Up" docu series, "49 Up" follows diverse Brits first selected at age 7 as they now approach a surprisingly becalmed middle age. Stateside, First Run Features plans an early October theatrical bow, with fest dates prior to that and DVD sales sure to be brisk afterward.
Pic arrives at key moment in series history. Newly available boxed set of previous episodes ensures greater anticipation than ever before, while resulting familiarity with subjects is on par with any reality TV skein.
Unfortunate, then, that the docu reveals most of the subjects to be comfortably settled, if not downright happy. That may bode well for the glimpse of Britain's future promised by the original, which was based on the Jesuit maxim, "Give me the child until he is 7, and I will show you the man," it doesn't make for involving drama, unless the audience is already invested in the subjects' fortunes. Thus, "49 Up" will have more appeal for long-time followers than newcomers.
Neil, the most troubled of the group, has traveled from virtual homelessness in Thatcher-era England to a comfortable life as local politico in a northwest village. "There are many things in my life that could have happened," he says with a dignity tinged by regret, "but didn't."
Tony the aspiring jockey and amateur actor is still married to Debbie, and the two are seen enjoying their grandchildren at their second house on the Spanish coast. Bruce teaches at St. Albans; Nick has a pretty new wife, Chris; and Symon has returned from his self-imposed exile prior to "42 Up," and is seen palling around with Paul, who had set out for Australia. Lynn is still a librarian.
Only the always-feisty Jackie sounds any note of discord: "You will edit this program as you see fit, I've got no control over that," she says, angry at a perceived manipulation of their fortunes over the years. "This one may be -- may be -- the first one that's about us rather than about your perception of us." Maybe that's why there's a distinct lack of tension to the proceedings.
A few negative references to the Blair government are as close as the pic comes to reflecting the political mood of England.
Tech credits are clean, with no diminishment of the shock in seeing these brave, beleaguered citizens age in the blink of an eye. Pic retains the logo of "World in Action," the 1963-1998 Brit current affairs skein in which the series originated, and is dedicated to Aussie founding producer Tim Hewat, who died in a road accident in 2004.

Moving and ambitious in scale like nothing else in cinema, Michael Apted 's Up  films began in 1964 as a BBC  news program exploring an old Jesuit maxim: "Give me the child until he is seven, and I will show you the man." Using interviews of 14 randomly selected schoolchildren, Seven Up!  sought to probe English society as it was right then, "when the shop steward and the executive of 2000 are seven years old." Class was the not-so-secret subject initially, but with the press of years, something odd happened: life. As Apted returned at seven-year intervals to film these average representatives of British culture, the gut-level impact of the films has derived from how much or how little they've changed from the tykes we first knew. Everything becomes
We see the harrowing dynamic laid out for us like a timeline, and the effect of 42 years on a little girl's dimpled visage can be brutal to watch. Each Up  film uses footage from the early films, and so the average participant moves in the blink of an eye from being an immaculate schoolkid sprout to being a heap of dead wood, plagued by obesity, alcohol, emotional wear, bad English dentistry, and the thrashing of time. For under-30 viewers who still think they're immortal, the latest installment could very well be the grimmest and most haunting of horror films.
Still, Apted's achievement is one of essential humanity. (His other resume items, including the second-to-last Pierce Brosnan Bond  movie, are footnotes by comparison.) Try to think of another movie project that endeavors to capture in some fashion the entirety of a life's experience. We get just a taste of these lives, of course, the portion that Apted likes out of what his subjects allow him to see. But it's always been a given that the 12 interviewees (two of the original 14 dropped out in their twenties) are actually co-makers of the films, editing their own lives for Apted. (And who can say how much having a film crew track you down every seven years might affect your daily existence?) As it is, 49 Up  is a film in a continuumriveting for its place in the series. By itself, it can sometimes feel like grilling your ordinary neighbors about their history when they'd rather be washing the car.
As they eyeball their half-century, Apted's subjects are not so forthcoming anymore and feel, more than ever, perfectly free to bridle and bellyache about the seven-year-bitch experience that comes when they're forced again and again to evaluate their lives for the cameras and the audience. It's hard to blame them, popular notions of reality-TV fame lust notwithstanding. Jackiethe gregarious East End girl who grew up to be plagued by rheumatoid arthritisconfronts Apted directly about invasive questions going back decades, while Suzy, the camera-shy, upper-class waif who chain-smoked through the 21  episode, admits in peaceful middle age that the films have been "painful," "not something I've enjoyed in any way," and hopes not to continue.
The Jesuits prove to be mistaken in one aspectonly the wealthy, privileged kids became exactly what they'd intended (judges and lawyers). For everyone else life was a series of half-assed experiments, and their workaday outcomes are largely the product of luck. (The exception is Nick, the farmer's son who became a physicist and who still longs for Yorkshire.) In any case, political ideas don't quite survive the films' real-time historical reachlife takes over, in all of its banality, private pleasures, employment struggles, and divorce hurts.
Like the average life Apted hoped to peg, the Up  series has had an arc dramatically, 35 Up was its acme, startling in its juxtaposition between childhood innocence and the tolls of a hard midlife that had just begun to throw up challenges. 49 Up feels like a wind-down, the youthful cataclysms and crises long in the past. Only Neil, the cherubic would-be bus driver who spiraled into mental instability and homelessness in his twenties, still makes for an addictive and eloquent camera objecthe'd be the series' star even without his troubled path. Nowadays, he's still alone but rooted and housed, a local Liberal Democrat functionary in the north, dedicated to the public good. No one could've foreseen in 1964 that the only universal among the Up  kids would be hard-earned happy endings.
