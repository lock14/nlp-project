It�s a dicey business bringing a much-loved children's book to the big screen. So it is with Charlotte�s Web
, E.B. White�s brilliantly told tale of a runty pig named Wilbur (voiced by Kay) and his spider friend and savior, Charlotte (voiced by Roberts). Updated only slightly to accommodate the sensibilities of today�s kids, with their affection for digitally enhanced creatures and wisecracking sidekicks, this new version manages to lose very little of the sentimental sweetness and plainspoken nobility of the original. In fact, for modern-day kids fare, it�s a remarkably temperate and quiet movie. What Charlotte�s Web
 has always had going for it, and what I imagine kids will always cling to (regardless of technological advances), is a sweet, simple, and timeless story about the power of friendship and the acceptance of loss, a story that�s told faithfully here. And that ending is still a doozy.


The new, live-action version of "Charlotte's Web" has a weight problem. It's obese with talent.
The real, animatronic, and digitally enhanced farm critters all sound like famous people. Oprah Winfrey performs the voice of the mother goose figure, Gussy. Cedric the Entertainer is her mate, Golly. Robert Redford is Ike the horse. Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire do the voices of the cows Bitsy and Bessie. Steve Buscemi is Templeton the rat. John Cleese is Samuel the sheep. Supplied with E.B. White's ever eloquent 54-year-old prose, Sam Shepard narrates. And holy of holies: Julia Roberts is the divine Charlotte A. Cavatica, that crafty spider who devotes herself to saving her pig pal, Wilbur, from the slab.
If this sounds like inspired fun in the telling (and, my, does it), the movie is a chore to watch. Live-action is a nominal description, since much of the film is a point-and-shoot affair. The camera rests patiently in front of a particular animal while the famous person speaks, and because there is only so much, say, a live goose can do in a gauzy close-up, Winfrey's stuttering, down-home intonations overwhelm the shot.
This wasn't so with the animated version from 1973. There was harmony between voice and image. The fantastical particulars of that cartoon have hardened into this new movie's dusty approximation of actual farm life. Belching, selfish, and full of bad puns, Templeton the Rat may have been partly whipped up by a computer, but the slop in which he swims looks pretty real.
Dutifully directed by Gary Winick and adapted by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick , this live-action version holds on to White's morality -- but that and advances in animation are all the movie has to justify itself. In the opening scenes, young human Fern (Dakota Fanning) discovers one night that her father (Kevin Anderson) is about to slaughter a newborn runt. "If I had been born small, would you have killed me?" she demands, vowing to love and care for the piglet herself. To the dismay of her mother (Essie Davis) , Fern names it Wilbur and takes him to school and pushes him in a carriage. (Fanning gives the part surreal emotional conviction; does she know Fern is 12 and not 42?)
In no time, Wilbur grows too big for bottles and baths in the kitchen sink and is shipped to Fern's uncle's farm, where the pig starts talking (10-year-old Dominic Scott Kay gives it his endearingly chipper all). Between visits from Fern, Wilbur makes new barnyard friends, including Charlotte, who know all too well that pigs like Wilbur are doomed. So do we. Right after Fern promises Wilbur that "I absolutely will not let them kill you," we get a crude comic shot of bacon sizzling in a pan. In any case, Charlotte selflessly concocts schemes to keep Wilbur from a similar fate: She tells the world he's special.
Both this adaptation and Roberts make Charlotte instantly lovable. But in reading White's story all those years ago, I remember being touched by Charlotte's almost desperate loneliness and her over-eagerness to have a new friend. Roberts, as lovely as she makes Charlotte, is the only actor in the cast not playing her assigned critter. Hovering high above it all, she's playing Julia Roberts. While there are plenty of touching moments, this Charlotte is missing the early chill Debbie Reynolds induced in the 1973 version.
Most of the movie's creative juice has gone into that digitally conceived spider, too. Charlotte's web-spinning is the movie's visual high point. Everything else photographed in the barn, besides the shenanigans in Templeton's lair, feels dead on screen.
Nonetheless, this is preferable to the new-agey action-adventure that White's "Stuart Little" became seven years ago. And where the camera has been placed may not be something the average elementary-schooler cares about, anyway. Indeed, woe be to the child who doesn't mist up at this movie, since it's been made if not with zip, wit, or imagination, then at least with sweetness. But I hope no one will think the film is an adequate replacement for White's book. That would be a crime.


         The new live-action rendering of E.B. White's perennial children's favorite, "Charlotte's Web," is so carefully spun that it's lifeless. Which is ironic because, since it was first published in 1952, the book the movie is based on has been a gentle introduction for children to the harsh realities of the cycle of life.
 
 Adapted by Oscar nominee Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") and "Over the Hedge" writer-director Karey Kirkpatrick, the film is faithful to its source material and mercifully makes no attempt to update it with contemporary slang. The familiar tale of a runt pig named Wilbur who is saved from slaughter by a young girl named Fern (played by Dakota Fanning) and befriended by a spider with an appreciation for language is much the same as you would remember from reading it as a child or seeing the 1973 animated version.
 


         






   The action takes place primarily in a barn on the Zuckerman farm, where Wilbur (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) goes to live when he gets too big for Fern to care for and where he is surrounded by a menagerie of critters who initially have no use for the little porker. It takes the observations of Charlotte (voiced by Julia Roberts), the titular arachnid, to make the others realize Wilbur's special qualities. Acting as a sort of de facto publicist seeking to keep her porcine pal from the smokehouse, Charlotte spins the words "some pig" into her web, gaining the attention of Zuckerman and the outside world.
 
 The producers spared little expense in putting the voices of big-name actors into the computer-enhanced mouths of the animals. Besides Roberts, the vocal cast includes Robert Redford, Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire, Cedric the Entertainer, Thomas Haden Church and André Benjamin. All that star power, however, proves more distracting than anything else.
 
  Doesn't that goose sound like Oprah? What's John Cleese doing in a barn in Maine? Only Steve Buscemi as Templeton the Rat, the scene-stealing, self-centered rodent who grudgingly helps Charlotte, comes anywhere close to delivering a memorable performance. Comparisons with "Babe," which did the talking animal thing far better more than a decade ago, only underscore Wilbur and friends' shortcomings.
 
 Director Gary Winick ("13 Going On 30") and his production crew give the film a soft, timeless look, but the effect is largely flat. There is nothing discernibly awful about this "Charlotte's Web" other than it lacks the spark that would make it come alive on-screen. The ads promise magic, but apart from the requisite heart-tugging finale, what it delivers is uneventful.

It is no coincidence that the two most moving books I ever read as a child, Charlotte's Web  and Stuart Little , were both written by the same man, the great E.B. White, or that they were the two quietest  books I'd ever encountered. White, in his sublimely dotty illustrated talking-animal novels, conjured a gossamer dream of an earlier, gentler America: a tweedy, soothing, often rural place, too chock-full of homespun eccentrics to teeter into quaintness. That his heroes were critters who spoke and had feelings, just like the humans around them, somehow seemed the most commonsense thing in the world, a natural extension of that lyrical decency.
Hollywood, of course, has already had its way with Stuart Little, turning him into the  mighty mouse of his own pow-zap universe, and there was every reason to assume that the new animatronic Charlotte's Web  might receive the same brash, born-to-merchandise treatment. It's indeed a bit noisy, with a soundtrack that lays on the poky good cheer, and the animals in the barn rib each other a tad frenetically with their multiethnic celebrity voices. Once the story settles in, though, a little miracle occurs: The director, Gary Winick (13 Going on 30 ), puts the book, in all its glorious tall-tale reverence, right up on screen.
What hooks you from the start is Dakota Fanning's unfussy passion as Fern, the young farm girl who rescues Wilbur the spring pig  the runt of the litter  from the ax blade and then deposits him in her uncle's barn. Before long, those chatty showbiz barnyard voices (Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer as Gussy and Golly, the feisty goose and gander; John Cleese as Samuel, the snob of a sheep; Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire as Bitsy and Betsy, the haughty cows; and Robert Redford  himself!  as Ike, the scaredy-cat horse) have coalesced into an organic political community. It's Animal Farm  with better jokes.
That said, I was hardly prepared for the velvet tenderness, the slightly doleful maternal perfection of Julia Roberts as Charlotte, the friendly spider who comes up with a plan to save Wilbur from being turned into bacon the following spring. She begins to spin words in her web, commencing with ''Some Pig,'' an almost Zen declaration of Wilbur's worth. In a funny way, Charlotte's Web  winks at the power of  advertising: As that message-board web draws people from all over the county, they don't merely marvel at the existence of the words  they absorb the phrase's meaning, agreeing that Wilbur, who hasn't changed, must indeed be some pig.
The thing is  and this is what will leave you a wreck by the end  he really is  some pig. Not because he's at all special, but because he's good old ordinary Wilbur, perfect and magical in himself, as is everyone else. Charlotte's Web , because of the sweet-souled humor and care with which it has been adapted, brings to the screen a vision of the world that, in its happy nod to the grace that's in all of us, is religious in the deepest sense. It's a movie that might just inspire E.B. White, up in literary heaven, to wipe away a tear of gratitude.

 Correction Appended  “It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both.” So ends “Charlotte’s Web,” by E. B. White, not only one of the most beloved children’s books, but as close to perfect as any book I can think of. The arrival of a new movie version — to update the junky-looking but serviceable cartoon musical from 1973, with a voice cast that included Debbie Reynolds and Paul Lynde — is cause for anxiety as well as eagerness. On the one hand, it’s hard to ruin such fine material. On the other hand, even the smallest misjudgment might feel like a desecration. And what combination of digital imagery and traditional camera work could match the eloquence of Garth Williams’s pen-and-ink illustrations?  But these apprehensions are no reason to blame filmmakers for trying, or to withhold praise when they succeed. Gary Winick’s film, from a script credited to Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick, may not be perfect, but it honors its source and captures the key elements — the humor and good sense, as well as the sheer narrative exuberance — that have made White’s book a classic.  The rural setting of the book, first published in 1952, suggests a homespun, small-town simplicity, which Mr. Winick evokes with shots of clapboard farmhouses and downtown brick storefronts. No era is specified, but the clothes, cars and kitchen appliances have a vintage look. This nostalgic tableau of county fairs and wood-sided pickup trucks is not, however, the only element in White’s fictional world. Much as he cherished the bucolic quiet of Brooklin, Me., he possessed a thoroughly modern, Manhattanite sensibility. He was a country mouse only by the standards of The New Yorker.  And “Charlotte’s Web” is a sneakily sophisticated fable. White certainly appreciated the joys of life on the farm (while evading some of its bloodier aspects), but the book is really about the benevolent, even miraculous power of celebrity. It is, most simply, the story of a spider, Charlotte A. Cavitica, who saves the life of a pig named Wilbur by making him famous. She is a gifted writer whose chosen genre is what we might now call the pull quote  — her oeuvre consists of the words “terrific,” “radiant,” “some pig” and, in a stroke of public relations genius, “humble,” all emblazoned in webbing for the world to see. Charlotte is a self-effacing manufacturer of celebrity. An eight-legged flack. It’s not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good publicist.  It is perhaps fitting, then, that in the movie, Wilbur (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) should hang out in a V.I.P. barn, inhabited by the likes of John Cleese (as a sheep), Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer (as geese) and Robert Redford (as a horse). Charlotte’s lines are spoken by the biggest star of all, Julia Roberts, whose voice is as precise and melodious as a well-tuned piano. (She’s much better here than she was in “The Ant Bully,” by the way. I never really bought her as a social insect.) Ms. Roberts clearly understands that what makes Charlotte such an unforgettable character is not only her generosity, but also an intellectual rigor that stops just short of pedantry and a slightly starchy sense of her own dignity. In Wilbur’s eyes, she is the ideal grown-up: a mentor, teacher and protector whose love has no stickiness or strings attached.    The physical form of the spider — and also of her foil, Templeton the rat (Steve Buscemi) — is rendered in realistic, unflashy computer animation, which blends seamlessly with the live-action people and animals. Dakota Fanning, on the verge of outgrowing such roles, is Fern, who rescues Wilbur, the runt of the litter, from her father’s ax. When the little pig grows too big to be a house pet, he moves to the farm run by Fern’s uncle (Gary Basaraba) and aunt (Siobhan Fallon), who provide some human comic relief. A pair of crows (Thomas Haden Church  and André Benjamin) are on hand for vaudevillian banter and a few chase scenes involving Templeton.  Mr. Winick, who previously directed “Tadpole” and “13 Going on 30,” captures the various moods of White’s clear, sprightly prose: the wry, sometimes uproarious humor, the keenly observed characters, and the unapologetic and entirely appropriate moments of high sentiment. Like the book, the film is grounded in the rhythms of the natural world, observing the progress of the seasons and, in its understated and tremendously moving conclusion, illuminating the cycle of life, death and reproduction that governs any good story. The only serious flaw in “Charlotte’s Web” is that Danny Elfman’s musical score, which is perfectly adequate if not terribly imaginative, plays under the action loudly and virtually without interruption, robbing the picture of a sense of rustic tranquillity that would ground its antic flights.  But otherwise the movie is a delight: never coarse, rarely preachy and less concerned with proving its own cleverness than with paying tribute to the wisdom of White’s book. I am tempted to plagiarize the immortal words of its heroine: “Charlotte’s Web” is humble, and also terrific.  “Charlotte’s Web” is rated G.

E.B. White's book is "Charlotte's Web" the classic; Paramount and Walden Media's film is "Charlotte's Web" the commodity. A sorely disappointing screen adaptation of one of the most artful and widely read children's books of the past century, this highly polished picture is superficially faithful, even reverential to its source, but evinces neither imagination nor a personality of its own. Given the property, big-name cast and film's inoffensive nature, however, it would be  hard for this pic to miss commercially with general audiences over the holidays.
Revered since its 1952 publication for its inventive narrative about a brainy spider's intervention to save the life of a runty barnyard pig, White's tale holds such a special place in the hearts of many children and parents because of the way it so gently but resonantly introduces youngsters to the natural cycles of life, from birth to death. That it's literate and droll in the bargain is icing on the cake.
The thesps and production values of this second bigscreen version (Hanna-Barbera made an animated musical in 1973) can scarcely be faulted. Surely Dakota Fanning would be anyone's first choice to play Fern, the plucky girl who convinces her father not to destroy the spring litter's odd pig out. And you couldn't really do better than Julia Roberts voicing Charlotte, Steve Buscemi as Templeton the selfish rat, Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer as chatty geese, Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire as down-home cows, Andre Benjamin and Thomas Haden Church as aggressive crows and, lo and behold, Robert Redford as a horse and John Cleese as a sheep.
But virtually from the outset, it's clear something is amiss. The dialogue issues forth with no variation of pace. The comedy is never set up by pauses or distractions, resulting in very few laughs. The camera always moves in or pulls back to accentuate precisely the emotional point being made, and the cuts and music cues inevitably come exactly when you think they will.
Nowhere to be found is any dramatic surprise, heightening of the pulse or genuine pulling of heartstrings. Gary Winick's direction consists of button pushing, and the mechanics are palpable at every step. As spring passes into summer and summer into autumn, the leaves change color, but the film develops no rhythm of its own, no feel for the land or the animals. Even though the majority of the critters are real, with mouth movements added, they may as well have been computer animated for all the naturalness and life they convey (they also tend to fall over sideways a good deal when startled).
Once Charlotte, from her web above the barn door, promises the little porker Wilbur that she'll save him from a smokehouse fate, Fanning has little to do, making this perf one of the least interesting in her prodigiously precocious career. As the spider continues to spin laudatory words about the pig into her web to the amazement of the locals, the general notion develops that Wilbur is, indeed, "some pig," but mostly one reflects upon how much better "Babe" did this sort of thing 11 years ago.
With verdant rural areas of Victoria, Australia, standing in for Somerset County, Maine, pic boasts an appealing timeless quality; cars and clothes are of mid-century vintage, and modern technology rears not its head onscreen, only in the way the film was made.

Breathe easy: Gary Winick 's new, live-action Charlotte's Web  pic does not screw up one of the seminal works of American children's literature. In fact, the film manages to modernize this classic tale without losing the gravity and essential dignity of animals grappling with mortality. Winick skillfully undercuts the seriousness of the subject matter (Wilbur, the porcine protagonist, is essentially on death row for the entirety of the film) with contemporary sarcasm and a liberal dose of potty humor. While Dakota Fanning  does well by Fern, the film's pig-loving heroine, John Cleese , with his clipped British delivery, is the real scene-stealer as elitist sheep Samuel. The only true weak spot in this basically charming adaptation is Wilbur, with Dominic Scott Kay 's high-pitched, overly precocious whine more saccharine than sweet. Still, with such stellar source material, this Charlotte's Web  won't disgrace your childhood memoriesor your child.
