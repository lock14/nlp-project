If you�ve seen the outstanding 2002 documentary Spellbound
, you will perhaps recall Ashley White, the young spelling-bee contestant from the D.C. projects who cobbled together her training from word games and help from encouraging teachers, while the more privileged spellers enjoyed clubs, formal coaching, and other institutional advantages. In the film, Ashley says her life is like a movie: She struggles and she overcomes. Akeelah and the Bee
 is that movie, dramatized. It is, in most ways, a conventional Hollywood sports film, an against-the-odds story about an intellectual athlete, her coach, and her challenges with a big third-act showdown and an uplifting message. It is significant that the film�s distributor, Lionsgate, is strategically partnered with Starbucks Entertainment, which is using its coffee empire to promote the movie. Adult audiences have cause for cynicism, and the movie is so conventional that it might fade rapidly from a grown-up�s memory. Just the same, Akeelah
 is an excellent choice for tweenage audiences: Thoughtful, engaging, and with cross-gender appeal, it takes the problems of urban family life and education seriously and makes no villains of its characters. Even the local gangbanger (Eddie Steeples) � the one who�s drawing Akeelah�s brother into a life of crime � supports Akeelah�s quest to win the National Spelling Bee and fondly recalls how a teacher encouraged his grade-school forays into poetry composition. One of the film�s producers, Nancy Hult, is a former math teacher at an inner-city school, and the movie is chock-a-block with instructional design: Akeelah is a kinesthetic learner who spells by tapping her leg rhythmically and skipping rope, and she�s bored by the drill-and-kill routine of overcrowded Crenshaw Middle School, where the teachers want to help their gifted students but don�t even have money for books. So Akeelah gets a tutor, Dr. Joshua Larabee (Fishburne), who gives her project-based tasks (she learns to spell words from the speeches of W.E.B. Dubois and Martin Luther King). Larabee also has a tortured backstory that�s handled inelegantly by writer-director Atchison, who has one low-budget feature (1999�s The Pornographer
) and a short under his belt. Atchison�s dramatic hand is simply too heavy at times. However, his ensemble is wonderful, and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah�s maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort. Akeelah is gifted but not cocky, and it�s hard for her to stick out and be different from her peers. She is a heroine who clearly resonates with young kids; the audience at my screening adored her and burst into applause when she spelled �pastiche.� These viewers are likely to forgive the film its shortcomings. A twist in the third act seems like a narrative cop-out, but it�s really a hallmark of how Atchison�s story actively tries to deconstruct the �competition� paradigm of learning and suggest a community-based, cooperative model of group success. Akeelah
 has lofty goals, and though it doesn�t always achieve them, it is a rewarding tale for public educators, parents, and kids with big dreams.


Help! Our public schools are in crisis. Delinquency, dropouts, plummeting test scores. Even worse, some children are harassed for wanting to broaden their worldviews and fatten their vocabularies. Who will show them that learning is OK -- and show them with flair?
Hollywood has a solution: Akeelah Anderson, the unsinkable 11-year-old title character whom Keke Palmer plays with star-making gusto in ''Akeelah and the Bee."
Akeelah lives in Los Angeles's all-purpose tough Crenshaw neighborhood, and her story is the rare feel-good fantasy with its feet on the ground. She doesn't want to sing, rap, dance, run, or dunk. She wants to spell, which adults in most socioeconomic brackets can confidently encourage a kid to do.
She rises from her under-funded, underperforming school all the way to the National Spelling Bee. And her success is catchy. By the time it's all over, even one of her former bullies wants to spit letters.
It's unlikely she'll do it with Akeelah's style. No one in the history of the movies, and in no National Spelling Bee I've seen, has spelled words with her conviction and defiance. She looks straight ahead, her head weaving side to side as the letters blast out of her mouth. She's not just spelling. She's telling you off.
Akeelah has a loving but overworked mother (Angela Bassett) who can't tolerate her daughter's passion for the bee. The woman has a hospital job to stress over, a dead husband to mourn, a soldier son to worry about, a grandbaby to dote on, and a teenage son to keep from the grubby maw of gangbanging. Poor Akeelah is a rose her mother hasn't time to smell.
Fortunately, the girl's extremely supportive principal (Curtis Armstrong) believes she can make it all the way to the national bee and hooks her up with an English professor who once was a spelling prodigy himself. His name is Dr. Joshua Larabee (tee-hee), he's played by a feeling Laurence Fishburne, who's at his haughtiest and holiest and, after a few scenes, bellowing best.
Akeelah and Dr. Larabee have a rocky start. He doesn't like her bad grammar. She doesn't like what a snob he is.
She's too polite to say so, but she might also hate that she's the Ralph Macchio in this relationship. The good doctor does more gardening than Mr. Miyagi in all the ''Karate Kid" movies combined. In any case, before Larabee can say, ''Wax on," she's devouring words, much to his delight.
But melodrama is in the offing. Akeelah's family doesn't have a monopoly on the blues. Dr. Larabee has lost a little girl, and being in the presence of such a bright kid makes him wistful. Yes, the daughter with no father and the father with no daughter fill each other's voids.
Doug Atchison wrote and directed the movie, which is a triumph of cliche-wrangling, stereotypes, and shrewd packaging (Starbucks
 is a co-producer and is promoting the movie in every shop). South Los Angeles -- that's South Central to you -- is Hollywood's go-to other side of the tracks. Everybody knows its streets are mean; they saw ''Boyz N the Hood," which happened to star Bassett and Fishburne, who in their three scenes together here still have an intense, sensual crackle.
Bassett's character is the classic commotion-causing black mom. And Akeelah's rival is a pompous 14-year-old Chinese-American kid (Sean Michael), who's a foolproof dramatic foil. He goes to a much nicer school. But in his stern, racist, slave-driving dad, he has a meaner parent, who has programmed his boy to take down the little black girl. The entire picture seems rigged to make you stand up and cheer.
All the gears, in fact, are shamelessly visible, yet they lock smoothly and resonantly into place. If ''Akeelah and the Bee" is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child.
Akeelah doesn't really want or need the attention her spelling brings her. She hides her brilliance in slang and posing. As a lot of smart black kids can tell you, that's a survival skill. Knowing too much out loud can get your keister kicked.
The movie nails the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment. Akeelah skips a lot of her classes because the curriculum is unchallenging. But her friendship with Javier (J.R. Villarreal), a charismatic fellow speller whose family is much better off, exposes her to nicer neighborhoods and his more academically rigorous school. In one touching scene, Akeelah shows up with her best friend, Kiana (Erica Hubbard), at Javier's house for a party. Kiana is so perplexed by the rainbow of happy, frolicking kids that she can't even bring herself to get out of the car.
Alas, the film is full of black children, like Kiana, whose self-esteem is eaten away by defeatism and a cancerous inferiority complex that seems to pervade the entire community. But in a moment that, due to its uplifting preposterousness, amounts to an act of magical realism, Akeelah's entire neighborhood helps her study for the bee -- from her mother and her mailman to the local gangsta!
Later in the movie, that device is repeated, producing one of the happiest feelings I can remember having in a theater. Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's just the kind of propaganda our children need.


         "Akeelah and the Bee" is a genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational family film that features a charming young actress in the title role. It's a successful feel-good movie, but it would make you feel even better if it didn't push quite so hard for its desired effects.
 
  As the title indicates, "Akeelah" is yet another film — following Jeff Blitz's marvelous documentary "Spellbound" and the underrated drama "Bee Season" — to find high emotion in the unlikely world of competitive spelling bees for middle school kids.
 


         






    The twist is that in this case the institution is the academically challenged Crenshaw Middle School in South Los Angeles. And the story that writer-director Doug Atchison wants to tell involves not only spelling but also achievement, empowerment and neighborhood pride.
 
  Because few films want to tell these kinds of stories about that part of the city, "Akeelah" has attracted high-powered talent. Together for the first time since "What's Love Got to Do With It" are Angela Bassett, who plays Akeelah's mother, and Laurence Fishburne as the coach who mentors her. Though they don't have many scenes together, their presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity.
 
  Holding her own with them is 11-year-old Keke Palmer as Akeelah. Already the recipient of a Screen Actors Guild best leading actress nomination for the TV film "The Wool Cap," Palmer provides the spirit and intelligence this feature could not exist without. She makes Akeelah, an old soul in her kid's version of granny glasses, someone whose every mood change — and there are many — we pay close attention to.
 
  Despite all these good things, "Akeelah" is encumbered by Atchison's determination to cross every emotional T and dot every narrative I. If Starbucks Entertainment is trumpeting its involvement in this film with ads insisting, "We're Thinking Outside the Bean," the film's difficulty is that it doesn't. It sets up obstacles we know will disappear and telegraphs its plot elements well before they happen. This is no more than par for the course with films of this type, but because of the caliber of the cast and the sincerity of the message, one wishes it could be otherwise.
 
  Practically the first time we meet Akeelah, she is contemptuously tossing away a flier advertising her school's spelling bee. Unwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac, she prefers to keep her gift for spelling (courtesy of her late father, a bear for Scrabble) a secret from the world.
 
  As far as her mother, Tanya (Bassett), is concerned, that's just as well. With one young daughter already a mother and one son flirting with being a gangbanger (though another son is doing well in the Air Force), Tanya just doesn't want to be bothered with what she views as the foolishness of spelling competitions.
 
  Much more interested is the somber Dr. Larabee (Fishburne), a man of self-described "acerbic wit and sour disposition" who is on sabbatical from his position as chairman of the UCLA English department and so has a lot of time on his hands.
 
  A stern type who actually says "I'll brook no nonsense" with a straight face, the good doctor and Akeelah are not exactly each other's type. He views her as insolent; she sees no reason to be interested in the broader cultural education he wants her to master in addition to spelling.
 
  Her brainiac qualms notwithstanding, Akeelah enters the world of bees (there wouldn't be a film if she didn't), and soon enough she meets two key peers. Javier (J.R. Villarreal) is a gregarious Latino with supportive parents, while the robotic Dylan (Sean Michael Afable) is a humorless Asian American spelling machine with Darth Vader for a father.
 
  It wouldn't be fair to detail all the ups and downs of Akeelah's relationships with these kids and with Dr. Larabee, ever the sad-eyed voice of doom, who tells her that he's seen spelling bees "chew kids up and spit them out." Whatever happened to "Have a nice day"?
 
  While its undeniable earnestness leaves "Akeelah and the Bee" open to good-natured teasing, in its own way it raises important points about the nature of education, the importance of community and obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face.
 
  It's a message to which movies don't pay nearly enough attention.

An inspirational spelling bee movie, with a buoyant up-from-the-hood agenda? Akeelah and the Bee  may spell it out for you, but it pulls few punches in its depiction of the hurdles a verbally gifted South Central L.A. 11-year-old (Keke Palmer) must clear to compete in a field dominated by wealthier white and Asian superachievers. Blessed with excellent turns by Angela Bassett (as Akeelah's wary mother) and Laurence Fishburne (her flinty mentor), this feel-gooder revels in its hip-to-be-square hyperliteracy, and neatly exceeds its own PSA-ness, practically amounting to a black, preteen Good Will Hunting .

 Between the 2002 documentary "Spellbound" and the recent screen adaptation of the novel "Bee Season," the spelling-bee film is fast becoming a genre unto itself. In this inner-city version,  11-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated African-American girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. But she refuses to participate in the school spelling bee until the principal (Curtis Armstrong) threatens her with detention. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's overworked single mother, Tanya (Angela Bassett), objects to her daughter's obsession with what she regards as a game. If Akeelah is to pursue her dream of going to the national bee in Washington, it will have to be behind her mother's back.  The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is in essence a formulaic sports picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. Ms. Bassett and Mr. Fishburne, who were electrifying as Tina and Ike Turner in the biopic "What's Love Got to Do With It?," have too few scenes together to develop a real rapport, but Mr. Fishburne and the young Ms. Palmer match wits with a satisfying crackle.  "Akeelah and the Bee" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some strong language, but has no sex or violence. It should be appropriate for most children.

That seemingly inexhaustible new movie subgenre, the spelling bee drama, receives its most conventionally uplifting treatment yet in "Akeelah and the Bee." Framed around the relationship between an underdog word whiz and her tough-lovin' coach, this earnest weepie plays like "The Karate Kid" with a pro-literacy agenda, pushing all the right emotional buttons yet hitting quite a few wrong ones in the process. Overly calculated yet undeniably potent crowd-pleasing elements should spell moderate but sustained returns, especially in urban markets, when Lionsgate releases the pic April 28 with 2929 Prods. and first-time distrib Starbucks Entertainment.
Directed by Doug Atchison from his Nicholl Fellowship-winning screenplay, pic reps the latest entry in a cinematic tradition that includes the riveting 2003 documentary "Spellbound" and last year's chilly psychological drama "Bee Season" (and could even be expanded to include legit hit "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee").
"Akeelah and the Bee" is broader and has shallower ambitions, treating the national spelling bee phenomenon as a democratizing force -- a vehicle for self-redemption, social change and three-hankie inspirational melodrama.
Winningly played by Keke Palmer ("The Wool Cap"), 11-year-old Akeelah Anderson is a gifted but undermotivated student at a predominantly black middle school in South Los Angeles' Crenshaw district. Akeelah's desire to blend in can't hide her preternatural spelling abilities from her teacher (Dalia Phillips) or principal (Curtis Armstrong), who encourage her to enter the school bee and then push her into the regional competition, with the slim hope that she might go all the way to the nationals in Washington.
Initially afraid of either failing or looking like a brainiac, Akeelah throws herself into her studies but soon encounters her fair share of obstacles. Her widowed mother (the ever-reliable Angela Bassett) is cranky, distracted and skeptical of her daughter's newfound passion. Akeelah's also intimidated by her regional competitors from well-to-do families.
Enter the gruff Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), a professor and former spelling champ whose last name can hardly be a coincidence. Played with testy, no-nonsense magnetism and a slight paunch by Fishburne (who also produced), Larabee dismisses Akeelah at first, but her persistence and dedication ultimately win him over.
Duo's prickly interactions, which gradually thaw into mutual respect and surrogate father-daughter affection, form the bittersweet core of the movie. Still, pic would have done well not to saddle Larabee with a painful family history that all too conveniently mirrors Akeelah's own.
The script overall betrays a weakness for emotional simplification and would feel a lot less manipulative if, like "Spellbound," it were genuinely interested in the art and mechanics of spelling. But aside from a few well-played scenes of Akeelah and Larabee studying obscure etymologies and developing mnemonic devices, pic focuses its highly optimistic gaze on the bee's community-uniting impact, as Akeelah becomes a local celebrity.
Outside that community, Akeelah nurses a cute prepubescent romance with rival Javier (J.R. Villarreal) while fending off snide remarks from sullen super-prodigy Dylan Chiu (Sean Michael Afable). Dylan's authoritarian dad (Tzi Ma) is arguably pic's most questionable creation, a stiff Asian stereotype whose dialogue (he calls Akeelah a "silly black girl") wouldn't seem out of place in Lionsgate's similarly heavy-handed L.A. story "Crash."
Pic's big D.C. finale, though overlong, delivers emotional sweep and high-stakes drama (plus a few lessons about good sportsmanship, natch). Atchison reveals himself to be something of a showman here, and while the ending is never really in doubt, he wrings an impressive level of suspense from the proceedings that makes one wish the story's other emotional high points were more honestly earned.
Going furthest to sell the material is Palmer, whose spunky, cute-as-a-button Akeelah is all but impossible to root against. Thesp movingly illuminates the pressures facing a girl caught between the ordinary and the extraordinary.
Well-lensed in and around Los Angeles by M. David Mullen, with some occasional if conspicuous handheld camerawork, this is one of the rare films featuring scenes shot at USC that are actually intended to represent USC. Aaron Zigman's musical score offers conventional but relatively discreet support.
Final credits were not yet available when print screened.

Thankfully, nowhere in the credits for this moviea small gem, at least within the subgenre of spelling-bee picturescan the dreaded phrase "based on a true story" be found. Without any historical source to fall back on writer-director Doug Atchison  fills the vacuum at the heart of the feel-good template he's working from with recognizably human emotions. To be fair, Akeelah and the Bee  often settles for the predictable: the humorless Asian American nemesis, domineering fathers straight out of Dostoyevsky, and an inevitable third-act montage of flash-card drills. Yet beneath its sentimental exterior, this film is Foucauldian enough to take seriously the idea that knowledge is power. As Akeelah discovers her inner Caliban, coached by stern UCLA  prof Laurence Fishburne , she becomes alienated from her South Central friends and high school graduate mom (the always sturdy Angela Bassett ). It helps that newcomer Keke Palmer  nails it as the 11-year-old prodigy, avoiding cuteness and conveying more angst than all the pasty freaks in Spellbound  combined. When she stands up to Fishburne"dictatorial, truculent, supercilious"she's totally convincing as someone who relishes words, which is more than you can say for many of her Tinseltown peers.
