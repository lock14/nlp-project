No spoilers here, but first things first: Zombieland
 (which had its world premiere during Fantastic Fest) has the single most outrageously entertaining and unexpected celebrity cameo of any
 film � genre or otherwise � this filmgoer has seen in a long, long time. It's not a sequence that makes or breaks the film, but it does
 tip Zombieland
 over the edge of zom-com ordinariness (and if you don't believe there is such at thing, I urge you to go check out all the straight-to-DVD zomedies taking up valuable shelf space at your local indie video outlet) into something considerably weirder and therefore more fun. It's not Shaun of the Dead
 by a long shot, but by the same token neither is it, thankfully, George A. Romero's Survival of the Dead
 (which had a less-than-impressive screening at Fantastic Fest, among other fall festivals). Debuting director Fleischer's action-and-innards-drenched film dials it all up to 11 from the opening credits sequence � which, like Zack Snyder's underrated remake of Dawn of the Dead
, uses pop-music-backed mayhem to smart expository and staggeringly kickass effect � and only slows down for a breather for the length of the aforementioned cameo. Storywise, there's precious little going on here that we haven't seen before, but Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick's archly hip and often downright hilarious script, combined with a quartet of seamless performances and enough cranial destruction to sate even the most diehard Fangoria
 reader, makes for one hell of a wild ride. It begins, as do all good dead things, in Texas, where former UT Austin student Columbus (Eisenberg), who narrates, fills in the plot's backstory � virus, zombies, apocalypse, and Rules to Live By � before hooking up with the whiskey-slugging, Escalade-driving Tallahassee (Harrelson, clearly enjoying every breath his anarchic character takes). Columbus is searching for his family, Tallahassee is searching for a Hostess Twinkie (don't ask), but what they find are two other zombieland survivors: leggy Wichita (Stone) and her tweener companion Little Rock (Breslin). In a nod toward Romero's direction, the living have way more issues than the dead (or undead or infected), but Zombieland
 is dead set against being dead serious. Its tonal pallor has more in common with a foreshortened It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World
 than with 28 Days
 or Weeks Later
, and then, again, there's that jaw-dropping cameo. It'll kill ya.

Sometime in the last 20 years zombie slapstick became a primary genre of the movies, right up there with action, teen musicals, and bad Jennifer Aniston romances. It carries expectations, it observes rules, and, as with Oscar-bait period dramas, the Brits have a tendency to do it better. At least they did with “Shaun of the Dead’’ in 2004.
With the smart, gross, extremely funny “Zombieland,’’ the Americans successfully fire back. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and directed by first-timer Ruben Fleischer, the movie makes no claims to greatness and may even enrage zombie-movie purists, since the undead dispense with the classic Romero stagger here and sprint at top speed toward their victims. What “Zombieland’’ has instead  - in spades  - is deliciously weary end-of-the-world banter.
And rules. Lots of rules. Our narrator is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), an obsessive-compulsive adolescent geekboy and one of the few survivors of a plague that has turned humanity into a mass of flesh-eating cannibals within a matter of months. Columbus  - all the characters are named for the cities they’ve come from or are going to, as if the plague had wiped identity clean, too  - lives by simple rules that pop helpfully onto the screen as required: #2  - Double tap: Two shots to the head will make sure they’re dead; #4  - Always wear seat belts.
“Zombieland’’ reintroduces Columbus to the company of men and runs alongside as he decides whether to break rule #17  - Don’t be a hero. His first companion is Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus’s opposite in swagger and style. Where the kid’s first impulse is to run, Tallahassee prefers aggro-confrontation (although he does confess to having cried at “Titanic’’). They’re a nicely matched pair: Id and Superego with double-barrelled shotguns.
Along the way toward no place in particular, the two pick up a hard-nosed sister act. Wichita is played by Emma Stone, the husky-voiced love object of “Superbad,’’ and Little Rock is none other than Little Miss Sunshine herself, Abigail Breslin. At 13, Breslin has been trying to broaden her resume with clanky weepers like the recent “My Sister’s Keeper.’’ I hate to break it to her mom, but the young actress seems much happier fighting off monsters intent on eating her liver.
The script cooks up a destination  - supposedly there’s a zombie-free area in Los Angeles, although that sounds like an oxymoron to me  - but “Zombieland’’ is more interested in playing its four characters off each other. The tart performances and explosively funny dialogue are what make the movie; that, and the matter-of-factness with which the heroes deal with apocalypse now. Faced with a devastated America from which civilization has been violently wrenched (although it’s implied it didn’t take too much wrenching), Tallahassee searches high and low for a Hostess Twinkie, a pristine reminder of prepackaged consumer Eden before the fall.
“Zombieland’’ doesn’t break out in a chorus of “Where Have All the Twinkies Gone?,’’ but it finds other outlets for its sardonic playfulness. The movie’s high point comes when the heroes get to Los Angeles and encounter a Beloved Hollywood Star, playing himself. I beg you, do all you can to avoid knowing the identity of this man beforehand  - that includes steering clear of the film’s IMDb page and putting your fingers in your ears and saying “la la la la’’ when friends talk about the movie. The joke, and it’s perfect, is in the rightness of this star in this setting, and how his long-established attitude dovetails so precisely with the film’s.
Shortly thereafter “Zombieland’’ starts to lose steam when it should be roaring to a climax; the dialogue thins out and the action rolls amiably to a stop in time for the end credits. Surprisingly, the movie just isn’t very scary. Icky, yes: Fleischer and his effects crew earn their R rating with some exquisitely disgusting close-ups of zombies dining al fresco and/or meeting their maker. But we hardly ever feel the four main characters are in serious jeopardy, and if you don’t have that, you don’t have suspense.
As they say in “Buckaroo Banzai,’’ though: “So vhat? Beeg deal.’’ “Zombieland’’ makes up in laughter what it lacks in screams, and the arch weariness with which it looks out at undead America hides a frisky yet disturbing message: We’re closer than we think.

Zombie are blessed with a name that begins with one of the funniest letters of the alphabet. As a result, these legendary flesh eaters are particularly versatile, capable of stirring feelings of horror (as in Night of the Living Dead ) and hilarity (as in the recent literary mash-up Pride and Prejudice and   Zombies ). Zombieland  takes full advantage of both possibilities of the species as well as the current boom in zombiephilia. The ghouls who, after an out-of-control virus hits planet Earth, have overrun the world in this smartly made, chat-loving comedy are plenty hideous, prone to feasting on intestines. But they're mostly fake-blood-splattered interlopers, dispatched with Shaun of the Dead  sangfroid. At the bone, Zombieland  is a polished, very funny road picture shaped by wisenheimer cable-TV sensibilities and starring four likable actors, each with an influential following.
Actually, each courts a strip of America, too, since the characters  survivors who understandably approach one another with suspicion before joining forces (maybe they've seen   28 Days Later ?)  are known only by geographic handles. Adventureland 's Jesse Eisenberg, a matinee idol for girls who love adorably neurotic guy-in-hoodie types, is called Columbus, because he's trying to get home to his mom and dad in Ohio without being eaten. Columbus narrates, providing the audience with a running list of rules (helpfully printed on the screen) by which he manages to stay alive. Woody Harrelson is Tallahassee, a mad-eyed daredevil filled with zombie hatred, whose most pronounced quirk is an obsessive quest to stock up on Twinkies as road food. (Sure, Twinkies are funny by definition, but the postapocalyptic-foodstuff joke was handled more succinctly in WALL·E .) Superbad 's Emma Stone, deliciously punk-sexy in smoky eye shadow, is called Wichita, while a feisty Abigail Breslin plays Wichita's kid sister, Little Rock, a 13-year-old who's young enough to love roller coasters yet old enough to handle a firearm. One additional benefit of a postzombie landscape is that, with   no other human drivers on the road, Little Rock can shoulder her share   of time behind the wheel.
So where does this quartet of charmers head? Why, west to Southern   California, of course! It's a destination that's rumored, against all ha-ha cultural stereotypes, to be a zombie-free zone. (Unspoken joke: How can you distinguish the living dead from movie stars?) Besides, Little Rock has   an itch to see a particular SoCal amusement park, and the itinerary leaves time for the foursome to tour the celebrity homes of Beverly Hills. Ravenous hordes won't get me to say anything about the cameo player who makes an appearance in the film except this: Bloody great! Also this: There's an excellent joke at Russell Crowe's expense.
Zombieland , which feasts on snarky banter and self-referential pop cultural allusions   (including shout-outs to Facebook and various movies handpicked for maximum audience appreciation), was written by young talents Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, script partners who have clocked time creating and writing shows for Spike and MTV. The   debut feature director is Ruben Fleischer. As a result, I'm guessing that seasoned producer Gavin Polone, whose credits include Gilmore Girls  and Curb Your Enthusiasm , is equally important in balancing this entertainment equation. Reese, Wernick, and Fleischer   are occasionally in danger of wandering   off into flights of indie-narrative cuteness   (Columbus' rules of survival begin to lose their freshness midway through the story). I'll wager it's Polone who kept the picture focused on the four central characters and their   own journey from zombies—i.e., lone souls wandering the earth—to humans who bond with one another because, frankly, nobody else has even got a heartbeat.


 Chomp chomp, spew spew go the zippy ghouls in “Zombieland,” a minor diversion dripping in splatter and groaning with self-amusement. Like most zombie flicks, this addition to an already overstuffed, undernourished subgenre more or less follows the gore-slicked path charted by George A. Romero in his sanguinary 1968 masterwork, “Night of the Living Dead”: the undead chase after the semi-alive. Carnage ensues. But whereas Mr. Romero always has politics on his mind, the filmmakers here — Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick wrote and Ruben Fleischer directed — are strictly in it to bust guts (and heads).  Although Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone and a modestly funny Bill Murray breeze through, they’re just icing. The real point and, depending on your blood lust, the pleasure of “Zombieland” is its appetite for destruction. Despite its throwaway jokes, a hint of romance and various ridiculous bits of business, some involving Twinkies, the movie is strictly a compendium of all the ways to off zombies, which can be downed with guns, of course, as well as baseball bats, gardening tools, a toilet-bowl lid, even a piano. Sometimes the gonzo antics work, though the piles of bodies at the end did make me flash on the Nazi extermination camps, which, you know, really killed the joke, too.  “Zombieland” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Guts galore.

By now there have been quite enough zombie comedies to constitute a little subgenre of their own. If "Zombieland" doesn't grade at the head of its class -- the valedictorian still being "Shaun of the Dead" -- this lively splatstick item is nonetheless way above the remedial likes of "Zombie Strippers," to name one among many recent lower-budgeters. Benefiting from the very different but very appealing comedy styles of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg even when the script's wit runs thin, this should be catnip to jaded genre fans, with decent niche theatrical returns and solid long-term ancillary biz signaled.
Opening is brash but crass, with a nebbishly young loner (Eisenberg, "Adventureland," "The Squid and the Whale") detailing his list of survival strategies in a post-human world turned ravenously undead by a virus. Those bits of advice (some as simple as buckling up) are rather too cutely utilized as onscreen text, comically illustrated during the gory opening credits. 
We also soon get a flashback to the protag's own first experience with zombiedom, when a hot neighbor (Amber Heard) in distress invaded his agoraphobic virginal privacy, kindling romantic hopes until she tried to eat his flesh the morning after.
After a subsequent altercation leaves him sans vehicle, the kid gets picked up by Tallahassee (Harrelson), who dubs him Columbus, since that's where he's theoretically headed (hoping his parents are still alive in Ohio). Tallahassee prefers to go by place names, because real ones get you too emotionally attached. 
Tallahassee is the fully liberated id to Columbus' over-cautious fraidy-cat, a cowboy road warrior who enjoys gratuitously stomping zombie arse. But both are hoodwinked when they run across two young sisters in apparent extremis, Wichita ("Superbad's" Emma Stone) and 12-year-old Little Rock (Abigail Breslin, edging into teenagerdom). 
At gunpoint, the girls alleviate the boys of their SUV and weapons, though the four soon form a reluctant alliance, with Columbus crushing on Wichita and Tallahassee taking a fatherly shine to Little Rock. As they head westward from their Texas starting point -- chasing rumors of a zombie-free theme park outside L.A. -- not a lot happens, really, though Ruben Fleischer's direction is slick and busy. Eventually, they get to Hollywood, grab a map of stars' homes, and settle in at the luxurious manse of Tallahassee's hero, Bill Murray (playing himself in an amusing extended cameo).
Screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (of Spike TV series' "Invasion Iowa" and "The Joe Schmo Show") has scattered funny lines and situations. But too often the humor leans more yee-haw than clever. Luckily, the stars delight even when their lines don't: Eisenberg's often inspired neurotic dithering recalls the likes of early Gene Wilder, while Harrelson again proves himself an actor willing to go out on any limb (even dancing to the "Ghostbusters" theme) for goofy effect. Harrelson's unexpected line readings and reactions sometimes elevate "Zombieland" to a level of inspired nonsense worthy of "Shaun." 
Stone and Breslin are OK in straight roles. Design/tech packaging is excellent.

The zombie movie—that evergreen vessel for all manner of social and political allegory—gets stripped down to its "Holy shit! Zombies! Run!" chassis in this fitfully amusing romp directed with little ambition and even less distinction by first-timer Ruben Fleischer . Set in a not-too-distant future (Roland Emmerich 's apocalyptic 2012 , set for release in November, is on the marquee at Grauman's Chinese), in which most of mankind has gone flesh-eating crazy from a Mad Cow–style pandemic, Zombieland  follows the requisite hardy band of uninfected survivors as they, like the Griswolds before them, make their way to the promised land of a Southern California amusement park. Woody Harrelson  leads the charge as a leathery urban roughneck in the Snake Plissken mold, with Jesse Eisenberg  (typecast, yet again, as a virginal neurotic), Emma Stone , and Abigail Breslin  (the latter two playing a couple of scam-artist sisters) riding shotgun. Ho-hum zombie mayhem lurks around every bend, but the movie's comic tone becomes increasingly strained (as does Eisenberg's logorrheic voiceover), up to and including an indulgent movie-star cameo by a certain deadpan genius usually more discerning in his choice of projects. Who ya gonna call? How about John Carpenter ?
