         The faux play was the centerpiece of theatrical producers Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom's (Gene Wilder) scheme to make a bundle of money by intentionally staging a huge flop in Brooks' 1968 movie comedy, "The Producers." Much to their mortification, the play becomes a huge hit and they're sent to prison. The same premise was used for the 2001 Broadway musical starring Nathan Lane as Max and Matthew Broderick as Leo. The movie garnered Brooks a screenwriting Oscar while the musical won 12 Tonys and became a financial phenomenon.
 
  Now, Brooks, Lane and Broderick, along with director Susan Stroman, making her feature film debut, have brought "The Producers" back from the Great White Way in the form of a grand, old-school movie musical. But whereas the original film is gleefully crass and energetically paced, the movie musical, weighing in at a robust two-plus hours, is bloated and self-satisfied. Whatever spectacle the stage musical possessed to make it such a box-office behemoth fails to transfer to the screen and will likely be enjoyed mainly by those who hold fond memories of seeing it on Broadway.
 


         






    Lane and Broderick are solid as the impresario who specializes in duds and his gullible accountant, respectively, but sing and mug as they must, they can't hold a candle to Mostel and Wilder when it comes to the comedy. Ever the impudent pug, Lane wheedles where Mostel, with his great basset hound eyes, seduces. Broderick's broad, aw-shucks enthusiasm pales beside Wilder's sly impishness.
 
  Although the additions of Uma Thurman as "receptionist" Ulla Inga Hansen Benson Yonsen Tallen-Hallen Svaden Svanson and Will Ferrell as Franz Liebkind, the maniacal German playwright, add star power, they do little to make up for the fact that none of the other musical numbers is a match for the sheer brazenness and wonderful camp of the centerpiece performance of "Springtime for Hitler." Broadway holdovers Gary Beach (as Roger De Bris, the "worst director in New York") and Roger Bart (as Carmen Ghia, De Bris' assistant who wears a facial mole as an accessory) fare better, with Beach's role significantly pumped up from the 1968 film.
 
  The original movie — a culture-clash time warp of New York theater nostalgia and '60s grooviness (remember Dick Shawn as L.S.D.?) — holds up because it's sharp and biting. The new film is more stolidly set in 1959, though as in the stage show, the Village People seem to have replaced hippies as the out-of-place pop cultural touchstone.
 
  A five-time Tony winner for choreography and direction, Stroman doesn't attempt a frenetic stylization à la Rob Marshall (another choreographer turned director) with "Chicago" in 2002, nor does Brooks and collaborator Thomas Meehan's screenplay feel as smart and fresh as Bill Condon's treatment of that Kander-Ebb musical. Of course, not all attempts to make theatrical adaptations cinematic are successful — see Chris Columbus' recent swooning music video-like treatment of "Rent" — but something other than a staid keepsake of the stage event is preferable.
 
  As creaky as the traditional musicals it once poked fun at, "The Producers" has been entombed — lox, shtick and two smoking bagels — as a theatrical fossil, and reinforces the danger in returning to the same material one time too many.

Flop sweat from Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick? Impossible! Aren't these two the Laurel and Hardy, the Oscar and Felix, the Lewis and Clark of Broadway? Yet here they are in The Producers , re-creating the signature roles with which the pair first dazzled New York City almost five years ago in the award-laden musical, and I could swear the boys look damp with desperation. They strain, they bellow, they all but resort to spit takes for laughs. Is it my imagination, or can I see beads of anxious shvitzing on their cheeks as they go through the motions of their polished buddy act?
Tricky thing, the art of moving from one medium to another. In 2001, Mel Brooks adapted his own 1968 comedy classic (starring Zero Mostel of blessed memory and Gene Wilder) into a live song-and-dance circus, and now here's a movie of the musical of the movie that, like a game of telephone, doesn't convey any of Brooks' innate breezy mania. The broad busyness with which he and director Susan Stroman made the original transition from screen to stage looks positively garish now crammed back onto film. Gestures that were designed to play to an upper balcony jammed with tourists look overeager on the big screen, and despite the inclusion of a few new outdoor location shots, the ripped-from-the-stage aesthetic induces claustrophobia. Worst of all, stuff that's built for huge laughs and applause dies a thousand deaths when concluded in silence without the response of a live audience. A director at ease with the movie medium might have known how to overcome this. But the unceasingly inventive choreographer and stage maestra Stroman, so wizardly at putting on a really boffo live show, flounders as a newbie unfamiliar with the medium.
Once again, Lane plays schlock impresario Max Bialystock and Broderick is the nebbish accountant Leo Bloom, who shows up to check the books and ends up signing on as a producing partner in what he calculates ought to be a no-fail way to pocket investors' money from a surefire flop. The ''mother lode'' of a bad script the two unearth is Springtime for Hitler, an affectionate singing-and-dancing ode to the fascist despot. The playwright, Franz Liebkind, is a nuts Nazi; Roger DeBris, the terrible director they pick for the job, is a swishing queen whose showbiz motto is ''Keep it gay!'' And DeBris' ''common-law assistant,'' Carmen Ghia, is an officious hysteric.
The production features many from the original Broadway cast, including Gary Beach as Roger and Desperate Housewives ' Roger Bart as Carmen. But original is not necessarily better. Those purists who tut-tut the choice of Will Ferrell as Liebkind, or Uma Thurman as the cartoonishly breathy Swedish bombshell Ulla, a role made memorable on stage by Cady Huffman, might learn a thing or two from their ease under the camera lights. (Uma/Ulla, by the way, is a peach.)
The accountant in Bloom would probably approve of the new Producers : It's an efficient extension of a popular brand. In theory, what's not to like? In reality, the whole schmear.

 The Broadway production of "The Producers," with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, was apparently such a sensational show that a great many people were willing to pay $100 to see it.  Judging from the show's success, they seem to have gotten their money's worth, which raises a fascinating question, as much an economic as an aesthetic puzzle. Here is a movie version of the musical, with the same director (Susan Stroman), the same book and lyrics (by the tireless Mel Brooks, aided on the book by Thomas Meehan) and much of the same cast. Tickets cost a tenth or less of what the best seats did on Broadway, with the added value of Uma Thurman doing a Swedish accent in high heels and a short dress and Will Ferrell as a nutty Nazi. So why isn't this a bargain?  Or to put it even more bluntly, how come the movie feels, in every sense, like a rip-off? Nobody expects the jokes to be fresh or the songs to be any good. Some of the big laugh lines have been provoking groans since the first, nonmusical "Producers" movie way back in 1968, and probably even longer, since even that film was a fond, nostalgic embrace of a dying show business tradition. And no one - probably not even Mr. Brooks himself - would suggest that he belongs in the pantheon of American theatrical composers. ("I'm gonna put on shows that will enthrall 'em/ Read my name in Winchell's column"? It ain't Rodgers and Hammerstein. It ain't even M. C. Hammer.) So it may take a faithful rendering on-screen to reveal the real essence of "The Producers" in its musical incarnation - its vulgarity, its cynicism, its utter lack of taste, charm or wit.  I don't just mean that the show's retrograde humor - drooling over showgirls, sending up antiquated homosexual stereotypes - is offensive. The intention seems to be simultaneously to mock that kind of humor and to enjoy it, as if you could double your laughter that way. Perhaps onstage you could, but that speaks less to the vitality of Mr. Brooks's imagination than to the terminal morbidity of the Broadway musical. Once upon a time - that hazy 50's New York golden age in which "The Producers" seems to take place - musical theater was the class of American pop culture, a source of democratic delight and artistic ingenuity. Now, many big musicals represent the lowest common denominator: theme park attractions for tourists.  The movie audience, I suspect, is more discriminating. In any case, no effort has been made to adjust the show to the scale of the movie screen. Mr. Lane rants and mugs with his characteristic energy and agility, but you wish he would modulate just the tiniest bit. Or failing that, that Mr. Broderick could dry off enough to function as an interesting foil, rather than as a flailing, hysterical ninny.  Ms. Stroman, meanwhile, does not have the filmmaking instincts to match her deft, emphatic choreography. The close-ups may cause you to cower under your seat or reach for an umbrella to fend off the spray of saliva that seems about to pour from the screen. At other times you may find yourself involuntarily yelling "Watch out!" to Ms. Thurman, who is frequently in danger of bumping her head on the top of the frame.  She, however, is the one bit of genuine radiance in this aggressively and pointlessly shiny, noisy spectacle. As Ulla, the long-stemmed receptionist, would-be actress and apple of Bloom's eye, she alone turns a tired joke into good, crazy fun. Gary Beach, as the flamboyantly gay director Roger DeBris, and Roger Bart as his muse, Carmen Ghia, try for something similar, but it would take a lot more than a ball gown and a song called "Keep It Gay" for them to succeed.  The loud, lavish crudeness of "The Producers" reduces its one interesting idea to incoherence. Bialystock and Bloom hatch a scheme to produce a guaranteed bomb, "Springtime for Hitler," in order to bilk their elderly investors. When opening night arrives, it is something of a relief, though also a source of confusion. Here are numbers that are supposed to be bad, which must mean that the rest of the movie is bad by accident.  "The Producers" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some leering, naughty jokes and a smattering of profanity.

So determinedly old-fashioned it makes a strong claim to being the best film musical of 1959, "The Producers" comes full circle back to the screen 38 years after the original with much, if not all, of its mirth intact. Reproducing Mel Brooks' still-running Broadway smash so literally you can practically see the proscenium arch, new pic is undeniably stagy, even clunky, and its commercial fate rests on whether auds find the blunt theatrical artifice and playing-to-the-balcony performance style off-putting or endearing. Older viewers should turn this exuberant, sometimes hilarious picture into a moderate hit domestically for Universal, although Sony/Columbia's prospects overseas look shaky.
With most of the key cast and creative personnel from the legit production returning for the screen rendition, Brooks obviously did not want to mess with success, even though just turning the cameras on a winning stage venture doesn't guarantee bigscreen success. Given that "The Producers" is all about putting on a show, it's entirely proper the picture retains its theatrical feel. Still, it's been a very long time since a stage musical was so minimally reconceived for motion pictures.
It's hard to guess how many of those who go to this latest incarnation of "The Producers" will be seeing it for the first time. Presumably most people are familiar with the classic premise in which unscrupulous theater producer Max Bialystock enlists uptight accountant Leo Bloom in a scheme to make a pot of money from a play designed to be a one-night flop.
A seeming majority of the scenes are devoted to someone, usually Max, trying to convince somebody else to do something that no one in their right mind would do. In the long opening scene in his messy office across from Sardi's, the desperate Max attempts to convince ever-cautious Leo to go into business with him. The high-pitched hysteria at which this scene is played by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, who made the roles their own and then some in the Tony-drenched 2001 Broadway production, generates some concerns about where the tone of the movie can possibly go from here, as does stage helmer and choreographer Susan Stroman's uncertainty about where to place the camera other than front-row center (it's worth remembering that Brooks' own direction of the 1967 original was pretty rudimentary).
Helping get the pic off the soundstage is "Along Came Bialy," in which little old ladies with walkers -- Max's gullible investors --pursue Max across Fifth Avenue into Central Park. And while this number, like most of the musical interludes, doesn't pack quite the brassy knockout punch it did onstage, pic has found its legs by the time Max and Leo set their sights on producing can't-miss disaster "Springtime for Hitler."
No one, including the reasonably cast Will Ferrell here, could match the inspired lunacy of Kenneth Mars' original turn as the demented, fuehrer-loving playwright Franz Liebkind, who has trained his pet pigeons to wing salute and gives his producers Nazi armbands to wear.
But things switch into high gear when Max and Leo recruit cross-dressing director Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) to mount the production. Roger's aide de camp is played by Roger Bart as the ultimate swish, mincing queen, pushing the old stereotype so far with his endlessly held hissed s's, rolled eyes and slinky manner that he's even more hilarious onscreen than he was onstage, stealing every scene he's in even when relegated to the background.
"The Producers" reaches it peak on the tumultuous opening night, with Max and Leo confident the cat's in the bag when the glamorous crowd reacts with gaping stupefaction at the show's melodious paean to Adolf and the choreographed conquest of Europe, staged in gloriously over-the-top style. It's only when De Bris steps in for the injured Franz as Hitler and sits on the edge of the stage, Judy Garland-style, that the fleeing audience is won over.
With hundreds of performances in New York and London under their belts, Lane and Broderick have their characterizations down cold. As the manic Max, Lane is big, broad and massively entertaining, great at belting out his songs and undone only somewhat in what onstage was his triumphant moment, the recapitulation number "Betrayed." Originally done at an even more breakneck pace, the tour de force is performed from Max's jail cell and, for maximum effect, should have been presented in one take. Instead, Stroman has cut it into bits and pieces, trying to lend it extra energy when none is needed.
Broderick proves an effectively uptight foil, but is alternately overly shrill and frozen-pasty in the early going before loosening up to win the favors of the va-va-voom office secretary played by a game but ultimately miscast Uma Thurman.
Snappy tunes, which possess the old-time Broadway spirit infused with Catskills-style irreverent humor, keep things bouncing along, and Mark Friedberg's production design and William Ivey Long's costumes rejoice in their self-conscious theatricality. End credits provide the opportunity for entirely appropriate curtain calls, capped by a shot of Brooks himself telling any stragglers, "Get out! It's over!"

Susan Stroman 's adaptation of The Producers  is a reasonably accurate representation of the Mel Brooks  musical she directed on Broadway, albeit as seen through opera glasses slouched down in a seat in the front row. The sense of magnified shtickwith Nathan Lane  bellowing at the balcony from the fake confines of his impossibly vast officeis not unlike the moment in the new King Kong  where the ape erupts into Times Square , grabbing blondes and petulantly tossing them away. Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
A flop in 1968 and a cult movie thereafter, The Producers  popularized the term "creative accounting." Max Bialystock , a washed-up Broadway impresario who finances his shows by romancing little old ladies, teams up with the mousy accountant Leo Bloom  to bilk their backers by overselling shares in a guaranteed flop. But the scheme backfires when their carefully selected neo-Nazi musical Springtime for Hitler   becomes a camp smash hitjust like the musical that Brooks contrived from his movie in 2001. Does the new Producers  retain any of the original's shock value? Need you even ask?
The perfunctory '50s setting hardly restores the jokealthough it celebrates a no-longer-extant Broadway. Brooks's clever, not exactly parodic, score is pleasantly retro and better than serviceable. The "Springtime for Hitler" set piece still conveys a powerful inanityit's the best song in the show, and, like Brooks's Sinatra-friendly "High Anxiety," is a classic that no one, to my knowledge, has dared to cover. Some klutzy subFreed Unit choreography aside, Stroman's direction flirts with vulgarity without ever crossing over. Lane and Matthew Broderick  make a far cuter couple than the original Max and Leo, Zero Mostel  and Gene Wilder . Broderick is a genuine trouper, hoofing his way through his big numbers, while Lane's antics are difficult to resist, despite his need to signify merriment by opening his mouth in a pantomimed hysteria. Gary Beach 's impossibly queeny director and even riper consort Roger Bart  (both of whom originated their roles onstage) constitute a massive inoculationnot unlike the gay-baiting in last year's prize movie musical, Team America .
There's no business like show business, and the musical Producers ' considerable success showed the original movie to have been propheticof itself. Thus, The Producers  has mutated into a story of self-actualization. Is there a Saturday-morning cartoon series in Max and Leo's future? The Producers: The Musical: The Movie  insists, even as it demonstrates, that the show must go on . . . and on.
