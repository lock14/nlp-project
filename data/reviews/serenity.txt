Hats off to Joss Whedon�s army of fans and their enduring ire over the cancellation of his 2002 television show, Firefly
. Critics savaged the Western/sci-fi hybrid, viewers stayed away in droves, and Fox pulled the show midseason. But his fans� continued devotion � and their  DVD-buying dollars � kept if not the series then the idea of Firefly
 alive, which was enough to convince Universal to greenlight the feature film we now have before us called Serenity
. Geek much? As a one-time obsessive of Whedon�s Buffy the Vampire Slayer
 who eventually wearied of its wisecracking Scooby gang (and, even more so, of its rabid fanbase), I�ll admit to some reluctance here. Having never watched the source show, I had two primary concerns about Serenity
: Did it make sense, and did it suck? In short order: Yes (more or less), and no, not in the least. Newbies should pay close attention to the opening minutes, though, in which the backstory of this bizarro universe is laid out. The setting is 500 years in the future. A massive civil war has splintered the solar system, but the Alliance eventually squashed the insurrection and united the system under its singular rule. Rebel fighter Mal Reynolds (Fillion, square-jawed and irresistibly piss and vinegar) ended up on the losing side; he now captains the ship Serenity
 and its eccentric crew-cum-outlaws, crooking in the shadow of the Alliance. Serenity
 picks up here, with complications arising from the addition to the crew of a doctor (Maher) and his psychic sister, River (Glau). Seems River is precious cargo � she�s been trained by the government to be something of a killing machine � and the Alliance has dispatched an assassin (a chilling Ejiofor) to reclaim her. Serenity
 sticks to the same template of Whedon�s Buffy
 and Angel
 series: quip-happy, with a fixation on the supernatural or otherworldly, and a salty ensemble cast of characters bound by loyalty and tough love. But if it ain�t broke, don�t fix it: Those tried-and-true conventions have everything to do with Serenity
�s charm. (A welcome surprise, however, is the film�s unique vernacular, which skips from cowboy to Chinese; once the giggliness of it wears off, the dialect achieves a peculiar sort of poetry.) Prior knowledge no doubt enriches the experience, clarifies certain relationships that are only hinted at in the film (indeed, some carry-over characters have very little to do here). But stand alone, Serenity
 evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original Star Wars
 films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas� humorless prequels. There are restless stretches, sure, and the occasional nosedive into incomprehensibility, but they�re overwhelmed by the film�s comic fleet of foot, the aggressively staged action sequences, and a few shocks that very nearly knocked the wind out of me. And in a final tip of the hat, this time entirely to Whedon: Isn�t that just like a TV writer to make his cheeky central thesis the power of the televised image to foment revolution?


"Serenity" is the name of both an enormous space-faring jalopy in the 26th century and the hotly anticipated film the ship sails through. For folks like me, who missed "Firefly," the short-lived TV show on which the movie's based, watching "Serenity" is like showing up for a big lecture course at the end of the semester. And yet, after an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining.
"Serenity" marks a miraculous moment for the 4.4 million people who weekly watched "Firefly" before Fox canceled it in 2002, and for the hordes of fans who've made the DVD a bestseller. The show, created by
Joss Whedon, the 41-year-old also responsible for TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," was about a motley band of scavengers in a post-war, post-Earth, multiracial universe.
In the film, the solar system is divided among the cannibalistic Reavers; the Universal Alliance, a crypto-corporate entity that lays down the laws; and the three-man, two-woman Serenity crew, which tries to skirt the law as often as possible.
The movie, which Whedon wrote and directed, resumes more or less where the unaired 14th episode left off. The young telepath River Tam (Summer Glau) had been taken by the Alliance and experimented upon. When we meet River, her brother Simon (Sean Maher), a medic, has rescued her and brought her aboard the Serenity.
The Alliance dispatches a new character called the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to retrieve River. He's a regal (read: British) fellow who sees nothing wrong with wiping out lots of folks to get to the Serenity.
Of course, there are members of the ship's crew who think the Alliance can have the girl. River has been programmed to kill. At one stop, she beats up dozens of people, including Jayne (Adam Baldwin), the hulking mercenary who doesn't trust her. 
But abandoning River and her brother would mean no movie. Funnier and more urgent is that, for Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the ship's randy hick mechanic, getting rid of them would mean no nookie 
for 
her and Simon.
Whedon has a fondness for the comedy in that sort of human predicament. He also demonstrates a healthy respect for the climactic whiz-bang of science fiction, too. But, at its heart, the movie he's made is a Western. The Serenity's captain, Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), is a semi-moral loner whose conscience often takes a back seat to the will to survive. (It's the sort of role that should have made Fillion a big TV star; he has very good comic timing and is credible as a fearless leader.)
Mal's love interest is a courtesan (Morena Baccarin), and they enjoy one of those frustrated "can't live with her . . ." relationships. "You spin me about," he tells her. "I wish you was elsewhere." Louis L'Amour couldn't have writ it finer. The movie's director of photography, Jack N. Green, was Clint Eastwood's longtime cinematographer, and Ruth Carter's excellently weird costumes suggest Marc Jacobs in 1875.
But Whedon has a difficult time managing the movie's tone. If Yakov Smirnoff made an outer-space flick with Wild West overtones, it would be "Serenity." Whedon's writing is much more assured than his direction. Some scenes jerk from the comic to the serious often and violently enough to give a viewer whiplash. It's easy to understand why the show never properly caught on: It's hard to get a grasp on Whedon's inconsistent style, which was rarely the case with "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." Much of this has to do with the editing. The movie looks and feels as if it was cut with a chainsaw.
Still, "Serenity" has instant diehard fans. The night I saw it, one very satisfied customer suggested the movie signaled a sea change in the science-fiction universe. As the credits rolled, he damned George Lucas with an expletive, and many of the dozens of stragglers applauded.
The derision makes sense. "Serenity" does for serious Lucas fans what Lucas hasn't done for them lately. It evokes the wild-and-woolly zing of the first three "Star Wars" pictures, when the series's myth-minded self-seriousness was the stuff of subtext and its dumb jokes could bring down the house. If "Serenity" takes off and spawns sequels (as it seems destined to), it's crucial that Whedon take a lesson from Lucas's greatest flaw and never stop laughing with us.


         To the uninitiated, "Serenity" may seem like just another "Star Trek" knockoff, but to so easily dismiss writer Joss Whedon's feature directing debut, a continuation of his short-lived 2002 sci-fi western TV series "Firefly," would be to miss out on a highly entertaining piece of genre-blending fun.
 
  Already a cult hero based on the series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" — how many writers in any medium can boast fans devoted enough to wear T-shirts that read "Joss Whedon Is My Master Now"? — he further burnished his star among the faithful with "Firefly," which despite its incomplete run on Fox (11 of 14 episodes aired), gained fans through DVD sales and repeats on the Sci Fi Channel (where it's currently running on Friday nights).
 


         






    Picking up in a postwar 26th century where the TV series left off, "Serenity" overcomes mild patches of turbulence to sail straight and true. Whedon reconvenes the original cast, carves out a tidy story rooted firmly in the show's mythology and tosses in a bit of Samuel Taylor Coleridge to boot.
 
  Whedon's not-so-ancient mariner, Capt. Mal Reynolds, a jaded veteran on the losing side of the War for Unification, is weighed down not by guilt and a dead bird, but a painful past and an enigmatic passenger. Played with wary resolve by Canadian actor Nathan Fillion, Mal has given up on the human race with his only priorities being the well-being of his crew and finding the next safe harbor.
 
  The crew of Serenity — a Firefly class interplanetary cargo vessel — has more in common with the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang than the crew of the Enterprise as they whisk across a distant, human-colonized solar system pulling off enough small-time heists to keep them in food, munitions and replacement parts for the beleaguered ship. Their nemesis is the Alliance, a sort of militarized United Nations that governs the Central Planets with a utopia-gone-wrong idealism.
 
  The crew and Capt. Mal share a love-hate relationship built on loyalty and self-preservation that is tested at every turn. The next in command is Zoe (Gina Torres), who served alongside Mal in the war and is Serenity's military tactician when they get into scrapes (which is often). Her husband, Wash (Alan Tudyk), is the ship's pacifist pilot. The heavy artillery comes in the form of Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a mercenary always on the lookout for a better deal. Sensitive Kaylee (Jewel Staite) keeps Serenity running with her gift for all things mechanical.
 
  The comic exchanges among the crew initially seem like mere banter until you realize that Whedon is presenting well-developed relationships involving rejuvenated archetypes — something that will not surprise Whedon fans, who will be the ones in the theater laughing the loudest. Don't worry, the rest of us soon catch up.
 
  There's no need to have seen a single episode of "Firefly" to digest any of this as Whedon craftily weaves the complex exposition into the main story. In the TV series, the crew picked up a pair of passengers who turn out to be more than the crew bargained for. Dr. Simon Tam (Sean Maher) signed on temporarily as Serenity's medic — the crew requires almost as much patching up as the ship — and he brought along his unstable sister, River (Summer Glau), who initially appears fragile and fairly helpless.
 
  Far from it, River turns out to be a psychic prodigy the government subjected to cruel experiments, the result being some serious fighting skills and an erratic triggering mechanism. Simon spends a fortune and sacrifices his career to break her out of a top secret facility and the Alliance wants her back. Serenity and crew are pursued to the far corners of the galaxy by the Operative — a highly principled killing machine, played by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Dirty Pretty Things") — where they also face a cannibalistic breed of humans known as Reavers.
 
  A strongly acted, well-written story fortified by riveting action sequences — a rarity these days among studio releases — "Serenity" should delight Whedon novices as much as the already converted. The fractured cowpoke syntax, sprinkled with occasional forays into Chinese, spoken by Whedon's characters is a little unsettling at first, but it quickly becomes part of the movie's charm. Odd as it may seem, a vernacular that includes phrases such as "I aim to misbehave" and "None of us know'd that" allows the filmmaker to kick the space western up a notch by connecting the two genres so explicitly. Whedon knows that he's blazing down a well-worn trail, but he addresses that by deftly adding elements of humor, action, romance and horror and continually confounding audience expectations.

Reckon I'd better own up here at the trailhead: I'm a fan of Firefly , the short-lived 2002 Fox TV series on which Serenity  is based. If you're not familiar with the crisp wit and ornery imagination of writer-creator Joss Whedon's rusty-nail space Western  no aliens, no lightsabers, just human society, barely cohering on the retro-astro fringe  your chances of appreciating this film are markedly lower, though certainly not nil. Likely you'll feel a pleasant bemusement, akin to watching an excellent foreign film with a deliberately incomplete translation. I'm hardly exaggerating: The characters often lapse into a crisp, quasi-frontiersy patois, peppered with Chinese slang. (Let that settle in your head  it works, honest.)
The first vision of the future to incorporate starships and suspenders, Serenity  (helmed by first-time feature director Whedon) embraces its space-Westernness with rich, oaty literalism. The planet-hopping rust bucket of the title is home to a wagon train of untidy, un–Star Trek  misfits prowling the ''raggedy edge'' of a newly colonized solar system in search of extralegal employment. Their leader, Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), is a chipperly bitter veteran of a vast, interplanetary civil war. (Consider him a 26th-century version of the romantically unreconstructed Reb.) He's hiding a fugitive psychic, River (Summer Glau), on the run from her Union, er, Alliance handlers. (Fans of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer  will recognize the damaged supergirl with childlike tics and godlike abilities.) River is pursued by a nameless government operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a self-described monster driven by a placid, unshakable belief in the ''better world'' he's helping to nurture. The rest of the crew  a true ensemble on the show  are, sadly, pencil sketches here, casualties of the two-hour running time. But each gets a ''moment'' that fans are free to unzip and decompress into a real character arc.
The same goes for the story beats. Serenity , despite its simple chase plot and elegant narrative ductwork, is unmistakably a TV season's worth of roller-coastering drama, most of it balanced on the capable shoulders of Fillion, a natural leading man. Jaw set but never stiff, he gets both the Whedon wit and the Whedon grandiloquence between cheek and gum, and gives the whole enterprise the heft of a real saga. Which it most certainly is  especially for those who were already saddled up for the ride.

 It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's "Serenity" to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious "Star Wars: Episode III  - Revenge of the Sith." But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, "Serenity" is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. Mr. Whedon isn't aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time. The journey is the message, not him.  As the creator of  "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," writing the original movie and producing the television series, Mr. Whedon has enjoyed an exalted position in the pop stratosphere. Over the years he has lent his talent, sometimes without credit, to screenplays for "Toy Story," "Speed" and the last and least successful "Alien" film, "Alien: Resurrection." He also writes comic books, including an "X-Men" line. But Mr. Whedon, the son and grandson of television writers, is principally a natural-born small-screen auteur, graced with a quick, idiosyncratic wit and a facility for serial storytelling. In addition to "Buffy," he created that show's spinoff, "Angel," and in 2002, a curious genre hybrid called "Firefly" he had pitched as "Stagecoach" in space.  Fox aired just 11 episodes of "Firefly" before pulling the plug. The network refused to commit, but not so the fans who, as they did with "Buffy," turned this patchwork of fan-boy love and recycled parts into a cult. Evidence of their passion was later reflected in the DVD sales of "Firefly," which were impressive enough for Universal to pony up for a big-screen version. Named after the ramshackle spaceship that hauls Mr. Whedon's characters from one far-out adventure to the next, "Serenity" picks up where the series left off, with these plucky, shambling outsiders fighting oppression against impossible odds. As Mr. Whedon knows, the fastest way to a geek's heart is a story about other geeks, albeit ones with good hair and hot bodies.  The story so far: Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), Mal for short, is zipping around 500 years in the future trying to make ends meet by scrounging for freight and hauling passengers. A veteran of a war of independence, Mal fought on the losing side and has yet to cross over to greener, more lucrative pastures. Along with his second in command, Zoe (a ferocious Gina Torres), Mal runs the Serenity with honor, guts and a touch of panic. He is the kind of leader who barks out a rhetorical question - asking if any of the crew want to run the ship -  only to be flummoxed when he receives a resounding yes in return. (Mal then stammers to Adam Baldwin's thuggish crew hand that he can't.) Mal's iron glove covers a velvety soft fist.  Mr. Whedon sketches his characters with quick brush strokes, leaving his appealing cast to fill in the holes with banter and serious-looking busywork. Everyone takes to their task well, though only Mal and a fierce Whedonesque creation called River (Summer Glau, a pint-size Barbara Steele) take root. Hot-wired to kill and on the run from her government masters, this spooky beauty floats through the ship in a series of fetching shifts that make her look like an errant Martha Graham dancer, every so often going entertainingly berserk and wreaking Michelle Yeoh-style damage. Underlying River's murderous power  - and perhaps her government-induced psychosis  - is a lost little girl trying to carve out a place and a self to call her own.  As this scrap of boilerplate narrative suggests, Mr. Whedon is too much of genre savant to take his film anywhere genuinely surprising. He may also be too much of a movie novice to exploit his material as boldly as you might hope. What made "Firefly" stand apart from the usual television dross, beyond Mr. Whedon's chatter and characters, was his fusion of science-fiction tropes with those of the western. Mal wears a gun strapped to his thigh, while a lariat necklace circles Zoe's throat. He peppers his speech with "y'all," and together they travel to dusty towns that look as if they might have been built for a Roy Rogers oater.  And just to bring this science-fiction fantasy up to geopolitical speed, every so often somebody spits a curse in Mandarin.  Transposing a western to outer space presented a calculated risk, the stuff of either "Star Trek" legend or kitsch. Yet what was most beautiful about "Firefly" was that Mr. Whedon wasn't afraid of looking silly. Taking its cue from the famous first words of "Star Trek" - "Space, the final frontier" - his show reinvigorated Gene Roddenberry's premise with the sincerity of a true believer. "Star Trek" was born at a time when space travel was cloaked in optimism and cold-war anxiety. "Star Wars," meanwhile, born out of Saturday matinee clichés and in a time of political cynicism, trafficked in a gee-whiz escapism so strong it survived even a recent swerve into realpolitik. In the years since, and for myriad reasons, science fiction, at least in film, has turned Dystopia into a boomtown.  Mr. Whedon shows little interest in recycling the gloom-and-doom scenarios that have become ubiquitous in science-fiction cinema over the last few decades. Mal is no Neo redux; he's closer to Indiana Jones, if absent Harrison Ford's rakishly handsome looks and star magnetism. Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Fillion is a charming performer, but he borrows rather than owns the screen, which dovetails with Mr. Whedon's modest aspirations for this film. As both a writer and a director, he isn't staking a claim on genre; he's just using it for a short while to tell a story about some decent men and women struggling against both the tyranny of bureaucratic control and their own very human failings.  "Serenity" works nicely as a movie, although in blowing his television series up to the big screen, Mr. Whedon has lost some of the woolliness that made "Firefly" such a pleasant oddity. (Alas, he also lost most of the banjos and twangy guitars.) Even with a bigger canvas, Mr. Whedon doesn't do much with the camera. His setups are generally perfunctory: a means to a storytelling end for what is, at heart, a $40 million B-movie. It's too bad there isn't one image here as striking and resonant as the shot that closes the opening-credit sequence in "Firefly," the one with the horses galloping toward the camera as they're buzzed overhead by a spaceship. With this single image, Mr. Whedon announced he had reopened a frontier some of us thought long closed.  "Serenity" is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Despite some fight scenes, this is a relatively clean PG-13 with little graphic violence and no sexually exploitative snark.

A correction was made to this review on Aug. 23, 2005.
"I am a leaf on the wind: Watch how I soar," says one character in "Serenity" before being promptly made earthbound. The same could be said of this feature bow by writer-director Joss Whedon, creator of "Buffy" and "Angel" as well as cult TV sci-fi oater "Firefly," of which current item is a bigscreen continuation. Quirky blend of Western elements, high-end pulp philosophy, decorative Orientalia, old-style frontier dialogue and straight space shenanigans bounces around to sometimes memorable effect but rarely soars. Whedon's sizable fan base will turn out in droves but this will need a hefty marketing push to post galactic returns.

Following its world preem at the Edinburgh fest, pic goes out wide Stateside Sept. 30, a potentially risky gambit for a cult-fueled venture that would benefit from more time to build beyond its card-carrying audience. Though the widescreen movie contains a reasonable amount of action sequences, it was clearly made with considerably less coin than tentpole studio fare, and still shows a TV-style aptitude for soundstage sequences separated by occasional exteriors.
The Fox network axed "Firefly" in December 2002 after only 11 of the 14 completed episodes had aired. Series went on to immediate cult status on ancillary, and most of the key actors reprise their roles here. Major addition to the cast is Brit thesp Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Amistad," "Dirty Pretty Things" and upcoming "Kinky Boots"), who darn near steals the movie as the good guys' ruthless nemesis.
Familiarity with the original episodes isn't necessary, as a tight opening effectively recaps the backstory. We're 500 years in the future, following a war in a newly colonized solar system that was won by a coalition called the Alliance; the losers, the Independents, roam the outer planets like frontier cowboys, along with the Reavers, thugs who eat their enemies live.
In an interesting idea that largely lies undeveloped -- and has some contempo relevance in a globalized world -- the Independents hate the Alliance because the latter are "in their homes, in their heads, (and) tell them what to think." The Alliance is also inside one particular head -- that of River Tam (Summer Glau), a 17-year-old telepath whose brother, Simon (Sean Maher), rescues her from Alliance boffins and security high-up the Operative (Ejiofor) in a pre-credits sequence that's one of the best in the picture. Tone lightens as the main story and cast show up. Simon was helped in his mission by Capt. Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion, channeling a combo of Harrison Ford and the late Eric Fleming from "Rawhide"), who heads the crew of Firefly-class spaceship Serenity, a rusty-bucket transport vessel. Also on board are his deputy, Zoe (Gina Torres), similarly dressed and holstered like a cowboy; Zoe's husband, Wash (Alan Tudyk), the craft's ace pilot; gruff gunslinger Jayne (Adam Baldwin, in a good impression of Warren Oates); and corn-fed farm girl Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the ship's mechanic.
Main action sequence, realized like a space-age stagecoach-and-Injuns chase, comes early on, as Mal & Co. pull off a payroll robbery on an outer planet and are disturbed by Reavers. Thereafter, most of the action is confined to futuristic interiors -- handled OK but, excepting a late-on mano a mano by River, with no special atmosphere.
Pic's appeal lies in other areas, from its mimicking of period, stately Americana in the dialogue (Mal: "No more runnin'; I aim to misbehave"; Jayne: "She is starting to damage my calm") to the plot itself. Latter leads Mal & Co., via River's half-buried memories, to an uncharted planet called Miranda, wherein lies a terrible secret that the Alliance would like to remain buried.
Hot on their tails at all times is the Operative, plus assorted hungry Reavers. Oh, and there's also Inara (Morena Baccarin), a professional "companion" for whom Mal still carries a torch.
Nobody seems to have told Whedon that many U.S. sci-fiers were already Westerns in futuristic dress, and that cross-cultural Eastern-Westerns were invented 40 years ago. What may have seemed fresh on network TV doesn't look quite so fresh on the bigscreen.
Still, what makes "Serenity" refreshing is its avoidance of CGI, which gives the pic a much more human dimension; the evident chemistry between the cast; and a humor that doesn't rely simply on flip one-liners. None of these smarts, however, may be enough to satisfy mass auds.
Fillion makes a commanding enough lead and is neatly backed up by a buff Torres as his femme sidekick, especially in a hold-the-fort sequence that recalls Jenette Goldstein's character in "Aliens." Staite brings welcome fragility to the hard-assed crew as the tomboy mechanic, and former ballerina Glau brings neat moves to her action moments.
Sets look considerably airier than in the TV series, though Whedon directs his interior sequences in a visually constricted way that shows his small-screen origins. Colors have a mostly dark, unappetizing look that becomes a tad wearisome over two hours, and David Newman's score does the business but never elevates the material.

Last week's A History of Violence  relocated the western to the contemporary American heartland. In this week's Serenity , Joss Whedon  finds the old West in outer space, where noble outlaws struggle to stay ahead of the corrupt Alliance (think Star Trek 's Federation with the whole "boldly go" aspect replaced by pure, autocratic evil).
Making his feature debut as writer and director, Whedon fashions a story line that slyly mirrors his own efforts to keep his short-lived show Firefly  alive. Serenity  focuses on the struggles of a ragtag band of outsiders trying desperately to get a high-tech videotape played on intergalactic television. The Alliance will do anything to keep it off the air, including murdering the only independent broadcaster in the 'verse. The film, right down to the tagline ("You can't stop the signal"), is one big middle finger to Fox TV  executives.
Of course, it remains to be seen whether anyone who couldn't be bothered to watch Firefly  for free will pay $10.75 to see Serenity , but those who do will be too engrossed by the film's effective blend of humor, horror, and action to contemplate what they've missed. Though richly allegorical, Serenity  also works as a rousing and unabashedly manipulative adventure that never takes itself too seriously. Whedon, who always delights in blending genres and tones, has assembled his most frantically disparate collection of pop culture quotations, boldly and cleverly going where plenty have gone before.
