What is it with men in women’s romantic fantasy films? When they’re not aging backward like Benjamin Button, they’re falling in love from two years away (“The Lake House’’) or from the Great Beyond (“Ghost’’) or from another planet (“Starman’’). They’re perfect but just not for keeping. The good ones, these movies imply, always get away.
In “The Time Traveler’s Wife,’’ the good one keeps getting away and coming back, getting away and coming back, like a dreamboat yo-yo. His name is Henry and he’s played by Eric Bana, which is all many women will need to know, and he has a peculiar condition that at one point, with the sort of earnestness that can provoke gales of laughter if you’re feeling rude, is called “chrono-impermanence.’’ Henry helplessly shuttles from point to point in his own life, dissolving here, re-appearing without his clothes there. It’s hell on a relationship. Imagine Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five’’ hero Billy Pilgrim, unstuck in time and landing in a tearjerker.
Based on a best-selling novel by Audrey Niffenegger, “Time Traveler’s Wife’’ is told with a tenderness that’s unusual in a major motion picture but that leads mostly to dullness. At some point  - the mechanics of time travel are left vague  - Henry has met and fallen in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams) and he regularly visits her in her childhood, readying her for the oddities of their future life together. Young girls who see this movie should probably be cautioned: If a naked man speaks to you from a bush and tells you he’s your one true love, do not go with him. Even if he looks like Eric Bana.
Because Clare does, she’s prepared for when the two meet as adults. Time-travel here is treated as an annoying but manageable physical condition, like Celiac disease or Tourette’s syndrome, and a surprising amount of humor is mined from Henry’s little problem. So what if he drops out of his tuxedo five minutes before his own wedding? A knack for predicting lottery numbers makes up for it.
While the movie is told less from Clare’s point of view than in the novel, this is still very much the story of a woman living with a frustratingly wayward man. (Ah, but it’s not his fault.) The scenes where the wife takes back some of her own life  - at one point somehow cheating on her husband with her husband  - are the film’s sharpest moments. At its best, “The Time Traveler’s Wife’’ does suggest the preciousness of a life that’s too often beyond our control. At its worst, it’s more than a little nuts.
The film’s disarming gentleness eventually works its way toward a soft-focus crisis that had every woman in the screening I attended happily snorfling into her Kleenex, so on that score the film’s a success. McAdams, already a stalwart of this genre after “The Notebook,’’ spends the movie glowing with the certainty of a woman’s love for a difficult spouse. Bana just keeps a straight face, which by itself qualifies him for an Oscar.

The Time Traveler's Wife , adapted from the 2003 best-seller by Audrey Niffenegger, is one of those gooey romantic mind-benders, like Ghost  (which I adored) or The Lake House  (not so much), in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship, such as life after death or a hole  in the space-time continuum. Only instead of being milked for elaborate science-fiction thrills, the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience . Sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips.
Henry (Eric Bana) is deeply, and eternally, in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams), and  she with him. The only problem is that he has a ''genetic anomaly'' that causes him to skip around through time without warning. All of a sudden, he will melt out of the present and pop up...somewhere else, in the future or in the past, without a stitch of clothing on, so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings. Then, just as suddenly, he'll pop back into  Clare's life  sometimes when he's too young a man to have any idea who she is. (A little confused? So was I.) More jarringly, he sometimes appears when he's an adult and she's an adoring young girl standing in a   pastoral meadow. That's when she falls in love with him  which is meant to be innocent, but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy. I mean, is the movie supposed  to look like a contemporary version of The Lewis Carroll Story ? To muddle matters further, Henry is seen at assorted ages, but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair, Bana looks exactly the same in every scene.
The Time Traveler's Wife  is built as a game that the audience learns to play, and after a while, yes, we do get the hang of it. That is, we accept the film's mixture of the playful  and the slightly arbitrary; we become romantic time travelers too. Although the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote Ghost , the film's mood doesn't change very much; it's gentle, wistful, gauzy, and placid. Bana, so fantastic in Munich , has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodin's The Thinker   can play a gentle, unassuming regular guy. But he does nicely here. He and McAdams are sweet together, with matching dimples and starry eyes, and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place. In the end, that's all there is to the movie, really. It's a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat. B–


 You could say that “The Time Traveler’s Wife” is a science-fictiony romance about eternal love and all that sniffy, weepy stuff. Or you could think of it as a crazy story about a stalker who sweet-talks a little girl whom he later seduces when she’s a teenager only to then knock her up and emotionally, psychologically and spiritually knock her down again and again, as he hopscotches naked across the time-space continuum.  Of course one woman’s romantic fantasy can be another’s gas-lighted nightmare, which is why it’s easy to read Audrey Niffenegger’s chart-busting novel in such dramatically different ways. A chronological confusion, it turns on a contemporary romance between an unwilling time traveler, Henry, and the woman he marries, Clare. In the novel the romance comes across as airy and coy and unpersuasive. But what feels light on the page   can seem exceedingly ponderous once a filmmaker transposes those words into the visual realm. It is, after all, one thing to read about a naked guy talking up a 6-year-old girl while he’s hiding in some bushes. It’s another thing entirely to watch the big, strapping, healthy Eric Bana groping the greens.  It isn’t his fault. Indeed, watching Mr. Bana frequently strut his seminude stuff, nimbly avoiding the full-frontal reveal even as he flashes some discreet cheek, is one of the few pleasures afforded by this often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation. A sometime librarian, Henry has been born with a genetic anomaly that causes him to take abrupt hops across time, losing his clothes in the process. He first meets Clare (a frumped-up Rachel McAdams) when he’s 28, and she’s a 20-year-old art student. She’s new to Henry, but she knows and adores him because he has been regularly visiting her since she was 6, popping in and out of her life, though always when he was older. (Got that?)    Much like Henry, the novel jumps all over the timeline and unfolds through alternating he-said, she-said, first-person voices. Notably it’s Henry who first describes an early, crucial encounter between his 36-year-old self and the  self-possessed 6-year-old Clare, which shrewdly puts you right inside his (innocent) head. First-person narration in novels can make you feel intensely close to a character, as if you had crawled into another being. In the book you’re not only by Henry’s side when he’s hiding in those bushes: you’re also on his side, or at least that’s the idea. This means that by the time the 6-year-old Clare describes a similar  encounter pages later, the potential ick factor has already been  defused.  On the screen, however, because the camera hovers vaguely between her point of view and Henry’s — and because the director Robert Schwentke lays a heavy hand on every nuance and has made a dirge about love instead of an ode — the scene wobbles between unpersuasive comedy and outright creepiness, as does much of the movie. It’s instructive that when the book isn’t drooping under the weight of its metaphor (Men! They’re always leaving!), it makes room for pleasure amid the trauma. Ms. Niffenegger grasps the melodramatic truism that tears sting the strongest when the audience feels as if it had lost something, which helps explain her sales. By contrast, the filmmakers (the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin) shroud the movie in foreboding as Henry looks for some clothes, and you search for your smile.  “The Time Traveler’s Wife” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Duh, love hurts.

"The Time Traveler's Wife" may not make a lick of sense, but it does make for fairly irresistible nonsense. Auds who like their supernatural cinema rigorous and cerebral may have trouble warming to this beguilingly irrational tale of two soulmates finding and losing each other across time and space. But despite its breezily demented Mobius-strip construction, the film's unerring emotional logic, anchored by a pair of actors (Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana) who give themselves over to the conceit completely, should win over a solid, femme-driven audience, with even stronger returns from date-night ancillary.
Adapted from Audrey Niffenegger's 2004 bestseller, the picture falls in a tradition of endearingly ridiculous, impossibly dreamy sci-fi romances, from 1980's "Somewhere in Time" to 2006's "The Lake House." Like those films, "The Time Traveler's Wife" insists on a love that transcends both time and common sense; with the winsome pairing of Bana and McAdams, it's a fantasy that, for the most part, happily rings true.
Things get off to a rough start as a fiery car crash claims the life of a woman but not that of her 6-year-old son, Henry (Alex Ferris), who, at the last minute, unwittingly teleports himself into the recent past. Quickly returned to the accident scene, Henry meets an older version of himself (Bana), who abruptly informs the traumatized tot that he has just traveled through time. "He," of course, refers to older Henry and
 younger Henry, both of whom have the ability -- or rather, the uncontrollable compulsion -- to hopscotch between past, present and future.
Confused yet? As penned by Bruce Joel Rubin (Oscar-winning scribe of another paranormal love story, "Ghost"), the film plays out as a series of chronological seizures, a la "Slaughterhouse-Five," leaping back and forth across the long arc of Henry's life -- the dazzling centerpiece of which is his relationship with earthy, dark-haired beauty Clare (McAdams). Here they are, meeting for the first time (or is it the 200th?) in the library where Henry works. But there he goes, back to a lush green meadow where he tries to convince 6-year-old Clare (Brooklynn Proulx) he's her friend without giving away that he's also the love of her life.
Stymied at first by exposition that complicates more than it clarifies (when Clare says, "I don't know what the hell's going on," you want to tell her to get in line), helmer Robert Schwentke ("Flightplan") keeps the narrative threads moving so swiftly, and with such hypnotic urgency, even viewers who initially object to the film's silliness may find themselves firmly in the grip of its romantic delirium. (For some, it won't hurt that Henry's condition forces him to time-travel in the nude, one of the few rules the pic sticks to with dogged consistency.)
"The Time Traveler's Wife" asks viewers to surrender their reason but not their wits; there's pleasure to be had in working out the story's puzzles (because there are multiple Henrys in play, details of hair color become especially important) and poking holes in its paradoxes. Never so somber that they neglect the entertaining possibilities of their premise, Schwentke and Rubin playfully invest their storytelling with a real sense of fun, even mischief -- from the door-slamming farce of Henry and Clare's wedding to the highly pragmatic solution Clare takes when she has trouble carrying a child to term.
The governing principle here, unusual for the time-travel subgenre, is that even when Henry tampers with his past, he is fundamentally unable to alter his future. For all its obvious forerunners, the film emerges as a close cousin of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," another bittersweet account of two lovers trying to live together as best they can in the face of inconvenient and unusual biological circumstances.
McAdams draws on the romantic-tearjerker chops she displayed to captivating effect in "The Notebook," while Bana suffers, endures and charms like a pro. While they've had meatier roles, the two actors keep this restless film firmly grounded; its focus on them is so consuming that even the fine supporting cast (including Ron Livingston and Arliss Howard as Henry's friend and father, respectively) has little time to fully register.
The pic is set in Chicago but was mainly shot in Toronto; the locations have an old-fashioned, picturesque quality that, along with capable visual effects and clever camera tricks, heightens the film's underlying sense of fantasy. The story may fall apart the minute the credits roll, but any movie that can wring fresh emotion from the image of two lovers running toward each other across an open field is clearly doing something right.

A dapper (mostly) contemporary costume drama, The Time Traveler's Wife  is abundantly interior-decorated in vintage rococo. Eric Bana , to his credit, continues to wear the outfits picked out for him remarkably well. The hip-bougie upholstery even covers the band at the fairy-tale wedding, playing "Love Will Tear Us Apart." It's not really love, though, that complicates things between Clare (Rachel McAdams ) and Henry (Bana), but, instead, Henry's tendency to inconveniently melt in and out of the present, finding himself unceremoniously stranded somewhere in time, naked. The "absentee time-traveling partner" is an open invitation to apply your own metaphor—I favor a time-travel-equals-chronic-blackout-drinking reading, but it's elastic enough for whatever. Wife  recalls a few other timeline-tangled romances, not least the telescoped lifelong love of 1948's Portrait of Jennie —but where Jennie  favored a "poetic" logic (and no-strings-attached romance), Wife  forgoes any sense of mystery, dealing in the daily difficulties of synchronizing schedules, doctors' appointments, vasectomies, pregnancies, and meeting friends and parents (all crowding the movie and further diluting the already-limited rapport of the central lovers). This thoroughness may impress fans of the bestseller source novel, but will disappoint anyone looking for transport from a movie—being a time traveler's wife, it turns out, is mostly a drag.
