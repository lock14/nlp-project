Long after Jean-Luc Godard (One Plus One/Sympathy for the Devil
) and Albert Maysles (Gimme Shelter
), one of the great American neorealists of the 1970s, Hal Ashby, took his shot at the Rolling Stones in Let�s Spend the Night Together
, a concert film from the group�s 1981 U.S. tour. With the infamous UK outfit�s front line pushing 40 and its rhythm section older, the media pulled the "Last Time� angle, then shrugged off Ashby�s stadium aftermath. The previous decade�s theatrical parallel, Ladies and Gentleman, the Rolling Stones
, a peak-era 1972 arena show in Fort Worth, also played to yawns. Martin Scorsese�s Shine a Light
 will prompt myriad reactions � shock, awe, glee � but dismissal will be in the minority. Shock comes courtesy of the frontline�s Grand Canyon character lines, disbelief from the soon-to-be 65-year-old frontman�s sheer physical specimen, and roller-coaster thrills via a 17-song set that starts with �Jumping Jack Flash� and concludes on �(I Can�t Get No) Satisfaction.� Like his late street-wise peer Ashby, �Marty� opens backstage, cuts in primo archival footage of the band � hilariously so with the 1966 in-drag video for �Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby?� � then lets a full concert leave its brand. Now well into their 60s, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Charlie Watts still emit that which has beckoned generations of filmmaking fanatics, so Scorsese uses New York�s intimate Beacon Theatre to get into everyone�s craggy face except Charlie Is My Darling
 Watts, whose �Sympathy for the Devil� never creased his impassivity. And yet, when Jagger sidles up to Richards for nose-to-nose harmonies on their beloved country original �Far Away Eyes,� rock & roll�s self-proclaimed Glimmer Twins engender the same trademark chemistry as the young outlaws in Cocksucker Blues
, more cinematic Stones bare-all. Close up, the guitarist�s mascara-burned brown eyes reveal Richards as both teddy bear and Bengal tiger. (Five will get you 10 that�s documentarian emeritus Maysles, credited with �handheld camera,� crouching behind Keef for a kick-drum view of Watts� beats per minute.) Grinding on both Jagger and �Live With Me,� Christina Aguilera reflects the marquee�s legend not by the heart so obviously in her throat but through the determination lining her brow. Scorsese, cameraman on Woodstock
 and The Last Waltz
�s Band leader, shoots up into Jagger�s dental hardware almost to the exclusion of everything else, but the singer�s gritty �Some Girls,� Richards and Ronnie Wood�s steel-string serenade �You Got the Silver,� and Mr. Buddy Guy staring down �Champagne and Reefer� forgive all. As with 1992�s Rolling Stones Live at the MAX
, upsizing Shine a Light
 for IMAX screens (it also plays in conventional theatres) transforms concert film into concert. The film dedicated to Atlantic Records fountainhead Ahmet Ertegun, whose complications from injuries sustained in a tumble backstage at the Beacon resulted in his death, let the record show that a lifetime of musical innovation concluded with dying not at but from
 a Rolling Stones concert.


"Shine a Light" did something I didn't think was possible. It got me caring about the Rolling Stones again.
A documentary record of a two-night stand at New York's Beacon Theatre in the fall of 2006, the film marks a collision between two of pop culture's most stubbornly instinctive creative forces, director Martin Scorsese and Stones frontman Mick Jagger. On the surface, it's not much of a contest: 63 when the film was shot, Jagger remains the Energizer Bunny of rock stars, a miracle of good genes, modern chemistry, or both. The voltage he exudes onstage is nothing less than astounding. I think I pulled a muscle just watching him.
Scorsese, by contrast, lays low after some pre-concert scenes in which we see him fretting comically about a missing set list. Like Hitchcock, the director understands the cartoon that is his public persona - the chatty, movie-obsessed "Marty" - and he has great fun playing with it for a while. But then to the business at hand.
Why a Stones concert film, and why now? The band has been spent as a necessary pop force since the early '80s. Admit it: Everything after "Tattoo You" is marketing and sweat equity. There's nothing wrong with that; all artists live off the fumes of their most fertile period, and by any measure the Stones had an incredible run. Their music - incisive, mean, at times both frightening and beautiful - was a critical ingredient of the youth explosion from 1964 to 1972, and their bad-boy attitude echoed for years after. It echoes still.
Yet the experience of seeing the group play in the past two decades has usually been a letdown: tiny figures on a giant stadium stage playing old hits through a watery arena sound system. The Rolling Stones are a corporate brand, and everyone wants a piece: During the pre-show rehearsals in the film, the entire Clinton family and entourage climbs the stage to shake hands with the real legends.
The surprise is that "Shine a Light" reclaims the notion of a Stones concert, building slowly yet inexorably until it seems as if the entire movie theater is vibrating. (The film's playing on area IMAX
 screens, too; you may want to wear protective gear.)
The close quarters of the Beacon's stage brings the boys closer together - Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, drummer Charlie Watts (his sense of swing still the band's secret weapon), along with bassist Darryl Jones, keyboardist Chuck Leavell, a horn section, and backup singers. The band's within reach of each other again, and the camaraderie is palpable.
As Jagger is the ringmaster in front of the cameras, Scorsese is the maestro behind them, assembling a crew under Robert Richardson that reads like a Who's Who of award-winning cinematographers. The cameras swoop and dive, bank and rise, racing toward Jagger as he's dashing toward them. "Shine a Light" isn't one of Scorsese's most personal projects, but could any other director have turned classic rock into something so intensely kinetic?
And there's the music, which mixes expected chestnuts ("Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Tumbling Dice," "Start Me Up") with a few surprises ("Connection" from the album "Between the Buttons": That is digging deep) and which builds to a pitch of expert frenzy that not even the appearance of Christina Aguilera can dissipate. She's a guest vocalist on "Live With Me," and Jack White of the White Stripes turns up for "Loving Cup." Next to Buddy Guy, they're just babies, and when that venerable bluesman lights into Muddy Waters's "Champagne & Reefer," even Jagger seems like an awed student.
My one complaint is that the sound mix favors Mick's vocals over the sonic juggernaut of the band as a whole. If your favorite Stones album is "Exile on Main Street," in which the vocals are way down in the murk, this is distracting, but any karmic imbalance is righted when Keef takes the microphone for a lovely, warm slide-guitar trawl through "You Got the Silver." If Jagger remains the careerist of the band, Richards has become its living treasure: a benevolent rock wreck.
This isn't the "definitive" Stones documentary the way Scorsese's "No Direction Home" was for Dylan. Every so often, "Shine a Light" goes to the archival well, pulling up vintage interviews to provide a sense of the band's history, but these are a distraction from the immediacy of the concert. The Stones have always been about the moment rather than its meaning. They play the old songs not for nostalgia's sake but to insist the tunes still have impact - can still get you out of your seat dancing.
One clip's a hoot, though: Dick Cavett asking Jagger in 1972, "Can you picture yourself at age 60 doing what you do now?" He answers, "Yeah, easily," and the audience laughs because in 1972 old men did not rock. But Mick is serious, confident. He's in this thing for life.


By the early '80s, I was finally bored with the Rolling Stones. (I think those coy falsetto croons on ''Emotional Rescue'' did me in.) They were  and on some level always would be  the greatest rock & roll band in the world, but aside from ''Start Me Up,'' it was getting hard to pretend that the new songs could match the old ones. On stage, Mick Jagger was limber, but he no longer possessed the danger of a rock star  it was more like the energy of an aerobics instructor. But in Shine a Light , a crackling concert movie directed by Martin Scorsese, the Rolling Stones are now so old that they seem new again. They're no longer ''survivors,'' rocking out against time (yawn). That they're now in their 60s is, if anything, the rock & rolliest thing about them. The Stones aren't dangerous anymore, but they have a low-down dirty joy, and for a pack of skinny leather-faced geezers in tight pants, that's enough.
Shine a Light  opens with a barrage of footage in which Scorsese and the band dicker back and forth over the set list, and over whether Scorsese can use a swirly, mobile camera. It's all a bit too transatlantically cute, but then the Stones take the stage of the Beacon Theatre, the baroquely intimate Manhattan concert venue where the movie was shot, on two nights, in 2006. As they launch into ''Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' every chord comes at you in a magnificent, wall-blasting crunch, and the band looks terrifically snaky. Keith Richards now resembles a shrunken head with eyeliner, but his asylum-inmate grin tells you how happy he is to be up there. Mick Jagger, in a spangled shirt and black tuxedo jacket, lets you know the same thing with his hips. More than just vigorous, he is still, beneath those scarred-old-slaver creases, boyish  (he has a teenage torso), quivering and prancing like a rooster, a drag queen, a party monster, a devil.
Scorsese's camera work takes its cue from Mick's moves: It's nervous yet centered, leaping across the stage to gape at the singer's awesome propulsion. That set list is perhaps a little too  standard, from the jittery rush of ''Shattered'' to the grandeur of ''Tumbling Dice,'' from the two-chord monotony of ''Just My Imagination'' to the funky pomp of ''All Down the Line.'' There are three guest stars, and the film could have used more of them: Jack White blends soulfully with Mick on ''Loving Cup,'' Christina Aguilera shakes booty with him on ''Live With Me,'' and Buddy Guy helps to turn ''Champagne and Reefer'' into incendiary monster blues. Shine a Light  is a blistering parade of hot rocks, but it's never quite startling, like Stop Making Sense , or transcendent, like Scorsese's The Last Waltz . What it captures is a band that has figured out the best way to endure  by becoming eternal.

 As you scrutinize the aging bodies of the Rolling Stones in Martin Scorsese’s rip-roaring concert documentary “Shine a Light,” there is ample evidence that rock ’n’ roll may hold the secret of eternal vitality, if not eternal beauty.  Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, the quartet’s three skinny members,  certainly look their ages. But there is nothing stodgy about them. The strenuous rock ’n’ roll life has left them sinewy and lean, like longtime marathon runners. (The staid, above-it-all drummer, Charlie Watts, is the exception.)  Mr. Jagger’s lined face, with its deflated balloon lips, suggests a double exposure of Dorian Gray and his infamous portrait, at once defiantly youthful and creepily gaunt. The simian Mr. Richards, whose upper arm flesh has shriveled, resembles an old madam chewing over her secrets. As he plays, his lips dangling a cigarette, he leans back into his snarling guitar and a joyful grin spreads across his face. He could be the world’s happiest young older man: Peter Pan as a wizened Gypsy fortuneteller.  For the Rolling Stones appear supremely alive inside their giant, self-created rock ’n’ roll machine. The sheer pleasure of making music that keens and growls like a pack of ravenous alley cats is obviously what keeps them going. Why should they ever stop? At the heart of the gizmo, Mr. Jagger whirls, leaps, struts, wiggles his tiny hips and sashays around like an androgynous tart prowling a street corner at 3  a.m.  Ultimately the movie is Mr. Jagger’s show. If his long-running circus act is ridiculous when you analyze it, conjoined to the Stones’ music, it becomes a phenomenal high-wire exhibition of agility, stamina and cheek. He was 63 when the concert was filmed over two nights at the Beacon Theater in New York in the fall of 2006. From certain angles, when the blazing lights hit his face, he suggests an agitated zombie with a full head of hair. But if you squint until your vision blurs, he is the same tireless, taunting cock of the walk that he has always been.  The film, which used 18 cameras, many operated by eminent cinematographers, is an unabashedly reverent tribute to the Stones made in the same spirit as “The Last Waltz,” Mr. Scorsese’s elegiac 1978 movie of the Band’s farewell concert, and his more recent Bob Dylan biography, “No Direction Home.” That said, it is far less ambitious, and less overtly romantic.  This is a concert film with frills  that places you on the stage with the band and, with a finely trained eye, observes the musicians’ interactions  with one another and with the audience. The visual rhythms and unobtrusive editing reflect the contradictory status of the Stones as a majestic rock institution and a gang of down-and-dirty bad boys thumbing their noses at propriety while scooping up all the girls.  Although there is no frantic cutting back and forth, the cameras are continually on the move. As the movie artfully shifts its gaze, it helps you see much more than you could if you actually attended the concert. The audience is largely ignored.  Mr. Scorsese is a besotted rock ’n’ roll fan who wholeheartedly embraces its mythology. Its scruffy guitar heroes and roustabout rebel-prophets are the musical equivalents of the hotheads and outlaws who populate so many of his films. Almost every shot of “Shine a Light” conveys his excitement.  Prefaced by preconcert footage and interwoven with excerpts from television interviews from the Stones’ younger days,  going back to 1964, “Shine a Light” makes no attempt to explain the Stones or to tell their story. All it wants to do is to give you the best seat in the house and the best sound you could possibly hope for.  The program is a best-of selection that concentrates on Stones classics, including “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,”  “Shattered,”  “Some Girls,”  “Tumbling Dice,”  “Sympathy for the Devil,”  “Start Me Up” and “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.”  The only misfire is the quaint, quasi chamber-pop ballad “As Tears Go By,” a  hit for Marianne Faithfull in 1964, which sounds incongruous in Mr. Jagger’s parched delivery. Otherwise, the full-tilt rock concert roars along like a steam engine. A horn section, a keyboardist (Chuck Leavell), a bass guitarist (Darryl Jones) and three backup singers augment the band.  There are three special guests: in ascending order of interest, Jack White, who trades vocals with Mr. Jagger on “Loving Cup”;  Christina Aguilera, who shares the vocals on “Live With Me” and bestows demure pecks on the cheek to the musicians as she leaves the stage; and the great blues guitarist and singer Buddy Guy performing an old Muddy Waters song, “Champagne and Reefer.” (There is also the Clinton family in the audience, on hand to celebrate Bill Clinton’s 60th birthday.)  Like Muddy Waters, whom I saw in the Beacon Theater shortly before his death in 1983 at 70, Mr. Guy, 70 when “Shine a Light” was filmed, is a mighty blues presence, one who puts the Stones in historical perspective. Muddy Waters was an ominous force of raw blues aggression. Mr. Guy, though equally imposing, is a more benign, patriarchal figure.  Beside him, Mr. Jagger and company are mischievous bohemian whippersnappers churning up variations on their elders’ musical bedrock. It is  obviously a thrilling game to play into your 60s and beyond, if you’ve still got the juice. And the Stones have  the juice. But it is ultimately just a game.  “Shine a Light” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for drug references in the songs, and smoking.

The evolution of the Rolling Stones� reputation � from rock �n� roll�s bad boys to its most beloved and resilient granddaddies � is plain to see in �Shine a Light.� Martin Scorsese�s energetic account of a Stones concert at Gotham�s Beacon Theater in fall 2006 takes full advantage of heavy camera coverage and top-notch sound to create an invigorating musical trip down memory lane, as well as to provoke gentle musings on the wages of aging and the passage of time. Revenue from home entertainment markets will far surpass that from limited theatrical runs, which launch in early spring after its Berlin Film Festival world preem Thursday night.
An old hand at contempo music docs dating back to his editing chores on �Woodstock,� Scorsese doesn�t attempt anything nearly as ambitious here as he did with the Band on �The Last Waltz� or with the epic Dylan piece �No Direction Home.� Other than initial glimpses of the helmer planning the shoot and fretting over not having a song list in advance, �Shine a Light� doesn�t really bear much of the director�s imprint; it�s a proficient celebration of the band�s great songs, performing skills and durability, and perfectly enjoyable as such.
One hundred minutes of the two-hour film are devoted to the show itself -- more than 20 numbers, mostly Stones standards performed with some but not much variation on the way they�ve been played for up to 40 years or more. As the band�s concerts always have been, �Shine a Light� is mostly a Mick Jagger show, as a battery of great cinematographers (under the eye of lead d.p. Robert Richardson) keeps its cameras trained on him as he cavorts around the stage and penetrates the audience courtesy of a thrust platform; drummer Charlie Watts, guitarist Ronnie Wood and especially Keith Richards warrant occasional cutaways, as do the numerous side musicians, but the star is the star.
As he always has, Jagger puts on a terrific show. For the past two or three tours now, he�s inspired admiring comments on what great shape he�s in, about how inexhaustibly he dances and runs and, in large arenas, scampers to the furthest corners of the stages and catwalks and never seems to lose his breath. Even though the Beacon�s more constrained playing area limits his mobility somewhat, he still obviously has what it takes, in spite of a voice no longer capable of either the tenderness or the insinuation of its youth.
Sixty-three at the time of the concert, Jagger is not entirely impervious to the ravages of time, and the relentless closeup scrutiny could not be more revealing -- not only of his taut muscle tone and evidently fat-free physique, but of his deeply lined face; some low-angle shots are so tight you can examine the dark bridgework on the back of his front teeth.
The band members� endurance gains perspective through some wonderful interspersed clips and interview footage from earlier decades. Queried as to what question he is most frequently asked, a very young Jagger replies, �How long do you think you�re going to carry on singing?� In 1972, when Dick Cavett asks the star if he could imagine doing what he does at 60, Jagger immediately replies, �Easily.� Jagger�s and Richards� youthful drug busts are briefly covered, although any mention of Brian Jones is conveniently avoided. But for all the group�s early unsavory reputation, by far the predominant impression Jagger conveys in the archival stuff is one of overwhelming sweetness.
After chugging along nicely for an hour, pic kicks into high gear -- and pretty much remains there -- when Jagger duets with charismatic, boom-voiced bluesman Buddy Guy on a wild old Muddy Waters tune, �Champagne and Reefer.� Jagger takes a break when Richards winningly knocks off �You Got the Silver� and �Connection,� and singers Jack White III and Christina Aguilera come aboard for one duet apiece.
Scorsese doesn�t push the comparison at all, but Jagger�s hard-working British persona and his advancing years sometimes put one in mind of modest but equivalent events of yesteryear, when old-time English music hall performers would run their venerable acts out before their adoring same-age fans one more time. Jagger is hardly at such an advanced point but, notwithstanding the bodacious 20-something babes strategically lining the stage, it�s no secret that most of the audience are boomers like former President Clinton, who is conspicuously present celebrating his birthday with family.
Pic is dedicated to longtime music guru Ahmet Ertegun, who, at 83, took a bad fall at the recorded concert and died shortly thereafter. 


Mick Jagger 's most essential physical feature, according to Martin Scorsese : his bellystache. On the poster for Shine a Light , the big-shot director's Rolling Stones  concert film, Sir Mick is frozen in mid-song aerobics, his back arched, his half-shirt raised, that yawning navel and faint hairline more prominently showcased than his trademark trout mouth. And there's the hairline again in the movie, with Jagger stripped down to a black T-shirt, raising his arms in a game of taut-tummy peekaboo. Mick Jagger without a visible treasure trail is Sinatra with a cold, Picasso  without paint. And it's so crucial to Scorsese's ode-to-old-folk vision that the movie couldn't exist without it.
Shine a Light  is not only a vanity project for everyone involved, it's a total tongue bath. The backstory: Scorsese uses Stones anthems in his movies (Mean Streets , Goodfellas , Casino , The Departed ), so the World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band asked the Very Excellent Film Director if he'd like to film the Highest-Grossing Tour of All Time. He happily obliged, the Stones signed on as producers, and all parties settled on documenting the second of two 2006 Stones-headlined charity benefits celebrating Bill Clinton 's 60th birthday. Both performances took place in upper Broadway's Beacon Theatre , a gilded vaudeville hall with a capacity of 2,800.
In Stones proportions, this is tantamount to a basement show, so Shine a Light  comes packaged with the pretense of "intimacy." Not really a selling point: With Scorsese's super-zoom gear, the band could've been on the moon. What the cozy circumstances do provide is icon interaction: drummer Charlie Watts  trying to understand that even though he'd just met and greeted Clinton before the show, that period wasn't the official "meet-and-greet"; Hillary Clinton  making the Stones wait for her tardy mother; Keith Richards  whispering about how he should walk up to Bill and say, "Hey, Clinton. I'm Bushed!" Meanwhile, a frantic Scorsese irons out last-minute logistics, admonishing one crew member over a lighting setup that could potentially set Mick on fire. ("We can't burn  Mick Jagger!") These are Shine a Light 's first and best 15 minutes.
The remaining 100 or so consist of a fairly decent, mostly unsurprising Stones concert. If Altamont  was the Boston Massacre of rock shows, this Beacon date is a presidential-library dedication. In San Francisco, Hells Angels  and tripping hippies lined the stage; in Manhattan nearly 40 years later, the front row is full of gym members and raised camera-phones. So invariably they get the hits ("Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Shattered," "Satisfaction"), Keith singing like a hound dog in heat for "Connection," and Jack White  looking genuinely humbled to join Jagger for a superb rendition of "Loving Cup." Special guest Buddy Guy  is dapper, fitting, and possibly stoned; token female Christina Aguilera  is actually pretty good—holy shit, those pipes!
This is the band whose celluloid legacy is Gimme Shelter —if someone doesn't die, frankly, we're all a little suspicious. Scorsese does splice the 90-minute performance with some hilarious archival footage: the band costumed in grande dame makeup and dresses, allegations way back when that the Stones had already become "as controversial as the local vicar." Mostly, though, the excavated interviews are devices for groaningly trite foreshadowing. Gee whillikers, Mick, can you see yourself doing this at 60?  Mick: Yes, I can.  Cut to Jagger at 62, wiggling his preteen hips on a catwalk.
And so Shine a Light 's only point seems to be: You try this at 60 . One would hope that, after The Last Waltz  and No Direction Home , Scorsese might venture beyond making a glossy episode of Ripley's Believe It or Not . Nope, and we're not supposed to question it: Like the Stones, Marty's earned the right to coast, especially in his senior years.
Which brings us back to the bellystache. Mick's cheek crevices may look like they could swallow a truck, and his "Sympathy for the Devil" woooo-hooo  may now sound like a dying crow, but that bafflingly tight stomach is a wondrous relic, impressive for any man of any age. Shine a Light  is not.
