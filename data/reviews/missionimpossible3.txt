Poppycock is the bread and bloody butter of the superspy genre, and J.J. Abrams, the third director to helm this orgiastic action franchise (after Brian De Palma and John Woo), both recognizes that fact and milks it for all it's worth. M:i III
 fairly lactates ordnance, spurting out gaudy ribbons of flaming, high tech explosivity, and some of the most hyperkinetic action sequences since Woo's beloved Hong Kong was still a Crown colony, and public praise for Chow Yun-Fat would net a befuddled, blank stare. Such is progress. Abrams cut his teeth on television's Alias
 and Lost
, not to mention Felicity
 (an all-but-unrecognizable Keri Russell shows up here, too). Abrams works from a tight, serpentine script that never loses its rocket-sled forward motion � despite co-screenwriters, Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, grounding the proceedings in the realistic (so far as that goes) bedrock of Impossible Mission Force hotshot Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) personal life. As the film quickly reveals, Hunt has retired from fieldwork (aka "fun") and is preparing to marry fianc�e Julia (Monaghan), a nurse, and settle down a tad (aka "even more fun"). She believes he spends his days working as a Virginia traffic controller, so when he's called back to action by IMF honcho (Crudup) and sent to rescue proteg�e Lindsey (Russell) from the clutches of evil arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman, considerably upping the ante on his long-running "I have a mouthful of mashed potatoes" vocal technique, to fine, creepy effect), she's blas�, or unwitting, or, and I think this is the most likely (having just been insta-married and consummated in a giddy-fun hospital supply room sequence that serves well to humanize the too-often robotic Hunt character), she's sore and just wants to go back to bed. Meanwhile, in Berlin/Shanghai/Wherever-James Bond-Isn't, Hunt and his trusty team are fighting enemies within the gates of the IMF and Davian, who, flaunting a steely mien Ian Fleming would've greatly appreciated, does tremendously bad things with the air of a man making out his shopping list. From thereon out it's kiss-kiss-bang-bang all over the place, but never with less than a full measure of chaos. Abrams, to his credit, has made what may be the best of the lot when it comes to these impossibly, increasingly over-the-top films: Unlike its predecesors, M:i:III
 occasionally stops to catch its breath � hence the fascination with and fascinating depiction of Ethan Hunt's home life (who even surmised he might have one?) � and these smallish downtimes serve to ratchet up the surrounding fireballs all the more. Action connoisseurs will require defib after at least two of the set-pieces here, one involving a game of what can only be called Duck-Duck-Goose amidst a fluttery field of gargantuan windmills, and the other a smashingly well-edited battle between Hunt and the Bad Guys atop a doomed oceangoing causeway. It's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot. Summer has arrived.

         One-hour TV has been good to writer-director J.J. Abrams, good enough to get him the job of sustaining "Mission: Impossible," an action movie franchise that also began as one-hour TV. Is it any wonder that the Tom Cruise-starring "Mission: Impossible III" plays like two consecutive one-hour TV shows, one sort of standard, the other stocked with excitement?
 
  Fortunately for the film, and for us, the second hour is the best one, as "M:i:III," as it's known in studio shorthand, ramps up the pace and our level of involvement. Abrams, best known as the co-creator of "Alias" and "Lost," has come up with a solidly crafted entertainment, a diversion that really diverts once it gets down to business.
 


         






    Though "M:i:III's" first hour has its share of action sequences that must have cost the Earth, it can't completely shake a pro forma feeling, the idea that its main job is to set the scene for the next episode, as it were. In fact, it almost seems as if Abrams and co-writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (previously employed, as were many of "M:i:III's" creative personnel, on "Alias") are aware of this difficulty and have taken dramatic steps to counteract it.
 
  What they've done is open "M:i:III" with a flash-forward to the film's best, most nail-biting scene, a pivotal turning point in the action that certainly grabs our attention.
 
  The risk of starting with your best scene, of course, is that it makes a lot of what comes after seem weak by comparison. But the upside bet, that the sequence's intensity will keep audiences more or less patiently hooked through a big, long stretch of exposition, is what Abrams and company need to happen and what pretty much takes place.
 
  What makes the scene in question, a confrontation between Cruise's secret agent Ethan Hunt and the film's villain, extremely dangerous black marketeer Owen Davian, so effective is the picture-making performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the bad-guy role.
 
  Good-versus-evil films often rise or fall on the strength of the evildoer. In the Oscar-winning Hoffman, who isn't counting "Twister" when he says he's never done an action film before, "M:i:III" has a spectacular actor who delivers deadpan some of the most unnerving speeches in villainy's history. Hoffman is so proficient in this role that he just about overmatches Cruise and makes the wait until he speaks again in the second half of the film hard to endure with any patience.
 
  Most of the first hour, however, is concerned with establishing Cruise's Hunt as a master of the secret agent's dark arts as well as someone who thinks he can both save the world and have a normal romantic life with a partner ignorant of what he really does. Not quite.
 
  In fact, agent Hunt, who everyone thinks studies traffic patterns for the Department of Transportation, can't even get through his engagement party to the perky Julia ("Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's" Michelle Monaghan) without getting that familiar call about a mission he just might choose to accept.
 
  Hunt, it turns out, has been out of the hunt for a while, training new agents. His fetching star pupil, Lindsay, (is it only me, or does "Felicity's" Keri Russell look like Cruise's ex, Nicole Kidman?) has fallen into the thuggish hands of a group of Berlin bad boys. Hunt's handler Musgrave (Billy Crudup) and big boss John Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) think he's the guy to lead the rescue.
 
  Asking his fiancée to trust him, Hunt gathers his team of operatives (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q). He also learns about the mysterious and extremely unpleasant "rabbit's foot," an end-of-the-world-type weapon sometimes called "the anti-god." Not the kind of thing you'd want to fall into the wrong hands.
 
  In Berlin and during follow-up action in Vatican City, Hunt and his cohorts do all kinds of running and jumping but very little standing still. Encrypted microdots and explosive charges heedlessly implanted in people's heads do their worst, and more people jump through glass windows than you can imagine.
 
  It's not until the second hour, however, when the action moves to Shanghai, the deeply evil Owen Davian does something wretched and Hunt has 48 hours to accede to his demands, that we really begin to get involved in the story. Because Hoffman is so good at imparting offbeat but believable menace to his psychopathic character, the film's tension goes up a critical notch when he is on the scene.
 
  As for Cruise, the characters he plays can be difficult to humanize, but the man does his own impressive stunts, here including getting blown across a bridge by an explosion and jumping off an 80-foot building, and that has to count for something. His gaze may be as high-gloss as the high-tech machinery he fools around with, but under Abrams' proficient direction he gets the job done, and that is mission impossible enough for any man.

 In general release.   

The summer movie season always has an official beginning, even if it gets nudged back a little earlier each year (by 2016, we'll probably be watching The Mighty Thor IV  on President's Day). What it no longer has is any real end. The blossom-of-gasoline explosions, the crushed metal, the zippy seamless mutability of a world gone CGI, the heroes who, if not Superman, are always super men  what it all adds up to is Hollywood's endless summer, the ride that never stops.
And yet, once again, it begins. In Mission: Impossible III , Tom Cruise, as the no-fear, no-sweat IMF agent Ethan Hunt, scurries across a freeway bridge that's been blasted to smithereens and, using nothing but a machine gun, faces down a rogue fighter jet as it launches missiles right at him. He swings from one skyscraper to the next, skittering off the face of a glass pyramid and shooting a guard in mid-slide, landing at the roof's edge with a perfectly understated and in-control ''Okay!'' He sprints through the streets of Shanghai in a black T-shirt that makes him look like the fittest movie star ever and, more arrestingly, strolls quietly into empty rooms, gathering the film's tension around the wary, coiled urgency of his stare.
But wait. It's impossible to watch M:I-3  without asking: Do we still, you know, like Tom Cruise? Last year, the actor's tone-deaf offscreen antics appeared to break up his 20-year love affair with the media, and maybe the public, too. Yet his Great Gossip World Stumble wasn't really a violation of his star quality; it was that very quality taken to extremes. His big mistake on Oprah , for example, was using his springy energy and cocksure grin, his ''spontaneous'' jock-in-front-of-the-bedroom-mirror gestures, his whole spirit of jet-propelled certainty to proclaim romantic devotion  a feeling that by nature is quiet and reflective. Forgetting the lesson of Jerry Maguire  (''You complete me''), Cruise acted like a guy who completes himself. It's not that he gave a bad performance but that he gave the wrong performance at the wrong time.
M:I-3 , a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence, seems purposely designed to counteract that gaffe. This time, Agent Hunt is a bit of a softie  or, at least, a guy driven by devotion to the woman in his life. The film opens, rather startlingly, with our hero handcuffed to a chair, as the villain, played with casual slovenly menace by Philip Seymour Hoffman, points a gun at Hunt's bound-and-gagged wife (Michelle Monaghan) and promises to blow her brains out unless Hunt coughs up the Rabbit's Foot, the MacGuffin of a secret weapon that everyone is after. That creepy flash-forward sets the film's stakes  this time, in other words, it's personal  and Cruise, shaking off the karma of his Oprah  victory dance, plays Hunt with a keen and watchful intensity, as a knight of espionage doing what he does for love.
I'm happy to report that he also still likes to put on a rubber face. After an overly long exposition in which Hunt tries to rescue a kidnapped agent (Keri Russell) with a time-released micro-bomb implanted in her head, the real amusement begins, as Hunt and his team infiltrate Vatican City, where they're out to capture Owen Davian (Hoffman), an arms dealer who, for the right price, will sell any toxic weapon to any jihad. Ving Rhames' Luther is back, trading barbs about marriage with Hunt, and this time the crew includes surly Jonathan Rhys Meyers and slinky Maggie Q, who has a high-maintenance hauteur. Billy Crudup, as the point man back at headquarters, comes off like Cruise's pasty-faced academic doppelgänger.
The director, J.J. Abrams, is the co-creator and executive producer of Lost  and Alias , with their ropy narrative games, and for a good stretch he does a craftier job than Brian De Palma or John Woo did in the first two Mission: Impossible s of reviving the cornball clockwork pleasures of an ingenious trip-wire deception. As Hunt, on a computerized pulley, enters the Vatican, then poses as a priest, then puts on a latex mask to impersonate Davian, only to be forced at the last moment to fake a restroom coughing fit before his Davian voice is electronically activated, M:I-3  stoked my fondest memories of the original TV show's daisy-chain-of-technology suspense.
There's nothing old-fashioned, however, about Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. Most great actors, when handed the role of a blockbuster villain, will ham it up with style, but Hoffman makes Davian a grubby banal monster. When he warns Hunt that he'll find his wife or girlfriend and hurt her, really hurt her, he shakes his head in mock shame, as if making a sorrowful confession at his weekly meeting of Sadists Anonymous. I wish the second half of M:I-3  were as playfully tricky as the first half; the movie builds to some standard, if breathlessly timed, rescue heroics. Yet its central duel lingers: Hoffman the sullen misanthrope, itching to kill, and Cruise the agent-protector, saving the one he loves with aerobic earnestness.

 IT would be a stretch to say that Tom Cruise needs a hit. What this guy needs is an intervention, someone who can help the star once known as Tom Terrific return to the glory days, when the only things most of us really knew about him came from the boilerplate continually recycled in glossy magazines, sealing him in a bubble of blandness and mystery. In those days, we didn't know that inside the world's biggest movie draw lurked a reckless couch-jumper and heartless amateur pharmacologist. All we saw was a billion-dollar smile and a performer who risked life and limb, everything but his own true self, for our movie-going pleasure.  Until the ascendancy of George Clooney, the multi-hyphenated sex bomb (he walks, he talks, he smiles and he thinks!), few stars seemed to work harder than Mr. Cruise. The embodiment of the 1990's extreme ethos, he could be counted on to hang tougher than anyone else, whether doing his own stunts, spending a couple of years in production with Stanley Kubrick, or, as he did on more than one occasion, rescuing a civilian. Recently, though, all that extremeness has seemed, well, too extreme. And you have to wonder if the real mission in his newest film isn't the search for the damsel in distress or the hunt for the supervillain, but the resurrection of a screen attraction who has, of late, seemed a bit of a freak.  Aptly named or not, "Mission: Impossible III" may emerge as Mr. Cruise's latest box-office triumph, but it won't do him any favors when it comes to his public persona, since it appears to have been explicitly tailored to reflect his personal life, or at least its outward face. As he has in the first two "Mission" films, Mr. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of a stealth government agency, the Impossible Mission Force, who circumnavigates the world, blowing stuff up to wage battle against all manner of wickedness. Again he racks up miles (Berlin, Rome, Shanghai) and lights a few fuses, including that of a humorously decadent arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), but this time he also has a main squeeze, Julia (the welcome if badly used Michelle Monaghan).  The overlap between a star's private and public selves can add frisson to the screen, especially when the luminaries are Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but it can prove deleterious, especially when it reeks of public relations. "Mission: Impossible III" opens in medias res with a screaming match between Ethan, who's actually doing all the screaming, and Davian, who's holding a gun on a woman. "I am going to kill you!" Ethan shouts, limbs bound and tendons jumping. Alas, before that happens, the director J. J. Abrams, who wrote the script with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, backtracks to an engagement party, where, tendons at ease and smile blasting, Ethan is playing the aggressively jubilant fiancé, all but shrieking, "I am going to marry her!"  Viewer, he does. In between communiqués with his agency superiors (Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne), a rescue mission (hence, Keri Russell from "Felicity") and pyrotechnic larks with his newest team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers,  the decorative Hong Kong transplant Maggie Q), Ethan settles into domesticity, an endeavor interrupted when Julia is kidnapped by a malevolently aggrieved Davian. Mr. Hoffman isn't given all that much to do in the film, but what he does is choice. With a sneer in his voice and a lazy slouch that telegraphs world-weariness of the most misanthropic kind, he creates an ice-blooded creature who seems as if he would like nothing better than to destroy the earth, and with as much human suffering as possible. The too-few scenes of Mr. Hoffman going directly up against Mr. Cruise are particularly tasty.  Mr. Hoffman enlivens "Mission: Impossible III," which otherwise droops, done in both by the maudlin romance and by Mr. Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent — evident in his capacity as the television auteur behind "Alias" and "Lost" — to a larger canvas. The action remains consistently lackluster despite the usual frantic editing and several stunts that should pop off the screen. Typical of Mr. Abrams's difficulty in getting a grip on big-screen action is an extravagant feat that finds Ethan BASE-jumping  from one high-rise to another, a stunt that, because it was filmed mostly in extreme long shot and at night, might as well have been executed by Spider-Man's computer-generated avatar. A daytime battle on a bridge works better, largely because you can see Mr. Cruise panting amid the bullets and mayhem.  Although he slams into stationary objects with his customary zeal, the usually dependable Mr. Cruise is off his game here, sabotaged by the misguided attempt to shade his character with gray. The domestication of Ethan Hunt may have seemed like a good idea, a humanizing touch, perhaps, but it only bogs down the action. Worse, it turns a perfectly good franchise into a seriously strange vanity project, as the simpering brunette is swept into a new world by a dashing operative for a clandestine organization. Much like the man playing him, Ethan works only if you don't know anything about what makes him tick. Once upon a Hollywood time, the studios carefully protected their stars from the press and the public. Now the impossible mission, it seems, is protecting them from themselves.  "Mission: Impossible III" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is fairly bloodless violence.

The high-octane juice audiences crave in big-budget action films surges propulsively through "Mission: Impossible III," in large measure due to Tom Cruise, who seems determined to give a persuasive human impersonation of a Ferrari. He succeeds to an almost alarming degree. Debuting director J.J. Abrams orchestrates the billion-dollar franchise's requisite elements with skill and energy, delivering a picture that will serve its purpose in getting Paramount's -- and the industry's -- summer B.O. season off to a bang-up start.
Series devotees will be forced to nitpick when arguing the relative merits of this new picture versus the previous two. Brian De Palma's original, which came out a decade ago, featured more bravura visual flair despite its narrative confusion, while the hyper-kineticism of John Woo's 2000 follow-up wore out its welcome before the script concluded.
For all its far-fetched formulations, this new entry maintains more of a dramatic throughline and has the bonus of a villain played with unsparing meanness by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Initial installment in the series generated $454 million worldwide, while the second upped the kitty to $545 million; in both instances, revenues were notably higher overseas than domestically.
Opening teaser has Hoffman's Owen Davian with a gun to a young woman's head, promising to kill her unless Cruise's agent Ethan Hunt, bound to a nearby chair, reveals the whereabouts of a certain "rabbit's foot." The latter is a classic MacGuffin that will be sought and referred to throughout, as Hunt and his team zoom around the ever-diminishing world trying to eliminate the threat it represents.
With Lalo Schifrin's original TV theme music again setting the tone, and Michael Giacchino's new score falling adroitly in step behind it, action flips back to Virginia, where Ethan is enjoying an engagement party with fiancee Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and pals. As James Bond once did, Ethan has decided to settle down, his bride-to-be ignorant of his profession.
Domestic life lasts about five minutes, however, as Ethan has little choice but to accept a mission to rescue a woman he's trained (Keri Russell) who's been abducted in Berlin. Joining old mate Luther (Ving Rhames) and new recruits Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (Maggie Q), Ethan finds the young woman in a derelict factory virtually comatose. In a moment that is both dramatically ludicrous and the epitome of what the series is all about, Ethan zaps her with an adrenalin injection, whereupon she instantly snaps into action hero form, offing baddies left and right.
Explosive Berlin sequence is capped by a nocturnal helicopter battle staged amid a forest of wind turbines that looks suspiciously like the one in the desert outside Palm Springs.
A Stateside visit lasts just long enough for Ethan's boss (Laurence Fishburne) to inform him that Davian, a ruthless arms dealer engaged in selling weapons to North Korea and Arab terrorists, will be selling the "rabbit's foot" in Rome.
Italian interlude marks the film's high point, as it allows the Impossible Mission Force its greatest opportunity for subterfuge, surprise and disguise, none better than when Ethan, wearing a mask of Davian during a glittering Vatican function, steals the rabbit's foot and kidnaps the crook. Even captivity doesn't diminish Davian's insolence, however, and soon the tables are turned on Ethan and his crew in a spectacular ambush on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
Working with Abrams, scenarists Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, whose feature work on the lamentable "The Island" and "The Legend of Zorro" is perhaps balanced somewhat by their collaboration with their boss on "Alias," provide no surprises either when the unwitting Julia is finally put in extreme jeopardy, or when an outrageous Shanghai heist raises the meaning of "impossible" to new heights.
Job demands that Ethan swing like Tarzan between towering Shanghai skyscrapers, engage in a gun battle between speeding vehicles on the city's crowded streets and find an obscure location amid back alleys and canals where the final action is played out. Stunt work here is impressive, with kudos due vet stunt coordinator and second unit director Vic Armstrong.
This is a film in which the line between first and second units becomes invisible, so pervasive and dominant is the pulsating action and sense of movement. Even in the relatively quiet scenes, Abrams' direction is defined first by an impulse toward comprehensive coverage and second by a need to keep the camera on the prowl. Fortunately, this tendency is kept within bounds, so the picture doesn't go into numbing overdrive, but visual style is rather more utilitarian than that fashioned by either De Palma or Woo.
Cruise has bumped his intensity up a notch this time out, scorching through the picture in a manner that seems restrained only in comparison to his appearance on a certain television talkshow last year. Given how little his cohorts get to do, it's useful to have a screen presence like that of Rhames, or the newcomer sizzle of Hong Kong actress-model Maggie Q to score some immediate points; by contrast, the little-used Rhys Meyers gets lost in the shuffle.
Fishburne gets off a couple of good authority blasts, while Simon Pegg makes the most of his fleeting but key moments as a motor-mouthed agency analyst.
As for Hoffman, his stature as a superior actor invests his scenes with a special weight and interest. On the other hand, his involvement hasn't been fully exploited. That Hoffman, with his blond locks and moderate girth, bears a superficial resemblance to Gert Frobe, the actor who played Goldfinger, is brought to mind by a startling scene in which Ethan threateningly dangles Davian out of a private jet, a scene that recalls the manner of the villain's death in the third Bond film.
What the comparison points up is how this picture denies Hoffman a chance to fully express his character's personality, to show a little nuance, a mentality behind the evil, some humor or self-awareness behind the malevolence, or to toy with Ethan beyond the simple threat. If you have an actor like Hoffman on board, you'd think it would behoove the writers to cook up at least one big scene to let the man loose to really do his thing.
Production values are all supercharged in line with the tenor of the production. Locations effectively span the continents as well as the centuries, with Caserta, once again effectively doubling for the Vatican, representing the past, high-tech U.S. locales holding down the present and millennial Shanghai providing a look at the future.
