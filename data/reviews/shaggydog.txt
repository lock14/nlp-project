I�ve always had a soft spot in my heart for Disney�s original 1959 version of this �dog bites man bites dog� tale, thanks in large part to the retro-iconic status afforded the great Fred MacMurray, who parlayed the bewildered-but-lovable pop schtick better than anyone this side of my own father (this quite apart from the genius of Double Indemnity
). Adding the dreamy Annette Funicello to the mix (and let�s be honest �there�s no more apt adjective for Disney�s once and future Queen of the Beach) just made Disney�s first live-action family comedy feature all the more attractive. Nowadays the original seems all the more surreal, but viewed through the cinematic blinders of Generation X and beyond, the story of a lovesick teen morphing into a drooling mound of fluff was and is oh-so-apropos. Surprisingly, this remake, which shuffles the original teencentric storyline into one more focused on the harried workaday world of overachieving adults and misplaced familial priorities, is an above-average mouthful of cinematic kibble. As Los Angeles' star district attorney Dave Douglas, Allen mines his borderline insufferable Everyman quirkiness (thankfully going light in the grating, faux-folksy wisdom and attending homilies) and finds a suitable home for it in the shape of Shaggy, a �Tibetan Wonder Dog� who has been kidnapped from his monastery � where he divides his doggy days between Buddhist prayer sessions and pickup games of fetch with the young monks-in-training (a mixed blessing, the �peeing on the mandala� gag never arrived) � by evil pharmaceutical-company mouthpiece Dr. Kozak (Downey Jr/, in a heretofore untapped Snidely Whiplash mode). Allen�s D.A., who�s midway through prosecuting an Animal Liberation Front-type case and drawing the ire of his idealistic offspring (Grey, Breslin) and wife (Davis) because of it, is bitten by the mystical canine and promptly begins turning into a dog (as opposed to dawg) whenever someone sails a Frisbee or yells, �Sit!� I�ve never particularly warmed to Allen�s broad, Home Improvement
 line of comedy, but he does dog just fine. One particularly choice sequence has him discovering the overwhelming olfactory sense canines possess, and to the credit of the film�s multiple screenwriters (I counted five, but there were likely more) there�s nary a leg-hump in sight. Will the superlative D.A. and bad dad be reformed in time to see the error of his ways (and just as important, will he figure out that his only son would rather sing the lead in the school production of Grease
 than be a star tailback? Do dogs rock? They do indeed.) There are precious few surprises here, but parents will find director Robbins� breezy remake a painless affair and, judging by the yowls of laughter from the peanut gallery at the screening I attended, the kids will be barking all the way home. (Generally a good thing, considering the alternatives.)


It's silly. It's slapstick. It's even, in the view of the 8-year-old in the next seat, ''kinda stupid." But sometimes -- a chilly Saturday in March, say, with kids to amuse and when a stir-crazy parent needs a little amusement herself -- silly, slapstick, and kinda stupid is just what you need.
What ''The Shaggy Dog" feels like, more than anything, is an old-fashioned Disney movie -- hardly earth-shattering news, since it is 
a Disney movie, and a reworking of a couple of old Disney movies at that. Still, it's a pleasant surprise to find a movie that genuinely pitches itself at a child's level while also giving parents some real laughs. This is trickier than it seems, and something too many movies try to do with kid-pandering flatulence and adult-oriented innuendo.
Here, there's not a gas-passing joke in sight. The bathroom humor confines itself to one funny, if predictable, moment when Tim Allen, as a work-crazy district attorney who's turning into a dog, hesitates in front of a urinal and then lifts his leg.
Perhaps you want to know more about why 
he's turning into a dog. Don't trouble yourself too much: It involves ancient Tibetan secrets, a genetic mutation that's somehow transmitted virally, and, in a nice contemporary twist, an evil pharmaceutical company that's trying to exploit the virus to create a marketable form of eternal youth. (You not only turn into a dog; you reverse the usual dog-years formula and live seven years for every human year.) The plot is just twisty enough to keep things moving, and not so complex as to distract from the real point, which is to watch Allen panting and fetching and chasing cats and (spoiler alert!) learning to be a better husband and father.
Robert Downey Jr. makes a terrifically slick villain, whose simmering megalomania inevitably comes to a hilarious boil. There are a few unsettling moments in the biolab -- a failed experiment produces a bullfrog-bulldog hybrid that's just a little too creepy -- but mostly the filmmakers strike the right balance between suspense and laughter.
Kudos to Kristin Davis and Danny Glover, too, in the relatively straight roles of Allen's wife and boss. Like the more exuberantly funny stars, they know they're in a silly movie, but they never condescend to it. Therefore, neither do we. And that makes for a surprisingly good time.

         Going to this particular kennel for the fifth time since 1959, Disney trots out another incarnation of "The Shaggy Dog," its ever-hairy tale of man co-mingling with beast to his betterment. The original starred Tommy Kirk and Fred MacMurray, was one of the studio's first live-action comedies, and made lots of money.
 
  The most interesting (or peculiar) thing to be said of the furry franchise is that version three, a 1987 TV-movie called "The Return of the Shaggy Dog" and starring Gary Kroeger, is credited by Internet Movie Database as being co-written by "Crash's" Paul Haggis.
 


         






    The new version mines the original as well as the 1976 Dean Jones vehicle, "The Shaggy D.A.," with producer-star Tim Allen playing Deputy Dist. Atty. Dave Douglas, who's prosecuting a local teacher for allegedly setting a fire at the lab of pharmaceuticals giant Grant & Strickland (which looks suspiciously like the Pacific Design Center). Dave's teenage daughter Carly (Zena Grey) happens to be a student of the teacher and partakes in a demonstration opposing her dad.
 
  Grant & Strickland is, in fact, an evil entity run by Lance Strickland (Philip Baker Hall) and his greedy head scientist (Robert Downey Jr.). Although they've convinced everyone otherwise, the firm is conducting animal experiments trying to isolate the magic gene in a 300-year-old bearded collie procured from Tibet in a paramilitary operation that opens the movie. This search for the fountain of youth leaves in its wake a menagerie of mutated critters including a bulldog-bullfrog hybrid, a big snake with a furry tale and barking rodents and primates.
 
  In his naivete, the ambitious Dave works increasingly hard while losing touch with wife Rebecca (Kristin Davis), daughter Carly and son Josh (Spencer Breslin), who struggles to hide his appetite for show tunes over football.
 
  Meanwhile, Carly and her boyfriend (Shawn Pyfrom) break through the sieve-like security at Grant & Strickland and inadvertently liberate the ancient Tibetan canine.
 
  The dog bites Dave, who then intermittently and inconveniently morphs into an equally shaggy dog, which leads to mistaken identity, butt-sniffing jokes and a threat to the Douglas family's happiness. Naturally, Dave rediscovers his humanity, becoming a better husband and father as a pooch than he ever was as a man.
 
  The film's one lame attempt at relevance is the animal experimentation subplot, but rather than making anything resembling a point, the filmmakers simply use the created freaks of science as running sight gags. "The Shaggy Dog" is strictly for the very young who will find giggles in the anthropomorphic mash-ups and won't be too distracted by the predictably mawkish sitcom plot.
 
  Director Brian Robbins and the producers somehow coaxed Downey, Hall, Davis, Danny Glover and Jane Curtin aboard this otherwise cable-ready venture. The screenplay — which has "by committee" written all over it — is, not surprisingly, credited to five writers. Devoid of cleverness or anything approaching reinvention, the film relies on special effects and its cast, human and animal, for its limited appeal. Hopefully, it will be limited enough to spare us "Son of the Shaggy Dog."
 
 'The Shaggy Dog'
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for some mild rude humor   

To those who would growl that The Shaggy Dog  is yet another Disney squeeze toy in which Tim Allen embodies yet another dad who, through comic misadventure, learns to become a better husband and father, I bark this: Do not underestimate the pleasure of watching the fellow, dressed in the suit and tie of a sober deputy DA, plunge his head into a bowl of cereal and milk to eat his breakfast doggy-style. True, the kennel that produced the original Shaggy Dog  in 1959 and The Shaggy D.A.  in 1976 has devised a rather droolly and PC update on the notion of a man turned into man's best friend after being bitten by a magical pooch. (Here, dog-averse Allen prosecutes an animal activist for criminal activity against a science laboratory, only to learn on all fours how cruel and anti-PETA the place is.)
But the star, unleashed, is so energetic in his approximation of a bearded collie  his nose sniffing the air, his whole being (which toggles between human and canine form) overcome by the need to fetch any stick thrown  that his slobbery charm carries the picture. Besides, those allergic to lessons in improving family communication can draw pleasure from Robert Downey Jr., in prime crazypants form, as the lab's power-hungry evil genius.


Cross-breeding an old premise with some newfangled digital trickery, "The Shaggy Dog" reps the latest mutation of a franchise that Disney probably should have had spayed or neutered years ago. Trafficking in obvious anthropomorphic humor, with Tim Allen delivering a dubious master class in over-the-top canine behavior, this fur-fetched tale is bearable family viewing that will rake in moderate biz en route to the ancillary kennel.
A significant B.O. success in 1959, Disney's first live-action comedy -- filmed in black-and-white with Fred MacMurray, Jean Hagen and Tommy Kirk -- already has spawned a sequel (1976's "The Shaggy D.A.") and a number of small-screen retreads. Technically, helmer Brian Robbins' new version is the first bigscreen remake. While it boasts a few modern touches, particularly in its incorporation of animal experimentation as a plot device, the prevailing comic sensibility is earnestly old-fashioned and more than a little dog-eared.
Silly prologue introduces a beautiful 300-year-old bearded collie (played by credited canine Coal, last seen on USA's "Monk") who scientists, hoping to discover the secret of eternal life, have abducted from a Tibetan monastery. Heading the operation is the sinister Dr. Kozak (a tamped-down Robert Downey Jr.), who has publicly denied allegations that his firm, Grant & Strictland, has performed experiments on animals. (The interior of the laboratory, featuring an impressive CGI-rendered menagerie of caged mutants, tells another story.)
Rising star prosecutor Dave Douglas (Allen), is trying the case against schoolteacher Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard), who stands accused of torching Grant & Strictland's headquarters. On the homefront, Dave's workaholism has left him little time for his loving wife Rebecca ("Sex and the City's" Kristin Davis), eager-to-please son Josh (Spencer Breslin) and sullen teenage daughter Carly (Zena Grey).
Soon after a chance encounter with the purloined pooch, Dave begins to exhibit curious dog-like tendencies, i.e. scratching himself, shaking himself dry after a shower and involuntarily fetching thrown sticks. (Thankfully, the drinking-from-the-toilet gag appears to have ended up on the cutting-room floor.) Eventually he morphs into a full-blown collie, retaining all his thoughts and none of his motor skills, leaving him hard-pressed to explain himself to his family, much less figure out Kozak's evil plan.
From there, the script (by husband-and-wife writing team the Wibberleys, Geoff Rodkey, Jack Amiel and Michael Begler) alternates between predictable and occasionally crass sight gags -- the preponderance of jokes about butt-sniffing make this the most anally fixated family movie in a while. Though some might be amused initially by the sight of the actor lifting his leg over a urinal, or dropping to all fours to chase a cat, the physical shtick is mostly uninspired and borderline creepy. More effective are scenes of sentimental bonding between doggy Dave and his unsuspecting wife and kids.
Conveniently, Dave reverts back to human form in his sleep. The dog makes infinitely better company, although Allen's jokey interior monologue, dubbed over Coal's expressions and movements in the style of "Homeward Bound," is more of a presence than it needs to be.
Dave's affliction, of course, is fate's roundabout way of teaching him to appreciate his family. If "The Shaggy Dog" never gets off the ground as a comedy, its occasional lump-in-the-throat moments are almost effortlessly achieved, thanks to strong work from Davis and Breslin in particular. Few will resist the image of the collie greeting Rebecca at their anniversary dinner with a bouquet of roses in his mouth.
Raucous courtroom scenes, in which Dave's socially awkward transformation most often announces itself, are enlivened by Jane Curtin in a too-rare bigscreen appearance as an amusingly outraged judge. Danny Glover and Philip Baker Hall also appear briefly as Dave's and Kozak's bosses, respectively, while Craig Kilborn puts over an unfunny turn as an obnoxious neighbor.
Animatronic effects by Stan Winston Studios make persuasive use of a digital double whose actions were matched with those of the actual dog, while the lack of a truly satisfying metamorphosis sequence from Allen to Coal (or vice versa) is compensated for via some clever camerawork.
Musical choices are as obvious and on-the-nose as the humor: Baha Men's "Who Let the Dogs Out?" is still as headache-inducing as it was six years ago.

After being bitten by a 300-year-old Buddhist canine that U.S. government commandos have snatched from Tibet  (this is what it takes to make a dog movie exportable?), a workaholic family man and inveterate pooch-hater (Tim Allen ) starts scratching behind the ears, hearing high-pitched sounds, slurping milk from the cereal bowl, and licking his wife's face. And the grown-up viewer starts checking his watch. Disney 's tried-and-true slapstick material (est. 1959) is here given a heinously unimaginative interpretation by five screenwriters and a director who manages to squander the gifts of an absurdly overqualified supporting cast. The bit players (Robert Downey Jr. , Danny Glover , Jane Curtin , Philip Baker Hall ) barely clock screen time with the Bearded Collie, which may be co-producer Allen's way of protecting his sleepy performance from competition. Where the original film generously reflected Cold War angst and budding youth-culture dissent, this dad-in-the-doghouse tract could've been made in 1995 . . . or 1985. My eight-year-old nephew sat nearly silent throughout, so when he says he had fun, he must be talking about the treats.
