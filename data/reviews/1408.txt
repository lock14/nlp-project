Based on a Stephen King short story that bears a great resemblance to the author�s famous spooky-hotel novel-cum-movie, The Shining
, 1408
 ranks as one of the best King adaptations for the screen. However, it�s not the script (by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski) that deserves most of the credit. 1408
 is Cusack and Swedish-born director H�fstr�m�s (Derailed
) movie all the way. Sure, the fact that Cusack appeared just a few years ago in Identity
, another horror hotel movie, raised fears that the actor might have overdosed on one too many Gideon Bibles. Yet 1408
 becomes a true showcase for the actor, who appears in every scene � the majority of them as the lone actor in the frame apart from the devilishly shape-shifting shenanigans of the titular room in New York City�s Dolphin Hotel. The other characters are secondary at best: Jackson and Shalhoub have one scene each, and McCormack, in the role of the wife, has only a few more than that. Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a cynical writer (a common King protagonist) who authors books about the supernatural world � books that both exploit the public�s fascination with the occult and debunk our naive sentiments. Enslin appears to have abandoned the novelistic ambitions of his earlier professional years in favor of writing guidebooks such as the one he is currently researching: Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms
, a follow-up to Ten Haunted Houses
. He sets his sights on Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, a room so notorious that no guests are allowed entry. Enslin wheedles the hotel manager (Jackson), who adds to the known lore of the five suicides that have occurred in the room by recounting the 50-some-odd other strange occurrences, such as the maid who got locked in the bathroom and gouged out her own eyes. It�s an �evil fucking room,� he says succinctly, in this PG-13�s rare instance of profanity. Once inside the room, director H�fstr�m goes to work, marshaling the suite�s various ghosts and frights to bring Enslin�s cynicism to its knees. The effects are exceedingly well done, while never giving the appearance � which is all too common these days � of being a techno wizard�s wet dream. The movie appeals to an old-fashioned sense of horror, a psychologically based creep-out that again differs from the current horror trend of randomly occurring torture porn. And I guarantee that you will never again be able to hear Karen Carpenter croon �We�ve Only Just Begun� � one of the film�s signature motifs � without letting loose an involuntary shudder of fear.


Has John Cusack ever been more adorably out of his mind than when he's going bonkers on a minibar in "1408"? His aggravation is understandable. A little Samuel L. Jackson is somewhere inside. (It brings me great joy thinking there's a little Samuel L. Jackson inside anything. He brings mediocre things to life.) But for an explanation of why Jackson is there or why Cusack thinks he is, anyway, you'll have to see this moderately spooky thriller for yourself -- and, afterward , feel free to report your findings. That's the kind of thriller "1408" is: If you feel like solving a puzzle, it might be fun. Otherwise, it's a lot of consonants and no vowels.
Still, the movie is another opportunity for Cusack to shield emotional vulnerability in a cynic's armor. Taken from a Stephen King short story, "1408" has the actor playing Michael Enslin , a talented novelist turned myth-busting hack, who cranks out survival guides to haunted locations. His latest project is a mysterious room in a grand Manhattan hotel where over the years 56 people have died, many of natural causes. This is according to the peeved manager, whom Jackson plays with a two-tone goatee. He smoothly insists Michael find a different room, but Michael refuses. So it's off to 1408 , where the bathroom faucet gushes scalding water, the window conspires to crush his hand, and the clock radio plays the Carpenters's "We've Only Just Begun" whenever it pleases. Eventually, the room ropes Michael's wife (Mary McCormack ) and his dead daughter (Jasmine Jessica Anthony ) into the mayhem.
These are but a few of the tricks designed to kill Michael or drive him crazy. Jackson tells us the room is evil, and the production team comes up with a set that does seem elastically spiteful. Room 1408 is glacial one minute, deluged the next, a post-apocalyptic ruin later on.
Directed by Mikael Hafstrom , whose previous movie was the ludicrous Clive Owen- Jennifer Aniston noir "Derailed ," "1408" is a movie very much predicated on the delicate balance between perception and reality. Is Michael trapped in a kind of guilty purgatory? The hotel floor plan is in the shape of a big black "H," meaning he's trapped somewhere else ("You are here," says the map). The script is credited to Matt Greenberg and the team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ("Ed Wood," "Man on the Moon"), and it has a sense of humor generous enough to keep Cusack in on the joke. The soothing cadences of the hotel operator are a hilarious insult to Michael's erupting panic.
"1408" is actually a more respectable, more entertaining star-driven head-game than Sandra Bullock's "Premonition " or Jim Carrey's "The Number 23 ." Cusack is very much at home in the movie's blend of comedy and fright. Make that: would-be fright. The problem with this movie is that it feels too much like a joke rather than a true work of suspense. After "The Sopranos " series finale, no ending can seem too abrupt, and yet this one is a shrug. Hafstrom conjures a wonderful anticipatory mood of dread in the first 30 minutes then he blows it to stylish smithereens.
Maybe I was thinking fondly of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining," which is the most famous instance of a hotel-bound Stephen King story turned into a film. "1408" lacks the lunging horror and dramatic architecture to be remotely comparable. Yet watching Cusack go maniacal in a fancy hotel of his own, I did think once or twice, "Heeeere's Johnny!"


         "Hotels are unusually creepy places," says Mike Enslin (John Cusack), who writes cheesy tour guides of haunted places, into his voice recorder a few minutes into his stay in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. "How many people have slept here before me? How many of them were sick? How many lost their minds? How many died?"
 
 In this particular case, it's 56 — not that Enslin is counting. He came to the Dolphin to debunk a claim of paranormal evil and instead finds himself trying to talk himself down from the ledge overlooking panic. Based on a Stephen King story by the same name, "1408" doesn't exactly boast the most airtight premise ever devised by man (or King) but a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way once the scary stuff gets going.
 


         






   Mikael Håfström avoids excessive gore in favor of creepy psychological horror, mining midnight terrors like the fear of isolation, alienation, loneliness, anonymity and strange surroundings — a primal fear of hotel rooms, basically, with which the average solitary business traveler (Enslin is one himself, in a way) may already be intimately acquainted. It's the reason, as he explains in an impromptu deconstruction of the room's décor, for the studied banality of the average guest suite, with its fox hunt paintings and comfy chairs. These things are meant to reassure us that we've been here before, that we belong here, that we're safe.
 
 Naturally, Enslin is anything but. His métier notwithstanding, he's a skeptic with a haunted past. Having abandoned a promising literary career for a more cynical if not necessarily more lucrative one, as well as a wife (Mary McCormack), after the death of their young daughter, Enslin lives alone in an ocean-side apartment in Southern California, where he spends most of his time drinking and surfing. Returning home after a run-of-the-mill trip to a bump-in-the-night bed and breakfast, he gets an anonymous postcard in the mail suggesting a stay in Room 1408. Who sent it we never know — though we do soon learn that New York is the place where all of Enslin's ghosts and demons reside.
 
 It takes some doing to get Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), the longtime manager of the Dolphin, to allow Enslin to stay there, but in the end he has no choice. (Legal reasons.) Enslin checks into the room that has been closed to the public for decades despite Olin's warnings that nobody ever lasts more than an hour. Soon enough we find out why.
 
 The room's first prank, a bit involving a clock radio, a sentimental love song put to excellent ironic use and pillow chocolates, is the scariest as well as the funniest. Considering that "1408" is essentially a movie about the relationship between a man and a room, the ever more squinty and solid Cusack seems a felicitous casting choice. What evil hotel suite worth its salt could resist trying to rattle that supercilious squint?
 
 The plot falters on some shaky logic — for instance, if the hotel opened in 1914 and the room was later closed to visitors sometime in the 1980s, how is it that only 56 people have died in it? The ending feels tacked-on and pointless, but Enslin's horror hour is suitably creepy and Kingsian.
 
 In the grand scheme of things, the Dolphin Hotel is no Overlook, but it's no cheesy slaughter motel either.

Want to see something scary? Take a look at the box office grosses of the recent wave of horror films. If the numbers are any indication, audiences are fast getting burned-out on jack-in-the-box slashers, on torture turned into a booby-trapped game of jolt and squirm. Of course, these things come in cycles, which means that it's not necessarily the fault of the films themselves. Eli Roth's Hostel: Part II , despite its lousy opening weekend, is an authentic real-world creep show  better, if anything, than its predecessor. As for 1408 , it may have the title of a bad Christopher Columbus biopic, but it's a deft Stephen King freak-out. These two unabashed genre films do what they're meant to do. Screamingly, teasingly, they bring the pain.
In the sado-perv fearfest that is Hostel: Part II , respectable businessmen from all over the world make bids, on their BlackBerries and office computers, to purchase a freshly abducted American college girl. The top bidder will travel to Slovakia, where, in a network of dungeons hidden behind the thick corroded walls of an abandoned factory, he'll torture and murder the victim he has bought. What's creepiest about this scenario is the way it mirrors the online auctions that have become big business in the sex-trafficking industry. Roth isn't just whipping up a blood-smeared megaplex hellhole. He's asking: In a world of global depravity, where anyone can buy anything, is homicide-for-kicks-for-the-right-price really such a huge leap?
This time, the hedonistic victims are a trio of women. Two are played by name actresses (Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo), which only adds to the horror of seeing them bound in chains, screaming like stuck pigs as they're assaulted by blades and power tools. The innovation is that Roth now invites us to enter the sick-puppy view of those homicide-porn clients (the disarmingly ordinary Richard Burgi and Roger Bart). Part II  delivers the gore: a disgusting ''erotic'' blood shower; a buzz-saw mishap that's so gruesome yet, in its awful way, so credible you'll choke on your giggles. Roth is ruled by B-movie reflexes, but what lifts him out of the gross-out ghetto is his Maileresque fascination with the killer inside.
1408  doesn't pretend to be a seismic Stephen King movie, like Carrie  or The Shining . It's more like the nifty King-on-film scare machines of the '80s, such as Christine  or Cujo . Based on a short story, it stars John Cusack as a writer of travel books devoted to ''haunted'' inns (he knows that they're all scams). For research, he checks into room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan. No one, it's said, can survive that room, and what happens to Cusack is a roller coaster of a head trip in which the forces of evil come from inside, as well as outside, his brain. I won't give away more, except to say that where Hostel: Part II  provides up-to-the-minute shivers, 1408  is reassuringly old-school gothic. We'll see if that, at least, can scare up an audience. 1408 : B ; Hostel: Part II :

 A troubled writer, a haunted hotel room — who else but Stephen King? In "1408," adapted from a 2002 short story by Mr. King, John Cusack is the hack who drags his emotional baggage to Room 1408 of the  Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan, accommodations  whose history of grisly deaths demands investigation. Once there, he learns that checking out might not be an option.  Directed by Mikael Hafstrom with old-fashioned restraint and a stylish use of intense close-ups, "1408" is more psychological thriller than outright horror. Recycling many of Mr. King's familiar motifs, the story traps its protagonist in an apparitional loop filled with repeating signs of occult infestation: a Carpenters song bursting from a bedside radio, paintings that tilt and transform. The movie is most effective in its early scenes of prickly menace, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the haunted hotel in "The Shining"), its old-world creepiness is exactly right.  Mr. King is a writer who excels at finding malevolence in the mundane, and consequently his tortured Everymen have often been more successful on the small screen than on the large. Mr. Cusack's character descends directly from David Soul's in "Salem's Lot": scarred heroes who have lost their faith. In Mr. Cusack's case, it's waiting for him behind the door of 1408.  "1408" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The hero faces fire, flood, vertigo and assorted supernatural entities.

One can only imagine, with horror, what would happen if a guest asked for more towels at the Hotel Dolphin, the locale of the freakily scary "1408," yet another film that puts "hostile" back in hostelry. While it's certainly been the season for hotel/motel movies -- see "Bug," "Vacancy" and "Sympathy" -- helmer Mikael ("Derailed") Hafstrom's take on single-room occupancy is the most cinematically ambitious. For star John Cusack, it's a perfect fit and, with a little massaging from the Weinstein Co., should emerge as one of the surprise hits of the summer.
An unnerving movie that here and there succumbs to fits of effects mania, "1408" actually manages to combine elements of Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit," "The Poseidon Adventure" and the Carpenters -- making them all more terrifying than they already are. More remarkably, perhaps, "1408" refuses to embrace the fashionable elements of torture porn, a la "Hostel: Part II," that are currently cutting a bloody swath through the horror genre, relying largely on psychological terror to impart the sense of someone possibly going mad, and taking the viewer along.
In Stephen King's merrily warped world, the most damning thing a character can do is ignore the supernatural writing on the wall. As seen in novels like "The Shining" or short stories like "The Road Virus Heads North," a character who displays hubris or cynicism, or simply fails to acknowledge life's mysteries, usually consigns himself to the author's pile of victims.
Mike Enslin (Cusack), therefore, is the perfect foil for King the moral instructor: A successful writer of popular books about haunted houses and possessed graveyards, Mike scoffs at anything remotely paranormal, but, having lost a daughter to illness, he doesn't quite believe in anything else, either. Cusack's charmingly iconoclastic persona helps set Mike up for a lesson in metaphysical manners. By the end of "1408," he will definitely believe in something.
The Dolphin (which, coincidentally or not, is also the name of a haunted hotel in the Haruki Murakami novel "Dance Dance Dance") is a luxury establishment on Manhattan's East Side, a first-rate joint save for one room. Determined to debunk the mystery of room 1408, Mike has to threaten a lawsuit to gain access to the room, where he knows four people have met unlikely ends. What he doesn't know is that 50-odd people have actually died there, some of apparently natural causes, although the room also once drove a maid to gouge out her eyes. The official diagnosis? It's an evil room, says Dolphin manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson).
But Mike is undeterred and, once he gets in, finds the room has bizarre shape-shifting properties. While Hafstrom eventually turns 1408 into a frozen tomb that cracks and shifts like an arctic ice shelf, it's in the smaller details that the creepiness escalates: The closeup of the old-fashioned lock mechanism as Mike inserts the key -- the room itself having refused any security improvements -- is a little gem of tension-building.
Cusack, given plenty of room to ruminate about his plight and the state of his accommodations, is funny, tragic and moving -- as if things weren't bad enough, his dead daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony) pays him a visit, while his estranged wife Lily (Mary McCormack) tries to help him via a computer screen that's been taken over by the resident incubus. Make that inn-cubus. "1408" is a creepshow that delivers, although viewers may have second thoughts about ordering room service.
Production values, spearheaded by Benoit Delhomme's excellent cinematography, are indispensable in this tale of illusion and delusion.

There was every reason going in to believe that 1408 , based on a Stephen King  short story, would be nothing but a Shining  rip-off made on the cheap. The screenwriters are collectively responsible for Reign of Fire , Problem Child 3 ,  and Agent Cody Banks  ; John Cusack  has proven he's not above taking a gig for the paycheck; and director Mikael H sole English-language film was the dreadful Derailed . Yet it's a surprisingly effective movie. Cusack plays a former novelist who, after the death of his daughter, abandons all interest in the living to focus on the dead, writing travel guides with titles like 10 Haunted Hotels . But in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel  in Manhattan, he finds his first truly "evil fucking room." The horror wouldn't work without Cusack, who makes what could have been a rote acting exerciseBe tough! Now angry! Now defensively funny! a cathartic ritual instead.
