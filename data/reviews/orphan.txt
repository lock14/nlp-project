To the Hellspawn ranks of Damien, Rosemary’s baby, Rhoda “Bad Seed’’ Penmark, and the Olsen twins, let us now add the title character of “Orphan.’’ Her name is Esther, which sounds about as scary as your bubbe, but as played by the very serious young actress Isabelle Fuhrman she’s a prim little psycho with a taste for cutlery and an accent out of downtown Transylvania. The movie has already come under heavy fire from the national adoption community as the absolute worst PR a foster child could ever have, and correctly so: As a concept, “Orphan’’ is reprehensible. As a movie, it’s entertaining trash  - a good bad movie you can shriek at, laugh at, or both.
Vera Farmiga should probably poke her agent with a stick, though, since she played the exact same distressed-mom role in 2007’s “Joshua.’’ Here she’s Kate Coleman, still reeling from the stillbirth of her third child (given the full nightmare treatment in the film’s opening scenes; if you have pregnancy anxieties, stay away) and trying hard not to become a full-time wineaholic.
Husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) has just the idea to cheer her up: Let’s adopt! Off they go to the Sisters of No Background Check Necessary Orphanage, where bringing home a spooky Eastern European 9-year-old is as easy as a visit to the puppy mill. Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder! In a wimple!) will personally rubber-stamp the adoption papers for you.
The Colemans’ children, no fools they, realize that Esther is not the poised Victorian china doll she appears to be. Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) sulks in his treehouse and uses pigeons for paintball practice, while little Max (Aryana Engineer), who’s partially deaf, pads faithfully after her new sibling even after the blood starts to flow. Or, in this case, the nun hits the hammer.
Director Jaume Collet-Serra (he did the recent “House of Wax’’ remake) moves “Orphan’’ along efficiently, doling out a “boo!’’ shot every few minutes with mechanical professionalism. (He also overuses the dreaded reverse-gotcha-non-boo shot, in which you’re primed to jump but nothing appears.) Fuhrman is eerily deadpan as little Esther, and she gives the character a residual sadness under the craziness under the politeness, as though a lifetime of disappointment would make anyone a little homicidal.
The best part of “Orphan’’  - besides giggling at the doomy obviousness of the dialogue and the never-ending revelations of just how eeeevil Esther might be  - is watching Kate slowly grow from a spineless noodle to a ticked-off ubermom as her suspicions are slowly confirmed. Her husband ridicules her, as does her psychiatrist (Margo Martindale), but no matter: Paranoia just makes Kate stronger.
Actually, the best part of “Orphan’’ is the outstandingly lunatic plot twist that kicks in just as you’re checking your watch and hoping they’ll wrap things up. This development  - I’d love to tell you, but you wouldn’t believe me  - boosts the movie into overdrive for a final 20 minutes of happy, disreputable mayhem. You come out high on the fumes of the film’s preposterousness, glad to be back in the real world, and looking for a child to hug.

To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), the 9-year-old orphan adopted by the Colemans (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), who are out to put their tragic memories of a stillborn baby behind them. Pigtailed and freckled, Esther dresses like a frumpy Victorian doll, and she's got a thousand-yard stare that could freeze rain. Worse than that, she was born in Russia and speaks with an accent that gets milked, in scene after scene, for its corny, junior-assassin malevolence. It's as if the movie were saying, ''Forget all the Hollywood devil children you've seen  this one's from the land of Putin !'' Esther loses no time smashing animals, then people, with rocks and hammers, and even then she's just getting started. She's so extreme, in fact, that Orphan  isn't scary  it's garish and plodding. Farmiga, as the recovering-alcoholic mother, brings the movie a dash of neurotic tension, but the only moments of audience catharsis emerge out of unintended hilarity, such as the creepily incongruous scene in which Esther tarts herself up into an evil baby-beauty-pageant Lolita.


 Actors have to eat like the rest of us, if evidently not as much, but you still have to wonder how the independent film mainstays Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ended up wading through “Orphan” and, for the most part, not laughing. He plays the father, John, an architect, and she plays the mother, Kate, who doesn’t do much of anything. Together they watch over Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and a younger girl, Max (Aryana Engineer), in one of those sprawling houses that always looks spotless even if no one ever drags a mop across its polished floors, which makes you wonder who will swab up the inevitable pooling blood.  And the blood it  does spill, though not nearly fast enough. The age of the economic fright flick is apparently a thing of the past: the first “Dracula” clocked in at about 75 minutes, the original “Cat People” runs some 73 minutes, while “Night of the Living Dead” changed horror forever in just over 90 freaky minutes. “Orphan,” by contrast, comes in at a padded 2 hours 2 minutes, which is absurd for a dopey “boo” movie — as in creaking sound plus abrupt visual cut equals “boo!” — with a comically contrived premise. That premise is Esther (the very self-possessed Isabelle Fuhrman), a Russian orphan with a penetrating gaze whom John and Kate adopt with surprising swiftness and the wary blessings of a nun (C C H Pounder).  The new child is meant to take the place of the stillborn fetus who haunts Kate, though alas only metaphorically, a conceit that implies that adoptees are like replacement puppies. Whatever the case, Esther is more of a she-wolf, what with an exotic accent and predatory habits that suggest she worked for Spectre  back in the motherland before landing in America as an undercover devil doll.  She has her evil way with the family, as expected, preying first on the other children. The young actors are very good and perform their parts more convincingly than Ms. Farmiga and especially Mr. Sarsgaard, but there’s something creepy, and not pleasurably so, about watching children pantomime so much malice and fear.  Like some other directors who started out in commercials and music video, Jaume Collet-Serra (“House of Wax”) appears to have lost a sense of narrative economy during his move from the small screen to the big. It’s doubtful that he’s entirely to blame — as unlived in as the house, the overly produced movie looks like an advertisement for the luxury car Kate drives — though you have to wonder about some of his camera choices. For one putatively crucial scene that finds Kate squawking into a phone, Mr. Collet-Serra inexplicably had someone point the camera toward the floor, a shift in focus that led me to think we were meant to find a clue in the carpeting when, really, all that had gone missing was a point of view.  “Orphan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloody violence, much of it directed at the young characters, and some kitchen-counter coitus interruptus.

Teasingly enjoyable rubbish through the first hour, "Orphan" becomes genuine trash during its protracted second half. This "Bad Seed" rehash about an adopted Russian girl who deliberately foments mayhem in an upscale family is intent on getting a rise out of the audience and does so, but mostly in the wrong ways. Fine actors, fancy production values and attempts to invest horror with extra depth create a classy patina, and the ultimate "reveal" is a lulu not to be tipped off, but it's all just too absurd to keep riding with it. Adoption advocates are justifiably fearful about pic's possibly negative impact on their business, but Warner Bros. has little to fear from this eminently promotable item where its coffers are concerned.
For a while, it looks as though writer David Leslie Johnson, working from a story by Alex Mace, and director Jaume Collet-Serra, whose unnecessary 2005 "House of Wax" didn't deny him a second shot with WB and producer Joel Silver, might actually be able to add a fresh layer of credible emotion and psychology to a predictable premise. Nightmarish opening depicts the feverish recollection by Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) of the stillborn birth of her third child, an event that soon leads to her decision to adopt a girl.
Kate has some issues, notably a drinking problem that prevented her from rescuing her little daughter Max (the adorable Aryana Engineer) from an accident that caused her to go deaf. Latter condition is worked into the story in a number of clever ways -- much hinges on things that are overheard, lips that are read, signs that are picked up, or not -- and is a key factor in the relationship the girl has with her mother and her new "sister."
Kate and passively supportive husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), the source of whose obviously lucrative income is never mentioned, find their chosen one at an orphanage run by Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), who can barely contain her surprise and delight at Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) being taken off her hands. A prim, polite 9-year-old who paints well and speaks beautifully, albeit with a slight accent, the sallow-faced, black-haired Esther dresses like Little Bo Peep, carries a tattered Bible and warns, "I guess I'm different." Like any good liberal mom, Kate replies, "Well, there's nothing wrong with being different, you know." Right.
Ensconced in the family's Architectural Digest home on a hill (pic was shot in snowy Quebec), Esther makes an ally of little Max but is loathed by cusping adolescent son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett). By contrast, her attitude about John is ambiguous; the newcomer has an uncanny knack of turning up whenever the parents try to keep their sex life in gear, first (and hilariously) in the kitchen, then in bed, where the thunder-frightened girl sidles up against the naked man just moments after he's been thunderclapping his wife.
Things go from weird to worse until something entirely untoward happens to sweet Sister Abigail. The percolating air of expectation and nervous humor gets sucked right out of the movie when the first act of explicit violence takes place, turning the film from a rollicking bit of leg-pulling to a grim exercise in methodically applied terror, as Esther goes on a carefully plotted rampage.
Although Kate, who becomes ostracized from her family for being the only one who believes the girl is evil, aggressively tries to unearth the little devil's birth and early life records, Esther's dirty secret is well kept until the big moment, which ranks with "The Crying Game" in its surprise quotient. This juices the film for a few minutes, but then follow not one, not two but three battles to the death, each more preposterous than the last. It's also one of those movies in which a revolver is fired seven times.
Through it all, the cast members perform heroically, as if believing they're actually in a good film. Farmiga expresses a hundred nuances of love, rage, self-confidence and doubt as the beleaguered wife and mother, while Sarsgaard smoothly invests the outwardly mild husband with hints of a very slippery character. All three kids are terrific. Fuhrman makes Esther calmly beyond reproach even when faced with monumental evidence against her, and has the requisite great evil eye. Bennett is highly sympathetic as the encroached-upon boy who picks up on Esther's bad vibes long before anyone else, while Engineer is a dream.
Tech credits are strong, and John Ottman's off-center score helps significantly in creating a sense of unease.

In this decidedly amoral thriller, Vera Farmiga  gives a jittery, complex performance as Kate, a high-strung Connecticut mother of two who has a breakdown after losing her third child in labor. Despite the fact that she is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for less than a year, and despite the fact that she nearly let her son drown when she was drunk, Kate and her rich architect husband (Peter Sarsgaard ) easily win permission to adopt a replacement child. Enter nine-year-old Esther (well-played by 11-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman ), a Russian-born beauty whose sweet exterior hides devilish intent. Soon, Esther is doing away with her perceived enemies, a process that includes death-by-hammer and death-by-carving-knife. If director Jaume Collet-Serra  (House of Wax ), screenwriter David Leslie Johnson , and their big-time co-producers, Joel Silver  and Leonardo DiCaprio , have any qualms about explicitly showing a little girl slaughtering people or attempting to seduce a grown man or pointing a gun at the head of her six-year-old stepsister (the wonderful Aryana Engineer), they have clearly worked through them (as have, apparently, the young actors respective parents). Silly, overlong, and bloody as hell, Orphan  is likely to turn a sweet profit, money that Leo, the renowned do-gooder, should spend with shame.
