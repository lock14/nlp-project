         Though he's directed only four features and is little known in this country, a case could be made for writer-director Jacques Audiard as France's most compelling, most visceral and exciting filmmaker. A case his latest film, the forceful "The Beat That My Heart Skipped," does nothing but strengthen.
 
  Like Audiard's three previous features — "Read My Lips," "A Self-Made Hero" and "See How They Fall" — "The Beat" starts with familiar material and increases the emotional intensity without sacrificing credibility. Not surprising given his legacy (he's the son of prolific French screenwriter Michel Audiard), the filmmaker has a gift for psychological acuity and empathy with not always pleasant characters. His films start out seeming like genre exercises, but, as co-writer Tonino Benacquista says in the press notes, "Jacques Audiard's pictures are never genre movies."
 


         






    In "The Beat," Audiard has set himself a greater challenge than usual. He has remade "Fingers," James Toback's pretentious 1978 cult item, a film that even Audiard admits contains "a certain amount of cinematic posturing that ages badly."
 
  What "Fingers" also contains is a useful plot hook: a frenetic young man (Harvey Keitel in the original) who can't choose between his father's mobster life and his mother's world of the concert piano. As Benacquista accurately reports, "We kept Toback's initial premise but changed everything else."
 
  What has resulted is a blistering film you feel in the pit of your stomach, a jumpy, edgy piece of work that thrusts us into a personal maelstrom so tortured and intense, the emotions could be spread with a knife. With Romain Duris indelible as protagonist Tom, "The Beat" cuts to the bone emotionally and refuses to flinch.
 
  Enhancing this intensity are a pair of related decisions made by Audiard and his cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine. Determined to avoid what he called "over-insistent jump cutting," Audiard decided that every scene should be done in long, single-shot takes. And making those shots hand-held and almost always from Tom's point of view ensures that, in Fontaine's words, "the camera is an organic part of the character. It has to feel the same things that Tom feels, experience the things he experiences."
 
  Hot-tempered and arrogant, Tom tells people he's in real estate, but as we follow his day-to-day activities, it's apparent he's more of a thug than anything else. More black leather jacket than tie (though he wears them both), Tom is willing to do whatever it takes, from planting rats in an apartment to physically intimidating squatters, to make a profit on Paris buildings he and his partners covet.
 
  In all this Tom is very much his father's son. Robert (Niels Arestrup, whose yellow jacket is a conscious hommage to the original) is a failing loan shark who no longer has the strength to collect what's owed him. Tom hates serving as the old man's muscle, but, with a father who is a virtuoso at inducing guilt, he can never manage to refuse.
 
  Tom's late mother, it turns out, was another kind of virtuoso, a concert pianist with considerable gifts. One day, completely by chance, Tom catches sight of his mother's former agent. It's clear from their conversation that once upon a time Tom was a pianist with promise, so much so that the agent leaves him with an open invitation to audition when he feels ready.
 
  Tom, it turns out, has played hardly at all for the last 10 years. But rather than brush the invite aside, he feels it take hold of him like a powerful drug, the dream of the person he might have been haunting him like a ghost. He hires a young Vietnamese woman (Linh-Dan Pham), so new to Paris she speaks no French, to help tutor him, watches Horowitz videos at night, practices, dreams, and continues to beat people up.
 
  The heart of "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is the uncomfortable, unavoidable conflict between these two halves of Tom, both powerful, both genuinely him. As his lessons force him deeper into a double life, his unbalanced nature gets more and more high-strung, gradually resembling nothing so much as an exaggerated, violent version of a classic artistic temperament.
 
  Almost imperceptibly, we start to feel that Tom's passion for the piano also symbolizes a desire to escape his life that he refuses to acknowledge. Gradually, the questions the film asks move from, Will he succeed as a virtuoso? to include, What will the effort to get there do to him? For what makes "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" exceptional is that it turns out to be as much about a human being in terrible crisis as it is about someone with a thwarted dream.

The Beat That My Heart Skipped  is a small-scale milestone  the first European remake of an American art film  and part of what makes it a dizzy, gratifying experience is that the filmmaker, Jacques Audiard (Read My Lips ), clearly updated James Toback's Fingers  because he couldn't get it out of his head. In the 1978 original, Harvey Keitel, bopping through the New York streets in a fringed white scarf, was a Mob collector who was also a classical pianist  a violent stud-dandy torn between the gutter and the angels. The film was enraptured pulp, held together by Toback's obsession with the thin line between seduction and force.
In The Beat That My Heart Skipped , the hero now works the sleazier side of Paris real estate, but the real change is one of tone. Where Keitel's short-fused jukebox art punk lived in thrall to his divided nature, Thomas (Romain Duris), with his reflective handsomeness, is a man out to rescue himself from the sewer he's tumbled into. The Beat That My Heart Skipped  lacks the screw-loose existential vibrance of Fingers , yet it teases out a romantic underside to the original I never quite knew was there.

 As he walks - no, make that hurdles - through the electrifying French film "The Beat That My Heart Skipped," the young actor Romain Duris brings to mind another dirty-sexy guy who once vaulted through the movies with barely restrained frenzy. Mr. Duris, who wears a black leather jacket in the film, along with the ankle boots of a tango dancer or a pimp, is playing the character inhabited by Harvey Keitel nearly three decades ago in a cinematic wack job called "Fingers." Summoned as if from a fever dream by the writer and director James Toback, "Fingers" doesn't just get under your skin; it slithers.  Like that film, "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. Mr. Keitel's character, Jimmy, given to wearing a black leather jacket and a white silk scarf, plays Bach in his apartment on a baby grand piano; the rest of the time he's a crude hustler of women (a Toback signature) and a reluctant fixer for his monstrous father. In Jacques Audiard's superb remake, which improves on the original significantly, investing it with aesthetic grandeur and emotional depth, Jimmy is now Thomas (Mr. Duris), a real estate entrepreneur with an unlikely dream. As in the original film, music soothes but doesn't fully tame him.  Mr. Audiard, whose films include "A Self-Made Hero" and the art-house favorite "Read My Lips," is a master of indirection. His lyrically titled new film opens with a quiet, uneasy scene that makes sense only in retrospect. Two men sit in a small, claustrophobic room, cigarette smoke curling through the soft light. One of the men is talking about his father, while the other just listens, impassive as a stone. The angry words pouring from the talker soon mellow as he reveals that his father, who once drove him crazy, had been reduced by illness, flipping the parent-child dynamic. "I nursed him like a baby," he says. The listener, whom we will shortly come to know as Thomas, our doubtful hero, barely stirs, even when asked, "Do you believe in God?"  There are all kinds of gods in "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" - old gods, dead gods, gods of power and sex and money, and the fallen god Thomas calls Father. An unshaven wreck with a body gone soft with age and fat, Robert (Niels Arestrup) has seen better if not necessarily kinder days. He trolls the murkier depths of real estate, but he's no longer on his game and leans on his son to close his dirty deals. As he sits across from Thomas in a cafe talking about his hot new girlfriend, dressed in a pale yellow suit jacket with greasy hair curling over the collar, he looks lost, condemned. The disgust in Thomas's face as he sits across from this ruined spectacle is matched only by the unmistakable love.  That's getting ahead of the story, which takes off like a shot. After that quiet, meditative prologue about fathers and sons, the film cuts to Thomas and two others, who are soon entering a derelict building under the cover of night. There, he and the other men, both dressed in suits, release bags filled with squealing rats. The rats are part of the arsenal of weapons that the three use to force poor people from valuable properties. In this dark place, where terrified immigrants scramble for their belongings, moaning and illuminated by the glare of flashlights, we are a long way from tenderness, and from discussions of faith and fealty. Thomas takes in the chaos with seeming disinterest, more like a bystander to a crime than its perpetrator.  Part psychological thriller, part love story (men and women, parents and children), "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is also about what it takes to escape our own prisons. Written by Mr. Audiard and Tonino Benacquista, with whom he wrote "Read My Lips," the film uses its pulpy milieu as a way to sneak in a meditation on what makes us human, including the ties that choke. Soon after the rats run wild, Robert asks Thomas to help him with a debtor. Thomas secures the money, but only after Robert has been beaten and his son has exacted bloody vengeance. In the film's most chilling exchange, Robert pockets the cash and coolly says, "Not so hard, was it?" No wonder Thomas looks like a man on the run.  One of the outrageous delights of "Fingers" is its far-fetched plot, which is a shotgun marriage between a seedy crime fiction and the story of a classical musician, topped off by some 1970's sleaze. Mr. Audiard keeps Mr. Toback's improbable premise, but fills it out with scenes of Thomas struggling to perfect the Bach toccata he plans to play for an audition. Working with the talented cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine, who beautifully mixes gaudy color with the noir shadows, Mr. Audiard keeps close tabs on Thomas; there are moments when it looks as if the camera is about to jump on the character's shoulder or burrow into his ear. Getting inside Thomas's head turns out to be key because, as it happens, "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is also an existential mystery.  In time, this restless man, whose spidery fingers and jangling legs constantly tap out separate rhythms, will find harmony. He will embark on an affair with a married woman (Aure Atika) and take lessons with a concert pianist (Linh-Dan Pham), relationships that will pull him out of his prison and just maybe deliver him. Along the way there will be violence, some ugly enough to make your heart skip, and sex that might do the same. Mostly, though, there will be beautiful images, strong emotions and the joy found watching a movie aimed straight at the heart and head. Summertime is meant to be the season of the adult moviegoer's discontent, one reason "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is more than just a well-timed gift - it's essential viewing.

"The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is a cocky French remake of James Toback's 1978 cult underworld character study "Fingers" that stands reasonably well on its own as an urgent, updated genre meditation on nurture vs. nature. Writer-director Jacques Audiard's update on the violent moral tale of an urban go-getter torn between his father's life as a thug and the urge to honor his mother's memory by becoming a concert pianist adds little to the original. Nevertheless, well-made pic injected some much-needed adrenaline into a Berlin competition generally considered in need of a boost and will do solid midrange fest, arthouse and homevid biz with American auds new to the story as well as Toback disciples.
Pic successfully retools the story from 1970s New York to contempo Paris and imbues it with an appealingly muscular surface gloss. Pumping music through ever-present silver headphones, the confident Tom (Romain Duris) works with Fabrice (Jonathan Zaccai) and Sami (Gilles Cohen) on ever-changing real estate deals of questionable legality. In his spare time, Tom collects debts for his dissipated father, Robert (Niels Arestrup).
The tightly coiled young man has an impressive talent for persuasive violence he seems barely able to control. Obviously uncomfortable with this aspect of his personality, a chance meeting with the promoter who worked with his concert pianist mother inspires Tom to renew long-dormant aspirations to follow in her footsteps.
As the day of a crucial audition approaches, Tom juggles intense lessons under the watchful eye of Vietnamese-Chinese instructor Miao-Lin (Linh-Dan Pham), a passionate affair with Fabrice's wife Aline (Aure Atika) and an increasingly violent conflict between Robert and the Russian mobster Minskov (Anton Yakovlev).
Fans of Toback's long-elusive yet highly regarded original, which starred Harvey Keitel and Michael V. Gazzo as son and father, will have a high time comparing the numerous updates, similarities and differences that range from the headphones that replace Keitel's enormous boom box to the hideous yellow sports jacket favored by dad and the inevitable absence of American football star Jim Brown as a cryptic crime lord. Yet Audiard and novelist co-scripter Tonino Benacquista, who copped France's screenplay Cesar for "Read My Lips," are nearly undone by their honest ambition: Some 17 minutes longer than the occasionally aimless original, the mix of elements from "Glengarry Glen Ross" and the pruning of the father-son relationship in favor of more piano practice scenes with Miao-Lin and the whole Fabrice/Aline subplot is flab the picture doesn't need.
Still, Duris' charismatic perf will keep auds transfixed. With his hair-trigger temper and compulsive fingering of the air, he confidently channels Keitel's nervous energy, but in appearance seems more akin to Robert De Niro's explosive Johnny Boy in "Mean Streets."
Stephane Fontaine's nervous, claustrophobic camera serves the material well. Composer Alexandre Desplat supplements the Bach and pulsing contempo tunes with a lushly foreboding score.
Pic goes out in Gaul March 23.



The borders of James Toback 's fiery, absurd, and often unendurable movie universe are defined by his obsessions (pussy, classical music, pop, Dostoyevsky, scam-level crime, gambling) and by his narcissistic desire to foreground his impulses. Which makes Jacques Audiard 's retread of Fingers  Toback's 1978 debut and the most stirring of the man's self-imploding projectsa perverse act of auteurship. We're several steps removed from the scenario's original bipolar heat, of course, leaving us wondering with The Beat That My Heart Skipped  whose monomanias these are, and why we should care.
Toback's hero, personified in a nerve-wracking epileptic performance by Harvey Keitel , is a classical pianist obsessed with '50s girl group pop, a rabid extrovert so pent up he's liable to explode like a canned firework, an intense romantic who works collecting from his loan shark father's welshers. The sleek, Rupert Everett ine heartthrob Romain Duris  attempts to fill out the role's contradictions, which are narrowed down to taking piano lessons, listening to techno, rousting squatters from his boss's buildings, and enduring his mini-mobster dad (Niels Arestrup ). Audiard's primary goal, it seems, was to render Toback's espresso-jacked nuttiness cool, introverted, and romantic. The almost completely nonverbal relationship between Duris's cool cat and the Chinese piano coach he finds (Linh-Dan Pham ) feels extraneous, but it's fascinating enough to warrant an entire, more patient movie. As it is, Duris, capable and dull, is no Keitel, 2005 is no 1978, and The Beat That My Heart Skipped  is no Fingers .
