There are certain dogs -- and they've been around a few blocks -- that know one trick to perfection. They also know they can throw it down for the thousandth time and you'll be right there with the Snausages . You don't even hate them for it.
Hugh Grant is that old dog. "Music and Lyrics" is that trick. Actually, "Kibbles 'n Bits" might make a better title for this charming bit of Valentine's Day boilerplate. It's so unoriginal yet so adorable that your own leg may start kicking reflexively as the movie scratches you in the sweet spot.
The writer-director is Marc Lawrence, who made long plane flights safe for Sandra Bullock with his "Miss Congeniality" screenplays and "Two Weeks Notice," the latter of which he directed and which also starred Grant. "Music and Lyrics" substitutes Drew Barrymore for Bullock, increasing the ditz factor and the chance the whole thing might collapse like a mistimed souffle.
It doesn't, though. After a rocky early scene in which Barrymore seems shrill and unfocus ed, "Music and Lyrics" settles into breezy cruising gear, and the two stars snap together surprisingly well. Grant plays Alex Fletcher, a one-time one-hit-wonder from the '80s whose singing partner went on to megastardom and left Alex doing appearances at Knott's Berry Farm .
The movie starts off with the group's hit video from 1984: a stupid ditty called "Pop Goes My Heart" that sets the right tone of no-cal parody while sticking in your ear like tar. Then we meet the modern Alex: older, shaggier, content in his vastly diminished expectations but with a noodgy agent (Brad Garrett) who wants a bigger 10 percent. The agent puts Alex together with a baby Top 40 sexpot named Cora (Haley Bennett) -- think Shakira crossed with Tweety Bird -- who loved his music back then and wants him to write her a song within 36 hours and sing it as a duet.
A comeback beckons. Problem: Alex can't write lyrics. Enter: Barrymore as his substitute plant-watering lady, Sophie Fisher, who just happens to have a knack for wordplay. Exit: The audience's suspension of disbelief.
So why are we still here? Because the two are so darned cute
 together. Grant and Barrymore have complimentary stammers: He does his wicked, self-effacing, post-Divine Brown cynicism thing (and Lawrence's dialogue is just sharp enough to put it over), while she settles down and gives us a believable girl-woman with a smidgen of attention-deficit disorder.
"Music and Lyrics" indulges in byplay about Sophie's sister (Kristen Johnson), a power-mom with a high school crush on Alex, and it throws in a nonsensical subplot about a professor (Campbell Scott, fleeting and embarrassed) who wrote Sophie into a novel and left her a blocked mess.
Mostly, though, the movie hunkers down for a long all-nighter of song composition, during which the stars run through their respective tricks and win each other and us over. The movie insists Alex and Sophie get together physically (and discreetly), but that's just icing on a tasty pre-fab cake. They have
 to get together so they can then break apart so Grant can perform the hem-haw public apology scene he's apparently required by the terms of his work visa to do in every single movie in which he appears. Except here he sings
 it.
The last act of "Music and Lyrics" is increasingly mechanical; the charm fades even as you're willing it to stick around. Newcomer Bennett gets a few laughs as the pop-tart torn between Buddha and booty-shaking, though, and the song Alex and Sophie compose, which has sounded like the worst sort of Grammy swill in the making, turns out to be pretty good (if not good enough to make up for the windy dialogue about classic pop songcraft.)
In the end, the movie's just the kind of enjoyably empty-headed fluff it celebrates and mocks. It sits up, it begs, eventually it plays dead, and still you want to pat it on the head. It's a good dog.


As Hugh Grant ages, something is becoming clear: The actor's most compelling  attribute is not his floppy forelock but the vein of charming self-loathing that has always been pulsing under his masterfully mussed-up hair. The posh stuttering, the artful dishevelment, the way his characters blink and back away (from women, certainly, but also from men as chums or colleagues) are all gestures of a very cultivated, very British embarrassment. Oh, dear God, am I really an Oxford graduate mucking about as a movie star?  his pouting mouth pleads, while magazine editors put him on Sexiest Man lists. How can you stand me when I'm such a delightfully horrid, selfish man?  his characters flirt.
Grant is game for a new level of meta-ha-ha, joke's-on-me in Music and Lyrics . But with Drew Barrymore as his costar, this bland, light romantic comedy insists on keeping the commentary as disposable as one of the '80s gumball tunes Grant used to swivel to as Alex Fletcher, a washed-up '80s pop star. Alex had some hits in a Wham!-like band called PoP, and it shows: Grant readily embraces bad hair (that of a has-been desperately trying to accommodate the '00s), bad tight shirts, and a cute spritz of eau de failure. Having split with his PoP partner  the lyric-writing half of the duo, who went on to even greater success  Alex makes his dough singing solo on the nostalgia circuit (high school reunions, amusement parks). The faintly idiotic gigs are enough to bankroll a modestly comfortable, unattached, showbiz-adjacent lifestyle on Manhattan's Upper West Side. (Writer-director Marc Lawrence, who did nice stuff with Grant and Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice , is himself a denizen, happiest when shooting in the real nabe.)
What Grant really needs is a female costar who can bust him on his shtick  Bullock was particularly well matched, Renée Zellweger cracked the code in her Bridget Jones  outings, Emma Thompson could do it with one blink of an eye. What the star gets in Barrymore as Sophie Fisher, instead, is a sunshiny spirit who always appears in need of a little TLC herself  a huggable, guileless woman who, from all vibes, wouldn't ever cross paths with an early-MTV fossil like this guy. Sophie traipses into Alex's life on the rebound from a bad relationship, working as a freelance plant waterer  what a great NYC profession!  just as Alex is at a loss for words. A highly marketed teen-pop goddess named Cora (unknown dewdrop Haley Bennett, channeling Shakira/Madonna) is interested in commissioning a song from the old dude because he's, like, soooo retro. Alex has music  but no lyrics.
It turns out that Sophie  what are the odds?  has a natural flair with phrases, and even while overwatering the plants, the lines she noodles out loud are applauded as if writ by Betty Comden. (Or at least we agree to believe that fantasy; the song she ''writes'' with Alex, conjured in fact by Fountains of Wayne's own wit Adam Schlesinger, is as intentionally, perfectly forgettable as a stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike.) And so a new songwriting team is born, emotional wounds are healed for both Alex and Sophie, and romance dances in the air.
Grant's talents, though, are cramped by his costar's geniality and youth. Alex becomes a little more gallant and protective than he needs to, and that big-brotherliness makes the part where he and Sophie spend a grown-up night together a little unintentionallyskeevy. Grant does best when he's got a womanly costar closer to his emotional and chronological age who smacks him around a bit when he gets too  fluttery. Or at least laughs affectionately at that hate-me-please thing he does.
Music and Lyrics  includes some great throwback faux music videos from PoP's wonder years (it turns out Grant is an admirable pelvis thruster who'd probably do anything for a shot at boy-band-parody glory on SNL ), as well as a bilious suggestion for a reality TV show pitting '80s pop has-beens against one another in a celebrity boxing match. But really, Grant is at his most comfortably uncomfortable when he's playing present-day Alex, trotting out the old songs and the old moves in shows for moisturizer-challenged women in their 40s, while their bored, flabby husbands look on, thoroughly unthreatened.

 Playing Alex Fletcher, a semi-washed-up British pop star whose heyday was in the haircut-band ’80s, Hugh Grant, one of the stars of “Music and Lyrics,” delivers a reasonably convincing impersonation of, well, Hugh Grant. He stammers articulately, ducks his head coyly to one side and ornaments his line readings with cute qualifications and digressions, as in: “We have tonight, the morning and just the teeniest little bit of the afternoon.”  There is no shame in this kind of consistency or predictability. After all, the movie stars of old delighted their fans by inhabiting the same basic persona in role after role. Before Hugh Grant, for instance there was another Grant, Cary, who was always reliably himself and who enjoyed the good fortune of working with some of Hollywood’s finest directors, from Howard Hawks to Alfred Hitchcock.  “Music and Lyrics,” in contrast, is the type of modern Hollywood production that aspires to nothing more than the competent dispensing of mild amusement and easy emotion. The writer and director, Marc  Lawrence (“Two Weeks Notice,” also starring Mr. Grant), shows some imagination as he parodies the music-video styles of various eras, and he contrives a bit of novelty in making the movie’s central couple creative partners as well as potential lovers. Mr. Grant’s opposite number is Drew Barrymore, playing a lovable flake named Sophie who arrives at Alex’s Upper West Side apartment and sticks around to help him make beautiful music.  Or, at least, a hummable, ticky-tacky pop tune. Alex, who earns a decent if humiliating living performing his old hits (and semi-sexy dance moves) on the fairground and class-reunion circuit, has a shot at a comeback, thanks to a teenage pop-tart named, of all things, Cora (Haley Bennett).  Ms. Bennett, a newcomer to feature films, shows herself to be a deft enough comedian, sending up both the vacuous spirituality and the teasing hypersexuality of Cora’s real-life counterparts. With her blissed-out face and wriggling body, Cora puts the booty in Buddhism.  She also commissions a song from Alex, but his gift is strictly for melodic clichés. The verbal kind come naturally to Sophie, who was an aspiring writer before being dumped by her professor, a famous novelist (suavely played by Campbell Scott) who has unflatteringly modeled a character in his latest best seller on her.  Sophie’s collaboration with Alex hits the expected snags and misunderstandings, and while there is not much chemistry between Mr. Grant and Ms. Barrymore, they are professional enough to work with the movie’s conceit while sending flickers of idiosyncratic charm off the screen.  Mr. Grant is at his best when he allows a hard glint of caddish narcissism to peek through his easy flirtatiousness, something he did in “About a Boy” and “American Dreamz.” There is not quite enough of that here, nor enough of the anarchic loopiness that Ms. Barrymore brought to roles opposite Adam Sandler in “The Wedding Singer” and “50 First Dates.”  Apart from Cora, the secondary characters are more perfunctory than inspired, though Kristen Johnston has some juicy, unhinged moments as Sophie’s older sister, whose fan-crush on Alex has hardly cooled since the mid-’80s, despite  marriage and motherhood.  The songs, composed for the film by Adam Schlesinger, are affectionate tributes to the MTV fodder of the present and (mostly) the past. They provide sweet reminders of the giddy delight of good bad popular music.  The movie itself can’t quite pull off  the same kind of trick. “Way Back Into Love,” the fruit of Alex and Sophie’s partnership, is both synthetic and sincere, a credible facsimile of the kind of throwaway hit that worms its way into your head and, decades later, refuses to worm its way out. “You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar, and we danced! Touch me baby,   tainted love. Relax! Everybody wants to rule the ...”  Sorry, what were we talking about? I must be getting old. Oh right, “Music and Lyrics.” A movie with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. Play a few bars on the Casio and maybe I’ll remember.  “Music and Lyrics” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual situations and naughty language. Parents of a certain age who see it with their children may have to endure some uncomfortable questions about the ’80s. 

The amusement inherent in watching Hugh Grant play a washed-up '80s boy-band pop star angling for a comeback provides "Music and Lyrics" with its catchy hook. Sitcommy in structure and execution, this very mainstream romance between an aging, commitment-phobic pretty-boy and an emotionally wounded gal whose songwriting collaboration takes on a personal dimension, offers few surprises. But its pep, agreeable performances and appealing central conceit will profitably put this Warner Bros. Valentine's Day romantic comedy over with women and couples seeking a nice diversion.
Just now beginning to show some signs of encroaching middle age, Grant is ideally cast as Alex Fletcher, who, as shown in a zippy musicvid-style opener, came out on the short end of music superstardom after his megaband split up a generation before. Self-deprecating without bitterness, Alex is remarkably well adjusted as he sucks it up to play the occasional gig at school reunions and amusement parks.
All the same, this "happy has-been" is delighted to learn that reigning pop queen Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) wants her childhood heartthrob to write a duet, to be called "Way Back Into Love," for them to sing at Madison Square Garden in a few days. Alex needs a lyricist pronto and, in a very lame meet-cute, seizes upon the first person at hand, his "plant lady," Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), to collaborate with him day and night until they've produced a surefire hit.
More noticeably than with Alex, the bloom is off Sophie's rose. She's withdrawn into deepest insecurity after having been burned by her former English professor, Sloan Cates (Campbell Scott), whose bestselling novel mercilessly vivisects a character plainly based on Sophie. For no reason other than to create a little artificial drama, Sophie initially resists Alex's entreaties, but they soon click so thoroughly that they are making music both at and beneath Alex's piano.
More excited by Sophie's new romance than is Sophie herself is her sister Rhonda, boisterously played by marvelously deep-voiced big girl Kristen Johnston ("3rd Rock From the Sun"). Complications arise when Alex and Sophie are invited into Cora's exotic world and discover what the trendy singer intends to do with their song. But there is little doubt all along that the final sequence will see Alex and Cora onstage at the Garden in front of thousands of tweenie fans.
Writer-director Marc Lawrence, following up his directorial debut "Two Weeks Notice" and two previous writing gigs for Sandra Bullock ("Forces of Nature" and "Miss Congeniality"), makes everything about three times more obvious than it needs to be; as a director, he needs to edit himself better as a writer. Visual setups are by-the-numbers.
But there's energy here, and the actors feed on it. Grant carries the day as the fortysomething lad still living off his youth and just about getting away with it; from his first moment onscreen, he persuades you he's the only possible actor for this tailor-made role. No matter Grant's effervescence, newcomer Bennett nearly steals every scene she's in as the Britney/Christina/Madonna figure. Very cute and a hot little dancer, the singer-thesp presents an implacable figure of absolute privilege and authority while sneakily sending up the whole celebrity package in a wonderfully sly turn.
Which leaves Barrymore something of the odd woman out. Granted her Sophie starts out just wanting to blend into the wallpaper, but the star still comes off as rather more drab than necessary, or at least seems so in light of the charisma popping from the pores of those around her. Surrounded by an ex-star, a diva, a brilliant former boyfriend and a livin'-large sister, it's hard for a normal neurotic to get a word in edgewise.
Musical elements are a big plus, notably the crucial central tune by Adam Schlesinger of the band Fountains of Wayne.

Remember Andrew Ridgeley ? He was the other guy in Wham !, the one who found himself stranded in 1986 after George Michael  had faith enough in his own talent to break up the act. Ridgeley went on to record one solo record before the label decided, yeah, no need for a second. In Music and Lyrics ,  Hugh Grant  plays Alex Fletcher"the other guy in Pop!," an '80s new wave act that counted among its hits a ditty called "Pop Goes My Heart."
After releasing one failed solo album, Alex, still squeezing into tight trousers and singing the oldies, has gone on to a dispiriting life of county fair and high school reunion gigs. Living comfortably on royalties, he's also resigned himself to the thoroughly adequate life of "a happy has-been." If nothing else, "it really takes the pressure off," he tells TV producers pitching him on the idea of a boxing show in which the likes of Adam Ant  and Billy Idol  punch themselves further into oblivion.
After getting Alex's backstory out of the way in the first 10 minutes, writer-director Marc Lawrence , who directed Grant in the insufferable Two Weeks Notice  five years back, foists upon his film a rather preposterous meet-cute that renders a promising premise about comebacks and rare second chances predictable and innocuous. Alex is offered a job writing for pop star Cora Corman  (Haley Bennett ), a Shakira  stand-in whose affinity for Hinduism is about as genuine as her blond hair. Cora wants Alex to write the last song on her albumand, of course, he has less than a week to do it. Alex finds a collaborator in his (yeah, here it comes) interim plant-watering lady, the hypochondriac Sophie Fisher  (Drew Barrymore ), a moon-June-spoon kind of gal who provides Alex with just the grade-school poetry he needs to compose that last-second hit single. (Barrymore, so adrift of late in bar-code romantic comedies, has little to do here but click-click-click her pen, make eyes at Grant, and fall into a funk whenever she spies a photo of her ex.)
Music and Lyrics  suggests that it's going to be about redemption, the second act in the life of a punchline, but it feels as though it were made to fit a date on a studio's release schedule. (Happy Valentine's Day!) Oh, well, at least the songs are catchy, and the two-tone video for "Pop Goes My Heart" is inspired, as Alex, his hair moussed to high heaven, dies of a broken heart on an operating table, only to have his soul mended by the cool touch of a hot nurse. The thing would have played nonstop on MTV  in 1984, which is about when the rest of this movie looks like it was made.
