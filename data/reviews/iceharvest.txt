The anti-Christmas Christmas movie is becoming a holiday tradition, like gift returns or drunk driving. Because "The Ice Harvest" tilts less to Billy Bob Thornton, though, and more to John Cusack, the bile-to-eggnog ratio of this happily cynical seasonal concoction is relatively low. "Bad Santa" it's not. Bumptiously entertaining it is.
The film has a heck of a pedigree, and that helps. Director Harold Ramis has blown hot ("Groundhog Day," "Analyze This") and cold ("Bedazzled," "Analyze That"), but here he keeps the pot bubbling nicely throughout. Scott Phillips's 2000 comic-noir novel has been adapted for the screen by novelist Richard Russo ("Empire Falls") and writer-director Robert Benton ("Kramer vs. Kramer," "Places in the Heart"), two top-tier talents who've approached this project as an inspired bout of slumming in the wrong neck of Wichita, Kan.
In addition to Cusack and Thornton, the cast includes Connie Nielsen ("Gladiator"), doing her willowy best to channel Lauren Bacall by way of Kathleen Turner, and Oliver Platt, drunk as a skunk from first frame to last.
At the movie's wobbly center is Charlie Arglist (Cusack), a mob lawyer who's a nervous wreck: It's Christmas Eve and he has just stolen $2,147,000 ("and change") from his boss. All Charlie has to do, assures partner in crime Vic Cavanaugh (Thornton), is lay low for the evening and they can skip town by dawn. As soon as this nasty ice storm has blown over.
Said storm leaves an invisible, omnipresent coating of ice on which all the characters skitter and crash -- a rich little metaphor that Ramis wisely doesn't push. He just follows the increasingly paranoid Charlie on his appointed rounds, from a strip club run by smoky-voiced Renata (Nielsen), for whom he is forever pining, to the local brothel (named "The Velvet Touch" with shabby optimism), to a watering hole where Charlie encounters fellow attorney Pete Van Heuten (Platt). Pete is married to Charlie's ex-wife, and he welcomes his predecessor the way one might a fellow crash survivor.
There's not much plot to "The Ice Harvest." In its place is a lot of comic bad behavior and a decent amount of bloodshed, as well as a sense that regret is futile in a universe that throws so many ice-balls. Those who think otherwise clutter up the movie's sidelines: a bartender (Ned Bellamy) who's both a psychopath and a family man, a pleasantly threatening local cop (T.J. Jagodowski), a mob enforcer (Mike Starr) the size of a small recreational vehicle.
That the latter proves just as lethal folded up inside a steamer trunk as he does out in the open is one of the movie's sweetly grim jokes; so is the persistent characterization of Wichita as a minor circle of hell, with a huffing, puffing minor demon -- Randy Quaid as Charlie's boss, Bill Guerrard-- in charge. The phrase "As falls Wichita, so falls Wichita Falls" keeps cropping up throughout the film in the form of mocking graffiti, as though the walls themselves had given up. I doubt they'll be screening this one for the Chamber of Commerce Christmas party.
Ramis and his cast winkle out every bit of the script's droll misanthropy. Nielsen might have given Renata a bit more oomph -- the actress is game but too ladylike -- but Thornton snarls nicely in support and Platt consistently hits it out of the park as a man who loathes everything about his life and no longer cares who knows it. This includes his wife, in-laws, and Charlie's children in one of the more scabrously funny holiday dinner scenes in recent movies.
Pushing 40, John Cusack is starting to age with rattled grace. He's still got that boyish charm going for him -- his innate Lloyd Dobler-ness, for you "Say Anything" fans out there -- but the cosmic gag of "The Ice Harvest" is that boyish charm eventually wears thin and after that it's a matter of luck. The film's true subject is the grand comedy of entropy: the way things fall apart and the Yuletide center doesn't hold, and the way the best-laid plans of mice (Charlie) and men (Vic) can go awry when there's black ice underfoot.


         John Cusack has a boyish demeanor that's disarmingly perfect for playing a crook, while there's something cagey about Billy Bob Thornton that does not exactly inspire trust. Yet in the sly and sophisticated noir comedy "The Ice Harvest," Cusack's Charlie, a Wichita mob lawyer, has just entrusted to his pal Vic (Thornton) $2,147,000 in cash that they have embezzled from Kansas City crime boss Bill Guerrard (Randy Quaid). A wintry Christmas Eve is about to descend upon the duo, but in time-honored tradition they intend to flee the cold for a warmer locale.
 
  "The Ice Harvest," which unfolds with faultless ease over 12 increasingly hectic hours in Charlie's life, is a classic guilty pleasure: a wholly amoral tale in which the viewer is so charmed by the witty and not unkindly Charlie that one pulls for him to escape the escalating danger into which he has plunged and perhaps even hope he gets away as well, with the loot and the lady, who, in this case, is Connie Nielsen's sultry Renata, the improbable but deliciously elegant proprietress of a strip club, one of several such establishments with which Charlie has business connections.
 


         






    Very quickly Charlie and Vic sense they are being stalked by Roy (Mike Starr), one of Guerrard's thugs, but this does not prevent Charlie from answering a call to rescue his drinking pal Pete (a scene-stealing Oliver Platt), who is causing a ruckus in an upscale bar and grill. Writers Richard Russo and Robert Benton, in adapting Scott Phillips' novel, deftly back into a surprise: Charlie's ex-wife is now married to Pete.
 
  Charlie and Pete's arrival at a formal Christmas Eve dinner at the wife's parents' fancy home — for which Pete is very late and Charlie hardly welcomed, especially by his children — is a hilariously disastrous diversion. But the film is soon back to Charlie in his efforts to make it through the night and to keep the rip-off from completely self-destructing.
 
  "The Ice Harvest" is as smooth as a dry martini, and it's an unalloyed pleasure to behold Cusack and Thornton playing off each other. They're both cocky risk-takers by nature, and while Vic is clearly pretty shrewd — and probably completely ruthless —Charlie may or not be cannier than he seems. The ambiguity that Cusack brings to Charlie gives the film a charge and generates involvement with his fate.
 
  Director Harold Ramis, who strikes a tone that is pleasingly knowing but never smug, creates a beautifully meshed ensemble from his cast, which includes T.J. Jagodowsky as a naive, kindly cop who keeps turning up. "The Ice Harvest" is a droll, dark Christmas treat for adults, a delightful alternative to the usual holiday-themed fare.

In a season of bulging Movies Earmarked for Importance, it is almost startling to come across something as unhyped  and perfectly swell  as The Ice Harvest . This acerbic, unpretentious black-comedy thriller, directed by Harold Ramis with mature glee, and written by Richard Russo and Robert Benton with grown-up literacy, takes place on what is possibly the lousiest Christmas Eve in the modern history of Wichita, Kan. It's a night on which a couple of bumbling embezzlers who think they've struck it rich find the ground cracking beneath them: Having siphoned off over $2 million from the coffers of a Kansas City crime boss, Charlie (John Cusack), a sleazeball lawyer, and Vic (Billy Bob Thornton), for whom being a sleazeball is profession enough, promptly begin to screw up. And as they do so, with greater and more pathetically dipstick complications, the movie takes on the swingin' inevitability of comic disaster.
A tricky dame (Connie Nielsen) exudes musk and danger. A drunken friend (Oliver Platt) causes trouble. The crime boss himself (Randy Quaid) gets wind of the dirty dealing and is out for revenge. The roads become increasingly icy (Midwestern locations supply Midwestern authenticity for the Chicago-bred director), and the Zen-ish graffiti that reappears in bathrooms and phone booths begins to suggest something simultaneously deep and meaningless: ''As Wichita falls, so falls Wichita Falls.''
The Ice Harvest  is surely the most bracing, opposite-of-gooey holiday picture to appear since Bad Santa  which, come to think of it, also made inspired use of Thornton's unmatchable talent for playing a vinegary puss. But even out of season, the movie is an exemplary specimen of collaborative professionalism. In this sophisticated yet seemingly straightforward contraption, Cusack's twitchiness plays off Thornton's oiliness (the two squared off previously, don't forget, in Pushing Tin ) while Platt's theatricality finds its female counterweight in Nielsen's cartoonish sensuality. The dialogue is a festival of good talk without drawing attention to itself as ''snappy.''
There's nothing especially groundbreaking about the work, and that, too, plays as a strength: Here's a movie neither too big nor too small  just good. We need more of this size, this shape. Because, as The Ice Harvest  rises, so rises the stock of the midsize American movie.

Following Bad Santa  by two Noels, The Ice Harvest  is a hearty bah-humbug, suggesting that the mean-spirited Christmas flick might become something of an American traditionalong with office parties, seasonal Muzak, and other forms of mass-produced good cheer.
Harold Ramis 's comic noir is a sort of imploded caper in which a pair of Wichita  wiseguys (John Cusack  and Billy Bob Thornton ) embezzle 2 million dollars from the mob and then, thanks to a providential ice storm, are stuck spending Holy Night at the scene of the crime. So ho ho ho, assholes! At least five killings and many an icy pratfall occur against the nightmarish backdrop of giant candy canes, molded plastic gnomes, and tinsel-draped créches.
Funny, tense, and exceedingly well made, The Ice Harvest  has it both ways. Cusack, as a crooked lawyer who is actually the least devious character in the movie, and especially Thornton, an old hand at neo-noir, give extremely disciplined performances. As the smooth and lacquered proprietress of the Sweet Cage strip joint, Connie Nielsen  projects a parody of seduction worthy of Mae West you might almost forget that she's the genre-requisite femme fatale. The Sweet Cage provides the arena for all manner of stunts. Indeed, a good part of the movie is devoted to detailing American bar behavior, and as Cusack's obnoxiously drunken buddy, Oliver Platt  is pleased to stagger under a substantial portion of its narrative weight. Randy Quaid  makes a suitably menacing appearance late in the proceedings as Wichita's dyspeptic capo di tutti capi.
From the cast and location to the attitude and premise, many things in The Ice Harvest  are inescapably reminiscent of the Coen brothers . But as a director, Ramis is far less flashy and not nearly as pleased with himself. This is one of the most sustained movies of the year, as classic in its structure as Double Indemnity  or No Exit . (The script was co-written by old pros Robert Benton  and Richard Russo .)
On his essential new blog, Dave Kehr  suggests that The Ice Harvest  is the Hollywood  movie of the year. There are those who may prefer Duma  or Syriana  and I'm kind of partial to Corpse Bride , but The Ice Harvest  has its own social function. Not just an exemplary genre flick, it serves to remind us that our pagan forebears celebrated the winter solstice with a debauched feast of foolsit returns Christmas to the Saturnalia, however sodden.
