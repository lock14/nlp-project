Simply stated, ''Munich" is Steven Spielberg's return to seriousness and his finest film in years. You can take it as both a stunningly well-made international thriller and a drama of deepening moral quicksand. Take it as historical fact, however, at your peril.
I can live with that. The movie has been adapted by playwright Tony Kushner (''Angels in America") and screenwriter Eric Roth (''Ali," ''Forrest Gump") from ''Vengeance," the 1984 George Jonas book that has already been the source of a solid 1986 HBO movie ''Sword of Gideon." Jonas's claims have since been disputed -- Aaron J. Klein's just-published ''Striking Back" is a good read for those who want the facts -- and the filmmakers sensibly buy a little insurance with an opening ''inspired by true events" title card.
More to the point, ''Munich" unfolds within a cinematic reality that may be the only world Spielberg really knows. On those terms, though, the movie is a fascinating provocation -- an inquiry into the spiritual costs of revenge.
The subject is the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by the Palestinian Black September terrorist group at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and, more pertinently, the Israeli response: a top-secret assassination campaign, authorized by Prime Minister Golda Meir and carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack.
This is the genre of ''Topaz" and ''Day of the Jackal" -- big cast, lots of European capitals, whispers in alleyways alternating with sudden death -- except that Spielberg doesn't play it that way. He dispenses with the cliches of datelines (no ''Saturday, June 15, Brussels") and casts for effectiveness rather than star-power. Eric Bana is the big name here, and if you're saying ''Who
?" that's the point. (He was Hector in ''Troy" and the Hulk in ''Hulk.")
Bana plays Avner, the handsome yet somehow unformed young agent assigned to lead the Israeli executioners. He gets a nod from the Prime Minister (Lynn Cohen), kisses his pregnant wife (Ayelet Zurer, ''Nina's Tragedies") goodbye, and delivers himself into the hands of his Mossad keeper, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush). ''You're ordinary," Ephraim says, explaining why Avner has been chosen. ''You're not a Sabra Charles Bronson."
The instructions are simple enough: Mossad provides the targets, Avner's team dispatches them. Keep to Europe. No bellhops or civilians, please. If you're caught, we never heard of you.
So it begins -- and slowly, by small steps, becomes impassably murky. The first hits go off with reasonable efficiency, and Spielberg indulges himself with nods to a few classic movies: The spilled milk and blood of one killing echoes ''The Manchurian Candidate," a bit of suspense involving the young daughter of the second target has roots in Hitchcock's ''Sabotage."
Both director and movie are biding their time, letting us come to know Avner's anonymous men. Daniel Craig plays the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, and if the actor who'll be the next James Bond is good, he's upstaged by Ciaran Hinds as Carl, the cleanup man who looks like a depressed insurance executive. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (French actor-director Mathieu Kassovitz, unrecognizable under a ragged beard) and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler). They all hash out the fine details and broader implications of their work as Avner cooks dinner.
Because he's working outside of Israel -- and because he officially doesn't exist -- Avner finds himself having to cut deals and rely on local contacts, and this is where the rug starts slipping out from under his feet. Louis (Mathieu Almaric), a sleek Frenchman of uncertain politics, provides the team with backup and the whereabouts of their targets, but whose side is he on? Is he selling out Avner too? Is Mossad certain about the guilt of the condemned Palestinians, or is Ephraim using the team for a larger housecleaning? Does that matter? Should 
it matter?
As ''Munich" progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas. Those who live in this international no man's land have every allegiance and none, and the only constant is paranoia. A drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB. The hottie at the bar may be a hit woman. The only safe place to sleep is the floor of your closet.
Three scenes illustrate Avner's deepening distress and show Spielberg working at the top of his game. A visit to Louis's father (Michael Lonsdale), a former French Resistance fighter turned avuncular anarchist, is deceptively bucolic -- a Renoir-esque picnic beneath which lurks the new world disorder. When Avner's men take it upon themselves to avenge the murder of one of their number, the hit takes place in daylight, on a pleasantly appointed houseboat, and the victim dies awfully, prosaically, and at great length. There are body parts and a lot of blood in ''Munich," and they don't bring anybody back to life.
The most astonishing moment comes when the team finds itself catastrophically double-booked in a Greek safe house with a group of Palestinian terrorists. The Israelis pass themselves off as various Euro leftists and argue over what music to play on the radio (they settle, gratifyingly, on Al Green), then Avner has a long, late-night conversation with one of the Palestinians (Omar Metwally). The two argue with nonlethal contentiousness, and the next day everyone goes out to kill each other again.
This sequence has already led some commentators to accuse Spielberg and his writers of ''moral equivalency," of implying that the Israeli hit squad and the Munich terrorists are two sides of the same coin. The filmmakers do no such thing. Spielberg cuts back to the Olympics massacre throughout the film, reminding us of its shame and horror, and reminding us, too, exactly who the victims were.
Instead, ''Munich" dwells on the violence that feeds the cycle of violence. It wonders how long righteous anger can be sustained before it tumbles into bloody-mindedness, and how long you can demonize someone before you yourself acquire monstrous aspects. It insists on a problematic common humanity -- not the notion that everyone has their reasons but that everyone thinks they're right and that such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people.
These aren't original ideas, perhaps, but they're still worth putting forth. Sadly, Spielberg loses his grip toward the end of ''Munich." He makes the decision to intercut between a scene of love and a harrowing vision of death, and you end up recoiling from the artsy kitsch. This is a gifted director overreaching and trying to be something he's not -- Francis Ford Coppola in the final moments of ''The Godfather," basically -- and you're reminded once again of Spielberg's strange inability to end his movies well.
''Munich" does close with an image that suddenly, breathtakingly makes the film's concerns topical to American audiences, but I'm betting that's Kushner's work, not Spielberg's. The director can work wonders within his celluloid universe, but when the time comes to hand us back to reality, he stumbles. With this movie, that hurts.
.

         "Munich" is no small thing. No film by Steven Spielberg ever is, but even for this avatar of Hollywood filmmaking this is something apart, the most questioning, provocative film he's ever made.
 
  A director who once proclaimed "I dream for a living," Spielberg has literally thrown himself into the murkiest, most divisive of real-world conflicts. Though he's never yearned for controversy, he's sure to antagonize elements of his audience, especially those who lionized him for his treatment of the Holocaust in "Schindler's List." Aided and abetted by screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, he's made a film that demands to be seen as much for its place in the world as for whether it succeeds.
 


         






    Yet for all its focus on the unrelenting blood lust between Israelis and Palestinians, on the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics and on Israel's relentless determination that "the world must see that killing Jews is an expensive proposition," there is a level on which this film is not about these longtime antagonists at all.
 
  Rather "Munich," in an unlikely way echoing David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence," is about the soul-destroying pervasiveness of killing and carnage and what that means for both individuals and nations. It is a film that nominally presents justifiable homicides but then refuses to allow us to enjoy them, that wants us to recognize that killing that starts out in righteousness can end up in madness. A film that is finally a desperate plea for peace.
 
  It is that sense of a broader purpose that has caused the filmmakers not to care that the underlying source material, a 1984 book called "Vengeance" by George Jonas, was based on testimony by a reputed former Israeli intelligence agent who's been discredited in some circles. Nor are they troubled that the book was filmed before, as a 1986 HBO movie called "Sword of Gideon." By beginning with the words "inspired by real events," "Munich" is letting us know that it's worried less about specifics than about the sentiments it is eager to convey.
 
  It is that desperation, that palpable sense of urgency about the need for that message right now, that is simultaneously a strength of "Munich" and a source of drawbacks. For though this is a film that almost yearns for greatness, strains to reach it just over the horizon, it has not quite gotten there. "Munich" is an important piece of work, easily one of the year's noteworthy achievements, but it impresses us rather than sweeps us away, an instance where significance overshadows filmmaking.
 
  "Munich" begins with the 1972 Munich attack against the Israeli Olympic team by Black September terrorists (subject as well of the exceptional Oscar-winning documentary "One Day in September"). Though the massacre is the raison d'être for what happens next, it isn't shown in full all at once. The attack was apparently an intense experience to film (Spielberg, who used Israeli and Palestinian actors, notes, "They took it very much to heart, it was a very emotional catharsis ... a rugged couple of weeks.") and the director plays out the sequence throughout the film, parceling out the emotion bit by bit and using the memory of the horror to motivate the team called into being to avenge it.
 
  For at the highest levels of the Israeli government, the idea of "Jews dead in Germany" one more time is too much to bear. Prime Minister Golda Meir (an impeccable Lynn Cohen) authorizes the formation of a unit of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, to find and assassinate those responsible for Munich. "Every civilization," she says in one of the film's touchstone lines, "finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."
 
  A young Mossad agent named Avner (Australian Eric Bana) thinks none of this has anything to do with him. "I have," he tells his pregnant wife, Daphna (Ayelet Zurer of the lauded Israeli film "Nina's Tragedies") "the world's most boring job."
 
  But, with the shadowy Ephraim (fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush) serving as his case officer, Avner gets picked to head the retaliation squad. He's told that cost is no object, that he needs to minimize civilian deaths and that his assignment of assassinating terrorists officially doesn't exist.
 
  Avner's team gathers in Europe, and it's appropriately multicultural. South African-born Steve (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) is the driver, Belgian toymaker Robert (French actor/director Mathieu Kassovitz) is the explosives expert, German antique dealer Hans (Hanns Zischler) is the document forger and Carl (Ciaran Hinds) cleans the area of potential evidence after the operations.
 
  Though Avner lacks assassination experience, as played by Bana (known in the U.S. for "The Hulk" and "Troy" but at his best in the Australian "Chopper") he has the strength of personality to lead. Convincingly Israeli, the actor projects a combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness and he knows how to present a face for which worry is a new experience.
 
  A key source of information for the team turns out to be a French family operation, father Papa (Michael Lonsdale, with 50 years of movie experience) and son Louis (Mathieu Amalric, the alter ego of French director Arnaud Desplechin). The family, Louis insists, is "ideologically promiscuous," selling information to everyone except governments, so subterfuge on Avner's part becomes essential.
 
  The central action of "Munich" is the assassinations the team pulls off, a series of impressive set-pieces that showcase the Israelis' determination to be the hammer of God and Spielberg's facility as an orchestrator of action and tension.
 
  The hits, however are not a series of unbroken triumphs. As always in movies, things go wrong, egos and loyalties conflict, betrayals take place. Even when the hits are successful, the film pointedly doesn't allow us or the team to luxuriate in the beauty of complex, well-executed maneuvers.
 
  For hanging over the Israelis' actions is the constant question of whether they are doing the right thing, whether any of their targets actually had a hand in Munich and whether they should care about those questions. The process of taking lives, of living completely without rules in a violent, uncertain world begins to slowly rob them of their sanity. Is an eye really worth an eye? Is one of the team right when he says, "We can't afford to be that decent anymore," or is Robert to be agreed with when he wails, "We're supposed to be righteous. That's my soul. If I lose that, I lose everything."
 
  If this push-pull aspect of "Munich" comes off as planned, 
others do not. Spielberg bolted into this film immediately after completing "War of the Worlds" barely six months ago, a situation duplicating his "Jurassic Park"/"Schindler's List" experience of 1994. "Schindler" did not feel rushed, but "Munich" frankly does.
 
  The press notes say that this is the first film Spielberg did not storyboard. On the one hand, he is obviously gifted enough to make that kind of off-the-cuff moviemaking compelling, and the resulting almost docudrama feeling, aided by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's intentionally desaturated color, helps us get caught up in the story. But there is also an unavoidable feeling of hurry and lack of polish about the film, a sense that some of the plot elements fall too easily into the generic.
 
  "Munich's" dialogue similarly cuts both ways. Without reading the various writers' drafts, it is notoriously difficult to tell who wrote what in a given film, but the language here feels at once bracingly distinctive and a bit awkward, as if it was written on the fly by some very gifted people.
 
  That said, "Munich" has some wonderful spoken stretches (Kushner is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "Angels in America"; Roth, an Oscar winner, is one of Hollywood's most respected voices), especially about the intractable nature of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Ali, a Palestinian zealot who does not know Avner's identity, tells him, "We can wait forever. You don't know what it is not to have a home. Home is everything." On the other side, Avener's mother tells him, "We had to take it because no one would ever give it to us. A place to be a Jew among Jews. We have a place on Earth at last, whatever it takes."
 
  The intentional parallels the film makes between these two presentations, the conflating not of actions, morals and strategies but of hopes and dreams, joined with Spielberg's intention that the film be seen as "a prayer for peace," is one of the things "Munich" cares the most about. But it has led to a pre-release rush to judgment against "Munich" from the kinds of deep-thinking columnists and fulminators who usually find film beneath their notice but can be currently found falling all over each other to weigh in on the subject.
 
  No, no, no, these people are insisting, the quagmire in the Middle East is much too complicated for a simple filmmaker to understand. But seeing "Munich" makes one wonder if this film understands the situation in a way those people do not. Is it possible there are fewer things worth killing for than advocates eager to send others to their deaths confidently assume? Why is war always deemed the realistic response to a situation; why is peace considered the province of innocents?
 
  In this age of feckless and unapologetic zealotry, with leaders whose passion for extremism has led to the lamentable results we see all around us, "Munich's" even-handed cry for peace is not an act of equivocation but one of bravery. What "Munich" has to say, and its ability to say it to the widest possible audience, couldn't be more needed than it is right now.   

The thriller is a gloriously amoral form. We might be watching a heist artist, a cop, or an ice-blooded sniper  what counts, before anything, is the deftness of the action, the ruthless pleasure of pulse-pounding risk and reward. Munich , Steven Spielberg's spectacularly gripping and unsettling new movie, is a grave and haunted film, yet its power lies in its willingness to be a work of brutal excitement. It's a movie about killing that invites the audience to share the terror and the rush, the adrenaline of vengeance, only to leave us sliding into the horror on the other side.
Munich  begins with an event that shook the world, and that arguably remade it: the taking of 11 Israeli athletes as hostages by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Olympic Games, and the murder of all 11 within 24 hours. Spielberg re-creates this cataclysm as a dread-ridden collage of TV broadcasts being watched by viewers around the globe. The famous, eerie shot of a ski-masked terrorist leaning over a balcony is made all the eerier when Spielberg stages it from within the hostage quarters, in perfect simultaneity with the hazy vintage TV footage.
In Munich , however, the Olympic massacre gets relatively little screen time. Inside the walls of Israeli power, the prime minister, Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), gives terse approval to a new eye-for-an-eye ethos: For the sake of Israel's strength and survival, she says, the men who planned the Munich terror must be hunted down and killed.
Spielberg, working from a script by the playwright Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, follows a team of five assassins whose mission of vengeance, organized by the dour, pragmatic Ephraim (played with a jaunty misanthropic jolt by Geoffrey Rush), is to be kept secret even within the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad. Since that mission has remained secret ever since, the movie, by necessity, fuses fact and speculation. The team leader, Avner (Eric Bana), is tall, strapping, and ironically gentle. The son of an Israeli war hero, he's a tender husband who's about to have a baby he will scarcely see for the next two years, yet despite his cherubic poker face, he has the hint of a bruiser about him. His comrades, mostly European Jews, are a quirkier lot. They include a hotheaded South African getaway driver named Steve (Daniel Craig); an antiques aficionado, Hans (Hanns Zischler), with a flair for forging documents; Carl (Ciarán Hinds), a jovial and punctilious cleanup man who, with his fedora and tortoiseshell glasses, has the air of an insurance salesman out of a '50s film noir; and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), a nervous young Belgian toy maker–turned–bomb maker who can never seem to get his explosives quite right.
Kushner has written these roles with a marvelous wry, hostile spunk. There's a glimmer of fractious comedy in this team of not-too-macho Jewish hitmen, who quibble, with Talmudic precision, about the ethics of what they're doing. Does a bodyguard with a gun count as a civilian? (They can't kill him if he does.) At moments, the film plays like a cross between The French Connection  and some '70s crime-series pilot  The Matzoh Squad . Yet Munich , through the unromantic oddity of its assassins, does something all too rare: It immerses us in a suspense that's logistical and, at the same time, anxiously humane. These agents have little high technology to hide behind, and their schemes, most of which hinge on plastic-explosive bombs detonated by remote switch, play out without the usual glib overkill. We can't predict what's going to happen any more than they can. In the Paris apartment of a terrorist-scholar, the phone is stuffed with explosives, but when his young daughter enters the flat, the scramble to abort the mission has a Hitchcockian intensity.
Spielberg shoots Munich  without showy virtuosity, yet his camera seems to be everywhere at once, and John Williams' score is like a telltale heartbeat. The result is a thriller that seeps into your central nervous system. With each assassination, things go awry in a different way. A too-potent bomb blows up an entire hotel floor, almost killing Avner, and the no-civilian rule begins to get left in shards. As acts of global terrorism escalate, a malaise sets in: Righteous as they are, what, exactly, are these assassins for Israel accomplishing? Are they even killing the right men? In the role of Louis, the French information dealer from whom Avner buys the names of his targets (at hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop), Mathieu Amalric, with brusque manners and a crocodile grin, incarnates the sleaze of ''neutrality.'' The very sight of him signifies the gray zone that Avner has entered.
Eric Bana, with wavy hair and a puckered grin that makes him look like Jim Carrey's Andy Kaufman, exudes a decency that is undercut by ripples of anguish. Yet as Avner's willingness to kill for Israel shades into paranoid futility, there's one sequence that sputters: Spielberg cuts between Avner's tormented sexual union with his wife and a flashback to the murder of the athletes. It's ham-handed and philosophically garbled  returning us to the spark plug of vengeance that Avner has moved beyond. That, however, is the only misstep in a movie that has the vision to dramatize a startling reality:  that political murder, even when it's justified, consumes the soul  and justice along with it.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Picture; Best Director (Steven Spielberg); Best Adapted Screenplay (Tony Kushner and Eric Roth); Best Film Editing; Best Original Score (John Williams)

 WITH his latest film, "Munich," Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that  come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, "Munich" is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. Mr. Spielberg has been pummeling audiences with his virtuosity for nearly as long as he has been making movies; now, he tenders an invitation to a discussion.  The film's title suggests that this is the story of what happened at Munich in September 1972, and it is, though only in part. Most of the action - and if nothing else, this nail-biter is a full-on action movie - takes place in the immediate aftermath of Munich, after 11 Israeli hostages  were murdered by members of a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September. Based on George Jonas's  disputed book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team," and adapted to the screen by the oddball couple of Eric Roth and Tony Kushner ("Forrest Gump" meets "Angels in America"), the film pivots on five Israeli agents, who, recruited to exact revenge by a country that will officially deny their existence, zigzag Europe as they hunt suspects over months and then years.  With its art-directed verisimilitude and promiscuous use of archival material (Jim McKay makes a cameo appearance in the film, as does the voice of Peter Jennings)  "Munich" is one of those Hollywood fictions that seem to befuddle those who miss the nuance in the words "inspired by real events." Here, those events begin with members of Black September scaling the Olympic village fence and taking both Israeli athletes and coaches hostage. Most of what happens next, including the agonizing wait at the Olympic village and the catastrophic showdown, emerges piecemeal, in bursts of violence that periodically interrupt the narrative and increasingly trouble the sleep of the story's quavering moral center, a former Mossad agent  named Avner (the Australian actor Eric Bana).  For Black September, Munich is both a theater of cruelty and a means to international visibility. For the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), who personally presses Avner into vengeance, Munich is more than the scene of a crime: it is a reminder, a warning, a defensive call to arms. It is also why, with Meir's blessing, instructions from a Mossad case officer (Geoffrey Rush) and hundreds of thousands of American dollars tucked in a Swiss bank, Avner leaves Jerusalem and his wife and travels to Europe. There, he meets with his team members, any one of whom could star in his own espionage potboiler: the sexy South African in tight pants, Steve (Daniel Craig); the tweedy, pipe-smoking Israeli, Carl (Ciaran Hinds); the smoothly urbane German antiques dealer, Hans (Hanns Zischler); and the nebbishy Belgian toy and bomb maker, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz).  Despite the brief pop-cultural dissonance brought on by the sight of the Incredible Hulk, whom Mr. Bana played in the 2003 blockbuster, sharing the screen with the new James Bond (Mr. Craig) and HBO's Julius Caesar (Mr. Hinds), the actors quickly make these character types their own. The missions happen just as quickly, if not without incident. In Rome, the team tracks a Palestinian intellectual who has just translated "Scheherazade" (which, in a Kushner-sounding touch, the translator describes as a "narrative of survival") and may have terrorist connections. When the moment comes for Avner to face his prey, an older man with trembling hands, the agent fumbles his gun. Later in Paris, in a sequence that finds Mr. Spielberg outdoing Hitchcock with bravura crosscutting, Avner again nearly botches the job, putting his team and an innocent bystander in danger.  If Mr. Bana sometimes seems overly sensitive for an undercover agent it's largely because without his anxious eyes and jittery hands Avner would not be half as sympathetic or rhetorically effective. What makes Avner memorable, more than just an unusually animated action figure, is that he is never more human than when faced with killing another person. More than the story's slow-to-dawn ambivalence about Avner's mission,  more than the obvious effort made to ensure that the Palestinian terrorists are more than faceless thugs (they are thugs with faces and speeches), it is Avner's humanity, however compromised, that gives "Munich" the weight of a moral argument. It's an argument, though, that has little to do with whether Israel has a right to exist or whether the Palestinians have the right of return. Only this matters: blood has its costs, even blood shed in righteous defense.  "Munich" is as much a  meditation on ethics as a political thriller, but it takes nothing away from the film to say that the most adrenaline-spiked part of this genre hybrid involves getaway cars, false papers and the sight of the future Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who pops up during a mission in Lebanon, mowing down terrorists while dressed in a woman's wig and high heels. In between the cloak, dagger and drag, the telephone bombs and a veritable alphabet soup of intrigue (C.I.A., P.L.O., K.G.B.), the years pass with increasing desperation and the team's numbers dwindle.  Forced into a new kind of exodus, far from the homeland meant to provide justification for their every action, Avner and his men wander the continent  that three decades earlier had been the staging ground for the extermination of European Jewry.  For these wandering, bickering, argumentative Jews, every safe house and port of call becomes an occasion for yet another discussion about Israel and identity. Nothing if not conversational, "Munich" is organized around three crucial dialogues: Meir's discussion of vengeance with her advisers, which ends with her declaration that every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values; a brief discussion between Avner and a Palestinian who predicts Israel's defeat; and, finally, a bitter encounter between two Israelis who fail to find common ground even in that multicultural utopia known as Brooklyn. With its dead-eye view of Lower Manhattan and the twin towers, this scene makes clear (as if there was any doubt) that Mr. Spielberg is as worried about this country as he is about Israel.  As his tours of duty with the historian Stephen Ambrose suggested ("Saving Private Ryan," "Band of Brothers"),  Mr. Spielberg can give the appearance of wanting to be seen as more than just a Hollywood director, particularly since he added "adult contemporary" to his playlist, mixing history in with his dinosaurs. That makes him a soft target, and "Munich" has already been strafed by op-ed attacks. The accusations might make sense if the filmmaker took us into the terrorists' homes for some moral relativism. But Mr. Spielberg is doing nothing more radical here than advancing the idea that dialogue ends when two enemies, held hostage by dusty history and hot blood, have their hands locked around each other's throats. You can't hold your children with your hands so occupied, though evidently you can send them off to war.  It would do a disservice to Mr. Spielberg to linger too long on the pre-emptive attacks on the film: more than anything, "Munich" is a slammin'  entertainment filled with dazzling set pieces and geometric camerawork. Different palettes help keep the narrative flowing (there's no danger of becoming lost on the way from Frankfurt to Cyprus), imparting a contrasting vibe to each landscape: the bleached-out Israeli exteriors are as faded as old family photographs, while the verdant French countryside where Avner meets a mysterious intelligence broker called Papa (Michael Lonsdale) has the seductive tug of an idyll. This pocket of green and Old World civility, embellished from Mr. Jonas's book, is the film's shrewdest and most entertaining conceit: a movie within a movie, it is a vision of evil as both seductive romance and bureaucratic banality.  Avner meets Papa through his son, Louis, a dandy with a German shepherd and a sneer played by the French actor Mathieu Amalric. Their organization supplies information for fantastic sums but insists on never doing business with governments, a philosophy that Papa explains during one al fresco meal at his compound. Nestled in haute-bourgeois luxury, surrounded by children and barking dogs, this self-described hero of the Maquis proclaims himself an equal-opportunity hater of all governments. Next to this weary sophisticate, with his blood sausages and free-market nihilism, Avner comes off as a punk, an amateur. But Avner is also an idealist and, unlike Papa, who believes in only his family and money, the Israeli clings to a dream of home. And if that dream remains out of reach, well, Mr. Spielberg asks, what other choice does he have?  "Munich" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film features extremely graphic gun violence.
The war on terror is a grim business, and so is Munich  , Steven Spielberg 's sincerely self-important account of the assassination campaign waged by Israeli secret agents against the Palestinian group that perpetrated the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.
The film is sluggish and repetitive, yet it exerts a certain clinical fascination. Munich  isn't so much a dramatization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or a rumination on the morality of counter-terrorism as a filmmaker's cri de coeur. More than politics, it's predicated on Spielberg's faith in the redemptive nature of Hollywood  entertainment, as well as his ongoing attempt to be all things to all peoplenot just a macher  but a mensch.
Thus, although made from an Israeli perspective, Munich  doggedly seeks to humanize the Palestinian other. Nor are Mossad  and Black September  the only odd couple. Initially written by Eric Roth  (awarded an Oscar for the quintessentially depoliticized Forrest Gump  ), the script was revised by Tony Kushner  (who won a Pulitzer for writing the highly politicized Angels in America ). American neocons and Palestinian nationalists are likely to find common ground in their objections. All are united in victimhood as Spielberg attempts to feel his way into a situation that confounds rational analysis.
Munich  heralds itself as tragedy with a bombastic faux Jewish lament as a group of inebriated American athletes give a gang of Palestinian terrorists a leg up over the wall and into the Olympic village. There they storm the Israeli compound, shooting some athletes and holding the rest hostage. The games continue, even as the whole world watches the debacle on TV. Spielberg compresses the gist of the Oscar-winning doc One Day in September  into a superbly edited McLuhanite frenzy; as with Saving Private Ryan , nothing else in the movie can match its opening.
Munich  was adapted from George Jonas 's 1984 Vengeance an essentially unverifiable account of a Mossad hit squad provided by the unit's leader, known as Avner. As in Vengeance  and its 1986 HBO  adaptation, Sword of Gideon , Spielberg's Mossad commandos are both super-competent and morally confused. Eric Bana 's Avner is a troubled blank, rendered even more so by his unit's gallery of mildly colorful types: the neurotic bomb maker (Mathieu Kassovitz ), nervous diplomat (played as Abba Eban  by Ciarán Hinds ), bellicose muscle Jew (Daniel Craig ), stolid forger (Hanns Zischler ), and their manipulative handler (Geoffrey Rush ), all primed to answer one question with another.
Avner's men are given 11 targets. However, they inadvertently kill other people, add more names to the list, and refuse to terminate the operation. (The Lillehammer  fiasco in which an innocent Moroccan waiter was shot dead is not included; in Vengeance , it was blamed on another Mossad unit.) While point-blank shooting is the rule on both sides, Palestinians are humanized as nice neighbors or caring parents. Collateral damage, on the other hand, is usually reduced to some stray arms and legs.
The action ranges from Rome  to Paris to Cyprus  to Beirut  to Athens  to London, yet nobody seems to know what Avner's men are up toexcept the omniscient French outfit that sells them their information. In Vengeance , this family-run spy service is known as Le Group. In Munich , they're more like Lutece, serving up pretentiously "traditional" cuisine even as they plan Avner's menu. (Turns out he's quite the chef himself.) These gourmet anarchists function as the inadvertent comic relief in what is essentially a half-baked action film, studded with philosophical raisins: "How do you think we got control of the landby being nice?"
As the quest for vengeance continues, Munich  becomes an increasingly dark and rainy nightmare, intermittently illuminated by flashes of anguish. "We're supposed to be righteousthat's a beautiful thing," the bomb maker wails even before his colleagues take it upon themselves to murder a freelance Mata Hari (Marie-Josée Croze ). Avner winds up permanently haunted. "You are what we prayed for," his mother reassures him in the movie's ultimate expression of Jewish patriotism, but even she doesn't want to know just what he did.
Burdened by moral ambivalence, Munich  is a tough slog through a morass of unconvincing human interactions. (At one point, Le Group tricks the Mossad men into sharing an Athens safe house with a group of PLO  operatives: "You don't know what it is not to have a home," one tells Avner, as Al Green  sings "Let's Stay Together" in the background.) But late in the movie, there's a moment of coarse, if undeniable, authenticity: Attacking his material with far less finesse than demonstrated in the opening sequence, Spielberg completes the circuit by flashing back one last time to bloody '72. The remaining Israeli hostages are driven to the airport and then, in a paroxysm of panicked violence, massacred by their captors.
As the German police bungled their rescue operation, so Spielberg mangles this sequence by intercutting it with Avner's agonized conjugal relations and scoring the montage with a strident reprise of the film's opening lament. Is this the filmmaker's big bang theory? His tantrum? In a textbook case of abuse, Spielberg surrenders to his own despair and lashes out . . . at the audience.
