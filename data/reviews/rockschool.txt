If you took electric-guitar lessons from Paul Green, you might end up a rock virtuoso. You might also end up under heavy sedation. Here are some of the more printable things he says to his teenage students in the course of the documentary ''Rock School": ''The whole trend in education is to not compare kids. I
 compare kids"; ''Do you love this song? Do you love Dio? Do you love Satan?"; and -- my favorite -- ''I will kill your family and bathe in their blood."
That
'll get the little buggers to practice.
If this approach to scholastic achievement sounds familiar, you're probably thinking of Jack Black in the 2003 film ''School of Rock." That comedy was based loosely on the real-life Paul Green School of Rock Music in Philadelphia, an after-school program about which director Don Argott was making a nonfiction film even before Hollywood bigfooted the property.
''School of Rock" goes completely unmentioned in ''Rock School," which is something of a shame. You come out dearly wanting to know what Paul Green thinks of Jack Black -- presumably it would constitute libel -- since the former makes the latter look like a Barry Manilow fan.
In many respects, of course, the fictional construct and the real guy seem the same. Receding hairline and career as a failed rock musician, check; black T-shirts and love of AC/DC, check; lack of verbal filter, double-check. But Black's Dewey Finn goes soft toward the end of the ''School of Rock" -- he has to, it's a studio film -- and Green, if anything, gets more impossible as the documentary progresses. It's one thing to be a teacher with a cult of personality. It's another to scream profanities at your students until they cry.
And yet parents continue to send their children to him to learn the basics of rock 'n' roll musicianship, and you can see why: The kids learn a healthy respect for this madman and an understanding of both the tedium and the joy of creating. ''It's not 'Come look at the kids playing music,' " Green insists in one of his more cogent moments. ''It's 'Come look at the kids playing music well.
' "
So we get 12-year-old CJ Tywoniak, a born guitar god who kicks off the film with a rendition of ''Black Magic Woman" that stands as the school's best mission statement. Or Madi Diaz Svalgard, a guitar-strumming folkie teen who Green quickly weans off Sheryl Crow and into multi-instrumental confidence. Madi's a Quaker -- in a very funny tangent, we meet some of her rapper peers -- but she's also one of the few kids willing to give it back to Green as hard as he hands it out.
And we get the 9-year-old twins Asa and Tucker Collins, hilarious little surfer dudes who are here to bang at their instruments because their mother's a groupie at heart. Most poignantly, there's Will O'Connor, a mopey adolescent basket case with a long list of grievances against the world and a noted lack of musical ability. He's on-board because the Rock School is the one place that will let him belong, not that it makes Green go any easier on him.
When Green shrieks at the kids, ''Don't [expletive] make mistakes! Not on 'Rebel Yell'!," he's his own worst advertisement. Indeed, it's a shock to learn, midway through the film, that he's married with a newborn child. Yet as ''Rock School" leads up to its climax -- a trip to the annual Zappanale in East Germany during which the kids play the fiendishly complicated ''Inca Roads" alongside ex-Frank Zappa sideman Napoleon Murphy Brock -- it's obvious that they have become musicians of a confident and remarkably professional stripe.
Whether that's because of Paul Green or in spite of him remains unclear. Certainly he's flourishing: There are Paul Green Schools of Rock in nine locations, including New York, San Francisco, and Salt Lake City (Salt Lake City?
). And the movie is provocative evidence of a big, charismatic baby who gets results from his students by acting like a bigger jerk than they ever could. As a portrait of dysfunctional pedagogy, it's both refreshing and more than a little terrifying.


         Paul Green, the subject of Don Argott's immensely entertaining documentary, "Rock School," is the real-life version of Jack Black's character in "School of Rock." A talented musician whose career failed to take off, he founded the Paul Green School of Rock Music in Philadelphia, a private after-school program designed to train 9- to 17-year-olds in monster-rock stardom.
 
  Green is a charismatic and complicated figure; as unself-conscious as he is self-aware. His lust for fame unabated, Green dreams of the day in 2007 that Rolling Stone magazine traces all the best new bands back to him; at one point confessing that whenever one of his students surpasses him, "Paul the teacher is happy, but Paul the guitarist is not."
 


         






    Still, as applied to a bunch of dorky, half-formed kids, his methodology and ideology have the tang of a mixed blessing. The living antithesis of modern American pedagogical practices, Green thinks nothing of routinely unleashing salty tirades on his charges, which include a 12-year-old guitar prodigy, a Quaker folk singer and a death-obsessed bassist who was once described in an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer as the school's Eeyore.
 
  Equal parts groovy camp counselor, chalk-throwing, finger-slapping maestro, mentor and tormentor, Green is refreshingly unconcerned with protocol (or litigation) and tyrannically doctrinaire. He has made it his personal mission to drill students in the ways of Ozzy, Zappa and Santana, and wean them of their childish tastes for Limp Bizkit and Sheryl Crow.
 
  He relentlessly mocks Madi, the folk singer, whose father teaches at the school, for having once liked a local Quaker rap group that called themselves the Friendly Gangstas. ("Saturday night we feed the poor," Green raps, for the benefit of the other students, "and Sunday night we feed them some more!")
 
  At the end of the film, Green's star pupils perform at a Frank Zappa festival, the Zappanale, in Germany, and the geezers in the crowd are terrifically impressed. The kids are alright; or anyway, they're exactly what Green himself once wanted to be — rock stars in 1972. How that will work out for them in 2007 remains to be seen.

 A Newmarket Film. Director Don Argott. Producer Sheena M. Joyce and Don Argott. Director of photography Don Argott. Editor Demian Fenton. Music supervisor Charles Raggio. Sound mixing Efrain Torres.  Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes. In selected theaters.   

On stage, a budding guitar god  he's perhaps 12  whips off the opening solo to ''Black Magic Woman'' as if he'd been sprung from the rib of Carlos Santana. Sound at all  familiar? I've always thought that movies should be watched, and judged, independently of each other, yet I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Rock School , Don Argott's amusing and spirited documentary, would seem a heck of a lot niftier if its fire hadn't already been stolen by School of Rock . Whether or not that great 2003 Jack Black comedy was ''inspired'' by the Paul Green School of Rock Music (a wee bit of controversy has already swirled around the issue), the novelty of kids learning to play rock & roll in a structured setting, absorbing a ''devil chord'' as systematically as a Bach  triad, no longer carries the same zing.
Green, a testy and demanding fellow who has run his school in Philadelphia since 1998, is a bigger control freak than Jack Black ever was; he's more like Dave Matthews played by Paul Giamatti. Most of Green's students are teenagers rather than grade-schoolers, and his most distinctive achievement is teaching them to play some of Frank Zappa's trippiest riffs. When they attend the annual Zappa festival in Germany, where they perform ''Inca Roads'' in concert with veteran Zappa sideman Napoleon Murphy Brock, it's funny and moving to see this eccentric nugget of boomer virtuosity played by a generation that has absolutely no idea how weird it was.

here's one thing you can say about Paul Green, the extravagantly voluble, relentlessly belligerent, sometimes wearisome center of the nonfiction film "Rock School": He doesn't worry about picking on someone not his own size. If anything, to judge from the evidence  in Don Argott's alternately hilarious and alarming documentary, Mr. Green's pedagogic style appears predicated on the idea that if you spare the insults, derision and eardrum-piercing assaults, you spoil the child. Then again, perhaps Mr. Green is simply trying to prepare his young charges for the inevitable hearing loss that comes with a life hooked to squealing electric guitars and fully cranked amplifiers. As Mr. Green eagerly explains in the film, Mr. Green  is the founder and director of the Paul Green School of Rock Music. That's P-A-U-L, space, new word, G-R-E-E-N. Founded in Philadelphia, Mr. Green's establishment is essentially a music school with a Ray Davies kink: instead of sawing on violins, massacring classics out of the Suzuki method books, his students (ages 8 to 18) throttle electric guitars, bash drum kits and generally make like pint-size rockers. Forget Vivaldi; here, Ozzy rules, as do Zappa and Zeppelin. Mr. Green, who in the documentary admits that he always wanted to be a rock star, though a rock star circa 1972, does not seem to hold  truck with much (maybe any) contemporary music. Hip-hop? Nah. The White Stripes? Nope. Brian May? Totally! Mr. Green started his first school in  1998,  and since then, both he and his establishment have attracted scores of students and quite possibly nearly as many journalists. In the last couple of years, CNN has done stories about the school and its founder, as have periodicals from Oregon to New York (including this paper). Spin Magazine even sent James Iha, formerly of  Smashing Pumpkins, to visit Mr. Green and his school. Mr. Iha found that when the students sang the lines "And all the kids at school/ They were wishing they were me that night" in Meat Loaf's "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," the words rang, as he wrote, "so, so true." Mr. Iha does not say how other lines in that same song, including the memorable "Cause we were barely seventeen/ And we were barely dressed," went down with the parents in the audience. Mr. Argott served as his own cinematographer on the film (using a high-end digital video camera that produces pretty nice results) and perhaps as a consequence creates a comfortable intimacy with his primary subjects, who include a handful of Mr. Green's students. Among the chosen are 9-year-old twins, Asa and Tucker Collins, a singing Quaker named Madi Diaz-Svalgard (whom Mr. Green unkindly belittles for having the bad taste to like Sheryl Crow) and a mind-blowing 12-year-old guitar prodigy, C. J. Tywoniak, who summons up "Black Magic Woman" with Santana seriousness. The kids, seen in talking-head interviews and in situ (hanging out, practicing, practicing, practicing), are generally plucky and sometimes a bit heartbreaking, partly because there is something bleak, in a JonBenet Ramsey sort of way, about kids angling for stardom. Stardom may not be the main focus of Mr. Green's fast-growing enterprise (there are now nine schools, including some that just license the name). Still, watching this camera-hungry dynamo and overgrown adolescent   - who is in his early 30's   - hector his students for almost 93 minutes straight, then take one bow after another at the end of one of their concerts (at a Zappa festival in Germany), it's hard not to think that you're either watching the ultimate stage mother and father rolled into one or a seriously, perhaps unhealthily, frustrated artist. Mr. Argott does not appear to have intentionally laid any traps for Mr. Green, but the dude blunders into them anyway. Remarkably, he even makes Jack Black - who played a music teacher very much like Mr. Green in the Richard Linklater fictional film "School of Rock" - look positively unplugged. "Rock School" is rated R (Under 17, requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The language is raw, and some scenes include  uncomfortable adult-child dynamics.
Rock of underages: Kids get Zap-tized by tyrannical tutor
The short-fused motormouth who runs the Paul Green School of Rock Music , an after-school program for nine-to-17-year-olds in Philadelphia , has claimed, not unreasonably, to be the inspiration for Jack Black 's character in School of Rock. But where Richard Linklater 's movie approached its central incongruitythe idea that anti-establishment rock can and should be schooled with a breezy mix of ironic farce and fuck-the-Man feelgoodism, Paul Green , the frustrated musician and self-proclaimed "really good teacher" at the center of this documentary, embraces the same philosophy with grim, cranky resolve. Students like Madi, a Quaker folkie, and Will, the resident depressive, attest that rock school is a misfit sanctuary and that Green's manic tantrums serve a motivational purpose. In any case, as Will deadpans, "It's a lovable quirk that he's mentally disturbed."
But with his Hannibal Lecter  impersonations, Vietnam  P.O.W. re-enactments, and borderline abusive teasing, Green tends to be more actively unpleasant than amusing. He almost gets misty-eyed envisioning a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone : "Where did all these bands come from? All of a sudden they start tracing stuff back to me." Given that Green's curriculum is even more ossified than his fictional counterpart's, this immodest forecast assumes the resurgent popularity of Frank Zappa -style art-prog. There's plenty of talent on display12-year-old guitar prodigy CJ kills every time he's onbut as the kids dutifully make the pilgrimage to Germany 's tribute-band Zappanale, it's depressingly clear whose dreams they're acting out. (Is it really fair to be force-feeding drug music to listeners who aren't, um, properly equipped to enjoy it?) Don Argott's lively documentary, ostensibly a paean to alternative pedagogy, extends its subject a long leash, and he in turn does his damnedest to sabotage the project. Rock School ends up being a movie about just how little fun rock 'n' roll can be.
