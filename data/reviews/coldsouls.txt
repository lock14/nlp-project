A comedy that has lots of souls

Somewhere between the rabbit-hole absurdist comedy of Charlie Kaufman and a navel-gazing Woody Allen film is the somberly humorous indie "Cold Souls" from writer-director Sophie Barthes. Inspired by Jungian writings, moody sci-fi and today's meta-approach to celebrity, Barthes cast bug-eyed, heroically slumped actor Paul Giamatti as himself, a noted thespian stymied by an inner turmoil that's derailing his rehearsals for "Uncle Vanya," which leads him to a company whose founder (David Strathairn) claims to be able to unburden people by extracting the soul, and/or implanting someone else's. (Not missing a chance for a good sight gag, the film reveals Giamatti's soul to look like a chickpea.) 

This quaintly goofy premise makes for pointedly neurotic "Sleeper"-ish fun, not to mention nifty digs at our culture of self-reinvention.

But Barthes has Andrei Tarkovsky in mind too, namely in a parallel storyline involving a trafficker named Nina (a haunting Dina Korzun) who uses her body as a mule to import the black-market-sold souls of poor Russians. Combining elements of naturalism, poetic tragedy and dry wit, Barthes shows a patient intelligence often missing from today's scrappier filmmakers, and she makes wonderful use of the gifted Giamatti, one of our more entertaining depressives, who thankfully avoids a wink-wink turn. Although "Cold Souls" can at times feel like a clever short film too thinly feature-ized, at least its brain isn't the size of a chickpea.

How fitting that the fictional ''Paul Giamatti'' played by the real Paul Giamatti in Cold Souls  is rehearsing Chekhov's Uncle Vanya  when he decides his soul is too heavy to bear! He's the perfect customer for a shady outfit that promises relief from unbearable being through the neat extraction and storage of one's pesky, heavy essence. Writer-director Sophie Barthes' darkly funny, twisty-cool existential tragicomedy, loaded with smart notions and filmed like a surrealist dream, really takes off post-procedure, after ''Paul'' deposits his excised soul (it looks like a chickpea) in the lab's vault. Bad luck: He discovers that soullessness leads to lousy acting. On a mission to restore himself to himself, he stumbles into a fantastical world of Russian soul trafficking. Dina Korzun (Forty Shades of Blue ) is haunting as a human mule. David Strathairn makes a silky lab head.
The inventiveness of Barthes' story is matched by a sense of visual fluidity that's especially striking in a first feature. Just as important, while luxuriating in Chekhovian hand-wringing, Barthes knows a good joke. Over in Russia, a pampered TV soap actress shops a soul catalog, hoping to borrow the essence of Al Pacino. Hey, a soul can dream, right? A–


 If anyone looks as if he might be in the possession of a troubled soul, it’s the actor Paul Giamatti. With his doubting eyes and gently defeated posture, he tends to come across as a man carrying a burden, though one not necessarily or wholly of his making. You can almost see the distress resting heavy and hard on his sloped shoulders, pushing out against his ovoid head, tugging at his lower eyelids and worrying his lips.  In “Cold Souls,” a story about life’s anguished weight, Mr. Giamatti plays a role for which he is exceptionally, perhaps even uniquely qualified: an actor named Paul Giamatti, thereafter known as Paul. When the movie opens, Paul is rehearsing a scene from Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” with obvious effort and concentration. “I’m a madman,” he proclaims. “I’m 47 years old.” It’s the final act of the play and Uncle Vanya is loudly expressing his vast disappointment. If only, he continues (and here the translation differs from other versions), “If I could only live what’s left in a different way.” In the play the next voice is that of his friend, a doctor, who, with palpable irritation, tells Vanya to shut it.  The next speaker in the film, though, is Paul himself, who angrily cuts off the rehearsal. “Uncle Vanya” is, among other things, about disappointed lives and thwarted desires and the continuing performances we call our lives. In many respects the same holds true for “Cold Souls,” an ambitious, elegantly shot, tonally cool first feature written and directed by Sophie Barthes that shows hints of Stanley Kubrick and Charlie Kaufman both. Yet unlike Vanya, the on-screen character called Paul Giamatti, who may or may not be similar to the public figure — the versatile, heroically ordinary-looking actor  from films like “Sideways” and the HBO series “John Adams” — doesn’t appear to have much to regret.  He lives comfortably and apparently with some happiness with his beautiful wife, Claire (Emily Watson). He has an agent who phones him rather than the reverse. And he’s playing Uncle Vanya in a New York production, a plum gig. But something is troubling Paul, gnawing at him and eroding his performance, or so he believes. It’s not a tragedy, the theater director (Michael Tucker) kindly reminds him after Paul brings rehearsals to an abrupt, angrily frustrated stop. Yet the play isn’t a comedy either.  It’s something in between, something like life, a blurring that thwarts Paul. His already rounded shoulders and bent head droop even further. And then he does something that every artist should be wary of: he listens to his agent.  The agent points toward a possible solution to Paul’s woes: Soul Storage, a company that extracts and stores souls, and on the conveniently close Roosevelt Island, no less. It’s a preposterous hook, of course, but Ms. Barthes introduces her absurd premise with deadpan restraint. In this she has great help from the dryly funny David Strathairn as Dr. Flintstein, who runs the company with his assistant, Stephanie (an underused, decorative Lauren Ambrose). With little ado Dr. Flintstein persuades Paul to relinquish his soul in a swift, painless process that extracts it as if it were a zit. Afterward Paul is horrified to discover that his soul looks — and, as he rattles it inside its glass container, sounds — exactly like a chickpea.  “How can such a tiny thing feel so heavy?” Dr. Flintstein marvels. In “Uncle Vanya” the heaviness is unbearable, essential, inescapable: “We must go on living,” a character  says with wrenching finality. Ms. Barthes more or less comes to the same conclusion, but she complicates her film in ways that suggest she has trouble accepting such a seemingly modest (say, chickpea-size) conclusion. And so, early on, she introduces Paul’s narrative counterpart, Nina (Dina Korzun), a beautiful melancholic who smuggles black-market Russian souls into the United States. Like Paul, Nina is a performer (she passes through immigration using  counterfeit fingerprints) and overburdened with soul, in this case the traces of smuggled souls that linger in her memory like the flickering images from barely remembered old movies.  Initially united only through the editing that toggles between them, Paul and Nina eventually meet in person. There is much to admire in their scenes together, particularly after Paul’s soul has gone amusingly if not tragically missing in Russia. There he finds a soap-opera star who yearns for the soul of Al Pacino (a very good Katheryn Winnick) and witnesses desperate people selling the most intimate part of their being. He also looks into his own soul, and while it brings tears to his eyes, it, much like the Russian subplot, proves disappointingly banal, which might be true to life but is an artistic letdown. In this attractive, smart-enough, finally un-brave movie Ms. Barthes peeks at the dark comedy of the soul only to beat a quick, pre-emptive retreat.  “Cold Souls” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Be warned: the film encourages thinking.

An amusing slice of existential whimsy with an Eastern European bent, �Cold Souls� posits a world in which humans can have their souls extracted and implanted in each others� bodies. It�s the sort of idea one can imagine Charlie Kaufman running wild with, but Sophie Barthes' writing-helming debut is too well-behaved and conventional, stylistically and metaphysically, to achieve the desired levels of creative lunacy. Marketing will need to emphasize the pic�s goofy premise and Paul Giamatti�s enjoyable performance to overcome cool but respectful critical response.
As �Being John Malkovich� allowed Malkovich to spoof himself, so �Cold Souls� hands its lead thesp a similar opportunity, albeit with less side-splitting results. Giamatti plays Paul Giamatti, a New York actor who�s preparing for the title role in Chekhov�s �Uncle Vanya� and finding it increasingly difficult to separate himself from the character.
A New Yorker magazine piece sends the emotionally exhausted thesp into the offices of Dr. Flintstein (David Strathairn), who specializes in �soul storage� -- the science of temporarily removing up to 95% of a person�s soul and all the emotional burdens that accompany it. Wary but desperate, Paul agrees to the operation and is pushed into a giant contraption that resembles a radiotherapy machine. His soul (which looks suspiciously like a garbanzo bean) is bottled for safekeeping, and he leaves a new man.
Trouble is, the new man can�t act, and Paul soon returns to Dr. Flintstein, who obligingly loans him the soul of a Russian poet. Soon Paul is thriving in �Uncle Vanya,� but offstage, the borrowed soul starts making itself felt in the form of eerie dreams, and Paul�s wife (an underused Emily Watson) feels alienated from a man who is clearly not entirely her husband.
A bizarrely integrated subplot follows striking Russian blonde Nina (Dina Korzun), who works as a mule for her homeland�s black-market soul trade. Script contorts itself rather implausibly (even for a movie where implausibility is the rule) as it sends Paul and Dina on a madcap mission to Russia to retrieve his lost soul.
All this nonsense is tossed off with a droll matter-of-factness, and the pic generates some comic mileage from Giamatti�s incredulous, is-everyone-insane-but-me reaction shots, particularly in the early consultation scenes with Strathairn�s deadpan doc.
But aside from marveling at its own wacky (if finally somewhat thin) conceit and making a couple jokes at Giamatti�s expense, the pic never mines any deeper levels of comedy; nor does it deliver that exhilarating Kaufman-esque sensation of getting lost in its own heady conundrums. Warmer than its title would suggest, �Cold Souls� is finally less a philosophical fantasia than a tale of empathy and human connection, beautifully summed up in its lyrical closing shot.
Giamatti has excelled at playing insecure malcontents before (�Sideways�); he�s more open and relaxed here, but just as winning. Korzun prevails over a thinly written role that doesn�t really gel until the third act.
While the pic might have benefited from a more visually offbeat approach, Andrij Parekh�s cool, wintry lensing nicely approximates the tale�s emotional register. 


Sophie Barthes 's clever metaphysical comedy Cold Souls  has been dubbed "Being Paul Giamatti " more than once since its Sundance 2009 debut. But if comparisons to the films of Charlie Kaufman  are inevitable, the similarities only go so far. Sure, Paul Giamatti plays "Paul Giamatti," another "real" actor unwittingly embroiled in a mind/body conundrum; there's a semi-futuristic doctor's office that could sit next door to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 's Lacuna, Inc. ; and a comparable intellectual wit underscores much of the humor. But Cold Souls  exists on a different, surrealist plane: more lyricism, less misanthropy.
When we first see Paul, he's performing a monologue from Anton Chekhov's  Uncle Vanya  as the title character. Full of chest-throbbing anguish, Giamatti can't pin down the performance. His director (Michael Tucker ) tells him he's taking the role too seriously; his agent recommends he check out a recent article in The New Yorker . Headlined "Unburdening Made Easy," the story suggests a way out of Giamatti's unbearable weightness of being: a new procedure that can remove one's soul.
Here, the film's wry goofiness kicks into high gear. Giamatti finds himself in the Soul Storage offices of David Strathairn 's Dr. Flintstein ("A twisted soul is like a tumor, better to remove it!") and ends up in the spherical "soul extractor," a cross between an MRI machine and something out of Woody Allen 's Sleeper . After the actor is handed a plastic cylinder with his inner self, he's distraught to discover it's much smaller than he expected. ("My soul is a chickpea!" he laments in a joke that keeps on giving.)
Giamatti's ensuing adventure is mostly absurdist fun. First, there's the initial liberation of soullessness ("My feet, my feet," Giamatti says, wiggling his appendages as if discovering them for the first time), followed by its hollowed-out horror ("I can't feel a thing!"), and then, the quest to retrieve his soul, which takes him to the far reaches of St. Petersburg , where he must confront the vacuous lives of corrupt Russian entrepreneurs.
If the screenplay is full of offbeat wit, the actor embraces the scenario as wholeheartedly as if it were Chekhov's. Giamatti works the comedy like a pro, from deadpan to slapstick, but he also delivers pathos. Post-extraction, the hangdog Giamatti, at times, resembles a big, chipper bunny rabbit, munching blankly on celery sticks and, in one of the film's best scenes, hopping around the stage of Uncle Vanya , turning the melancholy comedy into screwball lunacy.
But Giamatti doesn't give in to caricature. Unlike Being John Malkovich  's Malkovich, Giamatti isn't parodying himself. He may be playing an anxious nebbish reminiscent of his previous roles in American Splendor  and Sideways , but his commitment to the character is never sacrificed. When the film reaches for spiritual depth, it's only in Giamatti's wet, beady eyes that the moments resonate. It's impossible to picture Cold Souls  with any other actor. (The story was originally based on a dream of Barthes's, starring Woody Allen.)
But is Giamatti's dedication enough to make Cold Souls  more than just a sophisticated romp? The film has a more serious side, in the stories of Nina (Forty Shades of Blue 's Dina Korzun ), a woman who works as a "mule," trafficking souls between the U.S. and Russia, and Olga, a Russian factory worker and mother who sells her precious soul presumably for cash. Less fleshed out than Giamatti's plight, however, the Russian strands feel more like ornamentation. Cinematographer Andrij Parekh (Half Nelson ) blends superb naturalistic handheld camerawork with artful impressionistic effects of blurred lights and disorienting refractions. His shots of vintage Coney Island  and snow-covered Russian ports are exquisite. But it may be only in the film's last ambiguous, evocative image that Barthes and Parekh  finally transcend the material and arrive at something beautiful and ineffable.
