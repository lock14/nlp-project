Terry Gilliam is at it again: bringing one more skewed fantasy to the screen. It�s been a while since his last directorial outing in 1998, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
, and anyone who saw the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha
 (about Gilliam�s problem-stricken and ultimately aborted effort to mount a film production of The Man of La Mancha
), will have some sense of the puckish obstacles that often separate the filmmaker from his vision. The Brothers Grimm
 is no different. Despite the film�s muddled story, we witness frequent glimpses of the visual magic The Brothers Grimm
 contains within. For starters, the movie is not at all a biopic of the folklorists Wilhelm and Jakob Grimm; it�s not even an artistically licensed extrapolation of their lives and careers. It�s pure jabberwocky, although credit for the script goes to Ehren Kreuger (also responsible for The Skeleton Key
 and both American rewrites of The Ring
 movies). For the purposes of this movie the brothers have been made over as Will (Damon) and Jake (Ledger), a couple of con artists traveling through French-occupied Germany during the Napoleonic years. Together with their accomplices, the brothers stage occult occurrences and then hire themselves out to frightened villagers to exorcise the ghosts and demons before moving on. Jake is always jotting down new folktales in his journal, but that is as much as we see of the recognizable Grimms, publishers of the eternal collection of fairy tales. Instead, this movie plops the reimagined brothers into the middle of what might have been one of their own hand-me-down tales. When the French become wise to the schemes of Team Grimm, Gen. Delatombe (Gilliam stock player Pryce) presents them with a real-life mystery to solve or face the executioner�s axe. Children in a certain village have been disappearing and the brothers� lives now depend on finding the solution. Overseeing them is Delatombe�s henchman Cavaldi (Stormare). As the Grimms venture into the magical forest and encounter the evil queen (Bellucci) who is causing the children�s disappearances, the film becomes a showcase for Gilliam�s elaborate artistic design, which is, at times, mesmerizing. However, the effects come at the expense of character development. The Grimms are as sketchy as Delatombe and Cavaldi are excessive. An intriguing woman (Headey) who helps the brothers is reduced to little more than a love object for the two. Furthermore, images from various fairy tales appear throughout (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and so on), without any further narrative development, lending the film the air of a fairy tale without any of the substance. Although Gilliam�s bright color palette and weird camera angles lift the film, it has an overall sense of darkness, as if shot among people who have yet to see the Age of Enlightenment. It�s easy to sense the allure this fantastic project held for Gilliam, but it�s hard to imagine the outcome is anything like his early expectations.


Quick, what do you get when you mix Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Snow White, the Frog Prince, the Gingerbread Man, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, werewolves, the Napoleonic Wars, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, a 1,000-year-old Thuringian Queen, and a director with Monty Python in his DNA and a penchant for shambolic overbudget follies?
You get an absurd mess that's more entertaining than it has any right to be.
''The Brothers Grimm," Terry Gilliam's long-awaited return to the screen after a run of director's bad luck (see the 2002 documentary ''Lost in La Mancha" for the dire evidence), is hardly a triumph. It is
 a Terry Gilliam movie, though, and that's worth something. This sprawling comic fantasia on the life and adventures of the early-19th-century siblings -- who collected and put to paper many of the fairy tales we now take for granted -- is overplotted, overacted, and over-art-directed, with mossy sets and wonky digital effects crowding the frame.
But because this is a filmmaker who truly believes that a movie's not enough unless it's too much, there is genuine over-the-top magic here.
After a brief and darkly funny childhood introduction, we meet Jake (Heath Ledger) and Will (Matt Damon) as they're traveling through French-occupied Germany, scamming one village after another with a profitable ghost-busting act. Jake is the bespectacled scholar, mortified that they're trading on the old folk tales to make a quick thaler
, while Will is the cynical rake who's always ready to play a game of ''who's the fairest of them all" with the local damsels.
There's a bit of Hope and Crosby to these two and remarkably little of Ledger and Damon. In fact, I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out whether that really was
 Damon under the vague British accent and the muttonchops. This is either talent or embarrassment.
Captured by a French general (Jonathan Pryce, wallowing in caricature) and his Italian adjutant Cavaldi (Peter Stormare, even more so), the brothers are frog-marched to a distant village by the Forest of Marsbaden, where children have been disappearing at an alarming rate, where horses refuse to go, and where the trees have minds of their own. Despite the presence of a fetching local huntress named Angelika (Lena Headey), Will wants to bolt. Jake is convinced he has found the mother of all primary sources.
''The Brothers Grimm" never quite makes up its mind whether to play as the broadest of farces -- that's certainly what the director told Stormare, who quickly grows tiresome -- as an action-filled buddy movie, or as a tingly eldritch mystery of pagan beliefs taking back a little post-Enlightenment ground. When all the cylinders click, the effect is transporting, as when a glop of enchanted mud wipes a child's face right off her head and uses it to morph into a bratty gingerbread kid. When the pieces don't fit, the movie's just dank noise, a poor cousin to Gilliam's ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."
Without spoiling too much, I can reveal that ''Brothers" is lucky enough to actually have
 the fairest of them all -- that would be Monica Bellucci, as a wicked queen with eternal youth on her agenda -- and a climax that looks both cluttered and nicely pre-Raphaelite. But the movie never does enough with the idea that the old fairy tales might be all that's left of a powerful, pre-Christian world.
''The Brothers Grimm" has been sitting on Miramax's back shelf for the better part of a year and is getting a quick release before DVD oblivion and the fall appearance of Gilliam's ''Tideland," which from early reports is a much more ambitious work.
Consider this an appetizer, then, from a gifted, if bonkers, movie visionary. The fact that we're seeing it at all counts as a happy ending.

         Like a character in a fairy tale caught between the forces of light and those of darkness, "The Brothers Grimm" attempts to serve two masters. No, there is not a happy ending.
 
  Not to put too fine a point on it, "Grimm" is an attempt to marry the gloriously unbridled imagination of director Terry Gilliam to the particular demands of the kinds of product the picture's distributor, Dimension Films, usually handles: horror films made to satisfy the inexhaustible appetite of the under-25 population
 


         






    Making matters worse in this case is that the filmmakers had a reported $80 million to work with, the largest budget in Dimension history. Money can be a good thing on a film, but in this case it has simply encouraged Gilliam to lose himself in increasingly excessive flights of grotesque fancy that must have been fun to play around with but are the opposite to watch.
 
  As written by veteran creepologist Ehren Kruger ("The Ring," "The Ring Two," "Scream 3," etc.), "Grimm" starts with an intriguing premise. Gone are the scholarly brothers of history who collected folk tales as a way of preserving German language and culture. In their place are two guys of a more wild and crazy disposition.
 
  Realist Will (Matt Damon) and dreamy Jacob (Heath Ledger) are still brothers, but here their line of work is more in the nature of ghost-busting/performance artistry. Working in French-occupied Germany in 1811, they first use their theatrical skills to create crises like witches and goblins that appear supernatural and then "miraculously" clear up the problem and pocket some healthy change.
 
  To the occupying French, however, the Grimms are little better than con men. Captured by the epicene Gen. Delatombe (Gilliam veteran Jonathan Pryce) and his henchman Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), a self-described "master of the torturing arts," they are ordered to go to the village of Marbaden and find the villains who have been impersonating supernatural forces and kidnapping a string of little girls.
 
  Though the Grimms' initial take on their opponents is simply that "these people are much better funded than we are," they soon have to accept the truth: They are face to face with the real thing, genuine black magic personified by an ancient evil queen played by Monica Bellucci. With the help of the coldly pragmatic hunter Angelika (Lena Hedley), the Grimms prepare for the fight of their lives.
 
  Because this is, after all, a Terry Gilliam film, "The Brothers Grimm" has its share of wacky moments that are quite unlike anyone else's, from heavily tongue-in-cheek line delivery to a running joke involving "a kiss for grandmother toad." And after the dreadful luck Gilliam had trying to make his Don Quixote movie (wonderfully delineated in the 2002 documentary "Lost in La Mancha"), it's good news that he has another feature in theaters. Deprived by Dimension of Samantha Morton, the actress he wanted for Angelika, and of his favorite cinematographer, Nicola Pecorini, he still got the job done.
 
  Unfortunately, although Gilliam has always had a taste for the outre, he has allowed it to get out of hand here and swallow the picture whole. There's an excessiveness, an unwelcome too-muchness to "Grimm's" creepy moments. The film's audience may be initially split between die-hard Gilliam fans and teenage boys, but its insistence on being more off-putting than anything else will inevitably swing the pendulum in the younger direction.

Terry Gilliam must marvel, if not weep, at the irony: Hollywood today has been all but taken over by fantasy, yet Gilliam (12 Monkeys , Brazil ), the rare fantasy filmmaker who's a true artist, remains too oddball a talent to fit into Hollywood. Not that he isn't trying. In The Brothers Grimm , Gilliam's batty historical fractured-fairy-tale lollapalooza, he comes on as if he were Jean Cocteau attempting to make The Mummy Returns . Gilliam has re-imagined the Grimm brothers, those inventors of Victorian bedtime dream myths, as Will (Matt Damon), a cheeky lady-killing skeptic, and dour, mystical Jake (Heath Ledger), making their way through an early-19th-century Germany overrun by French military men with atrocious accents. (Worst offender: a tie between Jonathan Pryce's fascist general and Peter Stormare's horse's-ass henchman.) The two Grimms are charlatans who set up fake sinister enchantments from village to village, destroying the bogus monsters for profit  only to find themselves trapped in a fantasy that comes true before their eyes.
In a lusciously knotty forest, Gilliam teases us with tidbits of magic. Trees shimmy forth on twisted roots, and a horse shoots a cobweb out of its mouth, all the better to swallow a sacrificial virgin. An ancient stone tower turns out to be the prison fortress of the Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci), a raven-haired icon of sultry vanity, cursed with eternal life but not youth, who lies in bed day after day, looking as cadaverous as the grandpa in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Her image, in its way, is a ghoulish wonder, vaguely evocative of Rapunzel and Snow White's stepmother; other visions, like a glow-eyed hyena, just seem left over from bad horror films. Watching The Brothers Grimm , we keep waiting for Gilliam to fashion the recombinant bits and pieces into something of his own, yet the movie, with its muddy, teeming location backdrops and digitized bugs and demons, is at once frantic and impersonal  a piñata of visual effects that Gilliam keeps smashing, with diminishing returns.
It doesn't help that the heroes are boring. Damon, outfitted in a long coat, wavy hair, and sideburns that make him resemble one of those mid-'60s English rock stars (Brian Jones? Peter Noone?), and Ledger, looking like a sourpuss in steel spectacles and an unflattering beard, do their best to work up a chipper and competitive camaraderie, but the actors haven't been given roles that are etched beyond their outlines. The opening 45 minutes are a disaster of dissociated staging, with Gilliam reveling in that affection for mucky village squalor (freshly gutted rabbit, anyone?) that he's been overindulging since Jabberwocky, in 1977.
The Brothers Grimm  comes to life when the Grimms arrive at a village that's reeling from the disappearance of 10 young girls. The brothers don't believe, at first, that the otherworldly events are real (''These people are much better funded than we are!'' exclaims Will), but they're convinced by a nifty blob-demon that shifts shape like the Pillsbury Mudboy. A mythology falls into place, yielding a smattering of eerie images, notably when the Mirror Queen confronts her destiny. What the film never does is imbue those visions with an emotional undertow. Strenous yet flat, The Brothers Grimm  is a let's-see-what-sticks spectacle that, coming from Terry Gilliam, is more grim than Grimm .

 A maximalist who loves cramming the screen with noise and raucous nonsense, Terry Gilliam has a history of navigating past treacherous obstacles, including those of his own design. When his films work, these excesses have a liberating, exhilarating effect, allowing you to hitch a ride on the director's ingenious flights of fancy. But Mr. Gilliam's strengths as a filmmaker - an out-of-bounds visual imagination, a tendency to spiral wildly off topic, a fractious wit - can also be his gravest liabilities. Almost invariably there comes the moment in his films when it feels as if you have entered one of those bewildering junk shops stuffed to the rafters with mildew and treasure.  That moment stretches into a seeming eternity in Mr. Gilliam's latest big-screen effort, "The Brothers Grimm," a film that has little to do with the actual folklorists. As played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, these brothers are con men who, during the early 19th century, troll French-controlled Germanic towns preying on the superstitions of their inhabitants. Kitted out in period garb and dubious British accents, the actors throw themselves into this flimsy contrivance with energy, but are badly served by a director focused on flipping switches and twirling knobs. Despite a few early sparks of promise (an antiwitch potion made with "baby tears"), "The Brothers Grimm" sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure.  The story, which is credited solely to Ehren Kruger ("The Skeleton Key"), tracks the brothers as, at the behest of a French general (Jonathan Pryce), they try to solve a series of small-town kidnappings. Mr. Gilliam has indicated that he was unhappy with the original script, which he unfavorably likened to "The Mummy." Although he has said he reworked the script with his sometime collaborator Tony Grisoni, they do not have screenwriting credit. Mr. Gilliam and Mr. Grisoni nonetheless decided to assert their contribution by calling themselves "Dress Pattern Makers," a designation that, if you are still awake when the film ends, you can catch in the closing credits.  Mr. Damon and Mr. Ledger shout their lines and run circles around each other as they try to advance the plot. Like Colin Farrell in "Alexander," Mr. Damon is also forced to struggle with a most disenchanting handicap, namely a hairdo (or wig) that in combination with his sideburns and frock coat make him look ready for a Paul Revere and the Raiders tribute band. The director, meanwhile, ignores the forest while he tends to his magical trees, which look about as scary as breadsticks compared with the pugnacious perennials in "The Wizard of Oz." Mr. Gilliam seems familiar with fairy tales (as the resident villain, Monica Bellucci asks who's the fairest one of all), but expresses no interest in their possibilities. Here, there is absolutely nothing - not dread, not desire, not mystery - under the little red hood.  But as usual in Mr. Gilliam's films, there are lavishly tricked out sets, detailed costumes and props, a darkly ironic if unsteady tone and hiccups of strained surrealism. In classic Gilliam fashion, the brothers are alternately besieged and bewildered by strange forces and creatures, and actively engaged in the imaginative creation of other worlds. Mr. Gilliam's characters often struggle to break on through to the other side, but here that struggle is also assumed - and lost - by the filmmaker himself. Despite his kinks and flourishes, he never manages to stitch together the kidnapping subplot with all his dumb sight gags (a skinned rabbit, an errant hairpiece), cartoon performances and an unfortunate, pop-psychological explanation for the brothers' interest in the uses and abuses of enchantment.  In interviews about "The Brothers Grimm," Mr. Gilliam has scattered a tantalizing trail of bread crumbs that lead from the film - his first to be released in theaters in seven years following the underrated "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" - directly to Miramax, the company that took over the production. It is perhaps fitting given this new film's subject that in his version of what happened once upon a production time, Mr. Gilliam bears a striking resemblance to Hansel and Gretel, those two Grimm innocents who, after being forced into the wilderness, hungrily gnaw on a house of bread and sugar only to be almost eaten by the conniving witch inside. Like Hansel and Gretel, however, Mr. Gilliam knows a little something about survival.  Among the most tantalizing crumbs strewn by Mr. Gilliam: Miramax fired his original cinematographer, did not allow him to hire his choice for a lead actress (he wanted Samantha Morton, but ended up with Lena Headey) and put a kibosh on a prosthetic nose for Mr. Damon. The nose, Mr. Gilliam says, made the actor look like a "young Brando." That must have been some nose. After filming was completed, Mr. Gilliam took a six-month break and shot another movie, "Tideland," before returning to the earlier film. He now claims to be satisfied with "The Brothers Grimm," which may be true or may be one of those classic Hollywood fairy tales in which everyone lives happily ever after - at least until the lawyers say otherwise.  "The Brothers Grimm" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of staged animal cruelty, gun and blade violence and the usual hobgoblin boos.

As divorced in its own way from the original source material as the most antiseptic Disney fairy tale, Terry Gilliam's "The Brothers Grimm" is deeply lost in the woods. While the pic may have been theoretically a good match for one of cinema's most fabulist directors, in practice the experiment reps a misconceived reframing of all things Grimm. From its depiction of the German author-kin as con men to its frenetic and exhausted conclusion, there's little appeal, save for those looking for a late-August distraction. Not even a Venice competition slot will slow the film's journey toward the video castle.
Working from a glibly conceptual screenplay by the busy Ehren Kruger ("The Skeleton Key"), Gilliam must have seen all sorts of possibilities stemming from the central idea of dropping the brothers down into a real-life situation in which some of their fictional characters and situations come to life. 
This split between reality and fantasy is something the director has played with many times before, but the tilt here toward a hyperactive, buddy-movie action-adventure with loud comic archetypes is a poor fit for a film that relies on fairy tale icons and themes. 
Nothing is less amusing than the set-up of Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) as traveling con men in the early 19th century, who foster backwoods German folks' beliefs in witches and the like with elaborate special effects. If this is meant to be a joke about how artists can trick the senses, it falls like a thud, and has the effect of making what were actually quite engaging, earnest but poverty-stricken young writers into a pair of shady fools.
In typical buddy-pic fashion, Will and Jake -- the anachronistic nicknames they give themselves -- are opposites: Will is a skepticand ladies' man, and Jake a mystical private figure too much into his tales. Their cons are exposed and lead to their arrest at the hands of the fatuously silly torturer, Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), who's in the pay of the Napoleonic Army.
Down the road, the village of Marbaden is feeling cursed. One young girl after another -- including a little one in a red riding hood -- have vanished without a trace into the menacing bosque where trees come alive.
Accused of doing harm to the girls, the brothers protest, and are taken to Marbaden. Will assumes there is an elaborate piece of trickery going on, but in trying to convince local huntress Angelika (Lena Headey) to accompany them, the guys both find themselves attracted to her.
Although the film foregoes much of the Grimms' literature for a dumbed-down set of conflicts that turn even Napoleon's finest (led by Jonathan Pryce's theatrically spoofy Delatombe) into goons, the mood in the forest is powerfully atmospheric, as gnarled trees turn into nightmarish many-armed creatures, and a power is loose that can make a horse go mad and gobble down a small child.
Only for a brief interlude does an actual Grimm-like tale take center screen, featuring a crumbling tower that had housed a murderous king and his queen (Monica Bellucci), now alone and desperately trying to reverse the aging process, with touches here and there of the egoist queen in "Snow White." The brothers' belabored efforts to scale the tower and reverse the queen's evil powers lead the film into cumbersome action set pieces that are neither quite fairy-tale fanciful nor convincingly real. 
It's this in-between-ness, along with Gilliam's numbing use of filming with ultra wide-angle lenses that turn "The Brothers Grimm" into the director's glummest and most visually clunky production.
Offsetting this tone to a degree is Ledger as a charming bumbler who really believes in dark powers. Damon does little more than a variation on his role as Linus in "Ocean's Eleven" and "Twelve." trying to be a smooth, nice-guy operator. They're both overwhelmed in the end by the pic's sheer busyness.Stormare and Pryce ham it up to pointless excess.
Even the terrific forest effects (and a stunning one of a boy transformed into the Gingerbread Man) get compromised by other, under-realized ones, some involving werewolf transformations. Taking his cues from the film's worst tendencies, composer Dario Marianelli has stitched bits of Bernard Herrmann stylings into a lumbering, generic score.

Either you're a schnook for what we can call the Nicholas Meyer  Conceitpace The Seven-Per-Cent Solution , ironically commingling historical and fictional characters in period pulpor you're not. Call it creative irreverence for Western-culture sacred cows. I'm the only earthling besides Lem Dobbs 's mother who still likes Kafka , and for me Terry Gilliam 's new windup toy The Brothers Grimm  is a daffy, genre-hash gambol, descendant of the Hammer Film school (if those B sides had ever been made with money and talent) and just as fabulously cartoon-Gothic as Sleepy Hollow . The concept reads like second nature: Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm  (Matt Damon  and Heath Ledger ), steeped in lore and weathering life in Prussia during the Napoleonic occupation, work as scam artist ghostbusters for outlying villages troubled by superstition or crop blight or a particularly dark patch of forest. Until, of course, they are apprehended by the French and forced to investigate genuine child disappearances in a remote hamlet chockablock with Gilliam-esque filth, farm animal clutter, rag-dressed peasants, and wobbly Tudor architecture.
Gilliam-istes should anticipate an experience more akin to Jabberwocky  than Brazil ; quite correctly, the movie never seeks to trump the original Grimm fables or make them modern. Rather, Gilliam and screenwriter Ehren Kruger  maintain a bald air of schoolkid gimcrackery, folding in iconography from over a dozen fairy tales but striving to make a girl in a red-hooded shawl or a stack of mattresses or a long-haired princess trapped in a high tower ordinary within the film's Arthur Rackhamish world. Wolves and hostile flora are prevalent concerns. Still, Grimm  is never serious: Cabaret crudeness pervades the scenario as well as the performances. (Someone even mentions a town named Schwanzfeld.) Torturing Germans by applying land snails to their faces and hanging the brothers upside down over boiling something-or-other, Jonathan Pryce 's grinning, foppish French general is virtually a brother to John Cleese 's Holy Grail  turret dweller. Damon, as the scheming, cynical Grimm with 1971 sideburns, is an able-bodied straight man, while Ledger, as the dreamer of the family, swan-dives into the movie with complete abandonhe doesn't seem to be quite aware he's in a Gilliam film and can therefore cram tongue in cheek. But they're all buried by Peter Stormare  as an Italian officer-executioner, who even as he punts a kitten into his torture chamber's whirring blades bids to have us believe that Timothy Carey , the scariest and least savory of character actor cult gods, is still alive and kicking.
Noting that it's the only major release of 2005 that makes hay of an illegal military occupation will only get you so farGilliam is an escapist, not just an escapism manufacturer, and for him history is still grist for Pythonian high jinks. At the same time, his tendencies, running back to Monty Python  and the Holy Grail 's on-location medieval chill, have always been rather Grimm, and the new movie adroitly conjures a thoroughly unidealized children's-lit past, full of phobic nastiness and ridiculous mayhem. ("Don't trust the trees," Lena Headey 's all-business maiden warns the bros.) The magical mutation of a horse into a child-swallowing juggernaut has a queasy concreteness to it, and another sorcerous invasionthe mud at the bottom of the town's well consumes another child and struggles to transform into a gingerbread boyis positively Svankmajer-esque. It's difficult not to relish Gilliam's devotion to tangibility; at least half of what is digitizable in Grimm shot as it was entirely in the Czech Republic is in fact set design and props.
Naturally, the plot's conclusive act isn't quite as beguiling as the enigmas that trail up to it; Gilliam makes expensive studio films, which always require an abstruse but neatly shrink-wrapped story line and any number of unconvincing action sequences. Like Tim Burton 's, Gilliam's filmic approach is curiously flat-earthhe visualizes only in terms of baroque composition, and the strain to wrestle his images and constructions into a traditional chase-and-fight dynamic is always palpable. It's a burden he'll always hump around; Gilliam thinks big, one shot at a time.
What would happen if Gilliam was funded to the teeth and cut loose? Would he even know how to exploit his own skylarking whims? Who cares: In most of its guises, The Brothers Grimm  is old-school matinee candy, missing only a Harryhausen-monster simulacrum to make the time-tunnel frisson complete. (Burton would've thrown that in.) If only summer movies were, as a matter of course, this inventive, this modest, this interestedeven derisivelyin cultural legacies, this faithful to concept and setting (no skateboarding stunts! no genital jokes!). Reportedly plagued by Weinsteinian bulldozers in the makingto the degree that Gilliam halted production for half a year and made the upcoming Tideland  before returningthe film nevertheless has the relaxed air of a rainy afternoon spent reading Robert E. Howard .
