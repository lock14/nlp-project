It's taken them nine years to get there, but the award-winning collection of junkies, drag queens, and activist urchins from the East Village have finally made it to Hollywood. And in the movie version of "Rent," they are such a cute and cuddly bunch it's easy to leave the theater thinking you've just seen "Muppets Take Manhattan," instead.
Of course, Miss Piggy, Scooter, and the gang were treated to livelier direction and better production values. In bringing Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer Prize-winning rock-popera to the screen, Chris Columbus seems to have kept in awkward spaces after the musical numbers for audience applause. This is wishful thinking, given the dispiriting lack of creativity he's brought to the proceedings.
Most of the original cast members have made it back for the movie, which was filmed on location in New York. Rosario Dawson fills in for the feral Daphne Rubin-Vega and Tracie Thoms for soulful Fredi Walker. Everybody belts his and her little heart out. But they're all so poorly lit in some numbers we can barely see them. Yes, "Rent" is about penniless artists who can't afford to eat or pay their electric bills. But must their straits extend to the threadbare filmmaking, too?
Larson, who died before the show opened on Broadway in 1996, fashioned "Rent" as a contemporary version of Puccini's "La Bohème." Like the show, the movie's plot is told in strands that are occasionally woven into production numbers. While the play didn't specify a year, the movie sets the material in the late 1980s. And a lot of the dialogue originally sung is now spoken on-screen -- sometimes, unfortunately, in rhyme.
Holding the story lines together are Mark (Anthony Rapp) and Roger (Adam Pascal), roommates in an illegal industrial loft. One's a filmmaker, the other an ex-junkie rock songwriter. Their professor friend, Collins (Jesse L. Martin), gets mugged and is rescued by Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), a benevolent drag queen. They both happen to be HIV-positive and fall in love.
Mimi (Dawson) is the stripper junkie who lives downstairs from Roger. They fall in love, too. Also in love are Mark's ex, Maureen (Idina Menzel), and Joanne (Thoms). The whole crew is united against Bennie (Taye Diggs). He used to be a hipster but now is a suit who wants to raze a tent city to build a production studio.
People bicker, they dance, they die.
The movie gets off to an inauspiciously sluggish start when the eight main cast members belt the show's signature tune, "Seasons of Love," on a set-less stage in front of an empty house. They're giving it their all, grooving and wailing to no one in particular: Hey, we're over here! And it's 1989 -- Simon Cowell hasn't been invented yet.
Some will marvel at the multiracial casting, and they wouldn't be wrong. There is something powerful and touching about a black male academic loving a cross-dressing Latino activist. But Columbus has let down die-hards before: The first two "Harry Potter" movies were his. There, he worked with competency if not imagination, and the material was in his kid-friendly strike zone. "Rent" is a disappointment in part because he doesn't seem adult enough to take its adult themes seriously.
Sometimes, however, Columbus and the movie get it right. Rapp and Thoms have a wonderful, funny exchange called "Tango: Maureen," in which they commiserate about Menzel's drama queen. It's a sparkling scene, all the more remarkable because, at last, we can see the singers feeling the song. Rapp is the Kermit of this operation and the best thing in the movie, selling all the songs with hard-working boyishness.
Columbus and his crew even open up the number to show the two tangoing with Menzel and a room full of extras.
In another superb production number, "La Vie Bohème," all the main characters and whoever else is around gather in the Life Cafe (bigger and brighter than the real thing). Though the camera barely knows where to look, the actors are having a great time, sliding on counters and stage-kissing, while ticking off toasts to stuff they love ("Huevos Rancheros and Maya Angelou!").
The sequence is exhilarating. It's also satisfyingly long, and Larson's exclamatory songwriting here gets at a primal teenage urge to show off and be shocking. A decade after it opened, too much of "Rent" feels quaint. But this number still carries the big charge of a generational anthem.
The sequence is the movie's centerpiece, and what follows in the second half is especially dull and silly. A lot of the cues in "Rent" seem to come from the music videos of the 1980s and '90s. Not the good ones, either, but trite, shoddy-looking, forgettable flotsam from the likes of Jody Watley and Journey. Near the finale, poor Adam Pascal, already burdened with Jon Bon Jovi's haircut, has to reenact the singer's mountaintop wailing from the "Blaze of Glory" video.
Some of the staging is just dumb. "Santa Fe" is a good song that's inexplicably set on an uncrowded subway train. Martin, with his big body and creamy voice, is forced to swing around the poles, which he does like a giant gymnast. He has pizzazz, but not a lot of floor space. It's a miracle he doesn't hit his head.
While filming on location lends "Rent" authenticity, there's nothing here as electrifyingly surreal as that traffic-stopping scene in Alan Parker's "Fame," in which arts students danced on taxis. When Martin and Heredia sing "I'll Cover You," a lovey-dovey up-tempo duet, we can see the breath escaping their mouths. But they don't shout their love from the middle of Canal Street or wherever they are. They do it safely on the sidewalk, which is the movie's problem. It's pedestrian.

  How to put this. "Rent" is a Chris Columbus adaptation of a smash-hit Broadway musical about artistic integrity, counterculture, political activism and squatters' rights that may have been the most successful moneymaking venture ever staked on selling the idea that "selling out" is bad.
 
  (Two tickets for an 8 p.m. Friday show at the Nederlander Theater in New York, up to $295 apiece. The chance to tap your Ferragamo-shod toe to lyrics like "No pension  hating convention  hating pretension  riding your bike midday past the three-piece suits?" Priceless.)
 
  It's hard to put the experience of watching "Rent" into words, especially after "Team America: World Police" said everything there was to say about the play with puppets, and so succinctly. ("Everyone has AIDS! AIDS AIDS AIDS! AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS! Everyone has AIDS!")
 
  But I'll try.
 
  "Rent" is commodified faux bohemia on a platter, eliciting the same kind of numbing soul-sadness as children's beauty pageants, tiny dogs in expensive boots, Mahatma Gandhi in Apple ads. It's about art, activism and counterculture in the same way that a poster of a kitten hanging from a tree branch ("Hang in There!") is about commitment and heroic perseverance. It represents everything the people it pretends to stand for hate. And it doesn't even know it. Watching it feels sort of like watching "Touched by an Angel" with your grandmother and realizing that although you're clearly looking 
at the same thing, you're seeing something entirely different. It's awkward to behold.
 
  The movie begins on a stage, with all of the characters lined up singing "Seasons of Love." The theater setting is the movie's single reference to its origins, but though the characters soon leave the stage for good, the movie never really does. Compared to a masterpiece of the genre such as "Cabaret," "Rent" seems to find its new status as a film more embarrassing than liberating, and it clings to its own theatricality for dear life, as though it were Blanche DuBois and someone had just flipped on the lights.
 
  It's Dec. 24, 1989, and Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), an earnest filmmaker with a Bolex camera strapped to his handlebars, rides through the streets of Lower Manhattan, earnestly photographing homeless people and singing.
 
  Returning home to his Alphabet City loft, he finds his heat and electricity have been turned off. His roommate, Roger (Adam Pascal), a musician, informs him that they've received an eviction notice from their former friend, roommate and fellow artist Benny (Taye Diggs), who has married up, up and away to the landlord's daughter.
 
  Meanwhile, their friend Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin), a philosophy professor who just got fired from MIT for his "theory of actual reality," is mugged in an alley, where he's rescued by a loving drag queen named Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia); and a heroin-addicted exotic dancer named Mimi Marquez (Rosario Dawson) swoons over her upstairs neighbor Roger, who assiduously ignores her. Wouldn't you know it — everyone has AIDS. Roger, Mimi, Angel and Tom do, anyway. The rest of the gang is merely broke and dysfunctional.
 
  Soon, Benny shows up, offering to reinstate rent-free living if Mark and Roger help stop a protest, planned by Mark's ex-girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel). This would pave the way for his new "state of the art virtual digital interactive studio." Maureen, a narcissistic performance artist, has recently left Mark for a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms), but Mark and Roger would rather starve, freeze and sing about it than lift one finger toward the neighborhood's gentrification.
 
  Not that you blame them. Or you wouldn't, if the movie didn't make it so hard not to roll your eyes every five minutes. For all its passionate defense of bohemian living ("Rent" is cribbed from Puccini's "La Bohème"), much of it delivered from atop a table at a local restaurant where the bourgeoisie stick around to be dutifully épaté
, the movie's supposed admiration for the lives of noncommercial artists doesn't touch its withering disdain for their work.
 
  How is anyone supposed to get behind a guy whose "films" are just home movies of the homeless and his soon-to-be homeless friends? (In one scene, a homeless woman begins to call him on it, but ends up just deriding him for being poor. "Hey, artist, do you have a dollar? I didn't think so." Oh, snap.) Or behind a blocked songwriter who spends an entire year agonizing over a song that turns out to be a bunch of moldy clichés set to power chords? Or a performance artist whose "multimedia protest" would make Laurie Anderson's eyes bleed? Only the fashion-obsessed drag queen and the uptight lawyer avoid the lethal combination of pretension, sentimentality, self-congratulation and posturing that more or less characterizes their friends' work — hey, everybody needs fashion and laws.
 
  Well, so what. "Rent" isn't about work, anyway. It's about love and death on the Lower East Side, before it became the kind of place where people would pay lots of money to see "Rent." While Angel and Tom get the issue of T-cell counts out of the way in the first few minutes, it takes Roger much longer to spill the beans to Mimi. ("You tooo?" "Me tooo.")
 
  After the flurry of the initial couplings — Tom and Angel, Mimi and Roger, Maureen and Joanne, Mark and his artistic integrity — things start to come apart. Mimi can't stay off the smack, so Roger walks away. Maureen can't stop chasing girls, so Joanne gives up. Mark gets approached by a show called "Buzzline," which loves his "hip 'n' edgy" footage of the protest and ensuing police riot, so he sells out. (It says something, though I'm not sure what, exactly, that Sarah Silverman, in a brief appearance as the slick TV executive who happily purchases Mark's hip 'n' edginess for $3,000, comes across as the only believable character in the film — she's so fake, she's real.)
 
  The most amazing thing about "Rent" (and be sure to look for that adjective on a movie poster near you, with an exclamation point attached) is how painfully dated and achingly false the movie feels, when its central concerns are real and more relevant than ever. How is that possible? Because to scratch "Rent's" Gap fashion grunge-wear surface is to hit a mother lode of disconnect and contempt for the very things it has co-opted.
 
  Is it fair, or even seemly, to expect even a modicum of authenticity or cool from a Hollywood adaptation of a Broadway musical? Probably not. But this constant corporate exhumation and trotting around of counterculture's corpse — it's not fun anymore.
 
  You know what would be fun? If Columbus had turned the story inside out and made the rapacious developers and marauding executives the heroes of the story. Why not? To the victor goes the official version, etc. At least that might have rung true.
 
  Plus, I have a great title for it. They could have called it "Own."

  In general release. 

In virtually every musical, the characters break into song to express their inner selves. But in Rent , the movie version of Jonathan Larson's exuberant pop-rock tribute to the squalid lower Manhattan bohemia of the late 1980s, the characters have almost no outer selves. When they sing, their catchy epiphanies of deep-dish feeling are all there is to them. The movie is literally a series of showstoppers, unified by the impulse to turn life, at its scruffiest, into theater  into a rhapsody of the everyday.
Rent  doesn't look like the sort of musical that would age well. A reflection of the era when AIDS was still a death sentence, it was, like Hair , a contradiction on stage: an adrenalized crowd-pleaser that romanticized the East Village culture of drag queens, drug addicts, holier-than-thou indie filmmakers, and other misfits by doing something they all would have hated  making them safe for mainstream audiences. When Rent  debuted on Broadway in 1996, the hipster-squatter vitality the show celebrated was being steamrolled by Giuliani-ization, and my reaction was just as contradictory: I melted at the gorgeous descending cascade of a song like ''Seasons of Love,'' yet the actors all blended into one another. They were a heartbeat away from the look-at-me ''creative'' brats in Fame .
All of which makes Rent , as a movie, a joyful surprise. The director, Chris Columbus, usually a meister of clunk (he made the first two Harry Potter  films and Home Alone ), has opened up the show, turning it into a far more varied and flowing entertainment. He lets his camera glide through the East Village backlot sets, luring us to the intimate center of what his singer-actors are expressing. They don't just break into song  they burst into who they are. What was sometimes oppressive on stage  all that righteous passion!  is lightened and liberated in the movie, which starts in the beat-up old loft shared by Mark (Anthony Rapp), the preppy filmmaker, and Roger (Adam Pascal), the failed rocker, and then moves out to the crumbling neighborhood, where no setting  a graffitied subway car, an HIV-positive therapy group  proves too unlikely for a song.
The plot is little more than a fragmentary series of hookups, but the actors, all but two of whom originated the roles on stage, make their presence felt. As Angel, the HIV-positive drag queen, Wilson Jermaine Heredia has a feline delicacy that erupts into chorus-line jazziness, and Idina Menzel, as Maureen the temptress performance artist, is a lioness in leather pants. Her duet with Tracie Thoms as Joanne, her jealous lover, is a high point, and so is Jesse L. Martin's wistful rendition of ''Santa Fe.'' As Mimi the exotic dancer, Rosario Dawson does ''Out Tonight'' with a howl that rivals Warren Zevon's. Time has been kind to the impoverished but sexy middle-class dropouts of Rent , who no longer come off as Broadway-mall versions of the last urban renegades in America. As they float through this dreamy soap operetta, what shines through is the beauty of Larson's bohemia: not to be a rebel but, simply, to be alive.


"No day but today" feels like yesterday's news in the long-aborning screen version of Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer-winning rock musical, "Rent." Director Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy "La Boheme" update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions. Result is like watching a dancer with no rhythm; it approximates the moves but rarely gets an infectious groove on. Hardcore fans of the long-running Broadway show will constitute an automatic audience, but Sony is unlikely to lure the uninitiated in major numbers.
Premiered Off Broadway in 1996, the show connected with audiences via its melancholy romanticism and harnessing of the stark realities of AIDS, drugs, homelessness and life on the margins. There was the added poignancy of the tragedy of creator Larson, who died the night of final dress rehearsal, days before his 36th birthday. Eighth on the all-time Broadway list of long-runners at nearly 4,000 performances, "Rent" has now grossed more than $210 million from its New York engagement alone.
But the musical's of-the-moment edge has faded. The East Village, where the story's struggling artists, squatters, junkies and misfits reside, is now considerably more gentrified; AIDS treatment has evolved radically; and the gloomy shadow of Reaganomics and yuppie greed that hung heavily over big-city fringe-dwellers has been replaced by more insidious sociopolitical specters.
While "Rent" is not as obsolete as other film versions of zeitgeist-specific musicals -- like "Godspell" or "Hair" -- nor as leaden as last year's "Phantom of the Opera," it feels past its prime.
The muscular treatment by ace music producer Rob Cavallo, best known for his work with Green Day, supplies driving power to the songs that's rarely matched in the narrative, while Columbus' cluttered idea of how to film a musical seems to reference "Fame" in its repeated dancing on tables and seemingly endless running through trash-strewn streets holding hands.
The film opens with the show's best known song, "Seasons of Love," which onstage kicks off the second act but here strives for emotional peaks with characters we have yet to meet.
Columbus then pumps up the title song into an angry bohemian anthem, with main characters and hoards of extras railing against the insanity of modern life from their fire escapes in an Alphabet City saturated with graffiti, rubble and trashcan fires.
The show has always been something of an inelegant narrative jumble held together by empathy for its characters. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky does little to alter that, supplying threadbare dialogue that stitches one song to the next without weaving a dramatic fabric.
The central thread of downtowners battling to survive, connect and cultivate some kind of artistic purity in an increasingly soulless corporate world is still there. But the threat of eviction, of being forced to sell out, or of succumbing to illness or drug addiction never acquires much urgency.
Chbosky's chief effort to update the material -- and the movie's most dialogue-heavy scene -- is a protracted country club engagement party for lesbian couple Maureen (Idina Menzel) and Joanne (Tracie Thoms), seemingly designed to mine the gay-marriage debate for contempo relevance.
Forays into an AIDS support group attended by Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and his drag queen lover Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) have a pallid, seen-it-before feel and the film only acquires emotional weight when death touches the band of friends directly late in the action. While aspiring filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) remains the story's designated guide, shooting events for his 16mm documentary, the character lacks dimension here, leaving the film rudderless.
Too often, Columbus adheres to a familiar music-video idiom: When stymied songwriter Roger (Adam Pascal) recaps his brief, blazing success and doomed love in "One Song Glory," the scene seems like recycled Aerosmith; the same character's escape to New Mexico in "What You Own" appears to have been lifted from the Bon Jovi '80s vaults.
Perhaps the most successful efforts to breathe new visual life into the numbers come in "Tango: Maureen," which shifts into a fantasy of formation tango dancers on a marble-floored subway station; and half of "Out Tonight," in which heroin-addicted gogo-dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson) does some steamy bump-and-grinding in micro-shorts in a sleaze bar, abandoned too early for yet more exuberant running through the streets.
While the decision to enlist most of the show's original cast (Rapp, Pascal, Martin, Heredia, Menzel and Taye Diggs all created their characters on stage) will please diehard Rentheads, it raises awkward questions as to why these people, some of them clearly pushing 40, are still floundering in artsy aimlessness. While there's a general charisma shortage, the actors all do OK, with Dawson, Thoms and Martin finding more emotional nuances than most. But Columbus and Chbosky have not succeeded in making them vivid figures for anyone not already invested in the characters through prior familiarity.
On the tech side, Howard Cummings' production design trowels on the gritty texture and costumer Aggie Guerard Rodgers outfits the cast in thrift-store boho chic; Stephen Goldblatt's widescreen lensing is disappointingly tame and undynamic for a musical, often blighted by poor composition.

Time has not been kind to Rent . It hurts to say this because I was a Rent  head, for about 15 minutes, back when I was younger and less demanding. I even camped out in front of the Nederlander Theatre for $20 rush ticketsseveral times. I'd been mesmerized by the characters, a mess of young artists, misfits, and outcasts falling in and out of love, trying to make it in the city without selling out. They were white, black, Latino, Asian, straight, queer, and in between, squatters, junkies, drag queens, strippers, squeegee men, and lawyers. It was unlike any musical I'd ever seen.
But the truth is that by the time Rent  opened on Broadway almost a decade ago, it was already a period piece. Giuliani had made the squeegee men disappear, and he'd sent snipers and a tank into the East Village  to clear out the squats. At the time, I'd thought the show survived with relevance and immediacy intact. In fact, the source material, Henri Murger 's serial Scénes de la Vie de Bohéme , was 150 years old. Puccini 's opera remains a cornerstone of the repertoire to this day (Leoncavallo's version, not so much). For his 1990 Australian Opera production, Baz Luhrmann  moved the story up to the 1950s (a post-Rent  version had a brief Broadway run). With Rent , composer-writer-lyricist Jonathan Larson  threw out all of Puccini except a few bars of Musetta's waltz. He traded 19th-century Latin Quarter for modern-day Alphabet City, TB for HIV, and verismo for pop rock, reassigned some genders, then legendarily died of an aortic aneurysm, at age 35, hours after the final dress rehearsal.
Chris Columbus 's movie version, on the other hand, is not an update so much as a throwback. His East Village bears no resemblance to the neighborhood that's now home to Kmart  and Starbucks  and shiny million-dollar condos (not to mention Voice  World Corporate Headquarters), where rents have bubbled up out of reach for most bohemiansand probably several cast members. Stephen Chbosky 's screenplay sets the action in 1989 and 1990, re-created here with the excruciating period detail of a Merchant Ivory  epic. Except for a digressive trip to New Mexico that I swear was a Bon Jovi  video back in the '80s, Columbus curatorially preserves many aspects of the original Broadway transfer, replicating bits of choreography, props, and costumes, often with unintended outcomes. (The iconic striped scarf Mark wears both onstage and on-screen doesn't represent individualism anymore, now that the Gap sells it.) Instead of bringing a universal love story to the living present, the film traps it in a frozen past like a prehistoric bug in amber, as removed from moviegoers' experience as a dusty diorama at the American Museum of Natural History . I was reminded of the unhip hippies in Milos Forman 's Hair , released 12 long years after the Summer of Love, at the height of the disco era. Rent  is about as timely now as Gigi .
Many in the energetic original cast reprise their roles, with varying results. While I welcomed the familiar faces like old friends, it's been a long decadepart of me wanted to yell at the screen, "You're pushing 40! Get a job!" The most notable exception, Rosario Dawson , replaces Daphne Rubin-Vega  as Mimi, the world's hottest heroin addict with AIDS. Anthony Rapp  has grown into the role of the budding indie filmmaker Mark; he clearly benefits from the script's stronger focus on his character as central observer and narrator. Idina Menzel  and Wilson Jermaine Heredia  still amaze, although she's more shrill than I remember her onstage. Jesse L. Martin , late of Law & Order , has lost some of his voice and much of his fervor. The same could be said of Adam Pascal , whose impassioned Roger has cooled down to a tepid brooding. Maybe Columbus directed the stage actors to tone down their performances for the camera, or maybe it's the age difference between the two leads (he's nine years her senior), but the attraction between Roger and Mimi fails to ignite. These junkies have no chemistry.
