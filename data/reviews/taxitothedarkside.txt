On Dec. 5, 2002, a 22-year-old rural Afghan taxi driver named Dilawar, suspected of ferrying terrorists, was picked up by U.S. forces and imprisoned at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Five days later, the prisoner was dead, his legs beaten to such a literal pulp while his wrists were chained overhead that his death was ruled a homicide on the coroner's report. Like a guided road trip through a hell of our nation's own making, the usefully horrifying documentary Taxi to the Dark Side  follows a map that leads from Dilawar's death in Bagram to the notorious prison abuses in Iraq's Abu Ghraib to policies in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, and from ground-level soldiers all the way up to the implied sanction of the Vice President of the United States. (It was Dick Cheney who articulated the necessity of being able to work through ''the dark side'' to achieve U.S. intelligence aims in the war on terror.) As argued by filmmaker Alex Gibney with controlled despair and outrage, the headline-making human rights violations ascribed, at the time of the Abu Ghraib scandal, to a ''few bad apples'' are in fact the result of fear turned into institutional madness, in lawless contradiction of the Geneva Conventions  and generally accepted conventions of humanity.
Gibney, who won awards for Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room , also served as executive producer of No End in Sight . And here, as in that vital Iraq doc, he achieves maximum force with the direct testimony of many involved in Dilawar's life and death, including the soldiers assigned to his interrogation and the journalists who first investigated the story. But where No End  is cool and measured, Taxi  is hot, anguished, and sometimes as difficult to watch as pictures of torture ought to be, with the damning Abu Ghraib footage in particularly clear focus. Occasionally, extraneous production flourishes  tricky graphic design, redundantly ominous music  push harder than necessary to tell the story. Then again, if music and shocking pictures are key to consciousness-raising, then hey, crank them up.

 A year from now, the presidency of George W. Bush will end, but the consequences of Mr. Bush’s policies and the arguments about them are likely to be with us for a long time. As next Jan. 20 draws near, there is an evident temptation, among many journalists as well as politicians seeking to replace Mr. Bush, to close the book and move ahead, an impulse that makes the existence of documentaries like Alex Gibney’s “Taxi to the Dark Side” all the more vital. If recent American history is ever going to be discussed with the necessary clarity and ethical rigor, this film will be essential.  Mr. Gibney directed “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” and was an executive producer of Charles Ferguson’s “No End in Sight,” films that show the same combination of investigative thoroughness and moral indignation that animates “Taxi.” The germ of this documentary’s story is the case of Dilawar, a taxi driver who was detained in Afghanistan in 2002 and who died in American custody at the prison in Bagram a few months later. Though Dilawar was never charged with any crime — and was never shown to have any connection with Al Qaeda or the Taliban — he was subjected to horrifically harsh treatment: deprived of sleep; suspended from a grated ceiling by his wrists; kicked and kneed in the legs until he could no longer stand.  The film includes remarkably frank interviews with American servicemen, some of whom faced courts-martial in connection with Dilawar’s death; with a fellow prisoner at Bagram; and with  Carlotta Gall and Tim Golden, who reported on  Dilawar’s story for The New York Times. “Taxi to the Dark Side,” however, does not simply recount a single, awful anecdote from the early days of the war on terror; rather, it traces the spread of a central, controversial tactic in that war. The burden of Mr. Gibney’s argument, laid out soberly and in daunting detail, is that what happened to Dilawar was not anomalous, but rather represented an early instance of what would soon be a widespread policy.  From Bagram in 2002, “Taxi to the Dark Side” charts a path to Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, all the while insisting that the brutal treatment of prisoners in those places was hardly the work of a few “bad apples,” as Pentagon officials said.  Instead, the sexual humiliation, waterboarding and other well-documented practices were methods sanctioned at the very top of the chain of command. How those methods were intended to work — to break down psychological defenses, to induce not only physical discomfort but also a kind of madness — is laid out in interviews with behavioral scientists, and also with professional interrogators and their victims.  Though Mr. Gibney’s own views are evident throughout, he does allow those who defend the use of torture on legal and strategic grounds to have their say. By now, surely, the empty semantic debate about the appropriateness of the word torture has been settled, but it is still important to recall that in the months after the 9/11 attacks, the willingness to consider the necessity of extreme and previously taboo tactics was widespread. It was Vice President Dick Cheney who noted in a television interview that the fight against Islamic extremism would necessitate a trip to “the dark side,” as administration lawyers prepared (and later publicly defended) briefs and memos limiting habeas corpus and the applicability of the Geneva Conventions.  “Taxi to the Dark Side” includes an interview with the former Justice Department official John Yoo and clips of former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales responding to their critics. And its essential fair-mindedness (which is not the same as neutrality) strengthens the film’s accounting of the consequences, both strategic and moral.  Jack Clooney, a longtime F.B.I. interrogator, argues that kindness can be a more effective way to manipulate a prisoner and gain information than cruelty, while young men who worked at Bagram and Abu Ghraib testify to the atmosphere of sadism in those places. Their matter-of-fact tone provides, in some ways, the most powerful support for Mr. Gibney’s view of the corrosive effects of torture on American traditions of decency and the rule of law.  His film is long, detailed and not always easy to watch. Plenty of moviegoers would happily pay  not to think about the issues raised in “Taxi to the Dark Side.” But sooner or later we will need to understand what has happened in this country in the last seven years, and this documentary will be essential to that effort.  “Taxi to the Dark Side” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for disturbing images and content involving torture and graphic nudity.

Photos and video of torture at Bagram and Abu Ghraib are the most viscerally disturbing elements of "Taxi to the Dark Side," but the way soft-spoken soldiers were transformed into beasts with the tacit approval of the higher-ups is just as profoundly chilling. Hard-hitting docu by Alex Gibney uses an Afghan cab driver beaten to death at Bagram to explore the deliberately ambiguous rules governing interrogation, making clear the devastating psychological toll on everyone involved. Jettisoning parts already covered in other docus would hone impact, but pic's significance is undiminished, and biz should reflect its power.
Gibney ("Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room") has crafted more than just an important document of systemic abuse -- he's stripped the rhetoric from official doublespeak to expose a callous disregard for not only the Geneva Conventions but the vision of the Founding Fathers. All enemies in wartime are perceived as animals, but Gibney uncovers the ways the White House and Pentagon have encouraged torture while distancing themselves from responsibility.
In December 2002, an Afghan taxi driver named Dilawar was brought to Bagram Air Force Base, accused of being the trigger man in a rocket attack. Five days later he was dead, his legs so pulpified that, had he lived, they would have needed to be amputated. Marshalling an impressive array of interviewees, from interrogators to journalists, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) to law prof John Yoo, Gibney divides the docu into focal sections, each one adding an additional layer to hammer the message home.
He doesn't always get the balance right: A discussion of waterboarding would work better in the earlier sections dealing with other types of torture, and jumping to Guantanamo Bay and the issue of habeas corpus goes over ground featured in other docus. The info is certainly relevant, but Gibney's powerful treatment of the issues through the prism of Dilawar and his death throws an immediate, supremely affecting light on a tragedy encompassing much more than one man's homicide, and doesn't need the extended expansion.
The military stated Dilawar died of natural causes, but New York Times journalist Carlotta Gall tracked down his family and a death certificate that plainly labeled his case a homicide. Only when the press got hold of the story did the military begin to investigate, with the Pentagon offering up a few sacrificial rank-and-file soldiers, trusting the officer class would weather the storm unscathed. Which is precisely what happened.
Gibney meticulously piles up the evidence for both sanctioned torture and cover-ups. He takes an admirably nonjudgmental view of the court-martialed privates and specialists involved in Dilawar's beatings, revealing deliberately ambiguous policy directives that encouraged torture. Soldiers follow orders, pic is saying, and monstrous behavior escapes notice only with the commanders' tacit approval.
Torture methods are methodically described, and in one sequence Gibney discreetly re-creates the techniques used in black-and-white, with logbook entries detailing the procedures. Deeply upsetting but never gratuitous, these scenes, and discussions of how the military and CIA use the most inhumane forms of sensory deprivation and humiliation, are backed up by interviews, all superbly edited by Sloane Klevin.
Like 93% of all prisoners at Bagram, Dilawar was arrested by Afghan militiamen for a cash payment -- several weeks after his death, the man who brought him in was himself arrested for the attacks attributed to the innocent taxi driver. Gibney allows his father, a naval interrogator during World War II, to voice the righteous outrage he hitherto withheld, wrapping the docu up with an excoriating blast of indignation and true patriotism.

At the crosswalk the other day, I noticed something peeking out from the usual pasting of flyers on the light pole in front of me. It looked like an address label. In a nondescript font was printed: "OUT OF IRAQ "a plea unlikely to persuade any policymakers who happened to pass by. I had that familiar "Why bother?" feeling I've been getting from the regular indictments of the Bush administration cropping up in specialty theaters, most of which marry passion and (presumably) the best of intentions to ignorable, mundane technique.
Alex Gibney , by virtue of formal discipline, does something else. Staying on the current-events beat after his 2005 Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room , he aims to make ripped-from-the- headlines j'accusations that are also durable documents with Taxi to the Dark Side . Per Henry James , "Morality is hotbut art is icy!", Gibney looks to strike a compromise. His take on U.S. torture, Taxi  is an impressively blueprinted work. Still imagesfrom autopsy tables, makeshift holding cells, the Oval Office are selected and deployed to maximum effect. There's choice original footage from a guided visit to Gitmo , where a guard likely handpicked for tour detail because of her genial Midwestern-matron quality obliviously discusses the introduction of cake into the prisoner diet.
The title refers to the cab driven by an Afghan man named Dilawar. Picked up as a suspect in a rocket attack in 2002, he was placed in the custody of U.S. soldiers at the Bagram "Collection Point." Within five days, Dilawar was dead from the injuries he sustained from beatings to the legs, complicated by the trauma of being left spread-eagled and handcuffed to the ceiling of his cell.
That Dilawar's Afghan capturers were brigands in the habit of trading captives for cash and that he was, very possibly, innocent are mentioned, but Gibney doesn't make one man's exoneration by reasonable doubt the capstone of his argument. Rather, Dilawar's story is used as the entryway into a larger discussion of systems, as his prison cell opens onto a broad study of American interrogation tactics as they've developed in the years following 9/11, spreading first from Bagram, then to Abu Ghraib , then to Guantánamo.
Among the interviewees are the soldiers eventually put on trial for abuse, who discuss the fatal disciplines that they administered. (Gibney doesn't reveal the soldiers' full involvement until after you've gotten to know them, so to speaka terrific decision). For Gibney, Dilawar's death is attributable to "bad barrels," not "bad apples"; Taxi  suggests they were symbolic sacrifices by policymakers who improperly trained interrogators and tacitly approved Geneva Conventionviolating methodologies. The "Dark Side" in question comes from the vice president's appearance on Meet the Press   on September 16, 2001: "We also have to work . . . sort of the dark side. . . . It is a mean, nasty, dangerous dirty business out there, and we have to operate in that arena." The film also suggests a literal interpretation: The lights are out, and nobody knows what they're doing.
Playing loose with history has become a habit of contemporary dissidence, though nothing discredits protesters more than that "Bush=Hitler" equation. Taxi  refers imploringly to a bygone yesteryear of American ethical superioritya strong emotional pull, but a little too pie-eyed for my tastes. A historian of torture traces waterboarding as far back as the Spanish Inquisition; antique woodcut images illustrate the point, as to suggest the nearly medieval depths to which U.S. policy has sunk. OK, but this overlooks the essential difference between a 15th-century campaign of forced conversion and a 21st-century government's response to an actual security crisis; it's a cheap point that a movie as smart as this doesn't need to score. (More pertinent than Torquemada is, say, contemporary Israel , a country that's wrangled for decades with many of the same questions the U.S. now faces in treating detainees.)
Gibney's experts answer the central question"Does torture ever  work?"with something close to a pat "No," but maybe Taxi  has to cut messy issues clean, so they'll fit as building blocks in its splendid polemic architecture. When you step back, it is something to admire: Without cheapening the suffering of American or Afghan, the film retrieves the torture issue from the realm of the abstract and gives the plain facts of this world right now. As long as we still care about people and power, they will matter.
