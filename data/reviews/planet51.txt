I'm tempted to think this animated, yawningly kiddie-friendly potboiler is reverse-engineered from the really cool bits of all the classic Cold War science-fiction films of the Fifties, possibly at the behest of some clandestine PsyOps cabal working out of Area 51. That in itself is not always a bad thing, of course. Tim McCanlies' marvelous The Iron Giant
 flawlessly manages to incorporate the hoary (but no less relevant) tropes of genre masterpieces, such as It Came From Outer Space
 and Invaders From Mars
, into one of the best sci-fi-oriented animated kids films of all time. But Planet 51
 is strictly geared toward tykes who'd sooner eat their brussels sprouts than deign to watch black-and-white humanist scientists, such as Fifties stars Richard Carlson or John Agar, save mankind from its own self-defeating paranoia and who probably would consider The Iron Giant
's 2-D animation the equivalent of being held back a year in middle school for coloring outside their minds. A co-production of Madrid-based Ilion Animation, UK indie heavyweights HandMade Films (founded, no less, by former Beatle George Harrison), and Spanish television network Antena 3, Planet 51
 is innocuous to the point of distraction � the kids at the screening I caught were noticeably antsy. While the CG animation is colorful and vibrant, the story � penned by Shrek
 co-writer Joe Stillman � is little more than a compilation of genre clich�s that were already old hat by the time Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone
 episode "The Little People" first aired in 1962. Planet 51
's main gag is the reversal of the ancient (by Hollywood standards, anyway) genre convention of society's fear of alien invasion. Here, it's the green-skinned, droopily antennaed aliens
 who are terrified of a lone human
 spaceman (Johnson), who crash-lands into their world. In a sop to Hollywood�s golden age of science-fiction filmmaking, the whole planet closely parallels Fifties Americana, right down to the Happy Days
 slang and the monster-movie matinees playing at the local movie theatre. Johnson's astronaut Chuck just wants to go home, of course, but the greenie military rep (Oldman) and token mad scientist Professor Kipple (Cleese) would prefer that this bumbling menace from beyond the stars stick around long enough to expire and, uh, donate his hideous alien brain to science. Chuck finds an ally in space-mad tween Lem (Long) and his not-quite girlfriend Neera (Biel). I could go on and on about Planet 51
's multitude of direct references to its sci-fi antecendents (Robert Wise's original The Day the Earth Stood Still
 is referenced ad nauseam), but the bottom line is that Planet 51
, while expertly executed animationwise and passably entertaining for very young kids (less so for their parents), is still as dull as the hull on Rocketship X-M
.

As a wise frog once remarked, it’s not easy being green. Not only are the emerald-colored extraterrestrials in “Planet 51’’ terrified by the appearance of a human astronaut on their home turf, they’re imprisoned in a cruddy, reductive version of “Happy Days’’ and forced to spout inane dialogue. Young children and adults with high pain thresholds will enjoy the movie during its brief pause on the way to your On Demand menu.
The planet of the title is home to a complacent race of noseless humanoids who speak English and whose culture has made it up to the “Grease’’ era of drive-in restaurants and cheesy sci-fi invasion movies. When an actual rocket ship comes to ground, the inhabitants panic, sending cocky American Chuck Baker (voiced by Dwayne “The Rock’’ Johnson) running for cover. He’s taken in by teenage misfit Lem (Justin Long), who hides him from a warlike general (Gary Oldman) and a mad scientist (John Cleese) after the human’s brain.
“Planet 51’’ is a cargo-cult movie  - a piece of pop-culture flotsam that exists by scavenging pieces of other, better films. The astronaut has a pet robot that should fascinate Pixar’s lawyers: It’s an uncanny fusion of WALL-E and Eve. There’s the expected visual call-out to “E.T.’’ (silhouettes against the moon) and pet dogs that are peppy, pint-size versions of the beast in “Alien’’ (the best gag in the movie). As a whole, “Planet 51’’ plays like a debased inversion of “The Day the Earth Stood Still,’’ the 1951 original of which is still probably the best first sci-fi movie for kids.
This telling is fast, shiny, short, and cheerful, and it does give small minds some cultural relativism along with their popcorn. (Wait, who are
 the aliens here?) It’s also obnoxiously written, with too many cutesy-dirty double-entendres that are meant to appeal to the grown-ups but that only make the movie seem cringingly infantile. Screenwriter Joe Stillman worked on the first two “Shrek’’ movies, but his more telling credit may be “Beavis and Butt-head Do America.’’
“Planet 51’’ is most interesting as an attempt by the Spanish CGI company Ilion Animation to bootstrap its way into the big leagues by hiring Hollywood talent to write the script and perform the roles. The actors are all perfectly adequate (though I’d love to know what went through Cleese’s head), but no one at Pixar
 or DreamWorks Animation will lose sleep after seeing the brightly cluttered visuals here. You can’t buy wonder, and without it “Planet 51’’ is just one more throwaway toy.

It takes only one look at the rigid, rubbery aliens in this sci-fi spoof to know that we aren't dealing with topflight computer animation here. But Planet 51  still delivers a few pleasant surprises, including a smart story  a reverse-E.T.  riff that plops an American astronaut down in a world of just-like-us-only-green creatures  and clever characters, like a lovable NASA rover with canine programming. He's no WALL·E, but you'd have to be an alien yourself not to smile when he starts wagging his antenna like a robot beagle.


 The agreeable but flagrantly unoriginal “Planet 51” belongs to the mix-and-match school of animated moviemaking that operates on the plaintive hope that familiarity is the surest path to the box office. Almost every element of the film, created by Ilion Animation Studios, based in Madrid, is borrowed from earlier films, then tweaked (and invariably softened) to become a reference rather than a copy.  Directed by Jorge Blanco,  from a story by Joe Stillman, it portrays the inhabitants of Planet 51 in a faraway galaxy as smaller,  green, Shrek-like creatures with antennas, webbed feet and squished noses. They go into a tizzy when a flag-toting American astronaut, Charles, or Chuck,  Baker (voiced by Dwayne Johnson, a k a the Rock), sets down on their territory. At his side is an intrepid, seemingly indestructible, rock-collecting little robot (R2-D2 meets Wall-E) of doglike loyalty named Rover, minus the personality quirks of its forerunners.  When Chuck arrives, Lem (Justin Long), a 16-year-old sci-fi dweeb and a budding astronomer who works at a mountain observatory, becomes his protector and (in shades of “E.T.”), hides the astronaut in his suburban bedroom. Lem has a crush on his independent-minded neighbor Neera (Jessica Biel), a teenage Miss Piggy with plump lips who is there strictly to give the movie a dollop of tepid romance.  Other references include a lamppost dance to the tune of “Singin’ in the Rain,” a blast of “Also Sprach Zarathustra” (from “2001: A Space Odyssey”) and a comic routine by Chuck that quotes from half a dozen sci-fi classics.  A central joke of the movie is that Planet 51 is a comic-book version of 1950s America, with its popular songs (“Long Tall Sally” and “Lollipop” are heard), its taste in science fiction and its flying-saucer paranoia.  It is of no comfort to the planet’s fearful populace that Chuck is a vain, dim-witted, aw-shucks ladies’ man, who happens to speak the same language (English), despite coming from 20 billion miles away. (The movie doesn’t bother to make anything of the coincidence.) Chuck barely knows how to operate a spacecraft, having coasted the distance on autopilot.  When the inhabitants are told that he is an evil alien, wielding mind control that will turn them into zombies, they believe it. Leading the charge against Chuck and Rover are General Grawl (Gary Oldman) and his ally Professor Kipple (John Cleese), a mad scientist spouting outlandish nonsense who is intent on extracting the astronaut’s brain for research.  Early on, the movie turns into a protracted game of hide-and-seek in which the big bad army (portrayed as a bunch of gun-crazy incompetents mugging ferocity) pursues and captures Chuck and keeps him in a subterranean military base. It remains for Lem and his pal Skiff (Seann William Scott), among a handful who recognize that Chuck is friendly, to help him escape and return to Earth, and for Chuck to become  serious about taking command.  Although “Planet 51” aspires to the same tone as the “Shrek” movies (Mr. Stillman was one of several screenwriters on the first two “Shrek” films), the dialogue lacks the facetious bite of its antecedents, in which the wisecracks never stop while gently pushing the envelope. The timidity of “Planet 51,” which doesn’t even make a pretense of subversion, owes partly to its being pitched to a younger audience and partly to its creators’ paucity of wit. Many opportunities for sharper satire are squandered, and what mild humor there is peters out in a final burst of triumphal ickiness.  “Planet 51” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mild off-color jokes.

A high concept gets low execution in "Planet 51," a lame-brained toon that even kids will recognize as an insipid goof on sci-fi conventions. Any number of things have and could still be done with the idea of picturing a space-voyaging Earthling as a scary alien from the point of view of another planet's inhabitants, but there's nothing funny, provocative or involving about what "Shrek" co-writer Joe Stillman and the team from Madrid-based Ilion Animation Studios do with the notion here. Sony release will serve as family-aud holiday season filler until bigger titles arrive.
One can only speculate that too many cooks were part of the problem, as this meager effort credits three directors, four idea men and 13 executive producers. It isn't even that the central concept is bad: An American astronaut arrives on a planet he believes is uninhabited, only to find a civilization startlingly similar to '50s small-town Middle America, right down to the paranoia about imminent alien invasion. 
The problem doesn't lie in the reversal of the cliche, but in the fact that the picture trades in nothing but them. The astronaut, Capt. Charles "Chuck" Baker (voice by Dwayne Johnson), is a red-headed, red-blooded he-man, while the locals, beginning with lowly planetarium worker Lem (Justin Long), are mostly dweeby types who resemble "Shrek"-green humans who make up in moppy hair and forehead antennae what they lack in noses. Chuck and Lem initially freak each other out before the latter helps protect the former from zealous know-nothings, led by imperious Gen. Grawl (Gary Oldman) and so-smart-he's-crazy Professor Kipple (John Cleese), who can't wait to separate Chuck from his brain for scientific purposes.
Beginning with the way Chuck and Lem blithely toss off as a curious coincidence the fact that they happen to speak the same language, their utter lack of curiosity about each other and their respective worlds is ridiculous; even "Jimmy Neutron," which "Planet 51" rather resembles in its look and setting, took a greater interest in the society it depicts than this does.
Instead, the picture devotes itself to tiresomely repetitive scenes of frenzied jeopardy, accompanied by music that shifts gears every 15 seconds to underline whatever response is desired and larded with refs to famous antecedents ("The Day the Earth Stood Still," "2001," "Star Wars," "E.T.," "Alien," et al.) and an innocuous putative romance between Lem and neighbor Neera (Jessica Biel). 
Pic quickly grows aggravating because it's clear there's no imagination in play, only the recycling of familiar motifs and the attempted generation of Pavlovian responses based on expected character behavior and generic action. But it might have been worse: Its defects could have been magnified by 3D.

Like E.T.  in reverse, this pleasantly mediocre CG animation tale lands an astronaut on a distant planet whose green, four-fingered, newt-ish inhabitants are living in an innocent, 1950s-style state of development. Fearing the brain-eating "humaniacs" they see at the movies, the Planet 51ers naturally view spaceman Chuck (voiced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson ) as a monsterexcept timid green teen Lem (Justin Long ), who saves Chuck from the mob: "Mom, can I keep him?" Handsome doofus Chuck is a chip off the Buzz Lightyear  block, but Planet 51  lacks the Pixar  polish (particularly in its writing)still, it's not a bad knockoff. The alternate-reality, Cold Warera design is cute: towns laid out like crop circles; women wearing beehives neatly coiffed above their antennae; and saucer-shaped cars wobbling inches from the pavement. Sounds picture-perfect, but before the alien can go home, Lem must thwart a paranoid general (Gary Oldman ) and win the girl next door (Jessica Biel ), which means that Chuck must act as his preeningly unreliable life coach. Fortunately, many chases and pratfalls attend their journey. The biggest laughs come from a neighborhood dog, modeled on the beast in Alien , that pees acid, and from the robotic six-wheeled NASA  rover that's strongly reminiscent of WALL-E. An awkward European-American co-production, Planet 51 mainly succeeds at reminding you of all the better movies that inspired it.
