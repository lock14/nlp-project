Have we such short memories that we have already forgotten last year's feeble Johnson Family Vacation
? Or did we like it so much that we're now crying out for more African-American family road-trip movies? Whatever the case, Are we There Yet?
 has landed here now, and despite bearing a title that practically cries out for disrespect from antsy filmgoers, the new Ice Cube picture (he stars as well as co-produces) is not as bad as it easily could have been and at least a small notch better than Johnson Family Vacation
. In Are We There Yet?
 Cube plays a player, the unencumbered Nick who scorns "breeders" and loves only his brand new Lincoln Navigator. Then he spots Suzanne (Long), who works across the street from him in Portland, Oreg. However, her two children, Lindsey (Allen) and Kevin (Bolden), are a decided romantic setback, so Nick chooses to remain in what he calls the "friend zone." Eventually, he changes his tune and plans to butter up the kids as a means of getting to the mom. Win over the kids, win the mom. Thus, when Suzanne has to travel to Vancouver on business and her ex reneges on taking the children for the weekend, Nick (and his Navigator) jump into the fray and he elects to drive the kids up to Canada himself. What he doesn�t know is that the children have made a habit of scaring off all their mom�s suitors in the childish hope that their parents will get back together. Of course, the car is in shreds before the end of the trip, but along the way everyone has nevertheless learned to love one another. Cube manifests his amiable side in this movie and shows he can headline a family picture. The children are less believable in roles that require that they range from shrewish hellions to sensitive little tykes. Star Trek
�s Nichols makes a guest appearance as a frump channeling Eartha Kitt. And the less said about the Satchel Paige bobblehead on Nick�s dashboard the better. (Its crude commentary is voiced by Morgan.) The humor and escapades are occasionally well-focused (refusal to board a plane for carrying a corkscrew) but more often rude and physically abusive. (One kidnapping joke definitely goes too far for comfort.) Are We there Yet?
 is better off left by the side of the road.


In the decade since he arrived in Hollywood, Ice Cube has played all kinds of cops, thugs, soldiers, and barbers. He even directed a movie about a strip club that's fondly thought of as the black ''Showgirls." But perhaps sensing that it might be time to do a movie he could watch with his own children, the rapper finally made himself a nice family comedy.
Whether ''Are We There Yet?" which he produced, will melt the lil' Cubes remains to be seen, but this gnarly and illogical little sitcom is bound to make any adult reconsider that next outing with the kids.
Cube plays Nick Parsons, the owner of a sports memorabilia store in Portland, Ore., and he can't stand children, especially the ones that come attached to cute bachelorettes. But he battles his disdain when he meets a single mother of two named Suzanne; since she's played by Nia Long you can understand his willingness to compromise. But you can't entirely grasp how this levelheaded woman could produce a pair of children as super-obnoxious as Lindsey and Kevin (the dangerously spunky Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden), whom Nick not inaccurately calls ''gremlins."
Suzanne's kids are so convinced that their father will rejoin their big happy home that they turn terrorist on their mother's new prospects, subjecting them to bruising contraptions thatwouldn't be out of place in ''Home Alone 12."
''I feel sorry for the next sucker that tries to put the moves on her," says Kevin's big sister. So do we, Lindsey, so do we -- though not as sorry as anyone who sticks around for the ensuing kicks to the crotch, projectile vomit, feigned asthma attacks, faked kidnappings, gassy old ladies, and a belligerent computer-enhanced deer.
There's also a terrifying scene in which Kevin urinates on a woman in a ladies public restroom, and one scarier in which Lindsey gets her hands on a live microphone and belts out a version of ''Respect" that could be sold as a car alarm.
All this foulness arises after Suzanne's ex-husband cancels their arrangement for him to bring the kids to Vancouver. She's an events coordinator and has to be there for New Year's. Dad is out, but St. Nick is in.
Of course, getting Lindsey and Kevin north of the border proves a nightmare. After being evicted from the airport (Kevin slips a pocket knife into Nick's coat), then missing the train (Kevin hops off to fetch a missing cape for his superhero toy), Nick dares drive them in his brand new Lincoln Navigator. Lining the interior with plastic and barking commandments -- don't touch the SUV, don't eat in the SUV, and so on -- is merely an invitation to destroy it.
It took four writers and director Brian Levant, who also made ''Jingle All the Way," ''The Flintstones," and ''Snow Dogs," to come up with this cartoon. Yet despite its faults, ''Are We There Yet?" is the rare movie to acknowledge the vast bandwidth of African-American identity, which extends out of the ghetto and into the suburbs and the middle class. Both kids have an allergic reaction to the music of hip-hop roughneck 50 Cent. ''I'd give him a dollar to shut up," Lindsey snipes. Kevin prefers Clay Aiken, and Nick bemoans that both children are ''ethnically challenged."
The film also has an asset in Ice Cube. He's so genuinely good with the effortless Long that you wish the two would just run off and make a real adult romantic comedy. Then again -- if you've been waiting to see the ex-NWA rapper throw tantrums and stick his tongue out at small children -- run, don't walk.


         "Are We There Yet?" gets nowhere. Its star Ice Cube remains characteristically amiable, but this thuddingly miscalculated comedy is way beneath him.
 
  The filmmakers clearly intend a family comedy about the lengths to which a guy who doesn't like kids will go when he is attracted to a woman with children — in this case kids so enamored of their departed and neglectful father and so convinced their parents will get back together that they try to scare off all their mother's potential suitors. There have been worse premises — but director Brian Levant and a clutch of writers carry this one to such extremes that they end up creating a relentlessly crass picture, not likely the effect they intended.
 


         






    Levant wastes no time in setting the film's tone: A handsome, smiling man, loaded with gifts, approaches a large Colonial-style home in an upscale Portland, Ore., neighborhood only to be attacked by a barrage of intricate bombardments worthy of a Rube Goldberg invention but in fact devised by gleeful 7-year-old Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden) and his 11-year-old sister Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) to drive him away from pursuing their attractive single mother, Suzanne (Nia Long).
 
  Meanwhile, after catching a juvenile shoplifter in the act at his sports memorabilia store, Ice Cube's Nick remarks to his employee pal (Jay Mohr) that "kids are like cockroaches except you can't squish them." Why Nick should have this attitude remains unknown, but Kevin and Lindsey will soon justify these feelings and then some, because Suzanne happens to work at a party-planning establishment across from Nick's store. Not long after they meet, Nick winds up escorting the youngsters to Vancouver, where Suzanne is helping stage a lavish New Year's Eve party.
 
  Demons at the ready, the kids sabotage travel by air and train, forcing Nick to drive them in his brand-new pride and joy, a pricey Lincoln Navigator.
 
  The 300-mile journey will give the two plenty of time to wreck the vehicle, and it's hardly giving anything away to report that they do not pass up the opportunity — for that and much, much more.
 
  The problem with the movie is that these children are such intractable, indefatigable monsters for so much of the picture that it's impossible for the filmmakers to pull off a last-reel, love-conquers-all turnaround. Not helping matters is that Suzanne remains so unaware of how horribly her children behave when she is not around that she comes off as either dense or irresponsible or both.
 
  Of course the separation of parents is traumatic for children, but Kevin and Lindsey are so out of control that they are dangerous to themselves as well as others. The makers of "Are We There Yet?" apparently saw a lot of humor in the relentless, diabolical incorrigibility of these kids. We were not amused.

It's been a while since we saw a bad John Hughes comedy, and Are We There Yet?  more than fits the bill (even though Hughes had absolutely nothing to do with it). The movie was developed and co-produced by its star, Ice Cube, and it represents a clear attempt, after the friendly and mildly provocative folkloric raunch of the Friday  and Barbershop  series, to mainstream his image even further  to prove he can be a PG player in a Hollywood increasingly devoted to family-friendly high jinks. Are We There Yet?  opens on a snowy, tree-lined residential block at Christmastime, then kicks off with two incorrigible children, 11-year-old Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and 7-year-old Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden, who has a great baby-rascal face), subjecting their divorced mother's latest suitor to a mini-version of a Home Alone  slapstick spillathon.
Welcome to Cube's version of Hughesville. Smiling more often than he has in all of his previous films and music videos combined, he plays Nick, the owner of a sports-collectibles store and an unapologetic bachelor. Nick has just purchased a spiffy new babe-mobile SUV, complete with spinning hubcaps, when he spies and falls for Suzanne (Nia Long), an elite party planner and the aforementioned single mom. The feeling is mutual, or at least could be, but her attitude is: Love me, love my kids. It's up to Nick to prove his fealty by shepherding the two junior monsters on a voyage to Vancouver.
At this point, Are We There Yet?  becomes Planes, Trains and Automobiles  with one gruff straight man in medallions and oversize sports jerseys facing off against a couple of cute brats who are too precocious for the room. It is, of course, no contest. After Kevin plants a corkscrew on Nick at airport security, the three have to travel by car, and Nick's exasperation only mounts as he's forced to listen to plastic dance pop, then hold Kevin aloft as he pees in the sink, then watch as his shiny new Navigator gets punctured, vomited on, and generally trashed mile by mile. At the end of 94 minutes, you can bet he's been converted into a faithful surrogate daddy. But will the audience follow Ice Cube on this road trip to benign banality? Here's hoping he books a nonstop return ticket.

ince he burst "Straight Outta Compton" on the record of that name in 1988, Ice Cube (born O'Shea Jackson) has gone through multiple incarnations as an entertainer, from the controversial front man for the rap group N.W.A. to film roles as the self-destructive gang member in "Boyz N the Hood" and the genial stoner in "Friday" and its sequels (of which he is also co-writer and co-producer). In the "Barbershop" films of recent years, Ice Cube began to reinvent his on-screen persona as a warmhearted family man. In the new comedy "Are We There Yet?," he takes that persona from PG-13 to PG territory, focusing on a new demographic of preteenage fans. Ice Cube plays Nick Persons, the easygoing owner of a sports memorabilia shop in Portland, Ore. Nick is a bachelor and confirmed ladies' man who hates children the way Ebenezer Scrooge hates Christmas: as a matter of principle. But when he casts his eye on a luscious divorced woman named Suzanne (Nia Long), he is forced to reconsider his antichild policy. Unfortunately for Nick, Suzanne's two children, 11-year-old Lindsey and 8-year-old Kevin (Aleisha Allen and Philip Daniel Bolden), have vowed to sabotage their mother's suitors by any means necessary, including booby-trapping the front doorstep with a carpet of slippery marbles. So Nick courts Suzanne while steering clear of the two terrors until, stuck in Vancouver on a business trip, Suzanne asks him to take the youngsters up for a visit. Their journey is predictably star-crossed: luggage is lost, planes missed and cars wrecked and abandoned, until finally Nick is chasing the children on horseback as they stow away on a boxcar. The inexorable logic of breakdown and disintegration in "Are We There Yet?" is the best thing about it; like the John Hughes comedy "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," it posits travel as a Dante-esque ordeal in which the hell of the transportation system serves as a gateway to the paradise of love and family. By the time the battle-scarred Nick and his charges arrive in Vancouver, he has become the children's de facto father. Though the presence of the always charismatic Ice Cube makes "Are We There Yet?" watchable, the movie suffers from one insurmountable problem: as scripted by a too-many-cooks screenwriting team and cloyingly played by the young actors, little Lindsey and Kevin are such insufferable brats that the hero's change of heart remains a mystery. As Nick goes from despising his young charges to dandling them on his knee, viewers are likely to experience the same process in reverse; the children are so relentlessly shrill, their behavior so dreadful and consequence-free, that childless viewers of "Are We There Yet?" (who, to be fair, are likely to be few) may find themselves rethinking their stance on reproduction. "Are We There Yet?" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains mild profanity and a few bodily fluid-related jokes.

A joyless road-trip comedy that's about as pleasant as a bad case of car sickness (which happens to be one of pic's prominent gags), "Are We There Yet?" traps the affable Ice Cube in a dismal kiddy slapstick saga that even his considerable charisma can do little to enhance. Seemingly greenlit in the wake of last year's sleeper hit "Johnson Family Vacation," pic offers past-their-prime sight gags and (literal) toilet humor, marked by a sadistic edge that may give parents pause. Bigscreen biz should be but a rest stop before this rickety vehicle parks itself in video and cable outlets.
The owner of a Portland sports memorabilia store and a reputed ladies' man, Nick Persons (Ice Cube) treats his pimped-out Lincoln Navigator like a newborn infant. As far as real children go, though, Nick considers them "like cockroaches, except you can't squish 'em."
But that's before Nick's eye is caught by sexy divorcee Suzanne (Nia Long), who runs the party planning business across the street. Soon, Nick's in hot pursuit, no matter that Suzanne is a "breeder" with two young tykes, Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden).
The kids, meanwhile, caught up in the fantasy that their mom is still in love with their deadbeat dad, are willing to do whatever it takes to prevent Suzanne from dating any other men.
When Suzanne is called away to Vancouver to plan a major New Year's Eve party, her ex, feigning sickness, bows out of baby-sitting duties. So Nick, despite every bone in his body (and the talking Satchel Paige bobblehead that serves as his Jiminy Cricketlike conscience) telling him not to, volunteers to take care of Suzanne's kids.
Thus the stage is set for a series of would-be comic mishaps in which Nick attempts, by plane, train and automobile, to take Suzanne's children to her in Vancouver in time for New Year's. Of course, Lindsey and Kevin have other ideas -- specifically, to get to their dad's house, while making every minute as miserable as possible for chauffeur Nick.
Helmer Brian Levant previously supervised similar mischief-making on such pics as "Beethoven," "Jingle All the Way" and "Snow Dogs." But even the titular devil-child of his "Problem Child 2" seems oddly angelic when compared to Lindsey and Kevin, who engage in a series of dangerous and/or unsavory antics, including convincing a kindly trucker (M.C. Gainey) that Nick is a kidnapper.
That last gag (which recurs throughout pic) seems particularly ill-conceived in light of recent high-profile child abductions, but it's of a piece with a film in which Nick, Lindsey and Kevin are frequently placed in peril.
Of course, comic violence is nothing new -- the "Home Alone" franchise thrived on it -- but there's something more violent than comic about the way Levant executes sequences here.
More problematic is the fact that Lindsey and Kevin are so shrill, self-righteous and flat-out mean that it's tough to care about them. Even the youngest members of pic's audience may be put off by the tykes' bad behavior. (At the screening reviewed, during one scene in which Nick calmly reassures the kids that the utter destruction of his car isn't really their fault, one audience member felt compelled to shout out, "Yes it is!")
When pic tries to turn sentimental in its final stretch, suggesting that Lindsey and Kevin are the victims of conflicting emotions stemming from their parents' separation, it seems particularly unbelievable.
Shot entirely in Vancouver, pic's tech aspects are strictly serviceable, with lots of the driving scenes clearly done on a soundstage. But considerable time and CGI attention does seem to have been lavished on the talking Paige doll, which ranks with the sea creatures of "The Life Aquatic" among recent movies' most unnecessary special effects.

In the days following last November's election, I saw the best minds of my generation, starving hysterical naked, andjust as if there had never been a Jimmy Carter wondering where the Democrats could possibly find a liberal evangelical Christian to run for president in 2008.
Initially well regarded by his co-religionists and then (once they saw his support for an equal-rights amendment!) anathema, Carter is a key figure in the British tele-documentary With God on Our Side . Using archival clips and talking heads to track the rise of the religious right from the Cold War crusades of Billy Graham  ("Jesus taught the value of private property") through the creation of the Moral Majority and Pat Robertson 's 1988 candidacy, With God on Our Side  convincingly maintains that the evangelical movement reached its political apotheosis in the person of born-again prodigal son George W. Bush referred to by more than one admiring Christian as the "real deal."
The 100-minute doc, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4  on the eve of the U.S. election and opening here in time for the second Bush inaugural, argues that the evangelical vote provided both Reagan's victory margin in 1980 and Bush the Elder's in 1988. (No less than Carter, Bush I turned out to be too socially liberal for the religious rightan error that his son would not repeat.) Whether or not Moral Majority organizer Paul Weyrich  and spokesman Jerry Falwell , both of whom appear understandably smug, had a master plan to gain control of the White House , one can detect a certain dialectic: Just as Carter's authentic religiosity enabled Reagan's born-again pandering, so Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes made the world safe for Dubya's sketchy past.
With God on Our Side  (which was known, more humorously, as God Bless America  in the U.K.) is certainly not as incredulous or mocking as it might have been. If anything, the mood is apprehensive. But it's depressing thatCarter asidethe filmmakers failed to find even one liberal believer.
