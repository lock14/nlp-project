ate in the historical documentary "Watermarks," Hanni Lux, an Austrian Jewish athlete who participated in a pre-Olympic ceremony in Vienna just before the 1936 Berlin games, recalls the frightening reception  that  her group - members of  a Jewish sports club, Hakoah Vienna -  received during the torch-bearing ritual.  Following another delegation that was met  with a rapturous ovation, punctuated by cries of "Heil Hitler,"  her team,  from the  club's championship women's  swimming division, was greeted  with "a silence filled with fear," she says. "We felt mass hatred," she adds. "It really was one of my most horrible experiences."  Terrified, the team ran back to the clubhouse, shut the door and hugged and kissed for a reassurance that was to be found nowhere else. Ms. Lux is one of eight Austrian-born Jewish  female athletes, now in their 80's and scattered around the world, whom the director Yaron Zilberman gathered for a pilgrimage back to Vienna. At the end of the movie, they slip into the waters of an Olympic-size pool for a final communal lap. More than 65 years earlier, the Nazis had closed their beloved club and driven them into exile. The notion of a reunion staged for the camera may be a filmmaking stunt. But it provides the raison-d'�tre of a moving documentary that approaches the Holocaust from a fresh, intimate perspective.  Personal stories trump epic, fact-filled overviews almost every time. And as "Watermarks"  flashes continually back and forth between the women today and pictures of their youthful selves, it is hard not to put yourself in their 1930's shoes and imagine their ordeal. During the 1936 Olympics, Hanni's older sister, Judith, who now lives next door to her in Israel, faced a different humiliation. The most honored member of the Austrian swim team, she and two other members resigned from it rather than compete in Berlin. She was severely punished by the Austrian Sports Federation, which stripped her of her awards and struck her name from the record books. That recognition has since been restored. At another point late in the film, the women are serenaded in a Viennese club by a cabaret singer performing the ghastly "Buchenwald Song," whose composers, Fritz Beda-L�hner and Hermann Leopoldi, imprisoned in the concentration camp, were ordered to write   as a marching song for their fellow prisoners to sing. If the film never satisfactorily explains the reason for this ghoulish moment, it leaves the same sickening impression as Ms. Lux's memories of the pre-Olympic  ceremony. Much of the rest of the film, which opens today in New York, tells the inspiring story of Hakoah Vienna (hakoah means strength in Hebrew), which was founded in 1909 after a law was passed forbidding Austrian sports clubs to admit Jews. Until then, sports had not been central to Austrian Jewish culture, which had produced Freud and Mahler, among many world-class intellectuals and artists, but no athletes of note. The success of Hakoah Vienna helped end the traditional Jewish  indifference to  sports. Weeks after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, the club was shut down. But its leaders, who fled to London, succeeded in helping most of the members emigrate on illegal ships and kept the spirit of the club alive in  newsletters. As these women tell their stories in a tone of wonderment, "Watermarks" becomes more than  a pointed footnote to the Holocaust. It emerges as a surprisingly encouraging reflection on the distance between youth and advanced age. Despite their physical frailty, the spirit of these women, many of them honored professionals in a variety of fields, remains intact, and their joy at reconnecting outweighs their uneasiness at returning to the homeland that rejected them.

Hitler aspired to wipe out the Jews but he couldn't have anticipated the tenacity of those who were in better shape than he was -- the athletes of Vienna's Hakoah sports club who, now aged between 81 and 107, are the inspiring stars of "Watermarks." Snappy, affecting docu should grab attention as a forthcoming Kino release in the U.S.
Smashing the common belief that Jews were scholarly physical weaklings, Hakoah trained Jewish athletes who beat gentiles at -- literally -- their own games. Their men's soccer team was the first-ever foreign one to beat an English team on English soil. When the players who bested West Ham United in London in 1924 dispersed to America and beyond, the club's swimming program took precedence. (Visiting competitor Johnny Weissmuller broke a world record during a Hakoah meet.)
With Stars of David prominently displayed on their trunks and swimsuits, Austria's best hopes for swimming medals at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics were Jews, particularly women. When record-holder Judith Deutsch refused to participate, she was banned from competition and her accomplishments were wiped off the national books. It took six decades for them to be reinstated.
Documaker Yaron Zilberman interviews surviving swimmers at their homes in the U.S., England and Israel, putting their formative years and long lives into perspective. Zilberman's goal is to bring seven of them back to Vienna -- which they fled in 1938 after Hitler annexed Austria -- to swim again in the pool where they set records and forged friendships.
Sometimes funny, sometimes wrenching and persistently bittersweet, tale is a fascinating account of strength and solidarity, bolstered by vintage photos, edifying newsreels and winningly frank interviews. Seg during which the now-elderly swimmers happily sing along with the songs of their youth takes an uncomfortable turn when the cabaret performer entertaining them sings a song composed in a concentration camp.
Spry interviewees are in fine form, and tech credits are pro.

In the days following last November's election, I saw the best minds of my generation, starving hysterical naked, andjust as if there had never been a Jimmy Carter wondering where the Democrats could possibly find a liberal evangelical Christian to run for president in 2008.
Initially well regarded by his co-religionists and then (once they saw his support for an equal-rights amendment!) anathema, Carter is a key figure in the British tele-documentary With God on Our Side . Using archival clips and talking heads to track the rise of the religious right from the Cold War crusades of Billy Graham  ("Jesus taught the value of private property") through the creation of the Moral Majority and Pat Robertson 's 1988 candidacy, With God on Our Side  convincingly maintains that the evangelical movement reached its political apotheosis in the person of born-again prodigal son George W. Bush referred to by more than one admiring Christian as the "real deal."
The 100-minute doc, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4  on the eve of the U.S. election and opening here in time for the second Bush inaugural, argues that the evangelical vote provided both Reagan's victory margin in 1980 and Bush the Elder's in 1988. (No less than Carter, Bush I turned out to be too socially liberal for the religious rightan error that his son would not repeat.) Whether or not Moral Majority organizer Paul Weyrich  and spokesman Jerry Falwell , both of whom appear understandably smug, had a master plan to gain control of the White House , one can detect a certain dialectic: Just as Carter's authentic religiosity enabled Reagan's born-again pandering, so Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes made the world safe for Dubya's sketchy past.
With God on Our Side  (which was known, more humorously, as God Bless America  in the U.K.) is certainly not as incredulous or mocking as it might have been. If anything, the mood is apprehensive. But it's depressing thatCarter asidethe filmmakers failed to find even one liberal believer.
