Keri Russell, with her frizzed locks and clear angelic eyes, has a look of such pert vivacity that when you first see her in Waitress , it's hard to imagine that she's anything but happy. She plays Jenna, who works in a small-town Southern pie diner that's just far enough off the main drag to seem like the last coffee shop on Earth. At this ramshackle pit stop, Jenna has her work family  her sister waitresses, plus the grouch of a cook  and she follows her bliss by creating new pies, each inspired by a different incident (''I Hate My Husband Pie,'' and so on). We see the concoctions assembled in sped-up overhead shots, each recipe more luscious than the last. It turns out that the pies are a good deal sweeter than Jenna's life.
Married to an angry, jealous control freak (Jeremy Sisto), Jenna has just learned that she's pregnant, and she's miserable about it  though in this deep-dish comedy of red-state blues, the possibility of terminating the pregnancy is never even discussed. Waitress  understands what it is to be a woman trapped. Things start to look up when Jenna meets her new ob-gyn, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), whose quizzically urgent manner and Bob Costas hair mark him as a white knight of graciousness. So she jumps his bones (even though he's married too).
Waitress  is a wee romantic charmer, a delectable Dixie screwball romp that never loses its spry sense of discovery. Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, the New York actress and filmmaker who was tragically killed last year (she appears, along with Cheryl Hines, as one of Jenna's waitress pals), the movie is always high-spirited, but it's also wistful, sexy, and melancholy. It mixes flavors as brazenly as Jenna does in her traditional yet wild desserts. Russell, in a star performance, lets each new feeling shine through her skin  there's a great sequence, scored to Cake's ''Short Skirt/Long Jacket,'' in  which she beams her way through the diner after sex  but Waitress  offers no easy resolution. What lifts the audience sky-high is the portrait of Jenna awakening, in every sense, to the life inside her. In what was, sadly, to be her last movie, Adrienne Shelly   proved a filmmaker who will long be savored.

 Stuck in a marriage to a man she loathes, inconveniently pregnant with his child, oppressed by long hours waiting tables for a grouchy boss, Jenna finds relief baking pies. As lovingly filmed as they are made, these creations serve as both therapy and art. Jenna gives them whimsical names — “I don’t want Earl’s baby pie,” for instance — and combines unlikely ingredients to unfailingly delicious effect.  Adrienne Shelly, who wrote and directed “Waitress” (and who plays one of Jenna’s co-workers), demonstrates a similar confectionary gift. The movie, her third and last feature before she was murdered in November, blends familiar elements into something both satisfying and surprising. Part feminist fable, part romantic fairy tale, it is by turns tart and sweet, charming and tough, rather like its heroine and like Keri Russell, the plucky, pretty, nimble actress (still perhaps best known as Felicity, from the television coming-of-age melodrama of the same name) who plays her.  The small-town Southern diner where Jenna works is a homey, comfortable place, and if you feel as if you’ve been there before, it is probably because you remember the movie “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” or the long-running sitcom, “Alice,” that followed it. Ms. Russell does not much resemble Ellen Burstyn or Linda Lavin, whose Alices were single mothers rather than young wives, but Ms. Shelly’s mousy, nervous, lovelorn Dawn and Cheryl Hines’s no-nonsense Becky are close kin to Vera and Flo, Alice’s reliable comic sidekicks.  Ms. Hines’s brassy turn — I waited in vain for her to say, “Kiss my grits!” — is a welcome change from her  duties as Larry David’s straight man on “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” And her zany warmth, along with Ms. Shelly’s mischievous mousiness, fill out the movie’s affectionate, comical view of workplace sisterhood.  Becky and Dawn have their own troubles, but neither would willingly trade places with Jenna, whose husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), is the main source of her misery. A babyish, possessive bully, he is fearsome when angry and annoying the rest of the time. When Jenna reluctantly tells him of her pregnancy, he makes her promise that she won’t ever love the baby more than she loves him, completely oblivious to the fact that she probably has old shoelaces she loves more than him.  Not that impending motherhood fills her with joy. Though she decides immediately to go through with the pregnancy — the word “abortion” is never uttered — the prospect of having a child thwarts her half-formed project of escape. Solace is available in increasingly frenetic pie-making, and also in the company of her obstetrician (Nathan Fillion), a new arrival in town who has an awkward, friendly manner that complements her own mixture of frankness and indecision.  Their smoldering crush quickly ignites into a full-blown affair, though Jenna preserves a measure of decorum by continuing to address him as “Doctor Pomatter.” Their romance is a rare example of movie adultery (he’s married too) without punishment or apology, and it works because both actors are so darn likable.  As is just about everything else on screen, from the pies to the waitresses’ uniforms to the snappy, pop-song rhythms of the editing. Andy Griffith shows up from time to time, playing the crusty, soft-in-the-middle owner of the diner, to lend a further twinkle of homespun Americana to a film that takes place in a carefully imagined semi-mythical realm.  It is not so much that Ms. Shelly has banished realism from her story, but rather that she has tamed and shaped it, finding a perfect, difficult-to-achieve balance of enchantment and plausibility. The story, in which resilience is rewarded, and meanness is banished, is comforting without feeling unduly sentimental, thanks to its mood of easygoing, tolerant honesty. If “Waitress” were more strenuously uplifting, it might be labeled a feel-good movie, but it isn’t that. It’s just a movie that leaves you feeling good.  Except, that is, for a real-world shadow that inevitably falls across its bright surface. Last year Ms. Shelly was killed in a Manhattan apartment she used as an office  after the movie had been finished and accepted at Sundance, but before audiences could see it. She was 40, with some fine work as an actress behind her (notably in the Hal Hartley films “Trust” and “The Unbelievable Truth”) and her long flowering as a filmmaker still ahead.  Knowledge of her senseless, untimely death makes the final scenes of “Waitress” especially painful to watch, and the sturdy, modest accomplishment of the film can hardly begin to make up for the loss. But it is something: it is lovely, touching and infused with life.  “Waitress” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some sex and some swearing, but all in all, as sweet as pie.

The Sundance premiere of "Waitress," less than three months after writer-director Adrienne Shelly's tragic death at age 40, was indeed bittersweet: While the film may not be world-shaking, this warm and accomplished seriocomedy shows a talent much matured since Shelly's two prior directorial feature outings, "Sudden Manhattan" and "I'll Take You There." While aspects verge on sitcom terrain, this tale of a pregnant small-town woman caught between a bad marriage and a risky affair is mostly as funny and charming as intended. Fox Searchlight pic could do nice biz among adult femme auds, with easy transition to tube and rental play. 
Jenna (Keri Russell) is a "pie genius," having inherited her late mother's gift for thinking up scrumptiously imaginative baked goods. (The desserts provide a mouth-watering visual motif thanks to Matthew Irving's heightened-color lensing.) Each day, her latest creation and established favorites draw loyal customers to Joe's Pie Shop in a small Southern town. 
But Jenna's life seems to have hit an unpleasant dead end: Husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) is loutish and controlling, and that's killed her affection for him. She yearns to leave him but has nowhere to go -- and there's enough threat of violence in his demeanor that she squirrels away tip money, thinking her only option is to make a dash for freedom once she can support herself for a while. 
So she's not at all happy to discover at film's start that she's pregnant (from a now-rare, alcohol-induced night of marital sex). Figuring her predicament isn't the baby's fault, she won't abort, but she won't tell Earl about it either, hopeful she can bolt before he notices. 
For a while, the only person who knows besides Jenna is new town medico Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), with whom she shares an almost immediate, overwhelming and most inappropriate mutual attraction. 
Meanwhile, at the diner, it's business as usual. Manager Cal (Lew Temple) yells at everybody. Mousy fellow waitress Dawn (Shelly), looking for love, finds it with a man (Eddie Jemison) who initially repulses her. Brassy Becky (Cheryl Hines), married to a "senile invalid," is dallying with someone whose identity she won't reveal. The restaurant's cantankerous owner Old Joe (Andy Griffith) comes in to enjoy Jenna's pies and pry into her personal affairs, though he's more softhearted than he lets on. 
Soon she and the handsome doc are having a torrid affair, even as her pregnancy advances -- far enough that Earl can no longer be kept in the dark. Still, she hopes to flee somehow. When she finally makes her decision, however, it's refreshingly a simple psychological shift rather than the result of a melodramatic or comedic contrivance. 
Film has an occasional case of the cutes, and the diner dynamic is a bit too much like that on late-'70s sitcom "Alice."
But for the most part, Shelly the director exhibits enough restraint and deftness to muffle her screenplay's potential for pat dramedy. 
A big help in that regard is Russell's terse, down-to-earth perf, which nicely grounds the pic's serious side and provides useful contrast against the enjoyable, often broader supporting turns. Helmer gets mileage out of those reined-in emotions when they suddenly burst, in a sweetly funny montage in which Jenna can't stop beaming with sudden love for the doc. 
Sisto avoids making Earl a stock redneck ghoul, lending him both menace and a certain pathos, as well as enough hick haplessness to keep the airy pic from being dragged into overly grim domestic-violence terrain. Fillion's smitten physician is a goofy charmer. 
Presumably completed in post after Shelly's death (she was murdered in her Manhattan apartment), "Waitress" is lovingly assembled on all levels, with careful attention to vibrant design aspects that look good enough to eat.

Mildly quirky and zealously cute, Adrienne Shelly 's Waitress  is the story of three irrepressible gal pals slinging pie and shooting the shit in a postcard-perfect small town diner. Bearing their sitcom burdens lightly, they are: Becky (Cheryl Hines ), the feisty, chain-smoking slut; Dawn (Shelly), the quiet geek; and Jenna (Keri Russell ), our heroine, a plucky everywoman with life lessons to face, pies to bake, and oodles of clever voice-over to uncork.
Schematic discontent arises from Jenna's unhappy marriage to Earl (Jeremy Sisto ), a poorly written boor who begs for love at the end of a fist. Jenna dreams of winning a local pie contest and skipping town untilo, cruel fate of the Inciting Incident!an unwanted pregnancy complicates her plans. Cue voice-over and a precious pastry motif: "Recipe for Baby Screaming Its Head Off in the Middle of the Night and Ruining My Life Pie..."
Wearily electing to keep the kid while hiding it from Earl, Jenna tumbles into the nervous hands of Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion ), gentleman OB-GYN. Before you can say "Independent Spirit Awards ," she's baking pies for Dr. Feelgood and submitting to an examination of the heart. ("I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong and I Don't Want Earl to Kill Me Pie.")
Will Jenna and the doc's romance flower? Will Dawn find a boyfriend? Does pie make the world go round? Will there be chipper pop songs and milquetoast feminism? Could someone pass me the barf bucket?
But wait: Waitress makes palatable everything repellent about American independent movies of the Sundance smash type. There's a fine line between crowd-pleaser and crime against cinema, and to my mind this guileless romcom largely stays the course. Animated by actors enjoying their work, Waitress won me over with its modest ambitions and transparent decency. What can I say? Maybe it's not my mind that's talking but my heart, which went out to the movie against all odds, heavy with the burden of writer-director Shelly's tragic death. Just before the Sundance debut, she was brutally murdered.
The details of that tragedy are too lurid to mention, and largely beside the point. Waitress  doesn't need extra-filmic poignancy to succeed, though it's impossible not to be moved by its status as final testament. Shelly wrote the script while pregnant with her daughter and, in part, to exorcise her fear of impending motherhood. This heartfelt impulse grounds the picture's whimsy and compensates for its many schematic qualities. Waitress  won't set the world on fire, but it glows.
