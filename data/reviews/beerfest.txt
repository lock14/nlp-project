Remember drinking games? You laughed really hard, made some new friends, got incredibly wasted. Maybe you were a little loud, a little vulgar; maybe you even made a complete ass of yourself. You wake up the next day, you're dehydrated, sore all over, there's a funky taste in your mouth, and you generally feel overwhelmed and confused. Remember that feeling? That's pretty much the experience of watching Beerfest
. Though the filmmakers intend to elicit the wild fun of a night out, the experience is unfortunately much more akin to the hangover. You may not completely regret the night before, but you'd probably be better off without it. The Broken Lizard comedy troupe (Super Troopers
, Club Dread
) � comprising Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, Lemme, Soter, and Stolhanske � co-star and share writing credits for this celebration of all things alcoholic. While Super Troopers
 offered some genuine laughs, there's been a steady decline in the ensuing films. The plot of Beerfest
 is tailored to provide ample opportunity for Broken Lizard's schtick: vulgar gags and a handful of surreal chuckles. When American brothers Todd and Jan Wolfhouse (Stolhanske and Soter) are sent to Germany on a mission to scatter their grandfather's ashes, they discover the existence of Beerfest, a super-secret world-class competition of beer drinking. Furthermore, they meet their German cousins, the Von Wolfhausens, who greet the brothers with rabid bitterness, proceeding to drink them under the table. Humiliated, the brothers vow to return in a year and defend their family honor. The result is an excuse to spend the entire movie finding new and better ways to drink as much beer as possible. Cue outrageous antics. Gathering together their team (aka, the rest of Broken Lizard: Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, and Lemme), they crash house parties, drink ram's pee, and make their own beer. Ultimately, the team returns to Beerfest and more calamities ensue. The formerly amazing Leachman is unfortunately relegated to creepy old woman as the brothers' great-grandmother. But a few laughs can be found in the silly accents and lederhosen of the Von Wolfhausens. Director Chandrasekhar definitely has an oddly endearing screen presence and is easily the most likable of the group. But the vulgarity is so over-the-top and the decent jokes too few and far between. When the movie ended, I needed a drink, but not for the reasons that the movie intended.


Making a comedy that celebrates binge drinking and cretinous behavior isn't a crime against nature. Making one that's as brutally unfunny as ``Beerfest" is.
The new movie has all the comic sparkle of a keg that's been left out in the sun; it's recommended only to those who really need to see a dirndl-clad Cloris Leachman stroke a bratwurst. If you find window-rattling beer belches a riot, too, you're in.
``Beerfest" is the fourth feature from Broken Lizard (``Super Troopers," ``Club Dread"), the comedy troupe that came together in the 1990s at Colgate University's Beta Theta Pi. That's fitting, since the group's brand of farce suggests a frat skit with a bigger budget.
The five members -- Jay Chandrasekhar (who directs), Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske -- are enthusiastic, but there isn't a natural comedian in the bunch. Chandrasekhar comes closest and it seems like he'd do anything for a laugh, but give your buddies a camera and a case of frosties and you'd probably do just as well.
``Beerfest" follows the misadventures of the Wolfhouse brothers, Tod (Stolhanske) and Jan (Soter), who travel from Colorado to Munich after the death of their beloved grandpapa (Donald Sutherland, getting three laughs, his paycheck, and leaving). They want to return his ashes to the biergarten from whence he came; instead, they stumble upon a secret beer-drinking Olympics hosted by nasty Baron Von Wulfhausen (Jurgen Prochnow), who tells them that grandpa was a whoreson stableboy who stole the family's prized beer recipe and fled to America.
Humiliated by the baron's handpicked team of snotty Bavarians, the Wolfhouses retreat across the pond and field their own team of chuggers . Landfill (Heffernan, a bargain-bin Belushi) is the belly of steel; Finklestein (Lemme) the nerd scientist and strategist; Barry (Chandrasekhar) the ex- beerpong whiz fallen on hard times and turning tricks under a bridge.
The cast is rounded out by Leachman as the brothers' great-grandmother and Mo'Nique as her sass-tastic caregiver Cherry, neither of whom is what she initially seems. A sex scene between Barry and Cherry offers the Broken Lizard approach in a nutshell: nubile fantasy breasts, gross-out gags, and embarrassment all around. At least the frog-masturbation sequence has decent comic timing.
The climactic face-off at the biergarten has a few giggles, too, but more for the baroque ridiculousness of the drinking games on display: the Bat-Spin, the Monkey Chug, Thumper. (If all these ring a bell, then guess what? You're an alcoholic.) One of the Bavarian meanies is played by Will Forte of ``Saturday Night Live" and the movie shares that show's lame-duck idea of comedy: noisy, repetitive shtick and a belief that referring to party-hearty hedonism is the same as being creatively funny about it.
It's not, but it flatters the complacency of the film's target audience and upholds the time-honored collegiate notion that getting hammered is an act of rebellion. A big hangover awaits these folks; for the rest of us in the audience, the hangover is now.


I was cold sober  and, having seen the loose-and-lazy Super Troopers , plenty skeptical  when I sat down for the latest addition to comedy frat Broken Lizard's oeuvre. By the end, I was nicely buzzed, if also slightly queasy at the sight or thought of beer. Most important, I felt oddly respected: Neck-deep in barley and boobs, marinated in urine, Beerfest  panders shamelessly to the 15-year-old in this 30-year-old... without assuming he is  a 15-year-old. It's R-rated puerility for actual immature grown-ups.
The feint of a story follows men-children Todd and Jan Wolfhouse to Munich, where they're instructed to scatter the ashes of their grandfather (Donald Sutherland, in an appropriately tipsy cameo) at a secret enter-the-flagon guzzle-ympics called Beerfest. There they meet their old-country cousins, drinking champions whose Teutonic  patriarch (Das Boot 's Jürgen Prochnow) accuses the Yanks of filching the long-lost family beer recipe. Challenges are made, everybody chugs, and the Wolfhouse boys are sent home with their livers tucked between their legs. Then ensues a long, and near-nauseating, training montage, as the Wolfhouse boys assemble a dream team of hops-heads (the rest of the Lizard gang) and condition their systems for (wait for it) Das Boot, a massive boot-shaped stein. Will good old-fashioned American alcoholism triumph over evil old-fashioned German alcoholism in the big rematch? Bet on it, and bet on this: These guys did their own stunts.

 In “Beerfest,” a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard have created a frat-house staple for the ages. The plot — an insanitary blend of hops, ram urine and human remains — follows the Wolfhouse brothers (Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter) to Oktoberfest, where they stumble into an underground beer-guzzling contest and abject humiliation at the hands of their German cousins.  To defend the family name, the brothers return a year later with their dream team: a beer-games champ and erstwhile male prostitute (Jay Chandrasekhar, who also directs), a hollow-legged chugging machine (Kevin Heffernan) and a lab technician (Steve Lemme) whose specialty is collecting frog ejaculate — a decidedly unscientific process that the movie’s target audience will enjoy almost as much as the frogs do.  As the team faces off against belligerent British sailors, aggressive Aussies and a pair of Teutonic bingers known as Hammacher and Schlemmer, the movie, like its characters, becomes increasingly incoherent. Fortunately there’s Great Gam Gam (a delicious Cloris Leachman, dusting off her Frau Blücher accent from “Young Frankenstein”), the brothers’ steely great-grandmother with the nefarious past. “I always sleep better when I have some sausage in me,” she confides, lasciviously stroking a frankfurter. It’s the classiest moment in the movie.  “Beerfest” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It abuses language, drugs, alcohol, human beings and small amphibians, sometimes all at once.

There's roughly a pint of quality comedy rattling around in this keg-sized movie, which fills out the rest of its time by being so cheerfully stupid that those with brains muddled by a few beers or worse (almost a prerequisite) probably won't notice all the foam. The Broken Lizard comedy troupe enjoyed considerable DVD success with "Super Troopers," and its latest should find similar vitality in that format after this late-summer theatrical pit stop. Indeed, some scenes and the closing outtakes already feel like little more than a tease for the unrated DVD extras sure to come.
Director Jay Chandrasekhar -- one fifth of the Lizard brigade, along with Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske, who share script credit and play multiple roles -- took a detour to helm "The Dukes of Hazzard" (2005), and "Beerfest" possesses the same crazy energy and modicum of wit. The audience, for example, is warned at the outset, in "Jackass" fashion, that should they attempt to mimic the movie's drinking excesses, "YOU WILL DIE."
Soter and Stolhanske play Jan and Todd, two dim-bulb brothers who have been given the task of scattering the ashes of their granddad (an uncredited Donald Sutherland) by his Teutonic mom (Cloris Leachman) at Munich's Oktoberfest. Once there, though, they stumble onto a secret underground drinking competition ("The Beer Hunter"?) where they are trounced by the minions of the Baron (Juergen Prochnow), who's holding a long-brewing grudge because of a stolen beer recipe that Jan and Todd's ancestors smuggled to America.
Determined to return a year later and gain revenge, the brothers recruit a trio of college chums with useful skills when it comes to playing beer pong or quarters and draining huge tankards of ale -- in short, an average Friday at a local frat house, albeit featuring guys who are clearly too old for this nonsense as the principal imbibers.
Chandrasekhar maintains a bit of momentum through the early going as the less-than-fabulous five is assembled and begins "training." There's also the sheer giddiness of the Oktoberfest shindig erupting into a melee -- complete with nine or 10 gratuitously bared breasts -- as well as a helpful demonstration of what are affectionately known as "beer goggles" involving Mo'Nique, an extremely game co-star.
Yet as is almost inevitable with this kind of enterprise, there isn't enough creative wattage to sustain that level of zaniness, which is why such fare plays better on DVD, where the best moments can be absorbed in bite-sized bits and the debris easily bypassed. (There's also a clever "Das Boot" gag involving Prochnow that will likely fly over most heads in the target audience, which is surely composed of those just old enough to qualify for the pic's "R" rating.)
Supporting players appear to have considerable fun with their Hans and Franz-esque accents (or in Leachman's case, Frau Blucher), including "Saturday Night Live's" Will Forte. And if the contest finale is somewhat anticlimactic, it should nevertheless provide beer-game ideas to impressionable youngsters who might otherwise squander their formative years in libraries and study halls.
