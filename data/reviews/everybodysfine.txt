Everybody�s Fine
 � a movie about the lies grown children tell their parents � is, ironically, one of the most disingenuous movies to come out of Hollywood in a while. The film is an American remake of Guiseppe Tornatore�s Italian original from 1990, but the problems in tone that often beset American remakes of foreign films are merely the beginning of this movie�s faux pas. The characters, whose behaviors are the result of emotionally complex situations, are two-dimensional creations with little backstory and zero depth. The story recounts episode after episode of one man�s disconnect with his grown children, and then wraps it up with a sentimental, patently false, feel-good, holiday ending. Group hug, everyone (and make sure this is the shot used for the movie poster). De Niro plays the family patriarch Frank Goode (that name alone should give you a sense of the film�s generously broad strokes), and one of the few things to be thankful for in this movie is that De Niro abandons the comic mugging that has characterized his last decade of work and actually acts � or, at least, doesn�t overact. He is a widower of eight months when we first encounter him, anxiously preparing for the first homecoming of his four children since their mother�s death. But, one by one, they phone in their regrets. So what does Frank do? He packs a bag and sets off cross-country to pay each of them a surprise visit. He first goes to New York City to pop in on his artist son, David (Austin Lysy), considered by all to be the most troubled family member. David isn�t home, however, and doesn�t return even after Frank spends the night waiting on his front stoop. So on Frank goes to Chicago to visit his daughter Amy (Beckinsale), who lives (I kid you not) in a mostly glass house. Here he learns that his grandson (Maisel) who is supposedly doing fabulously in school is, in actuality, not. Things seems strained with Amy�s husband (Frain) and Amy also seems anxious to get rid of Pops. In Denver, Frank learns that son Robert (Rockwell) isn�t the orchestra conductor that he was led to believe but, rather, the percussionist who bangs the bass drum. And in Las Vegas, the fabrications that daughter Rosie (Barrymore) weaves about her glamorous lifestyle are just a tad too obvious. Frank heads home having learned that all the years he spent being a good provider for his children and always prodding them to excel has had repercussions. They have kept their failures to themselves, and his wife had always buffered him from unhappy truths. Then in less time than it takes to pronounce that old bromide, �everybody�s fine,� the Goode family finds its mojo and gathers together for the film�s final curtain. To that we can only ask: Is all well that ends well?

It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But “Everybody’s Fine’’ does a stupendous job. De Niro plays  - humanizing name alert  - Frank Goode, a widower crossing the country, by train and bus, to drop in on the four adult children who are too busy to visit him. Frank’s journey has been made under the assumption that we possess desperate hearts and strained carrots for brains.
Whenever Frank sees one of his kids or waits to see one, the score flares up like an orchestral rash. And as he regards them  - three are played by Kate Beckinsale (Chicago), Sam Rockwell (Denver), and, best of all, Drew Barrymore (Las Vegas); the little-seen fourth, a son, is in trouble in Mexico  - the movie keeps cutting to actual kids. This is stupid. We can tell from De Niro’s wistful expression what he sees in these grown-ups is the children they used to be.
Frank made his living coating America’s telephone wires in PVC, a chemical that’s now made him vaguely ill (his doctor urges him not to fly). And after he leaves one child to surprise the next one, the camera pulls right up to a drooping strand of wire, and we hear the siblings squawking away on their telephones about what do for the brother in Mexico and whether to tell dad.
Not even the 1990 Giuseppe Tornatore movie that “Everybody’s Fine’’ is based on was that shameless. The original had a lot of problems. It’s been almost 20 years, but I think audiences all over the world are still in sugar shock. Still, it also had the natural Italian landscape to traverse, Tornatore’s affecting ideas about the emotional downside of living too long a life, and a keen awareness of how to make the movie a meaningful showcase for its star, Marcello Mastroianni.
Kirk Jones (“Waking Ned Devine’’) wrote and directed this Hollywood version. And the sentimentality he glops on is meant to bring out the bittersweet nature of these relationships. But there’s something darker roiling untapped beneath this material. Have Frank’s high expectations made his family pathologically incapable of leveling with him? That pathology extends to Jones, who perfumes most of the scenes with some form of cuteness. The movie’s big confessional happens as a hallucination in which Frank cross-examines the young incarnations of his kids: You’ve all been lying to me! Suddenly, a cloying family dramedy turns into an episode of “Law & Order: Children’s Television Workshop.’’
Once it’s clear the movie won’t be deviating at all from its formula, Frank’s journey gets tedious. But De Niro handles himself with rare care. He’s spent most of this decade playing goons and grumps, so it’s heartening to see that he’s still interested in etching the contours of such a proud, ebullient, life-size character. Frank is a side of De Niro we’ve never seen. So there’s immense pleasure to be had in the sight of this great craftsman actor simply making googly eyes at a baby or waving his arms to trip a light sensor. He reminded me of the airborne codger in “Up.’’ This movie is a condolence card. His performance belongs somewhere better, in, say, a movie about a house lifted aloft by a giant balloon bouquet.

Robert De Niro plays a widowed retiree named Frank in Everybody's Fine . And although Frank's not supposed to be a very sophisticated man, it requires saintly moviegoing patience I clearly don't have to put up with his level of unworldliness. For one thing, he shows up at the doorsteps of his four adult children, who are scattered across America, without calling ahead, expecting each to be home. What, it would kill him to pick up a phone? The guy spent a working lifetime manufacturing the protective coating that insulates telephone wire, fer chrissakes . The contradiction counts as galumphing irony in this calculatedly soppy, seasonally phony Americanized remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's 1990 Stanno Tutti Bene   which was bittersweet in the Italian original with Marcello Mastroianni as the poignant papa.
Then there's this: Frank, who hasn't seen his brood since the death of their mother a few months earlier, travels from kid to kid (each son or daughter secretly unhappy, lying to their pop, and not fine at all in his or her own way) by bus and train, toting a sad rolling carry-on bag. Thing is, Frank is the only American born in the age of Samsonite who doesn't know that rolling bags actually roll , don't you know, on little wheels that work quite well when the collapsible handle is extended and pulled. So until one of his kids clues him in, he lifts, carries, and schleps like a grandpa from the old country.
Well. The sight of the world-famous Robert De Niro, a powerful actor revered for playing tough guys who can smash Samsonite with their bare hands, pretending not to know how to pull a handle is so embarrassing that the ick ought to obscure the rest of the movie's falsehoods. Yet, as written and directed by British director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine ) with guidance, apparently, from Dr. Phil, the movie introduces offspring who are correspondingly awful, including Kate Beckinsale as a tense, rich ad exec in Chicago, Sam Rockwell as a drippy musician in Denver, and Drew Barrymore as an alleged dancer in Las Vegas. As for the artist son in New York City, jeez, he's nowhere to be found. Naturally, poor shnooky Frank just waits like a lox on the stoop of the kid's scary, downtown-y, artisty, and vagranty tenement building. At least he might have spent the time more profitably learning how to get his wheels rolling.


 Warning: A putatively heartwarming dramatic comedy like “Everybody’s Fine” can be hazardous to your health. The queasiness produced by this sentimental weepie builds into a wave of nausea during its interminable finale, in which a family with the usual array of problems and disappointments (I refuse to use the term “dysfunctional” anymore) reunites for Christmas, all lovey-dovey.  Written and directed by Kirk Jones (“Waking Ned Devine,” “Nanny McPhee”), “Everybody’s Fine” is an adaptation of a 1990 Italian film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, himself no slouch when it comes to pouring on the corn syrup. The original movie starred Marcello Mastroianni as a retired Sicilian widower who pays surprise visits to his grown children on the Italian mainland. His American counterpart, Frank Goode (Robert De Niro), is a retired worker (at a wire factory) and a father of four who suffers from an unspecified ailment brought on by the toxic coating applied to the wire.  Because his recently deceased wife, the children’s confidante and collaborator in deception, regaled him with rose-colored accounts of their achievements, a beaming Frank (and nobody beams like Mr. De Niro) boasts about their successes to one and all. Frank is mildly abashed when he invites them to a family reunion and excitedly purchases a grill and some fancy steaks, only to have them telephone, one by one, with terse excuses for why they can’t come. Although disappointed, Frank figures that they must have excellent reasons.  Determined to get closer to them, Frank goes against his doctor’s orders and sets out to pay unannounced visits to the four, traveling by train and bus from his suburban home in somewhere U.S.A. to New York, Chicago, Denver and Las Vegas. His first letdown is his discovery that one son, David, a painter, isn’t living in his surprisingly shabby New York tenement apartment. We quickly learn in awkwardly inserted scenes of anxious telephone colloquies among the siblings that David is in Mexico and may be in serious trouble.  Frank’s second stop is a Chicago suburb where one daughter, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), a glum, high-powered advertising executive, lives in a hideous modern house that is as sterile as it is enormous. Amy, who has a mouthy brat and a husband who arrives with Chinese takeout, is not pleased to see her father and can’t wait to get him out of there.  In Denver he surprises his other son, Robert (Sam Rockwell), a percussionist for a symphony orchestra, in the middle of a rehearsal. Frank is shocked to discover that Robert is not the world-class conductor he was led to believe. During their tense encounter, Mr. Rockwell, in the film’s best performance, conveys the bitterness of an adult child who grew up terrified of displeasing an impossibly demanding parent. Their meeting suggests what a scary father Frank must have been when the children were young.  In the final stop, Las Vegas, his other daughter, Rosie (Drew Barrymore), a dancer, greets him with another elaborate charade. Ms. Barrymore is as ingenuous as ever in a small role that raises unanswered questions about Rosie’s actual circumstances. In a movie whose plot turns are signaled from miles away, Frank has the inevitable health crisis. This one occasions a dream sequence so clumsy and overwrought you want to avert your eyes.  “Everybody’s Fine” heralds the entrance of Mr. De Niro, now 66, into geezer territory. In a hammy movie that practically demands a hammy lead performance, he is relatively restrained. The De Niro tics are present of course, including the crinkly, secretive smile that camouflages hurt feelings as well as possible menace, and the jocular attitude and tone of voice that go with the smile.  If the film weren’t so mechanically contrived — you can feel its rusty machinery cranking away — Mr. De Niro might have lent Frank a dimension that transcended the cliché of a well-meaning but clueless control freak whose fantasies of having raised perfect children are methodically dashed. But Mr. De Niro doesn’t bring much to the role beyond a seriocomic affability that is a toned-down version of his character Jack Byrnes from “Meet the Parents.”  The only credible scenes in a movie that is pathologically afraid of being a bummer belong to Mr. Rockwell. Otherwise “Everybody’s Fine” is false to the core.  “Everybody’s Fine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Much of Kirk Jones' family-reconciliation drama "Everybody's Fine" takes place on steadily moving trains, Greyhounds and 18-wheelers, appropriately enough for a film that moves reliably and ineluctably toward a well-mapped denouement. Though a bit too artful to merit the pejorative "tearjerker" label, the film is rigorously streamlined to deliver a good emotional uppercut by the end, and purely on the strength of its craft, it connects. But aside from an atypically mannered Robert De Niro, there's very little new to see along the way. Box office should be respectable for the Dec. 4 Miramax release.
Helmer-scripter Jones adapted "Everybody's Fine" from Giuseppe Tornatore's 1990 original, and the two directors prove highly compatible counterparts. For one, Jones shares Tornatore's total lack of embarrassment with sentimentality and stock character types; Jones' 1998 debut, "Waking Ned Devine," deftly skirted the boundary where stereotypes cross over into archetypes. To call that film cliched or predictable would be entirely accurate yet also miss the point.
So, too, with "Everybody's Fine." The trouble here is that while "Waking Ned Devine" had an entire town's worth of quirky characters to help move the narrative along, this single-character-driven piece needs room to breathe, and Jones never allows it (or the audience) to forget its ultimate destination; this may be the tautest, most regimented movie ever made about a meandering road trip. Like Tornatore, Jones is also an extremely literal filmmaker, and when he intercuts scenes with footage of cross-country telephone wires or small talk about a huge gathering storm in the Atlantic, the symbolic functions of both are so straightforward that they almost cease to be metaphors.
Thus, responsibility for providing the film's complexity falls to De Niro (taking over the role played by Marcello Mastroianni in the original), and he mostly delivers. While his elderly traveling widower, Frank Goode, has shades of Jack Nicholson's Warren Schmidt (and a few overcooked scenes), it's nonetheless a role De Niro makes his own, and possibly his first to evoke sincere, unironic goodness. The simmering rage and restless anxiety of his best roles are totally absent here, as is the hamming of his more recent outings; in their place is a quiet, contemplative intensity that suggests an inner life to the character beyond the machinations of the script.
Alone at the beginning except for Perry Como on the soundtrack, Frank prepares for a planned reunion with his four adult children -- their first meeting since the death of their mother eight months prior. He soon receives a barrage of phone calls from his kids, all of whom cancel at the last minute. After a quick visit to his doctor (who warns him not to travel), Frank impulsively sets off to surprise his children in their homes, conspicuously packing four envelopes, all of which may just as well be stamped with "Do not open until final reel."
First on the list is youngest son David, a painter living in a disreputable New York neighborhood. The evidently cell phone-less Frank waits outside his door all night and, when David fails to show up, leaves an envelope under his door and heads on his way.
Next is Amy (Kate Beckinsale) in Chicago, an ad agency owner with a palatial home and seemingly consequent marriage problems, then slacker classical musician Robert (Sam Rockwell) in Denver, and finally Las Vegas dancer Rosie (Drew Barrymore). While Frank is between destinations, we hear the three on the phone with one another, slowly spilling details about David's whereabouts -- which they conspire to keep secret from their father, who concurrently begins to realize how much his children left out in their idealized descriptions of their own lives to him.
Rockwell, Beckinsale and Barrymore are in fine form here, though they have precious little to do. Rockwell fares best, perhaps because his segment of the film has no obvious sociopolitical points to make, while Beckinsale is saddled with some of the film's more stilted dialogue, her character serving as little more than the proverbial career woman with a troubled family life. Melissa Leo has even less of a chance to leave an impression in her quick scene as a truck driver.
Henry Braham's photography is quite strong, unobtrusively capturing the particular melancholy of bus terminals, chain hotel lobbies and roadside scenery. Other tech elements are above average. 


Don't be misled by the cheesy, generic poster for Kirk Jones 's Everybody's Fine , in which a grinning Sam Rockwell , Drew Barrymore , and Kate Beckinsale  pose with Robert De Niro  (airbrushed almost to the point of unrecognizable) for their characters' family photo in front of a Christmas tree. It's a marketing department's feeble feint: The four actors appear onscreen together for only a handful of minutes late in the movieand it's no more a Christmas movie than Yentl .
Actually, this is writer-director Kirk Jones's retelling of Giuseppe Tornatore 's Stanno tutti bene (1990), in which Marcello Mastroianni , his failing eyes made to look like tiny black dots behind thick glasses, traveled almost the entirety of Italy to surprise-visit his five grown children who, for one reason or another, couldn't make it home for a family reunion 'round the dinner table. It was an exquisite, lush (that scenery ), and wholly naturalistic bit of filmmaking about the painful secrets children keep from their parents and how grown-ups will always view their offspring as fragile eight-year-olds in need of prodding. Tornatore, fresh off his glossy and nostalgic Cinema Paradiso , proffered something that felt like documentary; Stanno tutti benne contained moments so unflinching and intimate that you almost wanted to turn away and let the characters just share them in private. The bubbly feel-good of Cinema Paradiso had spoiled, and, in its place, was vinegar.
In a potentially inspired bit of casting, De Niro takes over the Mastroianni role, but his deadpanintended to signify emptiness and achelooks mostly like a somebody doing nothing. Mastroianni's mustache worked harder than De Niro does here. He plays Frank, a widower who spent his entire life breathing in toxic fumes at a plant that manufactured PVC coating for telephone wires. Why has Jones given him that  job? Because it allows for copious cutaways to phone lines over which Frank's childrenRobert (Rockwell), Rosie (Barrymore), and Amy (Beckinsale)share grim news concerning their brother, David, an artist in Manhattan who has gone missing down Mexico way, one among many secrets they keep from their father in their mother's absence. It's a dreary gimmick: Rather than watching actors, um, act, we see instead a screen filled with phone wires, again and again and again. It's not a movie; it's an audiobook.
Frank, who lives in upstate New York , travels first to Manhattan to see David, who's not home. He lingers on the stoop for hours; nothing happens, save for a passing prostitute's half-hearted offer of a better way to kill a few hours. Frank's sleepy. We know how he feels. Then he's off, by bus, to Chicago to see Amy, a wildly successful ad exec who lives in a glass house perched on a lush hilltop. All's not well there, either: Amy's son, Jack (Lucian Maisel ), isn't quite the straight-A student Mom had said he was, and the boy wants nothing to do with his father, whom he ignores over a take-out Chinese dinner. But Frank lets it go; better not to ruin the illusion, lest the glass house shatter and fall. "I tell you the good news," says Amy, "and spare you the bad." Frank rushes off; who has time to talk ?
Next stop: Denver, where Robert's not an orchestra conductor, as advertised, but merely the guy banging the big drum in the back row. Father and son argue for a few moments: Robert says he only went into music for Frank; Frank says he wanted better for his boy than to hit a drum. And  . . . scene. Finally, Frank heads to Las Vegas , where Rosie says she's working as a dancer in a big Bellagio  show. She shows off her fancy pad overlooking the tourist palaces; she says, um, yeah, that baby is really a friend's. Frank knows better. Oh, but would you look at the timegotta go, there's a dream sequence ahead. (And it's a low point in De Niro's career.)
So what's the point of all of this road-tripping to nowhere? Parents' best intentions often get the better of their children? Sons and daughters keep secrets from their parents? Fathers with blinders on can only pretend to know best? It's awfully hard to remake Tornatore and Alexander Payne 's About Schmidt  at the same time? Robert De Niro's only good at playing a dad in movies starring Ben Stiller ? It's all so much raging bull.
