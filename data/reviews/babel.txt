         If a butterfly flaps its wings in the rain forest, it will, if nothing else, set off an infinite chain reaction in the minds of Alejandro González Iñárritu and his creative collaborator, Guillermo Arriaga. The director and screenwriter have a thing for causal connections, which, in "Babel," they literally track to the ends of the Earth.
 
  As in "Amores Perros" and "21 Grams," their two previous collaborations, "Babel," which won the best director award at Cannes, ties together four seemingly unconnected stories that are eventually revealed to be inextricably linked to one another. The first story begins in the Moroccan desert, where a farmer named Abdullah (Mustapha Rachidi) buys a rifle to protect his goats from jackals, and hands it over to his two young sons, Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid) and Ahmed (Said Tarchani), who, fooling around, take a careless potshot at a passing bus.
 


         






    The second takes place in San Diego and later in a small Mexican border town, where Amelia (Adriana Barraza), a Mexican nanny, takes her young charges Mike (Nathan Gamble) and Debbie (Elle Fanning) to attend her son's wedding when their traveling parents refuse to let the woman take the day off. What at first seems like heartless authoritarianism on the part of her employer turns out to be the result of a tragedy. Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett) are traveling in Morocco when their bus is attacked in what appears to be a terrorist incident.
 
  As its title implies, "Babel" is about the difficulty of human communication, but although the stories unfold in four countries and in five languages — English, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese and sign — language is far from the principal barrier. Instead, the film explores the ways in which cultural assumptions and biases tend to obscure reality even when reality is plain, and the way our perceived differences keep us from finding a human connection to one other.
 
  If the relationship among the first three stories — each gingerly perched on an explosive political issue — soon become apparent (Susan's freak accident is quickly spun into an international crisis; Amelia falls into an immigration quagmire when her drunk nephew, played by Gael García Bernal, provokes the border guards on their way home), the fourth story takes awhile to reveal itself.
 
  Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf Japanese teenager whose mother has recently committed suicide, acts out her grief and feelings of isolation by throwing herself at every man or boy who crosses her path. She drifts through the crowded, pulsing streets of Tokyo, shot by cinematographer Rodrigo Pietro as though the city were a beautiful, whimsical contraption that appears even more startling and dreamlike when the sound drops out. Chieko's connection to the others is tenuous, but her experience provides the lyrical counterpoint to what are otherwise Kafkaesque tragedies about individuals swallowed up by the bureaucratic machinery of nationhood.
 
  The beauty of this film is in its lapidary details, which sparkle with feeling and surprise. González Iñárritu and Arriaga, both Mexican (González Iñárritu now resides with his family in the United States), are particularly attuned to the vulnerability of the foreigner abroad — whether that vulnerability is real or imagined. After the tour bus takes a detour to the guide's village to find the closest doctor, the other tourists become jittery and anxious to leave the wounded passenger behind. But the tourists' paranoia — they are American, French and British — is in no way justified by the treatment they receive in the village, where the townspeople show them kindness or stay out of their way. Conversely, Amelia fully expects the authorities to come to her aid, but is treated like a criminal first and a person in distress second by the border guides who find her after her ordeal. In a particularly wrenching scene, a border cop of apparent Mexican descent cuffs her while ignoring her pleas for help, responding to her mostly Spanish pleas strictly in English.
 
  Clearly, González Iñárritu knows his Weltschmerz
, and he burrows deep into the existential loneliness of each character to create a kaleidoscope of cumulative human sadness and grief over the state of the world. With uncommon empathy and insight, he elicits moving performances from all the actors — down to the incidental detective who comes to talk to Chieko. The experience, followed by a chance encounter with her father, leaves him shaken, disoriented and hitting the nearest bar — by then you know exactly how he feels.
 
  García Bernal, in a smaller role as Santiago, Amelia's funny, loose cannon of a nephew, is as charming as he is unnerving and tragic. When little Mike, strapped in the back seat en route to the wedding, remarks that his mother says Mexico is dangerous, Santiago turns to him with a mischievous grin and says, "It is. It's full of Mexicans." Young, feisty, prone to trouble and uncommonly perceptive, Santiago, Chieko and Yussef chafe at the arbitrary constraints imposed on their lives by others. The limitations feel like a prison. And for Yussef and Santiago, they very likely become one.

Those preparing for the dramatic sermon on a theme of global miscommunication and dislocation that is Babel  would do well to consult Genesis 11:7-8, the verse in which God decides to incite labor unrest during the construction of a tower with its top in the heavens: ''Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.''
God's plan, theologians tell us, was to chastise human arrogance and slow mankind's inexorable drive toward self-aggrandizement via the humility of confusion; His mission was to knock a project of Trump-size chutzpah off the map. But I'm less clear what director Alejandro González Iñárritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga had in mind as the creators of Amores Perros  and 21 Grams  collaborated on the third of their characteristically flashy, collage-like, multicultural pileups. Here's a story in which a stray bullet innocently let loose by a couple of shepherd kids in the scrubby, barren mountains of Morocco turns into an international crisis involving American tourists, a Mexican nanny, a deaf Japanese teenager, cops, border patrols, and embassies jumpy about terrorism. And yet for all the misunderstandings that accrue, with attendant sorrows and repentances, between husbands and wives, parents and children, cops and suspects, governments and governments, my compassion is undone by frustration, convinced as I am that no ensuing snafu would have been quite so catastrophic had Brad Pitt, as an apoplectic American abroad, not been asked to bellow and bully with such unsophisticated ignorance.
Borrowing handsome eye wrinkles and graypeppered hair from the George Clooney collection, Pitt plays Richard, who is seen early on lumbering along in a motor coach on a group tour through Morocco with his reproachful, anxious wife, Susan (Cate Blanchett), and a busload of other baleful white people. The miserable couple nurse bitter marital accusations understandable only much later in the saga, while their two cute blond kids back in California are tended to by an ideally loving Mexican nanny, Amelia (Amores Perros ' Adriana Barraza, radiating maternal warmth).
Then Susan is wounded by the shepherd boys' gunshot, seemingly from out of nowhere. And Richard starts screaming, cursing, threatening, and demanding like a guy in a bad movie: Where are cell phones, ambulances, Western doctors, diplomatic envoys when he needs them in the middle of the Berber desert? Why are the only people in the closest Moroccan village...Moroccan villagers? Why don't they speak English, and why don't they understand when he yells even louder?
His crisis  a butterfly effect designed to fray the nerves of skittish post-9/11 moviegoers  ripples outward. Stuck with no babysitter to relieve her, Amelia and her nephew (Gael García Bernal) drive the kids across the border to Mexico for her son's wedding. (Not surprisingly, a Mexican mother's desire to be at her beloved son's wedding matters little to Richard. Is this seemingly sophisticated, affluent, attractive man not the ugliest gringo since...the ugly gringos in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada , also written by Arriaga?) In Japan, meanwhile, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi, stunning in every moment of her first American picture) receives no part of Richard's rage, but she's tormented nonetheless  a confused teen still reeling from her mother's death, and isolated by deafness (and sexually aroused adolescence) from communicating with her mournful businessman father (Memoirs of a Geisha 's Kôji Yakusho).
Babel  looks beautiful, never more so than when Brokeback Mountain  cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto captures locals at ease among themselves: Unflappable desert village life, pulsing Tokyo teen culture, and a vibrant Mexican wedding are treated with reverence and delight, in unsubtle contrast to depictions of people lost in cultural wildernesses. But at some point  maybe just about the time we learn that the Japanese papa once went hunting in Morocco  the choreography of clashes (for which González Iñárritu won the directing  prize at the 2006 Cannes film festival) begins to look busy for the sake of math, not for message. Measured in anything other than biblical cubits, the sum of Babel 's many parts turns out to be a picture that suggests Americans ought to stay home and treat their nannies better.

 The biblical story of Babel takes up a handful of verses in the 11th chapter of Genesis, and it illustrates, among other things, the terrible consequences of unchecked ambition. As punishment for trying to build a tower that would reach the heavens, the human race was scattered over the face of the earth in a state of confusion — divided, dislocated and unable to communicate. More or less as we find ourselves today.  To make sense of this condition requires an ambition nearly as great as the one that got those ancient architects into trouble in the first place. Any discussion of “Babel,” therefore — whether grounded in skepticism or lost in admiration — has to begin by acknowledging just how much the film, the third collaboration between the director Alejandro González Iñárritu and the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, sets out to do.  It tells four distinct stories, disclosing bit by bit the chronology and causality that link them and making much of the linguistic, cultural and geographical distances among the characters. The movie travels — often by means of jarringly abrupt cuts and shifts of tone — from the barren mountains of Morocco, where the dominant sound is howling wind, to fluorescent Tokyo, where the natural world has been almost entirely supplanted by a technological environment, to the anxious border between the United States and Mexico. Each place has its own aural and visual palette. The languages used by the astonishingly diverse cast include Spanish, Berber, Japanese, sign language and English. The misunderstandings multiply accordingly, though they tend to be most acute between husbands and wives or parents and children, rather than between strangers.  Surely, something must hold this world — or, at any rate, this film’s vision of the world — together. Whether anything does is the question most likely to fuel the cafe-table arguments “Babel” will surely provoke. The individual scenes are sometimes so powerful, and put together with such care and conviction, that you might leave the theater feeling dazed, even traumatized. “Babel” is certainly an experience. But is it a meaningful experience? That the film possesses unusual aesthetic force strikes me as undeniable, but its power does not seem to be tethered to any coherent idea or narrative logic. You can feel it without ever quite believing it.    But let’s give feeling its due. The sheer reckless ardor of Mr. González Iñárritu’s filmmaking — the voracious close-ups, the sweeping landscape shots, the swiveling, hurtling camera movements — suggests a virtually limitless confidence in the power of the medium to make connections out of apparent discontinuities. His faith in cinema as a universal language could hardly be more evident.  Some of the pieces of “Babel” are attached to one another by the banal lingua franca of television images, as events in North Africa, for instance, make the evening news in Tokyo. But Mr. González Iñárritu’s own visual grammar tries to go deeper, to suggest a common idiom of emotion present in certain immediately recognizable gestures and expressions. We may not be able to read minds or decipher words, he suggests, but we can surely decode faces, especially when we see them at close range and in distress. Loss, fear, pain, anguish — none of these emotions, it seems, are likely to be lost in translation.  It gives nothing away to note that every story in “Babel” ends in tears. The raw, naturalistic intimacy of Rodrigo Prieto’s cinematography disguises some flagrant melodrama, as does the dedication of the actors, some of whom have never appeared on film before.  The most glamorous cast members are Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, who play an American couple on a desultory vacation in Morocco, trying to repair the damage done to their marriage by the death of their infant son. Their movie-star charisma is turned down to a low, flickering flame, and the easy sense of entitlement they sometimes betray belongs naturally to their characters, Susan and Richard, who nonetheless receive a brutal reminder that even the privileged are vulnerable to accident.  Susan — the kind of tourist who worries that the local ice cubes carry disease — is badly wounded when a bullet is fired through a bus window, hitting her in the neck. The bullet comes from a gun belonging to Abdullah (Mustapha Rachidi), a goatherd, and used by his two sons, Ahmed (Said Tarchani) and Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid), to keep jackals away from the herd.  The gunmen and their victim are never in the frame together, and the consequences of the incident unfold in parallel crises. Susan and Richard wind up in a small town, waiting for an ambulance, facing the panic and impatience of their fellow holiday makers and relying on the kindness of strangers. Abdullah and his sons and neighbors, for their part, must deal with the harsh attentions of the Moroccan police, who are trying to defuse what threatens to become an international incident.  Meanwhile — or, rather, a short time later, since the overlapping and sequential chapters of the movie are presented as if they were happening simultaneously — Richard and Susan’s surviving children (Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble) travel to Mexico with the family’s housekeeper, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), whose son is getting married near Tijuana. They are accompanied by Amelia’s roughneck nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal, who clearly relishes playing the heavy for once).  And in Tokyo, a deaf teenage girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) spins through the emotional upheavals of adolescence, which are intensified both by her disability — or, more precisely, the obtuse way other people respond to it — and by the aftershocks of her mother’s death.  Chieko’s brazen attempts to solicit attention result, again and again, in humiliation, and Ms. Kikuchi’s performance is an unnerving blend of sexual provocation, timidity and sheer rage. Of all the characters in “Babel,” she seems most surprising  and least tethered to cultural stereotype (in spite of the short-skirted schoolgirl uniform she wears). And her story, unfolding without evident connection to the other three, does not seem quite as bound by the fatalism that is Mr. Arriaga’s hallmark — as well as his limitation — as a storyteller.  The splintered, jigsaw-puzzle structure of “Babel” will be familiar to viewers who have seen “Amores Perros” or “21 Grams,” the other two features Mr. Arriaga and Mr. González Iñárritu have made together. Indeed, this movie belongs to an increasingly common, as yet unnamed genre —  “Crash” is perhaps the most prominent recent example — in which drama is created by the juxtaposition of distinct stories, rather than by the progress of a single narrative arc.  Perhaps the most common feature of movies of this kind is that they are more interested in fate than in psychology. The people in “Babel” behave irrationally — if often quite predictably — but any control they appear to have over their own lives is illusory. They suffer unequally and unfairly, paying disproportionately for their own mistakes and for the whims of chance and the laws of global capitalism.  In “Babel”  there seems to be an active, palpable tension between the schematism of Mr. Arriaga’s scenario and the sensuality of Mr. González Iñárritu’s filmmaking. Some of the most exciting and powerful sequences — a Tokyo nightclub rave,  the wedding of Amelia’s son — push beyond the constraints of the narrative and  defy, at least for a time, the grim inevitability that hovers over the film.  The sheer sensory exuberance of the film at once subverts the fatalism of its story and lends it whatever credibility it has. On paper, very little of it makes sense, but what is on screen has an almost physical impact. In the end “Babel,” like that tower in the book of Genesis, is a grand wreck, an incomplete monument to its own limitless ambition. But it is  there, on the landscape, a startling and imposing reality. It’s a folly, and also, perversely, a wonder.  “Babel” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, nudity and intense violence.
Parents and children cause an extraordinary amount of problems for one another in "Babel," a sweepingly ambitious epic of anxiety that tries to put its finger on an array of woes afflicting humanity in the early 21st century. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga's final entry in the trilogy that began with "Amores Perros" and continued with "21 Grams," new pic similarly features multiple intercut story strands, this time spread across three continents and, per the Biblical title, numerous languages. Effectively building dread and emotional tension as tragic incidents triggered by human stupidity and carelessness steadily multiply, this film, like "21 Grams" in particular, employs a deterministically grim mindset in the cause of its philosophical aspirations, but is gripping nearly all the way. Critical reactions will no doubt range fully across the map, much as they did with "Crash," which Paramount Vantage should be able to stir to its advantage in creating significant curiosity among American auds craving serious fare, and strong points of identification create real cross-over potential. International prospects are similarly promising.
The title alone is enough to indicate the director and writer's expansive intentions. But while their overall view may be far-reaching, the moment-to-moment focus remains highly specific, with each case involving wrenching life-and-death situations that on one hand are highly circumstantial and didn't have to happen, but on the other involve socio-political fallout that speaks directly to the current moment.
From the opening scene in which a goat-herder in a poor Moroccan mountain village acquires a high-powered hunting rifle and ill-advisedly gives it to his two young sons, it's clear the weapon will be put to some use other than its intended one of hunting jackals. Testing its range, one of the kids fires at a tourist bus making its way down a dusty road in the far distance.
In a middle-class Southern California home, two young blond children are looked after by Mexican nanny Amerlia (Adriana Barraza) who, after failing to find anyone with whom to leave the kids, decides in extremis to have them accompany her south of the border for the day so she can attend her son's wedding outside Tijuana.
Back in Morocco, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), the parents of the California kids who have gotten away to recover from the death of a third baby, are riding in the bus with their fellow tourists when Susan suddenly takes a bullet in the upper shoulder.
In Tokyo, foxy deaf-mute student Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) lets her considerable anger allow her volleyball team to lose, has a desultory meeting with her widowed father Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) and, in an impulsive moment at a crowded restaurant, removes the underwear under her short school skirt and begins flashing her privates at boys at a nearby table.
Back in Morocco, the goatherd informs his boys that some terrorists have killed an American tourist on a bus.
And so it goes, as the filmmakers continue layering urgent distress, irrational behavior, bad luck, misunderstandings, frustrations, erroneous media reports, zealous security responses and downright dumb headedness to shape a tale that despairs at the state of human relations even in the absence of bad intentions or outright evil on the part of anyone involved.
One narrative lapse proves intensely bothersome at the outset: Why does Amelia wait until the very day of her son's wedding to try to make arrangements for the kids? The film simply requires acceptance of this illogical situation, but one is inclined not to grant it.
Some viewers may also be bothered by the fact that the Japanese storyline initially seems unrelated to the other two, which are instantly connected. But its gathering strength, and the provocatively inventive ways Chieko's overwhelming frustration is externalized, make its cool surfaces and modernity welcome breaks from the hot, dusty settings of the other dramas.
As the Moroccan story plays out in bits and pieces, Richard and the heavily bleeding Susan are given refuge in a remote village while awaiting an ambulance and testing the patience of their fellow travelers, who suspect they're in danger of further attacks. Meanwhile, local police exercise little restraint as they try to put a cap on what rapidly becomes, given the current climate, an international incident.
The situation for the couple's far-away children and their nanny goes from bad to worse in Mexico, reaching genuinely harrowing levels during a lost-in-the-desert odyssey and incidentally touching on hot-button illegal immigrant and border security issues in strictly personal rather than political terms.
The Tokyo story, in the end, unwinds in the most unpredictable manner of the three, reaching a moving height of subjectivity when the soundtrack flips between sound and silence during a wild disco evening to underline Chieko's sensory remove and creatively conveying her aching need for an emotional connection.
The way the story resolutions are distributed among the various characters may disturb some discerning viewers in their racial/ethnic makeup, and there could be carping in some quarters about a degree of exoticism, despite the fact that Gonzalez Inarritu has gone to great lengths to properly portray all the locations, present everyone in an untouristy way (including the tourists) and cast non-pros recruited locally in many roles, very effectively so.
Unlike the strenuous dramatics on view in "21 Grams," stars involved at the top of the cast here deliver unshowy, naturalistic perfs. Pitt brings weight and strength that a lesser name might not have provided as Robert, who must endure the uncertainty of his wife's fate on one front and that of his children on another.
Blanchett spends most of the picture either in agony or passed out on the floor of a hut, but even this she does with customary elegance. Gael Garcia Bernal submerges his natural charm to play Amelia's unreliable nephew, whose only responsibility is to drive the group safely over the border and back.
Barraza makes abundantly manifest the rising panic and torment Amelia endures for her misjudgment, and both sets of kids--Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid as the Moroccan boys and Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble as the Yanks--are outstandingly expressive without histrionics or cutes.
Kikuchi, however, registers with the most challenging and distinctive perf as a teen who must communicate via sign language and feels a social and emotional outcast for all her physical allure.
Production contributions are excellent, with Rodrigo Prieto's rugged lensing at one with the mostly barren landscapes, Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise's editing adroitly intertwining the narrative threads and Gustavo Santaolalla's grave, inventively arranged original score supplementing numerous tunes on the soundtrack.

Time perhaps scrambling it's for Alejandro González Iñárritu  to stop his narratives. After making an exciting debut in 2000 with Amores Perros a movie whose gimmicky Tarantino-esque tinkering with structure seemed fresher en español  and grounded in gritty Mexico City location shootingGonzález Iñárritu apparently decided to devote his feature-film career to telling multipart stories in initially disconnected fragments. In theory, it's an ambitious gambit: a method that can cut off a viewer's dependence on narrative bottle-feeding.
In practiceat least in Babel , González Iñárritu's schematic new tract on the world's illsit's like Crash  rewritten by Yoda. The cheap ironies and rigged coincidences remain, only shuffled in sequence to produce easy mystification and a succession of late whammies. What starts as a kaleidoscopic study of tone-deaf culture collision and dislocation gives way to a hammy grand design parceled out on a need-to-know basis. It's conspiracy theory masquerading as humanism.
Taking a cue from the wrathful God of Genesisthe original union buster, who made the Tower of Babel 's builders speak in unknown tongues, thus dooming their scaffold to heavenBabel  scatters its tapestry of thwarted communication to the opposite ends of the earth. In hardscrabble wilderness, a Moroccan  goat herder sends his young sons (Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid) out to guard the flock, armed with a high-powered rifle. His only instruction: Keep the gun hidden.
A world away, in a ritzy San Diego home, a phone call strands Amelia (Adriana Barraza ), a conscientious nanny and off-the-books illegal, with her privileged charges (Elle Fanning  and Nathan Gamble ) just before she's to leave for her son's wedding in Tijuana . A cut away, married Richard (Brad Pitt ) and Susan (Cate Blanchett ) sit in brittle discomfort at a Moroccan café, cut off from each other by recent tragedy. In the most intriguingly extraneous plot thread, deaf-mute Tokyo teen Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi ) seethes with fury at her classmates and widowed dad (Koji Yakusho ), masking her misery with bursts of exhibitionist bravado.
Babel  keeps the entwined import of its four subplots compellingly vague for at least an hour. A more sure-footed exploration of fragmentary storytelling in its early scenes than either Amores Perros  or its follow-up, the fatally overwrought 21 Grams , the movie tantalizes with the possibility that for once González Iñárritu and his longtime screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga , won't feel the need to connect every strandthat they'll allow some of life's actual messiness to scuff their carefully faked disorder. Two bravura sequences in particulara boisterous idyll at the Tijuana wedding celebration, filtered through the Anglo kids' exhilarating confusion, and Chieko's ambient prowl through a dance club's muffled beats-per-minute murkhave an immersive texture unlike anything González Iñárritu has dared: a sense of human beings' complex interaction with a world of often contradictory stimuli.
Alas, they're also unlike anything else in Babel , which stacks contrivance upon contrivance as it trip-wires and time-shifts a series of climactic calamities to unfold almost in unisonan apparent bid to out-intolerate Intolerance . The director and screenwriter mean to show the butterfly effects of American arrogance and post9-11 solipsism throughout the world. Thus wealthy Californians Pitt and Blanchett turn their life-or-death dilemma into an international cause célébre, other tourists or citizens be damned, while the sweet blond children end up in a border-patrol wasteland. The Americans' linguistic helplessness becomes a dully literal metaphor for I-stand-alone isolationism.
Meanwhile, anti-terrorist hysteria places the Moroccan lads and their guiltless family in crosshairs. Only the lives of Americans matter, the movie wails: The filmmakers expect you to feel guilty when the white kids survive.
Yet the sentiment is less galling than the narrative contortions that put it across. Puzzle master Arriaga may be the Will Shortz of globalized hand-wringing, but the by-now-predictable jigsawing of his scripts reeks of desperation. In his 2000 feature Code Unknown , Michael Haneke  splintered his narrative even more radically, with jagged pieces that ended abruptly in blackouts. But those pieces encouraged a viewer to search for the connections that Haneke withheld their open-endedness produced something akin to cautious optimism.
Arriaga's script for Babel  offers only ham-handed determinismthe inevitable outcomes not of imperialist indifference but of a screenwriter's (one) trick bag. The pieces of the story are just a booby trap snapping into place. Amelia, therefore, will have to do the most impractical thing possible whenever she's confronted by authorities, to fulfill her conception as a martyr; a ne'er-do-well nephew (Gael García Bernal ) is trumped up to ensure she makes all the wrong choices. The movie's characters don't have any rights, but it ain't Uncle Sam who took them away.
Babel 's globe-trotting may dwell on the obviousMorocco is dusty, Tokyo glossybut cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto  seeks out particulars of light, texture, and location that go beyond mere tourism. And the actors bring some warmth and empathy to their narrowly conceived roles: Tarchani and Ait El Caid, affecting in their quaking transformation from bored kids to wanted men; Barraza, a terrified runner in deepening quicksand; Pitt and Blanchett, appealing even when their star power is used for ugly-American self-incrimination. In the end, though, they're simply dots to be connected, as if global unrest were just a cosmic game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon . Deserve better they all.
