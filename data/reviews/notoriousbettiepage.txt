         Bettie Page was neither the alpha nor the omega of pinup posing, she didn't do it first or last, but no one before or since has brought the same kind of incandescent delight to the job of being photographed in bathing suits, bondage apparatus or nothing at all. Which makes it all the more remarkable that the new film about her life and times, "The Notorious Bettie Page," is so completely glum, joyless and devoid of emotion.
 
  Page's ability to come completely alive in front of the camera made her a cult figure during the post-World War II years of her prime and a modern popular culture icon whose official website has received about 600 million hits since 2000. The new film captures the look of the period and, in star Gretchen Mol, has an actress who capably counterfeits Page's exuberance. What it doesn't have is a reason for being.
 


         






    As directed and co-written by Mary Harron, the uninvolving "Bettie Page" holds all actions at the same kind of ironic distance that characterized Harron's earlier films, "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho."
 
  Harron has said she was determined to be nonjudgmental about Page, to do justice to the woman's "mystery and ambiguity." In practice, however, that attitude plays as coldness, and Page, for all her remarkable zest, comes off as a not terribly interesting person we're given no incentive to become involved with. The problem is not the film's refusal to be what the director calls "reductive," it is in its inability to make Page someone whose story can hold us.
 
  Worse than that, audiences flailing around for a point of view will find that the film, so careful about its subject, has no such scruples where the opposite sex is concerned. Though there are exceptions, most of the invariably manipulative men in Page's life are venal, almost panting creatures whose hidden agendas and corrupting lusts taint everything they do.
 
  The fact that the ethereal Page is portrayed as having the saint-like ability to rise above all this doesn't make its one-dimensional portrait of men any less like something Warhol-shooter Valerie Solanis, the subject of Harron's first film and the founder of SCUM (the Society for Cutting Up Men), might approve of.
 
  Interestingly shot by Mott Hupfel in both color and black and white, "Bettie Page" begins in 1955, near the end of its subject's modeling career. We take you now to one of those seedy Times Square bookstores, where men furtively scan magazines with titles like Wink, Whisper and Flirt, and ask the clerk if he has "anything a little different, something with unusual footwear" or "material that shows restraint."
 
  The clerk knows that's code for bondage, but when he produces the goods he is busted as part of a congressional investigation of pornography. We first meet Page demurely waiting outside the hearing room where she has been called to testify, the soul of shy, soft-spoken politeness down to the white gloves on her hands. How did a good Southern lady get in a fix like this?
 
  Back we go to Nashville, 1936, and a teenage Page dealing with a father who might be molesting her and a stern mother who refuses to allow her daughter to date. Page just misses out on a college scholarship and marries young to a violent husband, whom she leaves only to be sexually assaulted by a group of men. Is it any wonder that in 1949 she hops a Greyhound and flees to New York?
 
  Noticed on the beach by an amateur photographer, Page soon becomes a sought-after model, a good soul whose mottos are "What's the harm in it?" and "I sure can try." She comes to the attention of bondage-meisters Irving Klaw (Chris Bauer) and his sister Paula (Lili Taylor), who treat Page like family while involving her in outre bondage poses.
 
  The film leaves Page, always a religious person who occasionally muses, "I don't know what God thinks about this," having a born-again experience and rededicating her life to Christ. Her real-life later years, including a charge of attempted murder and years spent in a mental hospital, are outside this film's purview. For which we should be grateful.

It has often been said that Bettie Page, the legendary '50s pinup with the pert features framed by those famously severe black bangs, was the rare American sex goddess who was equally at home projecting the image of a good girl or a bad girl. Frolicking, naked, in the ocean foam, her leg extended with playful pleasure, she was all dazzle and sunshine: the girl next door who said yes yes yes. In her scandalous underground bondage photos, where she posed as a dominatrix with a whip held high, or as a masochist with a ball in her mouth, she vamped like a pussycat from hell, her eyes narrowing with mean delight  or widening in mock terror. Yet the mysterious alchemy of Bettie Page isn't just that she could turn on a dime from light to dark, saint to sinner, virgin to vixen. It's that she was somehow able to project both qualities at once. In the bondage photos, so shocking for their time, her warm, spirited, peekaboo vibrance doesn't disappear; it's there just beneath the surface aggression of her poses. As for her all-American cheesecake shots, they have a quality of delirious, laughing abandon, as though she were winking at  the she-devil inside. What Bettie Page conjured  always  was the promise of pleasure without limits. She was a one-woman orgy in centerfold form.
Yet who, exactly, was she? The Notorious Bettie Page , Mary Harron's frisky and fascinating biopic, lets us know  sort of. Gretchen Mol, as Bettie, gets that naughty/nice erotic charisma to an astonishing degree. Soft, eager, and polite, with a twang that only enhances her apple-pie sweetness, Bettie, a demure Christian girl from the outskirts of Nashville, arrives in New York City in 1949 with dreams of becoming an actress. The movie presents her as a traditional girl, caught in a society that runs on men's whims, with a free spirit locked deep inside her. She wouldn't look out of place in a typing pool, yet the one thing she truly knows, for all her modesty, is that she's pretty, so when a man on the beach asks her to model for some photographs, she thinks, Why not?
Posing for amateur ''camera clubs,'' Bettie gets in touch with her inner exhibitionist. As she strolls through the woods with one of the club members, she volunteers to take off her bikini top, then her bottom, too, and suddenly, her skin shines, her smile is flirty glee, and she wiggles her rump in triumph. Standing, in her full tawny glory, in the sun, like Norma Jean before she became Marilyn Monroe, Mol is more than radiant; she makes Bettie's blissful lack of self-consciousness a magical state. Bettie, in a strange way, is never more Christian than when she asserts the holiness of her own body. Later, in the studio of Irving Klaw (Chris Bauer), who does fetish photographs for specialty clients, she puts on all that bondage gear  corsets, leather boots laced up her thigh  as if it were a sci-fi costume, and when the photographer, a gently scurrilous bloke (Jared Harris), asks her to snarl like a tiger, she does, and beautifully, but she's really just a little girl playing dress-up.
Harron has a great time staging these scenes as a demented workplace sitcom, with Klaw, a sad lump of a fellow who's always in a sweat, and his sister, Paula (Lili Taylor), catering to the tastes of their clients as if they were selling appliances. If Bettie, in joining up with the Klaws, were simply a dim bulb, her innocence might have come off as a malicious joke. Instead, the great joke of The Notorious Bettie Page  is that it's precisely Bettie's purity  her eager, trusting wholesomeness  that allows her to radiate sexuality without a trace of inhibition or shame. Framed by the Estes Kefauver indecency hearings, the movie says that in an era  the 1950s  that regarded sex as perversity and scandal and even crime, something restricted to the underground, it took a nice girl who couldn't see perversity (because she didn't feel it) to turn ''sin'' into the sexy-sublime.
Shot in satiny period black and white, with shifts to tropical postcard color whenever Bettie visits the ''paradise'' of Florida, The Notorious Bettie Page  is a comedy of high freakishness that invites us to climb deep into the mystique of Bettie Page's image, her phenomenon. Yet the movie doesn't probe her interior life in any revelatory way. I wish that Harron had given us a more detailed and intimate view of Bettie's relationships with men (the boyfriend she meets in acting class remains a sketchy nice guy), or of her partnership with Bunny Yeager (Sarah Paulson), the pinup model-turned-photographer who created some of Page's most memorable images. The movie, in a sense, is just like Bettie's photos: all glorious surface. The Notorious Bettie Page  captures, with seductive finesse, how Bettie Page happened, yet what it leaves us with is the tantalizing enigma of a girl who couldn't truly be ''bad'' because she made sex divinely delicious.

 FOR a few blissfully underdressed years in the 1950's, Bettie Page was the pinup queen of the universe, or at least of lockers, garage walls and private stashes across the country. Blessed with a killer body and the perkiest smile this side of Sandra Dee, Ms. Page (she turns 83 this month) looked equally at ease wearing a homemade bikini or a fine mist of ocean spray. And while few people looked as happy naked as she did — the young actress Gretchen Mol, who plays her in Mary Harron's exuberant biographical film "The Notorious Bettie Page," comes charmingly close — in 1957  she buttoned her sweater for good, leaving the neon world of titillation and tease without a trace.  For years, Bettie Page was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. Although she did her share of cheesecake, even gracing Playboy in nothing but a Santa hat and a rosy blush, she achieved her initial infamy as a bondage model. (Later, it was her disappearing act that fueled her notoriety.) In the early 1950's, she began working with the brother-and-sister team Irving and Paula Klaw (played by Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor), posing for untold numbers of photographs and 8- and 16-millimeter film loops with such self-evident titles as "Betty's Exotic Dance in High Heels." (Her first name was usually misspelled.) To satisfy the specialty market, the Klaws on occasion tied up their most popular model and stuck a ball gag in her mouth.  In all likelihood it was these more outré images of Bettie crawling along a carpet in fetish heels or daintily spanking another seminude cutie that caught the government's censorious attention. (Now these fantasies seem almost quaint.) In 1955, Senator Estes Kefauver, a Tennessee Democrat and presidential hopeful who five years earlier had chased crime bosses like Frank Costello, turned his attention to pornography. (Around the same time, this same atomic-age Comstock helped put a muzzle on the comic-book industry in the name of preventing juvenile delinquency.) Ms. Harron and her screenwriting partner, Guinevere Turner, open their story with Bettie waiting to testify before  Kefauver's subcommittee, shut out of the courtroom where a succession of men are lecturing one another on the evils of scantily clad women.  Perhaps because Ms. Harron wrote about punk music in the 1970's (hers is one of the contributing voices in Legs McNeil's oral history of the scene, "Please Kill Me"), she comes across as the kind of enlightened chick who knows how to have a good time. Both of her previous features, "I Shot Andy Warhol," about the Pop artist's would-be assassin,  Valerie Solanas, and "American Psycho," her excellent appropriation (and evisceration) of Bret Easton Ellis's  novel,  exhibit a shrewd, at times bitingly funny intelligence when it comes to what women want and why. In her work with Ms. Turner, in particular, who was also her screenwriting partner on "American Psycho" (Ms. Turner also helped write the lipstick-lesbian romance "Go Fish"), Ms. Harron manages to have her pleasure, visual and otherwise, and her politics, too.  In this regard she receives terrific support from her obviously enthusiastic star. Until now, Ms. Mol has been best known for her premature designation several years ago as Hollywood's newest It Girl. The label seemed to plague her, and she all but faded from view despite promising turns in little-seen films. Maybe because she felt protected by her female director and female producers (six out of seven), or emboldened by the material, or maybe because she knows how beautiful her gently padded silhouette looks in the raw, Ms. Mol takes to this tricky role with the carefree expressivity you tend to see only in young children who have learned the joys of nudity, usually when their parents are throwing a dinner party. When she strips, Bettie soars.  That's to the good of the film because while the pinup was mildly notorious, the fully dressed woman wasn't all that interesting. Born in Tennessee in 1923, she studied to be a teacher, veering into modeling after landing in New York. Initially, she posed for camera clubs, shutterbug groups that paid models for private sessions. (A year before she hung up her garters, The New York Times ran a classified advertisement for one such session: "Shoot model in glamorous clothes eves 8 PM, Sat 2 PM Bettie Page and others. Concord Camera Circle, 118 W 47th St.") Rather surprisingly, some of the clubs were racially integrated, and it was a black man, Jerry Tibbs (Kevin Carroll), who gave Bettie her trademark when he suggested bangs to obscure her prominent forehead.  Ms. Harron moves fluidly through Bettie's early years, which included brutal abuse that might have had something to do with why she entered a profession that allowed her to create and control a sexualized image of herself. Even so, while Ms. Harron and Ms. Turner don't shy away from these dark episodes — and, notably, end Bettie's story before age and the really bad times intrude — they are too smart to draw a direct line between the traumas and the person who survived them. A self-made woman, Bettie Page created an enduringly resonant persona out of an arsenal of smiles and sneers, and her impressively pliant figure. Depending on the costume, the photographer (two of the finest were women, Paula Klaw and Bunny Yeager) and her own ingenuity, she was a dark angel, a harem girl, a naturist or a very naughty miss, but she was also always her own woman.  If the inner Bettie remains somewhat out of focus here, even to the beatific finale, it's largely because what made her a sensation — both in the 1950's and the 1980's revival that made her into a modern cult figure —  wasn't  her acting aspirations or the religious convictions that might have pushed her to leave modeling, but that she was a genius of the body. It's a truism of art history that while men act, women appear, smiling demurely away from the gaze of the viewer. In many of her photographs, by contrast, Bettie looks straight into the camera with a grin that is by turns twinkling and devouring, and flips that old truism on its head by turning her appearance into a performance. She knows what you want; she wants it, too.  In keeping with its subject, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is principally a work of gorgeous surfaces, shot mostly in silvery black-and-white film by the cinematographer Mott Hupfel, with an occasional splash of saturated color. Like the Klaws, Ms. Harron ties Bettie up and ties her down, puts her in towering boots and cinched corsets. Every so often, she complicates the story a little, as when she introduces John Willie (Jared Harris in top form), the bondage artist and publisher of Bizarre magazine, who devised some of Bettie's more outrageous poses. When he asks Bettie how she reconciles her love for God with her profession, she refers to Adam and Eve naked in the Garden of Eden. John Willie's idea of paradise wears more clothes, but he gets the picture, ball gag or no.  "The Notorious Bettie Page" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes female nudity, kinky outfits, bondage and intimations of sadomasochism. 

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

"The Notorious Bettie Page" reps a missed opportunity. A superficial look at the '50s sex icon, pic feels like it was researched via press clippings rather than attempting a fresh rethinking of its era and provocative subject. Tame and unsexy by the standards of HBO, which will broadcast the film after bigscreen release in March via Picturehouse, this looks like a non-starter theatrically. 
In stark contrast to her boldly incisive first two features, "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," director Mary Harron's work here seems curiously uninvolved. There's no sense of any particular commitment to the leading character, who comes off as a perfectly ordinary woman, other than the fact that she happily posed for nudie photographs that, in their era, were considered racy, even kinky.
Result is a strangely placid, unchallenging picture with no blood in its veins. Gretchen Mol is splendid to behold in every stage of dress or undress, but Harron and co-scenarist Guinevere Turner offer no clues as to what might be going on inside the dark-haired beauty's head and heart. As Bettie Page was a sexual fetish for '50s men, so does she seem little more than a cultural fetish for these modern filmmakers.
As framed here, Bettie's journey is one from Jesus to Sodom and back again, a trip admirably described nonjudgmentally, but with no insight either.
After an apt B-movieish opening documenting the bust of a Times Square dirty-magazine store and some Senate pornography hearings, pic briefly charts Bettie's poor, God-fearing youth in '30s Nashville, her failed wartime marriage and a gang rape that seems to hasten her departure for New York City in 1949.
As in George Clooney's "Good Night, and Good Luck.," decision to shoot in black-and-white is well justified by the frequent intercutting between dramatic footage and archival docu material (mostly unfamiliar and well chosen), as well as by the fact that the most famous images of Page are monochromatic.
Still, the bursts into vibrant color for Page's "nudist" photo sessions, as well as for her visits to Florida, reveal one significant downside: Mol comes dazzlingly alive in color in a way she doesn't in B&W, which increasingly puts a mild damper on the predominantly shades-of-gray picture. 
As shaped here, Bettie's life is heavily determined by her unguarded acceptance of proposals made by men during chance encounters. One such key overture is made on a beach by a black cop who dabbles in photography. Not only do the innocuous photos he takes get Bettie's face and figure in print, but he redoes her hair with the bangs for which she would forever after be known.
Sliding into a completely unexplored relationship with fellow acting student Marvin (Jonathan Woodward), Bettie quickly becomes a favorite of "nature" and girlie mag photogs, with whom she exhibits no hesitation about removing her clothes. She eventually ends up in the grip of the Klaws (Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor), a nice middle-aged couple who just happen to specialize in mild S&M and bondage photographs.
The pertinent photo shoots are represented as silly, playful affairs that were just "pretend" to Bettie, who seems entirely unaffected by appearing in them. Increasingly, her life comes to look like a sad collection of missed opportunities: a narrowly denied scholarship, a busted marriage, failed auditions and unfulfilled relationships.
Pic is particularly derelict on the last count, as it presents a Bettie Page with no active emotional life and scarcely a sexual one. Could this have been true? Most of the photographers she works with are too nerdy or unsavory to qualify for her attention, and Woodward's Marvin is a cardboard figure. At one point, Bettie picks up a buff Caribbean lad in Miami for recreational purposes, but it's a crucial failing that we never know what Bettie wants, either amorously or professionally.
Ending, in which an adrift Bettie reclaims Jesus, is nicely handled, with no condescension and with her insistence that she's not ashamed of anything she has done in her life. Absent, however, is any end-credits info on what happened to her subsequently.
Mol's Bettie is compliant, almost always open to any request and never disagreeable. But her lack of spine and inner turmoil make her a central figure of limited interest, that rare dramatic heroine with no ambition or goal.
Supporting cast is just serviceable. But it's disconcerting to see David Strathairn, at the moment of his triumph as Edward R. Murrow fighting the right-wingers in "Good Night, and Good Luck.," here portraying Sen. Estes Kefauver as a morals crusader.
Produced on a budget, pic has an OK grasp of period but explores the culture in only the most obvious ways that emphasize an outwardly puritanical society trying to resist internal decay. As one of the political investigators notes, "Communism will never defeat America. No, it's something within."

Half a century after her apotheosis as America's most popular pinup queen and under-the-counter bondage babe, 25 years after her cult first manifested itself in comix and fanzines, '50s icon Bettie Page  has her biopic. Can the star on Hollywood Boulevard be far behind?
Actually, The Notorious Bettie Page , directed by Mary Harron  from a script written with Guinevere Turner , isn't Bettie's first feature. There have been several documentaries and straight-to-video dramatizations of her careernot to mention Jennifer Connelly 's turn as the Bettie-styled heroine in the 1991 adaptation of Bettie-smitten Dave Stevens's retro comic book The Rocketeer . What distinguishes Harron's project is its propriety; in its avoidance of schmutz, it might have been directed with the white gloves favored by Gretchen Mol 's prim-when-not-posing Bettie.
Like one recent DVD compilation of the peep show pageants Bettie made for special-interest photographer Irving Klaw , Harron's biopic opens with a peek at the innocent raunch of mid-'50s Times Square . Unlike the DVD, however, The Notorious Bettie Page  shows a hapless fan being busted for the crime of buying the bondage stuff, then cuts to the juvenile delinquency hearings conducted by Senator Estes Kefauver  (near look-alike David Strathairn ). Klaw's "pornography" was blamed for a teenage boy's inadvertent death and he was called to testifyas was Bettie, introduced demurely sitting in the outside corridor.
A movie more attuned to historical ragtime might have made something of the fact that Kefauver, then running for president, and Bettie were both native Tennesseansand that, thanks to Walt Disney , that state's greatest son, Davy Crockett , was in the process of providing American juveniles with a new, wonderfully merchandizable role model. The Notorious Bettie Page  is not all that far from Disneyland , but there is room for only one icon. Harron flashes back to establish Bettie's fundamentalist background and the miracle of her innate, if abused, trusting nature.
Without ever losing her essential innocence, Bettie makes the transition from small-town sex object to big-city camera-club model and beyond. Mol's fetchingly bewigged Bettie is a simple country girlGod-fearing and teetotaling. Dreaming of a stage career and studying the Method, she's cheerfully game for any sort of dress-up (or down). Bettie can't act but she can posethat's the source of her pleasure, and that pleasure is infectious. So too her good nature: Bettie's goodness transforms the world. She is impervious to exploitation. Even the Klaws are shown as an affable pair of trolls. Irving  (Chris Bauer ) offers his models "some beautiful sliced brisket" while sister Paula (Lili Taylor ) teaches the lesson of erotic tolerance: "It takes all types."
What type was Bettie? A beautiful brunette in the age of blonde bombshells, a superstar in the seedy sub-Hollywood  of the Times Square peep show, she is often conceptualized as a Bizarro World version of her near contemporary Marilyn Monroe . Both women were natural exhibitionists who projected not cold self-involvement but friendly generosity. Marilyn, as Norman Mailer  wrote, "suggested that sex might be difficult or dangerous with others, but ice cream with her." That was all the more true of Bettie, given her job as masturbation fodder and her starring roles in Klaw's bargain-basement s/m romps.
The dankest dungeon would be warmed in the sunshine of Bettie's smile or crumble under the force of her wink. All is fun. Even more childlike in her enthusiasm than Marilyn, she never seems happier than when prancing around in her underwear and a pair of nine-inch heels. Hers was essentially a solo actand Harron's movie doesn't violate that solitude. Bettie exists for the camera; she is to be looked at but never touched. Although their script assigns her several lovers, the closest the filmmakers come to placing their heroine in a sexual situation is signaling her father's abuse or dramatizing the (offscreen) gang rape that sends Bettie from the hell of Nashville to the heaven of Times Square.
And a glorious place it is. As demonstrated in I Shot Andy Warhol  , Harron has a tremendous feel for period detail. There's a hyper-real, if unavoidably airbrushed, quality to her loving reconstructions of Bettie's iconic poses and Klaw's tawdry scenarios. And as with Tim Burton 's similarly reverent and even more fetishistic Ed Wood  , there's a whiff of embalming fluid. Not just art but life must be fixed for eternity. Burton solved the problem of Wood's sordid career by granting the "world's worst director" a success he never actually enjoyed. Ever self-sufficient, Bettie took care of that herself. In the late '50s, she gave up modeling and found Jesus. Her soul was saved even as her image was preserved on film.
Marilyn died for our sins. Bettie lived to grant us dispensation. ("We're laughing all the time while we're doing this," she explains to her wildly disapproving boyfrienda serious actorwhen he discovers the Klawful truth.) Indeed, the movie's most hilariously obvious scene has Bettie trussed up, crucifixion-style, taking advantage of a break in the filming to prompt the director to remove her ball gag so she can explain her belief that she's been blessed with a God-given talent for posing.
Rather than cast Bettie as a sex martyr of the repressive '50s, Harron and Turner contemplate her born-again beatitude. (They don't, however, mention her years of work as a counselor for the Reverend Billy Graham a photo op, surely, for the ages.) Last seen, Bettie is preaching in a Miami park, giving herself to the lost souls she finds with the same open joy as she had offered her image to the great unloved.
Not for nothing is this movie opening on Good Friday. It can be as boring as church. There's no snake in Bettie's Eden and no narrative to Harron's movie. It's more of an altar piece: Our Lady of the Garter Belt, the Fastidious Bettie Page.
