Buried somewhere within the bipolar extravaganza that is The Invasion is an awfully good movie that got away.
The Nicole Kidman thriller is the fourth film version of the alien-paranoia classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers  previously filmed in 1956, 1978, and 1993  and to understand its problems, you have to know some Hollywood back story.
Written by hot young screenwriter David Kajganich and directed by German filmmaker Oliver Hirschbiegel (who made the 2004 Hitlers-last-days movie Downfall), The Invasion was filmed in 2005. Producer Joel Silver, that purveyor of commercially successful wham-bam, decided Hirschbiegels cut didnt work and put it on the shelf for a year, ultimately bringing in the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix) to dream up some action scenes and James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to reshoot them last fall.
Memo to Silver: This never works. It never has. Get it through your head  trusting the original vision is always the better idea. As an example of creative (or desperate) editing meant to salvage a compromised project, The Invasion is a fascinating object lesson. As a sci-fi thriller, sadly, its a mess.
From what I can tell, Hirschbiegel and Kajganichs original had two great notions. The first is that Kidman already seems like an alien replicant. The Invasion is set in Washington, D.C., where Dr. Carol Bennell (Kidman) is a psychiatrist and single mom with a young son named Oliver (Jackson Bond). The action kicks in seconds after the opening credits, with the unexpected crash landing of the space shuttle bearing alien spores. Within hours  or days, or weeks; its hard to tell  people start behaving oddly, emotionlessly. Theyre no longer who they were but part of an eerie hive mind.
The gimmick is that Kidmans heroine starts the film as a cool, maternal zombie  never has the actress more resembled a porcelain doll  only to fall apart and become a stressed-out human as the virus takes root in the population. She has to lose control to remember she has a soul. There are no pods this time; as Carols ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) demonstrates, the spores are passed from person to person in an icky spew of green bile. Then you go to sleep, your DNA is re-engineered, and you wake up part of an alien ant colony.
The movies other brilliantly perverse idea: This might not be such a bad thing. In shards of overheard news footage, we realize that peace is breaking out all over the planet: Iraq, Israel, North Korea. Why fight when were all one big organism anyway? Is individuality a fair trade for global harmony? As The Invasion hurtles forward, fraying at the seams, the audience is put in the extremely odd position of rooting for both the humans and the aliens.
Thats the intent. At least, I think it is. There are two movies here, and the more simplistic one ends up in charge. Carols friend and brooding love interest, a doctor named Ben (Daniel Craig), gets a fair amount of business, but other characters have been thwacked back to brief appearances: Josef Sommer and Celia Weston get one good scene as Bens aging Eastern European friends, the Belicecs, as does Roger Rees, playing a cynical Russian diplomat. The gifted Jeffrey Wright is handed chunks of exposition as a lab researcher, then hustled off-screen.
Also present is Veronica Cartwright  nice to know she survived the 1978 version  as one of Carols patients. Her failure to go alien on schedule tilts The Invasion into an increasingly preposterous final 30 minutes, where characters hastily theorize about immunities and embark on long, frenetic car chases. The spectacularly eerie vibe the earlier scenes have built up, almost in spite of themselves, dies in a din of crushed fenders and gunshots. The films rewritten ending is  theres no other word for it  pathetic, a laughable attempt to patch closure onto a nightmare. Is there irony intended? Are we supposed to mourn the serene, dull alien Earth that almost is? By now, the storytellings much too confused to tell.
In the way that certain baseball games become pitchers duels, some movies are cutting-room battles. The credited editors on The Invasion are Hans Funck and Joel Negron; the first cut Downfall, the second movies like Man of the House and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. One is Hirschbiegels man, the other Joel Silvers. At times, you can actually see their two versions of the film wrestling, as scenes leap forward in time and then suddenly jump back.
At other moments, you sense the stately, almost monochromatic dread of Funcks cut between the sutures of meat-and-potatoes suspense, the nip-and-tuck of the hired plastic surgeon. Who knows what this movie could have been? The Invasion died on the operating-room table, and were just watching the wake.


         "Help me," the young woman screams. "They're coming, they're among us." No one on screen is paying attention, but we know what it means.
 
 That's right, the body snatchers are once again on the prowl. "The Invasion," starring the upscale duo of Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, is the third remake of what was once a humble B picture, 1956's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Still effectively creepy and surprisingly unnerving despite the occasional misstep and rumors of a troubled production, the new film illustrates why and how the power of the original story remains undiminished more than half a century after its creation.
 


         






   The core of that tale remains as it was conceived by science fiction adept Jack Finney, screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring and top director Don Siegel. Mysterious entities from outer space, pods in the original, spores in the current version, attempt to take over the world by creating zombie-like replicas of everyone and his brother. Gradually a few folks catch on and attempt against long odds to save the beleaguered human race.
 
 "Invasion" has been brought up to the minute with characters who text message each other and references to Iraq, Darfur and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. More to the point, it remains fascinating how effortlessly the story, here written by David Kajganich for German director Oliver Hirschbiegel, manages to dovetail with whatever is troubling in the zeitgeist, which in this case includes worries about global pandemics and the excessive powers of governments gone wild.
 
 Finally, the success of "Invasion" boils down to the crisp execution (Hirschbiegel's last film was the Hitler-in-extremis epic "Downfall") of the film's familiar but still disturbing concept. As a wife (played by Veronica Cartwright, a veteran of the 1978 Phil Kaufman-directed version) says to her psychiatrist early on, "This is going to sound so stupid or crazy or both, but my husband is not my husband."
 
 Given that almost anyone who goes to see "The Invasion" will know its storyline, the film makes the shrewd choice of starting with a flash-forward to the pulse-pounding middle of the film, when heroine Carol Bennell (Kidman) is ransacking a wrecked pharmacy for pills to keep her awake. Because it is while you sleep that the transformation from human to alien takes place, and that is something very much to be avoided.
 
 The plot proper starts with the mysterious crash of a space shuttle, complete with wreckage contaminated by a relentless organism, that causes one scientist to note, with more passion than grammar, "One thing is for sure, it ain't from around here."
 
 Nothing if not industrious, the organism immediately infects Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), a highly placed Centers for Disease Control official who is also Carol Bennell's estranged ex-husband. They have a child named Oliver (the likable Jackson Bond in his feature debut) to whom Carol is completely devoted, which makes her reluctant to give him to Tucker for a few days when her ex mysteriously shows up and demands visitation rights.
 
 Since she was the psychiatrist who heard that troubled wife's confession, Carol has some sense that things are not right with the world. She confides in her hunky best friend, a doctor named Ben Driscoll (Craig), who in turn talks to a scientist named Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), and while the trio gradually figures out what is going on, that doesn't necessarily help them put a stop to the alien invasion or get little Oliver back from his sinister dad.
 
 Inevitably, this "Invasion" does some things differently than its predecessors. There is, if memory serves, greater narrative focus here than in the previous versions on the need to stay awake, and there is also a wonderful counterintuitive speech by one character talking convincingly about how glorious it is to have your mind and body taken over by aliens.
 
 And while parts of the film suffer from either unoriginality or excessive implausibility, "Invasion" does very well, aided by an effective John Ottman score, in conveying the bump-in-the-dark terror of having armies of implacable zombies relentlessly tracking you down like Sherlock Holmes on the trail of an enormous hound.
 
 This "Invasion" is aided considerably by having actors of the caliber of Kidman and Craig in the leading roles. Doing the opposite of slumming, both performers put their considerable talent in the service of bringing credibility to a pulp premise that has kept people up at night for more than 50 years and promises to do so for some time into the future.
 
 
  "The Invasion." MPAA rating: PG-13 for violence, disturbing images and terror. Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes. In general release.   

People are turning into pods. They lack feeling, nuance, individuality. They speak and act more or less alike, and they have no tolerance for anyone who dares to be different. If you hear that description and think, ''Gee, what else is new?'' then you're right on the wavelength of the so-horrible-it's-funny nightmare  or, at least, what ought to be the nightmare  of The Invasion , the fourth adaptation of Jack Finney's 1955 sci-fi thriller novel, The Body Snatchers . Here, once again, people are being turned into alien drones  and it's hard to tell.
In movies, the fun of this material (apart, of course, from the alien seed pods that look like giant cucumbers) has always been its metaphorical-sociological zap. The great, spooky Invasion of the Body Snatchers  (1956) took off from the Commie witch hunts of the '50s, and also from the general buttoned-down ''normality'' of the Eisenhower era. The richly disturbing 1978 remake caught that moment when the counterculture morphed, with sinister invisibility, into the yuppie culture. (Abel Ferrara's 1994 version was barely released.)
And The Invasion ? The first sign of how low the director, Oliver Hirschbiegel, has set the bar comes when Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist, meets with one of her patients, a woman who claims her husband ''is not my husband.'' The shrink's solution is to change the patient's medication. You'd think that a movie that was out to update the concept of creepy conformity might take an opportunity to tweak our society's use of psychotropic drugs to shape personality; instead, it's all for it. You'd also hope it might have fun with how our behavior is manipulated by technology, or fashion, or corporate style, or reality TV, or God knows what else.
But no. The Invasion  is the first body-snatchers movie that has zero in the way of social-satirical consciousness. The movie isn't terrible; it's just low-rent and reductive. It's so eager to cut to the formulaic, heebie-jeebies showdown between the blank-voiced ''pod people'' and the survivors who are desperate to escape them that it scarcely bothers to establish the humanity that's being saved. This is just a glorified zombie movie: 28 Days Later  with monsters  they even spread the virus by vomiting!  that look like you and me.
Nicole Kidman, with her doll-like features and slightly glassy passivity, may not be the best choice to play the emotional savior of the human race. Daniel Craig, as her physician suitor, gets little chance to show his unruly charisma. At a dinner party, Carol is bamboozled by a Russian who sounds so nuts it takes a moment to realize he's voicing the film's ''philosophy'': that people are supposed to be violent, not peaceful. The movie has a bit of fun with this idea, in the news reports that flash on TV as the aliens take over. Suddenly, all the world's conflicts  Iraq, Darfur  are solved, as if the villains had taken their cue from John Lennon's ''Imagine.'' But we're never shown the danger of this all-tranquillity-all-the-time idea on a personal level. The Invasion  gets you rooting for the aliens to be defeated, but the film's soul feels as if it had already been snatched.

 The latest and lamest version of Don Siegel’s 1956 pulp classic “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (from the Jack Finney novel) might have been an accidental camp classic if its politics weren’t so abhorrent and the movie didn’t try to hide its ineptitude behind a veil of pomposity. A miscast Nicole Kidman stars as a Washington-area shrink who’s so deep in her own little world she doesn’t initially notice that everyone else appears to be mainlining antidepressants. Maybe they’re former patients. Or maybe all those tight skirts she wears have cut off her circulation. That certainly must explain why she barely notices Daniel Craig, wasted here as her best friend.  Whatever the case, “The Invasion” lurches and drags and teeters on the brink of death from scene to scene; it plays as if it had been made by someone in a trance, though not a cool one. The glaring technical glitches are just the beginning. The film looks murky and at times blurred (the cinematographer has done fine work elsewhere), and it’s been badly overedited in a transparent bid to goose the action, to create a suggestion of narrative tension. But nonsensical jump-cuts and incoherent flash-forwards can’t raise the dead. That said, the vomiting does look great. (The aliens spread their evil ways by hurling like booze-soaked frat boys, a gesture that takes on increasingly symbolic weight as the movie plays and peters out.)  The producer Joel Silver has said that “The Invasion” was partly redone by the Wachowski brothers (the credited screenwriter is David Kajganich) and that, at some point during production, the directing chores were handed over to their sometime collaborator, James McTeigue, who performed the same duties on the almost equally moribund “V for Vendetta.” (The original director here, Oliver Hirschbiegel, retains credit.)  The Wachowskis’ bludgeoning touch can be felt in some laughable dinnertime chitchat during which Ms. Kidman’s character grandly announces that she’s a “postmodern feminist” to a guy with a cartoon Russian accent. Rather less amusing is the creepy ideology that seeps into the movie and informs its denouement, one suggesting that to be human is to be purely and violently self-interested — a pod person of a kind, but with a gun.  “The Invasion” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Violence and vomit.

All good things must come to an end -- in this case, the lucky streak that's made every adaptation of Jack Finney's 1955 sci-fi novel "The Body Snatchers" distinctive and effective, until now. Troubled production "The Invasion" -- of which the Wachowski brothers reportedly reshot at least a third after helmer Oliver Hirschbiegel's cut failed to please suits -- emerges a slick but forgettable, characterless thriller. Lure of Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig's first post-Bond role and large-scale PG-13 action-horror could produce OK opening numbers, but steep falloff is guaranteed. Ancillary may drag pic into the eventual black.
Though none has been a box office behemoth, every prior version of this tale has worked on its own terms: Don Siegel's classic small-town-Americana "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956); Philip Kaufman's witty same-named 1978 San Francisco update; "Body Snatchers" (1993), Abel Ferrara's creepsome military-base take; and even Robert Rodriguez's gleeful "The Faculty" (1998), an unacknowledged but obvious transcription that cannily turned alien possession into another form of high school peer pressure.
Perhaps auds will eventually get to see what German helmer Hirschbiegel, making his English-language feature debut, and scenarist David Kajganich intended in director's-cut DVD form. Purportedly it was offbeat, politically barbed and quasi-documentary in style. Those qualities are MIA in the current "Invasion," whose occasional nods to earlier versions (Veronica Cartwright, memorable in the Kaufman version, has a brief role here) only serve as a reminder of how much better they were.
The disintegration of a space shuttle making unplanned re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere leaves a trail of debris that turns out to be contaminated with highly contagious alien spores. Among the first infected is Center for Disease Control honcho Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), who's thus in a position to help the pandemic swiftly infiltrate government, media, police and other social infrastructures. Thus, what's publicized as a mere "dangerous flu virus" is in fact turning people into emotionless automatons whose first priority is to entrap human holdouts.
Tucker's ex-wife happens to be Washington, D.C. psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman), who's not pleased when, after years of disinterest, he suddenly wants to see their young son, Oliver (Jackson Bond). She reluctantly drops the boy off for a sleepover, then spends the evening at a diplomats' dinner party on the arm of Ben Driscoll (Craig), a doctor who'd like to be more than her best friend. Returning home late that night, she's nearly home-invaded by a scary alleged census worker.
The next day, almost everybody seems weirder -- and after just 40 minutes, the movie starts unsubtly inserting jump-cut flashbacks (then flash-forwards), as if auds couldn't be trusted to catch already obvious clues that something is amiss. Carol is imperiled in successive overblown chase sequences, trying to recover Oliver (who's conveniently immune to the infection) with allies Ben and his colleague Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright).
While earlier interpretations made Finney's premise metaphorically vivid, this "Invasion" feels like a self-canceling mix of creative and commercial decisions.
It's a clever touch that backgrounded news reports show all global conflicts neutralized in the wake of the pandemic. But in the end, pic seems to awkwardly suggest war and violence as primary things that "make us human," a message one doubts the director of Hitler drama "Downfall" intended. Conversely, there's rote injection of family-values sentiment as a primary narrative drive ("No one touches my child!" yelps an armed Kidman as she blows away several replicants).
Since the spores take over during sleep, Kidman at least has stay-awake exhaustion to play. But neither she nor Craig, who has relatively few scenes, can make their dully written characters compelling. As is often the case, Northam is the best thing here, though even his deft, sinister underplaying can't salvage a scene in which Tucker acts like a stereotypical bad-ex-husband rageaholic, despite conversion to zombiedom.
Tech and design contributions are pro but fail to create any unique atmosphere, suspense or visual interest. Perhaps the sole distinguishing element in this "Invasion" is that it provides a new transmission route oh-so-characteristic of our filmic era: projectile barfing.
