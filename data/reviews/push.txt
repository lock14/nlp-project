"Push" is that rare humans-with-superpowers movie where the powers are contagious. It made me feel psychic.
Suddenly I found myself able to predict what Dakota Fanning would say next, where Chris Evans would put his hands, what Camilla Belle's face might do. OK, that last one doesn't make me psychic since Belle doesn't express much. Her pretty, motionless face suggests a statue in a coma. And the camera's insistence on lingering upon it for what feels like minutes at a time is just one sign that this flaccid bid for franchisehood suffers from woeful judgment.
The film doesn't hail from a comic-book series or graphic novel but from a screenwriter (David Bourla) whose imagination seems full of such things. It's "Heroes: The Movie," minus the energy. Like that series, as well as "Jumper," last year's teleportation slog, "Push" tries to create its own universe of superhumans - mind-readers, telekinetics, supersonic screamers, and more - turned into warring factions. Not much of it makes sense. The rest isn't terribly interesting.
The opening minutes require Fanning to narrate a hectic explanation of how these superhumans came to be: Nazi experiments, psychological warfare, modern scientists who want them for killer weapons, and so on. Fanning fails to explain why most of the action unfolds in Hong Kong.
The cynical reasoning is that a big Asian locale would goose the movie's international box office. Mostly, though, Hong Kong is just an elaborate backdrop in which people run through restaurants, outdoor markets, pleasure palaces, and high-rise construction sites looking for a briefcase containing a single syringe. Once injected, its contents will create super-superhumans.
Fanning is what the film calls a Watcher. Evans is a Mover. Belle is a Pusher. An underused Cliff Curtis is a Shifter. There are also Stitches, Shadows, Wipers, and Bleeders, but alas, no Writers or Filmmakers to speak of. Director Paul McGuigan sends his camera flying in every possible direction, slowing occasionally to stare at Fanning's bare legs, scantly covered by combat boots and a micro-mini (her character's repeated instance that she looks 14 sounds distressingly defensive). Camerawork can't give rhythm to a narrative. Only a storyteller can. But the filmmakers don't seem to know what story they're telling. "Push" feels made up on the spot - and not in a spontaneous manner, but derivatively and self-consciously.
At the very least, a movie like this requires coherence to stay afloat. Barring that, it needs a star to distract us. The original "Superman" had Gene Hackman. "X-Men" had Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman. "Iron Man" had Robert Downey Jr. Here Djimon Hounsou, as a stylish supervillain, wears a suit and sunglasses and lets the special effects department dilate his pupils. But he was more alive playing a Mr. Miyagi type in last year's martial-arts workout "Never Back Down."
Not even the usually charismatic Evans, who had fun as the Human Torch in two forgettable "Fantastic Four" movies, can stop himself from sleepwalking through "Push." He seems bored with his powers. I can't blame him. As a secondhand psychic, I was thoroughly bored with mine.


Hardworking little Miss Fanning plays a Watcher  someone who can see the future  in Push , a weightless, style-driven thriller set in a photogenically chaotic Hong Kong. There, in neon shadows, some folks born with telekinetic powers face off against shady government types who want to harness those powers to build an army of, I don't know, psychic spoon benders. Evans' skill as a Mover means he can hurl stuff through the power of thought. But the most woo-hoo-mind-blowing of all is Camilla Belle as a Pusher who can plant ideas in a subject's head. The idea I'm getting is that I'd prefer Wolverine and Storm to do the hurling and mind-blowing in X-Men .

 At a time when most of our high schoolers struggle to make change without electronic help, the proliferation of movie and television characters with special abilities is more than a little utopian. In “Push,” these abilities are rooted in Nazi experiments to transform people into biological weapons, and the movie is crawling with clairvoyants, mind controllers and human bloodhounds. As far as I can tell, the only ability in short supply is acting.  Cued by the title, the plot can be described thus: Run. Hide. Fight. Repeat. Navigating a Hong Kong bristling with partially constructed skyscrapers, a small band of good guys led by a telekinetic (Chris Evans) and a clairvoyant (Dakota Fanning) hunt for a mysterious suitcase.  On their trail is a nebulous government agency known as the Division (in the form of a dapper Djimon Hounsou), as well as a Chinese gang fronted by two brothers whose screams can pop blood vessels. They’d have a hard time finding any in Kira (the insufferably bland Camilla Belle), a pallid waif whose allegiances are not clear.  Imaginatively filmed by Peter Sova, “Push” has a dizzying, chaotic energy that pulls you along. Paul McGuigan directs with maximum efficiency and minimum use of computers, creating effects that feel satisfyingly tangible. Trust me: when those Chinese brothers scream, more than your ears will be bleeding.  “Push” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Dakota Fanning gets sloshed, and everyone else gets bashed, bloodied or badly bruised.

Not to be mistaken for the acclaimed Mo'Nique  Sundance drama, director Paul McGuigan 's harebrained sci-fi thriller about young Americans with extraordinary psychic powers banding together in Hong Kong seems to have been made up as it was being filmed. It's less X-Men  and more "Why, man?" Hero #1 Chris Evans  is a second-generation mover with telekinetic abilities; government baddie and "pusher" Djimon Hounsou  plants treacherous ideas in other people's minds; a smugly precocious Dakota Fanning  sketches pictures of the future as a "watcher"; and the rest sound like the drug nicknames that Hunter S. Thompson  came up with in his Las Vegas  suitcase: "stitches," "shadows," "bleeders," "shifts," "sniffs," and "wipers." All that the super-skills offer are ridiculous screenwriting shortcuts (Evans hands out instruction cards to his posse, then has his mind erased by a crusty Chinese local to thwart telepathic villains and literally change fate) for a puffed-up plot that would make less sense to explain than to watch. The CGI effects are serviceable, if that's your bag, but the action has no suspense, the setpieces are uninspired (besides all the neon, why are they even in Hong Kong?), and the half-baked, anti-climactic punchline had me expecting an announcement that Season One kicks off on Fox this fall.
