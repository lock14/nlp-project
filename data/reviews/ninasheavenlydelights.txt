There's more simmering on the backburner than scrumptious Indian food in "Nina's Heavenly Delights," a Glasgow-set quasi-fairy tale� incorporating a trio of cross-cultural romances (gay, lesbian, straight) en route to a televised curry competition. Stereotypes abound, dialogue is conventional and pace scattered. Still, resulting stew is pleasant. Local color-drenched Sept. 29 release in the U.K. is the kind of venture critics often dislike and audiences often enjoy. The food is hotter than the implied sex, but gay fests may still be tempted. 
Three years after Indo-Scottish Nina Shah (Shelley Conn) ditched fiance Sanjay (Raji James), she returns to Glasgow for her beloved father's funeral. Dad's curry palace may fall to rivals unless Nina excels in the "Best of the West" cooking finals. Nina and fellow chef Lisa (Laura Fraser) are soon using their tongues on more than recipes. Overt or covert, each member of ensemble cast craves something. "Forbidden" loves abound, right down to Nina's little sister's incongruous passion for Scottish Highland dance. Silly musical numbers, courtesy of Nina's flamboyant Bollywood-obsessed drag queen friend Bobbi (Ronny Jhutti), add to the good-natured ambiance of the non-threatening transgressions.

"A difficult choice, between perfection and heavenly delight," crows the announcer at an Indian-cooking contest during this movie's climax. Sadly, Pratibha Parmar 's Nina's Heavenly Delights  offers neither. What it does offer is an estranged daughter, a dead father, a disappointed mother, a secret marriage, a secret lesbian, and a secret Scottish country dancer. This overloaded plot begins with the homecoming of Nina (Shelley Conn ), a Glasgow  native of Indian descent, and follows her through the cooking contest she enters on behalf of her recently departed father, an accomplished chef. Oh wait: Her father may have departed from Nina, but he has not departed from the movie, and has an eerie tendency to make posthumous appearances (imagine the ghost of Julia Child  showing up in your bedroom). Dad's mantra was "Follow your heart," which might be why the writers sprinkle lines like "And what about my heart?" into their overly mushy script. Veena Sood  plays Nina's mother with magisterial presence. But Conn overacts just as much as the impetuous Nina overreacts. At least her foodsimmering sauces and flaky breadsis reputed to be subtle.
