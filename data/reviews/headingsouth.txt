 "I'm crazy about love — sex and love, I'm not really sure anymore," declares Ellen (Charlotte Rampling), the haughty, brutally forthright queen bee in the gaggle of sex tourists frolicking through Laurent Cantet's devastating film "Heading South."  "I always told myself that when I'm old I'd pay young men to love me," she continues in her best blasé manner. "I just didn't think it would happen so fast." A beautiful, unmarried 55-year-old teacher of French literature at Wellesley, Ellen has spent the last six summers vacationing at the Petite Anse, a seaside Haitian hotel frequented by poor black boys eager to provide sex to middle-age female guests who lavish them with money and gifts. Ellen, the resident philosopher among a group who picnic with their boyfriends on the beach, is a bossy know-it-all who is not quite as hard-boiled as she would like to imagine.  As "Heading South" narrows its focus to concentrate on Ellen; her favorite young lover, the handsome, sly 18-year-old Legba (Ménothy Cesar); and two of the women in her circle, it becomes one of the most truthful examinations ever filmed of desire, age and youth, and how easy it is to confuse erotic rapture with love.  "If you're over 40 and not as dumb as a fashion model, the only guys who are interested are natural born losers or husbands whose wives are cheating on them," Ellen tartly observes of the mating game as it applies to single women of a certain age.  But "Heading South" is much more than a dispassionate examination of middle-age desire. Adapted from three short stories by Dany Laferrière and set in the late 1970's, when Haiti was ruled by  Jean-Claude Duvalier (nicknamed Baby Doc) and a cadre of thugs, this politically pointed film contemplates the darker social undercurrents beneath a seemingly benign example of sexual tourism.  In a dirt-poor country where life is cheap, there is a local saying that those who grow too tall in Haiti are cut down; the exceptions, of course, are tourists.  Observing the tourism with profound distaste is the hotel's courtly, discreet headwaiter, Albert (Lys Ambroise). In a film constructed around four shattering monologues addressed to the camera, Albert's is the only Haitian voice to speak from the heart and what he says is chilling. Descended from a family of patriots who fought the Americans in the 1915 occupation, he harbors an implacable loathing of the white visitors. His grandfather, he says, believed "the white man was an animal." Albert adds,  "If he knew I was a waiter for Americans, he would die of shame." Today, he declares, whites wield an even more dangerous weapon than cannons —  their dollars: "Everything they touch turns to garbage."  How perilous life is for ordinary Haitians under Mr. Duvalier is suggested in the movie's opening scene, in which Albert, waiting to pick up a tourist at the airport, is approached by a Haitian woman who points to her beautiful 15-year-old daughter and pleads with him to take her because "being beautiful and poor in this country, she doesn't stand a chance; they won't think twice of killing me to grab her."  The other three characters who bare their souls are Ellen and two fellow sex tourists, Brenda (Karen Young) and Sue (Louise Portal). Brenda, 48, is a high-strung, Valium-popping woman from Savannah, Ga.; she is returning to the resort three years after she visited with her now-ex-husband and had sex with the 15-year-old Legba, who gave her her first orgasm. She has been obsessed with him ever since. Sue, a levelheaded, good-hearted French Canadian who runs a warehouse in Montreal, has a Haitian boyfriend she adores, but she knows full well that in any other place the relationship would be laughable.  With a screenplay in French, English and a smattering of Creole by Mr. Cantet and Robin Campillo, "Heading South" is a beautifully written, seamlessly directed film with award-worthy performances by Ms. Rampling and Ms. Young. As Ellen and Brenda compete for Legba's love, both imagine that they play a larger role in his life than they actually do. The little we see of Legba away from the resort suggests a complicated past. When a gunman goes after him, the women imagine they are the immediate cause of his troubles. They are, but only to the extent that Legba conspicuously stands out in the flashy clothes Brenda buys him. As much as Ellen and Brenda think they understand him and the state of fear that grips Haiti, they are ultimately clueless.  At first glance, "Heading South" seems to be a departure for the director of "Human Resources" and "Time Out," two of the more critically acclaimed French films in recent years. But it continues Mr. Cantet's incisive examination of money and class in modern society. In "Human Resources," a French blue-collar family is torn apart when the son of an assembly-line worker joins the same company's white-collar management team, and father and son find themselves on opposite sides of a picket line.  The desperate protagonist of "Time Out" loses the high-paying job on which his self-esteem depends and convinces his family he has landed even better work, while drifting around in his car and living on money borrowed from friends that he pretends to invest. In "Heading South," money also rules. The romantic spell that Legba exerts over Ellen and Brenda is bought and paid for.  Mr. Cantet's film is too sophisticated to demonize these women, whose relationships with their young lovers are more tender and nourishing than overtly crass. For all its political acuity, this great film recognizes and respects the complexity of its memorable, fully realized characters.

Laurent Cantet's anticipated follow-up to "Time Out" supplants that pic's important issues with unexamined attitudes toward sex and the tropics. The trio of women in "Heading South" luxuriate in the sexual pleasures of a Haitian beach resort, and while Cantet puts enough uncomfortable words in their mouths to signal their problematic viewpoint, he fails to give their plaything his own voice. Helmer's rep will ensure a brisk fest existence, but life on the outside will largely rest on Francophone screens.
Three years after her first trip to Haiti, Brenda (Karen Young) returns to the beach resort where she had a fling with a 15-year-old boy named Legba. Now a confident, beautiful young man, Legba (Menothy Cesar) is the star attraction for the sexually frustrated middle-aged women who fly down to the island in search of erotic pleasure.
Doyenne of the establishment is Ellen (Charlotte Rampling), a 55-year-old Wellesley professor who spent the last six summers reveling in the hotel's liberating atmosphere, where smooth-skinned, half-naked black men cater to her desires. Legba is her favorite, and she's not about to let anyone else take the number one position by his side.
But Brenda expressly returned to Haiti to see the boy who gave her her first orgasm at 45, and the two women eye each other warily. Less threatening is Sue (Louise Portal, "The Barbarian Invasions"), a Canadian with her own beach boy.
While it's certainly true the resort allows the young men to temporarily escape the political and economic misery of the country, Cantet's disingenuous remark that he wants to shift the discourse from "sex tourism" to "love tourism" fails to convince.
Ellen passionately implores Legba to come away with her, but in reality she would never present him to her Wellesley set. At least Maxine in "The Night of the Iguana" is aware of her erotic needs but doesn't hold on to the hypocrisy and prejudice these women unthinkingly maintain.
What remains is a group of women on their summer holiday, dissatisfied and embittered by the men back home, exploiting Third World young men.
Perhaps the description sounds more crass than Cantet serves up in his well-crafted work. He punctuates the story with four monologues, the three women plus Albert (Lys Ambroise), the hotel maitre d' and the only black man allowed a voice of his own.
Albert's bitterness deserved further development, but the real puzzle is why Cantet doesn't let Legba have a say.
Cantet as usual elicits top performances from his cast, although a more limited feel for the flow of English conversation occasionally deadens dialogue and monologue. Rampling, one of the joys of cinema in the past five years, is the ideal actress to convey Ellen's blend of liberated carnality, Bostonian snobbery and racism, plus a deep vulnerability. Newcomer Cesar appears able but his dramatic moments are too infrequent.
Although set in the late 1970s, pic doesn't try to push a period flavor. Lensing and tone are similar to Cantet's earlier work, and together with regular d.p. Pierre Milon and editor Robin Campillo (also co-scripter), he allows events to gradually unfold in a stripped-down way that never calls attention to itself.

Laurent Cantet 's previous features, Human Resources  and Time Out , are the work of a filmmaker drawn to workaday political scenarios; Heading South , his evocation of pre-AIDS, old-school sex tourism, begins with a poignant evocation of ordinary terror. A middle-class woman, desperate to protect her nubile daughter, approaches a dignified professional with hopes of selling him the girl: Haiti , 1979.
Albert (Lys Ambroise ) declines; as upper-class as he appears, he's also a servant, waiting at the Port-au-Prince  airport to pick up Brenda (Karen Young ), a newly single white American in her late '40s. The modest resort where Albert is employed as maître d' is an erotic utopia for such women. Ellen (Charlotte Rampling ), a Wellesley  professor and queen of the beach, welcomes Brenda to "paradise" with the forthright assurance that "you're going to have a ball."
Cantet takes a more sentimental view of sex tourism than Michel Houellebecq , whose novel Platform  was published a few years before Heading South went into production. Still, despite its progressive interest in what Cantet terms the "desire of women," Heading South  cannot but illustrate Houellebecq's notion of sex tourism as a function of the globalized economy. Albert's disapproval notwithstanding, the little resort is a safe zone allowing its female guests to openly pair off with youthful locals. The main drama inside this bubble is the war Brenda wages against Ellen for the favors of the beautiful Legba (Ménothy Cesar). Outside the bubble . . . it's a tropical terror state.
An intelligent movie, not so much salacious as affecting but ultimately less analytical than overwrought, Heading South makes its points in the first 20 minutes. Cantet may not name the dictator Baby Doc nor his dread enforcers, the Tonton Macoutes, but he's hardly subtle in mapping Haiti's social hierarchy or his characters' psychologies. Periodically, several principalsincluding Brenda, Ellen, and Albertshare their thoughts with the camera. Legba is given no such moment, although he has several crucial scenes in the context of his other life, but this is Cantet's realism. If the object of desire is conspicuously without a subjective voice it may be because in this ruthless paradise his body is his only capital and his life is worth nothing.
