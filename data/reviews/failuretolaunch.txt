In naming their project, the filmmakers have tempted reviewers with a golden opportunity to unleash our cattiest puns (we love that), but this date movie is better than it has to be. The cast is quite good, although I regret to inform there�s a sight gag involving Bradshaw almost full frontal while feeding fish in a tank, and that�s inexcusable. Screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember have backgrounds in television, and the script is sitcom patter (�Deceptions are poisonous! Like margarine!�) with relentless alternation of swoony moments and quirky moments (because he defies the natural order by living with his parents at age 35, McConaughey is bitten frequently by animals). The film is dude-friendly by design, and while this approach invites cynicism (McConaughey gets two dudely chums in Bartha and Cooper, and we frequently cut to them mountain biking or playing paintball � as if a scientific formula ensures a balance of appeal for both genders), it�s actually quite a good idea for a light comedy about love and family relationships to be located more deliberately in the world of men. The movie doesn�t make cruel sport of adult children living at home; the characters are shaded, and the consummately professional Bates, as McConaughey�s mother, has a lovely and graceful moment of acknowledging her fears about marriage after retirement. That the movie takes her seriously proves it has heart, but its heroine is from hell. Paula (Parker) meets cute with the impossibly named Tripp (McConaughey) in a furniture store, but really she�s a ringer hired by Tripp�s parents (Bates and Bradshaw) to persuade Tripp to move out of their house. (That�s the premise, and in the worst romantic-comedy tradition, we�re expected to swallow that logic instead of quite reasonably expecting the parents to address their son directly. But since the audience is ostensibly all on a date, surely we won�t notice.) It�s rather an ugly setup, but we�re supposed to like Paula because she�s a �professional interventionist� and has a positive �Initial Personality Assessment� of Tripp. In reality Paula is a kind of nightmare woman from within the deepest fear center of the dude brain: massive dating agenda, manufactured drama, mercenary stake, really into her hair, buys special shoes for boating. This is a woman who fakes a dog�s death in order to keep you in line. Ostensibly Parker has the comedic heft to make such a tightly wound train wreck into a likable romantic heroine (say what you will about her, but Meg Ryan could do it), but the movie doesn�t really show this to us. The movie shows us a lot of Parker�s hair and her cute outfits. There�s no spark in the romance because people in romantic comedies are simply not allowed to be people anymore: they�re hair and outfits inside a premise. For this we will not blame the actors, who are all committed to what the movie asks of them. But the movie doesn�t ask enough of them. That�s why Deschanel, as the token oddball of the gang, runs off with the movie. It�s light and portable.


There are a lot of ways for a man to scare off an interested woman. One might be to say, "Babe, this isn't working for me." Another is to stop calling her. Meaner, I'll admit, but it works. Tripp, the tanned Casanova Matthew McConaughey plays in "Failure to Launch," tries another tack. When things get too close with a potential girlfriend, he takes her home to meet his parents.
Lest you get carried away by the promise of romance in that gesture: Tripp's parents are also his roommates.
Still, the hilarity in this sunny movie comes from a twist in the plot that occurs not long after he meets Paula, a more-than-meets-the-eye "special needs" consultant whom Sarah Jessica Parker plays with superhuman breeziness. She and Tripp have a lovely meeting in a Maryland furniture store, where they recline in Barcaloungers and make a date for dinner.
For about six years, Tripp's mother, Sue (Kathy Bates), has been cooking his meals, washing and folding his laundry, making his bed, and tossing him a snack on his way out to his job as a boat salesman. She even vacuums the sinfully upscale bachelor pad that is his only-in-the-movies bedroom. Written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Tom Dey, the movie makes sure we know early on that Sue and her husband, Al (Terry Bradshaw), are tired of pampering their 35-year-old son. At a cookout, they discover how some friends recently got rid of their kid. They hired Paula.
Time magazine covers, entire swaths of Newsweek, and half a dozen morning-news segments have covered men like Tripp to death. Time even popularized the term "twixters" to describe them, a word so stupid that it should have inspired adult moochers to leave mom and dad's as a matter of embarrassment, killing the trend. Sue and Al's determination to drive Tripp from their home and Paula's arrival enliven this TV setup.
"Failure to Launch" is an actual situation comedy that's cleverly post-sitcom. The television show would have been all about a dude who moves in with his parents. Period. The movie holds on to the parents, the dude, and his buddies, a nature-boy slacker (Bradley Cooper) and a lovable techie (Justin Bartha), neither of whom have anything in common with Tripp except that they live with their folks, too. But the movie is surprisingly nimble and emotionally honest, with particular respect to Sue, who's ambivalent about wanting Tripp to leave for touching reasons.
The movie brings to mind the more polite parts of "Wedding Crashers." "Failure to Launch," while totally exuberant and appealingly made, is not nearly as randy. The camera does find it impossible, though, to resist gaping at McConaughey's bare chest or open shirts. The man is sure to come back as a muscled-up, well-oiled peacock in his next life. (Incidentally -- and ill advisedly -- wildlife is employed to attack Tripp out of his comfy living arrangement. Please don't ask.)
In any case, the film is also surprisingly well cast. Who knew, for instance, that Terry Bradshaw could be as goofy and affectionate with Kathy Bates as he is with James Brown and Howie Long on "Fox NFL Sunday"? The wonderfully dour Zooey Deschanel has no business playing Parker's best pal and housemate, Kit. (How are these two friends, exactly?) But it doesn't matter; she bends the 
implausibility to her deadpan will, making the most of a belabored plotline involving a mockingbird that needs killing.
If there's a real problem with "Failure to Launch," it's Paula's job, which at moments forces her into situations that play a lot like prostitution. But Parker glides through them like, well, a professional. Romantic comedies are better with her in them. "Sex and the City" has prepared her for any type of man and every brand of romantic contrivance. She's snappy, smart, and, on this occasion, luminous, too. For a McConaughey movie, this is unusual; she's the rare actor not upstaged by the numerous shots of his cleavage.
.


         Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker look and act, quite attractively, like grown-ups, and their easy rapport makes them convincing and appealing as an on-screen couple. So all throughout "Failure to Launch," I found myself wishing they were in a different movie, maybe one as sophisticated as "The Philadelphia Story," which the movie references, but doesn't remotely live up to.
 
  The premise requires that we accept the rakish McConaughey as a luxury boat salesman who still lives with his parents, played by an underused Kathy Bates, looking as if she's not quite sure what she's doing in the movie, and NFL commentator Terry Bradshaw. It might have worked had Tripp, McConaughey's character, been drawn as a lazy charmer, with no compunction about mooching off his parents for the rest of his life. Instead, this being paint-by-numbers romantic comedy, he is given a back story with a big, sympathy-grabbing explanation embedded in its chewy center.
 


         






    Parker plays Paula, a "transition consultant" hired by Tripp's parents to lure him out of the nest. Having pinpointed the problem — which in the world of the movie, is epidemic — to lack of self-esteem, Paula has developed a technique whereby she coaxes the apron-bound thirtysomethings into bonding with her and moving on. (She pulls it off without sex, the minx, and nobody seems to mind.) What happens when the newly bonded former mama's boys find themselves ignominiously dumped after the job is over is never addressed. Like Tripp, she is given a rudimentary single-issue back story, and otherwise left to fend for herself. More than a character, she's a stand-in for the soon-to-be upended status quo: Business is smooth sailing until Paula gets Tripped.
 
  I suppose that once a character as thin as this has made it all the way to the screen, it's pointless to call attention to the other areas in which she rings hollow. But what can you do? Paula shares a large suburban house with a roommate, Kit (Zooey Deschanel), who looks and acts 15 years her junior. Although this comes as no surprise — Deschanel is, after all, 15 years Parker's junior — it raises questions the movie doesn't really intend to raise: Namely, why are these two friends, and why are they living together? Deschanel is charming and quirky as the sullen twentysomething, but she's given nothing to do other than obsess over a mockingbird that's driving her crazy. She eventually falls for Ace (Justin Bartha), one of Tripp's best friends who, like their other friend Demo (Bradley Cooper), still lives at home as well. (As with Deschanel and Parker, the boys are far too young to appear credibly as McConaughey's friends and peers.)
 
  Had it been at all developed, Deschanel's character might have warranted a movie of her own. Not that it seems likely we'll see a comedy centered around a surly 25-year-old girl anytime soon. The studios' attitude toward women, young ones in particular, is unstintingly grim. But "Failure to Launch" is a good example of the industry's low regard for young men too. As if to compensate for the love story, the movie is peppered with teen-movie comedy cribbed from films like "There's Something About Mary."
 
  This seems to be a trend in comedies — movies with premises that promise comedic insight into the way we live now, and then assiduously avoid mining their interesting, culturally specific and infinitely humor-rich subjects. Rather than take an organic and timely premise — the phenomenon of youngish adults returning home in their 20s and 30s — the movie casts around wildly for comic set-pieces, coming up with things like aggressive chipmunks, hostile dolphins and a dad who longs to be naked at all times. It's not exactly that the audience's intelligence is underestimated, it's that their relevance is.
 
  You don't have to be smart, after all, to connect to a comedy about a guy who has messed up his short foray into adulthood to the point that he has to revert to childhood; or to root for the girl who loves him against her better judgment. But when it comes to romantic comedies, studios seem inexplicably hamstrung by a host of conflicting received notions and biases that they combine and recombine to similarly unsuccessful effect in movie after movie.
 
  It's enough to make you think that Hollywood is run by the world's last and most dedicated but least inspired alchemists, sealed off in primitive laboratories, doggedly trying to turn lead into gold.
 
 'Failure to Launch'
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for sexual content, partial nudity and language.   

I can't count how many times since Christmas I have been informed of the imminent arrival of Failure to Launch , by movie trailers and TV spots as well as by eye-catching full-page newspaper and magazine ads that feature a breezy Sarah Jessica Parker propping up a loungey Matthew McConaughey. But I can report that the massive buildup for the star-driven romantic comedy with the title that sounds alternately dirty (launch, heh-heh) and prophetic (failure, ooh-ooh) has had a déjà vu effect. When, early in the exposition, the domestically delayed hero, Tripp (McConaughey), beds a woman whose crime it is to seek commitment and the two are interrupted by the appearance of Tripp's father (Terry Bradshaw), I knew exactly when the Anonymous Blonde would squeal, ''You live with your parents?!'' I knew when Tripp would boast that ''it's gonna take a stick of dynamite'' to blast him out of the nest (a comfy, well-decorated nest at that). And I knew that Paula (Parker), the woman hired by Tripp's parents to lure their son into the benefits of independent living, would toss off many charming gestures of SarahJessicaParkerdom as she first works the guy, then falls for him.
Failure to Launch  arrives pre-told by design. But even those coming in cold will know what's going to happen one step ahead, because the movie has been constructed from a dull calculus based on commodities exchange (Star X + Star Y = Project Z) rather than a freewheeling script based on wit. The work is a computation, if you like, of If You Likes.
If, for example, you like McConaughey's affect of sexy, sleepy-eyed drawl  is he toasted, or just a sun-kissed Texan?  then you are meant to like Tripp, even though screenwriters Tom J. Astle and sitcom-savvy Matt Ember abandon all hope of squaring the childish, spoiled-by-Mom slacker that Tripp appears to be pre-Paula with the far more competent, complicated, and sensitive thirtysomething adult he proves himself to be later on. This character is a bundle of What-If-We-Made-Hims who dribbles away his leisure with similarly unattached goofball pals, yet also takes seriously his responsibilities to a jaunty African-American boy he calls his nephew. And little black kids don't appear for nothing in a white creampuff comedy like this.
If, on the other hand, you like the energy, wisecracks, fashion sense, giggles, hair fiddling, and little yips of joy with which SJP has come to define stylish urban pizzazz since Sex and the City , you're meant to like Paula, an illegible character wholly dependent on Parker's chic gal-pal persona. Paula's niche business, marketed to affluent parents who wish their grown sons would fly the coop, involves stimulating separation by simulating a relationship worth leaving home for. (To be sure, the job is more geisha than ho, since sex doesn't come with the deal.) But who she is when she's not on the job is a cipher; we only know that Paula shares a pad with Kit, a cute-loopy weirdo who, in the tradition of eccentric romantic-comedy roommates in the person of irresistible comedienne Zooey Deschanel, sashays away with the picture every time director Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon ) gives her a chance. If you like oddball sidekick subplots, you're bound to like this diversion. (There's a whole other romantic comedy waiting to make a break for it in Kit's brief bull's-eye encounter with a gun salesman played by The Daily Show 's Rob Corddry.)
By the way, if you like Kathy Bates movies, you'll probably be frustrated with this one, since as Tripp's mother, the invaluable character actress is made to whipsaw between playing sappy domestic slave to her son's laundry and salty, overly sexual wife. And so, pasted into the story without logic to guide her, she does whatever the heck she pleases. The two prize headliners, meanwhile, gleam side by side, well matched in celebrity and toiling at lightness, pretending their characters could ever share a lifestyle. (McConaughey's unshaven Tripp looks forever poised to play in the dirt, while Parker's Paula isn't truly happy unless striding in heels.)
There is, no doubt, a great screwball comedy to be made about adult children who won't leave home, and the mothers and fathers who collude in the arrangement  and not just for reasons of economics. Alternately, how about a real generational conflict? Failure to Launch  fails to go anywhere near the subject, either in jest or in earnest, shortchanging Tripp's mom and pop as weaklings afraid to even bring up the subject with their overgrown boy. They are, however, so comically desperate to usher the big lug out the door that they hire a babe to deprogram him from the cult of Catering to Sonny Boy. Mission aborted.

 Fans of reality television who consume the dryly amusing, fatally titled romantic comedy, "Failure to Launch," can be excused from worrying that they have suddenly developed double vision. The movie's hunky, pathologically lying heartthrob, Tripp, played by Matthew McConaughey with a smirk and a swagger, is almost a dead ringer for Travis Stork, the honey-dripping Prince Charming of "The Bachelor: Paris."  Tripp and Travis are both experts at pouring on the sweet talk, using their blinding smiles to camouflage their coldblooded scrutiny. Both have rub-a-dub washboard abs ready for the hand laundering of their girlfriends' delicate undergarments.  The world of "Failure to Launch," of course, is not the real world but the romantic comedy planet, which means the movie has only the most tenuous connection with reality. But the same could be said of classic 30's screwball comedies in which the treacherous feints and ploys of the mating game are transmuted into witty, romantically charged repartee.  A self-described "boat broker" who wines and dines potential conquests on other people's yachts while they're away, Tripp has a good thing going. At 35, he still lives contentedly with his parents, Sue (Kathy Bates) and Al (Terry Bradshaw), in their stately home in suburban New Orleans. Each morning, Mom plies Tripp with a stack of pancakes, then sends him off to sell boats, toting the lunch she has carefully packed for him. She is the best and cheapest full-time housekeeper a boy could ask for.  Video: Movie Minutes Stephen Holden reviews the romantic comedy "Failure to Launch," starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Tripp and his buddies, Ace (Justin Bartha), a computer geek, and Demo (Bradley Cooper), a nomadic Peter Pan, who also still live at home, enjoy sitting around and crowing about the advantages of never having to grow up. For Tripp, the best part of the arrangement is that it affords him the perfect exit strategy from a relationship once a girl flashes him "the look," a signal that's she's smitten. Then it's time to drag the soon-to-be-ex to the house, where she is appalled to discover his living situation and runs for the hills.  But Tripp's freeloading days may be coming to an end. Sue and Al have run out of patience  with their overgrown baby. Desperate that he move out and live on his own, they hire a specialist in prying spoiled bachelors from the womb. With the introduction of Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker) into his life, Tripp meets his match in heartless seduction and manipulation.  The infinitely self-assured Paula has refined her method into a diabolical game plan that includes feigning fascination with a man's hobbies (Tripp's passion is sailing), then creating a bogus crisis in which she tearfully clings to him for emotional support. In Tripp's case, it involves enlisting a veterinarian in faking the death of a beloved dog. Paula's professional rulebook allows for kissing but no sex.  The movie pauses long enough to show Paula working her demonic wiles on a blubbery nerd who lives in a "Star Wars" fantasy world. The poor chump is a goner. But Tripp, because he's handsome, lean and suave, presents a more formidable challenge.  There is no doubt Tripp deserves everything he gets. Lying through his whitened teeth, he boasts of his amazing (nonexistent) sex with Paula. Explaining his minor injuries after being bitten successively by a chipmunk, a lizard, and a dolphin, they become the battle scars acquired in his supposedly "Moby-Dick"-size encounters with nature.  The director Tom Dey obviously cherishes 30's comedies, and he confidently guides a screenplay (by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember) that has some of the sass and bite of those oldies through the screwball rapids. It's all about tone. And until the movie succumbs to sugar shock at the end, it remains brisk and tart. Mr. McConaughey and Ms. Parker (in a role not far removed from Carrie Bradshaw) make well-matched sparring partners.  True to screwball tradition, the subsidiary characters flesh out the comedy. The funniest is Paula's sarcastic roommate, Kit (Zooey Deschanel), who shoots off deadpan one-liners with the aplomb of a curvaceous young Eve Arden. Kit has a thing about birds that chatter all night and keep her awake. And in the movie's best scene, she enlists Ace to shoot an offending mockingbird, and then, overcome with guilt over its possible demise, has him administer mouth-to-beak artificial respiration.  "Failure to Launch" (the colorless title seems more appropriate to a fizzled liftoff at Cape Canaveral)  has its ick factor in the pesky presence of an adorable gap-toothed moppet who accompanies Tripp to sports events. That relationship is explained in a strained back story tacked on to make Tripp more sympathetic. But that's how it goes these days on the romantic comedy planet. An abundance of ice cream is necessary to blot out the taste of spinach.  The movie is rated PG-13. It has strong language with sexual innuendo.

Although not nearly as bad as its title, "Failure to Launch" is an especially slight romantic comedy whose modest charms are derived largely from its supporting players. Conspicuously inspired by magazine articles about a trendy, "Oprah"-worthy syndrome -- adult children unwilling to leave their parents' homes -- the filmmakers pad the movie's allotted time with over-the-top interludes in pursuit of a screwball tone. Blessed with some crowd-pleasing elements, "Launch" should enjoy modest appeal among the weekend-date crowd but, to borrow its terminology, it doesn't seem destined to fully achieve liftoff.
This is actually the second time Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker have done the "meet cute" thing, the other coming when he guest starred as himself (not all that convincingly) on "Sex and the City." It's too bad, however, that their characters aren't as well buffed and polished as the stars' deservedly celebrated physiques.
Despite that athletic frame and chiseled jaw, fun-loving Tripp (McConaughey) is a 35-year-old man still living with his mom (Kathy Bates) and dad (Terry Bradshaw). In fact, his designated method of breaking up with the sundry babes he bags is to bring them home as soon as they exhibit the first sign of becoming too attached.
More improbably, Tripp's best buddies, tech geek Ace (Justin Bartha) and world traveler Demo (Bradley Cooper), are also live-at-home examples of this Peter Pan syndrome. Even so, they tell Tripp that he's "afraid of love," a charge he rejects, insisting that his prolonged adolescence is just swell.
Tripp's parents don't appear particularly upset with the arrangement, but, after chatting with some blissful neighbors enjoying a newly emptied nest, they retain Paula (Parker), a "professional interventionist" who promises she can seduce men suffering from "failure to launch," thus inspiring them to move out on their own.
As Paula soon realizes, however, Tripp is an atypical case, and not just because he and his friends all have weird names. The two share an obvious attraction, muddling her carefully orchestrated routine, which is built around not becoming too involved. (A moment when we see her with a more conventional "client" -- enthusing about the "Star Wars" trilogy -- hints at a different and perhaps better movie, though there's still the untidy little matter of dumping these losers after romancing them to independence.)
Director Tom Dey ("Shanghai Noon") and TV writing veterans Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember alternate between more down-to-Earth scenes and cartoonish ones. On that latter score, Tripp keeps having oddly dangerous encounters with animatronic animals, leading to broad slapstick sequences that are incongruous with the rest of the film.
Granted, there is a belated if somewhat feeble attempt to explain why animals keep attacking Tripp, along with why Tripp's still at home and how Paula stumbled into this bizarre line of work. But, none of it is any more convincing than Tripp's absurdly precocious nephew, who comes across as sitcom silly.
Parker isn't far from her "Sex" persona and fares a bit better than McConaughey, whose comic chops are less developed than his abs.
Pic's saving graces and few genuine laughs, meanwhile, flow from the goofy antics of Bates and Bradshaw, with the old quarterback even baring his backfield for the team. Zooey Deschanel also brings some quirkiness to her role as Paula's misanthropic roommate, though the two are such unlikely friends it feels as if Deschanel parachuted in from an entirely different movie.
Shot in locales that include Maryland, New Orleans and Alabama, "Failure to Launch" ultimately shares something in common with its protagonist that doesn't bode well for its theatrical run: While both Tripp and the movie are attractive and far from a total failure, neither offers much motivation to leave the house.

At long last, Matthew McConaughey  has chosen the perfect vehicle in which to highlight his slacker radiance: He plays the aptly named Tripp, a 35-year-old yacht salesman who still lives with his mommy (Kathy Bates ) and daddy (Terry Bradshaw ). Tripp uses the folks to break up with girls he feels are getting too attached: He brings them home for a night of foolin' around, then waits for Dad to barge in before springing the news he still lives at home. Works every time, at least until he brings home Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker ), who doesn't blanch at the news. But that's only because Tripp's folks have hired her to lure their boy out of the nest; she's a paid girlfriend . . . fine, a whore . Failure to Launch  has all the gravitas of a midseason-replacement sitcom. But beneath the sitcom sheen, there's a darker movie about broken people who use convenient, pitiful excuses to keep from growing up. You laugh at them, but you also have sympathy.
