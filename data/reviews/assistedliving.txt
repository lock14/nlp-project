Todd (Michael Bonsignore), the slack-jawed cipher at the center of Assisted Living , is an orderly at a nursing home, where he fights his boredom by smoking dope and rolling around in a wheelchair. How the audience will relieve its boredom is another story. The writer-director, Elliot Greenebaum, had the bright idea to shoot a comedy about old people at an actual assisted-living residence in Kentucky, so that he could paint wizened seniors into the background as unknowing human props. Parts of the film play like the world's slowest and most insensitive reality show (Who Wants to Be an Octogenarian? ). The majority of it, however, is done with actors. When a sweet old lady (Maggie Riley) in the early stages of Alzheimer's gets a call from Todd, who toys with her by pretending to be her son, it's hard to say what, exactly, the filmmaker is going for, but it's a safe bet that he hasn't nailed it.

s nursing homes go, Meadow View, the site of Elliot Greenebaum's hardheaded comedy "Assisted Living," is a far cry from the places we sometimes read about where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners. The rooms are clean, the staff is efficient, and the lounge has a giant television. The residents, many in  wheelchairs, are led through stretching exercises or sit in a circle and toss around a beach ball. The staff is extremely protective, insisting that special sun-protecting goggles be worn for excursions outdoors to the lawn. What little excitement  can be stirred up revolves around games of bingo. There is a beloved house pet, a golden retriever named Randy, and there is also entertainment. In one scene, a singer serenades a group with "On the Sunny Side of the Street" and "Blue Skies." But all this strenuous perkiness doesn't make for a joyful environment. The faces of the residents remain frozen. Conversations tend to be bickering matches in which two people claw at each other to command the television's remote control. Most  remarks addressed to staff members are peevish complaints. And the glad-handing chief administrator, Hance Purcell, is a secret tippler who carries on an ominous domestic battle over his office telephone. Life in Meadow View is viewed through the eyes of Todd (Michael Bonsignore), the institution's scruffy 27-year-old janitor, who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot, is careless about punctuality and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom. In the most outrageous stunt, he telephones a patient from an adjoining room and pretends to be a deceased loved one describing the wonders of heaven. One delight of the hereafter, he promises, is all the sex you want without the inconvenience of a body. "Assisted Living," which opens today at the Angelika Film Center in New York, has the guardedly facetious tone of a fake documentary, filmed at a nursing home in Kentucky and incorporating many of the actual residents. It is not always easy to tell the difference between the actors and nonactors. The wisp of a plot follows Todd's relationship with Mrs. Pearlman (Maggie Riley), a patient suffering from early Alzheimer's who is obsessed with leaving Meadow View to join her son in Australia. The old woman, who wears a white wide-brimmed hat, still carries herself with a certain dignity, studies her image in a mirror and is sentient enough to deny she has Alzheimer's, which she calls "it," refusing to say the dreaded word. When Todd calls her, pretending to be her son, her happiness quickly turns to agitation, and she has an emotional meltdown. Thereafter, she begins to confuse the two men. If Ms. Riley's portrayal of a patient who is hanging on, despite having lost much of her grip, is the movie's emotional center, it is a thoroughly unsentimental performance. This dry little film steers clear of rose-colored Hollywood clich�s, in which adorable old folks dispense nuggets of homey wisdom to their confused great-grandchildren. "Assisted Living" may be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling. As the camera fixates on frail, spotted trembling hands unsteadily reaching out, it is impossible not to imagine a future in which those hands could be yours.

The winner of the narrative jury prize at the Slamdance Film Festival, Elliot Greenebaum's "Assisted Living" is an affecting low-key drama set and shot in a functioning nursing home. Recalling David Gordon Green's "George Washington" in its minimalist approach, use of nonprofessionals and disposition toward long, meditative scenes, pic is a bit too taken with lackadaisical pacing, feeling much longer than its brief running time. Still, this is a noteworthy piece on a difficult subject -- society's complex relationship with the elderly and infirm -- that will connect with audiences tired of Hollywood's sentimental portrayals of growing old. With strong critical and distrib backing, pic could perform modestly well in specialized release, though its highly intimate sensibility may translate even better to the small screen.
"Assisted Living" will also draw inevitable comparison to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," except that in this case, the spirited nonconformist with the devil-may-care sensibility isn't one of the patients, but one of the staff -- a pot-smoking slacker nurse named Todd (Michael Bonsignore), who constantly shows up to work late, takes patients on unauthorized outings and, when he's really bored, makes prank phone calls to patients in which he pretends to be a dearly departed relative calling from heaven.
When Todd is charged with looking after longtime resident Mrs. Pearlman (Maggie Riley), he finds himself falling into an odd, mother-son role-playing game, in which the woman, who has Alzheimer's, increasingly mistakes Todd for her own son, supposedly coming to visit her soon from his home in Australia. Despite efforts to remain emotionally distanced from Mrs. Pearlman -- just as his supervisors instruct him to -- Todd finds himself an ever-more willing participant in these delusional episodes.
Greenebaum's film is unafraid to show age and deterioration in ways you rarely see in American movies; it lingers lovingly on wrinkles, gray hairs, liver spots and gnarled, arthritic hands, finding a strange kind of beauty therein. Its European sensibility recalls that of Jean-Pierre Ameris' superb 2001 nursing-home drama, "C'est La Vie." Likewise, there's little conventional about the way the relationship between Todd and Mrs. Pearlman plays out. Initially, Todd is drawn to this woman as much out of curiosity as compassion, and rather than manufacturing maudlin effects, Greenebaum uses the two characters as archetypes, juxtaposing the energy of youth against the sedation of old age, with no middle ground.
Greenebaum's tableau-like direction, while refreshingly unflashy, leads to scenes that drone on well past having made their point.
What gives "Assisted Living" its unexpected weight is the spectacular turn by Riley, a former circus performer. From an early scene in which her character stares longingly into a make-up mirror, as though if she looks long enough she might see her youthful visage, Riley's depth of understanding for the role brings the pic much-needed emotional resonance. In her hands, Mrs. Pearlman isn't some cartoonish, Hollywood caricature of a proud old lady, but rather a sad, dignified woman who realizes her mind and body are betraying her and wants to make the most of the time she has left (and not, thankfully, "making the most" of it on some impromptu road-trip or other improbable only-in-the-movies adventure).
In keeping with pic's overall aesthetic, tech contributions are assured but subdued.
