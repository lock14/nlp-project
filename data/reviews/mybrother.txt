         "A weak man can be a pack of trouble for any family," L'Tisha Morton (Vanessa Williams) warns her elder son, Isaiah (Rodney Henry). The same goes for scripts and movies. Directed and written by Anthony Lover, "My Brother" is brimming with would-be life lessons. But the movie goes in so many directions, and follows through on so few of them, that all it transmits is a vague glow. It's watered-down chicken soup for the soul.
 
 As children, Isaiah and his brother, James (Donovan Jennings), are raised with a loving but firm hand. As orphaned adults in present-day Brooklyn, the brothers, played by Nashawn Kearse and Christopher Scott, find their mother's words hard to live up to. Isaiah is an aspiring stand-up comedian, although given the few glimpses of his pitiful stage act, he'd be best advised to stick to his day job. That is, if he had a day job. James is a straight arrow, a steady earner who goes to church while his brother works on his material. So that we don't miss the parallel, the movie cuts between Isaiah bombing onstage at a comedy club and James beatifically listening to a church choir.
 


         






   It would be a simple matter for James to take care of his big brother, were James not developmentally disabled. (The character is diagnosed only as "special" and "mildly different"; both actors who play the role have Down syndrome.) Isaiah cannot look after himself, and the burden of looking after James seems to be more than he can bear.
 
 So far, so potentially poignant. When a friend advises Isaiah that the only way to make it as a stand-up is to "talk more about your personal experiences," the movie's path seems clear. Isaiah will, after much soul-searching and perhaps a few wrong moves, make peace with his adult responsibilities and embrace his brother once and for all. Cue song. Fade out.
 
 But then "My Brother" takes the first of several hairpin turns. Eager for some quick cash, Isaiah sets up a meeting with some shady Middle Eastern types. (Although it is careful to paint its African American characters with respect, the movie seems to have no qualms about employing Arab stereotypes that would give the producers of "24" pause.) Tasked with exchanging one mysterious package for another during a party at an African embassy, Isaiah — left turn No. 2 — bumps into Erica (Tatum O'Neal), a chatty translator who greets him with, "Isaiah, the most political and universal of all the prophets." So, uh, do you come here often?
 
 What this has to do with Isaiah's bid for self-determination is open to question, especially since their interaction seems to be missing several crucial scenes. One second, she's charming her way into his car; the next, he's telling a friend about their ride back to the city.
 
 Stingy as the movie is with that storyline, it's far too generous with its childhood flashbacks, especially an undigested half-hour chunk that lands at the halfway mark. The actors playing young Isaiah and James give the movie's two best performances, but Williams lacks the grit and gumption to play a steely Southern matriarch. (It doesn't help that Anna Deavere Smith's far more compelling performance in a similar role is currently on view in the HBO movie "Life Support.") With her sanctified nostrums and tubercular cough, L'Tisha is a figure out of 19th century literature, but "My Brother" falls victim to a very 21st century inability to stick to the point.
 
 "My Brother." MPAA rating: PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images and language. Running time: 1 hour, 48 minutes. In selected theaters.   

 "My Brother" is billed as the tale of two poor, orphaned siblings, the aspiring standup comic Isaiah (Nashawn Kearse) and the developmentally disabled James (Christopher Scott). It wants to be much more than that. At times it seems to want to counter 15 years' worth of Mayhem-N-the-Hood stereotypes all by itself, folding in commentary on the theological conundrums involved in accepting Down syndrome as God's will; the bond of Otherness shared by African-Americans and nonwhite Third World citizens; the perils of interracial romance; and the proper social function of standup comedy.  "My Brother," written and directed by Anthony Lover, suffers from organizational problems, overly expository dialogue and a tendency to overreach (particularly a subplot in which Isaiah accepts a job as a courier for  shady-seeming Middle Easterners and ends up embroiled in lame intrigue).  But its earnest tone, moving orchestral score (by John Califra) and strong cast (including Vanessa L. Williams, seen in flashbacks as the boys' fiercely devoted mother) carry it past the rough patches. And from the early scene in which James makes himself a sandwich while absentmindedly dancing to hip-hop, "My Brother" anchors sentiment to reality.  The movie's strongest element is the chemistry between the reflective Mr. Kearse and  Mr. Scott (who really has Down syndrome). Improving on its obvious antecedent in "Dominick and Eugene," their relationship feels real, not like a movie contrivance.  "My Brother" is rated  PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence and mild profanity.

A young man takes an awfully long time to discover what the audience already knows -- that his disabled brother is the most precious thing in his life -- in "My Brother," a heavy-handed redemption story fresh off the African-American fest circuit. Heading up pic's nearly all-black cast, Vanessa Williams delivers a decidedly non-glam performance as the mother who wants her boys to stick together. Pushing uplift instead of action, white writer-director Anthony Lover brings sensitivity to both the cultural differences and his "special" young stars. "My Brother's" sincere story could could attract modest urban business before finding its niche on DVD.
An undercurrent of religiosity sets the tone for the film's moralist message, as terminally ill L'Tisha Morton (Williams) tells her son Isaiah (played by Rodney Henry in flashbacks and Nashawn Kearse in the present) that "the good Lord blessed us: two brothers, one soul." But after years of baby-sitting his developmentally disabled soulmate James (Christopher Scott as an adult, Donovan Jennings as a child -- both actors with Down syndrome), 30-year-old Isaiah wants to go his own way and become a standup comic.
For a film about an aspiring comedian, "My Brother" offers precious few laughs. A failure onstage, Isaiah resorts to taking a shady courier job exchanging unmarked packages for a gang of Middle Eastern goons. But before he can complete his first delivery, the envelope disappears.
There's no question Lover intends "My Brother" to focus on Isaiah and James relationship. However, by introducing the mysterious package (and an unlikely love interest in the form of Tatum O'Neal), he creates a distracting McGuffin sure to drive auds crazy. While the movie detours into dreary flashbacks of Isaiah's tough-love childhood, they'll be left wondering what's in the envelope and, more importantly, why Isaiah doesn't check the spot where it's almost certainly hidden.
Pic would have done better to reveal the brothers' childhood dynamic earlier. Instead, it's not until long after the thugs who hired Isaiah show up at his apartment -- roughing up poor James in the process --�that auds even get a sense of their relationship. Strong acting helps, including impressive perfs from two special-needs thesps. (In an intriguing twist, Kearse, who appeared as Alfre Woodard's "slow" son on "Desperate Housewives," plays it straight here.)
Auds must wait nearly an hour for Williams to get a proper scene as the tough-as-nails mother. Stripped of makeup and attitude, the actress couldn't be more different here from her vampy "Ugly Betty" persona: When Williams isn't essaying a Savannah accent to advise her sons on living honorably, she's coughing in bloody tubercular fits.
No wonder Isaiah never gets personal on stage. But revealing the grim details of his past doesn't substitute for proper redemption in the present, and Isaiah never actually does anything (except stare out a train window and narrate his flashbacks) to suggest a transformation, betraying a level of amateurishness at the story level otherwise masked by the pic's production values.


This torpid, independently made urban melodrama follows aspiring stand-up comic Isaiah (Nashawn Kearse) as he takes a job "moving packages" for some shady Middle Easterners in an ill-advised effort to make a better life for himself and his developmentally disabled brother (Christopher Scott ). Soon Isaiah finds himself on the run from shadowy men in unmarked cars who want to bust his kneecaps, and we see in flashback how both boys came of age on the streets of New Yorkfirst under the care of their TB-stricken mother (Vanessa Williams ) and, later, as wards of the worst state-run institutions this side of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . When he isn't trafficking in that risible old notion that a black man's only hope of movin'-on-up in America is by turning to a life of crime, writer-director Anthony Lover  takes such a kid-gloves approach to his handicapped co-star that he achieves the opposite of the intended effect: Every time Scott enters a scene, it's as if someone just told the entire cast "Whatever you do, don't say 'retard.' "
