So your husband's boss is coming over for dinner. The meal you've prepared is splendid. But the boss's wife is in a foul mood. She refuses to remove her sunglasses. She accuses her husband of sleeping with whores. She chucks a glass of wine in his face, then curses you for being snotty and pathetic. With that, she's gone. Only she's not. Days later, you've allowed her to move in to your nice home in southern France. Are you crazy?
Not nearly enough to wring any naughty pleasure out of ``Lemming," Dominik Moll's aggravating follow - up to 2000's unnerving thriller ``With a Friend Like Harry." The new movie is just as clammy as the previous one, but it's more psychologically impenetrable than it really ought to be. When we meet Bénédicte (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her robotics specialist husband, Alain (Laurent Lucas, who played the stalked pal in ``Harry"), they're a blissful couple. The mirth disappears not long after the boss, Richard (André Dussollier), drags his vicious wife, Alice (Charlotte Rampling), to dinner.
Alice, of course, is a piece of work, having set out to destroy happiness wherever it exists. Naturally, moving in with Bénédicte and Alain and then planting seeds of doubt about the strength of their marital bond are obvious means of sabotage. But before long, Moll moves on to even more opaque developments, such as what to do about the rodent Alain finds clogging the kitchen sink. It's a lemming, and it's not entirely dead. Despite the title, though, it seems beside the point.
Moll goes out of his way to ensure that ``Lemming" inspires maximum head scratching. Even by the strictest standards of odd French psychological drama, the behavior here is particularly opaque. There's a suicide, an affair, and a murder, and I wish I could say I knew why any of them occurred. Moll even provides inconsequential shots of the road as Bénédicte and Alain head for the country, seemingly to give us time to figure it all out. The actors, however, appear to have been instructed to give nothing away, especially Gainsbourg, who has never seemed more like a mannequin than she does here. This is such a wasted opportunity for her and Rampling to go Charlotte à Charlotte.
Moll is even determined, with his sulky and stultifying grip on the action, to snuff out even the littlest bits of intrigue. Like ``Harry," the movie might be an exercise in covetousness. But is Moll kidding with that extramarital affair? Or the silly ending that explains everything yet explains nothing?
Because ``Harry" was such a darkly efficient piece of work, you stick with ``Lemming" to see where Moll and his co-writer Gilles Marchand might take us. (More horrifying scenes with lemmings gone wild, please.) The truth is, we go nowhere in particular. The score is the most effective thing about the film. Sometimes it's a suspicious, mischie-vous distraction from the reality that not enough of this makes sense.


 Alain and Bénédicte Getty (Laurent Lucas and Charlotte Gainsbourg) are a sweet young couple living in a pleasant suburban neighborhood in the South of France. Alain has an exciting job designing computer gadgets — notably a remote-controlled Webcam — and one night he invites his boss (André Dussollier) over for dinner.  At that point in "Lemming," a new thriller directed by Dominik Moll ("With a Friend Like Harry"), things start to go wrong. The kitchen sink is blocked, and the dinner party is marred by the strange behavior of the boss's wife, Alice (Charlotte Rampling), who doesn't remove her sunglasses and throws a glass of wine in her husband's face.  The plumbing obstruction turns out to be a small rodent — the lemming of the title — which somehow found its way from Scandinavia into the Gettys' pipes. And Alice's outburst foreshadows more trouble to come: inappropriate sexual advances, a fatal gunshot and some vexing supernatural occurrences. All of this turns Alain's tranquil domestic life into a nightmare, something out of Alfred Hitchcock or Claude Chabrol.  Well, not quite. Mr. Moll is clever, and for the first half of "Lemming" he manages to imbue ordinary goings-on with inklings of strangeness that are at once sinister and quietly comical. But there is, in the end, less to this film than meets the eye.  The director (who wrote the screenplay with Gilles Marchand) flirts with silliness and gets lucky. Like other youngish French filmmakers — François Ozon, for example, who has also made use of Ms. Rampling's chilly, enigmatic charm — Mr. Moll likes to tease the boundary between the ghost story and the psychological thriller and to throw the viewer's sense of reality off balance. Is the lemming an omen? A metaphor? A hamster? Is Alice who she appears to be? Is Bénédicte?  Unfortunately the answers to these questions turn out to be not all that interesting, and the picture takes too long in answering them. Mr. Lucas, a likable, easygoing actor (who also appeared in "With a Friend Like Harry"), is too bland and transparent here to give full resonance to Alain's discomfort.  Ms. Gainsbourg is a more mysterious and unpredictable performer, but Bénédicte too is ultimately a cipher. The second half of the movie squanders suspense and momentum, solving its riddles by deflating them.

A happy young couple's relationship is buffeted by unsettling developments, including a visit from the title rodent, in "Lemming." Five years after "With a Friend Like Harry...", helmer and co-writer Dominik Moll presents another tension-filled, off-kilter riff on the interactions of two couples. The first reel is terrific and the subsequent hour is consistently intriguing. The remainder of lengthy pic, however, will either entertain or frustrate viewers, depending on how much of an appetite for possibly supernatural digressions they bring to the theater. Pic -- which opens Cannes in Competition -- should connect with filmgoers who don't find ambiguity off-putting.
Spooky, intellectually titillating and darkly funny pic is definitely the kind of film where the less you know going in, the better. It's not so much that there are twists or secrets that shouldn't be revealed prematurely -- although there is one such zinger. Rather, the entire venture is an accretion of odd behavior intermingled with level-headed behavior until something (or several somethings) has got to give.
Alain Getty (Laurent Lucas) and his wife of three years, Benedicte (Charlotte Gainsbourg), moved to the modern community of Bel Air somewhere in southern France just three months ago. Alain, who designs ingenious remote control systems, enjoys his new job as an engineer at the hi-tech firm owned and run by Richard Pollock (Andre Dussollier). Alain's latest invention is a surveillance camera encased in a tiny helicopter that can fly around checking for leaks or other potential household problems.
Alain's temperament matches the rigors of his profession. He's smart, disciplined and believes in technology, science and self-control. His marriage to even-tempered Benedicte is playful and lovey-dovey.
But the night Alain's boss Pollock and his wife Alice (a delectably unnerving Charlotte Rampling) come to dinner is, as Alain's brief voiceover explains, the moment things begin to unravel.
The Pollocks are late and when they do arrive, helmer makes the most of awkward silences and a veneer of good manners. Alice Pollock wears dark glasses indoors at night and holds herself like a hostile zombie. If she ever had social filters, she shed them long ago.
They're barely into the appetizer when Alice voices some brutally inappropriate allegations about her seemingly quite pleasant husband. The Pollocks leave before the main course.
Unable to sleep after they leave, Alain sets about fixing the clogged kitchen sink. He finds a furry, hamster-like critter blocking the drainage pipe.
The next day at the office, Pollock apologizes to Alain for the awkward evening, explaining that his wife is "eccentric." But eccentricity alone can't explain her behavior, which takes a bold and troubling turn that very night.
Meanwhile, Benedicte has taken the not-quite-dead rodent to a vet, who tells her it's a lemming -- and that lemmings live exclusively in Scandinavia. How could this one have made its way into a drain pipe in southern France? As it turns out, that enigma is easier to explain than the mechanisms that spark and regulate human guilt, desire and sexual fantasy.
Bulk of narrative is wide open to interpretation, admiringly echoing certain of Kubrick's works in places and invoking a debt to the canon of usurped-identity films in others. Most of the time, Moll's visual assurance -- and black humor -- helps even familiar-seeming territory feel original. But the progressively stranger tale loses some of its initial grip in final third.
Central quartet meshes admirably, with Rampling irreplaceable and Dussollier putting just the right spin on his straight-shooting, guilt-free businessman. Sound design -- including score -- is aces.

Exhilaratingly anxious, Dominik Moll 's new film Lemming  charts familiar territory but does it with gravity and panache. Truly, the Idealized Upper-Middle-Class Family Under Metaphoric Siege Movie is such a perennial that one could be forgiven for a certain degree of genre fatiguelast year, Michael Haneke 's Caché  may have elevated the dynamic onto a new plane of philosophical angst. Moll himself debuted with a creepily enthralling entry, 2000's With a Friend Like Harry , but Lemming  is better, largely thanks to its inventive iconography and spooky rhythmsit's a patient, savory psychodrama, and a triumph of unsettled reaction shots.
We first see techno-inventor Alain (Laurent Lucas ) demonstrating his array of robotic home-maintenance devices for his new Bel Air  employers. At home, he and his childless gamine of a wife, Bénédicte (Charlotte Gainsbourg ), are still moving in; impactions and disturbances, including a neighbor slapping his kid in the street and a stubborn kitchen sink clog, lurk at the edges. When the boss (André Dussollier ) comes over for dinner with his steely, beshaded wife (Charlotte Rampling ), we're braced as the young couple isn't for an air burst of uneasiness. It comes: Rampling's unstable shrike lashes out at her perhaps unfaithful husband, and Alain and Bénédicte get a taste of the menopausal disaster that could lie in their future.
But we're not yet a quarter of the way into Moll's saga, which is when Alain opens the drainpipe and pulls out a near dead lemming, and Rampling tries to seduce Alain at the lab, telling him that her husband had tried to kill her years before ("I had it coming," she shrugs). The infestations escalate: Soon, and suddenly, the boss's wife installs herself in the youngsters' spare room and shoots herself in the head. From there, Alain and Bénédicte's life enters a no-man's-land of could-be hauntings, lost consciousness, and betrayal. Only the portentous music is in any way Hitchcockian; Moll's mystery achievement instead heads subtly into Lynch country, especially when Bénédicte watches with us a video feed from a motorized sewer camera, trucking into the secret darkness under every street.
Gainsbourg is beguilingly unpretty, and Rampling is so convincing in her confrontational misery that you suspect she's simply recalling her own decades of depression. But Lemming  might've been merely an exercise if it weren't for Lucas, whose chiseled Daniel Day-Lewis ness is a high-contrast foil to the actor's phenomenal ability to radiate horror without moving a muscle. In the end, Moll's film may be too neat (and too lengthy), but the wallop of disquiet is delicious.
