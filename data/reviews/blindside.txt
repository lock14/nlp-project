Maybe you flinched at the mawkish trailer. Maybe you already know the story � a true story about a poor black kid adopted by a wealthy white one with a happily-ever-after that ends in an NFL first-round draft pick � and worried that in no way could a studio film handle with any finesse the complicated class and race dynamics within. Or maybe you�ve just seen too many �and the crowd goes wild!� sports movies. There are a lot of built-in, probably undeserved reasons to approach The Blind Side
 with reservations, but writer/director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie
) makes a shrewd play in the film�s opening minutes. In a kicky beginning scored by Dave Brubeck�s spare, propulsive �Unsquare Dance,� a thickly drawling Bullock narrates footage from a 1985 NFL game. In grainy video playback, we see New York Giants� linebacker Lawrence Taylor deliver a bone-crunching sack to the Redskins� Joe Theismann in a takedown that ended the quarterback�s career. The play also rather violently demonstrates the essentiality of a left tackle to protect the quarterback�s blind side � information that will be called upon later in the film when a homeless, hulking 16-year-old named Michael Oher (Aaron) begins playing the same position at a Christian private school in Memphis. Hancock could have delivered that information to the audience in any number of ways, and none of them would have been half so elegant and enlivening as those opening minutes. The shrewdness comes in Hancock immediately raising the bar � an opening salvo to say �quality movie coming� � so that when the film does
 inevitably slide into the standard tropes of sports and local-boy-makes-good movies, the effect is less rankling. (Good will established early is a lot harder to blot out than a bad first impression.) Also in the plus column are two standout performances: Aaron, as the sweet-mannered but largely uncommunicative Michael (Aaron does some very subtle body work, using the way he carries his heft as an emotional signpost), and Bullock, as the prickly, straight-talking Memphis socialite who welcomes Michael into her home and eventually makes him a part of the family. This is a dream role for Bullock � finally, a job that requires her to be adult, tart, and smart, all at once � and she makes good use of it. It�s not an altogether convincing portrait, but it is an entertaining, even moving one, and the forcefulness of her presence goes a long way in pulling the film back from the brink of cuddliness. The Blind Side
 � which Hancock adapted from Michael Lewis� nonfiction book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game
 � doesn�t rise to the challenge inherent in its premise: That is, Hancock mostly restricts the story�s scope to its heartwarming bits and begs off any serious investigation of race. The reason, of course, is that this isn�t that kind of movie. But I couldn�t help but wish that it were.

It may be based on a true story, but “The Blind Side’’ delivers two heart-yanking hours of Hollywood physics. One kid’s bad existence gets better with the application of a great deal of upper-middle-class pressure. The movie recounts the story of how a tough-loving interior decorator named Leigh Anne Touhy  (Sandra Bullock ) invited Michael Oher  (Quinton Aaron), an enormous, athletic African-American teenager into her Memphis McMansion to live with her two children and adoring husband (Tim McGraw).
Leigh Anne is the unstoppable force. Michael is the immovable object. But as his grades improve and as he’s nudged toward a Division 1 football scholarship (he’s a natural tackle), Michael starts to open up. But we’re meant to believe that it’s Leigh Anne who does all the growing. Which seems about right for a movie built around Bullock. She is as entertaining as she gets here.
In miniskirts and clingy pants, and with a heavy cosmetic lacquer, Bullock sashays away from the camera, leaving the males in a tizzy. The last word is always hers. She’s part Erin Brockovich, part Julia Sugarbaker. And like Sugarbaker, Leigh Anne is a designing woman. Her interest in Michael feels momentarily like an extension of her job. “Lord knows that place could use some color,’’ she says of the private Christian academy that has charitably accepted Michael, who, until Leigh Anne, was homeless and could barely express himself. The state wrested him away from his birth mother, who’s a drug addict.
Bullock’s levelheaded acting frequently saves the movie from emotional garishness. She’s hardly subtle, but she’s not showy, either. This is basically one of her comedic parts given a “Real Housewives’’ gloss. But watching Bullock light up with satisfaction brought back unwelcome memories of that nauseating hug she gives her Mexican maid at the end of “Crash’’: I love you, person of color. Leigh Anne gives Michael his very first bed and a real shot at a college football scholarship. He reminds her that her dining room table happens to be useful for dining with the family someplace other than in front of the two TVs in the living room.
Writer and director John Lee Hancock  bears down on the more affecting parts of Michael Lewis’s  2006 book, “The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.’’ (Half of it was devoted to Oher, the other to Lawrence Taylor’s  arrival in the NFL.) The Touhys’ compassion and the idea of a white community banding together to help a disenfranchised black teenager is a touching human display (Kathy Bates  even shows up as a tutor).
Hancock doesn’t exactly have a heavy touch. Following the arc of Lewis’s journalism, he delicately raises possibilities of cynicism, boosterism, and liberal guilt, and the movie grazes the idea of being afraid of certain black male stereotypes  - long after they occur to us, but still. And it seems to anticipate our worry that Michael, gracious and pacific as he is and as good as Aaron is in the part, has too few thoughts of his own. Oher plays in the NFL for the Baltimore Ravens now, and you wonder how he feels about being represented as such a passive part of his own success.
Commercial American movies seem interested in stories about young black men saved from God knows what by nice white people or sports. Here it’s both. That double jackpot happens occasionally in life. But it’s a staple in Hollywood, where large, kind black men are sometimes both a blessing and a threat (see “The Green Mile’’). Oher’s life is meant to make us feel good, and it mostly does. But how good we feel about his story is proportional to how blind we’re willing to be about how it’s told.

Every so often, American pop culture coughs up a family that's too good to be true  and, of course, it's that very too-goodness that makes them irresistible to audiences (or is supposed to, at any rate). In the '70s, we had the wholesome double whammy of the Waltons and the Bradys, and in the '90s the compulsively charitable clan of 7th Heaven . More recently, the Duggars on 18 Kids and Counting  have nudged that squeaky-clean homespun virtue into the reality TV era. According to The Blind Side , you can now add another family to the list: the Tuohys. That would be blond, tart-tongued, and down-home saintly Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock, trying a middle-American-mom role on for size (and finding the fit comfortably snug); her husband, Sean, played by country superstar Tim McGraw as a benign domestic yes-man who is never more happy than when he's kowtowing to his wife; and their picture-perfect neo-'50s kids, beautiful teen achiever Collins (Lily Collins) and toothy scamp SJ (Jae Head). A glowing, prosperous bunch who live in one of the tonier sections of Memphis (Leigh Anne wears a six-studded diamond crucifix that looks like it must be worth $100,000), the Tuohys are all about sweetness and light, along with a spoonful of sass to help the sugar go down.
The day before Thanksgiving, they're driving along in their oversize car when they spot one of Collins' classmates at the Christian Wingate School. His name is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), and he's 17, doughy and tall, and appears every inch the lost, lonely, and homeless young fellow he is. Leigh Anne, as impulsive as she is good, doesn't waste a moment before asking him over to the Tuohy home, where they put him up for the night. He stays for Thanksgiving, when they all clasp hands to say grace, and before long he's been invited to live with the Tuohys and become part of their family. He trades in his worn gray clothes for a series of colorful striped rugby shirts, which is how we know that his mood is brightening.
Michael, known as Big Mike, is a refugee from the projects, and he's been wedged into the Wingate School by a football coach who sees his potential as a Mack truck of a lineman. But he can barely read, and doesn't have much inclination to talk. Aaron, who plays him, has an appealing gentle-giant presence. Since Michael rarely says more than a few words at a time, you keep scanning his kind, sad eyes and hesitant manner for a hint of what he's about, and also to see how, exactly, he's going to mesh with this family that's embraced him as an act of charity, adventure, and brotherly love. As The Blind Side  presents it, however, there isn't a lot to Michael. He shows no interest in girls or friends or videogames or TV shows. Even compared with the superficially similar lost girl in Precious , he never asserts himself or asks for anything. He just hangs out, like a fifth family member who's also a kind of mascot. The three kids get along great  at one point Mike and SJ do a duet on ''Bust a Move,'' which is about as exciting as things get  and there's never a hint of tension, or of finely woven camaraderie, among them.
Written and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie ), The Blind Side  is a feel-good movie that never stops feeling good. The film is based on a true story (it was adapted from a nonfiction best-seller by Michael Lewis), but you never feel that Hancock has honestly captured what's true about it. He's so devoted to showing us what upbeat, selfless folks Leigh Anne and her family are that the movie never quite gets around to discovering what any of those far superior saintly-family TV shows surely would have: a dramatic conflict. Not that there aren't, you know, plot points. Will Michael manage to get his grades up? Will he make it on the football team? And how will he handle those college recruiters? In theory, it's fascinating to see Bullock harness her considerable appeal to the role of a   Republican Christian housewife who's a card-carrying member of the NRA. Yet what The Blind Side  offers is a kind of liberal Hollywood version of conservative values: all rock-solid valor, all the time. The result isn't solid at all  it's more like cotton-candy uplift.


 One of the many turning points in “The Blind Side” — a movie made up almost entirely of turning points and yet curiously devoid of drama or suspense — comes during a Memphis high school football game. Michael Oher, the offensive tackle whose remarkable life is the subject of the film (and of the nonfiction best seller on which it is based), is having trouble protecting his quarterback.  An especially obnoxious player on the opposing team taunts Michael and evades his blocks down after down. But finally Michael snaps into focus and, on a climactically important play, grabs hold of the guy and steamrolls him all the way down the field, dumping him into the stands as the crowd (in the stadium and also, most likely, in the movie theater) cheers.  What Michael (played by Quinton Aaron) does to that hapless defender is pretty much what Sandra Bullock does to the audience for the entirety of “The Blind Side,” which is a very long time. Ms. Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Memphis decorator who, along with her family, rescues Michael from homelessness and sets him on a path to football stardom. The outlines of the story — and the details as recounted in Michael Lewis’s book — are both interesting and inspiring. A wealthy, white Southern family adopts a poor black teenager, cultivating his athletic gifts and providing him with the comfort and safety of a happy, loving home.  And the film, not unsurprisingly for a holiday- (and football-) season release from a major Hollywood studio, plays this story straight down the middle, shedding nuance and complication in favor of maximum uplift. Ms. Bullock is convincing enough as an energetic, multitasking woman of the New South, who knows her own mind and usually gets her own way. And Tim McGraw, as Leigh Anne’s affable husband, Sean, inhabits his character comfortably and knows how to get out of Ms. Bullock’s way when necessary.  The Tuohys have a pretty daughter named Collins (Lily Collins) and a wisecracking whirligig of a son, S J  (Jae Head), who would, if this were an animated children’s movie, be Michael’s annoying-but-lovable talking-animal sidekick. And “The Blind Side,” written and directed by John Lee Hancock (“The Rookie,” “The Alamo”), is, in effect, a live-action, reality-based version of a Disney cartoon: it’s the heartwarming tale of a foundling taken in by strangers, who accept him even though he’s different and treat him as one of their own.  In a typical Disney movie, however, that process would be full of conflict, excitement and danger. “The Blind Side,” until the end — when an N.C.A.A. bureaucrat throws a hasty obstacle in the way of Michael’s triumph — is more like a two-hour holiday greeting card. Leigh Anne and Sean first spot Michael in the school gym after one of Collins’s volleyball games, and on the drive home figure out that, even though he attends this private Christian academy on scholarship, he has no place to sleep. Before you know it this impulsive act of generosity turns into a project, to which Leigh Anne devotes herself with tireless zeal.  A few of her friends raise eyebrows and make unkind remarks, but she puts them in their places with a few heartfelt, angry words and a swell of soundtrack music. She does the same to the drug dealer back in the projects where Michael used to live, and to anyone else who messes with her and her family.  All of which can be fun to watch, as are walk-ons from real-life college football coaches. And Ms. Bullock’s brisk self-confidence can be appealing — until it becomes annoying. The biggest problem here is that her character never changes, never experiences a moment of doubt or guilt or selfishness, and after a while her display of goodness sinks into vanity. And Michael is a curiously blank character, his inner life lost in the glare of Leigh Anne’s self-congratulation. His pre-Tuohy life is a flurry of flashbacks and vague stories meant — like that drug dealer and Michael’s drug-addicted mother, who appears on screen briefly — to conjure a world of violence, dysfunction and despair.  “The Blind Side” is interested only in that world as an occasion for selective charity, and it is only slightly more interested in Michael’s inner life. He seems shy, grateful, sometimes sad and always, to Leigh Anne, an open book. She hears that a psychological test shows Michael to have an unusually strong protective instinct, and uses that information to unlock his latent offensive-tackle abilities. The left tackle’s job is to protect the quarterback from unseen opponents, and if Michael just thinks of the quarterback as his family — “as me,” Leigh Anne says — he’ll know just what to do to the other team. And it works, just as if the young man were a 300-pound robot she had reprogrammed with the flip of a switch.  And the audience is meant to respond in similar fashion, choking up, chuckling with warm laughter, feeling so sorry for this poor young man and so gratified that he found someone to care for him. Will you be moved? Maybe, though only in the sense that “moved” can describe the experience of defensive player, overpowered by a blocker and left flat on his back with a possible concussion.    “The Blind Side” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some on- and off-field violence, and some drug and sexual references.

After swinging for the fences and scoring a sleeper success with "The Rookie" (2002), writer-director John Lee Hancock takes the field with "The Blind Side," another uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama. The combo of top-billed Sandra Bullock's marquee allure and a true-life story with well-nigh irresistible emotional appeal probably would be enough to fill megaplex stadiums at any time of the year. But this Nov. 20 Warners release is particularly well positioned to be a four-quadrant hit as the consensus choice of family auds during the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
Based on material in "Moneyball" author Michael Lewis' "The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game," the attractively packaged pic occasionally runs the risk of straining credibility -- or, worse, inviting skepticism -- while dramatizing the particulars of what was, evidently, a best-case scenario for all parties involved. Indeed, there's not even the threat of an insurmountable obstacle until the final half-hour.
But then again, it's difficult to imagine anything that could long impede or contain the force of nature that is Leigh Anne Tuohy, the feisty Memphis belle played by Bullock with equal measures of acerbic sass, steel-willed brass and unabashed sentiment. Bullock is thoroughly convincing in the role -- right down to her credible accent and the blonding of her normally brown tresses -- and she's not afraid to occasionally keep auds guessing as to whether Leigh Ann's actions are driven by a heart of gold or a whim of iron.
Both motives appear to be at work when Leigh Ann impulsively invites into her family's palatial home one of her daughter's classmates: Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), an immense African-American teenager from the poor side of town. Virtually homeless and barely educated after years of neglect, Michael can scarcely speak, much less read. But he shows promise as a football player, and that's more than enough for a desperate coach (Ray McKinnon) to finagle a way for Michael attend his tony Memphis private school.
After that, it's up to Leigh Ann and her family -- lovingly tolerant husband Sean (Tim McGraw), lovely teen daughter Collins (Lily Collins) and wiseacre young son SJ (Jae Head) -- to make sure Michael takes advantage of his good fortune and actually learns a few things from his teachers.
If "The Blind Side" weren't based on a true story -- the real Oher ultimately was adopted by the Tuohys, thrived in his new environment and currently plays for the Baltimore Ravens -- it likely would be dissed by dismissive critics as a simplistic white-liberal fantasy. (It'll be interesting to see how many reviewers won't be able to resist comparing the film with a certain other recent drama about an overweight, illiterate African-American teen who transcends humble origins.)
In fact, the veracity of the storyline won't be enough to prevent some of the professionally outraged from accusing "Blind Side" of implying that underprivileged black folks must rely on rich, well-intentioned white folks -- Leigh Ann is a successful interior decorator, and her husband owns a gazillion fast-food restaurants -- to escape the slums and be all they can be.
But what happened, happened. And even though Hancock applies more than a smidge of sugar-coating to his dramatization, "The Blind Side" remains involving, affecting and, for the most part, emotionally honest. Better still, the pic has an insightful and evenhanded view of racial and political realities in the contemporary South.
Leigh Anne is disappointed but not entirely surprised by the not-so-veiled racism of her well-to-do-friends, which the pic dutifully acknowledges. On the other hand, Leigh Anne and Sean fleetingly own up to prejudices of their own after hiring a left-leaning tutor (zestfully played by Kathy Bates) for Michael. "Who ever thought," Sean remarks, "we would have a black son before we knew a Democrat?"
Newcomer Aaron gracefully treads a fine line, playing Michael as neither dullard nor idiot savant, but making him emotionally vulnerable, painfully self-aware and surprisingly resilient. Better still, Aaron more than holds his own opposite Bullock, enabling the pic to come off as something far more rewarding and complex than a mere star vehicle.
Country music superstar McGraw again evidences quietly impressive thesping ability, while Collins and Head ably complete the family unit. Adriane Lenox makes every moment count in her brief but layered cameo as Michael's crack-addicted mom, and actor-filmmaker Ray McKinnon demonstrates fine comic chops as a character who couldn't be more unlike the white-trash interloper he so memorably essays in "That Evening Sun."
Tech values are first-rate, with Atlanta locations adequately subbing for Memphis locales.

Another poor, massive, uneducated African-American teenager lumbers onto screens this month, two weeks after Precious   and obviously timed as a pre-Thanksgiving-dinner lesson in the Golden Rule. But unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones, The Blind Side  's Michael "Big Mike" Oher (Quinton Aaron ) is mute, docile, and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. Directed by John Lee Hancock  and based on a true story recounted in Michael Lewis 's 2006 book of the same name, Blind Side  the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them.
The steel Magnolia who takes pity on homeless Big Mike after she sees him walking in the freezing rain in just a polo shirt and XXX-large denim shorts is Leigh Anne Tuohy  (Sandra Bullock ), a frosted interior decorator, wife of Taco Bell  franchise owner Sean (Tim McGraw ), and mother of teenage cheerleader Collins  (Lily Collins) and hyper half-pint S.J. (Jae Head , giving the year's most excruciatingly muggy performance by a child actor), who attend the same Christian academy that recently accepted the mountainous youth. An officious caretaker, Leigh Anne  clears out the guest bedroom for Michael, earning the nervous praise of the Tennessee  doyennes with whom she regularly lunches. Though they congratulate their friend's altruism, they're convinced Leigh Anne's new charge will either rob her Memphis McMansion  or violate her daughter: "You're changing that boy's life," one applauds. Her response, of course: "No. He's changing mine."
In a way, Oher's story does change Bullock's life, giving her an awards-bait role filled with preachiness and thickly accented speech"seriousness," after this year's rom-com humiliations The Proposal  and All About Steve  . But for all the supposed uplift, Bullock's facile Good Christian Materialist Southern Woman is part of The Blind Side 's desperate cynicism, succinctly expressed in Sean's comment to his wife: "Michael's gift is his ability to forget."
Viewers, however, are constantly reminded of the pathologies the black gentle giant has escaped: the crack-addicted mother ("I can't even remember who the boy's father is," she weeps to Leigh Anne), the thugs of the country-ghetto housing project who offer him a 40-ouncer. Life with benevolent white people gives Michael the golden opportunity to partake in one of the most patronizing, we-are-the-world scenes imaginable: dueting with S.J. on "Bust a Move." S.J. becomes an unbearable martinet, bossing Michael around during drills for football practice, where the large lad shines as a left tackle at the Christian academy, eventually drafted to Ole Miss  (and, as real-life footage of the actual Oher shows during the closing credits, later to the Baltimore Ravens ). But Michael is unable to figure out what he actually needs to do  on the fielduntil his white momma explains it to him: "This team is your family. You protect them."
In every scene, Oher is instructed, lectured, comforted, or petted like a big puppy; he is merely a cipher (Aaron has, at most, two pages of dialogue), the vehicle through which the kind-hearted but imperfect whites surrounding him are made saintlier. "Am I a good person?" Leigh Anne asks Sean non-rhetoricallyas if every second in this film weren't devoted to canonizing her.
Michael is aggressively courted by SEC football  coaches (many playing themselves, an unintentionally grotesque parade of bad orthodonture and worse-fitting suits), and, after an unpleasant run-in with an NCAA  official toward the film's end, Leigh Anne soothes Michael by assuring him that "the past is gone, the world's a good place, and it's all gonna be OK." The filmmakers would like to lull you to sleep with this milk of amnesia, hiding behind the fact that this bewilderingly condescending movie is based on an actual personbut one who you end up knowing almost nothing about.
