 Dangerous liaisons with good intentions: the matchmaking games in Emmanuel Mouret’s romantic comedy “Shall We Kiss?” may backfire, but nobody is seriously hurt. The players in this mouth-watering Gallic soufflé are so attractive, well mannered and comfortably grounded in the bourgeois world that you needn’t fear for their well-being, minor heartaches notwithstanding.  Concocted by Mr. Mouret (“Change of Address”), who likes to appear in his own films (he suggests Woody Allen as a lost puppy), “Shall We Kiss?” could have come only from France, a country whose movies would have you believe that most people over 16 are well dressed, cultured and sophisticated without being jaded. These are the same young people who have flocked through Eric Rohmer’s movies since the 1970s. But “Shall We Kiss?” doesn’t have the underlying moral gravity of a Rohmer film.  It begins in Nantes with a chance meeting of two beautiful strangers: Gabriel (Michaël Cohen), a local furniture restorer, and Émilie (Julie Gayet), a fabric designer in town on a brief business trip from Paris. He offers her a ride to her destination, which  leads to a romantic dinner, at the end of which hovers a delicious question: whether to seal their enchanted evening with a farewell kiss or to leave each other wondering, What if?  Émilie, who is happily partnered  but tempted, balks and begins to tell the cautionary tale of two acquaintances, Judith (Virginie Ledoyen) and Nicolas (Mr. Mouret), that makes up the heart of this movie-within-a-movie. Best friends since high school who have always confided their deepest secrets, Nicolas, a math teacher, and Judith, a laboratory researcher, act like grown-up children when they’re together.  The relationship reaches a crossroads when Nicolas, in despair for lack of physical intimacy since a recent breakup, entreats Judith, who lives comfortably with Claudio (Stefano Accorsi), a pharmacist, to bring him back to life by being his sexual surrogate.  Concerned and devoted pal that she is, Judith agrees — after he reports that even a visit to a prostitute didn’t help, because the date fizzled when the woman refused to kiss. The friends’ first tentative touching of lips recalls the moment in a science fiction movie when a male earthling bestows a kiss on a beautiful, mystified alien and awakens strange sensations.  Choreographed to Tchaikovsky ballet music, Nicolas’s rescue plan unfolds as a deadpan farce, with each hesitant caress and careful removal of a garment preceded by a polite request, as if the couple were following the rules in a college manual on politically correct dating behavior.  Even after Nicolas develops a live-in relationship with Caline (Frédérique Bel), a flight attendant, the affair continues. Once Judith and Nicolas agree that, yes, they are in love, they decide that they must shed their partners in the most humane way possible.  The solution to everybody’s problems, they conclude, would be for Caline and Claudio to fall in love. Claudio’s passion for the music of Schubert plays a major role in their meet-cute scheme, which of course disastrously misfires.  “Shall We Kiss?” doesn’t pretend that any of these shenanigans are less than preposterous. It has the formality of a modern bedroom farce, without slammed doors or raised voices or people running frantically in and out of closets. Now and again, the movie returns to Gabriel and Émilie, who have come to her hotel room in the early hours of morning.  Will they surrender to a wordless embrace that might or might not change their lives? Or is the story of Nicolas and Judith sufficient warning to keep them at arm’s length? I’m not telling.

Following the utterly charming �Change of Address,� Emmanuel Mouret continues his winning streak with �Shall We Kiss?� another Woody Allen-meets-Eric Rohmer romantic comedy in which the young writer-director again plays the doofus lead. Less fizzy and more philosophical than �Address,� but stillenjoyable in its wry observation of Eros� hits and misses, this is upscale French entertainment at its best, with offshore arthouse sales a given. If not for fests� aversion to comedies in competition, Mouret would already be better known than he is.
Pic starts and ends in Nantes, where, in a typically offhand first scene, Gabriel (Michael Cohen) gives a lift to Emilie (Julie Gayet), who�s down from Paris on business. As the two speak in the car, an attraction forms -- despite the fact each has a partner -- and they end up having a romantic dinner.
However, when it comes to goodnights, Emilie refuses to give Gabriel a farewell kiss. Pourquoi
? Because a single kiss can change your life, she says, however innocently intended. And to prove her point, she tells Gabriel a story, set in Paris, that takes up the rest of the film, with occasional cuts back to Emilie and Gabriel. Underlying the whole film is the final teaser of whether Emilie will agree to a farewell kiss after all.
Emilie�s yarn -- which, she stresses is not her own in disguise -- centers on longtime best friends Nicolas Gimas (Mouret), a teacher, and Judith (Virginie Ledoyen), a lab researcher married to a rich pharmacist, Claudio (Stefano Accorsi). Each regularly confides in the other, and Nicolas confesses he lacks �physical affection� in his relationships with women.
Judith suggests seeing a hooker about the problem, and Nicolas confesses he already saw one (Marie Madinier) earlier in the day; but, as she wouldn�t allow kissing, it was to no effect. Embarrassed, Nicolas asks if Judith herself would help him out; out of friendship, she agrees to give it the old college try.
Beautifully played by Ledoyen and Mouret, this section -- in which they politely remove their clothes to make even more polite love -- is a small comedy-of-manners classic. In line with the whole pic, it gains much from the contrast between Mouret�s typically unadorned direction (simple medium shots and closeups, from fixed positions) and the use of classical bon-bons on the soundtrack (Tchaikovsky ballets, and lots of Schubert chamber music).
Ensuing complications have a quietly loony inevitability typical of Mouret�s films (going back to his first, �Laissons Lucie faire!�), though often spiced with the unexpected. And throughout, there�s the consistent joy of well-modulated dialogue as the pic�s driving force.
As a calmer, less neurotic version of Woody Allen, Mouret himself makes a charming protag, and is generous in giving his co-stars screen time. Dressed down in conservative clothes, Ledoyen plays against type, and makes a neat contrast to Frederique Bal as Nicolas� slightly airheaded girlfriend, Caline. Madinier is good in a brief role as the part-time hooker who refuses to kiss.
Tech package, by the same team as �Address,� is neat and simple.

If they're French, even dweebs get to lounge around tastefully beige Paris interiors, clutching long-stemmed glasses of Merlot while discussing the potential collateral damage of an exploratory kiss on the lips. In Emmanuel Mouret 's comedie d'amour , the writer-director plays a skinny, cow-eyed math teacher who asks his best friend, a skinny, sloe-eyed, and very married scientist, played by Virginie Ledoyen , to kick-start his dormant libido. She agrees with misgivings, the two rationalists fall helplessly in love, and from that moment on, in this more masturbatory than carnal folie , they never shut up. The interesting question buried in all this gassing on about whether we want what's forbidden because it's forbidden and whether it's all worth the bother and who will get hurt, hinges on the battle between desire and—is it ethics or etiquette? I couldn't quite tell. To Mouret's credit, he doesn't dismiss the question as trivial or bourgeois. But despite the tale-within-a-tale structure that spells out what's at stake, the director is so much more reluctant than his fastidious characters to play the moralist, which means that Shall We Kiss?  (a title that implies a different line of inquiry from the more assertive French, Un Baiser s'il vous plait ) bogs down in the philosophical shallow end and never quite recovers from what's clearly meant to be a deceptively light tone.
