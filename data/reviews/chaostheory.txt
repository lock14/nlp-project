Ryan Reynolds's makeover continues. The onetime snarkmaster of rude college farces like "Van Wilder" and "Waiting. . ." is hitting 30, and his smooth spray-on tan is beginning to look unbecoming - the mark of an ageless oddity like George Hamilton rather than a smartly shallow frat-boy hero.
So the powers that be have been casting the actor as a befuddled daddy-type in romantic comedies like "Definitely, Maybe" and "Chaos Theory," 
a new film that's actually been sitting on the shelf for well over a year. "Maybe" was watchable and blandly pleasant; "Theory" is a smidgen better than that, if not the cruelly funny farce the movie's best impulses and its own trailer would have you believe.
After a modern-day opening scene, in which Reynolds is wholly unconvincing as a middle-age father of a bride, "Chaos Theory" flashes back two decades and then forward seven or so years, finally settling into its main narrative about married couple Frank (Reynolds) and Susan (British actress Emily Mortimer, making with a convincing American accent). He's an efficiency expert wound tighter than a tick, she's charming and skeptical, and their banter is pretty sharply honed for a modern multiplex comedy.
Him: "I've got to go, it's 18 after."
Her: " 'Eighteen after' is not a time, it's a symptom, like a twitch."
Him: "You used to think it was adorable."
Her: "I used to pound Jagermeister."
Daniel Taplitz's script natters along like this for a bit, introducing the couple's young daughter Jesse (Matreya Fedor), and then it starts to pull Frank's little world apart with glee. Overnight in the city after giving a motivational speech, he allows himself to be reeled in by a seminar groupie - is there such a thing? - played by Sarah Chalke, and follows that up with an emergency assist to a pregnant mother (Jocelyne Loewen) in need.
Such things are meant to be misunderstood by movie wives, but "Chaos Theory" proceeds to twist the wrench further, until the hero's gears are well and truly stripped and the only recourse is to run across the ice naked at a professional hockey game.
At a certain point in Frank's carefully delineated nervous breakdown, he comes to understand that keeping one's life in order is futile. He embraces whim with the zeal of a born-again convert, making lists of anti-social behaviors then choosing one at blissful random. Reynolds deftly blurs the lines between joy and rage; he's a light comedian playing entertainingly with heavier weights than usual.
There are the pieces of a remarkably bitter and clear-eyed comedy here, something I can imagine Elaine May directing Jack Lemmon in a few movie generations back. Taplitz and director Marcos Siega aren't up to that level. "Chaos Theory" keeps jerking in the direction of melodrama, and finally the cart tips over completely.
A subplot involving Stuart Townsend as Frank's best friend, a cad who has long pined for Susan, trods ever deeper into the slough of seriousness. The film also raises the possibility of bad behavior on the part of the wife before dodging the issue in a way calculated to please the movie's audience while sapping the life out of its characters.
Savor the sharp bits, then, and forget about the cluttered ending, which combines comic attempted homicide with young Fedor behaving as no little girl would under the circumstances. "Chaos Theory" is pretend grown-up fare for moviegoers who've been out of college a decade or so and who are just beginning to freak out about getting older. It's genial enough, but it should be called "My First Mid-Life Crisis Movie."


As most of us know only too well, our lives are ruled by the clock. In Marcos Siega’s “Chaos Theory,” Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds), an uptight author and motivational speaker who teaches people how to utilize each minute efficiently, tries to overcome time’s tyranny by strictly following self-imposed schedules and lists. But the loss of 10 minutes after his wife, Susan (Emily Mortimer), playfully turns the clock back one morning sets off a chain of increasingly absurd events that forces him to reassess his domestic bliss; his caddish best friend, Buddy (Stuart Townsend);  and his approach to life in general. A predictable romantic dramedy that isn’t particularly tender, moving or amusing, “Chaos Theory” suffers first and foremost from featuring the least engaging couple to headline a movie in some time. If the bland Mr. Reynolds and the grating Ms. Mortimer are Hollywood’s idea of the latest in romantic leads, then we’re in trouble. The film is told mostly via flashback, as Frank recounts his woes to his soon-to-be son-in-law, and in its most embarrassing recollection a drunken Susan selects a husband from among her male friends based on their nicknames for their penises. Frank’s — “Truth” — wins out. Too bad there’s actually very little truth to be found in the film. “Chaos Theory” is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned) for slight sexual situations and language.

Ryan Reynolds plays a tightly wound efficiency expert whose marital crisis prompts a turn toward seat-of-his-pants living in �Chaos Theory.� Pic doesn�t take the rich core concept -- which recalls the 1971 cult novel �The Dice Man� -- as far as one might like, indeed largely abandoning it for seriocomic melodrama and sentimentality just when it�s starting to build momentum. Still, the lead performers, the brighter fillips in Daniel Taplitz�s screenplay and Marcos Siega�s (�Pretty Persuasion�) assured direction make this a pleasing item overall. Warner�s platform rollout Stateside is likely to produce just modest results, with better news ahead in ancillary.
Learning that his fiancee had an affair during their brief breakup period has given young Ed (Mike Erwin) a serious case of wedding-day jitters. Catching the groom just as he�s about to bolt, prospective father-in-law Frank Allen (Reynolds) insists he hear the tale of his own speed-bumped but lasting marriage. (Coincidentally, Reynolds� still-in-theaters �Definitely, Maybe� also hinged on a feature-length storytelling flashback.) 
Twenty years earlier, Frank was just one of several college-grad pals smitten with Susan (Emily Mortimer), his closest rival being his brash best friend Buddy (Stuart Townsend). Though shy and insecure, Frank is Susan�s pick when she announces she�ll marry within this circle of friends. 
Eight years later, they�ve got 7-year-old daughter Jesse (Matreya Fedor) and a handsome home. Susan is a schoolteacher, while Frank has become a success on the self-help and corporate lecture circuit. His bestseller, �The Five-Minute Efficiency Trainer,� advises bending a chaotic world to your will by creating practical to-do lists and obeying them to the letter. �Those who can�t control whim are destined to be controlled by it,� he tells a roomful of suits. 
Afterward, aggrieved over a fight with Susan -- who�s tiring of his micromanaging ways -- Frank gets way too tipsy with a bombshell conference attendee  (Sarah Chalke). He flees rather than succumb to her aggressive moves, but then nearly runs over a pregnant woman (Jocelyne Loewen) whom he ends up driving to the hospital himself. The upshot of all this is that Susan comes to believe Frank is not only a philanderer, but also a bigamist and new father.
Subsequently, after a chain of events and revelations, Frank and Susan break up, with Frank feeling he has been entirely wrong about how to live his life. He vows to stop hypercontrolling  and to instead rely on �whim, chance, chaos.� Suddenly he�s riding helmetless on a �bitchin� Harley,� picking barfights, streaking at a hockey game, having extramarital sex and so forth. 
At this point, pic retreats from the giddy comedy of Frank�s newfound freedom, going instead in a more conventional family-reconciliation direction. This works OK on its own terms but arrives a mite too soon, and feels like a bit of a letdown. Still, it�ll satisfy auds who want something reassuringly warm and fuzzy after a reel or two of moderate edginess.
Reynolds is again in sharp form, Townsend providing a likeable foil; Mortimer has a more passive role to work with. Vancouver (pic is set in the Pacific Northwest) looks great in Ramsey Nickell�s widescreen lensing, with production designer Sandy Cochrane�s interiors equally inviting.
A couple of joyous �70s oldies by ELO and Hot Chocolate are perfectly deployed, but the decision to blanket more emotional scenes in newer soft-rock tunes (mostly by Alex Dezen and the Damnwells) is more distracting than enhancing. 



Who could lift the American screen comedy from a vast muck of sniggery boner gags and crap-pop bricolage? I'm pulling for Ryan Reynolds , the stud comic whose gouging inflection and tenuous arrogance have piloted such disarming fare as Just Friends  and Definitely, Maybe . Chaos Theory  finds our man playing an uptight lecture-circuit efficiency expert, reasonably happily married (to Emily Mortimer ) with a kid, when one blip in his immaculate schedule upends him down a steep tumble of coincidence and into the undiscovered world beyond his daily planner. From over-familiar beginnings—a wry bad-boy bachelor best friend whose idea of a good time is (head-slap) to "go to Rascals and play some blackjack"—the plot off-roads into almost free-associative happenstance. Reynolds, called to 180 from anal nebbish to feral beast, is beautifully committed, but he gets no help on the other side of the camera. The actors have to vie for attention with a bum-rushing soundtrack of emotionally instructive, anemic mope music and a director-cinematographer duo that seems more invested in creating outstandingly pretty set-ups that seem like a pitch for commercial work (the lighting is plush, the stained-teak Crate & Barrel interiors just so) rather than serving the scene or condescending to anything so basic as hustling for laffs.
