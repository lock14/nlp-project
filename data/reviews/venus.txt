         Three years ago, Peter O'Toole expressed dismay at receiving an honorary Oscar, saying he was "still in the game." The transporting performance he gives in "Venus" proves that he was not kidding.
 
  Told with wit, genuine poignancy and all kinds of humor, "Venus" (opening Thursday) charts the unlikely relationship between a man in his 70s and a young woman more than half a century his junior. This is a relationship unlike any we've seen, and it's a measure of the film's subtle gifts that it is easier to watch it unfolding than to precisely define what we're seeing.
 


         






    For though it looks to be about things fleeting and ephemeral, "Venus" touches, without forcing anything, on what matters most in life: love, friendship, connection. It's about aging and what keeps you alive, about the getting and passing on of the wisdom of a lifetime. And it is done with such surpassing skill on both sides of the camera that we can't help but marvel at it all.
 
  It starts with the work of two of Britain's most adroit film professionals, screenwriter Hanif Kureishi and collaborator-director Roger Michell. Kureishi, whose credits include "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "My Son the Fanatic," has come up with a smartly written script that excels in character-based dialogue so tart it is as much fun to read on the page as it is to see performed. And director Michell — previously responsible for "Notting Hill" as well as "Persuasion," the best of the Jane Austen adaptations — knows how to produce exactly calibrated line readings that get all the juice out of deliciously offbeat lines like: "Oh, just kill them, kill the young, exterminate their disgusting happiness and hope."
 
  The main attraction on screen, obviously, is the seven-time Oscar-nominated O'Toole, who at 74 uses a lifetime of talent, craft and simply living to turn the part of an aging actor who forms a connection with a young woman into a master class of lovely and seemingly effortless screen acting.
 
  Equally impressive though easier to overlook is the work of Jodie Whittaker, who graduated from London's Guildhall School of Music & Drama just a year ago. She brings a deft ability to play all the at-times contradictory aspects of a constantly changing character that the film would be lost without.
 
  It's O'Toole's character, Maurice Russell, a London-based actor who considers himself "a little" famous, we meet first, and it is something of a shock. Given our collective memory of the O'Toole of "Lawrence of Arabia," it is wrenching to see Maurice sitting on his bed, rumpled and fragile and without the will to get up until he slaps himself hard and says, "Come on, old man."
 
  But though Maurice is having trouble with his prostate and is reduced to playing dead people on TV ("typecasting," jokes his ex-wife Valerie, an incandescent Vanessa Redgrave), he is still very much of a charmer, someone with a face that loves the limelight and eyes that retain a bright rakish light.
 
  Maurice is in the habit of spending time with fellow codger Ian (Leslie Phillips), comparing pills and trading sharp cracks. Then his friend announces that his grandniece is coming to London from the north to help look after him. Or so he thinks.
 
  For Jessie (Whittaker) turns out to be no one's idea of a caregiver, least of all her own. Surly, self-centered and willful, a prodigious drinker with a coarse tongue, she is the type that soon makes Ian "scream for euthanasia." However, Maurice, who considers himself "a scientist of the female heart," is intrigued.
 
  It is a given that Maurice and Jessie, who he soon dubs "Venus," are going to get along better than either one of them anticipates, but almost nothing else about their relationship goes the way either they or audiences can anticipate.
 
  For one thing, Maurice is too old to have anything more than what he calls "a theoretical interest" in the opposite sex, but that theoretical interest takes some potent turns. Also, neither one of this pair is a noticeably sweet person, and that shared prickliness and the bite of Kureishi's writing keep things from getting anywhere close to maudlin or sentimental.
 
  Finally, it becomes evident that what motivates Maurice is not lechery but a kind of yearning envy of Jessie's youth and a longing for his own. Both Maurice and Jessie are, to borrow a phrase from the script, "in the habit of putting their own pleasure first," and to see them first clash and then go beyond their difficulties is, frankly, a marvel.

 Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, the director and screenwriter of “Venus,” are both in their early 50s and, as far as I know, young in mind, body and spirit. Nonetheless in this film and their last collaboration, “The Mother,” they unblinkingly examine the effects of old age. Not coincidentally they provide their leading actors — Anne Reid in “The Mother,” Peter O’Toole in “Venus” — with rare opportunities to show how complicated, how impetuous, how alive older people can be.  Ms. Reid, playing a widow with time on her hands and sex on her mind, memorably pursued a steamy affair with Daniel Craig before he was James Bond. In Mr. O’Toole’s case matters are kept to a quiet simmer. He plays Maurice, an elderly actor — not much of a stretch for him, perhaps, but an unalloyed delight for the audience — who takes a partly avuncular, partly lecherous interest in the grandniece of one of his pals. Jesse, played by Jodie Whittaker, has come to London to care for her  great-uncle Ian (Leslie Phillips) and also, she rather idly hopes, to break into modeling.  Her prospects do not look terribly promising in either field. Ian, who dreams of home-cooked meals and friendly companionship, is horrified by the rude, slovenly creature with whom he shares his dim, cozy apartment. Maurice, less timorous and more ironical than his friend, may feel the same way when he sees her lounging in her velour track suit, stuffing her face with junk food, but his approach is different. He sees her the way he sees everyone else: as a target for his charm, an audience to be seduced, a mirror for his egoism.  Their unlikely, uneven friendship provides the movie with a thin, wobbly dramatic peg, but it turns out to be just enough for Mr. O’Toole to show the younger guys out there — the Leos and the Brads and, for that matter, the Daniel Craigs — how the thing is done properly. A lean, stiffening frame, a voice roughened by decades of cigarettes and decent whiskey (or whatever kind is available), a slackening face and bright, twinkling eyes:  such is the instrument he has to work with, and he tosses off a perfect sonata.  Mr. O’Toole’s effortless precision puts Ms. Whittaker, making her film debut, at a bit of a disadvantage, as does the script’s somewhat blurry conception of her character. The point may be that Jessie is unformed, especially in comparison with Maurice, who has had a lifetime to rehearse and refine the great role of himself. But some of her caprices seem to be less the result of her own volatile, unpredictable temperament than of the narrative requirement that she serve as a foil. Her mood swings are sometimes too neatly arrayed in counterpoint to Maurice’s emotions, as she answers his tenderness with cruelty and his vulnerability with warmth.    Since the movie is about desire — not so much for sex as for the vitality and surprise that sex can provide — it is also about power. Few writers can match Mr. Kureishi’s knowing wit on this subject, or his skill at dissecting the shifting dynamics of longing and domination. Maurice’s attention to Jessie, which he describes as “kindness,” does not at first seem indecent or self-interested; he sees it not as an imposition but as a gift. He is, after all, a famous, distinguished fellow, and he brings an element of pedagogy — of Henry Higgins tutoring Eliza Doolittle — to his relations with this uncultured  girl.  For her part Jessie, though she may be ignorant, is far from stupid, and she is quick to react to Maurice’s condescension, and also to perceive her own advantages. At times the contrasts between them are too obvious and emphatic, but the story’s schematic aspects are nicely undercut by the film’s quiet, appreciative attention to its setting. Mr. Kureishi and Mr. Michell both love London and know it well, and one of the best qualities of “Venus” is its lived-in feeling.  The filmmakers also make canny use of Mr. O’Toole’s celebrity, though Maurice is probably a few degrees less famous than the man who plays him. At St. Paul’s in Covent Garden (a k a the Actors’ Church),  Ian and Maurice pause to read the names of the real thespian dead, whose ranks they will soon join. Vanessa Redgrave appears in a few scenes (too few for my taste) as Maurice’s fond, resigned ex-wife.  As “Venus” moves casually along, a deep sadness starts to gather around its edges, casting a shadow over the mischievous good humor that is Maurice’s default mood. His mortality portends a larger loss, the eclipse of an approach to life and art that the great British actors of the mid-20th century, from Laurence Olivier to Michael Caine, embodied with such ease and charisma. It is not easy to define that special, paradoxical glamour  Mr. O’Toole wears like a well-worn, perfectly tailored jacket — he is a self-made aristocrat, a genuine pretender, a selfless narcissist — but whatever it is, he still has it. Seeing a picture of the young Maurice — the young Peter O’Toole — in a newspaper, someone exclaims, “He were gorgeous.” Indeed he were, and so he is.  “Venus” is rated R (Under 17 requires an  accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual situations, language and references.
Maurice Russell , a septuagenarian actor facing the end of his career and life, gazes raptly at the present that fate has given him: the company of a sullen but strangely desirable teenage girl. At first, his appraising looks give her the creeps, but something about his courtliness piques her curiositynot to mention her vanity. This is a man who says something about comparing her to a summer's day. She is intrigued to learn that during his most recent hospital stay, he passed the time thinking about her body. Which parts, she asks? "Your hair," Maurice murmurs, "your legs, your behind, your eyes . . . your elbows." Then he adds, in a succulent near-sigh of erotic nostalgia, " . . . your cunt ."
That distant pbbbtt!  sound you hear is a collective Starbucks  spit-take, courtesy of a thousand Academy voters watching their "for your consideration" screeners of Venus . In most regards, this funeral wreath of a film about a dying thespian in lust-struck twilight is made-to-order Oscar bait: a gift-wrapped vehicle for a screen legend, full of reverential nods to the craft, with reminders of the star's mortality delivered over loudspeakers from a running hearse. What keeps Venus  from sinking ass-deep in Golden Pond is its sexual reverieand a star who couldn't play a cutely neutered grumpy old man if commanded by God.
Peter O'Toole  has never been an actor to disappear into a part, any more than his blue-eyed devil Lawrence  could blend into the sands of Arabia. Nor would you want him to: O'Toole was born to sweep a role around him like a matador's cape, transforming it by virtue of sheer heroic panache. Maurice, the protagonist of Venus , is a suit lovingly tailored to O'Toole's ravaged but commanding frame.
Apart from in the operating theater, Maurice's command performances are done; he's shown on a TV soap playing the part most available to actors his agea corpse. ("Typecast again!" cackles his estranged wife, played by a cheerily disheveled Vanessa Redgrave .) His life is a round of prostate exams and sitcom-like coffee dates with his crotchety fellow player Ian (Leslie Phillips ). One day he meets Ian's teenage relative Jessie (Jodie Whittaker )and something about the girl's insolent youth (and the careless peek of midriff between her sweater and jeans) sets Maurice's pulse racing.
The screenwriter, Hanif Kureishi , made his name with disruptive sex-as-weaponry comedies such as My Beautiful Laundrette  and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid . His script for Venus  appears early on to be riffing on Lolita another story about an older man and his unsuitable, inscrutable object of desire. Humbert's gauche Lolita popped gum; Maurice's Venus sucks salt off her fingers from a packet of crisps while he watches, entranced. But Maurice can see his foolishness clearly, even fondly. It's a last hurrah. Acutely aware of his lost potency and waning health, he hasn't got a lust for life; he's got a lust for lust. "I can still take a theoretical interest," he tells Jessie, a Sporty Spice Eve who's first seen reaching for an appleand later, ominously, sports a snake tattoo.
As Maurice negotiates little prizes of intimacy from the brusque, tarty girlthe stroke of a hand, three kisses on a deliciously bare shoulderO'Toole manages a delicate balancing act, neither coming off as a perv nor erasing the character's frank sexual longing. Without Maurice's "theoretical" libido (and Kureishi's profane wit), Venus might've been a puddle of maudlin goo. Movies that trade heavily on our lifelong associations with a star can quickly become clammy exercises in celebrity genuflection. As delightful as it is to watch O'Toole summon from his entire career the sensualist's leer he uncurled in 1980's The Stunt Man , the matinee-idol braggadocio he wielded so irresistibly in 1982's My Favorite Year there's occasionally the sense of director Roger Michell  tugging at our sleeves, gushing, "Isn't he wonderful ?"
It's hard to blame him, thoughin part because O'Toole brings an air of gentle self-mockery to the role that offsets the morbid, if candid, emphasis on his frailty. Maurice is a part that encourages and mocks an actor's narcissism in equal measure. Even wearing a leaky catheter, he's as idealized a figure as the theater folk in All About Eve people whose wits are keener than everyone else's, whose passions are grander, whose tongues are never at a loss for acid rejoinders.
When Maurice and Ian duck into an abbey filled with the remains of their late colleaguesRobert Shaw , Laurence Harvey , Richard Beckinsaleit's almost impossible to look at the haggard O'Toole, now 74, and not worry about how little time we have left in his company, even if you resent the movie for making the point so insistently. And yet the star's own ragged glory rebuffs any impulse to send flowers. "Come on, old man!" Maurice growls, slapping himself in the face to rouse what spirit he has left.
