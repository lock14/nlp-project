Blindness
 opened Cannes this year, and it didn�t do well there. The print included a supposedly disastrous voiceover by Glover (since stripped from the final cut), and it was perhaps undone by expectations that it might be a different kind of movie � a Big Idea kind of movie. It�s an adaptation of the 1995 novel by Nobel Prize winner Jos� Saramago, and at first blush it seems to fall into the same mold as Children of Men
: a serious film that uses the sci-fi premise of a near-future dystopia to comment on the modern-day dystopia already upon us. But the trouble with expectations is that they tend to numb one to what�s really at hand. Blindness
, the film, pushes the Big Ideas aside for a brutalizing exploration into the hard fact that humans, in the right circumstances, will turn desperate and even barbarous. The catalyst is an outbreak of blindness in a city that is intentionally vague, its citizens casually multinational (as is its terrific cast, which does a lot within the restrictions of limited screen time). Ruffalo plays an ophthalmologist who unknowingly spreads the infectious disease from its first case to a waiting room full of patients and on to concentric circles of panicky outbreak. None of the characters are named; they are listed in the credits, as in the source novel, with identifiers such as the Doctor and the Doctor�s Wife. The latter (played by Moore) is introduced whipping into submission a tiramisu for her distracted husband. When he wakes in the morning with the �white sickness� (the blindness is unique in that the infected see white, rather than black), she makes a rash decision to feign blindness, too, in order to join him in the government-issued quarantine. (One senses the decision was borne as much from helplessness as self-sacrifice.) The sick are shipped off to an abandoned insane asylum and more or less left to fend for themselves (impossible to watch without thinking of the Superdome), and there the secretly sighted Doctor�s Wife becomes witness to unending awfulness as conditions deteriorate and a turf war ensues. We become witness, too, and it�s a long, hard slough: Meireilles � no stranger to harsh climes, having previously touched down in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro (City of God
) and a Kenya ravaged by disease and Big Pharma (The Constant Gardener
) � unflinchingly charts every slipped rung down to the bottomest depths of human degradation. Frequent cuts to white screen aside, there is very little lightness here. Meireilles plays on that whiteness, in one instance using it to soft-shoe a morally complicated sex scene, then abruptly cutting to full-color to expose it for what it really is, which is the desperate rutting of the doomed. There are no pulled punches here, and within that same morally complicated universe, Meireilles and screenwriter Don McKellar (who co-stars) demonstrate a scope and a sensibility expansive enough to meet every devil with some sympathy and every joy with commensurate sorrow. All this, I think, would be unbearable without Moore, who masterfully characterizes the devoted wife�s metamorphosis into a heroicism both unwanted and unheralded. It�s a rattling, heartrending performance in, yes, a long, hard slough of a film � one that is well worth the journey, if not a repeat trip.


Julianne Moore is a star for these terrible times. She tends to be at her best when the world is at its worst. And things are pretty bad in "Blindness," a perversely enjoyable, occasionally harrowing adaptation of Jos� Saramago's 1995 disaster allegory.
A mysterious epidemic called the white sickness has left an entire city sightless, except her. But to remain with her optometrist husband (Mark Ruffalo) after the government quarantines the afflicted in an asylum, Moore pretends to be blind. The couple winds up in a clan alongside Ruffalo's patients, played by Danny Glover, Yusuke Iseya, Alice Braga, Mitchell Nye, and Yoshino Kimura.
The early scenes of them all falling over one another and feeling their way along corridor walls suggests a particularly apocalyptic drama-class exercise: OK, now you're blind zombies. Don McKellar's screenplay holds onto a few of Saramago's other devices that should keep it from working. We don't know what city this is (it looks like Tokyo, Montreal, Sao Paolo, and Los Angeles combined into one), and the characters do not have names.
But the lack of specificity and the comic pantomime start to matter less when the movie's ideas begin to assert themselves. The asylum inmates are broken into wards, one of which controls the distribution of provisions. It's run by Gael Garcia Bernal and the Falstaffian Maury Chaykin, who make a perfectly reprehensible pair, first demanding jewelry for food, then sex.
For the first half hour, as all hell only threatens to break loose, the people we meet are designer characters with expensive clothes and chic apartments; even Alice Braga's hooker is untouchably cool. I worried that the director Fernando Meirelles was creating another of his glamorous nightmares, like "City of God" and "The Constant Gardener." But "Blindness" corrals its bourgeois characters into slummy conditions not to improve their humanity, but to test it. Does pride matter in poverty and starvation and degrading terror? There's nothing left for even Meirelles to glamorize.
This is not to say that his filmmaking doesn't reach an arrestingly grim peak, particularly before, during, and after the women in Moore's ward hold hands and walk toward the men who've promised them food for their bodies. These sequences are dark and chaotic in a way that makes it impossible for anyone (us or the characters) to come out of the dreadfulness unscathed.
The chaos Meirelles conjures is indeed living-dead movie stuff, but the desperation is still shockingly real. So, for that matter, is the sanitation problem. The production designer Tule Peak and his crew have done a marvelous job, giving us a stupefyingly trashed city, as if the disaster were actually a garbage bomb.
"Blindness" is a movie whose sense of crisis feels right on time, even if the happy ending feels like a gratuitous emotional bailout. Meirelles ensures that the obviousness of the symbolism (in the global village the blind need guidance!) doesn't negate the story's power, nor the power of Moore's performance. The more dehumanizing things get, the fiercer she becomes.
In another sort of movie, this would be a job for Sigourney Weaver, but Moore is just as fearsome. Actually, with that pellucid skin and those innumerable freckles, the actor reminded me of Isabelle Huppert, who also supervised post-apocalyptic survival in director Michael Haneke's sadly underseen parable "Time of the Wolf."
Could these two have been separated at birth, with Moore opting for melodramatic anxiety and Huppert for improbable serenity? The sightless folks in "Blindness" have an imperious captain in Julianne Moore. When someone calls her a leader with vision, it's a hokey joke, and yet nobody's kidding.


Blindness , a drama about an epidemic of sightlessness that reduces the afflicted to their primal worst and best, is up to its eyeballs in visual affectation. Ironic, no? And here's what is even more cockeyed: Though it's directed with a fondness for stylized blur, shadow, and bleached imagery by Fernando Meirelles, who gave slums a hip-hop gloss in City of God , this self-consciously moody adaptation is based on a 1995 novel by the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner José Saramago that's the opposite of gussied up. On the page, in fact, Saramago's compelling parable spills out in an urgent rush of unadorned language.
I suspect the culprit is a case of middlebrow glaucoma  a condition of glazed cloudiness that sometimes affects movies chasing the prestige of admired literature. But whatever the diagnosis, the ailment takes a toll on an honorable cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Danny Glover, and Gael García Bernal among the squabbling, unseeing crowd, and Julianne Moore as the one sighted witness; she feigns blindness to be with her husband (Ruffalo) when he’s quarantined. As the players enact the fall and rebirth of civilization, Meirelles suggests that even a society gone to hell looks better with a little music-video-like pizzazz.

 In “Blindness,” Fernando Meirelles’s adaptation of the novel by the Nobel laureate José Saramago, human civilization is threatened by a sudden and virulent outbreak of metaphor. As people go about their daily lives in an unidentified city (a brilliantly shot, digitally tweaked composite of Toronto, Tokyo and São Paulo), they begin, one by one, to lose their sight. No organic cause can be found for this condition, which manifests itself not as a descent into darkness but as a whiteout, as if the world had become a blank page, an empty screen or a puddle of milk.  Panic ensues, and the government quarantines the afflicted in an unused sanitarium, where they act out a pageant revealing the deep and ugly truths of human nature for the benefit of an audience encouraged to wonder What It All Means. We notice, first of all, the failures of compassion that greet the initial outbreak, and then, once the blind are sequestered, the decline of their makeshift society into a primordial condition of tribal war. We see decency, reason and fellow feeling challenged by stronger impulses toward domination and selfishness, and observe how goodness can triumph by means of violence and deceit.  That none of this is meant to be taken literally is signaled by an ambient fuzziness familiar to anyone who has dabbled, as reader or writer, in the cloudy waters of literary allegory. “Blindness” concentrates on a small group of people, each with a thematic identity and a clear narrative function, not one with a name. When they stumble into the quarantine ward, these characters introduce themselves by number, according to order of arrival, and by profession, evidence that they have been stripped of their humanity not by sickness or the state, but rather by Mr. Saramago and by Don McKellar, the screenwriter.  The main group, most of whom we have encountered at least briefly before their incarceration, includes an ophthalmologist and his wife (Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore); a prostitute (Alice Braga); a thief (Mr. McKellar); a mysterious old man (Danny Glover); a child (Mitchell Nye);  and a Japanese yuppie couple (Yusuke Iseya and Yoshino Kimura).  Their rivals, quartered in another ward, are led by a bartender (Gael García Bernal), who turns himself into a cruel, capricious monarch and whose rise to power is aided by a lieutenant (Maury Chaykin) with the advantage of having been blind all his life.  The ophthalmologist’s wife, meanwhile, has retained her sight (and stayed loyally at her husband’s side), which gives her tattered clan a bit of an edge in the struggle for domination and survival that occupies the film’s long middle section. Her condition also makes her a surrogate for the audience and the crucial ingredient in the film’s murky thematic stew. We wonder why she alone was spared. Is it because she was nice to her husband when he went blind? We also wonder whether, or how, her apparently limitless patience and pity will withstand the challenge of caring for a filthy and terrified accidental family.  In its original incarnation as a novel, “Blindness” belongs with those other important 20th-century allegories that use an imagined communal disaster as the laboratory for a moral thought experiment. Other notable examples, drawn from the charmed circle of Nobel Prize winners, might include “The Plague” by Albert Camus and William Golding’s “Lord of the Flies.” Mr. Saramago’s book, lacking the dark simplicity of Camus’s fable, is more likely to join Mr. Golding’s well-worn novel as term paper fodder for high school English classes.  An interesting transmutation sometimes occurs when the pedagogical machinery of this kind of book is brought to the screen. According to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “an allegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture-language, which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses.”  This criticism applies perfectly well to Mr. Saramago’s novel, but Coleridge was writing almost a century before the movies brought this process full circle, restoring to these abstractions a degree of sensual immediacy he could never have foreseen.  In other words, the characters in Mr. Meirelles’s film may be ciphers, as they are in the mechanical universe of Mr. Saramago’s novel, but they are also Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Alice Braga and the rest of those names listed in parentheses above. And this simple fact makes a big difference. Mr. Saramago’s lofty, ideologically defended humanism has no place for actual human beings, but actors of this caliber don’t know how to be anything else. Ms. Moore’s pale, fine-boned face is too precise and delicate an instrument to obey the rather simplistic directives of the story, and the rest of the cast shares her inability to sacrifice physical or psychological nuance in the service of vague ideas.  Mr. Meirelles (a Brazilian filmmaker whose previous features include “City of God” and “The Constant Gardener”) sometimes seems overly enamored of arresting images, manipulating light, color and composition at the expense of emotional or narrative clarity. Here he revels in the paradox of trying to use a visual medium to convey the experience of sightlessness and excels at showing what the world of the blind might look like. And he is not above exploiting both the comical and the horrific aspects of their condition, punctuating scenes of cruelty and dread with moments of grimly funny slapstick.  “Blindness” is not a great film, mainly because it can’t transcend — and, indeed, lays bare — the intellectual flimsiness of its source. But it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like. For all its chin-rubbing, brow-furrowing attitudes, it does not, in the end, give you much to think about. But there is, nonetheless, a lot here to see.  “Blindness” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of sex, violence and nudity.

The personal and mass chaos that would result if the human race lost its sense of vision is conveyed with diminished impact and an excess of stylish tics in "Blindness," an intermittently harrowing but diluted take on Jose Saramago's shattering novel. Despite a characteristically strong performance by Julianne Moore as a lone figure who retains her eyesight, bearing sad but heroic witness to the horrors around her, Fernando Meirelles' slickly crafted drama rarely achieves the visceral force, tragic scope and human resonance of Saramago's prose. Despite marquee names, mixed reviews might yield fewer eyes than desired for this international co-production.
Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1998, long resisted the idea of having his 1995 masterwork adapted for the bigscreen. Meirelles has proven the Portuguese writer's instincts to be sadly correct. A horror tale, a bleak allegory and a chronicle of human suffering as consoling as it is devastating, "Blindness" emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated, scrupulously hitting the novel's beats yet barely approximating, so to speak, its vision.
A deliberately unspecified but primarily English-speaking city is experiencing an outbreak of what becomes known as the "white sickness," causing stricken individuals to lose their eyesight, seeing nothing but white rather than darkness. First to succumb is a driver (Yusuke Iseya) who suddenly goes blind behind the wheel; his condition also afflicts his wife (Yoshino Kimura), the doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who examines him and several other patients at the latter's office, just for starters.
The only one who proves inexplicably immune to the rapidly spreading contagion is the doctor's wife (Moore), who conceals this fact so as to accompany her husband to the abandoned mental asylum where the blind are placed under government quarantine. As the wards become crowded with internees, guarded by soldiers ready to fire at anyone who tries to escape, "Blindness" paints a despairing picture of humanity under siege.
Yet where the novel derived its power from a gradual, painstakingly detailed account of deteriorating conditions inside the prison, Meirelles resorts to visual shorthand and montage. In a manner more expedient than plausible, food grows scarce, the corridors become strewn with human waste and a violent faction, led by one gun-toting refugee (played by Gael Garcia Bernal), begins demanding payment of the most humiliating kind from the female internees. Tastefully shot and staged, the rape scene disturbs but also exemplifies the film's willingness to flinch from a work that, on the page, is utterly unflinching.
Burdened with the ability to see the world going blind and mad around her, the doctor's wife, acting as a stand-in for the audience, takes violent, decisive action that triggers a breakout from the asylum. Moore gets ample opportunity to show both unrestrained tears and clenched resolve as the woman who bravely leads a small group to freedom, including her husband, the first blind man and his wife, a beautiful young woman (Meirelles vet Alice Braga) and an old man (Danny Glover). Latter also provides incessant voiceover narration that, accompanied by the intrusive, dirge-like wailing of the score, tries in vain to fill in for the philosophical asides, wry humor and gorgeous epiphanies of Saramago's voice.
Foregoing the vibrant, furiously overheated visual style he brought to "City of God" and "The Constant Gardener" (the editing, by "City of God's" Daniel Rezende, is noticeably less frenzied), Meirelles adopts a cooler but, in its own way, no less fussy aesthetic. He often floods the screen in luminous white to mimic the sensation of blindness, at other times bathing his characters in the stuff so they appear to be, in one's words, "swimming in milk." This deliberately artificial effect gives the film a stagy, self-conscious air, a feeling only heightened by the book-inspired conceit of not giving the characters names.
Tule Peake's production design impresses with the transformation of the sterile mental ward to squalid ninth circle of hell, and Meirelles' vision of the outside world, littered with rubbish as extras stagger blindly about, is no less convincing. Pic was lensed in Ontario, Brazil and Uruguay, and appropriately enough, the city in which it's set looks both vaguely familiar and effectively otherworldly.

The most recent example of bleak chic, Fernando Meirelles 's mostly harrowing adaptation of José Saramago 's international bestseller Blindness  mixes the high-velocity pace and stylishness of the Brazilian director's breakout City of God  with the Portuguese author's thinly metaphysical horror thriller. Unflinching at best and treacly at worst, the film unveils its apocalyptic scenario with visceral intensity, but lacks the emotional sophistication to rise above schadenfreude  kicks.
Set in a gray and metallic modern metropolis (actually São Paolo , later mixed in with Montevideo ), the film—like the novel—opens with a man (Yusuke Iseya ) in a car stopped at a traffic light who suddenly loses his vision. Another man (screenwriter Don McKellar ), who drives him home and later steals his car, also falls prey to the mysterious "white blindness," as does the first victim's doctor (Mark Ruffalo ). Soon, the entire human population finds itself engulfed in a milky sightlessness save, inexplicably, one: the doctor's wife (Julianne Moore ).
Meirelles, working with his Brazilian cinematographer, César Charlone , establishes the plague's outbreak with visual flair, evoking the experience of the ivory blindness through blurry and brightly overexposed frames. The images are dreamily beautiful and attempt to give the viewer a palpable sense of the protagonists' plight (which the novel evokes with its lack of punctuation and stream-of-consciousness prose). But the film doesn't spend much time or attention probing the actual terror of the affliction or the cruel randomness with which it strikes. Curiously, it's not the all-encompassing whiteout that freaks out the characters so much as the conflicts that arise between them.
Like Saramago, Meirelles doesn't care about the medical or psychological specifics of blindness, nor is he interested in the fate of any one human, but rather humanity as a whole. (There's obviously a grand metaphor here—people are "blind"—but it's pretty simplistic.) Moore's sole seer may be the most fleshed-out, but like the city in which they live, none of the characters have names (or backstories).
The allegory works occasionally, as in the film's artful attention to naked bodies of all shapes, sizes, and ages. On the other hand, when the six or so characters we've met before—representing a convenient array of varying races and backgrounds—all coincidentally show up in the same hospital room in the same large detention center, the theatrical setup awkwardly recalls any number of Twilight Zone  episodes.
However, as the quarantine facility overcrowds with more bodies, waste, and detritus, Blindness  finds its compelling way. Muck and madness takes over. Yes, Hell is  other people, especially when trapped in a rundown mental hospital that looks like Titicut Follies 's Bridgewater. The tension ratchets up another notch when a wild-eyed Gael García Bernal  arrives as a self-christened "King" and takes control of the hospital's food supply. When he and his gang eventually demand women in exchange for sustenance, the film reaches its apex of moral degradation and misanthropy.
From there, it's all downhill. In the meandering third act, cleansing rains and precious resolutions wash away most of the trauma—this is a Miramax  movie, after all. Even Children of Men , 2006's exhilarating, similarly apocalyptic adventure, had a hopeful ending. For more trenchant Armageddon, there's Michael Haneke 's Time of the Wolf ; for more tongue-in-cheek, there's Blindness  scribe Don McKellar's directorial debut, Last Night ; adding to the pile-up, John Hillcoat 's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy 's post-apocalyptic The Road  comes out in November. We just can't get enough of this stuff.
Panned in Cannes , Blindness  has since lost a reportedly ponderous voiceover spoken by Danny Glover , who appears as a sagely old man with a none-too-subtle eye-patch—undoubtedly a wise move. Blindness  is strongest when it's not trying to say anything, but instead conveying the sheer desperation of its characters. Whether we're watching Moore (excellent here in primal mode) commit an act of bloodthirsty vengeance with a pair of scissors or escape a horde of starving humans who can smell her stash of food, Meirelles's Blindness  pulls the viewer into its nightmarish vision and dares us to watch how mankind—on the level of both governments and individuals—fails to cope in times of chaos. And considering the current headlines, maybe that's insightful enough.
