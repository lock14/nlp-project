The setting of The Band's Visit  is a charmless Israeli desert town realistically assessed by a local café operator as offering ''no Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all.'' Yet the breeze in the air smells distinctly Scandinavian, so droll is the observational wit and compositional eye of writer-director Eran Kolirin in his thoughtful charmer. His musical troupe is an Egyptian police band, booked for a gig at an Arab cultural center, who arrive by bus at the wrong Israeli town. Bored by the daily nothingness around her, the café lady, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz, the sexy-tough star of Late Marriage ), offers overnight lodging to the stranded musicians  some at her place, others with none-too-eager neighbors. Dina would surely appreciate the irony that the movie  a superb chamber piece in Hebrew, Arabic, and halting English about communication  is another outstanding specimen of world cinema disqualified for Best Foreign Language Oscar consideration. (Cockeyed Academy rabbis and imams calculated that more than half the dialogue is in English  an Academy Tower of Babel taboo.)
Never mind. The night is long, the town is quiet, the band leader (marvelous Sasson Gabai) is prim, and Arab-Israeli distrust isn't erased overnight. But something marvelous happens as the filmmaker, in his first feature, expertly metes out small scenes of communication between people taught, for generations, to be wary of one another: This Band  swings with the rhythms of hope.

 Correction Appended  Stranded in the Israeli desert, the eight Egyptian members of the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra look a bit like a joke in search of a punch line. If “The Band’s Visit” were any other kind of film — a little more pat, say, and rather less knowing — these eight souls might quickly transform into mere props in a small-scale sermon about Middle East man’s humanity  to Middle East man, minus the politics of course.  “The Band’s Visit,” the first feature by the Israeli writer and director Eran Kolirin, flirts recklessly with obviousness, cuteness too. This sweet-and-sour comedy opens with the band, which has traveled to Israel to perform at an Arab cultural center, arriving at an airport without a welcoming committee. Dressed in nearly identical uniforms and smart caps, their nut-brown skin working a vivid, chromatic contrast with the robin’s-egg blue of their costumes, the men enter the film in silence, immobilized by professional reserve or perhaps just bewilderment. For the orchestra’s unsmiling leader, Tewfiq — the magnificently sober Sasson Gabai — the initial lack of a welcome will prove to be only the first bump on an increasingly rough and rutted road.  A few phone calls and one bus ride later, the band has arrived in an Israeli town, the wrong Israeli town, having successfully journeyed from forgotten to mislaid. There, amid the dust and the wind, the Egyptians meet a handful of curious (and agonizingly bored) Israelis who, with degrees of easy and grudging hospitality, offer them shelter, food, distraction, engagement, a few nips of booze, some shaky turns around a roller-skating rink and curious, fleeting companionship. Amid the awkward conversations (spoken in lightly halting and fluid English), the even more uncomfortable silences, bits of music and some nicely executed physical comedy, the Egyptians and the Israelis circle one another warily. Love doesn’t exactly bloom in this desert, but a sense of unarticulated longing does.  There’s something gently comical about the contrast between the Egyptians’ gravely masculine faces and the prettiness of those blue costumes, especially when they’re lined up like French schoolgirls (or ducklings). Mr. Kolirin wrings even more visual humor from this contrast by placing the men in the center of the image and ensuring that they don’t move for several beats, which locates them in spatial and existential isolation. It’s a facile, familiar movie trick, and Mr. Kolirin comes close to wearing it out before the band even leaves the airport, largely because massing the men in this fashion threatens to diminish their individuality. But it’s a clever stratagem  too, because the comedy eases you into the story and obscures the currents of seriousness swirling under the film’s surface.  Mr. Kolirin, it emerges, is wrenching comedy out of intense melancholia. Much of that melancholy involves Tewfiq; the band’s roguish violinist, Haled (Saleh Bakri, smooth as glass); and an Israeli restaurant owner, Dina (the great Ronit Elkabetz), a brusque, untamed beauty who offers the two  shelter. (The other band members bed down elsewhere.) Over the course of a long, peripatetic evening, these three will unite and separate, fumble and parry. Finally they will reunite in Dina’s apartment, where, as they sit wearily around a table, Mr. Kolirin will cut from one face to the next in tight close-up. Despite their tentative, sometimes tender exchanges, the three remain essentially alone, an isolation underscored by the shallow depth of field that leaves only their faces in poignant focus.  The terminal loneliness that haunts this scene may be universal, but Mr. Kolirin also seems to be saying that a specific loneliness haunts Israel as well. At one point Dina blurts out to Tewfiq that she and her family used to love watching Egyptian movies on television. The streets of Israel, she says, her voice swelling, were empty because everyone else was watching too. But that was then, and now Dina and the rest of these Israeli townspeople sit in this seemingly barren land with its pregnant silences and wait. Surrounded by desert, a few longingly invoke the sea, summoning a desire, but for what? Mr. Kolirin, I think, suggests that this longing is for something the poet Marcia Falk calls the “Eternal wellspring of peace.”  “The Band’s Visit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some adult language.

An Egyptian band gets stranded in a nowhere Israeli desert town in "The Band's Visit," a warm and delightful take on cross-cultural relations that proves that sometimes a light touch is just what's needed to address serious topics. Novice helmer Eran Kolirin has a playful eye for compositions and a fine touch with thespers, occasionally playing on the borders of cute but reining in before going to the wrong side of sentiment. An audience charmer that's sure to sweep Israel -- and Egypt too if allowed to open -- offshore arms will be more than welcoming.
When their hosts fail to turn up at the airport, the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Band take a bus to the town they're supposed to be playing. Not only isn't it much of a place, it's also not their place, but the last bus has gone and they don't know where they're supposed to go. To quell grumblings already afoot among members, conductor Tawfiq (Sasson Gabai) hesitantly accepts a suggestion from cafe manager Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) to stay the night.
Tawfiq and handsome ladies' man Khaled (Saleh Bakri) bunk together at Dina's. She's not the kind of woman Tawfiq is used to: wry, with an outward, playful self-confidence and undisguised sexuality. The awkward, melancholy band leader reluctantly accepts Dina's invitation to dinner, where her needy flirtation and his gentlemanly sadness form a bridge of understanding.
Meanwhile, Khaled tags on to the socially awkward Papi (Shlomi Avraham) for a night at a roller disco, culminating in a hilarious lesson on how to treat women. Other band members, headed by second-in-command Simon (Khalifa Natour), stay with Itzik (Rubi Moscovich), leading to tensions with his family and revelations about fulfillment. Balanced by a very funny rendition around the dinner table of "Summertime," these scenes have something profound to say, but never feel heavy-handed.
By pic's end it's not just that the Israelis and Egyptians have learned something about each other, they've learned something about themselves. Mastering these lessons without becoming artificially rosy-eyed would defeat a lesser talent, but both in script and direction Kolirin proves he's more than up to the task. His picaresque humor and witty style are a joy to behold, as is his respect for all quirks of character.
Thesping is terrific, with everyone in perfect tune. Acting powerhouse Elkabetz displays a wonderful comic charm, sardonic yet warm and ultimately vulnerable -- her head keeps moving slightly in a swagger that's more protective armor than artifice. She and Gabai play perfectly together, his shy eyes almost afraid of her challenging, affectionate gaze. Newcomer Bakri, too, has a great flare for timing and exudes buckets of uncomplicated charm.
Visuals are a particular pleasure: Kolirin has a witty sense of composition, unexpectedly passing people in and out of the frame to maximum, but not overdone, humorous effect. The band's light blue uniforms, contrasted against the desert, are ideal visual reminders that they're out of place, and yet as pic makes clear, there's every reason in the world for them to be there. Music, that ideal bringer-together of cultures, beautifully contributes to the theme.
