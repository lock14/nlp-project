“I Love You, Beth Cooper’’ is unusual in that it’s the rare teen stu-com  - shorthand for “stupid comedy,’’ a proud lineage that goes back to “Porky’s’’ and beyond  - that’s based on a novel. On the other hand, maybe not so unusual, since author Larry Doyle has written for “The Simpsons’’ and “Beavis and Butt-Head’’ (and The New Yorker, OK?), and he comes clean about his love for all things John Hughes in the quotes that open each chapter. So what we have here is a cross-media repurposing of teen movies mulched through Doyle’s head onto the page, then remulched by him and director Chris Columbus back onto film.
The results, not surprisingly, taste like mulch. “I Love You, Beth Cooper’’ is one of those long-graduation-night-of-the-teenage-soul comedy dramas (“American Graffiti’’ and “Dazed and Confused’’ remain the platinum standard) in which geek woos golden girl and everything goes fantastically wrong before it goes outrageously right. There’s no denying the movie starts out, as in the book, with a bang: High school senior Denis Cooverman (played by 28-year-old Paul Rust) decides to use his valedictorian speech to go out in a blaze of glory, proclaiming his undying love for head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere).
In the same speech, he namechecks and pop-analyzes the school’s bully (Josh Emerson), psycho military freak (Shawn Roberts), and bitchy queen bee (Marie Avgeropoulos) before outing his own best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter). Rust, who’s quite good behind his enormous beak of a nose, expertly conveys the sweat-flop thrill of burning all your bridges in public  - the scene’s propulsively funny because you have no idea where it’s going to end.
It does end, though, and takes the rest of the movie with it. Beth, contemptuously amused, turns up at Denis’s house with her two BFF minions, ditzy Treece (Lauren Storm) and dead-eyed Cammie(Lauren London). Shortly following is her boyfriend Kevin, the aforementioned psycho G.I. Joe, who with his own steroid toadies chases Denis, Rich, and the girls throughout the suburban evening. There are stops at the liquor store, the girls’ locker room, the queen bee’s party, various unlit back roads. A Hummer gets driven through a picture window. A raccoon is made to look like a feral killer through the use of computer-generated fangs. Yes, again.
“I Love You, Beth Cooper,’’ in other words, is a rehash of teen-comedy conventions that occasionally comes within shouting distance of its ’80s-era inspirations. Carpenter’s character is a film geek, dropping classic lines of dialogue none of the others even recognize (been there), and when he references Curtis Armstrong in “Risky Business,’’ you realize that’s what this movie wants to be: one of those crummy yet witty “Savage’’ Steve Holland comedies Armstrong made with John Cusack back in the day: “Better Off Dead’’ or “One Crazy Summer.’’ For “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’’ fans, there’s even the blissful sight of that movie’s Alan Ruck  - scha-winggg, battah  - as the hero’s cool-jerk dad.
Here’s what I can’t figure out, though: Why invite Chris Columbus to this party? He’s a well-rewarded studio hack who can and has brought major properties successfully to the screen  - “Home Alone,’’ the first two “Harry Potter’’ films  - without a hint of personality or genuine moviemaking passion. You can tell he gets the jokes and likes the characters in “Beth Cooper,’’ but he’s unable to stitch the scenes together with any comic momentum. The movie keeps building and flat-lining, building and flat-lining, botching (among other things) the subplot about whether the best friend is or isn’t gay. You leave wondering if anyone involved with “Beth Cooper’’ has even met anyone who’s gay.
Panettiere, I’m sad to report, is a dud as the title character, a supposed wild thang who never rises above the level of runty, obnoxious mall chick, down to the roll-on tan. (Storm and London register much more strongly as her friends.) The movie takes pains to humanize this dull mannequin while making cruel sport of the ugly girl (Anna Mae Routledge) Denis is ashamed he ever dated. Here’s an idea, please: Can some woman repurpose her high school years and finally stick it to all the geeky boys who grew up and made it in Hollywood?

The cute, virginal nerd who triumphs in the pleasantly low-key teen comedy I Love You, Beth Cooper  fulfills an ambition at once more chaste and more daring than the sexual goals set by the cute, virginal nerds who ruled in Superbad : Right up there on the stage at Buffalo Grove High School's graduation, valedictorian Denis Cooverman (comedy improv regular Paul Rust, from the Adrien Brody school of proboscic grandeur) makes the title declaration to the object of his unrequited affection (Heroes ' Hayden Panettiere), a tough little pistol of a cheerleader. Superbrave! Then he speaks his mind to other high school archetypes, including the school bully, the class rich bitch, Beth's bulldog of an older boyfriend, and Denis' own drama-loving best friend who hasn't declared his sexual orientation, leaving his classmates to declare it for him.
The movie, directed with modesty by Home Alone  and Harry Potter  helmer Chris Columbus from a swell book and screenplay by comic writer Larry Doyle (Buffalo Grove class of '76), follows the fallout from Denis' barn-burning speech  a cheery night to-remember comedy of outlandish, unlikely coincidences and lively mishaps, culminating in the shared witness of a sweet, hope-streaked sunrise. The story is timeless; this could  have taken place when Doyle graduated in '76  or any year, really, since the effects of high school linger throughout adult life and nerds are forever.


 “It’s O.K. just to have fun sometimes,” says a dad (Alan Ruck) to his anxious, nerdy son. So true. And if fun is what you’re looking for, you might want to avoid “I Love You, Beth Cooper,” the drab and incoherent teen comedy in which this nugget of advice appears.  Directed by Chris Columbus with barely enough style and cinematic panache to eke out three minutes on YouTube, “I Love You, Beth Cooper” starts promisingly enough, with that anxious, nerdy son, Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) delivering the valedictory address at his high school graduation. In a moment of reckless bravery that appears less and less in character as the picture wears on, he blurts out a number of shocking and uncomfortable truths about his classmates, including the five words that give the movie its name.  Beth, played with good humor by Hayden Panettiere (“Heroes”) is the honey-blond head of the cheerleading squad and the kind of girl who, in a movie like this, barely knows that poor Denis exists. Nonetheless she shows up with her two not-so-mean-girl sidekicks (Lauren London and Lauren Storm) at his lame graduation party, where the only other guest is his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter). The girls’ arrival kicks off a long night’s journey into semi-maturity, during which nothing remotely as funny happens as the least funny thing that happens in “Superbad.”  What does happen is that Rich strenuously denies that he’s gay, while Denis is punched by Beth’s psycho-warrior boyfriend, falls off a roof, is hit by a car and winds up looking as bloody and battered as Edward Norton in “Fight Club.” Larry Doyle’s script for “I Love You, Beth Cooper,” based on his somewhat better novel of the same title, contains one or two mildly amusing jokes, but it can’t decide what tone it wants to take, swerving between simpering sincerity and jumpy, resentful hostility.  The conceit is that Denis will finally learn to appreciate the real Beth Cooper, but her character, like his, is composed of so many contradictory modes of behavior and states of feeling that she never registers as anything but a cute blonde with inexplicable patience for the gawky guy who professes to love her. Denis, for his part, is nothing more than a collection of familiar traits, whose passions are too crabbed, small and uncertain to sustain a whole movie, even one whose governing passion is offered tongue in cheek.  “I Love You, Beth Cooper” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has teasing allusions to adolescent sex, fights and under-age drinking.

Adapted by Larry Doyle from his 2007 novel, "I Love You, Beth Cooper" peaks early -- like, during the first three minutes -- and rapidly goes downhill from there. Attempting to create an "American Graffiti" for the current teen generation, director Chris Columbus squanders a fertile premise with a loud series of episodic gags, so much so that by the time a few moments of genuine sweetness belatedly arrive, the pic has exhausted any goodwill. Hayden Panettiere ("Heroes") is the primary draw as the movie's poster girl, but that's a slim PG-13 come-on to the young guys representing "Beth Cooper's" best hope.
Of course, Panettiere plays an indestructible cheerleader in her TV series, and she needn't stretch much here as a surprisingly vulnerable one -- the not-very-subtle "Breakfast Club"-esque message being that high school stereotypes are not necessarily all they appear.
With apologies to "Heroes," if only saving this cheerleader could salvage the movie -- or, for that matter, if only Columbus had found a way to relate Doyle's story with greater style, and in less than 102 laborious minutes.
High school valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) -- prodded by his movie-obsessed, maybe-gay best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) -- decides to "seize the day" at graduation and say exactly what he thinks. That includes not only expressing his long-simmering admiration for Panetierre's Ms. Cooper -- the girl he has worshipped from afar -- but telling off her muscle-bound ROTC boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) and calling out the school bully, a stuck-up diva and so on.
The fallout from that uncharacteristic burst of boldness and honesty could have potentially made for an interesting movie. Instead, "Beth Cooper" devolves into an all-in-one-night graduation romp -- mostly encouraged by Denis' dad, an appropriately cast Alan Ruck -- that simply feels pallid next to "Superbad" and other edgier coming-of-age comedies that, these days, all seem somehow connected to the prolific mind of Judd Apatow.
Basically, Beth and her pom-pom pals Cammy and Treece (Lauren London and Lauren Storm, respectively) that comprise the "trinity" show up at Denis' house, leading him and Rich on a madcap evening with Kevin in hot pursuit. Denis is said to be bound for Stanford and eventually med school, which is good, since an assortment of rapidly healing cuts and bruises follow.
As constructed, it's almost as if Richard Dreyfuss' "Graffiti" character actually caught up with that dream blonde in the convertible -- only to discover that once he did, there was nothing much left to do or talk about, other than race through Vancouver's wooded areas.
Rust is certainly nerdy enough, and Panettiere does what she can with what's really more an object than a fleshed-out personality. The same goes for Storm as her promiscuous, bubble-headed friend -- a near-bright spot who might be more amusing if her dialogue was less predictable -- and Carpenter's Rich, forced to keep proclaiming his heterosexuality while enthusiastically quoting from classic movies that are significantly better than the one we're watching.
"No regrets," Denis states during his impassioned address, in which he urges his peers to seize their moment. For the young, that's always an appealing thought, but one suspects "Beth Cooper" will nevertheless leave plenty of regrets behind, all around.

Did erstwhile John Hughes  protégé and Harry Potter   progenitor Chris Columbus  fall behind on his payments on a sub-prime mortgage? Or have to pony up for an emergency organ transplant? Even if so, I'm not sure it fully excuses this joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce, set into motion when nerdy valedictorian Dennis Cooverman  (Paul Rust ) uses his commencement address to profess his unrequited love for the titular cheerleading goddess (Hayden Panettiere ). Complications ensue as the numinous Ms. Cooper pays a grad-night visit chez Cooverman with two gal pals in tow and a coked-up Army brat boyfriend (Shawn Roberts ) in hot pursuit. Cue the listless succession of house trashings, party crashings, realizations that beautiful people can be insecure, too, and enough reckless driving to result in a double-digit body count—fitting for a movie that's about as funny as a hit-and-run. At least Columbus and writer Larry Doyle  are up-front about their inspirations, giving Dennis a film-geek BFF (Jack T. Carpenter ) who name-checks Risky Business  and a dad played by none other than Ferris Bueller   wingman Alan Ruck . But why no love for Columbus's own 1987 debut feature, Adventures in Babysitting , which went through these same one-wild-night paces with real ingenuity and pizzazz—and less need to persistently debase its characters? "This isn't fun anymore," says the wise young Cooverman after his third or fourth near-death experience. "Who says it's supposed to be fun?" replies his unattainable lady love. Exactly.
