An outright horror film that nonetheless veers on occasion into surreal black comedy, The Signal
 (a favorite at last year's Sundance and SXSW Film festivals) takes Marshall McLuhan's famous statement "the medium is the message" to extremes not explored since David Cronenberg's seminal, frighteningly prescient Videodrome
 in 1983. (It also bears a striking resemblance in both story and tone to Stephen King's novel Cell
, currently on its way to the big screen courtesy of Eli Roth.) Willowy blonde Mya (Ramsey) and Simon Pegg look-alike Ben (Welborn) are lovers who are apart when, without any explanation whatsoever, their friends and neighbors � including Mya's jealous husband, Lewis (Bowen) � go berserk and begin killing each other in graphic, violent, wholly inexplicable ways. The theory among the survivors is that a bizarre radio/television/cell-phone transmission is the source of the sudden explosion of random violence, but (as in George Romero's Dead
 films and his thematically similar, little-seen 1973 semigem The Crazies
) exactly how or why this is happening misses the point. Divided into three interlocking stories, each helmed by a different director, The Signal
 is a shuddery critique of the ultrapervasive influence of big (and little) media on humanity and the paranoia engendered by its sheer invasiveness. It's also a snarky stab at the desensitizing aspects of everything, from horror movies (the film begins with what appears to be a Last House on the Left
 knockoff) to the slow and steady demise of the "good neighbor" concept. (Do you
 know the names of everyone on your block? And would you trust them with an ice pick during a crisis?) Midway through, as both the signal-deranged Lewis and a wounded Ben are pursuing the missing Mya, The Signal
 almost (but not quite) turns into an Upright Citizens Brigade sketch, as it slows down to take in the carnage � mental and otherwise � at a young couple's suburban homestead, where guests are arriving for a planned New Year's Eve party. Surprisingly, this ends up being the most unnerving slice of paranoiac nightmarishness in the film, with freakish hallucinations and ultraviolent death (and zany party hats!) as the order of the day. The Signal
 envisions a remarkably effective breakdown-of-society scenario on an obviously low budget and does it in a new and interesting way. True, Mya and Lewis' apartment setting looks to be straight out of the opening tenement sequence in Dawn of the Dead
, but even that homage, intentional or not, only adds to the film's overall sense of claustrophobic doom. Both apocalyptic and suitably vague, The Signal
's only serious weakness comes from some borderline histrionic performances; then again, it's tough to call hysteria anything other than a sane response to a world gone mad. Crazy, man.


"The Signal," a new sorta-kinda horror thriller, is set in a future-present that seems like the present-past. Flat-screen TVs are broadcasting an emission that turns whoever watches it into a paranoid killer (or something like that). But nostalgia for 2003 is quietly afoot. The film recaptures an age when AT&T was still Cingular and when almost every scene seems to be unfolding in a video for a Hoobastank song. One of the characters even flees danger lugging around her Discman.
Amid all the bedlam - people run screaming down hallways and streets - is a simple story of forbidden love. Ben (Justin Welborn) is trying to find Mya (Anessa Ramsey), the married woman who's been cheating with him. He looks like a barista. She looks like a spinning instructor. Together, they seem like they'd have a hot graphic-design start-up.
I'm just speculating. Atlanta-based writer-director-editors David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and Jacob Gentry don't give much away (there's not a lot of where, why, and how). The withholding has its rewards. We're never properly situated, and disorientation is what we want from a movie where people bash in skulls with exterminator cans and an electric charge can momentarily reanimate a severed head. The other bonus of not knowing much about "The Signal"? It allows some of the filmmaking skill to sneak up on you.
The first scene isn't exactly promising. It's crudely made psycho-on-the-loose schlock. But soon we're safely in Ben's bed with Mya. His TV pops on and transmits the kind of sub-psychedelic imagery that could be a screensaver - or it could be how you get Jefferson Airplane to come over and play at your house.
Mya goes home to her husband, Lewis (AJ Bowen), who wants to know where she's been (drinking with the girls, duh). Before she can hop in the shower, he beats one of his buddies with a baseball bat. (In this movie's parlance, Lewis appears to have "the crazy.") Mya's attempt to escape him and her apartment building isn't all that well done. For one thing, the acting up to this point isn't very good. Neither is the sloppy but dull way the action's been directed. For another, I wasn't scared and was losing whatever curiosity I'd had. It's better than the opening sequences, but still.
Then a few scenes later, we meet Ken (Christopher Thomas) and Anna (Cheri Christian), and the movie makes a radical, jarring transition into the sort of comedic horror you might expect from an Ionesco protégé or the early days of "Saturday Night Live." Their apartment is crashed by suspicious neighbors, including the freaked-out Clark (Scott Poythress) and an entertaining letch named Jim (Chad McKnight). They might have the crazy, too.
Apparently, Bruckner, Bush, and Gentry handled different portions of the movie. The ones in that apartment are by far the most impressive. Once the movie moves on, it doesn't go anywhere all that terrific. But the filmmaking stays sharp and the acting maintains its ferocity. Welborn and Bowen are particularly good. I would just like to have personally felt some of the electricity coursing through them. Still, watching the cast is a little like discovering that Naomi Watts actually did know what she was doing in David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." You don't feel like you've been drawn into some vast alternate universe the way you are in Lynch's movie or that major actors have been born. None of the rabbit holes in "The Signal" go that deep. But you do leave persuaded that you've discovered some talented people. I don't know whether this directing trio plans to make more movies together. If not, they might have another calling. Bruckner, Bush, and Gentry sounds like a pretty good law firm.
Their movie premiered at 2007's Sundance film festival, but its homemade feel is of a piece with the pseudo-do-it-yourself horror philosophy of "Cloverfield" and "George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead," two current horror movies that suggest the genre's prerogatives have undergone a paradigm shift. The subtexts are visibly close to the surface. "The Signal" is like a Romero zombie movie in which the zombies aren't dead, they're just really temperamental. Evil here is technology-born. Maybe our cellphones and satellite dishes are giving us all the crazy. If the message is, "Turn off your TV, put your phones away, and watch more movies," you'll get no argument from me.


An electronic signal, sent through television screens, reduces people to their raging ''primal'' selves. They're not zombies  they are just murderously angry. Told in three sections (each with a different director), this Look Ma, no hands! And no head either! horror film makes a Mixmaster stew out of Poltergeist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Re-Animator, They Came From Within,  and Shaun of the Dead . The Dada gross-out jokes are inventive, but The Signal  mostly comes down to rage fiends going at one another with baseball bats, knives, pesticide tanks, and power drills.

 Correction Appended  This three-part horror movie directed by a trio of Atlanta  filmmakers is set during the collapse of Terminus, a fictional city whose citizens are being driven to rage by a mysterious signal that jams  televisions and phones.  Part 1, directed by David Bruckner, follows an adulterous wife, Mya (Anessa Ramsey), as she leaves her lover, Ben (Justin Welborn), and returns to her jealous husband, Lewis (A. J. Bowen), on the night the signal turns her apartment building into a charnel house. This section is superb, with affecting performances, a sense of dread reminiscent of John Carpenter’s “Prince of Darkness” and many striking images (Mya blasting music on her headphones to shut out the chaos; a murder reflected in a car’s side mirror).  Part  2, directed by Jacob Gentry, finds a now-raging Lewis associating with some equally unhinged apartment dwellers in a warped facsimile of domestic life; it aims for George Romero-style ghastly humor, but it’s more grating than funny. Part  3, directed by Dan Bush, finds Lewis and Ben fighting to possess Mya and reignites the apocalyptic mood of Part  1. It adds a splash of tragic love, but its preference for gore over feeling becomes monotonous.

Television isn't merely a vast wasteland in "The Signal," but a malevolent weapon that turns viewers into homicidal maniacs. Borrowing heavily from the current trend in zombie comedy and apocalyptic horror but shifting it away from the usual undead norms, pic carves out a fresh angle in the crowded indie horror universe while blatantly stealing ideas from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's "Pulse." Hipster support nurtured by Sundance and South by Southwest screenings could carve out a path to good alt commercial prospects theatrically and in its natural venue on homevid.
The writer-director trio of David Bruckner, Jacob Gentry and Dan Bush have split helming chores by way of the narrative's three acts, cheekily titled "transmissions," though there's no detectable difference in style or tone among them (save perhaps second act's somewhat more theatrical black comedy, directed by Gentry). In the end, the combo doesn't detract from "The Signal's" intent as an irreverent horror show, but neither does it triple the film-viewing rewards.
Pic at first appears to be a remake of an American International Pictures-style bloodfest from the '70s, which then becomes the televised image on a bigscreen tube -- suddenly interrupted by a barrage of multicolored interference. TV is in the bedroom where lovers Ben (Justin Welborn) and Mya (Anessa Ramsey) are having a tryst, with Ben pressing Mya to leave her marriage and run away with him.
His offer starts looking more appealing when Mya returns home to suspicious and jealous hubby Lewis (A.J. Bowen), who can tell that Mya is cheating. Signal interference also occurs on Lewis' set, sending its owner on a killing spree. Soon, TV-watching neighbors are involved in a bloodbath, sprinkled with spouse-on-spouse axe murders.
Lewis is eventually caught and bound, but Mya and Lewis' pal Rod (Sahr Ngaujah) realize the only safe exit is by fleeing the building. Rod soon goes mad himself, setting off some wild action, with pic coursing into second section set almost entirely in another apartment.
The script borrows its time-rewind device from films like "Pulp Fiction," though it never feels intrinsic to the story. Midsection marks pic's best mixture of laughs and gore, as Lewis comes into contact with apartment dweller Anna (Cheri Christian), who has just killed her husband (Christopher Thomas), and Anna's landlord (Scott Poythress), who's trying to figure out the best way to move forward on this very bad day.
Gripped by paranoia and jealousy, Lewis sees his wife everywhere he turns and demands to know where she is from these perfect strangers. Anna's previous party plans inject just the right tone of domestic normalcy, cutting against the absurd violence to come, especially when Ben shows up.
Mya's escape from town (dubbed Terminus) is picked up in the third section, though there's a distinct sense that "The Signal" has already peaked. Thesps get seriously into the roles, rendering the situation that much funnier, with Ramsey working against the type of the innocent heroine, and Bowen going beyond the parameters of the husband scorned.
Filmmaking is pleasurably on the cheap, though digital vid image seems altogether the wrong look for a film that screams to be shot on celluloid.

'Do you have the crazy?" a wild-eyed zombie fighter demands of his duct-taped captive. The Signal  has the crazy all right, bless its cold and sick little heart. A roundelay/tag-team triptych by three directors, filmed in the hitherto-untapped zombie haven of Atlanta, this uneven but impressive shot-on-digital shocker earns a marker in the mausoleum of apocalyptic horror—a genre that's proving (un)surprisingly durable in the new century.
Four decades ago, surely no one thought the grainy black-and-white Götterdämmerung of George A. Romero's  Night of the Living Dead  would stand as the movies' most telling evocation of Vietnam -era unease and upheaval—a nation imagining itself under siege by something in the air, the world outside reduced to grasping, hungry hands. Since then, though, every generation has gotten the zombie movie it deserves. The genre has circled back from the consumer-culture food court of 1978's Dawn of the Dead  to concerns very much like those a decade earlier: bloodthirsty foes, friendly fire, and hometown streets as a Darwinian battleground.
With The Signal , the zombie war arrives in the heartland—not that you could recognize its generic big-box high-rises and nondescript apartment buildings as such. (Unless, of course, you live in any mid-size American burg trying to defibrillate its flat-lining downtown in the wake of suburban sprawl.) The name of this vaguely futuristic hot zone is Terminus, a 19th-century name for early-railroad-hub Atlanta that seems ominously apt here. Swiping a page from Brian De Palma , the movie opens with fake horror—a mock torture-porn epic playing on one of the film's ubiquitous flat-screen TVs—that sets off the "real" horrors to come.
Bzzt. Bzzzt.  The screen blips and buzzes, and the image gives way to blaring white noise and a whorled vortex of color that's a Rorschach of discord (mushroom clouds? melting faces? a Doppler radar of projected doom?). Waking from a tryst with tattooed Ben (Justin Welborn ), who's in front of the blazing tube, married Mya (Anessa Ramsey ) briefly considers what it would be like not to rush back to her grim apartment. Back home, she faces her suspicious husband Lewis (AJ Bowen ), who's watching a game with his buddies when all at once the TV goes haywire. A minute and one bludgeoning by baseball bat later, the world is suddenly a different place.
The Signal  was written and directed by three Atlanta filmmakers—David Bruckner , Jacob Gentry , and Dan Bush —along the lines of the old surrealist jape exquisite corpse: One starts the film, and the next continues the story. The movie divides into three distinct sections, each labeled a "transmission." The first, written and directed by Bruckner, follows Mya's harrowing journey out of her blood-spattered domicile into a harsh new realm of crazies armed with hedge-clippers and other makeshift weapons of mass destruction. Unlike Romero's virus, the mystery signal only enhances whatever bloodlust is already there, while leaving the infected (in a fitting 21st-century twist) with enough mental ability to justify their killing.
The first section is well-done if familiar low-budget horror, making the most of its modest production values with empty morning streets, anxious handheld camera, and judicious gore effects. It's the second, Gentry's "The Jealousy Monster," that distinguishes the movie: a bold switch to splattery satire inside the home of a traumatized socialite (Cheri Christian ), who numbly prepares for her New Year's soiree literally over her husband's dead body. (The murder weapon is too sweet to give away.) As intruder Lewis whittles down the guest list with Pythonesque logic ("She was coming at me," he says defensively of one bludgeoned innocent), the humor in no way lessens the chill of a world tilted off its axis.
The Signal 's feeble (and thankfully few) attempts at blast-in-the-face scares—the whoopee cushion of schlock horror—are less effective than its pervasive, surreal atmosphere of life out of balance. The mostly unknown actors make up in conviction and determination what they lack in polish: Welborn and Bowen are especially good in the movie's third and weakest section, which has the task of tying up the many narrative strands and introduces some clunky late-film exposition. Even here, The Signal  retains its admirable emphasis on character and situation over worn-out shock effects. It's peopled with individuals, not archetypes; in a break with the allegorical nature of most zombie movies, the personal here trumps the political, though the subtext—paranoia as a potent neurotoxin that destroys from within—remains.
Employing its interlocked multipart narrative more convincingly than anything Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu  has done since Amores Perros —the appearance and recurrence of characters in each other's stories seems organic and unforced—The Signal  borrows the most potent trope from the late-'90s Japanese horror craze: the transmission of unspecified evil along the electronic teats plugged into every surge protector and car jack (TVs, radios, cell phones). Amusingly, The Signal —a radar blip at South by Southwest  2007 and a fanboy word-of-mouth sensation ever since—is busy insinuating itself into households using the same methods: MySpace , Facebook , and YouTube. If the filmmakers' viral marketing strategy succeeds, pretty soon we'll all have the crazy. As if we didn't already.
