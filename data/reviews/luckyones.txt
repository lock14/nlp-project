So far, the box office has not been terribly kind to movies about the Iraq war or the soldiers who wage it. The Lucky Ones
 is not likely to alter that situation, although the solid threesome of actors at the film's core and the storyline set entirely on American soil may earn the film greater props from moviegoers than some of the previous films. In many ways, The Lucky Ones
 is a universal story about rudderless Americans, not just this particular pack of Army veterans. Yet, the story (by director Burger and Dirk Wittenborn) contains too many coincidences and convergences to wholly ring true. Strangers Colee (McAdams), Cheever (Robbins), and T.K. (Pe�a) are on the same flight from Germany to JFK when they discover that a blackout has canceled all connecting flights out of New York. Colee and T.K. are both on leave from the Army for 30 days, while reservist Cheever has completed his tour of duty and plans to return home for good to his wife and son in St. Louis. Colee and T.K. are headed to Las Vegas, each on a separate mission, so the three soldiers rent a car and head west. Colee is a spirited and open-hearted young woman who hopes to be taken in by her dead boyfriend's parents whom she has never met. T.K. suffered a groin injury and plans to visit some Vegas "pros" who might help him get his equipment working before having to confess the injury to his girlfriend. Cheever's expectation of picking up his old life ends abruptly when his wife tells him upon his arrival that she wants a divorce, his son informs him that $20,000 is needed in three weeks' time in order for him to go to Stanford, and he learns that his former job at the plant has been eradicated by cutbacks. Reeling from all the news, Cheever continues on with the others to Vegas. Many more events occur all along the way that bond the three and conspire to make them a battle-tested unit. Robbins is quietly effective as the elder of the bunch, while Pe�a shows us something of the growth of a cocky kid into sobering adulthood. The film's contemporary realism differs radically in style from Burger's surprise hit The Illusionist
. More than a story about Iraq war veterans, The Lucky Ones
 is a movie about carefully considering one's options.


"The Lucky Ones" is as close as a movie about three Iraq war soldiers should come to mediocre TV comedy.
Tim Robbins, Michael Peña, and Rachel McAdams play Fred Cheaver, TK Poole, and Colee Dunn - a reservist, a medic, and a private, battle-wounded strangers with a common Army bond. Fred has finished his last tour, and TK and Colee are on a monthlong leave.
They arrive at JFK airport together, discover that a blackout has canceled their connecting flights, and manage to snag the last rental car, which they drive to St. Louis where Cheaver lives. A series of glitches and catastrophes follow (divorce papers, a car accident, $20,000 to raise, a tornado, impotence), some more bearable and believable than others.
Director Neil Burger co-wrote the movie with Dirk Wittenborn, and while he doesn't always seem sure whether to play the material for pathos or comedy, he's confident with his cast.
Robbins keeps a tight lid on what could have been another of his yahoos. He takes a put-upon a man and relieves him of any gratuitous angst. Cheaver loses it. He breaks down. But Robbins never cracks up; he's too busy playing the adult to two kids. It's one of his smartest performances.
Peña is as good as usually he is - funny, slow to anger, touching. He and McAdams have a sensual scene together huddled inside a drainpipe. She's almost unrecognizable, with her hair pulled back and a mouth that never stops running. The character is a sweet, twanging mess of silliness, churlishness, and childishness. This is a Hilary Swank part that Swank herself probably couldn't relax enough to play.
Occasionally, you wonder how these three characters might handle the theater of combat. "The Lucky Ones" doesn't have a thunderous statement to make about the war or any flashback footage to share. It contains very little military shop talk. It's the emotional opposite of Kimberly Peirce's rumbling "Stop-Loss," which came out in the spring and also featured a soldier on a forced road trip.
But "The Lucky Ones" has more chilling real-world details. When we see a recruiting booth stationed outside a casino, we know the Army is another gamble. But the woman and two men in this movie need the military as much as the military needs them. "The Lucky Ones" is part of a disturbing new era in American war movies. Military service is no longer simply an expression of patriotism. It's another way to make ends meet.


In The Lucky Ones , a trio of U.S. soldiers who have just returned from Iraq  Tim Robbins as a 40ish veteran, and Rachel McAdams and Michael Peña as younger grunts on a 30-day leave  team up to drive across the country. The last time the Iraq war was the impetus for a road movie, with John Cusack gawking in his aviator frames in Grace Is Gone , I broke down and cried (not from the tragedy, from the film's excruciating ineptitude and tedium). The Lucky Ones , though, isn't a meandering, didactic downer. The word ''Iraq'' is never mentioned, and the film has been designed as a kind of triple buddy flick, done with enough comedy and ''pace'' to fill out half a season of a TV series. That's what's likable about it  and also what's suspect. Each character is defined by one issue of extreme gravitas that is treated as a situation , an arc to be tidily resolved. Robbins learns that his wife wants to leave him (a credible problem staged in an overdone way), and he must find $20,000 so his son can attend Stanford. McAdams, who claims no kin, wants to join the family of the soldier who saved her. And Peña has a thigh wound that's turned him impotent. It's all very facile  war's domestic fallout made into feel-good fodder  but The Lucky Ones  isn't dull, and the actors do quite nicely, especially McAdams, who's feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring. B–

 “The Lucky Ones,” a bittersweet comedy about three seemingly dissimilar American soldiers who embark on a road trip after their flights home are canceled, is the latest in a string of films inspired by the war in Iraq. But this one, written by Neil Burger and Dirk Wittenborn and directed by Mr. Burger, has little interest in making bold pro- or antiwar proclamations.  With a smooth, light touch (though not without bumps and awkward moments) it focuses instead on the idea that the present and the people who factor into it are all we really have. Aside from the opening, the only combat scenes to be found here are strictly domestic, and, in terms of its lead characters, internal.  At the end of his tour and after nearly two years overseas, Fred Cheever (a refreshingly restrained Tim Robbins) can’t wait to see his wife and son in St. Louis, but the reunion turns out to be teary for unforeseen reasons. Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams, luminous as always), on a 30-day leave after being shot in the leg, is on her way to Las Vegas to pay an unannounced visit to her dead boyfriend’s parents. More than a few surprises await her as well, but nothing can beat down her determinedly sunny outlook on life. T. K. Poole (Michael Peña), also recently wounded and headed for Las Vegas, dreads informing his fiancée that a piece of shrapnel has left him impotent.  Their journey is jampacked  with misadventures and personal epiphanies, some touching, others laughably contrived (a sudden, completely phony-looking tornado being the most absurd). But because the lead actors work so well together, adding depth and levels of vulnerability to fairly underwritten roles, the emotional consequences of the sense of displacement these “lucky” characters — lucky to be alive, lucky to have met one another — must deal with always ring true.  “The Lucky Ones” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, brief violence and sexual content.

It's hard to find the genuine heartfelt moments in "The Lucky Ones," a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the U.S., under the clutter of narrative contrivances and coincidences. Shot in a naturalistic, entirely different style from that of director Neil Burger's last film, the elegant "The Illusionist," the new picture reps a comedown after that surprise 2006 hit. A good cast keeps the journey watchable, but this is another Iraq-themed title seemingly destined for quick playoff after its long-delayed Sept. 26 release.
A working-class drama intended to reach common folk where they live, the script by Burger and Dirk Wittenborn centers on characters who have not thought deeply or well about their lives and attempt to make the right decisions under difficult, likely life-changing circumstances.
After a tour of duty in Iraq, three Americans fly home from Germany, each facing a welcome more uncertain than they can know. Colee (Rachel McAdams), a private with a wounded leg, plans to show up unannounced at the Las Vegas home of her late boyfriend's parents, present them with his old guitar and hopefully score a place to stay before returning for another tour in 30 days. TK (Michael Pena), also on leave for a month, is due to see his girlfriend on the West Coast but, as he hasn't mentioned the shrapnel injury that's rendered him sexually MIA, he'd like to cure the condition before the reunion.
By contrast, 50ish reservist Cheaver (Tim Robbins) is now done with the Army. Not having seen his wife and son for an unexplained two years, Cheaver hopes to return to St. Louis and normalcy. But as soon as they arrive in New York, the three hit their first speed bump -- a widespread blackout preventing domestic flights -- so they rent a car to drive to Missouri, from where Colee and TK will go their own ways.
Unacquainted before, they quickly remedy that. Colee is an open-hearted, overly trusting proletarian livewire who defends her ne'er-do-well ex-b.f. and isn't above starting a barroom brawl (in a poorly staged scene) when some local dimwits piss her off. TK is proud and slow to let down his guard, convinced of his capacities as a leader.
Glad just to be alive, Cheaver arrives home to a rude awakening: His wife, in earshot of the others, instantly announces she wants a divorce. Then his son enthuses that he's been accepted at Stanford but needs $20,000 within three weeks or he'll lose his spot.
His world having collapsed on top of him, Cheaver drives on with his soldier buddies to sort things out, to Vegas by way of Denver. A visit to a megachurch and a kind invitation from a wealthy congregant turns into a corny comic sex romp; even more contrived is a side trip smack into a tornado, which triggers unexpected, sitcom-worthy consequences.
The daily life-and-death crises these characters faced in Iraq are replaced on their trip by the less dire but still pressing matters facing them at home, the subtext being that Iraq represents a distraction from domestic matters, which consequently suffer from neglect. There are moments when the sought-after poignancy born of this dilemma is felt, but they are all too fleeting and dominated by exaggerated dramatics and broad comedy, especially as they relate to intimate matters. Tone overall is ill managed.
Keeping it human, to the extent that it is, are the performances. Playing a character who's lame, unformed and unadorned, McAdams remains as captivating as ever, maintaining the chemistry even when the balance of ingredients gets seriously out of whack. Pena nicely catches an individual in transition from cocky macho man to a cooler, more mature fellow. Robbins underplays with confidence and great effectiveness, etching an Everyman of no particular distinction who works through a vexing decision to the point of making it look easy.
Tech considerations put mobility ahead of refinement, and a varied song-dominated soundtrack shifts the mood like gear changes.


Saying The Lucky Ones  is the best film about Iraq  yet is the proverbial damning with faint praise. Conservative op-ed writers of the world, rejoice: The three soldiers in Neil Burger 's film aren't raving psychopaths or illiterate hulks, just normal Americans who love eating McDonald's  when they're on leave. One of them even believes in God. There's Cheever (Tim Robbins ), whose name must be a joke; a suburban house owner and stand-up guy, he's about as far as you can get from family abuse and three-martini lunches. Along for an ad hoc road-trip: TK (Michael Pena ), a cocky business-advice-spouting dude, and Colee (Rachel McAdams ), as nice a gal you'd ever hope to meet. All three actors are excellent—I'd been assuming that Robbins forgot how to underact sometime in the '90s, but this almost makes up for Mystic River—and Burger's film works scene to scene. But its hopelessly schematic road-trip arc (bond-fight-reconcile-repeat) grows increasingly tedious. It's a "well-made" film: Explosive emotional confrontations are deferred, the ending is purposefully unresolved, the camera-work deliberately unshowy. Thank goodness for all that—and the fact that a hashed-over war debate gets less time than one character's ED problem—but it's finally all too familiar.
