British TV veteran Barker and his screenwriter (novice Howard Himmelstein) set Oscar Wilde (Lady Windermere's Fan)
 among Jazz Age expatriates cold-chillin' on the Italian coast, and the result is not quite as dishy as one might hope, 1930s fashions and Mediterranean countryside notwithstanding. The hats are quite lovely, and Vukotic is a hoot as a decadent contessa with seven or eight yapping lapdogs, but as a tale of Beautiful People struggling to overcome social convention (either by searching for true love or by cynically rejecting it, for each policy has its pitfalls) and live authentically, it doesn't really sparkle. Hunt is an offbeat choice for Mrs. Erlynne, the aging New York man-stealer with revealing fashions and a deep, dark secret, but that's not quite the only problem here. Mrs. Erlynne follows innocent socialite Meg Windermere (Johansson) and her new husband (Umbers) to Amalfi and ingratiates herself into Lord Windemere's checkbook, ostensibly as his mistress. She raises eyebrows all over town but catches the eye of twice-divorced Tuppy (Wilkinson), who's richer than God and just as generous. Meanwhile, a notorious cad (Moore) tries to stain Meg's virtue. Watching these people seduce each other should be fun, but the movie is regrettably bland. Barker seems to be banking on Johansson's turn as an ing�nue in Girl With a Pearl Earring
 (which also starred Wilkinson), but here she seems too earthy to be shocked by improper advances in a glove shop. There's not enough work put into the performance or its direction, yet she's asked to anchor the whole film. Her lovers, Moore and Umbers, are both TV studmuffins from the UK, and they resemble each other physically, which might have sounded good on paper, but onscreen they seem too generic: handsome, rich playboys with situational ethics from Central Casting. The supporting cast senses a vacuum and runs away with the movie (particularly Roger Hammond and John Standing as grouchy, gossipy old coots who observe all the goings-on and disapprove most firmly while looking down Mrs. Erlynne's scandalous backless evening gown). Wilkinson is worth noting as the movie's moral compass � a kindly, honest New Man who meets his match in Mrs. Erlynne and forgives her trespasses. He's got an air of sincerity but also evinces the kind of loopy, what-the-hell spirit every eccentric millionaire should possess. Hunt is no more out of her depth than are the other principals, so it would be cruel to pinpoint her, but the question remains: Is TV's beloved Jamie Buchman a world-weary seductress? With its jellyfish direction, A Good Woman
 throws its actors overboard to see if they can swim.


"A Good Woman" is Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan" updated to the 1930s and minus the acute social observation. This is a little like remaking "Gone With the Wind" without the Civil War.
In stage plays like "Fan" and "The Importance of Being Earnest," Wilde used wickedly sharp dialogue and glittering farce as scalpels, laying open the hypocrisies of an Edwardian upper-class audience that only felt the sting on the hansom-cab ride home. They were social comedies very much of their moment, so bringing the action only halfway to the present day seems genuinely pointless. Still, "A Good Woman" is pretty to look at and fakes witty elegance passably, so consider it a diversion -- a movie that might have been in the Oscar race if the elements had jelled but has instead been properly hung out to dry in February.
It also answers the burning question: Where the heck has Helen Hunt been? After winning a 1997 Oscar for "As Good as it Gets," the actress has had one popular hit -- "What Women Want" in 2000 -- and a lot of squidgy misfires ("Pay It Forward," "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"). Doing a tasteful period film may be an act of desperation or desperate boredom, but give Hunt credit for making the most of her miscasting.
She plays Mrs. Erlynne, a single woman of a certain age who shocks high society by living casually off other women's husbands. This "notorious Jezebel" arrives on the Amalfi coast of Italy trolling for fresh meat (we've seen her chased out of New York City in the opening scenes), and sets her sights on Robert Windermere (Mark Umbers), a young, upright American businessman newly married to his adoring wife Meg (Scarlett Johansson). Cluck go the gossiping hens as Mrs. Erlynne and her conquest are seen ducking into side-street apartments while the lady's visible wealth increases.
In a related development, the naive Meg becomes the sexual quarry of Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore), a titled decadent who lives from one dangerous liaison to the next. The sooner the wife discovers the husband's affair, the better for Lord Darlington, who discreetly licks his chops in anticipation. The fifth wheel at this party is Lord Augustus, a.k.a. "Tuppy" (Tom Wilkinson), who's an upper class twit and knows it and who decides Mrs. Erlynne will be his next wife, shady reputation or no.
That's the playing field at the start of the film, and the pleasure should be in watching the marbles roll in unexpected directions. Despite one shocking revelation (if you don't know the play) and the handful of Wildean bon mots that make it into Howard Himelstein's screenplay (says Lord Darlington, "Marital bliss is a terrible burden to place on two people; sometimes a third person is needed to lighten the load"), "A Good Woman" goes nowhere handsomely.
Correction: It turns into a heart-tugging melodrama of sacrifice and redemption, which isn't really what Wilde had in mind. Director Mike Barker attends to the gorgeous Italian villas and costumes, and he fills the sidelines with elderly character actors rumbling amusingly, but he seems to think "Lady Windermere's Fan" is about the plot, and that's a major miscalculation.
The film turns serious, stranding a brave if foolhardy performance by Hunt. She gets the clear-sighted, necessary amorality of Mrs. Erlynne and the panic behind it; she understands this woman is nearing her expiration date as an object of desire. You never sense she could go in for the kill, though, and that's a crucial loss. Hunt plays her as smart, self-aware, and nice
.
Johansson turns in one of her few dull performances to date as the sweet, shallow Meg, and except for Wilkinson's Tuppy, the men are sticks in evening clothes. "A Good Woman" above all lacks the joyful, lucid anger that lights up Wilde's plays -- the sense that beneath the witticisms he's telling it like it is to people who aren't used to hearing it. Without that headlong intelligence, the movie's just an exercise in dress-up.
.


         Oscar, is that you? And is that still your play?
 
  Though we're not officially informed until the final credits roll, Oscar Wilde's classic "Lady Windermere's Fan" is the basis of "A Good Woman," starring Helen Hunt, Scarlett Johansson and Tom Wilkinson. The film is well intentioned and mildly diverting, but in attempting to modernize its story it has lost many of the things that make the original so memorable and not gained much in return.
 


         






    The Wilde play, source of such classic witticisms as "I can resist everything except temptation," is set entirely in a circa-1890 London drawing room during a 24-hour period, not the most cinematically inviting of locales. What better, thought screenwriter Howard Himelstein and director Mike Barker, who "didn't want to make an English drawing room comedy like something you would see on the BBC," than to move the whole business to Italy's Amalfi coast during the glamorous 1930s.
 
  Unfortunately, like certain indigenous plants, the Wilde play has not survived the transplant in perfect health. Despite its talented cast, the result lacks Wilde's trademark bite; it's soft and middlebrow, even though he was anything but. "A Good Woman" has a brief opening scene in New York, where we meet the celebrated Mrs. Erlynne (Hunt), "a notorious Jezebel" whose prowess at seducing other women's husbands is about to cause her imminent departure from that great metropolis.
 
  Scanning a magazine, Mrs. Erlynne hits on the idea of visiting Amalfi. "It attracts the rich and famous," she says to herself in one of the film's frequent and unfortunate fake-Wildean sallies, "and I'm infamous and poor. Close enough."
 
  Already in Italy are Meg Windermere (Johansson) and her husband, Robert (Mark Umbers), young and in love in the most photogenic way. "A Good Woman" has made them naive Americans, in part for casting reasons, in part to make Meg easier prey for the seductive Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore), the kind of smooth roué who says, "How can I seduce you if you always bring your husband?" Once Mrs. Erlynne arrives on the scene, she makes a connection with that very husband, and soon all of Amalfi is abuzz with the scandalous notion that she and Mr. Windermere are having an affair. But the truth is rarely what everyone says it is, especially where an Oscar Wilde plot is concerned.
 
  Although transposing this story to photogenic Italy makes for the requisite number of scenic vistas, it also creates a number of problems for the story, starting with the fact that Wilde's concerns about the restrictive nature of society don't play as well outside the rigid confines of Victorian England.
 
  Also sacrificed in this more naturalistic production is the brilliance of Wilde's artifice. The sharpness and crackling energy of his conception, frankly, makes a bad fit with the film's fitful and not particularly successful attempts to make these characters more well-rounded.
 
  Not helping either are what feel like misconceived performances by two gifted actresses. Johansson, who can be quite involving in the right part, is artificial and unconvincing as a bubble-headed naif who spends much of her time pouting through sensual lips.
 
  Although it is a treat to see Hunt in a theatrical film for the first time since Woody Allen's "Curse of the Jade Scorpion" of five years ago, she feels frankly miscast. Mrs. Erlynne must be believable as a hard femme du monde 
who cares only for herself, and Hunt, one of the most empathetic of actresses, simply does not do heartless very well.
 
  The only actor who emerges from the production relatively unscathed is the veteran Wilkinson, who alone manages the combination of reality and Wilde the film is after. "A Good Woman" won't ruin anyone's day, but it won't make anyone's either, and it won't get the great Irish playwright anything like the admiration his work deserves.
 
 'A Good Woman'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for thematic material, sensuality and language.   

''I can resist everything except temptation,'' Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell-Moore) declares in A Good Woman , tossing off one of those Oscar Wildean bons mots that keep Bartlett's Familiar Quotations  in business. The same can be said, with far less enthusiasm, of susceptible British director Mike Barker and magpie New York screenwriter Howard Himelstein, who have taken Lady Windermere's Fan   Wilde's first big stage success, written in 1892  and pulped it senseless in the name of puttin' on the charm. Then again, ''experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.'' No longer a coldly glittering play about British society types who do mischief with their bored gossip, this sappier telling moves the action to Italy's Amalfi Coast, modernizes the wardrobe to suit the sexier 1930s, and messes with the whole Windermere DNA: Titled Lord and Lady W. have been replaced by Meg and Robert Windermere, guileless young Americans. And while they're at it, the filmmakers have stifled Scarlett Johansson, who plays Meg  not an easy thing to do. With her modern tomboy elocution and frank sexuality, the forthright actress looks positively itchy and disoriented under her tight platinum blond 'do, and when she speaks Wilde's words (many lifted from the playwright's other scripts and jumbled into A Good Woman  like a homeless person bundled into all her sweaters), the actress' characteristically blunt recitation does battle with the twittering quips by which she's meant to enchant. As Mrs. Erlynne, meanwhile, in obvious wig cap and discomfort, Helen Hunt fumbles when she reaches with too much American insistence for the good in a woman everyone distrusts as bad.
In such an unsorted pile of misappropriated period-piece conventions (a touch of Brideshead Revisited  here, a Lew Stone Tin Pan Alley ditty there), Tom Wilkinson provides some relief as Tuppy, a specimen of idle wealth who sees  and loves  Mrs. Erlynne for who she is. Wilkinson, too, plays the old boy with more humanity than the upper-class twit deserves. But at least he does so with such ease and pleasure that we're grateful for the one actor who looks at home in this semi-Wilde country.

 If you insist on taking an Oscar Wilde comedy out of its natural habitat, the drawing room, please don't take it any farther than the adjoining climate-controlled hothouse where the carnivorous plants are waiting to be fed.  Don't even think of carrying it out of the country or of bringing it up to date. Wilde's twittering, hyperarticulate snobs swapping elegant bons mots belong to only one time, one place and one setting: the luxurious inner sanctums of upper-crust London in the late-late 19th century.  Alas, those cautions haven't prevented the director Mike Barker and the screenwriter Howard Himelstein from dragging "Lady Windermere's Fan," the 1892 comedy that catapulted Wilde to glory, out of the house for a rugged seaside vacation on the Italian coast. Retitled "A Good Woman" and updated to 1930, this misbegotten Hollywood-minded screen adaptation turns three of the play's British characters into Americans abroad.  Why the Italian coast? It's scenic. And who would deny the universal benefits of fresh air, sunshine and exercise?  Wilde would. No champion of the great outdoors, the playwright remarked, "At twilight, nature is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to illustrate quotations from the poets."  "A Good Woman" teems with like-minded epigrams, many well known, and many more shoehorned in from other Wilde plays: "History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality."  "I can resist everything except temptation."  "Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about."  "Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes."  To hear these and other well-turned phrases strewn through the screenplay like shards of cut glass nestled in a haystack, you must listen closely. To coexist comfortably with the prosaic dialogue surrounding them, their cutting edges have been blunted, the hauteur of their delivery subdued. When put into the mouths of American actors with no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee, they simply hang in the air and die.  There is an excruciating divide between the film's British actors (led by Tom Wilkinson and Stephen Campbell Moore), who are comfortable delivering Wilde's aphorisms (Mr. Moore gets the most), and its American marquee names, Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson. Those two stars' shrill, toneless performances bring to mind one of the play's most famous (and prescient) epigrams: "America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between."  Ms. Hunt and Ms. Johansson have so little connection to the English language as spoken in the high Wildean style that you actually wonder if America's connection to Wilde's ideal of civilization as a refined,  superliterate verbal testing ground is out of our reach. It wasn't always so.  Ms. Hunt, an actress who can win your heart when she plays it folksy, commonsensical and all-American, is disastrously miscast as Mrs. Erlynne, an American femme fatale cutting a dangerous swath. Her eyes narrowed to slits, her gait gawky, her nervous piping voice pitched on the edge of hysteria, the actress seems so uncomfortable in her skin that you want to flee her presence.  An adventuress left penniless and driven out of New York by her lovers' angry wives, Mrs. Erlynne descends on the Italian coast hellbent on what appears to be a new gold-digging expedition. No sooner has she arrived than she sets her sights on Robert Windermere (Mark Umbers), a young American businessman recently married to the luscious Rhode Island-born Meg (Ms. Johansson). Immediately, tongues wag. But appearances deceive.  Ms. Johansson is only marginally less uncomfortable as the increasingly suspicious Meg, courted by a silver-tongued playboy, Lord Darlington (Mr. Moore), who sees an opportunity to strike. Meanwhile, Mrs. Erlynne is courted by Lord Augustus, a k a Tuppy (Mr. Wilkinson), a wealthy, age-appropriate aristocrat who knows she doesn't love him but is nonetheless smitten. The disclosure of secrets and hidden agendas eventually leads us to re-evaluate Mrs. Erlynne in a much more positive light.  "A Good Woman" never overcomes its stylistic disharmony. The solid performances of Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Moore and the supporting British cast notwithstanding, the movie is so flat that it almost makes you grateful for Oliver Parker's recent flawed screen adaptations of Wilde, "An Ideal Husband" and "The Importance of Being Earnest."  Those films also played fast and loose with Wilde ("Earnest," which verged on farce, brought in gimmicks like helium balloons and found Reese Witherspoon struggling to appear authentically English), but nothing like this. Of course, it's understandable that filmmakers want to add color and texture to Wilde; the movies are such a visual medium. But it really shouldn't be necessary, if Wilde's language is allowed to do its tricks.  "A Good Woman" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

The champagne falls rather flat in "A Good Woman," a heavily reworked version of Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners, "Lady Windermere's Fan," that's neither fish nor fowl. Relocated from the snooty drawing rooms of 1890s London to the elegant playground of 1930s Amalfi, story of a young couple's marital misunderstandings has a script that plays more like a period romancer studded with occasional Wilde-isms and gets uneven treatment from a mixed Anglo-American cast, led by Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson. Older, upscale auds could respond to tastily-lensed pic's retro charms, but a wider audience awaits on cable.
Following Ernst Lubitsch's elegant 1925 silent, and Otto Preminger's 1949 version, "The Fan," with Jeanne Crain, Madeleine Carroll and George Sanders, this is only the third notable bigscreen version of Wilde's first legit hit. With its artificial characters and stagecraft, the play, first staged in 1892, remains problematic for any pic version, especially as the dialogue has less of the verbal bounce of Wilde's subsequent works.
Scripter Howard Himelstein tacitly acknowledges the last weakness by stitching in bons mots
 from other sources; however, in the mouths of some of the cast, especially Hunt, they sound more like implants than organic elements. Use of Wilde's original title for the play, "A Good Woman," is a further signal that this is no straight adaptation.
With its theme of a society woman insinuating herself back into a world she left many years ago, some of Himelstein's changes and updating work well. Prologue, with the elegant but penniless Mrs. Erlynne (Hunt) skipping unpaid bills in Gotham, 1930, and selling jewelry for a ticket to Italy, establishes a classy tone, with saturated lensing by Ben Seresin and tasty period design and costuming. On the boat, Erlynne decides to look up New York society newlyweds Robert and Meg Windermere (Mark Umbers, Johansson), vacationing on the Italian Riviera -- for reasons as yet undisclosed.
Period flavor is nicely maintained in early scenes shot on the Amalfi coast, with a quintet of idle rich -- Anglos Tuppy (Tom Wilkinson), Dumby (John Standing), Cecil (Roger Hammond) and Lady Plymdale (Diana Hardcastle), plus an invented Contessa (Milena Vukotic) -- functioning as a Greek chorus of the chattering classes. Separately, a young, studly Brit, Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore), is making his moves on the pretty, naive Meg, aided by a rich sampling of cynical Wilde-isms.
Meanwhile, Robert bumps into, and is charmed by, Erlynne while buying an antique for his wife. Later, he visits her at a rented villa and sets her up with funds, seemingly because they are lovers. In parallel with all this, Tuppy has fallen for Erlynne - but she seems strangely reluctant to marry him for his money.
Some of the mismatches sort themselves out halfway, but then Meg accidentally discovers her husband's secret payments to Erlynne. Misinterpreting them as love funds, and -- unlike the audience -- still not knowing that Erlynne is actually her long-lost mom, Meg decides to stand her ground at the final party of the season, a move that goes badly wrong.
In most respects, the film is so far from Wilde's play that it's practically a separate work. Bathed in pastels, ochres, blacks and golds, and easily moving around a variety of locations, it's like another slice of '30s nostalgia in the vein of "Enchanted April" or "Where Angels Fear to Tread." Though undeniably retaining their wit, the Wilde-isms are finally more of a distraction, imported from another world and another genre.
With straightforward dialogue and a girlish allure, Johansson acquits herself well amid the more mature, sardonic company, without giving Meg much emotional depth. Brit thesp Umbers, with a convincing American accent, is OK as the business-like Robert, and veterans like Standing and Hammond bring the gossiping supports vividly to life. In a role originally announced for Joseph Fiennes, Moore ("Bright Young Things") makes Darlington a charismatic romantic lead but simply looks too nice to convince as a cynical philanderer.
However, pic's main problem is Hunt, who's not only miscast as a mature society Jezebel -- Kim Basinger was an earlier name in the hopper -- but delivers her lines with a coldness and flatness that robs them of any pizzazz or allure. Crucially, the theme of Erlynne wanting to save her daughter from her own earlier mistakes gets lost emotionally in this version. And though Wilkinson, as Erlynne's wannabe vis-a-vis, does his utmost with the likable character of Tuppy, opposite Hunt he's mostly paddling upstream.
Helming by Mike Barker ("The James Gang," "Best Laid Plans," "To Kill a King") is pro at all levels, in a superior small-screen way. Editing by Neil Farrell never tarries.

Thick-skinned and just a tad vampiric, professional mistress Mrs. Erlynne of Lady Windermere 's Fan  suggests what The House of Mirth 's Lily Bart, with a bit more luck and fewer scruples, might have had to become if she'd reached early middle age. "I'm infamous and poor," announces the upper-crust margin-flitter in this period update of Oscar Wilde 's comedy, which moves the intrigue out of the late-19th-century London drawing room and onto the picture-postcard Amalfi coast of 1930s Italy, where luxury-liner Americans and titled Brits trade drowsy witticisms and make heavy-lidded eyes at each other whilst wondering when Rupert Everett  is due into town. Freshly stained with stateside tittle-tattle, Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt ) descends on pre-fascist paradise with her sights trained on tremulous, wealthy young Meg Windermere (Scarlett Johansson , pitching her trademark throaty drawl to a girlier trill); with blackmail in mind, the interloper focuses local gossip on the hazily inappropriate relationship between herself and Meg's husband (Mark Umbers ).
This Good Woman  is an amiable drama queen, sluggish of gait and reliant on retail therapy, her bra stuffed with cheat sheets covered in epigrams for every conceivable occasionsome of them one-liners purloined from other Wilde works. Though Golden Globes  correspondent Isaac Mizrahi  recently made other anatomical priorities when it comes to the fruits of Ms. Johansson's forest, director Mike Barker  takes a cue from the opening shot of Lost in Translation  in paying especial attention to the lady's yummy booty. Pleasant and undemanding, all the more so whenever Tom Wilkinson 's on-screen as a possible Erlynne suitor, the movie miscasts Hunt as the pragmatic seductress; striking an unvarying note of cheerful pleading, she delivers her every blown-glass line as if trying to coax her wallflower teen daughter to try out for the school play.
