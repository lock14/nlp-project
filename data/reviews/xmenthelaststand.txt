What are we to make of Kelsey Grammer's furry turn as Dr. Hank McCoy, aka the X-Man Beast? What's not to make? He's an educated person of color (blue), lodged in a high-ranking White House cabinet post and charged with holding the wavering cultural line between compassionate distaste for the various and sundry mutant folk who, in the context of the film, now populate a pollable percentage of the population, and the conservative hysterics who want to exclude them entirely from the red, white, and � much to Dr. McCoy's palpable annoyance � blue. And Colin Powell thought he
 had it rough. This third outing in the Marvel Entertainment/20th Century Fox superhero franchise lays on the subtext even more heavily than its predecessors � racial, gender, and sexual politics are all over the place, and I'm not even talking about Rebecca Romijn's too-blue, nudie-cutie mutant Mystique � and ends up coming across like an overearnest grad school dissertation on toxic love and the society what done spawned it. Director Ratner, taking over the helm from Bryan Singer (who moved on to Superman Returns
, by the way), rounds up the usual suspects, including Stewart's sage Professor X; Jackman's adamantium-clawed, Glenn Danzig-coiffed Wolverine; Berry's weather-controlling Storm; and Janssen's schizophrenic shrink, Dr. Jean Grey, (or, when she's very, very bad, the Phoenix). The big story in The Last Stand
 is, no surprise, governmental in origin, as the current administration seeks to override the mutants' wild genetic code with a "cure" that permanently supresses the gene. This is not happy news to Magneto, who, as played by McKellen, not only controls all metals around him, but also has the power to devour scenery and render any scene he appears in instantly entertaining. As befits a put-upon metallurgist with dreams of messianic glory, Magneto promptly aligns himself with the legions of hormonally frazzled mutant youth (you can tell they're serious converts to the cause by all the piercings and leather they sport) and wages war on those who would "cure" them. A smart move, as it gives X-Men: The Last Stand
 a much-needed dose of kickassery, most impressive of which arrives in the form of a final-act redistribution of San Franciscan automobile gridlock. Nifty! Still, this is a perhaps overly ambitious issue of X-mania, chockablock as it is with enough storylines � Cyclops pines for Jean, Jean goes bananas, Rogue pines for Iceman, Iceman busts a move on Pyro, Rogue goes human, ad infinitum � to gag even Mr. Marvel-ous himself, the venerable Stan Lee (who is seen watering his lawn in the opening moments). There's much to enjoy here � Ratner's pacing is fluid and fast and the film rushes along its busy, cluttered way with something approaching melodramatic snarkiness � but it's also terribly busy and cluttered. It makes you long for the days, not so long ago, when all a superhero had to worry about were the great responsibilities that came, part and parcel, with those great powers. Oh, yeah, and that whole secret-identity thing.

The happiest news about the third (and final?) "X-Men" movie is actually quite sad: headstones.
Yes, "The Last Stand" brings the lamentable deaths of several major characters. This is a courageous move since it puts the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position. Realism at this time of year? How unorthodox!
Tom Cruise might let Philip Seymour Hoffman smack him around for our entertainment. But is he willing to have the flesh pulled slowly from his bones, as a few folks do here?
Of course, "X-Men" has always been more than a cash-guzzling wham-bang Hollywood franchise. It has built a vast parallel universe around a group of morally uncertain, emotionally scarred wom en and men.
Based on the durable and frequently ingenious Marvel Comics title, these three movies sport philosophy, ideas, a telethon-load of causes, and a highly elastic us-versus-them allegory.
The "us," in this case, is the mutants, those born with superhuman powers. "Them" is the human American government out to exterminate mutants. In ``Last Stand," as ever, the fight for mutant-kind breaks down into two ideological camps: the pacifists and the insurgents, who are led, respectively, by the powerful telepath Professor X (Patrick Stewart), taking up the cause of non violence, and Magneto (Ian McKellen), the bellicose, metal-manipulating Holocaust survivor.
As more than one keen observer has noted, the two adhere to a stormy Martin Luther King-Malcolm X paradigm: two men with opposing means to the same end. Stewart and McKellen perform with tremendous seriousness. But they also bring great affection, tenderness, and familiarity to their dynamic. They could be brothers. They could have been lovers.
Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn wrote the hard - working and intelligent script, that has the Professor and Magneto considering how to deal with their latest affront. A billionaire biotech type (Michael Murphy ) has backed a cure which has been harvested from a little mutant (Cameron Bright ) with the ability to reverse other mutants' powers.
The billionaire has a son, Warren Worthington, whom we see in a horrible flashback trying to saw off the wings growing from his back. Naturally, as an adult, this meek, sensitive, handsome young man (Ben Foster ) is the first victim -- er, candidate -- for his father's reassignment surgery.
But in an exciting moment, he breaks free from the apparatus, his bare chest pushing heavenward, his enormous wings spread. He flies out the window and over Alcatraz (birdman that he is), resembling a liberated Rolls Royce hood ornament. It's not entirely clear where he's headed, but my guess is the nearest production of ``Angels in America."
Otherwise, ``Last Stand" continues where the second film ended: in a funk. Cyclops (James Marsden ) is a teary mess. At the end of the previous installment, `` X2: X-Men United," his ladylove Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) lay dead in a lake, having given her life to save the other X-Men. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine pines for her too. But in ``United," our parting shot appeared to be a bird rippling on the water.
Anyone familiar with the comic knew this was a delicious cliffhanger: Jean Grey would rise again as the unstable Phoenix. And anyone rooting for Janssen to get a chance to do some scintillating acting knew ``Last Stand" would be her moment.
Unfortunately, this latter development is not to be. Jean rises. She destroys. She seduces Wolverine (sadly without discovering whether he's 100-percent adamantium ). She destroys some more. Then she stands around for too much of the film in a state of catatonia, like a babe in a nuclear Robert Palmer video.
Still, you have to hand it to the movie for even going near this Phoenix business. In the comic, the story line called to mind a nutty mix of Freud, Euripides, and Sylvia Plath. ``Last Stand" takes us back to Professor X and Magneto making a house call to the boundlessly powerful young Jean. For her own good, the professor -- like human lithium -- has blocked her dark potential. Now she wants off the drug.
Meanwhile poor Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can't touch another's flesh without causing pain, may get the reassignment shot so she can kiss her boyfriend, Iceman (Shawn Ashmore ), before he runs off with the nice girl (Ellen Page ) who can walk through walls. And Kelsey Grammer , ideally cast as the erudite, furry, Ty-D Bowl blue Beast, is fighting for mutant rights as a member of the president's cabinet.
At a comparatively slender 108 minutes, the movie manages to cram in even more, without producing outrage at the short shrift some characters will get. Frankly, I wanted more Shohreh Aghdashloo , playing some doctor at Worthington labs. And why don't the filmmakers stop fussing with Halle Berry's wig and give Storm a plotline more flattering than glorified den mother?
Despite all the activity, this is uncommonly careful moviemaking, and some credit should go to director Brett Ratner. The man who brought us ``Red Dragon" and those ``Rush Hour" movies came aboard the project after Bryan Singer left the series to launch next month's ``Superman Returns." (That has to make Singer the Johnny Damon of comic-book movies.)
Those terrified that Ratner would bring to ``X-Men" the sort of hackwork that Tim Story foisted upon last summer's ``Fantastic 4" will be pleased to know that he acquits himself nobly.
Some images, such as self-loathing mutants, like Rogue, braving protesters to abort their powers, are solemn and evocative. Meanwhile, the battle sequences, always the least exciting, most obligatory feature of the first two movies, seem to have something at stake -- namely the lives of the characters. My heart goes out to heroes who believe a summer movie is worth dying for.


         Of the many things I have enjoyed over the course of the "X-Men" franchise, the regular, dead-serious use of the word "mutant" has been my favorite. "Mutant" is the champagne of teen insults, and "X-Men" holds a special place as the paragon of teen misfit angst dramas. To hear Patrick Stewart purr the handle in his velvety tones is especially satisfying; here, finally, is an oppressed minority that doesn't bother fiddling with politically correct terms when it has bigger things to worry about.
 
  In "X-Men: The Last Stand," which delivers on all the momentum and pathos of the first two installments, mutants have made significant political strides, even gaining official representation in the form of the blue, furry Dr. Henry McCoy (Kelsey Grammer), who has been named secretary of Mutant Affairs. What they don't have yet is a cringe-inducing PC name — but give them time.
 


         






    Political strides notwithstanding, the anxious standoff between humans and mutants has reached a crisis point, and the slow-building momentum of the last two installments finally reaches escape velocity. The mutants, as ever, are divided between two camps. On the one hand, there are the militant followers of Magneto (Ian McKellen), who see a war between humans and mutants as the inevitable conclusion to their uneasy draw. On the other, the reform-minded followers of Dr. Charles Xavier (Stewart), who believe in working within the system (hence the hairy representative). But they now face a new, tenebrous evil whose potential for harm is cloaked in good intentions. A "cure" has been developed by a pharmaceutical company that can divest the mutants of their special powers. It's the anti-weirdo vaccine, basically. Welcome to straight camp.
 
  Wouldn't you know it, the scientist who developed the cure, Dr. Worthington (Michael Murphy), has a mutant son himself. His name is Warren (Ben Foster), and he's a sulky, effeminate boy whom we first meet while he's locked in a bathroom trying to saw his own wings off. The boy has the span of an archangel, but dad fails to see the advantages. "Not you too!" has to be one of the last phrases a kid wants to hear coming from Papa's mouth; right up there with, "Your mother and I have something to tell you" and "We sent your college fund to the reverend."
 
  Anyway, that's the issue at large. The issue at home is more personal, stemming from the loss of Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the cucumber-cool smarty-pants who sacrificed herself for the good of the team at the end of the last episode — sorry, film. At Xavier's Academy for Gifted Youngsters, there are some pretty devastated middle-age-sters skulking around, namely Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), grumpier than ever, and Cyclops (James Marsden), who can't stop crying. He also can't get Jean out of his head. Literally. She calls to him incessantly, until he treks back to Alkali Lake and conjures a very dramatic reunion.
 
  But before that happens, "X3" kicks off with an origin story of sorts for Jean. Twenty years earlier, back when they were still palling around, Xavier and Magneto personally recruited the world's only known Class-5 mutant to their school, like a couple of Duke basketball coaches. Wooing the precocious 10-year-old in her parents' living room at the end of a suburban cul-de-sac, they watched in amazement as she levitated every car in the neighborhood. Not trusting even someone as brainy and self-possessed as Jean to control her own abilities, Xavier devised a system to keep them under his control. In a rather paternalistic maneuver, he has diverted them to her subconscious, where they remain latent. The Jean we've come to know and love, in other words, turns out to be kind of like one of those newfangled stay-at-home moms who wax elegiac about hot meals — only not quite as regressive. The new 
Jean, now called "Dark Phoenix," is a pale, black-eyed libidinous type whose fits of temper tend to result in the instant pulverization of men who try to stop her. Magneto, it turns out, is more of an enlightened type than Xavier. He'd like to see his girl gone wild — and on his payroll.
 
  It's been pointed out all over the place that the mutant concept in "X-Men" is particularly applicable to the gay experience, a metaphor that was cleverly pinged and poked in the films directed by Bryan Singer. In the third installment, which benefits substantially from their momentum and built-up pathos, another potentially powerful, feared and oppressed group is added to the list. At first, I worried about Brett Ratner taking over the franchise at such a climactic moment in the series. (I say that as someone who sat through "After the Sunset.") And my fears were temporarily stoked during an early action sequence in which Storm (Halle Berry, still underused), Wolverine, Cyclops, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and newcomer Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) duke it out against a monster machine, yelling all the action movie clichés at one another. (The battle turns out to be a simulation, after which the dialogue is free to find its higher level again.) But here, Ratner seems to have found a theme that he can relate to: A terrifying trio of angry, undomesticated women who all but run away with the movie.
 
  Rogue is as moody and tortured as ever, still trying to figure out a way to have a relationship with nonthreatening Bobby/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) without killing him (her dewy skin has the unfortunate power to leech the life force from anybody it touches), helplessly watching as Bobby gets closer to the fetching young Kitty. Jean has gone flat-out bonkers, a premenstrual demon with an ax to grind. And the mesmerizing, slithery Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Magneto's shape-shifting sidekick, learns a hard lesson in shifting political allegiances. With this trio, "X3" enters new-ish territory, diving headfirst into the mythos of the femme fatale
. Together, they're the Furies for the Hollywood age.
 
  Cyclops may weep and Wolverine moon for good-girl Jean Grey, but as Dark Phoenix, Janssen is infinitely more interesting than she was before. She's a raging id with the power to whip off Wolverine's belt buckle with a single dirty thought. (Later, she obliterates his pants with her mind.) She also has the power to get into her lovers' heads and drive them crazy, like a siren or the "hot psycho chick" of legend. Rogue is still swooningly goth and gloomy as the archetypal toxic girlfriend, and Mystique is hilariously vengeful as a woman scorned. No wonder Storm is pouty. In her new, sportier hairstyle, she is given some new responsibilities and whatnot, but she's still an insipid weathergirl who doesn't seem to mesh with the group. "Why can't you see the truth? Why can't you just let it go?" Storm rails bitterly at Wolverine. "Because you love her." It's the cry of frustrated female friends of love-tortured boys everywhere, a cry that's doomed to fall on deaf ears.
 
  The conflict comes to a head during a standoff at the pharmaceutical lab, cleverly located on Alcatraz Island. Dr. Worthington has repurposed the prison to house his secret weapon: an eerie young mutant named Jimmy, played by the eerie young actor Cameron Bright. Jimmy has the power to neutralize mutants' superpowers. It's a tricky gift; the very thing that makes him part of the community is the very thing the community can't withstand. The battle for Jimmy culminates in an impressive display of powers for Magneto, who turns the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz into unmistakable tourist traps once and for all. The political future of the mutants, however, remains TBD. And that's a good thing.

When the mighty band who made X-Men: The Last Stand  strode into Cannes recently to promote the third and avowed final chapter of the Marvel Comics franchise, Hugh Jackman fluttered the hearts of Logan/Wolverine groupies everywhere by mentioning a spin-off for his rebel with adamantium claws. Clever move, that: With one throwaway comment, the star generated headlines with little more than a wink. More graceful still, he drew attention away from the diminished artistic returns of X-Men: The Last Stand , a brute-force enterprise that doesn't distinguish between cramming entertainment down our gullets like fast food (i.e., undifferentiated action, humor aimed at crotch level) and offering a good meal. And I report this both as a fan of the first two and a staunch supporter of mutant rights, especially when applied to Hugh Jackman.
Certainly something dismaying has happened in the three years since Wolverine, Storm, Rogue, Cyclops, et al. fought back so heroically against discrimination, governmental invasion of privacy, and the hated Mutant Registration Act in X2: X-Men United . Because while filmmaker Bryan Singer's exciting 2003 follow-up to his own notable 2000 launch of the comic-book saga demonstrated the surprising power of a sequel when an artist is at work, The Last Stand , directed by Rush Hour  industrialist Brett Ratner, exemplifies what can happen when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities: More items on the menu  or in this case, an even greater variety of superheroes with specialty-act powers  is not the same thing as originality of recipe.
To be sure, there's a lot on the shared plate of Jackman's Wolverine, Halle Berry's Storm, Ian McKellen's Magneto, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey, Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier, Anna Paquin's Rogue, and the rest of the irregular regulars at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. For one thing, at the end of X2 , Jean was supposedly quite dead. But it spills no secrets to note that she's insistently alive in X3  in the form of her alter ego, the voraciously destructive Phoenix, a woman even more dangerous in her out-of-control telekinetic (and, as the good doctor Freud would point out, sexual) powers than Jean was before. (In anticipation of Phoenix's rise from the ashes, writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn offer a charming flashback to an earlier time when the Class 5 mutant was a frightened suburban girl, and Xavier and Magneto were dapper, well-moisturized friends.)
An even bigger headline for the differently abled community, though, is the discovery of an antibody that can ''cure'' mutants and restore them to ''normalcy.'' But what is normal? ''You can't cure being a mutant  there's nothing to cure,'' insists Storm, making the allegorical connections to homosexuality about as vivid as a fictional character with the power to control the weather can, short of taping a PSA. Rogue, meanwhile, who complains bitterly that she ''can't touch [her] boyfriend without killing him,'' is an interested potential client; through her, the deaf-community debate about the implications of cochlear implants finds a voice. And as for Magneto the radical separatist (and Holocaust survivor), the government interest in such a homogenizing serum signals nothing less than a coming pogrom. ''They want to exterminate us!'' he declares to his followers, rallying his revolutionary forces to subdue all who would advocate tolerance and multi-culturalism, including Professor Xavier, as well as Henry McCoy  a.k.a. Beast  the charming, rational geneticist with the big head of blue fur, played with modesty, panache, and much peacock- colored prosthetic assistance by Kelsey Grammer.
This is interesting stuff. So why does The Last Stand  feel driven to dumb itself down, as if embarrassed by its own ideas? There is no time for  reflection in this overstuffed sequel  civil war, special effects involving the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge, volcanic emotions between Jean Grey and Logan, volcanic enmity between Magneto and, well, everyone. And there's no time for character charm in a production that simultaneously X-es out the old and brings on a baby-faced potential ensemble cast for X-Men: The Next Generation , including Hard Candy 's compelling Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde (who can phase through solid matter) and a super-buff Ben Foster from Six Feet Under  as the winged hunk Angel. There is, though, time for a kick-to-the-groin visual joke, following which Wolverine taunts a foe with ''Grow a pair of those.'' If The Last Stand  were more confident, the movie wouldn't need to constantly grab 'em.

 CANNES, France, May 25 — Hollywood has always had a presence at the Cannes Film Festival, though in the old days the movies were pretty good. The big studios are generally out of the high-quality movie business these days (that's why specialty divisions were invented), but as long as they remain in the star business, there will always be room for them at Cannes.  Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen, all of whom star in the generically serviceable "X-Men: The Last Stand," are three reasons that the film's director, Brett Ratner, has now walked the same red carpet as Federico Fellini and Clint Eastwood. Does this mean that we must now speak of "le cinéma de Brett Ratner"? Nah.  Manufactured from almost the finest materials available (more on that later), "The Last Stand" is the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us, some on our behalf, some not. The first films in the series — "X-Men" and "X2" — were directed by Bryan Singer, who abstained from a third go-round to direct one of the season's other big releases, "Superman Returns."  Mr. Ratner, whose previous films include "Rush Hour" and its sequel, isn't as competent behind the camera as Mr. Singer, but such niceties can be irrelevant when it comes to industrial products like these.  Once again Ms. Berry plays Storm, a weather woman who conjures meteorological mischief by raising her arms, while Mr. Jackman returns as Wolverine, a guy with an enviable immune system and a trigger temper. These good mutants, along with Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the headmaster at a mutant school whose graduates include Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Cyclops (James Marsden), battle against the bad mutants led by Magneto (Sir Ian).  Magneto's minions include Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), dipped in deep blue and very mean, along with a human flamethrower named Pyro (Aaron Stanford). New to the cast are Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Henry McCoy, a beastly gentleman covered in blue fuzz, and Ben Foster as Warren Worthington III,  born with a silver spoon in his mouth and wings on his back.  As might be expected, "The Last Stand" pretty much looks and plays like the first films, though perhaps with more noise and babe action and a little less glum.  The story this time partly turns on a new cure for the mutant gene, which pushes the series' gay metaphor without developing it in any interesting way.  After the cure is announced, there are mutant protests, government missteps and mutant self-affirmations. Magneto pulls one way, Xavier another, as news of the discovery stirs up fear and panic among the, er, mutant community. By the time Warren Worthington III soars over the Golden Gate Bridge, his white wings extended and evoking seraphic visions of "Angels in America," the metaphor of the persecuted minority has all but left the realm of the figurative.  The cure, however, is just another excuse for the mutants to mix it up, which they do in both impressive and tedious fashion. The special effects look expensive, certainly, though if you've seen Storm gather dark clouds once, you've seen her do it a thousand times, no matter Ms. Berry's attempts to make it seem like a third film was a smart idea. Mostly, as so often with these types of empty entertainments, you are left to wonder why companies that hire so many fine actors to run around under latex and foam and have the best technological wizardry money can buy seem to spend so little attention to the screenplay. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, are simply not mutant enough to fly.  "X-Men: The Last Stand" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Several central characters die; a few are pulverized.
The third time's not the charm in "X-Men: The Last Stand." Taking over the reins from Bryan Singer, helmer Brett Ratner delivers a wham-bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody atmospherics and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful. Robust action, the usual top-of-the-line visual effects and massive fan-ticipation worldwide all but guarantee a super-powered opening when 20th Century Fox releases the pic May 26, though less-than-Marvelous repeat biz means "Stand's" legs may fall short of the $405 million grossed internationally by "X2: X-Men United." Ancillary biz will be appreciably huge.
Taken as a trilogy (despite the door being left open, inevitably, for an "X4"), the "X-Men" pics most closely resemble the original "Star Wars" movies in their qualitative trajectory. Just as the second film in each instance repped a substantial elaboration of its predecessor's storytelling, visual richness and thematic depth, so "X-Men: The Last Stand" suffers from the same coarsened writing, diminished imagination and occasional bursts of self-parody that plagued "Return of the Jedi." 
The result, though it delivers only in fits and starts, is still sharper and more inventive than most comicbook-adapted fare, and eventually gets the job done as far as action buffs are concerned. But don't expect pic to win any new converts or satiate those fans for whom the pleasures of the franchise went beyond the purely visceral.
That's a shame, considering the tale cooked up by scribes Zak Penn (who collaborated on "X2") and Simon Kinberg, plus the portentous title, will have viewers stoked for the most cataclysmic showdown yet between mankind and mutantkind. 
Equipped with powers as thrilling to behold as they are potentially destructive, the mutant race is once again divided into two factions led, respectively, by the wise, wheelchair-bound Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and megalomaniacal, metal-controlling Magneto (Ian McKellen).
Story opens 20 years before the events of the previous film, when both men, then allies, paid a visit to a young girl named Jean Grey (Haley Ramm) and persuaded her to harness her staggering telekinetic ability.Pic then returns to the present-day setting of Professor Xavier's elite school for mutants, with lupine Logan, or Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, as testosterone-driven as ever), and weather girl Storm (Halle Berry) serving as second in command. Scott Summers, aka Cyclops (James Marsden), has been broody and out of sorts since the supposed death of girlfriend Jean (Famke Janssen) at the end of "X2." 
Dialogue early on betrays a weakness for expository quips ("Not everyone heals as fast as you, Logan"), while the poignant quandary of Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can't touch b.f. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) without sapping his life force, here plays more like adolescent soap opera.
Meanwhile, all is not quiet on the mutant front, thanks to the recent invention of an antibody that suppresses the "X gene," thus rendering explicit the previous pic's subtext equating mutation with homosexuality. Magneto responds by mobilizing a mutant army to terrorize the public until the so-called "cure" is destroyed.
Situation grows even more complicated with the sudden reappearance of Jean, seemingly alive and well. Yet sinister psychic undercurrents lead Professor Xavier to believe Jean (chillingly played by Janssen) is in fact possessed by her fiery and ultra-powerful alter ego, Phoenix. This strand of the story -- necessarily but disappointingly watered down from the comicbook's darkly compelling Phoenix saga -- should have purists in a lather.
Where Singer brought a lingering resonance to even the series' quietest moments, Ratner seems primarily concerned with breadth and speed. (At 105 minutes, pic is a half hour shorter than its predecessor.) There's a rushed, disorganized feel to the narrative, which drops and picks up subplots at random, and has no compunction about bumping off veteran characters while introducing a host of new ones.
Most important addition to the X-Men's ranks is the peaceable Dr. Hank McCoy, aka Beast (a blue-furred Kelsey Grammer), whose physical actions are almost as nimble as his intellect. Perhaps the prominence of this blue giant explains why Mystique, the similarly hued shape-shifter played by Rebecca Romijn, gets so little attention this time around.
Past complaints that the series boasts too many personalities to be accommodated within a barely two-hour feature are right on the money here, with the proliferation of new mutants like Angel (Ben Foster, beautiful enough to give Emma Thompson a run for her halo) and Jimmy (Cameron Bright), a boy with the ability to dispel mutant powers.
Only during the climax, a huge faceoff staged at Alcatraz, does pic begin to get an inventive groove on, wittily exploiting the mutants' various powers and playing them against each other. Yet even here the film feels at a loss to convey that anything truly momentous is at stake.
Visual effects supervisor John Bruno and stunt coordinators Wade Eastwood and Mike Mitchell keep the action at a reasonably high level, though without rivaling the digital polish or martial energy of "X2." Similarly, Dante Spinotti's widescreen cinematography and overall look seem brighter and flatter than their previous incarnations. Print screened at Cannes was intermittently out of focus.

If little else, the third and supposedly final entry in the X-Men  mega-franchise suggests that some moviesor at any rate some formulasare not just critic-proof, they might even be director-proof. Under the supervision of Bryan Singer , the first two X-films were compact and almost complex, snarky and soulful in equal measure. Fans of the comics applauded their geeky fidelity to the source material. Even for non-devotees, the model was not a bad one for a Bush-era summer action movie. Marvel's '60s-incubated mythology proved readily adaptable to an early-21st-century political zeitgeist. And by design, the dense, proliferating population of the X-Men cosmos, facilitated by a rotating ensemble of elaborately dyed, bewigged, and prostheticized stars in virtually cameo-size roles, short-circuits exposition and staves off boredom. While most blockbusters struggle with awkward gear shifts, slogging through deadweight plots to justify money-shot explosions, the X-Men  films, a haphazard, anything-goes assemblage of shape- shifts and mood swings, are pleasingly unburdened by the need for coherence.
All of which is to say: Not even the dreaded Brett Ratner  can fuck up the template too badly. True, even at 104 minutes, X-Men: The Last Stand  suffers from some hackish bloat. And nothing herenot even the climactic uprooting of the Golden Gate Bridge , levitated over San Francisco Bay  and repurposed as a gangway to Alcatraz  approaches the wit and bounce of X2 's terrific set pieces (Magneto's haughty jailbreak, Nightcrawler's whirling-dervish White House  attack). But thanks to lowered expectations (Ratner's previous film: After the Sunset ) and in a season of economically disastrous disaster movies, the mere fact that this Memorial Day juggernaut is not a catastrophe should spell good news for a depressed industry.
The movie opens with human-mutant relations in a queasy truce: Troublemaking Magneto (Ian McKellen ) is in hiding, his polymorphic sidekick Mystique (Rebecca Romijn ) has been detained ("We have some new prisons," the secretary of Homeland Security declares), and the administration has established a Department of Mutant Affairs, headed by the hirsute, blue-skinned Dr. Hank McCoy , a/k/a Beast (Kelsey Grammer ).
On paper, The Last Stand  boasts the meatiest hook of the three X-films. A cure for mutancy is discovered, splitting the mutant population into those who welcome a reversion to normalcy (and assimilation into society) and those who consider it a fate worse than death. Given Singer's admirably unsubtle handling of the homo subtext, which reached a touching pinnacle in Iceman's coming-out-as-mutant scene in X2 , the new film begs to be read, as Michael Musto  noted in these pages last week, as an allegory about the ex-gay movement. Ratner and his committee of writers (the screenplay is credited to Simon Kinberg  and Incident at  Loch Ness   director Zak Penn ) make a few tentative stabs at nuance. Beast, walking fur ball that he is, notes the complications of covering, given that some mutants are more visibly mutated than others. Sensitive, sulky Rogue (Anna Paquin ) is left to weigh the pros and cons of her scary power-sucking abilitiesthe biggest con being the impossibility of any hanky-panky with her boyfriend Iceman (Shawn Ashmore ).
Despite the moral and ethical quandaries implicit in its premise, the movie soon turns simplistic. Dissolving the wary alliance of the previous film, The Last Stand  reprises the age-old war between the moderates, represented by Patrick Stewart 's sedate Professor Xavier , and the extremists, led by Ian McKellen's just-shy-of-queeny Magneto. As usual, the good guys, who also include Hugh Jackman 's blandly brooding Wolverine and Halle Berry 's Storm, promoted here to some sort of academy mother hen, get a little too much screen time. With mutant rights under threat, Magneto goes cruising for fresh meatand emerges with a gang of thuggy hotheads (including Aaron Stanford 's Pyro and Vinnie Jones 's Juggernaut), dressed to resemble extras from The Warriors . The movie stacks the deck by framing Magneto as an unambiguous terrorist, who even makes his own Osama-ish videos for the benefit of news broadcasts.
More intriguing than the good-versus-evil death match is the operatic implosion of the passions and jealousies that have progressively ensnared Wolverine, Cyclops (James Marsden ), and the intense, enigmatic Jean Grey  (Famke Janssen ). A grieving Cyclops appears to summon his beloved Jean back from the watery grave where she sacrificed herself at the end of X2 except she's resurrected as Phoenix , a mad maenad who favors flowing outfits and helplessly kills the ones she loves while looking like she's nursing a fierce migraine. (Squinting and perennially backlit, Janssen seems to have modeled her vein-popping performance on Drew Barrymore 's in Firestarter .) Of course, the romantic triangle ends tragically, on a flaming pyre, no lessit's the movie's most satisfying moment, a grand articulation of the teenage truism that there is nothing more apocalyptic than impossible love.
