Is there an actor working today who looks more spent than Chris Cooper? With his rumpled demeanor and those giant bags under his eyes, the man looks perpetually tired. Tired of his lot in life, tired of all those slings and arrows, but most of all, tired of knowing he�s smarter than everyone else in the room. His is the exhaustion of contempt. A trait that serves him perfectly in Breach
, in which he plays Robert Hanssen, the brilliant real-life FBI spy whose exploits as a double agent during and after the Cold War led to the deaths of as many as 50 government agents and sources. It�s the mole story to end all mole stories. (In the film, a special agent played by Linney calls Hanssen the �worst spy in American history.� This is a misnomer, of course; if he were truly the worst spy in American history, he would have spent his years at the FBI forgetting his code names and spilling coffee all over the agency�s most expensive gadgets. Let�s go with the �most sinister spy in American history,� for clarity�s sake.) As Hanssen�s foil we get Eric O�Neill (the lightweight Phillippe), an ambitious FBI upstart assigned the task of covertly sounding out Hanssen and bringing back evidence that proves he�s as treasonous as everyone says he is. At first, O�Neill is put out by the assignment, judging it to be beneath his talents, but as the severity of Hanssen�s crimes becomes clearer, and as Hanssen proves himself to be rather clever quarry, the callow operative sinks deeper and deeper into his work, putting both his life and his marriage in jeopardy in the process. If there�s one thing I�ve learned from movies recently it�s that it�s no fun being the wife of a spy. Witness Angelina Jolie in The Good Shepherd
 and now Dhavernas in Breach
: The role of an agent�s wife is a long-suffering one, full of cold dinners, wringing hands, and a total lack of understanding as to what your husband really does when he goes off to work in the morning. Someone needs to make a movie about them. I�d love to know if they spend their entire day biting their nails while staring off into the middle distance in unlit rooms or if they save that move for when their husbands walk through the front door hours, even days, late, without so much as a phone call. (Jim Jarmusch, that great minimalist, would have a ball with such a movie. Inasmuch as Jim Jarmusch is capable of having a ball.) These days it�s going to take a pretty exceptional political thriller to top our political reality for sheer suspense and treachery, and though director Ray (Shattered Glass
) provides a few choice moments of psychological tension, nothing in his film can hope to outpace the anxiety caused by the appearance of former Attorney General John Ashcroft in its opening scene. Terrorwise, it�s all downhill from there.


"Breach" is a spy thriller that doesn't do the things spy thrillers are supposed to do. There aren't any international datelines or slinky femme fatales, no poisoned darts or state-of-the-art widgets. Actually, there is one gadget: a late-'90s Palm Pilot. But there's precious little espionage where we can see it, and that's what makes the movie such a compelling and eerily effective little drama.
The stakes, of course, could have hardly been larger. On Feb. 18, 2001 , an FBI agent named Robert Hanssen was arrested at his Virginia home and subsequently convicted of spying for Russia over a period of two decades. In exchange for money and diamonds, Hanssen provided top-level national security information and the identity of U S agents, many of whom were never heard from again. The Department of Justice called his treason "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U S history." He's spending the rest of his life in a Colorado supermax penitentiary, with no chance of parole.
Hanssen wasn't a field agent but an agency boffin -- a computer systems and technology expert who seems to have buried volcanic levels of resentment under the orderly demeanor of a devout Catholic. He was -- is -- a mystery of compartmentalization, and that is how the great, gray-faced actor Chris Cooper plays him. It's an unnerving performance, not least in the piousness that walks hand in hand with subterranean duplicity.
What isn't widely known about the Hanssen case is that it was primarily cracked by a young agent named Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe ), who was placed by the FBI in Hanssen's office as his secretary: a mole to trap a mole. O'Neill's superiors, led by agents Burroughs (Laura Linney ) and Plesac (Dennis Haysbert ), needed him to find a smoking gun. The problem was that Hanssen, paranoid by temperament and necessity, wasn't the sort to leave smoking guns lying around.
Sticking closely to the facts as they're known, "Breach" frames the issue as trust and Eric's way in as religion. Directed by Billy Ray (whose "Shattered Glass" was another pas de deux between a truth-seeker and a pathological liar), "Breach" shows the younger man jump-starting his lapsed Catholicism to seduce his boss. But how much is Eric responding to Hanssen's faith and how much to the older man's disgust with a bureaucracy that rewards yes-men and punishes the talented? What's more attractive, Hanssen's belief or his cynicism?
Phillippe's always been a slightly wooden actor, but that works for him here: We're as uncertain of Eric's allegiances as his boss is. (Eric's wife, an East German emigre played by Canadian actress Caroline Dhavernas, is even more in the dark, and the marriage predictably suffers.)
There are some neat, almost delirious scenes of suspense, most of which play against cliche. Instead of a car chase, there's a traffic jam along the Potomac: Hanssen wants to walk back to the office as Eric is getting orders by beeper to delay him. Even the film's sound design adds to the mood of overheard secrets: The off-screen zzzziip 
of a briefcase's side pockets is one of the more hair-raising moments here.
Ray is never quite sure how to treat Hanssen's faith, though, nor the knottier issue of a very Christian traitor. "Breach" barely mentions that the spy was a supernumerary in the conservative Catholic order Opus Dei, but when Hanssen and his wife (Kathleen Quinlan ) grab the younger couple's hands to say grace over dinner, the music surges like a horror film. What's it to be, then: "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "Going My Way" ?
"Breach" is more effective at leaving Hanssen's motives tantalizingly in the dark. Did the spy betray his country for the thrill, or the money, or revenge against a demanding daddy? To show the FBI he wasn't to be taken lightly? To show God? The art of Cooper's performance is that he suggests all these things at once, leaving us stranded between pity and contempt. He's a righteous nerd of a spook, and he haunts himself the most.


         Filled with tension, deception and bravura acting, "Breach" is a crackling tale of real-life espionage that doubles as a compelling psychological drama. Its core is not the minutiae of spying but the push-pull complexities of intricate human relationships, and in Ryan Phillippe, Laura Linney and especially the formidable Chris Cooper, it has the cast to bring it all intensely alive.
 
  The title comes from a clip of a Feb. 19, 2001, news conference statement by John Ashcroft that opens the film. Describing the arrest the day before of veteran FBI agent Robert Hanssen for spying, the then attorney general described "a very serious breach in the security of the United States." Which turned out to be something of an understatement.
 


         






    For in his 22 years of stealing information for Moscow, Hanssen had handed over more than 6,000 pages of documents and 26 computer diskettes, and he had also caused the deaths of agents working for this country. He did so much damage to American security that the extent of it is still classified information.
 
  It took enormous confidence for director Billy Ray (who co-wrote the script with Adam Mazer and William Rotko) to begin "Breach" this way, to voluntarily jettison the potential hook of "is he or isn't he guilty" that a lesser film would have held on to for dear life. "Breach," however, is so strong, so able to create palpable tension even though the outcome is known, that it doesn't need any extra help.
 
  One reason for "Breach's" strength is that Ray (as witness his previous "Shattered Glass," the tale of a serial fabricator who wrote for the New Republic magazine) has a gift for this kind of thing. In addition to being based-on-fact, inside-Washington stories, both films share an interest in deceptive rule-breakers who are nothing like what they seem. "I'm fascinated by duplicity and fascinated by stories that are about integrity," Ray told National Public Radio. "Everything is loaded with subtext."
 
  Perhaps because he has done this story before, Ray and his co-writers have filled "Breach" with the kind of involving situations and smart dialogue that make gifted actors grateful. You can literally feel the performers' excitement at having roles this complex. That's especially true of Cooper, though his Robert Hanssen is the character we get to know last.
 
  Introduced two months before Ashcroft's announcement is Eric O'Neill (Phillippe), an earnest, young FBI trainee happily married to the winsome Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas). He's ambitious, eager to be promoted as soon as possible, so when special agent Kate Burroughs (Linney) calls him in and says he'll be working for her on an assignment that sounds dicey, he is none too pleased.
 
  O'Neill's new job is to work for and clandestinely keep an eye on Hanssen, an agent with 25 years' service who is the bureau's most knowledgeable Soviet agent and "the best computer guy we've got." He is also suspected, Burroughs says, of kinky sexual habits. Though the audience is aware that Hanssen is also thought to be a spy, O'Neill is initially kept in the dark about this and chafes at being on some kind of "perversion detail."
 
  An actor whose charisma is of a cold, stoical nature, Phillippe is well cast as someone who will have to play a double game with a world-class double agent. And no actress is better than the accomplished Linney at personalizing smart, powerful women and making sure that nothing negative or neurotic attaches to their power.
 
  Though "Breach" takes some liberties with reality, it largely sticks to the facts of the situation, which has the young trainee matching wits with his boss on a potentially life-and-death level. Working to enhance the strong writing, directing and acting are the cool cinematography of frequent Jonathan Demme collaborator Tak Fujimoto and a score by Mychael Danna that doles out emotion in carefully controlled doses.
 
  Good as all these aspects are, however, it is Cooper as the infinitely complicated and contradictory Hanssen who dominates "Breach" the same way the man he portrays ran roughshod over his own world, setting the rules and demolishing them with equal aplomb.
 
  Though slight in stature, Cooper's Hanssen is such a formidable presence he terrifies everyone he comes into contact with. Ferociously smart, ruthless and abrasive with a reflexively suspicious mind, Hanssen almost literally grinds people up. And despite his espionage activities he is a devout Roman Catholic, a happily married, hard-core conservative (Kathleen Quinlan has an effective cameo as his wife) who disapproves of women in pantsuits and despises godless communism. He was ultimately such a mystery to those who knew him that his pastor was quoted as saying, "I guess I will have God first explain the Trinity to me, and then Bob Hanssen."
 
  It is part of Cooper's success with Hanssen's character that he, in a sense, plays all his contradictions as if they don't exist, casually creating layers of complexity as if they were the most natural things in the world. As his past work, including his Oscar for "Adaptation," demonstrate, Cooper has a great gift for bringing a fierce reality to his characters, and his bear of a performance here more or less leaps off the screen and throttles you. As much as we thought we knew how good an actor this man is, "Breach" makes us think again.

In his remarkable 2003 debut feature, Shattered Glass , the director Billy Ray never quite came out and explained why Stephen Glass, the ambitious young New Republic  reporter who made up articles out of whole cloth, did what he did. Yet watching Hayden Christensen's super-sharp performance, you saw how Glass built each ghost of a lie around a childlike need for approval, and the result was a generational X-ray into a new kind of office sociopath  a suck-up so pathological that he made his needs more important than reality. Now Ray has directed his second film, the abysmally titled Breach , and it's a bona fide companion piece, another true-life tale of duplicity gone secretly insane.
Chris Cooper, with his still-water intelligence and his tender grimace, plays Robert Hanssen, the veteran FBI agent who was arrested on Feb. 18, 2001, after having spent his career selling secrets to the Russians  notably the identities of three KGB operatives-turned-moles, two of whom were killed. Ryan Phillippe is the agent-in-training who is assigned, as an internal spy, to be Hanssen's assistant. Just as  Shattered Glass  swirled around the intrigue of office politics, Breach  takes the form of one of those boss-from-hell scenarios (Swimming With Sharks , The Devil Wears Prada ). Cooper plays Hanssen as a stiff-necked, morose puritan who can scan a personality like a data sheet. A walking enigma, he hectors his new aide even as he treats him like family; he attends Mass each morning, hating what he calls the godless culture of the former Soviet Union, but he's also a closet voyeur who makes secret sex tapes of himself and his wife. Never does he seem more patriotic than when he's slamming the careerist bureaucracy of the FBI.
So why did he do it? Ray, once again, never comes out and says, but in Breach  the refusal to explain lacks the resonance it had in Shattered Glass . In truth, the movie leaves us scratching our heads. And yet, for most of it, I was held  by Chris Cooper's dour portrayal of walled-off demons, by the director's fascination with a deception that, on the surface of it, doesn't add up. The next time, he should be a little less shy about doing the math.

 When John le Carré appropriated a nursery rhyme for his 1974 book about spies and spy-catchers, he borrowed just three words, “tinker, tailor, soldier,” then sexed up the whole thing by adding a fourth word, “spy.” The new film “Breach,” about the F.B.I. counterintelligence agent Robert Philip Hanssen, who sold secrets to the Soviet Union and later Russia for more than two decades, suggests that it’s time to dust off the rest of that same rhyme: “rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.” Now in prison, where he’s serving a life sentence, Mr. Hanssen was a little of each; he was also greedy, pathetic, malevolent — a creep’s creep.  In the spring of 2002, an assistant director at the F.B.I. explained Mr. Hanssen’s success as a spy this way: “Succinctly put, security, other than physical security, was not inculcated into the culture as a priority that must be practiced, observed and improved upon every day.”  No kidding. For many of the 25 years he worked at the F.B.I., he  covertly thrived in that culture, like a stealth malignancy. On the February 2001 morning of his arrest, he attended Mass at a Roman Catholic church where the services were in Latin and many in the congregation belonged to Opus Dei. Later that day, he dropped a garbage bag stuffed with intelligence secrets in a Virginia park not far from his home.  One of the strengths of “Breach,” a thriller that manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending, is how well it captures the utter banality of this man and his world. Unlike Kim Philby, an aristocratic figure who swanned across the world while passing classified British and American information to the Soviets, Mr. Hanssen, played by the stellar Chris Cooper, comes across as a middle manager type, a drone in a suit. The real double agent practiced his tradecraft in Washington and New York, not Cairo and Istanbul, and delivered the goods — more than 6,000 pages — in garbage bags secured with tape. With his weekend casuals and Ford Taurus, he might have been just another suburban dad bagging leaves.  The director Billy Ray, who wrote the screenplay with Adam Mazer and William Rotko, uses a young agent-in-training, Eric O’Neill (Ryan Phillippe), to jimmy his way into the story. (The real Mr. O’Neill, now a lawyer, served as a consultant on the film, which helps explains why it feels true in tone and texture.) Shortly before Mr. Hanssen was caught, the bureau assigned Mr. O’Neill to work for him. The younger man had been told only that Mr. Hanssen was a sexual deviant (he had some freaky habits), not that he was a turncoat. This lack of knowledge about the assignment and its dangers suits Mr. Phillippe well, largely because he always looks as if he were hiding something behind those nervous eyes of his.  Mr. Ray last directed the 2003 drama “Shattered Glass,” about that artful dodger Stephen Glass’s tarnished tenure at The New Republic. Like the earlier film, “Breach” is about secrets and lies, and smart, arrogant men waylaid by their own pride and pathologies. “Shattered Glass” has its moments, if not enough of them; as in “Breach,” Mr. Ray’s unapologetic seriousness is one of the film’s strongest assets. Even so, only a filmmaker with a naïve, blinkered view both of journalism and human nature, and with so little grasp of what can happen when youthful ambition meets institutional self-importance, could have been surprised by a Stephen Glass or reached  such dizzying heights of outrage.  The stakes are far higher in “Breach,” of course, but Mr. Ray wisely holds his indignation in check in favor of something more analytical. When he keeps it cool, the film works surprisingly well. Mr. Ray doesn’t do much with the camera, but his no-frills, almost generic visual style suits the subject. In contrast to the world of shadows and mystery Robert De Niro fashions for “The Good Shepherd,” his origin story about the C.I.A., Mr. Ray serves up a bland, anonymous corporation, one in which organizational rivals bitterly compare offices, and shrink-wrapped computers sit stacked in the harshly lighted halls. It’s “The Office” without the jokes; Kafka without the soul. In other words, it’s the F.B.I., stripped of the usual movie-made gloss.  This conception of the F.B.I. as a more bureaucratically constipated, possibly more malevolent version of, say, Microsoft, if nowhere near as securely fortified, is Mr. Ray’s masterstroke. Mr. Hanssen might well have been insane, as he himself suggested to his Soviet contacts, but he was also a worker bee. His insanity might have been hardwired into him or simply (or not so simply) a symptom of working too many years in counterintelligence, where deception and detection are the rules of the game, and pride and promotion its only rewards. Mr. Hanssen earned promotions, but perhaps never enough to suit his pride. Certainly it wasn’t enough for his bank account: Kim Philby spied for  Communism; a real capitalist, Mr. Hanssen earned $1.4 million.  Mr. Ray doesn’t explain Mr. Hanssen; rather, he offers us symptoms and secrets, procedures and routines, as well as a fundamentally banal man who, in any other job, would have been just another Walter Mitty. Mr. Hanssen used various aliases during his spy days, including the improbable Ramon Garcia. (As if sensing his neediness, the Soviets gave Ramon love and money: “Congratulations on your promotion. We wish you all the very best in your life and career.”) Mr. Cooper, who looks more like a Robert than a Ramon, keeps his face pulled in tight for much of the film, like a fist held firm to his chest. He rouses our curiosity but never solicits our pity. It’s enough that he and Mr. Ray make this monster human.  “Breach” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some mild adult language and a few scenes with guns.

Just as somber as "The Good Shepherd," the most recent domestic spy drama, but more tightly focused, "Breach" absorbingly zeroes in on how the FBI nailed the most damaging turncoat in American history. Efficiently and clearly laid out, director Billy Ray's follow-up to his curiously similar debut film "Shattered Glass" lacks the pulse-quickening elements that would make it a real crowd-pleaser. All the same, Universal should be able to use good reviews to draw a decent audience for a picture that offers a serious-minded alternative to the general run of mindless mid-winter fodder.
In an event that was overshadowed in the wake of 9/11, veteran FBI agent Robert Hanssen was arrested and sentenced to life in prison for systematically betraying top-secret information to the Russians over a 22-year period.
A devoted family man and devout Catholic (Opus Dei takes another hit here), Hanssen passed along exceptionally sensitive information, including where the president and other top officials would be hidden in a dire national emergency, as well as the identities of American spies within the Soviet military intelligence hierarchy, some of whom are known to have been executed as a result.
Hanssen's activities were only confirmed after a long investigation, and the script by Adam Mazer, William Rotko and Ray takes a methodical approach that assumes the point of view of Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe), the young aspiring agent planted with Hanssen as his new assistant to gather information on the older man without knowing the true intent of the probe. Rather, O'Neill is told by his superior, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), that Hanssen is a sexual pervert who needs close scrutiny.
O'Neill has ambitions and a nice wife (Caroline Dhavernas) meant to flesh him out a bit, but for dramatic purposes, the greenhorn mostly serves to provide a window onto the story's truly fascinating center, Hanssen himself.
Dressed most of the time in suit and dark topcoat, Hanssen is an enigmatic character Chris Cooper wonderfully constructs with small details across the arc of the picture.
When O'Neill first meets him on the job, Hanssen's new position as head of "information assurance" has him developing an impenetrable database for the bureau, and the older man is deliberately intimidating. But their shared Catholicism personalizes the relationship, and when Hanssen decides O'Neill and his East German-born frau need more religion in their lives, he invites the young couple to join him and his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) at a Latin mass and later at their home.
Hanssen also begins mouthing off about the bureau's insufficiencies, its blunders and lack of know-how. All through the Cold War, he maintains, the Russians were smarter and more determined than the Americans, but lost because they were godless. His overbearing religiosity notwithstanding, the seasoned pro's observations and criticisms make so much sense to O'Neill that he comes to greatly admire Hanssen and consider the investigation a waste of time.
At the 45-minute mark, the dynamics shift when Burroughs tells O'Neill the true nature of his mission. Problems ensue at home when O'Neill can't tell his wife what he's up to, he must keep Hanssen occupied while the latter's office and car are examined, and the question lingers of when the ever-suspicious, ultra-observant Hanssen might realize they're on to him.
Despite these opportunities, Ray never ratchets up much narrative tension or a tingling sense of cat-and-mouse. Oddly, given the dramatically higher stakes in "Breach," the brazen audacity of the devious young journalist in "Shattered Glass" -- in which central character got away with writing falsified articles for the New Republic -- created a greater sense of how-did-he-get-away-with-it wonderment than does this essentially after-the-fact account of a master spy's deceptions. In fact, upon learning that Hanssen once led an inhouse investigation of a suspected FBI mole who was none other than Hanssen himself, one wonders if that might not have been a more intriguing movie than this one (see "No Way Out").
But Cooper keeps things interesting, even riveting. Stern-faced and sometimes odd in his movements -- in a very nice touch, he sometimes crowds O'Neill into bumping into things when they walk together -- Hanssen mostly looks at people askance, as if skeptically sizing them up, waiting to seize upon a weakness. A lifetime of surveillance, scrutiny and suspicion, one senses, has formed this physical posture, and his discomfort at having a formal photograph taken speaks volumes about how he can't abide having the lens turned upon him.
When he is finally apprehended, Hanssen readily spills to the arresting agent (Dennis Haysbert) the possible reasons an agent would become a traitor. But in one of the screenwriters' better judgments, these reasons remain entirely speculative, leaving the viewer with plenty to chew on.
Phillippe does a decent, straight-ahead job as a relatively ordinary young man who has a form of greatness thrust upon him, while the resourceful Linney supplies her one-dimensional role with a welcome layer of self-deprecation.
Sufficient Washington, D.C., location shooting gives the proper sense of place to a picture mostly lensed in Toronto. Production values are solid, and Mychael Danna's subdued piano-dominated score accentuates the spare, blue-gray wintry atmosphere.


In December 2002, ABC's 20/20  ran a story on Eric O'Neill , an undercover surveillance specialist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation . The piece was titled "Spycatcher," because it was O'Neill who, at a mere 27 years old, helped bring down Robert Hanssen , an FBI agent who, for more than two decades, sold thousands of secrets to the Russian government. FBI agents told ABC  that O'Neill was but a bit player in the Hanssen investigation; there were 500 others on the case, which was personally run by FBI director Louis Freeh . But none of them were situated inside Hanssen's office and ordered to steal his Palm Pilot  and download all the KGB  contacts stashed therein. And none of them have had movies made about how they helped arrest "a traitor of unparalleled dimension," as David Vise  wrote in his book The Bureau and the Mole  .
O'Neill, played by dead ringer Ryan Phillippe  in Billy Ray 's low-key Breach , was Hanssen's photonegativea baby-faced go-getter trying to work his way up the ranks, a kid who loved his former job as an alleyway shadow trailing suspected terrorists. Hanssen, on the other hand, was a burned-out veteran who, as early as 1980, had grown bitter toward the agency, which he considered full of Neanderthals who didn't understand or appreciate his genius. Hanssen wasn't merely a traitor, he was also a thrill-seeker, an Opus Dei dreaming Catholic with a penchant for strippers and a thing for posting to the Web sexually explicit fantasies about his wife Bonnie.
Breach , which details Hanssen's final days as a turncoat, plays like a sequel of sorts to Billy Ray's last film, Shattered Glass , about the fabulist Stephen Glass , fired from The New Republic   for proffering fiction as fact. Only this time, Ray need not stretch too far to give his story weight; he need not remind people that "The New Republic  is the in-flight magazine of Air Force One " in order to justify telling the story of a twerp who did some egregious shit. This is the FBI we're talking about, and Hanssen, played here by Chris Cooper  with stolid, brute force, was a certified bad manand a mesmerizing one as well, despite his being known as "The Mortician" within the bureau for his deadly dull demeanor. Cooper plays him as history has portrayed him: a sneering, self-righteous counterintelligence genius whose Nowhere Man exterior belied a darker truth.
Phillippe, up to now seeming like a minor-leaguer swinging a small stick in the bigs, is perfectly cast as O'Neill, who got lost in bureau offices the first day he was assigned to work undercover as Hanssen's assistant. He positively shrinks in Cooper's estimable presence; there are moments when you forget he's even in the scene. Everyone in the film, including O'Neill's direct supervisor, Kate Burroughs  (Laura Linney ), speaks to him like he's incapable of deep thought. Initially, Burroughs even lies to O'Neill when giving him the assignment, telling him that Hanssen's under surveillance because he's a sexual deviant, not a man giving the names of U.S. spies to the Russians so they can kill them.
Like the inferior The Good Shepherd , whose release late last year caused Universal to bump Breach  to the February graveyard, this is a spy movie bereft of the genre's usual, casual kicks. It's not interested in cheap thrills or playing gotcha with the audience. (Which isn't to say parts of it aren't exhilarating: The scene during which Hanssen's colleague spirits him off to the gun range so O'Neill can steal the Palm Pilot is boilerplate suspense but effective.) But Ray's more interested in dissecting the relationship between O'Neill and Hanssen, who resists the kid initially but then takes him in as one of his own, insisting that they go to church together and inviting him into his home. As his affection for the boy grows, Hanssen ends up trusting the last person on earth he ever should have.
The movie does not and cannot hide its ending. The finale is referenced in the very first scene, when John Ashcroft  speaks to the media about Hanssen's 2001 arrest near a footbridge in a Virginia park, where he was dropping off a cache of documents for his KGB contacts. But Ray, a storyteller in love with liars he wants to hate but cannot, doesn't need a surprise ending. The real one's heartbreaking enough: a tragic love story between the ticked-off traitor who thought he'd found a kindred spirit and the true believer who didn't want to admit that his father figure was one of the world's most dangerous men.
