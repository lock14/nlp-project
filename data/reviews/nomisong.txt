         Twenty years after the term New Wave was used to describe the iconoclastic French cinema of the late 1950s and early '60s but before the name became a commercially viable radio format in the '80s, it described the avant-garde hipsters of Lower Manhattan.
 
  Gentler than punk and edgier than disco, its sonic contemporaries, New Wave encompassed an array of music as well as fashion, performance and visual arts in a scene that attracted creative misfits and outcasts from across the country and around the world who migrated to New York to reinvent themselves. Brash, vibrant and colorful, it was a subculture that blurred the lines of gender, sexuality and race with an emphasis on outrageousness over aptitude.
 


         






    Andrew Horn's alluring documentary, "The Nomi Song," looks at the meteoric career of singer Klaus Nomi, who at once epitomized the New Wave with his outlandish space alien appearance and stood apart with his wraith-like, operatic renditions of pop music.
 
  Born Klaus Sperber in 1944, the slight young man with a dramatically receding hairline arrived in New York in the mid-1970s when it was the nexus for disenfranchised, alienated young artistic types. He studied opera but shunned his natural countertenor, preferring to sing in a disarming falsetto.
 
  Eventually, he found himself performing in a downtown New Wave vaudeville show, where his extraterrestrial persona landed fully formed and was embraced by his fellow outsiders. A rock band was created to back him, and the shows and his outfits were designed to exploit his camp appeal.
 
  A club sensation, his career alternately exploded and sputtered. He bombed in New Jersey opening for Twisted Sister but was a hit on a Midwest tour. Nomi appeared on "Saturday Night Live," singing backup for David Bowie, and a record deal led him back to Europe, where he recorded albums and made videos, but superstardom eluded him before he died of an AIDS-related illness in 1983.
 
  Initially, Horn does a good job of providing a timeline, but as the film progresses it's a little difficult to track whether events are taking place over weeks, months or years. It's a quibble, however, compared to the compelling story the filmmaker presents. The interviews feature Nomi contemporaries, such as actress-performance artist Ann Magnuson and painter Kenny Scharf; as well as collaborators Kristian Hoffman, musical director of the Nomi Show; and Page Wood, the group's original drummer and art director.
 
  Horn is adept at getting people to tell stories that do not necessarily reflect well on them, yielding a more intimate and revealing documentary. "The Nomi Song" also benefits from a plethora of archival performances and a genuinely eclectic soundtrack. Horn, who knew Nomi, does an excellent job of evoking the exhilaratingly hedonistic period the film covers as well as the long shadow that the coming of AIDS casts over it.

he Nomi Song" chronicles the short and haunting life of Klaus Sperber, a trained classical singer from Essen, Germany, who came to New York as a young man in the late 1970's. Sperber took the name Nomi as part of his personal mythology, and soon caused a sensation on the underground art scene with his elfin, androgynous appearance, outrageous costumes and soaring countertenor voice. He concocted an extraordinary stage persona from fragments of 20th-century pop culture: postwar Berlin cabaret, 50's science fiction films and the emerging new wave in music and fashion. In 1978 Nomi made four now legendary appearances in a "New Wave Vaudeville" show at Irving Plaza, singing Saint-Saï¿½ns arias in a flawless falsetto while wearing Kabuki-like makeup and a see-through vinyl cape. Soon Nomi was the toast of downtown, appearing at sites like Max's Kansas City and making two pop records before his death of AIDS at 39 in 1983. In both his personal and professional life, Nomi remained an enigmatic, at times otherworldly figure. In a clip from a New York cable-access television show, he remains in character (not to mention costume and makeup) as he shows the audience how to bake his lime tart. (His famously delicious confections became currency in the barter between flat-broke artist types.) We see him singing backup behind David Bowie on "Saturday Night Live" in a performance so stylized that it still looks fresh two decades later. Perhaps because of the obsessive propensity of 80's urban scenesters to document their own lives on the emerging medium of video, Andrew Horn's documentary manages to tap into an unusually rich vein of archival material, from home movies to taped live performances to early music videos with hypnotically crude special effects. Mr. Horn also interviews some of Nomi's contemporaries, including the performance artist Ann Magnuson and the painter Kenny Scharf, who recalls living in a building that faced onto Nomi's apartment and hearing the singer's arias wafting through the courtyard on summer days.  "The Nomi Song" is an affectionate portrait, not only of Nomi, but also of the long-gone days when downtown Manhattan was an affordable enclave for creative misfits. The end of "The Nomi Song" is harrowingly sad, as at least three of Nomi's friends guiltily recall failing to visit him as he lay dying of the mysterious disease then known as "gay cancer.

"The Nomi Song" is an absorbing homage to obscure but fascinating late '70s-early '80s German stage artiste Klaus Nomi. As with helmer Andrew Horn's previous pic, "East Side Story," a tribute to Warsaw-pact musicals, the new docu sports a trove of archival footage and frank contempo interviews with friends and collaborators. Nomi died of AIDS-related illness in 1983. Like Charles Atlas' doc, "The Legend of Leigh Bowery," about a similar character, pic could do niche theatrical biz in metrosexual-friendly cities before screening on upmarket TV slots and transfer to DVD. 
Born Klaus Sperber in Bavaria, 1944, Nomi trained as an opera singer and made his way to New York just in time for the burgeoning downtown underground scene centered around Max's Kansas City. Performance artist Ann Magnuson recalls how Nomi debuted his act -- singing countertenor opera tunes, dressed in extraordinary costumes with a white face and thick makeup -- at the first gig of the "New Wave Vaudeville Show," a cabaret where Nomi met several of his future collaborators, including producer Kristian Hoffman and art director Page Wood.
Nomi maintained his monochrome look onstage and off, so much so that photographer Anthony Scibelli, whose striking snaps of Nomi are included here, notes Nomi was "the first person I'd ever met who'd been chemically treated to become black and white." Performing an eclectic repertoire of both original material and idiosyncratic covers, from arias to pop, Nomi quickly became a fixture on the NYC club scene.
When David Bowie asked him to help design costumes and sing backup for him on "Saturday Night Live," (excerpts from which are shown), Nomi looked set for a national breakthrough. But a disastrous attempt at a tour sent him back to New York practically almost as soon as the tour began.
Interviewees candidly recall Nomi's prima donna moments, how he dropped old friends and collaborators when success seemed within grasp, and his persistent loneliness. His much-hoped-for crossover from avant-garde character to recording star only really happened in Europe. A sound-only interview with Nomi's beloved elderly aunt, Trude Sperber, is accompanied by inventive visuals showing a dolls' house and cutaways to his home town, which bring to life the tristesse of his last visit, by which time he knew he was seriously ill.
Pic's moving last act deals sensitively with his lonely death from AIDS, one of the first celebrity victims of what was then called "the gay plague."
Although bookended with clips from vintage '50s sci-fi "It Came From Outer Space" to underline Nomi's fascination with retro futurism and alien personae, "The Nomi Song" sports a less camp sensibility than one would expect given subject's outre lifestyle.
Pic's crunchy visual texture is made up of an assortment of footage, including 35mm, 16mm and Super8 Sound stocks, plus Betacam, U-Matic and Portapack footage. Editing by Angela Christlieb (co-helmer of docu "Cinemania") and Guido Krajewski moves story niftily along, making for a dense but diverting 99-minute running time. Sound by Alexandra Baltarzuk brings out the best from the problematic archival footage, seemlessly marrying what at times appear to be separate music and visual tracks.

Framed with bits of It Came From Outer Space  (1953), Andrew Horn 's portrait of Klaus Nomi  (1944-83) takes for granted the notion of this no-wave performance artist as an inexplicable alien.
Nomi's white pancake makeup, black bee-stung lips, alarmingly sculpted coiffure, and severely, albeit hilariously, geometric outfits suggested a constructivist Pierrot or a Weimar android or perhaps an imploded, one-person version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show . A trained countertenor, the German-born Nomi sang pop songs as if they were grand opera. His affect, however, was blatantly artificial. Smiling sweetly, Nomi widened his eyes and cocked his head, emphasizing his performance with the herky-jerky movements of an enchanted marionette. His was a persona that astonished Club 57 hipsters and ordinary citizens alike. Spotting this uniquely stylized creature on the street, one scene survivor recalls, "People said 'What is that?'Ânot 'Who is that?' "
Horn's previous documentary, East Side Story , an essay on Communist musicals, was itself a sort of musical, and The Nomi Song   is correspondingly generous with Nomi performancesÂincluding his trademark covers of material originally made famous by Lou Christie  and Marlene Dietrich . Horn several times repeats the ecstatic purity of Nomi's 1978 star-is-born debut, when he stunned the downtown audience that had filled Irving Plaza  for Ann Magnuson 's "new wave vaudeville" show with his falsetto aria. The Nomi Song  is better at evoking a particular bohemia than at getting inside its subject's head. (This humanoid music box was, somebody says, "one of the loneliest persons on earth.")
Still, although more wistful than campy, The Nomi Song  is not without a certain showbiz drama, supplied mainly by the story of the star's not quite making it. Nomi appeared with David Bowie  on Saturday Night Live   in late 1979 and, soon after, opened (disastrously) for Twisted Sister  in New Jersey. The artist returned to Europe, whereÂfronting a more commercial bandÂhe enjoyed wider success, if only briefly. As much as anyone in the early '80s, Nomi was ready-made for MTV  crossover. But as an early AIDS casualty, he would be part of another, less fortunate vanguard.
Nomi's particular retro-futurist post-punk synthesis, cartoonish cabaret persona, homemade special effects, high-pop aspirations, and tantalizing near success made him a legendary figureÂif not an iconÂof downtown bohemia. He has a corner spot in the performance component of the New Museum's current "East Village USA" show, but that scarcely does him justice. Made with considerable wit and style, Horn's thoughtful celebration of the era and its most uncanny diva could function as the show's supplement.
