         With his velvety baritone and his sour puss (you half expect him to leave a trail of lemon husks, sucked dry, in his wake), Alan Rickman is the ideal actor to play a very particular kind of brooder — fierce but harmless, in pain but blessed with a high threshold for it. In Marc Evans' "Snow Cake," sensitively directed from a witty, personal screenplay by Angela Pell, Rickman plays Alex Hughes, a mysterious Englishman making his way across Canada having been recently released from prison, where he landed after killing someone. Whatever the circumstances of the crime, he doesn't look like the type. Eventually it's revealed that he's not — though he does seem to attract the kinds of repeat experiences that border on symbolism.
 
 At a moose-themed roadside diner, somewhere in darkest Ontario, Alex is approached by a spunky teenager named Vivienne (Emily Hampshire). She talks him into giving her a lift home and he reluctantly agrees. Not long afterward, Vivienne is dead in an accident, and a guilt-stricken Alex, who was on his way to meet the mother of the son he never knew he had, feels compelled to pay a visit to Vivienne's mother, Linda (Sigourney Weaver), who lives in an obsessively well-kept house in a tiny, remote town.
 


         






   As Alex soon discovers, Linda is autistic; she's capable of looking after herself but unable to process her daughter's death emotionally. This causes some consternation among her neighbors, who doggedly insist that Linda react in the usual way to their rote condolences and giant bereavement cookies. But the only person Linda seems to want around is Alex, and his guilt compels him to stay until her elderly parents, who have gone on a wilderness hike, can be contacted.
 
 "Snow Cake" unfolds over a few days, during which the autistic woman and the emotionally sealed-off man come to form an unlikely bond. Alex learns to adjust to Linda's peculiar rules and gradually takes on a parental role for Vivienne posthumously. A more likely bond is soon formed between Alex and a mysterious neighbor, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who lives next door. The three constitute a kind of holy triumvirate of affective unavailability — one cultural (his "English reserve" is alluded to more than once), one clinical and one apparently cultivated. Mysterious as Alex remains throughout the movie — other than having a wealthy brother who hates him, we end up knowing nothing about Alex's life except for some momentous but oddly parenthetical events involving his surprise son — it's Maggie who turns out to be the hardest to fathom. Her isolation is willed and, it seems, slightly perverse. She refers to her romantic partners as "gentleman callers" and doesn't feel the need to promote them to anything else.
 
 Weaver is eerily affecting as a grown woman with the undeveloped affect of a small child, though in her own way she senses a kindred spirit in Alex from the start. She tells him that Vivienne, who had wanted to be a writer, had a habit of befriending the loneliest people she could find, because they had the best stories to tell. Alex's story, though it's eventually revealed in teased-out driblets, remains more or less shrouded in obscurity. But Rickman's performance is nuanced and intriguing enough to make his character engaging and compelling.
 
  Modest but well wrought and witty, "Snow Cake" is full of unexpected moments and clever observations and, despite a sparse quality, makes a good case for the idea that you're never too late, or too far gone, to connect with or understand others.

 In “Snow Cake” Sigourney Weaver peels off layers of urbane sophistication to play Linda Freeman, a high-functioning autistic woman living in a rural Ontario town called Wawa. With her face scrubbed clean of makeup and wearing an expression that shifts between infantile delight and childish indignation, Ms. Weaver gives a technically accomplished performance. She is so far outside her comfort zone that you scan her body language for signs of the haughty female warrior lurking behind Linda’s blank innocence. But that person is nowhere to be seen.  Linda, who supports herself stocking the shelves of a local grocery store, has phobias galore. Compulsively neat, she refuses to take out the garbage. When her dog vomits on the kitchen floor, she is thrown into a state of terror. Mostly, however, she takes joy in life. Behind the house is a trampoline on which she spends afternoons gleefully jumping up and down. A favorite winter pleasure is eating snow (hence the movie’s title).  When Linda’s temperamental opposite enters her life, “Snow Cake” turns into a sugary life lesson: a disabled person becomes a holy innocent healing sick, world-weary souls. The object of partial redemption is Alex Hughes (Alan Rickman), an embittered middle-aged Briton recently released from prison after serving time for killing a man.  It is a violent death that throws Linda and Alex together. While on the road to Winnipeg, Alex is accosted in a diner by Linda’s hitchhiking 19-year-old daughter, Vivienne (Emily Hampshire), who pesters him for a ride. He sourly agrees. Shortly after they hit the highway, his car is slammed off the road by a truck, and Vivienne dies. Guilt-stricken, although the accident was not his fault, he decides it is his duty to visit his dead passenger’s mother and deliver the news in person.  Unaware of Linda’s condition, Alex is nonplused when she shrugs off her daughter’s death. He ends up staying in her house until after the funeral. They become friends and Scrabble opponents who play the game by Linda’s wacky rules, which allow the use of nonexistent words like “dezlious.”  “Snow Cake,” directed by Marc Evans (“Resurrection Man”) from a screenplay by Angela Pell, partly camouflages the banality of its concept with its meticulous performances. Ms. Weaver is convincing precisely because she doesn’t oversell the upbeat life lessons her character imparts to Alex; a less gifted actor would grab every opportunity to promote Linda as the radiant incarnation of a live-in-the-moment, we-are-all-children philosophy. Even the name “Freeman” sends the message.  Mr. Rickman’s Alex is a pill. A scowling, baggy-eyed misanthrope whose grumbling tone and suspicious gaze convey defeat, he is occasionally capable of sardonic self-deprecation. “I don’t have baggage; I have haulage,” he remarks. “Snow Cake” coyly holds back the whys and wherefores of his imprisonment until late in the movie, when he exchanges confessions with Linda’s attractive next-door neighbor, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss).  An anomaly among Linda’s cozy neighbors, Maggie is a sex-starved divorcée who invites Alex to dinner with one thing in mind. He obliges, and they begin an affair. But Alex is so much older, and exudes such an air of crumpled exhaustion, that the relationship begs credibility.  So do a lot of other elements in “Snow Cake.” Like “I Am Sam,” it is a film that tests your cynicism. Those charmed by cute contrivances like “dezlious” may devour “Snow Cake” as eagerly as Linda munches on snow.

The dramatic icing is spread pretty thin over "Snow Cake," a small-scale, minutely observed yarn about a buttoned-up Brit and hyperactive autistic woman thrown together in a wintry Canadian township. Boosted by a delish performance from Carrie-Anne Moss as a local vamp who helps unthaw the Englishman, but holed beneath the waterline by a gratingly miscast Sigourney Weaver as the persnickety autistic, modest item looks set for equally modest B.O. Choice as the opening night film of the 56th Berlinale is surprising, to say the least.
Enjoying a quiet read in a Northern Ontario roadside diner, middle-aged Alex Hughes (Alan Rickman) grudgingly shares his table with a 19-year-old motormouth, Vivienne (Emily Hampshire). He's on his way to Winnipeg, and she's looking for a ride to her hometown, Wawa. Agreeing to take her along -- one of several niggling implausibilities in first-timer Angela Pell's script -- Alex finds Vivienne isn't fazed even when he says he's just gotten out of prison. "I killed someone," he adds. "O.K.," she replies.
On the plus side, the sheer unlikelihood of two such people ever sharing a car together does decoy the audience's attention prior to a smartly edited shock, as a large truck plows into the vehicle. Vivienne is killed instantly, but Alex survives. Though still woozy, he feels the need to tell Vivienne's mother face to face and takes a bus into Wawa.
Alex's second surprise of the day is that the teen's mom, Linda (Weaver), takes the news hardly missing a beat. Divorced of regular emotions, and obsessively tidy and logical, Linda is a "high functioning" autistic. The far more traumatized Alex ends up sleeping over at Linda's and soon finds himself drawn into her life as a temporary housemate until the funeral a few days later.
Even allowing for Linda's affliction, there's so little chemistry between the two protags that it's a relief when Alex bumps into Linda's foxy neighbor, Maggie (Moss). Maggie invites Alex to dinner, but they end up skipping the food in favor of a roll in the hay.
It's this relationship that becomes the pic's emotional core. But Maggie is essentially a supporting character and, however well she's played by Moss, it can't compensate for the yawning gap at what should be the movie's center.
Lack of dramatic intensity is all the more surprising considering the emotional clout of helmer Marc Evans' two best movies, the chilling "Resurrection Man" and scarefest "My Little Eye."
Screenwriter Pell, whose background is largely in sitcoms, has an autistic young son, and Weaver has all the small obsessions of her character down pat; but neither she nor the script give Linda much room to maneuver. Rickman, a cool actor at the best of times, takes a while to deliver a rounded perf as a guy saddled with two deaths for which he feels responsible. He does, however, rise to the script's occasional moments of wry humor, more of which would have been welcome.
It's Moss, however, who makes the picture worth seeing. Canuck thesp is aces as Maggie, without overplaying either the seductress or the lonely small-town femme. Her natural chemistry with Rickman pays dividends in their final scene, which delivers the only real emotional oomph in the movie.
Tech package is clean and composed, with Steve Cosens' photography of Wawa and Michipicoten township blending seamlessly with Toronto studio interiors. Running time could easily lose 10 minutes, and pic may play even better on the small screen.

In the kooky little Canadian town of Wawa, a stranger knocks on the door of an autistic woman to break the news that her daughter was killed while hitching a ride in his car. So begins the awkward pairing of Linda (a no-frills Sigourney Weaver ), who responds to the bad news by munching snow and focusing on shiny ornaments, and Alex, a taciturn fellow (Alan Rickman who else?) whose spirit has been all but snuffed out by past trauma. Marc Evans 's indie drama, from a script by Angela Pell  (who has an autistic son), does sidle up to the brink of mawkishness, but it pulls back so nicely into Weaver's rich, hard-headed evocation of Linda's limitations that one forgives the eye-popping speed with which Alex, grieving for two people he's never known, re-enters the human race and falls for Carrie-Anne Moss .
