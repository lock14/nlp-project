Badly homemade popcorn balls figure in   Gentlemen Broncos . So do badly homemade garments and, especially, badly homemade science fiction written by Benjamin (Michael Angarano), a fantasy-obsessed, home-schooled Utah teen who titles his proudest manuscript Yeast Lords: The Bronco Years . Yet even as filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess wallow in the comedic possibilities of kitsch, the husband-and-wife duo dare their audience to pass judgment on the worth of those balls, those clothes, and those really bad stories. As they did in Napoleon Dynamite  and Nacho Libre , the Hesses claim to celebrate the amusing qualities of misshapen people and their misshapen dreams, insisting that amateurism and bad taste (both in filmmaking and in life) are intentional artistic choices. The audience may have bought the act in Napoleon Dynamite . But this time, the act bombs.
The one saving grace of such a relentlessly unappealing movie may be that the emperor's-new-clothes moment has arrived: Bad taste is sometimes just a vice, and amateurism in filmmaking is no virtue. In Broncos , Benjamin is sent to a teen writers' camp by his warmhearted but tasteless mother (Jennifer Coolidge   even she looks depressed by the role). And there his manuscript winds up in the hands of competing plagiarists. A pompous, formerly best-selling fantasy novelist (Flight of the Conchords ' Jemaine Clement) steals the plot for his own book, while blithely untalented young artistes (Halley Feiffer and Nacho Libre 's rubbery Hector Jimenez) cannibalize Yeast Lords  as a movie. Gentlemen Broncos  then degenerates into an aggressively crappy dramatization of Benjamin's original, dorky tale with Sam Rockwell as the hero. It's hard to distinguish between the awfulness of the character and the crudeness of the performance. So why bother?


 At one point during “Gentlemen Broncos,” a misfire from the filmmakers who brought the world “Napoleon Dynamite” and, more happily, “Nacho Libre,” I began to wonder how many evacuations a comedy can deliver before they ruin the joke. The spray of vomit that inspired this question had just shot out of the mouth of the hapless teenager at the center of the new movie, an emission preceded or followed by (I lost track) a geyser of snake feces and some nonreptilian, if equally repellent, defecation.  The problem, of course, as great gross-out comedies from “Monty Python’s the Meaning of Life” to “American Pie” have proved time and again, has nothing to do with waste matter and everything to do with timing, good jokes and characters you can laugh with and at, all mostly missing from “Gentlemen Broncos.”  Directed by Jared Hess, who wrote the screenplay with his wife, Jerusha, the film turns on  Benjamin (Michael Angarano), a 17-year-old loner who lives with his widowed mother (Jennifer Coolidge) and aspires to be a science-fiction author. He’s a rotten writer, to judge from his magnum opus, “Yeast Lords: The Bronco Years,” a turgid, rather inexplicable fantasy that’s periodically dramatized, schlock-cinema style, in vignettes featuring Sam Rockwell as the hirsute Bronco, a hero patterned after Benjamin’s dead father.  Benjamin doesn’t know he’s bad, and the filmmakers don’t admit he is either, which is part of the joke. This lack of self-awareness is the point of almost all the laughs in a movie filled with unpleasant, unattractive characters whose every facial tic and item of clothing seems contrived for yuks. That was true in “Napoleon Dynamite,” as well, but the crucial difference is that Napoleon is so aggressive and so self-assured that he doesn’t leave any room for pity. He might look funny, with his glasses, lopsided clown hair and gasping mouth, but he doesn’t behave as if he were a joke waiting for either a punch or a punch line, a disconnect between appearance and being that the Hesses smartly exploited.  In “Gentlemen Broncos,” by contrast, the characters, including the inert, enervated Benjamin, are basically lumps, even the usually reliable Mike White, who shows up with a long fall of blond hair and that incontinent snake. The film’s few bright spots are largely due to Jemaine Clement (from Flight of the Conchords, both the HBO show and the musical duo) as Dr. Ronald Chevalier, a haughty science-fiction author who wears a cellphone earpiece he never uses and dons an American Indian choker when he writes.  Chevalier enters the picture largely to furnish Benjamin some Oedipal anxiety and invest the story with dramatic tension, but he also gives the movie a spark of life because he’s the only recognizably human character around. He’s a dandy villain, and the workshop he conducts for aspiring science-fiction writers will make a terrific YouTube excerpt.    “Gentlemen Broncos” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Poop and puke (kind of says it all).

Napoleon Dynamite seems perfectly well-adjusted (not to mention downright charismatic) compared to homeschooled mama's boy Benjamin Purvis in "Gentlemen Broncos," the latest oddball character portrait from one-trick helmer Jared Hess. This time, the misfit in question is an aspiring science-fiction writer easily upstaged by his idol, a pompous (but published) fantasy author, played by "Flight of the Conchords" star Jemaine Clement like the cosmic love child of Tim Curry and Orson Welles. Pic tickled its target demo at Fantastic Fest, though it's hard to imagine Fox Searchlight reaching enough geeks in theaters to come anywhere near "Nacho Libre's" $80 million.
Returning to Utah, co-writers Jared and Jerusha Hess have concocted a fresh batch of socially awkward characters to do their comic bidding. Benjamin (Michael Angarano) inhabits a geodesic dome home with his widowed mother (Jennifer Coolidge) and desperately tries to keep his father's memory alive by writing over-the-top stories about an intergalactic hillbilly named Bronco (whose exploits we see enacted in classic '70s B-movie style by Sam Rockwell). Benjamin has one heck of an imagination but no life experience to draw from, making for strange, sexually frustrated tales of yeast harvesting and gonad extraction (excrement and testicles being the pic's two predominant motifs).
At a writers' camp for like-minded shut-ins, Benjamin meets Tabatha (Halley Feiffer) and her best friend, Lonnie, an androgynous "Pat"-like character played by "Nacho Libre's" Hector Jimenez (whose unisex wardrobe and generally inappropriate conduct offer contradictory clues as to his/her actual gender). With this pair's encouragement, Benjamin submits his "Yeast Lords" manuscript to a contest judged by his personal hero, washed-up sci-fi sensation Dr. Ronald Chevalier (Clement), who changes a few names and details before submitting it as his next bestseller.
Now called Brutus, Rockwell's character re-emerges as a tranny space cowboy in several campy cut scenes that reflect Chevalier's "improvements" to Benjamin's original vision. Without these frequent Bronco/Brutus digressions, Hess would hardly have a feature on his hands. Plot is hardly the priority in the hour or so that remains, with fanciful comic digressions (including the appearance of Mike White as an ill-advised but much-needed male role model in Benjamin's life) filling the time until he inevitably confronts Chevalier about the plagiarism.
Not unlike "Napoleon Dynamite," "Gentlemen Broncos" serve as a study of acute social retardation. But Jon Heder brought something to that character that's missing from Angarano's performance, which more closely resembles the slack-shouldered apathy of Napoleon's wingman, Pedro. As fate stacks up against him, Benjamin merely smolders in anger -- not an easy character for an audience to root for. Chevalier may amount to little more than a caricature, but he's infinitely more compelling onscreen.
The novelty, then, is Hess' eye for kitschy detail, evident in everything from the sweater Benjamin wears while hawking his mother's "country balls" to Lonnie's endearingly amateur camcorder adaptation of "Yeast Lords." While the effect is caustically misanthropic, the helmer appears to feel genuine affection for these tacky reflections of his Midwestern upbringing (much as he does for the inbred-looking extras who populate the film's supporting cast). But with no message beyond the superficial absurdity of it all, Hess is in a precarious position to be critiquing the intellect or artistry of anyone else.
The creative team has taken great care in replicating the hand-painted pulp book covers (showcased in a terrific opening credits montage), devoting a good chunk of the budget to making the special effects look as lo-fi as possible, the retro vibe echoed in such vintage tune selections as Zager & Evans' "In the Year 2525." After upgrading to a rich visual look for "Nacho Libre," Hess returns to the flat cinema stylings of "Napoleon Dynamite" d.p. Munn Powell.

Nothing if not consistent, Napoleon Dynamite   and Nacho Libre  director Jared Hess  once again presents adolescence as a depressive, outsider experience; makes light of the working class for being, well, poor; and nearly bests the Brothers Coen when it comes to drawing all of his characters from the shallow end of the gene pool. There are moments in Hess's third self-conscious cult film, Gentlemen Broncos  , that exude a fetishistic, low-fi splendor, as Hess envisions the Buck Rogers  –meets-Barbarella  fantasy world of an introverted Utah  teenager (Michael Angarano ) writing a pulp science-fiction opus. But both Yeast Lords: The Bronco Years  and the life of its author are subject to so much projectile vomit, animal flatulence, and innumerable plays on the word "anus" that even first-graders may find their tolerance tested. "You took my nads!" and "Eat the corn out of my crap" vie for their place in the catchphrase canon, and an animatronic deer fires missiles out of its ass, though it's Flight of the Conchords  ' Jemaine Clement  who handily steals the show as a bestselling fanboy scribe sky-high on his own pomposity. Hess deserves credit, I suppose, for so effectively channeling his inner seven-year-old. Personally, I preferred spending two hours in the company of Spike Jonze 's.
