 A comprehensive exploration of what has to be the handiest, most versatile and most divisive word in the English language, Steve Anderson's "****" (pronounced "****") opens just a few days after the Federal Communications Commission's reversal of an indecency ruling against CBS' "The Early Show." The FCC determined that a "Survivor Vanuatu" contestant calling another player an expletive did not constitute indecency because it was used in the context of a news show — proving once again that words such as "news show" are malleable things, subjective and open to myriad, often contradictory interpretations.
 


         






   The documentary, which naturally takes advantage of certain phonetic echoes in the word "documentary" to describe itself, explores the F-word's linguistic origins, grammatical flexibility, social history and colloquial and political uses. It puts to rest the old chestnut about its genesis as an acronym for a royal edict — "fornicate under command of the king" — which always sounded like a bit of etymological wishful thinking. It also delves into the wondrous elasticity and adaptability of a word that serves as an "intensifier," a noun, a verb, an adjective, a transitive verb and, indeed, as every word in a delicious complete sentence.
 
  Consisting of news footage and television clips, interspersed with short animations by Bill Plympton and rapidly edited talking- head interviews with figures as diverse as Sam Donaldson, Hunter S. Thompson, Pat Boone, Steven Bochco, Ben Bradlee, Chuck D and Billy Connolly, the movie focuses on the word's special place in the culture wars, where it has long been a lightning rod for debates about free speech and government regulation of expression.
 
  Most interesting is its prominent place in the history of legislation (Lenny Bruce, who was arrested twice and convicted for his refusal to stop saying it publicly) and as a bellwether for the political climate of the country. Country Joe McDonald's "Fish Cheer" at Woodstock is here, as is conservative talk-show host Dennis Prager, who characterizes the fight over the word as central to civilization's "battle to preserve itself."
 
  Often surprising and thought-provoking (the urge to euphemize is characterized as a drift away from reality), "****" is as funny and cathartic as the word it celebrates, and nearly as perversely shock-happy. Connolly, in particular, elicits belly laughs purely from his inspired intonation and glee at being asked to dwell on one of the few things in modern life that retains some measure of taboo despite its ubiquity. But the film is not as rigorous as it might have been, and eventually the pleasure it takes in its own potty-mouthed excess edges out more interesting questions. One fascinating fact it does shed light on is the alarming spike in indecency-related complaints to the FCC since 2000, coinciding with the rise of groups such as the Parents Television Council.
 
  Both sides of the aisle are given equal time to defend and condemn, although the movie clearly sides with the liberal argument. This is the funnier choice, as well as the obvious and easy one. It's somewhat undermined by the inclusion of a porn star couple whose crassness edges toward the point where even heavy and enthusiastic users of the expletive might start to discern a line. That line — the one between repression and anything goes — occasionally drifts into view, bringing up interesting questions. But the big questions take a backseat to the comedy — although, in truth, it's hard to think of a better defense of the use of the word than to ponder the possible alternatives: Boone favors "Boone!" Hearing this, Chuck D considers adding it to his repertoire.

Everyone uses the four-letter word, not many publications (including EW) print it: That's one marketing hook for this goofily overproduced, frivolous documentary, a distracted, ''hey, look, talking heads say F**K !'' examination of one of the English language's most useful utterances and why the sound packs such a friggin' wallop. Clearly meant to follow where The Aristocrats  went before with more panache, the footage includes chopped-up interviews with F-word fans, celebs, scholars, and F-averse conservatives. Best on the left: Billy Connolly. Most charming on the right: Pat Boone.

 Just to clear up any confusion: the four stars in the box accompanying this article do not represent a rave review, though I did quite enjoy the movie in question. Really, what sort of a critic do you think I am? Certainly not one who resorts to nonverbal, quantitative means of expressing opinions. This just isn’t that kind of newspaper.  Nor, however, is it the kind that will permit me to print the title of Steve Anderson’s rowdy and contentious new documentary, which consists of a single, highly versatile English word. I have been known to use the word in mixed company and even, I blush to admit, around my children — but only pedagogically, to call attention to the laxity of other drivers on family car trips. Never in front of the readers, though.  Which is as it should be. Mr. Anderson’s movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word —  its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call “infix” —  rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane. If that boundary were to disappear, who would care anymore? Allowed free rein in the pages of respectable publications —  however much my fingers may itch, at this very moment, to type its four constituent letters —  the word would quickly lose its power, its flavor, its interest. And then, lovers of the mother tongue, where would we be? Don’t answer!  “****” collects a motley panel of opinionators, who address the camera front of a black backdrop, their interviews occasionally cut together to suggest actual debate. (At one point Judith Martin, a k a Miss Manners, appears to be so disgusted with remarks made by the porn actor Ron Jeremy that she takes off her microphone and rises from her seat.) Their frequently predictable points —  protect the children; protect free speech; bless you; no, bless  you —  are sorted into chapters on history, religion, movies, politics and so on. The visual texture is varied by some amusing animations by Bill Plympton and by snippets from several movies I still can’t believe my parents took me to see.  The designated scolds include conservatives like Alan Keyes, Michael Medved and Pat Boone (who reveals that he uses his  last name as an epithet, a usage that the rapper Ice-T is later inspired to try out). They are, on the whole, pretty good sports, since they must have had an inkling that the movie, being a 21st-century documentary, would be tilted against their side. But perhaps that suspicion only confirmed their sense of the cultural landscape, in which comedians working blue and blue-state liberals conspire to spread corruption in the name of freedom.  On the other side are pornographers, comedians and other champions of desublimation, many of them worshippers at the shrine of Lenny Bruce, whose fearlessness made the comedy clubs of America into what Bill Maher calls “the freest free speech zone” in the nation. (Not all of the partisans of profanity are political liberals, by the way. And not all the advocates of restraint are right-wingers.) The movie is most interesting when it detours from polemic into analysis. Linguists and lexicographers are on hand to debunk some common misconceptions,  like  the persistent legend that the word is some kind of acronym having to do with the sexual whims of monarchs, or the idea that it appears in Shakespeare. (Rochester and Burns are another story.)  All in all, the title of the movie is invoked around 800 times, and one of its more systematic areas of inquiry is quantitative. The first Hollywood studio film in which the word was heard was “MASH,” in 1970,    and from there it was a short trip to “Scarface” (182 times), “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” (228) and the HBO  series “Deadwood” (861 utterances in the first season).  Gosh! Is this evidence of cultural decline? It’s hard to think of a short answer that wouldn’t be made more vivid by the insertion of the forbidden word. So skip it. No, not the movie. What,  are you kidding me? No way. Go. Help yourself.

From Scots national poet Robert Burns, to American comedian Lenny Bruce; from Country Joe McDonald's give-me-an-F cheer at Woodstock to "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut," the offensive word that provides the title for Steven Anderson's penetrating documentary/social critique has either enriched or infected Western culture to the point that we're either drowning in a "floodtide of filth" or blessed with the best verbal relief valve ever devised by man. The only thing clear is that this movie will have a cult following, the size of which may depend on whether it can be advertised anywhere. 
Director Anderson is out to discover where the word comes from, why it offends so many so deeply and what possible benefit can be gained from its use. Old wives' tales about the word being an acronym are explored ("Fornication Under the Consent of the King" is one theory, which is pretty much put to bed by the movie's linguistic experts). The conclusion reached is that the word's origin is unknown, but that its very mention drives certain people into spasms of righteous indignation.
"Every civilization has had to battle to preserve itself," says radio talkshow host Dennis Prager, who sees the increased use of the word as proof we're losing the battle. "Cathartic" is what TV talk show host Bill Maher calls it. While it's hard to defend the use of the word as an artistic device -- especially since Lenny Bruce long ago got most of the mileage he could out of it -- it's also hard to get as worked up about it as do Robert Peters, of Morality in Media, or right-wing watch dog Michael Medved. Although Anderson gives each side equal time, the determining factor in which side the movie leans toward is which side is the funniest. And the censorship advocates are too grindingly indignant to be funny.
Anderson plays fast and loose with his editing -- people who may never have been in the same room (all the interviewees are filmed solo) seem to be having arguments, which seems like dirty pool given some of the "exchanges." Anderson also flops his subjects on occasion, reversing the negative so that someone who was looking right is suddenly looking left (in Prager's case, the part in his hair moves from right to left). 
In terms of entertainment, the movie is consistently amusing, often hilarious, and energetic in its editing. Animator Bill Plympton's interspersed contributions sparkle with wit, as usual, and comedians like Drew Carey and wild man Billy Connolly revel in being encouraged to use the word. 
Where Anderson starts to go wrong is when he moves away from the linguistic aspects and into its visual representation. Outtakes from porn movies and interviews with porn stars Tera Patrick and husband Evan Seinfeld send the movie off track. 
Docu recovers its wits when Anderson starts following the word into the U.S. executive branch to include Dick Cheney's celebrating muttering at Sen. Patrick Leahy and the notorious vulgarity of the Nixon and Johnson presidential tapes. So despite the protestations of Pat Boone, who decries the rise of gangsta rap's vulgarity, the "no-class, low-life" behavior he bemoans has been embraced by the supposed top shelf of society. And there's no end in sight.

Twelve-year-olds might get a charge out of this purportedly daring documentary celebration of the F-word, although it never occurs to filmmaker Steve Anderson  that it might be fun or even genuinely lewd to interview kids on the subject. Instead he grants screen time to a predicable roster of pro-obscenity celebsJaneane Garofalo , Ice-T , Bill Maher , the late Hunter S. Thompson as well as some senior admirers of the expletive such as (newsflash! ) ABC's alarming Sam Donaldson . Other talking heads, one or two of them with Ph.D.'s, bid to make the doc sociological, but aside from the historically worthy identification of General George S. Patton  as a pioneering potty mouth, the film contains little or nothing in the way of surprise.
