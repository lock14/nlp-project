In his first major film venture and his largest-scale project since the conclusion of his watershed TV show in 1998, Seinfeld has made an animated movie that's only little more than "about nothing." Granted, his TV show remains such an indelible cultural landmark that no matter what Seinfeld chose to undertake as his next move, the comedian was always going to find himself in the position of being a tough act to follow. Bee Movie
 (which Seinfeld produced, co-wrote, and stars in) is a respectable follow-up � an agreeable though tame animated picture that more than does the trick but is unlikely to become a super buzz flick. When turning his persona into an animated creature, it's curious that this comic selected, as did Woody Allen with Antz
, a colonized insect whose driving impulse is to break away from the monotony of the pack. Seinfeld plays Barry B. Benson, a bee who, having just graduated from college (with "perfect grades � all Bs"), must choose a career. The opening segments of the movie which introduce us to the well-ordered life of the hive contain some of the film's most imaginative moments. Yet, visually, Bee Movie
 never fully capitalizes on the reality-bending possibilities of the animated form, settling more for some basic gags about things like the use of antennae as phone receptors and occasional references to meta-movie things like the pool scene from The Graduate
 and John Travolta's aviation skills. The film's dominant color palette is a Simpson
y yellow, and the story zips along at a fast clip so that the nifty and not-so-nifty moments are swept along in its current. Bee Movie
 works best when it sticks to the insect world; when Barry leaves the hive with the Pollen Jocks and breaks the cardinal rule of beedom by speaking to humans, the film becomes more earthbound and prosaic. Barry develops a crush on the wasp-waisted human florist (Zellweger), who saves his life and helps him mount a lawsuit against the human race for stealing the bees' honey. Unfortunately, in animated movies as in live-action movies, courtroom sequences can be plodding affairs. Even with the vocal aid of Broderick as his attorney, Goodman as the Southern windbag lawyer for the defense, and Winfrey as the presiding judge, the courtroom shenanigans devolve into silly he said/bee said arguments. Although Barry winds up winning the case, the overall consequences result in the unforeseen upending of the ecological balance of the universe. Without leaning too heavily on the message, Bee Movie
 makes a good case for equanimity among the creatures of the earth (or at least New York City, because it seems you can take Seinfeld away from television, but you can't get him to leave Manhattan). No nectar of the gods this, but we can still be thankful that Bee Movie
 is a sweet morsel that's devoid of any jokes about bee farts and poop.


If you're like me, you're heading into "Bee Movie" with your guard up. All that "Bee Movie Jr." hype for one more cookie-cutter computer-animated family flick? Why should we pay good money because Jerry Seinfeld wants to buy his kids a movie? Couldn't he just rent Disney World for a year?
So I'm surprised to report that, about 15 minutes in, "Bee Movie" started getting both to me and to my companion, a jaded 10-year-old who has seen more than her fill of limp "Shrek" sequels. The movie's not even close to Pixar
 standards - the animation is slapdash and the story construction's a mess - but the vibe is loose-limbed and fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom afterlife, I'd swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George's dad after the "Man-siere" didn't work out.
"Bee Movie" begins in an anonymous hive in which honeybee Barry B. Benson (voiced by Seinfeld) and best friend Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick) graduate high school and immediately face a drone's life at the Honex Corp. (a division of HonexCo and part of the Hexagon Group). Barry rebels and joins the macho Pollen Jocks for an outside reconnaissance.
These opening scenes are nothing special - "Antz" with a "Monsters, Inc." factory backdrop - but once Barry soars out of the hive into Central Park, the movie starts to soar with him.
The screenwriters - Seinfeld, two "Seinfeld" writers, and some other guy - have been smart enough to stick to Manhattan's Upper West Side, and "Bee Movie" turns into a shiny-happy vision of Jerry's old stomping grounds, psychologically and comedically. There's no Soup Nazi here, but there is a Honey Nazi, and he is us.
Barry immediately befriends a human named Vanessa (Ren�e Zellweger), a sharp-witted florist who takes a talking bee in stride (she's a New Yorker, she's seen everything). No, it doesn't make any sense, but quit your carping. Back at the hive, his parents (Barry Levinson and Kathy Bates) fret about this unseen new girlfriend: Is she Bee-ish? She'd better not be a WASP.
Then Barry discovers that humans sell honey in stores, exploiting his people's endless toil. Outraged - "This is stealing! And it's on sale!?" - he does what any self-respecting New Yorker would do but that, to my knowledge, no hero of a Pixar or DreamWorks Animation movie has ever contemplated.
He sues the human race.
"Bee Movie" gets seriously silly at this point, dragging in John Goodman to voice a Foghorn Leghorn-style opposing attorney in a headline-grabbing trial. Sting (voiced by Sting) also takes his lumps, as does actor Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta), who, for reasons unfathomable yet very funny, markets his own brand of Private Select honey in the film.
Not everything works. A subplot involving Vanessa's high-maintenance boyfriend, played by Patrick Warburton (Puddy!), is more frantic than amusing, and the story line will seem increasingly preposterous even to the ankle-biters. Yet there's something soothing about hearing those Seinfeld inflections again - that high, disbelieving tenor - and enough of the dialogue has a Roz Chast-style topspin that takes it out of the dreary genre ordinary. (Required to fly a jumbo jet in one scene, Barry asks, "Isn't John Travolta a pilot? How hard can it be?") Plus: Chris Rock as a mosquito gets off the best lawyer joke of 2007.
On a side note, I'd been questioning the wisdom of releasing a cute l'il bee cartoon at a time when actual honeybee populations are inexplicably crashing around the planet. (I know, I know, it's a kids' movie. Call me Captain Bringdown.) Is this a case of the pop culture fiddling while hives burn? A Discovery Channel documentary it's not, but "Bee Movie" does at least address what would happen if our apine friends stopped pollinating in such a manner as to spook the little ones without throwing them into blind panic.
It's not a pretty sight: The colors bleed out of this bright Playskool movie, leaving a dead and wintry wasteland. Point taken. Then "Bee Movie" makes everything right in such magical fashion that it wouldn't fool a child, and maybe that's the point, too. Ten-year-old companion leaned over to me during this scene and muttered, "Dad, it wouldn't happen that fast."
No, honey, it wouldn't. But we can talk about that on the ride home.


         "ACCORDING to all known laws of aviation," says a voice at the beginning of "Bee Movie," which bears the double distinction of being Jerry Seinfeld's first foray into animation and DreamWorks' first foray into Jerry Seinfeld, "there is no way a bee should be able to fly." The voice explains that bees' wings are too short and their bodies too round to make getting airborne very likely. Then it adds, "Bees, of course, fly anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible."
 
 If this sounds uncharacteristically rousing and inspirational considering the source -- there's nobody on Earth who doesn't know that "Bee Movie" was written and produced by Jerry Seinfeld, right? -- I should point out that this moment may be as rousing and inspirational as "Bee Movie" gets. Which isn't to say it doesn't have lots of funny moments, just that it prefers to keep things light, matter-of-fact and sitcom-y. The story is loopy and harebrained, but the telling of it is too cool and removed to qualify as inspired lunacy. "Bee Movie" doesn't soar into the realm of the impossible, in other words, so much as it hovers in the vicinity of the doable -- issues of bee anthropomorphism aside, needless to say.
 


         






   Seinfeld had been approached often in past years to voice animated characters and waited until he was able to work on a project that he could really get behind, or so the story goes. Not surprisingly, the script is suffused with his familiar tone, rhythm and preoccupations. "Bee Movie" is snappier, friendlier and infinitely more likable than the crass, addled "Shrek" franchise or the aggressively unpleasant "Shark's Tale," say.
 
 What it's not is particularly unfamiliar. Seinfeld's brand of observational, referential, minutia-obsessed humor has gotten so pervasive as to have practically become the in-house tone of DreamWorks animation. For a big comeback project, "Bee Movie" feels as if  it was cut from a mold made in the '90s.
 
 A coming-of-age story about a kid from a conformist society whose individualism and nonconformity cause problems at first but eventually save the day, "Bee Movie" parrots the I-gotta-be-me standard without thinking it through.
 
 Barry Benson (Seinfeld), is a young bee fresh out of college about to forcibly enter the workforce. Or as the orientation guide at the Honex plant puts it, "You've worked your whole lives so you can work your whole lives." This might sound sinister or oppressive, but it's not presented that way at all. The honey plant could double as an amusement park, just as the hive where Barry has lived all his life is a shiny, happy, retro-styled mixed-use commercial/industrial/residential development that tends to its citizens' every need.
 
 Nobody finds this the least bit troubling, except Barry -- whose objections seem to stem not from the fact that the hive is a corporate feudal state but from the idea of doing one job for the rest of his life. The only job that appeals to him is that of pollen jock -- they're the pilots who leave the hive and go out into the world.
 
 While flying over Central Park, Barry is separated from the rest of the squadron and lost. He winds up inside the apartment of Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), a florist, who saves Barry from her meathead boyfriend, Ken (Patrick Warburton), when Ken tries to swat him.
 
 Grateful, Barry breaks the cardinal rule of bees and talks to Vanessa. Soon she and Barry become close friends, and Barry returns to the hive full of a newfound appreciation for the human way of life. (Cinnabon is high on his list of marvels.)
 
 When he and Vanessa visit a supermarket, however, Barry discovers that humans have been stealing the fruit of bees' work for profit and he sues humanity for -- I don't know what. Copyright infringement? Piracy? Something the kids can really rally behind.
 
 So, is it a good thing or a bad thing that "Bee Movie" goes to the trouble of inventing an entire fictional insect universe, with its own codes and problems, and then transposes onto it a longer-than-usual episode of "Seinfeld"? The jokes are the best thing about it ("I was already a bloodsucking parasite," says a mosquito turned lawyer, played by Chris Rock. "All I needed was the briefcase.") They're also the worst thing about it. ("I just hope she's bee-ish," sighs Barry's anxious mother, played by Kathy Bates, on learning that her son is interested in someone who may or may not be a wasp. Get it?)
 
 Barry appears on Bee Larry King and says things like, "When I'm done with the humans, they're not going to be able to say 'honey' without paying a royalty."
 
  And there's a recurring gag involving Ray Liotta and his brand of honey that's hilarious -- if you happen to have cultivated some wry opinions about Liotta's acting style and a sardonic view of Paul Newman salad dressing-like products. What kid hasn't? I'm all for double-encoding, but not when most of the humor seems aimed at people old enough to have enjoyed "Seinfeld" in its first run, before the film's target audience was born.
 
 This would be OK if "Bee Movie"-- a pun on B movie that goes no further than the title -- weren't also content to remain in the shallow part of the pool, story-wise. The movie opens with the suggestion that one little bee is going to do the impossible -- and it turns out to be a lawsuit. Which leads to a work stoppage. Which leads to a plant-growth problem. Which is easily resolved.
 
 Meanwhile, nothing about the movie resonates emotionally. The conformity of the hive is neither crushing nor soul-deadening. The fact that humans making money off the bees' labor has no effect on the quality of life of the bees, who dwell in contented, well-fed insularity. There's no real jeopardy. The stakes are low. It's a bee movie about nothing.
 

 
 "Bee Movie." MPAA rating: PG for mild suggestive humor. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. In wide release.   

Bee Movie  is agreeably skewed fun. There's no denying that the jokes in this bedazzling animated feature seem, at first, a bit conventional, if not corny. Jerry Seinfeld, who co-wrote and produced the film, lends his patented nasal-voiced skepticism to Barry B. Benson, a Central Park hive dweller buzzing for adventure. A boyish drone who's supposed to resemble Jerry, but looks more like Casey Affleck crossed with the young Charles Grodin, Barry gets up in the morning, deliberates before picking a yellow-and-black-striped sweater off a rack hung with a dozen identical options, then sharpens his stinger like a pencil. What lies ahead for him is a life of noble drudgery. The hive believes in making honey, then more honey still, all in a cutely convoluted Dr. Seussian assembly-line bustle operated by  wait for it  the Honex corporation. Which is why Barry is drawn to the Pollen Jocks, strapping daredevils dressed like riot cops whose job is to gather that precious flower dust.
It's when Barry tags along with them that Bee Movie  comes alive. As he flies into the air, the world outside looks so whizzy and strange  acid-trip flashes of sky, leaves, and blinding sun  that it's as if Barry were being reborn. The movie sticks, with thrilling precision, to a bee's eye view, as Barry rises out of Central Park and buzzes down a midtown block. The images have a spangly clarity  they make New York look new again  yet there's a funky bug-world fragility to it all, as when Barry catches a flash of himself in a car mirror or, later, gets plastered onto a windshield, along with other mashed victims. (Chris Rock, as a lowly mosquito, makes each line zing.)
Barry lands in the apartment of Vanessa Bloome (Renée Zellweger), a sweet lady romantically linked, for no good reason, to a lunatic (Patrick Warburton) who never speaks lower than a scream. Barry and Vanessa become friends; he even develops a crush on her. If that strikes you as odd  shouldn't Barry have some honey of a bee girl he's in love with?  welcome to the loopy eccentricity of Bee Movie , which is just getting rolling. Barry discovers that honey, stolen from bees, is sold to humans in supermarkets; that many of his fellows are kept in slave labor camps (i.e., honey farms); and that no other bees know about it. Seinfeld, voice rising to that nifty incredulous whine, perfectly channels our hero's dismay. Bee Movie  is about how Barry saves the world, and without giving more away, let me just say that the film is nutty, ecological, antically funny, and moving, all at the same time.
It's also a fable for our 24/7 worker-bee age. We're used to animated films like Ratatouille  that salute those who don't go with the flow, but Bee Movie  takes a paradoxically fresher tack. In this movie, the power of the individual turns out to be overrated. It's the system that's precious, and if that message sounds a tad...reactionary, Bee Movie  finds a touching beauty in it. Who'd have guessed that Jerry Seinfeld, the maestro of nothing, would spearhead a fairy tale about the inspiring glory of punching the clock?

 Bees rarely fly in a straight line. They hover and zigzag, with a purpose known only to the collective brain of the hive. The most genuinely apian aspect of “Bee Movie,” DreamWorks’ new animated movie about, well, bees, is that it spends a lot of its short running time buzzing happily around, sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom. There is a plot — the usual big, elaborate story with the usual important messages about saving the planet, living together in interspecies harmony and believing in yourself — but it’s a little beside the point. The real fun is the insect shtick.  The DreamWorks Animation formula, exemplified in the mighty “Shrek” franchise (and imitated by would-be rivals at Sony and Fox), is to charm the children with cute creatures and slapstick action while jabbing at the grown-ups with soft, pseudosophisticated pop- cultural satire. “Bee Movie,” directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner and animated by several hundred industrious drones, pushes this strategy almost to the point of dispensing with the kid stuff altogether.  There are a few splendid cartoon set pieces — including a funny, thrilling bee’s-eye tour of New York, from Central Park flora to the surface of a tennis ball to the inside of a speeding car — that show off the latest computer animation techniques. But most of the film’s creative energy is verbal rather than visual, and semimature rather than strictly juvenile.  Which is hardly surprising. As everyone knows by now, the leading man (and one of the screenwriters and producers) is Jerry Seinfeld, whose sitcom, almost a decade off the network air, lives on in syndication and in the endless recycling of memorable one-liners by a certain type of pathetic Gen-Xer. (Not me, though. I’m the complete opposite of every film critic you’ve ever met. I’m the master of my domain.)  Mr. Seinfeld provides the voice and attitude for Barry B. Benson, a young bee who has reached the stage in his accelerated bug lifestyle when he must choose a career. The hive where he lives is a highly regimented place, where the bees, conditioned by 27 million years of evolution, work without a break in the same job for their whole lives. Visually, this world resembles a sweet, sunny, corporate version of Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.”  Barry’s nerdy pal, Adam (Matthew Broderick), accepts his drone future as part of the natural order of things, but Barry is a maverick, an individualist yearning to break out of the conformist world of the social insects.  He may also remind some viewers of Benjamin Braddock, the alliteratively named hero of “The Graduate,” a film that “Bee Movie” cites in a few amusing scenes. Not that Barry has an affair with a middle-aged mama bee (all bees are children of the queen, a biological fact the film notes only in passing). Instead he flies even farther from the nest, so to speak, falling in love with an actual human being, a Manhattan florist named Vanessa who speaks in the irresistibly sweet voice of Renée Zellweger.  When you stop to think about it, the prospect of romance between a bee and a person raises some potentially awkward, not to say physiologically outlandish, questions. But of course you’re not supposed to think about it. The moral of the story — one of them, anyway — is that we and the bees are interdependent and that we should respect their hard work.  This lesson is satirically driven home in a courtroom plot that erupts just as the love story starts to get sticky. When Barry discovers that honey is sold in supermarkets, and that it is harvested from captive bees held in smoky, shoddy fake hives, he sues the human race, going after some of its notorious bee abusers. These include Ray Liotta, who sells his own brand of honey, and Sting, whose name is obviously offensive to bees. (Both celebrities make cameo voice appearances, as does Larry King, playing a character called Bee Larry King. It’s funnier than it sounds. Or maybe it’s exactly as funny as it sounds.)  Even when playing an animated bee, Mr. Seinfeld does not demonstrate great emotional range. His comfort zone as a performer ranges from peeved to perplexed to moderately psyched, with occasional bursts of obvious exaggeration to indicate that he is at least aware that more intense states of feeling exist. But his detachment works in the movie’s favor by defusing its sentimental impulses.  Perhaps because of its star’s background in stand-up comedy, “Bee Movie” makes overt a conceit that is usually left implicit in animal-kingdom cartoons, namely that species is the cartoon version of ethnicity. Barry and his tribe are not just bees. They identify as “Beeish” — I’m sure “Benson” was something else back in the old country — and worry about their children dating wasps. On his travels Barry meets a mosquito who speaks in the voice of Chris Rock and who refers to his despised and misunderstood brethren as “bloods.”  These riffs on identity politics, a durable if sometimes risky source of humor in American pop culture, give “Bee Movie” an extra fillip of comic vitality — the hint of a sting, if you will, in an otherwise soft and fuzzy entertainment.  “Bee Movie” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few scary moments and mild hints about, er, the birds and the bees.

Amiable but no more, "Bee Movie" puts a hiveful of potent talent at the service of a zig-zigging, back-of-an-envelope story that's short on surprise and originality. Long sought for animation work, producer-writer-star Jerry Seinfeld contents himself with whimsical notions and mild jokes in creating an independent-minded bee who breaks with protocol to forge a relationship with a human, to less than inspired results. Seinfeld's name, a huge push by Paramount/DreamWorks Animation and venture's mainstream innocuousness should combine for sweet if not blockbuster B.O.
Seinfeld's patented quirky humor does lend this cross-pollinating tale a distinctive personality, one notably less crass and pandering than that found in such other DreamWorks toons as "Shark Tale" and the "Shrek" sequels. Effort's gentleness and modesty are not unappealing, but these qualities simultaneously provide the picture with an underwhelming impact which, given the deja vu aspect of certain key elements, contribute to its overall ho-humness.
Opening stretch recalls DreamWorks' first animated venture, "Antz," with its portrait of a highly regimented community and focus on one youngster who'd prefer to go his own way. "We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth," insists Adam (voiced by Matthew Broderick), best pal of Barry (Seinfeld), as the two graduate from school and are obliged to commit themselves to life-long jobs with honey conglom Honex. Despite pic's beguiling view of the bee community as one big playground, Barry slips off to join the "pollen jocks," macho aviators who are the only bees allowed to leave the hive.
Squadron's flight into Central Park and Manhattan constitutes the film's most exuberant, visually adventurous passage. Initially exhilarated by all he sees as the heavy-bellied, yellow-and-black pilots bomb around town, Barry becomes imperiled by a tennis ball and racquet before landing inside an apartment. There, a kind florist, Vanessa (Renee Zellweger), prevents Barry from being swatted by putting a glass over him so she can put him outside.
Despite the strict bee-world commandment against speaking with humans, Barry feels so grateful to Vanessa that he initiates communication with her. Unfortunately, in this crucial scene, Vanessa is animated to gesticulate and make faces in such an exaggerated and off-puttingly mechanical way that it takes a good while to embrace the character, whose empathetic instincts warm Barry's cockles, if a bee's heart has such.
Revealing to his busy-bee parents (Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson) that he's "met someone," Barry is asked by his mom, "Was she beeish?," to which he replies that she's "not a wasp." Such jokes continue as the script (penned by Seinfeld, former "Seinfeld" writers Spike Feresten and Andy Robin, and Barry Marder, author of the "Letters From a Nut" tomes) pursues a parallel with "The Graduate" that becomes explicit with a homage to the latter's famous swimming pool scene. Barry simply can't decide what he wants to do with his life, so he follows a line of perfectly modern logic: When in doubt, sue.
So who does Barry sue? Why, the entire human race, for "stealing" the honey Barry's fellow bees so industriously produce for what they thought was their own benefit. A much-publicized trial ensues, with a verdict that yields unanticipated consequences for man and bug, but which ultimately clears the way for greater mutual understanding between the species.
It's a goofy but wispy concept, one hardly developed in ways that charge the emotions or one's sense of justice. Nor does the critter/human dynamic here possess the crucial interdependence that it did, for example, in this summer's "Ratatouille." Helmers Simon J. Smith ("Shrek 4-D") and Steve Hickner ("The Prince of Egypt") move things along agreeably, and, while the visuals are awash with vibrant colors, they lack the intricacy, detail and facial nuance of the best computer animation; both "Antz" and Monsters, Inc.," for example, provide infinitely more worked-out hidden worlds for their characters to inhabit.
Voicings by an array of top talent are fun, and musical backing provides some bounce.
