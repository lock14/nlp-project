Decked out in the powdered wigs and knee-high stockings that were all the rage in 18th-century England, the right honorable gentlemen of the House of Commons debate � with all the detachment and ironic eloquence directors love to grant the British � the relative virtues and vices of the African-slave trade. In the midst of all these harrumphing old men, and trying with all the hortatory earnestness of youth to rouse their snoozing indignation, stands abolitionist William Wilberforce (Gruffudd), who must be the most handsome member of Parliament in the history of Great Britain. With his leading-man looks, unshakable conviction, and dulcet voice, young Wilberforce has charms to soothe his rivals, but he�s sorely lacking the political guile necessary to sway their opinions. For 20 years, our hero � a slow learner if ever there were one � is repeatedly taught the lesson that unguarded enthusiasm on the side of right may grant you a spot in heaven, but it counts for little in politics. Wilberforce tells his story in flashback to the seductive Barbara Spooner (Garai) during the course of a single evening at his country estate, a narrative conceit that succeeds in distracting us from the occasionally ponderous story of an unfailingly decent man, so we can revel in the erotic clumsiness of a bumbling one. �Tell me about your last speech before Parliament,� Barbara coos by candlelight, crossing her legs and gazing longingly at her quarry. In reply to which � Wilberforce tells her about his last speech before Parliament. Wake up, William! When she said she wanted to hear all about your 20-year struggle to end slavery, what she meant was that she didn�t want at all to hear about your 20-year struggle to end slavery; she wanted to watch as you turned all that passion for social reform toward slightly more impure sport, preferably with her as your co-conspirator. After all, God didn�t bless her with those heavy eyelids and pouting lips so they would fust in her, unused. Unfortunately for Barbara and for us, what makes William Wilberforce a great man is also what makes him a bore: Whether in the parlor or in the halls of Parliament, he�s possessed of such intractable single-mindedness and confidence in the rightness of his ideals that we can�t help but wish he would lay aside saving the world for a while, come down from his cloudy perch, and dabble in sin like the rest of us, slavery or no. Which just goes to show how selfish we moviegoers can be.


"Amazing Grace" is very much the stolid "great man" bio pic, but you've probably never heard of this particular great man before, and his story's worth the telling. The movie, deeply felt and dutifully inspiring, is also an interesting reminder that England outlawed slavery a half-century before the United States got around to it, and didn't need a civil war to do so. All it took was one extremely stubborn man of conscience.
As played by Ioan Gruffudd, William Wilberforce is the sort of grave, God-fearing young man who annoys everyone else by being both moral and right. We see his concern for whipped carriage horses first, but it's whipped humans who become his life's work. By the late 17th century, there were 11 million Africans in the West Indies , and Great Britain was the superpower of slave traders. The details of the Middle Passage are hideous but business is so good that no one wants to hear them.
Wilberforce forces the issue with canny PR stunts like diverting lords and ladies out for a pleasure cruise into a recovered slave ship. "That smell is the smell of death; breathe it in!" he bellows. He also inveighs against slavery in the House of Commons to peeved, bored peers who have too much invested in the practice. "Doesn't he know the dangers of talking sense in this place? " mutters someone.
It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated, but, to his credit, gifted journeyman director Michael Apted understands he's playing the long game. It took decades for the armada of public opinion to shift course, and "Amazing Grace" charts the ups and downs of England and its hero. (He suffered grievously from colitis, we learn.) Political strategy is crucial to all the abolitionists except Wilberforce, who believes right will conquer simply because it's right. Gruffudd makes this naivete endearing rather than obstinate.
Watching the film, you get a sense of Europe turning under the weight of history. At the start, England is about to lose the Revolutionary War; by the end, beheadings in Paris have those across the channel fearfully fingering their collars. One of the scruffier abolitionists (Rufus Sewell) whispers, "What you say about the slave is true of the miner and the farmer," but Wilberforce will have none of such proto-Marxism and sends the man packing. The more conservative members of Parliament are horrified by an anti slavery petition bearing 400,000 names. "That roll of paper reeks of rebellion," squawks one MP. "The people
?!" "Amazing Grace" is explicit about charting a middle passage of its own.
Intriguing historical characters keep popping up in the film, played by sharp hams. Toby Jones (the other Capote) makes an epicene Duke of Clarence, the King's son (King George III, you may recall, is off being insane) while Benedict Cumberbatch is a canny, red-haired William Pitt, youthful prime minister and Wilberforce's boyhood friend. Michael Gambon gambols through as Lord Charles Fox, Ciaran Hinds glowers as the villainous Lord Tarleton, and Albert Finney, looking like a hedgehog in a cassock, is John Newton, the slave-trader-turned monk who wrote the title hymn, the abolitionists' fight song. Senegalese pop star Youssou N'Dour makes an impressive acting debut as Oloudaqh Equiano, the freed slave turned writer who served as Exhibit A against slavery.
There's a love interest, too: Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), a lifelong activist who forms a happy meeting of mind and soul with this man who prefers meeting with God in a field instead of a church. "Amazing Grace" is a period epic and a saint's progress, but mostly it's a debate on the old subject of Christian faith versus Christian works. Not much of a contest, really. The movie soberly testifies to a man who felt that belief without acts is the worst sort of hypocrisy and who kept pushing until the rest of his country gave in.


         "Amazing Grace," a story of idealism, idealists and speaking truth to power, understands there is something inordinately moving and dramatic about a man who stands up for what is right and makes a difference in this life.
 
  The man in question is William Wilberforce, who for decades was Parliament's prime mover in the battle to abolish the slave trade in Britain. Wilberforce ended up buried in Westminster Abbey and, when the abolition bill finally passed on March 25, 1807, he was lionized by his peers as a man as influential as Napoleon. But that should blind no one to how much of a struggle it was to end what Wilberforce called "a trade which degrades men to the level of brutes."
 


         






    It is risky, in this cynical and mocking age, to make a determinedly traditional biopic old school enough to use clips of its stars during the end credits, a film willing to focus on the good that men do in the same way works such as "The Life of Emile Zola," "Madame Curie" and "Wilson" did in decades past.
 
  Fortunately, director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy. Working from a script by Steven Knight ("Dirty Pretty Things"), Apted — whose dramatic credits include "Coal Miner's Daughter" and HBO's "Rome" — has managed to be true to the outsized emotions of the story without giving way to sentimentality.
 
  A major factor in this success is strong acting by largely British performers (Nina Gold did the casting), some more familiar to American audiences than others, but all at home in the spirit of a turbulent age.
 
  First among equals is Welsh-born Ioan Gruffudd ("Fantastic Four"), whose fresh, keenly compassionate face is well-suited to a man we first meet putting himself at risk because he cannot bear to see a horse beaten. Gruffudd's naturalness and charisma allow us to accept him as Wilberforce, a somewhat otherworldly man once described as "all soul and no body" who, once committed to abolition, was uncompromising in its service.
 
  It is the shrewd notion of Knight's script to introduce Wilberforce at a crucial midpoint in his career: a moment in 1797, a decade after he became an abolitionist, when, physically exhausted and in despair, he feels that all his work has been for naught.
 
  "Amazing Grace" then flashes back 15 years earlier when Wilberforce was a beginner in politics whose pleasing voice made him known as "the nightingale of the House of Commons." We hear him sing the hymn that gives the film its name, which turns out to have been written by a former slave captain turned minister (Albert Finney), a spiritual mentor to the young man.
 
  Wilberforce is soon revealed as someone in love with nature and with God who is uncertain about his future, about whether to use that wonderful voice "to praise the Lord or change the world." How he concludes that fighting slavery will allow him to do both, and how difficult that conclusion was to live with is the story "Amazing Grace" sets out to tell.
 
  "Amazing Grace," again helped by its actors, is especially good at delineating Wilberforce's relationship to colleagues and comrades: his old college friend and the great political mind of the age William Pitt (a particularly convincing Benedict Cumberbatch), the crusading revolutionary abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) and the freed slave and celebrity autobiographer Olaudah Equiano, who is played by the great Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour.
 
  When "Amazing Grace" returns to the 1790s, it introduces a sparkplug of a young woman named Barbara Spooner, wonderfully played with a crown of cascading red hair by Romola Garai, best remembered from "I Capture the Castle." She both gives Wilberforce a reason to live and, as he tells her his story, allows the film to flash back to his darkest days in Parliament, where high-quality actors such as Michael Gambon, Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones play his colleagues on both sides of the issue.
 
  There's more to "Amazing Grace," however, than its well-conceived plot. Not surprisingly, given Apted's documentary background (the landmark "7 Up" series), this film (production designed by Charles Wood and shot by Remi Adefarasin) has a visually striking sense of period. From fetid, crowded docks to the chaos of London streets or the raucousness of smoky card rooms where politicians gather, "Amazing Grace" puts us right into the past in a most convincing way.
 
  Despite all its good work, "Amazing Grace" has those risk factors, including how unfashionable academically the notion of great men influencing events currently is. But while historians such as Adam Hochschild feel that too much emphasis on Wilberforce obscures the importance of other anti-slavery forces and individuals, Hugh Thomas, author of "The Slave Trade," insists that Wilberforce's achievement is "one more reminder that individuals can make history." It is this point of view that "Amazing Grace" embraces and makes its own.
 
 
  "Amazing Grace." MPAA rating: PG for thematic material involving slavery and some mild language. Running time: 2 hours. In selected theaters. 
 
 
   

Do British middle schoolers get to watch movies during classes, the way American  kids do when their teachers burn off two days by showing a video? If they do, the  unrigorous history lesson Amazing Grace  will soon be waiting for them during their slavery unit. Ioan Gruffudd (Fantastic Four ) plays the abolitionist who pushed Parliament to free Britain's slaves 200 years ago. It's earnest, solemn stuff. The movie sings an old tune  Albert Finney is the blind minister who wrote the title ditty  and it leaves the blood unstirred.

 “Amazing Grace,” a prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce, carries a strong whiff of piety. It isn’t a bad smell; there are notes of roses and treacle in the mix, but also elements of sweat and pain. Wilberforce, born in 1759, was an abolitionist for much of his adult life and helped bring about the end of the slave trade in the British Empire and then slavery itself. He was an evangelical Christian and social conservative who rallied for animal rights and against trade unions, which makes him a tough nut to crack. It’s no wonder he makes a first-rate movie saint.  Serious-minded and squeaky clean, “Amazing Grace” is an imperfect look at an imperfect soul. It has been confidently directed by Michael Apted, who invests Wilberforce’s fight with a strong sense of conviction, and written by Steven Knight, whose other credits include “Dirty Pretty Things.” The overall effect is part BBC-style biography, part Hollywood-like hagiography, and generally pleasing and often moving, even when the story wobbles off the historical rails or becomes bogged down in dopey romance. Wilberforce often comes across as too good to be true, which may be why the fine Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd, doubtless with the encouragement of his socially minded director, plays him with a hint of madness in his eyes.  The film’s overly complicated narrative traces Wilberforce’s journey from strapping young reformer to nearly broken member of Parliament, with periodic skips back and forth in time. The only son of a wealthy merchant, he studied at Cambridge, where he met his close friend William Pitt the Younger, the future British prime minister, brought to extraordinary life by the young British actor and relative newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch. Eventually he will also meet a woman, his future wife, Barbara (the rather too saucy Romola Garai), which pushes the story into the less engaging domestic realm. But it is his intimate, prickly relationship with Pitt that warms the action and talk, partly through the chemistry between the actors, and brings the personal firmly to bear on the political.  Biographical films are generally tricky, since the on-screen personality rarely matches the real one; they’re even trickier when the subject is shrouded in misty time and debate. In some quarters, “Amazing Grace” will succeed better as a diversion than as a nuanced record of Wilberforce’s life. Historians have been divided on his legacy, with one damning him as “the mouthpiece of the party of order and of the business world.” A contemporary asked Wilberforce, after he introduced a law that set back the cause of trade unions, why he paid more attention to African slaves than to Britain’s working poor, whose interests he probably helped obstruct for years. Religious writers, not surprisingly, are more charitably disposed toward  him.  It’s equally unsurprising that the filmmakers don’t address these sharper criticisms. The film’s Wilberforce is a fanatic, a true believer, a crusader, a man of action and God, of stirring principle and tireless will. He’s at once pure and seductive, a dashing, romantic figure with a long black coat who talks to God while lying in his garden and keeps rabbits for pets. This matinee idol version might be wildly simplistic, even borderline caricature, but there is also something unfailingly attractive about a film character so wholly devoted to good. The screenplay doesn’t poke into the nature of that good — whether Wilberforce’s fight against slavery was truly selfless or flattered a sense of moral superiority — but it does make you think.  It would be easier to dismiss “Amazing Grace” for its historical elisions if it weren’t also filled with so many great British actors larking about in knee breeches and powdered wigs; if it weren’t, in other words, an entertainment. Among the more valuable players is Rufus Sewell as Thomas Clarkson, a reformer whose passion seems to tip into zealotry when he speaks about the French Revolution; you half expect him to pull on some wellies so he can wade through the blue blood about to spill over the Place de la Concorde.  And no matter how stuffy the room or the speeches, the reliably brilliant Michael Gambon, who plays Lord Charles Fox  with trembling jowls and flashing eyes, brings a sense of the world and its sensual pleasures with him.  The actors Toby Jones, who plays one of King George III’s many sons, and Ciaran Hinds are also on hand for much of the parliamentary proceedings, delivering withering commentary and general amusement as two of Wilberforce’s most powerful foes. Albert Finney also blusters in every so often as Wilberforce’s mentor, John Newton, who wrote the song that gives the film its title. In many respects, “Amazing Grace” offers a snapshot of the British Empire at the beginning of its long decline as the dominating world power. It takes nothing away from Wilberforce and his stunning achievements to note that this film, at its best, is another reminder that no matter how diminished that political might, no one sells old-fashioned, Hollywood-style history and manners better than those acting royals across the pond.  “Amazing Grace” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few oblique scenes and speeches describe the horrors of the Middle Passage and of slavery.

Crisply told and sincerely thesped, "Amazing Grace" is a workmanlike costumer that distills Blighty's long battle for the abolition of slavery and the personalities behind landmark antislavery legislation into a tidy story of conscience and perseverance. The closing night preem at the Toronto fest, pic will go out Stateside Feb., 23, 2007, to mark the bicentennial of the passage of a key bill in the struggle. Biz will be decent but unspectacular, though ancillary could be fuelled by pic's educational value.
In 1797, 34-year-old Evangelical antislavery firebrand William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd), consumed by his cause, exhausted by the vicious Parliament in-fighting and wracked by colitis, retires to the country home of his friends Henry and Marianne Thornton (Nicholas Farrell, Sylvestra Le Touzel). While on the mend, he recounts his struggles to admirer Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai).
Cut to eight years prior, when Wilberforce, whom everybody seems to call "Wilbur," is persuaded by close friend and future Prime Minister William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) to introduce legislation to end the slave trade in the British Empire.
Wilberforce, who was only 21 when he was elected to the House of Commons, joins Pitt, who at 24 became the youngest P.M. in Britain's history, to lead a contentious and complex fight for antislavery legislation against chief opponents Lord Tarlton (Ciaran Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).
Wilberforce and Pitt are aided by oddball do-gooder Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) and prominent freed slave and author Oloudah Equiano (Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, fine in low-key thesping debut). But, despite their best efforts, Wilberforce's first antislavery bill is defeated by a landslide in 1791, and subsequent annual legislation fares no better.
However, back in 1797, inspired by his growing love for Barbara, Wilberforce once again takes up the antislavery crusade. After much wrangling and skullduggery, a bill is finally passed in 1807 which does not outlaw slavery but makes it illegal for British ships to transport slaves, giving Wilberforce a hard-fought, morally correct victory.
Cautioning at the tail of the closing credit crawl that certain characters and incidents have been combined or invented to move the drama along, pic's convenient tale of good vs. evil nevertheless makes its forceful point that Wilberforce's youthful obsessiveness and unorthodox methods aided tremendously in ending British transport of slaves and accelerating the demise of the slave trade. In fact, the actual Slavery Abolition Act wasn't passed until 1833, a month after Wilberforce's death.
Pic reflects the no-nonsense storytelling skills of prolific helmer Michael Apted, whose career-long mix of feature and docu work holds him in good stead once more. Cast is uniformly fine, with Gruffudd setting the pace via a sincere and well-modulated perf and Hinds appropriately dastardly as the sneering Tarlton.
In the three scenes in which he appears, Albert Finney is mesmerizing as the remorseful former slave trader and Wilberforce adviser John Newton, while Michael Gambon gets the bulk of pic's few lighter lines as Lord Charles Fox, whose dramatic defection to the antislavery movement is seen to break up the logjam within Parliament.
Tech package is pro, with CGI discretely broadening the horizons in certain long shots to cement the period illusion. Closing credits crawl over a bagpipe performance of the cherished title tune, first penned by Newton in the 1770s and lustily sung by Gruffudd at a pivotal point in the proceedings; that segues into "Everyone's Sky," penned and sung by N'Dour and composer David Arnold.

Morally irreproachable and flat as a pancake, Michael Apted 's Amazing Grace  is set amid a bickering House of Commons in late-18th-century London, but the movie belongs squarely in the currently blooming subgenre of Whites Saving Dark-Skinned Victims of Empire. Or at least it would were Apted able to bring a little drama to the party. Just as Blood Diamond  was about white men making the world safe for conflict-free earrings, Amazing Grace  is the story of how England was won over to slavery-free sugar imports by William Wilberforce , a liberal member of Parliament. Only, being British, he talksand talks, and talksthe opposition into submission. Wil- berforce, the real-life abolitionist who devoted his life to pushing anti-slave-trade legislation through a hostile Parliament terrified of waving goodbye to the British Empire, comes with grade-A hero credentials. Still, he doesn't deserve to be deified, sanctified, and so thoroughly bleached of human blemish that hardened highwaymen and exhausted horses quail before his goodness and mercyand that's just in the first 10 minutes.
From the word go we feel the burden of the exhaustive research that went into making Amazing Grace . Steven Knight 's ponderous script is front-loaded with expository deep background and stuffed into an awkward structure that lumbers back and forth between early Wilberforce the idealist and late Wilberforce the broken man. White as a sheet and doubled over his laudanum- addicted intestines, Will (as we are encouraged to think of him) tells in flashback the sorry tale of his failure to ignite parliamenta- ry conscience. Listening to his woe is blind date Barbara Spooner , a reform-minded lass played by the comely Romola Garai  and ear- marked, despite his bashful reluctance to jump her lovely bones, to become Will's wife.
As rendered by the granite-jawed Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd , young Wilberforce is a rock star among parliamentarians, noble of countenance, fiery of rhetoric, and implausibly lacking in earthly ambition. No conniving pol he: Will is much given to agonized chats with God while lying in wet grass as he strives to decide whether to become a man of the cloth or a player among the bewigged members of Commons, who fear that the anti-slavery movement smacks of the nasty revolutions already under way in France and America.
Urged on by his old friend Pitt the Younger (the excellent, if weird-looking, Benedict Cumberbatch ), an all-white posse of activists, and a single freed slave who is seen signing copies of his memoirs before conveniently dying of sorrow, Wilberforce is brought to the realization that there's no inherent contradiction between being a man of God and a man of the world. Whereupon he squares his broad shoulders and bursts into song, serenading a room full of dour Tories (among them Ciarán Hinds , a reliable practitioner of the patrician sneer) with the famous hymn that gives this guileless movie its title. It turns out that the love- ly song "Amazing Grace," which I had always thought was written by an American, was actually composed by John Newton , a former slave-ship captain so sickened by the cruelty with which slaves were treated en route to England that he spent the rest of his life atoning. This, if nothing else, gives Albert Finney , who plays the reformed sin- ner, a chance to wear a sackcloth dress and an unaccustomed air of humility as he swabs flagstones in his local church and unloads the sage counsel ("Wilbur, you have work to do") needed to galvanize Will into action.
Slackly paced, suffused with tasteful lighting, and weighed down by a surfeit of chat, Amazing Grace  hauls us responsibly through the fight to bring the good word to Parliament. It's a Sisyphean struggle that, even with the embrace of abolitionism by Pitt's sworn enemy Lord Fox (played by Michael Gambon , who keeps throwing off his wig to reveal dispiriting hat hair), seems doomed to failure. Only at the end, spurred to renewed activism by his wife, does Will mount a grass-roots campaign andthank Godlower his holier-than-thou self to a little means-ends dirty work, the stuff that gets things done in all politics, liberal or otherwise. Wilberforce was a sterling fellow who undoubtedly earned the pro forma standing ovation with which Apted caps this stolid movie. But after all that virtue, you can't imagine what a relief it is to learn, even at the eleventh hour, that he wasn't just a stiff upper lip.
