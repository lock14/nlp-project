         Is the timing of the release of "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" fortuitous or just unfortunate? An adaptation of JT LeRoy's short stories of the same name, Asia Argento's film opens on the heels of the year's second big literary hoax/fraud/fun-magnet: the revelation that the 25-year-old, cross-dressing, former drug addict, ex-prostitute, Martha Plimpton look-alike and celebrity darling author known as JT LeRoy was, in fact, on the page, a 40-year-old San Francisco writer named Laura Albert. (In public, hidden under wigs and sunglasses, he was played by 25-year-old Savannah Knoop, half-sister of Alpert's partner.) Re the timing: The film's distributors are going with fortuitous. And why not?
 
 The movie, for those unfamiliar with the collection of short stories, deals in the same brand of trailer goth lovingly embraced by publishers, celebrities, talk-show hosts and basically anyone who's anyone in the world of peeping chic. It's the story of a most wretched little urchin in the seediest kind of peril — the kind involving sex, drugs, prostitution, abandonment, molestation and — oh, why not, as long as the big guns are blazing — fanatical evangelical religion of the most punishing kind.
 


         






   How the revelation that JT is an invention will affect general enjoyment of the film is hard to say — though the stories were presented as fiction, they came with the implicit assurance that all of its horrors had in fact been heroically suffered by an actual individual, and a mysterious and photogenic one at that. Without that someone, the sorry tale of Jeremiah, son of a drug-addicted truck-stop prostitute named Sarah, becomes a shopworn garland of contemporary horror clichés, stylishly packaged by Argento, who definitely has an eye and an ear for this sort of thing.
 
 Argento delivers this punk rock fright-fest — informing us that only losers say "punk rock" — with panache. Against the stripped-down grubbiness of the images, the angelic good looks of Jimmy Bennett, who plays Jeremiah at age 7, and Dylan and Cole Sprouse, who play him at 11, stand out in stark contrast. The old-school horror imagery that crops up now and again throughout the film is low-tech and effective — Jeremiah is visited by imaginary crows, who peck at him and pull at his flesh like taffy. And the performances by all three children are scarily convincing. Still, it's a taxing bit of exploitation, which, although you're glad to know it's a work of fiction, doesn't exactly make a case for itself as art.
 
 The movie begins when Jeremiah is removed from the home of his loving foster parents by his foul-mouthed, scantily clad and suspiciously foreign-accented mother, Sarah. The clothes and demeanor are attributable to her occupation, the accent to the fact that she is played by Argento, who mixes a Southern drawl in with her Italian accent. The explanation provided is that her mother was Italian — and as we know, children of one immigrant parent, even when brought up in West Virginia with conventionally accented siblings — tend to retain their mothers' speech patterns. The result is that Sarah is given to saying things like, "If my father had let me, you'd long ago been flushed down some toe-let" when, obviously, what she means to say is "ter-let."
 
 The movie features performances by several friends of JT — among them Winona Ryder, who plays the part of a child psychologist with a frightening edge. Marilyn Manson shows up as one of Sarah's many boyfriends, and Italian film star Ornella Muti, plays her Jesus-freak of a mother. The scenes that take place when Jeremiah is reclaimed by his grandparents and molded into a street-corner proselytizer feel straight out of V.C. Andrews, which you'd think might have raised flags.
 
  But Argento, whose use of music is flawless, occasionally displays a feel for the jittery carpet-dread and condo-horror of dead-end living, as in the scene where Jeremiah is left behind by his mother and her husband to fend for himself with a slice of American cheese. Jeremiah rations it with the patience and parsimony of a wartime orphan, but the story spreads it thick.

Asia Argento is not what I would call a good actress, but she's a prime specimen of train-wreck sexuality: a debauched Eurotrash starlet who oozes punk cred more than she does talent. It's not too hard to see why she wanted to write, direct, and star in The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things , an adaptation of JT LeRoy's 2002 novel. The film tells the story of Jeremiah (played by three different actors), who at age 7 is ripped from his foster home and delivered into the arms of his 23-year-old mother  a selfish, dissolute druggie skank played by Argento with smeared cherry lips, peroxide hair, and a vaguely Italian croak of a voice that all blend to make her resemble Uma Thurman after a six-day bender.
Argento's entire performance is an act of exhibitionism, and so is the movie, which would have done well to drop that cynical and verbose title and substitute something catchier  like, say, Help! I Wish That My Mom Were Courtney Love!  On the road, Argento's Sarah plies her kid with pills and beer, eats with him out of Dumpsters, and looks grateful when one of her revolving-door lovers, a cowboy sadist, whips him with a belt. Did I mention that Sarah earns drug money as a stripper and prostitute? At one point, Jeremiah is sent to live with his grandparents, who are mean-eyed Christian fanatics led by Peter Fonda, who all but turns himself into Peter Cushing. Yet Argento piles on each calamity as if it were a fresh selling point; it's a rare film that serves up this much trauma with this much smug nonchalance. Just a few months ago, JT LeRoy was unmasked as a fake  a fictional alter ego. But the story of how that fakery was achieved is barely relevant to a movie that has trouble identifying the truth of a single emotion.

 Not every book receives the film adaptation it deserves, but such is certainly the case with the collection of short stories "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things." Published in 2001 under the name JT LeRoy, this assemblage of extravagant horror purports to tell the autobiographical ordeals of a cross-dressing, H.I.V.-positive, underage former prostitute from West Virginia who from the age of 4 had been subjected to various evils by his whore of a mother and her cretin boyfriends and Bible-thumping parents. Dennis Cooper was a JT LeRoy booster, as was Dave Eggers, who vowed that both  "The Heart Is Deceitful"  and the similarly themed LeRoy novel "Sarah" would "prove to be among the most influential American books of the last 10 years." Somewhere, probably hell, William S. Burroughs laughed.  Now, it seems to appear that JT LeRoy never existed, and the books and articles carrying his name were actually written by a clever Brooklyn-born, San Francisco-based woman named Laura Albert. The hipster set, in other words, has its own James Frey. It's only a matter of time (here's hoping) before Ms. Albert grovels for forgiveness before Mr. Cooper, as Mr. Frey did before Oprah Winfrey, though given the readership and rough-trade trappings, HBO would make a more suitable confession booth than network television. In any event, until then the foolish and the masochistic can ease their curiosity about this teapot tempest with the screen adaptation of "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things." Viewer discretion is advised, if only because it's well-nigh unwatchable.  Directed by Asia Argento, who wrote the script with Alessandro Magania, the screen version of "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" traces the tribulations of a young boy, Jeremiah (played first by Jimmy Bennett, then Cole and Dylan Sprouse), from the moment his birth mother, Sarah (Ms. Argento), reclaims him from his foster parents. Speaking in Italian-accented English (a detail explained with a throwaway about a boarding school), Sarah soon proves herself a supremely unfit mother. Then again, this chick has trouble standing up. Maybe it's those high heels and itty-bitty skirts she sometimes wears, which tend to force her to bend at the waist and flash the camera. Or maybe it's all the drugs that Sarah likes to take. Or maybe Ms. Argento is proud of her body. It's a nice body.  Since this isn't much of a film, there is nothing much else to say, other than that "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" was, unaccountably, badly shot in crummy-looking Super 16 film by Eric Edwards, who has done great work on films like "My Own Private Idaho." As she proved with her tackily entertaining feature debut, "Scarlet Diva," Ms. Argento doesn't know how to move the camera or her actors, but at least in that film she mostly subjected herself to abuse. Here, she puts three young actors into some squirmingly uncomfortable setups that would be no big deal if they were adults. But that's the thing about underage actors: they're also children, which is why a scene of child rape (a JT  LeRoy specialty) isn't just ghastly, it's also grotesque.  Such exploitation, of course, is what puts books like "Sarah" and "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" on best-seller lists. Given publishing's seemingly endless appetite for memoirs filled with sexual sob stories and kinks, a JT  LeRoy was inevitable. Sexual confession is hot, after all, both economically and otherwise, and here was an author who hit all the hottest buttons. That the prose is as tedious as the stories are outrageous mattered not at all,  compared with such lovingly rendered degradation. For her part, Ms. Argento had something loftier in mind when she took on the book. In an interview after the film wrapped in 2003, she said she felt bound to tell this story "because I know how hard it is, especially in America, to be a single mother."  Some stuff you can't make up.  "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes child rape, intimations of incest and brutal language.
Such is the currency of lies these days that "based on an untrue story" might well be a shrewd tagline, if an unusually honest one. Still, the recent discovery that teen prostitute turned hardcore memoirist JT LeRoy  is merely the fanciful invention of failed musician turned moneymaking writer Laura Albert won't necessarily boost the box office of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things , the two-year-old indie shocker that Asia Argento  faithfully adapted from the author's "autobiographical" anthology of 2001.
"Behind the greatest hoax of our time," declares the distributor's retooled PR, "is the heartbreaking story that started it all." Indeed, taken purely as pulp, Deceitful 's fiction is a doozy: Raised by his truck-stop hooker mom on a diet of cold SpaghettiOs and cheese singles, with the occasional methamphetamine tab for dessert, a doe-eyed seven-year-old endures belt-buckle discipline and rape by surrogate dads to become a prepubescent street preacher in God's country. But above all, the heart of this slog through Whitetrashville, U.S.A., is trueat least if you see it as the story of another survivor who not only believed the scuzzy tale, but saw herself in it.
Argento, who at age 16 played an anorexic orphan in her father Dario's aptly named Trauma , stars here as Sarah, a/k/a Mom. But in this, her second film as actor-director (after Scarlet Diva , itself aptly named), her camera is trained on those doe eyes to such a degree that there's little doubt as to where her identification lies. Matter of fact, if you cut out all the close-ups of young JT (Jimmy Bennett ) looking naive but oddly resilient in the face of countless horrors, you'd have . . . a horror movie (and a short one). "They'd have hung you on a cross," Mom says of the kid's former foster parents before using her fingernail to drive the point home.
Who's abusing whom here? Empowered by what she must have thought was fact, Argento performs the script's maternal atrocities with lurid zest, all but winking at the camera when Mom puts JT to bed in an empty bathtub, then turns a loud trick just around the corner. Whatever her limitations, Argento the actor makes certain that Argento the director doesn't lack for "action"and that the audience doesn't lack for pain. Actually, the notion of an Italian goth queen reincarnated as a bleached-blonde, suthun-accented, scripture-quoting abuser of herself and her kid isn't nearly as punishing as Argento's fashionable refusal to tell us anything much except that hell is for children. In her defense, one could say that the duped filmmaker assumed her terrorist tactics would be redeemed by our understanding that the kid not only survived the ordeal, but used it to become a well-fed star. That apparent triumph was most visible (or risible) in Cannes , where Argento and a wigged "LeRoy" took honors (and abuse) at the same Directors' Fortnight program that included Tarnation , Jonathan Caouette 's harrowing account of his own childhood.
So much for happy endings. Albert attributes her godawful title to the Old Testament, though if anyone could be said to have written the book on deceit, it's her. Well-known victims of the "greatest hoax of our time" are legion, including diehard LeRoy fan Winona Ryder , who appears briefly in the movie as a wide-eyed, puppet-wielding day care shrink. The director also grants gonzo cameos to Marilyn Manson , Lydia Lunch , Ornella Muti , and Peter Fonda . (What a cast!) Ye Argento's most indelible supporting player might be the bird with crimson plumage that shows up in JT's nightmares and suggests, in its obvious resemblance to her dad's horrific symbols, what another sleepless kid is struggling to overcome. If Deceitful  is authentic at all, it's in revealing Asia Argento as the mirror opposite of JT LeRoy. One of these characters is a real artistor at least a true believer in the cathartic power of autobiography.
