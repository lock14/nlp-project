         "Only the most ridiculous parts of this story are true," reads a title card at the start of "The Hunting Party," Richard Shepard's film about journalists turned bounty hunters in postwar Bosnia. Which doesn't seem quite right. There are plenty of invented absurdities in there too.
 
 The disclaimer refers to the movie's origins in a 2000 Esquire magazine article written by Scott Anderson, which told this incredible but true story: Reuniting in Sarajevo five years after the end of the Balkan war, a group of war correspondents got drunk and decided to try their hand at capturing the notorious Bosnian Serb war criminal Radovan Karadzic. In the process, they were mistaken for a CIA hit squad, got closer to Karadzic than was seemly (given the well-publicized multinational manhunt supposedly underway) and were intercepted by the actual CIA.
 


         






   Turning a true story into a plausible one, however, isn't as easy as it sounds, and Shepard, who directs from a script he adapted, never manages to get beyond the premise. The script feels flabby and slapdash, full of interesting ideas but cursory and underdeveloped, from the torrents of expository dialogue to the newsreel footage that comes out of nowhere and the gratuitously bared breasts. (Though you have to hand it to the filmmakers for their how-do-we-wedge-these-in-here ingenuity.)
 
 Richard Gere stars as Simon Hunt, a veteran war correspondent who loses his marbles on the air one night after stumbling on the fresh slaughter of an entire Muslim village. Fired from the network where he was a star, Simon becomes a stringer for increasingly obscure news outlets, while his trusty cameraman and sidekick Duck (Terrence Howard) is promoted to a cushy job as personal cameraman to the network anchor (James Brolin). Back in Sarajevo for the fifth anniversary of the end of the war, Simon approaches Duck and talks him into helping him land an interview with the elusive war criminal known as the Fox (Ljubomir Kerekes). Along for the ride and the explanations is Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg), a network bigwig's son on his first big assignment. It's not long before we learn that Hunt is hunting the Fox  for reasons personal and gruesome.
 
 Gere and Howard do their best to keep things afloat, and their charisma goes a long way in making this happen. The less-experienced Eisenberg (who was so wonderful in Noah Baumbach's "The Squid and the Whale") doesn't fare as well, having been saddled with the thankless role of millstone.
 
 The biggest problem with the movie is the tone, which is by turns preachy, silly, mawkish and dark. Shepard has said that he was interested in setting a film in a postwar country, but in some ways "The Hunting Party" seems to want to do for the Balkan war what "Three Kings" did for Operation Desert Storm -- that is, highlight the absurdity of carnage in a contemporary setting with gallows humor. The problem is that the humor in "The Hunting Party"  is just gallows-adjacent. It doesn't feel organic to the story. Finding humor in horror requires a level of remove that Shepard can't seem to muster. He takes sides and vents anger, turning Hunt into a martyr, for example, and the United Nations, CIA and network news into cynical buffoons. Black comedy becomes funnier as the action becomes darker and more perilous, but "The Hunting Party" fails to locate the absurdity in the central situations and goes for midget jokes instead. In the end, you're not sure if you're supposed to be watching "The Three Amigos" or "Hotel Rwanda."
 

 
 "The Hunting Party." MPAA  rating: R for strong language and some violent content. Running time: 1 hour, 43 minutes. In wide release.   

The Hunting Party , Richard Shepard's rowdy, sharp-edged celebration of journalistic hubris  it's your basic, everyday comic romp through Bosnia  is based on Scott Anderson's 2000 Esquire story. But it's more like a remake of Oliver Stone's Salvador  that's too jadedly madcap to take itself seriously. Richard Gere, who has reinvented his career, merrily, by playing motor-mouthed hustlers with a heart, has a high old time as Simon Hunt, a fallen TV network correspondent who is hooked on danger. When his old buddy, the ace cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard), pops up in Bosnia to shoot a soft-news feature, Hunt resurfaces with a mad ambition. He wants to land an interview with ''the Fox,'' the most wanted of Bosnia's war criminals  and, just maybe, to capture him in the process.
To call this plan quixotic would be an understatement. The Fox, who is the film's thinly fictionalized version of Radovan Karadzic, oversaw the rape and slaughter of thousands of Muslims, and is still protected by men devoted to his cause. Trying to get to him is a bit like trying to get to Osama bin Laden. What makes The Hunting Party  an original, gonzo treat is the way that Shepard plants the movie's tone somewhere between hair-trigger investigative danger and the from-the-frying-pan-into-the-fire glee of a Hope/Crosby picture. It's Road to the Belly of the Beast .
As they drive through the Bosnian countryside, which looks disquietingly like somewhere in Oregon, Gere keeps us guessing whether Hunt's zeal for the story is ''moral'' or simply addictive. Howard, in the second-banana role, is a perfect foil  his slower, guarded rhythms are the equivalent of raised eyebrows  and Jesse Eisenberg, from The Squid and the Whale , shows a crack comic instinct as the network executive's son who talks his way into traveling with the two men and ends up improvising their most daring gambit. Everyone winds up believing that they're working for the CIA  a good, lightweight joke. What isn't so easy to laugh off is the prospect of a movie that uses ethnic cleansing as a springboard for laughs. I left feeling a bit uncomfortable, but the fact that Shepard gets away with it at all is a testament to his talent.


 In “The Hunting Party,” a misfired, misguided would-be satire set in postwar Bosnia, Richard Gere plays one of those Fourth Estate burnouts who periodically lurch into the movies. There’s the regulation flask, a week’s worth of whiskers and the pouched eyes that have seen a world of sorrows, and even more closing times. Marinating in booze and his own sour juices, he is meant to look worn out and nearly used up, punch-drunk on man’s inhumanity to man (and to woman and child and dog). He probably had a Humphrey Bogart poster on his dorm-room wall and a Hunter S. Thompson paperback in his back pocket.  Bogie didn’t have to work at tired; those eyes were weary in utero. For all his beard growth and effort, the appealing Mr. Gere looks like a manicured star whose expensive flesh is regularly anointed in oil and receives plenty of B12 and exercise. He doesn’t look as if he keeps company with misery, though that’s precisely what his character, Simon Hunt, does. A onetime star television reporter who suffered an on-camera meltdown while reporting from Bosnia in the mid-1990s, Simon now roams the globe’s really big horror shows and tries to sell the bad news freelance. He’s a stumblebum in the big geopolitical ring, though mostly he’s just a reassuring cliché, the good guy gone only superficially south.  “The Hunting Party” was written and directed by Richard Shepard (“The Matador”), and owes its gonzo setup to a 2000 Esquire article by Scott Anderson. In brief, Mr. Anderson and four other journalist pals, all of whom had covered the Bosnian war, popped into Sarajevo for a reunion on their way to some R & R on the Adriatic coast. One improbability led to another, and before long the five (including Sebastian Junger) were mistaken for a C.I.A. hit squad on the hunt for the fugitive Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Toward the end of their escapade an American military officer turned to them and declared that it “would make a helluva movie,” which apparently set light bulbs to glowing above some producer’s head.  The article isn’t really funny; it’s dark, glib and knowing and, weighing in at a little over 6,300 words, a fast read. There’s no sign of anyone who remotely sounds or behaves like Simon Hunt, no doubt because a working journalist who gets the job done like Mr. Junger isn’t as sexy sounding as a wreck of a reporter who has been ennobled both by personal tragedy (cue the gauzy flashback) and by his contempt for mainstream journalism.  Much like those renegade cops who always work outside the very system that produced them (a system that, natch, finally does bow to the righteousness of the renegade), the only good movie journalist is one who tells off the guys wearing ties cosseted safely back in the newsroom.  Of course Simon really does want back in the good graces of the suits (the pay’s better), which explains why he sweet-talks his former cameraman, Duck (the great Terrence Howard, wasted), into a Balkan misadventure. Together with a network executive’s son (Jesse Eisenberg, a graduate of the Woody Allen institute of hand wringing), the three go looking for a Serbian villain (Ljubomir Kerekes), a sneering smoothie with the carefully coiffed hair of a French intellectual.  Mr. Shepard tilts the camera, freezes the action and unleashes a veritable carnival sideshow — potato ladies, a mustachioed functionary, oily thugs, even a midget towing a giant — which adds noise, certainly. The tone lurches from maudlin to arch to frantic. Every so often a corpse pops up on screen as a reminder of just how unfunny this whole thing is.  “The Hunting Party” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some bloody violence and a whole lot of cussing.

Proceeding with the same tone of cynical world-weariness that proved a mixed blessing in his debut feature, "The Matador," writer-director Richard Shepard fictionalizes a real-life tale of journos recklessly tracking down a Bosnian war criminal in "The Hunting Party." Alternately glib, superficial and amusing, pic vainly attempts to absorb some degree of Serbian irony into a story that's unavoidably lessened by its privileged American vantage point. The war-can-be-fun mood may not go over well in the current climate, serving up major challenges for MGM (handling Stateside release) and QED Intl.Shepard's strategy for fictionalizing Scott K. Anderson's Esquire mag piece contrasts in telling ways with Michael Winterbottom's "Welcome to Sarajevo," still the best account of Western correspondents in the war-torn Balkans. While latter developed as an honestly sober yet intensely charged docudrama, Shepard's film has star TV news correspondent Simon Hunt (Richard Gere) and loyal camera operator Duck (Terrence Howard, also narrating his first-person account) dashing around the 1994 Bosnian war as if they've jumped out of a jokey buddy movie.
War is some kind of game for Simon, for whom self-endangerment is the only way to live. The movie often wants auds to view it the same way, and such irreverence is clearly Shepard's preferred metier, something he exercised considerably in "The Matador." But in the context of the ongoing Bosnian tragedy, it's an approach that tends to lay its own mines, as the pursuit of gallows humor -- and from an outsider to the conflict at hand, no less -- can come off as terribly callous.

When Simon goes emotionally over the edge during a live feed from the front, his stellar career suddenly collapses (unlikely, given his supposed stature), and he's reduced to filing reports for various backwater outlets. Duck has moved into cushier posts in the intervening years, but when he accompanies network anchorman Franklin (ideally cast James Brolin) on a trip to survey Bosnia a decade after the war, Simon pursues Duck and tries to sell him on an outrageous idea: As reporters, they will score an exclusive with the Fox (Ljubomir Kerekes), murderer of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and the most wanted man in the Balkans.

Young Benjamin (smartly cast Jesse Eisenberg), a network exec's son assigned to produce Franklin's reports in the field, insists on coming with them. This impossible trio on an impossible mission inadvertently arouses thesuspicions of U.N. peacekeeping official Boris (Mark Ivanir), who assumes the group is CIA -- utterly incorrect, of course, but Simon convinces himself (if not quite anyone else) that this is a viable cover for their Fox hunt.

Shepard's script runs into certain mechanical difficulties when it provides several flashbacks to the war and the causes for Simon's emotional breakdown. The device allows for pic's early snide tone to slip into something more serious and even melodramatic later on, but it never feels like more than a storytelling trick. In the end, political brownie points -- targeting the CIA and the West for failing to nail genocidal thugs -- are too easily scored, given how the film casts Yank war correspondents as lovable antiheroes.

To his credit, Gere has loads of fun with Simon, letting loose with some of the best acting of his career as a guy all too aware of his own mortality and the high-stakes gamble he's throwing himself into. Howard is considerably upstaged, and after his amusing intro, his Duck never quite passes the credibility test. Eisenberg is starting to patent a personal form of innocent deadpan that gives him a distinctive place in the busy pic. Diane Kruger, Ivanir, Brolin and Kerekes leave strong supporting impressions.

David Tattersall's sleek widescreen lensing and gifted production designer Jan Roelfs' rock-hard realist production design magnificently serve pic in every scene, the only deficit being Rolfe Kent's off-putting score.


Simon (Richard Gere ) and Duck (Terrence Howard ) are hot-shit reporters in the hot zone, drinking and carousing their way through the graveyards of countless war-torn countries. Like all war correspondents inhabiting satirical, cynical movies about their flak-jacketed ilk, they're having a blast, till Simon cracks up on camera during a live report from Bosnia . They go their separate ways: Duck to a cushy New York gig as cameraman, Simon to God knows where. They're reunited in Bosnia on the fifth anniversary of reunification, and as the small talk turns to discussions of war crimes and the United Nations ' failure to bring to justice war criminals brazenly listing themselves in the phone book, Simon convinces his old pal Duck to join him on one last adventure: to find a Serbian war criminal hiding deep in the woods, where he now hunts animals instead of men. Also along for the ride is sweet, innocent Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg ), a network VP's kid out to prove he's more than just the sum of his pop's paycheck. Like many of the best movies about war and its lingering echo, The Hunting Party  is full of dark humor. Writer-director Richard Shepard, maker of 2005's The Matador , is becoming a master at finding the right tone, balancing the seriousness of his characters' purpose with the madness of their intentions. He's also found his styleand it's noisy and sentimental and crude and a total goddamned blast.
