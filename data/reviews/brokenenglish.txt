         A wry, charming romance about a New York woman who has given up hope of finding love, or even a decent night out, Zoe Cassavetes' debut feature "Broken English" stars Parker Posey as Nora Wilder, whose middle to late 30s  have bottomed out in a rut of aimless socializing, boring work and generalized anxiety. On furlough from playing the cartoonish loose cannon, the always-riveting and criminally underused Posey gives a beautifully calibrated performance, possibly her most realized and multidimensional to date.
 
 Nora is the guest services director at a boutique hotel, where she spends her days catering to other people's whims. Her best friend, Audrey (Drea de Matteo) is half-heartedly married to the man Nora's mother Vivien (Gena Rowlands, the director's mother in real life) thinks Nora let get away. After a  fling with an actor leads to a humiliating letdown, Nora follows her mother's advice to "go everywhere, even when you don't feel like it." Braving a goony co-worker's  party, she meets a  Frenchman in a straw fedora who shares her bad luck in love but not her distrust of it.
 


         






   Julien (Melvil Poupaud) and Nora spend a weekend knocking around the city, which couldn't be more enjoyable to watch. Nora unfurls, retracts, stumbles and panics while the laid-back Julien remains, unbelievably in her eyes, calmly by her side. The title refers not only to the slight language barrier — Nora hears Julien's "I'm hungry" as "I'm angry" — but also to her eroded trust. Nora's relationships with her mother, a loopy and formidable source of support and pressure, and her best friend are nuanced and true to life.
 
 Shot on location in New York and Paris, "Broken English" avoids familiar landmarks as assiduously as Cassavetes' script avoids the usual single girl clichés. A simple, empathetic script and calm, assured directing  display a level of emotional honesty and character development that's confoundingly rare  these days, especially when it comes to female characters.
 
 From the first scene, in which Nora gets ready to go to Audrey's anniversary party, she draws us into the character's life without so much as a word. The scene invites you to enter an inner world that extends well beyond the small rooms and similar days she inhabits. With no bigger, or less formidable, foes than her shyness and insecurity, Nora eventually embarks on a series of solitary adventures in Paris. Her adventures may seem like no big deal, but much like trusting that we'll want to spend time with an ordinary, well-observed character, it feels like something brave.

As charmingly verklemmt  New York women with bad luck in men and good luck in apartments go, Nora Wilder in Broken English  has all the breaks. For one thing, she's played by Parker Posey, who can salvage even the ditziest of Manhattanite characters with one scrunch of her bright face. For another, just when Nora's about to give up hope for the umpteenth time on her ability to appreciate just what a posy she is and after she has been validated by her more functional friend Audrey (The Sopranos ' Drea de Matteo, leaving all traces of Adriana behind), she meets Julien (Time to Leave 's Melvil Poupaud). He's a handsome Frenchman with chic stubble, a straw fedora, and a way with cigarettes to die for, and the two have lots of vertical and horizontal fun before and after sunset, until he returns to Paris. Then Nora drags her cute tushie about going there to find him. But she does. She even misses her plane in a manner that ought to make Richard Linklater suspicious.
The tour of Manhattan and Paris is fun in a privileged Sex and the City  way, but the wish-fulfillment content is awfully flimsy in this debut from writer-director Zoe Cassavetes, who casts her mother, Gena Rowlands, in a small role as Nora's own get-with-it-sweetie dynamo of a sophisticated mom. Why now for Nora, and why a French monsieur? Pourquoi pas , says the filmmaker  who's engaged to a Frenchman.


 The low-key comedy “Broken English,” about a romance-scarred professional woman named Nora Wilder (Parker Posey) who invigorates her life with help from a handsome, sensitive, fedora-clad Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud), is a textbook example of an Indiewood film: a Hollywood fantasy wrapped in plain brown paper.  Its contradictory  message is something like: “Listen up, 30-something single women; there is no Prince Charming. Oh, wait a minute ... Yes, there is!”  Written and directed by the first-time feature filmmaker Zoe Cassavetes, daughter of the pioneering independent director John Cassavetes, “Broken English” seems blithely unaware of the bait-and-switch that it will ultimately pull. In its first half-hour, while it charts Nora’s repetitious life as a hip hotel’s guest relations manager and establishes her serial disappointment in love, it promises a bracing response to Hollywood falseness: a comedy about a woman who realizes that she’s unhappy because what she thought were high standards were actually items on a romantic and sexual shopping list absorbed from a bankrupt popular culture.  The right age? Check. Interesting job? Check. Looks like a catalog model? Check. What are you doing Friday?  As played by Ms. Posey, who tamps down the vivacious kookiness that has made her an independent-film darling, Nora is the sort of cute mope that might appear in a screenplay emblazoned with Kate Winslet’s coffee stains.  Her online search for a single man in her age bracket yields no results. She agrees to go on a date set up by her grandchild-obsessed mother (played by Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes’s widow and frequent leading lady and Ms. Cassavetes’s mom), but finds that her prospective suitor (Josh Hamilton, in a note-perfect cameo) is still smitten with his ex-girlfriend.  And a marriage that she has always viewed as ideal — between her best friend, Audrey (Drea de Matteo), and Audrey’s director husband, Mark (Tim Guinee) — is collapsing, thanks to Mark’s fixation on a prospective leading lady who embodies his own romantic fantasies.  The film’s smartest sequence finds Nora flouting her hotel’s no-fraternization policy to go out with a V.I.P. guest, a rising movie star named Nick Gable (Justin Theroux, in the movie’s most complex and surprising performance).  Nick, a man-child with a mohawk that appears to be woven from Sasquatch fur, presents himself as a truth-seeking artist who craves a simple life with a woman who’s not in show business. We quickly deduce a truth that Nora wills herself not to see: Nick is a pure narcissist who sees his date with Nora as an acting challenge — an audition for a one-night stand.  These early, squirm-inducing scenes portend a film that will refute Hollywood romantic comedy’s wish-fulfillment tendencies with a rude dose of reality. Then the hunky, puppy dog Frenchman shows up, and the film’s daring impulses exit stage left.  Mr. Poupaud’s Julien is like a dreamboat from HBO’s “Sex and the City” without the inevitable neurotic downsides. Aside from a brief, awkward conversation in which Julien declares skepticism about monogamy and then reverses himself, his only apparent flaw is that he’s going back to Paris soon — which means, of course, that Nora will have to quit her job and go to Paris to find Julien, and herself.  This is a studio executive’s idea of risk taking, in the same questionable spirit as the 1987 hit “Baby Boom,” in which Diane Keaton played a career woman who inherited an infant and gave up her corporate job in exchange for a thriving small business, a gigantic country house and the love of Sam Shepard.  “Broken English” is a well-acted, smartly directed film that’s depressing because it could have amounted to so much more. It departs from the studio-financed romantic-comedy template in just one, unfortunately fatal respect: it makes a point of pride out of rejecting cliché, then swoons into its embrace.  “Broken English” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some sexual content, brief drug use and language.

A pitch-perfect lead performance by Parker Posey and debuting feature writer-helmer Zoe Cassavetes' deft, low-key approach raise "Broken English" a couple notches above the usual run of lonely-single-woman-seeking-romance-in-the-big-city yarns. Though there's little unfamiliar here, pic's tipping the scales more toward latent-depression drama and away from typical rom-com situation gags (the humor here is more offhand) makes it seem truer to life than many similar exercises. HD-shot feature could connect with heroine's own general demographic in theatrical release with careful outreach, though lack of obvious hooks and eventual falloff in narrative drive will prove less problematic in drumming up ancillary sales.
Thirty-five-ish Nora (Posey) is very good at what she does--deal with VIP needs and orchestrate special events as guest relations chief at a Manhattan boutique hotel--even if she'd once hoped to work in the art world. Nor has her personal life worked out as expected, a fact driven home at start by the fifth wedding anniversary of best friend Audrey (Drea de Matteo) and still-adoring husband (Tim Guinee)...even if the female half of this "perfect couple" isn't so happy as she appears.
Still, marriage gone slightly stale is a lot more than Nora has gotten close to, and as her well-meaning but tactless mother (Gena Rowlands) points out, "the good ones get snapped up" all too quickly "at your age." Nora vacillates between forcibly "putting herself out there" as friends urge, and abstaining entirely from the ever-disappointing dating realm. Further evidence in favor of withdrawal is provided by Nick Gable (Justin Theroux), a well-known actor and hotel guest who seduces Nora one drunken evening; the next day a celebrity gossip show on national TV informs her that he's involved with his costar. A blind date with seemingly nice, normal Charlie (Josh Hamilton) ends when they run into his recent ex, after which he tearfully admits he's "not over her yet."
Thus Nora is not in an receptive frame of mind when she drags herself to a nerdy co-worker's (Michael Panes) sparsely attended 4th of July party. She's about to flee when his visiting friend Julien (Melvil Poupaud) arrives--a handsome, younger Frenchman whose attentiveness is so intense and ardent it's got to be an act. Or does it? Their time together is brief but (mostly) idyllic.
When Julien must return to Paris a few days later, he impulsively asks her to "run away with" him, though they barely know each other and she speaks no French. But she's too cowardly (or perhaps realistic) to make such a blind leap.
The bleak return to everyday life, however, pushes Nora to the brink of clinically depressive stasis. (Which the film plays straight-up, though without making a histrionic fuss about it.) Accompanied by the pushier Audrey, she flies to Paris to find Julien, though since he has a common name and she's lost his phone number, that proves a near-hopeless task.
While traipsing to Paris usually gives romantic comedies a big lift, here it actually makes narrative drag a bit, as Nora wanders aimlessly around the city. A formulaic but satisfying, underplayed twist of fate ends pic on a warm note, however.
Cassavetes (daughter of Rowlands and the late John) has crafted a screenplay that nicely balances seriousness and wit, negotiating familiar territory with enough alert intelligence to avoid excess deja vu. As a director, she seems mostly focused on the very good performances, which are often funny but more subtle than the norm for this terrain. Pic is otherwisely competently crafted if lacking much panache, esp. visually. (Color palatte in particular is rather dull.) Allowed to shade character more delicately than in her outright comedy roles, Posey easily carries the whole enterprise on her petite shoulders. 
Ethereal electronica score by Scratch Massive is a plus in modest but decent production package.

Nothing has turned out as expected for Nora, the drifting, doleful heroine played by Parker Posey  in Broken English, writer/ director Zoe Cassavetes 's feature debut. Confront-ed in her mid-30s by a sinkhole of unaddressed expectationsonly a few of them her own we meet Nora as she attempts to slog through a backlog of doubt and uncertainty without going under completely.
The opening sequencea wry riff on the primping montage so common to this film's spiritual godmother, Sex and the City  features Posey dressing for the fifth-anniversary party of her friend Audrey (Drea de Matteo ), whose husband is the man that Nora's mother (Gena Rowlands ) insists she should have married. The party girl no more, Posey imbues this silent ritual with a world of resignation and burgeoning resentment, the novelty of pulling on one more party dress long extinguished.
There are key similarities between Nora's foggy neurosis and the characters Posey recently played in Fay Grim  and The Oh in Ohio ; if urban female confusion is the new suburban male confusion, surely Posey's lost and wary eyes are the face of that angst. Nora lives alone and hates her job coddling the VIP guests of a Manhattan boutique hotel. Before sleeping with a fussy movie star on the premises (a mohawked, smooth-talkin' Justin Theroux ), Nora admits that she always thought she'd work in the art world. A beautiful woman with the curious big-city habit of accepting loneliness as her lot, Posey is beguiling for the first third of Broken English ; lovely, fragile, and tense, she's the lonely girl who screens her phone calls and winces at compliments with tweaked ambivalence. Combining Posey's performance with lingering pacing and an eye for alienation in a city of millions, Cassavetes's standard material takes on the promise of something fresh.
Alas, we must wait on for a fully realized investigation of what Nora's mother suggests is eatingand paralyzingyoung women in the city today: too many choices. When the Man- hattan man shortage threatens to doom the inexhaustibly stylish Nora (this girl has cute tops for days) to a life of closet rearrangement, a charming Frenchman swoops in with some grade-A Euro-lovin'. Julian (Melvil Poupaud ) is instantly smitten by Nora's letter-perfect, twitchy New Yorker routine, complete with a public panic attack. Their affair is brief but tender, and Nora's timid practicality prevents her from pursuing it past his stay in New York. . . .
Until, that is, she has an epiphany and takes off to Paris in search of Julian, and the film devolves into stilted-foreigner scenarios and self-help platitudes. Nora's initially existential problems become nothing that a romantic pick- me-up can't fix, and efforts to indicate otherwise feel tacked-on and disingenuous. Posey remains touching as the woman with happiness in sight but bewilderingly out of reach, yet in paraphrasing the final lines of Before Sunrise for Broken English 's closing scene, the director only highlights how her film suffers in comparison.
