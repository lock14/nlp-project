It isn't often you get to meet the devil in all his glory, but here he is in ``Deliver Us From Evil," and his name is Father Oliver O'Grady.
A California priest who raped dozens of children from the 1970s until his arrest in 1993 -- and who now lives in Ireland, a free man -- ``Father Ollie" was consistently protected by the diocese hierarchy, which moved him from one mid-state parish to another whenever complaints arose. Amy Berg's scalding documentary wonders who's the greater sinner: the deeply sick man who couldn't control his impulses or the churchmen who knowingly allowed his reign of destruction to continue.
Maybe you're burned out on tales of pedophile priests after the local events of recent years. Fair enough, but Berg convincingly argues that what happened in California -- where well over 400 Catholic priests have been accused of sexual abuse -- dwarfs what occurred in Boston. The film gives agonized voice to victims and their parents (and their attorneys), to theologians and child-abuse experts, and to the Rev. Thomas Doyle, who in 1985 warned the Vatican about the looming scandal and who has battled uphill on behalf of victims since.
Most shockingly, ``Deliver Us From Evil" lets us hear from O'Grady himself. Interviewed by Berg in Ireland, the ex-priest is remorseful, freakishly candid, and eerily disassociated from the immense swath of psychological damage he left in his wake. With a bashful half-grin, he speaks of touching boys and girls where he shouldn't have, and he almost has us convinced it could
 have been a momentary aberration until we hear from Ann Jyono and Nancy Sloan, women whose voices shake as they describe the regular, forceful sex acts visited upon them when they were as young as 5 .
At one point, O'Grady sends a letter out to his victims, inviting them to Ireland so he can personally apologize. ``It's going to be an interesting reunion," he muses, his delusion complete. Responds Adam, one of the abused, ``I get so angry to think that guy's still alive. I would kill his mother." The meeting never takes place.
The deeper rage, of the victims and the film, is reserved for a Catholic hierarchy headed by Cardinal Roger Mahoney, who knew O'Grady and protected him before Mahoney ascended to the position of archbishop of L A. Mahoney isn't interviewed in ``Deliver" -- no one from the diocese would speak to Berg -- but his videotaped testimony from recent civil suits offers a damning portrait of an entrenched bureaucracy clinging to power by obfuscation and stonewalling.
Just in case you're unclear about where his superiors stood on O'Grady: They offered (and he accepted) a lifetime annuity in exchange for not testifying about their treatment of him. ``My parents don't get a pension from the church!" cries Jyono in bewilderment.
``Deliver Us From Evil" strains, however, to make a larger case: that the sexual abuse of children by priests is so deeply ingrained that its roots go back to the fifth century, when celibacy was implemented by the church to get control of priestly assets. Interesting theory, but the evidence here is drive-by.
Grander statements aren't needed when the specific indictments are so plentiful and so horrifying. There have been recent news reports that the Los Angeles District Attorney's office is considering charges against Mahoney, based on O'Grady's comments in this film. ``Deliver Us From Evil" wonders if the church could possibly do a better job of destroying faith, in itself as an institution and in religion in general. ``There is no God," mourns Jyono's father, once a devout Catholic. ``All these rules are made by man."


The central figure in Deliver Us From Evil , Amy Berg's brilliant and psychologically transfixing documentary about child sex abuse within the Catholic Church, is Father Oliver O'Grady, a convicted pedophile who served seven years in jail  and now roams free in his native Ireland  a 60ish chap speaking with soft candor about his crimes. With a flash of a smile and a voice of musical Irish eloquence, ''Father Ollie'' has a flowing charm; at first, there's something almost reassuring about  him. As he speaks of his desires for young girls and boys, his tone is steady, abashed, sincere, remorseful. For all the headline disclosures of recent years, the scandal of sexually abusive priests  the deeper personal truth of it  remains  shrouded in veils of secrecy and shame, and so one is relieved to see a man like O'Grady,  who appears to want to own up to what he did.
Yet the more you listen to him, and the more you hear testimony about his behavior (his victims were as young as nine months), it becomes clear that he's a born manipulator who is playing the audience, using the drama of his confession to defuse and soft-pedal his crimes. Berg, a former producer for CBS and CNN, interviews several of O'Grady's victims, whom he molested in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, and they offer some of the most  intimate and lacerating testimony to the horror of child sexual abuse that I have ever heard. Their stories, which detail the seduction of whole families, the ''affection'' and violation that O'Grady got away with by preying on their reverence and trust, convey how these children had fissures ripped in their souls  wounds that will likely never heal. ''People gotta understand,'' moans Bob Jyono, a parent of one of the abuse survivors. ''He's not a pedophile, he's a rapist .''
Layer by layer, Berg uncovers how Father Ollie rooted his monstrous serial abuse in the sanctimony he enjoyed as a priest. As the dispenser of the Eucharist, he was a literal link to Christ, and the film makes the startling point that within the priesthood, since any sexual act is regarded as a sin, a sin of child abuse can be confessed away, can be forgiven , as surely as any other. The brilliance of Deliver Us From Evil   what makes the film a revelation and not just a rehash of headlines  is the way that Berg portrays a kind of terrifying psychological chain, linking the abuse, the obscene entitlement experienced by a man like O'Grady, and the squirmy arrogance of the Catholic authorities who, in effect, hid his crimes, giving allowance to child rape because they believed their mission to be above sin.
That's certainly the sense we get from the taped depositions of church leaders, who speak in sweaty bureaucratic Nixonian murmurs. Chief among them is Cardinal Roger Mahony, who as a bishop bumped O'Grady from one California parish to the next, generally 50 miles away from the last. The reason? The movie forcefully argues that any hint of scandal in Mahony's diocese would have impeded his rise in the church. (Mahony and the church have denied these allegations.) Deliver Us From Evil  shows us how the business of saving souls can rationalize the obscenity of selling them.

 “Deliver Us From Evil,” Amy Berg’s important, hard-to-watch debut feature, is not the first documentary about the sexual abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church — Kirby Dick’s “Twist of Faith” was nominated for an Oscar last year  — and it will probably not be the last. Pedophilia is not a subject most are eager to think about, but these days it seems impossible to avoid. Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg’s film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority.  What gives the film some of its unnerving power is that, in addition to giving voice to some of the victims of abuse, it spends a lot of time with a perpetrator. Oliver O’Grady is now a silver-haired, twinkly-eyed resident of Ireland, where Ms. Berg often films him in parks and near playgrounds, with children nearby. In the 1970’s and 80’s, while serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California, he molested children over and over again, both boys and girls, including, it is reported, a 9-month-old.  Perhaps the creepiest thing about Mr. O’Grady — who was eventually imprisoned, unfrocked and deported to Ireland, where he had grown up — is the contrast between his present demeanor and his past actions. When recalling his crimes, he sometimes chuckles, not spitefully but almost warmly, as if what he had done were silly rather than unspeakably sordid. Although he does not deny anything, he takes refuge in euphemism, explaining that he was often “overly affectionate” with his young parishioners and apologizing for having “offended” them.  His mild, almost merry manner stands in brutal contrast to the pain expressed by Bob and Maria Jyono, whose daughter, Ann, was among Mr. O’Grady’s victims. Mr. Jyono, a Japanese-American Buddhist, converted to Catholicism when he married his wife, whom he met in Ireland. Mr. O’Grady — then Father O’Grady — became a virtual member of their family, spending many nights in their home while he was molesting their daughter. “Molesting? He raped her,” Mr. Jyono, a quiet, thoughtful man, cries out at one point, and his anguish at the violation of his daughter, his trust and his faith is almost unbearable to witness.  But Ms. Berg pushes further, sifting through videotaped depositions of some of Mr. O’Grady’s supervising bishops, including Roger Cardinal Mahony, the current archbishop of Los Angeles, to argue that the culpability is not Mr. O’Grady’s alone. In a pattern by now familiar, Mr. O’Grady’s superiors dealt with the threat he posed by transferring him from one parish to another, where he was free to find new prey. Reports were filed, claims were made, but the eminences have only vague recollections and abstractions to offer. It almost goes without saying that no one from the church agreed to be interviewed in the film.  That silence — affirmed when Ann Jyono and another of Mr. O’Grady’s victims, Nancy Sloan, are turned away by guards at the Vatican as they try to deliver a letter to the newly installed Pope Benedict XVI — cedes the floor to the church’s critics. These include Father Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer and historian who has become a leading advocate for survivors of clerical sexual abuse; Mary Gail Frawley O’Dea, a psychologist; and several of the lawyers representing victims in civil suits. They all point to the hierarchical, secretive, authoritarian nature of the Roman Catholic Church as a central reason for its failure to deal effectively with the likes of Mr. O’Grady.  It would be interesting to hear a response, apart from the canard that the sexual abuse crisis in the church is actually anti-Catholic bigotry or disobedience by a corrupted laity. The Los Angeles district attorney is apparently seeking further answers, spurred in part by some of Mr. O’Grady’s testimony in this film. But for now, “Deliver Us From Evil” makes the case that justice remains undone.

Amy Berg's galvanizing docu "Deliver Us From Evil" examines chronic pedophilia, and worse, among longtime priests. It's hard to imagine even devout Catholics coming away from the film without a sense of rage at a religion that appears to value members of the priesthood over the well-being of children. Word-of-mouth, critical support and renewed media attention are sure to bump the pic's profile to national and international levels, with solid prospects for theatrical and ancillary biz. 
Between "The Da Vinci Code" and, now, "Deliver Us From Evil," the Vatican is having a bad year at the movies. But unlike "Code," Berg's account is based on detailed reporting in presenting the dreadful history of serial sex offender Oliver O'Grady, an ex-priest now in exile in Eire. Berg uses her experience as a producer for CNN and CBS News to detail O'Grady's story, told not only by the victims and the families but -- most astonishingly -- by O'Grady himself.
So harsh and damning is the pic toward the current Catholic leadership -- personified by Los Angeles-based Cardinal Roger Mahony, who oversaw O'Grady's stewardship at various central California parishes in the 1970s and '80s, that charges the church operates "like the Mafia" sound spot-on. Such damnation is echoed by former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who investigated church indifference to priest pedophilia and its protection of accused priests from law enforcement.
If "Deliver Us" can be chided for anything, it is its hackneyed use of personal portraits illustrating big topics. Gradually, the accounts of victims Nancy Sloan, Ann Jyono and Adam M. (refusing to provide his last name, despite appearing on camera) are heard, all of them in shocking detail.
It's bad enough to hear Adam recall being forced to have sex as a boy with his trusted priest in the parish church, but what makes "Deliver Us From Evil" a genuine horror movie is hearing O'Grady recall similar incidents, yet with little outward display of shame. He shifts from a mild defensiveness -- "I merely wanted to cuddle the children, because I loved them" -- to a barely formed awareness of his profound mental and sexual disorder, to a thoroughly shocking conclusion: That by writing letters of apology to each of his hundreds of victims, he would also invite them all to meet with him personally for some sort of "reconciliation."
The viewer is unambiguously meant to consider Hannah Arendt's notion of the banality of evil writ large. Controversial pic charges that Mahony and the Vatican itself allowed the O'Grady's behavior to continue for decades. The already well-documented case is amply laid out by Berg with a reporter's sense of detail and clarity.
Still, the pic has a strong critical voice that feels redundant at points in its inclusion of reform-minded Catholic priest Tom Doyle. It's enough to watch Ann Jyono's stoic and silent father Bob heart-wrenchingly break down before Berg's camera.
Production values and lensing exude elegance, providing the pic with a sheen several degrees above TV-scale non-fiction work. Lack of narration is a plus.
Not surprisingly, as a closing graphic notes, Berg could not convince Catholic officials to sit for her camera. For his part, O'Grady was convicted, then released from prison, and currently lives free in Ireland under church protection.

Of all the hundreds of pedophile priests to be flushed out of the woodwork in recent Catholic Church history, Father Oliver O'Grady  has to be one of the most harmless looking, and the most sinister. Wispy, unremarkable, and accommodating, with an ingratiating half-smile playing permanently about his thin lips, Father Ollie, as he was known to the California parishioners who for 20 years fed him, housed him, and invariably entrusted him with the spiritual care of their children, was also a wily and ruthless predator who had sex with mothers if that got him close enough to fondle, rape, and sodomize their kids, from newborn babies to teenagers. Now, after serving half of a 14-year sentence in the U.S., he lives free as a bird in Ireland , billeted with a family that knows nothing of his past, and reporting to no onesave for the Catholic Church, which has dangled a retirement annuity in front of his nose in exchange for dropping off the planet. Only, Father O'Grady has been shafted by his protectors, and he's ready to sing like a canary. Among other things, he loves the attention.
When a major distributor like Lionsgate  releases a documentary on an inflamed social issue like child molestation, one expects the worst kind of pandering to the public hysteria so skillfully exposed in Andrew Jarecki 's Capturing the Friedmans . But Amy Berg 's Deliver Us From Evil , which begins as a portrait of a damaged monster and skillfully fans out to his many victims and enablers, lifts the subject clean out of private pathology into the realm where it belongs: the rampant and systematic abuse of theological and institutional power. There's no denying that Father Ollie is a very sick cookie with a criminal record that would have driven many a less well defended molester to suicide long ago, whose scariest coping device is a habit of dissociation that not only allowed him to continue violating helpless children for so long, but now allows him to become a star witness against himself. We see him in videotaped testimony and with Berg, calmly recounting the where, what, and how of his hundreds of conquestsone can't call them seductions, since by the accounts of his prey, now predictably troubled adults, he simply got them to a quiet place and bent them to his will. Celibacy, currently fingered as the chief culprit in priestly abuse, is neither here nor there in Father Ollie's case, for he freely admits (that naughty-boy smile again) that nothing in the adult body turns him on as much as the smooth flesh of a tot in a swimsuit.
For the most part, Berg is a self-effacing presence, a quiet voice prodding discreetly when O'Grady occasionally flags or dodges a tough question. But you can see her background in television news (she has worked for CNN  and on 60 Minutes  ) in a tendency to gild the visual lily. She shoots O'Grady in a cavernous cathedral, his face in strenuously symbolic shadow, or leaning over park railings eyeballing children at play. Personally, I could have done without the stagey drama and huggy shots of O'Grady's victims embracing before they set off on a fruitless attempt to get a sympathetic ear from the Vatican . Still, that takes the action to where it properly belongs, as Berg, armed with anguished testimony from the families of the abused and their lawyers, coolly serves up incontrovertible evidence that the Church knew about O'Grady's activities and moved him from parish to parish so as to avoid public scandal and the sabotaging of highly placed careers.
The sorry saga of stonewalling, buck passing, and brazen lying that has infected the Church's response at the highest levels is old newsfrom Cardinal Roger Mahoney , still sitting pretty today as the Archbishop of Los Angeles (despite having lied through his teeth about how much he knew in the O'Grady case), to Pope Benedict  (who presided over committees looking into priestly abuse before he took office) to George Bush  (who granted him immunity from prosecution). But I don't know of anyone else who has laid out the underhanded mechanics of it all in such scrupulous detail. With the aid of Father Tom Doyle , a canon lawyer, historian, and activist against abuse who opened his mouth and paid a hefty career price, Berg probes deeper to show how enforced celibacy and warped attitudes toward sex create a sexualized priesthood, and how Church theology especially the Eucharist, which at once aggrandizes the priest as an intimate of Christ and infantilizes his flockconspires with a careerist hierarchy to create fertile ground for corruption. Berg by no means excuses Father O'Grady, but she offers evidence of a devastating childhood that explains his pathology. For the ambitious creeps who allowed him to indulge it, and who still sit in office, there's no excuse.
