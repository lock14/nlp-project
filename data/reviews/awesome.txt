From its full, unprintable title on down, "Awesome; I . . . Shot That!" is the anti-"Neil Young: Heart of Gold." Where the Jonathan Demme movie is elegiac, graceful, and unconcerned with audience shots, this one's in-your-face, of the moment, and filmed from the trenches. It's raucous and loud as hell; the hyperactive editing could trigger grand mal seizures.
It's a Beastie Boys concert movie -- what did you expect?
On Oct. 9, 2004, before the Beasties took to the stage of New York's Madison Square Garden as part of their "Challah at Your Boy" tour, they handed out 50 Hi-8 digital video cameras to fans. The one rule: Keep shooting. Augmented by professional video footage shot onstage, the resulting document captures the concert from everywhere at once: the mosh pit and the nosebleed seats, the back of the hall and fifth row center. There are short trips to the bathroom and the concessions stand, and there's one poor slob who sneaks his camera backstage and almost gets locked out of the arena.
The songs come from all over the Beastie Boys' 20-year career, and if it's true that Adrock (Adam Horovitz), MCA (Adam Yauch) and Mike D (Michael Diamond) are getting pretty old for their bratty white-boy-rapper shtick to seem more than a pose, their love of a hard beat, a good sample, a sardonic rhyme, and -- this is important -- their audience keeps them honest. (For all that, the most stunning contribution may be that of DJ Mix Master Mike, who provides the musical grid on which the Beasties hang their raps and who works the booth like a Paderewski of the turntables.)
"Awesome" has a three-part structure. Early numbers like "Triple Trouble" and "Hello Brooklyn" are presented kinetically but straightforwardly, with gritty images beaming in from all over the Garden; when the Beasties divide the arena into thirds for a shout-along to "Time to Get Ill," that ancient concert ploy gets a boost from our being in all parts of the audience (it's as if the camera itself were doing the wave).
The band members briefly retire and come back out dressed in wedding-band tuxedos and riding on a parade float, playing experimental (for them) jazz-funk-dub numbers from early-'90s albums such as "Check Your Head" and "Ill Communication." This segment is propulsive but formulaic, and it slows the film to a crawl despite the participation of percussionist Alfredo Ortiz and keyboardist Money Mark. The visuals get addled here with various color and solarization schemes, and the effect is a little too close to Pink Floyd night at the Lasarium.
In the film's final third, Mix Master Mike returns and the Boys pile-drive into hits from 1986's "Brass Monkey" to 2004's "An Open Letter to NYC," the latter a number that seals the group's pact with their hometown audience with a joyous, battle-scarred roar. When "Awesome" visually skips among tens of thousands of people all rapping along to the thundering "Paul Revere," it briefly unmoors a viewer's sense of self and captures the communal ecstasy of a rock concert better than any movie before it.
A pity, then, that the filmmakers keep futzing with the visuals, flipping to negative, leaching the color until everyone's a ghost, barraging the viewer with increasingly hyperactive editing-bay firestorms. (The only respite is when the screen fills with all the camera images at once, arranged in neat little rows like the compound eye of a housefly.) "Nathaniel Hornblower," a.k.a. Yauch, is the credited director, but editor Neal Usatin is the movie's secret star, and he deploys his tools with the same kitchen-sink fervor that Mix Master Mike attacks his turntables. This is film-cutting as DJing -- it's unrestrained hip-hop bricolage -- and it can only go so far before you simply cry uncle.
Not that the Garden faithful care. "Awesome" ends with the Beastie Boys dedicating the savage "Sabotage" to George W. Bush and launching into the song's crunching punk riff. Let a thousand air guitars bloom, they seem to be saying, and so they do.
.

         "Awesome; I  Shot That!," the raucous new Beastie Boys concert film, easily could have been called "Adventures in Digital Editing." Nathanial Hörnblowér (the directorial pseudonym of Beastie Adam Yauch, a.k.a. MCA) and supervising editor Neal Usatin culled 90 assaultive minutes from footage shot by 50 fans who were given video cameras and unleashed at an Oct. 9, 2004, concert at New York's Madison Square Garden.
 
 Shot from nearly every imaginable vantage point in the Garden, the film gives a pretty good idea of what it might have been like to be there. The nonstop dance party is broken up by trips to the restroom and concession stand as well as a pre-encore sprint by the Beasties from the stage to the opposite end of the arena and back. There are none of the vanity close-ups that typically mark concert films, and the audience is as much part of the performance as MCA, Ad Rock (Adam Horovitz), Mike D (Mike Diamond) and their assorted sidemen and guest artists (including Doug E. Fresh).
 


         






   Cutting to the beat of the Beasties' propulsive rap, Hörnblowér creates an experience that is simultaneously low-fi and state-of-the-art. The bouncy, sloppy, randomly zoomed fan-cam footage is caffeinated by the breakneck editing and kitchen-sink effects that give each of the two-dozen songs a distinctive style. Hörnblowér wisely breaks up the visual onslaught of grainy, hand-held shots with some obviously higher-end video footage shot by ringers.
 
 "Awesome; I  Shot That!,"
 rated R for language. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. Exclusively at the Landmark Nuart, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A. (310) 281-8223.
   

As if trying to reassure us that hip-hop and rock & roll come not from a corporation but, you know, from the people, the Beastie Boys handed out video cameras to 50 members of their audience during a 2004 show at Madison Square Garden and then proceeded to cobble together an entire concert movie from the shaky, jagged, tilted, electro-grain footage shot by those fans. It sounded like a marvelous idea, but Awesome; I F---in' Shot That!  boils down to a performance film with abysmal sound in which you rarely get to see a good, revealing close-up of the stars. Instead, the movie all but sanctifies the experience of sitting 78 rows away from your favorite band and wishing that you were close enough not to have to watch them on the monitor. The editing, and the psychedelic tinting, perfectly captures the Beasties' relentless groove, and there are any number of funny diversions (a trip to the men's room, a shot of Ben Stiller rapping along in the audience), but after a while I kept wishing that Awesome; I F---in' Shot That!  would just drop all the proletarian camera gimmickry and allow a clown prince like Adam Horowitz (a.k.a. Ad Rock), the missing link between Jerry Lewis and Eminem, to get even further in your face.

 "Awesome" is what you get after distributing 50 video cameras at a sold-out Beastie Boys concert, editing the results like a squirrel on methamphetamine, pulverizing them with psychedelic effects and releasing the whole mixed-up thing into theaters with bass so heavy it'll set off car alarms on Mars.  Aw, yeah! Is (white 20-something) Brooklyn in the house? Believe that! But the real question is: How much awesomeness can be achieved by a group of 40-something millionaires bouncing around in green tracksuits and gray hair as they bid the kids at Madison Square Garden to "Shake Your Rump"?  No longer beastly and certainly not boys, these three M.C.'s (and one D.J. — the amazing Mix Master Mike) remain on point, spitting baroque wordplay, which  still astounds, over beats of eternal tightness. From their propulsive riff on "Root Down," to a gargantuan "Paul Revere" singalong, to a heavy dose of "Sabotage" dedicated to President Bush, the Boys dip into their catalog and come up flinging hot funk all over the somewhat hip but totally hopped-up crowd.  As for the authorial conceit — assembling the movie from giddy, spastic, amateur photography captured from every part of the arena — at best it yields energetic perspectives on the show, at worst it looks like a cellphone video camera having an epileptic seizure.  "Awesome!" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The lyrics make use of four-letter words.

To film their Oct. 9, 2004, Madison Square Garden concert, longtime rap superstars the Beastie Boys handed cameras (mostly high-8) to 50 excited fans, who were told "Do whatever you want, just keep shooting." Resulting, awkwardly titled "Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!" has a good sales hook in that shot-by-youse angle. In fact, the final product is highly post-produced, with dynamic editing and much visual gimmickry filigreeing a high-octane set. One of the more exciting feature records of a single-act perf, pic should attract quick theatrical playoff and long-term home play.
After a jokey introductory text scroll and Hendrix-sampling fanfare by ever-impressive turntablist Mix Master Mike, the three Beasties -- Mike D (nee Michael Diamond), Ad Rock (Adam Horowitz) and MCA (Adam Yauch) make their entrance in matching green-and-yellow sweatsuits, launching into a roof-raising "Triple Trouble."
Right away there's considerable difference between image quality from the various cameras (some DV rather than High-8). Generally, the closer the lenser is to the stage, the better the definition. Shots of the crowd, being underlit, are grainy.
This isn't good cinematography by any formal standard, as the operators are amateurs; shots frequently bounce to the beat. But the sense of immediacy and excitement is contagious.
Yet, this is far removed from a homevideo. As masterminded by director Nathanial Hornblower (another pseudonym for Yauch) and supervising editor Neal Usatin, the rhythm of the images is as motivating as the thumping music. The B-Boys -- not to mention the crowd -- are clearly amped by this hometown gig, which ended their "Challah at Your Boy" tour.
Pic's first section is relatively straightforward, albeit sometimes dazzlingly cut, with the performers' joyful onstage posturing complemented only by some stage-rear and overhead videoscreens (which deploy hilarious found footage).
There's a second act of sorts as a five-piece live funk band -- the Beasties plus drummer Alfredo Ortiz and keyboardist Money Mark -- roll on atop a carnival-float-type ministage.
After this interlude, trio and Mix Master Mike return in T-shirts flagging game names (Scrabble, etc.). Subsequent tunes are much more elaborate in visual terms, with stretches of B&W, solarized images, superimposition, freeze-frames, split-screen, color-keying and the occasional added graphic. (There are also prankish snippets with the lowdown on camera operators as they leave the hall for beer and the bathroom.)
Added visual gimmicky starts to approach overload before the more simply presented encores.
From party anthems to politically charged songs, the group's sense of musical adventure is well represented, though those disinclined toward hip-hop are unlikely to be converted. Sound recording (pointedly not by the 50 amateurs) and mix is first-rate. Several individual numbers would make for excellent musicvideos.
 Camera (color/B&W, Hi-8- and DV-to-HD), 50 fans; supervising editor, Neal Usatin; editors, Michael Boczon, Remi Gletsos; music, Beastie Boys; music mixers, Duro, Paul Hsu; sound (Dolby Digital), Jon Weiner; visual effects, Boczon, Gletsos. Reviewed at Sundance Film Festival (Park City at Midnight), Jan. 21, 2006. Running time: 89 MIN.
 


 
 


 

At a recent Imogen Heap  show at Avalon, a guy in front of me with a Canon ELPH  was making a video clip. The auteur crept from Heap's sequined stilettos up the mic stand ivied with plastic roses, to her hands as they switched from laptop to synth. Onstage Christmas lights blurred every time he moved. I was transfixed by this Nanotron flick, and strangely excited that, for the moment, the shooter's perspective and fixations were known only to the two of us.
The Beasties' resident cineaste Adam Yauch  reportedly got a similar charge out of seeing a fan's cellphone-camera image of his band online a few years back. Right then and there, three days before a sold-out October 9, 2004, Madison Square Garden  show, he corralled a bunch of Hi-8 video cameras (plus a few of the DV kind for close associates) to distribute among the first 50 responders to a Web board call for ad hoc DPs, providing they had some basic experience and their seating fit his evenly scattered view plan. A year and 6,732 edits later, his film (credited to nom de video Nathanial Hörnblowér ) was done.
But as fresh a no-brainer as this concept was in 2004, there's something late-seeming about it now. That year in the editing room, with three teams cutting footage to a cleanly recorded beat, cost the film something in terms of the racing zeitgeist. It's not because the Beasties are past their performing primeactually they've hit upon a pretty evergreen balance of tongue-in-cheek nostalgia, elder-statesman koans, and borscht belt yuks. But in the past six months, the explosion of online video, from stalker cams to the stuff on various curatorial vlogs, has introduced scads more variables into the star-fan image-making relationship.
With Awesome 's insistence on professional soundonly a few times do we get sonically dropped into the cavernous, thumping Gardenand cuts to pristine close-ups of things like Mixmaster Mike 's admittedly sick scratch detail work, it plays like a hype victory lap rather than a boundary-smashing study of fan curiosity or pathology. One warm bit of gleeful "just-like-us"-ism catches Ben Stiller  rapping along with his heroes, but other wacky detoursa beer purchase, a trip to the can, and one crew's quest to sneak backstageare only a little bit funny compared to the steady-rolling bacchanal of reality TV transgression.
That said, the concert comes off like a blast. A monster Hendrix intro kicks off a kinetic show that features, among other things, an exuberant "Shake Your Rump," an unabashedly grown-up "Root Down," and a pulverizing "Brass Monkey" that flies in the radio beats of the week. Throughout the show, the band morphs from chartreuse tracksuited glory-dazers to tuxedoed lounge lizards grooving on a lit float to their final incarnation as fortysomething smartasses in Scrabble and mah-jongg T-shirtscalling a game a game. Shots of the crowd itself are the most compelling though, which Adam Yauch has admitted. He's now working on a project involving expanded MySpace  video capabilitiesin a push to further democratize stardom for the vox paparazzi.
