Hollywood's supermom takes on true-life tale of a vanished child in 1920s LA
"Changeling" continues Clint Eastwood's improbable late-career evolution into a women's director. Dirty Harry becomes George Cukor. But this time he goes too far. The close-ups of Angelina Jolie sobbing in "Changeling" consecrate a Hollywood saint -- Our Lady of Perpetually Glamorous Sorrow. Her face (giant red lips; big, ringed eyes; cheekbones you could use as a coat rack) belongs on stained glass as much as it does on the movie screen.
Eastwood's affection for Jolie is as intense and sincere in this film as it was for Meryl Streep in "The Bridges of Madison County" and Hilary Swank in "Million Dollar Baby." But rather than lose himself entirely in his star, Eastwood forgoes the intimacy he's so good at generating and attempts to construct a large, complex tale of crime and corruption in 1920s Los Angeles.
The director doesn't appear in "Changeling," but you can sense his care for both his star and the single mother she plays. It's there even as the film breaks apart into about four other films, all of which are as overwrought as Eastwood's "Mystic River," though without the grandiosity.
As in "Mystic River," a missing child is the narrative and moral centerpiece of "Changeling." The film baldly asserts in the opening minute that it is a true story, as opposed to something based on a true story. In March of 1928, Christine Collins (Jolie) is abruptly called in to cover a shift at the phone and telegraph company, where, in roller skates, she patrols the line operators. (Jolie's gliding across the floor and the camera sliding along the chaos at the switchboard are the most savory images in the film.)
To get to work, Christine leaves her 10-year-old son, Walter, alone. When she returns home, he's missing. A few anxious days later, the LAPD says they've found him. Christine hurries to see him arrive at the train station and knows immediately the boy isn't hers. Hilariously, the police captain, J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), insists the stress has gotten to her and the boy is, indeed, hers. Why doesn't she take the kid home, he says, for a trial run?
The scenes between Christine and this trial-run son are eerie. Something's wrong. But the boy plays along, and her tentative care-giving turns angry. She tells the press the police gave her the wrong child and implies that they did so intentionally.
The central drama isn't whether Christine is right - Donovan's clenched jaw, alone, is the picture of dastardliness. It's how she suffers because she is. Jones packs her off to a nuthouse, and the baleful "Twilight Zone" scenario goes with her.
What ensues is a Susan Hayward picture - or, if fans of the asylum business in "Girl, Interrupted" are so inclined, an Angelina Jolie picture. Christine resists overmedication and is befriended by fellow wrongly imprisoned inmate Amy Ryan (she may not be crazy but her blond frizz certainly is).
Meanwhile, the script by J. Michael Straczynski demonstrates dutiful research but no central idea, as we're pulled off to a police bust in Vancouver, and to a ranch well east of Los Angeles in Wineville, Calif., where a story of what may have happened to Walter materializes.
Eastwood overcompensates for the movie's meandering with a succession of hysterics - from men, women, and children. There's a police confession that should break your heart, except it's like something out of cheap Frank Capra. You know you're in trouble when John Malkovich, breathing fire as a radio pastor who takes up Christine's cause, is one of the movie's better-behaved participants.
Somewhat stranger is how comfortable Eastwood is framing banal speeches, including one about hope, and staging ghastly coincidences, such as when Jolie faints into the arms of the Malkovich character, who a scene before was somewhere else.
So much cutting between Wineville's arid flatland expanses and the dank cold of the mental hospital make for a parched and chilly film. There are also horror-movie images, courtroom fireworks, electroshock treatments, and a possible bogeyman. But all these parts are too disparate to culminate as a work of tragedy. It's department-store movie drama - "Mysteries? Fifth floor!"
If anything holds "Changeling" together it's the director's distrust of men. A good one is hard to find here. And boys are as bad as grown-ups. Such a contemptuous portrait makes you hunger for more of the sisterly camaraderie we get among the telephone operators and between Jolie and Ryan. But the movie backs away from too many of these occasions.
It would be easier to accept the idea that Eastwood wasn't trying to split this world according to gender if it hadn't already been so unimaginatively cast in terms of good and bad. The police and suspects are silent-movie villains. Christine epitomizes ladylike virtue - only from her heavenward perch could she tell a character to rot in hell, as she does.
Ultimately, Eastwood is stuck. It's as if he wanted to make a great, grand film about a particular Los Angeles nightmare, the way "L.A. Confidential" captured the city as a cauldron of racism and police corruption - a movie that looked simultaneously at the present and the past.
Instead, like the pastor, he takes up Christine's cause, and his righteousness ruins the picture. Before Christine is sent away, Jolie's performance is unexpectedly elegant and delicate. She fills her voice with air and gently covers her mouth, in sadness and shock, with gloved hands - she seems dim with politeness. Even out of skates, she floats through this movie.
But that grace eventually hardens into the fierceness typical of Jolie - hurt her kid, she'll hurt you. So as "Changeling" strains toward its mawkishly optimistic conclusion, the old-fashioned moviemaking that Eastwood settled into doesn't suit either him or his star. It feels like a corny joke.


When you go into a new movie directed by Clint Eastwood, you can more or less count on the pleasure of his calm classicism  the deftly angled shots, the story that unfolds with well-carpentered precision, no matter how many surprise corners it bends around. In Changeling , which is based on events that took place in Los Angeles in 1928, the stately formality of Eastwood's style is even more pronounced than usual; the whole film has a slightly remote period-piece gravity. When we first meet Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who oversees a floor of telephone operators, she looks as stylized as a doll, with white makeup, ruby lipstick, and a flapperish hat.
The torment of Christine's situation, and also the dastardliness of the cops (who turn a corrupt lie into media hype), gets rubbed in our faces. When Christine tries to fight back, egged on by the community activist Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), she is branded as crazy. Yet there's little mystery, and therefore very little drama, to any of this. Jolie, who brought a tremulous power to her portrayal of Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart   another woman distraught over a lost loved one  isn't given enough notes to play here. She's brave, despairing, defiant, and monotonous. Changeling  is a muckraker that crushes the audience under the dull weight of injustice. And when the film starts to show you what really happened to Walter, it grows even more oppressive. The trouble with Changeling  is that it plays less like reality than like a bare-bones, moralistic rehash of other, better movies, such as L.A. Confidential  or Frances . The oldfangled deliberateness of Eastwood's style has backfired this time, only adding to the sense that though you may not have heard this particular story before, you already know everything that's coming.
Changeling : See an exclusive clip:

 Toward the end of Clint Eastwood’s “Changeling,” in what is perhaps the only lighthearted scene in this rigorously somber film, Christine Collins, the heroine, is invited by some of her phone company co-workers, and then by her boss, to go out on the town and listen to the Academy Awards radio broadcast. The year is 1935, and “It Happened One Night” is Christine’s pick for best picture, but it’s hard to avoid interpreting this moment as a none-too-subtle wink directed at present-day moviegoers and Academy voters. Christine begs off — she just has too much work — and it goes without saying that on Feb. 22, Angelina Jolie, who plays her, will have to make similar excuses. She won’t be watching the Oscars with the likes of us; we’ll be watching her.  That seems to be the plan behind “Changeling,” at any rate, an ambition telegraphed a shade too blatantly in the many close-ups of Ms. Jolie’s extraordinary face, which is by turns tear-streaked, stoical, crestfallen and howling. To watch her trace Christine’s harrowing emotional passage —  a series of flights from anxiety to terror, from grief to rage, pausing occasionally at calm defiance or tremulous hope —  is to witness an undeniable tour de force of screen acting. It insists on being regarded as a great performance and may, indeed, be mistaken for one.  In the past five years Mr. Eastwood has enabled more first-rate, laurel-worthy acting than just about any other American filmmaker. There was Ken Watanabe in “Letters From Iwo Jima”; Ryan Philippe in “Flags of Our Fathers”; Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman (and Mr. Eastwood himself) in “Million Dollar Baby”; everybody in “Mystic River.” All of these actors, taking advantage of the director’s famously efficient, low-stress approach, were able to stretch out in the zone between realism and melodrama, to explore their characters’ raw nerves, tender spots and psychic calluses.  Ms. Jolie, in contrast, hurtles through “Changeling” as if it were the latest installment in the Lara Croft action franchise, sustaining a pitch of intensity that turns Christine at once into a vivid icon of suffering and something of a blur. The character, as imagined in J. Michael Straczynski’s script, is as flat as a nickel. Each side is stamped with the likeness of a familiar movie archetype — victim of circumstance on one, crusader against injustice on the other  — and Ms. Jolie composes her features and adjusts her voice accordingly when it comes time to flip.  But something essential is missing, not only from her performance but also from the film as a whole. Announcing itself at the outset as “a true story” without the usual “based on” or “inspired by” hedge,  “Changeling” is by turns fascinating and frustrating, emphatic and opaque. The truth about the case of Christine Collins is so shocking and dramatic that embellishment must have seemed pointless, but in sticking so close to the historical record, Mr. Straczynski and Mr. Eastwood have produced a distended, awkward narrative whose strongest themes are lost in the murky pomp of period detail.  In March 1928, Christine, a single mother living in Los Angeles, returns home from her shift supervising a busy switchboard to find that her young son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), is missing. The initial response of the Los Angeles Police Department is casual and condescending, which turns out to be a chilly foretaste of worse treatment to follow. After a few months, with great fanfare and press coverage, the city’s hatchet-faced police chief (Colm Feore) stages a reunion between Christine and a boy who is evidently not Walter. When Christine points this out, she is treated first as a hysterical, traumatized woman and then as a lunatic and a threat to public order. She is ignored, smeared in the papers and then locked away in a mental hospital (where she meets Amy Ryan, who is to this movie more or less what Ms. Jolie was to “Girl, Interrupted”).  When it works best, “Changeling” is a feverish and bluntly effective parable of wronged innocence and unaccountable power. One after another, figures of supposedly benevolent authority — a police captain (Jeffrey Donovan), a pediatrician (Peter Gerety), a psychiatrist (Denis O’Hare) — turn out to be cruel and self-serving, and there are scenes that recall the relentless, claustrophobic sadism of “Rosemary’s Baby.” Unlike Mia Farrow’s histrionically helpless Rosemary, however, Christine has instincts that run more toward fight than flight, and she is aided in her darkest hour by a crusading Presbyterian minister (John Malkovich) and a square-jawed, patrician lawyer (Geoff Pierson).  When the focus is on Christine’s bureaucratic nightmare, Mr. Eastwood, who composed the film’s uncharacteristically intrusive score, orchestrates a steady crescendo of dread and indignation, with gothic elements lurking in the shadows of Tom Stern’s cinematography. Some of the performances — Mr. Donovan’s snappish arrogance, Mr. O’Hare’s cat-and-mouse sadism — seem overstated to the point of caricature, but to the extent that “Changeling” is a horror movie,  such exaggeration makes sense.  But then, near the climax of Christine’s ordeal, another movie begins to take shape. The only decent man in the Los Angeles Police Department, a detective named Lester Ybarra (the excellent, blessedly understated Michael Kelly) begins to unravel the mystery of Walter’s disappearance.  And as he does, “Changeling” itself comes unraveled. I don’t want to give too much away, but the truth is that the film spoils itself.  At around the 90-minute mark, all of the considerable tension and suspense drain away, and if the film ended at that point, you might walk away shaken and perhaps stunned. But when you look at your watch, you   discover that almost an hour remains, during which the film lurches from one stagy set piece  and from one genre to another, losing its focus and coherence in the process. The pervasive overacting makes less and less sense and becomes more and more annoying. There are courtroom showdowns and grisly flashbacks, prison house confrontations and further tearful reunions, as a leering serial killer (Jason Butler Harner) supplants the Los Angeles Police Department as the main source of violent, irrational depravity.  “Changeling” is especially disappointing because its basic story might have summoned forth another of Mr. Eastwood’s dark, masterly investigations of the implacability of evil and the difficulty of justice, like “Unforgiven” or “Mystic River.” But while those themes are certainly present, the director has not done much with them or succeeded in giving them dramatic shape or cinematic life. “Oscar-worthy” might turn out to be an accurate description of this baggy, grandiose movie —  or, at least, of Ms. Jolie’s exhausting lead performance — but I’m afraid it would not be a compliment.  “Changeling” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of grisly violence and some profanity.

A thematic companion piece to "Mystic River" but more complex and far-reaching, "Changeling" impressively continues Clint Eastwood's great run of ambitious late-career pictures. Emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed, this true story-inspired drama begins small with the disappearance of a young boy, only to gradually fan out to become a comprehensive critique of the entire power structure of Los Angeles, circa 1928. Graced by a top-notch performance from Angelina Jolie, the Universal release looks poised to do some serious business upon tentatively scheduled opening late in the year.
Constructed around the infamous "Wineville Chicken Murders" in Riverside County, Calif., which achieved great notoriety at the time and, surprisingly, have never inspired a film before, the outstanding screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski (creator of TV's "Babylon 5") has deceptive simplicity and ambition to it, qualities the director honors by underplaying the melodrama and not signaling the story's eventual dimensions at the outset. Characters and sociopolitical elements are introduced with almost breathtaking deliberation, as dramatic force and artistic substance steadily mount across the long-arc running time.
With a melancholy mood set by Eastwood's typically spare guitar-and-piano score, the languid opening stretch stresses the ordinary nature of life for single mother Christine Collins (Jolie) and her 10-year-old son Walter (Gattlin Griffith), who share a modest house in a quiet neighborhood in Los Angeles. Christine has the photogenic job of telephone supervisor on roller-skates, overseeing dozens of female operators as they connect calls at a giant switchboard. Early sound films were loaded with scenes of smart-talking women handling phone lines; Eastwood takes advantage of the inspiration of skates to cover them in neat tracking shots.
One day when Christine is late getting home from work, Walter is gone. Nearly five months later, Christine is informed that her son has been found in Illinois. With all attendant hoopla for the benefit of the press and police, a reunion is arranged at the train station, but, as soon as the boy steps onto the platform, Christine knows this kid is not her son.
The police, fronted by Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), insist otherwise, waving off definitive evidence relating to physical discrepancies. Even when Walter's dentist, teacher and fellow students insist he's not the right boy, the replacement himself remains maddeningly resolute, driving the otherwise level-headed Christine to distraction.
Or at least that's the way it looks to the cops, who promptly throw her in the psycho ward for her alleged delusion. Fears that the story is now destined to veer off into "The Snake Pit" or, given Jolie's presence, "Girl, Interrupted" looney-bin cliches prove largely unfounded, despite a couple of brief electroshock scenes. Rather, this is where the picture really spreads its wings, as ramifications of this tragic but unexceptional case seep through the police department, the legal system, the medical establishment and City Hall in entirely unexpected ways.
Initially, this is due to the tireless efforts of a crusading radio evangelist, the Rev. Gustav Briegleb (an intent, focused John Malkovich), one of whose missions is to expose what he sees as the complete corruption of the LAPD under Chief James E. Davis (Colm Feore). On Christine's side from the beginning, the pastor persists in using her case to spotlight the department's malfeasance, and the character is notable as one of the few screen depictions of a righteous Christian leader of this period (the era of Aimee Semple McPherson) to be cast in an entirely favorable light.
Irrevocably setting the judicial machinery in motion is a boy in his early teens (Eddie Alderson, extraordinary) who movingly tells police about some horrific murders of kidnapped boys he's unwillingly participated in with an unhinged young man, Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner), out in the desert. What happens next -- to Capt. Jones, the police chief, the mayor and the murderers, among others -- is all part of the public record and the less than salubrious history of Los Angeles politics. 
The intercutting of two heavyweight proceedings, a murder trial and a landmark City Hall hearing, provide the story's dramatic crescendo, although even greater tension stems from what comes thereafter. In the end, "Changeling" joins the likes of "Chinatown" and "L.A. Confidential" as a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture.
A dozen filmmakers could have taken a dozen different approaches to the same material -- sensationalistic, melodramatic, expose-minded, a kid's or killer's p.o.v., and so on. Perhaps the best way to describe Eastwood's approach is that he's extremely attentive -- to the central elements of the story, to be sure (with its echoes of "A Perfect World"), but also to the fluidity between the private and the public, the arbitrariness of life and death, the distinct ways different people view the same thing, the destructive behavior of some adults toward children and the quality of life in California around the time he was born.
Despite the material's dark themes, the Los Angeles setting helps make "Changeling" one of Eastwood's most visually vivid films; cinematographer Tom Stern's mobile camera has a graceful elegance, and several panoramic CGI vistas merge smoothly with location lensing to unemphatically evoke the dustier, less congested city of 80 years ago. Production designer James J. Murakami's many sets impressively create a constant play of light and dark environments, and further period verisimilitude stems from Deborah Hopper's costumes and the occasional presence of the extinct Red Car trolleys.
As she did in "A Mighty Heart," Jolie plays a woman abruptly and agonizingly deprived of the person closest to her. But impressive as she may have been as the wife of Danny Pearl, her performance here hits home more directly due to the lack of affectation -- no accent, frizzed hair or darkened complexion, and no attempt to consciously rein in emotion. There are inevitable one-note aspects to her Christine Collins, as she must exasperatedly repeat her positions to the authorities again and again. But Jolie makes it clear Christine maintains a grip on her sanity in the face of many assaults on its stability.
Pic offers a wealth of sterling supporting turns, from significant ones down to fleeting bit parts. The pressure felt by the police to toe the party line is deftly expressed in different ways by Donovan, Feore and Michael Kelly, the latter very fine as the cop who unearths the evidence at the murder site. Harner is startlingly unpredictable as the showboating but wimpy killer, while Geoff Pierson is commandingly charismatic as the eminent lawyer who calls the city big shots to account.
Postscript noting the fates of certain characters conveniently elides the sad and/or ironic destinies awaiting some of them.

Some images aspire to be something beyond just images. They seek to become objects of veneration: icons. Angelina Jolie , as she appears in Clint Eastwood 's Changeling , is more than a mere actress or an over-publicized movie star: She's an icon of suffering. Zinedine Zidane , at least in Douglas Gordon  and Philippe Parreno 's portrait, is not simply a star athlete or even the world's greatest soccer player: He is projected as 21st-Century Man.
Jolie doesn't perform in Changeling ; she resolutely presents herself to the audience for admiration. The main attraction in Eastwood's two-fisted snake-pit weepie is the spectacle of Jolie's steely self-possessed suffering. As she lost her husband to Islamic terrorists in A Mighty Heart , Our Lady of Humanitarian Narcissism here endures another dreadful fate: losing her child to a mob of knaves, know-nothings, and psychos, even as she's persecuted by the entire state institutional apparatus of California.
Based on a forgotten tabloid saga that illuminates a particularly lurid Los Angeles guilty secret and might have appealed equally to neo-noirist James Ellroy  or cultural historian Mike Davis , Changeling  is set in a late-'20s L.A. that Eastwood has lovingly repopulated with the streetcars and Model T's of his own childhood. Jolie's Christine Collins  is a single mom and phone-company supervisor. One afternoon, her nine-year-old son vanishes from their modest bungalow; five months later, the LAPD announces with all due hoopla that the boy has been found. A reunion is staged, reporters are invited, and although dazed Christine immediately realizes that the cops are handing her another kid, she's told to take him home on a "trial basis—he has nowhere else to go."
The Collins mystery is predicated at least in part on the historical Christine's extreme suggestibility. Why did she accept this strange boy as her own? But this is subsumed in a greater mystery: Who could possibly compel Angelina Jolie to do anything she didn't want to do? Despite ample physical evidence that the child is not hers, as well as assistance from a teacher, a dentist, and a self-regarding radio preacher (John Malkovich ), Christine is browbeaten by the police, bullied by the press, and finally committed to a local bedlam seemingly filled with people whose mental illness consisted in pissing off the cops.
There's no denying Changeling 's moldy grandeur. The movie is Eastwood's version of a silent-era melodrama (and given the anachronistic psycho-babble, it might better have been one). Who doesn't want to like Changeling ? Clint Eastwood too is an icon. He succeeded John Wayne  as America's greatest cowboy and, billed as America's greatest living director, glared out from the cover of last month's Sight & Sound , a craggy object of uncritical devotion. It's been many years (and many mediocre films) since the near-successive appearance of Bird , White Hunter,  Black Heart , and Unforgiven  established Eastwood's directorial reputation. Where the existential war film Letters From Iwo Jima   attested to his viability, Changeling  signals only his ambition.
Eastwood's latest is an effort to be bracketed with Chinatown  or L.A. Confidential  in mythologizing the secret history of Los Angeles. But burdened by a convoluted script and an ensemble-proof leading lady, the director fails to illuminate a particular corrupt system. Meanwhile, this static, sluggish movie grows ever darker—even as it encompasses murder, pederasty, captivity, intimations of the Manson family, multiple courtroom scenes, and a death-row confrontation. For her part, Jolie reverts to her goth-girl origins—her mask of tragedy suggesting a skull costumed for Halloween in a cloche hat and ghoulishly kissable wax red lips.
Jolie is most convincing in her demand for recognition—and Eastwood is glad to oblige. Late in the movie, Christine confidently predicts that It Happened One Night  will be the surprise Oscar winner of 1934. Soon after, she strikes a pose identified with Stella Dallas  , the motherhood tearjerker for which Barbara Stanwyck  received her first nomination in 1937. Image trumps performance. One needn't be clairvoyant to know that somewhere in Hollywood , someone is imagining her acceptance speech.
Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait , a 90-minute piece by the video artists Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno, tracks the great French-Algerian soccer player Zinedine Zidane during the course of a single match.
The game, played between Zidane's team Real Madrid  and Villareal on April 23, 2005, is shown in its entirety. The artists pick up their subject amid a welter of pixels and isolate him on the field. Zidane is variously shown in close-up, middle shot, and long shot, with the occasional overhead, and, despite the collisions or pile-ups that sometimes occur in front of him, he's most often alone in the frame. The constant attention mystifies his skills even as it burnishes his charisma. He's set apart not only as the piece's sole subject but because he's hyper-alert, continually responding to invisible forces, raptly focused on events beyond the frame.
Although the artists subtract everything apart from Zidane's game, they don't impose a particularly strong conceptual grid on the material. The game is neither deconstructed nor defamiliarized. Meanwhile, the untranslated Spanish commentary is punctuated by a mix of groans, thuds, and crowd noises, and set to a droning New Age–y score by the Scottish band Mogwai . Zidane sweats, spits, and shifts position as the 17 cameras Gordon and Parreno had at their disposal watch him watching. Engaged in mystical contemplation, Zidane waits for his chance—to do what? (His most mysterious action is a sudden smile.) The star contributes to one scoring play. Late in the game, he gets a pat on the back from teammate David Beckham , then draws a foul and is sent to the showers. A final title, "Magic is sometimes very close to nothing at all," seems unintentionally apt.
