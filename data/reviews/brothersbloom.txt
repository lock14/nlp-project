The Brothers Bloom  is a con-artist movie in which the title siblings, played by a cocksure Mark Ruffalo and a morosely abashed Adrien Brody, stage lavishly orchestrated, months-in-the-making deceptions to bilk well-chosen marks out of their millions. Writer-director Rian Johnson works almost as hard to fake out the audience. The movie would probably have come off as more bold and bracing if it didn't follow a trilogy of Ocean 's capers, plus a lesser wave of heist flicks (The Italian Job ) and fool-the-audience contraptions (The Prestige ). Yet the novelty here, and it's a good one, is that Johnson decorates and deepens the gamesmanship with tender shoots of family feeling.
Brody plays Bloom (it's his first name), who has spent his life acting out roles in his older brother's scams and can therefore no longer separate the real from the con. It's Bloom's job to seduce a wealthy eccentric, played with a charming ditzy-sad glow by Rachel Weisz. Is he fooling her, or is he in love and conning himself? Johnson's first film, the Hammett-goes-to-high-school noir Brick , was so hard-packed with cleverness it didn't breathe. This time we expect to be played, but the twist is that we're also touched  which, the film implies, is the cinema's own form of deception.

 Rian Johnson’s globe-trotting caper comedy “The Brothers Bloom” is the movie equivalent of an elaborate juggling act whose performers keep dozens of pins wheeling in the air.  As much as you admire the stagecraft and the technical skills on display, when all is said and done, that’s all it is: a fancy, not-quite-two-hour stunt.  What you take away from this snazzy-looking fantasy about fraternal grifters embarking on a final con are its travel brochure-pretty pictures of colorful locales including Prague, St. Petersburg and Montenegro. Beyond that your response to the movie, which takes too conspicuous a delight in its own cleverness, is likely to be a shrug and a “so what?” Like those airborne pins, “The Brothers Bloom” never lands.  Mr. Johnson is certainly talented. Four years ago his debut feature, “Brick,” a film noir spoof set in a contemporary high school,  announced the arrival of a director with a prodigious knowledge of film genres and a visual flair to match. But emotionally there was no there there. Flashier and glossier, “The Brothers Bloom” is a sideways move into a related genre: the more vacuous realm of the “Ocean’s Eleven” movies and their ilk. Rather like an Indiana Jones film, “The Brothers Bloom” layers movie styles, from noir to adventure serial to screwball comedy, to conjure a timeless present.  Instead of George Clooney and Brad Pitt, the eternally naughty boys suckering marks in a life of never-ending adventure are played by Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody.  Mr. Ruffalo plays the older brother and the team’s conceptual maestro, Stephen, who plots each scam like a novel in which his younger sibling, identified only as Bloom (Mr. Brody), is cast as the protagonist.  Stephen also voices the movie’s glibly cynical philosophy that the best con is one in which everybody gets what he wants. In Stephen’s diabolically complex plots  he is the only player who knows what is real and what is fake, and the guessing games go on until the last second.  As the put-upon assistant and tag-along in these schemes, Mr. Brody projects the soulful anxiety of a man who, after 25 years of being a willing collaborator in his brother’s scams, longs to live an unscripted life. Their story is introduced with a facetiously flowery narration by Ricky Jay,  describing how the brothers were shuttled from foster home to foster home. An early con game, in which they collect $2 from their schoolmates, is shown.  After the prologue the movie leaps ahead to the present,  when Stephen prevails upon a reluctant Bloom to join in his ultimate con: the fleecing of Penelope (Rachel Weisz), a wealthy, eccentric New Jersey heiress who lives like a hermit in her castle. Penelope, who suggests an artier descendant of Ms. Weisz’s character in the first two “Mummy” movies, embraces con artistry with a fearless zest.  Once Ms. Weisz appears, “The Brothers Bloom” acquires some effervescence. Penelope’s talent for learning new skills is shown in an early montage in which she demonstrates her mastery of a circus’s worth of weird hobbies.  As the brothers lure her into a scheme that involves the theft, smuggling and resale of a priceless antiquarian book, Penelope emerges from her shell. Accompanying them on their international jaunt is a mute sidekick, Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi, from “Babel”), who is an expert in explosives.  Not long after meeting Penelope, Bloom falls in love with her, but the affair has little traction. It all builds up to an anticlimactic “is it real or is it fake?” finale in which Stephen may have met his match in treachery.  Extraneous characters who pop in and out, unnecessarily complicating matters, are Diamond Dog (Maximilian Schell), the brothers’ double-dealing mentor in con artistry, and the Curator (Robbie Coltrane), a smuggler of Belgian antiques.  With “The Brothers Bloom” Mr. Johnson joins the company of younger directors like Wes Anderson who equate smart, serious filmmaking with manipulating genres and copping attitudes. The flourishing of all that talent is exciting as far as it goes. But it is only a first step in turning movies into art.  “The Brothers Bloom” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some sexual situations and mild violence.
Writer-director Rian Johnson fashions a universe in which time is a fluid thing—where everything takes place in a familiar today and an otherworldly yesterday. When his characters don't look out of place in their derbies and dusters, they sound out of place, like high school Hammetts. Johnson's creations, inhabited thus far by soulful actors giving career-best performances, always appear as if they've materialized between eras—the yellowing then and the Technicolor now.
Johnson's movies—first Brick  in 2006, now The Brothers Bloom —are clever and soulful confabulations. The filmmaker, whose screenplays read like novels, serves up movies that could play like parodies: Brick , after all, was his gumshoe-in-tennis-shoes noir starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a slang-spouting baby Bogart on the hunt for his lady friend's killer. Could have played like a joke; it was anything but. Now comes The Brothers Bloom , a love story—two, actually—that flirts with the con-man movie clichés with which Johnson ultimately can't be bothered. Which is just as well.
In a confidence film, everyone is exactly who they say they are, even when they insist they're not who you think they are, or something—a-ha ! Johnson dispenses with that phony device up-front; he doesn't have an endgame gotcha up his sleeve and isn't interested in making a puzzle to be solved. Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom (Adrien Brody) are, from first scene to last shot, precisely who we think they are: lonely little fabulists who tell stories to find the joy that eludes them in "the real world." Cons provide an escape.
Stephen and Bloom are kids when we first meet them—young lost lads rejected by 38 sets of foster parents. Stephen's the cynic about to blossom into a full-fledged misanthrope; Bloom's the romantic who will mature into a hangdog lonely heart. Which is why Stephen's schemes all serve the same purpose: to bring joy to Bloom's empty life.
When they're boys, Stephen spins his profitable fictions to get his brother girls; as adults, he does it to land Bloom the love of his life. And she avails herself in the form of Penelope (Rachel Weisz), the Jersey heiress so wealthy and bored that she collects hobbies—among them ping-pong, rapping, playing the banjo, breakdancing, and juggling chainsaws while astride a towering unicycle. Clearly, Penelope's in need of an adventure, no matter how it arrives—by hook or by crook.
There is a con somewhere in the movie, definitely—something to do with a rare book ensconced in catacombs in Prague, involving men named the Curator (Robbie Coltrane) and Diamond Dog (Maximilian Schell, as the brothers' Fagin). As comic relief, there's Rinko Kikuchi as Bang Bang, a neon-clad Harpo Marx brandishing all manner of destructive gadgets from who-knows-where. And there are far-flung locales, where bright sunlight reflects off whitecaps and mountaintops. (The Brothers Bloom  is beautiful to look at—old-fashioned escapism, a trip around the world for the cost of a movie ticket.) But it's best not to fuss over the con's sketchy details, which only serve to distract from the real story: Bloom's attempts to find joy in life without the con.
Some will dismiss Johnson's second film as a self-conscious sophomore effort filled with literary references, as the filmmaker works to disentangle himself from constricting plot strands. But Johnson has infused The Brothers Bloom  with so much heart and beauty that one can and should easily overlook its discomfiting moments. The truth is, the film's even more profound and touching upon second viewing, once you've dispensed with the genre affectations and gotten in touch with the filmmaker's affection for his characters. Maybe that's Bloom 's best con: It steals your heart.
