An ambitious experiment that never quite jells, Stay
 is the cinematic equivalent of cr�me br�l�e, deliciously ethereal when it works but downright difficult to swallow when it doesn�t. If you�ve seen the trailers (which feel like they�ve been unspooling for months now), you know exactly as much going in as I did coming out. It�s not that Stay
, with its lofty Freudian rhetoric and hyper-stylized visuals, is a bad movie, per se, it�s just that Forster (Monster�s Ball)
, working from a script by David Benioff (25th Hour)
, allows the story to get away from him. And in a film that deals with life, death, and everything in between, that makes for a serious case of identity crisis. McGregor plays Sam Foster, a psychiatrist who shares a spectacularly overdesigned New York City loft with artist girlfriend Lila. When a painfully thin, pale new wisp of a patient named Henry Letham (Gosling) appears in his office and announces his impending suicide, Sam assumes he�s been referred by the ailing Dr. Levy (Garofalo). But a steadily mounting web of coincidences and omens soon has him looking for answers far beyond his rational training and deep within a surreal landscape where reality is as tenuous and dim as a five-watt filament. Forster�s film is about identity and what, exactly, it means to have one. It�s been marketed as a horror film, but that�s misleading; Stay
 is more along the lines of a psychological fever dream, one in which everything is symbolic and nothing is real. Or not. It�s hard to tell, as Sam blunders along trying to figure out who Henry Letham really is, what we�re meant to accept at face value (Nothing? Everything? Does the director even know?), and what is merely symptomatic of Henry and Sam�s bizarre relationship. And what�s Janeane Garofalo doing here anyway? If nothing else, Stay
 is a visual tour de force; cinematographer Roberto Schaefer (Robert Rodriguez�s Roadracers
) gives New York City the once over twice and ends up painting the burg in the gloomiest of melancholic color schemes. Over and over, Forster uses shots of reflective images in his between-scene dissolves, a technique that quickly wears thin. Thankfully, McGregor, Watts, and most of all, Gosling, immerse themselves in their roles and add a much-needed element of reality to what is in all other areas a fugue-like storyline. Gosling�s turn as the suicidal Henry is downright creepy; the actor seems to have dug so far into his character you wonder if he�ll ever be able to claw his way out. Forster should be commended for attempting something as daunting as the overreaching Stay
, which despite all of its muddled logic and porous reality � or perhaps because of it � forces you to think, a genuine rarity these days.


The second the pleasureless psychological thriller ''Stay" was over I wanted to run out and buy everything in it. Everything except the writing, the directing, the acting, and that ingrown hair of a plot twist. But Ewan McGregor's tweed suit is fetching, and his big, outlandishly handsome Manhattan apartment is something to see.
But why go all the way to the movies for this, when the studio could have sent me a catalog instead? ''Stay" is neither thrilling nor psychological, but it's chicly shot and edited and is pretty much art-directed to death. Marc Forster, whose last movie was ''Finding Neverland," is the director, but I'd say the set designers and costume folks were in charge.
The movie lethally combines artists and shrinks, the oil and water of scriptwriting 101, in a plot from the screenwriting novelist David Benioff (''The 25th Hour," ''Troy"). McGregor plays Dr. Sam Foster, a psychiatrist treating a painter and suicidal college kid named Henry (Ryan Gosling).
His regular doctor has taken a sudden vacation. No wonder. Ryan is creepy. He hears voices. He extinguishes cigarettes on his forearm. He predicts the weather. And, as he tells Sam, he's going to shoot himself in three days. Sam has to get to the bottom of why and then stop him. The boy wants his demise to emulate that of his favorite dead artist (who also died at 21). Thank goodness Sam is dating a painter (Naomi Watts) who once tried to kill herself
 and is intimately familiar with this tragically dead other painter! Otherwise, how would he know what was going on? How would we? Oh, who cares? It's all trudging toward a bogus anticlimax, anyway.
''Stay" is a slummy movie from people with too much success to slum. They're condescending to us. The filmmakers labor to imagine characters caught between sleep and waking life. But any claim to that sort of otherworldly weirdness embarrasses more than it chills. All right -- Kate Burton (blank), Janeane Garafalo (drunk), and Bob Hoskins (blind) actually are creepy, though in a way that seems purely accidental.
''Stay" traffics in allusions meant to do the filmmakers' thinking for them. We drop in on an arid university lecture about death in painting and see rehearsals for a production of ''Hamlet," in which a black actor in response to a passage exclaims, ''I don't know what it means, but I love the word 'slave!' " He's probably joking, but only in a movie that knows it's the pits would that be funny. This one thinks its Hitchcock or David Lynch or an installation at the Whitney Biennial. That's the only believably crazy thing about the picture.
Not even the film's attempts at urban authenticity pay off. This is the rare movie actually filmed in New York that often feels like it was shot in Vancouver. It's too clean. Clinical psychology is one thing, but who wants a clinical psychological thriller?
Alas, the movie is too pretentious to bother leaving us in an erotic tizzy and is not made skillfully enough to deliver the suspense we require. Forster and company don't risk lewdness or even cheap entertainment. The movie drones on about art without even approaching decent trash. Actually, ''Stay" is obsessed with bad
 art and in a way that seems reflexive but is merely wishful. It's worse than bad. It's mediocre.


         You sense you're in trouble when a movie resorts to selling itself with a description like "in the space between desire and fear, reality and illusion, life and death lies a whole other alternate world." Not that there's a better way to describe it. That "whole other" basically sums it up.
 
  With "Stay," Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball," "Finding Neverland") tries his hand at a psychological thriller and comes up with a perversely stylish tangle of loose ends unencumbered by logic. A dream about a dream in which everybody seems to have a limitless clothing budget and a degree in interior design, nothing is as it seems in David Benioff's script, but nothing is connected, either.
 


         






    Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor), a New York shrink who, for reasons that never become clear, dresses like a Yale rugby player circa 1924, wakes up from a nightmare and hurries off to meet a new patient whom he has inherited from a colleague (Janeane Garofalo). The patient is a disturbed young art student named Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling), who announces he plans to kill himself on his 21st birthday — just three days away.
 
  Henry is racked with guilt over the death of his parents, whom he claims to have killed. But he also mysteriously reappears in Sam's dreams, sitting cross-legged on the Brooklyn Bridge as his car burns behind him; and appears to be able to foretell the future. (Is this what's meant by "fashion-forward?") Later, he unnervingly identifies Sam's friend, Dr. Leon Patterson (Bob Hoskins), as his dead father.
 
  Sam's girlfriend Lila (Naomi Watts), meanwhile, keeps angling to meet Henry. A painter and former patient of Sam's, she wants to talk to him, suicidal depressive to suicidal depressive. "Tell him there's too much beauty to quit," she tells Sam, when he refuses.
 
  She's right about that. If there's one thing to be gleaned from "Stay," it's that the netherworld between life and death and illusion and reality is exactly like one giant issue of Wallpaper. As the streets become populated with identically dressed twins and triplets, minor moments replay for no apparent reason, and reality and fantasy merge in soft-serve spirals, it becomes clear that Sam and Henry's identities are starting to merge.
 
  Sam clears his schedule to race around a dream-like, hyper-stylized New York trying to find out why his Lila is calling him Henry and why Henry's dead mother is trying to feed him leftovers from her empty fridge. But the why and how of it never come together in any sort of satisfactory way.
 
  It's a shame, really, because few things are more enjoyable than a well-put together psychological puzzle whose pieces actually fit. But even though McGregor and Watts are nice to look at, and obligingly submit to more costume changes than the situation requires. (McGregor's pants, which perplexingly hover well above his ankles throughout the movie, add to the general air of mystery), the movie hinges on a cheat of an ending, and not a very original one, either.
 
  The final twist does more to unravel what's come before than to tie it all together, making what's come before feel like a cosmopolitan goose chase.

I stuck with Stay  as long as I could. I understood that Ewan McGregor plays a Manhattan psychiatrist named Sam, Naomi Watts plays Sam's fragile artist girlfriend, Lila (she's got the wrist scars of a would-be suicide), and Ryan Gosling is Henry, a rabidly depressed college student under Sam's care who's also an artist, also suicidal, and also...well, maybe he's also Sam. Or an aspect of Sam. Or else Sam is an aspect of Henry. Maybe Henry is an aspect of Lila. Maybe what we think is reality is all an illusion. Maybe illusion is actually reality. Maybe we're all jacked into the Matrix.
Eventually I gave up on meaning and began instead to study the profuse imagery  and also the flat characters and anchorless performances  as if the whole were an art installation from Swiss-German director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland ) and New York screenwriter David Benioff (Troy ). See how Sam wears high-water pants; notice the groupings of twins and triplets in the background. Here is the Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan skyscapes, and Bob Hoskins as a blind man with his eyes rolled up in his head. Are we not all blind pedestrians on the Brooklyn Bridge? No? Then I can't stay.


"I don't know what's real anymore," admits Ewan McGregor's psychiatrist character toward the end of "Stay," and if he doesn't know what's going on, audiences sure aren't going to be able to figure it out
. An ultra-arty "The Sixth Sense" that deliberately inhibits comprehension of the story until the very end -- and arguably continues to inhibit it even then -- pic features certifiably talented people on both sides of the camera collaborating on a project that probably shouldn't have been undertaken in the first place. Inscrutable Fox release serves as one more piece of evidence showing why many viewers feel decreased motivation to run out to see films in theaters.
In theory, there are plenty of people who would happily ante up to see McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling in a film by the director of "Monster's Ball" and "Finding Neverland" and the writer of "The 25th Hour" and "Troy." But most will likely sniff this one out for what it is, a would-be mystery thriller with pretensions to being something more that actually delivers a good deal less.
Story's mechanics concern the efforts of McGregor's shrink Sam Foster to prevent distraught student Henry Letham (Gosling) from committing suicide on the upcoming Saturday. Sam's efforts to locate his new patient and those who know him propel the picture all over a New York City that, due to the cold, anonymous location choices, has been drained of its familiarity and humanity.
But director Marc Forster and writer David Benioff are more interested in investigating an indefinable point in time and space where Sam and Henry's personalities merge, and they go to extraordinarily elaborate lengths trying to explore this convergence without making the viewer feel for a moment that this is interesting or meaningful, let alone plausible.
Indulging in minor-key surrealism, repetitive and circular motifs, space-warping transitions, doubling effects and good old hallucinations that recall Nicolas Roeg in his heyday, "Stay" is meant to inspire deep thoughts and the pondering of imponderables. This proves difficult to do, however, when one remains fixated on why Sam, otherwise nattily attired in Thom Brown designer suits, insists upon wearing no socks.
Whether or not Forster and Benioff could, if pressed, explain every mystifying element of their construct is beside the point, since one simply does not become sufficiently intrigued by the characters or situation to be bothered about the answers. Who really died in the startling Brooklyn Bridge car crash that opens the picture? Why does Henry get under Sam's skin so profoundly? Is the blind psychiatrist played by Bob Hoskins Sam's doctor or Henry's late father? Did the woman (Kate Burton) who's supposed to be Henry's mother actually die several months earlier, as a cop insists? Does anyone actually know what's real here, or care?
Missing socks aside, the design elements are absorbing in and of themselves and would have provided excellent ominous support to a story offering more substance to grab onto. While the capable McGregor and Gosling deliver nothing new from what they've shown before, Watts is radiant and, in a small role, Elizabeth Reaser registers as an intriguing newcomer.

In Marc Forster 's humorless thriller, going insane is an exciting, luxurious affair. People suffer stylishly; depressives are angry and dirty; they make art, carry guns, and live in magnificent houses. Henry Lethem  (Ryan Gosling ), a Columbia student who does gigantic, abstract paintings that won't make him famous, decides to commit suicide in three dayshis "great work of art." His therapist (Ewan McGregor ), who wears shockingly short pants but still has a pretty girlfriend (Naomi Watts ), tries to help by tracking down anyone the boy knows. Sam's a dream of a shrink, delightfully devoted and so in touch with his patients' problems that he forgets about everything else. The inevitable suicide at the center of Gus Van Sant 's Last Day s is lulling and subtlethe artist-hero just slips away. Here, Forster brings a world-shaking bombast to the event: To a pulsing, string-heavy symphony, all of New York seems on the verge of collapse. Buildings change locations and the streets gleam with unearthly amounts of rain. Henry's delusions are dramatized in the form of unabashedly vague and circular plot twists. A boy with a silver balloon keeps asking, "Mama, is that man going to die?" But Henry's plan for suicide is full of hope. It feels less like a dead end than a creative decision, a chance for some rock 'n' roll and a "mind-bending" flourish of special effects.
