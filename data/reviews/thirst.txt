Did you hear the one about the Korean priest who becomes a vampire? All he wants is to do good for humanity, so he volunteers for an experimental vaccine to treat a deadly  blood disease. Next thing you know, he's one of the undead, revered by the populace for the  apparent miracle of his healing  and wrestling with bloody appetites inflamed by proximity to a beautiful, unhappy young woman who's the wife of his childhood friend. This devout man's idea of a good drink is one of the transfusion bags hanging in the hospital where he prays for the souls of the wretched. Off duty, he drains their precious bodily fluids.
There's more, much more in Thirst , a gaudy, daring, operatic, and bloody funny provocation of a melodrama from Park Chan-wook. The stylistically elegant bad boy of Korean cinema (auteur of the revenge trio Oldboy , Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance , and Lady Vengeance ) makes clever leaps between longings of the spirit and desires of the flesh, as well  as between the traditions and strictures of old Korean culture and the lures and confusions of the new. As the thirsty priest, Song Kang-ho, a regular Park repertory player and Korea's leading movie star, looks great whether he's covered with pustules or naked and clear-skinned, lusting for flesh. And in the role of a miserable wife dominated by her bossy mother-in-law, former beauty-pageant winner Kim Ok-vin bursts into demented, aroused radiance once bitten by the thirsty priest. As ever, the filmmaking in Thirst  is gorgeous, every shot a keeper, even as blood flows in rivers and hell beckons. A–


 Sang-hyun, the hero of Park Chan-wook’s “Thirst,” is many different things: a Roman Catholic priest; a selfless volunteer in a dangerous medical experiment; a reluctant faith healer with a cult following; a vampire. And “Thirst” itself, which won the Jury Prize this year at the  Cannes Film Festival, where Mr. Park has long been a favorite, is equally protean. It is a bloodstained horror movie, a dark comedy, a noirish psychodrama of crime and punishment, a melodrama of mad love, a freehanded literary adaptation (of Émile Zola’s “Thérèse Raquin”) and, of course, a vampire movie.  Unfortunately, it is also less than the sum of its parts — overly long, lacking in narrative momentum and too often choosing sensation over coherence. Mr. Park has an undeniable knack for choreographing bloody, sensual set pieces. While nothing in “Thirst” is quite as shocking or perverse as some of the best-known moments in his “Old Boy” or “Lady Vengeance” — by which I mean that no children are murdered and no live cephalopods swallowed whole — there are elegantly presented servings of sex and gore. Mr. Park and his cast offer moments of creepy, winking humor and also of intense emotion, a combination that is a hallmark of this director’s oeuvre.  The most vividly rendered feeling, suggested by the film’s title, is desire: for human blood, for sexual release and also for something purer and more soothing. Sang-hyun,  despite his vampirism (which follows his voluntary infection with a disfiguring tropical virus), clings to a sense of righteousness and decency. Instead of  maiming or killing innocent people, he discreetly slurps from the intravenous tube of an overweight patient in a hospital coma ward. Later on, when his appetite (and that of his lover) grows,  Sang-hyun proposes turning to assisted suicide rather than outright murder. Even his sexual hunger is shadowed by guilt and colored by tenderness as much as lust.  It helps that  Sang-hyun is played by Song Kang-ho, one of South Korea’s most inventive and reliably sympathetic actors. More somber and stiffer than he was in Bong Joon-ho’s “Host,”  one of the best monster-horror movies of recent years, Mr. Song broods and suffers persuasively. He also slyly signals some of the more preposterous aspects of his character. This poor priest, longing to help humanity, finds himself covered in blisters and under quarantine and then subject to sensory freakouts that are scant compensation for his superhuman powers.  Sensory freakouts are one of Mr. Park’s specialties. His colors — red in particular — are always bright and menacing, and his sound design foregrounds wet, intimate, icky noises. He is a virtuoso not so much of sex and violence as of the feverish states that incite such frenzies of carnality. In Sang-hyun’s case, involuntary bloodlust is redoubled by a more familiar kind when he finds himself infatuated with a young woman,  Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin). The adoptive stepsister, and now the wife, of a sickly childhood friend of  Sang-hyun’s, Tae-ju lives with her husband (Shin Ha-kyun) and mother-in-law (Kim Hae-sook) in a state of Cinderella-like servitude. She is bored, bossed around and, she leads Sang-hyun to believe, grievously abused.  What develops between  Sang-hyun and Tae-ju should be, and sometimes is, a nasty little drama of mayhem,  revenge and remorse. Ms. Kim, at first the very image of girlish frailty, evolves from ingénue to femme fatale to demon, and exerts herself bravely in an effort to embody the film’s anxious and confused ideas about female sexuality.  These will be familiar to connoisseurs of recent vampire-obsessed popular culture, from “Twilight” to “True Blood.”  Tae-ju, who is initiated by Sang-hyun  into his sanguinary tribe, is at once a helpless victim and a wanton vixen. The difference between the lovers is indicative of the film’s queasy, quasi-misogynist ideas about eros and ethics. Sang-hyun  is morally stricken by his cravings, and when he can’t fight them he at least tries to bargain with their implacable demands. Tae-ju, once she overcomes her initial shyness, recognizes no such scruples or boundaries. She is a fantasy figure designed to scare and titillate boys who imagine that a sexually awakened woman is an uncontrollably destructive force.  Like other conceits  in the film, this fantasy has the potential to be more interesting than it is. Mr. Park seems almost to be making up  the story  as he goes along, gesturing toward themes that are never, so to speak, fleshed out. Soaked in blood though it is, “Thirst” leaves some essential cravings unsatisfied.  “Thirst” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity, blood and gore.

Emile Zola meets New Age vampirism in South Korean helmer Park Chan-wook's "Thirst," an overlong stygian comedy that badly needs a transfusion of genuine inspiration. Inspired by and following key plot elements in Zola's 19th-century novel of murder and adultery, "Therese Raquin," the two-hour-plus pic is slow to warm up and largely goes around in circles thereafter, with repetitive (and often plain goofy) jokes about hemoglobin lust and bone-crunching, sanguinary violence. Some major surgery could help its specialized offshore potential, but this is startlingly unnuanced work from the director of such classy fare as "Oldboy" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."
Film opened strongly April 30 in South Korea, and has taken 1.75 million admissions in its first two frames. But in its second week, it was knocked out of the top spot by action-comedy "My Girlfriend Is an Agent."
Setup is strong, as Sang-hyeon (Song Kang-ho), a well-liked priest in a small town who works at the local hospital, contracts and dies from the deadly Emmanuel virus after volunteering in a project to discover a vaccine. After being brought back to life by a blood transfusion, he gradually realizes he's been turned into a vampire, which gives him an extremely healthy sexual appetite but also requires regular doses of blood to keep his skin free of small boils.
Choice bits of Zola's novel start to appear as Sang-hyeon starts an affair with Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin), the wife of his childhood friend, Kang-woo (Shin Ha-gyun). Dowdy, put-upon Tae-ju, who spends her time looking after the sickly Kang-woo and being bullied by his doting mom, Mrs. Ra (as in "Raquin"; Kim Hae-suk), blooms into a voracious, free-spirited lover with Sang-hyeon. Soon they're a pair in more ways than one, as their thirst for sex, thrills and red corpuscles turns them into mass murderers.
Project has been in Park's mind for a decade -- always with thesp Song in mind -- but at some stage, what began as a typically wry, genre-bending take on sin and redemption seems to have shed most of its subtext. Though Sang-hyeon finds himself an object of worship as he develops special powers of strength and flight, what could have been a wonderfully transgressive spin on religion and its flipside devolves, especially in its second half, into blood-spattered, low-key farce revolving around a single, overworked idea.
Early grossout scenes lose their shock value with repetition, as the script amps up the semi-cartoonish violence in the third act. Tae-ju begins to relish the blood-sucking in a way that troubles even Sang-hyeon. But the movie never comes close to tapping the raw, gnawing need of vampirism that fueled pics such as Abel Ferrara's "The Addiction" or Tony Scott's "The Hunger."
Song, perhaps South Korea's most recognizable actor and a Park regular ("JSA," "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"), is never less than solid as the priest-turned-vampire but lacks some of the sheer physical presence he usually brings to the screen.
The major surprise is 22-year-old actress-model Kim Ok-vin (usually known, more correctly, as Kim Ok-bin), whose doll-like features made her the perfect underdog in the campy high school musical "Dasepo Naughty Girls." Here, she puts to rest any doubts about her ability to take on a challenging role, throwing herself into topless sex scenes and vampiric munching with a lusty, bad-girl abandon.
As usual in Park's movies, design is paramount, with Jeong Jeong-hun's DV-originated lensing savoring the musty Lynchian colors of Ryu Seong-hye's production design. Visual effects, especially in the flying scenes, are just OK by Korean standards.

Finally, there's a vampire movie worthy of the title The Hunger —even if it arrives under the more potable name Thirst . Carnal appetite, not a parched palate, is the accelerant that fuels this perverse, prankish, and merrily anti-clerical exercise in bloodletting from Park Chan-wook , the South Korean director whose films function like the moral-retribution mechanisms in the Saw  movies—traps with no way out but a permanently scarring exit.
Vampirism would seem an unusually . . . genteel  diversion for Park, best known for the "Vengeance Trilogy," which reached its apex with the Jacobean cruelties of 2003's devious Oldboy . Starting with 2002's Byzantine kidnapping-gone-awry saga Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance , the former film critic and one-time philosophy student has made his subject (and method) the self-destroying machinery of violence. Once somebody throws a switch, the unstoppable gears of his plots mangle the guiltless and the guilty alike.
But the vampire genre proves to be a squishy wet dream for a filmmaker who regularly works in a palette of gougings, impalings, and blunt-force traumas, with the odd electrocution or tongue-snipping as karmic relief. In Thirst , which shared this year's Jury Prize at Cannes , Park zeroes in on the moral and sexual squeamishness underlying the cult of Twilight —wannabe Lestats whose idea of eternal night is a Hot Topic  midnight sale.
Thirst 's hero, the priest, Sang-hyeon (played by South Korean superstar Song Kang-ho , who can do active and passive simultaneously), despairs of his powerlessness in a ravaged world. Seeking a chance to make a difference, the doubt-plagued do-gooder offers himself to a vaccine trial against a deadly African virus. As warned, his skin ruptures and pustulates, and God evidently answers his prayer to "pull out my nails, so that I may grasp nothing"—leaving the bandaged, mummified priest to wither and die.
This somber, straight-faced opening is mostly a feint. Park tips his hand only in a gruesome sight gag—the leprous priest playing his recorder, from which pours not music but blood. Then, a miracle: Sang-hyeon rebounds from death, the zits recede, and a cult of worshippers begin brandishing a gauze-wrapped crucifix and begging for his healing powers. A relapse later, the priest wakes with a sickening realization: The vim and vigor that his followers take for divine light has more to do with a newfound aversion to sunlight—and pesky new cravings for blood and other unnamable desires.
It's at this point that Park notches up the melodrama from clinical cool to hothouse fever, insinuating his infected man of God into the seething household of idiot-manchild buddy Kang-woo (Shin Ha-kyun), his martinet mom, Lady Ra (Kim Hae-sook), and Kang-woo's dissatisfied wife, Tae-joo (Kim Ok-vin, in a star-making show of erotic fireworks). Now ravenous for flesh as well as blood, with a hard-on he can't flagellate away, the priest locks eyes with Tae-joo. As it turns out, she's less than repulsed by his secret: "Vampires are cuter than I thought."
A vampire priest? The gift of eternal life as an STD? Holy Luis Buñuel ! From here on, as the lovers scheme about what to do with Tae-joo's inconvenient spouse, the plotting borrows mightily from Émile Zola 's proto-noir Thérèse Raquin  —albeit with Zola's naturalism embellished by superhuman powers, CGI rooftop leaps, and color-coordinated bloodshed. But it plays as malicious mischief, diverting but curiously weightless. In Oldboy , the characters' tragic dimensions gave Park's trip-wired torments a kind of Shakespearean horror, the blow of wounds struck to the soul. Thirst  settles for a macabre jollity as the unlikable characters affix nastily ironic fates to each other. Park's postman doesn't ring twice—he just piles a lot of bloody packages on the doorstep.
But Park's voluptuous style fits a genre that is all appetite—or should be. With Twilight , the vampire movie for vegetarians, as only the most obvious example, mainstream movies on the subject now seem freaked out by the messiness of intercourse: Throat-sucking is OK, but God forbid any other parts see action. The violence in Thirst  is less shocking than the slurpy physicality of the sex scenes, oral ravishings that extend to toes and armpits. As the priest's senses unfurl, the whole world seems made of meat—the obscene adipose rippling of Kang-woo's waterbed is a particularly grotesque manifestation of erotic hunger.
Less startling, but equally welcome, is Park's refusal to duck the moral implications typically glossed over by vampire groupies. The fatalism inherent in vampire movies—that once bitten, you have no choice but to feed—suits Park's fascination with protagonists who have basically had free will stolen from them. The most intriguing aspect of Thirst  is the steady erosion of Sang-hyeon's ethics, slackened from "do not" to "do not kill" to "do not kill the undeserving" by the lure of those O+ cocktails.
