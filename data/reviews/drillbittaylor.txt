Much to my dismay, this is not an unauthorized sequel to Abel Ferrara's 1979 East Village art-world freak-out, Driller Killer
. This is instead a dispiritingly mediocre tweener comedy from some very talented people who appear to be experiencing a delayed sophomore slump. With Judd Apatow's (Knocked Up
) name hovering comedy-god-like over the titles and Seth Rogen (Superbad
) credited as co-writer � not to mention the dependably dopey Owen Wilson as the titular borer du jour � you'd expect the laffs to positively gush forth like blue jokes �n� booze issuing from the maw of Buddy Hackett. Nuh-uh. Drillbit Taylor
 is a strange hybrid of Apatow's �ber-cool TV series Freaks and Geeks
 and 1980s My Bodyguard
, a cool albeit little-seen film scripted by Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things
 scribe Alan Ormsby. Drillbit Taylor
 is such an obvious rehashing of old ideas and laugh lines that it borders on the insulting. Hartley, Gentile, and Dorfman play Wade, Ryan ("T-Dawg" to his friends), and Emmit, a trio of freshman high schoolers who hire Wilson's ostensibly ex-Army maniac to protect them from local bully Filkins (Frost). These school misfits are the doppelg�ngers of Freaks and Geeks
 lead characters Sam, Neal, and Bill, right down to their skinny/fat/hypergeek physiognomies, and Frost's bully boy is patterned after every school-yard thug ever created, up to and including Matt Dillon's turn in My Bodyguard
. Apatow and Rogen should note for future reference that stealing from the best doesn't count for squat if you're the best in the first place, although Wilson does get some juicy throwaway lines, as when he asks his young charges to look deep into his thousand-yard-staring eyes and then quotes blade-running Rutger Hauer: "I've seen things you wouldn't believe � attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate." Coming from beneath Wilson's crooked schnoz and endless-summer hairstyle, it's one joke in a million, but it's also virtually the only one that works.


"Drillbit Taylor" sounds like a rediscovered blaxploitation movie or a name near the top of the NFL draft. It's just Owen Wilson's second comedy since it was reported last year that he tried to end his life. Now we have to look at that face and assume we can see sadness between the laugh lines. His stoned sunniness has lost its Teflon coating.
Wilson plays the title character, an Army deserter now homeless in Santa Monica. When three high-school freshmen (Nate Hartley, Troy Gentile, and David Dorfman), tired of being pushed around, place an ad looking for a bodyguard, Drillbit shows up, sensing an opportunity to grift, bilk, and purloin whenever he can. The kids take a cockeyed liking to his alleged military expertise and his bogus training methods. But as the bullying persists, they come to suspect he's a fraud. By that point the movie has already given in to its disturbing sadistic side.
Co-written by the actor Seth Rogen, this movie is like the last movie he co-wrote, "Superbad," about three nerds humiliated en route to a party. (Judd Apatow produced both.) This time, it's "Superbad" for ninth graders instead of seniors - "Superbaddish," I suppose.
Hartley and Gentile are to this movie what Michael Cera and Jonah Hill were to "Superbad": the skinny guy and his fat best friend. Dorfman is the sidekick figure who is somehow stranger than the other two. (He was Naomi Watts's creepy son in "The Ring" movies.) Gentile is brusque and sounds like he's from Brooklyn. Hartley has Joan Cusack's face and one of her haircuts. He's very good.
But isn't it too soon for retreads from Rogen and Apatow? The producer even throws in Leslie Mann, his wife, to do a version of the bitterly desperate woman routine she played to perfection in "Knocked Up." (She falls for Wilson here.) "Drillbit Taylor" isn't as obnoxious as "Superbad" (parts of it feel like Paul Mazursky's farce "Down and Out in Beverly Hills"), but it's just as overwrought an adolescent nightmare.
For a little while the bullying is pretty funny. Director Steven Brill oversees an ecstatic montage of soda being poured over laptops and kids being forced to urinate on each other. But once Gentile is strapped to a chair and shoved hard into a wall, it's apparent that we're well beyond wedgies. We're in horror-movie territory. The boys run for their lives, even after Drillbit shows up. And the bullies - played too convincingly by Alex Frost and Josh Peck - don't take him seriously, either.
The movie imagines this nice, safe, upper-middle-class school as the kind of urban war zone Michelle Pfeiffer and Hilary Swank have been sent to in movies past. The principal (Stephen Root) doesn't appear interested in stopping the violence, either. Any other school would put an end to this kind of ritual humiliation, if only to keep a Columbine-style retaliation off its hands. (Incidentally, Frost played one of the killers in Gus Van Sant's high-school-massacre movie, "Elephant." He does all the nasty acting here he couldn't in that film.)
The makers of "Drillbit Taylor" aren't so much interested in a movie about the tyranny of bullies as they are completely turned on by the violence they inflict. Brill already has a dim pro-wrestling comedy under his belt (2000's "Ready to Rumble") and in "Drillbit" the kicks to crotches and fists to faces look like they really hurt. You could put the movie on a double-bill with Michael Haneke's current home-invasion torture show, "Funny Games," and its finale is identical to the grisly face-off at the end of "Never Back Down," last week's ode to boys aroused by beating the tar out of each other for an enthusiastic audience. What's going on with America's young dudes?
Of course, this is not to say the cruelty in "Drillbit Taylor" lacks ethical value. The sight of poor Dorfman, screeching and begging not to be stuffed into a locker, really brought home why I buy cage-free chickens.


In Drillbit Taylor , a failing-grade comedy about the wishful triumph of high school dorks over high school bullies, the star victims  a fat, mouthy clown; a skinny, precocious geek; and a shrimpy, flouncy nerd  decide to hire some protection from their two most persistent tormentors. The budget-conscious clients settle on Drillbit (Owen Wilson  ) as a bodyguard. They don't know, as the audience does, that the nicknamed scammer is actually a homeless Army deserter who squats near the Santa Monica shoreline, panhandles on the freeway off-ramp, and hangs with a like-minded fraternity of cynical bums in the SoCal sunshine. (The sunshine explains Drillbit's most excellent blond hair and even tan.) Nevertheless, the adult shirker goes on to inspire self-confidence in his charges, the kids bring about redemption for their unreliable guardian, and there's even time for a little bonus smoochiness between Drillbit and a smitten fellow educator (Leslie Mann) at the boys' high school because, did I forget to mention, at one point Drillbit passes himself off as a substitute teacher, unchallenged by the principal (Stephen Root), who, in the great comedy tradition of school principals, is a tool.
It's hardly worth going on at much length about the movie, a disordered, dispirited shuffling of flailing-to-be-funny and trying-to-be-empathetic scenes during which (in no particular order), the fat one (Troy Gentile from Nacho Libre ) raps, the skinny one (newcomer Nate Hartley) crushes on a cute Asian-American classmate, and the shrimpy one (David Dorfman from The Ring ) all but shrieks to anyone with an ear for such hints that he has a future as a chorus boy in Cats . Also, Drillbit's down-and-out cohorts loot the skinny kid's nice house, the bullies (Alex Frost from Elephant  and Josh Peck from Mean Creek ) attack their prey with weirdly excessive violence, and the other adults are clueless about what's up with the young people. There's no pleasure to be had in these vignettes. Come to think of it, the whole enterprise is depressing, not least because Wilson looks like he's working so unhappily. (Perhaps I'm reading in too much because this was the time of the actor's highly publicized emotional troubles.)
It is worth going on a bit, though, about the particular clash of sensibilities that, I think, doomed Drillbit Taylor  to detention. ''Edmond Dantes'' came up with the original story idea a good 20 years ago; Dantes is the occasional screenwriting name used by '80s teen-comedy czar John Hughes for such lesser oeuvres as Beethoven  and Maid in Manhattan . And there is, indeed, something out-of-date and almost 20th-century nostalgic in this conception of high school oppressors and the high school oppressed, all of them essentially home alone. (The fat kid's got a blowsy, divorced mother; the skinny kid endures a macabre family setup in which he's treated like a visiting freak; and the shrimpy kid appears to have been born in a trunk backstage at a dinner theater.)
The story was nurtured, though, by producer Judd Apatow. And through his screenwriters (and fellow Undeclared  teammates) Kristofor Brown and Seth Rogen  , the 21st-century comedy czar has attempted to force-graft a new-Apatow-school cultural with-it-ness onto old-Hughes-school characters. When the fat kid and the skinny kid talk on the phone on the night before their first day at school, they do so with the hyperverbal cadences (and where-are-the-hot-chicks sexual insecurities) of the Superbad  boys. Only these naïfs aren't even somewhatbads; they're old-fashioned boys who like magic tricks and Cap'n Crunch cereal, spouting references to 8 Mile  and Blade Runner  that belong to the writers' world, not the characters'.
And then there's the star, told to play a man with sadness in his life and no roof over his head. For laughs. In the division between actors who disappear into character and those who superimpose their persona on whatever character they're playing, Wilson is surely in the latter category, loved for the slightly renegade, slightly beach-bunny lightness with which he drawls his way out of any screwups. There's little use for those assets in a comedy about being picked on by bullies  a kid-size problem as identifiably real as the homeless guy's backstory is frankly fake. Overwritten and underbuilt by Hughes and Apatow, the character of Drillbit Taylor haunts the movie that carries his name like a bogeyman, not a bodyguard.

 At the moment it seems as if no major Hollywood studio will release a comedy without Judd Apatow’s name somewhere on the label. This is perhaps overdue vindication for a man who once languished making brilliant television shows that too few people wanted to watch, but it also carries risks of backlash and brand dilution.  As an admirer, mostly, of Mr. Apatow’s oeuvre, I was inclined to believe that “Drillbit Taylor” was a cheap knockoff, that the producer credit Mr. Apatow receives at the beginning was akin to the Rolex insignia on the watch I bought for  $20 on Canal Street a while back. But it makes more sense to think of this dumb little picture, with Mr. Apatow’s wife, Leslie Mann, in a supporting role, and Seth Rogen, one of his alter egos, sharing credit for story and screenplay, as part of the Apatow discount line. “You get what you pay for,” the tag line on the advertisement says. I saw it free, and I still feel cheated.  The premise is a mélange of familiar and somewhat more esoteric elements: the television sitcom “Freaks and Geeks,” of which Mr. Apatow was an executive producer; the 1980 high school drama “My Bodyguard”; Jean Renoir’s “Boudu Saved From Drowning” (or at least Paul Mazursky’s remake, “Down and Out in Beverly Hills”). Worthy influences all. But “Drillbit Taylor” is so ploddingly directed (by Steven Brill) and lazily written that it adds up to little more than a diffuse collection of second-hand gags and jokes, few of them funny.  Three nerdy high school freshmen —  a fat one (Troy Gentile), a tall one with glasses (Nate Hartley) and a shrimpy one with braces (David Dorfman) —  find their pathetic efforts at coolness met with abuse from a pair of bullies. These are not just run-of-the-mill jocks but full-fledged sociopaths, in particular the one called Filkins (Alex Frost). To fight back the boys enlist the help of the title character (Owen Wilson), a good-natured homeless man who claims to be veteran of the  Army Special Forces.  Various entirely predictable, rarely amusing things happen, including a lot of punches  to the face and groin. The only reliably funny thing in the movie is Mr. Wilson’s zoned-out, improvisational riffing, but his oddball comic intensity is shamelessly exploited rather than given material on which to feed. This is too often the way lazy filmmakers deal with gifted screen comedians. Point the camera at Mr. Wilson (or Will Ferrell or Ben Stiller or Jim Carrey), write a check and figure that the shtick will carry a movie at least as far as a decent opening-weekend gross. That’s a waste of talent, and “Drillbit Taylor” is a waste of time.  “Drillbit Taylor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some puerile sex jokes and drug references.

A junior-league "Superbad" with an aftertaste of "The Pacifier," "Drillbit Taylor" is a just passable pubescent comedy with a modest laugh count by Apatow factory standards. Tale of three dorky high school freshmen who hire a would-be pro bodyguard to protect them from campus bullies brandishes enough rude and pranky adolescent humor to connect with the target audience, indicating good if not stellar spring-break B.O. in relatively quick playoff.
Setup promises a sort of modern Three Stooges takeoff that, unfortunately, is only haphazardly delivered. Beleaguered trio of hopeless physical specimens consists of tubby Ryan (Troy Gentile, Jack Black's younger self in both "Nacho Libre" and "Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny"), who fancies himself the world's greatest white rapper; brainy string bean Wade (Nate Hartley); and shrimpy Emmit (David Dorfman, "The Ring"), who gloms onto the two buddies when Wade misguidedly intervenes with the thug who stuffs Emmit into a locker on the first day of school.
The ringleader of torment is Filkins (Alex Frost, "Elephant"), a boy with a mean glint in his eye and evident free rein to wreak havoc at the West Los Angeles school, where the principal is in Filkins' pocket and hall monitors must be a thing of the past. 
This not being a superhero movie in which the beset weaklings suddenly acquire extraordinary powers, the threesome conducts bodyguard interviews at the local Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. As the boys quickly learn, in L.A., security personnel are accustomed to deep-pocket employers, so the only guy they can afford is the oddly monikered Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a homeless Army discharge (for purported "unauthorized heroism") who sees these rich kids as his passport to quick coin and a desired move to Canada.
Drillbit lives on the bluff above Pacific Coast Highway and showers nude on the beach each morning for the delectation of passing motorists (the PG-13 rating precludes the male full frontals that have quickly become an Apatow signature). He's glib enough to impress the boys with his self-defense stratagems for a while, even if he doesn't really solve their problems.
As it unfolds, the script by Kristofor Brown and Seth Rogen (both writers on Apatow's short-lived comedy series "Undeclared") becomes increasingly conventional. Since formula dictates that the adult should end up learning more from the kids than vice versa, Drillbit is forced to reveal the pitiful truth about his life to the boys, as well as to the pert blonde teacher (Leslie Mann) who's taken a major shine to him.
School and adolescent sexuality provide inexhaustible sources of comic situations, but the scenarists remain content to take mostly easy shots. Comparison with "Superbad" stems from how the boys seem to get in well over their heads with older, unsavory characters. Perhaps because the kids are younger here, however, director Steven Brill (whose directorial debut, "Heavyweights," was co-written by Apatow) cannot push the premise to the same extremes, and initial concentration on them is eventually exchanged for more screen time with the title character, enacted by Wilson with his standard brand of off-center affability.
As a result, characterizations of the weesome threesome never goes beyond the one-dimensionally obvious; from the outset, the assertive Ryan is clearly destined to become Jonah Hill, Wade has a character arc that consists of working up the nerve to ask out a smart Asian girl (Valerie Tian), and Emmit remains merely annoying.
As is the norm for Apatow product, pic is conspicuously devoid of directorial flair and visual niceties, qualities clearly not required of hit comedies but perhaps neither to be so assiduously avoided.
