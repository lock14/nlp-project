Oh, for the spare, sartorial flash and conspicuously consumptive Reformation rock of the House of Tudor, the most scandalously enlightened of all of England's dynastic monarchies. Between Henry VIII's 16th century turbulent connubial antics � forever seeking a male heir, he famously tallied up six wives: "Two beheaded, one died, two divorced, one survived," as my high school crib sheet had it � and his break with the Holy Roman Empire and subsequent creation of the Church of England, this chapter of British history has long been rich in drama (queens and otherwise). So it should shock no one that The Other Boleyn Girl
, adapted from Philippa Gregory's novel, resembles a tragicomic reality show imported from some other, more fashion-forward past. (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette
 exploited similar pseudo-historical parallels to ultralouche effect and very nearly succumbed to a terminal case of cool in the process.) Done in high style but with a far more serious attention to detail, if not the historical record, Johansson plays Mary, the titular sibling to Anne (Portman), whose socially ambitious father, Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) seeks to marry off (or pimp out) the more spirited Anne to Bana's Henry VIII, whose current wife, Catherine of Aragon (Torrent), has been unable to birth an heir to the crown of England. As fate would have it, the king favors Mary over Anne and promptly beds this other
 girl, producing a male offspring almost immediately. Having borne the king a child out of wedlock, Mary is banished to the not-altogether-inhospitable English countryside, while a scheming Anne usurps both her own sister and Catherine of Aragon. Hilarity does not ensue. The Other Boleyn Girl
 works both as an engagingly sordid meditation on protofeminism and contemporized sisterhood set in a time and a place where either/or were grounds for, at the very least, defenestration. Director Chadwick and production designer John Paul Kelly (Tristram Shandy: A Cock & Bull Story
) take pains to re-create the broody, conniving atmosphere of the court of Henry VIII (there's some impressively invisible CGI work going on in the background of several sequences), and the pairing of Johansson and Portman (besides being the wettest of fanboy dreamings) is deliciously inspired. They go at it, the two of them, with a sort of seething sibling gusto right up until the final fatal slice. Bana, who in the past has disappeared into roles and never quite returned (Hulk
 was nearly an event horizon for the actor), imbues Henry with enough conflicted emotions to give Bruce Banner pause; he lusts, he rages, he rapes, and ultimately goes emo on us, so heavy is the thorny crown atop his brow. At least, in the end, he still had
 a brow.


"The Other Boleyn Girl" is the kind of potted historical drama that's not good enough to take seriously and, sadly, not bad enough to be any fun. It's handsome, heavy-breathing, and silly - British royal history with the DNA of a "Gossip Girl" episode.
The film's also the latest in the Tudor-chic cottage industry: all those Elizabeths on film and TV, "The Tudors" ripsnorting away on Showtime, and, of course, Philippa Gregory's popular novels, of which 2002's "The Other Boleyn Girl" was the first. (She has since written five more, cranking them out like "authentic" period sausage.)
The attractions, as ever, are the outsized palace personalities, here a young, rapscallious Henry VIII (Eric Bana, miscast) torn between two warring Boleyn sisters, mouseburger Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and man-eater Anne (Natalie Portman). Both are his mistresses but only one is holding out for a crown. What's a king to do? Apparently everything but run the country.
Directed by Justin Chadwick, with a screenplay adapted by Peter Morgan ("The Queen") on one of his lesser days, "The Other Boleyn Girl" shows Henry initially lusting for the older Anne, then falling for the warmer, younger Mary, then switching course one or two more times. And you thought you and your siblings had issues.
Whoever the king wants is fine by the girls' hapless father, Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance), and their uncle, the scheming Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey). A Boleyn mistress, they figure, may result in a Boleyn heir on the throne, since Henry's Number 1 Queen, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent, once the child star of 1976's "Cria"), has hit menopause with only Bloody Mary to show for it.
There's the germ of a serious idea here: the ruthlessness with which women throughout history have been used by ambitious men as tools for advancement, and their helplessness to do anything about it. Sir Thomas is quite happy to pimp his daughters to Henry, even the married Mary (her spineless husband is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, the perv in "Atonement"). The girls' mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) can only snarl impotently.
"The Other Boleyn Girl," though, is a soap opera set at Hampton Court, with an Australian and two Americans playacting British nobility. That might work if there were some subversive snap to the filmmaking, but Morgan's dialogue wheezes ("I find you much changed, Mistress Anne" - stuff like that), and Chadwick directs with dogged faithfulness to cliché. Whenever the movie switches to a new location, we get a shot of someone riding! riding! across the downs. I kept waiting for one of the Monty Python boys to step out from behind a shrub and clop a pair of coconut shells together.
Johansson mostly furrows her brow as the docile, dumber Boleyn girl, and Bana invites hoots as a sensitive New Age Henry. Portman gets to break out the Big Acting, though, and she's good company as she stamps her foot and careens from saucy to penitent to vengeful to callous to desperate. That's already five more emotions than Queen Amidala got to show, and she kept her head.
You know the story. Anne nags Henry into starting the English Reformation already so he can get a divorce and make her Queen Number 2; she presents him with a daughter (who will grow up to be Cate Blanchett) before falling afoul of court intrigues and rumor, the worst presented here as near-fact in the movie's most chowderheaded subplot.
The rest is hokum: The historical Mary Boleyn was probably much older than her sister, not the other way around, and their liaisons with the king took place years apart (it's also highly doubtful Mary's son was Henry's). I know, the genre's called historical fiction, but a movie this insipid isn't worth running to the Internet to figure out what actually happened. "The Other Boleyn Girl" aspires to royal-purple drama but it's a waterlogged paperback romance at best.

Aside from the frolicking of the Greek gods, the bedroom high jinks of the European royals may be the closest thing we have to a ready-made literary-historical soap opera. The saga of Henry VIII has always had a special contempo juiciness. Yes, it happened 500 years ago, but it hinges on the invention  or, at least, the popularization  of divorce, a fact portrayed with indelible flair in such pop cultural touchstones as A Man for All Seasons  and The Six Wives of Henry VIII . The latest incarnation of the saga, The Other Boleyn Girl , is a classy romantic cocktail distinguished by its tart yet breezy bite. It was written by Peter Morgan, and here, as in the two celebrated films he scripted in 2006  The Queen  and The Last King of Scotland   Morgan displays a breathless fascination with the lace-on-steel intricacies of power. He turns gossip into art, or tries to.
Early in The Other Boleyn Girl , we're asked to marvel at the unseemliness of the Boleyn men, as they engineer a liaison at the family's country estate between their eldest eligible lass, the dark-haired flirt Anne (Natalie Portman), and King Henry himself (Eric Bana), whose queen has failed, over and over, to provide him with a male heir. It's funny, in a grand way, to see a scandalous extramarital fling orchestrated with the pomp of a debutante ball. At the estate, Henry has a hunting accident that results, indirectly, from Anne's hubris. He returns, in a huff, to the royal court, and the only way that the family can get back in his good graces is to offer up its other daughter, the wholesome, honey blond Mary (Scarlett Johansson). Which makes the whole sordid setup feel like a glorified act of pimping.
The king takes to Mary  to her curves and her amber waves of hair, to her gentle supplicant nature. (Few actresses know how to submit  with the parted-lip sensuality of Scarlett Johansson.) That's how the Boleyns, with an ambition that is literally naked, open the door to power. Yet the quality that Morgan, as a screenwriter, is most drawn to is the power of persuasion  the kind that intrigues with its duplicity, that harvests bold choices from limited opportunities. Thus the agent of action the movie revolves around is Anne, who after a brief exile to France returns, ready to exert her influence in a way that's both cold and admirable, ruthless yet nobly feminist. She will have the king after all, but on her own terms. And she'll make him think it was on his.
The Other Boleyn Girl  offers the pleasures you want, and expect, from a middlebrow royal-court soaper. The actors playing the scheming Boleyns flex their eyebrows on dastardly cue, and the director, Justin Chadwick, shoots the castle interiors with a grandeur just primitive enough to make parlors barely distinguishable from tower prison cells. As Henry, Eric Bana, huge and mighty and bearded, his eyes aglow, wears his big square layers of decorative fabric with majestic physicality. He's courtlier, less infantile, than the Henrys we're used to, until he gets to the bedroom, where he treats women like legs of mutton  as tasty treats to be devoured.
A disenchanted fairy tale about what happens after its sister Cinderellas move to the castle, The Other Boleyn Girl  is crisply enjoyable, its cynicism polished to a high sheen, yet there's also something rigid and slightly locked-in about it. Morgan's characters are a little too abstract this time. They manipulate engagingly, yet they don't fully breathe. Adapting a novel by Philippa Gregory, Morgan imposes a structure that is nearly always visible  far more so than in his modern political dramas (like The Queen  or the rise–of–Tony Blair teleplay The Deal ), in which the psychology of the scheme is all. Henry, after countless mistresses, is supposed to finally fall hard for the one woman who will stand up to him. But the way the film presents it, his latent swooning is just another piece in the puzzle. You don't quite buy it.
What you do believe is the self-deluded treachery of Portman's Anne. There's a bold new authority to the actress' sensuality. She sparkles with deception, daring to flaunt passion as well as ambition. Anne, a woman ahead of her time, isn't quite shrewd enough about her own time. Yet as she uses her wiles, not merely to seduce the king but to render that seduction legitimate, she fulfills herself and destroys herself, making the world safe for social climbers everywhere.


 More slog than romp, “The Other Boleyn Girl” tells the salacious story of two hot blue bloods who ran amok and partly unclothed in the court of Henry VIII. Best known for losing her head to the king, first metaphorically, then literally, Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman, saucy), along with her sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson, sedate), entered the court of the king (Eric Bana, brooding and glowering) when he was still wed to Catherine  of Aragon (Ana Torrent). A man of considerable and changeable appetites, the king yearned for a male heir and anything in a frock who wasn’t the queen. His sexual wish was their command.  According to this oddly plotted and frantically paced pastiche — written by Peter Morgan, directed by Justin Chadwick — the girls were more or less the Paris and Nicky Hilton of the Tudor court. In the film’s version of the Boleyn family saga, based on the novel by Philippa Gregory of the same title, they were pimped out by their scheming, ambitious father, Sir Thomas (a spidery Mark Rylance), who sought to advance the family on the backs of his daughters while Mrs. Sir Thomas  (Kristin Scott Thomas) clucked darkly from the sidelines. Forced to compete for kingly favors, the women were soon rivals, a contest that, in its few meagerly entertaining moments, recalls the sisterly love in “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”  The story of Anne Boleyn may sound as if it’s been cut from classier cloth than that delirious Robert Aldrich film, but history tells a juicier story. One of Anne’s biographers, Joanna Denny, writes that while at the French court Mary got around (she was “passed on from man to man”),  which I don’t remember from high school or public television. Instead of letting the story rip, though, the film plays it safe and predictable by dividing the sisters into the bad brunette and gentle blonde, thereby displacing the courtly intrigue onto two warring women. The Boleyn sisters were the kind of trouble that can make for bodice-ripping entertainment, but they were also the kind of unruly women who sometimes risked burning.  Anne faced the sword, not the stake, but that’s jumping ahead of this story and its galloping horses, bustling  gowns and rampaging royals. It’s a marvel that something that feels so inert should have so much frenetic action. Shot in high-definition video with a murky brown palette (perhaps to suggest tea-stained porcelain and teeth), the film is both underwritten and overedited. Many of the scenes seem to have been whittled down to the nub, which at times turns it into a succession of wordless gestures and poses. Given the generally risible dialogue, this isn’t a bad thing, despite Mr. Morgan’s previous credits (notably “The Queen”). Ms. Portman’s eyes, Mr. Bana’s hands and Ms. Johansson’s chin all receive vigorous workouts.  “The Other Boleyn Girl” has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Roving hands, rolling heads.

Playing less fast and loose with history than Philippa Gregory�s novel, �The Other Boleyn Girl� is a sexy, good-looking political bodice-ripper with an almost flawless cast at the top of its game. With a straight-arrow script by Peter Morgan (�The Queen�) and smooth direction by Brit TV helmer Justin Chadwick (�Bleak House�), pic has the feel of an Old Hollywood studio costumer freshened up with contempo technique and acting styles. Tip-top cast, led by Eric Bana and Scarlett Johansson as Henry VIII and Mary Boleyn, could make this score beyond upscale auds with aggressive promotion and good reviews.
Gregory�s 2002 bestseller was previously made into a British telepic of the same title in 2003. Present item has none of the raggedy, low-budget feel of that partly improvised work, and scripter Morgan (who wrote the 2003 miniseries �Henry VIII�) seems utterly at ease with the characters here.
Morgan manages the difficult trick of making the narrative crystal-clear without dumbing down the actual material. By eliminating many of the more fanciful potboiler elements in Gregory�s novel, the script simplifies the tangled web of 16th-century Tudor court intrigues into a clean, fast-moving  yarn that�s both highly cinematic and immediately engaging at a character level.
After sketching the idyllic country childhood of sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn, pic jumps straight to the marriage of the shy, elder Mary (Johansson) to the son of a merchant family (Benedict Cumberbatch). For the much more knowing, ambitious Anne (Natalie Portman), her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance), has bigger plans to advance the family�s standing, despite the reservations of his wife, Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas).
Urged on by his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey), and noting how Henry VIII�s current wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), has failed to produce a male heir, Sir Thomas invites the king for a hunting visit and orders Anne to �bewitch� the monarch and become his mistress. Alas, the plan backfires and Henry falls for Mary instead. Sir Thomas & Co. quickly switch to Plan B, in which Mary takes Anne�s place, with the endorsement of her milquetoast husband.
Invited to the king�s court as a lady-in-waiting, Mary is frostily received by the dignified Catherine and accompanied by a pissed-off Anne. In a beautifully calibrated bedroom scene between Mary and Henry that�s marbled with genuine tenderness and sexual frissons, the two become lovers, to the delight of Sir Thomas and Norfolk. In a tantrum, Anne elopes with a nobody (Oliver Coleman), but is quickly packed off to France by her father to teach her a lesson.
Swept along by a rich score by Paul Cantelon (�The Diving Bell and the Butterfly�), and costumed by Derek Jarman/Neil Jordan alum Sandy Powell in fabric heavy on blues, reds and golds, pic sets a rich stage for the second half, signaled by Anne�s return from temporary exile in Gaul. Confidently garbed in a dazzling green gown that immediately contrasts with the pic�s color scheme, Anne teases, taunts and flirts outrageously with Henry, driving a wedge between him and her sister and prepping the narrative for a fast-moving final act of plot reversals and rolling heads.
With the flashier role and some of the sharpest lines, Portman�s Anne dominates more of the early going than seems dramatically right for a movie whose title refers to the lesser-known sister. But at the end of the day, Johansson�s quieter Mary comes through as the pic�s emotional center, her tender love story with the conflicted monarch evoking the only genuine feelings on display.Johansson�s slow-burning perf is a model of restraint, her Mary trying to make emotional sense of an environment in which marriage is simply a political and social commodity. She�s nicely contrasted by the sheer physical presence of Bana�s moody, virile Henry, who�ll finally do anything -- even cut off England from the Catholic Church -- to produce a male heir.
Though she has the lynx-like eyes and ambition down pat, Portman doesn�t quite bring the necessary heft to make Anne a truly dominant power player, partly because she seems the least comfortable of the three non-Brit leads acting with acquired English accents.
Rest of the cast is aces, with Scott Thomas investing every syllable of her dialogue with extra resonance, Morrissey a powerful dramatic presence as the villainous Norfolk and Rylance cleverly playing Sir Thomas� scheming in an unexpectedly low key. Spanish thesp Torrent brings an impressive dignity to her few scenes to the tragically sidelined Catherine of Aragon.
Historical locations in Blighty blend seamlessly with production designer John-Paul Kelly�s studio sets to create a convincing Tudor England.
