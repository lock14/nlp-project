If last summer�s Mamma Mia!
 left you with a hunger to see more Grecian scenery onscreen, then My Life in Ruins
 offers a snack to keep your juices flowing until you make it to the Parthenon some day in the future. The snack, however, won�t be especially nutritious nor will it look as spectacular as the sun-dappled water and cliffs did in Mamma Mia!
�s Greek isle. Even though My Life in Ruins
 promotes the fact that it is the first movie in history to be granted permission by Greek authorities to film at the Acropolis, the movie might have achieved the same backgrounded picture-postcard effect by filming at Nashville�s ersatz Parthenon and just CGI-ing in some busted columns and century rot. The bland cinematography (by Jos� Luis Alcaine) fits with the unimaginative script (by veteran TV comedy writer and producer Mike Reiss) and the drab direction of Petrie (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
 and Miss Congeniality
). Vardalos, who will probably spend a lifetime trying to replicate a fraction of the phenomenal success she experienced with 2002�s My Big Fat Greek Wedding
, is again backed by the Playtone Productions group headed by Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson (who also appears in a small role). Vardalos here plays Georgia, an American scholar in Athens who is slumming as a tour guide for disinterested international travelers. Her rival tour guide (McGowan) sees to it that he gets all the best tourists and she gets the un-air-conditioned bus. Georgia swears her current tour is going to be her last; she needs to find her �kefi,� a Greek word she translates as �mojo.� Her busload of gauche tourist stereotypes isn�t helping her mood any, and neither is the silent, hairy busdriver Poupi (Georgoulis), whose name is a great source of juvenile humor. Amid the goofy Americans, man-hunting Spanish senoritas, drunken Australians, uptight Brits, and an old-lady pickpocket, Dreyfuss� widower Irv, a grieving joker, is the only spark in the group. Irv is the Dionysian spirit who pushes Georgia and the others toward their more hedonistic impulses, and Dreyfuss delivers the pushy kitsch in his own inimitable fashion. Shorn of his excess hair, Poupi is revealed as a Mediterranean god and Georgia�s obvious soulmate. Georgia also stops stressing about her clients' penchant for spending most of their time in tacky gift shops and Hard Rock Cafes instead of engaging in authentic experiences. All ends happily for everyone in the movie, but for those in the audience, the experience is so hackneyed that they�ll come out feeling like they�re wearing shirts that say, �I went to the Acropolis, but all I got was this lousy T-shirt.�

The folks responsible for "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"  - the "ethnic" romantic comedy that ate the 2002 box office  - have made "My Life in Ruins," a second cute, shoddy-looking movie. The Ruins are Greek. The life, once again, is Nia Vardalos's. The problem with the new movie is the same as with the previous one.  Vardalos has this idea that she's a marm.  And while it's true that she personifies her movies, I don't quite buy her librarian mode.
In "My Life in Ruins," the American tour guide she plays, Georgia Yanakopulos, wants to educate the travelers on her tours about Greek history (she's an unemployed professor). Georgia knows the dates every column was erected, who lived where, which god thought what. Yet the evaluations sent to her undermining boss (Bernice Stegers, who's a hoot) complain that her tours are boring. People just want to tan, eat, hook up, and shop  - goals one should be able to achieve without signing up for a weeklong trip on a tour bus, but never mind. The point is that Georgia doesn't please her crowds. She numbs them with facts.
But she's decided to quit. So this latest tour will be her last. And for the occasion, it's a deluxe edition of her usual busload of obnoxious Americans, stuffy Brits, horny Spaniards, and kooky old people. The one with the most common sense, a boisterous widower played by Richard Dreyfuss, tells Georgia to loosen up. He shoves her toward the tour's  handsome, hairy bus driver (Alexis Georgoulis). And, reluctantly, she complies, but not enough to stop seeming like a harried schoolteacher on a field trip. (She's also competing with an oily rival guide, whose tours are "fun.")
There's a degree of narcissism to Vardalos's self-deprecation. She may want us to find her plain, but she snuffs out any chances at being naturally funny. Charming might work for her, but she can't be above the zaniness that surrounds. When Dreyfuss tells her to lighten up he's doing the job of the movie's actual director, the dutiful Donald Petrie. Vardalos has a loony, Streisand side. But here she lets the rest of the cast clown it up, while she plays the wallflower. You have to believe in this approach to comedy for it to work. And I don't believe Vardalos when she plays it this straight.
If you happened to catch her on the run with Toni Collette, as half of a drag-cabaret team in the horribly underrated "Connie and Carla"  - and I'm betting you did not  - you know that she's smarter, brighter, and loonier than the humorless, put-upon women she plays in these Greek movies. There's comedy in being put-upon, by the way, but in both her Greek movies, Vardalos leaves most of the gags to the actors hamming it up.  Here, instead of Andrea Martin and Lainie Kazan blurring the line between bawdy stereotype and the way it is as they did in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," we get, for instance, Caroline Goodall as an uptight English matron. She's not amusing in the least.
But neither really is Vardalos. We're supposed to believe that Georgia has neither inner life nor native sexiness. But when she actually does cut loose with little vamps, she's so good at it that the character's primmer version seems like a gag. Worse, the screenwriter, Mike Reiss, possibly in an attempt to capture the first movie's Prince Charming feeling, pushes Georgia into the bus driver's arms,  which makes no sense since Dreyfuss is right there.
After so many movies of grizzled, shady characters (his face and modest girth still carry traces of the Dick Cheney he played in Oliver Stone's "W."), mercifully, Dreyfuss is his wily, spring-loaded self again. He and Vardalos are funny and sexy together. She makes him laugh. He makes her feel attractive. There's something between them here. And it's impossible to trust a movie that can't see that.

My Life in Ruins  is a middle-aged Hallmark chick flick that makes you wish you were on a Greek vacation (and not, in fact, watching the movie). It's as if a producer saw Mamma Mia!  and said, ''Give me that same feeling  only easier on the brain!'' The film's star, Nia Vardalos, embraces fluff with something like hunger. Blunt and brassy, with a meticulous windswept mane and an air of officious sexiness, she might be warming up to star in The Arianna Huffington Story .
The movie sets her down in the sunlit splendor of Greece  in the hope that the setting reminds us of the resplendent popularity of My Big Fat Greek Wedding . Vardalos plays Georgia, a former professor of classical history now reduced  to the career of world's most boringly academic travel guide. On a sightseeing bus, trying to rev up a pack of rude, dumb, vulgar tourists as they tromp through civilization's ruins, she's supposed to be touchingly uptight and insecure, but Vardalos attacks this wallflower role with the no-nonsense, strictly business eye contact of a talk-show therapist. She might have invented the term charm offensive .
The folks on the bus include a widower (Richard Dreyfuss) who covers his grief with painfully bad jokes about fondling nude statues; a pancake-house executive (Alistair McGowan) who thinks the Temple of Hephaestus looks like an IHOP; a couple (Rachel Dratch and Harland Williams) whose idea of an ancient landmark is the Hard Rock; and the native-born bus driver (Alexis Georgoulis), a burly, bearded bear of a man whose name  warning: unspeakable ethnic bathroom joke ahead   is Poupi Kakas. The weird thing is, Poupi is the romantic lead. Early on, he shaves his beard, revealing himself to be a kind of Greek Fabio, the sort of salt-of-the-earth pinup that the film thinks a schoolmarm like Georgia needs.
She keeps being told that she's a woman who has lost her kefi   that is, her joie de vivre. But if you had been stuck with the bozos on this bus, then you might have lost your kefi  too. Directed by Donald Petrie (Miss Congeniality ), My Life in Ruins  is the romantic comedy as fairy tale for cheese addicts, yet I have to admit, the film is so brazen about its pandering, crumple-hearted silliness that it had me rooting for Vardalos to land her big fat Greek stud-muffin. Next time, though, she should serve the kefi  on the side.

 “My Life in Ruins,” Nia Vardalos’s first movie in five years, might as well be titled “How Georgia Got Her Kefi Back” — Georgia being Ms. Vardalos’s character, a Greek-American tour guide in the old country, and kefi being the Greek word for joy, high spirits, life force, whatever. This transparent bid to repeat the success of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” the 2002 blockbuster that made Ms. Vardalos the movies’ ultimate one-hit wonder, will be counted a success if it grosses one-tenth of its forerunner’s $368 million worldwide take. Because her 2004 follow-up, “Connie and Carla,” earned only $11.3 million, the chances of that are iffy.  Directed by Donald Petrie (“Miss Congeniality,” “Grumpy Old Men”) from a screenplay by Mike Reiss that is larded with stale 1970s-style sitcom humor, “My Life in Ruins” has none of the homey authenticity of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” (which Ms. Vardalos wrote). Seven years after her breakthrough, Ms. Vardalos may be slimmer and more glamorous, but she seems less real. Her character is an aspiring professor who, desperate for work, has taken a job as a guide for a second-rate touring outfit that buses visitors to the Parthenon and other ancient sites.  The screenplay’s notion of wit is to name the shaggy, uncommunicative driver of Georgia’s broken-down tour bus Poupi Kakas (Alexis Georgoulis); its idea of romance is to have this frog, whom someone refers to as Sasquatch, turn into Prince Charming. All it takes is a shave and a trim and the revelation that the monosyllabic oaf really speaks perfect English; and when he takes off his shirt, ooh la la! His transformation is the latter-day equivalent of that magic Hollywood moment when a homely secretary, upon removing her glasses, is revealed as a knockout.  The stereotypically obnoxious passengers aboard the rickety bus include snooty Britons, man-hungry Spanish spitfires, beer-guzzling Australians and boorish Americans who would rather shop for tchotchkes than sightsee. There is an adorable little old lady who happens to be a kleptomaniac. The noisiest traveler is Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), a shtick-spewing, Viagra-popping widower who, at the Oracle of Delphi, delivers self-help bromides through a hole in the stone.  Under the warming Greek sun this crabby crew eventually mellows into a smiley-faced extended family caught up in the spirit of kefi. By the end of a movie that shamelessly refers to both “Zorba the Greek” and “Never on Sunday,” Georgia has metamorphosed into a veritable Zorbette of sexy good vibes.  “My Life in Ruins” is not likely to spur much tourism to Greece. The sights, though impressive, are not photographed interestingly, and the citizens of the host country are less than welcoming. Before the advent of kefi the tourists are jammed into a crummy hotel in which nothing works. With the exception of Poupi, the Greeks are portrayed as lazy, lecherous peddlers who are more than happy to make fools of visitors and, when possible, to rob them blind.  “My Life in Ruins” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color humor and some strong language.

The surprise success of the indie romantic comedy "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" was one of those rare movie occurrences no one could have designed or predicted. Which is precisely why Nia Vardalos' latest toplining effort, "My Life in Ruins," is doomed from the start: In attempting to replicate "Wedding's" appeal and recycle a number of now-familiar elements, the new pic -- about an embittered Greek-American tour guide's search for love and happiness -- feels like warmed-over souvlaki. Some fans of the original may line up for seconds, but this comedy will hold a decidedly more modest allure.
Lacking marquee names and a high-concept hook, 2002's "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which Vardalos scripted and starred in, was vastly more successful ($356 million worldwide) than it had any reason to be. Fans -- largely femme and older filmgoers -- were charmed by its universal themes, broad humor and Vardalos' vanity-free performance as ethnic Everywoman Toula Portokalos. In "My Life in Ruins," her first bigscreen outing since 2004's "Connie and Carla," Vardalos plays Georgia, a single Athens-based tour guide who's lost her "kefi" (zest or mojo).
But from the moment Vardalos struts onscreen in her 2�-inch wedges, thigh-baring skirts and honey-toned Sarah Palin coiffure, it's clear she's undergone a major transformation: Gone are the endearing clumsiness, simple frocks, untamed hair and, from the looks of it, at least 20 pounds. Nevertheless, like Toula, Georgia works at a travel agency, engages with a cast of colorful characters and eventually falls for a tall, sensitive guy with long hair.
That would be tour bus driver Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis), whose entrance under a thicket-like beard elicits uninspired Sasquatch comparisons. Beginning yet another extended tour through Greece, would-be classics professor Georgia finds herself relegated to a dilapidated bus filled with every conceivable tourist stereotype.
While her rival, snarky tour guide Niko (Alistair McGowan), gets an air-conditioned coach filled with polite Canadians, Georgia gets an overheated jalopy that includes boozing Australians (Simon Gleeson, Natalie O'Donnell); obnoxious Americans (Rachel Dratch, Harland Williams); sultry Spanish divorcees (Maria Botto, Maria Adanez); kooky seniors (Ralph Nossek, Bernice Stegers) and a Jewish widower (Richard Dreyfuss) with a penchant for Borscht Belt comedy. Among others. Only Dreyfuss manages to develop his role into a dimensional, compassionate character.
Over the course of a week that sees Georgia leading them all through the resplendent ruins of Athens, Olympia and Delphi, this improbable group will endure ugly squabbles, bruising misunderstandings and brushes with disaster, and eventually transcend them all to become a United Nations of peace, love and understanding. Cue the music.
It's not that this premise is so altogether improbable -- what tourist hasn't bonded with strangers while sharing close quarters in a foreign land? -- but that it feels tired from the start. The wincingly broad jokes and recycled situational humor (the script was penned by TV scribe Mike Reiss, rather than Vardalos herself) are given lackluster direction by Donald Petrie, and no amount of glorious Greek scenery can make auds forget this is a tour they should have skipped.
It's worth noting, though, that Greece has rarely looked so good, and it's a probable measure of Vardalos' near-iconic status in her motherland that the production was able to shoot so freely in generally restricted locations such as the Acropolis and the Temple of Delphi.

Substitute "career" for "life" in the title of this stillborn travelogue comedy, and you'll have a succinct verdict on My Big Fat Greek Wedding  writer/star Nia Vardalos , whose efforts to prove herself more than a one-megahit wonder have been greeted by audiences with an apathy previously reserved for the post–Crocodile Dundee   oeuvre of Paul Hogan  (see the short-lived 2003 sitcom My Big Fat Greek Life  and the even shorter-lived 2004 drag-queen farce Connie and Carla ). Here, in the opening salvo of her double-barreled 2009 comeback bid—the Vardalos-scripted and -directed I Hate Valentine's Day  is set to follow in July—the Greek-Canadian comedienne once more tries to parlay her Hellenic pride into box-office gold, starring as an unemployed history professor reduced to working as an Athenian tour guide. The result, written by The Simpsons  alum Mike Reiss  and directed (in a manner of speaking) by Grumpy Old Men 's Donald Petrie , is a strangely self-loathing affair that paints Vardalos's tour group as a uniformly ill-mannered, culturally illiterate bunch, while rendering Greece  itself as a badly plumbed third-world hellhole run by lazy, Zorba-dancing louts. The requisite ugly Americans are here, as well as the beer-guzzling Aussies and one wizened, Viagra -popping widower (Richard Dreyfuss , really  slumming it). But then, what did you expect from a movie with characters named Poupi and Doudi Kakas?
