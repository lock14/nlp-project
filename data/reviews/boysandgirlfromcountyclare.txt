At this rate, the latest John Irvin film may have fiddles and farm animals in the title by the time it hits video stores.
Several months ago when it played the Boston Film Festival, Irvin's movie was known as ''The Boys From County Clare." Now it's called ''The Boys & Girl From County Clare," apparently in an effort to get the greatest mileage out of its most engaging and talked-about performance, delivered by fresh-faced Irish pop singer Andrea Corr.
This title change doesn't give the film any more heft than it had previously -- it's still as thin and frothy as the head on a pint of Guinness -- but if you're a big fan of the Celt-rock group The Corrs, then maybe it's worth the expanded labeling to give a diva her due. Most other people would say they had us at ''County Clare" anyway.
Scottish-English director Irvin (''Hamburger Hill," ''A Month By the Lake") has always been good at creating vibrant landscapes, and he's right at home in mid-1960s Ireland, where quaint mores, traditions, and musical tastes are beginning to butt heads with a Beatles-tuned world. By doting on spectacular vistas and lively pub culture, Irvin serves up a setting so warm and inviting, it's at least a seductive commercial for Aer Lingus. Unfortunately for this filmmaker, your own holidays will probably produce better stories.
In ''The Boys & Girl From County Clare," first-time screenwriter Nicholas Adams tells the highly unoriginal tale of two Irish brothers who decades ago had a major falling out -- over a dame, natch -- and haven't spoken since the younger one ran off to Liverpool, leaving a trail of broken hearts and abdicated responsibilities. Now, four-time divorcee Jimmy (Colm Meaney) is returning home to compete in an annual ceili band contest, which big brother John Joe (Bernard Hill) figures his own band stands to win again handily, regardless.
After much meandering and a few comical efforts to sabotage each other on the way to contest registration, the brothers meet, trade insults, and let the rest of their discord fizzle quickly over beers.
That's all very well and Irish, but it leaves the remaining half of the film to make something interesting out of tired abandonment themes, toothless mother-daughter catfights, and a musical competition that happens largely behind the scenes.
Meanwhile, the young romance that blossoms between John Joe's star fiddle player (Corr) and Jimmy's talented flutist (Shaun Evans) is adorable, sure, but about as dramatically complex as ''From Justin to Kelly." Corr, whose previous acting experience included minor roles in ''The Commitments" and ''Evita," doesn't even get to sing in this movie, though she does play that fiddle as if she means it.
More might have been made of the Beatles-era generation gap and countless other fertile, dissonant elements tossed too lightly into this good-natured mix. Instead, the boys and girl are from a County Clare that no one will have a problem with, and that no one will particularly remember in the morning either.

veryone is likable in John Irvin's appealing if obvious little fable about two estranged brothers and their ceili, or traditional Irish, bands. That includes the supposed bad guy, Jimmy (Colm Meaney), who left Ireland for Liverpool 24 years ago to make money and acquire several wives, and his brother John Joe (Bernard Hill), who stayed home to run the family farm and never married. The other significant characters are Anne (Andrea Corr), a pretty young fiddler in John Joe's ceili (pronounced KAY-lee) group, and her mother, Maisie (Charlotte Bradley), who has somehow managed never to tell Anne the identity of her father. Everyone will come together during the finals of the All Ireland music competition, which each brother believes that his group deserves to win, with the complicating addition of Teddy (Shaun Evans), a handsome young member of Jimmy's band who falls for Anne at first sight. The time is the 1960's, which is made clear by occasional mentions of the Beatles (who the older generation seems to think are jazz musicians) and the presence as minor characters of hippies in a van with a psychedelic paint job. Otherwise, this Ireland of pubs and pranks seems to exist in a warm travel-industry timelessness. In Nicholas Adams's script, both sides play dirty tricks (stolen bus wheels and musical instruments, silly delays at customs), with the goal of keeping the other band from competing. It isn't necessary to state a theme, but Jimmy does. Encountering his brother for the first time in decades, he says, "And you know full well this isn't just about the music." Predictably, at least one family secret will be revealed. Ms. Corr is a member of the Irish musical group the Corrs; her previous movie acting experience has consisted of small roles in "Evita" (as Juan Per�n's mistress) and "The Commitments." She displays considerable screen presence here.

A traditional Irish music competition serves to ignite new passions, freshen old resentments and stir up the rivalry between two long-feuding brothers in "The Boys From County Clare." Given a lift by its folksy soundtrack of toe-tapping Ceili dance tunes, the film is handsomely produced and engaging enough, but never more than that due to a weak dramatic arc and soft conflicts in Nicholas Adams' script and to John Irvin's functional direction. Theatrical prospects appear mild at best, although older audiences may respond to the comedy-drama's sweet sentiments and musical accent.
Set in the late '60s, the story starts in Liverpool, where successful businessman Jimmy (Colm Meaney) prepares to return to his native Ireland for the first time in more than 20 years, taking his Ceili band to participate in an annual music competition. Back in County Clare, Jimmy's estranged older brother John Joe (Bernard Hill) also readies his band for the contest.
Tension between Jimmy and John Joe is heightened by their past relationships to Maisie (Charlotte Bradley), who plays piano in the latter's band. While John Joe was in love with her, Jimmy seduced Maisie years earlier and then vanished to Liverpool, leaving her to raise her daughter Anne (Andrea Corr) alone. Maisie's bitterness and distrust of men causes her to keep Anne on a tight leash. But the independent-minded girl -- a talented fiddle player in John Joe's band -- breaks away when she falls for Jimmy's star flute player Teddy (Shaun Evans).
While it's set up as the dramatic heart of the film, the music competition final comes and goes with a relatively low buildup. Rather than resolving the characters' conflicts to coincide with the event, the script deals with them both during and after the contest, often evaporating without much dramatic muscle. The harmony of the final outcome is touching, however, and reasonably satisfying, despite the shortage of emotional sparks.
Meaney plays an irascible, foul-mouthed Irishman like several he's played before, but does so with energy and humor, working well against Hill's soft-edged crustiness and quiet air of melancholy, especially as fraternal feelings return between them. In her first leading film role, Corr -- of Irish pop group the Corrs -- acquits herself with self assurance. Similarly appealing fellow newcomer Evans shows sensitivity and warmth.
Cinematographer Thomas Burstyn's subdued colors and polished widescreen lensing, and Tom McCullagh's unemphatic period production design give the film a classy look. Unspoiled locations on the Isle of Man and in Northern Ireland stood in for the West.

"How can shit like this happen to the same guy twice?" was Bruce Willis 's lament in Die Hard 2 , which shouldered both its Xerox  plot and its body bags lightly thanks to a pervading air of jokey self-reflexivity. No such luck for the similarly repetition-compulsive Hostage , which stacks its corpses with the same baroque hysteria that Björk brought to the murder scene in Dancer in the Dark . Ex-SWAT Willis is a cocky longhair hostage negotiator in L.A. until a crisis slips from his grasp, leaving a mother and her son dead. No sooner has Willis shaved his head and moved to a PD in the sticks than three well-armed local teens attempt to steal an SUV and instead end up locked in a hyper-modern hilltop fortress with affectless accountant Kevin Pollak  and his two brats. Turns out Pollak has some nasty dealings with guys in balaclavas, who detain yet more innocents . . .
Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage  is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods. Much of the rescue strategy, for instance, hinges on the head captor never noticing that the younger kid is loose in the house, and the filmmakers scrabble desperately for a class subtext, pitting dirty-rich Pollak versus poor white trash, with Willis caught in the middle class. Once the craziest of the housejackersthe baleful spawn of a Crispin Glover -Trent Reznor  hatefuckgets a knife through the cheek and turns pyromaniacally love-lorn, Hostage  begins to evoke the notebook scrawlings of a trench-coat-mafia goon.
