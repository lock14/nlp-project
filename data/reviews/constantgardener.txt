Who do you mourn for most in "The Constant Gardener"? Author John le Carre, whose richly intelligent thrillers have become more moralistic and less nuanced as the Cold War fades into history? Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, who here gets his tepid big-budget reward for making the astonishing "City of God" in 2002? Or is it the topic of big corporations arrogantly using Africa as their test lab that's most poorly served by this movie?
Wilted bouquets all around: "The Constant Gardener" is a predictable conspiracy thriller that somehow ends up diminishing the real urgency of the West's humanitarian disconnect from Africa. If it sends audiences home to log on to the Amnesty International website, terrific -- but that still doesn't make it a very good movie.
Some will think so nevertheless, seduced by the antic post-"Bourne Identity" camerawork, by the seriousness of the film's concerns, and by Ralph Fiennes's exquisitely understated performance in the title role. He plays Justin Quayle, a midlevel British career diplomat who has a way with houseplants and a lifelong inability to offend anyone. When his friend and boss Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) breaks the news that Justin's wife has died in mysterious circumstances, it's the widower who ends up consoling his consoler.
Sandy and Justin are the British Embassy's men in Kenya, but it's a woman -- Justin's late wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz) -- who has caused all the bees to swarm out of their hives. "The Constant Gardener" opens with Tessa's (offscreen) murder by the side of a remote African lake and then moves backward in time, detailing the couple's courtship and Tessa's uncovering of a plot by a shadowy pharmaceutical company to use impoverished Africans as guinea pigs. "We're not killing people who wouldn't be dead anyway," rationalizes one of the players with a shrug.
"This is how the world [expletive] Africa," says another character, a cynical truism screenwriter/adapter Jeffrey Caine wants to stick in the complacent throats of Western audiences. The message might be heard more clearly if it weren't sugarcoated with cliched derring-do. As Justin retraces his dead wife's steps, he comes up against threatening notes, ominous black BMWs, not one but two
 incriminating letters, and the sort of miraculous computer hackery that suggests screenwriters might find a profitable sideline as IT consultants.
There's also a thuggish corporate head (Gerald McSorley) and a Machiavellian dandy of a British lord (Bill Nighy), both characters written and played with the complexity that is a le Carre hallmark. And, yes, there are a few Africans such as Tessa's doctor friend (Herbert Kounde), but "Gardener" is one of those well-intentioned tales that largely denies its victims the dignity of a role in their own saving. White folks made this mess, the film implies, and white folks can clean it up.
So the movie puts all its chips on Tessa as a ferociously committed idealist whose zeal leads her into questionable moral choices that threaten her marriage. There are two problems here. First, you have to twist your suspension of disbelief into a knot of yogic contortion to accept that Justin and Tessa are a believable couple ("You're quite scary," he tells her at their first meeting, and he's right).
Second, there are those of us who find Weisz one of the most irritating actresses currently working, a performer who emits the strident self-righteousness of the roles she habitually plays. Loving protestations to the contrary, Tessa treats her milquetoast husband as a patsy, and while that's an interesting movie, it's not the one intended.
But maybe that's just me. Luckily, Weisz is offscreen much of the time, leaving us to contemplate Fiennes as he carefully prunes the weeds out of Justin's personality. The character emerges a stronger if more endangered species, especially after he returns to Europe for a final connecting of the dots: A scene in which he revisits the London apartment where he and Tessa first lived and quietly weeps for all he has lost is the most emotionally true moment in the entire film. The reticent hero moved to action by love is a device le Carre borrowed from Graham Greene, and it's a deeply British concept Fiennes seems to understand in his bones: When everybody's shouting, it's best to watch the quiet ones. In this movie, sadly, the plot shouts louder.
Meirelles is working again with his "City of God" cinematographer Cesar Charlone, and "The Constant Gardener" is a visual feast of off-kilter angles, saturated film stocks, and shifting focal planes. None of this particularly strengthens or detracts from the movie, but you could argue that it's merely another form of shouting. Is it possible, in the end, to get American and European mass audiences to care about Africa without resorting to tired huggermugger? Would a straight-up drama reach the most people? Would a factual documentary go unseen? Or should Hollywood just pull out the stops, send Tom Cruise to Niger with the "Mission: Impossible" team and a fistful of McDonald's
 vouchers, and get it all on "Oprah"? It's a knotty question, and "The Constant Gardener" never addresses it.


         John Le Carr� has been a writer of literate thrillers almost as long as Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles has been alive. He is a master novelist of the traditional school, while Meirelles, witness his Oscar-nominated "City of God," has a jumpy, edgy, ultramodern filmmaking style. Their methods shouldn't mix, but in "The Constant Gardener," assisted by superior acting by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz and an outstanding supporting cast, they've joined forces to create a film that grips us dramatically, intellectually and emotionally.
 
  As it turns out, the novelist (whose work was translated to film by screenwriter Jeffrey Caine) and the director have several things in common, including powerful storytelling gifts and the will to make a difference in the world. For if Le Carré's concern with the unhealthy influence of multinational corporations makes "Gardner" an unusually meaty thriller, he is matched by Meirelles' passion for socially committed and intrinsically dramatic filmmaking. Their collaboration results in an intricate yet intimate piece of work that is disturbing for all the right reasons.
 


         






    In addition to unfolding a mightily affecting love story wrapped in a complex whodunit plot, "The Constant Gardener" poses some stimulating questions. In a world where complicity in chicanery is the rule, what does it take to make a difference, what is the price individuals must pay for their idealism? And where market forces rule with an iron hand, what is the cost to society for being in thrall to unbridled corporate lust for profit?
 
  Like the novel, Meirelles' film (smartly edited by Claire Simpson, an Oscar winner for "Platoon") goes back and forth between the present and the past, as Fiennes' midlevel British diplomat Justin Quayle, characterized by Le Carré as "a Foreign Office plodder," investigates the suspicious death of his impulsive and unstoppable wife Tessa (Weisz), an activist firebrand who was everything he is not.
 
  Le Carré, no one needs to be told, is completely at home in the world of duplicity, betrayal and behind-the-scenes intrigue, and the film continually benefits from having his densely plotted novel and its textured adult characters as source material.
 
  And because Justin, by virtue of his personality and the complexity of his quest, is initially well over his head in his investigations, his mental state is a good match for the disorienting visual style Meirelles and cinematographer Cesar Charlone create. Using hand-held camerawork to create intimacy, Charlone enables us to connect on a visceral level with Justin's confusion, his sense that what he needs to know is just out of reach.
 
  The cinematographer, Oscar-nominated for "City of God," also does a remarkable job capturing the vivid, overcrowded crush of chaotic Africa. "Constant Gardener" was photographed with some difficulty in Kenya, where it takes place, and scenes caught on the fly in Nairobi's Kibera, a staggering shantytown of 800,000 to 1 million souls, connect us indelibly to this unnerving, unforgettable side of the country.
 
  Though the film starts with his wife's savage murder, Justin and Tessa's story begins not in Kenya but in England. They meet cute at his boring London lecture about foreign policy, where she, in an adroit bit of updating, lashes out at him as the representative of a British government that has sent troops to Iraq. She apologizes afterward for being rude, he calls her impassioned, and they fall into bed almost at once.
 
  Justin and Tessa are not the easiest characters to convincingly animate, but the passion and skill Fiennes and Weisz bring to the roles make it happen. Because these two are so finely drawn and so splendidly acted, we never doubt their reality, never doubt the strength of their polar attraction. She feels safe with him, he enjoys being flummoxed by her, and when he tells her he is being posted to the British High Commission in Kenya and she is wild to go along, it feels inevitable that he will agree.
 
  It's hard to think of an actor other than Ralph Fiennes who could bring Justin's mixture of timidity and attractiveness so convincingly to life. A career diplomat who goes where he's told — "like a Labrador" someone witheringly says — Fiennes' Justin not only radiates decency, consideration and unfailing politeness, he makes those qualities sexy. Until he meets Tessa, the only outlet for his considerable energy and passion is meticulous gardening.
 
  Completely inhabited by Weisz, Tessa has the kind of personality that could make even Gregor Mendel forget about his plants. It is perhaps the most fully realized performance of her career. Tessa — a woman who burns about injustice and believes that the world could be changed if people cared enough — has no difficulty speaking truth to power and sticking her nose in places, in this case the shenanigans of certain international companies, the establishment wishes she wouldn't.
 
  (Part of Tessa's vividness stems from her basis in a real person, Yvette Pierpaoli, a friend of Le Carré's and an advocate for Refugees International who died in a car accident while doing work in Kosovo. Both the novel and the film are dedicated to her as someone "who lived and died giving a damn," and Le Carré has written with great feeling that "Tessa's commitment to the poor of Africa, particularly its women, her contempt for protocol, and her unswerving, often maddening determination to have her way stemmed quite consciously, as far as I was concerned, from Yvette's example.")
 
  Justin is understandably shattered by Tessa's death. More surprisingly, he is radicalized by it. He ignores rumors of infidelity and remains determined, despite pointed warnings that "there are some very nasty things under rocks, especially in foreign gardens," to find out what she was investigating and why she died.
 
  "The Constant Gardener" concerns itself, more than anything else, with Justin's finding out, his getting of wisdom. Fiennes has described the film as "a retrospective love affair," and there is a lot of truth in that. The more Justin learns, the more his sense of loss deepens, and the more terribly moving his search becomes.
 
  Though Fiennes and Weisz carry the lion's share of the film's emotional burden, "The Constant Gardener" wouldn't be a fraction of the film it is without expert supporting work across the board. Especially noteworthy are Bill Nighy as an impeccably bloodless pillar of the establishment, Danny Huston as Justin's oleaginous boss, Gerard McSorley as a bluff business tycoon and Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Lorbeer.
 
  "The Constant Gardener" keeps the book's somber tone, though it does add on a bit more of an upbeat ending. But let no one doubt the extent of Le Carré's and Meirelles' social concern. Practically the last thing viewers see is the novelist's on-screen fusillade: "Nobody in this story, and no outfit or corporation, thank God, is based upon an actual person or outfit in the real world. But I can tell you this; as my journey ... progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard."
 
  You have been warned.

Ralph Fiennes' pale, wounded gaze and tight smile often lead him to play men who are pained, unsettled  he won a Tony award for his performance as Hamlet, Prince of Agita, and even his Nazi in Schindler's List  had Issues. But it's not just his physiognomy that marks him. Fiennes' distracted, inward-turning manner projects an ambivalence about the whole business of acting, or at least of stardom, and that itchiness conveys itself to his audience, making us more apt to speak of his work with admiration and respect than with love.
Justin Quayle, the amateur plant-fancier who takes the title in The Constant Gardener , is another hooded Fiennes fellow, a man more at ease with greenhouse cuttings than with the cocktail chatter that goes along with the post of a midlevel career diplomat stationed in Kenya. But such is the clarity and passionate intelligence of Fernando Meirelles' adaptation of John le Carré's urgent 2001 novel, about deadly pharmaceutical arrogance in Africa, that Fiennes blooms in  his most empathetic, extroverted, and lovable work in years.
As in any le Carré creation, the players in this one are morally inconstant people who keep secrets and betray those closest to them. When, at the beginning of the saga, Justin's wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz), is reported gruesomely murdered on an isolated stretch of country (she had been accompanied by a local doctor working to contain tuberculosis and AIDS, and the black-and-white pair had been rumored to be lovers), Justin himself really doesn't know what Tessa did with her days as a human rights ''activist.'' All he knows is that he adored her for her fire and for her commitment to fight, while he, a le Carré chap, after all, equivocated. (Weisz makes it easy to believe Tessa's fearlessness; she's as mobile, open-faced, and sexually alive as Fiennes is shuttered, and the two make a potent couple, even if the casting closes the generation gap that figures in the book.)
Tessa's death opens The Constant Gardener . Why she died (with damning information about multinational drug malfeasance in her possession) propels the plot, as Justin awakens from his complacency to understand the posthumous truth about her real work, and, poignantly, about their own marriage. Meirelles, meanwhile, brightens the author's wide, dark field with rich color, adding his own distinctive cinematic feel for the desperation, as well as the vibrancy, of the global underclass. Maturing the grabby style of hip-hoppy energy and visual fillips he brought to City of God (where he featured Rio de Janeiro as something between a circle of hell and a really cool setting for a music video), the Oscar-nominated Brazilian filmmaker shoots the landscape of Kenya, slums and magnificent wild territory, children and birds, with a new flow.
There's less superfluous ''art'' now, more concentration of purpose from frequent collaborator César Charlone's voluptuous cinematography. Now the shots don't waste time saying, Look at me; instead they urge, Look, look at what is really happening to millions of Africans as disease ruthlessly spreads, fertilized by a toxic mixture of corporate and governmental dither and greed. Working from an unobtrusive screenplay by British TV scripter Jeffrey Caine, Meirelles makes his points convincingly, teasing out the secrets of weak and bullying men (among the limpest of whom are Justin's unreliable friend and diplomatic colleague, played by Danny Huston, and their frighteningly Perfect British Boss, played with high gloss by Bill Nighy), but never squanders attention away from the tragedy of epidemic disease and corruption. (Playing the opposite of limp, the ever-excellent Gerard McSorley from Bloody Sunday  embodies a paragon of corporate thuggishness who's never more terrifying than when he's on the golf course.)
There is, I realize, always the chance that such a serious, it's-good-for-you description makes The Constant Gardener  sound like a lemonade glass of medicine. It's not. The movie is smart, serious, and adult about something that matters, but not at the expense of a kind of awful, sensual revelry as le Carré's capacious plot hurtles to its big finish. In flashback scenes of Justin and Tessa's life together, the chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz (previously paired in the tortured István Szabó film Sunshine ) feels  playfully sexy, which is not something I'd usually ascribe to Fiennes' default stance of proud hurt. Borne on lilting snatches of African song, The Constant Gardener  gives a damn while giving good ''entertainment.'' P.S.: ''By comparison with the reality,'' le Carré explains in notes on the film, ''my story was as tame as a holiday postcard.''
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Supporting Actress (Rachel Weisz); Best Adapted Screenplay (Jeffrey Caine); Best Film Editing; Best Original Score (Alberto Iglesias)


If Bob Geldof were a film director, he would undoubtedly aspire to make a movie very much like "The Constant Gardener." Topically urgent and ripe with outrage over injustices visited upon the African poor, Fernando Meirelles' screen version of John le Carre's incisive novel succeeds in capturing the book's essential themes and concerns, albeit in a hectic style that could not be more antithetical to that of the literary master of international intrigue. By opening the film domestically Aug. 31, prior to the September wave of top tier festivals, Focus Features, backed by undoubted critical support, should succeed in establishing this high-minded, well-cast drama as the first significant specialized attraction of the fall.

Although untempered anger seethes from all 560 pages of le Carre's best-selling 2001 novel, it is channeled by the author's acute ability to release it in precisely modulated quantities through the cracks in his characters' fastidiously rendered British diplomatese. Le Carre uses the sharpest of scalpels in performing a comprehensive sociopolitical autopsy on the remains of a murdered young woman whose provocative discoveries threatened to explode the hypocrisies, lax ethics, betrayals and assorted other ills of international pharmaceutical giants and government bureaucracies -- Western and African -- that support the use of Third World populations as guinea pigs.
Meirelles, working from a script by Jeffrey Caine, has managed to arrive at basically the same destination as le Carre, but via a very different artistic road. Employing the same helter-skelter style that brought vibrant immediacy to his international hit "City of God," on which Meirelles collaborated with Katia Lund, helmer employs in-your-face camerawork to bring the Kenyan locations intensely alive; at the same time, the rapid-fire approach is nothing like a visual correlative of the elegant relentlessness of the author's style. 
Simply put, this film will probably not suit the tastes of fans who considered the sublimely nuanced miniseries "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy," "Smiley's People" and "A Perfect Spy" the ne plus ultra
 of le Carre screen adaptations, but will likely please younger, less classically minded auds just fine.
In this telling of the powerful tale of a mild-mannered, middle-level English diplomat who falls more deeply in love with his wife as he stealthily searches for the truth about her life and death, the pic sacrifices emotional connection at the altar of political expose. With the instincts of a muckraker, Meirelles tilts "The Constant Gardener" in the direction of a docu-drama, which gives the "revelations" of corporate greed and corruption modest but important priority in the overall shape of things.
Ralph Fiennes does some of his finest screen acting right off the bat with his quivering but controlled reaction to news of his wife's apparent death. Pic wisely retains le Carre's cinematically non-linear narrative structure, which adroitly delivers the backstory of the relationship between middle-aged old-school diplomat Justin Quayle (Fiennes) and his live-wire younger wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz), just as it delineates Justin's increasingly perilous search into the whys and wherefores of her murder.
Thus, the couple's first round of joyful sex just after they meet in London is juxtaposed with Justin's identifying her body after it has been found in a remote part of the country. As the story's strands are extended in impressionistic, from-the-hip style, the portrait emerges of an emotionally contained rep of Her Majesty's Government whose impassioned mate becomes a loose canon once she observes first-hand how new drugs are being used and tested on unknowing Kenyans, some of whom die as a result.
The thicket of corruption, both complicit and implicit, active and passive, runs the gamut of the administrative, business and medical communities. It is the mandate of the British High Commission in Nairobi to foster economic opportunities for Brits, hence the wide path cleared for thuggish but knighted tycoon Sir Kenneth Curtiss (a terrifically vulgar Gerard McSorley), who looks to enlarge his fortune with the wonder-drug Dypraxa, whichhas not been approved in the West.
When Tessa, who has lost her own baby in childbirth, witnesses the withering away of an African woman who has taken the drug, she relentlessly campaigns to expose the dangers of Dypraxa and the layers of malfeasance that foster its use. It's an effort in which she is joined by a sharp young African man, Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kounde), with whom she is widely assumed to be conducting an affair and who is initially blamed for her murder.
Upholding the status quo of understated decorum and hidden white mischief are, among others, acting head of the High Commission Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), aging spy Tim Donohue (Donald Sumpter) and their Foreign Office boss Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy), all of whom are rightly alarmed by Tessa's bulldozing confrontationalism and, after her death, are forced to deal in their own ways to Justin's taking up her torch.
Justin's journey first takes him to London, where he meets with Ham (an excellent Richard McCabe), Tessa's effusive and crucially helpful cousin. A subsequent luncheon with Pellegrin makes for one of the film's best scenes; the exclusive club setting forces Meirelles' camera to sit down with the characters and allow le Carre's terrific skill at ever-intensifying one-on-one dialogue exchanges to flourish onscreen.
Posing as a journalist in increasingly intrepid mode, Justin travels to Germany, where he obtains crucial information and is beaten to within an inch of his life. Now as undaunted as his late wife, he returns to Kenya to confront those he's concluded were most directly responsible for Tessa's death, then on to a besieged village in southern Sudan where he believes he will find both his own heart of darkness and release.
Thesping is first-rate, even though they sometimes seem to be fighting an uphill battle not to be upstaged by the backgrounds Meirelles obviously finds so enthralling. Fiennes is ideal as the ineffably polite diplomat who only after his wife's death can fulfill his own potential for love and passion for a cause. Weisz equally seems to have stepped straight from the pages of the book onto the screen, as she fully embodies the driven, lusty, unstoppable Tessa.
Nighy keeps his customary wild streak in check to register memorably as the guardian of the gate for the diplomatic corps, and Pete Postlethwaite socks over his crucial role as the mystery man Justin eventually must track down. Huston somewhat overdoes the sinister aspects of a diplomat who tries to conceal the depth of his involvement in the case. 
Despite the book's ferocious criticism of Kenyan government corruption (the specifics of which are significantly reduced in the film), to its credit, the nation's administration approved shooting there, and Meirelles has gone all out to portray the country in close-up, from the exclusive digs of its foreign compounds to the stupefying squalor of the Kibera shantytown. With lenser Cesar Charlone and production designer Mark Tildesley leading a production crew that reps Kenya as both striking and squalid, pic takes full advantage of its location and roving camera. 
Claire Simpson's cutting, which in its persistent use of visual shorthand recalls her background with Oliver Stone, facilitates the telling of a complex tale in a reasonable length of time, while Alberto Iglesias' score blends with select outside tracks to offbeat, understated effect. 
End credits note location shooting in Manitoba, but Canadian scenes didn't make the final cut.

Drawing on the John le Carré  reservoir guarantees a face-smacking degree of literate sophistication, pander-free dialogue, and ethical ambiguity, and Fernando Meirelles 's adaptation of The Constant Gardener  drinks deeply at the trough. For an English-language movie with recognizable stars, its measure of social maturity can be startling, but it's also a bristling demonstration of the formal difficulty of liberal narrative, and of ambitious third-world tourist-cinema. When does the rapturous filming of, and gazing upon, poverty become capitalization, and class shame become entertainment?
It helps that The Constant Gardener  is itself concerned with the profound discomfort of postcolonial activity in Africa. Even well-intended white interventions raise more questions about responsibility and conscience than they answer; le Carré is peerlessly adept at rephrasing those questions in fictional terms. This isn't lost on Meirelles, whose Miramax  moneymaker City of God  has been both revered and slammed for its pow-whiz-splat pyrotechnics but which also maintained the maze-like plotting of its source novel. A master of offbeat compositions, Meirelles cannot help overheating his Avid, and the new film has City of God 's Tourette's-esque editing strategy. For its first third or so, The Constant Gardener  bops between now and then, joy and grief. Now, Justin Quayle  (Ralph Fiennes ), a shy, low-rung British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist in Kenya , learns that his activist wife was found dead on the veld; then, Quayle meets outspoken lefty Tessa (Rachel Weisz ) in London, falls in love, and decides at her prodding to take her back with him to Africa.
Thus embarking reticently on the search for Tessa's killer, Quayle is gang-slammed into a character arcfrom complacent, make-no-waves Englishman to off-the-radar avenging angelthat is just one of the tired ideas the movie makes utterly convincing and involving. Fiennes is clearly both the beneficiary of an insightfully written character and the film's big gun; underplaying Quayle all the way to the edge of civilization, he never lets the character's natural, quiet desperation get buried beneath the dramatics.
What Quayle soon runs up against is Big Pharma, exercising its very real muscle in both ignoring the easily treated diseases of the third world and using its "disposable" populations for off-the-books R&D. The fictional version of this genuine global calamity is one of The Constant Gardener 's jabs that fall shortthe particulars, in a movie river-running with on-location details, aren't terribly sensible. (Hitchcock may've maintained that macguffins are irrelevant, but his films never addressed political horror.) If the pharmaceutical industryroutinely crossing the finishing line as the most profitable in the U.S.should be excoriated, it is for the ratio of its monstrous revenues to the paltry medical support it provides to third- world countries. Focusing on other, smaller conspiracies seems irrational. Indeed, le Carré agrees: His postscript statement on the credits realizes that "by comparison with the reality [of the 'pharmaceutical jungle'], my story was as tame as a holiday postcard."
But perhaps the more basic kvetch to make is about Meirelles's style, a cannonballing mélange of hack-cuts, impressionistic close-ups, and tropical swelter. City of God  had a racy, comic-book persona to rev up, but le Carré's story is a sober odyssey. I wouldn't call The Constant Gardener  exploitative, even if it does exploit our grateful distance as viewers from the vast Kenyan slum of Kibera, and cinematographer César Charlone 's irradiated images of wholesale destitution. But look to films made by Africans, and none of them indulge in this sensationalized, sun-scorched hyperbole. A middle-classer from Rio, Meirelles is just as dedicated to pounding home a lurid idea of dangerous African otherness as any commercial Brit filmmakerRidley Scott , say, or Richard Attenborough .
I can't hold much of a grudge in any case, because although le Carré's story may seem predictable and unduly focused on the plight of a pale, wealthy Old Worlder adrift in a sea of needy East Africans, the movie's human material is masterfully manipulated. With the exception of Danny Huston casting directors, wake upsporting a freshman-theater-major BBC  accent, the cast lives in full four dimensions, seamlessly invoking offscreen pasts and between-the-scenes lives. Attaining credibility in your rendition of romantic intimacy is no small matter; neither are Weisz's natural warmth, throaty laugh, and eye-poppingly believable pregnancy prosthetic. Even Bill Nighy , as a mendacious British High Commission  VIP, manages to be both viciously wry and absolutely authentic.
For all of its earnest political self- pickling, The Constant Gardener  has the bite and fiber of a college-educated-adult experience, a fact that distinguishes it in the Harry Potter  Era. If it's to be taken as evidence as well as critique of postcolonialism's double-cutting blade, so be it.
