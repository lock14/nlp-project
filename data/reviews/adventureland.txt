Amazingly, Adventureland
 is only the third feature film on talented director Mottola�s r�sum�. In the intervening years since 1996 � when he debuted as a writer-director with Daytrippers
, a comic gem of family frustration and unity � Mottola completed an array of TV assignments, many of them for the new century�s rising comedy kingpin, Judd Apatow. It would still be years before his work on Apatow�s Undeclared
 landed Mottola in position to direct 2007�s  megalaugher Superbad
, which was produced by Apatow and scripted by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Now back as a writer and director, Mottola delivers a movie that is closer in comedic spirit to the sweet and soulful Daytrippers
 than to the rad and raunchy Superbad
, although all three films share an affinity for single compound-word titles. In Adventureland
, Mottola�s comic facility is on display: More than delivering assured punch lines, the filmmaker sustains the lighthearted atmosphere through steady character development, studious period detail, and narrative integrity. It�s a story about the summer that changed a young man�s life, the type that�s both been overtold yet is still full of potential. For James Brennan (Eisenberg, best known as the older brother in The Squid and the Whale
), the summer begins when his plans for a trip to Europe between the end of college and the start of graduate school are scuttled when his parents� economic shortfall forces him to return home to Pennsylvania and take a job to save money for the start of the fall semester. Specializing in Renaissance studies, James jokes that unless somebody needs a fresco painted, there�s no work out there for which he�s qualified. Despairing of his prospects, he accepts a job at the semidilapidated local amusement park of the film title. Adventureland
 is set in the summer of 1987, but rather than giving the film a dated feel, the period placement automatically makes Adventureland
 a kindred spirit to such Eighties teen-on-the-verge-of-adulthood comedies as Risky Business
 and Fast Times at Ridgemont High
. Plus, placing the film in the past may also allow the audience for this R-rated film to more easily relate the story to the crummy work experiences of its own youth. You also get the sense that you�re in good hands as the Velvet Underground�s �Here She Comes Now� plays over the opening credits and Eighties-appropriate music plays on the soundtrack (the Replacements, H�sker D�, the annoying loop of �Rock Me Amadeus� that plays nonstop at the amusement park, and additional music contributions from Yo La Tengo). The plentiful music references become part of the plot as they create connections that bind (or distance) the characters to (or from) one another. The supporting characters are all given their due (among them Starr as the amusement park�s gloomy Gogol scholar, Hader and Wiig as the daffy couple who manage the park, and Reynolds as the older ride repairman who gets girls with his claim to having once jammed with Lou Reed), while James� primary focus turns to the troubled Em (Stewart, who filmed this before her Twilight
 superstardom). Adventureland
 is a confident return to the kind of teen comedy that�s funny without being raunchy, youthful without being juvenile, and reflective without hitting you over the head with anything heavier than an amusement-park Whac-a-Mole mallet. (See "Lucky Starr
," April 3, for an interview with Martin Starr.)


The 2007 film "Superbad" is remembered as many things  - funny, sweet, obnoxious, lucrative. One thing it isn't remembered for, despite what the credits say, is being a Greg Mottola movie. Seth Rogen co-wrote it, and Judd Apatow produced it. As such, the film tends to get lumped in with all things Apatow. Like every director in the Apatow fraternity, Mottola was more a traffic cop, making sure the physical and hormonal chaos didn't kill anybody. The sensibility (crude, schlubby, cuddly) was Apatow's.
The film "Adventureland" means to provide a clearer sense of what "A film by Greg Mottola" means. But the forecast is "hazy with a chance of cute." It's the sort of flavorless, willfully quirky, occasionally amusing slice of suburban boredom that, for years, has given the Sundance Film Festival its soft, gooey center.
The film is set in Pennsylvania in 1987 and revolves around James (Jesse Eisenberg), a stammering, inexorably bright recent college graduate bound for Columbia University's writing program. He says he wants to write travel books as Charles Dickens did. A trip to Europe is in the offing. But his parents' sour finances leave him stuck with a job operating the games at an Adventureland amusement park managed by the sort of one-dimensional nonsense couple you'd expect Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, of "Saturday Night Live," to play.
James's awkwardness and ambivalence informs the rest of the movie's tone. Eisenberg has Albert Brooks's sense of intellectual superiority and certain young people's social insecurity. The movie puts both to the most banal ends. James finds himself caught between two of the most nubile girls on the park's payroll. Emily (Kristen Stewart) works in the games department with him. Lisa P (Margarita Levieva) is the little red Corvette of the staff. In case you missed that: Lisa P works in rides.
Stewart and Levieva represent two competing types of sexuality, indirect versus indiscreet. Stewart supplies another movie with the forlorn lust that made sense in "Twilight." The 1980s setting suits Levieva here. What Lisa P knows about carnality she appears to have learned from Whitesnake music videos. Things are complicated by the news that Emily, whom James prefers, has been having an affair with the park's hunky, older married mechanic, played by Ryan Reynolds. James is the last to know.
Mottola looses some interest ing people on the action  - a cocky kid named Pete (Dan Bittner) and his socially confused sister Sue (Paige Howard), who looks older than everybody and stops hooking up with James's new friend Joel (Martin Starr) because he's Jewish; an over-caffeinated weirdo played by Matt Bush, who's so funny in those AT&T family-plan ads. Why didn't Mottola build the movie around them?
Some characters can't even see what's in front of their eyes. Lisa P's introduction comes with a marvelous speech from Joel about the aesthetics of her backside. But it's her inexplicably silent black friend Kelly (Kimisha Renee Davis) whose apple bottom fits Joel's description to a tee. How could someone with such a fatal attraction to beautiful butts not notice hers? The movie is colorblind, but body-dumb.
I much prefer last year's "Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist" to what's going on here. That film had its imperfections, but it plunged into the here and now of being young and alive and drunk and horny and confused. You could feel the crackle of energy that's missing from "Adventureland," which tries making emotional noise. Yet so much of it is so deadpan and self-consciously arch; it lazily coasts the surface of nostalgia.
In an interview from 2007, Mottola described "Adventureland," which he planned to make after "Superbad," as "indie comedy." That description epitomizes what's wrong with both his movie and most so-called indie comedies, from "Napoleon Dynamite" to "Juno," movies that neutralize life with comedy as opposed to looking for the comedy in life. Race is made safe. Sex is made safe. Feelings are neat and simple. There are no appreciable politics. The soundtracks are always excellent, and everybody is uncomfortably cool. Their hearts, minds, and souls are coated with Teflon.
These are movies that aspire more to mediocre television than to films or moviemaking. As a sensibility, "indie" shouldn't be confused with the riskier, thornier ambitions of American independent cinema, which more than ever is being elbowed to outer regions of the distribution and exhibition process by vanishing studios, yes, but also by trendy niche marketing. "Adventureland" is harmless enough, but "indie comedy" sounds like something better seen at Urban Outfitters
 than at a movie theater.

For anyone making a youth nostalgia film, it's easy enough to nail the signifiers: the clothes and the cars, the great songs (or kitsch classics), the ''casual'' references to famous news events. What's harder to catch is the mood, the vibe, the aspects of an era we didn't even know were defining until the movie revealed them. Greg   Mottola's Adventureland  is set in Pennsylvania in 1987, and in form it's a sweetly traditional how-I-spent-my-summer-vacation romantic comedy, with Jesse Eisenberg as James Brennan, a sharp-witted, nervously sincere young man who fills up the months before he enters Columbia graduate school by working at a run-down amusement park. The place is called Adventureland (it's anything but), and once James is ensconced there, he hangs out all day long, listening to endless replays of ''Rock Me Amadeus'' as he hands out stuffed animals to lucky prizewinners and gets to know the other kids who are toiling away at this seedy wage-slave carnival. The jobs are crap, but they're all in it together, and they become friends.
So far, so conventional, except that Mottola, the director of Superbad , works with rare feeling and flow. He shows every bit as loving and pinpoint-perfect an observational eye for the late '80s as George Lucas did for the end of the greaser era in American Graffiti  and Richard Linklater did for the free-ride '70s in Dazed and Confused . The movie looks as if it was shot in the Reagan era, with a darkly grubby low-tech surface, and part of its   gentle magic is that Mottola knows how to bury his period references deep inside the attitudes that first enveloped them. The playing of once-nifty, now-ancient videogames is accompanied by much mock wow!  chatter at their battlestar awesomeness, and when the park's resident hottie, the swaggering Lisa P.  (Margarita Levieva), shows up, we can see that she's modeled her entire look and boy-toy 'tude on Madonna, yet the pop star herself is never mentioned. Joel (Martin Starr), the morosely ironic literate loser of the bunch, would have been the purest of nerds in an earlier era, only now he's an indie  nerd who tries to be a bit cool by declaring how uncool he is, and by smoking a pipe.
The '80s, at least at the time,  appeared drenched in irony, in the jadedness of a generation whose members, schooled on John Hughes and MTV, had grown compulsive about status and image and occupying their prescribed roles. It's Mottola's funny and touching inspiration to look back and see how un self-conscious the decade now seems, from the vantage of the ''Whatever!''/Twitter era. The characters don't even hook up  they make out. And talk  about making out. How innocent can you get?
Eisenberg, all grown up from The Squid and the Whale , is gangly and handsome now, but he plays James with his head slumped like a turtle (to let us know the guy doesn't realize that he's attractive), and with a percussive, head-shaking stammer that still has a note of Woody Allen in it. James is a virgin, chivalrous to a fault, and too sincere for his own good  which is what's desperate about him, and winning, too. He's still trying to figure out what his own role is. Whereas Em (Kristen Stewart), the flashing-eyed girl he befriends and starts to date (sort of), is all too good at projecting an image. She knows how to hide her troubles, of which she has plenty. Stewart, as she proved in Twilight , has a cutting sharpness that draws you right to her pale, severe beauty. She makes Em just the kind of good-bad girl a lamb like James needs to set himself free.
There are many stray pleasures in   Adventureland , from Bill Hader's hilarious turn as the dumb cluck who runs the park to Ryan Reynolds' seen-it-all cool as the mechanic and resident stud who's a lot more vulnerable than he looks. And when it comes to those soundtrack gems, Mottola has perfect pitch: He makes splendid use of Crowded House's ''Don't Dream It's Over'' for its melancholy rapture, Shannon's ''Let the Music Play'' for its exhilarating throb and crunch, and a dozen others that will have you wistful for melodies you may not have even loved at the time. That said, there's a slightly predictable mildness to the movie's storytelling. Adventureland  doesn't quite soar—it lopes along affectionately. But for nostalgia junkies, it's one from the heart. A–

 It’s the summer of 1987. The stock market crash is a few months off, but for James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) things have already taken a recessionary turn. His father (Jack Gilpin), a wilted, weak-chinned alcoholic, has been demoted, and the resulting financial pinch puts the kibosh on James’s rather modest postcollegiate dream of a summer in Europe followed by graduate school at Columbia. (His sights were set on journalism school, and given what his midcareer, 40-something self would be facing two decades later, it’s probably just as well he didn’t go.)  Anyway, like so many other members of a generation unfairly stigmatized at the time as slackers, James moves back in with Dad and Mom (Wendie Malick), who live in standard suburban discomfort in western Pennsylvania. Finding that a B.A. in comparative literature qualifies him for fairly little in the way of paid work, James takes a position manning the midway games at Adventureland, a sad little amusement park that serves as the employer of last resort for the area’s misfit young.  Apart from a certain gangly, nerdy charm — Mr. Eisenberg’s stock in trade, already evident in “Roger Dodger” and “The Squid and the Whale”  — James doesn’t have much in the way of assets: his virginity, a bag of joints (courtesy of a preppy college pal) and a bookish naïveté, all of which you can be sure he will be rid of by the time “Adventureland” is over.  The film, written and directed by Greg Mottola (“The Daytrippers,” “Superbad”), plants its flag in thoroughly explored territory, but that familiarity turns out to be integral to its loose and scruffy appeal. Somehow the story of a young man’s coming of age never gets old, at least when it is told with the kind of sweetness and intelligence “Adventureland” displays.  The engine that drives most film comedy these days is the male flight from maturity. John Updike famously observed that an American man is “a failed boy.” The endless parade of movies that bear the name or show the influence of Judd Apatow (a producer of “Superbad”) blunts the tragic implication of that claim by insisting that a man is a successful boy, who gets to keep his toys and his pals even as he acquires the benefits and obligations of heterosexual monogamy. The humor in these comedies is based on various forms of sexual unease, in particular a jokey, half-panicky homoeroticism complemented by a semiterrified  fascination with those oddly shaped, emotionally inscrutable creatures known as women.  The cast of “Adventureland” includes a few members of the Apatow stock company (notably Bill Hader as one of the park’s owners and Martin Starr as a nebbishy colleague of James’s with a fondness for Gogol). But in spite of this family resemblance, Mr. Mottola’s film is a relatively sober and cerebral affair, more akin to Richard Linklater’s “Dazed and Confused” than to “Knocked Up” or “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.”  It’s not just that James is an intellectual with a literary bent that suggests a latter-day Woody Allen or Philip Roth hero. It’s more that his innocence expresses itself less as an anxious mystification of women and sex than as a romantic idealization of (gulp) love.  No sooner has James started at Adventureland than he is smitten — as what literature major worth his Rilke would not be? — with Em, a moody, leggy N.Y.U. student played by Kristen Stewart. Em is secretly involved with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), an older, married maintenance man who impresses his younger co-workers, male and female alike, with transparently bogus tales of hobnobbing with famous musicians. “Did you know he jammed with Lou Reed?” Back in the ’80s, wherever you went, there was always some guy hanging around who had jammed with Lou Reed, even if Lou Reed never was much for jamming.  But the drop of Mr. Reed’s name allows “Adventureland” to make heartfelt use of “Satellite of Love,” one of his loveliest songs and part of a soundtrack that runs the gamut of more or less period-appropriate sounds, from the sublimity of Hüsker Dü to the ridiculousness of a bar band covering Foreigner. Otherwise Mr. Mottola is careful not to fetishize or lampoon the 1980s with silly hairdos or too-obvious topical references.  Nor does he lean too heavily on the central romantic plot, allowing the film, true to its season of idleness and drift, to meander from one thing to another. There is some exemplary silliness from Mr. Hader and the peerless Kristen Wiig, who plays his character’s wife and business partner, but the jokes tend to be sly rather than broad, and Mr. Mottola never sacrifices tenderness of feeling for a cheap laugh. Minor characters who might have been mean, tossed-off caricatures — like the theme-park bombshell known as Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva) — are endowed with the capacity to change and surprise, almost as if they were the protagonists of their own movies.  “Adventureland” sometimes seems to lose track of just which movie it is, and its sprawling narrative encompasses some soft spots and patches of inconsistency. The worst of these comes near the end, with a failure of compassion on James’s part that seems to owe more to the demands of the plot than the logic of the character. And at times Mr. Mottola lays on the suburban adolescent malaise with too heavy a hand.  Over all, though, the smart, slightly depressive vibe feels just right — for James’s era and for our own as well. The path to adulthood is lined with disappointment, but for a young man with an open heart and a measure of self-confidence, to say nothing of a degree in comp lit, things will most likely be O.K.    “Adventureland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A little sex and a lot of pot smoking. Ah yes, the ’80s.

Arriving with what prove to be outsized expectations for raucous humor on the basis of "Superbad," Greg Mottola's "Adventureland" unspools as a rather ordinary account of youthful summer misadventures that goes down easily thanks to a sparky cast, more than 40 pop tunes that anchor the action in the late '80s and characters who get high both on and off their jobs at a tacky amusement park. Thanks especially to the presence of leading lady Kristen Stewart in a role she filmed prior to "Twilight," the pic should spin good returns for Miramax on its March 27 release.
Based on experiences he had working at a Long Island amusement park, Mottola cooks up a passable amount of mischief to occupy the late-teen/early-20s misfits who work as ride and game operators at Pittsburgh's Adventureland in the summer of '87. Writer-director's evident stand-in is James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg of "The Squid and the Whale"), who's forced to take any summer job he can get when his European trip is dashed and his autumn date with grad school at Columbia is jeopardized by his alcoholic father's fall from grace at work.
For a Reagan-era pothead, James is a terribly serious, woefully earnest guy who offers up his SAT scores when applying for low-end summer positions. He also somehow has emerged from college still a virgin, but his saving grace as far as his Adventureland cohorts are concerned is that he's always got some weed. This makes the days go by easier, and also fuels the nights, which the gawky James surprises himself by sometimes chastely spending with the alluring but massively screwed up Em (Stewart), who works at the park only as a way of getting away from her father and unbearable new stepmother.
What James doesn't know is that Em is having a clandestine affair with older local musician and handyman Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), to whom James sometimes confesses his amorous feelings for Em. Adding further to the equation is a flirty cupcake named Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), a known virgin-for-life who nonetheless encourages James' attentions.
The set-up provides plenty of opportunity for crude humor, which Mottola indulges with abundant gags involving puking, crotch punches, drunk and stoned behavior and lax work habits. But his real interest is the navigation of dubious emotional and ethical straits by immature characters who make serious mistakes while trying to feel their way out of their unhappiness.
The filmmaker's investment in James' sudden loss of a safety net, Em's justifiable distress at home and brainy stoner Joel's (Martin Starr) fury over a one-time date's anti-Semitism is genuine as far as it goes, but little that happens here is particularly surprising, especially the occurrence of some virginity divestment at the end.
Rather offputting at first with his furrowed-brow attitude, Eisenberg's James becomes increasingly palatable as the summer progresses. Stewart impresses again with her steady, clear-eyed gaze and sense of self. Nice comic turns are put in by Starr as the Gogol-reading outcast and Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the goofball but dedicated park owners.
With the exception of the extensive song track, tech contributions are just OK.

Set a mere two decades ago, Greg Mottola 's Adventureland  seems as if it could be taking place on a distant planet, less for the leg warmers and kneesocks clinging to lower extremities than for the legions of pre-Internet Luddites who gather, like the apes at the start of 2001 , to participate in those analog rituals known as Skee-Ball and Whac-A-Mole. Drawn from Mottola's own experiences working at a ramshackle suburban amusement park, Adventureland  feels at once personal and generational, a Proustian madeleine for anyone who rode the roller coaster of post-adolescence while Iran -Contra was in prime time and Wang Chung on the radio—which, I suppose, makes it more like a Proustian Astro Pop.
The year is 1987, and the place is the titular, mom-and-pop Pittsburgh  fun zone, where a gaggle of college students and recent grads languidly pass the summer while planning for bigger lives in bigger cities. Self-serious aspiring travel writer James (Jesse Eisenberg ) was supposed to be seeing the world, but Reaganomics trickled down to his newly demoted father, putting the kibosh on Europe (and possibly Columbia journalism school) and forcing James into the only summer job he could find. Even then, he's quickly pegged by Adventureland's proprietors (Bill Hader  and Kristen Wiig ) as a "Games" guy—which, in the park's comical caste system, is the domain of intellectuals, introverts, and anyone else deemed unworthy of those bronzed gods and goddesses known as Ride Operators. Floating above all of this, as if in his own private aerie, is maintenance man Connell (Ryan Reynolds )—slightly older than the rest, with a carefully honed aura of Top Gun  chic, a self-perpetuating legend that he once jammed with Lou Reed , and a reputation, despite the wedding band on his finger, of being the park's resident lothario.
James learns the Adventureland ropes from Joel (Martin Starr ), the pipe-smoking, Plato -quoting Games guru who, in a hilariously misguided romantic overture, gives a chaste Catholic co-worker a copy of Nikolai Gogol 's The Overcoat  as a token of his affection, insisting on the tormented Russian author's merits even after enduring her rejection. James, meanwhile, takes a more conventional approach to his courtship of arcade worker Em (Kristen Stewart ), despite telling her up-front that he's a 22-year-old virgin and later borrowing a few too many moves from his main man Connell's playbook. Thus, Games guy meets Games girl; gradually comes into a new self-confidence; nearly blows the good thing he has by succumbing to the temptations of a gum-chewing, bra-strap-baring Rides vixen; and tries to put things right again, only to discover that betrayal is a two-way street.
Undeniably, Adventureland  traffics in certain, perhaps inevitable clichés that have attended teen and twentysomething relationship movies since time (or at least John Hughes ) immemorial. But, as he previously demonstrated in 2007's Superbad , Mottola cuts so swiftly to the underlying truth of those clichés—to the euphoria and pain of youthful rites of passage—that he leaves most other movies on the subject looking especially plastic and shallow. In its mellower, more melancholic tone, however, Adventureland  even more strongly recalls Mottola's superb, Slamdance-winning debut, The Daytrippers  (1996), which followed a bickering Long Island  family on a darkly farcical car ride into Manhattan.
The constant in Mottola's work is his marvelous hand with actors, inspiring them to invest the most minor or familiar of characters with a nuanced inner life that goes beyond what's on the page. In Adventureland , that's particularly true of Stewart, who taps into an emotional reservoir that her role in the teen vampire behemoth Twilight  neither demanded nor revealed, giving Em the quiet sadness of someone who, in her early twenties, has already suffered a lifetime's worth of disappointments. So, too, does the consistently resourceful, intelligent Reynolds manage, in a few fleeting appearances, to make an almost tragic figure out of his potentially sleazy, slacker Don Juan . Like all of the ostensible adults in the film—from Em's ineffectual father and status-seeking stepmother to Hader and Wiig's Adventureland lifers—Connell may be older, but he isn't necessarily any wiser about the peculiar alchemy of finding one's place in the world.
By the standards of Mottola's previous films, both of which unfolded over the course of a single day, the season-spanning Adventureland  is practically an epic, but one in which Mottola sacrifices none of his romantic poet's affection for the fleeting, ephemeral moment. Here, no detail is too small to be glazed with the amber of memory, least of all whatever happened to be playing on the radio (or MTV ) when you made out with a girl, got your heart broken, or forgave a friend. To that end, Mottola and music supervisor Tracy McKnight  have mined their collective unconscious for more than 40 period songs that capture the '80s in all its musical permutations—hair metal (Whitesnake 's "Here I Go Again"), new wave pop (Falco's "Rock Me Amadeus"), punk (New York Dolls ' "Looking for a Kiss"), and everything else we had no choice but to listen to before iPods  let us hyper-personalize the soundtracks of our lives. I've seen Mottola's movie twice, and both times, it has inspired feelings of joy, sadness, and a profound yearning for the unrecoverable past. Maybe I'm projecting too much false nostalgia onto this modest but poignant Gen-X touchstone, if not the '80s themselves. Or maybe, you just had to be there.
