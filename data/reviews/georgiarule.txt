Despite the presence of three acting powerhouses � Fonda, Huffman, and Lohan � this movie about three generations of "difficult" women never rings true. It's a dramedy whose blend of melodrama and humor is awkward and incongruous, leaping between the two modes like a fat frog jumping lily pads. The performances are all excellent, but the screenplay by Mark Andrus (As Good as It Gets
 and Life as a House
) strands these characters with untenable personalities that veer between sympathetic and shrill with nary a missed beat. Lohan is cast as the willful teenager Rachel from San Francisco, whose alcoholic mother, Lilly (Huffman), and stepfather (Elwes) park her for the summer with her with her grandmother Georgia (Fonda) in a small Idaho town rife with Mormons. There's no love lost between Lilly and Georgia, whose life is governed by self-imposed dictates referred to as "Georgia rule." Rachel behaves like a Lohan clone, partying and misbehaving to such an extent that her exasperated family does not know what to do with her. (As you may recall, this is the movie that earned La Lohan a warning letter from the studio for her tardiness and other unprofessionalisms during the shoot.) Strutting around Hull, Idaho, in her oversized sunglasses, skimpy clothing, and stacked wedges, it's not long before Rachel has the largely Mormon town in a dither. She behaves like a brat, but then suddenly turns incomprehensibly sweet in a following scene. This repeatedly dichotomous behavior, we learn, is due to a dark secret that, of course, becomes exposed, and, in turn, throws the entire family into a dither. Yet, Rachel's mother and grandmother are as dramatically malleable as the girl. Georgia can in one instant yell at Rachel to go "fuck" herself, and in the next, wash her mouth out with soap for blaspheming. Lilly can drive all the way from San Francisco to Idaho in high heels and unwrinkled silk couture. Still, the three actresses have their moments and are usually enjoyable if not believable. Mulroney, Elwes, and Hedlund � the male eye candy � are no slouches either, and Fonda is surely the best-looking grandma on the planet. Director Marshall (Pretty Woman
, Runaway Bride
) usually has a surer hand with these kinds of happy-ending dramedy mash-ups, but films such as his execrable Exit to Eden
 and disappointing Raising Helen
 prove Marshall has his downside. With this film's top-notch acting ensemble, Georgia Rule
 has the sad taint of what might have been.


Is it possible to revoke a comeback? "Monster-in-Law " (2005 ) was a surprisingly retrograde farce for Jane Fonda to choose as her first film in 15 years, but at least it was professional and reasonably inoffensive. Oh, that the same could be said for "Georgia Rule ," the intergenerational-bonding chick flick that's the next item on Fonda's docket and a pox on her filmography.
Come to think of it, is it possible to revoke an entire adolescence? Lindsay Lohan had her share of tabloid bad-girl headlines during the filming of "Georgia," to the point where she was publicly spanked in a letter from the head of the film's production company. In retrospect, it's conceivable she was researching her role as Rachel , the big-city teenage car wreck stuck in an Idaho town. It's just as likely she got a look at the script and threw a diva fit.
For "Georgia Rule" is a bad idea dreadfully executed -- "On Golden Pond " with fellatio jokes and whimsical incest melodrama and Fonda playing her dad (who, more and more, she eerily resembles). For her and for Felicity Huffman , cast as the third side of the film's tortured grandmother/daughter/granddaughter triangle, the movie's merely a humiliation. For Lohan, it's something worse: hard evidence she can't act.
Well, of course she can act: Look at "Mean Girls " or, better, Robert Altman's "A Prairie Home Companion ," in which she was unexpectedly touching. As the hellacious brat of "Georgia Rule," though, Lohan's line readings are alternately flat and flip, and she slumps through the movie as though the party were elsewhere and she was stuck picking up her room. It's a performance of no thought or depth, as unfixed as the bizarre spray-on tan that seems to mutate from scene to scene.
Rachel is a 17-year-old wildcat who needs taming, so her harried mother, Lilly , ships her to the small town of Hull, Idaho , to live with her grand mother, the iron-willed Georgia. Georgia likes to set rules (thus the title) and she also washes your mouth out with soap if you take the Lord's name in vain. She's not above dropping the F-bomb, though, since the movie's keen to pander to both youth audiences and the family values crowd.
We've seen similar plotlines in "In Her Shoes " and other movies -- except here Rachel tosses her panties at every man in town (including the designated hot/sensitive veterinarian widower, played by Dermot Mulroney ), gives a local Mormon hunk (Garrett Hedlund ) oral sex in a dinghy, and reveals -- ta da! -- that she was sexually abused by her stepfather (Cary Elwes , looking appropriately mortified). Or maybe she's making that last part up.
By the way, if you were thinking about taking the kids? Don't.
Another young actress might have been able to hit the right notes of confusion and pain, of angry hormones cutting loose in every direction. Evan Rachel Wood , maybe. Heck, Mandy Moore. Lohan's performance, by contrast, is so superficial that you hate Rachel more at the end of the movie than you did at the start, and that can't be right.
For proof that some actresses can take on a misconceived role and get out alive, there's Huffman as Lilly, a booze-guzzling basket case who spends the last half of "Georgia Rule" in full-on nervous breakdown, judged and found wanting by both her mother and her daughter. The part's less believable than the transsexual she played in "Transamerica," but Huffman works hard to impart a similar humanity, even after the movie grinds her into the dirt.
She's defeated at every turn by Mark Andrus's overloaded screenplay -- heavy on the self-help chatter -- and the surprisingly shoddy direction of Garry Marshall. Why hire Marshall for such tricky material? Because when you think of realistic portrayals of young women coping with men's sexual demands, you think of the guy who gave us "Pretty Woman "?
Fonda? She's acting in a different movie, and for her sake I hope it's a better one. (Actually, she's doing late-era salty-spinster Katharine Hepburn, with a similar taste in scripts.) Georgia is offscreen for large amounts of time while Lilly and Rachel hash things out in one cringe-inducing scene after another; the issue of whether the daughter was in fact abused or not goes back and forth so many times that you finally cry uncle and stop caring.
In a weird way, that's impressive. It takes real time and effort to trivialize incest. "Georgia Rule" does it in just 113 minutes.


         When Georgia Randall (Jane Fonda), the titular matriarch of "Georgia Rule," learns that her smooth-talking son-in-law has blatantly misrepresented himself, she beats him with a baseball bat. If that is the new penalty for deception, then the Universal Pictures marketing team that has portrayed "Georgia Rule" as a sassy, feel-good, female-bonding picture would do well to invest in some protective gear.
 
 Don't be misled by its upbeat trailer or the supposedly reassuring presence of director Garry Marshall. Weighted down by too much disturbing material to work as a glossy, lighthearted comedy, yet dappled with too many broad comic moments to stand as a serious film, "Georgia Rule" oscillates clumsily from shock to slapstick to schmaltz. The result of these big tonal swings is a cinematic strikeout.
 


         






   Marshall ("Pretty Woman," "Runaway Bride," "The Princess Diaries") has made a specialty of comedy-inflected female transformation movies. In his modern Cinderella formula, the awkward or morally questionable heroine finds romance and redemption and is ultimately transformed into a princess, either literally or figuratively.
 
 On the surface, the setup for "Georgia Rule" seems to fit nicely into the Marshall paradigm. The maladjusted young Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is shipped off to Idaho and the tutelage of her grandmother (Fonda) while her self-absorbed mom, Lilly (Felicity Huffman), and stepdad Arnold (Cary Elwes) enjoy a frisky sex life in San Francisco.
 
 At the outset, the three women share nothing but their mutual dislike for one anoth-er.
 
 Strutting around fictitious Hull, Idaho, in her skinny jeans, four-inch heels and belly shirt, Lohan's Rachel is an exotic Lolita in a town populated by Mormon schoolgirls. She's Julia Roberts in boots and hot pants on Rodeo Drive in "Pretty Woman"; no one can do funny fish-out-of-water bits better than Marshall. (It's dream casting: Tabloid darling Lohan earned a harsh rebuke from Morgan Creek production company head James Robinson for unprofessional behavior during filming.)
 
 Yet the film runs into trouble when its darker elements come into play. When Rachel mentions to kindly veterinarian Simon Ward (Dermot Mulroney) that she was raped by her stepfather, it goes over like a lead balloon. The fact that Rachel is a chronic liar does not help matters.
 
 As her family members dig at the truth, Rachel changes her story.
 
 With a script by Mark Andrus that repeatedly references themes like child abuse and alcoholism, it's not long before Marshall is out of his depth. The director's most successful films rely on a combination of star quality, humor and audience wish fulfillment, with darker material relegated to the background. It's unlikely that "Pretty Woman" would have turned Roberts into America's sweetheart, for example, if it had been made as it was first written, a gritty tale about a coke-using hooker.
 
 Without the tools to handle such heavy material, Marshall falls back on broad comic strokes. When Lilly, a recovering alcoholic, returns to Idaho to confront Rachel about her allegations, she marinates herself in vodka. Her drinking binge leads to an ill-advised sequence in which Lilly finds herself half-naked on Georgia's front lawn.
 
 Though  there's nothing inherently wrong with using humor to lighten the mood, the sight of Huffman exposing herself to the neighbors feels like a cheap gag recycled from "Desperate Housewives." Ditto Rachel's attempt to seduce a naive young Mormon (Garrett Hedlund) and intimidate the local girls; if she was in fact molested, it seems wrong to use her promiscuity to generate laughs.
 
 It's a shame that "Georgia Rule" is so flat-footed, because Huffman, Fonda and Lohan are resourceful actresses, and they go to some lengths to wring credible emotion from their characters. It's remarkable how Fonda's brittle and intractable Georgia brings flashes of her father's Norman Thayer from "On Golden Pond," though one can't help thinking that she deserves better comeback vehicles than this and "Monster-in-Law."
 
 "Georgia Rule" is not without its other redeeming features, notably a well-observed slice of small-town Americana (actually Chatsworth), which is another Marshall trademark, and a judiciously laid soundtrack that never feels obtrusive. With a different tone — or in different hands — its dark and light elements might have managed to coexist rather than vie so awkwardly for attention.
 
 "Georgia Rule." MPAA rating: R for sexual content and some language. Running time: 1 hour, 53 minutes. In general release.   

Even in the age of kicked-up tabloid voyeurism, there is generally a firewall between the way a star behaves on screen and off. Take Lindsay Lohan, who is all perky, freckled sunshine in her movies, all wild-child hellion in the tabs. The firewall comes down, though, in Georgia Rule , a clunky family-therapy soaper, written by Mark Andrus and directed by Garry Marshall, that has the bad taste  or, maybe, the good commercial sense  to exploit Lohan's public image as a girl who just can't help it.
As Rachel, forced by her skittery, hard-drinking mom (Felicity Huffman) to spend the summer before college living with her scoldingly square grandmother (Jane Fonda) in small-town Idaho, Lohan parades her viper-on-a-diet body in billowy short skirts, with a spitfire temper to match. Rachel, a baby harlot and compulsive liar, uses sex as a weapon, and she's not above cruelty: When she's out with a handsome hippie boy who happens to be a Mormon, she practically ravishes him, but only because she gets off on the violation. (He spends the film's next hour apologizing to God.) Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism. Unfortunately, it's the only note the film allows her to play.
Leave it to Garry Marshall to make a feel-good movie about alcoholism, nymphomania, and possible child sexual abuse. When Rachel announces that her stepfather (Cary Elwes) began sleeping with her at the age of 12, we have no idea if she's telling the truth, and that uncertainty lurches the film back and forth: Did he or didn't he? Is she a victim or just a brat who longs to be loved? As Rachel's mom arrives and goes on a bender, acting out her hatred for her own  mother (yes, it's that kind of movie), Fonda's Georgia takes it all in with her cracked and tart-tongued Yankee nobility. Her puritanism is the family's original sin  though, in the end, it will save the day. Fonda runs with it, but deserves better than the role of a dowager who looks as if she'd like to police Golden Pond.

 “Georgia Rule,” in which Jane Fonda washes Lindsay Lohan’s mouth out with soap, might easily have been a tepid, sudsy puddle of easy sentiment and soft comedy. Three generations of women — Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan are Georgia and Rachel, grandmother and granddaughter, with Felicity Huffman in between them as Lilly, Georgia’s daughter and Rachel’s mom — fuss, fail to communicate and, in the end, forgive one another. Small-town values triumph over flashy, big-city California relativism, as happens exclusively (and frequently) in Hollywood movies. You’ve seen it all before.  Except that you haven’t quite. From the opening scene, which catches Ms. Huffman and Ms. Lohan bickering on a lonely stretch of road near the Idaho state line, “Georgia Rule,” directed by Garry Marshall from a script by Mark Andrus, swerves and spins, taking its predictable plot in some surprising directions. Working against its maudlin impulses with lively humor, and at the same time undercutting its laughs with some hard, ugly themes, this movie is neither a standard weepie nor a comforting dramedy. It’s an interesting, maddening mess — not a terrible movie, and by no means a dull one.  With “Pretty Woman” (1990),  Mr. Marshall pulled off the unlikely, somewhat distasteful feat of turning prostitution into a pretext for romantic bliss. If anything, this film pushes such incongruity even further, using the sexual abuse of a girl by her stepfather — a crime suspected, denied and affirmed in a dizzying series of reversals and revisions — as fodder for domestic farce as well as therapeutic melodrama. The man who brought us “Laverne and Shirley”  ventures into territory better suited to Todd Solondz or Lifetime, and, as you might imagine, he has some trouble finding a consistent and appropriate tone.  But the incoherence of the movie is a sign of life, evidence of an emotional energy percolating beneath the glib “very special episode” surface. The source of that vitality lies with the actors, and with Mr. Marshall’s inclination to give them space and time to explore their characters’ idiosyncrasies.  Ms. Huffman, playing uptight as easily as she plays drunk, does well with the least sympathetic of the three principal roles, that of a woman who must incarnate the worst attributes of filial rebellion and maternal rigidity. And Dermot Mulroney is quiet and wry as a small-town veterinarian who also treats human patients, and who serves as an all-purpose shoulder to cry on, in spite of his own grief.  But the movie really belongs to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan, actresses whose formidable skill is often underestimated and overshadowed by off-screen notoriety. Ms. Lohan in particular has been subjected recently to the prurient, punitive gaze of an Internet gossip culture that takes special delight in the humiliation of young women with shaky discipline and an appetite for fun.  The joke in “Georgia Rule” is that she is playing a version of her tabloid persona: a needy, reckless young woman whose self-confidence verges on self-destructive. The surprise is that she does it with such poise and intelligence. As written, Rachel is complicated to the point of contradiction: lost child, femme fatale, brainiac and brat squeezed into a series of short dresses. Somehow Ms. Lohan connects these disparate, clashing elements into a single convincing performance.  At the start of the movie, Rachel is on her way from San Francisco to Hull, Idaho, for a summer under the supervision of her grandmother. Georgia runs her own life (and everyone else’s) according to strict standards from which she tolerates little deviation. Ms. Fonda’s straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.  Rachel, similarly, evades easy caricature. She’s neither a tramp nor a victim. Her initial predatory interest in a local hunk named Harlan (Garrett Hedlund) turns chaste once she discovers his vulnerability. Her own is fairly evident, especially once she casually makes the accusation that Lilly’s husband, Arnold (Cary Elwes), a rich lawyer, molested her when she was younger.  This news is really too much for the movie to assimilate, especially given its generally lighthearted take on Rachel’s sexuality, but “Georgia Rule” is nonetheless trying to acknowledge the awful as well as the amusing dimensions of experience in a way that very few mainstream comedies would dare. It doesn’t succeed, but there is nonetheless something admirable and honest in the effort.  “Georgia Rule” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual references and situations and profanity. 

No offense to either of them, but �Georgia Rule� suggests an  Ingmar Bergman script as directed by Jerry Lewis. The subject matter is grim, the relationships are gnarled, the worldview is bleak, and, at any given moment, you suspect someone�s going to be hit with a pie. The presence of Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan and Felicity Huffman will target a wide demographic, but once word gets out about this misshapen Garry Marshall dramedy, it should be wending its way to a lonely afterlife on DVD.
Heralded for months by Lohan�s alleged, much-publicized misbehavior during the shoot, �Georgia Rule� finds the young star playing a character whose antics are her own calling card. Rachel, having driven her mother Lilly (Huffman) to exasperation, is deposited with her grandmother Georgia (Fonda) for the summer. Predictably, an education will be had, but exactly for and from whom is never entirely clear.
There�s no love lost among the three women. Rachel actively antagonizes Lilly, and Lilly clearly has issues with her mother � and it�s hard not to share them: Georgia, who justifies her often capricious edicts with the titular �Georgia rule!,� is a brittle woman whom Fonda imbues with all the warmth of a pit viper. What�s lacking in Georgia � or Fonda � is a sense of authority, something to make all the imperiousness believable. But very little about Georgia, Lilly or Rachel is believable, including the idea that they�re related.
And while director Marshall makes things awkward, it�s not the kind of awkward that tells the viewer much about the histories or temperaments of his characters.  Between Mark Andrus� disjointed script and the general poverty of direction, there�s little to keep the film from being more than a long series of emotional non sequiturs.
If this were some daffy, cross-generational comedy, the lack of plausibility wouldn�t seem so off-putting � no, make that offensive. But, Rachel has serious problems: One of the first things she does upon arriving in her grandma�s Idaho town is perform oral sex on local Mormon boy Harlan (Garrett Hedlund), totally confusing him (and us). She regularly hits on the nobly restrained veterinarian (Dermot Mulroney). And she claims to have been sexually assaulted by her stepfather (Cary Elwes), which explains her precocious sexuality and need for real affection. 
But it simply disqualifies the film as a comedy of any kind, making Marshall�s juxtaposition of smalltown quaintness and Lohan�s post-adolescent jiggle considerably more than distasteful. The film�s lampooning of Mormons (Harlan�s girlfriend has her friends spy on Rachel, which they do with vigor and insults) is just one more gratuitous affront.
Huffman goes through the film like a crash victim, which, considering all that her character endures, isn�t the worst technical choice. Lohan is fine, as usual, even if her character isn�t written particularly well. Fonda, though, is hard to watch, her apparent discomfort as a performer inseparable from Georgia�s discomfort with motherhood, grand or otherwise.
Marshall doesn�t do much to help her, but that problem is epidemic: The cinematography of Karl Walter Lindenlaub, whose fine work can be seen in the current �Black Book,� looks washed out. Music cues have the subtlety of alarm clocks. Production values are subpar. 


Three noisy women and a worn-out premise rattle around in Georgia Rule , an incoherent dramedy of rampant parental insufficiency from director Garry Marshall . Marshall's broad comedy has always made him a soft target for critics, but along with his duds (Runaway Bride  springs unbidden to mind), he's made a few charming women's pictures. Georgia Rule isn't one of them.
Earnest doesn't become Marshall, who has gleaned his notions about dysfunctional families from Oprah  and Dr. Phil . Rachel (Lindsay Lohan ), a wild teen who has sinned and lied about it one time too many times, is dispatched by her willfully myopic lush of a mother (Felicity Huffman ) to Idaho , where, it is hoped, she will undergo a character makeover at the hand of her rule-bound grandmother Georgia (Jane Fonda ) and a town of smiling Mormons. Notwithstanding her frequent invocation of the Almighty, Georgia gives as good as she gets, exhorting her grandchild to go fuck herself and stuffing soap into the child's blasphemous mouth as needed.
The best that can be said for Fonda's role is that it is marginally less gruesome than the manipulative maternal virago she played two years ago in Monster-in-Law . But once the family skeleton marches out of its closet and the therapeutic blather sets in, there's almost no rescuing this wobbly movie from its showdowns and insights.
Except, that is, when Lohan's around.
Beginning with The Parent Trap  and on through Freaky Friday , Mean Girls , and A Prairie Home Companion, there's scarcely been a movie that this gifted young actress hasn't made her own, unless you count the unsalvageable Herbie: Fully Loaded . A self-possessed, intelligent screen presence, she can outgun almost any caricature, including a parody of herself. Sullen at having been dumped in Hicksville , Rachel aims her indiscriminating libido simultaneously at a vet (Dermot Mulroney ) and a young Mormon blade (Garrett Hedlund ). She stays out late, liesmaybethrough her teeth, and creates mayhem. So, yes, Georgia Rule  might profitably be retitled The Lindsay Lohan Story  , but peeking out from all the strutting and preening is a strong, decent person in the making. With luck that same person may yet rise up to deliver Lohanwhose well-documented freak-out occurred on the set of Georgia Rule from her off-screen antics.
