What to make of a film that opens with a brutal home invasion which leaves a mother and child dead and then uses that ghastly jumping-off point and all its circumlocutions � legal, moral, and mortal � as an assiduous flaying of the criminal justice system? Sounds promising so far, but Law Abiding Citizen
 ends on an even grimmer note, stuck fast between righteous indignation at our bankrupt system of jurisprudence and our (presumed) need for heroes that don't cross the line between avenger and terrorist lest they become too existentially real. Butler turns a perfectly respectable, even riveting performance as Clyde Shelton, the dead family�s husband and father, who seeks a nominal form of justice via fast-rising D.A.'s assistant Nick Rice (Foxx). What he instead receives is a quick-and-dirty lesson in the painful subtleties and Faustian backroom dealings of the Philadelphia courts: Rice, unwilling to risk his near-perfect conviction rate, nails one invader to the cruciform death drip. The other, however, gets 10 years, a fact of life (or death) that does not sit well with Shelton, who turns out to be an ex-superspook capable of drawing a perfect hand of death cards even when he ends up behind bars as everyone associated with the original case starts falling to pieces, literally. Foxx has a thankless role here. He's subbing for the entire justice system of the United States, flaws and furies included, and his main mode of expression is steely determination and precious little else. Butler, however, mines his role for some serious Old Testament wrath, and anyone arguing against the battered-looking Shelton's ridiculously over-orchestrated (but plenty entertaining) death wish is liable to look like a sap. Until, that is, Law Abiding Citizen
's explosive denouement, which � oh, the ignominy! � sides with a broken system over a broken man. It feels like a lie, because it is, and lest anyone in the moviegoing public get the wrong idea,  the final five pages of Kurt Wimmer's (The Thomas Crown Affair
) screenplay nullify every ounce of frustration and rage brought to bear against the piss-poor judicial status quo in everything that precedes it. There's a lesson to be learned here, maybe � about the vagaries of the law, and when and why vigilante action may or may not be duly called for in the absence of definable, defensible justice � but Law Abiding Citizen
, ultimately and inappropriately, tips the scales in favor of the Man over mankind. Somebody call Charles Bronson.

You don’t want to snicker when two rows of parked cars suddenly blow up in “Law Abiding Citizen.’’ But that’s the only response to such desperate moviemaking. There’s no earthly reason for that explosion. Nor is there an explanation for lines like, “I do my job. I’m the best at it. It works.’’ That’s Jamie Foxx to Gerard Butler, but it may as well be Tom Cruise in anything.
Foxx plays Nick Rice, a rising star in the Philadelphia district attorney’s office, and for the first time in Foxx’s career, he appears to be performing his role from the bank where he cashed his check. He’s seen this movie before, and so have we. Ten years ago, Nick arranged a plea bargain for testimony against a man who killed the wife and daughter of Clyde Shelton (Butler), an engineer who still can’t believe that justice was only half served. In the decade that’s passed, Clyde has been exacting revenge against just about anyone involved in the murders and the trial.
You would think a movie about the lawyer’s attempt to stop the maniac would be a welcome change of pace from watching the cops try. How untrue. The movie appears to have been written by an automated thriller generator (enter city, enter occupations, enter films whose box office you’d like to emulate). So it hardly matters who’s stopping Butler. (Kurt Wimmer gets credit for the script.) The plot and its twists remain the same. So does the dialogue. “Lessons learned are soon forgotten.’’ “That’s how winners play.’’ “I’m gonna bring this whole diseased temple down on your head. It’s gonna be biblical!’’ Most of the lines sound as if they were first spoken on “CSI,’’ “NCIS,’’ or the WWE.
The central mystery in “Law Abiding Citizen’’ revolves around how Butler manages to kill judges and lawyers when he’s supposed to be serving time in a maximum-security prison. Which means the movie also revolves around a mound of human stupidity. Really? There’s no cop or security officer to stop that giant grenade-launching robot before it opens fire on a funeral procession? Viola Davis addresses some of this when she makes a late appearance as the mayor, but the onus to straighten this out is actually on us.
How are we to believe, for instance, that Butler can bring a city to its knees with his intellect?
Much of his role requires him to banter with Foxx, cutting deals with the DA’s office to save the lives Clyde has left in jeopardy. He requests a steak dinner and “all the trimmings.’’ He’d like an iPod. If not, somebody dies. Clyde shanks his cellmate to death then placidly hops onto his bunk covered in blood. This is hackneyed serial-killer stuff, from Hannibal Lecter down to the murderers of “Se7en’’ and “Saw.’’
And if there’s a prayer of bringing this character off, you need an actor capable not simply of danger but of the evil required to, say, send a DVD of a live dismemberment to a 10-year-old girl (oh, Clyde). You need an actor who can conjure nastiness with panache and pedantry. He has to want the steak and
 the nice Chianti to wash it down. Butler looks like a Guinness man.
In romantic comedies, Butler contributes a welcome dose of swagger at a time when machismo is in distressingly short supply. This is to say, he needs the challenge of the opposite sex. Otherwise, he seems shut down, especially here. It’s hard to blame him. Since the movie has no interest in taking seriously the grief and rage that fuels revenge, he has nothing emotional to play.
Most of the side actors  - Colm Meaney, Regina Hall, Michael Kelly  - are underused. And Butler and Foxx deserve to mix it up in a movie with a lot more going for it. This one doesn’t even have the heart to be a decent work of trash. Which is not to say it’s not tasteless.
In combining all those procedural shows with “Saw’’ and “The Silence of the Lambs,’’ the director F. Gary Gray (“The Italian Job’’) gets to play with all kinds of weaponry (rockets, automatic machine guns, improvised explosive devices). Helicopters swoop urgently past the camera. Like a lot of action-movie directors, Gray lacks the imagination to view the art of cat-and-mouse as more than a chance to play with state-of-the-art war technology. It used to be all you needed was a scowl and a .44 Magnum. This movie uses an arsenal that turns Philadelphia into Afghanistan.

Remember Charles Bronson in Death Wish ? Law Abiding Citizen  offers a taste of no-mercy vigilante family-man justice 3.0. Ten years after his wife and daughter were slaughtered in front of him, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) kidnaps one of the perpetrators, straps him down to a torture table, and saws off his limbs (and other things). Then he sends a video of the atrocity to Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), the slick, out-for-himself Philadelphia prosecutor who cut too soft a deal with the killer.
Clyde is one of those movie madmen who turns vengeance into a ''game.'' He's Bronson crossed with the didactic sadist of the Saw  films. Under arrest, he somehow devises a way to further his rampage from within the walls of a maximum-security prison  and that's a pretty big somehow , especially when you learn how he's doing it. Clyde is meant to be nuts, but too often it's Law Abiding Citizen  that checks rationality at the door. Butler and Foxx engage in sub–Silence of the Lambs  word duels, but during these scenes what I mostly noticed is how quickly I've grown tired of Butler's mush-mouthed bravura, and also how much I hope that Foxx, who looks bored, holds his slumming down to this one film. C–


 “Law Abiding Citizen,” a blunt and sadistic revenge thriller starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler, occasionally pauses from the mayhem to stage a solemn debate about law, justice and morality. Mr. Butler, playing a family man whose wife and daughter were murdered by thugs, feels he was let down by the system, which gave one of the thugs a light sentence in exchange for testimony against the other thug, who was sentenced to death. Mr. Foxx, the prosecutor who made that deal, thinks that the system, however imperfect, did its job.  But really, “Law Abiding Citizen” has about as much to say about real-life legal issues as “Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen” had to say about defense policy. And it has less ethical gravity than any three of the “Saw” movies. Though it sometimes puts on a serious face, this movie, directed with snarling, snappish style by F. Gary Gray (“The Italian Job”), wears its preposterousness with a certain pride. It’s about the cat-and-mouse game between two very smart guys, and it’s perfectly happy to be as dumb as it wants.  Nick Rice, Mr. Foxx’s character, is slick and ambitious, proud of his 96 percent conviction rate and quite sure that he’s the cleverest and coolest person in the room. This does not seem like much of a stretch for Mr. Foxx, who is cashing in on his Oscar rather than going after a second one. Mr. Butler, for his part, displays a surliness that many in Hollywood seem to mistake for charisma, and suffers the anguish of violent bereavement as if it were an annoying gastrointestinal ailment.  His character, Clyde Shelton, returns 10 years after the death of his family to tie up some loose ends. He dispatches the thugs, willingly goes to prison and starts doing dinner theater Hannibal Lecter for Mr. Foxx’s benefit. “Some lessons must be learned in blood,” Clyde declares, one of many portentous proverbs that he seems to have learned during his career as a military killing-gizmo specialist.  The details of his job history are revealed, during a secret meeting in a tunnel somewhere, late in the movie. But don’t think I’ve spoiled anything. By the time I saw “Law Abiding Citizen,” I had already seen the trailer four or five times. Another 40 viewings would have added up to the running time of the whole film, without much loss of pleasure or nuance.  Well, that’s not entirely true. Most of the fun in the feature-length “Law Abiding Citizen” comes not from the cleverly rigged explosions and bloodlettings — including one unleashed by a robot in a cemetery — but rather from the game and gifted supporting cast, who are not featured in the two-minute trailer version.  Colm Meaney, Leslie Bibb and Bruce McGill are all much better than they need to be, as is Viola Davis in a few scenes as the mayor of Philadelphia, where this bloodbath takes place. You can’t help regretting that some of their characters will meet fiery or bloody ends. On the other hand,  the actors were no doubt paid well for their suffering.  “Law Abiding Citizen” is rated R. It has a lot of grisly and sometimes imaginative violence and some swearing too.

Revenge is a dish best served with car bombs and chainsaws in "Law Abiding Citizen," a twisty hybrid of serial-killer suspenser, legal thriller and prison drama that, in between grisly setpieces, attempts to raise significant questions about the failures of the criminal justice system. Yet far more than any tacked-on moral dilemmas, it's Gerard Butler's juicy performance as a grieving father turned mass-murdering psycho genius that powers this self-serious pulp entertainment. Overture release packs enough potent shocks to lure sizable thrill-seeking crowds to multiplexes (the owners of which are hopefully smart enough to hyphenate the title on the marquee).
Wasting no time, the pic plunges the viewer immediately into a horrific yet unprotracted domestic bloodbath. Two men break into the home of Philadelphia family man Clyde Shelton (Butler), who's forced to watch helplessly as they murder his wife and young daughter. Exactly how and why Clyde survives the senseless assault is left unexamined by Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which quickly abandons the scene of the crime in favor of a longer stay in legal chambers, where matters of guilt and innocence aren't quite so cut-and-dried.
Unable to convict both killers due to insufficient evidence, prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a careerist accustomed to compromise, arranges a deal with one of the perps, Darby (Christian Stolte), so he can send the other to death row. But that's not good enough for Clyde, who waits 10 long years for vengeance -- and well worth the wait it is, as he abducts Darby and lays him out on an operating table apparently on loan from the "Saw" prop department.
True torture-porn aficionados will be disappointed, as editor Tariq Anwar cuts away right before blade meets flesh -- a move that feels a tad, well, gutless under the circumstances. But elsewhere, "Citizen" proves startlingly graphic, even by R-rated standards; as Clyde's killing spree continues, now targeting the key players in the decade-old murder case, one starts watching every scene in nervous anticipation that heads or SUVs might explode without warning.
Even after he's apprehended and locked up, Clyde remains 10 steps ahead of everyone else, including Nick, who tries in vain to stop this homicidal mastermind. Like a younger, hunkier Hannibal Lecter, Clyde plays nasty mind games, makes ludicrous demands and is in every way determined to shake the foundations of so-called law and order.
Just as Nick is outwitted again and again by Clyde, so top-billed Foxx is overmatched here by Butler -- who, even if he can't quite make sense of an impossible character (a loving husband and father warped by unspeakable trauma into a one-man WMD), clearly relishes the challenge. Whether he's savoring a steak (delivered in exchange for info about a victim's whereabouts) or, in the pic's most galvanizing moment, telling off a judge, Butler gives the picture a pulse and keeps it throbbing steadily through the first hour, which shamelessly feeds the viewer's own appetite for revenge.
Butler makes such a charismatic villain/antihero that you never quite stop rooting for him, which is a credit to the performance but also a dramatic handicap -- one that serves to show how disposable the good guys are, even those played by such sterling character vets as Bruce McGill, Colm Meaney and Viola Davis.
Director F. Gary Gray (making a smooth return to filmmaking four years after "Be Cool") lends the pic some of the procedural flair and attention to detail that distinguished his souped-up 2003 remake of "The Italian Job." But "Citizen" is a more bloated affair, and it winds up feeling overwritten yet underexplained, foregoing plausible revelations in favor of gusty debate about the ethical challenges of practicing and upholding the law. Suspense deflates even as the body count escalates.
Using a steely color palette to emphasize its moral gray zones, the pic benefits significantly from its Philly locations, which include City Hall and Holmesburg Prison.

The movie wastes no time: Before the opening credits, a man watches two home invaders slaughter his wife and daughter—and we don't even know their names. Then: Deals are cut, the murderer walks while his less culpable accomplice is sentenced to death, and the dad wonders, "But what about justice?" And then: A decade passes, dad has seen a Saw  or two, and it's retribution time. Everyone must pay, even the innocent. So much for our sympathy for the leading man, who happens to be Gerard Butler  in yet another questionable role. Director F. Gary Gray  and writer Kurt Wimmer  peddle cheap, graphic Z-grade revenge thrills dressed up as Knowing Sociopolitical Commentary—as in, the justice system's rotten, so let's blow up, then gut, then roast again the whole sumbitch and start from scratch. Jamie Foxx 's prosecutor (smug, a slow learner) gets a front-row seat to the explosion, as Butler's Clyde Shelton  goes behind bars and into solitary confinement, from where, somehow, he is capable of inflicting enough damage and carnage to terrorize the whole of Philadelphia. Clyde won't stop speechifying about doing bad things in the name of the greater good. If the filmmakers meant a word of it, they'd quit making films and do something more useful. Saw  with a conscience is not what the world needs.
