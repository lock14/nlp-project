Although the obvious thing to do is compare Observe and Report
 with 2009�s previous mall-cop comedy (and breakout success) Paul Blart: Mall Cop
, the more apt comparison would be to director Ben Stiller�s darker comedies that push the boundaries of awkward embarrassment � something along the lines of The Cable Guy
. The central character in both Observe and Report
 and Paul Blart
 is a shopping-mall security guard who suffers from delusions of grandeur, and both roles are played by comic actors. However, in writer/director Hill�s Observe and Report
, the guard, Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen), is a bipolar gun nut who also has suffered damage from an alcoholic mother (Weston), an absent father, and his difficulties with the opposite sex. To add to his problems, there�s a flasher on the loose in the mall parking lot, who, by the end of the movie, is running rampant through the mall with his full frontal exposed and flapping apace (there�s also a Polaroid of the culprit's penis, which Ronnie flashes frequently during his search). The flasher appears to be a higher priority on Ronnie�s capture list than the mysterious thieves who rob various mall stores during the night. Such is the world of comedy. Here Rogen demonstrates that he is capable of portraying characters more complicated than his previously essayed affable, everyguy stoners. Still, his range is not huge, which may be part of the reason Ronnie�s vigilantism takes such a dark turn. More likely, however, is that the unevenness is due to the guiding aesthetic of Hill (The Foot Fist Way
). Subplots come and go with zero regard for narrative integrity � for example, when lisping security guard Dennis (Pe�a) uncharacteristically shows Ronnie a whole different approach to life, solves one of the mysteries, and then disappears from the movie. Scenes with Ronnie�s mom, who drinks until she passes out on the living room floor and wets herself, are painful to watch and add nothing of narrative value; other key characters, such as Ronnie�s would-be paramour, Brandi (Faris), and his actual cop nemesis (Liotta), are played as one-note foils � total ditz and ball of anger, respectively. Hill�s uninventive visual style further removes any possibility of surprise or ingenuity with its rote shot/reverse shot gambit. (The film�s only visual surprise is the frequency with which the guilty penis is flashed � but, hey, you gotta take your comedy where you find it.) Midway through, a character remarks as he leaves the scene of a takedown of Ronnie, �I thought this was going to be funny, but it�s just kind of sad.� The same thing is true about the movie as a whole.

I know, I know. Another month, another doofus-mall-cop movie. How do these things happen? "Observe and Report," which opens today and stars Seth Rogen, has been pre-mocked as "Paul Blart 2." But this new movie is crazier, scarier, funnier, and more bewildering. It's the strangest movie I expect to see from a Hollywood studio for the rest of the year.
Any film that opens with a riotous sequence of a flabby flasher whipping open his trench coat and spewing obscene commands at women in a mall parking lot has done something right. It's not just that "Observe and Report" begins with this flasher, whom Randy Gambill plays with a necessary lack of inhibition. It's that the filmmaking balances the awfulness and comedy of the event. The urgency in the handheld camera's attempt to keep up with the flasher, the horror in the faces of the women, the general beauty of the day (the sun brings out the orange in the pervert's hair)  - it's lewd and wonderful, a perfect John Waters afternoon.
That opening sequence also lays out the uneasy blend of harmlessness and real danger that writer-director Jody Hill tries to build into "Observe and Report," his second film after last year's "The Fist Foot Way." The flasher gives Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen) something to obsess over. Ronnie works security at a fictitious everymall. He lives with his alcoholic mother (Celia Weston) and spends his downtime at a gun club, wishing, alongside his twin co-workers (John and Matt Yuan), for the right to bear arms on the job. He also may be bipolar.
From the early going, it seems that Rogen will be doing more of his abrasive teddy bear routine  - unprintable commentary followed by a moment of sensitivity. Often with Rogen, his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe. He gets away with insulting Katherine Heigl or Elizabeth Banks because they will tame his heart. Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. He's shameless.
Not far into the movie, Ronnie saunters over to his crush, Brandi (Anna Faris), the flamboyantly blond dipstick who works at a department store cosmetics counter, to warn her about the flasher. He winds up being insulting. Rogen's normal awkward self-awareness doesn't kick in. Ronnie doesn't realize his foot is in his mouth. His profanity extends to the sweet girl, Nell (Collette Wolfe), who makes his coffee and also endures the verbal abuse of her boss (Pat ton Oswalt). She appears to love Ronnie's casual putdowns all the same.
After that first encounter with Nell, I wondered where Hill was taking this  - the gunplay, the indecent exposure, Ronnie's cruelties, the pitch-perfect calibration of Faris's obnoxiousness.
While it incorporates the shallow, gag-oriented style of "Napoleon Dynamite," "Observe and Report" becomes increasingly dark, and the movie struggles to balance the whimsical and the psychotic. The result is a tone-deaf black comedy that in the 1970s would have been a grisly thriller  - "Dirty Harry" or "Taxi Driver"  - and by the 1980s would have been "Rambo." Ronnie is as reactionary as Harry Callahan but as delusional as Travis Bickle. He has altercations with everyone from the American Arab kid (Aziz Ansari) who mans a massage cart to the aggravated detective (Ray Liotta, terrific) investigating a shoplifting case that Ronnie is determined to solve himself.
The character is a frustrating creation, partly because he's crazy, partly because Hill and Rogen seem unsure of just how crazy to make him. When Ronnie goes nuts on a drug gang, it's funny because the two sides of the law are clear. His verbal assaults on Nell are a different matter. They're personal. Say what you will about Travis Bickle, he knew how to treat a lady.
The line here between crusading man-child and menace to society is perilously thin. Yet as with "Taken" or, for that matter, any of the "Police Academy" movies, Ronnie's commitment to justice is crowd-pleasing, if certain to result in lawsuits. A braver, more outraged movie might have made this character a victim of the economy. But this frustrated cop (he fails a police psychological exam with flying colors) has no higher moral calling. He craves the thrill of war and the adoration of the public he claims to protect: Rambo with pre-traumatic stress disorder. If Ronnie ever makes it out of this fictional shopping center to a mall near you, laugh. Then run for your life.
.

With the outsize box office success of Paul Blart: Mall Cop , you can be excused for entering Observe and Report  expecting sloppy seconds. In this version, a pudgy Seth Rogen wears the tin badge of weaponless courage previously pinned on a pudgy Kevin James. But it'll take only about three minutes before the unnerving truth sets in: Observe and Report  is as bleakly, exhilaratingly  furious as Paul Blart  is squarely comforting. And from here on in, it's time to forget the Kevin James vehicle  (no matter how similar some of the pair's superficial plot mechanics) and focus on the profound madness and  sadness that fuels this risky, riotous, moody-blue comedy written and directed by Jody Hill.
Shorn of his cute curls and ditching most traces of the shaggy sweetness that served him in Knocked Up  and Monsters vs. Aliens , Rogen plays Ronnie Barnhardt, head of  security at generic Forest Ridge Mall. Ronnie is a hard-ass stickler on the job, and a lonely guy off duty  with a million reasons why. He's got bipolar disorder, which keeps him from fulfilling his dream of becoming a real cop. (There's none of Blart's benign hypoglycemia as an excuse for failure here.) He lives with his mother (Celia Weston), a pass-out-cold alcoholic as clammy as Blart's mom is fuzzy. He's got a crush on a trampy makeup-counter clerk named Brandi (Anna Faris), who disdains him with all the obnoxiousness available to a drink-pounding tease flashing cleavage and lip gloss. But he's blind to the shy interest shown by a nice food-court barista (Collette Wolfe) regularly berated by her boss for laziness when, really, it's only her broken leg that's slowing her down. (A metaphor for America? Why not.)
Ronnie's a man simmering to a boil  Taxi Driver 's Travis Bickle is a spiritual brother  and his scalding spillover moment arrives when a flasher in a regulation flasher's raincoat goes on a rampage, traumatizing mall customers (which is bad enough) and then exposing his junk to Brandi (which, to Ronnie, is even worse). A hard-boiled detective  (Ray Liotta) shows up to take charge of the investigation, but Ronnie sees this criminal hunt as his mission. With everything to prove  to Brandi, to the cop academy that rejected him in the first place, and to his own pharmaceutically  managed sense of autonomy  the competition to nab the perv is on.
Director Hill previously demonstrated his unique comedic ability to screw with American normalcy in the great, wack martial-arts movie The Foot Fist Way  and co-created the warpy HBO series Eastbound & Down . To his credit, he leads Observe and Report  down every alley a mainstream comedy is supposed to avoid. The violence is bone-crunching. (Pineapple Express , directed by David Gordon Green, celebrated the same aesthetic of brutality, and no wonder: Hill and Green share an alumni brotherhood at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, as well as the amazing gimlet eye of cinematographer Tim Orr on both projects.) Women are depicted as skanks and slatterns. Ethnicity and sexual orientation are freely mocked. Unrepentant drinking and drugging go unchastised. The flasher flaps vigorously and often  yes, that's a penis I see before me  leading to a chase scene through the mall that makes the naked wrestling set piece in  Borat  look coy. The result is a crazy mosaic of Americana with tiles scattered and missing. Need I observe and report that the view isn't for every taste? It sure is for mine.
Meanwhile, the cast, led by Rogen, chomps into all this anarchy as if liberated from the Hollywood salt mines, with a commitment to the material worthy of a tribute from James Lipton. Faris, adored these days for her specialty depiction of faux bimbos, has no qualms making her Brandi a bitch rather than a more acceptably cartoonish beyotch. The superb character actor Celia Weston  (In the Bedroom ) is truly breathtaking as  Ronnie's boozer mom. The supporting cast, including Hill's regular muse and comedic  co-conspirator, Danny McBride, and Hill's game film-school pal Randy Gambill as the flasher, never flinch from going exactly where you're bound to say, Oh no, they wouldn't .
Oh yes, they do. A–

 If you thought Abu Ghraib was a laugh riot then you might love “Observe and Report,” a potentially brilliant conceptual comedy that fizzles because its writer and director, Jody Hill, doesn’t have the guts to go with his spleen. The story, in short, turns on a psycho shopping mall security chief, Ronnie (Seth Rogen, putting the lump into lumpen proletariat), who rules his retail roost with a Taser, a trigger-hair temper and some smiley-faced sycophants. Like the pettiest of dictators, Ronnie preys on the weak in the service of power (in this case the mall itself). He’s the Lynndie England of this dumber-and-dumbest yukfest.  That’s admittedly overstated, but sadism is this movie’s currency. The standard line about Mr. Hill, whose other credits include the movie “The Foot Fist Way” and the new HBO series “East Bound and Down,” is that he has carved out a place in the pop-cultural firmament by exploiting his characters’ perceived awkwardness. But while Ronnie is socially clumsy, his ineptitude is a contrivance, a mask that initially entertains (we laugh at him), only to be more or less discarded when he turns hero — at which point, we’re meant to laugh less at him and more at everyone else. The comedies of the Farrelly brothers and Judd Apatow hinge on a similar misfit-turned-hero dynamic, but Mr. Hill adds a nasty twist to the formula.  The twist here is Ronnie, a veritable catalog of dysfunction whose drop-dead drunk of a mother (Celia Weston) describes him as having been a special-needs child. Ronnie pops prescription pills day and night, presumably for his self-confessed bipolar disorder. At work, where he is soon preoccupied with capturing a serial flasher (Randy Gambill), he swaggers around the mall like a Wild West sheriff — though because he’s more Deputy Dawg than Dirty Harry, the joke is definitely on him. He bosses around his rent-a-cop underlings, including his deputy, Dennis (a heavily lisping Michael Peña), and John and Matt (John and Matt Yuan), a support team that seems to have been assembled specifically to neutralize any complaints about how Ronnie treats nonwhites.  Not that Ronnie is a race hater. However technically inept a director, Mr. Hill is too professionally shrewd to barrel down that particular road and, more important, there are too many studio dollars at stake here to risk outraging ethnic and racial groups that could be buying movie tickets. Instead Mr. Hill thumbs his nose at politically correct sensibilities, notably through Ronnie’s mutually hostile encounters with a mall worker he calls Saddamn (Aziz Ansari), who has taken a restraining order out against him. Mr. Hill defuses this potentially explosive relationship by making sure that Saddamn is as verbally hostile as his foe, which I guess is supposed to make it O.K. to laugh when Ronnie punches him in the face.  By far the most outrageous instance of Mr. Hill’s disarming his own bombs occurs when Ronnie beds Brandi (Anna Faris, rising above the muck), a cosmetics clerk who’s impervious to his attentions until the flasher brings them together. During an ensuing date, Brandi gobbles pills, guzzles tequila and even sputters puke, prompting Ronnie to kiss her square on the messy mouth. What follows next should have been the shock of the movie: a cut to Ronnie having vigorous sex with Brandi who, from her closed eyes, slack body and the vomit trailing from her mouth to her pillow, appears to have passed out. But before the words “date rape” can form in your head, she rouses herself long enough to command Ronnie to keep going.  Comedy is often cruel, of course, but before 1968, the year the movie rating system was instituted, directors couldn’t squeeze laughs from the suggestion of date rape, as Mr. Hill tries to do here. Like action and horror filmmakers, comedy directors now push hard against social norms with characters who deploy expletives, bodily fluids and increasing brutality. Mr. Hill has upped the ante in this extreme comedy scene not only by creating a working-class, bipolar bully who lives with his alcoholic mother, but also by asking us to laugh at this pathetic soul — and his miserably constrained life — as well as at the violence he wreaks. The dolts in “Dumb and Dumber” had hearts of gold. Ronnie has a gun.  Mr. Hill says his movie was inspired by “Taxi Driver,” a self-flattering comparison. Like those of Travis Bickle, Ronnie’s delusions of grandeur do end in a paroxysm of blood. Yet while Martin Scorsese might be overly fond of screen violence, part of what makes that film profound and memorable is how the thrill of violence, its seduction, is always in play with a palpable moral revulsion. No such dialectic informs “Observe and Report,” which exploits Ronnie and his brutality for laughs. This lack of critique might make the movie seem daring. But it’s hard to see what is so bold about a film that, much like the world outside the theater, turns the pain and humiliation of other people into a consumable spectacle.  You could argue, I suppose, that there is no real difference between Ronnie shooting an unarmed man and a comic who throws a custard pie in another person’s kisser: they both make (some) audiences laugh. To insist on that difference is, among other things, to introduce politics and morality into the conversation,  and, really, who wants that when you’re watching a Seth Rogen flick? It’s far better and certainly easier, as the old movie theater slogan put it, to sit back and relax and enjoy the show. That, after all, is precisely what Hollywood banks on each time it manufactures a new entertainment for a public that — as the stupid, violent characters who hold up a mirror to that public indicate — it views with contempt.  “Observe and Report” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains bloody gun and fisticuff violence, vomit-adorned sexual congress and full-frontal male nudity. 

Think "Travis Bickle: Mall Cop" and you'll have some idea of what to expect from "Observe and Report," writer-director Jody Hill's shockingly and sometimes discomfortingly funny comedy about an unstable security guard who views himself as vigilant protector - and, occasionally, avenging angel - while patrolling a suburban shopping mall. Taking a setup that could have been played for sitcom jokiness and family-friendly slapstick, Hill attempts something much darker, if not downright transgressive, with a pic bound to divide auds and critics into love-it-or-leave-it camps when it opens April 10. It's a gamble that might pay off handsomely for Warners. Or not.
With his hair cropped short, his waistline expanded and his overall vibe suggesting less lovable schlub than fascistic thug, Seth Rogen makes no effort to claim aud sympathy with a nervy lead performance that's in perfect sync with the pic itself. Rogen keeps the aud off-balance in ways that aren't always pleasurable, often indicating that, at any moment, funny business might devolve into serious mayhem - which, on at least three occasions, it does.
Rogen plays Ronnie Barnhardt, security chief at Forest Ridge Mall, a terse, tough-talking fellow who still lives at home with his alcoholic mom (Celia Weston), nurses a crush on a bosomy makeup-counter salesclerk (Anna Faris) and commands the other guards on his watch with the intensity of a Marine sergeant in a war zone. 
When the mall is repeatedly stalked by a flasher, Ronnie views the perv as an affront to all that is decent and wholesome in Forest Ridge Mall. He also welcomes the hunt for this unwelcome visitor as a way of proving his potential to become a real police officer. Trouble is, someone who's already a real police officer, the cynical and unsympathetic Det. Harrison (Ray Liotta), is called in by mall management to handle the situation.
For Ronnie, Harrison is an interloper in his jurisdiction. For Harrison, Ronnie is a klutzy rent-a-cop to be humored, then heckled.
Despite all the gleeful vulgarity and non-PC humor of the opening scenes, and despite all the clear signs that Ronnie has a ludicrously exaggerated (and entirely unjustified) sense of self-worth, it's not until around the 20-minute mark that writer-director Hill reveals just how unconventional he intends "Observe and Report" to be. As a prank, Harrison drops Ronnie off in a rough neighborhood, to give the security guard a taste of "real cop" life. What follows is a sequence that is all the more hilarious because the violence is so seriously brutal.
Much like the cruel and clueless martial-arts instructor in Hill's breakthrough debut feature, "The Foot Fist Way," Ronnie is more complex, and much scarier, than the kind of self-deluding boob auds usually encounter in comedies of this sort. With the invaluable aid of Rogen, who's never been better, Hill sustains an impressive degree of tension between seemingly contradictory elements. In fact, time and again throughout "Observe and Report," it may strike some viewers that, with just a few tweaks of the script, the scenario could have been played straight as a psychological drama in the vein of "Taxi Driver" (even though the ending plays more like "The King of Comedy").
At the same time, Hill earns big laughs with comic setpieces that are guaranteed to generate strong word of mouth. Highlights range from explosively funny gross-out gags - Faris is a great sport during the most amusing of these - to scenes of comic violence that elicit winces as well as laughs.
Supporting perfs are nicely disciplined across the board, so Faris and Weston are effectively uninhibited without seeming grotesque, and Liotta never betrays his character's intimidating toughness with a wink or a nod. Other standouts include Colette Wolfe as a Toast-a-Bun barista who warms to Ronnie, and John and Matthew Yuan as twin brothers who toil as Ronnie's most loyal underlings. Michael Pena is also memorable as the security chief's loyal assistant.
Filmed on location in the largely abandoned Winrock Mall in Albuquerque, N.M., "Observe and Report" boasts production values that are unobtrusively sufficient. Pic makes inspired use of a semi-obscure oldie on the soundtrack, the Yardbirds' "Over Under Sideways Down," during a sequence that will make viewers guffaw until they're thoroughly ashamed of themselves. 


As the title Observe and Report  begs for analysis, I herewith declare this Seth Rogen  comedy broad but thin and more bleak than uproarious—a humorously downsized homage to foundational '70s classics like Dirty Harry   and, especially, Taxi Driver , cited by writer-director Jody Hill  as a key influence.
As the year's second send-up of an emotionally unbalanced shopping mall security man, it also takes us two-thirds of the way toward a trend. But where the eponymous loser-turned-winner protagonist of the wildly successful and equally slapdash Paul Blart : Mall Cop  (played by Kevin James ) was a sweet and lovable hypoglycemic with dreams of joining the New Jersey state troopers and wooing the mall's resident hair-extension specialist, Ronnie Barnhardt  is an angry, self-important, crude, racist, bipolar knucklehead, possessed of similar ambitions but played by Rogen with admirable disregard for audience empathy.
Adding to the pathology, Ronnie (analysts will note the gender-ambiguous, infantilizing name) lives at home with his slatternly, sluttish dipso mother (Celia Weston ) and haplessly lusts after her youthful counterpart, the hard-partying cosmetics salesgirl Brandi (Anna Faris ). Ronnie's problems with sex and aggression are epitomized in an extended volley of alternately loud and sotto voce "Fuck you"s exchanged with the mall worker he calls Saddam  (Aziz Ansari ). Longing for a real gun so as to be a real man, this would-be authoritarian tough guy further engages in a destructively competitive relationship with the police detective Harrison (Ray Liotta ), who arrives at the mall to investigate a case of male exhibitionism.
Ronnie is obsessed with the flasher (unclothed and credited), as well he might be. This irrepressible exhibitionist exposes himself to Brandi (driving her to orgasmic hysteria) and is repressed Ronnie's secret sharer. The two men have a certain physical similarity, and Observe and Report 's most relentless riff is the blatant equation of the flasher's oft-seen and pointedly unprepossessing dick with the castrated mall cop's attempt to possess what a Lacanian would call the phallic function. In the movie's signature image, Ronnie plasters a snapshot of the flasher's member on his forehead and proclaims, "That's me!"
Like its unpleasant protag, Observe and Report  isn't so much funny-ha-ha as funny-peculiar. Despite a couple of extended, comic two-handers—Ronnie's date with Brandi, and his psychological evaluation when he applies for admission to the police academy—the movie's most convulsive moments are the lunatic, even terrifying, explosions of invective and violence. Off his meds, this alarmingly bellicose bratwurst confidently informs the professionally smiling psychologist that, "At this point in my life, I feel like I could destroy some motherfuckers!"
Indeed. The requisite politically incorrect ethnic vaudeville (which involves Asians, Arabs, and Latinos, but not African-Americans) is a needed cushion for the psychosexual drama. Viewers will be grateful that the singlemindedly simian Rogen, who demonstrates more depth than range, is flanked by two shameless clowns. The hilariously vulgar Faris (last seen in The House Bunny ) injects some superbly timed physical comedy, while Michael Peña  (better known for serious roles in Lions for Lambs  and World Trade Center  ) contributes a note of nihilistic bromance as Ronnie's lisping sidekick. Rogen's best bits are conceptual—as when Ronnie goes "undercover" (which is to say, completely delusional) and, recognized by his colleagues at the mall, denies his utter existence.
Ronnie ultimately devolves into a parody Travis Bickle  whose rescue fantasy, to the degree that it can be articulated, centers on the handicapped, abused "born-again virgin" (Collette Wolf ) working the mall's Dunkin' Donuts  equivalent. Still, Observe and Report  is not without a certain sociological vérité. Ronnie the Mall Cop is as an iconic expression of irate proletarian populism and brainless role-playing as Joe the Plumber or Rush the Limbaugh—identify or ignore at your peril.
