Consider the allure of the ant: Nowhere else can the budding entomologist decipher the physiological underpinnings of the family formicidae
 with such rapt attention, intuitively employing not only the more traditional methods of anatomical study, but also such kidhood staples as the magnifying glass, the power-jet watering hose, and the vulcanized Stride Rite sole. Call these pint-sized explorers ant bullies if you must, but this interspecies backyard battleground is often also the birthplace of scientific wonder. (And pipsqueak sadism, of course, but the two are frequent if uncomfortable allies in the youthful war on ignorance.) That Warner Bros. has chosen to craft an animated film around childhood's fascination with all things small and squirmy is interesting � the project is adapted from John Nickle's children's book � but it makes for a strange time at the movies. The story is both simple and worthy of an issue of EC Comics' Weird Science
: Ten-year-old beanpole-cum-bully-target Lucas (Eisen), who regularly takes out his feelings of victimization on the anthill in his front yard, finds himself a part of that very colony when ant-wizard Zoc (Cage) shrinks this towering "destroyer" down to a more manageable size. Despite the colony's brief flirtation with devouring their suddenly edible arch-foe, the Ant Queen (Streep) mandates that he be trained to "become an ant," if not in leg count then certainly in spirit. This Lucas does, with commendable results and thanks in no small part to his ant "mentor," Hova (Roberts), climaxing in an airborne third-act battle with Giamatti's stogie-chomping exterminator. Director Davis has previously helmed the televised Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius
 and is no slouch in the animation department. The Ant Bully
 glows with vibrant greens and violets and moves with all the resolute forward motion of, well, an ant. Unfortunately it's also seemingly arbitrary in its meanderings, with various vocal work coming in out of left field (Ricardo Montalban as the head of the ant council is more or less wasted) and a storyline that just doesn't add up to all that much we haven't seen before, or done better, and frequently both. Kids will likely dig the triumph of the little guys, geeks will convulse with knowing glee at the nod to classic sci-fi flick Them!
, and adults will puzzle over the script's oddly brazen socialist politics (this is like Entomology 101 as taught by Noam Chomsky). It all adds up to a peculiar whole; fun I suppose, but not what you'd call a picnic.


The makers of Warner Bros.' new animated movie ``The Ant Bully" are taking a considerable risk thinking we've forgotten about the Great Hollywood Insect War of 1998. Surely you remember. That year ``Antz" squared off against ``A Bug's Life," and both movies seemed to quench forever the world's thirst for witty pests. That, of course, was eight years ago, just enough time for a new crop of kiddies to sprout to movie-going age and lap up the simple delights in ``The Ant Bully," where all the ants look like designer coffee tables with golf-ball-surfaced eyes. In other words, where can I buy one?
Adapted from John Nickle's illustrated book and directed by John A. Davis, the man behind ``Jimmy Neutron," the story is a variation on those earlier insect movies: critters in jeopardy. Only now there's a playful human wrinkle. Frequently picked on by the neighborhood thug, poor bespectacled 10-year-old Lucas (the voice of Zach Tyler Eisner) takes his frustration out on the ant colony in his suburban lawn, turning the magnifying glass on it and then a garden hose.
Down below, one wizard ant, Zoc (Nicolas Cage), has had it. The magic potion he's concocted actually works, and one night Lucas is vengefully reduced to the puny size of his victims. It's his comedownance. Taken back to the anthill, he's promptly convicted -- by Ricardo Montalban's head ant! -- of crimes against the colony and sentenced by the ethereal queen (Meryl Streep, of course) to live as an ant until he earns his freedom.
Through Lucas, the movie has a high time demonstrating that it's hard out here for an ant. The amount of work required to get the tiniest of crumbs is epic. It takes a village, in fact. But the tiny human boy wants no part of the elaborate obstacle courses required to attain the bright morsels of jelly bean -- excuse me, ``sweet rock."
Lucas refuses to go along with any of it, so obviously, today's lesson is ``teamwork." And here to help him learn it are the forager ant, Kreela (Regina King) and Zoc's girlfriend Hova, whose name suggests the voice of Jay-Z (that's one of his aliases) but who is actually played by Julia Roberts. Much to Zoc's consternation, she and Lucas form a believable bond, and the two are soon off, along with Kreela and the macho scout ant, Fugax (Bruce Campbell), to fetch more candy from Lucas's house. (Jellybelly's anonymous-looking jelly beans are the only products placed in this movie. Compared to the marketing bonanzas of ``Curious George" and ``Over the Hedge," the movie's brand name chastity is farmer's market quaint.)
The movie has a great time playing with ideas of scope and perspective, shifting between microscopic and macroscopic. Those shifts even produce a visual gag featuring an exploding firecracker that, weeks later, still makes me laugh. But the scenes of the ants making their way through Lucas's house is a wondrous showcase for the animators' imaginations. Carpet becomes a shaggy jungle and the air from a fan an ideal way to paraglide across a room.
That's the most inspired sequence in the movie and its loveliness is probably too placid for a lot of kids, but who knows? The movie's two battle sequences are certainly more revved up. One is against a storm of wasps. The other is against the nasty human exterminator (Paul Giamatti), of whose scalp the movie gives us a stomach-turning tour.
Those two battles are so exciting that anyone old enough to remember the Great Hollywood Insect War of 1998 will be momentarily willing to let that memory go.


Maybe it's because the Ant Queen (summer's movie MVP, Meryl Streep) is so excellently magisterial. Or because Nurse Ant Hova and Wizard Ant Zoc (Julia Roberts and Nicolas Cage, both of them loose and playful  yes, Cage is playful, not gloomy!) are such a cool formicary couple. Or because the goggling, goofy-glasses IMAX 3D experience (available, as they say, in select theaters) magnifies the charms, and the dramas, of very teensy insects and one temporarily tiny boy. All I know is, the kind of life lessons that usually gum up the fun go down as easily as jelly beans in The Ant Bully , an effortlessly clever animated confection directed by Jimmy Neutron  creator John A. Davis, who also wrote the screenplay.
True enough, it's not nice to be mean. And in the beginning (as in John Nickle's illustrated kids' book of the same name), 10-year-old Lucas Nickle (Zach Tyler Eisen) persecutes downward, stomping a convenient anthill after being tormented by the neighborhood blobby brute. And only when Lucas himself is shrunk (by, oh, the usual  a magic potion whipped up by Zoc and dropped in the kid's ear) does he learn what cooperation, friendship, and awesome ant culture are all about. Yeah, yeah. Point is, bugs  and a bug-size boy are funny. And, following Monster House , another PG cartoon turns out to be a secret clubhouse for the cool kids this summer.

 “The Ant Bully,” directed by John A. Davis and based on a book by John Nickle, is the latest computer-animated plea for interspecies understanding. Like “Over the Hedge,” it asks us to consider that creatures we regard as pests might be people too, or at least that they might speak in the voices of movie stars. Those tiny,  six-legged marauders raiding your child’s backyard birthday party — what if they were really Nicolas Cage and Julia Roberts? And what if their queen was none other than Meryl Streep? Would you still stomp them, squish them or scorch them with a magnifying glass?  Your answers will remain confidential. In the meantime, while we anticipate the inevitable kiddie-animation extravaganza featuring lovable, anthropomorphized roaches, termites or E. coli bacteria — hey, they have feelings too! — “The Ant Bully” provides a few moments of inventiveness and wit. Not too many, mind you. The bug theme was big news for Pixar and DreamWorks back in 1998, the year of “A Bug’s Life”“ and “Antz,” and this movie, a behind-the-curve effort from Warner Brothers, is unlikely to put either of them in the shade.  “The Ant Bully” works best when it sticks with the simpler implications of its premise, turning drastic differences of scale and perspective into clever visual jokes. The title character is Lucas Nickle (Zach Tyler Eisen), a picked-on suburban boy who takes revenge on the bullies who bug him by wreaking havoc on the ants who have built their colony on his lawn. In the ant world he is known as the Destroyer, and Zoc, the ant wizard (Mr. Cage), devises a potion that will cut this menace down to size. Suddenly, Lucas awakens to find himself a prisoner of the ants, and then, thanks to the intercession of Hova (Ms. Roberts), an apprentice ant himself.  It turns out that the social insects have much to teach us humans about discipline and cooperation. For them it’s all about teamwork, as Zoc explains to Lucas in a quiet, didactic scene. His vision of a society in which every member does his assigned task for the benefit of the group — from each according to his ability, to each according to his need, more or less — strikes Lucas as a stark contrast with the selfish, unfriendly ways of humans. Later he will find a useful application of Zoc’s lesson,  which he might also have gleaned from watching an old strike movie from the 1930’s.  But let’s not assume that “The Ant Bully” is preaching socialism. Coming as they do in the middle of a Time Warner product, Zoc’s words are more likely to conjure a bittersweet vision of corporate synergy. If only the various divisions could work together like happy ants, they just might ...  Oh, I don’t know. Eat a lot of jellybeans. Its allegorical implications aside, “The Ant Bully” is a hectic, busy, slapdash entertainment with some inspired visual flights. Among these are the wasps, who hover like attack helicopters, and the slow-moving, ruminant caterpillars who provide delicious food in a rather unappetizing manner. There is the usual assortment of animated-feature supporting characters: vainglorious goofball (Bruce Campbell); sassy, strong woman (Regina King); wise elder (Ricardo Montalban); goofy comic relief (etc.).    The villain is a grotesque exterminator voiced by Paul Giamatti, and the climactic battle against him, though it drags on a bit too long, does have its thrills and surprises. (To appreciate fully the vast disparities between the human and insect points of view, you may want to seek out an IMAX  theater, where “The Ant Bully” will be playing in eye-popping, headache-inducing 3-D.)  In the end, though, “The Ant Bully” is adequate rather than enchanting. Unsure of its ability to charm, it compensates with noise, sentiment and low humor, the usual synthetic stew served  to children — or “pupas,” as the movie calls them.  “The Ant Bully” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).  It has some scenes of combat and threatened extermination that may scare young bug-sympathizers.

Following the mindset of so many recent CG kidpics -- the gabbier the script, the better -- "The Ant Bully" is lovely to look at but a headache to listen to. Visually dazzling cross between "Antz" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" follows a boy forced to live among insects, with extremely noisy and (there's no other word for it) antic results. Launching the pic on Imax screens day-and-date with its July 28 release, Warner Bros. can expect strong family turnout for its third film of the summer, after "Superman Returns" and "Lady in the Water," produced and co-financed by Legendary Pictures.
Adapted by helmer John A. Davis (2001's Oscar-nominated "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius") from John Nickle's children's book, "The Ant Bully" floats the fanciful collectivist notion that humans -- in this case, a moody 10-year-old named Lucas (voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen) -- could learn a thing or two about selflessness and teamwork from the insect world.
Repeatedly terrorized by an oversized neighborhood bully, pipsqueak Lucas turns his feelings of anger and helplessness on an ant colony dwelling on his parents' front lawn. He's unaware the mound is in fact a highly sophisticated community whose six-legged members have apparently evolved the ability to speak English, perform magic and narrate their history through hieroglyphics.
Shortly after Lucas floods their colony with a garden hose (in a strikingly animated sequence), ant wizard Zoc (Nicolas Cage) sneaks into the boy's bedroom and administers a potion that brings him literally down to size. Previously known throughout the colony as the Destroyer, the now-little Lucas is brought before the ant queen (speaking in the regal tones of Meryl Streep), who decrees the boy live among the ants and be schooled in their ways.
Zoc's kindly girlfriend, Hova (Julia Roberts), volunteers to serve as Lucas' teacher and guardian, with help from Kreela (Regina King), a sassy female ant, and Fugax (a hammy Bruce Campbell), a lecherous drone with unusually prominent mandibles. And so begins a series of consistently eye-popping if not especially fresh adventures involving wasp attacks, hungry bullfrogs, a mission to retrieve jelly beans from Lucas' kitchen counter and a climactic battle against an odious exterminator (Paul Giamatti).
Where "Antz" hinged on its Woody Allen-voiced protagonist's embrace of individualism, "The Ant Bully," with its earnest endorsement of unity, conformity and self-sacrifice for the greater good, at times suggests a communist recruitment video. (Is it at all significant that these are red ants?)
Aside from a weakness for spelling out its themes ("You just need to discover the ant within," Hova tells Lucas), the leaden, unamusing script feels obvious and overwritten, with several of the characters spewing belligerent sarcasm on cue. Worst offenders are Zoc and the unsympathetic Lucas, and the actors voicing both characters crank up the volume to obnoxious levels.
As visually sophisticated as it is verbally flatfooted, the pic realizes its magnified environs with a superbly stylized 3-D look and highly imaginative use of color. Backgrounds are stunning, particularly the caverns and tunnels that make up the colony, which have a magnificent, palatial quality. Non-human character detail is especially sharp and expressive, such as the way the wasps' gleaming, pod-like bodies aptly resemble fighter aircraft.
Davis fluidly orchestrates the pic's games with perception and dynamic shifts in scale (an exploding firecracker, seen and heard first at ground level, then from a human's perspective, supplies more wit than anything in the screenplay). Project reteams the helmer with a number of his "Jimmy Neutron" collaborators, including editor Jon Price and composer John Debney, who wrote the memorably tuneful score.
Lucas spends a lot of time running around in the buff after being downsized, but pic cleverly hides the naughty bits. Lack of modesty in the later going, however, was apparently enough to warrant a PG rating.

The Ant Bully is based upon a very short children's book by John Nickle , a beautifully drawn if crudely told tale of a boy named Lucas, who sports Coke-bottle glasses and a propeller skullcap and is picked on by a buzz-cut bully named Sid. Lucas, prone to tantrums and crying jags, decides he too will become a tormentor of those smaller than hein this case, the ants living in the pile in his front yard. This being a book for children, there are myriad lessons to be learned, and Lucas is ultimately reduced to the size of his victims and forced to live and work among the ants. John Davis , the director of Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius , has made small alterations to Nickle's tale in order to render it a feature; he's also cast it with the requisite big names, among them Nic Cage , Julia Roberts , Meryl Streep , and Paul Giamatti .
It still plays very much like a kid's book blown up for the big screen, and it withstands the transition precisely because it doesn't exist to sell things; it's no Happy Meal infomercial, no impulse-item huckster. It exists in a world of its own, one bereft of popular culture save for the handheld video game into which Lucas retreats for companionship. Though it lacks the Pixar  razzle-dazzle of A Bug's Life  or the neurotic charm of Antz , The Ant Bully  isn't meant to play grown-up; it's a kids' movie for kids, and Davis approaches it as though he and his cast are merely storytellers trying to reach kids rather than show-offs trying to impress their parents. It has little of the wink-wink that animated movies include when they're trying to keep the old people awake.
The Ant Bully  has little in common with its bug's-life predecessors; rather, it's sort of the perfect companion to the brand-new Monster House , in which a young boy fears that which he doesn't understand and ultimately comes to befriend the man he always thought meant him harm. There's hope yet for the animated movie, which has been hijacked by marketers looking to off-load plush product on gimme-gimme kids and their put-upon parents. The Ant Bully 's just a little movie about a little guy who turns into a little bug for a little while, and learns some big things in the processand sometimes, a little can go a very long way.
