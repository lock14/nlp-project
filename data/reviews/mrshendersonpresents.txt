         Just as there will always be an England, there will always be a certain kind of English film: the highly polished entertainment, well-acted, genteelly amusing and impeccably turned out.
 
  "Mrs. Henderson Presents" is the latest example of the trend and an especially satisfying one.
 


         






    Directed by the veteran Stephen Frears and featuring fine performances by Bob Hoskins and an irresistible Judi Dench, "Mrs. Henderson Presents" is an artfully sentimentalized valentine to show business in general and musical theater in particular, with the stiff-upper-lip pluckiness of London during the blitz serving as a backdrop.
 
  Not just any kind of musical theater is being celebrated, as it happens, but a curious corner of British theatrical history. That would be the years surrounding World War II when a place in Soho called the Windmill shocked Britain by putting naked young women onstage and getting away with it.
 
  According to Martin Sherman's smartly good-natured script — inspired, we are told, by true events — none of this would have happened without the tempestuous partnership of the wealthy and eccentric Mrs. Laura Henderson (Dench) and a scrappy theatrical manager named Vivian Van Damm (Hoskins).
 
  We meet Mrs. Henderson at the funereal moment in 1937 when Mr. Henderson is no more. The type of woman who says "I'd rather drink ink" when asked if she'd like to view some tapestries, Mrs. Henderson is soon bored to tears with widowhood. On a whim, she buys the Windmill and hires Van Damm to manage the place.
 
  Not that hiring him was easy. "You're 20 minutes late and you're rude," are Van Damm's first words to his new boss, and their relationship goes down and up and down from there. The pair's combative rapport is surprisingly endearing, characterized by her commenting after one of his full-bore sallies that "I have no idea what you're talking about, but I do admire passion."
 
  Inspired by her memories of Paris' Moulin Rouge and a personal tragedy she keeps hidden from Van Damm, it is Mrs. Henderson who comes up with the idea of having performers without any clothes on her stage.
 
  Told things like that aren't done in England, she browbeats London's censor, her old friend Lord Cromer (a delightful Christopher Guest), until he agrees to the show with one condition: It must be a tableaux vivant
, a living painting in which no one is allowed to move.
 
  Much of "Mrs. Henderson Presents" follows familiar patterns: The girls have to be recruited, persuaded to be comfortably nude on stage, and then shielded from the ravages of London under the blitz. All the while Mrs. H. and Van Damm go at it hammer and tongs, unable to live professionally either with or without each other.
 
  Several things make all this extremely palatable, starting with the presence of 14 vintage stage musical numbers, including Benny Goodman's "Goody Goody" and the classically jaunty "Babies of the Blitz."
 
  Also invaluable is the professionalism of director Frears, who never likes to do the same project twice and is coming off the much darker "Dirty Pretty Things."
 
  "Mrs. Henderson Presents" may be old-fashioned, but Frears' touch keeps it as honest as it can be. Best of all, and the heart of "Mrs. Henderson's" appeal, is the performance of Dench in the title role. Though Hoskins is excellent and an essential foil, it is Dench who takes command of the film. The part of "a most exasperating woman" who says whatever's on her mind fits the actress like a tailored Chanel suit. Dench has an Oscar and all kinds of awards behind her, but this tart-tongued role is one of her very best.

It took the blokes of The Full Monty  the entire movie to doff their duds, but Mrs. Henderson Presents  gets right down to the business of naughty bits. In London on the eve of World War II, Laura Henderson (Judi Dench), a widow of wealth and connection, purchases an abandoned theater in the West End. She hires a resident showman, the crusty Dutch Jewish impresario Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins), and together they devise a scheme to pack in the patrons: They'll stage impish theatricals with a sprinkling of topless chorus girls. Surprisingly, there is little local opposition; even the fusty Lord Chamberlain (Christopher Guest) agrees to allow the nudity, provided the girls in question remain motionless on stage. This makes for a friendly romp, and also a dull one: There is dialogue that begs the audience to go tee-hee (''We must have British nipples!'' declares Van Damm), but there is no drama, unless you count the wallflower romance of Hoskins and Dench, doing the Britcom shtick that's becomes her version of autopilot.

 The first thing to know about "Mrs. Henderson Presents," a period British comedy laced with a dash of tragedy and straining with uplift, is that it is inspired by true events. Beginning in the 1930's and continuing through the early part of World War II, the film tracks the history of the famous Windmill Theater in London after it was given new life by a bored widow of means named Laura Henderson. Mrs. Henderson, played by Dame Judi Dench with her familiar mixture of starch and twee, swept the Victorian cobwebs out of the Windmill, located right off Piccadilly Circus, by conceiving of shows featuring live nude girls - tastefully arranged, of course.  Mrs. Henderson was assisted in her campaign to take the full monty to the London boards by a pugnacious stage manager, Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins, who helped produce the film). Apparently, Van Damm's Dutch Jewish heritage both amused and intrigued Mrs. Henderson, who, at least as conceived by the American-born screenwriter Martin Sherman, tends to drop adjectives like "delicious," call the vaguest acquaintance "dear" and utter pronouncements that might seem rather more rude if spoken by anyone less twinkly and wrinkly. On discovering that Van Damm is Jewish, Mrs. Henderson announces that "one must make do." He consequently does call her rude, but he needs a job and signs up, anyway. A strange partnership is born, along with a wafer-thin pretext for a feature-length film.  The rest is the usual song and dance: Mrs. Henderson opens her purse, Van Damm hires the help, and together they put on a really mediocre show. The public eats it up, nonetheless, never more ravenously than after some of the female talent appears onstage wearing nothing but strategic shadows and  even more strategically positioned props. Van Damm invokes Botticelli and classical art, but the young women posed on the half-shell, under a gigantic lamp and inside empty picture frames are strictly from kitsch. Unlike the fan dancers and hootchy-kootchy gals who once drove Mayor Fiorello La Guardia into paroxysms of moralistic rage, forcing padlocks on 42nd Street, the Windmill nudists had to pose stock still. At least the fan dancers could show off their motor skills along with their assets.  The combined forces of Dame Judi's  and Mr. Hoskins's charm and professionalism help obscure the second and only other thing to know about this film: there isn't much going on in "Mrs. Henderson Presents" beyond the odd-couple routine, some gaudy musical numbers and artful nudity. The director, Stephen Frears, keeps things moving at a nice clip and doesn't tarry long during the story's side trips into the maudlin, but neither does he try to put much personality into the proceedings: this is principally the Bob and Judi show,  complete with boisterous fights, silly pantomime (banned from the theater, Mrs. Henderson sneaks in, kitted out in a polar bear suit and Chinese drag) and a rich helping of sentimentalism that might make you gag if it were spooned up by less practiced con artists.  Peter Sellers appeared at the Windmill in 1948, doing vocal impressions and warbling a song written for him by his father, which is enough to suggest a more interesting history than the one imparted here. The story of the British music hall may well be chock-full  of  eccentric aristocrats with stiff upper lips and hearts of gold, English roses who happily open their petals, and plucky young men ready to serve God and king, but how much more agreeable it would be to discover a couple of real people mixed in with the usual shopworn clichés. Watching this reasonably funny, professionally assembled calculation is a little like snuggling up in front of the television with a mug of hot cocoa and a warm blanket. Those who prefer their drinks and recreation spiked would do well to look elsewhere.  "Mrs. Henderson Presents" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bosoms galore.  Mrs.
An unassuming backstage yarn, Mrs. Henderson Presents  overcomes several obstaclesnot the least of which are its torpid title and inevitable comparisons to Topsy-Turvy to win our jaded hearts with its effortless charm. Blame Judi Dench . She plays the title character, a dotty dowager in Depression-era London, as a rude and obstinate snob, equal parts endearing and appalling, engaging in the sort of behavior that passes as eccentric among British upper classes but would be diagnosed as psychopathic in anyone else. (She reacts equally to good and bad situations by interjecting, "Well, isn't that delicious?") Bored by widowhood and her Gosford Park  friends, she suddenly decides to do what any of us would in the same situation: She buys herself a vaudeville theater.
The real-life Mrs. H. hired a music hall veteran, Vivian Van Damm , to run the company; executive producer Bob Hoskins  plays him here as second-fiddle sparring partner, Tracy to her Hepburn. Their Revuedeville  fizzles, and to spice up the act, Van Damm has his showgirls go the full monty, requiring special dispensation from the censorious Lord Cromer (dry, miscast Christopher Guest ). Director Stephen Frears  widely avoids cheap sentiment, even when the story veers into the Blitz and Hoskins's Van Damm starts speechifying about resilience like a tin-pot Churchill. But this is Dame Judi's show. However extraordinary an actor she may be, she cannot conceal the obvious fact that she's having the time of her life here. Isn't that delicious?
