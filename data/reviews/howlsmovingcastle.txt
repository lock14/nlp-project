I suppose even Monet had his off days.
''Howl's Moving Castle," the new film by the Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki, comes on the heels of a pair of flat-out masterpieces: 1997's ''Princess Mononoke" and 2001's ''Spirited Away." It contains 10 times more imagination, wonder, and sheer visual beauty than anything you'll find in Hollywood animation or boilerplate Japanese anime these days. And it's a disappointment -- the first film in which the filmmaker's obsessions have got the better of him.
That said, I can't recommend the film highly enough, since bad Miyazaki is still leagues better than anyone else. Until ''Howl's Moving Castle" starts collapsing under its own weight, it touches on deep wellsprings of myth and fairy tale, and it features one of the more refreshing heroines in modern movies: a girl who is magically transformed into an old lady and decides she likes it. Even after the film devolves into busy shards of private meaning, many of those shards are worth keeping.
One caveat: While ''Castle" will be showing at the Coolidge Corner Theatre and the Kendall Square in both an English-language dub and a subtitled Japanese print (check theater listings for specific times), only the former was made available for preview by Disney, the film's distributor. Because critics weren't able to see the original version, it's impossible to tell whether the translation is at fault. My guess is that it's not, and that the dense layers of symbolism and archetype that overwhelm the story are the filmmaker's doing. (The Loews Boston Common will show only the dubbed version.)
''Castle" takes place in deepest Miyazaki-land: a vaguely European, vaguely late-19th-century world of Victorian architecture, outlying villages, and futuristic airships hovering against mountainous landscapes. The local bogeyman is a young mystic-noble named Howl (voiced by Christian Bale or Takuya Kimura, depending on which version you're seeing), who lives in a ramshackle mansion that traverses the countryside on giant chicken feet. Right there is a detail even the gurus at Pixar
 couldn't come up with.
Howl is rumored to tear the hearts out of young women, but an adolescent hat maker named Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho) isn't scared, even after she bumps into him one dark and stormy night and the handsome wizard takes her for a walk on air, the better to escape several menacing black glop-creatures. Sophie knows she's too plain-looking to attract Howl's interest.
Just to make sure, the vain, fat-swaddled Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall/Akihiro Miwa) lays a curse on the girl that ages her into an 80-year-old and gives her the voice of actress Jean Simmons. After some initial panic, Sophie is unfazed. ''This isn't so bad now, is it?" she says to herself. ''You're still in pretty good shape and your clothes finally fit you."
Leaving home, Sophie moves into Howl's castle and sets herself up as his cleaning lady, befriending the wizard's boy assistant (Josh Hutcherson/Ryunosuke Kamiki) and winning over the castle's governing spirit, a chatty fire demon named Calcifer. I can't imagine what Japanese actor Tasuya Gashuin did with this role, but presumably he didn't envision the straight-outta-Brooklyn flame sprite that Billy Crystal has come up with.
There's more -- lots more. The country is at war with its neighbor, and harsh scenes of air and sea battle punctuate the film, letting Miyazaki once more vent his disgust at mankind's love of bloodshed. The king is being advised by a wizardress named Madam Suliman (Blythe Danner/Haruko Kato), who has turned the local magicians into warrior drones; she's steamed that Howl hasn't followed suit. This may be because he is, in reality, a giant bird-monster. Yes, he is.
A similar plot device cropped up in ''Spirited Away," but there it was organic to the tale. The monstrous alter ego here may again symbolize the hero's immaturity and lack of control, but, really, only if you're writing a thesis paper. In practice it's the first drop in the film's slowly filling bucket of incomprehensibility.
Better, then, to focus on what ''Castle" does magically right. Miyazaki's love of characters who change their natures persists. The evil Witch of the Waste loses her sting and becomes an endearing sidekick; the heroic Howl is revealed to be an insecure wreck. Sophie herself is an unexpected mixture of romantic yearning and hardheaded sensibility, and her age seems to shift with her emotional state. (That's not even metaphor, that's psychological truth.) There's also one purely poetic character: a mute and benignly possessed scarecrow whose outstretched arms hint at Christian allegory and who is always there when needed. What ultimately happens to him neatly sums up where the film has lost its way.
As usual, the visuals bloom with almost fetishistic loveliness. No one does smoke and sky like Miyazaki, or the hush that surrounds a pastoral landscape; no one attends to the detail of a milliner's shop with such baroque, breathtaking detail. At its best, ''Howl's Moving Castle" offers a rich fantasy of adolescent escape, of romance in the old and epic sense. At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish.

         Oscar winner Hayao Miyazaki creates a visually breathtaking fantasy world with 'Howl's Moving Castle.' We hear it before we see it, moving ponderously with heavy, thudding steps: Something big is coming our way. Clanging, banging, wheezing, it's something magical and indescribable, something only Hayao Miyazaki, the great genius of today's golden age of animation, could put on the screen.
 
  What we're hearing is "Howl's Moving Castle," an ambulatory collection of random housing elements that clomps around the countryside on great chicken's feet, an enormous traveling Rube Goldberg contraption raised to the power of 10. It is, like the rest of the film it gives its name to, the product of a fearless and unfettered visual imagination, a cyclone of creativity that, like that enchanted castle, defies simple description.
 


         






    Invariably box office sensations in their native Japan, Miyazaki's films are starting to have an impact in this country as well: his previous hand-drawn work, "Spirited Away," won the 2003 Oscar for best animated feature. His new film is just as magical, just as likely to make viewers feel they've never seen anything quite like it before.
 
  Miyazaki's gift for wonder, an ease with fantasy that makes enchantment second nature, is so great it obliterates differences in language. Playing exclusively at Hollywood's El Capitan, "Howl" is being shown in a Japanese and a dubbed-into-English version overseen by Pixar. Each has its virtues and flaws, with the original understandably feeling more authentic, but in both cases the look is so overpowering we end up barely noticing which language is being used.
 
  Based on a novel of the same name by veteran British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones, "Howl's" story takes place, like Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy, in an alternate universe that is half fantasy, half familiar. Like fellow animator Katsuhiro Otomo's recent "Steamboy," its locale is reminiscent of late 19th century Europe, a world where everyday buildings and costumes share the screen with fantastic Jules Verne-type flying battleships and ordinary people have to cope with the incursions of witches and wizards into their lives.
 
  And like much of Miyazaki's work, including 1997's "Princess Mononoke," the first of his film's to get significant American distribution, "Howl" is centered on the adventures of an intrepid young woman who gradually comes to know her own emotional strength. Its themes — including the powers of love and kindness, the healing properties of the natural world and the horrific evils of war — are strongly held, but they're never allowed to overwhelm the remarkable visuals.
 
  The intrepid woman in question is Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer in the English version), a hard-working, unassuming young person who is perfectly happy quietly sewing hats in a city that is jingoistically preparing for war.
 
  On a walk to visit her sister, Sophie is accosted by a pair of leering soldiers only to be rescued by a dashing young man with long blond hair and a rock star's good looks who unexpectedly shows her how to fly through the air and steals her heart in the process.
 
  That turns out to be the wizard Howl (well voiced by current "Batman" Christian Bale), quite handsome and well aware of it, who lives in that castle and is reputed to literally eat the hearts of beautiful young women. He's so cool he doesn't break a sweat as he deals with sinister blob men who morph out of walls unaccountably wearing sporty straw boaters.
 
  Those blobs are under the command of the sinister, opera-diva-sized Witch of the Waste (a terrific Lauren Bacall), who has enough of a crush on Howl to resent his attentions to Sophie. She puts a terrible curse on the young woman, turning her overnight into a 90-year-old crone (now voiced by Jean Simmons) who is so terrified by the change that she leaves the city to seek her fortune and end the curse.
 
  Age seems to increase Sophie's energy, not diminish it. She is soon being helped by a living scarecrow she calls Turniphead, gaining entrance to that castle, and coming to terms with a cranky fire demon named Calcifer who has a mysterious symbiotic relationship to Howl. (The demon is voiced by Billy Crystal, and having him resort to mood-destroying Catskills shtick of the "Hey, lady" variety is the dubbed version's only major miscalculation.) More important, Sophie comes to share space with Howl, who, against expectation, turns out to be someone who needs her help as much as she needs his.
 
  Miyazaki, who writes his own scripts, prefers a narrative structure that takes its time and is difficult to pin down. "Howl's" storyline moves at an idiosyncratic pace, detouring to seemingly unrelated points before suddenly erupting into pure magic. The film follows a through line that is emotional, not logical, becoming a story beyond words we understand with our hearts more than our minds.
 
  Parse it any way you like, Miyazaki's gifts as an animator place him in a category of his own. To see his latest film is to be somehow reminded of Italians who could hear Verdi's operas as soon as they were sung or English readers who could experience the novels of Dickens episode by episode.
 
  Like those fortunate folk, we can have the excitement and joy of seeing new work by one of the greatest animators who ever lived just as soon as he creates it. Future generations will envy us our luck.

There's no confusing the wizards and goblins who populate the dazzling animated adventure Howl's Moving Castle  with their relatives from Harry Potter's branch of the wiz biz. The conjurer named Howl  part romantic human dreamboat who fancies emerald earrings and tight pants, part massive bird  may be voiced with whispery gravity, in the English-language version, by Christian Bale (soon to be whispering gravely as Batman). But the worldview, the sense of childlike fun shaded with adult melancholy, and the joyful, serene attention to visual oddity and wordless beauty could only be made in Japan. And, specifically, made by Hayao Miyazaki.
When the peerless master of hand-drawn animation last cavorted with the supernatural, in Spirited Away , the director unfurled his marvelous tale from the perspective of a child, true to the real fears and equally real thrills experienced by a little girl learning how to separate from her parents. With Howl 's, Miyazaki brings the wisdom of his 64 years to a story, dense with complications, about a workaholic teenage hatmaker named Sophie who comes into a true appreciation of love, passion, playfulness, and even politics, as well as of her own beauty, only after she is transformed by an evil spell into a stooped and wrinkled 90-year-old woman. (Long story short, Sophie's meet-cute encounter with Howl on a city street irks the jealous Witch of the Waste, a mountainous matron of a competitor for Howl's affections. This sorceress boasts the look of Marx Brothers regular Margaret Dumont and the imperious, Fancy Feast voice of Lauren Bacall.)
In other words, maturity is achieved working backward from experienced seniority rather than forward from wide-eyed youth. And in moments of developmental breakthrough, the young Sophie reemerges out of the contours of the old one. (Emily Mortimer voices young Sophie with a combination of Cinderella pluck and Notting Hill class; Jean Simmons gives old Sophie a lovable layering of tolerance and self-confidence.)
But enough about developmental psychology  how about that humongous castle?! Howl's mobile home heaves and clanks around the countryside (a landscape of indeterminate Euro provenance, over which a war of indeterminate provocation is about to be fought against an indeterminate enemy) on intrepid mechanized feet that appear to be part steel, part chicken. The fixer-upper is cobbled together from a million wheezing parts, the whole thing running on flames from a combustible blob named Calcifer (voiced by Billy Crystal). And naturally the ambulatory domicile is accepted by the populace as part of the regular way of doing things. Because, unlike the Muggles-vs.-Hogwarts crowd, the inhabitants of Miyazaki's enchanted universe understand that spirits are as much a part of everyday life as the fishmongers and soldiers and airplanes crowding the confines of the movie frame in set-piece scenes of spectacular detail.
And curses happen, many of them cast by Madame Suliman (Blythe Danner), resident magician and foreign-policy meddler in service to the king. A surfeit of mishaps and catastrophes accrue, requiring bravery along with a very Asian sense of acceptance. Unlikely alliances are made, primarily among squatters in the moving castle itself, as old Sophie's competence and unflappability work their own kind of domestic magic; even a barkless dog has his day, providing sweet diversionary canine silliness during times of darkest heroic crisis. As Howl's Moving Castle  makes ravishingly clear, coming into one's own is the most heroic  and magical  experience of all.


Japanese animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki dips again into the cavernous well of a vibrant imagination with "Howl's Moving Castle," which departs from Asian folklore and spirit worlds to enter a European storybook universe populated by witches and wizards. Even more than in the director's Oscar-winning "Spirited Away," the narrative motor roars ahead in the opening hour and is more erratic thereafter, suggesting further streamlining and more meticulous translation might yield rewards. But the tireless volley of ideas and inventions make this a delight that should connect with kids and adults in both dubbed and original-language versions.
While it's based on popular British children's author Diana Wynne Jones' 2000 novel, Miyazaki's latest film remains true to the animator's abiding fascination with radical metamorphoses and dreamlike odysseys of self-discovery and empowerment. Setting is in an unspecified time that appears to be the late 19th century and a melange of fabled burgs that's part Mittel European and part British harbor town. But the treatment is very much fueled by an anime sensibility that often seems unleashed from the subconscious rather than appropriating a more Western fairy tale feel.
Withdrawn 18-year-old Sophie toils making hats in her late father's shop in a town where the frequent presence of young wizard Howl and his moving castle are a source of curiosity and fear for the locals. As she's being hit on by soldiers during an outing, Sophie unexpectedly is rescued by Howl, who spouts wings and airlifts her to safety. They are observed, however, by oozing blob figures that report to the Witch of the Waste, an obese hag trussed up in matronly glamour-wear. The jealous witch later appears in the hat shop and transforms Sophie into a wizened crone.
Sophie flees town into the mountainous countryside, getting help and guidance from a turnip-headed scarecrow who bounces around like a pogo stick. Looking for shelter from the rain, she boldly enters Howl's castle.
One of the most dazzling of the film's many creations, the castle is like something out of Monty Python via Hieronymus Bosch: a massive tangle of mini-cottages, smokestacks, cogs, wheels, turrets and prehistoric wings, carried aloft by huge bird-like feet.
Inside, Sophie meets Calcifer, a cheeky fire demon trapped into Howl's service -- perhaps the most ingeniously animated character from Wynne Jones' book. She also meets Markl, a young boy who mans the four-way door that leads to a variety of kingdoms.
Sparked by her fury at the witch's spell, Sophie finds new vigor and strength of character. She takes charge of establishing order in the house and assumes a key role as Howl is summoned by the king to aid the homeland's war effort.
Despite the zeppelin bombers and battleships plaguing the country, the war never really becomes a significant factor in the narrative, fading in and out of focus a little too distractedly.
Likewise, Miyazaki's story sense unravels into a confusion of events as the king's witch, Madam Suliman, makes her malevolent powers felt, while Howl struggles to transition between human and bird form and Sophie's growing love for the wizard pushes her to heroic lengths that help expose the true form beneath her acquired wrinkles. What's missing perhaps, is a more driving sense of Sophie's quest to regain her youth.
But despite an overextended second half in which narrative coherency is not always the strongest suit, the film consistently exhilarates with its wit, beauty, eye-popping color and wealth of detail. There's often a disarming simplicity to the images -- Sophie and Markl sitting on the shore of a lake amid quasi-Impressionist fields of flowers -- as well as an impish spirit to the humor -- Calcifer struggling to stay alight by hanging onto a log, or the Witch of the Waste sagging like Jell-O as she climbs the steps of the king's palace.
While Miyazaki has stated that his challenge here was to create animation for old people, Sophie is a feisty lead character whose appearance as a toothless hag for much of the action never disguises her young heart and mind.
A vain pretty boy who looks like a bejeweled glam-rocker with his harlequin coat and blond shag, Howl very much plays second fiddle to Sophie, quaking in fear of his rivals' sorcery. The Witch of the Waste is a fabulous figure, both in imperious mode and when reduced to a benign old tub of lard; and Heen, an asthmatic dog that escapes Suliman to be Sophie's sidekick has the sly humor of a classic Disney critter.
Given the director's distinctly Nipponese stamp on the material, Japanese voice work never jars with the Euro-featured characters.
With cel animation steadily disappearing, the skill of Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli stable at incorporating digital technology and computer graphics -- characters are hand-drawn and then scanned digitally; backgrounds are 100% hand-drawn and hand-painted -- while retaining the look of a traditional toon makes the peerless Japanimator's films seem a vanishing art form to be cherished.
And while this adaptation of another writer's work doesn't quite live up to the soaring flights of imagination in Miyazaki originals like "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke," it remains an entertainment full of wonder and charm.
Japanese release through Toho is set for Nov. 20, while Disney has yet to announce plans for U.S. release, having first option on rights through Buena Vista's overall deal with Studio Ghibli.

Oscar winner, New Yorker  profilee, and international name-above-the-title, Hayao Miyazaki  is the one-man standing answer to the American system of corporatized feature animation, a whimsical auteur amid studio-branding homogenization. Smelling like a string of miracles, Miyazaki's best filmsincluding Spirited Away , Kiki's Delivery Service , and the new-to-DVD Porco Rosso are fearsomely strange but nonetheless beloved on every continent. The Disney -Miramax  habit of redubbing them with showboating Hollywood  pros always threatens to handicap the movies' stateside fortunes as well, but the master's intoxicating irrationality has proven triumphant.
Howl's Moving Castle  comes laden with burdensincluding Billy Crystal , borscht belting the vocals for a fire demon. But Miyazaki's sensibility shrugs them off, manifesting yet again as a subconscious chaos in which anything can happen but everything has emotional coherence; here as in other Miyazakis, judgments are suspended, character is always in flux, and forgiveness is in titanic supply. Loosely adapted from a popular 1986 teen fantasy novel by Brit genre priestess Diana Wynne Jones , the film airily occupies a hybrid past, half fin de siècle Ruritania, half WW II siege (Wynne Jones was five in 1939), and half Tolkienian magic play. Giant battle planes rain bombs on Tudor Euro-cities but also unleash swarms of flying war demons with pig snouts and top hats to combat intervening wizards.
The titular castle is a groaning, ramshackle house on mechanical chicken legs, held together by a griping spirit (Crystal) and home to a petulant, mysterious wizard named Howl (Christian Bale ). It's where the requisite Miyazaki heroine, Sophie (Emily Mortimer ), comes for help once a spiteful witch curses her with elderliness, but because she cannot mention the curse outright, Sophie (now Jean Simmons ) becomes the castle's crotchety housemaid. Sophie's plight quickly becomes a secondary mattersometimes she seems to have forgotten her younger self altogether, and her later fluctuations in age go wholly unnoticedbecause the war is raging, the king's syrupy minions are hunting for Howl, the castle slowly collects an ad hoc family under Sophie's commonsensical guidance, and age-oblivious romance inevitably takes root.
For a cartoon, it's not an easy readthe metaphysics are often sketchy and arbitrary, transformations are a tad inconsistent, emphatic crises or coups sometimes end up meaning little. But that's part and parcel with Miyazaki's narrative personality: Cause and effect are less reliable than dreams and empathy, and villains are treated so charitably they're not villains at all. It's a utopian vision of a calamitous world, and Miyazaki's evocation of old-school wara night city during a scarifying blitz, a crippled battleship drifting into a civilian harbor, behemoth vessels looming and roaring with imaginary engine workcan be awesomely discomfiting. Of course, the film's relationship with real-world sights and textures is dazzling (within, at least, the facial-minimalist conventions of anime). In any case, I haven't in years seen an American film, live action or not, that has attended so carefully to the details of aging, gravity, destruction, and atmosphere.
Howl's Moving Castle  is being released in subtitled and dubbed versions; knowing only what has been visited upon it in the name of reading-allergic American children, I'd recommend sticking to the original. (To be fair, Jean Simmons and Lauren Bacall , as the Witch of the Waste, muster potent aural assaults.) But either way the film is an organic, childlike wonder, fabulously unpredictable and seethingly inventive.
