         "Asylum" deftly sets up a valid premise for a taut psychological thriller only to dissipate in a series of improbable developments and drawn-out anticlimaxes. Patrick Marber and Chrysanthy Balis' script from Patrick McGrath's novel affords Natasha Richardson, Ian McKellen, Marton Csokas and Hugh Bonneville plenty of opportunities to pull out all the stops under David Mackenzie's direction, but they're swept over by a tidal wave of lurid, increasingly implausible and depressingly old-fashioned melodramatics.
 
  A throwback to vintage "women's pictures" of the '40s and '50s spiced up by a lot of steamy R-rated sex, "Asylum" ultimately is done in by an absurd passion for symmetry, which in effect dictates that despite the epic havoc that ensues, it pretty much ends as it begins.
 


         






    It's 1959, and Dr. Max Raphael (Bonneville), his wife, Stella (Richardson), and their small son, Charlie (Gus Lewis), arrive at a vast Broadmoor-like Victorian-era mental institution, a virtual brick-and-mortar fortress village. (It's actually High Royds, a mental institution that operated in Yorkshire between 1888 and 2003 and is being recycled into luxury condos.)
 
  Max has been named deputy superintendent over longtime employee Dr. Peter Cleave (McKellen) and is entirely focused on succeeding the current superintendent (Joss Ackland), who has announced his intention to retire. Such single-mindedness on Max's part is not a smart move considering that Stella is a restless, boldly sensual beauty, a standout among dowdy, conventional staff wives, dutiful but chafing under her obligations as a proper spouse to her husband.
 
  When a trusted patient (Csokas) is assigned to rebuild a dilapidated greenhouse in the Raphaels' backyard, the attraction between Stella and Csokas' seductive Edgar, a sculptor who killed his wife in a fit of jealous rage, is immediate, and it's clear that it will erupt into an all-consuming passion.
 
  From the start it's also equally obvious that Cleave, Edgar's attending doctor, is a smooth, insinuating master manipulator not above deliberately throwing the susceptible lovers into each other's path. Possibly a repressed homosexual, possibly craving Stella for himself — or both — Cleave is a compulsive, dangerous control freak who may be every bit as mad as his patients.
 
  There are lots of directions in which Stella and Edgar's predicament could go, and "Asylum" seems determined to try them all before it's over, at long last. It's too over-the-top, too lurid and at times simply too silly to represent any kind of valid commentary on the repressive '50s or the way in which institutions tend to destroy rather than cure. "Far From Heaven," which nailed '50s angst to perfection, "Asylum" could not be farther from.

Nothing wrecks the mood of a high-toned British period piece about erotic obsession quicker than an unintentional laugh. In which case, prepare for Asylum  to be derailed by snorts in all the wrong places, despite the participation of Natasha Richardson as an unhappy 1950s  housewife and Ian McKellen as her Machiavellian shrink. In this adaptation of Patrick McGrath's  novel, directed by David Mackenzie (Young Adam ), Richardson plays Stella, living on the grounds of a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, where her psychiatrist husband (Hugh Bonneville) has just taken a post.
One minute Stella is an aloof faculty spouse and the next she's in sexual thrall to an inmate, Edgar (Marton Csokas, the near-sighted woman's Clive Owen), who has been locked up for years on charges of murdering his wife in a fit of jealousy. The upshot of this foolish choice by a smart woman is lots of R-rated sex with an emphasis on lingerie. (In the wings, McKellen looks skeptical.) On the grounds of an asylum, you see, these two voraciously self-destructive creatures find a very different kind of haven together. Don't laugh.

 In the dreary, claustrophobic drama "Asylum," Natasha Richardson plays a married Englishwoman who falls for a loony-bin hunk. This turns out to be an unwise if moderately entertaining move. As Stella, the 1950's bored wife, inattentive mother and unhinged adulteress at the center of this story, Ms. Richardson initially affects the vacant mien of cinema's classically oppressed women. Like the lonely wives and widows of untold Hollywood melodramas, Stella is a martyr in heels and pearls. She burns from within; we, in turn, wait for her to be consumed in flames.  That wish is granted, after a fashion, in David Mackenzie's adaptation of Patrick McGrath's novel "Asylum." Much like the book, Mr. Mackenzie's film opens with Stella, her psychiatrist husband, Max (Hugh Bonneville), and 10-year-old son, Charlie (Gus Lewis), driving onto the sprawling grounds of a high-security psychiatric hospital as grim as a tomb. Tucked into a home right next to the wards, the small family soon settles into a routine. Max tends to his patients, Charlie larks about the estate, while Stella fretfully smokes one cigarette after another, further polluting the already foul air. With a housekeeper at her disposal, Stella has plenty of time to blacken her lungs, especially since she displays little interest in the usual diversions - books, music, art, other people.  Stella does tend to her garden, as might be expected from a character that originated in a novel, where such overweening symbolism often works better than it does on the screen. Mr. McGrath's morbid book has its attractions, namely a sense of dread gurgling under the controlled prose and a narrator of great and perverse unreliability. The novel's notable achievement is its juxtaposition of that dry, clinical narration with shocking, at times grotesque human behavior for which such language proves profoundly inadequate. "Asylum" is a story about mad love, but it also serves as a rather unsubtle critique of psychiatric arrogance. (Mr. McGrath's father, it seems worth mentioning, was a well-regarded superintendent at the Broadmoor Asylum, the infamous British institute for the criminally insane.)  As sometimes happens in the British countryside, Stella meets the man whose rough hands and ways will change her life, the mental patient Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas). Institutionalized for hammering his wife to a pulp, Edgar has been separated from women for years while under the supervision of one of the hospital psychiatrists, Cleave (Ian McKellen). But when Stella agrees to go cheek to cheek with Edgar at a hospital dance, where staff members and patients freely intermingle, his monkish life takes a radical turn. For her part, the girl can't help it: lost in a crowd of dowdy staff wives whose flower-print dresses make them look like chintz sofas, Stella can only stand out in her sleek black sheath. It's a look designed for seduction and, you suspect, for grief.  Soon enough there are panting trysts, principally in the dilapidated conservatory Edgar is repairing, a place meant for orchids and, as Mr. McGrath writes, "other delicate tropical plants." Stella blooms, as it were, and soon begins to look somewhat like exotic flora herself, what with all the racy lace and satin undergarments she takes to wearing. Save for the panting, an occasional teardrop and the odd scream (Stella is sleeping with a wife-killer, after all), Ms. Richardson plays her role with little affect, perhaps in deference to her character's demonstrative lingerie. As to the men: Mr. Bonneville keeps his upper lip stiff as Mr. Csokas goes for glower. Mr. McKellen, meanwhile, creeps around the edges of the story like a spider. He seems to be having fun.  Mr. Mackenzie worked similar terrain in his last film, "Young Adam," yet another blood-flecked story featuring joyless sex and all manner of lunatics, and based on a novel. Mr. McGrath's book is more complex than "Young Adam," and this may explain why "Asylum" doesn't translate as well to the screen. What makes the book shivery is not simply the dissonance between the overheated story and the cool narration, but that the psychiatrist narrator, Cleave, may be as unstable as Edgar. The screenwriters, Patrick Marber ("Closer") and Chrysanthy Balis, dispense with the shrink's narration, taking the story out of the key of madness and into the key of melodrama. What remains is a routine soap about a woman victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men.  "Asylum" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes partial female nudity, sexual clinches and some violence.

A proper British wife, chafing from boredom and frustration at her husband's psychiatric hospital in northern England, succumbs to bottled-up passions with a patient and ruins everyone's lives in overly plotted erotic drama "Asylum." Much anticipated teaming of "Young Adam" helmer David Mackenzie with "Closer" playwright Patrick Marber, working from a novel by "Spider" author Patrick McGrath, yields decidedly mixed results. Planned Stateside rollout in early March will attract fans of this sort of thing, but project certainly won't set prurient tongues wagging the way "Young Adam" and "Closer" have. Pic will probably play hotter elsewhere, with strong ancillary based on subject and cast.
It's 1959, and a power struggle at the imposing titular institution has resulted in superintendent Straffen (Joss Ackland) passing over bachelor administrator Dr. Peter Cleave (Ian McKellen) in favor of new hire Max Raphael (Hugh Bonneville). Arriving with wife Stella (Natasha Richardson) and son Charlie (Gus Lewis), the controlling Max makes it immediately apparent that whatever fondness existed between him and the sullen Stella is long gone.
While working in the garden one day to stave off boredom, Stella meets patient Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas), who has befriended Charlie in the course of refurbishing the gone-to-seed greenhouse. Handsome and haunted, Edgar's an artist who suffers from severe personality disorders with flashes of morbid jealousy. Oh, and he also, in a fit of rage, beat his wife to death with a hammer, cut off her head and gouged out her eyes.
Of course it's lust at first sight for Stella and Edgar, and after dancing together primly at the patient-staff ball, she determinedly applies lipstick and marches down to the greenhouse where the two have wordless, intense, R-rated sex. A brisk montage illustrates how Stella balances the two extremes of her new double life.
Though dark clouds gather rapidly and rather obviously, to roughly the 40-minute mark pic has laid out provocative treatises involving gradations of control and the gravitational pull of lust. But as story rushes through each complexity, cumulative effect is one of breathless confusion: Charlie spies Edgar sneaking out of Stella's bedroom, Edgar escapes, Max is fired in disgrace, and Stella joins the fugitive in London. Meanwhile, Edgar is prone to bouts of jealous rage and beats his assistant Nick (Sean Harris) at the smallest provocation. Some at Berlin fest preem saw it as a multileveled treatise on control and lust, while others found it as stiff as the British upper lips on display.
Production has been as lengthy and chaotic as the story. Liam Neeson was set at one point to star alongside real-life spouse Richardson, and Stephen King took a shot at an apparently very different draft that wasn't used. Pic finally wrapped in mid-October 2003, and some 20 minutes of footage have reportedly been excised from the original cut. Telltale signs of these changes remain: Marber now shares the scribe credit, as does editor Colin Monie, while pic's fast pace comes at the expense of scenes such as Edgar and Charlie's bonding; Nick's eventual fate; and more of Cleaves' motivation, which would have anchored the story's elusive logic via a more detailed plotline.
Absent the kind of fearless sex that could have drawn the crowds, Richardson and Csokas are left to emote various degrees of coiled and smoldering, respectively. McKellen seems increasingly aware of just how out of left field his doctor's final revelations are, while Bonneville is once again fine in his second film in two days of Berlin competish, following Regis Wargnier's "Man to Man." The widescreen lensing of Giles Nuttgens, cinematographer of "Young Adam," leads the impressive tech package. Pic was shot in and around the since-shuttered Royds facility in northern England.

The terrifying paralysis of clinical depression has inspired a trove of bracing memoirs but has yet to produce its definitive moviethe darkness visible has suffused films by Bergman, Bresson, Cronenberg, and others, but usually as a secondary symptom of a larger social, mental, or metaphysical malaise. Getting inside the head of the stunned and dulled adulteress Stella Raphael  in his 1996 novel Asylum , Patrick McGrath  describes "the numbness muffling the world and turning everything colorless and indistinct." Perhaps any film that penetrates this dense fog risks fading into gray oblivion.
Painted in a chiaroscuro of dusky blues and browns (recalling his assured previous feature Young Adam ), David Mackenzie 's film adaptation, from a screenplay by Closer  scribe Patrick Marber , plods dutifully through McGrath's events. Stella (Natasha Richardson ) arrives with uptight husband Max (Hugh Bonneville ) and their young son at a mental institution outside London, where Max has been named the new deputy superintendent. Neglected at home and bored insensate by her sparse domestic duties and fellow doctors' wives, Stella drinks too much, smokes while staring into space, and trades significant glances with a strapping patient, the Heathcliffian sculptor Edgar (Marton Csokas ). Like Madame Bovary, Stella lacks imagination but cocoons into her fantasy life; despite her lust object's romantic history (Edgar bludgeoned his wife to death and mutilated her corpse) and, perhaps more pertinently, his sexual stamina (their first bonk lasts approximately 5.3 seconds), Stella soon semi-wittingly abets his escape and is hurrying off to London at every opportunity to grind away in his grotty East End hideout, with predictable and mechanically dispensed consequences.
For a film that comprises erotomania, psychosis, several types of unnatural death, andhorror of horrorsprofessional exile in northernmost Wales , Asylum  is most shocking for its relentless enervation. As did the masterful McGrath adaptation Spider , the film eschews a voice-over in adapting a first-person narration (that of Edgar's shrink, Dr. Cleave, here a cipher given unwritten dimensions by Ian McKellen ), but instead of daring an expressionist immersion in madness and despair as David Cronenberg  did, Mackenzie and Marber opt for an anonymous viewpoint of clinical detachment, which generates about the same psychodramatic tension as reading the DSM-IV . Marber's grisliest tweak to the novel carries an echo (probably inadvertent) of Polanski's The Tenant , but without the macabre frisson; like a patient who's reached her nadir, Asylum  cannot sustain affect.
