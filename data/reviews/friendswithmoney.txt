"Friends With Money" is another finely etched, intelligently acted social comedy from Nicole Holofcener, whose first two features were "Walking and Talking" and "Lovely & Amazing." Holofcener has made only two movies in the 10 years since her first, and I wish she worked more. She's one of America's most casually perceptive filmmakers, and her movies are smart and true about the ways people treat one another and themselves.
There is a lot of modern American life in her movies, too, from popular culture of the moment to relationship trends, and it gives the films the kind of freshness that, nowadays, you really only find on very good television shows. Holofcener writes as well as Albert Brooks at his best, and her finesse with actors is as assured as James L. Brooks's on his TV and film projects from 20 and 30 years ago.
In fact, the four women in "Friends With Money" could be characters on a sitcom. Holofcener's script uses familiar TV geometry that episodically intertwines the four women's lives in order to dramatize the extremely real reasons people come together and grow apart. Here, status is the lure and the repellent. The film is set in Los Angeles and focuses on three well-off women -- Frances McDormand, Catherine Keener, and Joan Cusack -- their husbands, and their unmarried pothead friend, Olivia, whom Jennifer Aniston plays in the most relaxed movie performance of her life.
Olivia is an occupational drifter. She quit her job as a teacher at a posh prep school (the kids made fun of how rich she wasn't) and now she cleans houses and wanders into the city's department stores for free beauty cream, samples being a nifty motif throughout the film.
Her friends pity her, but gently. In one early scene, the four of them get together for dinner, with their husbands, and the subject of philanthropy comes up. All the couples give money away. (A banquet to fight Lou Gehrig's disease is in the offing.) But Franny and Matt (Cusack and Greg Germann), being the wealthiest of the group, just donated $2 million dollars to a school, and Jane (McDormand), a caustic fashion designer, is shocked. Why not give it to Olivia -- who's mortified by the idea?
This conversation is funny and strange at the same time. These are characters talking explicitly about money in a way people in movies never do. It also establishes very well the tricky tone Holofcener plans to maintain throughout: a fascination with how people behave that never turns into an indictment of their behavior. Accordingly, the film walks a line between discretion and brutal truth.
In "Friends With Money," wealth is a matter of fact not preoccupation, even if, like race or beauty, it's an unreliable shortcut to explain somebody. Are Franny and Matt happy because they have more money than everybody else? Is Olivia less happy because she has none? Success is a smoke screen, too. Christine (Keener) and David (Jason Isaacs) are screenwriting partners who've decided to build another story on their house, without even realizing that their marriage is collapsing and their neighbors hate them.
Another filmmaker might have taken a page from, say, Luis Buñuel's book and given us a scathing bourgeois satire. But the film's accomplishment is that it's not about class as much as it's about character in the context of class, in much the same way that Agnes Jaoui's "The Taste of Others" and "Look at Me" were. The movie isn't full of toothsome yuppie pornography. There aren't a lot of shots of things. The houses are nice, but the folks living in them are the point.
Out of pity, Franny sets up Olivia with her personal trainer (Scott Caan), who accompanies her on cleaning jobs, then asks for a cut. Because she doesn't even know what she's worth, she pays him. The mad, hurt, and confused look on Aniston's face the second time it happens is one for the Blindsided Date Hall of Fame. The film's most intriguing character is Jane's English husband, Aaron (Simon McBurney), a clotheshorse whom everyone thinks is gay. Really, his good taste and sensitivity are just extremely incriminating, according to our cynical, small-minded world.
The characters in "Friends With Money" are so fully developed that they seem to take on lives of their own. If there's a problem with this naturalist approach, it's that many of these people spend the film looking inward. When Christine literally sees her life from a neighbor's window, you realize the movie could use more of that kind of revelation. This didn't seem true about Holofcener's other two movies, which, more than "Friends With Money," seemed plugged into a relatable world bigger than the cities they were set in.
You're also worried about the depth of the bond between the women. When it's clear, for instance, that the increasingly hostile Jane is losing her mind, why does no one call her on it? Maybe it's easier to "fight" to cure ALS than your friends.
And are we really to believe that Aniston is out of shape with that body tone? If marijuana will do that, I might have to cancel my gym membership. Still, my nitpicking is otherwise a testament to Holofcener's uncommon keenness as a writer, director, and lover of people. I complain because I care.

Frank talk about money is the last taboo, a prohibition with a particularly weird effect on women. The same brassy babe who will describe her sex life in fearless gynecological detail gets all demure when it comes to  describing her financial bottom line, even to her closest friends. And how she feels about that money  whether it's a lot or a little, whether earned or bestowed, and whether she envies Friend X's suspected greater wealth or knows with smug satisfaction that she's better off than Friend Y  is more likely to remain a secret than her kinkiest bedroom fantasy. Writer-director Nicole Holofcener, whose previous two features, Lovely &  Amazing  (2002) and Walking and Talking  (1996), also offer insights into neurotic gynocentricity, appreciates this peculiar twist in female wiring. And she seizes on the subject with sisterly rue, donating the best moments in Friends With Money  to a dissection of feminine net-worth envy.
To be clear, Holofcener is talking about bank- account competition in Los Angeles (where wealth loves to preen) among an elite quartet of uncommon women who will never have to take the bus in their own City of Tangible Goods. Not even Olivia (Jennifer Aniston), by far the most struggling of the foursome in Holofcener's setup and ostensibly the chick around whom the three more affluent friends cluck, is that poor: A former teacher at a tony private school, she quit her salaried position for unspecified reasons of malaise and is currently self-employed as a freelance housekeeper, relieving dull hours spent with a vacuum cleaner with more exciting moments spent with a vibrator found in a client's bedside drawer. Or as one friend bluntly puts it, ''She's unmarried, she's a pothead, and she's a maid.'' Christine (stalwart Holofcener muse Catherine Keener) frets about her pal to husband David (Jason Isaacs), Christine's status-conscious partner in lucrative screenwriting and floundering marriage. Franny (Joan Cusack), the girlfriend happiest in motherhood and marriage (to Greg Germann as appreciative hubby Matt) and most cushioned by wealth, worries about Olivia with gentle distraction when not working out with a personal trainer or looking for worthy causes on which to bestow big bucks. Meanwhile, Jane (Frances McDormand), a successful fashion designer married to supportive, ambiguously gay Aaron (British theater director Simon McBurney)  irresistible in his excitement about cashmere and Nip/Tuck   doesn't so much worry as fume about injustice everywhere: In her early 40s, she's so sick and tired of life's daily frictions that she can't be bothered to wash her hair. (In an excitingly offbeat cast, McDormand stands out, loose and lively.)
Back, though, to Olivia and that vibrator. The Friend Without Money also likes to hoard free samples of pricey face creams, she dates a loser (conveniently, he's Franny's trainer) who treats her shabbily, and she persists in phone-stalking a married man with whom she had a brief affair months ago. This adult woman in her 30s, in other words, acts out like a kook (to put it kindly), and occasionally like one of those crazy girls on gently transgressive cable TV-type fare like Sex and the City  or Six Feet Under .
Holofcener, by the by, has directed multiple episodes of both. And therein lies the movie's fault line. Introducing Friends With Money  when it opened the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, fest head Geoffrey Gilmore praised the pic as a superior example of Sundance quality, and a sterling specimen of quirky Amerindie moviemaking at its most polished (and female-powered, too!); he also hitched the festival's wagon of reputation to the filmmaker's stardom, noting that Holofcener is an alumna of the Sundance Institute who premiered her first feature, a film lab project, in Park City. There is, indeed, a discernible clarity to the actual filmmaking here, and an attractive feminine wit evident in the artistry. But there is also a manufactured symmetry, an every-gal's-got-issues roundness, an HBO sitcomitude to the movie that undercuts its own observational intelligence.
It might not have been as easy for the scriptwriter to contrast Olivia with her richer friends for comic effect had the Bridget Jonesy singleton only been an ''average'' working girl, i.e., holding a decent, unexceptional job. And a less pitiable Olivia might have been less satisfying for Aniston, since the actress seems hell-bent on playing women who haven't been granted the happiness they by rights deserve. Such a ''real'' Olivia with wallet issues would, however, have explained how the foursome could be friends in the first place. She might have pushed the movie from the territory of Carrie Bradshaw to that of Edith Wharton. She might have inspired a less predetermined Sundance indie. Or is that, too, taboo?

 IN the final scene of Nicole Holofcener's "Friends With Money," a bittersweet comedy about the drama of being alive — with and without a fistful of dollars — the actress Jennifer Aniston summons up a small smile that looks a lot like a frown. It would be a stretch to say that at that moment her character, a vaguely depressed pot-smoking housekeeper named Olivia, is actually happy, but neither is she exactly unhappy. It's just that she, much as the rumpled man tucked into bed next to her says about himself, has "some issues, you know ... problems."  Most of Olivia's problems involve money, though she also has serious man troubles (she doesn't have one) and career woes (ditto). What she does have are three older married friends — played by Frances McDormand, Catherine Keener and Joan Cusack — who live in degrees of cocooned comfort in the kinds of Los Angeles neighborhoods where the only people of color are either taking care of the children or white folks working on their Malibu tans. Unlike her friends, Olivia seems to expect little from life and never seems surprised when that's what she gets. Having left her high school teaching job (the brats tossed her quarters for food), she now cleans up after other people, restoring to their lives a sense of order lacking in her own.  As might be expected, "Friends With Money" is about friendship and money and about how having one sometimes, maybe always, interferes with the other. Materialism and its discontents is a favorite American worry, but with its melancholic low-frequency buzz and roster of navel-gazers, this film feels particularly contemporary. Ms. Holofcener never suggests that her characters need to get out of the house and start ladling chowder down at the local soup kitchen; even  the cars in this film don't wear peace signs. But she obviously wants to say something about people who have too much of everything for their own good.  (And clearly knocking about  the movie business for years, as well as Los Angeles, has given her plenty of material.)  Maybe it's the sprawl, but like many Los Angeles-based stories, including Ms. Holofcener's last film, "Lovely and Amazing," this one radiates in many different directions at once. In addition to Olivia, there's Jane, a splenetic clothing designer (a sensational Ms. McDormand), and Christine, one  half of an unhappily married screenwriting team (Ms. Keener). Both women appear to be struggling through what Gail Sheehy called the "forlorn 40's," while the third married friend, Franny (Ms. Cusack), a stay-at-home mom with full-time help, has apparently skipped that passage and gone straight to heaven with a fat bank account, a vigorous sex life with her own husband (Greg Germann) and two kids who seem like pleasant afterthoughts. Rarely has Ms. Cusack's googly-eyed, otherworldly vibe seemed so right for a role.  One of those films in which the narrative emerges from the characters and through the performances, "Friends With Money" unfolds as a succession of vignettes organized around meals, shopping trips and lonely nights, and is punctuated by some laugh-out-loud bursts and a few punches to the gut. Ms. Holofcener is a first-rate portraitist and something of a miniaturist, and she likes to use a single telling detail, a bad habit, say, or a fixation — like Olivia's fondness for costly lotions or Jane's sudden refusal to wash her hair — to get at the larger meaning. If on occasion, as with Christine's ritualized clumsiness, this tactic slips into contrivance (for someone in pain, she whimpers "ow" a little too often), most of what's here nonetheless feels startlingly honest.  At times repellently so: Ms. Holofcener's willingness to show women at their most unpleasantly needy — like the serial loner in her first feature, "Walking and Talking," who waits for the phone that doesn't ring — can seem almost sadistic, as well as precariously familiar, the stuff of chick-lit clichés. But it's this very nakedness that gives her work bite. There's something unsettling about her films, all of which involve women who are, one way or another, flapping around inside cages largely of their own making. The image of Jane eating her guts out with fury, despite her loving family and fabulously cool career, just doesn't jibe with the standard glossy-magazine cant about wanting, having and keeping it all until death (or divorce) do us part.  Too bad Ms. Holofcener never really taps into Jane's rage. Although she gives the character a late-act speech about the sorrows of aging, this wan explanation never takes hold, partly because the character seems too angry (and the actress looks too good) to be worried about another birthday. Unlike Jane, Ms. Holofcener isn't one to blow her stack. Out of caution or courtesy, she instead offers gentle hints that all may not be right with this world, as when she lets the camera linger on the photo of a monkey, its fingers plugged in its ears, shortly after Franny and her husband walk past it with their arms laden with Christmas gifts. When you're as rich as Franny it's easy to hear no evil — no sadness or sorrow.  "Friends With Money" is greatly appealing if not especially adventurous, either for its director or for her admirers. Ms. Holofcener writes wonderful, recognizably real women characters, but the narrowness of their worlds and the continued modesty of her canvases suggest that, much like Olivia, she would prefer to stick her head under the covers than out the door. It's understandable that the filmmaker would be ambivalent about the choices women face, but it would be nice if she herself expanded on those choices a bit, or at least wrote a character that occasionally checked out Arianna Huffington's blog. After all, while Olivia and the rest have been drifting and freaking out, Ms. Holofcener has directed three very good features that, in themselves, prove there's more to the modern woman's life than her neuroses.  "Friends With Money" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A little sex, a little dope.

The rich are the same as everyone else in Nicole Holofcener's social comedy "Friends With Money" -- they may have more money, but are equally burdened with issues, doubts and often ambiguous forms of discontent. Very much in the femme-centric vein of the writer-director's 2001 feature "Lovely and Amazing," new picture offers an agreeable grazing menu of smart dialogue, wry observational humor and bright characterizations, but doesn't end up feeling like a full meal. Sony Pictures Classics release can look forward to decent, female-driven runs in upscale-tending markets upon planned April 7 openings.
 The nimble, nicely balanced script centers on four longtime female friends who live on Los Angeles' ever-more affluent west side. At the top of the food chain is the vastly wealthy, philanthropically minded Franny (Joan Cusack), married to the rather tentative, and tentatively drawn, Matt (Greg Germann). Jane (Frances McDormand) is a successful, profoundly acerbic fashion designer with a clothes-conscious British husband, Aaron (Simon McBurney), many assume is gay. Christine (Catherine Keener) collaborates on screenplays with her husband David (Jason Isaacs), but they tend to argue most of the time.
Then there is Olivia (Jennifer Aniston), the youngest and most attractive of the bunch but the one most at loose ends. Since leaving a teaching job she has perplexed everyone by working as a maid, and she has no boyfriend, at least until being fixed up with arrogant personal trainer Mike (Scott Caan), who accompanies her to the homes she cleans, has sex with her in each one, then demands a cut of Olivia's earnings, which she meekly hands over.
At the heart of the film's problems is Olivia's inscrutability. She clearly has major issues with self-esteem, as she never stands up for herself and proves susceptible to the influence of whoever she's around. She's an amorphous, almost absurdly pliable piece of unformed personality, and while it is not Holofcener's way to provide detailed character backgrounds and psychological profiles--indeed, the film's unwillingness to explain and offer full resolution counts as a distinction--there is too much that is perplexing about Olivia to let the matter remain entirely unaddressed.
It is easier to infer how the other women got where they are. Stealing the show is Jane, whose rage-fueled rants and scarcely concealed mutterings are loaded with sarcastic bon mots that are delivered to the hilt by McDormand. Jane is experiencing some sort of mid-life crisis that she expresses by refusing to wash her hair, despite the protestations of everyone around her.
She is also able to joke about her husband's "gay" reputation. Everywhere they go, Aaron is hit on by young men, a serio-comic thread Holofcener deliciously plays out when Aaron becomes exceedingly friendly with a solicitous fellow (Ty Burrell) who's married, is into fashion and food and, wouldn't you know it, is also named Aaron.
As for Christine, she's rather too thin-skinned for her own good, reaching the breaking point when her husband points out that her junk food consumption is giving her a big butt. Getting in a nice dig at West Siders' relentless home expansion impulses, pic positions the couple as neighborhood pariahs for building a ghastly addition that blocks everyone's views of the ocean.
Despite the inclusion of life-altering events, Holofcener admirably resists the temptation to send her characters through implausibly grand transformations, viewing character development more realistically as a series of incremental steps. As such, however, the film possesses dramatic and emotional dimensions that more closely resemble those of a modest short story than those of a deep-reaching novel or play, ultimately limiting its impact to something more diverting than weighty.
Performances are uniformly energetic, knowing and engaged, and will help the class and site-specific material speak effectively to sophisticated viewers. The men are mostly backup players here, although Brit thesps Isaacs (sporting a fine Yank accent) and especially McBurney do a lot with their limited opportunities.
Production values are excellent, and songs by Rickie Lee Jones establish a strong generational connection with the characters.

Friends With Money , the third nominally independent feature written and directed by Nicole Holofcener , is less an ensemble comedy than a relationship filmevery major character is defined in terms of his or (mainly) her significant other.
The principals are three and a half West Los Angeles couplesthe married fashion designers Jane (Frances McDormand ) and Aaron (Simon McBurney ), the married screenwriters Christine (Catherine Keener ) and David (Jason Isaacs ), the married rich people Franny (Joan Cusack ) and Mike (Greg Germann ), and the still-to-find- herself-or-husband Olivia (Jennifer Aniston ). Olivia is the odd one out. Framed by two group dinners and the inevitable drive-home postmortems, Friends With Money  addresses that problem.
Briskly episodic, Holofcener's mode is predicated, sitcom-style, on riffs, behavioral triggers, and recurring bits of business. As its title jokingly implies, this is a more grown-up version of Aniston's long- running TV vehiclecomplete with the star herself as eternal ingenue. An alternate title, drawing on Holofcener's own small-screen credits, might have been Sextet in the City : Class consciousness arises in the first scene as the three couples are bewildered to learn that their young friend has given up teaching middle school and become a housemaid.
Friends With Money  lacks the strong family dynamics that enlivened Holofcener's 2002 Lovely & Amazing . Although the women provide the narrative's social glue, it's never clear how they formed their bonds. Rather than story, Friends With Money  is founded on ready-made behavioral metaphors. The psychopathology of everyday life rules: We understand that Olivia devotes herself to tidying up other people's messes to avoid organizing her own affairs, that Jane has given up on life because she's too depressed to wash her hair, and that Christine literally can't see what's in front of her and is thus forever bumping into things.
Christine is played by Holofcener's axiomatic actress and alter ego Keener; as writers, Christine and David have the most developed situation. They work by role-playing, facing each other at individual computers, but they can no longer connect: "It's like we're writing two different scripts." They ponder the vagaries of their profession ("I don't get SpongeBob ," Christine complains) and embark on meaningless projects. Creating a monument to self-absorption by expanding their house skyward, they wonder why the neighbors are pissed. Franny and Mike talkor at least communicate constantly. Consequently, they are the movie's most sexually compatible couple, as well as the most prosperous; Holofcener's most audacious plot device is to billboard this pair of well-heeled lovebirds with the message "Money Helps."
As befits her station (and Cusack's unaccustomedly serious role), Franny is generous and caring to a fault, taking it on herself to vacuum the pot fumes from Olivia's empty head. Scarcely a character, Olivia idly phone-stalks her married ex, but she is also something of a saint remarkably free of class envy and as easily bullied by the men she meets as Aniston is upstaged by the three avidly hard-boiled actresses with whom she shares the screen. A study in wide-eyed stare and adorable nose crinkle, Aniston would be the movie's prize cutie-pie were it not for McBurney's flaming metrosexual, constantly being cruised as he innocently shops for clothes. (In the movie's most extravagant conceit, his narcissism is amply rewarded.)
Transposed to Paris and remade by Agnés Jaoui , Friends With Money  might seem more antic and civilized. But it would probably not have been any worldlier. Holofcener's fairy-tale ending doesn't dispel the movie's downbeat insistence on the distribution of luck. Friends With Money  hints at an inequality bluntly articulated by novelist Michel Houellebecq : "In a perfectly liberal economic system, some people accumulate considerable fortunes; others molder in unemployment and poverty. In a perfectly liberal sexual system, some people have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude."
