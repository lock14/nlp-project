A note to future generations: When relieved of an interracial element, the snooty-dancer-meets-street-dancer musical romance (think: Save the Last Dance
) loses much of its resonance. I�m writing this down because we�re all probably going to forget about Step Up
 pretty soon. I can be generous with a movie that dares bring together Griffiths (strip-mined for her credibility as an imperious art-school principal with plunging sweaters) and Heavy D (as the owner of a Baltimore chop shop), and I will agree that leading dude Tatum (formerly of the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog) dances his white-boy ass off. But the movie is so awkward, so painfully intent on teaching its characters life lessons every few minutes, that it forgets to be trashy, and art-school movies about prissy rich girls in love with underwear-model bad boys serving community probation as school janitors should be a little trashy. But this isn�t quite Fame
, even though there�s a big recital at the end, and one student�s use of synthesizers is likened to masturbation. No, this is the kind of art-school movie where the characters continually remind one another, �We�ve only got one chance to show them who we are!� and then rehearse in montage. A particularly innocent secondary character will possibly take one for the team in order to frighten the others away from boosting Escalades, and kid actor Alyson Stoner lightens the mood periodically as Tatum�s foster sister; he�s always tousling her hair. Its inspirational messages about teenage self-improvement are as subtle and nuanced as Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9�s collision with Jupiter in 1994. This could be a pilot for the WB. Hollywood choreographer Fletcher makes the jump behind the camera but displays a greater aplomb for staging than drama, and the movie is as fleeting as the last weekend of summer.


Hollywood cranks out so many formula teen flicks that it's almost a shock to find one with a little snap, crackle, and pop. The dance musical ``Step Up" doesn't represent anything that hasn't been done a thousand times before, from the Mickey-and-Judy let's-put-on-a-show movies of the 1930s to the Disney Channel's ``High School Musical."
You don't care while you're watching it, though. Alive with infectious rhythm, likable characters, and slick dance moves, ``Step Up" gives clichés a good name.
It helps that star Channing Tatum is, in the words of the 20-something women fanning themselves behind me at the screening, ``Omigod. So. Hot
." Tatum throws off a lot of charisma for an expressionless slab of muscle, and between this confection, his Duke Orsino in ``She's the Man," and the upcoming indie mean-streets drama ``A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints," he's poised to break out.
Fine by me, since the kid can move. I can't figure out how he does it, though: Tatum looks as if they built him out of jumbo-size Legos, but he dances like he's made of ball-bearings.
He plays Tyler Gage , a no-hope white kid from Baltimore's Hamden slums who dodges his nasty foster parents and boosts cars with pal Mac (Damaine Radcliff ) and Mac's little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington ). The thug life beckons, but Tyler takes the rap when the trio break into a tony school for the arts one night; as punishment, he's assigned community service on the school's janitorial squad.
We've already seen him slink and drop on a dance floor, so it's no big surprise what comes next: Tyler gets a gander at ballet student Nora (Jenna Dewan ) and signs up to be her partner for the end-of-term showcase (her previous partner has sprained his ankle, the weenie). Can a kid who never finishes anything see this one through?
Will he gain the approval of the snooty school director (Rachel Griffiths , acting on autopilot)? Will Nora's frosty mother (Deirdre Lovejoy ) stop with the Ivy League applications already and let her daughter dance? Will the gangbanger and the priss make beautiful pliés together?
If you don't know the answers, you haven't seen 2001's ``Save the Last Dance," of which the new film is virtually a remake. Or you're either very young or very credulous and thus fall neatly into the movie's target demographic. Yet ``Step Up" has appeal beyond its crummy, obvious screenplay because joy in physical movement courses through every frame.
As befits a film directed by a choreographer -- Anne Fletcher , who worked on ``Bring It On," ``Ice Princess," and, uh, ``The 40-Year-Old Virgin" -- ``Step Up" finds dance everywhere: on the basketball court, in school hallways, walking down the streets. In one scene, Tyler hangs in the backyard with his foster-care sister (Alyson Stoner , one of the few kids to stand out in the ``Cheaper by the Dozen" mob); he throws a combination at her, just to see if the kid can do it, she throws it back, and suddenly they've got a lovely little number going on.
There's also a rousing group dance at a nightclub, and the final showcase is a bliss-inducing jam of massed bodies and hip-hop strings. The movie earns its high, and in the process the actors are lent believable heat. When they're standing still, Tatum mostly broods and Dewan flares her nostrils, but then they move in for the clinch and the girls in the back row just melt
.
There are lessons to be learned, of course: hard ones by Tyler's street pals and romantic ones by the second-tier duo of R&B singer Mario and Drew Sidora (``White Chicks" ). Tyler has to decide how to pronounce ``piqué" before he can do one. The audience has to figure out why the leads are white when everyone else is black, and whether that should bother them.
All this is secondary to the curious pleasure of watching a large man dance with eerie suppleness and to the director's restless interest in how people move. Tatum's career seems set, but someone should give Fletcher a development deal, stat. If she can turn harmless summer junk like ``Step Up" into something special, imagine what she could do with a real movie.


In the world of the dance movie, life is stripped down to the honesty of bodies in motion and a rhythm-dictated intimacy that can't be denied. There's usually a class factor, a competitive element, a disapproving authority figure, or perhaps all three. Step Up   Fame  on Beat Street , played against the grim West Bawlmer canvas of The Wire   tips its backward ball cap to those elements. (Indeed, the core story has been recycled by writer Duane Adler from his own Save the Last Dance .) But Step , under the sure hand of director-choreographer Anne Fletcher, quickly discovers its own virtuoso charms. Two of them are its leads: Channing Tatum as budding criminal Tyler  all slot eyes and thug shrugs until he hits the dance floor  and Jenna Dewan as Nora, a rich kid shooting for that elusive chance to dance.
The meet-cute: When Nora's partner is injured, Tyler, who's trudging through some court-ordered janitorial work, convinces her he can sub. But Step  doesn't dwell on class-crossed romance: It's more concerned with the pirouetting mini-betrayals and miracle catches of partnership. Tatum has a bracing rectangular naturalness and easy chemistry with the lithe Dewan, on the floor and off. Their dance styles never really jell, and the movie is lazy-vague on the actual art form, privileging will over skill. But the pair is fused by the film's pulsing energy, which is both sincere and irresistible.

 Ever since Kevin Bacon’s rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in “Footloose,” the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In the typical scenario, a boy from the wrong side of the tracks woos a socially superior girl, his only assets a killer smile and a limber pelvis. The story is as old as Mickey Rooney but its appeal is eternal, and “Step Up” cleaves to the template with significantly more rigor than originality. For a director who is also a choreographer, Anne Fletcher is strangely reluctant to step out of line.  This time, the rough boy with the street moves is Tyler (Channing Tatum), a genial Baltimore kid who spends his days stealing cars and shooting hoops. During a stint of community service at an arts school, Tyler is dazzled by a classically trained dancer named Nora (Jenna Dewan) and is soon awkwardly substituting for her injured partner. Obstacles abound — not the least of these being Nora’s unattractive rehearsal outfits — but no relationship based on perfect upper-body alignment can flounder for long. Not when there’s an end-of-term recital at stake. Dance, Tyler, dance!  Though most of the cast appears to be on its ninth repeat of 12th grade, “Step Up” is a likable product that’s refreshingly free of vulgarity. What it’s really about, of course, is class. Like “Save the Last Dance” and its predecessors, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can’t we all be friends?  “Step Up” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild innuendo, one violent incident, two girls who deserve better and no jazz hands whatsoever.

Deftly scrambling elements from "Fame" and "Save the Last Dance," "Step Up" impresses as crowd-pleasing, teen-skewing fare with possible crossover appeal. Shrewdly positioned as the last blast of summer 2006, Touchstone presentation offers a contemporary take on the warhorse plot about attractive opposites who bring out the best in each other as improbably complementary dance partners. Expect surprisingly upbeat B.O. returns if pic's target demographic responds to the fresh cast, a formulaic but engaging storyline, and a smoking soundtrack from rap and hip-hop luminaries.
Making her debut as a feature helmer, choreographer Anne Fletcher ("Bring It On") neatly balances grit and gloss while rendering Baltimore locales in a style best described as romanticized urban realism.
Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) -- who's pretty fly for a white guy -- is a moody ne'er-do-well who finds joy in performing gyrations as a free-style street dancer. When he's not hearty-partying, he hangs with his buddies -- burly Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and his kid brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington) -- and helps them steal cars because, apparently, he has nothing better to do.
When the three homies break into the Maryland School for the Arts and exuberantly trash an auditorium, Tyler is the only one who's caught. Sentenced to 100 hours of community service, he returns to the school as a part-time janitor -- just in time to help Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), a dance student whose partner twists his ankle before the school's Senior Showcase.
Naturally, they have nothing in common: Nora is fiercely focused and goal-oriented, and lives with her well-to-do mom (Deirdre Lovejoy); Tyler is an aimless slacker who resides in the seedy apartment of his none-too-attentive foster parents.
Just as naturally, they soon are making smooth moves on and off the dance floor. Minor impediments sporadically interrupt their budding bliss, but there's never any real doubt that, eventually, they'll wow the crowd at the big show.
"Step Up" isn't exactly a cliche-free zone. Scripters Duane Adler (who co-wrote "Save the Last Dance") and Melissa Rosenberg sprinkle stereotypes and stock situations across acres of familiar territory, so that seemingly frosty authority figures (like the school director played by an under-utilized Rachel Griffiths) become sympathetically supportive, and even a surly chop-shop owner (rapper-actor Heavy D) is revealed as a sensitive supporter of the arts.
Even so, the well-cast leads are more than appealing enough to encourage a rooting interest. Better still, they obviously do their own dancing, and do it very well.
As Tyler, Tatum (who, unfortunately, bears a slight resemblance to Vanilla Ice in some scenes) goes beyond traditional sensitive-hunkiness to convey streetwise humor and affecting shadings of pathos. Dewan is credible and creditable while running the gamut from steely determination to tremulous vulnerability.
Standout supporting players include R&B performer Mario as a musically gifted student who never forgets his roots, and Drew Sidora as an ambitious singer.
With strong support from ace lenser Michael Seresin (whose credits include the original "Fame") and editor Nancy Richardson ("Selena"), Fletcher keeps the pic pulsating with knockout dance sequences, spirited transitions and an overall sense of energetic enthusiasm. On a few occasions, she cleverly devises similarly framed but starkly contrasting scenes to emphasize the distance between the worlds in which Tyler and Nora live. And every so often, she achieves a level of grace and exuberance not unlike that of a classic MGM musical.

Borrowing heavily from predecessors like Fame  and Save the Last Dance , choreographer- turned-director Anne "Mama" Fletcher has made a dance romance that might provoke the old Brooklyn  disco king Tony Manero  to grab a big hammer and go Italian-crazy on the plagiarists. Buff Channing Tatum , late of She's the Man , is a second-rate Eminem  type from the seedy reaches of Baltimore, and his only outlet is busting a few moves. Pretty Jenna Dewan  is the ambitious rich girl who needs a new dance partner for her senior showcase number. Bingo. When the raw meets the refined, art heals all wounds and romance blossomsat least in this familiar vision of showbiz success. Fletcher ably blends ballet and hip-hop, but the filming itself is often clumsy, and Tatum's relentless African American impersonation quickly wears out its welcome.
