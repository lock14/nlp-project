Short story: A couple of '80s schoolboys create a home-video sequel to the first Rambo  movie. Long story: Busy British comedy Son of Rambow  waxes nostalgic about boyhood friendships, school days, amateur video-making, and the glorious grunts of Sylvester Stallone  . (The movie also takes a swipe at conservative Christian sectarianism.) The team who made The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy   display plenty of whirligig energy, if not much control or lightness of touch. The nonpros who play the religious angel and devilish bully best friends/junior filmmakers perform like...nice nonpros.

 The spiritual godfather, as it were, of the comic British charmer “Son of Rambow” is Sylvester Stallone at his fiercest and certainly his gruntiest.  Slathered in sweat and wearing a rag that circles his head like a tourniquet, Mr. Stallone is instantly recognizable as the Reagan-era avenger who first materialized in the instantaneous 1982 camp classic “First Blood.” He rises from the screen like a phoenix from the ashes, even if for the two boys at the center of “Son of Rambow,” who savor his every ponderous, violent move, he’s more of a muscle-bound Tinkerbell ushering them into a new world.  A likable, lightly sticky valentine to childhood, the 1980s and the dawning of movie love, “Son of Rambow” was written and directed by Garth Jennings and produced by Nick Goldsmith, the duo behind the underappreciated fantasy “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” (2005). Like that film, this one involves a snug community of oddballs and outcasts whose eccentricities, pluck and fundamental good cheer have long been durable staples of British screen comedy. The beating heart of this particular grouping is Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner), a lonely child with a single mother (Jessica Stevenson) and an artistic itch, whose fundamentalist faith  has made him a pariah at school, second only to its resident bad boy, the devilish Lee Carter (Will Poulter).  In screen romance fashion, the two boys meet cute if somewhat cruelly. A member of a Christian sect  that forbids television, movies and apparently smiling, Will is quietly sitting in a school hallway (while the rest of his class takes in some audiovisual instruction), when Lee erupts into his field of vision like a bomb. Having been ushered out of his classroom rather more rudely than Will (and to the robust cheering of his fellow students), Lee instantly bounces a ball off the other boy’s unsuspecting head, creating a fatal attraction that starts off like Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse, and soon morphs into something far softer. (Lee throws the ball hard, but Mr. Jennings makes sure it doesn’t hurt too much.)  What kicks the story into gear, turning two wary children into blood brothers, is Rambo. The movie-mad Lee, who lives with his negligent older brother, Lawrence (Ed Westwick), in a mausoleumlike manor next  to a nursing home (their absent mother is married to the facility’s owner), runs a steady video dubbing operation. He’s also making his own screen epic in hopes of winning a television contest. When this would-be DeMille accidentally introduces Will to Rambo, the image of the tough guy serves as a shock to the sheltered (and fatherless) boy.  Rambo — invincible, unyielding — liberates Will, exciting his already effulgent imagination and creating a bond with Lee, his first real friend. But Rambo also enslaves him, making this introspective loner hungry for friendship and film alike.  Working in a self-consciously quirky key that owes a strong debt to Wes Anderson’s “Rushmore,” Mr. Jennings keeps his busy pieces in harmonious play, creating a miniaturized world as detailed, painstakingly determined and insulated as an ant farm. He crams the frame with bright colors and comic bits of business; tosses in an interloper, a French  Billy Idol  called Didier (Jules Sitruk); and makes room for the occasional melancholic stretch.  And although the film’s visual style feels more borrowed than organic, there’s enough truth to Will and Lee’s actions — and to the uninflected, touching performances of the two young leads — to keep the film humming along, even when Mr. Jennings veers into sentimentality and lets one too many tear drop.  “Son of Rambow” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Innocuous childish violence.

Boys will be boys in "Son of Rambow," where two British lads combine their imaginative and rebellious natures for a sweetly raucous adventure. Widely quoted comparisons to "Billy Elliot" and Tim Burton overstate the case for what is really a modestly eccentric entertainment, but you couldn�t tell that to Paramount Vantage, whose $8 million deal at Sundance for most worldwide distribution rights sets up commercial expectations the pic will have a difficult time fulfilling. 
For writer-director Garth Jennings and production outfit Hammer and Tongs, the slightly subversive attitude and whimsical tone of their underrated "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" has been preserved in the new film, but reduced in volume, while previous pic's Wellesian joy of using a studio as a giant toy store is moderated to fit a more Earthbound story.
Jennings' early '80s tale involves two kids who couldn't be more opposite: subdued, well-mannered Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner), raised in a strict household governed by a religious sect; and wild child Lee Carter (Will Poulter), a terror in the classroom and bossed around only by his older brother while his wealthy parents are out of the country. (It turns out Will also has a talent for elaborately imaginative sketching -- recalling, though in a much lighter manner, a similar technique in Sarah Watt's "Look Both Ways.")
The boys' differences cleverly come together in a school hallway when Will, barred from watching television even in class and so excused until the session is over, comes into aggressive contact with Lee, booted into the hallway by his teacher.
What seems to be a standard case of a bully boy having his way with a naif becomes something more whimsical when Lee recruits Will as an actor in his homemovie, "Son of Rambow," inspired -- despite the misspelling -- by "Rambo: First Blood."A series of wildly risky stunts involving catapults and tall tree branches that Will's all too happy to pull off for Lee's clunky video camera is almost too exaggerated for its own good, but also can be seen as Will rebelling against his oppressive upbringing -- a home life made worse when one of the religious brethren (Neil Dudgeon) inserts himself into Will's home life as a substitute dad and tries to put the moves on his single mom (Jessica Stevenson).
Meanwhile a busload of French exchange students arrive for the semester. Amid the pimply faced young Gauls, self-consciously chic Didier (Jules Sitruk) stands out, attracting an admiring posse.
The Huck-and-Tom quality of "Son of Rambow" becomes complicated when Didier's group assumes control of the movie, and Lee is revealed to be a lonely outsider whom the rest of the student body despises. In the late phases of his script, Jennings seems under pressure to wrap up as many loose ends as possible by the 90-minute mark, rather than simply allowing them to naturally unfold.
But since the engagingly serious Milner and spunky Poulter are such an engaging pair, the early charms of "Son of Rambow" aren't compromised.
Sitruk at first suggests a standard Brit-inflected stereotype of the above-it-all Frenchie, but shows -- like Poulter's Lee -- that he's a loner having to act out to be noticed. Back home, Stevenson plays Will's quietly suffering mother like a woman from the 17th century.
As to be expected from Hammer and Tongs, bright and witty physical and visual touches spill off the screen, though the use of effects is scaled to the tale. An ominous nuclear power plant calls to mind how they were the object of intense controversy and concern in the '80s, but Jess Hall's lensing is more bucolic than moody. Joby Talbot's score is too loud and insistent, goosing the movie when it doesn't need it.

No adult has ever been able to codify what separates a good movie from a classic. In kid terms, though—those favored by Son of Rambow , a chipper tribute to the cinema as both supplier and repository of dreams—a good movie merely sends you bounding home from the theater. A great movie demands some further physical response, like beaning your neighbor with a volleyball. And a classic? Simple. A classic makes you want to make movies.
Long ago, in the distant 1980s when Son of Rambow  is set, "classic" wasn't the word anyone would have used to describe First Blood . A moody, proficient revenge thriller that heralded a coming wave of post-Vietnam  sulking, it nonetheless begat Sylvester Stallone 's segue from mush-mouthed punching bag to mush-mouthed killing machine. Watch First Blood , however, from the POV of a lonely, picked-on tween-age boy—i.e., the sensibility that pervades it—and it's a projector-beamed bolt from the blue. In that light, John Rambo  looks like Mattel 's own adolescent-angst action figure: ostracized, misunderstood by the world, preyed upon by authority figures, and best of all, unencumbered by girls. No wonder the misfit heroes of writer-director Garth Jennings 's whimsical comedy—two enterprising British schoolkids who set out to make their own Stallone-derived fireballapalooza—feel less kinship to Indiana Jones , the keeper of covenants, than to Rambo, the army of one.
Introduced bootlegging First Blood  at the neighborhood movie house, scruffy little hustler Lee (Will Poulter) has only the company of movies and a bulky camcorder. All but abandoned by his parents and mistreated by his caddish older bro, the conniving Lee takes a page from Rambo and passes along the hurt to someone else: a dreamy, repressed tyke named Will Proudfoot  (the elfin Bill Milner ), whose religion makes the sign of the cross against demon cinema. Lee has to cajole, bully, and guilt-trip his naïve new chum into top-lining his top-secret home movie. What it takes, ultimately, to make a believer of Will is a glimpse of Hollywood 's forbidden fruit on Lee's VCR. The movie's cleverest, most exuberant sequence follows Will dashing home as his head buzzes for the first time with celluloid excess.
Jennings finds a tone here that's more winsome and less desperately wacky than his film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , especially as the movie-within-a-movie mutates into quirkily revealing psychodrama. Will and Lee's escape into cinema proves contagious, and the project—kids acting out the playground equivalent of fan fiction—quickly overturns their school's hierarchy of cool. Soon mousy Will is pogoing to the crazy new sound of Depeche Mode  with a roomful of Space Dust–chugging hipsters—while Lee looks on miserably, hopelessly upstaged.
Their falling-out seems trumped up to provide last-minute conflict, as does the heavy-handed subplot involving the oppressive brethren of Will's church. But at its most likable, Son of Rambow  evokes the rush of discovery that turns budding cinephiles into lifers—that delight in finding a film that seems to express or coalesce some inchoate yearning, including a yen to share.
