Perversely, fans of Katherine Paterson's 1977 young adult novel "Bridge to Terabithia " -- and they're legion -- will be cheered by the news that the Very Sad Thing that happens three-fourths of the way into the book also happens in the movie, no matter how happy and peppy the trailers appear.
Conversely, parents and children wandering cold into this latest Walden Media adaptation of a summer reading list classic are going to be smacked upside the head by the Very Sad Thing, and kids might want to be prepared to comfort mom and dad. Seriously: As I came out of the screening, I overheard a father saying "I'm so bummed out about [the Very Sad Thing]. It ruined the movie for me."
Well, that's what happens when Hollywood coddles a generation: You can't handle the tough stuff when it turns up (again, I'm talking about the parents here). "Bridge to Terabithia" is an ungainly, sometimes off-putting fusion of rural tweenerhood and computer-generated fantasy, but at its quiet best it honors the secret life of imagination and the secret lives of kids, and it knows that children understand the world sometimes plays unfair. It's like an After-School Special version of "Pan's Labyrinth ," and I actually mean that as a compliment.
"Bridge to Terabithia" also shows the young actress AnnaSophia Robb on the verge of becoming a star: The camera loves her, and her unforced, goodhearted kid-ness feels like an antidote to all the hardened movie bratz out there. She plays Leslie Burke, the new kid in a rural school district and neighbor to classmate Jess (Josh Hutcherson ). Jess comes from a struggling farm family; he's the only boy in a warren of girls, and his gift for drawing doesn't play well with his thin-lipped father (Robert Patrick ).
At school, the roost is ruled by bullies like Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton ), who can beat up any boy and who charges the girls to pee. Directed by "Rugrats " mastermind Gabor Csupo (making his live-action debut), "Bridge to Terabithia" is about how the unconquerable, eccentric Leslie shakes this little world up, befriending the mean kids and showing Jess that dreaming's nothing to be ashamed of.
Out in the woods, the two find an old treehouse and refashion it into a mythical land called Terabithia, complete with an evil overlord and giants and minions (the squirrels-on-steroids look a bit like the R.O.U.S. from "The Princess Bride "). From the top of the tree they can see endless snow-capped fantasy mountains -- Narnia, right next door! (That was a Walden movie, too; maybe they got a deal on the real estate.)
The book, of course, allowed Terabithia to rise in a reader's own imagination. Modern movies insist computer-generated special effects are bigger and better when they're really just more obvious, and they cheat a kid of the quirks of his or her own vision. The CGI in the movie is acceptable but cut-rate -- a WalMart Middle Earth. Jess and Leslie deserve better.
Fortunately, "Bridge to Terabithia" spends most of its time in the real world of middle school and fractured families, and the two leads play their growing pains fairly. (Hutcherson is very good as the sad, observant Jess, but he should never be asked to smile -- it looks like they're poking him with sticks.) Zooey Deschanel floats through as the kind of music teacher we all had crushes on, and Bailee Madison is funny as Jess' little sister, a soulful pest.
Walden Media is owned (but not run) by the Christian billionaire Philip F. Anschutz , and through all the company's book adaptations -- "Holes," "Because of Winn-Dixie," "Hoot," "How to Eat Fried Worms" -- I've been waiting for the other sandal to drop. It drops in "Bridge to Terabithia," but with the same open-ended gentleness it does in the book. Very Sad Things prompt Very Big Questions, and this movie is smart enough to avoid Very Easy Answers.


         From the special effects-laden trailers, "Bridge to Terabithia" looks for all the world like the second coming of "The Chronicles of Narnia." It's not — and that's a very good thing.
 
  Firmly grounded in the real world and based on Katherine Paterson's 1977 Newbery Award-winning novel, "Bridge to Terabithia" is a wonderfully heart-wrenching love story for tweens, teens, and even adults who fondly remember when a friendship could be ignited by a gesture as simple as offering a stick of Juicy Fruit.
 


         






    Set in a present day nondescript rural town, the film brings together two fifth-graders who couldn't come from more diverse backgrounds. Jess (Josh Hutcherson) is an aspiring artist and a local boy lost in the shuffle between four sisters and his parents' financial troubles. In contrast, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) is the well-to-do new girl in town, and with her boyish looks and trendy high-tops, she's instantly branded as the oddball whose writer parents don't own a TV.
 
  Together, they escape the pressures of the real world by swinging across a creek on an "enchanted" rope and entering a forest Leslie dubs Terabithia, a world fueled by their imaginations and filled with dragonfly warriors, hairy vultures and other fanciful creatures. Watching Terabithia come alive courtesy of Weta Digital requires a leap of faith not needed in the novel (which describes Terabithia in only the vaguest terms), and as a result, the computer-generated special effects, while spectacular, often call too much attention to themselves.
 
  Thankfully, first-time live-action director Gabor Csupo, best known for his work on "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats," keeps the CG effects to a minimum and allows the source material to shine through. (It helps that Paterson's son, David, is a screenwriter along with Jeff Stockwell.)
 
  The strength of the film — as with the novel — lies in the emotional relationship between Jess and Leslie as they struggle through class, family and social issues. They love each in the deepest nonromantic sense, and when they finally embrace, it holds more passion than the steamiest of on-screen kisses.
 
  The film is also carried by a strong cast led by Robb, who with her disarming smile and short blond bob has all the presence of a young Tatum O'Neal. Also worth noting is Robert Patrick, as Jess' father, who provides a feeling of sternness and warmth to an otherwise two-dimensional character, and just as important, a big shoulder to cry on. As it turns out, there are some realities of life that you can't escape, even in a magic kingdom like Terabithia.
 
  "Bridge to Terabithia." MPAA rating: PG for thematic elements including bullying, some peril and mild language. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. In general release.   

Wouldn't it blow your mind if you discovered an enchanted CG kingdom in the woods behind your house? In Bridge to Terabithia , the two middle schoolers who stumble onto a whole new world don't seem all that wowed. And the movie  which never decides if it's a fantasy or coming-of-age story  spends a lot of time away from Terabithia; that also leaches out the wonder. The boy seems more excited that Zooey Deschanel is his hottie music teacher than he is to see tree men in the forest.

 Despite an ad campaign suggesting wall-to-wall special effects, “Bridge to Terabithia” is grounded in reality far more than in fantasy. Adapting Katherine Paterson’s award-winning novel, the screenwriters David Paterson (Ms. Paterson’s son) and Jeff Stockwell have produced a thoughtful and extremely affecting story of a transformative friendship between two unusually gifted children. The result is a movie whose emotional depth could appeal more to adults than to their offspring.  Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a sixth grader with four sisters, financially strained  parents (Robert Patrick and Kate Butler) and a talent for drawing. An introverted kid who is regularly picked on by the school jerks, Jess forms a bond with a new student named Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), a free spirit whose parents, both writers, are fondly neglectful. An attraction between outsiders, their friendship feeds on her words and his pictures; together they create an imaginary kingdom in the woods behind their homes, a world they can control and where their minds can roam free.  Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare and the encouragement of a teacher can alter the course of a life, “Bridge to Terabithia” keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. Gabor Csupo, one of the creators of “Rugrats,” directs this, his first feature, like  someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic and reveling in tiny, perfect details: the mending tape hugging a worn pair of sneakers, the way a child detects the tension in a parent’s hushed conversation, the inchoate isolation of a lone boy in a house filled with the sounds of women.  With strong performances from all the leads, including Zooey Deschanel as a spirited music teacher and little Bailey Madison as Jesse’s youngest sister, May Belle, “Bridge to Terabithia” is able to handle adult topics with nuance and sensitivity. As the emotional landscape darkens, those who haven’t read the book may be surprised at the sorrow the filmmakers evoke without ever resorting to shock or sentimentality. In other words, your children may sniffle, but they won’t be traumatized.  Consistently smart and delicate as a spider web, “Bridge to Terabithia” is the kind of children’s movie rarely seen nowadays. And at a time when many public schools are being forced to cut music and art from the curriculum, the story’s insistence on the healing power of a nurtured imagination is both welcome and essential.  “Bridge to Terabithia” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild language, mildly scary incidents and adult themes.

The imaginary world dreamed up by two youngsters in Katherine Paterson's coming-of-age classic has been realized imperfectly, but with intelligence and sensitivity nonetheless, in "Bridge to Terabithia." Some literal-minded attempts at magical realism are redeemed by the film's emotional texture, winning chemistry between the tyke leads and scrupulous adherence to a childlike point of view. A tougher sell than Walden Media's recent kid-lit adaptation, "Charlotte's Web," the superior "Bridge" should play well theatrically but may connect better with audiences on homevid; in either venue, parents and children should have tissues at the ready.
Paterson's much-loved 1977 novel has resonated strongly with generations of young readers, particularly those who were more comfortable growing up in worlds of their own making than on the school playground. Ten-year-old farm boy Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is just such a misfit, squashed between four sisters, starved for affection from his gruff dad (Robert Patrick), and relentlessly picked on by his classmates.
Jess doesn't expect to find a kindred spirit in Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a precocious girl with a short crop of blonde hair and a slightly mischievous streak, whose family has just moved into the house next door. But the two soon become inseparable, as Jess' talent for drawing finds a natural complement in Leslie's passion for storytelling and make-believe.
One day the kids swing across a creek on a dangling rope and find themselves deep in a secluded patch of forest. And so is born the secret kingdom of Terabithia, where an abandoned treehouse becomes the castle from which Jess and Leslie rule as king and queen, fending off imaginary dangers that have an unusual way of dovetailing with the obstacles they face in real life.
Working from a fine screenplay by Jeff Stockwell (who dealt with thematically similar material in "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys") and David Paterson (the author's son), Hungarian-born helmer Gabor Csupo shows admirable restraint in slowly easing viewers into Jess and Leslie's world. But Csupo, an animator (the "Rugrats" movies) making his first live-action feature, is also eager to show off his arsenal of digital effects, which prove to be the film's raison d'etre as well as its near-undoing.
The opportunity to bring Terabithia to full cinematic life no doubt reps a key selling point, and there are certainly antecedents for visualizing a fantasy realm of this nature (most notably Peter Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures," which, like "Bridge to Terabithia," was expertly serviced by Weta Digital). But while the book wisely left most of the details to the reader's imagination, the film presents its version of Terabithia as the flashy main attraction. As initially exciting as it is to see Jess and Leslie dodging vultures, oversized rodents and one ugly giantess, these prosaic flights of fancy inevitably speak less to the power of the imagination than to the power of CGI.
Ironically, the mundane realities of the duo's normal lives prove more readily absorbing, as Csupo channels the awkwardness of pre-adolescence with perfect pitch. Despite the use of contempo kids' slang, there's a timelessness to the details of Jess' school life that feels exactly right, from the music lessons taught by Ms. Edmonds (a lovely Zooey Deschanel), whom Jess has a serious crush on, to the everyday social terror of riding the bus. With a great deal of empathy and very little preaching, the film advances a message of kindness and open-mindedness even toward those who would seem to deserve it least.
Patrick is very well-cast as Jess' stern, withholding dad, while Bailey Madison is almost distractingly cute as Jess' adoring younger sister May Belle. Other key characters, like school bully Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton), are memorably inhabited.
But ultimately, the film rests on its two leads. Crucially, Csupo understands that this is a young boy's story; at no point does the viewer feel emotionally out of sync with Hutcherson, whose Jess is by turns shy, gentle, awkward and moody, and never less than wholly sympathetic. The elfin-featured Robb, who had a grand time playing a super-spoiled brat in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," here puts wide, intensely blue eyes and spunky delivery in service of a wonderfully eccentric character.
Viewers familiar with the novel will anticipate the story's shift into darker territory, and they'll be relieved to know that it's handled as delicately as possible, and all the more moving because of it. Yet it also rips a hole in the narrative that the grandiose finale tries rather feebly to repair, ending the film on a note that doesn't ring entirely true.
The dark earth tones of Michael Chapman's cinematography invest the forest sequences with an enticing sense of mystery and danger, counterbalanced by the more benign wonderment of Aaron Zigman's score. Costume designer Barbara Darragh deserves mention for her smart decision to clothe and accessorize Robb like a tyro hippie.

Don't be fooled by the CGI-laden, Narnia  -lite trailers for Bridge to Terabithia  : Far from a computer generated escapist fantasy, this film is an unpretentious and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss. Terabithia  is the story of fifth-grade loner Jess Aarons  (Josh Hutcherson ), whose sensitive, artistic temperament isolates him from the towheaded bullies at school and his hardheaded father at home. Liberation from solitude comes in the form of sprightly Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb ), whose exaggerated anime cuteness bring Jess out of his shell. The pair form a bond based on a made-up world called Terabithia. Director Gabor Csupo  of Rugrats "fame" steer clear of cutesy tween stereotypes, but it's Jess's relationship with his father, played by Robert Patrick , that elevates Terabithia  from a good kids movie to a classic contender.
