A lot of emotions look good on Jonathan Rhys Meyers' sneery, overripe features, but compassion isn't one of them. In the historical dud The Children of Huang Shi , he plays a roving World War II journalist who sneaks into Nanking and glimpses the atrocities there. Yet the movie isn't interested in anything so pivotal. Instead, it traces our hero's Journey Toward Caring as he rescues 60 Chinese orphans. It's like Schindler's List  crossed with The Sound of Music , and Roger Spottiswoode directs it in a stiff, lifeless, utterly dated style of international squareness.


 A Hollywood weepie snuggled inside a humanitarian tribute, “The Children of Huang Shi” molds the true story of the English reporter George Hogg (played by the Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers) into a chaste love triangle given urgency by the Japanese invasion of China.  The children? They’re there too, holed up in a crumbling orphanage eating worm-infested grain and unaware that their soon-to-be savior is playing daredevil newshound in a terrorized Nanjing. Reckless to a fault, Hogg is presently facing the business end of a Japanese sword, only to be rescued by a wry Chinese Communist guerrilla (Chow Yun-Fat, stealing the movie) and soothed by a brisk, self-punishing American (Radha Mitchell). Eventually these three will shepherd the orphans — and their own complicated affections — across the Gobi Desert to safety.  Roger Spottiswoode directs with old-fashioned style, avoiding the saccharine with realistic depictions of a war-ravaged China (where he filmed) and a cast well versed in stiff-upper-lip. The terrific cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding photographs dust devils and bullets as carefully as the luminous face of Michelle Yeoh, whose role as an enterprising war widow adds political nuance to a determinedly apolitical script.  Yet it’s difficult to care about Hogg himself, whose personality and motivations remain unplumbed. That’s why the testimonies from some of his former charges, played over the end credits, are so unexpectedly moving.  “The Children of Huang Shi” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Veiled lovemaking, explicit opium-smoking and in-your-face killing.

The heroic true tale of a Brit journalist�s rescue of dozens of orphaned Chinese youth in the face of an advancing Japanese army has become a cloddish if gorgeous-looking wartime adventure epic in �The Children of Huang Shi.� Giving Jonathan Rhys Meyers the kind of manly yet paternal role Spencer Tracy once mastered, this carefully wrought international production relates the basic story of reporter George Hogg without any vibrancy, emotion or style. Late-act romantic touches seem unlikely to stir commercial interest for what looks like a small-scale performer at best, opening May 23 Stateside after its Chinese mainland preem.
While screenwriters James MacManus and Jane Hawksley stick to the general facts of the situation in China in 1937-38, when Japan brutally thrust deep into the mainland, they have an uncertain grasp of dramatic interest and distinctive characters Based on the evidence here and in his previous film, the Rwandan-genocide drama �Shake Hands With the Devil� (also a true story of a white man trying to rescue nonwhite innocents), director Roger Spottiswoode�s skills for physical production outpace his ability to generate vitality and bring out the best in his actors.
Young reporter George (Rhys Meyers) arrives in Shanghai in late 1937 to report on the Nippon takeover of China and the combined efforts of Chinese nationalists and communists to fight back. He and colleague Barnes (David Wenham) manage to get behind Japanese lines in Nanjing (better known as Nanking) during the horrific destruction and occupation of the city.
During this section, the pic is intense in its depiction of what a journalist might encounter trying to report and shoot photos of atrocities. George is soon captured, but like cavalry coming over the hill, a rebel unit led by Chen (Chow Yun-fat), a communist engineer whose job is to blow up buildings to thwart the Japanese, saves the journo in the nick of time.
George actually has two last-second rescues at the hands of strangers -- the second being doctor Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell) -- and it�s at this point that the film begins to show signs of narrative exhaustion. Lee suggests to friend (and, as it turns out, ex-lover) Chen that they shuttle George to the relative safety of rural Huang Shi, site of a children�s orphanage, but once he arrives, George finds nothing but hostility.
Resident mother figure Lo San (Shuyuan Jin) has little control over the rapscallions who run roughshod over the orphanage. Lee tells the reluctant George he must stay here and take care of the boys -- all the better to bone up on his Mandarin -- while she makes house calls across the region.
Midsection settles into a predictable pattern of sequences in which George adjusts to his surroundings, makes friends with the boys -- except their spiky leader, Shi-kai (Guang Li) -- and connects with wealthy merchant Madame Wang (Michelle Yeoh, nicely cast).
While the central characters are finally allowed to develop some inner lives and a bit of friction (including a barely developed love triangle of sorts involving George, Lee and Chen), they are generally more pleasant than specific, while the real nemesis is often offscreen, in the vague form of a Japanese army on the march. In this regard, the pic underlines the general rule that humanitarians frequently don�t make for the most vivid film characters; George Hogg is simply drawn as a brave, kindly man who finds his life�s purpose, which isn�t filing daily war dispatches to Fleet Street.
Once those in the orphanage must flee from the encroaching army, the film shifts into an adventure epic that travels across large vistas of interior China, including some brief but striking passages in the Gobi desert. Longtime Zhang Yimou cameraman Zhao Xiaoding once again displays his skills at picturing human beings in the context of vast landscapes, despite plodding direction and editing.
The inevitable George-Lee love story finally blossoms, though all too briefly, and even tragic turns feel somewhat glossed over and emotionally parched. Rhys Meyers is certainly up for the challenge of a forthright hero and brings as many shades as he can, but he and the engaging Mitchell are unfairly saddled with lines like, �You are the bravest, most beautiful woman I�ve ever met.� Chow leaves little impression, while Guang is impressive in key scenes.
The multinational nature of the production displays all its resources, but that might also explain why too much of the dialogue is in English, including scenes the orphans couldn�t possibly understand. 


Loath though I am to carp about any director who's devoted chunks of his career to bringing the non-white world's suffering to Western attention, Roger Spottiswoode 's The Children of Huang Shi  —a drama based on the life of an Englishman who saved an orphanage full of boys from Japanese invaders and Chinese nationalists in the 1930s—is a tale as ploddingly familiar as it is good-looking and worth telling.
Spottiswoode is hardly alone in distilling a distant country's pain into the story of one white Westerner making a difference while world history rages around him. Just about every current Hollywood  film set in Africa squeezes global conflict into the same fossilized frame.
Personally, I'd rather have a bad movie that distracts Americans from their navels for a moment than none at all. But even by the tainted standards of subconsciously imperial storytelling, The Children of Huang Shi  is weak. Jonathan Rhys Meyers  isn't terrible as George Hogg , a naive young Brit hungry for adventure who passes himself off as a foreign correspondent just as the Japanese take over Shanghai . He's just terribly incongruous: a 21st-century Irish heartthrob with hair barely tamped down from its trendy coxcomb, overcooking the Oxbridge accent of an early-20th-century toff who gets in over his head when the Japanese capture him on the road to Nanjing .
Saved from summary execution by a big name in a minor role—Chow Yun-Fat , hogging the light relief as a Chinese guerrilla—George is further redeemed, this time from his own self-regard, by Lee Pearson  (Radha Mitchell ), a self-appointed American nurse. Lee dumps him at a barely functioning orphanage, where, after a brief sulk, George has the time of his life planting veggies, fending off lice, and finally fleeing with the boys along the unforgiving Silk Road.
Screenwriters James MacManus and Jane Hawksley 's idea of psychological complexity is to give every character innate nobility plus a human flaw to work through, while sprinkling the expository dialogue with Moments of Saving Humor, from which the director continually cuts away to lovely but ravaged scenery.
Like so many cookie-cutter international dramas of its kind, Huang Shi  is a work from the heart hobbled by anxieties—some of them well-founded—that no one will finance, release, or show up for such earnest material without young stars, explosions, and the usual narrative arc curving from despair to hope. But the fact that the film's freshest words come from the surviving children of Huang Shi, their lined old faces projected over the end credits, suggests we'd be better off watching the excellent 2007 documentary about Japan 's invasion of China, Nanking .
