It's easier to tell you who's not
 in ''Beauty Shop" than who is. This formulaic but extremely good-natured comedy spins Queen Latifah off from the ''Barbershop" franchise, lands her in Atlanta, and surrounds her with a chick-flick supporting cast that almost supports her right out of the movie. Which, when you think about it, isn't a simple task. But the star doesn't seem to mind and, as long as you go in with expectations set medium to low, neither will you. The film's like a crowded backyard picnic, and I mean that as a compliment.
Latifah's Gina Norris was in ''Barbershop 2" just long enough to sow the seed for this nonsequel (executive produced, as always, by Ice Cube, who's a no-show in front of the camera). In ''Beauty Shop," she's a widow who's relocated back home so 11-year-old daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) can study classical piano at a performing arts school. Bunking with mother-in-law Paulette (Laura Hayes) and bratty homegirl sister-in-law Darnelle (Keshia Knight Pulliam), Gina gets a job styling hair at a downtown salon run by Jorge, a snippy Euro-metrosexual played by Kevin Bacon with open shirt and Sarah Jessica Parker's hair. The actor is strident and obvious, but he's clearly having fun, and if nothing else, the movie now puts the entire Hollywood African-American community within two degrees of Kevin Bacon.
Push comes to shove, and Gina quits to set up her own shop in the SWATS neighborhood (Southwest Atlanta), taking flaky country-girl shampooist Lynn (Alicia Silverstone) along. Like Bacon, Silverstone is amusing enough with her cornpone Southern accent, but she's not doing her career any favors -- Lynn is here purely to fill the designated white-stylist slot established by Troy Garity in ''Barbershop." The rest of Gina's crew is an all-shapes-and-sizes contingent of underserved African-American actresses, from pregnant Ida (Sherri Shepherd), pretty and sharp-tongued Chanel (Golden Brooks, from UPN's ''Girlfriends"), and -- in the Cedric the Entertainer mouthy-oldster role -- Miss Josephine, played by Alfre Woodard with kente cloth and liberal helpings of Maya Angelou.
Cute stuff, and ''Beauty Shop" further courts the ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman" core demo by casting hunky Bryce Wilson as an is-he-gay-or-not? male stylist. Then it tears the roof off the sucker by throwing in Djimon Hounsou as Gina's love interest, a jazz pianist who lives upstairs and -- sigh
 -- plays a lot of Stevie Wonder. With his shirt off.
You think I'm done? Andie MacDowell and Mena Suvari turn up as two wealthy white Atlantans who defect to Gina's shop, the former neurotically enslaved to her sports lawyer husband until the local soul-food delivery cart gives her self-esteem and some serious back, and the latter a ''Botox Barbie" who comes in for some nasty jibes concerning her breast implants. In ''Beauty Shop," what God gave you is good enough, and, generally speaking, the bigger the better.
Teenage comedian Lil JJ shows up as a kiddie rap wannabe -- he gets most of the film's harmless booty jokes -- and Russell Simmons's wife is in there somewhere. Somebody even dug dear old Della Reese out of mothballs for a cameo, and if Pearl Bailey wasn't dead, she'd probably be here, too.
What there isn't much of is a plot. You may not miss it. There's something about a mean building-code inspector and Jorge's revenge, but it's drowned out by the formidable old school/new school soundtrack, the tired but foolproof wisecracks, the air of you-go-girl camaraderie, and Latifah's genial authority. The breakthroughs in ''Beauty Shop" are small -- a heroine who's not an anorexic twig yet who still gets the guy with six-pack abs, an interracial couple who aren't that big a deal beyond prompting the comment that ''MTV is the devil
" -- but they're there. As to the rest, resistance may be futile.

         When the success of "Barbershop" led to its inevitable sequel, its filmmakers shrewdly introduced Queen Latifah into the predominantly male world of an African American barbershop in Chicago. Latifah was cast as a hair stylist in a salon next door, positioning her to engage in wordplay with the barbershop's hilariously obstinate Cedric the Entertainer. It was immediately clear Latifah would need a movie of her own, and "Beauty Shop" is the happy result.
 
  Like its predecessors, "Beauty Shop" is a warmhearted comedy, and it has a realistic sense of a determined woman's struggle to make a better life for her family. Writers Kate Lanier and Norman Vance Jr. reveal an acute awareness of class and racial differences, largely through the use of humor. Of course, the girl talk that goes on is an endless source of laughter — the women discuss everything from bikini waxing to men shedding tears, and a lot of what they have to say is amusingly blunt.
 


         






    The writers have come up with the clever device of having a radio show DJ (Adele Givens) provide a running commentary that adds bounce and humor to a well-paced picture. With a zingy script and a diverting ensemble cast, director Bille Woodruff turns "Beauty Shop" into a highly entertaining and at times thoughtful treat.
 
  The filmmakers wisely move Queen Latifah's Gina Norris from Chicago to Atlanta, which means that both the distraction and expense of having the "Barbershop" guys on hand has been avoided. Gina is a widow with a small daughter (Kimora Lee Simmons), a budding classical pianist, and they live with Gina's mother-in-law (Miss Laura Hayes) and her trouble-prone daughter, Darnelle (Keshia Knight Pulliam), in an attractive Victorian cottage.
 
  Gina works in a posh salon owned by the imperious Jorge (Kevin Bacon, hilarious), who has long bleach-streaked locks, a thick German accent and attitude to spare. The day soon comes when Gina has had it with the bitchy, self-absorbed Jorge, and she dares to strike out her own, taking over a salon in her neighborhood that is still decorated with a high '70s look. With more imagination and hard work than money, Gina transforms the shop and lines up stylists: the resolutely Afro-centric, New Age-y Ms. Josephine (Alfre Woodard), the tall, slim and gorgeous Chanel (Golden Brooks), the gaudy, plump and pregnant Ida (Sherri Shepherd), who are soon joined by the head-turner James (Bryce Wilson) and by one of Jorge's unhappy shampoo girls, Lynn (Alicia Silverstone). That Lynn is a young white woman with a Blue Ridge Mountains twang generates some tension in an otherwise African American shop that ultimately dissolves into mutual goodwill.
 
  Somewhat to her surprise, Gina finds two of her clients at Jorge's seeking her out: dithery but sweet-natured Atlanta socialite Terri (Andie MacDowell) and the sleek but ultimately snobbish and shallow Joanne (Mena Suvari). That Jorge begins to feel competition from a neighborhood salon sets in motion a plot driven by character rather than myriad developments. Gina has her share of setbacks and challenges, but above her shop lives an electrician (Djimon Hounsou) who is handsome, single and as good at inspiring Gina's daughter in her music as he is in patching the salon's ancient wiring.
 
  For all the vivid, amusing characters that surround Gina, "Beauty Shop" rightly belongs to Latifah, who comes into her own as a star and an actress in this film. She has an easy, earthy presence, and most important, she suggests that strength and vulnerability are not contradictory qualities in a character. Latifah has a natural command of the screen that makes it clear that "Beauty Shop" is yet another smart move in her flourishing career.   

Beauty Shop , a spin-off of the spiky and popular Barbershop  comedies, places the ladies in the center shampoo chair, and I went into it hoping for the same sort of buzz  for the gossipy, rambunctious kick of neighborhood hairstylists saying whatever pops into their heads, manners (and good taste) be damned. The high spirits are certainly in place. When Gina (Queen Latifah), who has been transplanted from Chicago to Atlanta, quits her job at a trendy salon run by Jorge (Kevin Bacon), a Eurotrash-bitch stylist with enough highlights in his shaggy mane to destroy the cause of metrosexuality, she proceeds to set up her own shop, poaching a couple of his posh clients (Andie MacDowell and Mena Suvari) while she's at it. The backchat is flying before the hair dryers are even plugged in.
There are jokes about big booties and bikini waxes, and far too many obvious ones about the novice white hairdresser (Alicia Silverstone) who comes on like she's just another sistah. (She's the equivalent of Troy Garity's white homeboy in Barbershop .) More often than not, though, it's the film that's faking the swagger. Gina opens her business in a low-income neighborhood, but her beauty shop, with its pastel blue walls and free cappuccino, isn't presented as a funky alternative to Jorge's designer digs. It's serene and classy and upscale  sort of like Latifah's performance. As Gina, she rules over the salon like a wise den mother, striving to fix everyone else's problems. Beauty Shop  could be the slow-gear launch episode of a ''warm'' workplace-as-family sitcom. It's a boisterous and amiable movie but not, in the end, a very funny one.
There's a telling moment when Gina and her employees are listening, with deep satisfaction, to a sexy-voiced deejay who unspools a tale of feminine vengeance. She talks about acting real ''ghetto,'' and then, as a punchline, she drops the N-word, which inspires gales of laughter and disbelieving cries of ''No, she didn't!'' At that point, Gina cuts short the fun by declaring, ''No one says the N-word up in this shop!'' Morally, her policy statement is unassailable, yet it comes off as more than a bit schoolmarmish  not to mention contradictory  when you consider that everyone in the salon was cracking up not five seconds before over the slangy catharsis of the forbidden word.
Barbershop  and its sequel featured Cedric the Entertainer making glorious trouble. If there's a female Cedric out there waiting to tell the truth as only a woman can, she is not to be found in Beauty Shop . Alfre Woodard, as the most outspoken of the stylists, has a few moments of bossy bravura, and there are fun touches around the edges, like the soul-food peddler (Sheryl Underwood) who keeps offering folks ''monkey bread'' followed by a nutty jungle screech. Djimon Hounsou, as the electrician who falls for Gina, is a love interest too saintly by half. Latifah is sexy enough to earn his attention, but where, I kept wondering, is the snappish queen of rap bluster? In Beauty Shop , she's been Oprahfied out of existence.

ot so much a sequel as an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff squeezed onto the big screen, "Beauty Shop" extends the popular "Barbershop" franchise to Atlanta and provides a sassy feminine counterpart to its cozy men's-club vibe. Queen Latifah, who matched wits with Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer and the rest of the crew in "Barbershop 2: Back in Business," returns in this film as Gina, a no-nonsense striver and devoted mother, who has left the South Side of Chicago for the real South. At first, she is working at a fancy salon owned by Jorge (Kevin Bacon, looking and sounding like a refugee from a road show production of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch"), but after a few too many arguments she decides to open her own establishment in a working-class black neighborhood. She assembles a boisterous squad of stylists, including her rebellious niece Darnelle (Keshia Knight Pulliam, who once played the cute-as-a-button Rudy Huxtable on "The Cosby Show"), as well as a token male (Bryce Wilson, who also appeared in the hair-care comedy "Hair Show") and a token white girl (Alicia Silverstone, speaking in one of the least convincing backwoods accents ever heard on screen). Cedric's role as the nutty, lovable old-timer is approximated by Alfre Woodard as Ms. Josephine, who bursts into spontaneous, pop-eyed recitations of Maya Angelou's poetry. Despite some initial setbacks, Gina's shop is soon a hub of neighborhood activity, at once upscale and down-home, where the owner's cappuccino and bottled water is complemented by fried catfish and collard greens dispensed from a cart by a scene-stealing vendor named Catfish Rita (Sheryl Underwood). The customers include local matrons (including one played by Della Reese), divaesque wives of professional athletes (including real-life diva wife Kimora Lee Simmons) and wealthy white women (Andie MacDowell, Mena Suvari) who follow Gina from Jorge's and soon discover that the warmth and high spirits make up for the lack of valet parking. And there's much more: a hunky, piano-playing electrician named Joe (Djimon Hounsou), a corrupt health inspector, and a local ragamuffin who shoots women's backsides with a video camera (thus allowing the director, Bille Woodruff, to balance the feminism of the script with a bit of discreet ogling). The plot of "Beauty Shop" is a loose, rambling affair, and not really the point of the movie. Gina is too hard-working and self-assured to be held back, and in any case, too much intrigue and worry would take precious time away from the relaxed, funny banter that is the movie's main reason for being. Another, of course, is money. The makers of the first "Barbershop" understood that a feel-good tale of small-scale urban capitalism could return revenues in the tens of millions, and in retrospect it is no surprise that that film's combination of hip-hop authenticity, relatively clean humor and commonsense conservatism found such a wide and diverse audience. "Beauty Shop," anchored in Queen Latifah's charisma, may be the biggest hit yet, coming as it does when PG-13 comedies with African-American stars are dominating the box office. The success of these pictures - "Are We There Yet?," "Hitch," "Guess Who," "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" - can no longer be described by the tired pop-cultural term crossover. This is what the mainstream looks like now. "Beauty Shop" is rated PG-13. It has some sexual humor and innuendo.

Queen Latifah struts her stuff with ingratiating verve in "Beauty Shop," a sunny and sassy comedy that somehow manages to breathe fresh life into familiar stereotypes and stock situations. A spin-off from the popular "Barbershop" franchise, pic doubtless will play well with ticketbuyers who flocked to recent sleeper "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" while also drawing a sizeable crossover aud. Down the road, this MGM release will be very, very attractive as homevid product.
Latifah effortlessly inhabits the lead role of Gina Norris, a character originally introduced in "Barbershop 2: Back in Business" as ex-girlfriend of Chicago barber Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube). Transplanted to Atlanta, where her young daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) studies piano at a prestigious music school, Gina starts out as a stylist at a trendy salon run by Jorge Christophe (Kevin Bacon), a haughty Eurotrash poseur with an Austrian accent and an acidic wit.
Ultimately enraged by Jorge's condescending ways, Gina quits to open her own beauty shop. Even with a hard-won bank loan, she can afford only a gone-to-seed salon in an inner-city neighborhood. But she presses forward, while instilling a new work ethic in a staff of headstrong stylists (Alfre Woodard, Golden Brooks and Sherri Shepherd).
With a little assist from Lynn (appealingly perky Alicia Silverstone), a semi-ditzy blonde shampoo girl who also fled Jorge's shop, and some electrical repair at the shop by Joe (smooth-moving Djimon Hounsou), her hunky upstairs neighbor, Gina gradually starts to thrive. She convinces two clients from Jorge's salon (Andie MacDowell, Mena Suvari) to frequent her new shop. But Jorge plays dirty when it comes to coping with competition.
Taking its cue from other recent workplace comedies with predominantly African-American casts, "Beauty Shop" is episodic and casually constructed, loping from one loosely connected scene to the next while colorful characters swap jokey dialogue. Conversations tend to be loud and feisty. Among the running gags: Female employees repeatedly question whether James (gamely played by Bryce Wilson), the shop's only male stylist, is a closeted gay or fashionable metrosexual.
To his credit, helmer Bille Woodruff ("Honey") maintains an easygoing vibe by refusing to let anything get too far out of hand. Even Jorge's deliciously fey camping is effectively modulated. Bacon's clearly having the time of his life in the role, but he's shrewd enough to recognize that less truly is more.
Don't misunderstand: The directorial restraint isn't too
 restrictive. Many of the supporting players make vivid impressions with hilarious character turns. (Woodard is a full-tilt hoot as a live wire who quotes Maya Angelou poetry with saucy fervor.) And yet, to a satisfyingly large degree, thesps remain in character without drifting far into caricature.
Scripters Kate Lanier and Norman Vance Jr., working from story by Elizabeth Hunter, don't completely shy away from the harsh realities of racial tensions, and even manage to pull off the revelation of a white supporting character's nasty side without melodramatic excess. For the most part, however, "Beauty Shop" is feel-good entertainment that is no less enjoyable for being somewhat predictable.
Standout tech values include ace lensing by Theo Van de Sande and music soundtrack peppered with well-chosen rap, hip-hop and oldies.

Guess Who   Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan   Columbia, in release
Professionally caustic and often brilliant, comedian Bernie Mac  still ain't got nothing on my pops and his friends. After I brought home a decidedly Nordic-featured lass (being a lighter shade of brown myself), my fatherwho, to his credit, won't spare his only son from a well-aimed jabshared with me what his friend had said after seeing my Nordiquette and me together: "Your boy done went Tiger Woods  on you." I had to smile because, well, that shit was funny, but funny because it hurt a little bitfunny because the hurt bled truth.
In Guess Who , Mac plays Spencer Tracy  to Ashton Kutcher 's Sidney Poitier  (yeah, I said it), racially inverting Stanley Kramer 's pointed, "pigmentation problem" classic, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner . Kutcher isshockno Poitier, and his performance as Mac's prospective son-in-law is largely textureless. But the screenwriters deserve a cowardly lion's share of the blame. At times no more than a collection of comedic set piecesMac and Kutch sharing a bed, listening to "Ebony and Ivory," or racing go-kartsthe film is predictable and its humor is tension free, ultimately hurting only Mac, whose lifeblood is his threateningly melodic cadence and irresistible I-say-what-you-scared-to-say vibe. Mac's acidic humor is often predicated on a challenge, revealing the truth at the heart of every quiphis goading of Kutcher to tell black jokes over dinner is Guess Who 's sole piece of geniusand the script's lack of nerve fails to challenge him or its audience with enough dangerous humor.

BEAUTY SHOP    Directed by Bille Woodruff    MGM, opens March 30
A morality play paradoxically pimping self-reliance and community, 2002's Barbershop  stresses the importance of its titular location as a haven for free speech. After being chastised for his boneheaded dismissal of Rosa Parks 's achievements, Cedric the Entertainer 's character asks: "If we can't talk straight in a barbershop, then where can we talk straight?" An extended riff on its progenitor, Beauty Shop also offers opportunities for trenchant observation, though the clientele prefers kinky sex advice to sociopolitical chitchat. Girls just wanna have fun, and so does the film, which recycles the requisite moralizing into a breezy, sporadically funny package. Queen Latifah  takes the Ice Cube  role, playing a cosmetologist who ditches a ritzy Atlanta salon in order to beautify the ladies DIY-style. Highlights include a drive-by bitching from her former boss and a deus ex machina in the form of a pint-sized booty hound.
