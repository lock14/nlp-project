The best you can say about "Harsh Times" is that it dispels any doubt that Christian Bale can be a South Central homeboy. (You were wondering, weren't you?) He plays Jim Davis , an honorably discharged Army Ranger, back from Afghanistan and self-destructing all over the streets of Los Angeles.
The part requires him to shoot, smoke, and go bonkers, sometimes with a Chicano-flavored accent. It's a big performance, built for a tragedy that this badly conceived movie never achieves.
Jim is a wastrel with rigid military bearing and a nasty sense of humor. He's trying to get back on his feet, but when his application at the LAPD gets rejected, his already-simmering temper threatens, repeatedly, to boil over into violence. He spends his days driving around the neighborhood, drinking 40s , getting high, listening to N.W.A., and trying to unload a cache of stolen guns. (Terry Crews and Chaka Forman, as two stops on his journey, are good in small parts.)
His sidekick and enabler is Mike, an affable, equally jobless slacker, played with an insecure adolescent's devotion by Freddy Rodriguez. Mike is always threatening to leave Jim alone, but who else, besides his upwardly mobile girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria), would he hang out with?
Mike dutifully waits in the car while Jim darkens the doorstep of an ex and, later, against Sylvia's wishes, he tags along on a trip across the border to visit Jim's Mexican fiancee (movingly played by Tammy Trull ) . He's trying to keep his buddy in check, but no one can soothe Jim's rage, and the film implies that his traumatized, loose-cannon status might have its occupational advantages. The military may have sent him home, and the LAPD might have turned him down, but ironically, the Department of Homeland Security expresses cautious interest.
Written and directed by David Ayer, who also wrote the incredibly similar "Training Day," "Harsh Times" means for us to understand Jim's meltdowns as a side effect of his military service. (Often during his outbursts, the camerawork and editing start tripping.) But if the movie is a comment on the dire straits of our returning soldiers, it's unconvincing. Presumably, the military knows Jim is viciously unstable yet does nothing to save him -- or us -- from himself . Too much screen time is given over to street-silly scenes with Mexican gang bangers and druggies, and not enough to the conflict between Jim's unthinking nihilism and his compulsion to belong to some kind of governmental system.
You can tell it's just the violence that turns Ayer on as a filmmaker -- the movie's displays of brutality are what leave an impression, and any parallel between the war in Afghanistan and the war on the L A streets seems tenuous. But the real problem with "Harsh Times" is Jim himself. Bale goes at the part with his usual intensity, but the character still seems like a psycho without psychology or a soul.


         "Harsh Times" goes down like the vinegar its protagonist chugs to try to beat a drug test. It's carefully crafted, exasperating and ugly, a festival of self-destructiveness, in all ways a reflection of its lead as brought to careening, erupting, implosive life by Christian Bale.
 
 Bale plays Jim Davis, a recently discharged Army Ranger trying to get his postwar life on track in South Los Angeles. Jim hopes to find some stability by joining the police department, and then bringing over and marrying his adoring sweetheart from rural Mexico. In the meantime, he and lifelong best friend Mike (Freddy Rodríguez of "Six Feet Under") are getting high, hammered and into trouble, just as they did in school. The difference between then and now is that today they're men, not boys, and the trouble they find is appropriately scaled. And Jim, haunted by his grisly war experiences, is not quite the fun-loving scrapper of his youth; Mike has no idea what his friend is capable of, or what he has done.
 


         






   Writer-director David Ayer, who reportedly grew up in neighborhoods like those in the film, brings an air of authenticity to the proceedings. The slang, the modes of dress, even the styles of fighting all have a high degree of specificity that lifts the movie above most urban crime dramas. Although viewers will be slapping their foreheads as the characters make one horrible choice after another, they won't be saying, "That could never happen." The action is well-staged, except for a clumsy opening flashback to the war.
 
 "Harsh Times" is a dark, brutal character study of an antihero along the lines of the sociopathic cop in Ayer's best-known script, "Training Day," the title rogue in "Bad Lieutenant" or even Alex the droog 
in "A Clockwork Orange." Despite the things that make Jim human — his apparent love for the doting Marta, his brotherhood with Mike, his post-traumatic stress disorder — audiences will be constantly conflicted over whether he should get the chance he craves, or a bullet in the head.
 
 But there's something almost naive about him, this arrested adolescent with no attention span and boyish-seeming dreams. In another life he might have been the townie who never went to college, or the big man on campus who didn't make the NFL. In this life, however, his "I wanna be a policeman" routine fills one with less sympathy than dread. As one sensible character — played by Eva Longoria — says, "My biggest nightmare is you with a badge."
 
 This is not a political film, but there is sickening irony when Jim is deemed psychologically unfit for the LAPD but welcomed into the ranks of Homeland Security.
 
 It's Mike whom viewers will worry about. He's the one who might have a chance of getting out of this ricocheting world of drugs and violence. Mike is torn between growing up — getting a real job for the sake of his relationship with longtime love Sylvia (Longoria, solid as the voice of reason) — and the irresistible pull of adventure and loyalty.
 
 The real story here is that Bale continues to establish himself as one of the most daring and committed actors of his generation. Since his icy, quotation-marked work in "American Psycho," he has brought dimension to the comic-book hero in "Batman Begins" and reduced himself to a complicated shadow in "The Machinist," among other memorable and varied performances. In "Harsh Times" he deftly switches register as Jim moves between worlds, from "Yo vato
" to "Yes sir" as his environment dictates. Although there are moments when Bale seems less than comfortable channeling his inner homie, he delivers an intense, unpredictable performance that makes even epically awful decisions seem plausible.

A loose directorial screw or two rattles throughout Harsh Times  and the narrative wheels fall off before the bullet-riddled finish of what might as well be called It's Training Day Again, Homey , but none of that really matters. All eyes are riveted on Christian Bale, tearing up the screen as ex-Army Ranger, war vet, and walking psych case Jim Davis. Sweating with post-traumatic nightmares, angling for the means to bring his Mexican sweetheart (Tammy Trull) over the border to be his bride in his South Central L.A. hood, and frequently hopped up on beer and weed, Jim is a human time bomb, buttoned into a jacket and tie and dreaming of a job in law enforcement. His unemployed childhood pal Mike (Six Feet Under 's Freddy Rodriguez) is less twitchy, but no less pressured, feeling the heat from his upwardly mobile girlfriend (Eva Longoria) to find work. Jim and Mike in a car with open beers make a lethal combo. Speechy slang is slung. Damage is done  guns pulled, innocents threatened  whenever Jim veers into madness.
David Ayer, who wrote both Training Day  and Harsh Times , specializes in fast and furious scripts, including The Fast and the Furious , about the rough L.A. of his own youth. He makes his feature directorial debut here, and you can see the skid marks as he fishtails. But Bale is mesmerizing and Rodriguez keeps up with him as the whole unsafe contraption zooms.

 Christian Bale is an actor who tries harder. In “Harsh Times,” his immersion in the role of an unhinged war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles offers the latest evidence that he will go to any lengths to nail down a character.  Yet Mr. Bales’s spectacular technical performance of   a toxic bad boy on the fast track to hell somehow lacks an inner core.  That  loathsome menace to society is  Jim Davis, about whom we are told little beyond the facts that he was an  Army ranger (whether in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan or Iraq remains unspecified) and left the service suffering from post-traumatic stress. Jim is as intense a character as Patrick Bateman, Mr. Bale’s yuppie serial killer in “American Psycho,” and Trevor Resnik, the cadaverous insomniac from “The Machinist,” for which the actor lost 60 pounds.  Whether stocky or emaciated, Mr. Bale has the look of a man staring into the abyss: think of the young Oliver North crossed with the Anthony Perkins of “Psycho.” The deep-set eyes in his handsome face are weirdly close together and their expression strangely opaque, as though all he sees are dead people.  “Harsh Times” is the directorial debut of David Ayer, who wrote its screenplay a decade ago, before his script for “Training Day,” which tells a similar story about a weakling under a bad influence. Both films portray raw American machismo as a disease and the buddy-buddy bond of two guys who goad each other into bad behavior as a psychological suicide pact. It suggests that on the mean streets of Los Angeles, men,  when asked to choose between spending time with their wives and girlfriends or getting in trouble with their pals, will always opt for trouble.  Jim is first seen awakening from a nightmare in the arms of his doting, all-forgiving Mexican sweetheart, Marta (Tammy Trull). But his hopes of bringing her to the United States and marrying her are shattered when his application to join the Los Angeles Police Department is rejected. He goes into an immediate tailspin, dragging his best friend, Mike Alvarez (Freddy Rodriguez) with him.  Mike is a downscale variation of Federico Diaz, Mr. Rodriguez’s character in the HBO series  “Six Feet Under.” Wearing a mustache and casting oily sidelong glances, he plays out the same internal battle between macho adolescent and devoted husband that tears at Federico. His shaky marriage to Sylvia (Eva Longoria), a lawyer he put through school while working as a telemarketer, is severely strained by his lengthening unemployment and his reluctance to look for work. As he follows Jim on his downward spiral, he deceives Sylvia by having Jim and other friends impersonate potential employers on his home answering machine.  Jim’s despair over his rejection from the L.A.P.D. lifts when the Department of Homeland Security calls, and the movie suggests an ugly  jockeying for manpower among local and federal agencies. Jim knows how to play the obsequious straight arrow when required, and he makes a good impression until he fails both his drug and polygraph tests. He is offered a job nonetheless, but it is in Colombia fighting the drug war and would prevent him from marrying Marta. Mike unexpectedly lucks out with a job interview with an old acquaintance.  By then, however, “Harsh Times” has signaled that the possibility for redemption is long past. For much of the movie, the pair rides around the neighborhood getting wasted on beer and pot and muddling through assorted brawls, robberies and shootings. A visit to an ex-girlfriend of Jim’s is interrupted by the arrival of her new boyfriend and his posse, and the pair end up with a gun.  When Jim insists they celebrate in a final spree to Mexico, Mike dutifully tears himself away from his disgusted wife, and off they go. Jim’s psychosis kicks in during a party at Marta’s shack, and he has the first of several breaks that the rudimentary cinematography portrays in garish,  wobbly multiple exposures.  “Harsh Times” purports to reflect Mr. Ayer’s background, but much of the flashy gangbanger argot he wields sounds forced and unconvincing. The film builds to a melodramatic finale that would like to make you weep, but by then it has worn out your patience. These losers are too repellent to waste time feeling sorry for.  “Harsh Times” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, profanity and sexual situations.

A psychotic seizure of a performance by Christian Bale dominates "Harsh Times," the directorial debut of David Ayer that channels "Taxi Driver" while also feeling like a dry run for Ayer's subsequently written "Training Day." Bale's showy turn as a 'round-the-bend Gulf War vet and the pic's sensationalistic treatment of modern ills will likely induce a distrib and some viewers to bite. But the relish with which the film pursues its deterministic negativity will turn off most audiences.
As if transfixed by a role that matches in emotional extremes the physical extremes he embraced in "The Mechanist," Bale takes possession of his crazed character here to an alarming degree. Haunted by Gulf War memories, his Jim Davis is still perfectly capable of dressing in coat and tie and putting on a responsible, civilized front, as well as of convincing his south-of-the-border girlfriend that he loves her and will get her a visa to come to the U.S.
But left to his own devices, Jim is a world-class screw-up, an overloaded circuit of nasty attitudes, devilish intentions and antisocial and illegal proclivities whose only predictable trait is to incite confrontation and violence.
To the weak-willed, the loquacious Jim can be mightily persuasive, and so it is with childhood pal Mike (Freddy Rodriguez), a nice kid who tells his upwardly mobile g.f. Sylvia (Eva Longoria) that he'll be spending the day job hunting. But when Jim is rejected for his dream career with the LAPD, he goes ballistic, inducing Mike to get high with him as prelude to a drive through Los Angeles' societal twilight.
Script was written, with Sundance Lab input, in 1996, and its dynamic closely resembles that of "Training Day." Both involve a malleable young man being morally led astray by a charismatically corrupt partner, largely while cruising around threatening neighborhoods.
It's a potent dramatic set-up, especially with a commanding actor like Denzel Washington or Bale playing the hard-ass. A lot of the stuff Jim pulls possesses a voyeuristic amusement quotient in direct proportion to its outrageousness.
The crunch arrives when Jim gets a job offer from Homeland Security. Ayer the sociopolitical commentator weighs in heavily here, stressing how the government is willing to employ Jim knowing full well what a loose cannon he is; as Mike says in wonderment, "The craziest head I know is gonna be a Fed."
Catch is that the job is working the anti-drug beat in the hottest spots in Colombia, forcing Jim to decide between his law enforcement career and his loving Mexican honey. No surprise that the physical manifestation of Jim's inner tension isn't pretty or violence-free.
As a study of mental imbalance and living two lives at once, Bale's work here can be placed on the same shelf as his chilling perf in "American Psycho." Actor's investment in Jim Davis seems complete, his transformations between the two sides of his personality seamless and frighteningly convincing.
Unfortunately, Jim's cohort, Mike, doesn't play off him nearly as effectively as Ethan Hawke's green cop did opposite his would-be mentor in "Training Day." Mike can't score any points up against either Jim or the feisty Sylvia, and Rodriguez, try as he might, can't elevate him out of pushover status.
Most of the supporting cast seems juiced by their physically upfront roles, and Ayer's dialogue often crackles. Stylistically, however, the pic is routine, marked by standard visual coverage and a generally unattractive look. When your model is clearly "Taxi Driver," a lack of directorial flair is especially conspicuous.

Cops-gone-wild movies are the Angry White Guy counterpoint to thug-life melodramas. This caffeinated fit of antihero worshipthe directorial debut of screenwriter David Ayer , who made detective with his bad-cop thrillers Training Day  and Dark Blue straddles the genres: A ballistic ex-ranger (Christian Bale ) embarks on a substance-abusing sojourn through South Central, followed by the inevitable cathartic violence. But whatever political statement Ayer intended to make with his Gulf War veteran turned human time bomb is swamped by the movie's obnoxious badass envy, and Bale's gloating display of American-psycho fireworks, the kind of vein-popping show-boating that might as well be performed in a mirror.
