Stone�s latest head-first dive into the deep end of the American political pool is a tale of two movies: one a humanizing portrait of a failure as a young man, the other a damning but unsurprising look inside an administration gone loopy on ideological zealotry. The first is a story that was dying to be told; the second, one that�s been told to death. Stone�s young George W. Bush (played with gusto by Brolin) is a Horatio Alger hero in reverse: Born into wealth and power, he chooses to wallow in the mire of fleeting romantic affairs, intellectual indifference, meaningless day jobs, and alcohol (especially alcohol) rather than buy into his role as the standard-bearer of the Bush legacy. Stone shoots these early years as a brisk, irreverent romp, matching his hero�s brazenness and immaturity step for boozy step. He cuts quickly from the future president�s fraternity hazing at Yale to his abbreviated courtship of a self-possessed young librarian named Laura (Banks), from his first unsuccessful foray into politics (highlighted by a wonderful but bruising debate between Bush and his opponent, Kent Hance, in the 1978 race for Texas� 19th Congressional District where the inexperienced Republican learns a valuable lesson in the art of cutthroat politics) to his eventual rebirth as an evangelical Christian and his rise to the governorship of Texas. Had Stone stopped there and gone deeper, had he probed more subtly the Freudian angst and self-doubt of an heir apparent to a stern and disappointed father (would anyone put it past Stone to paint a sitting American president as Henry V?), had he examined more closely Bush�s political education at the feet of mastermind Karl Rove, then I might just be sitting here telling you about a new masterpiece from the man who brought us JFK
 and Nixon
. Instead, as W.
 settles into the White House, Stone the partisan rabble-rouser gradually overpowers Stone the artist, turning his movie into yet another condemnation of the ideological strong-arming that led us into Iraq and the administrative bumbling that got us mired there. In our age of 24-hour news coverage, this rehashing of current events doesn�t just come off familiar but completely unnecessary. And, worst of all, prosaic. Gone are the visual grandeur and sweeping narrative scope that raised Stone�s previous political films to the level of art and their heroes to the bracing heights of tragedy, replaced by an uninspired and unfocused recapitulation of some of the darkest events in modern American political history.


In 'W.,' Oliver Stone frames his biopic as a provocative and uniquely American tale of family politics
Is there an easier target than a lame duck? "W.," the first biopic ever made about a sitting US president, is either two years too late or 15 too early. George W. Bush hardly seems to matter anymore; attention has shifted to the two men who are vying to clean up the mess his administration has left behind. As it should. Who needs more Dubya taunting when there's work to be done?
The irony is that Oliver Stone is aiming for something rather different here, and the results still feel tentative. For his third "president" film (the others being "JFK" and the much-underrated "Nixon"), the lightning-rod director casts the life of the 43d commander in chief as a peculiarly American tragedy: The story of a child of privilege who's also the family screw-up, whose aching need to prove himself to his father delivers his country into the hands of ambitious and predatory men.
Or, as the woman behind me said as the end-credits rolled, "I . . . I felt sorry for him."
Her confusion will be shared by many - partisans of the left will never extend compassion to George W. Bush and those on the right don't want this kind of sympathy - but it's a novel approach, and when it works, "W." can take your breath away. When it doesn't, you can feel Stone still working out his feelings toward the man. There's a lot of Charles Foster Kane in "W.," and some of Shakespeare's Richard II. There's also more than a little Oliver Stone.
Josh Brolin ("No Country for Old Men") plays the president, and it's an honorable performance, wholly lacking in cheap shots. (The soundtrack full of tinny pomp-and-circumstance tunes picks up that slack.) This Dubya is simple rather than simple-minded, a good old boy who acts first and thinks later, if at all. He's a decent sort, spoiled but likably cocky, and his biggest flaw is that he doesn't have the skills to articulate what's eating his insides out.
That would be his father, George H.W. Bush, played by James Cromwell ("L.A. Confidential") as a patient but peremptory blueblood king. Dubya knows he'll never measure up to Poppy's standards - so does Poppy and so do we; anyway, brother Jeb (Jason Ritter) has been anointed heir apparent - and the frustration turns him to drink, rebellion, God, and politics, in that order.
"W." unfolds in two collage-like narrative streams: The series of White House meetings in 2003 leading up to the Iraq war and flashbacks to the many stages of George W. Bush's past. The former are where Stone pulls out the stops, and they are marvelously comic works of pseudo-history, cobbled together from the published memoirs of those who were there.
The casting here is downright fiendish: Scott Glenn as a fatuously double-talking Donald Rumsfeld ("The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, Mr. President"); Bruce McGill as a phlegmatic George Tenet; comedian Rob Corddry as press secretary Ari Fleischer; Toby Jones (the other Capote) as a munchkin Karl Rove; Dennis Boutsikaris, a schlumpy Paul Wolfowitz. Thandie Newton's Condoleezza Rice is the closest the movie comes to "Saturday Night Live" caricature, but it's a cruelly brilliant cartoon nonetheless, a symphony of awkward postures and nasal speech patterns.
Two of the president's men stand out: Secretary of State Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright) and Vice President Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss). The latter is a gray eminence on the sidelines until he has his Dr. Strangelove moment in front of a map of the oil fields of the Middle East, uttering the chilling (and wholly unsourced) words, "There is no exit strategy. We stay."
Wright's Powell, forever counseling caution, gets the dialogue that's the heart of the 2003 scenes, though. "Why?," he asks. "Why Iraq? Why now?" Stone provides the answer in the flashback scenes, as George the son spends years twisting in the patrician scorn of George the father. Cromwell's Poppy isn't a thunderer - Barbara Bush (a live-wire Ellen Burstyn) is the emotional bad cop of the family - but his measured, diplomatic distance is, if anything, harder to live up to.
"W." says W. would do anything to gain this man's respect, and after Saddam Hussein and the 1992 election humble the elder Bush, the prodigal son spends years planning his revenge. The tragedy, as Stone sees it (and he's hardly alone), is that the country and the world are still paying for our president's daddy issues.
Cheapjack Freudianism? Arrant fantasy? Certainly. Provocative and rudely entertaining? More than you'd think. Because "W." wants us to understand the man, though, Stone pulls his punches in ways that don't always work. I appreciate the movie's non-hysterical treatment of Bush's religious conversion - out of nowhere, Stone pulls Stacy Keach to play a composite reverend figure, and the aging lion is unexpectedly touching - and Elizabeth Banks's gentle Laura Bush softens both the movie and its protagonist.
Yet the operatic tendencies that are Stone's strength and weakness as a filmmaker are muzzled here, and it may be that this psychodrama hits too close to home for a filmmaker known for his own struggles against a larger-than-life father. Late in the film, there's a dream sequence in which Bush Sr. lets his wayward son have it right between the eyes, right in the Oval Office. It's a striking moment, but it doesn't carry the devastating impact - the Olympian fury toward one man's betrayal of family and nation - that it aims for. Stone's pity for his subject ennobles the film and hobbles it at the same time.
"W." shudders to a halt a few scenes later, its anger unresolved. Leaving the theater, you may have the sudden sense that, really, it is too early for this movie to have been made, as sharp and as complicated as some of its pieces are. Historical perspective takes years. So does therapy. You be the judge of which we'll be needing more.


As his second term as the 43rd President of the United States concludes in national financial upheaval, the real George W. Bush is a figure more confounding and complex than any dramatist is likely to conjure, either in tragedy or comedy. It takes a showman doing a heckuva job, armed with that bipartisan quality called chutzpah, to even try. Enter Oliver Stone, stage leftish.
In W. , the un-shy filmmaker (who, in JFK  and Nixon , made big-screen entertainment out of presidents only after  they left office) attempts to do for a sitting Commander-in-Chief what a parade of journalists, psychoanalysts, pundits, theologians, talk-show hosts, and bloggers have not yet been able to accomplish: synthesize compassion and criticism, satire and sympathy, and put the flawed man in the context of personal history and global consequence. Stone doesn't pull off the experiment either  he's a blustery, big-gesture movie guy working on a proudly tight shooting schedule, not a patient, precise biographer aiming at wisdom for the ages. And I suspect W.  will look like an even skimpier drama-club production by Jan. 20, 2009, when the real W. exits the White House, stage right. But there is a certain irresistible time-capsule interest to Stone’s uneven project. Both in front of and behind the camera, from creators and characters alike, this movie has got the fascinating, clumsy rhythms of blind men (they’re mostly men) trying to describe an elephant (a Republican pachyderm), bravely fronted by one intrepid explorer with his eyes wide open, looking for nuance.
The intrepid one is the outstanding Josh Brolin, who does such a phenomenal job in the title role that he carries every scene he's in to a place of subtlety and integrity far beyond what Stone needs to make his attention-grabbing noise. Brolin is clearly party leader  nailing Bush's posture and gestures without stooping to easy mannerism, conveying the contradictions of a polarizing president with real generosity, inflecting every trademark heh-heh  with a reason for being that makes the old heh-heh  sound new. But with every decision except  his trust in Brolin, Stone settles for an easier path, counting on a friendly audience to laugh, cringe, or despair ahead  of cue so he doesn't have to commit to his own attitudes about the man he's ''studying'' with supposed dispassion. His approach is a weaselly approximation of fair and balanced. The director fixes on the fumbles and entitlements of an intellectually incurious son struggling to please a disappointed patrician father as the Freudian through-line in a Greek tragedy/SNL  comedy; then he strings together reenactments of various specific events in the younger Bush's life, assuming, I guess, that they'll somehow accumulate and coagulate  mixing with what that friendly audience knows about Bush  into a larger picture of a screwed-up guy who screwed up.
But those vignettes don't accrue effectively, not least in fantasy sequences during which Bush (who at one time aspired to be the commissioner of baseball) imagines himself in his own field of dreams, accepting the approving roar of an imaginary stadium crowd. (The chuckleheaded script is by Stanley Weiser, a longtime Stone collaborator who wrote Wall Street .) The moments Stone and Weiser select to sketch Bush's character are more of a jumble than a natural progression. ''Junior'' endures a fraternity hazing; he meets his future wife, Laura (Elizabeth Banks, a gentle presence); he hates and needs the help  the bailout!  of his father-the-former-president, George H.W. Bush (James Cromwell, at a rare loss for clarity); he stops drinking and finds spiritual rebirth in evangelical Christianity. Of course, he also decides to invade Iraq in 2003, with thumbs up from Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss), Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn), Condoleezza Rice (Thandie Newton, on the far side of parody), Karl Rove (Toby Jones), and George Tenet (Bruce McGill), while Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright) plays the wildly simplified role of designated Republican-with-a-conscience. Oh, and Stone also adds the scene where Bush chokes on a pretzel while watching sports on TV at the White House. Why? Because it's a cheap laugh.
At least Brolin is never cheap. Representing a man who finds both salvation in Jesus and relief that one of his intelligence reports is only three pages long, the actor digs deep. He's the A  in W. , heh-heh . The rest is C+ .

 The megamillion-dollar question that hovers over Oliver Stone’s queasily enjoyable “W.,” his Oedipal story about the rise and fall, fall, fall of George W. Bush is: why? Neither a pure (nor impure) sendup of the president nor a wholesale takedown, the film looks like a traditional biopic with all the usual trappings, including name actors in political drag — Josh Brolin plays the frat boy who would be king, while Richard Dreyfuss creeps around in a Dick Cheney sneer — alternately choking on pretzels and spleen, and reciting all the familiar lines and lies. History is said to repeat itself as tragedy and farce, but here it registers as a full-blown burlesque.  Mr. Stone’s take on the president, as comic as it is sincere, is bound to rile ax-grinders of every ideological stripe, particularly those who mistake fiction for nonfiction. History informs its narrative arc from Texas to Iraq, but it should go without saying that this is a work of imagination, a directorial riff on real people and places complete with emotion-tweaking music cues, slo-mo visuals and portentous symbolism. It says nothing new or insightful about the president, his triumphs and calamities. (As if anyone goes to an Oliver Stone movie for a reality check.) But it does something most journalism and even documentaries can’t or won’t do: it reminds us what a long, strange trip it’s been to the Bush White House.  In “W.” that trip starts with the middle-aged Bush wearing the number 43 and standing on a baseball field in an otherwise empty stadium. When the off-screen announcer introduces him — “the 43rd president of the United States!” — he looks around for the crowd that isn’t there. It’s a potent image, and while Mr. Stone overuses it, returning Bush to his, er, field of dreams once too often, it works to underscore the film’s ideas about life, political and otherwise, as a performance. In the story Bush burns through one job and identity after another — partying student, imperfect son, indifferent oilman, serial flirt, attentive husband, sports guy, born-again Christian, newly born politician — before taking on the role of a lifetime.  Mr. Stone obviously doesn’t think the role fits, though he goes easier on Mr. Bush on screen than some of his off-screen remarks suggest. In a recent televised schmooze session with Larry King, Mr. Stone characterized the real 40-year-old Mr. Bush as “a bum.”  But the movie shows him more as a boozing womanizer, a spoiled son of power and privilege — James Cromwell plays George H. W. Bush, and Ellen Burstyn does a comically mean Barbara Bush — who, swaddled in privilege and hurting for love (a familiar Stone fixation), doesn’t stick with a single book, job or woman. That all changes with Jesus Christ and a little lady named Laura (Elizabeth Banks), twinned epiphanies who steer him down the path of righteousness and over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Mr. Brolin eases through these transitions effortlessly, but it’s a necessarily incomplete performance because, like all the major White House Players, his character looms too large in our lives for him to fully possess. It can be disconcerting when actors play historical figures, and it’s infinitely stranger  when those figures aren’t obscured by time. But it’s one thing to watch Paul Giamatti scowling about in a presidential wig, as he did in the recent HBO mini-series “John Adams.” It’s something entirely different to watch Mr. Brolin sloppily downing drinks in a pantomime of the current president’s younger self, a figure that doesn’t belong to history but to the present and, by extension, to us. Good as he is, he can’t touch the original.  “W.” isn’t as visually baroque as “JFK” (1991) and “Nixon” (1995), Mr. Stone’s darker, more ambitious excursions into the American psyche and presidency, partly because, I think, he does not yet have enough aesthetic distance from his subject and partly because he seems keen to weigh in as more evenhanded than usual. But while he has tamped down his style, he retains a pleasingly fluid approach to narrative. The story repeatedly shifts between scenes of the younger Bush meandering through his life, and the older Bush navigating through the early stages of the Iraq war. This shuttling across time and space undercuts the drama — the story doesn’t so much build as restlessly circle back — but it puts into visual terms Mr. Stone’s ideas about the present and past being mutually implicated.  That’s fine, often better than fine, though it’s hard not to wish that Mr. Stone had put history into more dynamic play with politics and ideology and given the Big Daddy Bush thing a bit of a rest. Mr. Cromwell does a nice job imitating a block of wood, but there are only so many ways to voice patrician displeasure. Because the film spends so much time on the pre-presidential younger Bush — first glimpsed marinating in vodka in 1966 — and ends sometime in 2004, more than a year into Iraq, it can’t help feeling like a prologue to a more involved story. At a compressed 129 minutes, it only gestures in some directions (Sept. 11), though Mr. Dreyfuss’s impersonation of Mr. Cheney pulling a Dr. Strangelove speaks volumes, encyclopedias.  Because “W.” focuses on the warm-up and not the meltdown, it leans more toward comedy than toward tragedy, a crucial exception being the graphic images of wounded and dead Iraqis and American soldiers that Mr. Stone drops late into the film and that  stuff the laughs right back down your throat. This may be a comedy of errors, Mr. Stone seems to be saying, but it’s a murderously costly one. The intrusion of real horror is bluntly effective, though there is something at once morally and structurally suspect about the use of such images in any fiction entertainment, no matter how high-minded and well intended. It’s not just that the dead can’t argue against their commercial exploitation, but Mr. Stone can’t get to where I think he’s trying to go — deep — without them.  He does go deep at that moment, though I’m glad, wrung out by off-screen reality, that he doesn’t stay there long. In “W.” he doesn’t need to haul out the dead or excavate the depths to keep us hooked: he just needs to show Condoleezza Rice (Thandie Newton) tightly smiling while Bush rants; Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) flaunting his contempt for presidential power by savoring a piece of pie — Bush has given up sweets to show support for the troops — and Barbara Bush snapping her fingers at the family dog as if calling for its head. The pleasure of Mr. Stone’s work has never been located in restraint but in excess, a commitment to extremes that can drown out the world or, as in this film, give it newly vivid, hilarious and horrible form.  “W.” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film has some extremely graphic images of real war and some expletives.  W.

Oliver Stone�s unusual and inescapably interesting �W.� feels like a rough draft of a film it might behoove him to remake in 10 or 15 years. The director�s third feature to hinge on a modern-era presidency, after �JFK� and �Nixon,� offers a clear and plausible take on the current chief executive�s psychological makeup and, considering Stone�s reputation and Bush�s vast unpopularity, a relatively even-handed, restrained treatment of recent politics. For a film that could have been either a scorching satire or an outright tragedy, �W.� is, if anything, overly conventional, especially stylistically. The picture possesses dramatic and entertainment value, but beyond serious filmgoers curious about how Stone deals with all this president�s men and women, it�s questionable how wide a public will pony up to immerse itself in a story that still lacks an ending.
Heavily researched but made very quickly -- pic went before the cameras in May and is being rushed into release before the November election -- �W.� has the benefit of filmmaking energy and good performances where they count, beginning with Josh Brolin�s arresting turn in the leading role. One can�t say Brolin is 
George W. Bush -- the real one is still all too noticeably with us -- but the actor offers a more than reasonable physical approximation and an interpretation that�s convincingly boisterous and determined. Aspects of the man unknown to the public are put forward that may or may not be true but are sufficiently believable to make one go with them in a movie. 
Opening with a post-9/11 cabinet meeting in the Oval Office in which the phrase �axis of evil� was concocted, then jumping back in time to begin a procession of key events in the life of a privileged party boy with something to prove, Stone and his �Wall Street� scenarist Stanley Weiser position the film, above all, as a father-son story. Long uncertain what his role in life is meant to be, the young George W. is severely chastised by his patrician father for his wayward behavior -- �What do you think you are, a Kennedy?,� blares George Sr. (James Cromwell) after one of his son�s drunken escapades -- but is nonetheless always let off the hook and given another chance by his father, who lacks the cojones to truly leave W. to his own devices and, later, to pursue Saddam Hussein to Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf War.
As the film continues to bounce back and forth between the Iraq-dominated presidency and George W.�s unlikely transformation from a life as a ne�er-do-well rich kid to one of born-again Christianity, sobriety, ambition and resolve, it occasionally delivers intimations of looming tragedy, or at least of history that didn�t have to unfold as it did. But the film is unable to achieve more than a sort of engaging pop-history pageant and amateur, if not inapt, psychological evaluation, due to the unavoidable lack of perspective and a final act that has yet to be written. When the Texas flashbacks finally catch up with the Washington, D.C., framing device, the film suddenly becomes a half-documentary about the Iraq war, changing the tone as well as the up-close-and-personal feel.
The younger Bush is portrayed in lively fashion, much as one has always heard him described. First glimpsed in a metal tub being hazed for Yale frathouse membership, Dubya drinks hard, consorts with floozies, can�t hold a job, gets into Harvard Business School only thanks to Dad and loses a run for Congress in Texas, as he�s portrayed by his down-home opponent as �a carpetbagger from Connecticut�; afterward, in a memorable phrase, W. promises, �There�s no way I�ll ever be out-Texased or out-Christianed again.� He�s also fortunate early on to meet the right woman, Laura (Elizabeth Banks), a smart lady who readily recognizes his foibles but supports him step by step.
After years of aimlessness, the born-again moment arrives in the mid-�80s, when W. trades the bottle for Jesus. A few years later, when he sets his sights on the popular Ann Richards� job, Ellen Burstyn, playing Barbara Bush, gets perhaps the film�s biggest laugh when, confronted with her son�s plans, she yelps, �Governor of Texas? You must be joking!� Dad tries to talk him into waiting four years, until 1998, so Jeb (Jason Ritter) can lock up the Florida job first, but by now, W. is his own man, unwilling to follow his father�s orders or play second fiddle to his better-liked brother.
Stone and Weiser make no attempt to cover historical bases; major episodes, including political campaigns, business alliances and elections, are completely omitted. Most scenes are devoted to illuminating particular aspects of George W. -- examined in pithy interludes are his recklessness, people skills, insecurities, reliance upon Laura, impatience, belief that good will prevail and unwillingness to deviate once he�s made up his mind. Stone stands back as if to strenuously avoid the appearance of judging his subject even as he pigeonholes him psychologically.
In the contemporary White House passages, however, it is not as easy to entirely avoid commentary and caricature. Many individual scenes are engrossing: a lunch with Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) in which the vice president maneuvers to get his way on the treatment of prisoners but is abruptly told by his boss to �keep your ego in check�; the many attempts by Secretary of State Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright) to argue for a prudent course on Iraq, all of which are met with clucking disdain from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn); George Sr.�s reluctance to declare himself �born again� to shore up his support among �the base�; and Cheney�s chilling answer to the question of what the exit strategy from Iraq will be: -- �There is no exit. We stay.�
Docu-like feel of the latter stretch is emphasized by the sudden use of extensive real footage of Iraq, the �Mission Accomplished� aircraft carrier stunt and a Bush speech before the joint Houses of Congress, with the actors blended in with actual politicos. Pic thus enters TV territory, to its detriment, and Stone has no choice but to end on an ambiguously fanciful note that can mean anything you want it to mean.
For the most part, Stone and his actors meet the basic requirements of pulling off this quick-draw portrait of still-evolving history, but one late sequence -- of Georges Sr. and Jr. preparing to duke it out in a bare Oval Office -- suggests the sort of stylistic imagination and audacious poetic flight that would have given the film some real heft. No visual correlatives or subjective projections of mood or attitude are offered, as they have been in past Stone films. Dominating are borderline distorted closeups, especially of Brolin, along with shadowy lighting and generally lackluster lensing. Some of the song choices are downright sophomoric in their too-obvious irony.
Along with Brolin, top performances/impersonations are provided by Banks, whose Laura Bush goes a long way toward clarifying the close marital bond; Cromwell, who may not be a dead ringer for George H. W. Bush but delivers the full intended force of his character in several key scenes; Toby Jones as the ever-present Karl Rove; and, despite hints at editorializing, Dreyfuss, who may only present a caricature of Cheney but seems so physically and attitudinally on the money that he�s instantly recognizable and acceptable.
Rather more iffy are Glenn as Rumsfeld, Thandie Newton as Condi Rice and Burstyn as Barbara; these roles are brief, so either the actors must register quickly as right or they don�t. Great actor that he is, Wright just doesn�t possess the same physical bearing as Powell. Stacy Keach, as the preacher who helps lead W. through his religious conversion, and Bruce McGill, as CIA director George Tenet, do well in some intense scenes.
Shot mostly in and around Shreveport, La., pic boasts solid, if not elaborate, production values. 


W. may be less frenzied than the usual Oliver Stone  sensory bombardment, but in revisiting the early '00s by way of the late '60s, this psycho-historical portrait of George W. Bush  has all the queasy appeal of a strychnine-laced acid flashback.
Hideous recreations of the shock-and-awful recent past merge with extravagant lowlights from the formative years and early career of America's most disastrous president (crudely played by Josh Brolin , often in tight close-up). Familiar faces seem to deliquesce before our eyes. It's unavoidably trippy, but does anyone, other than the perpetrators, really need to relive this particular purple haze?
W. , which is as much edited as it is directed, working from a script by Stone buddy Stanley Weiser , has a patchwork chronology that takes as its central pattern the run-up to the Iraq  War and ensuing search for the missing weapons of mass destruction, while pushing two theses regarding the nature of its eponymous antihero.
The more heavy-handed of these dramatizes Dubya's tormented relationship, alternately worshipful and rebellious, with his disapproving father (James Cromwell ). "What do you think you are—a Kennedy?" Poppy thunders when confronted with his wastrel son's latest drunken indiscretion. "You're a Bush!" It's the Oedipal saga that Maureen Dowd , for one, began recounting during the 2000 election, and reached its climax when the son corrected his father's error by deposing Saddam Hussein .
In this scenario, the younger Bush became president to take revenge on the elder. Stone has Dubya watching the 1992 election returns with his family. As defeated Poppy chokes back tears, Dubya trumps even the bilious, class-fueled anti-Clinton rage expressed by mother Barbara (Ellen Burstyn ) in ranting about H.W.'s failure to go all the way to Baghdad . This W.  is the saga of a tormented, father-obsessed asshole who manages to play out his family drama on a world-historical stage.
The second thesis—implicit in Kevin Phillips 's chronicle of the Bush family's ascent, American Dynasty , and developed elsewhere—credits Dubya with a powerful insight into American politics. Having checked his alcoholism with a regimen of fundamentalist Bible study and consequently served as Poppy's liaison to the Christian right, the younger Bush assimilated Christian values rhetoric and successfully organized an evangelical base which would enable him to pulverize John McCain  in the 2000 primaries and win re-election in 2004.
Although W.  dramatizes neither of these campaigns—generally eschewing the public Bush in favor of his assumed backstage persona—Stone and Weiser go so far as to cast their antihero as the real Lee Atwater , suggesting that it was his canny appreciation for dirty tricks that got Poppy elected in 1988, years before self-identified "fairy" Karl Rove  taught him his political catechism. But undermining his own theory, Stone presents Dubya as an idiot savant who believes his own bullshit, warning Poppy that too much thinking screws up the mind and bragging that he's decided to run for president because God told him to.
Although personality regularly trumps political process in the world of Oliver Stone, W.  seems most deeply concerned with the run-up to the Iraq war, thus working the same territory as David Hare 's play, Stuff Happens . Each given a presidential nickname to wear like a baseball cap, Bush's enablers—Dick "Vice" Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss , having evident fun), Donald "Rummy" Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn ), Condi "Girl" Rice (Thandie Newton , looking as though she's going to gag), Karl "Boy Genius" Rove (Toby Jones ), and "Brother" George Tenet  (Bruce McGill )—confound the cautious and rational Colin "Colin" Powell  (Jeffrey Wright ) to lead the republic toward disaster.
Not fair (not a problem) and definitely not balanced: The least-nuanced performance in a film full of cartoon characterizations is Brolin's Bush. A simian slob, modeled on Andy Griffith 's raucous run-amok in A Face in the Crowd  and given to bad-tempered pronouncements while stuffing his face, Brolin uses stupidity as a crucifix. He wards off sympathy as though it were a vampire. In directing Brolin, Stone is disinclined to give the devil his due. Bush's mean-spirited charm is nowhere evident—despite the devotion he inspires in wife Laura. What exactly is this sweet young hottie (Elizabeth Banks ) supposed to see in him?
What are we? W.  can't decide whether its aspirations are Shakespearean tragedy, political critique, or cathartic black comedy. The emotionally reductive Stone really only had a shot at the latter. At its best, W . suggests Stuff Happens  reconfigured for the cast of Saturday Night Live  . Running through Bush's greatest bits—choking on a potato chip, confusing Guantánamo  with "Guantanamera," calling himself "the decider," complaining that he's always been misunderestimated by Saddam Hussein—W.  begs the question posed by its two theses. Like, how did this stunted creature, who considers his greatest mistake to have been trading Sammy Sosa  from the Texas Rangers , become our king? (The fault, I'm afraid, lies not in our stars. . . .)
Released early in the 1992 campaign, JFK  did its modest part to destabilize the first Bush's Republican nation and contribute to Bill Clinton 's Kennedy-identified juggernaut. To the degree that W.  is able to make itself present in the hurly-burly of the election's final weeks, it should prove mildly helpful to the Democrats. Cable news won't be able to resist the movie's most outrageous scenes, and such blatant Bush bludgeoning should compel a few Republican pols and right-wing pundits to rise to their maligned leader's defense.
