If neither your sister with the shady, chauvinist husband nor the two bookies trying to shake down 25 grand from your jazz-musician brother can make it to Thanksgiving dinner, don't worry. They're probably at the Whitfield's, and you can mosey down to the megaplex to collect them, along with all the other made-for-TV craziness afoot in "This Christmas," one of those overstaffed, overstuffed "when do we eat?" holiday dramedies. Call it a double-extra-strength episode of "Soul Food."
Regina King shares the movie with a lot of talented actors and pretty faces playing the Whitfields  - six grown kids, one semi-neurotic mother (Loretta Devine), and their assorted significant others. This is a loving family with just enough bitterness for almost every scene to culminate in a showdown.
King plays Lisa, the sister who resents having not gone to college in order to help maintain the family's Los Angeles-area dry-cleaning business. As a consolation, she did marry a haughty Princeton grad (Laz Alonzo). But her sister Kelli (the excellent Sharon Leal) knows he's not worth a damn. He makes Lisa wait on him, raise his two kids, and tries to get her to convince her siblings to sell the store and the family house so he can put the proceeds to selfish personal ends.
There is much more. Claude (Columbus Short, from "Stomp the Yard") has come home from the military with a gun and a few secrets. Those furtive phone calls he makes shamelessly bait you into thinking he's gay (the movie's not that daring). But what he is hiding would definitely be headline news at my holiday dinner. Meanwhile, Quentin (Idris Elba) shows up on the run from the aforementioned bookies and hates hates hates his mother's "friend," Joe Black (Delroy Lindo), basically for not being his own daddy, a music man who ran off years ago, but whom his mother, called Ma'Dere, can't get over.
Obviously, "This Christmas" is unreasonably chock-full of everything  - there's even a part for the seductive charms of executive producer Mekhi Phifer as a Whitfield suitor. And what exactly is Lupe Ontiveros to this family besides the woman who stands in the kitchen while everybody else talks?
With all due respect to the imagination of the writer and director, Preston A. Whitmore II, the movie's kitchen-sink tone, defensively bourgeois characters, and embrace of the rambunctious over the realistic is not terribly far removed from Tyler Perry territory. When King squirts baby oil on the bathroom floor as a prelude to comic retaliation, I could imagine Perry kicking himself for not coming up with that first. The scene brings down the house.
As with Perry's movies and plays, "This Christmas" is well stocked with crowd-pleasing options. Don't like the plot about Claude and his problems? Then maybe the  story line involving the singing dancer Chris Brown as "Baby" Whitfield will do the trick. It did the night I saw the movie. When the camera finds him sitting shirtless, it was scream at first sight. (His tattoos are never this legible on an iPod screen.) Brown performs two whole songs  - one in a club, one in a church. The two settings capture the movie's bi-devotional spirit (it's secular and worshipful at the same time). They're also proof that when he's not out of breath Brown can croon.
But the movie, with its almost pathological need to please, ends with a cast-wide "Soul Train Line" where Brown does get to do his hydraulic dance moves. It's unnecessary, but maybe more movies should take this route. Who wouldn't love to have seen Russell Crowe do the cabbage patch at the end of "American Gangster"?

Can I be adopted by the Whitfields? Everyone in this madly good-looking clan has got soapy problems as befits an aspirational, say-amen holiday movie. But reunite the family This Christmas  in the big, beautiful L.A. house of the indefatigable matriarch known as Ma' Dere and it's all good. Mostly because the cast is such a powerhouse group, beginning with a blazing Loretta Devine (Grey's Anatomy ) as Ma' Dere, Delroy Lindo as her man, The Wire 's Idris Elba as prodigal eldest son, and the great Regina King (24 ) as bossy oldest sister.

 In movies the holidays are a time when families come together, and a lifetime of secrets boil to the surface over a few short days.  In Preston A. Whitmore II’s film “This Christmas,” the Whitfields — a mother, her three sons, three daughters and two grandchildren — gather, along with various significant others, for a Christmas crammed with more melodrama than all the holiday-homecoming flicks from the past decade combined.  For starters, there are pregnancies, covert interracial marriages, gambling debts, new romances, divorces, repressed musical talents, bar brawls and catfights.  Boisterous and bittersweet, the film is  not  dull, but it does feel hopelessly overstuffed, with scant time to devote to any one story line.  There are also lapses in logic. For instance, one daughter states that people are afraid to hum in the presence of Mom, who blames music for stealing away her husband, just minutes after the family has engaged in a borderline-embarrassing dance-along to Kool & the Gang’s “Get Down On It.” (Again, only in the movies.)  Before the closing credits, the gifted cast members again show off their moves in a dance sequence that might have better served as a DVD extra. But at least they’re having fun — more than audiences probably  will as they’re pounded over the head with this mostly formulaic holiday cheer.  “This Christmas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has slight violence and naughty sexual talk.

"This Christmas" is a rare holiday treat, a package that's both thoughtfully selected and sure to please its intended recipients. With its universal themes, highly marketable soundtrack and recognizable cast, upbeat comedy centering on a black family's first reunion in four years has unique crossover potential for a variety of demographics, though Sony will have to work hard to make that happen theatrically. Pic should do respectable biz this season but recoup very nicely as a holiday staple to be watched time and again.
With eager anticipation, family matriarch Ma'Dere Whitfield (Loretta Devine) awaits her brood's holiday homecoming. Joining her companion Joe (Delroy Lindo) and teenage son Baby (Chris Brown) are homemaker daughter Lisa (Regina King); tough but lonely businesswoman Kelli (Sharon Leal); conflicted college student Mel (Lauren London); returning Marine Claude (Columbus Short); and, surprisingly, traveling musician Quentin (Idris Elba). Current and prospective mates include Mel's beau Devean (Keith Robinson), Lisa's materialistic spouse, Malcolm (Laz Alonso); and a charming fireman (Mekhi Phifer) with eyes for Kelli.
That each of the family members conceals a secret to be revealed in time might seem formulaic, but Preston Whitmore II, helming his own script, has such an assured sense of rhythm and tone that the film moves smartly along. Various truths are exposed concerning Claude's lovelife and military status, Quentin's debts, Lisa's female intuition, Malcolm's extramarital activities and Baby's musical ambition, but these disclosures happen more or less organically. Latter revelation is pic's sweetest surprise, as Brown ("Stomp the Yard"), a phenomenally talented performer, delivers a dazzling rendition of "Try a Little Tenderness."
That sequence is one of several musical interludes that fill "This Christmas" with an infectiously buoyant spirit. Brown also does a fine job with his climactic take on the title tune, and DeNetria Champ, as a gospel singer, offers a slow-building, deeply moving performance of "O Holy Night."
Soundtrack features a number of well-mounted holiday standards, including two family dance segments, the second of which feels like an indulgent, overlong coda that would have been better placed over the end credits. Still, it's unusual these days to find a holiday film that doesn't feel as recycled as a fruitcake.
Technical elements, including Alexander Gruszynski's lensing and Dawn Snyder's festive production design, are fine. Despite some recognizable L.A. locations and landmarks, including the El Rey Theater, the story's setting is never mentioned, and pic is otherwise awfully heavy on the interiors.
Cast, led by veterans Lindo and Devine, is solid. If "This Christmas" is any indication, Whitmore, helming only his third feature (after the little-seen "Crossover" and "Walking Dead"), may well be a director to watch.

Tyler Perry  is going to wind up with a monopoly on mainstream African-American dramas if quality alternatives aren't producedand soon. This mushy, bloated holiday-album snapshot of an L.A. family with excess baggage, by writer-director Preston A. Whitmore II , is not that alternative. Soapy to the extreme, This Christmas  takes place over a preposterously chaotic three-day weekend under the roof of divorced matriarch Ma Dear (Loretta Devine ), as mulish jazz-musician son Quentin (Idris Elba ) resurfaces for the first time in years with angry bookies in pursuit, and AWOL-soldier son Claude (Columbus Short ) lands himself in jail for pulling a gun to defend the honor of the pregnant white wife his family doesn't know about. The cast has spirit, but the dialogue and situations are phonier than the Yule log on TV.
