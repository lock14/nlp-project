In the brooding science-fiction trifle Moon , Sam Rockwell plays a solitary corporate astronaut who is finishing three lonely years on the dark side of the lunar surface. His name is Sam Bell, and his job is to oversee the mining of helium-3, which has become Earth's primary source of energy. In a dankly gritty geodesic space station, which might just as well be a prison, Sam has no one to talk to but a computer named Gerty  an amusing satirical homage to HAL in 2001 , with a voice, all playful self-pity, provided by Kevin Spacey. (Sam also passes time making video calls to his wife and daughter.) But then, on an expedition outside the station, Sam finds what looks like another, wounded astronaut. Actually, it's a younger version of himself  a clone. Now there are two Sams. And whoa, do they have a lot to talk about.
The double role suits Rockwell perfectly  in fact, it suits him a little too well. As an actor, he has always played flakes, screwups, and boyishly dazed myopic nutjobs. Sometimes he's been crazy-goofy (Choke , Box of Moonlight ), sometimes crazy-lethal (Snow Angels , Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ), but what defines nearly every Rockwell performance is its charming/annoying solipsistic quality. Shaggy and horsey-handsome, he's like a man-child hypnotized by his own brain waves, and while this makes him a magnetic highflier, it also means that he never entirely connects with anyone on screen. In Moon , Rockwell battles his double with a kind of fulminating acting-class intensity. Is the clone real? Is Sam going mad with isolation? Or is he the victim of a cosmic hallucinatory mind-control scheme  the paranoid pawn in a Philip K. Dick-ian game of Do Astronauts Dream of Electric Clones?  You can meditate away, but at bottom the movie is 97 minutes of Sam Rockwell jabbering to himself.
Moon  is the first feature to be directed by Duncan Jones, who is David Bowie's son, and he brings it a grimy industrial look  the future strip-mined of all romance or idealism  as well as witty touches like giving Gerty a smiley-face screen that changes expression in tandem with Spacey's voice. Jones truly puts you on the moon; he does a technically imaginative job befitting the son of the man who fell to earth. Next time, though, he'd do well to make a movie that breathes as much as it mind-trips.

 Most science-fiction movies these days are lavish, large-scale spectacles, delivering the thrills of interplanetary travel or dystopian speculation at the risk of grandiosity and cartoonishness. In a film like J. J. Abrams’s “Star Trek,” or on television’s “Battlestar Galactica,” outer space can seem awfully crowded. “Moon,” Duncan Jones’s modest, haunting first feature, offers something of an antidote, presenting a vision of life beyond Earth that emphasizes claustrophobia and loneliness.  Filmed on soundstages at Shepperton Studios in England, “Moon” is an exercise in minimalism, paring down a complex futuristic scenario into what is essentially a one-person drama. Or perhaps a drama whose central problem is what a single human identity might entail in a world where both cloning and highly exploitative impersonal labor practices have become commonplace.  Some features of this world are sketched at the beginning, as a mock commercial explains that Earth’s energy problems have been solved by the conversion to a fuel abundantly present in lunar soil. Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), an employee of the company that extracts this resource, is reaching the end of his three-year stint as the only human inhabitant of a remote mining station. Or so it appears.  To say too much might ruin some of the surprises in this film’s spare, carefully inflected plot, which in its structure, its themes and its parsimonious exposition may remind you of a Ray Bradbury short story. Sam is not entirely alone. His companion is a computer named Gerty, whose creepy kinship with HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey” feels even more sinister because Gerty speaks in the sardonic deadpan of Kevin Spacey. And back on Earth a wife (Dominique McElligott) and baby daughter check in now and then via video recordings because direct communication is temporarily out of service.  Or not. As his health declines and the day of his departure approaches, Sam discovers that his life on the Moon is, essentially, a fiction. He is aided in this discovery by a double, another Sam Bell, whose slight differences of temperament and attitude allow Mr. Rockwell to pull of an astonishing feat of technique, playing his own rival, foil and buddy.  And Mr. Jones, who is no doubt tired of reading that his father is David Bowie,  demonstrates impressive technical command, infusing a sparse narrative and a small, enclosed space with a surprising density of moods and ideas. The gleaming white interior of the facility where Sam lives and works is at once antiseptic and a little funky, battered and smudged by the disorder that is an inevitable byproduct of human habitation.  Like much science fiction “Moon” is a meditation on the conflict between the streamlining tendencies of technological progress and the stubborn persistence of feelings and desires that can’t be tamed by utilitarian imperatives. The film’s ideas are interesting, but don’t feel entirely worked out, and Mr. Rockwell’s intriguingly strange performance (or performances) is left suspended, without the context that would give Sam’s plight its full emotional and philosophical impact. The smallness of this movie is decidedly a virtue, but also, in the end, something of a limitation.  “Moon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violent scenes and obscene language.

In the sci-fi drama �Moon,� the apparently sole human inhabitant of a lunar mining base begins experiencing odd phenomena just as he�s about to finish his very lonely stint and return home. U.K.-produced debut feature for advertising whiz Duncan Jones and scenarist Nathan Parker recalls such brainy sci-fiers as �2001: A Space Odyssey� and �Solaris.� But despite its handsome look and good thesping workout for Sam Rockwell, the story stretches a bit thin over feature length. Fantasy fans who don�t require monsters or laser battles will want a look, though overall modest impact suggests wider smallscreen exposure after brief theatrical play.
Opening corporate promo reveals that in the near future, our energy-strapped world discovers a new resource in harvesting lunar rock for Helium-3, an actual but rare Earth substance used in nuclear fusion. After nearly three years manning his station alone -- with only �robotic assistant� Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) for company -- an edgy, exhausted Sam Bell (Rockwell) is more than ready to rejoin his wife and young daughter. But hallucinations begin to occur, one causing him to crash a Land Rover.
He wakes up considerably enfeebled, then questions his sanity anew upon finding a doppelganger -- fitter, and with a hotter temper -- now in residence, also insisting he�s Sam Bell. Is one a clone? Are they both? Is Sam�s three-year work contract even meant to have survived?
These questions are intriguing enough but aren�t played out in especially suspenseful or surprising fashion by director or scribe (working from Jones� original story idea). Instead, �Moon� actually gets a little dull in the later reels, just when it should be peaking in mystery and tension.
There�s not quite enough complexity of incident or character development here, though Rockwell -- who�s become something of a specialist in characters losing their grip (�Snow Angels,� �Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,� �Joshua�) is very good portraying the amiable astronaut�s mental and physical deterioration. (He�s less convincing putting across Sam No. 2�s initial �Top Gun�-style macho bluster.) 
The space station�s mostly white interiors particularly recall �2001,� though Gerty doesn�t quite turn out to be another HAL. Lunar exterior scenes are also nicely handled by the design team�s mix of f/x techniques. Clint Mansell�s atmospheric score is a plus. 


Moon , directed by British advert tyro Duncan Jones , is a modest science fiction film with major aspirations—and even its own genealogical issues. Jones's debut, which had its local premiere at the last Tribeca Film Festival , is pleased to engage genre behemoths—2001,  Solaris , Blade Runner —as well as B-movie classics like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
The tale of a lonely spaceman might have made an excellent Twilight Zone  episode, but Moon 's premise is particularly suggestive of a song by Jones's father, David Bowie , whose 1969 hit "Space Oddity," took a depressed astronaut as its protagonist. Occupying an even more obscure corner of the cosmos, Sam Bell  (a hirsute Sam Rockwell ) is introduced running laps on his lunar station treadmill. Like its lone inhabitant, this mining base seems a bit seedy—in fact, it's little more than a slag heap. Bell, alone save for his chaperone Gerty, an ungainly robotic valet with the soothing voice of Kevin Spacey  and a smiley face on its TV monitor, has been there for nearly three years and, having almost fulfilled his contract, desperately wants out.
Night is eternal and the sense of isolation palpable. Not only is the base a dump but Gerty is a greatly diminished version of HAL, despite a repertoire of a half-dozen expressions including tearful empathy. Even the tantalizing video messages Bell receives from his wife and daughter back in suburban Connecticut seem designed to exacerbate his alienation. The movie is a virtual solo for Rockwell, whose shambolic everyman is already prone to hallucination and perilously close to a nervous breakdown when he totals his lunar Land Rover  while out on a repair mission.
Bell wakes up in the infirmary and, motivated by an obscure urge to investigate, tricks solicitous Gerty into allowing him back outside. Revisiting the scene of the accident, he finds another guy in the crashed vehicle: him. At this point, Rockwell's one-man show turns into a doppelgänger act. Bell's attempts to engage his other, battered self are greeted with sullen animosity. The clone refuses to shake hands—accusing Bell of being a hallucination or worse—although the doubles do eventually play a hostile game of ping-pong and engage in other forms of competitive weirdness, notably a dance set to the manic '80s pop song "Walking on Sunshine." The vaudeville is complicated by intimations of conspiracy, as well as madness.
Referring to the mining company that employs them, one Bell complains that "they haven't even fixed the fucking communication satellite!" That's more or less the problem. Like its protagonist, Moon  feels stuck. The situation is naturally oppressive—this is, after all, the story of a man in prison—and the stir-craziness proves contagious. Impressively pulled together on a modest budget, Moon  has a strong lead and a valid philosophical premise but, despite Bell's fissured psyche, the drama is inert. Ground control to Major Tom: Moon  orbits an idea, but it doesn't go anywhere.
