It's an unenviable position. Hannah Montana is the most famous underage pop star in America. But the girl pretending to be her  - Miley Cyrus as Miley Stewart  - is living a lie. The lie has made Miley, the actor and the character, rich and popular. It has made her washed-up country-singer dad look shrewd. It's also made her exhausted. She could use her Disney Channel sitcom to end her double life. But the Disney employees charged with the direction of her future wisely thought she should solve this identity crisis where many a teenage starlet before her has: the movies.
"Hannah Montana: The Movie" has performance numbers  - the first one fancifully blurs the line between a live Hannah concert and a music video  - flat melodrama, and such guest stars as Rascal Flatts and Taylor Swift, as themselves. Peter Chelsom is credited as the director, but the movie's slapstick, musical numbers, and montages appear to have directed themselves  - there is an elegant, if oppressively metaphorical sequence staged in a revolving door.
The whole thing explores whether Miley, who's running from a tabloid exposé, exasperating her publicist (Vanessa Williams), and wrestling Tyra Banks for shoes, can afford to bare her true self to the world. Does she at last remove Hannah's blond wig or not? And how much longer can she keep up this charade until some stranger Tweets the truth?
While she figures that out, her father, Robby (Billy Ray Cyrus), has dragged her from Beverly Hills to her ancestral Tennessee home. There, Miley flips the country script ("If you don't mind, I'm gonna add some hip-hop to this hoedown"), asks rhetorical R&B questions ("Where my girls at?"), and sparks an epic line dance.
Looking on are a smitten farm boy (Lucas Till) who rides a horse with pornographic suggestiveness, and no-nonsense Aunt Ruby (Margo Martindale), who's fighting to save her town from a shopping mall and reminding Miley to be true to her roots.
But wait. What roots are those? Follicular, familial, or financial? The goals of "Hannah Montana: The Movie" are threefold. Put large images to new Hannah songs, assure us that the empire is just fine, and dominate the box office. (To that end, moviegoers have been promised that Cyrus "will surprise unsuspecting audiences" on opening weekend.) So Miley may vacillate, but for now her indentured servitude to Disney continues. The image that comes to mind is Princess Leia chained to Jabba the Hutt, but that's probably just me.
After she sings a pretty liberation anthem ("The Climb"), someone yells, "Put the wig back on! You'll never have a normal life if you don't." The depressed look on Cyrus's face breaks your heart. Truculence is OK. But true rebellion will have to wait for a significant slump in sales.

How ordinary a girl is Miley Cyrus? So ordinary that she has to sneak into her own concert. In the opening sequence of Hannah Montana: The Movie , Miley tricks her way into an arena, slips backstage, and puts on her blonde wig, makeup, and a spangly minidress to transform herself into that alterna-bubblegum rock chick and Pia Zadora look-alike, Hannah Montana. As her band pumps out those freeze-dried Avril Lavigne power chords, she exhorts the crowd with a lyric that could be her mantra: ''Everyone can rock out like a superstar!'' It's the halfway-sly conceit of Hannah Montana: The Movie  that Miley, who talks about Hannah as if she were another person, has become addicted to her alter ego (with the accent on ego). She needs identity detox, which can only happen if she gets back to her simple country-girl roots by spending a few weeks in her small hometown of Crowley Meadow, Tenn.
Cyrus, as always, is a professional charmer (it's hard to resist when she leads a hip-hop hoedown), and the crusty folkiness of Billy Ray Cyrus as her real-life dad is as welcome as ever. But there's an awfully long stretch of country-living innocuousness before destiny beckons, and Miley has to become Hannah again so that she can lead a benefit concert to save the town from an evil developer. The surface lesson of the movie is that celebrity looks easy but is hard. The real lesson, as always, is that since even Miley has to work overtime to ''be'' Hannah, every girl in the audience  if she tries hard enough  can become the star she longs to be.

 omg ashley, i’ve just seen “hannah montana the movie”!! and it’s just as awesome as the tv show only bigger and prettier and she doesn’t fall down so much.  basically hannah the pop star is getting way too cocky for a secret identity so her dad (i wish billy ray cyrus would shave his chin) takes her home to tennessee to remind her her real name is miley stewart (well it’s really miley cyrus but you know what i mean). and she falls in love with this cooool cowboy (i wish we had cowboys in new york!) who wears super tight jeans and has zac efron hair but zac doesn’t play him :( and he likes miley way better than hannah even though hannah’s outfits are really cute (but not trashy like britney or lindsay).  then she paints a henhouse and totally saves her home town from getting a shopping mall (not sure why) by giving a SUPER AWESOME concert with all these new songs about how great it is to climb mountains and then a million people dance. oh, and her dad finds a girlfriend (i know, super gross).  i love hannah sooo much.

Even if you live in a cave or loathe little girls, you've probably heard of Hannah Montana. The pop-star alter ego of regular gal Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) and the title character of the wildly popular Disney Channel series sashays back to the bigscreen without missing a beat in "Hannah Montana: The Movie." Widely accessible even to neophytes, the G-rated pic is innocuous fare that should score big with tween girls, as well as those parents seeking age-appropriate role models for their daughters. 
The pic's theatrical release -- sandwiched between Cyrus' sold-out 2008 tour and 3-D concert film, and the upcoming publication of her memoirs (at age 16) -- seems poised to maximize existing Miley-mania. (Her stardom has long since eclipsed that of her dad, country star Billy Ray Cyrus). Propelled by the younger Cyrus' charisma and undeniable talent, the Peter Chelsom-helmed film looks to be another smart move in a career thoughtfully shepherded by her father.
A kind of meta-commentary, at least in part, on the "Hannah" phenomenon, the pic kicks off with Miley trying to get into a concert -- her own --with best pal Lilly (Emily Osment), while Miley's dad Robby Ray (Billy Ray Cyrus, of course) fumes backstage over her late arrival. Hijacking a golf cart, the girls zoom past clueless security guards (unaware, like everyone else, that Miley and Hannah are the same girl), greet Dad and transform mild-mannered Miley into Hannah (with the help of blonde wig, false lashes, sequins and heels) in time for her show.
Busy moonlighting in Hannah Montana musicvideos and jetting off to awards shows, Miley barely has time for friends or family anymore; the Hannah character and celebrity obligations have overtaken her life. After Miley/Hannah nearly ruins Lilly's sweet-16 bash and is a no-show at her brother Jackson's (Jason Earles) college sendoff, Robby Ray hauls her off to Tennessee for a dose of reality, promising to turn the pampered Malibu starlet back into a country girl.
Despite Miley's strenuous objections, Dad insists she'll have to spend two weeks in rural Crowley's Corners, helping on the farm owned by her no-nonsense grandma (Margo Martindale). After much initial grousing, Miley begins to warm to the task. It doesn't hurt that there's a cute (but entirely nonthreatening) ranch hand named Travis (Lucas Till) around, or that widower Robby Ray has caught the eye of the lovely Lorelai (Melora Hardin).
But of course, villains of the G-rated variety lurk nearby: an aggressive tabloid journalist (Peter Gunn), grasping for dirt on Hannah; and a greedy developer (Barry Bostwick) who plans to turn Crowley's Corners into a shopping destination. ("Will there be a Bloomingdale's?" Miley asks hopefully, before realizing a mall would extinguish Crowley's small-town charm.)
Mayhem and pratfalls ensue at the expense of these two baddies, including the old hot/mild sauce switcheroo and a couple of nips by a hungry alligator; all the hijinks are played for laughs and, while bordering on tedious, will appeal especially to younger audiences. Several pleasing musical numbers act to both advance the story and help bridge gaps, including a rousing, toe-tapping, line-dancing hoedown led by Miley in an effort to raise funds to stave off the developer. But apparently, only a concert by Hannah Montana herself -- engineered by Miley, her publicist (Vanessa Williams) and Lilly -- can command the kind of audience that might save the town.
An 11th-hour identity crisis has Miley/Hannah trying to figure out who she really wants to be, and settling on a compromise that should ultimately satisfy her fans. The same is certainly true of the pic, a goofily endearing romp that might even lasso a few new fans.
Tech values are fine; lensing by David Hennings complements colorful production design credited to Caroline Hanania.
