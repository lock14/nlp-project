“Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” is like a feature-length version of the television sitcom “My Name Is Earl,” only Canadian — and not funny. Set in the fictional Sunnyvale trailer park and based on an award-winning cable television show, the movie follows the exploits of three aging bottom feeders and their small circle of enablers. There’s Ricky (Robb Wells), a fast-talking fabulist with Elvis hair and a sticky-fingered daughter, Trinity (Lydia Lawson-Baird); Julian (John Paul Tremblay), a stoic drunk fixated on stealing large amounts of loose change; and the myopic Bubbles (Mike Smith), a helpless man-child whose kitten-infested shack is facing much-needed demolition. Populated by characters whose lives revolve around doping, boozing and cutting into one another’s lap dances, “Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” flirts with the mockumentary format without buying it a ring. The script (by Mr. Wells and Mike Clattenburg, who also directed) is more creative with profanity than plot, though Ricky’s post-incarceration attempts to reclaim his lady love (Lucy DeCoutere) are handled with unexpected sweetness. Let’s face it, though: what woman wouldn’t choose new breasts, a lesbian lover and a job at a “gentleman’s club” over a suitor who lives in a car? “Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has public urination, private lap dancing and universal bad taste.

Idiocy in myriad forms being something of a homegrown specialty, Hollywood needn't normally import stupidity. But Canuck-born Ivan Reitman so loved a runaway hit Canadian cable series about a trio of lovable if not-too-bright criminals, he produced a movie version, "Trailer Park Boys: The Movie," which promptly shot to No. 1 up north. Directed and co-written by series' creator Mike Clattenburg, "Boys" functions swimmingly as both a bigscreen inflation of smallscreen icons and a fairly hilarious stand-alone. Opening Jan.25 in Gotham and Los Angeles, the laffer will need strong critical and word-of-mouth promotion to hawk its surprisingly strong audience appeal. 
The series, in its seventh Canadian season, aired only briefly Stateside as part of BBC America, where its cuss-laden soundtrack produced a constant series of bleeps.
Instead of the cynicism and defiant aggressiveness of much American lowball humor, "Boys" trades on its characters' unshakable underdog image with a sweetness all the more genuine for being crassly expressed.
Of the three two-bit grifter heroes, Ricky (co-scripter Robb Wells) is the wordsmith: his brilliance at talking his way out of jams is unfortunately not matched by his planning ability nor by his partners' skills at thinking on their feet.
Cohort Julian (John Paul Tremblay), tall, dark and taciturn, with an iced rum and coke permanently clutched in his hand, tilts toward the conservative, lacking Ricky's brainstorming impulsiveness. Arch-geek Bubbles (Mike Smith), his eyes huge and goofy behind coke-bottle glasses, robs for friendship and cat food, sharing his ramshackle tool shed with an adorable horde of kitties he trains for his annual feline extravaganza.
Pic's plot focuses mainly on Ricky's attempts to get back together with Lucy (Lucy Decoutere), his longtime girlfriend -- and mother of his larcenous little girl Trinity (Lydia Lawson-Baird), who has kicked him out of the family trailer for having given up his stable pot-growing job.
Having failed at parking meter theft, and determined to pull off the "Big Dirty" that will allow them to retire in proletarian ease, Ricky and the boys decide to rob a cinema of a huge display of change, since metal money is untraceable.
"Boys" also features residents of the series' Sunnyvale Trailer Park, notably its villainous drunken ex-cop manager (John Dunsworth) and his younger, dimmer significant other (Patrick Roach) whose huge, bare pot belly constantly rounds out corners of the frame. But the pic's main source of comedy is Ricky's inexhaustible verbal virtuosity and the spectacularly inventive ways the gang's penny-ante heists self-destruct.
Tech credits are well calibrated to the film's lowly roots, helmer Clattenburg and lenser Miroslaw Baszak retaining much of the series' low-budget feel through the transition from hand-held video to tripod-steady film. Characters speak directly to the camera in conversational asides that suit the pic's casualness.

The Trailer Park Boys are more than just a hit in Canadatheir eponymous TV series about life in a Nova Scotia  trailer park is a phenomenon of South Park ian proportions. The FAQ on the their website gives an idea of the Boys' target audience: "Are the actors smoking real marijuana on the show?" "What's the best way to courier someone weed?" When TPB: TM  starts, the boys are heading home after a stint in jail. Julian (John Paul Tremblay ), the brains of the operation, makes an easy transition. Ricky (Robb Wells ), with his big heart and even bigger gut, has a harder time: His longtime girlfriend Lucy (LOL, Ricky and Lucyget it?) has acquired new breasts, courtesy of a new boyfriend. The film follows Ricky's attempt to win her back, and the gang's attempt to pull off the Big Dirty, a legendary and somewhat retarded heist.I'm sure the pot-laced antics of these trashy dudes are, like, totally hilarious on Canadian TV, but they don't translate well to America or the big screen.
