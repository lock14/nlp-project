It's not too hard to see why Robert Pattinson was chosen  months   before he put the gleam in 20 million Twilight  fans' eyes  to play the young Salvador Dalí in Little Ashes . With his hair slicked back in elegant '20s style, and those giant, saucerish orbs popping out of their sockets in mock amazement, Pattinson looks startlingly like Dali even before he starts to grow the artist's trademark upside-down mustache. The actor makes a great entrance, emerging from a car in ruffles, a Louise Brooks haircut, and a high theatrical pout, all to greet  or, more accurately, to ignore  his fellow students at a   university in Madrid. But don't get your hopes up: This androgynous exhibitionist turns out to be the most wilting of wallflowers on the inside.
Little Ashes  tells the tale, largely speculative, of Dali's student romance with the budding leftist poet Federico Garcia Lorca (Javier Beltran), and the movie has the dubious distinction of using their moony homoerotic love affair didactically, as a way to trash Dali the artist. The relationship, which climaxes with a midnight swim that looks like an outtake from an   Esther Williams water ballet, is supposed to express the "real" Dali. Whereas the raging, antibourgeois, satirically mad surrealist he becomes is treated as a fraud  a cover-up   for his tender self. Even if you buy that (and I didn't  I love Dali's visionary vulgarity too much), Pattinson and Beltran are stuck with a rudderless script, and they make a soft, dull pair. I wish the film had more of Matthew McNulty's firebrand performance   as Luis Buñuel, whose collaboration with Dali on the revolutionary short film Un Chien Andalou  comes off here as an arty caprice that interrupted the cause of true love. I can't imagine what Dali or Buñuel would have made of such bourgeois sentimentality. C–

 The tangled three-way friendship of Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí and Federico García Lorca — important artistic figures of the 20th century whose paths crossed in Madrid early in their careers — could make for a fascinating movie. Instead, we have “Little Ashes,” directed by Paul Morrison and written by Philippa Goslett, a painfully sincere study in creative passion, sexual ardor and political zeal that embalms a mad and exuberant historical moment within the talky, balky conventions of period-costumed highbrow soap opera.  The film starts off like a Spanish variation on “Brideshead Revisited,” with various handsome young men in beautifully tailored shirts bursting into university dormitory rooms, lighting cigarettes and declaiming knowingly on art, religion, modern society and the talents and deficiencies of their peers. A couple of brightly  plumed, semi-emancipated women occasionally take part in the conversations, which the international cast utters in Castilian-accented — or should I say acthented — English.  It is all very heady and earnest and excruciatingly dull. This is shocking, since it is hard to imagine anyone less dull than Dalí, Buñuel and García Lorca. Mr. Morrison works hard to convey the impulses that fed their art, but he seems unable to treat these wildly innovative figures in any but the most literal-minded way. So García Lorca (Javier Beltrán) recites verse in voice-over; Buñuel (Matthew McNulty) delivers potted avant-garde aphorisms; and Dalí (Robert Pattinson), well, he trembles and drinks and says scandalous things in the drawing studio and at dinner parties.  Mr. Pattinson, interrupting his career as a virginal vampire heartthrob, looks distractingly like Louise Brooks and conveys little beyond a kind of free-floating, inscrutable freakishness.  Dalí arrives on the scene dressed in preposterous ruffled shirts, and soon becomes a minor campus sensation, promoted by the bossy, blustering Buñuel even as he becomes infatuated with García Lorca, Buñuel’s quiet and sensitive roommate. Buñuel, jealous of both of them, tries to cajole Dalí into running off to Paris, knowing that García Lorca, whose writing is rooted in his Andalusian homeland, is unlikely to follow.  As the triangle solidifies, “Little Ashes” briefly transcends its musty trappings and achieves a measure of dramatic clarity and psychological insight. (There are also some lovely travelogue images of  Spanish landscapes.) Buñuel, a brawler and a homophobe, is at least partly at war with his own unacknowledged desires. García Lorca’s acceptance of his own homosexuality entails grave risks in a conservative society creeping toward fascist dictatorship.  As for Dalí, his flamboyant perversity masks a great deal of erotic anxiety, and his longing for García Lorca is accompanied by a terror of actual physical intimacy. Their relationship is consummated only indirectly, through the mediation of Margarita (Marina Gatell), a journalist whose love for Federico makes her the fourth wheel of a curious tricycle.  If the acting were less wooden and the dialogue less insistently devoted to issuing manifestoes, “Little Ashes” might have vibrated with the danger and strangeness of the intensely lived commitments it tries to explore. But while Mr. Morrison and Ms. Goslett are clearly enthralled by the daring of their subjects — in particular by García Lorca’s bravery — they seem impervious to the lessons offered by the artists’ work, which was in every case opposed to the kind of tidy, deflating realism practiced in this film. It suffers the fate of so many biographies, in which genuine admiration expresses itself through the dutiful recording of dates and facts.  The facts are of enough interest to make “Little Ashes” attractive to those eager to hear some old, vigorous arguments about aesthetics and politics conducted by elegantly dressed men wielding cigarettes and cocktails. But neither the ideological melodrama of Spain before the Civil War nor the exploding-teapot storms of the international artistic avant-garde really come alive here. The film is an open-hearted tribute to three great iconoclasts, whose response to its piety and sincerity would, most likely, have been ruthless and obscene mockery.  “Little Ashes” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual content, language and a brief disturbing image.

Drawing from mostly speculative accounts of Salvador Dali's student days, "Little Ashes" fashions a soggy account of what might have been between the self-styled surrealist and Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, implying ways their unrequited homosexual affair informed their respective careers. The first of multiple Dali-themed pics to actually make it to the screen, this English-language production is blessed with the good fortune of star Robert Pattinson's blossoming into an overnight sensation, potentially luring a few curious "Twilight" fans to its otherwise limited gay and culturally inclined target aud.
Expanding on racy suggestions made in Ian Gibson's biographies of both Lorca and Dali, first-time screenwriter Philippa Goslett mines the rich (and less thoroughly documented) period in Dali's life when he was enrolled at Madrid's Residencia de Estudiantes, a progressive arts school where the young painter rubbed elbows with the likes of Luis Bunuel (Matthew McNulty) and Lorca (Javier Beltran). The latter clearly covets a more serious sort of frottage, falling for the pompously dressed Dali from the moment he arrives, and early scenes find the two budding talents coyly eyeing one another, endearingly awkward in their advances.
For those more familiar with the shameless stuntsmanship of Dali's late career, director Paul Morrison presents a very different impression here: Dali is cocky about his talent but uncertain in his own skin, an idea depicted perhaps too literally in a montage (already being featured online as the "Twilight" star's "nude scene") in which he poses with legs crossed and naughty bits tucked away, examining his androgynous reflection before a mirror. His flirtation with Lorca is mutual, but Dali is the one who seems reluctant to cross the line.
Their courtship proceeds all the more slowly in the presence of Bunuel, who serves as both Lorca's roommate and the pic's mouthpiece for the homophobia of the period, frequently erupting in angry tirades against openly gay couples who cross his path. But Morrison fails to capture any sexual tension, depriving "Little Ashes" of the spark that might have put it on par with Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Dreamers" or stories of its ilk.
When Dali and Lorca finally kiss during a latenight swim, Morrison breaks out the slow motion and artfully moonlit male flesh but misses the emotional fireworks. Still standing in their way is Lorca's female companion (Marina Gatell), who devises a plan to seduce the poet, leading to the film's most provocative scene, in which all three characters are present for Lorca's sexual initiation.
The historically heretical moment marks a turning point for Dali, who rushes off to Paris to reinvent himself, cementing Lorca as the story's true protagonist. It is here, in the wake of Dali's rejection, that Lorca finds the courage to embrace his homosexuality, while the painter becomes a victim of his own narcissism (reflected in his evolving hairstyles and increasingly outre moustache).
But the film is far from over, transitioning into a slow procession of scenes documenting the pair's separate artistic achievements (shown through a mix of archival footage and hokey newsreel-style re-creations), with Pattinson transitioning into a more flamboyant characterization. A decade-later reunion scene feels decidedly anticlimactic, and the film relies instead on tragedy for its big emotional payoff.
For much of its running time, "Little Ashes" wavers between the polite, stuffy style of a "Masterpiece Theater" production and the more pointed agenda of gay indie cinema, with real Spanish locations classing up the otherwise low-budget affair. Acting is stagy and hindered by thick Spanish accents: Beltran, who plays Lorca, is wonderfully expressive but occasionally unintelligible.

Hoping to expand his fan base beyond Twilight -loving tween girls to Chelsea twinks, alabaster beauty Robert Pattinson plays bi-curious Salvador Dalí in this silly portrayal of the 1920s Madrid university days of the painter and his pals, gay poet/playwright Federico García Lorca and gay-bashing Luis Buñuel. Written by first-time scripter Philippa Goslett, Little Ashes  (named after one of Dalí's paintings) is a typically bombastic lives-of-the-artists production made even more stilted by having all the actors (including the Spanish ones) speak accented English; the first several minutes contain so much Castilian overlisping that someone surely must have sprained a tongue. Pattinson—first presented as a twitchy weirdo in ruffled pirate shirts and hairdos reminiscent of Antony Hegarty's before a fantastic sartorial makeover featuring costume designer Antonio Belart's pick of excellent sweater vests—has difficulty conveying cracked genius, at one point seeming to mimic Jame Gumb's prance in front of the mirror in The Silence of the Lambs  until settling on just bugging his eyes out. Though Dalí's first smooch with García Lorca (Javier Beltrán), in the phosphorescent waters of Cadaqués, is steamy, the pleasures of man-man love—and the movie—evaporate quickly when the wildly ambitious painter announces, "I'll bring Paris to its knees!" after he's conflicted about being on his.
