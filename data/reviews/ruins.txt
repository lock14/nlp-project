It's a tough call, really. You, your best friend, and your respective boyfriends go all the way down to Mexico for a little fun in the sun. The hotel pool is fine, and your boyfriends are way cute. It's just like being in America except now you're scared to drink the water. Then this German guy (cute, too) comes over and is, like, "You wanna come see these ruins my brother went to and hasn't been heard from since?"
You guys follow him, even though your Spidey sense is totally tingling. Like, why is the path to the ruins all covered up? And why are those indigenous kids staring at you? But you went because your boyfriend wanted to - he's one of those fit, intrepid American med students. And within five minutes one of you is dead and the rest of you are stuck at the top of a big stone temple covered in flesh-eating vines that also burrow beneath the skin.
Jena Malone is the "you" in that scenario for "The Ruins," a surprisingly effective little horror nightmare that opened yesterday without a screening for critics. I jumped legitimately at least twice, covered my eyes during most of the amateur on-site surgeries, and felt the pit of my stomach tighten up once Jonathan Tucker and Shawn Ashmore - as the boyfriends - lowered Malone and Laura Ramsey into the temple's mouth to find a ringing cellphone.
The movie is short, and has about two sets for the actors to slowly lose their minds over. The photography, by Darius Khondji, has dismaying clarity at night. You can see more than you want to. By day, it's beautiful despite the damned in its view. And as the plant bait, Ashmore, Tucker, Ramsey, and particularly the oft-distraught Malone have made it even harder to tolerate dumb, bad acting in other horror movies. The director, Carter Smith, and the screenwriter, Scott B. Smith (he adapted his novel), leave room for these four to make some interesting, realistic psychological choices. Their distress is yours. But hokey plot mechanics abound. One character's demise owes more to horror-movie math than ingenuity or actual necessity.
"The Ruins" has its insults, too. It appears that our luscious white Americans have wandered into some kind of ongoing ritual that the indigenous killer Mexicans have all gathered down below to watch. The movie makes them extra-ugly and extra-incomprehensible. But they have working guns and arrows. They also have their reasons for waiting for the vines to eat the tourists. But no matter how savage things get at the top of the temple, we know the actual primitives are waiting down below - though in pretty nice jeans.
The Americans are predictably entitled. When Tucker addresses the fear that they'll never be found, he says something to the effect of "Four Americans just don't disappear." Watched with a sizable black and Hispanic audience, as I did the other night, that line brings down the house.
The filmmakers have managed some scary-ironic eco-commentary, too - the ringing cellphone punch line is a Greenpeace fantasy, and the vines themselves are a stoner's worst nightmare. This weed wants to smoke you.


On the last day of their Mexican vacation, two sexy, obnoxiously overprivileged post-collegiate couples pay a visit to a Mayan pyramid. At the foot of the ruins, they're surrounded by locals who threaten them with machetes and guns and bows and arrows  but once they scurry to the top, they realize that they're being forced into quarantine. The real threat is the pyramid's evil twisty killer vines, which sprout what look like oversize, mildewed marijuana leaves and invade the body like IV drips from hell. Adapted from a much scarier novel by Scott Smith (A Simple Plan ), The Ruins  is lumpish, static, and obvious. It's a gringos-go-home cautionary fright flick done in the spirit of a cheap '50s horror movie, except that it leaves you longing for the competence of grade-Z studio-system trash. The film barely comes to life outside of several gory mutilation scenes, including one shockingly gratuitous double-leg amputation performed as a desperate act of survival  an unnecessary effort, really, given how little the audience has invested in whether any of these chuckleheads lives or dies.


Americans, stay home! If the offshore terrorists, organ harvesters, torture-tourism entrepreneurs or angry ghosts don�t get you,  plant life just might. That last, latest spin on current horror conventions arrives via �The Ruins.� Ultimately less dependent on suspense or even scares than on squirm-inducing grossouts, this tale of Yank hardbodies vs. carnivorous creepers should flower briefly in hardtops, then spread like an invasive weed in ancillary.
Scenarist Scott B. Smith�s adaptation of his own novel reverses the results of his first such effort. While 1998�s Sam Raimi-helmed �A Simple Plan� elevated its source material, �Ruins� � though decently directed by feature debutant Carter Smith � only renders the same more genre-generic. Opening reel is indistinguishable from that of �Turistas,� as two post-collegiate American couples vacationing at a seaside Mexican resort mull the predictably fatal offer of a day trip to an inland spot �not in the guidebooks.� 
Invite hails from German Mathias (Joe Anderson), eager to rejoin his brother, who abandoned him for a cute female archaeologist exploring an ancient Mayan ruin. 
Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) are both game, Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) even moreso, although Jeff�s annoying-brat g.f. Amy (Jena Malone) isn�t at all intrigued by this lucky cultural-historical break. Nonetheless, the variably hung-over travelers drag themselves onto a local bus the next morning, joined by youthful Greek Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas). 
After scrambling up a hidden trail to reach the impressive temple ruins, they�re immediately surrounded by armed local Mayans who seem very riled over some offense the tourists have already committed. This immediately results in one death, and in the others� forced scurrying up the vine-covered pyramidic structure to apparent safety.
There, they discover evidence of the archaeologists� recent occupation, but the people themselves are MIA. It�s only when Amy and Stacy attempt to retrieve a cell phone from a shaft below � their discovery of the ring tone�s source yields the tale�s creepiest twist � that protags realize the insane full extent of their predicament. 
At this point, �The Ruins� abandons all hope that ye who enter here will experience any subtlety or real surprise. Instead, it leans on the �ewww� factor as characters have their bodies invaded by virulent vines and practice gruesome amateur surgery on themselves. 
Squabbling among the skin-deep characters doesn�t induce much sympathy, though thesps do their best. The novel offered a certain psychological depth; not so the film, which comes off essentially as routine, conceptually silly horror content.
Tech/design aspects are accomplished, from Darius Khondji�s widescreen lensing to the eerie soundscape inclusive of Graeme Revell�s score.
