         "Marebito: The Stranger From Afar" is the latest picture from cult horror director Takashi Shimizu, best known for "The Grudge." "Marebito," though, is provocative rather than scary, and it's made with visual flair.
 
  Shinya Tsukamoto stars as Masuoka, an ordinary-looking freelance Tokyo news cameraman in early middle age whose voyeuristic tendencies have led him to become obsessed with the need to understand fear. Returning home on the subway from a documentary TV shoot, he comes upon an older man, Furoki (Kazuhiro Nakahara), who suddenly stabs himself in the eye, presumably fatally. Masuoka manages to film the entire incident and, in his cluttered, equipment-filled apartment, studies the footage endlessly, coming to the conclusion that Furoki saw something truly terrorizing the moment he stabbed himself.
 


         






    Masuoka decides to trace the path of Furoki's gaze, which takes him back to the subway and a spiral staircase that leads deep below surface streets and World War II air raid shelters into ancient tunnels, where he is eventually greeted by Furoki, who may or may not be a ghost. Furoki escorts him to a vast underground world where in a subterranean forest, which seems flooded by daylight, he discovers a naked, pretty young woman (Tomomi Miyashita) chained at her ankle to a wall in a shallow cavern. Masuoka rescues her and takes her to his apartment — never mind that she seems to exist exclusively on blood, for which she has a ravenous appetite.
 
  Chiaki Konaka's screenplay is inspired by a story written by Richard Shaver that was published in Amazing Stories magazine in the 1940s. Far from unique in his belief that cities around the world have subterranean communities inhabited by strange beings, Shaver asserted that these caverns were built by aliens from another galaxy who were fleeing the sun's radiation and whose offspring degenerated into evil dwarfs or Deros — "detrimental robots" — who kidnap surface-dwelling humans for sustenance and have "ray" machines that can project tormenting thoughts and voices into human minds.
 
  Shimizu doesn't show any such machinery, but Masuoka does grow increasingly distraught, especially in keeping the young woman supplied with blood. "Marebito" is no conventional vampire movie but a speculation into the notion that ancient people could sense alien beings in their midst.
 
  In this view, the experience of terror can reveal a flash of long-forgotten human knowledge. As Masuoka seems to be driven into escalating madness one thing seems certain: He can't rest until he has experienced profound fear himself.

 "Marebito," the latest movie by the Japanese horror auteur Takashi Shimizu ("Ju-on: The Grudge"), is in some ways a modest film, with a tiny cast, a 92-minute running time, minimal effects and a grainy, homemade look.  At the same time, though, it encompasses a dizzying range of conceits and half-formed ideas. Fans of the J-horror genre will find familiar motifs, none of them explored with much novelty or depth. The uncanny power of the video image is explored (the protagonist is a cameraman), as is the ability of sound effects to create moods of dread and apprehension. There are pale, ghostly women, enough blood to transfuse a small city and an atmosphere of urban loneliness and sullen psychosexual pathology.  None of which is quite as much fun - or quite as disturbing - as it should be. Some of Mr. Shimizu's images are unsettling, in particular those shot in hand-held, consumer-grade video. But there are few moments of genuine shock or impact. Masuoka, the sad-faced hero, fancies himself a connoisseur of terror, so much so that he regards the ordinary fear of death as "mediocre." But in casting about for new sources of fear, "Marebito" achieves its own level of mediocrity.  One day, Masuoka (played by Shinya Tsukamoto, director of the low-budget science-fiction cult masterpiece "Tetsuo"), who lives in a small apartment jammed with video screens, films a suicide in a Tokyo subway.  Studying scenes of the incident, he concludes that there is a secret world beneath the city, inhabited by evil robots. This theory, which has a precedent in the work of the science fiction writer Richard Shaver, turns out to be true. Or almost. At any rate, the tunnels below Tokyo house talkative ghosts and strange, white-skinned humanoid creatures who skitter around on all fours. There is also a young woman (Tomomi Miyashita) chained naked to a wall, whom Masuoka takes home and keeps as a kind of feral pet, feeding her human blood out of a baby bottle, and also from cuts he inflicts on himself with a box cutter.  "I liked it," he says in his voice-over. "I wanted to keep feeding her until she was satisfied. Even if it meant my own death."  Whatever turns you on. As those remarks suggest, "Marebito" is thick with metaphors that are at once obvious and obscure. Mr. Shimizu does not explore the connections between sex, fear, violence and madness so much as he takes them for granted, figuring that vampirism, videotape and dank, dim corridors will somehow combine to create sensation, if not sense. Sense is not required - horror movies can do just fine without it - but some sensation other than boredom and an occasional grimace of disgust might be nice.  This film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and extreme violence.

Japanese horror doesn't get more tedious than "The Stranger From Afar," a DV misfire whose hodgepodge scenario, pretentious dialogue and laughable f/x make for risible viewing. This latest quickie offering by "Grudge" helmer Takashi Shimizu displays a similar inability to follow through on plot devices, here centered on a fear-obsessed cameraman and some silly creatures living underground. 
William Castle's old howler "The Tingler," in which Vincent Price's mad scientist discovers a creature that feeds off human fear, is back here in a new form, with equally nonsensical results. Freelance news photog Masuoka (Shinya Tsukamoto) is fixated on the concept of terror, and after filming a man's grisly suicide, he becomes convinced that people see something truly terrifying at the precise moment of maximum fear.
His exploration leads him to a series of tunnels beneath Tokyo, where he encounters the supposed suicide and is partly guided through this dingy netherworld. All major cities have similar networks of underground spaces, he's told, inhabited by "detrimental robots," or Deros -- white humanoid creatures who scamper on all fours and don't seem to have any point in the plot at all.
Continuing into the depths, Masuoka comes to a stalactite-filled cavern incongruously full of natural light (think original "Star Trek" TV art direction). There he finds a nude woman (Tomomi Miyashita) chained to a rock and takes her home. She can't talk, has difficulty walking, and doesn't eat, but those incisors aren't sharp for nothing.
How exactly this woman connects with the Deros is never explained, nor who (or what) she really is. Meanwhile, that fear concept blows in and out more often than hurricanes in the Caribbean. Chiaki Konaka's inane, heavy-handed script bounces from one disconnected idea to the next with little horror, although Shimizu avidly follows along as if it all had some deep meaning. At least the "Grudge" films provided brief moments of creepiness, something utterly lacking here.
Video quality is passable, although Shimizu uses way too many super-grainy surveillance camera shots. Budget concerns must have hampered set design, but there's little excuse for the laughably obvious painted backdrops in the underground caverns. In an attempt to provoke a desperately needed mood of fear, Shimizu relies too heavily on electronic sound effects that become, as in "The Grudge," monotonous, if not plain annoying.

Helmed by the J-horror hotshot behind the Ju-on  films (and their Yankee Grudge  remakes), and starring Tetsuo  auteur Shinya Tsukamoto , this all-digital indie is, by genre standards, either a misfired doodle or an attempt to Lovecraft-ize the popular movement. Or both. Tsukamoto's shutterbug loner, his flat a mad tangle of video and surveillance equipment, is obsessed with fearnot unlike an entire generation of Asian filmmakers and viewers. He hunts it down in the Tokyo streets, studies photographs of suicides, thinks of it in unconvincingly abstract termsuntil he finds a nondescript door in the subway and enters a secret underworld that eventually opens up into a cavernous fantasy realm. There he finds a naked, gray-skinned girl in chains, and decides to bring her back to reality.
Then our hero must attempt to acclimatize the gamine to modern-day Japan , or at least to his apartment, but she sleeps all the time, drinks blood, and says nothing. Anyone with college-age children can sympathize, but Marebito  is more contemplative (albeit of nonsensical issues) than frightening, and little about it suggests that Shimizu  even had a script written before he began shooting. For a tasty pulp myth about "fear," turn to William Castle 's The Tingler .
