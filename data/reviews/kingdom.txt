At first glance, The Kingdom
 looks like it's another in this season's string of politically charged movies, but the thriller swiftly abandons the complications of geopolitics for the snappy showmanship and fuzzy logic of something resembling CSI: Riyadh
. The Saudi Arabia-set story opens with a brief history of the country and its 20th century interactions with the United States. However, in an instant, a series of devastating bombs goes off within the American oil-workers' compound in Riyadh, and FBI man Ronald Fleury (Foxx) is called away from his son's school to report for duty. Fleury's staff is rabid to fly to Riyadh to investigate the crime and find the murderers, but they are hampered by squirmy politicians and bureaucrats. But the resourceful Fleury devises a way into the country, and like the caravan of sport utility vehicles that whisks him and his team from the airstrip at 150 mph, The Kingdom
 is off and running at a rapid clip. Along with him are FBI experts in explosives (Cooper), intelligence (Bateman), and forensics (Garner), though one has to wonder about the basic efficacy of an FBI that would send a woman to perform autopsies in a country whose religion doesn't allow women to touch the male body. None of the characters is very well-defined, and Cooper, with his weather-beaten face and mien, is the only member of the team who carries any authenticity. Garner and Bateman (who, coincidentally, appear as a married couple in the upcoming film Juno
) are serviceable but interchangeable, while Foxx, despite being good, has an undisguisable comic twinkle that becomes a bit problematic once he starts blowing up lots of people and things. The revelation is Barhom as Saudi Col. Al Ghazi, who becomes the American team's liaison. The screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan draws simplistic parallels between Al-Ghazi and Fleury, who are both dads and family men. Berg stages some tremendous action sequences, though it is hard not to come to the ultimate conclusion that these scenes are the only point of the movie. Largely a crime-scene whodunit, The Kingdom
 culminates in to-the-death shoot-outs in which people wearing kaffiyehs die by the dozens while the little band of Americans eventually flies safely into the sunset. If the jingoism that permeates the latter half of The Kingdom
 does not sufficiently sour the experience of watching it, then the film's closing sentiments about the eternality of vengeance will surely do the trick.


Maybe it�s a cheap shot to call ��The Kingdom�� ���Syriana� for Dummies,�� but it�s fairly close to the truth.
A taut, slickly made thriller about an FBI team solving a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, the film stars Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, is directed by the actor-turned-director Peter Berg (��Friday Night Lights��), and has been produced by Michael Mann.
That�s telling; the movie presents a Mann�s man�s world of international politics. ��The Kingdom�� is a provocative, visceral experience, an undeniable crowd-pleaser that at certain points will have audiences loudly cheering on the heroes. More thoughtful moviegoers may wonder what exactly it is they�re cheering for.
It�s possible that�s part of the game plan, of course � using a hard-boiled action flick as a Trojan horse to pick apart our assumptions and anxieties about the Middle East. If so, the horse x has a tendency to bolt.
A US base in Saudi Arabia � the desert kingdom of the title � has been bombed, a two-pronged attack that has resulted in the deaths of US civilians and rescue personnel. (The incident is based on an actual 1996 bombing.) The country�s ruling sheiks insist the investigation can be handled internally, but a group of FBI field agents led by Ronald Fleury (Foxx) bull their way in-country against every instinct of the State Department (represented most memorably by Jeremy Piven as an Ari-inflected bureaucrat).
Fleury�s team includes forensics expert Janet Mayes (Garner) and bomb specialists Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), all suppressing their connect-the-dot differences for the greater good of the mission. One of the dead was an FBI colleague, and they�re beside themselves with grief and rage.
Indeed, simmering righteousness is the motor that propels both characters and ��Kingdom�� forward, through obstacles tossed up by US diplomats, intransigent Saudis, Muslim terrorists, and endless cultural differences that the movie both respects and dismisses.
Fleury�s group is assigned a Saudi police escort/babysitter in the person of Colonel Faris Al-Ghazi, a cautious, sad-eyed figure played by the fine Israeli actor Ashraf Barhom (��The Syrian Bride��). His job is to keep the Americans from getting underfoot � to stall them, essentially � but, of course, everyone ends up working side by side. While we�re meant to sympathize primarily with the agents, Barhom gives Al-Ghazi�s hard-won decency a charisma that outlasts the movie. You come out wanting to see more of the character and of this actor.
Not that Foxx, Garner, Cooper, or Bateman are slouches � Garner in particular seems happy to be out of chick flicks and back in government service � but their characters are hemmed in by the conventions of Hollywood action-dramas. ��The Kingdom�� has a lot on its mind: it�s a police procedural, a culture clash, a Team America morale booster, a statement on the futility of violence � and an example of Hollywood big-screen violence at its most brutal and alluring.
Shot with the jittery propulsiveness associated more with Mann�s films than Berg�s, ��Kingdom�� builds in momentum until it boils over in a climactic sequence that batters and elates both characters and audience. Terrifically filmed, emotionally suspect, the last half hour pits the heroes against an entire neighborhood of terrorist sympathizers, culminating in a pitched hand-to-hand battle that could wring a war whoop from a Buddhist.
To what end, though? ��The Kingdom�� addresses our fears of a hostile foreign culture � our dread that American certainty and might can�t fix things this time � but it does so in the limited language of the multiplex. The movie ends on a plaintive can�t-we-all-get-along note, but at heart it�s a Charles Bronson flick. It mashes the revenge button the real world won�t let us push.


The opening credits of The Kingdom   as in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia  provide a crash course, literally, in the history of U.S.-Saudi relations. Frantic music pounds as archival images flash in a pulsing collage. Then BOOM , there's an animated black silhouette of an airplane slamming into one of two towers. Then WHAM , the prologue gives way to the fictional present-day sight of Americans and other Western oil-company employees, cavorting with the full swagger of Yankee-centric innocence on the playing fields of a gated Riyadh housing complex  lots of green lawns, lots of baseballs tossed around, lots of heartland-values signifiers.
Then BANG , unknown gunmen in a moving vehicle begin mowing down the crowd with a spray of bullets. And BLAM , a bomb goes off. Chaos follows, and death. Could this be the work of the elusive Saudi terrorist mastermind who  goes by the name of...well, why not call him Mosama bin Faden? So shameless is The Kingdom , ignoring consequence and treating its audience like cash-dispensing machines with buttons to be pushed rather than thinking individuals willing to consider the reality of America's entanglement with the Middle East.
So PRESTO , FBI Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) is interrupted at a kindergarten (where he's scoring major Daddy Points as a visitor in his kid's class) by an SOS call from an FBI buddy on the scene. Foolish, crud-flinging, irresponsible action pictures such as this one love to establish righteous ass-kickers like Fleury as secret softies before the crud is really flung. In a click or two  and against the orders of mealier governmental types  Daddy has gone commando, signing up three fellow elite go-getters to join him in Riyadh with a secret mission to find that unfindable Saudi Darth Vader. One (Chris Cooper) is a good ol' boy who knows about bombs; another  (Jennifer Garner) knows about forensics but apparently has never heard that foulmouthed,  lollipop-sucking, basketball-bouncing young women who wear tight tank tops aren't exactly  dressed for success in severely Muslim Saudi Arabia; and a wisecracking third (Jason Bateman) knows about this thing called the Internet (his colleagues still haven't twigged to websites) but was apparently absent the day FBI classmates learned that people with Jewish-sounding surnames and Israeli stamps in their passports aren't the best candidates for stealth jobs in the Middle East.
Perhaps reflecting the real-world lack of trained linguists on the government payroll, none speak Arabic. (Perhaps the oversight is just more movie lameness.) But all of them fight and shoot guns real good. And that, in the end, is deemed readiness enough for the movie's crude purposes. Anyhow, no one interested in giving the story a second thought will be able to figure out what those purposes really are, aside from opportunistic entertainment. As the bomb pro sloshes through a pool of mud in search of clues about the explosives and the forensics babe picks shrapnel out of a dead body, we appear to be on CSI  terrain. When Jeremy Piven shows up as an oily State Department yes-man, exuding Ari Gold-en insincerity, the movie takes a lazy, distractingly comedic turn toward Entourage . A subplot involving Bateman is so brazen in its theft of images forever associated with the hideous killing of journalist Daniel Pearl that a decent person might look away in disgust. The sight of a masked gunman on a balcony evokes the Munich Olympic massacre of 1972, but for no good reason.
Ashraf Barhom and Ali Suliman, the stars of the infinitely more compelling Paradise Now , are standouts as two Saudi cops of impeccable honor, but their inclusion feels like a math solution on the worksheet of screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan (State of Play ) rather than an essential counterpoint to the FBI side of the story. And all the pieties about how innocent little children can be turned into the next generation of enemies, and how all daddies  American, Saudi, and even  terrorist monster  love their tots, add up to nothing more than vapid chatter.
The Kingdom  is directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights ), an actor-turned-filmmaker with a notably crisp, confident visual style usually well suited to restless action. Here, he sometimes lingers in close-up over the pleasing composition of his movie stars' faces, admiring them like glamorous fashion ads inserted between flailing action sequences. Why? Maybe to give himself a break from the futility of his mission.

 What good is geopolitical turmoil if you can’t have some fun with it? Hollywood has been posing that rhetorical question for a long time now — from “Ninotchka” to “Rambo” by way of a battalion of World War II combat pictures — but it has so far been a bit squeamish about turning the various post-9/11 conflicts into grist for escapist entertainment.  “The Kingdom,” a whodunit/blow-’em-up directed by Peter Berg, corrects this lapse by taking aim at the ethical nuances and ideological contradictions of the war on terror and blasting away.  Mr. Berg, an actor whose directing skills improve with each project (his last for the big screen was the underrated “Friday Night Lights”), shows himself adept at the rapid cutting and hectic camerawork that are fast becoming the lingua franca of action filmmaking.  “The Kingdom” takes the breathless visual precision of the Jason Bourne movies — what the film scholar David Bordwell calls “intensive continuity” — out of the abstract hall-of-mirrors universe of intra-C.I.A. skulduggery and into a semiplausible world of international tension. Rather than explore that tension, as some other, more ostentatiously serious movies coming out shortly seem poised to do, Mr. Berg and Matthew Michael Carnahan, the screenwriter, do what they can to relieve it with fireballs and frantic chases. The result is a slick, brutishly effective genre movie: “Syriana” for dummies.  Which is not entirely a put-down. Intricate, earnest puzzles have their place in the movie cosmos, but so do lean, linear stories with clearly defined villains and heroes and lots of explosions.  The members of the cast, which includes two recent Academy Award winners (Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper), do not trouble themselves exploring the finer points of their craft, but their unpretentious professionalism is nonetheless satisfying to watch. Mr. Foxx does most of his acting with the muscles in his jaw and his upper arm, delivering terse dialogue in a silky whisper. Mr. Cooper punches the folksiness buttons as a forensics expert whose aw-shucks manner masks a steel-trap mind. Jason Bateman is the class clown, and Jennifer Garner, no slouch in the jaw-flexing department, also exercises her tear ducts and her trigger finger.  The four of them play F.B.I. investigators who travel to Saudi Arabia (the kingdom of the title) to investigate a horrific double terrorist attack on American oil company workers and their families. The team’s trip is opposed by the State Department and the lily-livered attorney general (Danny Huston), who don’t want to antagonize an important ally. Backed up by their no-nonsense boss (Richard Jenkins), the Forensic Four nonetheless head to Riyadh.  Their motives are personal as well as professional, since one of their colleagues was killed in the attacks. Their presence is barely tolerated by the Saudi authorities, many of whom are either incompetent or in cahoots with the jihadis. Meanwhile, Jeremy Piven shows up as an embassy flunky whose job is to prevent Special Agent Fleury (Mr. Foxx) and his colleagues from doing theirs.  But Fleury recognizes a fellow good cop in the person of Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), a Saudi colonel who helps the Americans both before and after the bullets and rocket-propelled grenades start flying. Once they do, the good guys are in the familiar, physically perilous but morally gratifying position of being outmanned and outgunned with the cavalry nowhere in sight.  “I’m not saying America is perfect,” Fleury says a while before the climactic barrage, “but we’re pretty good at this.” If by “this” he means making high-impact action movies, it’s hard to argue. And “The Kingdom,” hair-raising as it is, is also curiously soothing in its depiction of American competence and righteousness.  Just as “Rambo” offered the fantasy of do-over on Vietnam, “The Kingdom” can be seen as a wishful revisionist scenario for the American response to Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. In some ways it’s an anti-Iraq movie, not because it expresses opposition to the war there but rather because it makes no mention of it. Instead, the film spins a cathartic counternarrative. After a murderous terrorist attack a few of our best people — four, rather than a few hundred thousand — go over to the country that spawned the terrorists, kill the bad guys and come home. And they even leave the door open for a sequel.  “The Kingdom” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for intense, graphic violence.

Shouldn't terrorism be treated as crime -- that is, as a civil rather than military matter? It's a question that's at the heart of the Iraq War debate, and it's one raised loudly and clearly by "The Kingdom," a realist thriller that mixes crowd-pleasing mayhem with provocative politics. Although burdened by far more procedure than plot, this Jamie Foxx vehicle -- which owes a great deal to the high-caliber style of its co-producer, Michael Mann -- is quietly jingoistic, in a way guaranteed to sell auds on the idea that what's truly American is about more than disputed foreign policy.
It's unlikely that the Saudi Arabian tourist board will be putting its imprimatur on this Peter Berg-helmed thriller: The entire kingdom within "The Kingdom" is portrayed as a seething snake pit of insurgent cells, the country's legitimate authority holding on by its fingernails to any sense of civil order.
When terrorists slaughter Western families at a picnic thrown by an American oil company -- and follow up with a blast comparable in size to theOklahoma City bombing -- the local investigation, led by Col. Faris Al Ghazi (the wonderful Ashraf Barhom), is fated for a barrelful of frustrations.
The issue is whether trained investigators -- contending with rogue elements that represent no sovereign nation -- would be more effective than full-scale military action in terms of nailing an Osama bin Laden-style evildoer. In his screenplay, Matthew Michael Carnahan tries to fashion real drama out of realpolitik: Back in Washington, FBI investigators -- including Ronald Fleury (Foxx), Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) and Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner) -- are itching to fly into Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and track down the maniacs responsible, but the State Dept., ceding to the sensitive Saudi royals, forbids it. And so, in the long tradition of rogue missions by maverick Americans, Fleury and Co. go in anyway.
Rather than a "Rambo"-esque vengeance-is-mine retribution story, however, auds get something akin to "Adventures in Bureaucracy." Al Ghazi tries to thwart Fleury's every move for fear that the latter will upset the status quo, shaky as it is, and the American movie heroes, being American movie heroes, treat the poor Saudi colonel like an idiot. Eventually, stuff starts blowing up. You're glad it does.
Where pic goes astray is inturning anonymous, indigenous peoples into ducks at a shooting gallery. In "Black Hawk Down," the alleged good guys mowed down hundreds of faceless Africans; here, it's Arabs, in what seem like comparable numbers. The sense of vicarious sport is the same; anyone in a caftan or a kepi is fair game.
Which is too bad, because "The Kingdom," for the most part, tries to be a serious drama about an ongoing crisis, begging the question of whether a movie attempting to spark serious debate should be pandering to the worst instincts of its audience. On the other hand, this isn't exactly "Frontline."Berg adopts a faux-doc shooting style that becomes a tiresome exercise in the kind of handheld camerawork that perhaps once implied immediacy but now implies a lack thereof. "The Kingdom" doesn't have the complexity of "Syriana," nor the real-life pathos of "A Mighty Heart," but it's equally spasmodic, to no real end. More drama and less frustrated action might have kept this "Kingdom" from falling.
Pic was shot in Abu Dhabi and Arizona. Production values are top-notch.

Concluding a month that brought the sixth commemoration of 9/11, a video missive from Osama bin Laden , and a surge endorsement by General David Petraeus , The Kingdom  is a timelyif tepidfantasy of American vengeance on the Qutbian extremists of Saudi Arabia .
Directed by Peter Berg  from Matthew Michael Carnahan 's screenplay, The Kingdom  opens by analogizing the attack on the World Trade Center . A gang of Saudi terrorists orchestrate a Sunday-afternoon assault on an American compound in Riyadh  complete with stormed checkpoint, suicide bombers, and a massive, strategically delayed explosion. The grounds are littered with civilians, but the key casualty is a visiting FBI agent .
Cut to D.C., where the incensed FBI would gladly invade Saudi Arabia were it not for the timidity of craven bureaucratsmainly the U.S. attorney general. (In this alternate universe, the attorney general panders to the Senate, not the president.) The most gung-ho of FBI agents is Jamie Foxx , a volatile woof-machine who intimidates a stray Saudi prince into signing off on an FBI mission to solve the crime. Actually, Foxx is the movie's surrogate president; in his softer moments, he comforts fatherless boys and effects twangy New Age reconciliation.
Leading the mission to Mars (the locations mix Arizona and Abu Dhabi ), Foxx is accompanied by a demographically provocative trio. There's a hard-bodied, no-nonsense chick (Jennifer Garner ), a wise-guy Jew (Jason Bateman ), and a good- natured good ol' boy (Chris Cooper ). Can you guess which of the three will be abducted and made the subject of a throat-slit video? And here's another puzzler: Are there any good Saudisand, if so, who are they? By their appealing looks and appreciation of Foxx's street cred shall we know them: "America is not perfect, but we are good at this. Let us help you," Foxx pleads with the local chief of police (the Arab-Israeli actor Ashraf Barhom , who played a suicide bomber in Paradise Now ).
Should terrorism, as John Kerry  suggested, be handled as a crime? Halfway through the movie, the FBI agents go Marine. United in vengeance, the combined American and Saudi forces eventually eschew dull procedure for thrilling car-chase action, ending with a firefight in a very bad neighborhood. (Call it "Black Hawk downtown.") A hand-to-hand slamming-gouging-stabbing denouement got a mild rise out of the preview audience at the Loews 83rd Street, but the movie's main satisfaction is the utopian spectacle of wounded Americans heading home, mission accomplished.
