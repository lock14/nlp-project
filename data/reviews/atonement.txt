Regret is everywhere in Ian McEwan's 2001 novel "Atonement," like the air the characters breathe or the water they keep tumbling into. It seeps into cracks, weighs people down, turns them brittle and exhausted. It's the stuff of life and the clay of fiction.
How do you make a movie out of this? How do you photograph a black hole of sorrow for things not done and wrongs not righted? Joe Wright's sweeping, ambitious reduction of McEwan's meticulously written book has one answer: Pretend you're making an impeccably acted period piece - the sort of thing that wins Oscars for costumes at the very least - and then go deeper, into mysteries of authorship, art, and human connection. The movie never goes as deep as the novel (no movie could), but it's a worthy approximation: a Merchant-Ivory movie that turns in on itself with a lucid and painful sigh.
The first hour, especially, is a stunning display of moviemaking and emotional gamesmanship in close quarters. Set during one afternoon and evening in 1935 at a sprawling British estate, "Atonement" sticks to a handful of characters as their world changes forever. The key figures are the Tallis sisters: 23-year-old Cecilia (Keira Knightley), recently graduat ed, ardent, snobby, bored; and Briony (a remarkable, eccentric newcomer named Saoirse Ronan), who at 13 years of age is already sure she's a great writer.
But Briony's not a grown-up, not yet, and there are events she can only decipher through a child's sense of melodrama. Most of these involve Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son who grew up with the Tallis family and who has been sponsored at college by the girls' father. To both Cecilia and Briony, he's a much-loved friend and the object of unarticulated longing; everything that occurs this day, in fact, flows from a jealousy too raw to know its name.
Wright seemed to come out of nowhere with 2005's "Pride & Prejudice," an assured debut in which Knightley gave her first real performance. Both director and star advance on that triumph, he with a smoothly propulsive commercial filmmaking style that combines acting, production design, camerawork, and music in ways that sometimes seem breathtakingly fresh; she with a portrait of privileged youth shoved off the ledge of shallowness into adulthood.
Does Cecilia fall? Is she pushed? It depends on who's looking; "Atonement" serenely replays certain events from differing viewpoints, exposing vast gulfs in perception. What a child witnesses as a cryptic event - say, an older sister forced to strip and dive into a fountain - can also be a teasing act of cruelty from an upper-class beauty to the man she's afraid to love. A missent letter can be a mistake, a scandal, or the pebble that looses an avalanche. Interpretation is all, and it is dangerous, especially when the police get involved. A well-told lie can echo for years afterward.
If I'm being coy about what happens, it's from a desire to protect the film's secrets, many of which are sprung on us with wit and a sense of fate turning beneath the characters. The film's opening hour is so beautifully wrought - with Dario Marianelli's luscious score driven by the clack of typewriter keys, and finely daubed performances by Benedict Cumberbatch as a creepy family friend and Juno Temple as a teenage girl caught between Cecilia's maturity and Briony's youth - that the rest of "Atonement" seems vaguely ordinary in comparison.
The film skips ahead to World War II, when Cecilia, Robbie, and a nearly grown Briony (now played by Romola Garai) are still wrestling with the aftermath of that 1935 evening. Because wartime demands sacrifice, it's easy to ask for general forgiveness from hospitalized soldiers rather than specific absolution from people you've wronged, and much of the drama in the second half of "Atonement" stems from one character's slow coming to terms with what has been done and what can possibly set things right.
The rest of the drama comes from an epic re-creation of the evacuation of Dunkirk, the massive Allied retreat of late May and early June, 1940. It's a muddy, bloody, vibrantly imagined sequence, the highlight of which is a stunning four-minute tracking shot through the chaos of the beaches, with the carnage of "Saving Private Ryan" fused with a surrealism worthy of Fellini.
That's the problem, though: The shot screams look at me. Wright is a born moviemaker but he doesn't yet have the directorial maturity to make a show-off moment like this organic to the narrative: You're forced out of the film into frank admiration of technique. The director seems too momentarily seduced by his big-budget toys to attend to the humans.
Or is that the point - that storytelling can turn purple out of an author's desperation and need? Is that why Robbie wanders into a makeshift cinema showing "Port of Shadows," Marcel Carne's unforgiving 1938 classic of romantic nihilism? It's unclear and thus a failure of execution rather than intent.
The film is never less than intelligent, though. "Atonement" comes to a hushed close in the modern day, with one of the characters played by an aging Much Respected Actress, and the puzzle pieces slide together with a final click that satisfies while refusing to console. It's a movie gotcha, simple and deeply emotive, as opposed to the detailed ruthlessness of McEwan's writing. The novelist's message - as patient and old as the Greeks - is that the most gifted people are often the most ruinously blind. Wright is talented enough to hint at the underlying implication, if not its graveyard chill: that art's the broom by which we clean up the horrible messes we make of life.


The music produced by an old-fashioned manual typewriter in the hands of a productive author takes on the aural qualities of a ticking time bomb in the score to Atonement . And that very clever, ever-so-slightly overawed literal-mindedness pretty well sums up everything satisfying, as well as less so, about this luxe adaptation of Ian McEwan's stunning 2002 best-selling novel. Treacheries committed in the name of art and expiation sought are McEwan's themes at their grandest, but director Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice ) and screenwriter Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons ) are convinced that what a moviegoer wants from a literary adaptation is refinement and good breeding. Their movie is abundantly attractive, every scene serenely composed, and every character so fair in love and war that, when the lights come up, it's too easy to say, ''That was good and sad and romantic and classy, now what's for dinner?'' Turning the last page of McEwan's book, in contrast, you're more likely to be shaking from direct devastation and intensity of experience. Different mediums, different messages, I guess  except that the book-loving and  movie-loving me holds fast to the conviction that the right artistic alchemy can indeed turn a great book into a different but equally great movie.
This isn't that. So it falls to composer Dario Marianelli to supply the course-correcting clackety bits that shore up the subtext. It makes sense that the clicks and pings embedded in the melodious musical themes arrive haltingly at first  in imitation of a young typist's mechanical limitations. After all, Briony Tallis (the breathtakingly self-possessed Irish talent Saoirse Ronan, who has porcelain skin and a pitiless blue-eyed stare), a self-serious writer-in-training from a rich, idle English family, is all of 13 years old in 1935 when she creates what she doesn't yet know will remain the most important fiction of her career.
The drama-prone adolescent observes sexual electricity between her glamorous older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley, she of the smoky eyes and knife-edge shoulder blades), and Robbie (James McAvoy, he of the utilitarian boyish masculinity), the college-educated son of the family housekeeper, on whom Briony, too, has a crush. And drawing on her own girlish fantasies, sexual naïveté, and artist's dangerous talent for revenge, one night she tells a whopper of a tale accusing Robbie of a crime he didn't commit, a fiction that nevertheless sends him off to jail for years. Knightley and McAvoy don't have much chemistry between them, but they do share handsome, planed features, they speak a richly clipped, 1930s-movie-style English-from-England, and they look positively Abercrombie & Fitchalicious together. So watching Cecilia watching Robbie led away by cops, we can approximately feel her pain.
The very opposite of happily-ever-after enchantment, the story Briony tells ruins lives for decades to come  including that of the storyteller. And as it does, Marianelli's score quickens, increasing the agitated tempo of speed-typing and turning the dingggg  that announces a full stop and carriagereturn into a kind of time's-up  accusation. Robbie eventually moves from prison to war  he becomes a lovesick soldier in France, one of thousands on the beach at the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940, in a world where the killing is real, not a fairy tale. Wright stages a tricky, seamless, five-minute-plus single-shot Steadicam tour across that battle-wrecked beach with a gallantry that aims for terrible-majesty-of-war cinematic ambition but settles for a disconnected Wow, bloody awesome camera work.  Cecilia becomes a nurse. And, imitating the sister from whom she's now estranged, Briony (played in young adulthood by Romola Garai) herself seeks redemptive nursing war work, at one point furiously scrubbing blood from her hands in one of the movie's less subtle editorial signifiers. (She also continues to write wherever she can, even in a hospital storage closet  because, like any true writer, she can't not.)
In the end  an ending of such power and narrative originality (in both book and movie) that those who know it ought never breathe a word to those who don't  Briony is an old woman, her stricken stare taken up by Vanessa Redgrave. As ever, the attention to detail is careful  the way Redgrave's bearing echoes Garai's, which echoes Ronan's. Even the defeated, sexless dress worn by old Briony rewards the viewer for remembering the virginal, sexless frock worn by young Briony. Atonement  is cultured and tidy like that. It's a nice movie where magnificence is in order.

 Joe Wright’s   “Atonement” begins in the endlessly photogenic, thematically pregnant interwar period. The setting is a rambling old British country estate  where  trim dinner jackets and shimmering silk dresses are worn; cigarettes are smoked with sharp inhalations that create perfect concavities of cheekbone; and the air is thick with class tension and sexual anxiety. Heavy clouds are gathering on the geopolitical horizon, which lends a special poignancy to the domestic comings and goings. This charged, hardly unfamiliar atmosphere provides, in the first section of the film, some decent, suspenseful fun, a rush of incident and implication.  Boxy cars rolling up the drive; whispers of scandal and family secrets; coitus interruptus in the library,  all set to the implacable rhythm of typewriter keys.  Two characters make significant use of a typewriter — one is an aspiring playwright, the other a yearning rural swain — but the sound of the machine is co-opted by Dario Marianelli, who wrote the movie’s score and who conjoins the clack-clacking of mechanical composition with the steady plink of a repeated piano note. At a climactic moment  Brenda Blethyn, who can be as subtle an actress as Mr. Marianelli is a composer, leaps screaming from the darkness and begins beating on the hood of a car with an umbrella, a tocsin that joins the plink and the clack in a small symphony of literal-minded irrelevance.  That pretty much describes the rest of “Atonement,”  piously rendered by the screenwriter Christopher Hampton from Ian McEwan’s novel. This is not a bad literary adaptation; it is too handsomely shot and Britishly acted to warrant such strong condemnation. “Atonement” is, instead, an almost classical example of how pointless, how diminishing, the transmutation of literature into film can be. The respect that Mr. Wright and Mr. Hampton show to Mr. McEwan is no doubt gratifying to him, but it is fatal to their own project.  Unlike Mr. Wright’s brisk, romantic film version of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice,” “Atonement” fails to be anything more than a decorous, heavily decorated and ultimately superficial reading of the book on which it is based. Mr. McEwan’s prose pulls you in immediately and drags you through an intricate, unsettling story, releasing you in a shaken, wrung-out state. The film, after a tantalizing start, sputters to a halt in a welter of grandiose imagery and hurtling montage.  Keira Knightley, who also starred in “Pride and Prejudice,” plays Cecilia Tallis, a rich girl who discovers she is loved by and in love with Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of one of her family’s servants. Their furtive, ardent courtship is observed by Cecilia’s younger sister, Briony (played at 13 by the remarkably poised Saoirse Ronan  —  pronounced SEER-Sha), whose combination of precocity and confusion precipitates a household catastrophe.  A bigger one arrives in the form of World War II, and it is here, in the transition from hothouse psychodrama to historical pseudo-epic, that “Atonement” runs aground, losing dramatic coherence and intellectual focus. Romola Garai has taken over the role of Briony (in a coda, she will age gracefully into Vanessa Redgrave), who  works as a nurse in London. Cecilia, now estranged from the family, does similar duty, and Robbie stumbles toward the beach at Dunkirk.  There are some powerful images — of scared and tired soldiers in  France, of bloody wounds and shattered limbs in London — but the film’s treatment of the war has a detached, secondhand feeling. And even the most impressive sequences have an empty, arty virtuosity. The impression left by a long, complicated battlefield tracking shot is pretty much “Wow, that’s quite a tracking shot,” when it should be “My God, what a horrible experience that must have been.”  The main casualty of the film’s long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme  — and also the ingenious formal gimmick —   that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet. As the title suggests, “Atonement” is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.  Without giving too much away, I will say that the power of the story depends on its believability, on the audience’s ability to perceive Robbie and Cecilia in wartime as suffering, flesh-and-blood creatures. Mr. McAvoy and Ms. Knightley sigh and swoon credibly enough, but they are stymied by the inertia of the filmmaking, and by the film’s failure to find a strong connection between the fates of the characters and the ideas and historical events that swirl around them.  “Atonement” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and graphic combat violence.

Rarely has a book sprung so vividly to life, but also worked so enthrallingly in pure movie terms, as with �Atonement,� Brit helmer Joe Wright�s smart, dazzlingly upholstered adaptation of Ian McEwan�s celebrated 2001 novel. Period yarn, largely set in 1930s and �40s England, about an adolescent outburst of spite that destroys two lives and crumples a third, preserves much of the tome�s metaphysical depth and all of its emotional power. And as in Wright�s �Pride & Prejudice,� Keira Knightley -- echoed by co-thesp James McAvoy --proves every bit as magnetic as the divas of those classic mellers pic consciously references.
Released in Europe next month, and Stateside as a specialty item via Focus in December, pic should reap good returns on the back of positive reviews and figure heavily in upcoming kudo derbies. It proved a popular opener of this year�s Venice fest.
Where Wright�s debut took a relatively free hand in reworking Jane Austen�s classic in more youthful terms, �Atonement� is immensely faithful to McEwan�s novel, with whole scenes and dialogue seemingly lifted straight from the page in Christopher Hampton�s brisk adaptation.
And where �Pride & Prejudice� took a more realistic approach to Austen�s universe, �Atonement� consciously evokes the acting conventions and romantic cliches of �30s/�40s melodramas -- from the cut-glass British accents, through Dario Marianelli�s romantic, kinetic score, to the starchy period look.
It�s a gamble that could easily have tilted over into farce. But Wright�s approach is redeemed by his cast and crew, with leads like Knightley, McAvoy and young Irish thesp Saoirse Ronan driving the movie on the performance side and technicians like d.p. Seamus McGarvey and designers Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran providing a richly decorated frame for their heightened playing.
Like the novel, pic plunges straight into the events of a hot summer�s day in rural southeast England, 1935. As 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Ronan) hammers out �The End� on an amateur play to be performed at home, pic succinctly sketches -- exactly like the opening of �Pride & Prejudice� -- not only the geography of the family manse, but also most of the leading characters in a matter of minutes.
Bracing opening hardly pauses for breath as the first of the day�s cumulative misunderstandings takes place. Briony watches from a bedroom window as her elegant but bored sister, Cecilia (Knightley), spontaneously strips down to her underwear and climbs into a pond to retrieve something for Robbie Turner (McAvoy). Robbie is the housekeeper�s son, who�s been raised almost as part of the family but is forever several social notches below them.
Shocked at her sister�s immodesty, and driven by confused child-adult emotions that are only clarified much later, Briony turns against Robbie. Hardly aware of the consequences, she exploits a stupid, shocking mistake on his part to blacken his name -- and separate him from Cecilia by linking him to a crime he never committed.
The ramifications of her childish spite reverberate through the years. After coming out of jail, Robbie finds Cecilia, now working as a nurse in London. But it�s a fleeting visit, as he�s on his way to France to fight in WWII. By 1940, Robbie is one of thousands of soldiers in retreat and en route to Dunkirk, waiting for boats to ship them back to Blighty.Meanwhile, Briony, now 18 (played by Romola Garai), is also working as a nurse, in an attempt to expiate the guilt she now feels about her actions. Briony�s quest for atonement, for the chance of even a meeting with Robbie and Cecilia, fuels the pic�s final, revelatory 45 minutes, which packs one emotional punch after another.
Film�s opening 50 minutes, entirely devoted to that summer�s day, is an immensely assured roller-coaster ride of emotions, social manners and disguised class warfare, peppered with moments of stillness that capture the essence of the novel�s detailed metaphysical background. Most cleverly, on two key occasions, Hampton�s script comes up with a smart cinematic equivalent of the book�s perpetual shuffling with time -- simply by replaying a scene, unannounced, from a different perspective and in more detail.
Like the performances themselves, pic is highly worked, a deliberate artifact. But its occasional technical trickery -- which reaches an apotheosis in the Dunkirk evacuation, captured in a jaw-dropping, four-minute Steadicam shot worthy of Claude Lelouch in its human detail -- prepares the audience for the even larger twists that make up the yarn�s final third.
Where the movie disappoints is in not conveying the sheer enormity and petty viciousness of the �crime� Briony commits -- and the way in which the family (except Cecilia) closes ranks against the once-favored outsider. Here and elsewhere more breathing space would have helped: �Atonement� is one of those rare movies that feels too short rather than too long, and would have come home comfortably at 135 or 140 minutes.
With the charismatic Knightley in what is technically the book�s subsidiary female role, Briony�s character is a tad shortchanged. Especially after Ronan�s strong showing, Garai�s rather dull, unconvincing adult Briony doesn�t help redress the balance: In her one scene opposite Knightley and McAvoy, Garai just doesn�t hold the screen.
Other perfs are strong down the line, with vets like Vanessa Redgrave (as the older Briony), Brenda Blethyn (Robbie�s working-class mom) and Harriet Walter (Briony�s mother) in little more than cameos. Of the younger cast, both Juno Temple and Benedict Cumberbatch impress as Briony�s sexually aware cousin and her brother�s smug business friend, respectively.
But it�s Knightley and McAvoy�s film, with both showing impressive star poise and physical elan. As the more controlled Cecilia, Knightley hints at the rebel behind the upper-middle-class mask, while McAvoy shows a sheer emotional range that�s completely new to his career. Like Irish thesp Ronan, the Scots actor also turns in an immaculate southern English accent. 
Whole pic, including the French scenes, is convincingly shot around southern England, with a house in Shropshire standing in just fine for the book�s original Surrey setting. Curious decision not to shoot in widescreen almost seems to cramp McGarvey�s graded visuals (bright, semi-pastel summer to hard, colder wartime), and is a definite letdown in the Dunkirk section. Also strange is a caption announcing �four years later� for the Dunkirk material, when it�s actually five. 


Re-reading Ian McEwan 's Atonement last weekend, my first thought was: I hope to God that Joe Wright whose broadly grinning Pride & Prejudice  made a mess of Jane Austen  two years agodoesn't screw up this wonderful novel about lust, love, loss, and what art can do to life. My second was: What on earth is screenwriter Christopher Hampton  going to do with all those runaway subordinate clauses?
No worries: McEwan may rank with Austen as literature's leading exponent of psychological realism, but it's not his densely constructed characters or profusion of descriptive detail that have turned this most eggheaded of writers into such a hot movie property over the years. It's McEwan's Gothic sidehis weakness for building borderline-vicarish moral introspection around a moment of flamboyant horror or black comedy that puts his adaptations into movie theaters.
The tipping point in Atonement  is only slightly less melodramatic, an unnerving act of false witness-bearing that alters the fate of a snobby rural British family on a hot summer day in 1935 and thrusts its younger generation into a world war, one of whose casualties will be the centuries of class privilege. Thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis (played in the movie by a slightly tubercular-looking Saoirse Ronan ) is a budding playwright equipped with more adjectives than insight, who witnesses two counts of what she takes to be the ravishing of her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightley ) by the house-cleaner's son Robbie (James McAvoy ). When a purported child rape takes place elsewhere on the grounds of the Tallises' hideously ornate mansion, Briony tells a lie that, together with the coming war, will ruin more lives than her own.
Picture the fastidiously literary McEwan at a pitch meeting, holding his nose. Then picture Wright talking the talk with his unerringly commercial radar for what will fly across the Atlantic, and you'll grasp the abyss between Atonement , the unobtrusively dark novel, and Atonement , the palatable movie. Wright wouldn't recognize unobtrusive if it tapped him on the nosehe's cross- pollinated the first half of Atonement  into an Oscar-buzzy brew of Masterpiece Theatre  and Upstairs, Downstairs , with the wild English countryside tamed into an artfully lit fairy glade, and into just enough of a bodice-ripper to reel in the youth market. And not a bad one at that. For once in her life, Knightley is shrewdly cast as a brittle flapper with womanly potential, and McAvoynicely underplaying the innocent carnality that will drop Robbie into the hottest water of his inexperienced young lifeprops up this beautiful but lightly gifted actress with all the chemistry she needs while offering a fresh-faced contrast to the slimy visiting chocolate tycoon (the excellent Benedict Cumberbatch ), for whom he takes a tragic fall.
At his best, McEwan is a master at slyly weaving the general through the particular, and opening one point of view into another. Briony's rite of passagea journey through emergent sexuality and the hubris of youth into maturity as a novelist and a chastened adulthoodfolds itself onto the broader canvas of World War II. McEwan and Hampton, who has done a serviceable job of pruning the writer's billowing prose into dialogue, both grew up under the shadow of that war, in which Briony (now played by a soulful Romola Garai ) and the lovers she has so carelessly thwarted encounter at first hand the shattered myths of heroism, and worse. Wright, much younger and evidently a sucker for old Hollywood  movies (as am I), has turned the novel's second half into a cheap knockoff of a 1940s war movie, complete with rapid-fire patrician dialogue and war-is-hell set pieces of smoking battlefields and wounded grunts expiring all over France.
Where McEwan whispers, Wright shouts. In all the clang and clamor of an operatic soundtrack overlaid with the rhythmic thud of typewriter keys and the drumbeats of war, McEwan's deepest and most thrilling themeof how fiction atones for life (and, sometimes, doesn't)falls by the wayside. Which may be why Robbie and Cecelia, who deserve better, find themselves trapped in a drippy Hallmark  card, snuggling on a windswept beach. Forever sepia.
