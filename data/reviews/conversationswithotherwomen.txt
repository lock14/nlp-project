         A man and a woman in their late 30s or early 40s meet at a wedding. She (Helena Bonham Carter) looks particularly ill-at-ease in her bridesmaid's dress as she ducks into corners trying to find a place to smoke. He (Aaron Eckhart) watches her with amused interest and finally asks the bartender to wish him luck. As the reception winds down, the two of them sit at a table, sparring lightly like strangers who've got each other's numbers.
 
  The first thing you notice about "Conversations With Other Women," directed by Hans Canosa and written by Gabrielle Zevin, is its proudly obtrusive cinematic device — a split screen that keeps the actors on opposite sides of an invisible but impassable divide, like the plexiglass partition between prisoner and visitor. It takes a moment for the eye to adjust to the trick; the man and the woman are occupying the same space at the same distance from the camera, and for a while you hang on to the hope that what you're looking at is no more than a divisive background playing a trick on the eye. The device feels like overkill; watching jaded grown-ups flirt is evidence enough of the impossibility of total connection between two people. Gradually, it becomes clear that the man and the woman aren't strangers at all — and their former acquaintance, only a decade past but seeming like a lifetime ago, begins to play out alongside the present.
 


         






    The wedding is in New York, where the man now lives with a dancer 20 years his junior. The woman lives in London and is married to a cardiologist who is several years older. She's been asked at the last minute to fill in for an absentee bridesmaid, although initially it's not clear why she's traveled so far to attend an event full of people she barely remembers and doesn't seem to like much. She's here for a reason, he knows what it is, and as they take the conversation upstairs to her hotel room, the depth and effect of their past relationship is gradually revealed.
 
  "Conversations With Other Women" elapses within a handful of hours and inside two contained spaces. But splitting the screen allows Canosa to move laterally across alternate scenarios and individual perceptions of shared moments, as well as back in time into what now seems like another life, without the use of interpolated flashbacks. Their younger selves, played by Nora Zehetner and Erik Eidem, bounce from barbecues to dance clubs to bed blissfully unaware that what the future holds for them, as a unit, is a single stolen night in a hotel room where they'll wonder what happened.
 
  "All this land used to be mine," the man murmurs into her belly after she undresses, and time does a curious loop. Does memory trump the present, or has time put a distance between them that they could never broach?
 
  Zehetner exudes a wry melancholy that we know will harden into a familiar kind of rueful world-weariness. Eidem, meanwhile, very nearly pops with youthful carelessness and insouciance. Of the two, it's his world-view that has been upended — you get the feeling that his understanding of life has been challenged while hers has been confirmed. He's still charming and feckless, she's still sharp and decisive, but he is now as unmoored as she is resigned.
 
  An intimate movie in every sense, "Conversations With Other Women" sets out to explore well-trammeled yet at the same time uncharted territory without grinding any axes. What it offers is a modest fantasy that will be familiar to contemporaries of Bonham Carter and Eckhart especially. It's sad and funny, satisfying and frustrating, totally familiar. What their sly teasing and gentle baiting reveals, aside from an arch understanding of the self-imposed but still seemingly unpassable romantic roadblocks we throw in our path as we age, is a yearning for a time before accumulated experience completely obscures the view.

 In “Conversations With Other Women,” his debut feature, Hans Canosa splits the screen in two as he observes a man and a woman — their names are never supplied — talking themselves and each other into a one-night stand. The visual gimmick may be the most interesting thing about the film, which otherwise has the studied archness of an over-reaching play (the script is by Gabrielle Zevin). But the split-screen technique also makes the brittle, syncopated exchanges between the characters more absorbing than they might otherwise have been.  Occasionally one side of the frame is taken up by a flashback or an imagined scene taking place somewhere other than the hotel where the two principals, played by Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter, meet. For the most part, though, the paired images present differently angled, simultaneous views of the same thing: the man and woman flirting, bantering and occasionally saying what is really on their minds.  The seam down the middle of the frame divides the man from the woman even when they’re together, emphasizing their mutual isolation and also fracturing the standard film grammar, in which shot is followed by countershot. Here the wounding or revealing word and the reaction to it occur on the same plane at the same time, so that the viewer’s attention is emotionally and psychologically, as well as literally, in two places at once.  This displacement mirrors — perhaps a bit too closely — the experience of the central, temporary couple. They meet at the wedding of the man’s sister, where the woman has been hastily pressed into service as a bridesmaid. Seeing her sneaking off for a cigarette, he follows with two glasses of Champagne and a devilish gleam in his eye. But this attempted pickup is not quite what it seems, even though the two of them pretend, for a little while, to be strangers. It turns out that they know each other quite well, having been married — we see their younger, skinnier selves (Nora Zehetner and Erik Eidem) meeting, falling in love and parting — some years earlier.  Now in their late 30’s, they have moved on. She lives in London and is married to a slightly older cardiologist, while he is living with a dancer who is barely out of college. Whether their encounter is a discreet roll in the hay for old time’s sake or a desperate, sad attempt to recapture a lost past is not entirely clear — not to them at any rate. They try to sustain the lighthearted naughtiness appropriate to a brief, spontaneous fling, but other, stronger emotions reveal themselves: guilt, regret, love.  None of it is quite believable — the film is too studied, too forward in its conceits to be entirely satisfying — but Mr. Eckhart and Ms. Bonham Carter approach their roles with intelligence and conviction. Their personalities are as different as their accents, but both are convincingly complicated.  He dances along the fault line between sweetheart and jerk, while she swings from fragile to ruthless in the space of a single breath. Their chemistry is volatile and unpredictable, and they engage your curiosity even though “Conversations With Other Women” is too thin and forced to allow you to care about them.

The battle of the sexes is restaged to clever but inconsequential effect in "Conversations With Other Women." Very much a case of old wine in a new bottle, this two-hander about a couple sparring and trysting over the course of a night is played out entirely in split-screen -- or, as first-time director Hans Canosa calls it, "dual-frame" -- with sometimes catchy but more often innocuous results. Names of Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart could lift this from the fest circuit to very limited theatrical runs.
An unnamed man and woman in their late 30s meet at the New York hotel ballroom wedding of the man's sister. As she (Bonham Carter) chain-smokes and he (Eckhart) chain-drinks, innuendos and witticisms roll out of their mouths, and they circle one another like cats; they both appear pretty good at their games -- she at simultaneously warding off and attracting male attention with British-accented zingers, he at coming at a woman from so many different angles that his relentlessness is finally irresistible.
First-time helmer Canosa divides the Panavision widescreen frame right down the middle, with one character on each side. But as the actors and camera move around, boundaries are ignored, and thesps often cross the middle line to the other side or turn up in alternate angles of the same scene.
Format is further used to provide flashes of what the characters are talking about, particularly a past that shortly clarifies itself as one the two characters shared as student lovers two decades earlier. Revelation henceforth gives their interchanges a new layer of import as the evening pushes toward the time for them to decide whether or not they're going to bed down; she's got a husband and kids in London, and he's got a hot young girlfriend.
Initial stretch has a frisky, fast-on-its-feet quality that engages, and Bonham Carter's self-deprecating and dismissive way with one-liners amuses in a Bette Davis-lite sort of way. In the final half-hour, however, Gabrielle Zevin's verbally agile script gets too heavy and serious, depleting pic's modest tank of gas very quickly. Nor does it take much advantage of the big opportunity it sets up to explore the differences in sexuality at different ages: what sex means at 19 compared to 38; how desire, lust, sensuality and love between the same people contrasts over such a long gap.
Among the more interesting character insights are the woman's observation to the man that, "Somehow I feel so much older than you," and the general sense that the man is still immature and on-the-make, qualities deftly conveyed in Eckhart's perf, while the woman is cynically over-mature and hung up on her age.
Director-editor Canosa and lenser Steve Yedlin keep everything moving fluidly, although it's debatable how much the elaborately worked split-screen technique actually adds when all is said and done.

Not quite drama, not quite comedy, not quite romance, this gossamer first feature by Hans Canosa  is one of those seemingly wafer-thin chamber pieces that seep pleasurably into you the morning after. Not entirely by chance, two nameless old flames, played by Aaron Eckhart  and Helena Bonham Carter , meet at a New York wedding a decade after they parted less than amicably. Inevitably they spend the night together, but sex, ordinarily the climax of such a setup, comes fairly early on and plays second fiddle to endless gabbing about then and now and what went right and wrong. This would get really old, really fast, were it not for Gabrielle Zevin 's funny, fluid screenplay and Canosa's deft use of split screenoften the laziest of thematic shorthandsto show us not only this couple's skittish history and their equally checkered present lives, but the ebb and flow of their ambivalent attraction. Carter gives a wise and wonderfully rueful performance, Eckhart can do smug bastard in his sleep, and though the movie is occasionally too clever-talky for its own good, it has the authentic ring of an elegy for love lost when one partner grows up while the other runs in place.
