It's become a rock cliché to say that heavy metal stars are acting like something out of ''a real-life Spinal Tap .'' So let's get this out of the way: Anvil! The Story of Anvil  really is  the real-life Spinal Tap . It's a hilarious, and unexpectedly moving, documentary about the greatest metal band you've probably never heard of  Anvil, a crew of Canadian headbangers who came up in the demon-thrash '80s and were potent and original enough to influence the style and sound of Anthrax, Metallica, and Megadeth. We see the band in footage from a 1984 Japan stadium show, and yes, they're pretty great. The lead singer, Steve ''Lips'' Kudlow, scream-snarls with a viciousness that would make Paul Stanley blush under his makeup, and the whole band rockets forward with the kind of hell-bent thunder-god virility that made metal the dominant rock form for a generation.
And then? Then they went nowhere. The film catches up with Lips and his drummer cohort, whose name is Robb Reiner (surely some strange form of Spinal Tap  karma), as they go about their cruddy day jobs 25 years later in Toronto. They're family men, and they still love to play, yet the predicament of being has-beens-who-never-made-it-but-know-they-should-have weighs on them like a cosmic curse. At 50, Lips is a frizzy-haired goofball cherub with eyes that still shine like a child's  he's like Howard Stern as drawn by R. Crumb. Like Spinal Tap 's Nigel Tufnel, he's a master of the kind of ingenious-stupido metalhead logic that masks egomania in   deluded optimism. ''Things went drastically wrong,'' he says of life on the road. ''But at least there was a tour for it to go wrong on!''
Anvil! The Story of Anvil  traces the band's attempt at a comeback in 2007, starting with a half-baked tour of grimy rock caverns in the Czech Republic and Transylvania that turns into a series of farcical disasters. From there, they seek out their old producer to record their 13th album and find a kind of triumph. Lips is capable of punching out a shady club owner (we see him do it), or screaming in   the face of his buddy and bandmate, Robb (the two look like muffin-faced twins). Yet when he talks about stardom, we see the innocent rock dreamer that he has never stopped being. Lips and Robb might have been famous (they were gypped by fate), but Anvil!  understands that the ultimate measure of metal stardom is to remain a legend in your own mind.

 You have to wonder about a movie called “Anvil! The Story of Anvil.” Is the redundancy in the title self-mocking or just bluntly declarative? It’s a question that lingers around the movie itself, which is either an affectionate chronicle of a Canadian heavy metal band that never quite made it or else a deadpan mockery of the same band.  Or maybe both. Or neither. After a recent screening in Manhattan, two of my colleagues and I spent about 20 minutes on the sidewalk arguing about whether the film was a documentary at all. Evidence that it might have been a clever hoax was suggested by the goofiness of some of the group’s lyrics and album covers (all of which feature, what else? a giant anvil) and by what seemed to be sly references to “This Is Spinal Tap,” the definitive rock-mockumentary. One of the members of Anvil is named Robb Reiner, which is the “Spinal Tap” director’s name with an extra “b.” On a trip to England, Anvil works with a producer whose equipment has knobs that go to 11, and the members of the band make a pilgrimage to Stonehenge. The phrase “who were the Druids?” popped into my head, followed by the question, Who is Anvil?  If my fellow critics and I had better headbanger bona fides we might have known that Anvil is a mighty and awesome Toronto-based quartet that enjoyed a brief heyday in the ’80s and never quite made it big after that. That one of us mistook the group for a put-on is partly a result of the highly theatrical nature of the musical genre itself, even if the musicians’ tongues are everywhere except in their cheeks. It’s also true that Spinal Tap has long since transcended satire and been welcomed into the metal god pantheon.  But there is also a kind of sincerity that can seem to the jaded eye like self-parody, and the earnest, heartfelt striving of the two men at the center of Anvil makes the band’s story more touching than comical. Mockery would be too easy and too mean, and the success of “Anvil! The Story of Anvil” lies in its ability to make you care about an enterprise you might initially have been inclined to laugh at.  The film, directed by Sacha Gervasi (whose screenwriting credits include “The Big Tease” and “The Terminal”), begins with an old clip from a rock festival in Japan, perhaps the high point of Anvil’s early career. After tributes from rockers like Slash of Guns N’ Roses, Lars Ulrich of Metallica and Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead, we catch up with Anvil at home in Toronto, where after 30 years the band is still thrashing.  Mr. Reiner, who plays drums, and Steve Kudlow, the lead singer and guitarist, who goes by the stage name Lips, turn out to be two nice Jewish boys from Toronto. Now middle-class family men, they seem a bit tired and defeated at times, but they are also open and passionate as well as reasonably talented. They met as teenagers, and the enthusiasm for music that they shared then has hardly waned, even as their partnership has clearly endured some ups and downs.  Their relationship, as complicated and in its way as beautiful as a long, rough marriage, emerges as the film’s dramatic heart, even as its narrative is focused on their attempt to make one last lunge for glory and recognition. They undertake a tour of Europe under the wing of an ardently well-intentioned, spectacularly incompetent manager and then try to drum up record-industry interest in their 13th album. It’s painful to watch them work so hard for so little, though it’s also frequently funny. And their resilience, quixotic though it may be, is also inspiring. How can you not root for them? They’re such nice guys, and so devoted to their art.  “Anvil! The Story of Anvil” (I’m starting to love that title, by the way) may not change your opinion of heavy metal. I confess it did not inspire me to seek out CDs like “Hard ’N’ Heavy,” “Metal on Metal” and “Worth the Weight.” But it might make you think in new ways about a cruel cultural logic that increasingly obliterates the middle ground between success and failure. Mr. Reiner and Mr. Kudlow may not quite merit full-metal glory, but they don’t deserve oblivion either, and “Anvil! The Story of Anvil” makes both a case and a place for their band. 

A real-life Spinal Tap facing some harsh realities, Canadian metal band Anvil -- whose principals have been playing together for more than 35 years -- proves surprisingly inspirational and endearing in Sacha Gervasi's docu as the members struggle to keep rockin' into their 50s, with commercial success forever just out of reach. Very entertaining docu is amusing without being condescending, touching without straining for pathos. A la the Brian Jonestown Massacre in "Dig!" this warts 'n' all portrait will likely bring the act in question more attention than all their prior toiling. Prospects are good for a specialty distrib wherever hoisted devil-horn fingers spell R-A-W-K.
Original quartet is first seen in wrong-aspect-ratio'd footage from 1984, when they seemed on the brink of stardom. They shared a mighty metal stage then with the soon-to-be-huge likes of Bon Jovi and Whitesnake. But while those outfits rose to the pinnacle of '80s "Headbanger's Ball" success, Anvil -- whose earliest LPs are considered a major formative influence by subsequent speed-metal units like Metallica and Slayer, as testified by some members here -- failed to build further momentum on those moderate hits. Dropped from their major label, they soldiered on, recording subsequent discs on the cheap, playing for dwindling audiences at clubs, still hoping for an increasingly improbable big break.
Founders lead vocalist Steve "Lips" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner now have working-class Toronto day jobs, wives and kids to support. But they haven't given up their teenage dreams yet, much as some loved ones wish they would. Their dogged optimism leads to a European tour (mismanaged), a 13th album reuniting them with stellar metal producer Chris Tsangarides, and finally a triumphant return to Japan after 20-plus years.
En route, various indignities are endured, and the high-strung Lips' tendency to vent frustrations on long-suffering Robb nearly bust up the band for good. (The foursome's other two current players G5 and Ivan Herd are the latest in a line of shorter-term members.)
Vintage clips from Anvil's heyday are highlighted by their appearance on a chatshow, outraging housewives as the TV hostess quotes the hilariously crass lyrics to their song "Toe Jam."
Lips and Robb don't necessarily seem like the sharpest knives in the drawer, but they do write crisp, crunchy tunes, and from evidence here never fail to put on a full-out show whether playing for a stadium crowd or at a bar. They've even had fans dedicated enough to follow them from gig to gig, notably two guys named "Cut Loose" and "Mad Dog."
Throughout, interviews with spouses, siblings and parents demonstrate the degree of tolerance required to stick with middle-aged men still pursuing a 16-year-old's ultimate rock star fantasy at the cost of financial instability and frequent absences from home.
Well-shot and edited, "Anvil!" is an underdog saga even non-metalheads will root for. It tows that fine line between chuckling at its protags' somewhat absurd situation and celebrating their sheer unwillingness to give up.


And now for the story of Lips and the dildo. Back in the late '70s, before Guitar Hero III   or Rock of Love  2  or even VH1 , a jolly Canadian guitarist named Steve "Lips" Kudlow formed a thrash band with his high school best friend, drummer Robb Reiner  (no relation to Meathead). They became Anvil, a four-piece speed-metal circus that toured with soon-to-be cash-cow longhairs like Whitesnake , Bon Jovi , and the Scorpions and reveled in tongue-and-cheek cock-rock clichés. (Exemplary song titles include "Metal on Metal," "Hair Pie," and "Butter-Bust Jerky.") Onstage, Lips wore leather pants, a bondage harness, and a studded dog collar; he also used a dildo as a bottleneck slide to play his Flying V. But more than a decade into this schtick, a show promoter went ape-shit on Lips when unsuspecting concertgoers complained they'd been offended by this porno prop and demanded their money back. That was when Lips, out of genuine respect for would-be fans, decided to retire the dildo.
That might be the only thing that the 53-year-old frontman has retired in his entire life, and this awe-inspiring persistence is now the focal point of director Sacha Gervasi 's phenomenal rockumentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil . Even though Anvil never amounted to anything more than "the demigods of Canadian metal" (which is sort of like being the Slam Dunk Champ of Chippewa Falls ), Lips and Robb decided early on that their sole objective was "to rock forever," and at all costs. Gervasi, a British screenwriter (The Terminal ) who'd roadied for Anvil as a teenager, reunites with Kudlow and Reiner as fiftysomethings in Toronto, both married with sons, toiling away at dead-end jobs by day, headlining strip-mall sports bars by night, and all the while still saying things in earnest like, "Until we become a real commodity, this  is what you deal with."
The same blind faith that has held Anvil together for three decades guides them, in the first half of Gervasi's film, through their biggest tour in 20 years to Europe. Orchestrated by then-guitarist Ivan Hurd 's lady friend, the five-week trek turns out to be a logistical nightmare, seemingly planned by "a demented monkey throwing darts," as Gervasi recently described it. They miss trains in Sweden , get lost in Prague , and perform in Transylvania to 174 people in a 10,000-capacity arena. The tour is such a perfectly executed comedy of errors that, during the filming, one of Gervasi's cameramen locked the director in a room and demanded to know if Lips and Robb were secretly actors.
Rockers in their fifties going for it one last time—if the basic premise sounds familiar, it should. "Spinal Tap   was our Trojan horse," Gervasi, accompanied by the band, explains during a recent press jag at the swank Bowery Hotel . "The drummer's called Robb Reiner . They wrote a song called 'Thumb Hang .' Lips plays his guitar with a dildo . We're dead, like, 11 times. So we may as well use it to our advantage." So Anvil!  became part intentional homage: The band visit Stonehenge  on their European tour, there's an amp that goes to 11, and Lips and Robb sing the first tune they ever wrote in a diner. "We love  that movie," Lips adds, looking characteristically frizzy and leathered. "It's us—in fake."
But Lips and Robb are so very, very real. Robb's sister, Droid, likens their relationship to Siamese twins, but they're more like classic cartoon-buddy foils: Laurel and Hardy  without the slapstick, Jake and Elwood without the blues, Jay and Silent Bob with actual ambition. Hetero life partners, they bicker like an old married couple, and while in the studio recording their 13th album with money Lips borrowed from his sister—their last-ditch attempt at mainstream recognition—Anvil morph from Spinal Tap to Metallica  in Some Kind of Monster : Robb threatens to quit, Lips ends up crying into the camera, and everyone engages in emotionally weighted therapeutic discourse. Yet somehow, these Headbangers Ball  footnotes, with their intentionally goofy groupie anthem called "Show Me Your Tits," end up being far more human and likable than the Mighty Ducks.
A Hoop Dreams  for heshers, Anvil!  has had a happy ending off-screen. Thanks to the doc's festival-circuit acclaim, Anvil is enjoying a comeback of Mickey Rourke –like proportions. Michael Moore  is a fan, as is Keanu Reeves . Slayer's manager signed the band, Coldplay 's booker handles them in the U.K., and Oasis's liaison represents them in the States. VH1 has acquired the exclusive rights to air Anvil! The Story of Anvil  this summer. Random House  will release the Anvil book. Rock Band   will soon have Anvil tracks. There's also an Anvil!  soundtrack deal in the works with major-label involvement. All this before the documentary has even entered wide release. "This is the most famous we've ever been—ever—in our whole 30-year history," Robb admits, awestruck. "With what's coming, with all this, I think the dildo will return."
