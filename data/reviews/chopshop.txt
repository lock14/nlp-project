As he did in his striking 2005 first feature film, Man Push Cart , about a Pakistani street vendor in New York, perceptive indie filmmaker Ramin Bahrani looks at what others overlook and finds drama in everyday details. Set in a bleak junkyard cor¬ner of Queens, where ''auto-body repair'' is indistinguishable from auto-part theft, this gentle drama of getting by in a harsh city jungle features a 12-year-old Latino orphan (Alejandro Polanco) who already knows something about the working world, and his older sister (Isamar Gonzales), who doesn't yet.


 Because the last shot of Ramin Bahrani’s “Chop Shop” is as quiet and matter-of-fact as most of the rest of the film, it takes a moment to register as a metaphor. For nearly an hour and a half we have been immersed in the rhythms of daily life in the battered Willets Point section of Queens, and Mr. Bahrani’s hand-held camera has remained studiously fixed at street level. Now, all of a sudden, it pitches upward to follow a flock of pigeons breaking toward the sky, a shift in perspective that also changes, subtly but unmistakably, our understanding of the movie.  Like its prosaic title, or like those homely birds, “Chop Shop,” written by Mr. Bahrani and Bahareh Azimi, dwells mainly in the realm of the literal. Filmed inside shady auto-repair businesses, on bleak overpasses and in vacant lots in the shadow of Shea Stadium, this film, like Mr. Bahrani’s  2006 feature, “Man Push Cart,”  is concerned principally with the kind of hard, marginal labor that more comfortable city dwellers rarely notice. But there is nonetheless a lyricism at its heart, an unsentimental, soulful appreciation of the grace that resides in even the meanest struggle for survival.  When you stop to think about it, the life of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco)  — known as Ale     — should be cause for despair. A skinny, fast-moving boy a year or so  from puberty, he sleeps in a makeshift room above the shop where he works. His main concern, aside from the daily scramble  for cash, is his older sister, Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who seems more passive than her brother and more detached, perhaps self-protectively, from her emotions. Their parents are never seen or mentioned, and school is more an abstract notion than a real possibility.  Ale’s plan, equally a childish fantasy and a hard-headed entrepreneurial scheme, is to save enough money to buy a broken-down vending truck and fix it up so he and Isamar can sell hot meals to chop shop workers and customers. Isamar works in a similar business and also sells sex after-hours  to drivers who park at the edge of the neighborhood. Ale’s desire, all the more acute for remaining unstated, is to rescue her from this fate and also, more generally, to formulate the plausible idea of a secure adult future for the two of them.  Mr. Bahrani does not treat his characters with pity, and they feel very little for themselves. Perhaps this is because they are too young, and too focused on the present-tense demands of getting by, to dwell on what they don’t have. But the film’s emotional restraint, while impressive, also feels limiting. Mr. Polanco and Ms. Gonzales have the wary inscrutability that often characterizes nonprofessional actors, and though Mr. Polanco is a lively and likable presence, there are times when his performance is tentative and stiff.  Mr. Bahrani was born in the United States and lived for a while in Iran, his parents’ native country (and Ms. Azimi’s), and the influence of recent Iranian cinema on “Chop Shop” is unmistakable. The oblique, naturalistic storytelling, the interest in children and the mingling of documentary and fictional techniques — these have been hallmarks of the work of Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi, but they are rarely deployed  with such confidence or effectiveness by American filmmakers. “Chop Shop” suggests the potential of such an approach, which has roots in postwar Italian Neo-realism, to compel an encounter with local reality that is both poetic and clearsighted.  Whether the situation in “Chop Shop” is entirely realistic is another question. I found myself wondering not only about what had happened to Ale and Isamar’s parents, but also about the total absence of any adult or institutional concern with these children’s lives. The shop owners pay Ale his wages and teach him new skills, but there is a hardness in their dealings with him that struck me as implausible. That may be wishful thinking on my part. Or it may be that I was taken in by the rough surface of this film, seduced into mistaking a subtle, artful fable for the cold, hard facts of life.

The sort of sociological study far more associated with Third World cinema than with American movies, "Chop Shop" scrutinizes life in the so-called "Iron Triangle," a mass of auto shops jammed together on the edge of Queens just beyond the right field parking lot at Shea Stadium. Third feature by Iranian emigre Ramin Bahrani follows the lead of his last pic, "Man Push Cart," in tightly observing a protag on the most invisible margins of U.S. life. An active fest career and brief commercial run await.
Central figure here is Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), a spirited 12-year-old orphan who earns his tiny quarters at the back of one auto repair garage in exchange for luring customers in and doing all manner of odd jobs. Enterprising, but hardly in a cute, charming way, the precociously entrepreneurial Ale, as he�s called, seems well on his way to becoming a first-class businessman in the hustler vein within a few short years, although his lack of family and any normal education will obviously impact him.
Bahrani, whose "Man Push Cart" examined the struggles of a Manhattan coffee vendor, imposes no dramatic artifice on his little vignette as he energetically keeps up with the movements of his bold, slim subject. Only with the arrival of Ale�s older sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales) do any real dramatic interchanges occur; delighted to have her there, Ale finds her work, but eventually becomes greatly disturbed by how she chooses to earn some extra coin.
Vibrantly filmed in the area F. Scott Fitzgerald dubbed "The Valley of the Ashes" in "The Great Gatsby" more than 80 years ago, "Chop Shop" tries the patience and seems thin because of its lack of any real insights into contemporary American life; what Ale goes through trying to work his way up from the bottom of society is no different than it would be anywhere else. Ultimately, the pic will be noted and remembered not for any inherent drama or analysis but for its simply having so thoroughly documented a strange place most people have never seen and never knew existed.
Shot in August of 2006, the pic boasts fine technical work all around. 



You come away from Chop Shop  with a mood, the voluptuous sum of its fine-tuned parts: the way a rundown patch of Queens  is always flooded with mud, no matter how recently it rained; the frightful gusto of a junkyard pit bull gnawing on his favorite toy, a giant steel car jack; flocks of pigeons, rice and beans, a plastic-wrapped sneaker sample and castaway flip-flop floating down a rain-slicked street; hot dogs marinated in lighter fluid, smoking from a sidewalk BBQ; the huge, muffled, incantatory chant of "LET'S GO, METS !" that spills out into the parking lot of Shea Stadium , where a 12-year-old boy, dodging the eye of security, pries off hubcaps with a screwdriver.
His name is Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco ), and he steals to keep food on the table and his sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales ) away from truckers and their $40 tricks. They're streetwise orphans, scrappy and alert, squeaking by on the meager resources that Ale's managed to secure, and retain, with as yet untrammeled optimism. There are odd jobs, paid in cash, courtesy of a kindly auto-shop owner who lets them crash in a tiny room (bed, microwave, refrigerator full of grape soda) at the back of his garage; candy bars and softcore DVDs to sell; a coffee can stuffed with savings; fortitude; innocence; and a dream of independence, as ill-advised as it is poignant, in the form of a rusty old brokedown van, selling for $4,500, that Ale yearns to one day rehabilitate into his very own bright and shiny tacomobile.
All this is imagined by Ramin Bahrani , the acclaimed writer-director of Man Push Cart  (2005), though Chop Shop  derives much of its value from the sense of being found, not made. As signaled by the transparent naming of his characters, Bahrani inflects his drama with documentary, grabbing sights and sounds directly from the street in a dexterous update of neorealist strategies.
All due props to Ale and Isa, wonderfully authentic and nicely harmonized, but the most engrossing character here is the Willets Point  district of Queens, an industrial stretch of unpaved urban flotsam enlivened by a hardworking, multiethnic immigrant population. Working with cinematographer Michael Simmonds , who discovered the "Iron Triangle" when his car broke down, Bahrani is marvelously alert to texture (mud, oil, aluminum, birdshit) and tone (the bustle of the workday, the emptiness of night, how dusk hits the iron girders of a bridge). Ale's labors are fit into an engrossing, off-hand portrait of an entire quasi-underground economy, premised on verbal contracts and street solicitation ("What you need, what you need?").
Authentic as all this feels (and smells, and tastes), Chop Shop  gives off a heightened sense of reality, a faintly idealized atmosphere akin to the Lower East Side milieu of Raising Victor Vargas , a close relative in the New York branch of neo-neorealism. Bahrani doesn't omit hardship so much as subsume it within the larger framework of his benevolent sensibility. Chop Shop  avoids the pitfalls of romanticism (and miserablism) by keying this empathic touch to the consciousness of Ale and Isa. For them, Willets Point is simply home, and if their ecosystem, precarious as it is, sometimes feels enchanted, that's because children always transform their surroundings into playgrounds or battlegrounds—arenas of struggle and play.
The narrative conflicts of Chop Shop  unfold quickly but unrushed: Ale's pursuit of his dream van and mounting unease over Isa's extracurriculars are never directly confronted, but rather subtly insinuated into their relationship through his vigilant commitment to alternative sources of income. Ten more minutes and Bahrani might have tipped to the maudlin, but Chop Shop  resolves its poetry and plot in an abrupt, pitch-perfect non-denouement. Life goes on—but not, it seems, for Willets Point as it now stands, "another euphemism for urban blight" per Mayor Bloomberg , gentrification glinting in his eye.
