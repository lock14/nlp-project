Back in September 2005, with his summer hit Wedding Crashers
 making money faster than studio heads could count it, Vaughn, the new king of Hollywood comedy, decided to put aside acting and try his hand at the impresario game. Gathering together four young stand-up comedians he had scouted at Los Angeles� legendary Comedy Store, Vaughn jumped in a bus for a 30-day tour of the heartland, aiming to �bring great comedy to everywhere America,� �everywhere America,� of course, being anywhere that wasn�t California or New York (�Comics� Schticks Big Hits in Stix!�). What tour-documentary director Sandel and his crew soon discovered was that Vaughn wasn�t only bringing comedy to Middle America; he was on a whole charm offensive, eager to give everyone from St. Louis to Cincinnati to Atlanta the chance to bask in the reflected glow of his success and mile-a-minute patter. As emcee of the Wild West Comedy Show, he took to the stage every night not just to introduce his comedy crew to the world but to celebrate the career of Vince Vaughn in bizarre, self-indulgent displays: He called Justin Long (Accepted
) up onstage to re-enact a scene from Swingers
; he and his Crashers
 co-star Keir O�Donnell rekindled their twisted homoerotic push-and-pull as part of an audience-participation gag; he even restaged a scene from a long-forgotten afterschool special he starred in with his friend (and one of this film�s producers) Peter Billingsley (A Christmas Story
). Onscreen it all plays out like some sort of self-coronation, a celebration of the boy Vaughn�s rise to the heights of superstardom, which is odd considering there are four comedians that he hired waiting just offstage who would kill for a small taste of even regular stardom. To be fair, however, those comedians (Ahmed Ahmed, John Caparulo, Bret Ernst, Sebastian Maniscalco) are probably still a ways away from that kind of success. Aside from Carapulo, who traffics in his own idiosyncratic blend of self-deprecating absurdity and sexual desperation, they�re mostly from the aren�t-men-and-women-different, aren�t-parents-crazy, isn�t-racial-misunderstanding-adorable school of comedy. There are few social observations you haven�t heard a thousand times before, and apart from Ahmed�s riffs on the difficulties of being Arab in post-9/11 America, there�s exactly zero controversy of any kind, which is a shame considering the tour came face to face with Hurricane Katrina and its now-infamous political fallout en route to New Orleans. Instead, you get four decent comics plucked from obscurity and given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play big venues packed with eager fans who would probably have roared at a 20-minute set by Alan Greenspan if Vaughn had deigned to give him his blessing.

"Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show" can't make up its mind whether to be a document of four comedians cracking jokes onstage or a documentary about the cross-country tour they're on. The movie's amiable, impulsive, intense, and scattershot, and since those are qualities associated with Vaughn himself, in the end it's a fair representation.
In September 2005 the star of "Swingers" and "Wedding Crashers" mounted a rolling stand-up revue, picking four comics he liked and inviting various other friends to hop on the tour bus. The resulting movie (its full title is "Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights  - Hollywood to the Heartland") isn't so much a snapshot of modern comedy as evidence of an exhausting but rewarding road trip with the boys.
The comedians are: Ahmed Ahmed, telling sardonic tales of being Arab in post-9/11 America; John Caparulo, a runty, foul-mouthed baby redneck (from Cleveland, go figure); Bret Ernst, a self-described Guido from New Jersey with a knack for physical slapstick; and Sebastian Maniscalco, as finicky and as funny as an ethnic Seinfeld.
Their delivery is much fresher than their material, which consists of the usual observations about women in bars, airport security, working at Subway, all pitched in tones of dude mock-outrage. Director Ari Sandel chops up the routines and serves them to us piecemeal, and by the time the film gets to Chicago, we've heard most of what these guys have to offer.
We also get personal bios, visits with parents, and glimpses of backstage insecurities, a reminder that many professional comedians are usually one heckle away from suicidal despair. By the end of the film, we've come to know them as people and to hope that Maniscalco will be able to quit his waiting gig when he gets back to LA.
Vaughn comes along as host, tour-bus therapist, and drawing card  - he's the reason this frat-boy revue attracts mostly young, female audiences. "Swingers" co-star Jon Favreau drops in for a skit or two, as does actor Justin Long; along for the entire trip is friend and producer Peter Billingsley, all grown up from when he was playing Ralphie in "A Christmas Story." The film's comic highlight is probably Vaughn and Billingsley's onstage re-enactment of a 1990 CBS Schoolbreak Special about steroid abuse they both appeared in.
Elsewhere, "Wild West Comedy Show" reflects the star's passions and musical interests: a stop in Bakersfield, Calif., because Vaughn's a Buck Owens fanatic (Dwight Yoakam turns up onstage), a booking at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, home of the original Grand Ole Opry. When the tour diverts to Alabama after Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, it's Vaughn who makes the comics go to a nearby campground and hand out free tickets to the dispossessed. The boys grumble all the way there and are noticeably silent on the return trip  - proof that the only way to shut a comedian up is show him someone unhappier than he is.

Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show  has a loosey-goosey, what-the-hell spirit that's easy and fun to hook into. Early on, Vaughn says that he put together a variety show in 2005 that would travel by bus to 30 cities in 30 nights. When we first see Vaughn, cutting up in front of an L.A. audience, he seems game for anything, as he's joined on stage by his old cohort Jon Favreau, who now has a Tony Soprano swagger. Favreau and Justin Long read from the script of Swingers , all to demonstrate how little talent it took to perform Vaughn's star-making role in that film. The routine is so money we're in the palm of their hand.
On the road, though, the film, ditching Favreau, turns out to be a variety show of very little variety. The stage clips are mixed in with backstage high jinks in a way that recalls early-'70s rock-carnival films like Mad Dogs & Englishmen , but the show itself boils down to this: a quartet of perfectly okay bellicose male stand-up comics doing their practiced observational bits  in other words, nothing you couldn't catch in the middle of the night on Comedy Central. I laughed at self-described ''guido'' Bret Ernst's impersonation of techno music, and at the gentle paranoia of John Caparulo, who views the world through a fish-eye brain. But the gender-behavior jokes, delivered as if they were news, may now say less about the way men and women are than about the way stand-up comedians are. In a word: arrested.

 The extravagantly titled “Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days and 30 Nights — Hollywood to the Heartland” imagines itself a contemporary equivalent of rootin’- tootin’ traveling entertainments like Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. That’s a tall comparison to draw.  Nothing, not even Cirque du Soleil’s high-tech spectacles, could live up to the reputation of William Cody’s 19th-century touring circus, which involved as many as 1,200 performers and living legends like Sitting Bull and Annie Oakley.  On this not-so-rowdy 6,000-mile tour of one-night stands in 2005, Mr. Vaughn and four rising young male comedians (and  drop-in guests) traveled from Los Angeles across the southern tier of states and ultimately wound up in Chicago, Mr. Vaughn’s hometown.  Though it includes some moderately funny snippets of actual performances, “Wild West Comedy Show” is not a concert film. We never see a complete performance or even a quarter of one. The recipe for Mr. Vaughn’s variety show is left to the imagination. More of a backstage documentary, the movie explores the lives of his guests, handpicked comedians from the Comedy Store, a Los Angeles club.  John Caparulo, Bret Ernst, Sebastian Maniscalco and Ahmed Ahmed are observant, likable comics, but their humor never approaches the scabrous, cutting-edge extremes of someone like Sarah Silverman. All are youngish, ambitious professionals who are not about to blow an important career opportunity.  Among the tamest tours ever filmed, this one appears to have involved no drugs, and the only alcohol in sight is an occasional beer or glass of wine. Despite the abundance of beautiful women in every city, the sexual temperature remains below normal.  Early in the film we are reminded that the golden age of comedy has passed. In the 1980s, when leading comedy clubs franchised themselves and stand-up humor was wishfully called the rock music of the day, instant riches beckoned aspiring comics by the thousand. When “Wild West Comedy Show” was filmed, Mr. Maniscalco still had a day job as a waiter.  Mr. Vaughn, the tour’s mastermind and M.C., exudes the same amiable, guy’s-guy brashness he displays in movies like “Wedding Crashers.” But none of his protégés kill, to use stand-up comedy lingo. Most of Mr. Ahmed’s humor revolves around his paranoia as an Egyptian-born Arab-American having to endure humiliating waits in airport security checkpoints after 9/11. We meet his parents, who immigrated to the United States when he was a baby and hoped their son would become a doctor or a lawyer.  Mr. Ernst, the most physical of the four, does a funny bit as an inferior skater in a roller rink. Mr. Caparulo plays a geeky, self-mocking loner from Ohio. Much of Mr. Maniscalco’s humor deals with the contrasting behavior of men and women in nightclubs.  As the tour proceeds from city to city, fragments of country music provide regional flavors. In Bakersfield, Calif., the tour makes a pilgrimage to a museum celebrating Buck Owens with accompanying music and television clips from “Hee Haw.” Dwight Yoakam, an Owens disciple, joins Mr. Vaughn onstage and cajoles him into singing.  Because the tour came after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, it had to be rerouted. In the most revealing scene Mr. Vaughn and his crew visit an Alabama trailer camp to give free tickets to the residents, many of them New Orleans evacuees who lost everything. In a collective moment of insight, the performers realize that sleeping in bunk beds in close quarters on a tour bus isn’t the worst thing in the world.  “Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and raunchy humor.

Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights -- Hollywood to the Heartland Tour

Ungainly titled, overlong, intermittently funny docu laffer "Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights -- Hollywood to the Heartland Tour" does just what it says on the tin. More than a vanity project for the currently hot actor but less than gripping cinema, either as a performance film or as a life-on-the-road tell-all, pic's market life is assured via high-profile Weinstein Co. buy at the Toronto fest. Thesp's name ensures theatrical tour, with real muscle coming from ancillary.
Between thesping projects, Vaughn decided in September 2005 to mount and front a modestly scaled variety show and tour it for a solid month in various cities between Hollywood and his hometown of Chicago. Per Vaughn, his twin inspirations were the lack of such an in-person event for modern auds, and an urge to see more of the country.
He enlisted the aid of up-and-coming comedian pals Ahmed Ahmed, John Caparulo, Bret Ernst and Sebastian Mansicalco for the backbone of the act. From the clips glimpsed, it appears the individual standup routines were punctuated by improvs featuring various guest stars: For the opening night in Hollywood, Vaughn's "Swingers" co-star Jon Favreau and Justin Long improve a strained sketch, while Dwight Yoakam shows up in Bakersfield, Calif., to teach the headliner how to sing.
On the tour itself, producer Peter Billingsley, child star of "A Christmas Story" and, per Vaughn, "my best friend," joins him to re-create a scene from the steroid-themed "After School Special" on which they met, while "Wedding Crashers" co-star Keir O'Donnell does an ongoing gag revolving around his artist character in that film.
Each of the four featured comics works blue: Ahmed's comedy, which from his Egyptian background and contempo racial stereotypes, is counterbalanced by Caparulo's gravelly delivery and backstage insecurities that paint him as a live-wire loner.
Ernst brings a commanding physicality to a bit set in a roller rink, while Mansicalco's pungent observations on the modern male, coupled with his fastidiousness on the road and genuine amazement at being included, flag him as pic's most interesting and fully formed figure.
Various episodes illustrate vagaries of life on the road. A broken toilet at the San Diego venue creates problems; Caparulo melts down over the midnight theft of a sandwich; the boys are glimpsed hosing each other off in a car wash.
Though pic as a whole mirrors the genial mischief of Vaughn's immensely popular onscreen persona, what's sorely lacking is any creative tension. Everyone seems to get along fine, and, when a minor clash erupts over a hastily arranged benefit show for flood victims, their mixture of resentment and apprehension over having to hand out tickets at an Alabama trailer park comes across more as petulant than ominous. In short order they're back to a life that Ernst describes as "spring break for 30-year-olds."
First-time helmer Ari Sandel's wisest decision was to allow the comics a chance to relate backstories and interact with their families during the trek. To a man, they come across as nice guys, committed to a mercurial craft in an uncertain business full of guys just like them.
Tech package is admirably seamless given the peripatetic nature of the project, with special credit due editor Dan Lebental for maintaining the energy level as best he could over a daunting two-hour running time. Blasts of geographically relevant rock songs, including "Streets of Bakersfield" and "Georgia," keep things moving along between stops.

Even at 100 minutes, this documentary about Vaughn and pals' 2005 bus tour from L.A. to Chicago (and all points in between, oy) plays a little longdue to the "comedy show" part mostly, which is filled with such antiquated bits as "Starbucks  customers order the damnedest things," "dudes who show off their iPods  in the gym are douchebags," and "techno music's for tone-deaf stoners." Echoing the far more successful Comedians of Comedy , Ari Sandel 's backstage-diving doc showcases the grind of life on the road. Only Vaughn's fab foursomeamiable irritant John Caparulo , nostalgic Bret Ernst , would-be waiter Sebastian Maniscalco , and proud Muslim Ahmed Ahmed are thrilled to be along for the ride. The doc provides plenty of backstory (meeting the comics' families offers generous context to material heard earlier in the film). But in the end, it's the bits involving Vaughn and his celeb guests that linger, chief among them two re- enactments: one in which Justin Long  reads Vaughn's Swingers  part with Jon Favreau , and other in which Vaughn re-enacts his role in a 1991 CBS Schoolbreak Special  about steroid use with his actual co-star, A Christmas Story 's all-growed-up Peter Billingsley . Also on hand: Dwight Yoakam , Buck Owens , and Keir O'Donnell or, as he's always referred to, "the gay guy" from Wedding Crashers .
