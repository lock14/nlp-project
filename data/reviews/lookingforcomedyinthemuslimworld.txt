Perhaps only Albert Brooks, the master of angst-ridden comic self-doubt and oblivious boorishness, would have dared envision a comedy that, just as its point-blank title states, searches vainly for yucks in one of the most politically volcanic and cordite-scented flash points of the world. That he�s a Jew only adds to the increasingly ludicrous setup, and so when Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World
 peters out around the halfway mark, you can�t help but wonder if Brooks has bitten off more falafel than he can swallow. Previous Brooks films � his great opening salvo, Real Life
, and 1991�s Defending Your Life
, in particular � thrust Brooks� menschy, can�t-do nebbish into the real and romantic worlds with both sage and comic observations. More recent stumbles, like the godawful The Muse
, seem calculated to make non-Hollywood audiences squirm. While nothing in Looking for Comedy
 is as joyless as all that, it�s still a wildly uneven ride that never delivers on its inherent promise of giving Yankee xenophobia the shellacking it so duly deserves. Brooks plays a version of himself, first seen being roundly dismissed by Penny Marshall for the Jimmy Stewart role in her upcoming remake of Harvey
 (although you can just see him � or not, as the case may be � as the titular hare), then receiving an unexpected call to glory from the U.S. government (in the form of real-life politician Fred Thompson), who asks him to travel to India and Pakistan to discover what, if anything, makes Muslims chuckle. There�s a hitch, of course: Brooks must file a 500-word report upon his return, a seemingly mammoth undertaking that forms the quietly hysterical underpinning of this doomed undertaking. Shepherded by a pair of State Department lackeys (Tenney and Lynch) and a vivaciously game interpreter (Sheth), the Innocent Abroad travels to New Delhi and discovers that a) Polish jokes work the world over, and b) shit jokes bomb in India. Shuttled from one disastrous attempt at intersocial bonding to another, Brooks eventually hits on the idea of renting a hall and performing his own version of stand-up before a mass audience; woe unto him, his comic-intellectual deconstruction of the Western comic mainstays of improv and ventriloquism dies a lonely onstage death in a sea of polite coughs and onscreen squirming. The predictable end results of Brooks� fictional mission are the border flare-ups that arise among rival nations and the occasional smart gefilte fish-out-of-water gag (Al-Jazeera offers him a sitcom titled That Darn Jew!
), but for all its presumed bravado, Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World
 is an essentially toothless affair, poking fun at American imperialism and its attendant cluelessness while never illuminating much beyond the obvious.


The biggest joke in any Albert Brooks movie is Albert Brooks. Often, as in "Modern Romance," "Lost in America," and "Defending Your Life," the joke is funny. The stupid world conspires to shame Brooks and his sense of superiority: What good is being better than everybody else if you lose at everything?
In Brooks's latest, "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World," failure and self-mockery are again the point. They're also a curious side effect: This is by far the most embarrassing of his seven movies.
The writer-director plays Albert Brooks, a pathetic version of the narcissistic filmmaker he played in 1979's "Real Life," his best film. In this movie, a State Department commission, headed by the actor and former senator Fred Thompson, wants Brooks to tour India and Pakistan to find out what makes the Muslims there laugh. It's an attempt to improve international relations. Spying hasn't worked, maybe comedy will. Brooks frets about the volume of the assignment (a 500-page report!) but salivates over the Medal of Freedom that would come with its completion.
Accompanied by two dutiful government suits (John Carroll Lynch and Jon Tenney), Brooks stops first in India, where, needing an assistant, he hires a local named Maya (Sheetal Sheth). She's the only applicant with clerical skills who doesn't also happen to be an anti-Semite or aspiring transsexual. Brooks and Maya have a number of neat exchanges about tone. "If I miss a sarcasm," she says, by way of apology, "please tell me."
Someone in the movie calls Brooks the Henry Higgins of comedy, but the comparison doesn't hold. No sooner do his travels begin than "Looking for Comedy" declines into condescension and casual racism.
Maya is eager to learn from Brooks. Brooks is content to loaf. He has her pad his report with gratuitous history and, along with the two suits, do all the legwork for a stand-up show he plans to perform. Brooks is cranky and receives no lasting joy from his accidental pupil. Everyone is odious to him, too, especially Lynch's character, who's an opinionated Brooks fan, and Maya's Iranian boyfriend (Homie Doroodian), who questions the comedian's choice in material. The more constructive their criticism, the more officious Brooks finds them.
There, of course, is the trouble. Brooks means himself to be odious, too. His awareness of this is the film's central conceit. But it's neither funny nor fun for us. We feel for his critics. In his other movies, Brooks's sense that he was right and everyone else was wrong was appealing because, as it happened, he was right -- or at least relatable. For a class of intelligent yet cowardly people who were fed up with or disillusioned by certain realities of American life, he was a spokesman. Here it's unclear to whom he's speaking.
"Looking for Comedy" appears to send up American aloofness. But the targets are all Third World. Brooks doesn't provide a significant counterpoint to his snobbery. The office the government finds him in India, for instance, is a shabby box down the hall from an all-purpose call center that the movie uses for easy laughs ("The White House," one receptionist says. "How may I direct your call?").
Uninterested in his original idea, Brooks tries a change-up that pushes the movie into early Woody Allen farce. Word of his mission and a furtive trip across the border make the Indian and Pakistani governments suspicious. Could he haphazardly provoke these two to start warring again? Another interesting possibility. But Brooks is dabbling.
For one thing, he isn't looking for comedy. He's trying to see whether his act plays with Muslims and Hindus. We learn in one disastrous encounter between Brooks and a packed house in New Delhi that it doesn't.
On another night he watches what looks like a local sitcom, but it never occurs to him to find out whether Indians like it, or why. He goes all the way to South Asia and all he learns is how to make a bomb.
.


         Albert Brooks has a great wince.
 
  His eyes form little half moons, his shoulders hunch almost imperceptibly and his dark, curly hair appears to tighten. It's an indicator of his discomfort and generally precedes a low-decibel whine that says, "I don't know about this ... "
 


         






    In "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World," Brooks' gently amusing take on the U.S. relationship with the Islamic world, he's uncomfortable a good part of the time and not without reason. The writer-director plays an American comedian named Albert Brooks whose career bears a more-than-passing resemblance to his own.
 
  The fictional Albert Brooks of the film shares the same highs and lows as the filmmaker — who most recently starred in the dismal remake of "The In-Laws" and the animated blockbuster "Finding Nemo," in which, of course, no one sees his face. The lack of a visible hit has triggered a period of "inactivity" known in other lines of work as being unemployed. He can't even get more than a perfunctory meeting with director Penny Marshall for her remake of "Harvey."
 
  When he gets home from that disappointing meeting, his EBay-obsessed wife (Amy Ryan) presents him with a registered letter from the State Department. Brooks fears that it's about a little visit he paid to an Al Qaeda website.
 
  Instead, he's summoned to Washington where Fred Dalton Thompson (the former senator from Tennessee who now plays the D.A. on "Law & Order") is heading a special committee. As Thompson puts it, the government would like to try a new tactic, different from the usual "spying or fighting," and attempt to understand the people of Islam. They want Brooks — not their first choice — to spend a month in India and Pakistan and file a 500-page report on what makes the people of the region laugh.
 
  He's assigned two State Department functionaries (John Carroll Lynch and Jon Tenney) who accompany him to New Delhi, where they set up an office in a dreary little building that seems to house all of the world's outsourced customer service centers.
 
  Brooks hires an enthusiastic Hindu assistant named Maya (Sheetal Sheth), who has a jealous Iranian boyfriend (Homie Doroodian), and begins interviewing people on the street about what they think is funny.
 
  It's not the trip to the far-off land that most unnerves Brooks (though he's not keen on flying coach or the fact that no one meets them at the airport), but the length of the report he's asked to write — which is brief by bureaucratic standards, he's assured by the committee. When he discovers that there are no comedy clubs in India, he decides to do a free stand-up comedy concert for several hundred people in a school auditorium. What they laugh at will be the key to who they are (he hopes) and allow him to fill those many pages.
 
  "Looking for Comedy" is not Brooks' funniest film, but it possesses his trademark wry humor and is slyly observant. At first glance, it would appear not to have much to say. But Brooks, a low-key comedian, has a fondness for the broad, high-concept set-up that masks the subtlety of his satire.
 
  Here, he takes great pains to portray the Indians and Pakistanis with sensitivity, avoiding stereotypes for the most part and presenting a naturalistic view of their contemporary societies. Brooks has always been interested in the juncture where "Real Life" (which was the title of his first feature) veers off into comedy, which is actually what he is parodying in the film. The difficulty of comedy and the neuroses and insecurities of its practitioners are the real targets. The funniest moments are not when the character is deliberately trying to make people laugh, but rather in the human interactions and absurd situations in which he finds himself.
 
  Though his typically clueless on-screen persona learns very little about comedy or Muslims, Brooks the filmmaker makes the underlying point that true understanding is achieved through observation and empathy.
 
 
'Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for drug content and brief strong language
 
 A Warner Independent Pictures release. Writer-director Albert Brooks. Producer Herb Nanas. Executive producer JoAnn Perritano. Director of photography Thomas Ackerman. Editor Anita Brandt-Burgoyne.   

Albert Brooks used to be a master at making his audience squirm with laughter. In his early, funny films, like Real Life  (1979), Modern Romance  (1981), and the classic yuppie burlesque Lost in America  (1985), he could spend whole scenes talking his way out of the trouble he'd just talked his way into. Harassing all comers, taking his audience on bumpy flights of defensive patter, he was the Larry David of his day  the Last Earnest Jew in Los Angeles, a man whose ''conversation'' was really a plea, an argument, a prolonged noodgy onslaught of self-justifying riffs.
The Albert Brooks who wrote, directed, and stars in Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World  is, in a sense, just an older version of that earlier verbal-fizz neurotic. This time, he even plays himself: famous comedian and filmmaker Albert Brooks, who, in a running gag, is now best known for voicing the role of a fish in Finding Nemo . Called to Washington, Brooks is asked by the State Department to journey to India and Pakistan, where, as a means of advancing sensitivity in the war on terror, he's to spend 30 days exploring what makes the Muslims of the world laugh. He's given a couple of bodyguard gofers, nerdish Stuart (John Carroll Lynch) and surly Mark (Jon Tenney), and after hiring an Indian assistant, the comely, adoring Maya (Sheetal Sheth), he makes plans to present a comedy concert in New Delhi.
Brooks is paler now, his eyes tugging downward where they once twinkled. He's still spinning in circles of neurotic banter, but with a key difference: In Looking for Comedy , as in The Muse and Mother , his semi-duds of the '90s, his words no longer come from a place of need. Brooks has mellowed; his air of squelched panic is gone. He now appears genial and complacent rather than possessed, as if he'd accepted his role in the universe but, for the sake of his movie, had to pretend to be the Albert Brooks of old.
Donning an outfit that makes him look like the leader of Sgt. Vindaloo's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Brooks performs his big comedy act, which consists of sub-Vegas one-liners (''I was in Kashmir last weekend  went to visit one of my sweaters!''), a lousy ventriloquist routine, and an impression of a Japanese man that would be racist if it weren't... well, actually, it is racist.
The movie isn't racist; it's just lame. If Brooks truly cared about Muslims or how their funny bones worked, Looking for Comedy  might have had some zing, but all his character is interested in is the 500-page report he has to deliver  a homework assignment from hell. Looking for Comedy lacks a genuine  or funny  point of view. The Indians are right to sit in silence at Brooks' dreadful concert, but the film still insists on portraying them as humorless stoics. Is that the joke? Brooks never connects with the Muslims on screen, all of whom are one-note characters. Smuggled into Pakistan, he puffs on a hookah and repeats his stand-up routine (once was bad enough), and he meets with executives from al-Jazeera, who want to star him in a sitcom called That Darn Jew ! That's as close as the movie comes to a daring laugh, but it's not close enough; it's a cliché posing as post-9/11 edge. It's hard to know what Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World is trying to ''say'' when finding the comedy in an Albert Brooks film has become an increasingly dicey proposition.

 One of the running gags in "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World" is that Albert Brooks - the director, screenwriter and star, as well as the main character - is best known around the world for his role in "Finding Nemo." Or as it is more frequently and humiliatingly put, for playing a talking fish in a cartoon.  Mr. Brooks likes to deprecate both himself and the work for hire he does in Hollywood, but the difference between "Nemo" and his own films may not be as great as he pretends. Whether or not they are named Albert Brooks, his anxious, baffled, passive-aggressive alter egos are always fish out of water, made perpetually uncomfortable by the ordinary business of the world.  Mr. Brooks has pursued this premise on the open road ("Lost in America"), in the hereafter ("Defending Your Life") and in his own backyard (in "Modern Romance," "Mother" and "The Muse"). "Looking for Comedy" ranges farther afield - all the way to India and Pakistan - and as a consequence is less introspective than those earlier pictures, though the character named "Albert Brooks" is no less self-involved. This film's humor is based on the obvious discrepancies of culture and temperament that are its subject, and it tiptoes across a minefield of political sensitivities on its way to a handful of pretty good jokes.  Unfortunately, there are not quite enough of those to carry an audience through 98 minutes. Like many movies of its kind, "Looking for Comedy" is front-loaded with inspired gags, and the first half-hour is both sneakily and explosively funny, raising expectations that are never quite met. Mr. Brooks generates a lot of momentum from a conceit that seems at once utterly ludicrous and strangely plausible, namely that an American comedian might be sent overseas by the State Department to see what tickles Islam's funny bone.  Fred Dalton Thompson, the lawyer-turned-actor-turned-senator-turned-actor (who regularly plays a lawyer), is in charge of the project, which arises from a candid acknowledgment that there are large swaths of the world's population that the American government just doesn't get. "The Africans, the Chinese," Mr. Thompson enumerates, "but most of all the Muslims." Mr. Brooks - not the administration's first choice, but good enough - is dispatched to Delhi with two bureaucratic sidekicks (John Carroll Lynch and Jon Tenney), one of them a devoted fan. The comedian's assignment - for which he is promised a Medal of Freedom - is to produce a 500-page report on what makes Muslims laugh. While he's at it, he might throw in something on the Hindus, too.  Once in India, he hires a perky, naïve young assistant named Maya (Sheetal Sheth) to help him with the document, but she is able to produce only a few pages of notes. "Looking for Comedy" experiences a similar shortfall, noodling and meandering through colorful settings and promising set-ups as its farcical vigor and satirical rigor drain inexorably away.  It turns out that Mr. Brooks's interest in the nature of comedy is less anthropological than philosophical. His approach to the contemporary clash of civilizations - surely a ripe subject for risky, queasy humor - is curiously timid, as well as lazy. Like the comedians surveyed in "The Aristocrats," Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette's documentary essay on the world's dirtiest joke, "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World" is best understood as an inquiry into the theory and lore of professional comedy. But unlike "The Aristocrats," which managed to be both shocking and smart, this movie's abstract, cerebral quality becomes both puzzling and boring.  Mr. Brooks has never been one for obvious belly laughs or zany physical comedy; you have to work a bit to appreciate his humor, which is fine when the jokes themselves work. A meeting with Al Jazeera network executives (they want to pitch a sitcom idea) is funny enough in itself, and made appreciably more so by the fact that Mr. Brooks wears what he takes to be the local attire while his interlocutors are dressed in sober business suits. The real punch line comes when Mr. Brooks's fictional wife (Amy Ryan) wonders if he should be so quick to turn down television money.  But other situations sputter and falter, and plot lines - including one involving Maya's jealous Iranian boyfriend (Homie Doroodian) - never really gather momentum. Mr. Brooks's screen persona, while as worried and put-upon as ever, also seems strangely becalmed, and his self-absorption, which expanded movies like "Lost in America" and "Defending Your Life" into full-blown studies of cultural malaise, shrinks "Looking for Comedy" into a series of hit-or-miss riffs.  In one of these, Mr. Brooks, caught up in conversation, walks right past the Taj Mahal without noticing it. There is some resonance in the conceit of an American so wrapped up in himself that he misses the reality of the rest of the world even when right there, larger than life, all but staring him in the face. Still, making the joke at his own expense doesn't quite get Mr. Brooks off the hook. "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World" is really about finding Albert Brooks wherever you look, and leaving the Muslim world to fend for - or laugh at - itself.  "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some naughty innuendoes and strong language.

Four years after 9/11, actor-director Albert Brooks takes a humorous stab at defusing the equation Muslim equals terrorist in "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World." Pic is well-timed to catch a wave of rethinking facile stereotypes. But though it risks political incorrectness every step of the way, film is more a pleasant laugher than a sharp-edged satire, and many international auds may be disappointed to find the action is set not in the Mideast but in India.
Stateside, where Warner Independent distribs after Sony took a pass, fearing controversy, pic's bold topicality should widen Brooks' audience base beyond his last helming effort, "The Muse." Film leapt its first hurdle when it went down sans dissent at its Dubai fest world preem Thursday. U.S. release is set for Jan. 20.
As in many of Brooks' films, the writing sparkles more than the serviceable direction. Here Brooks plays the ambiguous mockumentary game, casting himself as a film actor named Albert Brooks who has appeared in "The In-Laws" and lent his voice to a fish in "Finding Nemo." His humiliating meeting with director Penny Marshall (as herself) and his own casting director Victoria Burrows ends with Brooks being derisively blown off for a remake of "Harvey."
Unemployed, with a big house, a daughter and a wife (Amy Ryan) addicted to eBay, Albert finds himself summoned to Washington by the State Department. The officials there promise not money but a medal if he travels to India and Pakistan to write a 500-page report on Muslim humor for the president.
What looks like a posh assignment sours almost immediately. Albert finds himself squeezed into economy class on the airplane with his State Dept. handlers, Stuart (John Carroll Lynch) and Mark (Jon Tenney). Their "help" always comes with a sizable down-side, like the crummy office they rent for him next to a call center in New Delhi.
After hiring an enthusiastic young Hindu woman, Maya (Sheetal Sheth), as his assistant, Brooks hits the streets to talk to people and ask what makes them laugh -- with predictably dismal results. Undaunted, he stages his own stand-up comedy routines for a local audience that never even chuckles. (These are such meta-spoofs on stand-up comedy that the film's auds may find them puzzling, too.)
Finally, Albert's trip to Pakistan falls through when his handlers can't get him a visa. Instead, they smuggle him across the border at night to have a secret meeting with local comedians, who turn out to be the only ones who find him hilarious -- even in translation.
Film's only venture into potential controversy involves Albert's visit to Al-Jazeera, the Arab TV news channel, where he's offered a role in a new sitcom, "That Darn Jew," about an American Jewish man who moves into a Muslim neighborhood. This scene is funny because it finally touches a nerve, something the film generally seems loathe to do.
As if trying to maintain a diplomatic balance, Brooks pokes as much fun at the Americans as he does the poker-faced Indians and giggly, hash-smoking Pakistanis. The tightly structured script only over-reaches itself when it strays into the territory of international diplomatic incidents, suggesting Albert was unwittingly responsible for the military build-up on the Indo-Pak border and a near-nuclear war. There just isn't enough material to make this idea funny -- and it invites unflattering comparison with the grand black humor of Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove."
A more serious puzzle is what the film, which was shot in India, has to do with the Muslim world. India has a significant Muslim minority but the people Albert meets come from a potpourri of religious backgrounds. Maybe the point is that the president's question has no answer, and that people, far from being the same all over the world, can't be pigeon-holed so easily. But the film is left with a big soft spot in the middle, because we never find out what makes Muslims -- or anyone else -- laugh.
With a plethora of good lines and absurd situations, Brooks can afford to play smart and straight as a self-deprecating detective in search of comedy. Sheth beams like a ray of sunshine as Albert's chirpy assistant, who's as bright and free-thinking as she is eye-catchingly pretty. Lynch and Tenney have far less interesting roles as the State Dept. boys, and both bumble too little for their comic good.
Editor Anita Brandt Burgoyne keeps things running briskly. Other tech work is unobtrusive.

Too provocatively titled for its first distributor, Albert Brooks 's Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World  is nothing if not high-concept. This is the most self-reflexive of Hollywood 's post9-11 movieswondering, as it does, just what exactly the patriotic entertainment industry can do to help make things right.
Looking for Comedy  crypto-sequel to Brooks's Real Life , a meta-act in which Brooks plays himselfas a failure. He's introduced attempting to audition for the real Penny Marshall , casting a remake of Harvey . When she hears who's next, her displeasure is evident. "I don't want to go a Jewish way," she tells her staff. War-on-terror paranoia or simply social realism? This is the first time the J-word has appeared in a Brooks movielet alone been used to characterize his persona. But the subject at hand ensures it won't be the last.
As far back as Stand Up and Cheer (1934), Hollywood proposed a "Department of Entertainment ." Now, possibly confused with Mel Brooks , if not Steven Spielberg , Albert is summoned to Washington, D.C., to meet with former senator Fred Thompson  (playing himself) and take a role in the government's plan to "instrumentalize laughter." Specifically, he is to travel to South Asia  to determine the Muslim sense of humor. The suggestion is that the idea came from George W. Bush : "The president has a pretty darn good sense of humor." (And he does appreciate happy news.)
Thompson hypnotizes Albert by dangling a Medal of Freedom before his eyes, even as he confounds him with the need to write a 500-page report. The mildly Kafkaesque situation, with Albert obsessing over the report (as he will in his inimitable fashion, for the remainder of the movie), is heightened when he is shown flying coach to India in the company of two cheerfully incompetent State Department  aides, obviously modeled on K.'s helpers in The Castle . Set up in a shabby office in a building full of outsourced call banks, Brooks stages his own casting call, looking for an assistantwho isn't a Mel Gibson  fan and doesn't realize that he's a Jew.
Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World  is predicated on the absence of Muslim comediansalthough somehow The New York Times   manages to report on the phenomenon every six months. Baffled by the local TV and defeated in his attempts at on-the-street interviews, Albert decides to organize a comedy concerthanding out flyers on the streets of Old Delhi  (a most flavorsome location). In the movie's lengthy set piece, Albert appears in a school auditorium, absurdly dressed in native garb to greet his supremely unresponsive audience with a resolution to discover "what makes you guys chuckle." The act, partly derived from Brooks's old routines, is doomed to bomball the more spectacularly once Albert moves into conceptual territory with fake ventriloquism and faux improv.
The humor in Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World  is so dry that those expecting boffo yuks might well be looking for water in the desert. Moreover, the movie is complicated by two paradoxesone annoyingly obvious, the other fascinatingly implicit. The first is the use of India, which, although home to 150 million Muslims, has six times as many Hindus; the second is that Brooks's comic sensibility travels so badly. Woody Allen  may bestride the world like a colossus, butthe brilliance of Real Life , Modern Romance , and Lost in America  notwithstandingnot even the French have shown any interest in Albert Brooks. I'd hazard that this has something to do with the untranslatable subtlety of his one-liners (dependent as they are on situation and delivery) and the uningratiating nature of his persona (complete with refusal to acknowledge blatant neuroses).
Brooks is the great uninflected narcissist of the movies. Never quite recovering from Albert's lovingly staged and fabulously failed stand-up routine, Looking for Comedy  goes cloak-and-dagger, complete with disturbing intimations of the martyred Wall Street Journal   reporter Daniel Pearl . Almost despite itself, this is a deeply pessimistic movienot least in blandly suggesting that, the universality of stupid pet tricks aside, the mindless application of Cannabis sativa  may be the only surefire chuckle bait. Stoned, even the most terrifying Muslims love Brooks's lame routines, and that's all he really wants. "I killed, everything worked!" he exults.
In the end, Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World  is a satire of American solipsism. (The perfect accompanying short subject would be a précis of Karen Hughes 's Middle Eastern goodwill mission.) Brooks plays a character so self-absorbed he visits the Taj Mahal  and manages not to notice it. As the film ends, who can fail to appreciate the care with which he steps on his own apocalyptic punchline? That's the joke.
