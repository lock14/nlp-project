A squaresville term like hardcore just doesn't apply to the nonstop sexual activity in Shortbus . Core-free is a more apt description for the real sex performed by the noodly actors in John Cameron Mitchell's giddy carnal extravaganza. The participants demonstrate, as per the impish intentions of the man who invented the brilliant Hedwig and the Angry Inch , that inserting tab A into slot B is as unremarkable a daily activity as brushing one's teeth. Except maybe funnier, if that diddles your funny bone.
It'd be dishonest not to disclose that it doesn't diddle mine, not the way Mitchell has in mind. If I'm going to see sex on screen  as opposed to the brushing of teeth  I want something hotter. I find these people silly, and desperately antic.
Anyhoooo   the movie is a fiesta of effing as well as of joking, singing, and even of complaining the way clothed people do all the time. Sook-Yin Lee plays a sex therapist seen banging her way through positions A to Z with her husband, yet frustrated that she has never had an orgasm. Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy play boyfriends looking for a willing third. A dominatrix has relationship issues. Everyone knows his and her way around downtown New York City streets.
And for the getting off of rocks, everyone makes visits to a weekly Brooklyn sex salon of Mitchell's invention, named for the stubby school vehicle that transports special-needs and special-ed kids. Shortbus  is chipper, it's fresh, it emits a distinct musk of controversy. I'll take the longbus.

 As utopian visions go, it doesn’t get much better than “Shortbus,” a film in which all you need is love — and sex, lots and lots of mutually, sometimes collectively, pleasurable sex. John Cameron Mitchell wrote and directed, though orchestrated might be the better word for a carnivalesque romp in which men and women engage in sex in a multitude of creative combinations. An ode to the joy and sweet release of sex, the film manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it, notably in a ménage à trois featuring a cheeky rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner.”  It may be no surprise that questions of beauty and the sublime, as well as those of politics, rarely factor into the equation when a frisky blond neighbor in a pornographic video casually drops by. But it’s incredible how most nonpornographic films are also dumb about sex, particularly in America, where copulation too often leads to frenzied violence or soft-core clichés. Mr. Mitchell, who previously wrote, directed and starred in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” has said that he wanted to make a film in which sex wasn’t negative or dreary. He also wanted his creation to serve as “a small act of resistance against Bush and the America we live in because it’s trying to remind people of good things about America and New York.”  Set in rooms scattered across Brooklyn and Manhattan, “Shortbus” locates much of that good in the hearts, minds and bodies of a young gay man, James (Paul Dawson); his married therapist, Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee); and a lonely dominatrix, Severin (Lindsay Beamish). Struggling with the most intimate of problems, each seems one teardrop away from a meltdown. The sorrow plaguing James, who’s in a committed relationship with the relentlessly upbeat Jamie (P J DeBoy), and Sofia, who’s married to the seemingly stolid Rob (Raphael Barker), prevents each from fully committing to their partners and, by extension, to the world beyond. For her part, Severin, at once naughty and nice, communicates with others mainly by way of an efficiently applied whip that’s begun to leave welts on her psyche.  Mr. Mitchell isn’t the first nonpornographic filmmaker to incorporate sexually explicit material into his work, but he may be the most optimistic and good-natured. Pier Paolo Pasolini, Catherine Breillat and Lars von Trier, among others, each have gone where few career-sensitive filmmakers dare. But enterprises like Nagisa Oshima’s 1976 shocker, “In the Realm of the Senses,” an explicit story of sexual obsession that culminates in castration, tend to turn on the mind more than the body. Designed for intellectual provocation and aesthetic transgression rather than purely instrumental purposes, the sex in films of the more serious sort tends to be a drag. There is, surprise, surprise, nothing like naked bodies writhing under the aegis of a political metaphor to dampen the libido (and spirit).  Make those bodies laugh as well as writhe, as Mr. Mitchell does here, and the metaphors can feel less punishing, more palatable. The title of one of Ms. Breillat’s gentler provocations is “Sex Is Comedy,” which Mr. Mitchell could have borrowed for his own. The man was born for vaudeville: he likes big laughs and gestures, both in abundance here as coupling bodies. He also likes funny noises, goofy accouterments and soapsuds of drama: one character in “Shortbus” wants to die; another wants to experience what the French call the little death. Yet another likes to watch, a nod to the pleasures of voyeurism that in time also becomes a lesson about vacating your comfort zone for a role in the human comedy.  Unlike traditional hard-core features, in which the sexual encounters interrupt the story like a number in a 1930’s Busby Berkeley musical, the carnal interludes in “Shortbus” are integrated into the narrative, much as the singing and dancing are in “Oklahoma!” This integration goes a long way to normalizing the sex, making it seem matter-of-fact, natural, and it also normalizes watching this kind of material in the kind of public space where you don’t need a roll of quarters to keep the images flowing. Mr. Mitchell sustains this sense of everyday ease even when the characters start frequenting Shortbus, a sex club with the relaxed vibe and noise level of a nice restaurant, albeit one with condoms on the menu rather than small plates.  Part cabaret, part commune, the club functions as an adults-only playground, as well as a testing ground for Utopia; in other words, it’s America without the plastic, the fear and the hate. Mr. Mitchell has said that the title “Shortbus” refers to the smaller yellow buses sometimes used to shuttle special-needs students to school. That doesn’t mean that the kids aboard his bus shouldn’t receive the same breaks as those riding on the bigger buses; if James and Jamie wanted to get hitched at City Hall after a night of swinging, Mr. Mitchell would probably be happy to act as a witness. But mainstreaming into a culture that insists on turning people and sex into commodities, among its other ills, may not necessarily make for a happy ending.  Mr. Mitchell finds his happy ending in raucous music and warm caresses, in an oceanic feeling in which everyone is free to be freakily you and me. His idealism is pleasingly touching and just maybe a bit naïve. It’s an idealism that feels out of place next to the hot-to-trot television housewives, panting pop divas, cringingly graphic memoirs and novels in which sex is an index of late capitalism at its most bleak. Certainly it’s deeply, if promisingly, at odds with an American movie mainstream that has grown progressively more prudish about sex over the last three decades, while its representations of violence have grown more obscenely violent. Hollywood says let it bleed. Mr. Mitchell would rather we get off on life.
"Shortbus" is the cinematic equivalent of a relationship that begins with sex on the first date and then wants to get more serious when you'd rather just have more sex. Unquestionably the most sexually graphic American narrative feature ever made outside the realm of the porn industry, John Cameron Mitchell's ambitious attempt to merge his characters' active sexual lives with more conventional emotional content is playfully and provocatively entertaining for roughly the first half, but loses staying power thereafter when investment in the uncompelling characters' problems is requested. The lubricious action, which comes in a lively and varied set of permutations, puts this way over the line for most distribs and exhibs, so while pic will be an immediate must-see for certain audiences, especially gays, in limited theatrical release, it will find its true and lasting home on DVD.
Mitchell, in the wake of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," has finally fulfilled a dream that a number of filmmakers had in the early 1970s, that of plausibly working hardcore material into a legitimate dramatic picture. From the eye-popping opening scene, sex pervades the action, and it is clearly the writer-director's intent to start outrageously so that, after the second or third time the actors get it on, it won't seem so unusual anymore.
Still, the polymorphous couplings are more inventive and entertaining than the emotional content. Mitchell's exuberant, playful approach and unfailing good humor feel far better matched to the characters' experimental probings than to their purported anxieties.
The central figures here are embarked upon problematic sexual quests; the main woman is a relationships therapist desperate to experience her first orgasm, and one of the men is suicidal, but there's far too much fun in Mitchell's sexual wonderland for such negativity to last.
Pic's intro may be the coolest movie welcome to New York City since the opening of "West Side Story." In the shadow of a looming Statue of Liberty, a beautifully abstracted animated model of the city is swooped down upon and through to locate the scenes of the action, and some vigorous intercutting to jazz accompaniment shows there's lots going on.
In one apartment, a young man starts playing with himself and does some contortions to orally finish the job. A straight couple seems intent upon re-enacting much of the Kama Sutra in one session. A dominatrix does her thing on a wimpy guy in a room over Ground Zero, and it all climaxes with a nifty joke at the expense of the Jackson Pollock school of painting.
The fellow in the tub was James (Paul Dawson), a former hustler who's been going with the dense but hunky Jamie (PJ DeBoy) for five years. Now they're dickering with "opening up" their relationship, so they visit therapist Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) to discuss the possibilities.
In the process, they learn her secret, that she's been faking orgasms with her husband Rob (Raphael Barker), so the boys invite her to a "Shortbus" party, a sort of downtown bohemian sex mixer where music and campy chit-chat prevail in one room, lesbians convene to chew things over in another, and whoever wants to dives into the action in the orgy cafeteria. "It's just like the '60s except with less hope," intones the event's sardonic ringmaster, Justin Bond.
Hunky James and Jamie have little trouble finding a third, a lad named Ceth (Jay Brannan), for their branching out experiment, a move that culminates in a memorable daisy chain with the threesome, just for a change of pace, singing "The Star Spangled Banner" while doing things that were no doubt long illegal in many states.
Despite a ready welcome mat, Sofia decides the Sapphic crowd doesn't do it for her, bonding rather with the dominatrix Severin (Lindsay Beamish), whose own barriers to intimacy are broken through only with great difficulty. Pic's theme overall has to do with the problem modern city dwellers, at least, have in feeling genuine emotion and letting other people "penetrate" them in ways other than physically, which is easy.
But Sofia's dilemma is in the end one-dimensional and hard to dramatize meaningfully, while the boys, despite James' closely held angst, scarcely seem tormented once they break the ice by sharing Ceth and never become multi-faceted enough to generate sincere interest.
Secondary characters such as Rob and a voyeur (Peter Stickles) who eventually joins the action aren't nearly as arresting as Bond and an old gay gent who says he was once mayor of New York.
So it's fun while the fun lasts, which will vary for different viewers. But despite the variable outcome, Mitchell earns major points for daring such a project, finding a cast willing and able to carry it off, developing the story with the thesps so the sex integrates with the general flow of events (while remaining dominant), achieving a smooth and nimble visual style, and suffusing everything with an intense curiosity and generous spirit.
All craft elements feed into the vibrant vibe, as do the energizing and sometimes witty musical elements.

The sex is real in John Cameron Mitchell 's Shortbus ; only the settingan animated New York cityscape, watched over by a fluorescent Statue of Liberty is fake. To an extent, that describes the movie: a sexually daring, dramatically timid roundelay that employs unsimulated twosomes, threesomes, and even solos for skin flute in the service of subplots reminiscent of late-night-cable soap. Yet there's something refreshingly frisky and celebratory about Shortbus  that offsets its flaws. It's a triple-X midnight movie with a heart of squarest gold.
In the jazzy opening sequence, cut like a musical-comedy overture, the camera flits among a bomber crew assortment of proclivities: Hunky ex-hustler James (Paul Dawson ) attempting to suck himself off, a hetero couple banging away at a piano, a morose dominatrix (Lindsay Beamish ) silencing her rich-kid client's inappropriate small talk ("Do you think we should be in Iraq ?") with a few surly lashes.
Everyone seems to be getting off except Sofia  (Sook-Yin Lee , a Canadian TV personality destined for one hell of a Q rating). Frustratingly "pre-orgasmic" with her husband, Sofia throws herself into her work, sex therapy; her patients include James and his longtime lover Jamie (PJ DeBoy ), another couple whose relationship has hit the wall. At their urging, Sofia crosses the vanilla-sex Rubicon into the domain of Shortbus, an orgiastic Brooklyn  lounge where gender is fluid and anything goes.
"It's like the '60s, only without hope," intones pansexual ringmaster Justin Bond  (the champion scene stealer, two parts Dietrich to one Joel Grey ) in the movie's instant catchphrase. Or the '70s, without ignorant bliss. When Deep Throat  made its unprecedented conquest of legit audiences in 1972, cineastes hoped it would blow away the Hays Code's prudish residue and give Hollywood  a mandate to explore the gray zone between art and obscenity. A decade later, Last Tango in Paris yielded to Porky's .
Working with characters who pack considerably more than Hedwig's angry inch, Mitchell wants to party like it's 1973. Or at least he wants the same thing as those adventurous moviegoersexplicit sex treated as a facet of shared existence rather than taboo raincoat material. Mitchell's cast of fresh-faced fellators and fetishists could pass for a touring company of Rent . Or think Friends,  only with Ross  felching Joey. For its first half, Shortbus  succeeds in doing the nearly impossible, fusing hardcore to light comedy without losing either its raunchiness or lightness. If anything, its mostly unfamiliar actorswho, in the 42nd Street  (or pre-Giuliani 42nd Street) tradition, are going out nobodies and coming back starsperform less self-consciously with their genitals than with their soul-baring dialogue.
In its somber second half, though, Shortbus  starts to creak. The problem isn't that the film becomes serious; it's that it has such a limited idea of seriousness (goopy psychodrama, suicide attempts). The attempt to convey character through sexual activity is admirable, but watching the group through sex goggles alone eventually filters out almost everything else that's interesting about them. Linked by their inability to feel, Sofia, the dominatrix Severin, and James are reduced to suitable cases for treatment with only one solution. The boisterous happy ending that administers sexual healing has the contrived insistence of a public service announcementa resolution as safe as the sex is transgressive.
As with Brokeback Mountain , though, it's not the sexual content that seems revolutionary; it's the mainstream friendliness. That friendliness is a double-edged blade. In distinguishing his experiment, Mitchell has explained that porn merely wants to arouse. Fair enough, but part of the openness briefly promised by porno chic involved getting audiences to own up to their prurient desires: Why exactly am I here watching a dirty movie, and why am I responding? Shortbus  ultimately makes it too easy for viewers to convince themselves they're reading a strokebook for the interviews.
At the same time, given the recent cinema's track record of unfaked hate sex (Baise-Moi ), diseased sex (Anatomy of Hell ), or just plain lousy sex (take your pick), Shortbus 's messianic sex-positive cheer seems more startling than its straight-up intercourse. Even with the phantom presences of ground zero and AIDSamong the Shortbus clientele is a doleful Ed Koch  look-alike haunted by the epidemicMitchell's Brooklyn hot spot holds the same allure that Manhattan always had in old musicals: It's a beacon of cosmopolitan self-invention. Shortbus  celebrates New York as the melting pot of smut. In what should be the movie's most outrageous scene, Jamie, James, and their boy toy Ceth (Jay Brannan ) spontaneously erupt into "The Star-Spangled Banner" during a convoluted three-way, using each other as human bullhorns. It sounds like a sneering provocation. But in performance, it comes off unironically jubilant, even patrioticis this a great country or what? As long as one man remains free to sing the national anthem into another man's asshole, the terrorists haven't won.
