Being Batman is a drag. One day there are nipples on your body armor, the next, zero superfluous papillaries. And that cowl! No peripheral vision. Hello? It's tough enough ridding Gotham City of a cancerous electorate and corrupt law enforcement officials, but having to shred your trapezius every time some joker with a crazy dream arrives in town is more than anyone should ask. But sacrifices must be made, because that's what heroes do. Or so goes the nihilistic logic behind The Dark Knight
, a grim little parable on the wages of sin and the high cost of redemption. It is, of course, impossible to view Nolan's extravagantly dour film through anything but the prism of Ledger's death. His Joker, so unlike that of Jack Nicholson and about as far removed from Cesar Romero as humanly possible, is the sort of convoluted, densely layered characterization that gets nominated for awards come Oscar time. He arrives onscreen sporting a cheapo rubber clown mask, but when the mask comes off, sure enough, the face beneath the frown splits into a poorly pancaked rictus, a dead-man's razor-blade smile. "Some people just want to watch the world burn," is how Alfred (Caine, given little to do), Bruce Wayne's trusty butler, describes this clown's modus operandi, and he's spot-on. As Ledger plays him, the Joker's just out for a grin, setting fire to mountains of stolen mob-money while secretly striving not simply to vanquish his enemies, but to bring them down to his gutter-eye level, to besmirch their good names, and to sully their honor in the eyes of Gotham's citizens. Ledger gives a career-defining performance, made all the more poignant in light of his untimely death. It's a pity, then, that when taken as a whole, this 2½-hour film is such a stuffy downer. It's jam-packed with flawlessly designed set-pieces and skulduggery, sure, but it's also shrouded in grim portent, overlaid with a filigree of despair, and, for good measure, covered in a patina of dire consequence. In short, it's a Batman
 for the new age of anxiety. Gotham D.A. Harvey Dent (Eckhart, straying far from Tommy Lee Jones' wack-jobbery) is both the law-and-order embodiment of the caped crusader's rough justice and a vessel for the Joker's machinations, and his fate, which shall not be revealed here, is horrific indeed. And then, above it all, dramatically backlit and eternally conflicted, towers Bale's Batman, an icon who, in the three years since Batman Begins
, has had all the vitality sucked out of him. He growls more here than he did in Nolan's first foray into the franchise (Batman Begins
), and he's buffer, too, if such a thing is possible, sporting cheekbones that look as though they were sculpted with a Dremel. There's something intangible missing from this Dark Knight
, though. For all its thrum and thunder, from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's wonderfully percussive score to the eerily beautiful shots of Batman, his cape fully unfurled, swooping among the vertiginous, skyscraping towers of downtown Gotham City, Nolan's film feels chilly and ill at ease. Apart from the perpetually fascinating Gyllenhaal, who plays Bruce Wayne's once-upon-a-girlfriend Rachel Dawes, The Dark Knight
 lives up to its title in both tone and execution, a grim commentary on a grimmer reality. The only thing here that feels truly, utterly alive is Ledger's maniacal, muttery Joker. The last laugh is his and his alone. It's enough to make you cry.



Ledger's Joker brings a twisted smile to a long and brooding Batman sequel.
Two hours and 32 minutes long, "The Dark Knight" is grimly magisterial. It's a summer blockbuster that contemplates near-total civic disaster: Crowds surge, tractor-trailers flip, and buildings explode, but the pop violence feels heavy, mournful. Light barely escapes the film's gravitational pull.
Yet flitting through this 10-ton expressionist murk is a diseased butterfly with stringy hair and a maniacal giggle. Played by a dead actor, he's the most alive thing here.
It's not quite fair to say that the late Heath Ledger steals "The Dark Knight" from Christian Bale and the forces of (problematic) good, but, as the Joker, he is the movie's animating principle and anarchic spark - an unstoppable force colliding with the immovable objects of Batman and director Christopher Nolan's ambitions. Much more serious in intent and message than 2005's "Batman Begins," "Dark Knight" would be fatally ponderous without Ledger's nasty little sprite. As it is, the movie strains at its own Wagnerian seams.
"Knight" begins where "Begins" left off, with Gotham City desperately trying to wrest itself from the grip of the criminal underworld. New mob boss Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts) cuts deals with the Russians and Chinese while the media tries to figure out whether this Batman guy is a hero or a vigilante. Imitation Batmen run amok, led by the earlier film's Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy, in a brief and unexplained appearance). And someone is robbing the mob banks of Gotham, leaving a Joker behind as a calling card.
Is Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman) of the Major Crimes Unit somehow involved in the heists or merely taking advantage of them to seize the bad guys' assets? What does the new district attorney, a white knight named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), want? Why is Wayne Enterprises holding merger talks with a shady Hong Kong businessman (Chin Han)? "The Dark Knight" takes a while to sort itself out; even at 152 minutes, you can feel the three-hours-plus monster this was carved from. Confusion reigns in the opening scenes; loose threads abound toward the end (including one major figure literally left hanging).
Yet the generous midsection works as an agonized big-muscle action film about a conflicted superhero. As Bruce Wayne, Bale is gravely shallow, and he lacks the sense of fun Robert Downey Jr. gave his obscenely rich playboy in "Iron Man." Bruce uses his secret identity as a hidden camera to glean information from the city's upper echelons, but he's not quite there otherwise. This, oddly, is what makes him interesting, both to us and to assistant DA and ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, taking over from Katie Holmes and providing the character - at last - with a spine and a brain).
Batman's a whole other story. The filmmakers have worked out the mask problems from the previous film; Bale fills the suit with grace and danger. His voice is disguised as well - it's now a bass-heavy synthesized whisper. The character seems more than ever an extension of his high-tech toys (like the neat-o Bat-scooter that pops out of the Batmobile at one point, ecstatically rearing up like the Lone Ranger's Silver). He represents a citizen's darkest urges, though, and it eats at him. He's Dirty Harry crossed with Hamlet.
The complicated plot involves Batman, Gordon, and Dent putting the squeeze on the mobsters, who look to the Chinese businessman as a financial savior and to the Joker to rid them of Batman. The Joker, of course, has his own agenda, and if you're not sure what that is, he's happy to spell it out for you. "I'm an agent of chaos," he sneers in one of the script's more italicized bits of dialogue, but we don't need to be told, since Ledger embodies that sentiment in every brilliantly off-kilter line reading.
We never find out where the Joker came from. Every time the character tells the story of how he got his smiling scars, the details are different, as though he were making himself up on the spot. The gambit works because Ledger re-invents the comic book super-villain as a wildly watchable Method nerd. The character's body movements are wobbly but controlled, the eyes darting with nervous energy as he calculates his next move. The tongue slithers.
Yet even when he's done up in drag as a nurse - a freakish, hilarious scene - this Joker never grandstands like Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 "Batman" or Cesar Romero on the old TV show. Instead, he mutters and natters with bent, subversive intelligence. He's a small man delighting in tipping over the big guys.
"The Dark Knight" itself comes close to tipping over in its final act (or two). Whirling action set pieces like a Hong Kong kidnapping and the detonation of a hospital have come and gone, and the appearance of a subsidiary villain named Two-Face - half his face burned horribly away, keeping the film out of kiddie territory - ups the stakes. At one point Nolan finds himself cutting frenziedly between Batman, Gordon, the Joker, Dent, Rachel, and a crazy man in the police cooler, and you feel the film's sense slipping away between the smoking edits. (I haven't seen the IMAX
 version, but I imagine it's overwhelming, and not in a good way.)
On top of this are laid themes of moral complexity that make "Hellboy II" and "The Incredible Hulk" look like, well, comic books. The question of whether a true hero is a due-process man like Harvey Dent or a "dark knight" who breaks the rules and gets innocent people killed is worried at throughout the film, building to a climax that forces us to confront exactly what murdering someone might do to the average man's soul.
"The Dark Knight" prods at the boundaries of power and surveillance as well, casting a shadow over Batman while leaving his technological guru (Morgan Freeman) in the light. (Michael Caine's Alfred, meanwhile, acts as the Caped Crusader's enabler, politely urging him to stay the course.)
These are good and necessary things to ponder, yet they're nearly lost in the cross-cutting clutter. You come away impressed, oppressed, provoked, and beaten down, holding on to Ledger's squirrelly incandescence as a beacon in the darkness.
So: Is the performance on a par with "Brokeback Mountain"? In its interiority - in the sense that it springs from a mysterious engine at the actor's core - yes. Is it Oscar worthy? Sure, if that's how you measure these things. In the end, though, the achievement's more than that, or harder. It makes you mourn a gifted man's stupid death with fresh and vigorous sorrow.


Our comic-book-movie culture is 30 years old (it kicked off in 1978, with the Christopher Reeve  Superman  ), and in those three decades of speed and light and destruction, of well-coiffed demigods in bodysuits zipping through the air and shimmying up walls, comic-book films  have yielded more than their share of spectacle and thrills yet virtually nothing in the way of mystery . But in The Dark Knight  , Christopher Nolan 's ominously labyrinthine and exciting sequel to Batman Begins  , good and evil aren't just separate forces  at times, they're a whisper away from each other  and the movie exudes a predatory glamour that makes the comic-book films that have come before it look all the more like kid stuff. The Dark Knight  is jammed with thorny underworld conspiracies, obscenely oversize tank-cars, and action scenes that teeter madly out of control, all blanketed by the psycho-anarchic musings of a villain so warped he turns crime into a contest of Can you top this?  At two hours and 32 minutes, this is almost too much movie, but it has a malicious, careening zest all its own. It's a ride for the gut and  the brain.
Batman  (Christian Bale ), that snake-hiss-voiced vigilante who plays out the vengeful fantasies that Bruce Wayne can only dream about, has now gone a good way toward cleaning up Gotham City; he has even inspired copycat Batmans. Then why so serious? Our hero is regularly referred to as ''the Batman'' (a phrase lifted from Frank Miller 's graphic novel ), with that the  suggesting he's less a superhero than a sinister urban creature  just one among many. The woman Bruce loves, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal ), has been driven away by his moonlight escapades; she's now the squeeze of the lantern-jawed, shining-knight DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart ). What's more, thanks to Batman's crime-fighting spree  which the honorable lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman ) winks at under the table  a void has opened up. Into that space steps the Joker  (Heath Ledger ), a sick puppy in smeary clown makeup who wants to make the world feel his pain.
Bale, all steely reserve, once again captivates as the haunted caped crusader who must shed morality to beat the devil at his game. But just as Tim Burton 's 1989 Batman   was anchored by the joy-buzzer glee of Jack Nicholson 's party-down Joker, The Dark Knight  takes its cue from its  Joker and his deadly circus of chaos. Heath Ledger's mesmerizing, scary-funny performance begins with the creepiness of his image: the greasy long hair, the makeup that looks as if he'd drawn it on with crayons, then messed it with tears. That ghostly rotting paint job covers his scarred smile (explained by a backstory that gives you the willies, even if he just made it up), and the disturbing thing is that when Ledger's Joker talks, with those ''Ehhh, what's up, Doc?'' vowels that make him sound like Al Franken  crossed with a nerdish pedophile, you realize that the icky sloshing sound you hear is him sucking on his cheeks; he uses his attachment to those scars to fuel his sadistic (and masochistic) whims. This Joker may be a torture freak, but he also has a lost quality, a melancholy hidden within those black-circled eyes. He turns slaughter into a punchline; he's a homicidal comedian with an audience of one  himself. In this, the last performance he completed before his death , Ledger had a maniacal gusto inspired enough to suggest that he might have lived to be as audacious an actor as Marlon Brando, and maybe as great.
The Joker organizes the riffraff mobsters of Gotham City, but only to use them as bait, creating a whirlpool of corruption that sucks everyone down. He's an improv maniac, with no grand plan; his ultimate joke is to show that nobility won't hold in a world of disorder. At moments, the film's center doesn't hold. The deranged twist of what happens to Harvey Dent, for instance, seems at once too much and not enough. Mostly, though, that's because the movie didn't need it. Bale's seething, demon-saint Batman, locked in his dance of death with the Joker (''You complete me!'' says the villain, and for once he isn't kidding), is already an indelible figure of good battling it out with the darkness, right there in his own heart.

 Dark as night and nearly as long, Christopher Nolan’s new Batman movie feels like a beginning and something of an end. Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind — including “Batman Begins,” Mr. Nolan’s 2005 pleasurably moody resurrection of the series — largely by embracing an ambivalence that at first glance might be mistaken for pessimism. But no work filled with such thrilling moments of pure cinema can be rightly branded pessimistic, even a postheroic superhero movie like “The Dark Knight.”  Apparently, truth, justice and the American way don’t cut it anymore. That may not fully explain why the last Superman took a nose dive (“Superman Returns,” if not for long), but I think it helps get at why, like other recent ambiguous American heroes, both supermen and super-spies, the new Batman soared. Talent played a considerable part in Mr. Nolan’s Bat restoration, naturally, as did his seriousness of purpose. He brought a gravitas to the superhero that wiped away the camp and kitsch that had shrouded Batman in cobwebs. It helped that Christian Bale, a reluctant smiler whose sharply planed face looks as if it had been carved with a chisel, slid into Bruce Wayne’s insouciance as easily as he did Batman’s suit.  The new Batman movie isn’t a radical overhaul like its predecessor, which is to be expected of a film with a large price tag (well north of $100 million) and major studio expectations (worldwide domination or bust). Instead, like other filmmakers who’ve successfully reworked genre staples, Mr. Nolan has found a way to make Batman relevant to his time — meaning, to ours — investing him with shadows that remind you of the character’s troubled beginning but without lingering mustiness. That’s nothing new, but what is surprising, actually startling, is that in “The Dark Knight,” which picks up the story after the first film ends, Mr. Nolan has turned Batman (again played by the sturdy, stoic Mr. Bale) into a villain’s sidekick.  That would be the Joker, of course, a demonic creation and three-ring circus of one wholly inhabited by Heath Ledger. Mr. Ledger died in January at age 28 from an accidental overdose, after principal photography ended, and his death might have cast a paralyzing pall over the film if the performance were not so alive. But his Joker is a creature of such ghastly life, and the performance is so visceral, creepy and insistently present that the characterization pulls you in almost at once. When the Joker enters one fray with a murderous flourish and that sawed-off smile, his morbid grin a mirror of the Black Dahlia’s ear-to-ear grimace, your nervous laughter will die in your throat.  A self-described agent of chaos, the Joker arrives in Gotham abruptly, as if he’d been hiding up someone’s sleeve. He quickly seizes control of the city’s crime syndicate and Batman’s attention with no rhyme and less reason. Mr. Ledger, his body tightly wound but limbs jangling, all but disappears under the character’s white mask and red leer. Licking and chewing his sloppy, smeared lips, his tongue darting in and out of his mouth like a jittery animal, he turns the Joker into a tease who taunts criminals (Eric Roberts’s bad guy, among them) and the police (Gary Oldman’s good cop), giggling while he-he-he (ha-ha-ha) tries to burn the world down. He isn’t fighting for anything or anyone. He isn’t a terrorist, just terrifying.  Mr. Nolan is playing with fire here, but partly because he’s a showman. Even before the Joker goes wild, the director lets loose with some comic horror that owes something to Michael Mann’s “Heat,” something to Cirque de Soleil, and quickly sets a tense, coiled mood that he sustains for two fast-moving hours of freakish mischief, vigilante justice, philosophical asides and the usual trinkets and toys, before a final half-hour pileup of gunfire and explosions. This big-bang finish — which includes a topsy-turvy image that poignantly suggests the world has been turned on its axis for good — is sloppy, at times visually incoherent, yet touching. Mr. Nolan, you learn, likes to linger in the dark, but he doesn’t want to live there.  Though entranced by the Joker, Mr. Nolan, working from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan Nolan, does make room for romance and tears and even an occasional (nonlethal) joke. There are several new characters, notably Harvey Dent (a charismatic Aaron Eckhart), a crusading district attorney and Bruce Wayne’s rival for the affection of his longtime friend, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a happy improvement over Katie Holmes). Like almost every other character in the film, Batman and Bruce included, Harvey and Rachel live and work in (literal) glass houses. The Gotham they inhabit is shinier and brighter than the antiqued dystopia of “Batman Begins”: theirs is the emblematic modern megalopolis (in truth, a cleverly disguised Chicago), soulless, anonymous, a city of distorting and shattering mirrors.  From certain angles, the city the Joker threatens looks like New York, but it would be reductive to read the film too directly through the prism of 9/11 and its aftermath. You may flash on that day when a building collapses here in a cloud of dust, or when firemen douse some flames, but those resemblances belong more rightly to our memories than to what we see unfolding on screen. Like any number of small- and big-screen thrillers, the film’s engagement with 9/11 is diffuse, more a matter of inference and ideas (chaos, fear, death) than of direct assertion. Still, that a spectacle like this even glances in that direction confirms  that American movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes — or maybe just superness.  In and out of his black carapace and on the restless move, Batman remains, perhaps not surprisingly then, a recessive, almost elusive figure. Part of this has to do with the costume, which has created complications for every actor who wears it. With his eyes dimmed and voice technologically obscured, Mr. Bale, who’s suited up from the start, doesn’t have access to an actor’s most expressive tools. (There are only so many ways to eyeball an enemy.) Mr. Nolan, having already told Batman’s origin story in the first film, initially doesn’t appear motivated to advance the character. Yet by giving him rivals in love and war, he has also shifted Batman’s demons from inside his head to the outside world.  That change in emphasis leaches the melodrama from Mr. Nolan’s original conception, but it gives the story tension and interest beyond one man’s personal struggle. This is a darker Batman, less obviously human, more strangely other. When he perches over Gotham on the edge of a skyscraper roof, he looks more like a gargoyle than a savior. There’s a touch of demon in his stealthy menace. During a crucial scene, one of the film’s saner characters asserts that this isn’t a time for heroes, the implication being that the moment belongs to villains and madmen. Which is why, when Batman takes flight in this film, his wings stretching across the sky like webbed hands, it’s as if he were trying to possess the world as much as save it.  In its grim intensity, “The Dark Knight” can feel closer to David Fincher’s “Zodiac” than Tim Burton’s playfully gothic “Batman,” which means it’s also closer to Bob Kane’s original comic and Frank Miller’s 1986 reinterpretation. That makes it heavy, at times almost pop-Wagnerian, but Mr. Ledger’s performance and the film’s visual beauty are transporting. (In Imax, it’s even more operatic.) No matter how cynical you feel about Hollywood, it is hard not to fall for a film that makes room for a shot of the Joker leaning out the window of a stolen police car and laughing into the wind, the city’s colored lights gleaming behind him like jewels. He’s just a clown in black velvet, but he’s also some kind of masterpiece.  “The Dark Knight” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Consistently violent but not bloody.

Having memorably explored the Caped Crusader�s origins in �Batman Begins,� director Christopher Nolan puts all of Gotham City under a microscope in �The Dark Knight,� the enthralling second installment of his bold, bracing and altogether heroic reinvention of the iconic franchise. An ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity, this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some. That should also hold true at the box office, with Heath Ledger�s justly anticipated turn as the Joker adding to the must-see excitement surrounding the Warner Bros. release.
With the Bruce Wayne/Batman backstory firmly established, �The Dark Knight� fans out to take a broader perspective on Gotham City -- portrayed as a seething cauldron of interlocking power structures and criminal factions in the densely layered but remarkably fleet screenplay by helmer Nolan and brother Jonathan (stepping in for �Batman Begins�� David S. Goyer, who gets a story credit).
Using five strongly developed characters to anchor a drama with life-or-death implications for the entire metropolis, the Nolans have taken Bob Kane�s comicbook template and crafted an anguished, eloquent meditation on ideas of justice and power, corruption and anarchy and, of course, the need for heroes like Batman -- a question never in doubt for the viewer, but one posed rather often by the citizens of Gotham.
Indeed, with trusty Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, superbly restrained) and golden-boy District Attorney Harvey Dent (a cocksure Aaron Eckhart) successfully spearheading the city�s crackdown on the mob, even Wayne himself (Christian Bale) figures his nights moonlighting as a leather-clad vigilante are numbered. The young billionaire hopes to hang up the Batsuit for good and renew his relationship with assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, an immediate improvement over Katie Holmes), who has taken up with Dent in the meantime.
But Batman�s stature as a radical symbol of good has invited a more sinister criminal presence to Gotham City -- and, as seen in the crackerjack bank-robbery sequence that opens the pic, one who operates in terrifyingly unpredictable ways. Utterly indifferent to simple criminal motivations like greed, Ledger�s maniacally murderous Joker is as pure an embodiment of irrational evil as any in modern movies. He�s a pitiless psychopath who revels in chaos and fears neither pain nor death, a demonic prankster for whom all the world�s a punchline.
After Ledger�s death in January, his penultimate performance (with Terry Gilliam�s �The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus� still to come) will be viewed with both tremendous excitement and unavoidable sadness. It�s a tribute to Ledger�s indelible work that he makes the viewer entirely forget the actor behind the cracked white makeup and blood-red rictus grin, so complete and frightening is his immersion in the role. With all due respect to the enjoyable camp buffoonery of past Jokers like Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Ledger makes them look like -- well, clowns.
The pic shrewdly positions the Joker as the superhero-movie equivalent of a modern terrorist (one of several post-9/11 signifiers), who threatens to target Gotham civilians until Batman reveals his identity. Batman, Gordon and Dent uneasily join forces, but the Joker seems to have the upper hand at every step, even from a jail cell; the city, turning against the hero it once looked to for hope, seems more fractious, vulnerable and dangerous than ever.
Though more linear than �Memento� and �The Prestige� (both also co-scripted by the Nolans), �The Dark Knight� pivots with similar ingenuity on a breathless series of twists and turns, culminating in a dramatic shift for Dent. This subplot reps the film�s weakest link, packing too much psychological motivation into too little screen time to be entirely credible. Yet Eckhart vividly inhabits the character�s sad trajectory, underscoring the film�s point that symbols of good can be all too easily tarnished.
From Wayne�s playful debates with faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine) about the public perception of Batman to the Joker�s borderline-poetic musings on his own bottomless sadism, the characters almost seem to be carrying on a debate about the complicated realities of good vs. evil, and the heavy burden shouldered by those fighting for good. One of the few action filmmakers who�s capable of satisfying audiences beyond the fanboy set, Nolan honors his serious themes to the end; he bravely closes the story with both Gotham City and the narrative in tatters, making this the rare sequel that genuinely deserves another.
Viewers who found �Batman Begins� too existentially weighty for its own good will be refreshed to know that �The Dark Knight� hits the ground running and rarely lets up over its swift 2�-hour running time. Nolan directs the action more confidently than he did the first time out, orchestrating all manner of vertiginous mid-air escapes and virtuosic highway setpieces (and unleashing Batman�s latest ooh-ah contraption, the monster-truck-tire-equipped Bat-Pod). In a fresh innovation, six sequences were shot using Imax cameras, and will presumably look smashing in the giant-screen format (pic was reviewed from a 35mm print).
Though not as obsessively detailed as �Batman Begins,� �The Dark Knight� shares with that film a robust physicality and a commitment to taking violence seriously; a brief shot of bruises and scrapes on Bale�s torso conveys as much impact as any of the film�s brutal confrontations. Bale himself is less central figure than ensemble player, but the commandingly charismatic thesp continues to put his definitive stamp on the role, and also has devilish fun playing up Wayne�s playboy persona.
Tech work is at the first entry�s high standard, with many artists reprising their contributions here -- from Nathan Crowley�s imposing production design, shown to flattering effect in Wally Pfister�s gleaming widescreen compositions, to the propulsively moody score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Perhaps most impressive is Lee Smith�s editing, confidently handling multiple lines of action and cutting for maximum impact.
Exteriors were lensed in Chicago aside from an early, plot-necessitated detour to Hong Kong, which marks the first time in a Batman film that the title character has left Gotham City.


What a brooding pleasure it is to return to Christopher Nolan 's Gotham City—if "pleasure" is the right word for a movie that gazes so deeply and sometimes despairingly into the souls of restless men. In The Dark Knight , the continuation of Nolan's superb 2005 reboot of the Batman franchise, Batman Begins , fair Gotham is a modestly cleaner, better-lit place than it was when last we saw it, if still a far stretch from the shining city on a hill its winged protector believes it can be.
A superhero movie of unusual psychological complexity, Batman Begins  was, in the tradition of all such origin stories, about a heretofore-ordinary man coming into a heightened sense of his super-ego. But Nolan, who has one of the great procedural minds among contemporary filmmakers, was hardly content to offer up the death of a young boy's parents as a tidy Freudian backstory for what turns a Bruce Wayne  into a Batman. Instead, Nolan's Batman (played with iron-jawed intensity by Christian Bale ) was the product of many wayward years in the wilderness followed by still more years of rigorous training at the hands of a Svengali-like master, Ra's Al Ghul . Only then, quite late in the day (and the running time), was young Wayne ready to become Batman. At which point, in a twist that now seems perhaps a touch too Shakespearean (by way of George Lucas ), the pupil found himself forced to use the master's teachings against the master himself.
In The Dark Knight , nothing is nearly so cut-and-dried. Whereas the radicalized Ra's, with his arsenal of dirty bombs and his urge to eradicate Western "decadence," was a supervillain of the sort that anyone who reads the papers has been conditioned to expect, the Joker of The Dark Knight  is all the more terrifying for not having a plan or an identifiable motive. A committed anarchist in a dusting of floury foundation, a smear of crimson lipstick, and pools of Louise Brooks  eye shadow, this Joker isn't the ebullient prankster of Batman movies (and TV shows) past, but rather a freakishly disturbing embodiment of those destructive human impulses that can't so easily be explained away. His only rule is to show others the folly of rules, the absurdity of striving to impose order upon chaos. "Some men just want to watch the world burn," observes the ever-wise butler Alfred (Michael Caine ). Except that this Joker doesn't merely want to watch; he wants to strike the match.
By now, of course, you know that the Joker is played by Heath Ledger  in the last role he completed before his death, this past January, at the age of 28. And it is perhaps the best compliment one can pay to this gifted young actor to say that his performance here would have cemented his legend even if he'd lived to see the film's release. The Joker enters into The Dark Knight  gradually, at first a tangential figure in a not particularly interesting Mafia money-laundering subplot. But even then, Ledger seems to make the film grow larger whenever he's onscreen (no matter if you happen to already be watching it in the giant-screen IMAX  format). Having shown a penchant for the chameleonic as the sensitive, soft- spoken cowpoke of Brokeback Mountain  and the terminally good-vibrating surf-shop owner of Lords of Dogtown , Ledger here again invests in a character from the inside-out, lending the Joker's every physical tick and vocal inflection a signature flair.
No wonder Ledger was reportedly exhausted after finishing work on the film; watching him, you can see how demanding he was on himself, how much he refused to play any predictable beats, whether the Joker is casually advising a room of armed thugs to not "blow things out of proportion" while outfitted in the latest in suicide-bomber haute couture, or slicking his hair back with his hands and sashaying across the dance floor to greet the comely assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes  (Maggie Gyllenhaal , less milquetoast than Katie Holmes ). But the genius of the performance is how fully Ledger convinces us that the Joker is capable of doing anything at any moment—even, if the occasion calls for it, to stop being the Joker.
In making the transition from low-budget independent films to studio tentpole projects, Nolan (who co- authored The  Dark Knight  with his brother, Jonathan), has sacrificed none of his abiding obsessions. Like the amnesiac amateur detective who occupied the central role in Nolan's Möbius-strip sophomore feature, Memento , the Bruce Wayne of Dark Knight  is increasingly gripped by an existential crisis, wondering whether he is the hero or the villain of his own story. And like the rival illusionists of Nolan's 2006 film The Prestige , the longer Batman and the Joker engage in their battle of wills—the one confident in the inherent goodness of mankind, the other equally certain that man is but a savage beast—the more the distance collapses between them. Triangulating their position is D.A. Harvey Dent  (played with gleaming, Kennedy-esque righteousness by Aaron Eckhart ).
That makes The Dark Knight  sound like heavy stuff—and it is. But I should add that Nolan also delivers the kick-ass goods, from an opening bank heist à la Michael Mann  to a climactic episode of vehicular mayhem à la William Friedkin . So The Dark Knight  will give your adrenal glands their desired workout, but it will occupy your mind, too, and even lead it down some dim alleyways where most Hollywood  movies fear to tread. By the end of this second installment in that rare franchise one hopes won't end anytime soon, Batman seems to have less in common with his superhero brethren than with those old frontiersmen of movies past. Like The Searchers ' Ethan Edwards  and High Noon 's Will Kane, he's left to ride off into the darkness, pondering the uncertain destiny of principled men in an unprincipled world—as are we.
