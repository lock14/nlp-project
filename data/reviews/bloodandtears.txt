 Any attempt to elucidate the most vitriolic turf dispute of our time in just 73 minutes may seem insanely ambitious, but Isidore Rosmarin, the documentary filmmaker and producer, was not deterred. In “Blood and Tears: The Arab-Israeli Conflict,” he methodically traces the battle from its biblical origins to the fragile present through the eyes of everyone from fundamentalist Muslims to committed Zionists.  Scenes of protest and bombing alternate uncomfortably with the measured tones of most of the interviewees. And while the diversity of informed opinion is laudable — for every militant voice there is a peacenik, for every Alan M. Dershowitz a Hamas leader — the cumulative effect is to play Ping-Pong with the thinking of any viewer whose sympathies are not already committed.  Only between the extremes of outrage and entitlement does the film fully capture our attention. As a Palestinian doctor works tirelessly with refugees and a heartbroken Jewish woman quietly rebuilds a life destroyed by a suicide bomber, this painstakingly nonpartisan documentary places its faith in the facts. “A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can’t accommodate two enemies,” the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, “Blood and Tears” is the proof.
A well-balanced primer on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Blood and Tears  takes just over an hour to go from the roots of Zionism to the recent electoral victory of Hamas . Workmanlike at best, with a regrettable tendency toward cheap filters and effects, the film's strength lies in its remarkable list of interviews. To name just a few: former Israeli prime ministers Shimon Peres , Benjamin Netanyahu , and Ehud Barak ; Palestinian politicians Saeb Erekat  and Sari Nusseibeh ; assassinated Hamas leader Abdel Azis al-Rantissi ; and controversial Middle East scholars Bernard Lewis  and Rashid Khalidi . Those aren't the kind of gets you'd expect from a doc that's barely made it past the university circuit. Still, most espouse the standard narratives. There is one remarkable moment, from the distinguished Israeli historian Michael Oren . Recounting an assault on a Hamas compound that left 23 Israeli soldiers dead, Oren says that given the choice between flattening the compound with a missile or sending his son door-to-doorhe'd send his son door-to-door.
