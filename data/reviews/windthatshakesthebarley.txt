There's a great scene in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley," Ken Loach's new drama about the Irish War of Independence , set in County Cork. It's 1920 and the British are still occupying Ireland, but practical matters , like small claims, still need tending . During one session, a local businessman complains to a makeshift court that a little old lady owes him money, including an obscenely high interest charge. The judge (a stern young woman) rules in the old lady's favor. But the young IRA volunteers, led by a fellow named Teddy (P�draic Delaney ), intervene.
It seems the businessman has been paying to keep the men armed, which would be hard for him to do from jail. When the magistrate hears of this, she summons Teddy back to her courtroom, and a philosophical debate ensues. What good is the law if it can't look out for the citizenry? How can the citizenry believe the law offers more important protection than guns? The IRA thinks the court is too principled for these bellicose times. The court thinks the army is rash to the point of being destructive.
Usually in Loach's movies -- including "Riff-Raff" (1990), "Land and Freedom" (1995), and "Carla's Song" (1996 ) -- this is the moment where the human action stops and the social-philosophy lesson begins. But in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley," this scene is
 the action. Loach and Paul Laverty , the deft politics-minded scribe who's written many of Loach's films, are showing us Ireland as it splits in half, foreshadowing the civil war to come.
Later on, Loach and Laverty give us another scene of inflamed discourse that's just as good. The film itself concerns a derailed freedom fight in which brother literally fights brother for the same cause: to rid Ireland of England.
Damien (Cillian Murphy ) is a young physician who has decided, rather than leave for London, to join the IRA. He fights in a tiny ragtag volunteer corps alongside his brother Teddy (early on, there are more hurling sticks than rifles). Together, they survive imprisonment, torture, and the threat of a firing squad. But after the Irish politician Michael Collins forges a treaty with Britain (cleverly represented here via newsreel at the local movie house) granting the country only partial economic independence, a wedge is driven between the two men.
Damien won't settle for anything less than complete independence. Teddy thinks the treaty is a necessary starting point, and he's willing to point a gun at anyone who believes otherwise. As a more seasoned volunteer named Dan (Liam Cunningham , who brings the movie a lot of wisdom) points out, "All we're changing if we ratify this treaty are the accents of the powerful and color of the flag." The movie focuses on the tragic human outcome of that disagreement.
Initially, "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" seems out simply to vilify the British occupiers. The Black and Tans are a hostile, murderous bunch. Eventually, though, they become a noxious background noise, and Ireland begins to fight with itself.
Loach's characteristic realism fades in and out . Often his best movies floor you with their illusion of fly-on-the-wall transparency. But "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" uses Damien and Teddy to limn a schematic, almost dialectical structure that crowds out the emotional immediacy in order to draw a dramatic conclusion that seems inevitable. In other words, the film starts to feel forced.
The approach worked for "Barley" at last year's Cannes Film Festival, where it won the top prize. But the historical scope of this story, as well as Loach's interest in absolute fairness, seems to have drained some of the life from its telling. This balanced take on the Irish divide replaces both the social outrage of his films about the politically oppressed and working-class as well as the rich character contours that can make his filmmaking so pointed.
What does come through is Loach's characteristic disdain for cheap romanticism and easy answers. "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" could have been an easy tribute to freedom fighters. But Loach and Laverty know history tends to make that kind of hope seem far-fetched, particularly since the violent factionalism they've dramatized still exists throughout the world.


         For director Ken Loach, the personal is always political, the political personal. The dean of British independent filmmakers, Loach has the gift of finding the intensely moving private emotions in broad, societal dilemmas. He does that with his fine new film, "The Wind That Shakes the  Barley," and he does a few new things as well.
 
 "Barley" is the only one of Loach's works to receive Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or. It is also one of the first to utilize a recognizable international star: Cillian Murphy, memorable as the evil Scarecrow in "Batman Begins." And it is only the second of Loach's 19 films (after "Land and Freedom") to be set in a politically charged past rather than a socially committed present.
 


         






   Named after a poem that favored Irish independence from Britain, "Barley" takes place in Ireland in the early 1920s, a time that remains so controversial that some British newspapers savagely attacked Loach's film, even going so far as  to compare the director to Third Reich glorifier Leni Riefenstahl.
 
 But  "Barley" starts quietly, with an afternoon game of hurling on land near Cork belonging to Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald) and her family. Among the players are Damien (Murphy), set to begin a medical residency in London in a few days, and his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney).
 
 Suddenly, the afternoon explodes as a platoon of gun-toting Black and Tans appears. They're thuggish British troops determined to humiliate and demean the Irish for daring to gather for any purpose at all. Things violently spiral out of control, as they do again when Damien attempts to take his train to London, and as a result the young man decides to stay and join the clandestine Irish Republican Army in its dedication to gaining Irish independence by any means necessary.
 
 It is these sequences, as well as a brief but intense scene of British torture, that has led to the criticisms of "Barley." Though Loach makes no apologies for either, the fact that stories of colonizers acting badly are not exactly new is something the film has to overcome.
 
 But "The Wind That Shakes the  Barley" turns out to be a more complicated, more dramatically potent story than it appears at first. It's concerned at its core not with how bad the British were but with what the cost of dealing with them was for the Irish..
 
 Damien, for instance, is as unabashedly pro-independence as anyone, someone who mockingly asks a British officer, "What should I do, turn the other cheek for the next 700 years?" But the boast of an Irish leader — "If they bring their savagery over here, we will meet it with a savagery of our own" — soon threatens to turn to ashes as people realize what they are being called on to do.
 
 Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training.
 
  When he says, at one particularly potent junction, "I hope this Ireland we're fighting for is worth it," it's an especially moving moment of doubt.
 
 For once the Irish get a measure of success, their troubles do the opposite of going away. This is especially true after the truce of 1922, when the rebels face an agonizing choice: Do  they accept partial independence as a British dominion along with the loss of Northern Ireland or do they continue to fight, likely hopelessly, for a complete independence that would lead to a more egalitarian society?
 
 As written by Loach's frequent collaborator Paul Laverty, the discussions around these points are compelling, and the air in the rooms is electric. Both sides have strongly thought-out points of view, the film tips its hand neither one way nor the other, and, given that the consequences of the actions taken have lasted until today, it's all a rather thrilling situation.
 
 "If a group is united against oppression, when the oppressor goes, all the splits and divisions emerge," Loach explained at Cannes. "If you were alive at that time, it must have been an agonizing choice. There were no good people or bad people; all responses to the situation have a logic — that's the terrible dilemma." And the source of wonderful drama as well.

Nothing cranks up the juice of a revolutionary war film quite like a bit of good old-fashioned cruelty. The Wind That Shakes the Barley  is set in County Cork in the early '20s, when the Irish struggle against British rule had reached a critical flash point, and the movie doesn't stint on episodes of indignityinducing, squirm-in-your-seat sadism. We meet the British police, known (perversely) as the Royal Irish Constabulary, when one of its feared Black and Tan squads forces a group of Irish lads to strip and spit out their names. A single unnecessary syllable, especially if it's spoken in Gaelic, is quite enough to set off the soldiers' hair-trigger tempers, and this establishes the film's tone: The English here aren't just repressive occupiers  they are bullies, which is far less forgivable.
It's the humiliation of British rule, the grotesque personal  dimension of it, that inspires Damien (Cillian Murphy), a soft, pensive, rather winsome soul who plans to go to London to study medicine, to leave his ambition behind and join his defiant brother, Teddy (Pádraic Delaney), and other local rebels in what will evolve into the Irish Republican Army. Tossed into jail, Teddy refuses to crack under questioning, and as a result he gets his fingernails torn out, one by one. You watch the scene in horror and awe, agonized by the pain, galvanized by Teddy's ability to withstand it.
The director, Ken Loach, is known for movies like Raining Stones   thick-brogued, quotidian English dramas of working-class life and oppression  (for Loach, the two often seem to be one and the same). In The Wind That Shakes the Barley , he fills the screen with gnashing outrage at the British lording it over the Irish. No doubt: Loach gives good righteous nobility. (That may be why his movie took the Palme d'Or at Cannes.) He paints the film in dark, rain-on-the-emerald-moor colors, and he provides fascinating details of how the Irish guerrilla struggle developed, with the rebels filching weapons, lashing out against tiny pockets of soldiers, steeling themselves to commit  a shotgun execution  of a British landlord, or of anyone in their own ranks who betrays the cause.
The ferocity of Loach's moral wrath carries the movie, makes it ignite on screen  at least, until he tries to dramatize the fatal split of Ireland through Damien and Teddy, the brothers in arms. In December 1921, when the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed, giving Ireland dominion status within the British Commonwealth, it's Damien, the placid purist, who says that the revolutionary struggle must continue, while Teddy, so militant in the face of torture, turns around and pleads for a laying down of arms. If Loach had given full voice to each side of this division, he could have made a great film  maybe the  great film  about the Irish struggle. But in The Wind That Shakes the Barley , Loach can barely summon half a heart for Teddy's position. A movie that presents itself, ultimately, as a tragic portrait of a divided nation fails to explore the deepest reason for that fissure: the Irish who longed to stop fighting because they no longer saw the honor in it.

 In Ken Loach’s movies — he has made more than 20 in the last 40 years — characters frequently argue about politics, which is only fitting, since the films themselves are political arguments. There is no point in combing through Mr. Loach’s work for hints of ideological significance. Ideology — Marxist, anti-imperialist, aligned with the perceived interests of the powerless and the marginal — is the engine that drives his stories. The clarity and force of those stories is considerable, but their bluntness sometimes sticks in the craw of critics, who often scold Mr. Loach for lacking subtlety.  But in watching “The Wind That Shakes the Barley,” his new film (which won the top prize at Cannes last year), it is possible to appreciate both Mr. Loach’s passion and his sense of nuance. Set in Ireland in the 1920s, the film paints history in stark colors and observes  as they blur and bleed. Mr. Loach and Paul Laverty, the gifted screenwriter with whom he regularly collaborates, leave no doubt as to who the villains are in this tale.  From the start, when they raid an Irish farm, the British irregulars known as the Black and Tans are as brutal and sadistic as Hollywood Nazis. The atrocities they commit have an immediate radicalizing effect on the film’s hero, Damien (Cillian Murphy), who abandons his plans to study medicine in London to join the armed uprising against the British.  Injustice, in Mr. Loach’s world, tends to be a simple matter. It resides in the unprincipled, dehumanizing exercise of power — whether wielded by capital, the state, or an army of occupation — against those who have none. The complications arise, and the arguments start, when the powerless try to fight back.  Brutal as “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” is in depicting British acts of violence, it does not flinch from showing the harsh, sometimes heartless tactics of the Irish Republican Army flying columns. Among the most painful scenes are the executions of an informer and later a landlord, killings that foreshadow a turn from insurrection to civil war.  Radical though he is, Mr. Loach is hardly a romantic, and the deep humanism that informs his best work — a category in which “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” surely belongs — is insulated from sentimentality by the sense that history is a long, bruising fight, a chronicle of compromise and defeat as well as of tentative triumph and provisional hope. He is also, as anyone steeped in the history of the modern left must be, acquainted with the factionalism and disunity that bedevils those who see themselves on the side of the angels.  “Land and Freedom” (1995) examined this theme in the context of the Spanish Civil War, in which anarchists and communists at times fought each other as fiercely as they fought Franco. The logic of rebellion in “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” has a similarly grim implacability. You start out fighting an obvious, odious enemy, and you will end up killing your friends.  It’s an old story perhaps, but Mr. Loach and Mr. Laverty tell it with enthralling — and devastating — economy and force. Beauty too. Mr. Loach and his cinematographer, Barry Ackroyd, use the grays and greens of the cloud-cloaked Irish countryside as a moody palette. Sometimes the human figures stand out in bold relief against the flat sky; at other moments they are wrapped in fog and smoke.  Mr. Loach has always populated his films with superb actors (his knack for discovering them is uncanny), and the quality of the performances he elicits serves as a check against his more schematic polemical impulses. Mr. Murphy, fine-boned and ferocious, gives Damien a gentleness and sensitivity that shades toward fanaticism. He is a purist, an idealist, and therefore marked for a tragic destiny, either as monster or martyr.  His performance is perfectly complemented by that of Padraic Delaney, who plays Damien’s brother Teddy, a brave soldier but also a fatefully pragmatic politician. Between them is the marvelous Orla Fitzgerald as Sinead, a perfectly believable incarnation of an indomitable Irish woman.  In 1921, after several years of fierce fighting, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State, an event that split the Republican movement and unleashed a period of factional bloodletting, the Irish Civil War. The consequences of this strife propel “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” through its terrible final act, which is all the more chilling for being dramatized with such precision. Afterward it comes almost as a shock to recall that the Republic of Ireland today is a prosperous member of the European Union, and that even the Northern Ireland seems to have moved beyond sectarian violence.  But the history presented in “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” hardly feels like a closed book or a museum display. It is as alive and as troubling as anything on the evening news,  though  far more thoughtful and beautiful.
Two Irish brothers are torn apart by the anti-Brit rebellion of the '20s in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley," a studiously sincere film by veteran helmer Ken Loach and scripter Paul Laverty in which the human drama increasingly gets lost in the political. Though tastily lensed by ace d.p. Barry Ackroyd and with a convincing cast led by Cillian Murphy, essentially small-scale pic lacks the involving sweep of Loach's earlier historical-political yarn, "Land and Freedom," and looks likely to reap only modest returns in general arenas.
Young doctor Damien O'Donovan (Murphy) is about to leave Ireland to work at a London hospital. During a game of hurling (a sport akin to hockey) with his pals, he gets some mild ribbing about working for the Brits.
Things suddenly turn darker when Damien visits a farm owned by the venerable Peggy (Mary Riordan) to say his goodbyes. A bunch of Black & Tans (British "peacekeeping" troops) turn up and announce that all public meetings, including games, are banned. During hostile questioning, Peggy's grandson, Micheail (Laurence Barry), who doesn't speak English, is taken into the barn and beaten to death.
From the one-dimensional way in which the thuggish Black and Tans are portrayed, it's pretty clear Loach and Laverty also have in mind a much more contemporary example of a foreign power sending in troops to a less-developed country and brutalizing its recalcitrant inhabitants. As Damien is finally convinced to stay and fight, pic looks like it will develop into a smart parallel between waning British imperialism of the last century and U.S. foreign policy of the present.
To the delight of his friends, and especially his activist brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), Damien signs up with the Irish Republican Army. Operating in small guerrilla groups, they steal weapons from a police barracks and -- in a brief but effectively brutal sequence in a bar -- gun down some British officers.
With its sudden, almost casual violence, which doesn't linger over the bloody details, there's an impressive intensity to these opening reels. With occasional assist from George Fenton's score, the picture moves forward even while the viewer is still trying to work out the exact relationships between the main characters.
As the Brits round up prisoners in reprisal, Teddy's guerrilla group is caught and Teddy himself horrifically tortured. Saved at the last moment from execution, Damien, Teddy & Co. head for the hills. But their early idealism is soon complicated by political events between London and Dublin.
Following the Anglo-Irish Peace Agreement, which formed the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Empire, the brothers find themselves pitted against each other, with Teddy supporting the Free Staters (as a practical solution to the independence struggle) but Damien still pursuing the IRA's dream of a totally independent Ireland.
During this second hour, the movie moves away from contempo parallels and starts to take on water. Long dialogue meticulously discusses the issues as scripter Laverty tries to play fair to all sides while remaining true to the complex train of political events.
"Land and Freedom" also suffered from similar jaw-jawing but leavened its lecturing with highly cinematic action sequences. "Barley" is painted on a much smaller canvas, with tiny guerrilla actions and a small central cast. But the characters get lost in the plot-heavy second half. The ending should be far more emotionally powerful than it is.
As the initially apolitical doctor who becomes an uncompromising patriot, the gleaming-eyed Murphy holds the screen and is well supported by Delaney as the initially idealistic but increasingly pragmatic Teddy. Gaining in stature as pic progresses, Liam Cunningham adds mature heft as train driver turned activist Dan, who gets many of the script's best speeches. Rest of the cast, including Orla Fitzgerald as Damien's token love interest, don't get much chance to register.
Ackroyd's textured photography, stressing natural light and awash with greens and browns, convincingly conjures up a period prior to electric light. Production design and costuming look equally natural. Pic's title comes from a traditional ditty heard near the start, about "foreign chains that bind us."

The young men move about the muddied hillside engaging in a friendly afternoon game of hurling. On their way home, they are accosted by a platoon of "Black and Tans," the occupying soldiers sent from England to stamp out the crackling embers of Irish independence. The place is County Cork , circa 1920, six years after the Defence of the Realm Act banned "public meetings" deemed threatening to British national security. The soldiers demand the young men's names, and when one refuses to say his in English instead of Gaelic, he pays with his life.
This bone-chilling opening sets the tone for what follows in Ken Loach 's The Wind That Shakes the Barley , which traces the Irish independence movement from the dawn of IRA guerrilla attacks in the summer of 1920 through to the controversial December, 1921 signing of the Anglo-Irish peace treaty (which granted Ireland  significant freedom while keeping it as a dominion of the British Empire). That senseless act of violence is also the moment at which a medical student named Damien (Cillian Murphy ) resolves to forgo his London internship to stay behind and fight in what he believes is a just battle. In short order, the lads we witnessed playing sports under the film's opening titles are being trained in tactics of stealth and marksmanship on those very same hillsides.
Like Jean-Pierre Melville 's recently rediscovered Army of Shadows , The Wind That Shakes the Barley  possesses the soul of an anti-war movie and the style of a thriller, with charcoal figures moving hurriedly against a darkened landscape periodically illuminated by bursts of gunfire.
Though it spans just over a year of actual history, Loach's film implicitly casts one eye back to the failed Irish Republican Brotherhood uprising of 1916 and the other forward to the seven decades of bloodshed that would yet fall upon Irish soil before the arrival of something approximating peace. And contrary to the grousing of some British critics, the movie neither amounts to a flag-waving valentine for revolutionary politics nor a knee-jerk condemnation of imperialist empires. It is, rather, a profound consideration of the fog of wars that rage not only between nations but within.
Indeed, it is hardly by accident that the film (written by frequent Loach collaborator Paul Laverty ) speaks about the seeds of terrorism, about centrism at odds with extremism, and about political interests placed ahead of human ones at a time when such matters continue to weigh heavily upon the global dinner table. Or, as Loach himself noted when collecting the Palme d'Or for best film at last year's Cannes Film Festival : "Maybe if we tell the truth about the past, we tell the truth about the present."
