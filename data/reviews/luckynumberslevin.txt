This fun but ultimately disappointing mistaken-identity thriller has style galore, which may actually be the crux of its problem. A clever script by Jason Smilovic and a terrific cast keep this vehicle moving at a quick pace that remains a step ahead of the viewer all the way through to its final kicker at the end. It all adds up, but you may feel yourself snookered by the old Kansas City Shuffle, a criminal maneuver designed to distract attention that�s explained at the beginning of the film by Mr. Goodkat (Willis), a hitman shown to be working both sides of the fence. Everything about Lucky Number Slevin
, especially the production design, is calculated to keep us unbalanced, from the loudly patterned wallpapers and flooring designs to the argyle sweater worn by Slevin (Hartnett) � who, in another move to perhaps keep us off-guard, wears nothing but a towel throughout a major chunk of the film. The script brings up references to Hitchcock�s North by Northwest
 and James Bond films, and even the casting of Willis and Liu, who have been strongly associated with previous Tarantino films, contributes to this film�s active overstatement of the company it wishes to keep. Still, the script is deft and abetted by some terrific dialogue. The film reunites Hartnett with director McGuigan (Acid House)
, with whom he made Wicker Park
. As the man mistaken for another, Hartnett as Slevin is full of smart-alecky comebacks, an attitude that seems to make him the equal of the heavyweight actors the character confronts. In an almost comic-book fashion, Freeman and Kingsley play rival crime kingpins � the Boss and the Rabbi � who live in New York City penthouses directly across from each other. Each actor sinks into his outlandish role (and set design), and the result is definitely colorful, although a tad hammy. (Sorry, Rabbi.) Liu, however, gets to try something different here, as the plucky girl next door who plays amateur sleuth and, for once, gets to do a big love scene. Danny Aiello and Robert Forster (another Tarantino association) also turn up in tiny roles that further serve to distract attention from the real business at hand. Lucky Number Slevin
 is a busy piece of work whose seductive convolutions get overshadowed by its overinsisting need to prove itself worthy.


If "Lucky Number Slevin" was as good as it is clever, we'd be talking four stars here. A hyperactive, style-crazed crime caper of revenge and mistaken identity, it operates in a slick little playground all its own. When the movie's over, you know you've seen something, but you may wonder what or, more important, why. It's like being fleeced by a con artist who's more interested in the scam than the score.
The con artist in question is Paul McGuigan, the Scottish director of "Gangster No. 1" and the stupid but hugely entertaining "Wicker Park." He's part of the gang of new British cutthroats that includes Guy Ritchie ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") and Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake"), filmmakers who deliver the old ultra-violence with Cool Britannia flair. Their movies can be nasty fun -- if almost entirely derivative of "Pulp Fiction" -- but they're always in danger of disappearing up their own hindquarters. "Lucky Number Slevin" is merely the first to go the distance.
After an opening sequence that dispatches a handful of thugs in glitteringly brutal fashion, the film settles down to tell the story of a young man named Slevin (Josh Hartnett) who arrives in New York to stay with a friend. The friend is missing, he owes a lot of money, and the gangsters who show up at the apartment assume Slevin's the man they're looking for. They drag him to a conference with the Boss (Morgan Freeman), who lives in baronial penthouse splendor directly across from his criminal rival the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).
Wow. So far, so good: Sir Ben and God in the same movie. Hartnett still looks like he was formed from the leftover parts of Tommy Lee Jones, but he tries to hold his weight in this company. As Slevin pits the two kingpins against each other, he puts up with abuse like a good noir hero -- he has his nose broken twice and spends the first third of the movie wearing a bath towel -- and Jason Smilovic's script lets him shoot off dry zingers in all directions. "I bet it was that mouth that got you that nose," says the Boss. True enough, but it's Hartnett's barely disguised smugness that makes the audience want to smack him after a while.
The most original thing about "Lucky Number Slevin" is that it lets Lucy Liu play a screwball heroine. About time, too. She's Lindsey, the free spirit next door, and her scenes with Hartnett are adorably overwritten arabesques of smart-girl banter. Her dialogue is too, too arch -- "If you're still alive after I get back from work, wanna go have dinner?" -- but the flicker of honest mischief in Liu's eyes is the only thing here that doesn't seem unbearably pleased with itself.
McGuigan piles on the absurdities and look-at-me filmmaking: Orthodox gangsters, triple-split screens, flashbacks and flash-forwards and flash-sidewayses. He and Smilovic indulge their love of old movies past the breaking point, and when Slevin and the Rabbi discourse on Eva Marie Saint in "North by Northwest," the scene could be subtitled "Inspired by the Collected Works of Quentin Tarantino." (That said, Kingsley makes the Rabbi's Talmudic ditherings extremely funny, especially in the early scenes.) Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci turn up in crucial supporting roles -- one as a hit man, the other as a Fed -- but even the plot twists regarding their characters feel overly familiar. If you put stale ingredients in a blender, the results don't taste any fresher.
Some will mistake the studied breeziness of "Lucky Number Slevin" for art or entertainment, or they just won't care -- McGuigan plays to the new callousness well. (So does Tarantino, but his sheer love of making movies pulls him through.) It's telling, though, that the slick, computer-enhanced production design never suggests the real world but rather the confines of a video game. "Slevin" mashes our buttons with verve, but the game's over long before the movie is.
.


         "Lucky Number Slevin" is an attempted cinematic sleight-of-hand that has its moments, but is finally just plain annoying, wearing its influences too broadly on its sleeve. It's the type of movie where nothing is as it appears, and even when it's all sorted out it's completely unsatisfying. Written by Jason Smilovic and directed by Paul McGuigan, it's all razzle and no dazzle.
 
 A diversionary confection along the lines of the far more treacherous "The Usual Suspects," the film stars Josh Hartnett as a seemingly unlucky guy called Slevin who, through a case of mistaken identity, finds himself in the middle of some dangerous characters.
 


         






   A litany of misfortune places Slevin in the apartment of his missing pal, Nick Fisher, who has accumulated large gambling debts to two warring gangsters, the Boss (Morgan Freeman) and the Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley). The mobsters' long-standing feud heats up with the murder of the Boss' son, which he attributes to the Rabbi. Each man separately sends a pair of henchmen to visit the delinquent Mr. Fisher and ends up nabbing Slevin. The Boss offers to forgive the debt if Slevin/Fisher kills the Rabbi's gay son. The Rabbi simply wants his 33 grand.
 
 Hovering around the story's perimeter is Bruce Willis' elite assassin Goodkat, who at the beginning of the movie spins a yarn about a fixed horse race that took place 25 years earlier and ultimately ties into the present-day situation.
 
  Pros like Willis, Freeman, Stanley Tucci as a grumpy cop, and Robert Forster in a cameo, make the sub-Quentin Tarantino dialogue fly at times, but it's mostly a flurry of non sequiturs and characters defining terms and names for one another ("What's a Kansas City Shuffle?" "A Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right and you go left  " "Why do they call him the Rabbi?" "Because he's a rabbi."). The presence of Tarantino veterans such as Willis, Forster and Lucy Liu — in an endearing but thankless turn as a perky neighbor who works as a coroner — only makes the comparison less flattering.
 
 There is a sense of screwball energy in the frisky exchanges between Slevin and Liu's character, Lindsey, but as with nearly everything else in the movie, it relies almost entirely on the actors to sell it.
 
  Hartnett makes the motormouth character and his propensity for getting socked in the nose likable enough, but at the same time, Slevin is maddening, as he and the smug script aren't nearly as clever as they think they are. With Slevin, it's an act. With the screenplay, it's tiresome.
 
 All the exposition required to spell out the characters' ultimate intentions is not worth the effort. When Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie's "The Usual Suspects" does its big reveal, the realization is swift and economical. "Slevin's" is drawn out to awkward lengths. The loquacious gangster genre was snuffed out in the late '90s by less-talented imitators trying to cook up their own "Reservoir Dogs" or "Pulp Fiction." Unless Q.T. himself wants to give it a shot, it's far too soon for a revival.

Lucky Number Slevin  is not exactly an inviting title for a booby-trapped hipster gangster thriller  it looks like a misprint and sounds, when you say it aloud, as if it were being uttered by Sylvester the Cat. The awkwardness is hardly incidental, though. Like everything else about this scrambled-time-frame, hoodwink-the-audience, so-clever-it's-too-clever-by-half contraption of a movie, that pesky title is meant to noodge your brain, to leave you with a nattering question  what the hell is slevin?  instead of an answer.
Here are some of the questions you may have. Why does Bruce Willis, looking rumpled in a fedora as he sits in a wheelchair in the middle of an empty airport terminal, confront a baffled young man with a long and winding yarn about a misbegotten racetrack bet, only to get up from his chair and snap the fellow's neck? Why does a guy named Slevin (Josh Hartnett)  okay, that's one mystery solved  get mistaken for a guy named Nick, then hauled away by thugs to the wood-paneled penthouse lair of an underworld boss called...the Boss (Morgan Freeman)? Why is Slevin told that he must commit a hit for him, even though he's never killed anybody in his life? Why does another boss, this one known as the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley)  because he is, in fact, a rabbi  haul Slevin into his penthouse too? Why do the two penthouses face each other? When the person Slevin is ordered to kill turns out to be the Rabbi's gay son (who is known as the Fairy), and Slevin, to set him up, asks him on a date, is it just another cute plot device or does it carry a whiff of homophobia? Does it matter? Does anything in this movie matter?
Not really, and that's a problem. With its double-cross enigmas folded into blood, guts, and bullets, Lucky Number Slevin  wants to bend your brain the way that Pulp Fiction  and (for some) The Usual Suspects  did. In any given scene, we're supposed to be reacting on two levels at once: to the punchy  immediacy of vicious happy-talk criminals, and  to the mildly intellectual crossword-puzzle suspense of figuring out how the bizarre scenario fits together. Lest we forget that it's all in good fun, there are scenes like the one in which Slevin and the sexy coroner next door (Lucy Liu) bond over their love of James Bond flicks, riffing on the various actors who played Blofeld  a pop debate in the Tarantino tradition, except that the trivia in question is far too standard-issue. Jason Smilovic's script, which keeps you guessing just enough to keep you occupied, has been staged with aggressive finesse by director Paul McGuigan, and Hartnett, who worked with McGuigan once before (in the truly romantic  and far superior  puzzle mystery Wicker Park ), knows how to use his pie-eyed boyish lethargy to maximum duplicitous effect. It's amusing to see Kingsley do what looks like a winking impersonation of overcooked De Niro. Yet Lucky Number Slevin , for all its game invention, is less Pulp Fiction  than an Elmore Leonard knockoff crossed with Deathtrap : a thriller that holds less interest  and less water  the more it reveals about what's actually going on.

 "Lucky Number Slevin," a shallow, dandified grandson of "Pulp Fiction," is the movie equivalent of a junior high school showoff desperate to prove he knows more than the teacher. Frantically raising his hand to answer every question, he exhibits the gleeful self-satisfaction of a quiz kid explaining the theory of relativity.  But because the teacher in this case is Quentin Tarantino, topics like the merits of the various James Bonds, the plot of "North by Northwest" and the personality of a 50's cartoon character called the Shmoo are what matters. In the Tarantino school, the pesky loudmouth might get an A. But what good would it do him in the real world?  Digressions on Bond, Hitchcock and the Shmoo are among the trivial pursuits squeezed into this mildly entertaining jigsaw puzzle of mistaken identity and revenge. The movie begins with a jarring rat-a-tat of four gory murders, then spends the rest of its time assembling its pieces into a semi-coherent picture.  Josh Hartnett, as Slevin, stumbles through the movie with a broken nose and his shirt off much of the time, and is the only one of the five male stars who doesn't wear the smirk of a prankster playing an elaborate practical joke at our expense. Besides the director Paul McGuigan ("Wicker Park") and the screenwriter Jason Smilovic, the other major conspirators include Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci and Bruce Willis. Lucy Liu skips in and out of the movie as a smart, sexy coroner who hooks up with Slevin.    It would be unfair to give away the story's final revelation except to say that early on, "Lucky Number Slevin" cheats with a deliberately misleading flashback. Were the truth revealed, there would be no movie. That fundamental deception lends "Lucky Number Slevin" a slightly sour aftertaste.  After its shoot-'em-up intro, the film embarks on a series of hairpin turns, starting with a scene of Mr. Willis regaling a stranger with a story about a man who was slaughtered along with his family after he bet on a drugged horse in 1979. The movie flashes back to that race 27 years earlier; just as the horse pulls ahead, it collapses. In a moment of David Mamet-manqué, Mr. Willis drops an enigmatic reference to the "Kansas City shuffle" that remains hanging until the very end of the movie.  Finally we meet Slevin, who is visiting the New York apartment of his friend Nick. According to Lindsey (Ms. Liu), who lives across the hall, Nick hasn't been seen lately. A pair of thugs barge in, rough up Slevin and drag him to the penthouse lair of the Boss (Mr. Freeman), a silver-tongued crime lord who couldn't care less that Slevin isn't Nick; all he wants is the $96,000 owed him.  After nattering on about the Shmoo, the Boss makes Slevin an offer he can't refuse. Either he comes up with the money or he agrees to kill the son of the Boss's former friend and now archrival, the Rabbi (Mr. Kingsley), a k a Schlomo. Both gangsters are under surveillance by a cop named Brikowski (Mr. Tucci in a role that contributes nothing to the movie).  From its sly, amused performances to its surreal comic book gloss to its artfully nervous camerawork, "Lucky Number Slevin" sustains the blasé tone and look of a smart-aleck thriller that buries its heart under layers of attitude. But the same maneuvers Mr. Tarantino deploys with the enthusiasm of a true fanatic here are empty gestures. When the movie makes a belated stab at sincerity, it's too little, too late.  A smattering of youngish guys will probably set out to unravel the movie's secrets with the same zeal that drove fans of "Memento" to piece it together after the fact. For this nonbeliever, deciphering "Lucky Number Slevin" is not worth spending an extra five minutes.  "Lucky Number Slevin" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has gory violence, with some profanity and sexual situations.

After a somewhat rough beginning with "Wicker Park," helmer Paul McGuigan and star Josh Hartnett advance to new levels of devious gamesmanship in "Lucky Number Slevin." Thoroughly -- and sometimes justifiably -- infatuated with its own cleverness, this mistaken-identity thriller delights in narrative complication and Tarantino-esque self-awareness; it's when the labyrinthine plot starts to make sense, ironically, that the pervasive shallowness becomes a liability. Stylishly made and loaded with marquee talent, this Weinstein Co. acquisition is just smart enough to please mainstream auds without turning them off, though repeat viewings a la "Memento" and "The Sixth Sense" are unlikely.
Conjuring an enjoyably nonsensical underworld replete with warring Gotham crime lords and Hasidic Jewish hoodlums, pic is never more playfully dissembling than in its first reel, which practically conjures a new scenario every five minutes.
Four bloody murders are executed in unnervingly rapid succession, followed by a placid scene at an empty waystation where an anonymous man (Sam Jaeger) is approached by the wheelchair-bound Smith (Bruce Willis). Smith proceeds to tell the fellow a story, shown in sad, grisly flashback, about a man killed with his family after losing a bundle at the racetrack. In telling his tale, Smith defines a "Kansas City shuffle" -- basically gamblers' slang for misdirection, which turns out to be the primary strategy of Jason Smilovic's teasingly convoluted script.
It's here that the story proper begins, opening with a young man named Slevin (Hartnett) who's taken up temporary residence at his friend Nick's apartment in New York. Nick has gone missing, as Slevin soon learns from across-the-hall neighbor Lindsey (a disarmingly perky Lucy Liu), who insists on playing amateur detective while making no secret of her attraction to the hunky new houseguest.
Spicy flirtation gives way to violent trauma, however, when two thugs show up and mistake Slevin for Nick. They drag him before the Boss (Morgan Freeman), who calmly informs him that he's got three days to pay $96,000. The Boss offers to forgive the debt if Slevin helps exact revenge on his arch-nemesis Schlomo (Ben Kingsley), also known as the Rabbi.
Meanwhile, a wheelchair-free Smith resurfaces as a hit man doing business with both the Boss and the Rabbi, while Slevin finds himself aggressively shadowed by a detective named Brikowski (Stanley Tucci).
The mysteries multiply along with the body count, but the fun of "Lucky Number Slevin" comes from its quick-witted improvisation -- Lindsey, helpfully, turns out to be a coroner -- and the nutty, liberating sense that pic could go anywhere.
If the shamelessly self-reflexive script sometimes smells like refried Tarantino, with wink-wink dialogues about comicbooks, James Bond and Hitchcock's "North by Northwest," it also contains sharper one-liners than any thriller in recent memory -- most of them handed to Hartnett, whose Slevin is a serious smartass and all the more likable for it.
Pic quickly loses its sense of humor, however, once it gets down to the business of explaining itself (surprise, surprise, no one is exactly who he appears to be), springing its revelations with mechanical precision as Smilovic's amusing wrong-man scenario morphs into a self-serious revenge drama. Frivolously entertaining trifle simply isn't equipped to handle weighty ideas like the possibility of honor among killers.
McGuigan -- who, on the evidence of "Wicker Park," "Gangster No. 1" and "The Reckoning," has yet to meet a variety of thriller he doesn't like -- unleashes a showy arsenal of whooshing cameras and jump cuts, filming the brief but brutal eruptions of violence for maximum impact. Cinematographer Peter Sova, in his fourth collaboration with the Scottish director, varies the palette superbly with different intensities of color.
Fabulous production design specializes in swirling wallpaper patterns that tantalizingly hint at pic's underlying narrative enigmas. Montreal locations, which stood in for Chicago in "Wicker Park," are at best a passable facsimile of New York.

You may still retain your ardor and respect, as I have, for the pressure-point hammerblow Quentin Tarantino  executed on American movies, but it's difficult at this late date not to view him as an imperative inoculation with unfortunate side effects: gas, bloating, dizziness, delusions of cleverness. Imitators flock when coolness seems an Everyman's right, and because QT's achievement is 75 percent chutzpah, film-geek craziness, and attitude (the kind that allows your characters to ramble for many script pages about TV shows and cereals), he made his mini-revolution look far too easy. The fad seemed to have peaked a few years back, but overwritten, slang-dictionary-fueled screenplays can still impress the dependie suits, and so we have Paul McGuigan 's Lucky Number Slevin , a smug, derivative, but frequently witty crime cartoon set in a mythical city where dueling underworld kingpins (Morgan Freeman  and Ben Kingsley ) face each other in sealed towers, the chasm between them traversed by unimpressive digital swoops.
As spun by McGuigan (Gangster Number 1 ), always and still a Guy Ritchie  drone among Tarantinoites, the plot is standard-operating-procedure curlicue hyperbole, a one-up-man grift over The Usual Suspects  that seems impossible to untangle until the film explains it all, laboriously, in speeches. We begin with a wheelchair-lounging Bruce Willis  in a bus depotthe smirking starts early and does not subsideregaling a barely interested schlub with backstory (racetrack, bad luck, murder), and then leap to the present, where Slevin (an amiable Josh Hartnett ) comes from out of town and is mistaken for his deadbeat friend, who's in gambling hock to both of the towered bosses. Before the idiosyncratically moronic henchmen show up, and before Slevin sits down for expansive, sparring, jovial exchanges with the respective mega-crooks (Kingsley's is called "The Rabbi," because, everyone answers, he is a rabbi), he meets cute with flibbertigibbet coroner Lindsey (Lucy Liu ). There isn't much reason why the entire film couldn't have occupied itself with Hartnett and Liu dishing, tossing bon mots, making bedroom eyes in a cheap apartment kitchen, and just being as bubbly together as a truckload of canned champagne (the noir-banter screenplay by Jason Smilovic  seems like it could sustain their pas de deux indefinitely). Even a distended discussion of Bond movies can be forgiven amid the barely repressed giggles.
But then the story mechanics must begin locking gears and factorying out contrivances, clichés, oversimplistic complexities, pounding glibness, and brutal stereotypes (a 2-D fool known only as The Fairy gets a bloody comeuppance). Even the other characters grow tired of remarking on how relaxed and unthreatened Hartnett's wiseass seems, which is just one of a thousand clues to the movie's obligatory secret über-narrative. It's a waggish but empty vessel, with time enough for you to consider how Tarantino's babbling influence is at least preferable to Joe Eszterhas 's or Shane Black 's. Cursedbut ironically!with stomach-churning '60s decor, Slevin  might round off in Park Chanwook  country, but the lingering sense of it is as an amusement park for the actors, who are as infectiously overjoyed for the bouncy badinage as preschoolers on Christmas morning. Like tired parents, our enjoyment is primarily vicarious.
