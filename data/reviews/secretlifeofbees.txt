The film starts off promisingly with the voiceover narration of 14-year-old Lily Owens (Fanning): "I killed my mother when I was 4 years old. That's all I knew about myself." It's an opening lush with the expectation of great melodrama to come or the lurid agonies of a Southern gothic, but The Secret Life of Bees
 quickly segues into place as a sincere and well-meaning coming-of-age story. Adapted for the screen from Sue Monk Kidd's bestselling novel by director Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball
), The Secret Life of Bees
 tells the story of Lily's maturation from her self-loathing girlhood into a more confident teenhood, due largely to her escape from the home of her morose and bitter father (Bettany) into the matriarchal embrace she discovers at the homestead of the unusual Boatwright sisters. Set in 1964 against the background of the newly signed Civil Rights Act, which banned segregation and ensured the universal right to vote, The Secret Life of Bees
 uses this agitated climate to advance the storyline in a couple of instances but generally exists in a bubble that's devoid of racial bigotry and economic issues. When Lily's black maid Rosaleen (Hudson) tries to register to vote and is beaten and arrested for her efforts, Lily, who is white, decides it's time for the two of them to run away from their unhappy lives. She heads to Tiburon, S.C., a town hinted at by one of her mother's remaining possessions, and there finds the 28-acre home of the Boatwrights: August (Latifah), June (Keys) and May (Okonedo). Inordinately cultured and educated for their time, these three black siblings are unlike anything Lily or Rosaleen has ever encountered. Given refuge by the Boatwrights, the two thrive as Lily learns the art and business of beekeeping from honey entrepreneur August and conscience and heart from cellist, teacher, and NAACP activist June and troubled May, who has taken on all the troubles of the world following the death of her twin sister. Many are the metaphors comparing the lives and beehives of humans and insects, and the figurative honey often drips off the screen. In many ways, The Secret Life of Bees
 feels like an old-fashioned movie with its homilies, spiritualism, and descriptions of African-Americans as "educated" and "cultured." It feels one step removed from describing these women as "clean" and "well-spoken" � modern buzz words used to cloak insidious racism and social tiers. However, none of these complaints is a real blight against the movie: The opportunity to bask in the presence of this soulful matriarchy is its own reward. Fanning continues to surprise us with her acting aplomb that reveals a maturity and subtlety beyond her years. And what might have been a mere showplace for songstresses-turned-actresses (count 'em) is much richer than might be expected. The Secret Life of Bees
 generally works like a drone but sometimes provides glimpses of the queens at the center.


It's reasonable to approach "The Secret Life of Bees" with a degree of bewilderment. It is, after all, a year in which an African-American man and his African-American wife have a shot at moving into the White House. This movie takes a snapshot of life for three black sisters in 1964 taking care of a runaway white girl named Lily (Dakota Fanning). On its sweet, tear-jerking surface, the movie is a tired old Hollywood story: Girl meets mammy - OK, mammies. But that is merely the surface. The title is literal (Lily finds refuge on a honey farm) and something more.
This secret life also belongs to the women whom Hollywood has taken for granted since the inception of movies - the women a weepy Halle Berry actually acknowledged and cosmically thanked in her Oscar speech; the Hattie McDaniels, Ethel Waterses, and Pearl Baileys; this legacy of strength, struggle, sadness, sass, and service.
Adapted from Sue Monk Kidd's 2002 popular novel, "The Secret Life of Bees" attempts an expansion of the movies' social dynamics by acknowledging that these entertainers were politically aware human beings, too. Queen Latifah, Sophie Okonedo, Alicia Keys, and Jennifer Hudson play the women who are looking out for Lily, while the writer and director Gina Prince-Bythewood applies historical intelligence by having these characters react mostly in small and subtle ways to the racial climate around them.
After Congress passes the Civil Rights Act, Lily's maid, Rosaleen (Hudson), watches President Lyndon Johnson declare the bill a law on TV. Sitting next to Lily, she lets out a shocked expletive, and it's a powerful use of profanity, capturing the surprise of a momentous historical moment. 
 Here "The Secret Life of Bees" begins to build its bridge between 44 years ago and now; next month, a lot of people might be sitting around TVs echoing a version of Rosaleen's astonishment.
Rosaleen is so galvanized by her new legal protections that she marches into town with Lily to register to vote. Racists cross their path and beat Rosaleen, who's arrested, hospitalized, and, rescued by Lily, who's on a mission of her own. She has just abandoned her South Carolina peach farm and her mean old daddy (Paul Bettany) to find out more about the mother she shot as a girl (it's nuts even after you've seen it yourself).
So the runaway and the fugitive hit the road. Hudson is not earth's most dynamic actor, but she has a tremendous presence, which is like charisma for serious church people.
Both Lily and Rosaleen wind up harbored at the big pink home of the Boatwright sisters, who reluctantly agree to let them stay in a shed designated for cultivating the Black Madonna honey the sisters harvest. June is suspicious of the white girl and her black-and-blue friend, who both, in turn, find these self-possessed sisters and their enormous house fascinating. But it's Rosaleen's fascination that feels new for the movies. A poor black girl from the country is seeing her first middle-class black family, and her mind is blown.
Sadly, Hudson spends most of the movie in the background - rocking in a chair on the Boatwright's porch, standing by their stove - while Lily explores her mamma drama, her mammy drama, and her attraction to Zach (Tristan Wilds), August's luscious godson who helps with the honey.
Prince-Bythewood, whose previous movie was the romantic drama "Love & Basketball" (2000), guides Fanning to another of her emotionally sobered pre-adult/adult performances. But on screen something happens that goes beyond Monk's powers of description and Fanning's way of seeming 14 and 44 at the same time.
In part, this is a matter of casting. The performances by Okonedo, Keys, and Latifah are as different as the actors are different-looking - they seem more spiritually related than biologically so. They put into words some of what I've often thought women like Waters and Bailey were thinking in movies. June says it doesn't make any sense, for instance, that some white people raised by black women can turn out to be so hateful.
But Prince-Bythewood demonstrates a lovely gift for capturing the unsaid. When Lily tells Rosaleen she loves her, Rosaleen puts the girl under her arm and says nothing, which says the world about the complex bond between these two women.


In an age when Will Smith is the world's most popular movie star and Barack Obama could well be elected president, it's fair to ask: Isn't it time that Hollywood took a sabbatical  maybe a permanent one  from movies in which black characters exist primarily to save the souls of white ones? In the screen version of Sue Monk Kidd's smash-hit novel The Secret Life of Bees , 14-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) escapes the clutches of her redneck father (Paul Bettany) in 1964 South Carolina by running away from home, accompanied by her caretaker, Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson), who is wanted by the police. (She had dared to insult the racists who tried to prevent her from registering to vote.) In a small-town general store, Lily spots a jar of honey with the mysterious image of a black Madonna on the label. Seeking the source of the jar, she and Rosaleen meet August Boatwright (Queen Latifah), a maternal beekeeper who lives in a cozy pink house and is just as hearty and sweet as the honey Bees she harvests. The two are invited to stay for a while, and so they move in, go to work, and get to know August and her sisters: the regal, gifted June (Alicia Keys), who teaches cello and lowers her shield of pride for no one (even the handsome beau who adores her), and the childlike May (Sophie Okonedo), who is prone to sudden crying jags.
When you read The Secret Life of Bees , you know why the book sold 5 million copies. Kidd is a seductive writer, with a voice that carries just enough moonlight and magnolias to evoke the desultory Southern lyricism of To Kill a Mockingbird . Each character vibrates with mystery. In the movie version, adapted by writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball ), the architecture of the plot is about all that remains, apart from a few stray thoughts about queen bees as metaphors. The film has no poetry or atmosphere; it presents the Boathouse women as TV-movie wisps of characters. Latifah glows with benevolent strength, Keys glowers like she's warming up to star in The Angela Davis Story , and Okonedo is a tremulous wallflower. This has the unfortunate effect  far different from the book's  of making it seem as if these women had been placed on earth in order to help one confused, distraught white girl find her way. Fanning may look 14, but perhaps because she's been playing precocious kids for so long, she still acts younger, without the sensual curiosity of the book's heroine. Lily's romance with a black teenager, Zachary (Tristan Wilds), should be incendiary, but it falls flat, and her connection to the death of her mother is a Big Event that haunts the movie far too mechanically.
Over the years, we've all seen too many anachronistic ''magic Negroes'' in movies like Forrest Gump  and The Green Mile . The saintly African-American matriarchy of The Secret Life of Bees  may appear benign by comparison. Yet the film, set in the civil rights era, has a dated, musty piety that too often evokes the liberal message mongering of that time. The Secret Life of Bees  is a lesson  or, rather, a whole series of them  we no longer need to learn. Of course, it's also a divine-sisterhood-defeats-all chick flick, and on that score there's no denying that its clichés are rousingly up to date.

 Adapted by Gina Prince-Bythewood from the best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd, “The Secret Life of Bees” unfolds in a sentimental, honey-glazed land that vaguely resembles South Carolina in 1964. It would be wrong to say that the troubles of that time and place have been wished away — on the contrary, the movie begins with a scene of horrific domestic violence and includes child abuse, a racially motivated beating, suicide and the threat of a lynching — but from the opening voice-over to the final credits,  every terror and sorrow is swaddled in warm, therapeutic comfort.  The film insists so strenuously on its themes of redemption, tolerance, love and healing that it winds up defeating itself, and robbing Ms. Kidd’s already maudlin tale of its melodramatic heat. At first there is a jolt of pure Southern Gothic, as Dakota Fanning matter-of-factly tells us that when she was 4, she shot her mother dead. Ms. Fanning plays Lily, who, at the age of 14, when the story takes place, lives with her mean-drunk peach farmer dad, T. Ray (Paul Bettany). He tells her that her mother never loved her and makes her kneel on grits when she misbehaves.  One night Lily, who dreams of being a writer and keeps a box of keepsakes buried in the orchard behind her house, runs away with Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson), a black employee of T. Ray’s who has been beaten and jailed for trying to register to vote. The two of them find their way to an upcountry town called Tiburon, where they are taken in by three beekeeping sisters named August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys) and May (Sophie Okonedo).  May, who seems a little simple-minded, is also so deeply empathetic that her sisters have built a “wailing wall,”  where she can go to cry when the world’s grief overwhelms her, which is often. June, who plays the cello, is also a political activist (or at least a collector of N.A.A.C.P. T-shirts), and, as such, is a bit leery of the white girl who comes around in need of mothering. But August is a person of such boundless maternal wisdom and generosity that neither June nor Lily nor any of the million bees in August’s care need worry.  Even as terrible things insist on happening, and the bigotry and suspicion of the era take their toll, worries are no match for matriarchal folk religion and the wisdom of the beehive. In its fuzzy linking of female power with insect life, “The Secret Life of Bees” shows a curious kinship with Neil LaBute’s ill-starred remake of “The Wicker Man,” but with nurturing African-American women in place of murderous white ones.  In case they didn’t have enough problems of their own, August and her sisters also have Lily to deal with, and the film seems to struggle with an awkward and unstated tension. You can almost feel how badly it wants to be about the lives, not of bees, but of black women at a pivotal moment in the recent past.  Despite Ms. Prince-Bythewood’s best efforts to retain a sense of history, and Queen Latifah’s shrewd refusal to play her character according to stereotype, the film becomes a familiar and tired fable of black selflessness, in which African-Americans take time out from their struggle against oppression to lift the battered self-esteem of white people who have the good sense not to be snarling bigots. Even Ms. Fanning, weeping on cue and looking uncomfortable otherwise, seems a little abashed that the movie, in the end, has to be all about her.  “The Secret Life of Bees” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has violence and some profanity.

Like a mouthful of honey, "The Secret Life of Bees" is cloyingly sweet and gooey, and you're not quite sure you can swallow it undiluted. Based on Sue Monk Kidd's popular 2002 novel about Southern sisterhood during the civil rights movement and toplining Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah, the Fox Searchlight release should attract fans of the bestselling tome and arthouse patrons but will be held back from breakout biz by poor word of mouth.
Helmer Gina Prince-Bythewood, who adapted the book, apparently had one instructive word for her actors ("earnest!") and one for her d.p. ("signify!"). Opening in 1964 South Carolina, the story follows young Lily (Fanning) from the story's rather terrific opening line ("I killed my mother when I was 4 years old ...") and a perilous relationship with her abusive father (a very good Paul Bettany), to the motherly embrace of the beekeeping, highly cultured August Boatwright (Latifah) and her sisters, May (Sophie Okonedo), and June (Alicia Keyes). 
The Civil Rights Act has been signed, and the South is not reacting well, especially toward women like Lily's housekeeper, Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson), who are sick of racist abuse. When Rosaleen is arrested -- after being assaulted by rednecks -- she and Lily flee like a distaff Huck and Jim, and end up at Chez Boatwright. "It's like they got their own spot in the world where the outside don't come in," Rosaleen says dreamily. The movie is full of lines like that. 
Like "Secret Life's" score -- almost exclusively contempo pop, and all too deliberate -- the film has no use for its own time, or even place, and seems intent on giving the actresses all the room they need to be as broad as possible. 
The characters, as written, are little more than one-dimensional, which doesn't make for interesting, nuanced drama. But the performers do the best with the faux-profound platitudes they're given.
Latifah is all nobility and empowerment, which may be the kind of thing that brings audiences in (it certainly made the book popular). Fanning has grown out of the juvenile roles that made her famous but retains her openness and vulnerability. 
Pop star Keyes is a revelation in her third bigscreen role (after "Smokin' Aces" and "The Nanny Diaries"), and Okonedo, always first-rate, shows enormous sensitivity playing the simple-minded May.
Production values are tops, the shooting by Rogier Stoffers particularly notable.


From its attention-grabbing B-movie beginning, The Secret Life of Bees , a family drama based on the bestselling novel by Sue Monk Kidd , chugs pleasantly into a television special tailored for the crossover female market, while dropping tantalizing hints that it has more on its mind than a benign tale of substitute mothering across the color line. The ever-capable Dakota Fanning  plays Lily, a motherless teenager who flees her bullying father (Paul Bettany , channeling Brad Dourif ) to find safe haven with three black bee-keeping sisters more solidly equipped for life than she. Writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball ) bathes them in a honeyed glow and tempers the soundtrack's jaunty Motown music with a soft guitar when Southern racism pokes in its unwelcome head. Stately black actresses approaching middle age always run the risk of getting locked in as the face of Black Equanimity, and as August, the oldest sister whose job it is to teach Lily how to live a good life, Queen Latifah  has no choice but to succumb. Only near the end does this likable but saccharine movie fleetingly complicate the Gone With the Wind –fed delusion that the love of poor, black nannies for their white charges was undiluted by bitterness. Is that Hattie McDaniel  I hear, whooping for joy from beyond the grave?
