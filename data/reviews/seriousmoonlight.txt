         There is something weirdly endearing about Meg Ryan's woman in denial in "Serious Moonlight," blissfully confident that she can reclaim her husband's heart despite the mistress she's just discovered, despite the divorce he is demanding. He rages, she's understanding; he roars, she bakes cookies; he negotiates, she shows their wedding slides.

 Of course there is the small matter of Ian, the cheating spouse played by Timothy Hutton. He is forced to wage this battle while tightly duct-taped to a chair, then a toilet (be careful what you ask a woman on the verge . . .), all while nursing a bump on the head courtesy of a well-aimed flowerpot.



         






  Could this really be sweet, adorable Meg Ryan? "Sleepless in Seattle" Meg? "You've Got Mail" Meg? Yes - that Meg. And she uses every bit of that flirty, smiling, blue-eyed innocence that we first fell in love with to diffuse the fact that she seems to have gone completely psycho. At least in "The War of the Roses," that classic lethal whack at an extremely dicey divorcing duo, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas were both armed.

It's been a long time since Ryan has had a romantic comedy that gave her room to move and though the scale is smaller here, the humor blacker and Ryan well beyond the first blush phase, you'll be glad that "Serious Moonlight" came along.

One of several finished scripts left by promising filmmaker Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered in late 2006 just months before her indie hit "Waitress" would draw rave reviews, "Serious Moonlight" also feels like a tribute movie, that is to say more reverential and less polished than it might have been had Shelly been able to direct as planned.

Still, one of the pleasures of the film -- from conception to character to the conversations that fill the scenes -- is the savvy and off-center way Shelly had of crafting troubled relationships. Thankfully, "Waitress" co-star Cheryl Hines has not lost sight of that in making her feature directing debut. 

"Serious Moonlight" takes apart a single day in a 13-year marriage that is in serious trouble. Louise (Ryan) and Ian make up our 40-ish crisis couple -- Louise just doesn't know about the crisis yet. Ian has planned the perfect weekend at their country home -- a final tryst with his young honey Sara (Kristen Bell) before they head off to Paris and a quick kiss-off note for the wife to find when she shows up a day later.

But in life, as in comedy, timing is everything and Shelly is about to give us her Al Davis interpretation of a woman wronged -- don't get mad, don't get even, just win, baby. There are great moments as Louise puts this strategy into play, her casual chat with the other woman a study in female one-upmanship at its manipulative best.

Of course there are always risks of things going wrong in these sorts of power struggles and the filmmakers keep turning the tables again and again, often with the help of Todd (Justin Long), the gardener who comes to mow the lawn. There's nothing that gives hope to a hostage like a third party showing up, and the disaffected irony that we've seen Long hone over time -- the bartending relationship guru of "He's Just Not That Into You" comes to mind -- is worked in a few new ways here.

If you've forgotten just what an excellent physical comedian Ryan is, look for a few neatly executed moves in the bathroom when Louise agrees to a temporary break in the talks.

Packed in all the twists and turns, the slapstick and pratfalls, Louise and Ian pick through many of the reasons any marriage fails, which is what ultimately makes the comedy smart. Anyone who's been in a long-term relationship is likely to find one or two that will make them squirm a little as well as laugh. 

"Serious Moonlight" has its flaws, but then what marriage doesn't? You can feel Hines' comic talents, usually on display in front of the camera (most notably as wife to Larry David in "Curb Your Enthusiasm"), but you can also feel her pull back, and in those moments things get a little messy. The tribute problem again. Next time you hope she'll feel free to put her prints all over the film. This time, though, it was for love.



   

In Serious Moonlight , Meg Ryan plays a lawyer who discovers that her husband (Timothy Hutton) plans to leave her for a young thing (Kristen Bell). So she does what any lawyer would do if she were Meg Ryan  duct-tapes him to a toilet, then persuades him to love her again by dint of being Meg Ryan. (Ryan nearly breaks a sweat working so hard to charm.) There's a lot of yelling, cracking wise, and cooing in this creepy rom-com. Curb Your Enthusiasm 's Cheryl Hines directs, from a script by the late filmmaker Adrienne Shelly  a return favor, perhaps, for Shelly's having cast her in Waitress .

 “Serious Moonlight” suggests an unholy, watered-down hybrid of “The Ref” and “Funny Games,” played as a chirpy screwball comedy, if you can imagine something so bizarre.  Based on a screenplay by Adrienne Shelly, who wrote, directed and co-starred in the independent hit “Waitress,” it may be the year’s talkiest movie. And as its yammering stars Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton go through the motions of trying to emulate Carole Lombard and Cary Grant, you wait impatiently for a comic spark to ignite.  Three years ago Ms. Shelly, who was 40,  was killed in her New York apartment by a construction worker bent on robbery, and her promising career was cut short. Although the film’s production notes maintain that the screenplay was finished at the time of her death, it doesn’t feel that way, especially when the movie ends with an abrupt thud. Since much of it is set in a bathroom in which the lead characters Louise (Ms. Ryan) and Ian (Mr. Hutton), immobilized by duct tape, are held prisoner, “Serious Moonlight” has the static, claustrophobic atmosphere of a two-character play.  Cheryl Hines (Cheryl David on HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm”), who co-starred with Ms. Shelly and Keri Russell in “Waitress,” makes her directorial debut with “Serious Moonlight.” The choice makes sense in that the movie aspires to the same tone of rancid hilarity as the far more sophisticated and diabolically misanthropic “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”  The couple’s ordeal begins when Louise, an assertive corporate lawyer and superwoman, arrives home a day early from a business trip at the country house outside New York that she shares with Ian, her husband of 13 years. Finding the place strewn with rose petals, she assumes that Ian has prepared a romantic welcome home.  Her fantasy is immediately shattered when he confesses that he has fallen in love with Sara (Kristen Bell), a 24-year-old receptionist for whom the floral greeting was intended. He is planning to whisk Sara to Paris the next morning, leaving Louise the farewell letter that he was finishing when she unexpectedly barged in.  A furious Louise bops Ian on the head with a flower pot, then ties him to a chair while he is unconscious. When he comes to, she uses her wiles — his favorite cookies, sexy clothes, old home movies of happier days — to try to woo him back. Ian talks his way out of bondage only to be bopped on the head again as he is about to escape. He lands in an upstairs bathroom taped to a toilet.  Louise leaves, and Ian’s cries for help are eventually heard by a sinister-looking landscaper (Justin Long) passing by the house on a lawnmower. Sizing up the situation, he proceeds to assault Ian and ransack the house.  Louise, upon returning, is knocked out and held prisoner, while the burglar and his lowlife friends raid the liquor supply and party all night long.  Eventually Sara, in a rage after Ian didn’t show up at the airport, appears and is also taken captive. The shallow, whiny Sara is a real pill.  In their angry repartee Louise and Ian get off an occasionally witty zinger about marriage and its discontents, and Ms. Ryan uses her considerable ability for physical comedy to make Louise a formidable opponent in this suburban Punch and Judy show. But “Serious Moonlight” is a very shallow comedy.  For the real thing, rent “The Ref,” in which Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis, with a boost from Glynis Johns, set the house on fire.    “Serious Moonlight” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong, sexually frank language and violence.

Many women would probably like to duct-tape their unfaithful mates to a toilet bowl, but watching it happen isn't quite as funny as it sounds -- at least, not in "Serious Moonlight," actress Cheryl Hines' adaptation of the late Adrienne Shelly's screenplay. A less-than-frothy domestic showdown starring Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton, it owes as much to Edward Albee as to Nora Ephron, with an occasional nod to "A Clockwork Orange." Sentimental interest in the work of Shelly ("Waitress"), who was murdered in 2006, will likely find the film a theatrical home, but it's far too brittle and shrill to win much love.
There's a marital Armageddon going down in the home of Louise (Ryan) and Ian (Hutton), two unhappy suburbanites with different agendas, although only one of them seems to know it. Louise is a high-powered attorney with a cell phone permanently attached to her ear (a Bluetooth being far less effective as a film prop) and is apparently oblivious to the fact her marriage is in such disrepair that Ian would be planning an escape to Paris with a much younger girlfriend, Sara (Kristen Bell). When Ian refuses to listen to reason, such as it is, Louise knocks him out with a flower pot, trusses him up, tapes him to the toilet and tries to argue him back into loving her.
Helmer Hines (best known for her acting in "Curb Your Enthusiasm") exhibits very little visual flair in relating the meltdown of Ian and Louise -- the framing is stilted and predictable. But the premise of the script, which seems more suited to the stage, is so spatially constrained it really doesn't offer Hines much opportunity.
"Serious Moonlight" takes place largely in the couple's upstairs bathroom, while drunken burglars led by Todd the gardener (Justin Long), who also ties up Louise, ransack the downstairs area. When Ian misses his plane, an irate Sara arrives, and is likewise bound and, unfortunately, not gagged. The verbal three-way should have been a lot wittier than it is, although Ryan manages, through sheer timing, to turn a lot of lines into laughs.
The twist at the end of the film absolves Hines for some of what has come before, although it's still too little, too late. It doesn't make the film's uglier aspects any prettier -- after Todd has taken the women hostage, there's a palpable threat of rape and even some molestation, with an impotent Ian screaming from the toilet bowl. Given the presence of Hines, Ryan and the legacy of Shelly, who always brought a bright comedic touch to things (including "Waitress," which was sometimes serious, but mirthful), "Serious Moonlight" will be perceived as romantic comedy. It doesn't qualify -- and makes one wonder, too, if the screenplay was really finished.

Timothy Hutton  is duct-taped to the potty, and Meg Ryan  is just plain potty in this posthumously produced Adrienne Shelly  script directed by first-timer Cheryl Hines  (who starred in Shelly's Waitress ). Born of the grief-fueled determination of Shelly's husband, Andy Ostroy , to carry on the legacy of his late wife, who had completed several screenplays by the time of her death in 2006, Serious Moonlight  has a backstory much more intriguingly dramatic than what's onscreen. When alpha attorney Louise (Ryan) discovers that Ian (Hutton), her husband of 13 years, is about to leave her for 24-year-old receptionist Sara (Kristen Bell ), she trusses him up on the toilet of their country house, holding him hostage until he falls in love with her again. Ryan flails and Hutton screams through the powder-room tears and recriminations, performing as if they're doing dinner theater underwritten by Dr. Phil . The tonally weird black comedy throws in some Funny Games —and creepily echoes the circumstances surrounding Shelly's murder by a construction worker who broke into her office to rob her—when Justin Long 's local gardener shows up to burglarize the house, roughing up Ian and feeling up Louise.
