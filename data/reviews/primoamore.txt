hink of it as the intelligent woman's guide to how not to have sex. You go on a blind date. The guy has a shaved head and beady eyes, and within seconds tells you that you are not as thin as he imagined. Most women - check that, most sensible, sane women - would tell baldy to take a very short hike off a very long pier. You know better. Even Bridget Jones, with her trembling jowls and insecurities, knows better and would cuddle up with a pound of toffee rather than subject herself to such outrage. The woman in the film "Primo Amore" is not made of such sternly self-reliant stuff. Set in northern Italy and in the darkest recesses of a woman's heart, "Primo Amore" is a horror movie about desire and the toxic pursuit of perfection. Sonia (Michela Cescon) hooks up with Vittorio (Vitaliano Trevisan) at a bus stop during an arranged meeting. At first she is overly eager, he is altogether aloof; given how Venusians and Martians usually align, that should mean they were made for each other. While stung by his comment - whippet-thin, her jowls don't shake and her thighs don't swish - she still goes out with him for a friendly drink. From her anxious gaze it seems clear she very much wants, even needs to forgive the man, either for her sake or his. Within a strangely short time the two are dating, house-hunting and living together, a postcard-perfect couple. Sonia, as it turns out, is a woman who loves men too much and herself too little; Vittorio, in turn, is a man who would love Sonia more if there were much less of her to love. One day while out swimming with Vittorio, Sonia catches sight of a rangy blonde in a bikini. As the blonde settles next to the couple and stretches her long, model-thin limbs, Sonia shifts uncomfortably, her eyes nervously shuttling toward the other woman. The director, Matteo Garrone, captures the scene with cool detachment, letting us register Sonia's discomfort from an easy distance. This not only keeps us outside Sonia's head, for better and eventually for worse, but also lets us see that Vittorio appears oblivious to what is happening right next to him. First comes love, then come the scales. Soon after the leggy blonde makes her unwelcome appearance, Sonia goes on a diet with Vittorio's enthusiastic support. But what first seems like a foolish whim, a matter of vanity and the usual female neurosis, grows progressively perverse. As Sonia sheds weight, Vittorio starts to swell in size, not literally but in terms of power, taking increased control over her every bite and gesture. As in many domestic monster movies ("The Stepfather," among others), the boogeyman appears to have crawled from beneath the bed and slipped under the covers. But unlike better films of this kind, "Primo Amore" is more interested in wrapping a tape measure around the monster than in attending to his victim. Sonia doesn't just shrink in her clothes; she recedes from view. A skilled technician with a taste for the outr� (one of his features was called "The Embalmer"), Mr. Garrone steers his actors along nicely and shows a real talent for wringing low-key dread out of seemingly simple situations. Here, a stab of hunger may be as potentially perilous as a knife-wielding intruder. But the director can only go so far with the story and, in particular, the characters he has cooked up with his fellow screenwriters, Mr. Trevisan and Massimo Gaudioso. All setup and no payoff, "Primo Amore" - which opens in theaters on Wednesday and is showing tonight at the New Directors/New Films festival and again tomorrow - tempts us with a veritable feast of personal obsessions, sexual gamesmanship, psychological terrors and mysterioso atmospherics, but finally leaves us as hungry as poor Sonia. 'Primo Amore' 

Ill-matched lovers and psychological disorders provide food for thought in noirish Italo romancer "First Love." Using dieting as a method of oppression is both unusual and brave, and cinematically the domestic abuse portrayed here has the authentic feel of Jimmy Stewart's obsession with Kim Novak's clothes in "Vertigo." But "First Love's" subject is undermined by the film's fixation with form and surfaces, whether human, architectural or natural. Pic divided crix at its Berlin preem, but its luxuriant, chiaroscuro visuals and dalliance with the touchy subject of women's body size will ensure some future beyond the fest circuit.
Twenty-five-year-old Sonia (Michela Cescon), a shop assistant and artist's model, meets austere, thirtysomething goldsmith Vittorio (Vitaliano Trevisan) on a blind date. The rendezvous is presumably the result of an Internet dating encounter, as the pair is on first-name terms, but as they visually appraise each other it's clear Vittorio is disappointed by Sonia's body shape -- she's svelte, but a little fuller than slim. Put out, she makes an effort to leave, but Vittorio encourages her to stay for a chat.
Over the next few days, the pair becomes further acquainted. Vittorio lives alone in a fortress-like structure above his workshop: He's literally caged in by his need for financial and emotional security. Sonia resides with her brother (Roberto Comacchio), with whom she has a relationship that veers between the supportive and the irksomely close.
Using the acquisition of a new home outside town as leverage, Vittorio persuades Sonia to move in with him and his preoccupation with her weight begins in earnest. With initial encouragement that she'll feel better about herself after shedding some pounds, Vittorio soon ups the ante to the point where Sonia can consume food only under his watchful gaze.
The feeding regime takes its toll on both of them. Vittorio makes a series of unfortunate business decisions due to his inability to focus on anything other than Sonia. Simultaneously, the constant lack of nourishment makes Sonia irritable at best and hallucinatory at worst. Unable or unwilling to work among other people, the enmeshed couple unhappily retreats deeper into their shared world, with disastrous results.
Virtually a two-hander, pic demands and delivers strong perfs. Cescon convincingly inhabits the role of Sonia, which could have quickly become tiresome if played incorrectly: Few actresses have so daringly bared themselves (literally) in such a vulnerable way. As Vittorio, Trevisan manages to be both malevolent and sympathetic, which is also no mean trick.
Direction by Matteo Garrone, who made the similarly obsessive "The Embalmer," is assured and precise, but prone to indulgent moments of contemplation. One particular sequence on a rowboat, in which the protags are deliberately kept out of focus, comes across as irritatingly arty in its heavy-handed demonstration that the pair is out of synch with reality.
While engaging, pic eventually betrays itself as having a trivial attitude to its chosen subject, with a climactic scene that is genuinely, but inappropriately, amusing. Given the preceding build-up, this misplaced humor comes as a letdown. The film immediately attempts to bounce back to its foregoing ominous atmosphere, but the break in tension and the predictability of the finale makes the damage irreparable.
With its deep blacks and use of color chiaroscuro, Marco Onorato's lensing is faultless. Music by Banda Osiris is tantalizingly sinister in a classical vein. Other tech credits are likewise impressive.

A neo-Fassbinderian taxonomist of freak-show love, Italian director Matteo Garronewhose previous film, The Embalmer , was surely the best ever threesome movie involving a gay dwarf taxidermistreturns with an eating-disorder Pygmalion. As a rule, blind dates that open with the guy telling the girl he pictured her thinner tend to be a bust, but against the odds, Vittorio (Vitaliano Trevisan ), a goldsmith whose creepy air of abstraction suggests under- or overmedication, successfully seduces nervous art-school model Sonia (Michela Cescon ), who at about 55 kilos needs to shed at least a quarter of her body mass to fully satisfy him.
Sonia submits to Vittorio's harsh weight-loss regimencounting calories in the kitchen, monitoring her anorexic regress on a sheet of graph paper, and meekly allowing him to buy her impossibly tight dresses. But as the experiment proceeds, Vittorio gets more fanatical and suspicious, recalibrating the scales to prevent any cheating; Sonia, sinking deeper into atrophied disorientation, has an increasingly difficult time heeding his distressed cries of "non mangiare!" Cescon convincingly renders Sonia's desperate, physical hungershe sinks her teeth into a raw onion that appears to her as a plump chicken drumstick, and in the forbidden bite that precipitates the inevitable tragic climax, gives in to a glistening forkful of fettuccine.
An undercurrent of gallows humor ripples through the film, but Garrone's main objectivewhich he only partly accomplishesis to tap into the emotional truth of a tabloid scenario. Probing the trust-based power games of a sadomasochistic dynamic, the movie is a reasonably thoughtful study of obsessive lovethe sweeping orchestral score is presumably meant to induce Vertigo . But Garrone glibly locates the key to Vittorio's psychology in his professionhis voice-over repeatedly equates his girlfriend with a gold ingot, an object to be smelted and reduced: "Remove everything . . . only what's precious remains." The cruel, foreshadowed punchlinearrived at perhaps too easilyis that compulsive whittling leaves you not with an essential, ineffable something but with absolutely nothing.
