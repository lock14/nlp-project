         Sylvester Stallone, Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger. The 1980s saw an explosion of butt-kicking in America, observes Christopher Bell in the raucously funny and surprisingly insightful prologue to his debut documentary, "Bigger, Stronger, Faster*." And as a 12-year-old kid from a loving but undeniably short and doughy family in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,  Bell and his brothers were particularly susceptible to the message. As  he reminds us, the don't-mess-with-the-U.S. Reagan years were an overheated response to '70s downers such as the Iran hostage crisis. But for the Bell boys, it was simply a call to ripped, bulging arms.
 
 What began simply as a documentary about steroid use in America, "Bigger, Stronger, Faster*" (The asterisk refers to the movie's subtitle: "The Side-Effects of Being American") turns out to be a surprisingly comprehensive and insightful look at a culture predicated on might and obsessed with achieving success at any cost. This, more than rampant steroid use among professional athletes, is what makes Bell's documentary so timely and ultimately so sobering. What Bell and co-writers and producers Alex Buono (who also shot the movie) and Tamsin Rawady discover -- through countless hours of interviews, news, movie and cartoon footage as well as  home video of the Bell family -- is a country in which it's literally impossible to win if one plays by the rules, because winners almost always cheat.
 


         






   For Chris Bell, the only Bell brother not on steroids, the discovery that his heroes -- Arnold, Sly, the Hulkster -- all relied on performance enhancers to get where they got came as a shock and a letdown. Coupled with the fact that his brothers' experiences reinforce the notion that giving up steroids would effectively remove them from various athletic pursuits, he grapples with the issue of whether it's better to play fair and lose or join the club for a fighting chance. It's an issue close to all three brothers' hearts as they grew up struggling with feelings of inadequacy that haunt the eldest brother, Mad Dog, to this day. (Mad Dog's failure to make it in  pro wrestling led to a serious problem with drugs and alcohol.)
 
 Yet while Bell still considers the use of steroids in professional sports cheating, he is more incensed by Congress seemingly spending more time debating steroid use in baseball than discussing Hurricane Katrina or the war in Iraq.
 
 "Bigger, Stronger, Faster*" works so assiduously to prove that the level playing field is a myth that at times the sheer number of examples threatens to overwhelm it; it would have worked at half the size. (Like the nation, it's a documentary on steroids.) Overall, though, it's a fascinating and unexpectedly profound and melancholy meditation on what we have become as a country and on the misguided obsessions that made us this way.

A good documentary will take you places you didn't plan to go, but I didn't really expect that from Bigger, Stronger, Faster , an incisive and compulsively watchable look at America's love affair with steroids. The film kicks off with a montage of the cheesetastic stars of the 1980s. There's a pile-driving Hulk Hogan, a bare-torsoed Sly Stallone strafing his enemies in Rambo , and Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his veiny, condom-filled-with-coconuts biceps. These ripped and snarling muscleheads incarnated the new, pumped-up American might of the Reagan era, with Gold's Gym in L.A. as their training mecca, and Christopher Bell, the director of Bigger, Stronger, Faster , lets us know how much they meant to him as a kid. Of course, two of them (Stallone is the exception) have since admitted to using anabolic steroids  i.e., synthetic testosterone. By the time Bell shows us Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa smashing home runs, I'm thinking: Okay, we get it! Steroids are a lie! They turned the USA into a land of fraudulent jock kings!
The truth, according to the movie, is more complicated  and fascinating. Hooked on their image of hard-muscled potency, Bell and his two brothers, all of whom tended toward the tubby, became bodybuilders. Both the brothers embraced steroids, and the film presents them, with touching candor, as broken and desperate men, eager to escape suburban banality through their addiction to the vanity of power and size. Yet just when Bigger, Stronger, Faster  looks like it will turn into an exposé of the evils of steroid use, the film takes a surprise turn. It admits that using steroids is ''cheating,'' but it also says that steroids have been demonized  turned into a scapegoat for a society that craves...more .
The movie traces their use in athletics back to the 1950s, when they were given (in secret) to American Olympic teams to compete with the Soviets, who were already using them. Bell piles up compelling evidence that the drugs' hazards and side effects, from 'roid rage to liver damage, have been overstated by the media in Reefer Madness  fashion. (We see hilarious clips from a cautionary 1994 Ben Affleck TV episode.) He poses the questions: Why is steroid use frowned upon  but sleeping in a high-altitude chamber to raise a bike racer's blood-oxygen level okay? Why is Tiger Woods' LASIK surgery, which gave him close to perfect vision, an acceptable performance enhancement? As a filmmaker, Bell has guts. He faces down the disgraced Olympic sprinter Ben Johnson, and he takes on the $24 billion body-supplement industry, a snake-oil empire in which ''Before'' and ''After'' photos are shot the same day. Not to mention the use of cortisone shots in locker rooms; the classical musicians who ease their performance anxiety with beta-blockers; and a dozen other examples. ''There's a clash in America,'' says Bell, ''between doing the right thing and being the best.'' Bigger, Stronger, Faster  is a portrait of a culture that claims to hate steroids but may, by now, be too pumped to do much about it.


 Just when Christopher Bell’s  documentary, “Bigger, Stronger, Faster*,” seems content to be an entertaining exploration of his and his two brothers’ use of anabolic steroids, it turns a corner and plunges into deeper waters. It happens when Mr. Bell, who narrates the film in the jocular first-person style of Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock, reflects on steroid use as a metaphor for modern American life. Are steroids un-American, as Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. is heard to say? Or are they as American as apple pie?  How do you reconcile the imperative drilled into children by parents, teachers and the news media that winning is everything with the increasingly quaint moral injunctions to play fair, exercise good sportsmanship and do the right thing? If your childhood idols are preening supermen like Hulk Hogan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who preached clean living but revealed their own reliance on steroids,  which path are you likely to follow?  To an impressionable boy, the spectacularly muscular superhero is an irresistible role model. What shy youngster confronted with Superman doesn’t fantasize about changing into a skintight blue suit and transforming into the Man of Steel? The movie shows the evolution of the G.I. Joe action figure from a fit soldier into a mountainous,  V-shaped hulk, an increasingly achievable ideal, thanks to steroids.  The movie ponders the question of what constitutes cheating  when you look objectively at the role of medicine in competitive sport.  Is it cheating for a bicycle racer to pump more oxygen into his system by sleeping in a high-altitude chamber? Has Tiger Woods’s Lasik eye surgery given him an unfair competitive advantage? The lines between cheating and fair play, the movie suggests, are hazy to the point of being arbitrary. Pharmaceutical enhancement extends even to the sedate world of classical music, in which musicians susceptible to stage fright consume beta blockers to keep them calm.  In some areas, the film suggests, deception is more the rule than the exception. You have to take on faith the claims of the unregulated food supplement industry, in which a pinch of this and a pinch of that is often added to useless filler. We learn that in fitness industry advertising, before and after pictures are often shot on the same day, then doctored.  The bottom line in the debate is the sprinter Ben Johnson’s rationale for using steroids, which cost him his 1988 Olympic 100-meter title: Everybody does it.  “Bigger, Stronger, Faster*” methodically examines the history of performance enhancement in sports, concentrating on the years since the mid-1950s when a physician for the United States weight lifting team observed Soviet athletes being given injections. Almost immediately the American pharmaceutical industry began work on developing an oral anabolic steroid, Dianabol, for American athletes.  Now and again the movie circles back to the poignant stories of Mr. Bell and his siblings, who, growing up in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,  took up weight lifting and strength training to help overcome feelings of inadequacy because of a family tendency toward obesity.  Mr. Bell, a power lifter who is the smallest of the three (and has written television segments for World Wrestling Entertainment),  used to take anabolic steroids but,  unlike his siblings, has sworn them off. His older brother, Mike  Bell, nicknamed Mad Dog, who as an overweight boy was tauntingly labeled Pugsley, took up weight lifting and became captain of the high school football team. In college, when he discovered  that he was no longer his team’s biggest and strongest  player, he gave up football for wrestling.  Since then Mike Bell has obsessively pursued his dream of becoming a World Wrestling Entertainment star, and once became so frustrated that he attempted suicide. His declaration that he can’t bear the idea of not being a star is the film’s saddest moment.  The youngest brother, Mark  Bell (nicknamed Smelly), grew up with a learning disability but developed self-esteem as a power lifter. He gave up pursuing a career as a pro wrestler after marrying and becoming a father. But he continues to take steroids (to his wife’s chagrin) and enter weight lifting exhibitions.  The movie questions stories about the horrors of steroid abuse. The explosive aggression known as “ ’roid rage” is largely a myth, several experts insist. A hilarious excerpt from a 1994 television movie starring Ben Affleck as a steroid-using high school football player gone berserk is compared to the marijuana scare movie “Reefer Madness.”  The filmmaker interviews a man in Houston who blames steroids for his 17-year-old son’s suicide, and a San Francisco AIDS patient who was wasting away until he began taking steroids. The movie doubts the football star Lyle Alzado’s assertion that the brain tumor from which he died in 1992 at  43 was caused by steroids. Although the movie doesn’t defend steroid use, neither does it go on the attack.  “Bigger, Stronger, Faster*” left me convinced that the steroid scandals will abate as the drugs are reluctantly accepted as inevitable products of  a continuing revolution in biotechnology. Replaceable body parts, plastic surgery, anti-depressants, Viagra and steroids are just a few of the technological advancements in a never-ending drive to make the species superhuman.

Call it �Super Size Me� on steroids: Christopher Bell�s in-depth, yet intensely personal look at juice use among athletes attacks America�s body-image obsession from the other side. Pic personifies the debate by focusing on the filmmaker�s two steroid-pumping siblings, but this isn�t amateur hour with the Bell family. Helmer knows exactly what he�s doing, offering a thorough survey backed by no-nonsense interviews from every corner of the issue. More scrupulously reported than your average Michael Moore film but every bit as entertaining, �Bigger, Stronger, Faster*� is as commercial as documentaries come -- a no-brainer to market in light of recent sports scandals.
Baseball record-breakers Barry Bonds and Jose Canseco and Olympian Marion Jones are only three of the many high-profile national heroes to fall under the cloud of steroids, but Bell�s disillusionments trace back to childhood, when such super-ripped role models as Hulk Hogan, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger fessed to injecting their way to fame. 
Bell opens with a series of rhetorical questions meant to reflect his own internal debate over the issue: Namely, why should he feel guilty about using steroids when everybody�s doing it?
And therein lies the paradox. Americans set impossible performance standards but reject the �cheating� required to achieve them (making exceptions for Viagra, Adderall, beta blockers and other non-natural aids). Bell is clearly torn on the issue of steroids, having experimented with them himself at one time (he�s fallen back on a smorgasbord of legal supplements for now). 
But to better understand the alternative, he turns to his brothers: �Mad Dog� (Mike) started shooting steroids in college and found them essential to his goal of pro wrestling, while �Smelly� (Mark) takes powerlifting too seriously not to maximize his potential through artificial means. Both siblings are completely candid about their dependence on the substance.
The discussion ranges from politics to science to pop culture, implicating everyone from George W. Bush (as former owner of the Texas Rangers) to Ben Affleck (star of a �Reefer Madness�-style movie of the week). He confronts both Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis about the former�s gold-medal disqualification at the 1988 Summer Olympics, despite both runners testing positive for banned substances.
Though Bell avoids the Morgan Spurlock stunt of serving as his own guinea pig, helmer�s presence permeates the film. Whether speaking to grieving father Donald Hooton (who believes steroids drove his 17-year-old son to suicide, despite convincing evidence that anti-depressants may have been the culprit) or his own mother, he�s not afraid to ask the tough questions. The range of interviewees is staggering, and though Schwarzenegger declines to be interviewed, Bell secures a priceless one-on-one opportunity all the same.
At 106 minutes, the film is long, but never dull. Its early playfulness (augmented by retro-styled animation and the tongue-in-cheek use of tracks such as �Eye of the Tiger� and �Holding Out for a Hero�) blooms into poignant observation as the investigation takes shape. 



My first boyfriend was a juicer. Steroids were the drug of choice at my high school, having somehow washed into the Canadian suburbs in the early '90s on the same raft as Dee-lite and crushed-velvet dresses. As described in Christopher Bell 's scrappy, remarkably expansive, crazily watchable documentary, Bigger, Stronger, Faster* , a similar phenomenon played out in his hometown of Poughkeepsie . Beginning with a Spurlockian account of his upbringing as the second of three sons who all loved the WWF, worshipped Rambo , and developed distorted body images, Bell spirals outward into the culture of outrageous expectations fostered through the '80s and beyond, and the resultant generation of should-be-average Joes who believe that greatness is their birthright. For the Bell brothers, that meant transforming their genetically rotund physiques into bloated beefcake with steroids. Having avoided the havoc that the drugs wreaked on his brothers, Christopher sets out to interrogate the politics of "cheating" in sports (though the vast majority of users are not pro athletes), the disputed dangers of juicing (the pro-steroid testimonials are a marvel of rationalization, while the evidence of their side effects—including suicidal depression—is evidenced in a father's heartbreak), and the grotesquerie of the supplements and pharmaceutical industry, which has sprung up to exploit not just male inadequacy, but the tragic, grasping, relentless dissatisfaction of an entire nation. Bell finds the epitome of that tragedy in his own family and, in his first film, digs unflinchingly at its roots. Like Bell, my high-school boyfriend became obsessed with body-building; like Bell, he wanted to be as big and strong as his older brother. Like Bell, he'd be 33 years old today, had he not taken his life at the age of 28.
