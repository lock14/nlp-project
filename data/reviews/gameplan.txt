How�s this for a movie slogan: �The Rock Cries!� Maybe it doesn�t have the same ring to it that �Garbo Laughs!� did when Ninotchka
 was first released in 1939, but dammit if it isn�t something remarkable seeing a professional wrestler � that rare breed of performer practiced exclusively in the art of solipsistic Sturm und Drang � put away his muscles and turn on the waterworks. It�s like watching middle-American machismo itself wilt in your hand. The reason the Rock is crying is because he�s playing a self-centered superstar football quarterback named Joe Kingman whose perfectly empty, materialistic little life is being turned upside down by an 8-year-old daughter he didn�t know he had. Little Peyton (the absurdly doe-eyed Pettis) is infiltrating his Boston penthouse apartment, messing with his stereo settings, scaring away his dates, and generally making a mockery of his bachelor�s paradise. And despite all his years as a sports hero, Kingman isn�t exactly trained to look after a precocious little girl who�s more interested in ballet than forward passes and who has her mind set on turning this cold mountain of a man into a loving dad. But he�s got her for a month, like it or not, and no amount of eye-bulging, shirt-ripping, or muscle-flexing is going to make her go away. The Game Plan
 was written by two women, Nichole Millard and Kathryn Price, and their female take on the world of professional football � though ridiculous � gives their movie a comic flavor that is refreshingly free of the masculine chest-bumping that defines other football films (and football in general). The movie�s locker-room scenes (usually bastions of misogyny and towel-snapping homoeroticism, undeclared) are a woman�s fantasy of what constitutes a football team: two dozen sweet, sensitive, smiling, muscular metrosexuals in extremely tight pants who�d rather spend their time at the ballet or engaging in the occasional giggling water-gun fight than snorting cocaine or sleeping around. So the movie�s got something new and different going for it. Not much, but something, and it�s just enough to keep you interested and vulnerable so that when the syrup starts to pour, you realize too late � like an insect in a pitcher plant � that you�re unable to squirm your way free and run for the hills. Which is exactly what happened to me. Like some sentimental fool, I allowed Johnson�s good-hearted buffoonery and Pettis� overpowering sweetness and Millard and Price�s unwavering belief in the healing power of love to get the better of my senses and travel straight past my brain to my heart. I�ve been got and I�ve been had. And I admit that with all due shame and humiliation. I�ll never forgive myself for this.


With "The Game Plan," Boston gets a piece of The Rock. The pro wrestler's transformation into a movie star is just about complete and it's reflected in his billing: these days he's Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in the same way Johnny Cougar became John Cougar Mellencamp before settling into plain old John Mellencamp.
None of it would work if Dwayne, Rock - whatever - weren't such a sweetie pie. He's Arnold Schwarzenegger without the glower, and while he'll never be mistaken for Olivier, his quick smile and willingness to play along make him by far the most likable of modern movie muscleheads.
He's thus one of the reasons to see "The Game Plan." For local audiences, Boston's the other reason. Taking place in a bright, shallow Chamber of Commerce version of our town, the movie's appallingly formulaic family fare but it's so good-natured you don't much mind, and there's the guilty pleasure of seeing Boston the way the tourists from Ohio do: scullers on the Charles, the Summer Street bridge, the Custom House tower, the Barking Crab restaurant. The movie does everything short of stand on the Common and ask where the State House is.
Actually, "The Game Plan" takes place in an alterna-Hub, where the Patriots and Tom Brady don't exist. Instead, there's a red-garbed team called the Boston Rebels playing out at Foxborough, and their quarterback is a preening Namath-style superstar named Joe Kingman (The Rock). Joe loves himself so much that his vanity passes through offensiveness and comes out charming; anyway, you know he's riding for a fall because you've seen "Kindergarten Cop," "The Pacifier," and "Daddy Day Care."
At his door one day arrives a little girl named Peyton (Madison Pettis), the 7-year-old daughter of an early marriage that went bust. Why has Joe never heard of her? The movie works overtime to explain that one, but it's immaterial. Big jock/cute kid is all you need to know.
Mom's apparently doing relief work in the Sudan and is conveniently unreachable, so Peyton moves in with Joe, frightening his agent (Kyra Sedgwick, making her character nastier than she probably needs to be), charming his teammates, and applying plastic rhinestones to his Armani suits. The trite screenplay overdoes it on the precocious grown-up dialogue for the little girl, but Pettis is a natural, and the scene in which she and Joe's Russian supermodel girlfriend (Kate Nauta) size each other up has a kick worthy of "All About Eve."
Peyton's also a student ballerina, which gives "The Game Plan" an excuse to shoot at the Boston Ballet School and feature local young dancers as extras. More important, it means The Rock has to put on a leotard and dance in a production with the school's lissome teacher (Roselyn Sanchez). "You're a freakishly large man and you're telling me you're incapable of playing a tree?" she asks early on. Lady, he's called The Rock for a reason.
How obvious is "The Game Plan"? Joe has a pet bulldog, and director Andy Fickman cuts to a reaction shot of the mutt every bloody chance he gets. How conflicted is it? The movie delivers an anti-product endorsement message while cramming in shots of Coke cans, Dunkin' Donuts cups, and Disney TV shows. I get enough of "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody" at home, thanks.
Still, it's painless, especially if you have a small child in tow, and the Rock, bless his heart, acts like it's all new to him. (He must not be able to hear Nathan Wang's overbearing musical score, which underlines every plot turn with a blunt crayon.) The star should do more comedy - he's got quick reflexes and a face that lends itself to cartoon double takes, and he's not afraid to look completely ridiculous.
Above all, he steers clear of attempting a Boston accent. Maybe he's smarter than he looks.


Having tamed one muscled man-child (Vin Diesel in The Pacifier ), Disney sets its sights on The Rock. He preens winningly in The Game Plan  as Joe Kingman, a star quarterback with the kind of empty, Sharper Image-bachelor-pad life guys are supposed to crave, then deplore on cue when an adorable child (Madison Pettis) arrives. Said kid is Kingman's daughter (surprise result of some long-forgotten sayonara sex), and, oddly, she's not such a handful. The lesson seems to be, ''Think you can't have it all? You can!'' Which, as we know, is what parenting is all about.


Every bit as formulaic as its generic ad art suggests, "The Game Plan" sticks close to the playbook for family-friendly laffers about self-absorbed workaholics suddenly saddled with parental responsibilities. Still, overworked formulas can prove mighty potent with the right ingredient in the mix. Wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is the most valuable player here, revealing impressive comic chops and megawatt charisma even while serving as a human punchline for many of the pic's predictable sight gags. Thanks primarily to his game performance, "Game Plan" could score big in theatrical arenas and homevid playoffs. 
Johnson strikes a winning balance of swagger, exasperation and sensitivity as Joe Kingman, superstar quarterback for the Boston Rebels. (The absence of any real-life NFL teams and events -- such as, for example, the Super Bowl -- is glaringly conspicuous in a pic otherwise peppered with product placements.) An avid fan of Elvis Presley, whose image and music loom large in his lavish bachelor pad, Kingman has appropriated the nickname of the King, and earns the title each Sunday with inspired (albeit selfish) gridiron performances. Fans love him, women want him, teammates appreciate him and endorsement contracts enrich him. Life is good.
But the sure-shot quarterback is thrown for a loop when eight-year-old Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) shows up at his front door and introduces herself as the daughter he never knew he had. She's the product of Kingman's fleeting marriage to a woman who -- according to the child -- is conveniently abroad for four weeks. And she's been sent to her father -- again, according to Peyton -- for some long-overdue bonding.
The truth behind Peyton's transparent scam -- well, transparent to everyone but the other characters onscreen for the first 80 or so minutes -- is no more credible than her cover story.
But never mind: Helmer Andy Fickman and scripters Nichole Millard and Kathryn Price intro the contrivances merely as an excuse to concentrate on much more important stuff -- stuff like splattering a well-appointed kitchen with goop tossed by an uncovered blender. Or outfitting Kingman's beloved pet bulldog with a tutu. Or placing Kingman in the middle of a ballet school production of "Swan Lake." Johnson remains a good sport and a first-rate farceur while charting Kingman's by-the-numbers evolution from cocksure egotist to tender loving daddy (and, just as important, less-selfish team player). As Peyton, Pettis relies too heavily on squeaky-voiced, scrunchy-faced cutie-pie shtick, but that's probably what got her cast in the first place.
Supporting performances range from competent to cartoonish, with Morris Chestnut coming down on the side of recognizable human behavior as Kingman's wise wide receiver, and Kyra Sedgwick overplaying to the cheap seats while wearing makeup that indicates a recent Kabuki gig. Hayes Macarthur is almost too convincing as a dimwitted player. As Kingman's coach, Gordon Clapp fleetingly registers authority in a role that apparently was decimated in the editing room.
Way overlong at 110 minutes, which gives the aud too much time to note narrative gaps and logical inconsistencies, "The Game Plan" nonetheless features a polished tech package. Production designer David J. Bomba wittily underscores the empty lavishness of Kingman's pre-Peyton lifestyle. And, of course, the soundtrack is full of Elvis Presley standards, including one amusingly warbled by Johnson himself.
