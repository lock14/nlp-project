Let's face it. Now is probably not the time for the movie about a Red Sox fanatic who fatally hits a 10-year-old boy then speeds off. But is there ever a good time for that movie, especially one as cheap as "Reservation Road"? The film is a dead-child drama that devolves into a parental revenge thriller that happens to be set during those happy fall baseball days of 2004.
Professor Ethan Learner (Joaquin Phoenix), his wife, Grace (Jennifer Connelly), and their daughter, Emma (Elle Fanning), are on the way home from a delightful evening of watching their cello prodigy son perform at a concert. Meanwhile, Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo), a private practice lawyer, and his son, Lucas (Eddie Alderson), have to cut out of Fenway Park early to get the boy home to Connecticut before Dwight's ex-wife, Ruth (Mira Sorvino), berates him for missing his deadline.
He's flying down Reservation Road when he swerves into the Learners' son, who had been releasing fireflies from a jar during a gas station bathroom stop. Dwight brakes for a moment, but keeps going - one minute late and the ex will have a nuclear meltdown. She does anyway after she sees the black eye Lucas sustained in the accident.
It's a terrible day for the Learners. And one wracked with guilt for Dwight, who spends the movie in a moral pickle: turn himself in or not? Ruffalo does a yeoman job of dramatizing unimaginable stress. Ethan grows dissatisfied with the pace of the police investigation, so he hires attorneys to prod the cops. Guess whose firm he uses and guess who's put on the case. The movie has a few more coinkydinks like that. Not to mention the worst scene I've ever seen set in a college seminar. Ethan's students debate whether people in Connecticut suffer more than people in Africa or the Middle East.
This might be the sort of reductive relativism you'd expect from Terry George, the director of "Hotel Rwanda." There's probably a way to philosophize the idea that the privileged lack the capacity for true grief, but George, who adapted "Reservation Road" with John Burnham Schwartz from Schwartz's novel, seems to prefer juicing up a movie until it becomes a formulaic potboiler, just as he did with his film about the Rwandan genocide.
Ethan is consumed with rage and suspicion. He conducts an Internet search that brings him to helpful sites ("Things You Might Not Know About Fatal Hit-and-Run Accidents") and leads to a chat room for parents who've lost children in such tragedies. (Each chatter's name appears next a photo of the dead child.) Eventually, he buys a gun. Phoenix makes the descent convincing. Even if the performance blows all its gaskets in the last 20 minutes you can see a parent's sense of loss turning him into a justice-seeking madman. Connelly is marvelous as his rational counterpoint: Her character shares Ethan's pain, but should this death take the life out of the rest of the family?
The real problem with this movie isn't its trashy side - the "Death Wish" stuff is actually suspenseful. It's the creepy note of causal judgment that hangs over it concerning the potential nightmare of parental visitation and enforcer ex-wives (Sorvino's gentle performance actually cuts the character some slack). The Learners (that name!) are a perfect, scholarly, Volvo-driving clan whose lives are shattered by the spineless, divorced sports-nut lawyer in an SUV.


         Neither involving as a study in grief nor compelling as a thriller about conscience, the cat-and-mouse tragedy "Reservation Road" is a misery windup so schematic and obvious it reduces its crisis-stricken characters to little more than emotional bumper cars.
 
 Based on a 1998 novel by John Burnham Schwartz, who adapted it with director Terry George, the Connecticut-set film quickly gets to its defining moment: a fatal hit-and-run. Night falls when divorced dad Dwight (Mark Ruffalo) is rushing to the house of his fed-up ex-wife (Mira Sorvino) to return their son Lucas (Eddie Alderson) after a late-ending Boston Red Sox game. At the same time, Ethan and Grace Learner (Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly) are returning home from a cello recital featuring their 10-year-old son, Josh, when they stop at a secluded gas station on a wooded stretch of road. In a life-changing flash, Dwight's barreling SUV accidentally kills Josh as he stands by the road, and in a panic Dwight drives off, leaving Ethan -- who saw the collision -- in a state of horror over the sudden loss of his son and bewildered anger over a callously anonymous driver.
 


         






   What follows is a meager back-and-forth as the two dads grapple on parallel tracks with the ramifications of the event. Ethan allows his mourning to morph into a sleepless obsession with catching his son's killer at the expense of his wife's desire to move on and the authorities' floundering investigation. Dwight, meanwhile, feels the tug of confession even as he sinks deeper into the moral abyss of covering up his crime in the hopes of continuing with the one thing he cherishes: his relationship with his own son.
 
 The emotional turbulence, however, is given only a surface examination by the unimaginative script and direction. Director George, whose tragedy-concentrated "Hotel Rwanda" was a fortunate case of shattering truth and rich performances overpowering pedestrian filmmaking, is at a loss to find meaning in this grim story's forced contrivances. Grief has rarely seemed so ordinary.
 
 The cast should have been a boon. Phoenix has an anguish-ready countenance -- a hunched melancholy like a needy animal -- that's the most suitably nervy element to the film's efforts to mine the dark side of coping. But that doesn't mean it's an illuminating performance, just solid and expected. The same goes for Connelly, who's been banking hollowed-out portrayals as if they were going out of style.
 
 Ruffalo's dilemma, on the other hand, is thornier. He has a harder time meshing his ability to find soulful nuance in Dwight's pressurized situation with George's sloppy, in-your-face camera placement and hurried tone. The single-minded direction and editing never leave the movie's best actor alone long enough to make an impact beyond scared glances, which then strain the credibility of the all-important suspense angle.

Bad things happen and terrible choices are made in the very sad, very nerve-racking, very good melodrama Reservation Road . And there's no way to talk about the value of enduring the pain without describing something, however minimal, of what happens. This isn't a quandary for those already familiar with the fine, tight 1998 novel by John Burnham Schwartz, with its bitter epigraph from the Book of Job and its shuffling narrators. But what about for those who have never read it? What if I say that there's a hit-and-run car accident, a dead son, and a grieving father, plus a driver who's a father with a son of his own? What if I add that there's a remarkable climax  is that enough?
It'll have to be. The net of dramatic coincidences, of bold choices acted upon or not, based on dumb good or bad luck, tugs tightest on those with little preparation. Anyhow, even readers in the know will be surprised by tweaks made by the novelist and director Terry George (Hotel Rwanda ), who co-wrote the screenplay. Expanded and amped up to fill a screen, this Reservation Road  invites an audience comfortable with the sophisticated anxieties of Todd Field's Little Children  and, especially, In the Bedroom  to consider what it takes to go on living in the face of unbearable tragedy. To keep a family from blowing apart in the aftermath. To be a man. And to do so in manicured Connecticut, the proud address of so many potentially lethal SUVs.
To be sure, Joaquin Phoenix (as the grieving dad, Ethan, a college professor) and Mark Ruffalo (as the guilty dad, Dwight, a lawyer) make male pain rewarding as a spectator sport; they're actors who specialize in conveying inarticulate conflict and buried anger, and the wonder is that the two haven't been paired before, so perfectly does each actor's dark, dense presence meet  and challenge  the other man's interior restlessness and moist, hurting eyes. Jennifer Connelly plays a murmuring, supportive role as Ethan's equally grieving but less emotionally jammed up wife (they're also parents of a little girl played by Elle Fanning  like her older sister, Dakota, a champion screamer), and Mira Sorvino is subtle as Dwight's ex-wife, mother of Dwight's son, Lucas (newcomer Eddie Alderson). But this is a man's tale of justice pursued. And the Belfast-born George, who, in screenplays including The Boxer  and In the Name of the Father , specializes in dark-eyed guys ready to rumble, knows what the playing field should look like.
It ain't pretty, even with Connecticut plates. Yet there's a kind of tough beauty to this deft, satisfying thriller.

 The tears and the blame mix uneasily in “Reservation Road,” a grim, mechanistic thriller about death and suffering, life and healing among the civilized. Based on a well-received novel by John Burnham Schwartz, who shares screenwriting credit with the film’s director, Terry George, this is one of those sadistic exercises that puts its characters through the wringer without saying anything true or meaningful, like what it takes to get out of bed those mornings when you think the sun will never again rise with you.  Crying at the movies can be intensely satisfying, but you need to feel as if your tears have been justly earned. It may be reassuring, a pleasant lie, to think that better filmmakers appeal to our emotions, not merely prey on them, but the great directors need hearts of killers and stone-cold calculation to have their way with us successfully. It takes a talent for murder for a director to rip out our insides, to show us a beloved young son turned into so much road kill in front of his father. But it takes a true sense of cinema to ensure that we don’t hate the movie and its maker for doing that to these characters and to us.  Mr. George has neither enough ice in his veins nor the filmmaking skill to pull off the wretched business of sacrificing a child for a fictional contrivance. He made me tear up while watching this movie, but he also made me grit my teeth. He did more honest work in “Hotel Rwanda,” a drama about that country’s tribal genocide, which clearly stirred him. His heart is in the right place in this new film too, but the novel’s moral complexity trips him up, as does its scale. The death of a child is a tragedy in close-up, but the death of hundreds of thousands of children is so overwhelming it forces us to step back. We think about the horror (or we flee), not just feel it.  “Reservation Road” hasn’t been made for contemplation. It’s a blunt instrument: crudely plotted, badly acted, simple-minded, unpleasant. The child, 10-year-old Josh (Sean Curley), dies shortly after the film opens — as well as in the tell-all trailers — in front of his horrified father, Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix). The hit-and-run killer, Dwight (Mark Ruffalo), slows down but doesn’t stop, and keeps on going and going through one improbable narrative turn after another. As the police investigation drags on, and Ethan’s wife, Grace (Jennifer Connelly), tries to manage her grief, Ethan starts searching, first for comfort, then the killer. He drops into survivor chat rooms and then, in a grave screenwriting mistake, hires Dwight’s law firm.  In his novel Mr. Schwartz separates the three main characters psychologically and emotionally, more or less existentially segregating them by chapter. The film jettisons this fractured pattern and brings the three directly into play with one another through  didactic editing and coincidence. It’s no longer enough that Dwight has a son about the same age as the dead boy, or that his former wife (Mira Sorvino) gives Ethan and Grace’s  daughter piano lessons, as she does in the novel. Ethan now has to shake Dwight’s hand and solicit his help. Instead of confronting his crime in searching solitude, Dwight now looks into the face of fatherly anguish, mainly, it seems, so he can feel the necessary trauma in turn.  The film’s insistence on turning Dwight, a volatile man of uncertain character on the page, into a weak-willed but essentially decent and loving father on the screen, smacks of the worst kind of moviemaking compromise. Did the filmmakers think we couldn’t handle something darker, a little moral complication, an unattractive lead character? Did the studio suits? The casting of Mr. Ruffalo, an appealing actor whose yielding face seems to plead for forgiveness even when there’s nothing to forgive, feels particularly calculating, designed to make Dwight seem less troubling and less dark. Curiously, Mr. Phoenix makes Ethan so rigid with loss that the character comes across as more unyielding and demented than crazed by sorrow, which adds one of the few moments of ambiguity in an otherwise  obvious work.  “Reservation Road” wants to say something about grief, wrath and vengeance, which suggests that it’s angling for some kind of post-Sept. 11 relevance.  But its insistence on turning Ethan and Dwight into equals — both loving fathers, both racked  with pain — flattens the story’s ambitions. (Surely Dwight fled the scene not simply because he wanted to protect his own child from harm.) The film tries to draw parallels between the two with maddeningly schematic editing: one man walks up to his front door; there’s a cut and the other man walks inside his house. All we learn from these forced connections is that these two men enter their homes through their front doors. The entranceways to their deeper selves remain shut tight.  “Reservation Road” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Death leads to expletives and a brandished gun.

A dramatic situation that should be wrenching is mostly tedious in "Reservation Road." Tale of two New England fathers, one of whom kills the other's son in a hit-and-run auto accident and takes the entire picture to fess up to it, deals with painful, elemental emotions, to be sure. But the film has no special insight into the psyches of either man, or into the broader issues of how to process profound loss or admit culpability for a heinous act. As pic offers scant emotional rewards or catharsis, it's hard to imagine auds flocking to this downbeat drama in any significant numbers.
Novel by John Burnham Schwartz, who is credited with the adaptation along with director Terry George, was well received in 1998, and has been updated mainly to place the action simultaneously with the Boston Red Sox's successful World Series drive in 2004 -- the only upbeat aspect of the story.
The central tragedy, presented in the opening minutes, thereafter hangs over the characters like a black shroud. On the way home from an outdoor student concert late one summer evening, 10-year-old Josh Learner, son of Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix) and Grace (Jennifer Connelly) and brother of Emma (Elle Fanning), is accidently hit near a gas station along a rural Connecticut road. Behind the wheel of the Ford Explorer is Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo), who's racing back from Fenway Park to drop son Lucas (Eddie Alderson) at the home of his impatient ex, Ruth (Mira Sorvino).
Realizing he's hit something in the dark, Dwight instinctively hesitates, then continues on, as he's already nervous about being late. Back at the station, the Learners' devastation is awful, yet predictable in its appalling emotion; after all, how many different ways are there to dramatize such a scene?
Similarly familiar are the scenes of family grieving, the funeral, anger, guilt, sleeplessness, recriminations and growing husband-wife estrangement as they try to cope in different ways, Grace by working her way through it and Ethan by becoming obsessed with achieving justice by any means necessary.
In the story's great coincidence, when Ethan goes to hire a local attorney to help him with his case, the man he is assigned is -- Dwight himself. The way he's presented here, Dwight is such a screw-up -- as a husband, father and member of society -- that it's hard to believe he made it through law school and can hold down such a job. He just does manage to hold it together while speaking professionally with the distraught Ethan.
But when it becomes clear that Dwight doesn't intend to just get it over with and do the right thing -- he does try to turn himself in once, but the police are too busy to listen to him -- the whole film becomes a waiting game for the inevitable confrontation between the two men once the cards are all on the table. Unfortunately, it's far longer in coming than it should be, with little edification offered in the interim.
The talented thesps all work up a sweat portraying their characters' pent-up tension and anger, resulting in performances that are intense, overwrought and on the nose, with no surprises. Story is so single-mindedly about timidity (Dwight) and anger (Ethan) and nothing else that it quickly grows tiresome.
One specific shortcoming is the way it depicts Red Sox mania; as die-hard Boston fans, Dwight and his son should be brimming with anxiety and excitement as the playoffs and series progress -- they follow them on television -- but the games don't seem to quicken their pulses even a bit.
Pic does benefit from actual Connecticut locations.

I gave up after about 100 pages of John Burnham Schwartz 's 1998 novel Reservation Road , a typically overwritten and contrived slice of mass-market literary pablum that hopscotches between the points-of-view of three peoplethe grieving mom, the grieving dad, and the perpetrator involved in the hit-and-run death of a 10-year-old boy on the titular stretch of Connecticut blacktop. I wanted to give up on director Terry George 's new film version even sooner, pretty much right from its picture-postcard opening images of sailboats on late-summer water, Red Sox fans cheering the team through the 2004 post-season, and smiling suburban families enjoying a children's concert in an inviting park. These peoplecall them "ordinary," if you willare much too happy for something awful not to befall them before the first reel is over; and George, who previously directed the equally crude and obvious Hotel Rwanda , is far too clumsy a filmmaker to disguise his true intentions.
Yes, Reservation Road  is one of those movies where the characters suffer early and often. This starts the moment that lawyer Dwight Arno  (Mark Ruffalo ) plows his SUV into the body of Josh Learner  (Sean Curley ) outside of a roadside gas station while the boy's parents, college professor Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix ) and wife Grace (Jennifer Connelly ), look on in helpless horror. Dwight, who's carrying a roof-rack worth of emotional baggagecontentious ex (Mira Sorvino ), 11-year-old son (Eddie Alderson ) caught in the crossfirestops for a second, then thinks better (or worse) of it and speeds off into the darkness. By the time, a few scenes later, that Ethan unknowingly hires Dwight to be his advocate in the ongoing search for his son's killer, you may rightly start to wonder if perhaps John Burnham Schwartz (who shares screenplay credit with George) is not just a flowery nom de plume  for one Paul Haggis .
Will Dwight's guilty conscience speak up before Ethan figures things out and goes all Jodie Foster  on him? While we await the answer with something less than breathless anticipation, the bathos piles up like autumn leaves. Scenes invariably begin or end with someone crying, blaming himself/herself for events beyond his/her control (Ethan for his son's death, Grace for Ethan's limp dick in the sack), and other assorted hysterics. Still to come: the obligatory Googling of victim-support groups; the gruff indifference of the police; the mildewed bromides about how violence begets violence; and, in one particularly rancid attempt at post-9/11 "relevance," a sequence in which Ethan takes to stalking the Saudi diplomat he is convinced was behind the wheel of that phantom SUV.
The actorsespecially Ruffalo, who has a unique aptitude for playing wounded, inarticulate American malessoldier through as best they can. What, though, is an actress as resourceful as Connelly meant to make of a part that asks her to bite her lip bravely before finally exploding in an aria of "My son is dead! I'm trying to figure out how to live!" Reservation Road  itself may twist and turn into the New England  night, but emotionally and dramatically, the movie that bears its name is a dead end. At least, for what it's worth, the Sox still win the Series.
