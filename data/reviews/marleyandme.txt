The Marley in "Marley & Me" is some kind of Labrador retriever. But don't make the mistake the marketing folks at Twentieth Century Fox are making. Marley is no dog. If you threw a lion's mane on him, he'd be Aslan in one of those Narnia movies. He looks like he could eat one Jennifer Aniston a day. Luckily for Aniston, she and Owen Wilson are about the only things he doesn't chew up in this bald-faced tearjerker based on the bestselling bald-faced tearjerker by John Grogan.
For the film, Wilson plays Grogan, a reporter turned columnist at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel who buys his wife, Jenny (Aniston), also a journalist, a puppy as a baby substitute. The babies show up anyway, and the dog stays despite his amazing ability to destroy a room in less than five seconds. Eventually, Jenny stops working as the family expands; and the stress to be successful starts to get to John - as much as it can for a man played by an actor who rarely seems bothered by anything on screen. Grogan's career appears charmed, but he's never quite fulfilled.
The movie is torn. It wants to honestly explore the natural wear-and-tear of the Grogan marriage. But it also seems OK with being something that could pass as a midseason replacement on ABC. For that, Eric Dane's handsome face pops up too often as Sebastian, a co-worker and buddy of Grogan. Sebastian is shallow, conceited, and chronically horny. Their walks together double as excuses for him to use Grogan's dog and children to pick up women.
Working from a script credited to veterans Scott Frank and Don Roos, director David Frankel fulfills many of the requirements of his assignment. The film just needs to be smoothly guided to its sober second half from its rambunctious first part where, among other events, a run-down Kathleen Turner appears for a scene as a grouchy dog trainer. (Her commanding presence is sorely missed for the rest of the movie. What might she and Michael Douglas have done with this thing 20 years ago?)
Frankel appeared to be having a lot more fun returning some classic-Hollywood glamour to the movies with "The Devil Wears Prada." The scale is smaller here. There is one terrific sequence, though: an energetic montage in which Grogan recites his daily activities while the film editor, Mark Livolsi, assembles corresponding images. "Woke up with a kiss from Marley." "Planted an orange tree." "Went to work with writer's block." "Watched models posing on the beach." "Watched Marley eat a pillow." "Wrote a column about gas prices." "Got into a fight with Dad about money." "Went to the emergency room." What an exhilarating encapsulation of the mundane symbiosis of a columnist's personal and professional lives. It's almost as good as watching Meryl Streep drop a coat on Anne Hathaway's desk a dozen times in a row or seeing Wilson and Vince Vaughn in "Wedding Crashers" carouse for two minutes. (Livolsi edited those, too.)
The ingenuity of that blow-by-blow sequence with Grogan gets at the central problem with this movie: The rest of it is excruciatingly plain. Grogan's book was about how much that dog meant to his family. The film isn't built around Marley so much as Marley has been built into the proceedings as another character. He's not a main course now. He's an ingredient. You see why the Grogans love that dog so much. He's theirs. But the movie never captures the crucial leap that made the book a hit. It's never "Marley & Us."

In Marley & Me , it doesn't take long to learn why Marley, an incorrigibly frisky golden Labrador retriever adopted by Florida newspaper writers John and Jenny Grogan (Owen Wilson  and Jennifer Aniston ), is the ''world's worst dog.'' He's friendly and lovable, but he devours everything in sight  drywall, socks, big chunks of furniture (no, he doesn't just chew on them, he eats  them). As a dog owner, I can testify that Marley & Me , based on the real John Grogan's smash 2005 memoir, is the single most endearing and authentic movie about the human–canine connection in decades. As directed by David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada  ), though, it's also something more: a disarmingly enjoyable, wholehearted comic vision of the happy messiness of family life.
John and Jenny share an existence that, from the standpoint of our current economic times, already looks like paradise. He's a reporter who gets refashioned, by his testy editor (Alan Arkin ), into a lifestyle columnist (only to keep complaining about it  poor guy!). She's a feature writer who becomes a stay-at-home mom. As the kids come along (three of them), the Grogans move into bigger and bigger houses, yet they have thwarted ambitions, fights that go on for days, and a general attitude of wistful loss toward all the freedoms they have given up to become parents. Marley & Me  celebrates two ordinary people as they try to fit love, work, children, and one volcanically misbehaved pooch into a single space. Marley may be the dog from hell, but we're meant to see that the Grogans, in their hearts, wouldn't have it any other way. Marley stands in for all the unruliness that can never be domesticated out of life.
You can  domesticate Owen Wilson, but the shock is how good the role of beleaguered breadwinner looks on him. He and Aniston forge a nimble connection (they even get mad in style), and Wilson has a scene near the end with Marley that's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career. Using his scratchy, lackadaisical warmth to voice a testament to family, and to where dogs fit into it, he makes you feel like it's a wonderful life indeed.

 To watch “Marley & Me,” the bland, obsequious adaptation of John Grogan’s best-selling memoir of his up-and-down relationship with an unruly Labrador retriever, is to tune in to an era that seems so close and yet so distant. In those naïve old days — the 1990s through the first part of this century — Florida real estate boomed, newspapers flourished and the heavens rained money.  Because the movie, directed by David Frankel (“The Devil Wears Prada”), plays by the rules of Hollywood, John and Jenny Grogan (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston), never age. The Grogans, golden-fleeced journalists, move from Kalamazoo, Mich., to West Palm Beach, Fla., where they adopt a yellow Lab that John names Marley (after Bob). Except for the occasional thunderstorm that freaks out the neurotic dog, the weather in Florida is always sunny with low humidity.  Later in the movie, after nearly a decade and a half have passed and the Grogans and their three model children have moved to a greeting-card perfect stone house with a barn in rural Pennsylvania, the years seem not to have touched them. Mr. Wilson’s blond surfer locks remain unflecked with gray. The waistline of Ms. Aniston’s Jenny, after bearing three children, shows no sign of a bulge.  Although the Grogans have their spats, one of which drives John temporarily out of the house, the screenplay glosses over their domestic crises to convey the fantasy of a marriage that is mostly smooth sailing, save for Jenny’s exhaustion after the birth of their third child. (The possibility of post-partum depression is cautiously broached, then dropped as though too hot to handle.) Most of the time the Grogans get along fine, largely because John is a laid-back dude verging on a doormat. As for the couple’s romantic chemistry, there is plenty of cuddling but little heat.  If Jenny, the no-nonsense household boss, is mercifully forgiving and appealingly curvaceous, beneath her surface perkiness she is awfully dull; early on, the movie conveniently forgets she is a journalist. Mr. Wilson’s John verges on stupefied. His  vague, drawling passive-aggression and dazed chipmunk smile are not traits usually associated with an aspiring hard-news journalist who finds his niche writing a humorous column about his incorrigible dog.  The movie implies a rivalry between John and Sebastian (Eric Dane), his best friend at the newspaper, but makes sure that the slick, preening Sebastian comes across as a toxic bachelor not worth envying. As John’s gruff editor with a heart of gold, Alan Arkin serenely works his familiar curmudgeonly shtick.  In the 2005 book, the rearing of an untrained but unfailingly loyal pet, who John likes to boast is “the world’s worst dog,” is portrayed as a relationship in which Marley teaches his master valuable life lessons. These include tolerating frustration and remembering to live in the moment while building a family — wisdom not conveyed by the movie.  Marley enters the Grogans’ household as a test case for actual parenthood. In his first act of vandalism he tears up their garage. The first signs that he is untrainable come when an imperious dog trainer (Kathleen Turner) abruptly rejects him after he refuses to obey, and a potentially uproarious comic encounter between human and beast is thrown away.  Mildly diverting scenes of canine misbehavior crop up at regular intervals, but the film makes little of them. After Marley’s failure at dog-training school, he is pretty much allowed to destroy at his leisure while his owners express amused exasperation. The deepening emotional bond between the Grogans and Marley is simply taken for granted.  Although the scenes between Mr. Wilson and the 22 dogs that play Marley at different ages demonstrate affection between owner and pet, nobody in the movie, including the Grogan children, seems deeply, wrenchingly attached to any other creature. Life is lived more habitually than passionately.  That doesn’t mean the scenes of Marley’s final days and the family’s mourning over his death aren’t affecting. Of course they are. But at the end of “Marley & Me” you don’t leave the theater with a sense that anything much has been learned, only that a fixture in the Grogans’ comfortable suburban lives has been removed. They will get over the loss in no time.  “Marley & Me” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has mild scatological humor, and Marley’s death scene might upset young children.

All that really counts for a movie like "Marley & Me" is that the climactic scenes empty the audiences' tear ducts, and in this it succeeds to the point that theater managers may need to mop the floors afterward. A stuff-of-life saga as delineated by a family dog's 13 years on Earth, this perky, episodic film is as broad and obvious as it could be, but delivers on its own terms thanks to sparky chemistry between its sunny blond stars, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, and the unabashed emotion-milking of the final reel. Fox has a winner here, likely to be irresistible to almost everyone but cats.
Shifting gears after "The Devil Wears Prada" from making light of corrosive careerism to briskly but sincerely assessing the pros and cons of domesticity, director David Frankel once again susses out what really matters in his material while paying cursory attention to matters of style and other niceties that may count most to aesthetes but go unnoticed by the hoi polloi.
In adapting John Grogan's bestseller, estimable scribes Scott Frank and Don Roos have made certain to establish a resilient connection between John and Jenny (Wilson and Aniston), buoyant 30ish journalists who, as the 1990s begin, abandon Michigan for Palm Beach, Fla. Jenny runs her life by making lists of things to be accomplished, while John is more relaxed and uncertain, but the scripters and stars know the shorthand to convey the fun, healthy appetites and productive give-and-take enjoyed by the attractive young marrieds.
John starts as a lowly reporter on a local paper under an indulgent editor (Alan Arkin), and Jenny does assorted feature writing. Still, John's not sure he's got what it takes to be a good father, so he decides to give responsibility and discipline a trial run with a dog. But if the way they raise their rambunctious yellow lab, Marley, is any indication, these two should never have kids.
As John comments more than once, Marley is "the world's worst dog"; he chews and tears up everything, jumps on people and is the first dog ever to be "fired" by a crusty old trainer (Kathleen Turner, now well on her way to becoming the new Shelley Winters). The comedy here is so broad as to qualify for a "Pets Out of Control"-type show, and it's far from the only time Frankel takes a shameless anything-goes approach.
Despite the warning signs of how disruptive a disobedient little critter can be to the otherwise warm lives of two hot young things in South Florida, John and Jenny soon find themselves with two, and later three, sprigs of their own. The years pass; John becomes a popular columnist (writing often about that darn dog) while his adventurous single buddy, Sebastian (Eric Dane), makes him jealous by globetrotting for the New York Times and scoring lots of chicks; Jenny suffers through the frustrations of early motherhood before coming out the other side; and they finally end up as got-it-all whitebread yuppies with a gorgeous Pennsylvania countryside spread and an old dog, which is where the masses' floodgates will open and curmudgeons will cringe.
It's a choppy, inelegant picture, and those who chronicle the physical particulars of the stars will note that no effort is made to alter Aniston's pert, firm bod to even momentarily reflect the effects of bearing three children. But the filmmakers know what's important here, including the stars' looks, so they rack up a winning score despite quite a bit of sloppy play in the field.
Animated and emotionally accessible, Aniston comes off better here than in most of her feature films, and Wilson spars well with her, even if, in the film's weaker moments, he shows he's on less certain ground with earnest material than he is with straight-faced impertinence.
Production values are routine, even hasty-looking at times. But, again, attention was paid where it counts -- the 22 dogs enlisted to portray Marley all more than earned their paychecks, having turned in great performances.


Satisfying only to pet-porn junkies whose tear ducts can't even withstand a 365 Ferrets a Year calendar, the movie version of John Grogan 's bestselling memoir lacks a crucial ingredient: any sense of what made its hero, a warm and fuzzy Terminator of a Labrador retriever, different from every other table-smashing, necklace-swallowing dogzilla on earth. Played in this canine I'm Not There  by a succession of impostors at various stages of life, Marley never develops a personality beyond generic mutt-goes-nuts antics—and without that crucial spark of soul, all director David Frankel  (The Devil Wears Prada ) delivers is a Beethoven   movie with less shedding. Instead, the career changes, family crises, and midlife moping of human leads Owen Wilson  and Jennifer Aniston  relegate Marley to a lifestyle accessory in his own biopic. (That's OK, buddy—a pet skunk gets more attention here than Wilson and Aniston's three kids.) Apart from Aniston's sick anticipation of a sonogram reading (a moment that belongs in another, better movie) and a depiction of postpartum stress close enough for Advil , Marley & Me  proves how lifeless Lady and the Tramp  would have been if told from the p.o.v. of "Jim Dear " and "Darling." Even so, by the time Marley goes off-leash to that great dog beach in the sky, you can bet there won't be a dry rug in the house.
