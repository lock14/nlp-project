Flash of Genius
, the directorial debut of producer Abraham (Children of Men
, Spy Game
) has all the ingredients of a great American drama. Based on the true story of engineer Robert Kearns � who, in 1963, invented the intermittent windshield wiper, only to see his idea stolen by the Ford Motor Co. � it�s real David and Goliath stuff, a battle between the forces of corporate greed and chicanery on one side and an extremely stubborn individual human spirit on the other. Like Tucker: The Man and His Dream
 and Erin Brockovich
 before it, Flash of Genius
 should have been one of those movies that makes all of us feel better about ourselves by fooling us into believing that, under the same circumstances, we would have been the ones standing up to those titans of industry. So why, exactly, does it feel so bland? Could it be its hero? For all his engineering prowess and persistence, Kinnear�s Kearns is an idealized and rather bloodless Hollywood vision of the early-1960s Midwestern American male: decent, hard-working, guileless, loyal, patriotic, and fertile. In other words, despite an obsessiveness bordering on (and occasionally toppling over into) mania, Kearns just doesn�t have the kind of larger-than-life personality we look for in our cinematic little-guy heroes. He is, on the contrary, quite dull, and 100 scenes of him slaving away in his basement or a library or in a courtroom don�t make him any less so. Then again, maybe the problem with the movie is the way it�s shot. Conspiracy films, by definition, have to be built slowly and meticulously, brick by brick, until a sense of overwhelming, asphyxiating odds becomes palpable. But for all his years in Hollywood, Abraham is at a loss when it comes to pacing, and where his film should revel in the minutiae of a slowly unraveling mystery and a slowly unraveling mind, he instead leaps forward in time by months and years every chance he gets, jarring audiences as he goes, leaving them always a few steps removed from his hero�s pain. Or maybe, in the end analysis, the problem is simply a matter of identification. Kearns, who was so of his time and so not of ours as to be almost a different species, walked hands down/chin out into a classic con job � what kind of fool hands over profitable blueprints to potential competitors without getting something in writing? � but he did so in the early 1960s, a time when not all Americans looked at big business with cynicism and suspicion, when a man like Kearns could still believe in Ford as a paragon of American corporate virtue. Maybe he was a sucker, but it was his belief in the fundamental decency of American institutions that made his struggle for redemption so winning, much more so than the movie that was made to honor it.


"Flash of Genius" is a true-story drama about the guy who invented the intermittent windshield wiper. It's a very earnest movie and I don't mean to be cruel, but shouldn't we draw the line on biopics right around here? Can the life struggles of the discoverer of dental floss be far behind? A miniseries on the inventor of the toilet tank ball?
All right, enough with the snark. Anyway, the problem with "Flash of Genius" isn't that the subject is dull but that the movie is. Brought to us by Marc Abraham, a longtime film producer ("Air Force One," "Children of Men") making his directorial debut, the film casts Greg Kinnear as Robert Kearns, an absent-minded professor at Michigan's Wayne State University who battles Detroit for decades after the auto companies steal his invention. A family man (Lauren Graham plays his wife and a gaggle of young actors play his six kids across the decades), Bob's a garage tinkerer who in 1963 tries to build a better windshield wiper after getting caught - skreek-skreek - in a light rain.
What he invents - wipe-pause-wipe - is a widget the auto companies have been working on for years, and the movie never convincingly explains why his widget works where theirs didn't. Naive but ambitious, Bob signs a deal with Ford and plans to manufacture the wipers himself with a friend and business partner (Dermot Mulroney). Then Ford cancels the contract and, surprise, debuts a car with his innovation. Chrysler follows suit, claiming Kearns's patents contain no new concepts and are therefore fair game.
The ensuing quest for justice swallows many years, many teams of lawyers (Alan Alda plays one), and apparently Kearns's entire life. The movie is built on lines similar to 2001's "A Beautiful Mind" - to the point where the hero suffers a mental breakdown as the pressure takes its toll - but Abraham lets his narrative drift in and out of focus. A climactic court trial with Kearns serving as his own attorney provides a few chances to root for the underdog against the corporate meanies, but it doesn't deliver the grand sense of closure the movie is seeking.
Abraham lionizes all-American qualities like inspiration and stubbornness even as they turn into all-American monomania, Kearns barely noticing as wife, career, children fall away in his pursuit of recognition. Crucially, though, "Flash" can't decide whether this is a story of triumph or tragedy. It's both, obviously, but in what specific mixture and why?
Kinnear plays the role with a sort of self-absorbed pep - a Jimmy Stewart hero minus the social graces - but you sense he's searching for a handle on the role the movie's not providing. Obsessed unto fury, the Bob Kearnses of this world may ultimately be closer to Herman Melville than to Hollywood - dark poetry instead of this movie's intermittently sunny prose.


The true-story premise of Flash of Genius  peddles inspiration in our time of giant, bullying corporations and despairing little guys: A despairing little guy takes on a giant, bullying corporation for patent infringement and wins. (Oops, did I give away the ending? Sue me.) Played with becoming mildness by Greg Kinnear, Robert Kearns was an engineering professor at a Michigan college who devised the intermittent windshield wiper  the mechanism that allows the driver to adjust the interval between blade swipes. After patenting his plans, he shopped them to the Ford Motor Company without reaching a licensing agreement, and later determined that Ford had stolen his invention. Kearns' Bleak House -obsessive pursuit of justice  in which he sometimes acted as his own counsel  took 12 years. (The real Kearns, who died in 2005 at the age of 77, sued General Motors and Chrysler, too.)
The individual components of director Marc Abraham's David-and-Goliath drama are roundly unexceptional; the script, soft and teach-y; the performances, earnest (including Alan Alda as a fair-weather lawyer who bails on the case). But that hardly matters. The product is concept, not execution, and the delivery techniques bear standard Hollywood patents. B–

 “Flash of Genius” is a doggedly workmanlike variation of an old story: the lone crusader doing battle with the big bad establishment.  Picture Jimmy Stewart as a passionately outraged everyman speaking truth to power, then take away the passion.  What gives the movie a frisson of freshness is that the little guy is based on an actual person, Dr. Robert W. Kearns (Greg Kinnear), an electrical engineer and college professor who in the late 1960s invented and patented the intermittent windshield wiper. After he presented his invention to the major Detroit automakers, Ford demanded a sample unit, then adopted his system without paying him or giving him credit. He ultimately sued Ford and then Chrysler for patent infringement.  Like the invention at the heart of the story, “Flash of Genius” is a meticulously constructed mechanism, one that wants to convey the same mixture of idealism, obsession and paranoia found in whistle-blower movies like “Silkwood” and “The Insider.” Adapted from a 1993 New Yorker article by John Seabrook and directed by Marc Abraham from a screenplay by Philip Railsback, it has the tone and texture of a well-made but forgettable television movie.  At least in its climactic courtroom scenes “Flash of Genius” evenhandedly lays out the opposing arguments of Ford and Kearns, who acts as his own defense lawyer. It also does an exemplary job of articulating the legal issues, with an assist from Charles Dickens’s “Tale of Two Cities,” which is used to illustrate an important point.  The scenes of Kearns’s domestic life with his wife, Phyllis (Lauren Graham), a schoolteacher, and their six children convey the family’s messy, unglamorous ’60s existence. During his final push for a trial by jury, after he is offered generous settlements but no credit for his invention, several of his children work as his assistants.  The visibly aging children, played by different actors as they grow older, are the movie’s principal indicators of how much time has passed. Mr. Kinnear, appearing baggy-eyed and anxious throughout the film, and Ms. Graham, looking drably attractive, barely change. The movie  doesn’t specify the year or even the decade in which events are taking place except by pop music cues and changing car models. “Flash of Genius” would have been more gripping had it pinpointed events and conveyed the harrowing physical, emotional and financial cost of Kearns’s quest.  It is encouraging to see Mr. Kinnear, who was so perfectly cast as a screwball rake in “Ghost Town,” undertaking more serious adult roles in which he doesn’t play cute or bratty. But he is no Jimmy Stewart. You never have the feeling that he represents a cause larger than his character’s own personal grievance. Mr. Kinnear is a small-scale screen presence comfortable projecting worry, frustration and even nagging obsession; moral heroism is beyond him.  Kearns is first seen being escorted by Maryland state police off a Greyhound bus headed for Washington, where he intends to plead his case. Taken to a mental hospital, he is treated for a nervous breakdown and released as soon as his doctor decides his obsession has subsided.  The story backtracks to his days in his basement tinkering on the invention, which he and his skittish business partner, Gil (Dermot Mulroney), hope will make them rich. Those dreams are dashed when Ford suddenly and suspiciously loses interest. The final moment of truth arrives when he crashes a Ford dealers convention at which the Mustang is unveiled with the intermittent wiper as a prominent selling point. From then on his pursuit  of recognition for an invention he calls his Mona Lisa is relentless.  But it all feels like déjà vu. If we must have stories about heroic little guys going after bullies, maybe it’s time for a true story of a shareholder in a bankrupt investment company suing its filthy rich  chief executive for his golden parachute and winning. To be a true story, of course, it  would have to happen.  “Flash of Genius” is rated  PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

"Flash of Genius" is anything but. The story of the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, who legally hounded the Ford Motor Co. for screwing him out profits and credit, is very small potatoes in the cinematic annals of inspiring little-guy-fights-the-system melodramas, to the point that it's a wonder it was thought to be strong bigscreen material; an old-style TV movie would have been more like it. Pic's pervasive blandness marks this as a theatrical also-ran.
That Dr. Robert Kearns, a middle-class Detroit teacher, basement tinkerer and Catholic father of many, had a legitimate beef against Big Auto is perfectly clear, and his obstinate determination to prove his point, even to the detriment of his family's cohesion and his own stability, is moderately inspiring in the way such true-life stories of "the indomitable human spirit" are always constructed to be.
But it's also unavoidable that Kearns, as nicely played by Greg Kinnear, was a pretty milquetoasty guy -- and he's the colorful one in the family. Scripter Philip Railsback, working from a story published in the New Yorker, and helmer Marc Abraham, the vet producer making his debut behind the camera, manage to make Kearns' one contribution to history -- his equating the blinking of the human eye to what an automobile windshield wiper should do and finding a way to engineer such a thing -- interesting in a quaint, even amusing way, which sustains viewer interest through the first act.
But nothing else, least of all his interactions with the ever-growing family he professes to care about so much, comes alive or carries much conviction. After presenting his invention to Ford and receiving a sufficient commitment to open a factory to move ahead with a prototype, the auto giant cuts him off. His wife Phyllis (Lauren Graham) and key business backer Gil (Dermot Mulroney) support his sense of outrage for a while, but he -- and, with him, the film -- then drift off into many years in the wilderness, as Ford throws every conceivable legal roadblock in his way.
No matter the ultimate reward for his stubbornness -- the court case, in which Kearns represented himself, is unavoidably engaging at times -- this story simply doesn't take on ramifications or meaning that extend beyond the specifics of this particular case. The lessons are simplistic: Stick to your guns, stand up for yourself, fight the big bully, etc., all without depth, attention to the ironic consequences of this stand or the effect on the inner lives of those involved.
Beyond the narrative shortcomings, the film is indifferently filmed, with uncustomarily flat visuals by cinematographer Dante Spinotti and listless pacing. Except for Mulroney and, briefly, Alan Alda as an attorney, supporting performances are colorless.
One minor detail is so bizarre that it deserves comment: Even after years of fighting the company, Kearns still drives a Ford. You'd have to think he'd trade it in for a different make. But if he truly did stick with the brand, a line of dialogue noting his reason would have been in order.



The big-screen version of inventor Robert Kearns 's legal battles with Ford  and Chrysler —both of whom nicked his intermittent windshield wiper without giving him credit, much less paying a cent—is about as exciting as Kearns's Wikipedia  entry. Greg Kinnear , usually kinetic, is unusually (and unbearably) dull in producer turned director Marc Abraham 's telling of Kearns's years-long fight to regain his good name, even as Ford finally offers millions to get him to scram. Is Kearns mad or just angry? Hard to say, as the filmmaker and actor can't get a handle on a man obsessed with windshield wipers and the attendant credit that's rightfully his. The movie's so even-keeled that even the cast—including Lauren Graham  as the tolerant wife who suddenly snaps and then just vanishes altogether—seems to be getting sleepy, sleepy, sleepy as it winds its way toward a courtroom showdown that's more slowdown. You know how it'll all end—Hollywood  doesn't make movies in which Goliath trounces David, especially when he's Greg Kinnear—so all you're left with are windshield wipers, going back and forth . . . and back and forth . . . and back and forth . . .
