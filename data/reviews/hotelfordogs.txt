If you or your kids have a soft spot for any kind of dog, "Hotel for Dogs" wants to jump in your lap and slobber up your face. Mastiffs, poodles, bearded collies, Boston terriers (go team), and Dobermans are all present and accounted for; there's even a shaggy Italian spinone running through a few scenes. No pit bulls, though - I guess they only get cast in gangster films.
An adaptation of Lois Duncan's 1971 children's book, "Hotel for Dogs" is agreeable Saturday afternoon multiplex piffle - friendly, formulaic, completely harmless. Emma Roberts - daughter of Eric, niece of Julia, and star of Nickelodeon's "Unfabulous" - plays 16-year-old Andi, who with her inventor brother Bruce (Jake T. Austin) lives with a pair of the worst foster parents ever. (They're failed rockers played by Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon, both looking like something the cat dragged in.)
Somehow the kids have kept their Jack Russell terrier, Friday, a secret from the grown-ups in the three years following their parents' deaths; even their social worker (Don Cheadle) is out of the loop. Following Friday into an abandoned hotel, the children discover a few strays, bring in a few more, and then more, until the city's kill-shelter has tumbleweeds rolling through it. Bruce's gizmos make feeding and exercising easy (don't ask where the poop goes), and they get help from other teens both dreamy (Johnny Simmons) and sassy (Kyla Pratt and Troy Gentile).
It's decent family kibble made by people who genuinely appear to like animals. Stick around for the footage of the cast and crew with their own dogs, proof that man's best friend in Hollywood isn't always his agent.

 Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of “Hotel for Dogs,” the cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. After watching the movie, only a grouchy critic — one who shares W. C. Fields’s conviction that a man who hates children and dogs can’t be all bad — would shout “Bah, humbug!” and summon the truant officer and the dog catcher. I wouldn’t dream of it, but ...  The liberation movement is led by the recently orphaned 16-year-old Andi (Emma Roberts) and her 11-year-old brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), who have been shuttled among foster homes in the three years since the deaths of their parents. Their latest guardians, Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon), a scowling, untalented pair of aspiring rock musicians, are in the foster-parent business strictly for the money.  The inedible microwave slop they serve their charges for dinner types them as inhumane misanthropes of Dickensian proportions, and “Hotel for Dogs” is the rare example of a movie that equates rock ’n’ roll grunge with meanspiritedness. Because no dogs are allowed in the Scudders’ apartment, Andi and Bruce are forced to conceal the existence of Friday, their beloved, insatiably hungry Jack Russell terrier.  Directed by Thor Freudenthal and adapted from Lois Duncan’s popular children’s book, this movie imagines a world of brilliant, caring children and glum, clueless grown-ups. The only sympathetic adults are Andi and Bruce’s kindhearted but frustrated social worker, Bernie (Don Cheadle), and his wife, Carol (Robinne Lee).  When Friday disappears, the children track him to an abandoned hotel where a couple of stray dogs have taken up residence. Helped by Dave (Johnny Simmons), a friendly pet-store manager with a truck, they evacuate the canine population of the prisonlike local pound  and relocate the dogs to the hotel, which Bruce, a mechanical wizard,  turns into a doggy  paradise stocked with miraculous gadgets.  At about this point the Hollywood ick factor kicks in. Andi and Dave experience the first throes of puppy love; meanwhile a mismatched pair of pooches, Romeo and Juliet, begin making eyes.  But in the most imaginative scenes, the frisky pups gleefully interact with Bruce’s outlandish inventions, each of which is designed to meet a different need. The pooches exercise on rows of treadmills equipped with chewable bones as lures to keep them moving forward. A fetch machine spewing tennis balls also has them scampering to and fro. Meals are served in a Rube Goldberg-worthy assembly line that suggests a giant automat. Elaborate toilets streamline sewage disposal; there is even a self-draining hydrant with an attached shower.  Although you wouldn’t want an entire movie devoted to such shenanigans, “Hotel for Dogs” isn’t half as zany as it might have been. In any case, it is loaded with enough stupid pet and human tricks to satisfy David Letterman for years to come.  “Hotel for Dogs” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild scatological humor.

It could do more for straycanines than Barack Obama, but �Hotel for Dogs� is nevertheless a Chihuahua-sized concept served up in a doggy bag of contrivances and shtick. Still, no one should bet against the DreamWorks family adventure at the B.O., as it features orphaned children taking care of orphaned dogs, a score that could be poured on pancakes and a kennel�s worth of cute. It�s a sure thing -- in theaters, on DVD, at birthday parties, in Christmas stockings. Once you feed it, it�ll never go away.
In the three years since their parents died, Andi (Emma Roberts) and her younger brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), have been hiding their dog, Friday, from the various and sundry foster parents. For all his efforts, social worker Bernie (the always reliable Don Cheadle) can�t seem to find the proper guardians for his two dog lovers. As the pic opens, Andi and Bruce are living with Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon), two ghastly rock �n� roll wannabes who are dumber than dirt and clearly in the parent business for the money. Charles Dickens might have made them up.
Andi and Bruce have plenty of trouble and can�t afford more, so when a mixup forces them to run from the police, they stumble into an abandoned hotel where several homeless mutts have already taken up residence. (Most of the film seems to have been shot in downtown Los Angeles.) What the heck, Andi decides: Since she and her brother are essentially homeless and family-less, why not create a home in the hotel and people it, so to speak, with derelict dogs? 
Thankfully, helmer Thor Freudenthal doesn�t hammer home the parallels between the siblings and the beasts they adopt into our by-now-dog-softened brains. After a pet-store owner (Johnny Simmons) remarks that his customers only want puppies, 16-year-old Andi snorts, �Tell me about it.� But that�s about as heavy as it gets. 
The more pronounced aspect of the script -- by Jeff Lowell, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, working from the book by Lois Duncan -- is the adversarial relationship that exists between all kids and all adults (with the exception of Bernie and his wife, played by Robinne Lee). Andi and Bruce have to make their own kind of home and their own kind of family, because the grown-up world isn�t coming through.
�Hotel for Dogs� is a fantasy and looks like one: There isn�t a landscape in the movie that doesn�t appear computer-graphically candy-coated and populated with virtual people. All this techno-fun goes right in the hotel sequences, where Bruce gets to exercise his inner Rube Goldberg: Not only does he devise complicated feeding machines for the dogs and train them to use toilets (and a self-draining fire hydrant), but there are also treadmills to keep them fit, an automatic fetching machine, self-knocking doors that send the dogs into an aerobic frenzy and a room full of car doors set up so the pooches can hang their heads out the windows while a rear-projected film clip simulates a ride down a highway. It�s not entirely ingenious, but it works.
The stickiness factor, as one might expect, sort of scampers off the charts eventually, as all the love of dogs and children is heaped upon the audience like a Dumpster full of Alpo. Though their characters are vile, Kudrow and Dillon provide at least a scoop of unpleasantness, and the early shots of a dog pound look like outtakes from an MSNBC prison series. But �Hotel for Dogs� is ultimately warm and furry, with a wet nose buried in gross receipts.
Production values are fine, although the cartoon quality of the visuals may put some viewers off.
