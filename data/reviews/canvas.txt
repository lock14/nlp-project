 “Canvas,” Joseph Greco’s drama about schizophrenia, is obviously a labor of love. In his director’s note Mr. Greco writes, “I grew up watching my mother battle schizophrenia, and those harrowing memories had a profound impact on me.” He adds that a screenwriting professor once told him, “Write what you know.” That advice has resulted in a movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color.  Because Mary Marino, the afflicted mother, is portrayed by the gifted Marcia Gay Harden, “Canvas” never threatens to become the kind of quasi-horror film that movies about the mentally ill tend to be. Cast in a role that would tempt many actresses to indulge in  award-seeking histrionics, Ms. Harden underplays Mary’s recurrent symptoms until the last moment. When the voices that periodically torment her return, her ears prick up, and her eyes dart, as expectancy mingles with fear that rapidly escalates to panic.  Even when she erupts, you sense the human being in pain huddled inside the  uncontrollably raving creature.  The story begins as Chris (Devon Gearhart), the 10-year-old son of Mary and her husband, John (Joe Pantoliano), returns to his family’s home in Hollywood, Fla. Chris had been staying with relatives while his mother was hospitalized, and almost immediately it becomes clear that her mental stability is hanging by a thread.  As she becomes delusional, then paranoid, you share her husband’s sinking feeling that it’s always going to be this way and his frustration at finding that his love is powerless against demons with whom there is no reasoning.  Mr. Pantoliano’s John emerges as  a working-class saint who, through some combination of devotion and inner resilience, almost never rises to the bait when Mary becomes shrill and irrational. But even he has his limits. Chris, being younger, isn’t so patient. When his mother embarrasses him in front of his peers, he half blames her and wants to escape. In her more lucid moments Mary is mortified by her behavior.  The Marinos are devastated in countless ways. Mary’s hospital bills drive John, who works in construction, into debt. The movie gives only a taste of the stress he undergoes dealing with insurance companies. His patience is tested when Mary, like so many schizophrenics, refuses to take her medication. Chris has nightmares that reflect his fear of having inherited his mother’s illness.  When the police are called to the house one too many times, the neighbors’ tolerance evaporates. How does life go on? Well, somehow it does.  The movie’s title refers both to Mary’s therapeutic painting, which, she explains, quiets the voices inside her head, and to John’s construction of a sailboat in the backyard as a present for her. Chris also develops a profitable sideline sewing custom-made patched shirts for his classmates and experiences puppy love for the first time.  If “Canvas” tries much too hard to soften the Marinos’ anguish by emphasizing the father and son’s creativity and resilience, a tougher, more realistic movie would probably be close to unbearably painful.  Below the film’s sugar coating is an inner core of integrity and goodness. All three Marinos are noble everyday people visited by horror. Think of “Canvas” as a Lifetime movie: a likable one.  “Canvas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mature thematic elements.

First-rate performances, an uncompromising point of view and a fresh take on a well-worn movie subject -- madness -- make helmer-scribe Joseph Greco's debut "Canvas" the kind of indie feature that could easily cross over from festival awards to respectable B.O. success. Auds will experience the joy of discovery in Greco's fact-based drama -- not just in its perspective on schizophrenia and the effect of the disease on one Florida family, but in Joe Pantoliano's cliche-demolishing performance as a sensitive family man who loves his wife no matter how paranoid, delusional or destructive she becomes.
Greco, who apparently based the script on his own life as the son of schizophrenic mother, has constructed a story that works both as a domestic drama and an allegory about mental illness and art.
Ten-year-old Chris Marino (played with naturalistic grace by newcomer Devon Gearhart) returns home from a stay with relatives, obviously having been sent away while matters are sorted out with his schizoid mother Mary (Marcia Gay Harden).
Nothing is ever sorted out, of course; she experiences voices, delusions, paranoia and her ravings bring police to the house and neighborhood enmity on the family. Chris, meanwhile, tries to weather it with the help of his father John (Pantoliano).
Chris' breakthrough at school occurs when he wears a shirt his mother has mended, with a clashing patch sewn across the chest. When his schoolmates admire it, Chris claims he made it, and gradually he becomes trendy shirtmaker to the middle-school fashionistas. It's his mother's inspiration, of course, that is behind the shirt, which serves as a kind of battle flag for the artistic and mentally ill.
Meanwhile, John, being cheated by his boss in between being hassled by cops coming to the house, decides to build a boat in his driveway. It's an irrational act -- Greco's point being that the line between eccentricity and disease is a very fine one indeed.
Harden is well known for painting precise, no-holds-barred portraits of characters in such celebrated films as "Mystic River" and "Pollock." She maintains her own high standards in "Canvas," the title of which refers to both the healing properties of art and the blank slate of childhood.
The revelation in the film, however, is Pantoliano, best known for inhabiting sociopaths like Ralphie Cifaretto in "The Sopranos" and lowlifes like Teddy Gammell in "Memento." His performance as the working stiff/faithful husband is a delightful surprise.

Mental disease is too often reduced in film to self-destructive eccentricity, sensationalist melodrama, or vilifying thrills. But as endorsed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness , writer-director Joseph Greco 's convincing feature debut tries something more daring by depicting an entirely average Florida family's struggles with schizophrenia. The patient in question is Mary Marino  (Marcia Gay Harden ), a hobby painter already showing signs of instability by the time we're introduced to the whole clan: Her hubby John (a riveting Joe Pantoliano ) is a hump-busting construction worker whose marital devotion remains steadfast no matter how many times the cops are called in, and their 10-year-old son Chris (newcomer Devon Gearhart)who vents his confusion and humiliation through school rebellionis largely the heart and entrance to the story. Through the young towhead's eyes, puppy love becomes a welcome distraction from the one-two punch of Mom's institutionalization and Dad's descent into neglect and full-blown denial. Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas  falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion.
