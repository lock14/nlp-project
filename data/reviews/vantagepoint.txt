If you can work your way past Vantage Point
's goofy casting that places a bland, blank-eyed Hurt in the White House, then I suppose you can manage to forgive this Rashomon
 rip-off's other glaring idiosyncrasies, of which there are many. Like the Akira Kurosawa classic, Vantage Point
 replays a single event � in this case, the assassination of the United States president at a Middle East peace summit � from multiple points of view. The views include those of an onsite cable-news producer (Weaver), a camcording tourist (Whitaker), a mystery man (Noriega) and an equally unknowable femme fatale (Zurer), a Secret Service agent (McGill), and, the key to it all, Thomas Barnes (Quaid), a recently rehired Secret Service agent who previously took a bullet for the prez and now enters and exits every situation with a panicky grimace that recalls nothing so much as wee Jasen Fisher's anxiety-prone adolescent from Parenthood
. Quaid does what he can with a role that appears to be little more than a cheap carbon copy of Clint Eastwood's similarly embattled presidential protector from In the Line of Fire
, but after watching him dash hither and yon, searching for the truth in a plaza of lies, it's just not enough to make Vantage Point
 anything other than another pre-election also-ran. I shouldn't even bring up the outlandish � and preposterously clich�d � story contrivance that revolves around a young girl separated from her mother amidst the conflicting, ever-escalating crises (the poor little plot point ends up on a crowded highway, no less), but fuck it, I just did. Cue screech of brakes, Whitaker's unlazy eye, and me, exiting the theatre to go rewatch The Usual Suspects
 and ponder the nature of exploitave POV usage.


"Vantage Point" reduces global terrorism to a Rubik's Cube suitable for an evening's entertainment. If that doesn't make you vaguely ill, by all means take this thriller for the shallow, gimmicky "ride" it aspires to be. You can marvel at the cluelessness of Hollywood writers and directors later.
The gimmick in question is the old "Rashomon" trick - repeating the action through the perspectives of different characters - updated to an age of post-9/11 dread. The setting is Salamanca, Spain, where US President Ashton (William Hurt) is about to open a peace conference with a speech in the Plaza Mayor. We watch the ensuing developments from the news truck of producer Rex (Sigourney Weaver, acting all Faye Dunaway in "Network"): The president is shot, a Secret Service agent appears to bring down a suspect, a bomb goes off somewhere else in the city, and then the Plaza podium itself detonates in a massive explosion.
Click. Rewind. Now we're seeing the events from the point of view of that Secret Service agent, Barnes (Dennis Quaid), as he radios in a suspected shooter in a hotel window overlooking the plaza, brings down the suspect - who turns out to be Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), part of the mayor's security detail - and reviews video camera footage shot by an American tourist played by Forest Whitaker. Boom goes the podium. Click. Rewind. Now we're following Enrique. And so forth.
America's in worse shape than I thought if William Hurt's the president, but never mind that. The rewind/retell gambit quickly grows tiresome - we're groaning by the fourth narrative reboot - and, anyway, the device isn't used to question the nature of truth (as it was in "Rashomon") but to slowly reveal a nefarious terrorist conspiracy to . . . but I can say no more. Suffice to say that Hurt gets a lot more screen time than it at first appears.
Weaver largely disappears after her opening bit, though, and "Vantage Point" eventually tosses its own gimmick to settle in for a long, hectic game of foil-them-Arabs, with agents Barnes and Taylor (Matthew Fox of "Lost") crashing cars through the crowded streets of Salamanca after the Evil Mastermind (the gifted French-Moroccan actor Saïd Taghmaoui), his beauteous but soulless accomplice (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer), and their various dupes and traitors.
The result is a movie that's both clever and stupid - an interesting feat. Puzzle addicts may enjoy the way the pieces of Barry L. Levy's script snap together, if they can overlook the times he forces pieces that don't fit. (The Evil Mastermind can massacre thousands of innocents but swerves to avoid a little girl? As they say on "Saturday Night Live": Really?) Action fans will like the explosions. Those of us who follow the news may be alternately tickled and appalled at a movie that reduces current events to the level of an old Warner Brothers anti-Nazi flick.
I guess it's comforting to believe the forces of Islamic extremism can be quelled by one true-hearted American Secret Service agent. Or it used to be, back when Clint Eastwood was saving the world in "In the Line of Fire." That was 1993, though. This is now, and even the hero doesn't seem convinced: Quaid's scowl is screwed on so tight here he looks constipated. Maybe he tried to digest the script.


Vantage Point  has a gripping premise that, for a while, at least, is grippingly executed. In a Spanish town square, the U.S. president (William Hurt) is about to address a global summit on terrorism. Moments after stepping to the podium, he is struck by an assassin's bullet; a minute later, a bomb explodes, killing dozens. The scenario unfolds from the point of view of a CNN-style news outfit, its producer (Sigourney Weaver) barking orders from a command center. The movie then ''rewinds,'' and we see the same tense few minutes played out again  this time from the POV of the Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) who had tried to stop the man he thought was the assassin. Then we see the events again, and again , a grand total of six times.
The director, Pete Travis, is a pulse-pounding technological showman whose high-strung, quick-cut style might be described as JFK  meets Paul Greengrass meets Jerry Bruckheimer. That said, it's not the plot that thickens  it's the pulp. Vantage Point  starts to slide off the rails when it tracks a tourist (Forest Whitaker) and his trusty camcorder; instead of Zapruder-like intrigue, the episode has him running around like an agent in a rote thriller. The segments just get more ludicrous from there. It reveals nothing to say that if a government ever used a stunt double, it couldn't do so this openly, or that the last episode is such a bombastic pileup of schlock conspiracy and gunplay it would embarrass Tom Clancy.

 “Vantage Point,” a gimmick in search of a point, is nothing if not, er, timely. Set in the picturesque Spanish city of Salamanca (otherwise known as Mexico City), this jigsaw puzzle exploits a repellent conceit — the shooting of an American president (William Hurt, effectively insincere) — in a vague attempt to explore questions of narrative and subjectivity (like “Rashomon”) through the box-office-friendly form of a thriller (like the "Bourne” flicks). Instead of pushing the story forward, the filmmakers instead repeatedly return to the crime, or rather to a handful of witnesses, all of whom saw the same exact event from critically different angles.  “Vantage Point,” a gimmick in search of its own point, is nothing if not, er, timely. Set mostly in a Spanish city, it has been given a hard sheen by the director Pete Travis, working from a screenplay by Barry L. Levy. This is competent if completely impersonal filmmaking of a familiar type that finds the usual allotment of famous, or at least famous enough, actors  — Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox and Sigourney Weaver  — arranged in various configurations in assorted spaces and delivering instantly forgettable dialogue. What does register: a slimmed-down Mr. Whitaker looks as sleek as an otter, Mr. Fox is probably best cast to nice type, and Ms. Weaver seems too big for her small bit as a television producer.  “Vantage Point,” a gimmick in search of its own point, is nothing if not untimely. This is less a matter of topicality (this is, of course, a presidential election year) than a problem of timing, in other words pacing, narrative flow, direction. In “Rashomon,” Kurosawa gives you four versions of the same incident and does so brilliantly. Here we get so many versions and viewpoints that a preview audience started to complain audibly each time the clock was reset, though this probably had less to do with the fractured storytelling than its lack of brilliance. In truth, with “Rashomon,” you really get five versions of the same anecdote because the most important belongs to the filmmaker, a vantage point that’s missing from this newer work.  “Vantage Point” — well, you get the point.  “Vantage Point” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for graphic gun and bomb violence.

Can an implausible setpiece offer up fresh thrills and insights if replayed ad infinitum from different perspectives? Not according to "Vantage Point," a 23-minute movie dragged out, via some narrative gimmickry, to a punishing hour and a half. Circling endlessly around a political assassination attempt and its violently contrived aftermath, the film proves every bit as crude, nerve-grinding and finally unsalvageable as the car accidents it keeps inflicting on its characters. Originally slated for a 2007 release, Sony holdover is unlikely to stop traffic around multiplexes despite its attention-getting cast, especially when poor word of mouth takes hold.
Pic is set entirely in and around a plaza in the Spanish town of Salamanca, where leaders are gathering for an international summit devoted to fighting terrorism abroad. In the first of many such sequences -- this one seen through the eyes and lenses of a news crew -- the president of the United States (William Hurt) is gunned down onstage, followed by a huge explosion and mass confusion in the streets. The smoke soon clears but the plot doesn't, instead turning back the clock 23 minutes and replaying the entire chain of events, this time from the p.o.v. of troubled Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid).
And so Barry L. Levy's script goes, "Rashomon"-style, back and forth again and again, tagging along with a different character and parceling out new clues with each successive go-round. After witnessing the horrific events alongside a fellow agent (Matthew Fox), Thomas' perspective switches to that of a suspicious-looking Spanish cop (Eduardo Noriega); he passes the baton to a friendly American bystander (Forest Whitaker), who conveniently has a video camera; and eventually we come around to Mr. President himself, who turns out to have his own unexpected view of the proceedings.
Even for viewers invested in this improbably detailed scenario, tedium begins to set in at around the half-hour mark -- not because the instant-replay structure couldn't work in theory, but because its audience-baiting tactics are so transparent (having a character whisper "Oh my god" when something shocking transpires offscreen loses its punch the third or fourth time). Pic hurtles from repetitive to risible with a high-speed car chase and a hail of gunfire, reaching a nadir when an adorable little girl with an ice cream cone winds up dodging traffic.
Whatever their flaws, recent topical dramas such as "Lions for Lambs," "Rendition" and "In the Valley of Elah" at least engaged with their hot-button subjects. At once timid and opportunistic, "Vantage Point" freely milks anxiety from both 9/11 and the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but otherwise stays safe and apolitical throughout.
Padding out the backstory are some fleeting references to Morocco and three baddies whose origins are left deliberately vague, played by French thesp Said Taghmaoui ("The Kite Runner," "Three Kings"), Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer ("Munich") and Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez ("The Bourne Ultimatum"). Atli Orvarsson's percussive score gives way to exotic crooning whenever these three enter the frame, as though suddenly accompanying a terrorist-themed telenovela.
Directed by Pete Travis (who debuted with the 2004 docudrama "Omagh"), pic suggests a collision between 1998's "Snake Eyes" and the two most recent "Bourne" movies, minus Brian De Palma's voyeur-implicating subtexts and Paul Greengrass' kinetic precision. Pic clearly apes the latter's signature style with its flailing handheld camerawork and amped-up editing; viewers not overcome by motion sickness will note the many temporal inconsistencies between replayed segments.
Thesps deliver performances largely in keeping with the film's hysterical tone, though Sigourney Weaver's cool, brittle news editor (who disappears too soon after the first reel) and Hurt's dignified commander in chief are welcome exceptions. Filmed at a replica of Salamanca's Plaza Mayor in Mexico City, pic has a convincing rally-like atmosphere and handles its cast of extras (some of them likely digital) capably enough.

Set in Salamanca , Spain, during an international counterterrorism summit, Vantage Point  depicts an assassination attempt on the president of the United States from the perspective of five witnesses and, in the movie's  pièce de résistance , the members of the terror cell responsible for the attack. It's a cast of characters the likes of which haven't been seen together since  Airport '79 : the hard-bitten TV news director (Sigourney Weaver ) who barks things like, "Leave the editorializing to the people who get paid to have an opinion"; the Secret Service  agent (Dennis Quaid ) back on the job for the first time since he took a bullet in the line of duty; the conveniently camcorder-equipped American tourist (Forest Whitaker ); and old POTUS himself, a freeze-dried specimen of Roosevelt-era statesmanship stiffly played by William Hurt . And I haven't even gotten to the terrorists—a cabal of suitably brown-skinned jihadists straight out of central (Asia) casting.
Vantage Point , which was directed by Pete Travis , wants to be the Rashomon  of presidential assassination thrillers, but it's more like an entire season of 24  stripped down to its freeze-frame cliffhangers and recaps of last week's episode. It all goes something like this: A crowd of journalists and onlookers jostles into a central square; the mayor of Salamanca delivers some opening remarks before ceding the stage to our commander in chief; and then, before he can get two words out, the prez goes down for the count.
Then, as if God Himself had hit the rewind button, everything we've just seen flits by in fast-reverse and we see it all again—and again and again and again—through another character's eyes. The idea here, of course, is for each successive piece of  Vantage Point 's narrative jigsaw to give us some crucial information we don't already have. But for every scene that fulfills that goal, Travis gives us a dozen others that carry the distinct feeling of déjà vu. (Hurt stunt-falls so many times that he seems to be auditioning for a Gerald Ford  biopic.)
Here is a movie to stop the auteur theory dead in its tracks. Clearly, the British-born Travis was recruited for Vantage Point  on the basis of his excellent 2004 debut feature, Omagh  , which restaged the events leading up to and following a devastating 1998 car bombing on a crowded retail street in the titular Northern Irish town. Produced by Paul Greengrass , and conceived as something of a companion film to his own Bloody Sunday , there wasn't a moment in Omagh  that rang false. There's not a single one in Vantage Point  that rings true.
The multiple perspectives are all foreplay, it turns out, for an orgiastic third-act car chase during which the movie's story threads converge in a way that makes Paul Haggis  seem like a master of Balzacian realism. As car chases go, it's not half bad; but nothing in Vantage Point  quickens the pulse as much as the realization that, with each successive turn of the wheel, we come one step closer to the end.
