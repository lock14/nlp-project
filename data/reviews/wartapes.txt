Even documentaries program you to expect payoffs. The War Tapes , a powerfully distressing film in which director Deborah Scranton weaves together first-person video footage shot by three National Guardsmen in Iraq in 2004, roughly a year after the invasion began, gives us a literal soldier's-eye view of the current U.S. military nightmare: desolate rides through Baghdad and Fallujah, accompanied by the occasional explosion and always  always  the fear that the next IED will be the one that hits you. The soldiers speak movingly of that anxiety. It's almost intrinsic to the nature of movies that we begin to wait for that horrific event, the awful ''climax'' to the soldiers' dread.
Yes, there's one chaotic ambush (the only glimpse of the insurgency we get). But that climax never arrives, and that's where The War Tapes  transcends the pornography of violence to provide a genuine terror-struck look at what our troops are going through. With tripods mounted on gun turrets and Kevlar helmets, the film captures the shot nerves, the impotence veering into madness, that comes of knowing that the greatest danger you face  a landscape of booby traps  doesn't even consist of live soldiers. ''This is the most helpless feeling you've ever had,'' says one Guardsman, his despair echoed by the other Americans we hear  brave but battered cynics who believe, to a notable degree, they're there to preserve U.S. oil interests. The War Tapes  captures how the war in Iraq, for all its terrible carnage and death, is in a way too random in its destruction to even be called ''combat.''

 "The War Tapes," winner of the prize for best documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival last month, proceeds from a simple, powerful idea. The filmmakers gave small digital video cameras to three members of the New Hampshire Army National Guard shortly before they were deployed to Iraq in early 2004, and invited them to record their experiences over there.  The film that the men shot, supplemented by home-front interviews and images captured by other soldiers, has been edited into a moving, complicated movie that illuminates, with heartbreaking clarity, some of the human actuality of this long, confusing war.  Like Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein's "Gunner Palace," released last year, and James Longley's "Iraq in Fragments," shown at Sundance in January, "The War Tapes" declines to argue a position, preferring to concentrate on the fine grain of daily life in combat. Whatever your opinion of the war — and however it has changed over the years — this movie is sure to challenge your thinking and disturb your composure. It provides no reassurance, no euphemism, no closure. Given the subject and the circumstances, how could it?  By the end of "The War Tapes," which was directed by Deborah Scranton, you feel remarkably close to the three guardsmen, who represent themselves with a candor occasionally checked by flinty New England reticence. Specialist Mike Moriarty, at 34 the oldest of them, describes himself as a super-patriot and says he was eager to go to Iraq to exact some payback for the 9/11 attacks. By the time he returns home to his wife, two young children and a blue-collar job, his views have changed a little. While his support for the war has not wavered, he notes that he hated every minute he spent in Iraq and would not go back "if they paid me half a million dollars."  Specialist Moriarty disdains the idea that he is fighting a war for oil, but Sgt. Steve Pink insists on it. "This better be about money," he says,  and about securing access to Iraqi petroleum. "We're not the Peace Corps."    Sergeant Pink, whose diaries display a restless literary talent, is alive to the absurdity and the horror that surrounds him and aware that what he is living through will mark him forever. Of the three he is the funniest and the angriest, and his swagger can't entirely conceal his sensitivity.  Sgt. Zack Bazzi, a fluent speaker of Arabic and a reader of The Nation, loves being a soldier even as he expresses skepticism about the war and frustration at the prejudice and indifference some of his comrades express toward the Iraqis they are both protecting and fighting against. An immigrant from Lebanon (he becomes a citizen after his tour in Iraq is over), Sergeant Bazzi leaves behind a doting mother who can't quite believe that her son, having escaped the Lebanese civil war as a child, has now chosen to risk his life in another Middle East conflict.  Most of "The War Tapes" takes place in 2004, as the insurgency intensifies (and, almost incidentally, the American presidential elections come and go). Stationed in a camp near Baghdad that is among the most frequently attacked targets in the country, the guardsmen are assigned to protect supply convoys,  trucks operated by KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton. It is a hair-raising job, as they speed through chaotic traffic in their armored vehicles, trying to avoid civilian motorists and pedestrians, to say nothing of car bombs, improvised explosive devices and gunfire. Such attacks are frequent and are captured on camera with jarring immediacy.  So is a firefight in Fallujah, where the unit is sent on counter-insurgency operations at one point. The cameras also capture telling details of the Iraqi landscape and its people, and moments of unguarded emotion. The daily routine in Iraq is a roller-coaster of rage, fear, sorrow, loneliness, pride and exhaustion.  "The War Tapes," like most movies of its kind, acknowledges the enormous gap separating those who fight from those who stay home. In some ways the most painful scenes take place after the guardsmen come back and try to negotiate the transition from the grim, violent deserts of Iraq to the comforts and irritations of ordinary American life.  No one else can comprehend what they've been through, certainly not the audience members, who will at least try. Specialist Moriarty complains that nobody really wants to hear his stories, even though someone will occasionally express some polite curiosity. And Sergeant Pink, drinking beer with his girlfriend, muses that people don't really know what to say to him, and that there's nothing they can say that he really wants to hear. But then on second thought, and with some prompting, he admits that there is one sentence he doesn't mind hearing: "I'm glad you're home.

A new breed of war film, shot and narrated over the course of a year by three soldiers who took cameras with them into the thick of battle, Deborah Scranton's "War Tapes" provides a uniquely eyes-on, triple-pronged look at the unfolding of "Operation Iraqi Freedom." Mini-cams mounted on dashboards, gun turrets or helmets capture, with unsettling immediacy, the campaign's sudden explosions, chaotic ambushes and 24/7 sense of uncertainty. But the pic's deepest fascination lies in the soldiers' complicated reactions to the war, perceived simultaneously as funny, horrific, stirring and traumatic. Limited arthouse run may snowball since film impacts all camps.
Invited to embed herself in the New Hampshire National Guard, journalist/documentarian Scranton opted instead to give cameras to willing participants of Charlie Company en route to Iraq. With the helmer and grunts keeping in touch via email and instant messaging -- key sequences are uploaded -- the film became an ongoing collaborative enterprise, with the core team later including producer Robert May ("The Fog of War") and producer-editor Steve James ("Hoop Dreams").
The soldiers chosen for camera-carrying duty fit no preconceived personality profile, each individual incorporating seemingly contradictory beliefs and values that complexly intermix in the crucible of combat.
Sgt. Steve Pink, a 24-year-old carpenter and aspiring writer, joined the National Guard to help pay for college. His highly imaginative journal, read aloud over shots of charcoalized bodies and scattered human remains, wavers tonally between the philosophical and the grotesque.
Spc. Mike Moriarty, a 35-year-old mechanic with a wife and kids, volunteered right after 9/11 and passionately hates the war experience although he's fiercely protective of American interests.
Sgt. Zack Bazzi, a 24-year-old Lebanese-American student whose mother brought him to America to escape war, loves combat (he served in Bosnia and Kosovo) but harbors no fondness for the occupation. He decries the troops' potentially lethal ignorance of cultural differences (demonstrating the American hand signal for "stop" that means "hello" in Iraq).
All three are united in their unswerving loyalty to the troops and the surprising cynicism of their belief that the U.S. is in Iraq for the money.
Eerie greenish nighttime sequences of riding shotgun for Halliburton convoys down flat stretches of road lit by the occasional fireball are followed by daytime vistas of Iraqi school children passing nearby the beleaguered Charlie Company compound, the soldiers themselves marveling aloud at the juxtaposition.
Helmer Scranton breaks the first-person nature of the coverage with interspersed interviews with the girlfriend, wife or mother of the camera-toting soldiers, the women detailing their struggles on the homefront and testifying to the profound changes they detect in their menfolk upon their return.
Tech credits are consonant with the high-concept "you are there" nature of the exercise, the camerawork rocked by out-of-nowhere shells, grenades and car bombs.

Among the Bush era's political docs, something called The Cult of the Suicide Bomber  might seem a media redundancyhaven't we heard enough? No, as it turns outDavid Batty  and Kevin Toolis 's rough-hewn film, made for British TV, matter-of-factly enters the mosques, homes, shrine rooms, personal spaces, and neighborhoods of Muslim martyrs, probing the suicide bomber paradigm as it grew out of the Iranian Revolution and became a global phenomenon. The remarkable primary instrument in use is Robert Baer , the exCIA opcum- author personified by George Clooney  in Syriana . Calm, reasonable, and obviously intimate with Mideast life (no translators are necessary), Baer qualifies as the film's third auteur: He narrates, controls the investigations, gains access to scores of places and interviews we've been led to believe were off-limits to Westerners, and interviews the families of the dead, Hezbollah  members, Israeli secret service generals, even imprisoned Hamas  soldiers.
Throughout, a precise history is offered mostly from the perspective of Arabs, and the issue of martyrdom as an ideological movement is both scanned thoroughly and illustrated mercilessly with footage often culled from the terrorist organizations themselves. This is not the can't-we-get-along Arab-Persian world we see in most liberal nonfiction films, but a broader and helplessly apocalyptic view of an entire region crazed with anger, frustration, and bloodlust into objectifying death as a weapon, a cause for cosmic glory, and little else. (Martyrdom is a desirable choice even among the secular Syrian Socialist National Party , which Baer cannot fathom.) Forgive the 60 Minutes  style cutaways to Baer, and the experience of Muslim life knotted by destructionnot a TV pundits' opinions of suchcan be eye-opening. Perhaps only someone with Baer's experience and gravitational field could strike the film's refreshing political balance, appalled by the violence but never ignorant of its origins in U.S.-sponsored oppression.
Ignorance is not rare, however. On a strictly experiential level, Deborah Scranton 's The War Tapes  is remarkable, tactile, and affecting; as a piece of sociopolitical culture with context and ramifications of its own, it's a worthless ration of war propagandaethnocentric, redneck, and enabling. A journalist given clearance for embedment with the New Hampshire National Guard , Scranton  instead handed out video cameras to a handful of guardsmen, and her film is an edit of that footageplus predictable interviews with their families at home, worrying and bucking up. In fact, for all of the firsthand, edge-of-battle immediacy, the upshot of Scranton's assemblage is concern for the feelings of tremendously sympathetic American grunts as they bulldoze through the Arab landscape and disdainfully observe the indigenous populace from a distance as if they were hyenas on the veld. It's no surprise that the soldiers are largely prone to mercenary self-regard and care only about getting home, not about where they've been, what they've done, or why. But what about us? The cinematic equivalent to a ribbon magnet, The War Tapes  reaps festival awards while less tunnel-visioned docs (like Laura Poitras 's My Country, My Country ) go undistributed. So much for dissenting media channels.
