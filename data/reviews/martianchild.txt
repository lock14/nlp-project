Only in Hollywood can a movie about alien children be boring. Even if the kid isn�t really an alien (no spoilers), there�s still opportunity galore for the wild and the weird. In the hands of director Meyjes, a movie about a boy convinced he�s from Mars becomes Little Orphan Annie. Adapted (by screenwriters Seth Bass and Jonathan Tolins) from the semi-autobiographical book by famed sci-fi writer David Gerrold, the film follows David (Cusack), a widower and successful science fiction author who decides to adopt a 6-year-old boy (Coleman). The child is Dennis a recluse whose abuse and abandonment issues have left him convinced he�s from Mars. This includes quaint little idiosyncrasies such as wearing a weight belt to fight Earth�s gravity and renaming the family dog Flomar (it�s Martian for �warm furry friend�). Once David brings Dennis home, the movie becomes a quirky relationship dramedy between fledgling father and son. And the two make a decent pairing. Coleman�s solid understated performance contrasts well with Cusack�s neurotic first-time dad. While attempts to play baseball, attend school, and generally be �normal� all lead to various contrived hijinks, Cusack�s genuine talent evokes a few smiles and maybe even a chuckle. But the lamely predictable script combined with the complete absence of any cinematic daring results in about 10 heavy sighs for every quiet laugh. Joan Cusack (who, like her brother, has great comedic timing) appears as (natch) David�s sister. And love blossoms with David�s deceased wife�s best friend (Peet). It�s all just so � perfect. That is, of course, when the boredom begins. There are absolutely no surprises as the film disintegrates into its own cutesy display. Platt shows up as David�s literary agent and Huston as his demanding publisher, but neither presents any genuine conflict. Schiff (The West Wing
) wanders through as a by-the-book caseworker, pushing the film to its inevitable climax: Will the state break apart this happy little family? The answer? Take a wild guess. Unfortunately, the worst part isn�t the predictability. I suppose I can roll with unsurprising. No, the worst part is that the caseworker conflict isn�t really the climax. Oh, no. That�s the fake out. You have to sit through another 20 or so minutes wondering, �Shouldn�t I be in the parking lot right now smoking a cigarette and bitching about how Hollywood just doesn�t get it?� Nope, you�re sitting through the end of the film.


"Martian Child" is one soggy slab of sentimental uplift, but it doesn't pretend to be anything else, and there's some honor in that. Or maybe I've just been cutting John Cusack slack ever since he hoisted that boom box over his head in "Say Anything."
He plays David Gordon, a successful science-fiction author, a widower, and - if we're to believe the script adapted by Seth E. Bass and Jonathan Tolins from a novella by David Gerrold (himself a successful sci-fi writer who penned the classic "Star Trek" episode "The Trouble With Tribbles") - a lifelong misfit. Since Cusack remains the most congenially sane of working movie stars, that's a stretch, but no matter.
Mired in grief but looking to move on, David decides against the better judgment of his agent (Oliver Platt) and sister (real-life sibling Joan Cusack) to adopt a child. Not just any child, mind you, but a little boy so socially maladjusted he lives in a cardboard box. Dennis (Bobby Coleman) believes he's from Mars and that the sun's rays will fry him to a crisp. In the real world, he'd probably be diagnosed a schizophrenic and dosed with heavy meds, but the world according to Hollywood sends him home with David for 100 minutes of bonding and life lessons.
Coleman is adorable without being obnoxious about it, and he plays Dennis as a whispery wounded bird; you want to reach in that box and take him home yourself. The best scenes in "Martian Child" let David and Dennis knock around the former's well-appointed house, slowly opening up to each other. Cusack's earnest befuddlement works well in such a setting, and he makes each line of dialogue a little aria of seriocomic distraction. Faced with this boy who fell to earth, David creates an in-home alternate environment. "Think of it as a bigger box," he says.
The film's most radical notion is that it takes an eccentric to raise an eccentric, and that the rest of the village would do well to leave them alone. I'm not sure whether this is true, but it feels good, and that's what "Martian Child" is selling. Snarking away on the outsides of the house are a meanie social worker (Richard Schiff), the harried and very funny Joan Cusack, Platt's spineless agent, and a dragon-lady publisher played by Anjelica Huston. "I want Harry-bloody-Potter in space," she rages at David, who's way over deadline. "Why can't you just be what we want you to be?"
Any frazzled parent recognizes that sentiment, whether it ever slips out or not, and in its moist and obvious way "Martian Child" recognizes the difficulty of remaining unique in a lockstep world. A tougher movie wouldn't downplay Dennis's real emotional damage, but a tougher movie probably wouldn't bring on Amanda Peet as David's late wife's free-spirited best friend whose protective presence gives the boys some needed space.
Because we have places to get to, "Martian Child" eventually cooks up a few late-inning plot crises and a teary, hug-filled climax. The strain shows. The heart of this mawkish yet touching drama is far simpler: A good man and a troubled boy working hard to connect. Only in the movies does the work ever stop.


Dennis (Bobby Coleman) is a weird kid who thinks he's from Mars. David (John Cusack), a science-fiction writer/widower, adopts him anyway. The problem with Martian Child  is that it wants to be a story about outcasts, but Dennis doesn't come off as a cute little rebel. Hiding in boxes, speaking Martian, and stealing pictures of David's dead wife, he comes off as mentally disturbed. Cusack, less guarded than usual, makes a few scenes connect; it's not his fault the movie inadvertently turns you against the overindulgent parenting culture.

 Trend spotters (and actresses) take note. This season John Cusack is struggling with parenthood and worlds of sorrow: In “Martian Child” he plays a novelist widower hoping to adopt a small, broken boy, and in the forthcoming “Grace Is Gone” his working-stiff widower grapples with trying to break the bad news to his girls. In each movie the beloved is already out of the picture, which allows Mr. Cusack  instantly to take possession of the screen with his trademark sensitivity. Nice guys rule, and don’t you forget it.  Mr. Cusack receives fierce competition in the “aw” department in “Martian Child” from a golden retriever (the noble Bud)  and a wee killer called Dennis (Bobby Coleman), who arrives in a cardboard box literally marked “Fragile” and “Handle With Care,” and who comes equipped with trembling lips and a load of cute. But Mr. Cusack is not one to relinquish the spotlight without a fight. Like W. C. Fields he takes the challenge presented by animals and children seriously. And so he bobs, weaves, weeps, plays with the volume, kisses the girl (bashfully, naturally), stutters and smiles, tucking his chin just enough to make those dark, pooling eyes look even more inviting. Come on in, the water’s just fine.  Written by Seth E. Bass and Jonathan Tolins from David Gerrold’s short story, “Martian Child” is 100 percent goo. There’s nothing wrong with the setup — man meets boy, surrenders heart — but there’s little right about the delivery. Menno Meyjes, who last directed Mr. Cusack in “Max,”  appears never to have met a visual cliché he didn’t want to embrace, an emotion he didn’t want to milk or an obvious idea he didn’t want to broadcast. He lets Mr. Cusack cut loose and go lazy, while the support team (Joan Cusack, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet) smilingly basks in the star’s glow. You might think that Bobby Coleman wouldn’t stand a chance, but this kid bats his lashes like Joan Fontaine. The audience wept; I just cried uncle.  “Martian Child” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some tart language.

Knockout performances by John Cusack and child actor Bobby Coleman help legitimize a whimsical but sententiously moralizing script about the wonders of parenting in helmer Menno Meyjes' "Martian Child." Soppy tale of a widower who adopts a kid who believes he's from Mars is transformed, through thesps' intensity, into a nicely weird, often engrossing two-hander, though no one else in the excellent cast fares as well. Since the two lead actors are almost constantly onscreen, "Martian Child" only occasionally thuds to Earth. Opening wide Nov. 2, the New Line release could find a cozy holiday niche. 
David (Cusack), a successful sci-fi author still grieving for his wife two years after her death, considers adopting Dennis (Coleman), an orphan who spends most of his time in a cardboard box since, being Martian, he fears exposure to the sun. Gradually winning the boy's trust through gifts of sunglasses and sunblock, David takes Dennis into his house on a trial basis.
Sister Liz (Joan Cusack, injecting a much-needed sense of comic harassment into her thankless straight-sis part) feels David might not be ready to handle a child -- especially one who wears a weight belt so as not to float away, and steals others' belongings to collect data for future Martian study.
David bonds with Dennis through baseball games and a shared state of alienation, David himself having sought refuge in fantasy worlds as a child and even now as a professional adult imagineer. He's supported in his tentative parenting techniques by gorgeous friend Harlee (Amanda Peet), who inevitably morphs into a romantic interest as the film progresses.
School officials, orphanage boards and conventional wisdom, however, insist David's role as parent is to socialize the kid, not join him in his fantasies. Such is the conformity-vs.-self-expression axis the film drives home with a sledgehammer.
Scribes Seth E. Bass and Jonathan Tolins have adapted sci-fier David Gerrold's semi-autobiographical novella, reiterating and underscoring every truism ad nauseum. During the pic's many heavy-handed learning experiences, auds may find themselves counting the number of ways protags are exhorted to "be themselves."
Helmer Meyjes effortlessly enables the satisfyingly idiosyncratic exchanges between Cusack and Coleman, including a nifty Martian line dance, but turns clueless when dealing with the script's more egregious epiphanies. Meyjes skirts outright parody at David's book-launch party, where his publisher (Anjelica Huston) and agent (Oliver Platt) plaintively ask him why he can't just be what they want him to be.
Lacking the built-in poignancy of Cusack's other recent troubled-parent turn in "Grace Is Gone," "Martian Child" gathers all the accoutrements of the perfect family (beautiful, understanding girlfriend, adoring golden retriever) to offset a child's belief in an alternate universe from which he has been expelled. Coleman, his face gleaming palely under layers of sunblock, is genuinely offbeat enough to have auds wondering, along with Cusack, whether the kid actually arrived from another planet, yet also achingly vulnerable and perceptive enough to overcome the script's facile schmaltz.
Those seeking originality, subtlety or even serious parenting tips should look elsewhere (improbably, the word "autistic" is never uttered, even to deny the possibility that Dennis might be). But pic should satisfy those seeking warm-and-fuzzy holiday fare with a couple eminently empathetic actors.
Tech credits are polished.

Martian Child  certainly isn't much fun, unless you were desperately awaiting K-PAX  with a kid instead of Kevin Spacey . Not that there's ever any question whether Dennis (Bobby Coleman ) is actually a Martian, but the conceit's more or less the same: The kid sports sunglasses, lest the sunlight melt his eyeballs; builds elaborate contraptions meant to connect him with his home planet; and spends his time conducting field research before the aliens return to spirit him back to Mars. A sci-fi writer who knows nothing about being a father, John Cusack 's David Gordon  adopts Dennis and believes his own experiences as a boyhood outsider will allow him to heal the wounded child. But Cusack and Coleman feel like they're in two separate moviesCusack in the one about the single dad trying to get his shit together, Coleman in the one about the strange boy who steals things and hangs upside down. Theirs is less a connection than a forced living arrangement brokered by agents and studio bosses.
