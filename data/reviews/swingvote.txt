Costner�s new comedy is fueled by the absurdity of the balloting debacle of the 2004 presidential election, as well as the proximity of the 2008 vote. That may make Swing Vote
 timely, but that doesn�t make the film good. Swing Vote
�s premise takes absurdity to a whole new dimension, while the film�s humor is cynical and its plot development stagnant � until, of course, a third-act redemption comes along to salvage the ideals of democracy (although the overall cynicism makes even this tonal turnabout seem artificial). The story requires a serious suspension of disbelief: No matter how ridiculous things get with electronic voting-machine mishaps, hanging chads, and court interventions, Swing Vote
�s scenario posits an election process that ignores the constitutional safeguards that are already in place in the eventuality of a tie vote. Costner plays Bud Johnson, an affable drunk who is kept afloat mostly by the attentive ministrations of his young but precocious daughter Molly (Carroll). When Bud passes out drunk and doting Molly attempts to cast his vote in his place, an electronic voting-machine glitch records only that Bud cast his ballot, but not for whom he voted. A national dead heat prompts both candidates (Grammer as the Republican and Hopper as the Democrat and Tucci and Lane, respectively, as each candidate�s chief campaign operative) to travel to Bud�s double-wide trailer in Texico, N.M., to bring their campaigns to the only voter who now matters. It�s a spectacle indeed, as the Republican starts touting ecological preservation and the Democrat comes out in favor of bans against abortion and immigration. Bud is given 10 days to recast his vote while a media phalanx parks outside his trailer, the candidates personally court him, and TV news personalities (including cameos from, among others, Aaron Brown, Campbell Brown, Tucker Carlson, James Carville, Mary Hart, Arianna Huffington, Larry King, Bill Maher, and Chris Matthews) weigh in on the unprecedented situation. Costner easily plays the ne'er-do-well Bud, but the character and the film never develop any forward momentum: All the characters continue to hit the same notes over and over. Plus, some side plots � most notably, Winningham's single but immensely disturbing scene � are irrelevant tangents to the story. However, the most regrettable aspect of the story is screenwriters Stern and Jason Richman's failure to acknowledge the debt they owe to Garson Kanin's 1939 film, The Great Man Votes
, one of John Barrymore's last performances, in which he plays an alcoholic widower with two kids, who is personally courted by mayoral candidates when it turns out that he is the only registered voter in an important precinct. Swing Vote
 may muster a few easy laughs, but the film is no contender.


With several months left before the presidential election, "Swing Vote" arrives to remind you what's important. The movie goes on and on about honesty. Illegal immigration, gays in the military, and abortion all come up. But to paraphrase a successful presidential campaign: It's the screenwriting, stupid.
"Swing Vote" is comedy about a 12-year-old who winds up voting for president because her father was too drunk to do it himself. The whole fictitious election comes down to her fraudulent vote, which, because of a power outage at the polling station, didn't count. So both campaigns (Republican incumbent Kelsey Grammer versus, of all people, Democrat Dennis Hopper) and a frenzied news media (Mary Hart, that includes you!) descend on dusty little Texico, N.M., where Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner), a single dad and factory worker, and his daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll), live in what passes for poverty in the movies - a modest house full of nicely art-directed clutter.
The ensuing activity - 10 days for the recently fired Bud to pretend to have cast the original vote, make up his mind, and pick a winner - puts a dolt in the lap of the American political machine. Or is it the other way around? Neither side seems all that comfortable with their assignments. The folks running the respective campaigns - Nathan Lane (blue) and Stanley Tucci (red); neither in top form - don't understand Bud, and Bud doesn't understand the issues. Nor does he care to vote, which is fine with us. But he's an embarrassment to Molly. His crimes include being oblivious to what "civic responsibility" even means, and it really burns her up.
Molly is basically raising Bud. She wakes him up with breakfast every morning, drives him home from the bar, and leaves him notes urging him, more or less, to be a father. This is social tragedy presented as tidy sitcommery. As Molly, Carroll furrows her brow and juts out her mouth to make us see a plucky little woman rather than someone more pitiful. The movie italicizes, bolds, and underlines her self-sufficiency, along with everything else. The night Bud forgets to vote he smacks his head on a sign that reads, "Vote today." In a display of restraint, the director and co-writer Joshua Michael Stern declines to have him hold up a sign saying, "Ouch."
When the local reporter (Paula Patton) asks Molly what she'd like to do for a living, Molly says "veterinarian or chairman of the Fed." Not to be all social services, but you have to ask how a girl who barely knows her mother and has a useless father turns out to be such a well-adjusted angel and judgmental patriot. There is the fact that she's the daughter of a Kevin Costner character, and while the star has played his share of lovable losers, this one is unworthy of his redemptive charm.
"Swing Vote" is a satire that's afraid to satirize. It's predicated on so many forces of incompetence converging in a single spot that it feels like farce for dummies. A movie about two presidents and their operators pandering to one man could have produced a withering comedy. But it's reluctant and restrained when it needs to be ruthless. The fake ads the campaigns concoct after hearing where on the issues Bud stands aren't bad. (And there's an odd marijuana motif - there's Bud, and Dennis Hopper is playing someone whose last name is Greenleaf, trying to woo a guy named Bud.)
Otherwise, the movie has no teeth, no vision, and no real insights. It also lacks a sense of modernity. It's 2008. Why are we still microwaving Frank Capra's old casseroles? The movie turns racism, class woes, and social issues into jokes instead of engaging them with intelligence, wit, or a whiff of drama. All we get are platitudes (see, every vote really does count). Many are contained in Bud's big speech at the end of the film. Before he reads it to America (with sudden eloquence), he tells someone, "Oh God, I think I'm going to puke." Me, too.


The covert intelligence embedded in the boobish political comedy Swing Vote  states that we the people are stupid, drunk, apathetic, or all of the above. But on the face of it, the Capra-esque civics lesson conveyed in this pandering fantasy is that every citizen's vote is crucial to the American electoral process. Not only that, but by properly appreciating the precious gift of participatory democracy (as encouraged by a wise, liberal Hollywood), even the sorriest dumb-ass can shape up overnight into an informed, thoughtful activist, someone deserving of change we can believe in.
Through fictional preposterous happenstance inspired by the real-life preposterous happenstance in Florida that decided the 2000 presidential election, the outcome of the presidential race in Swing Vote 's alternative America rests on the ballot about to be cast by one citizen, a clueless shlub named Bud (Kevin Costner ). Bud, a direct descendant in temperament and blood-alcohol level of the elbow benders Costner played in Tin Cup   and The Upside of Anger , is a screwup and factory worker in a small New Mexico town. Often he doesn't wait until his shift is over to begin his real job of boozing and passing out. Bud is also the divorced father of a preternaturally mature 12-year-old daughter, Molly (Madeline Carroll, a pint-size Ellen Page in training); the girl cooks, cleans, rouses her father from his stupor each morning in the cluttered trailer home they share, and excels in school by writing essays about the importance of civic participation, etc. So while both the incumbent Republican president (Kelsey Grammer , smoothly embodying a kind of distant relative of our actual Republican president) and the Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper , in a sly bit of casting) go about pandering to their target voter, Bud treats his extraordinary circumstances with all the doltish entitlement of a game-show contestant.
Costner (who's also a producer) plays to his middle-aged strengths in a role that exaggerates male weaknesses. A beer guzzler in a trucker's cap, Bud has accepted pickled self-absorption as a daily condition, and Costner throws himself into a display of know-nothingness with an endearing ease that only comes to a movie star who, in all seriousness, once played a man with gills. But the movie's queasy garble of soft-core satire and rote idealism, as well as its uninspired reworking of old ruts in political comedy, becomes wearing. (Stanley Tucci  and Nathan Lane  are equally broad playing win-at-all-costs Republican and Democratic campaign managers, respectively.) It's difficult to shake the sense that director Joshua Michael Stern (Neverwas  ), who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jason Richman (the upcoming Bangkok Dangerous ), is laughing  not with the Buds and the strategizing politicos of the world, but at them.
In Stern's attempt to have it both ways, his satiric targets prove at once both easy and inconsistent. Journalists are portrayed as spineless when they're not being duplicitous or heartlessly competitive; small-town America is the province of hicks, except when it suits the art direction to celebrate quaint custom to sentimental advantage. And even as Bud slouches toward responsibility and cleans up his act as a father, this redemption must come at the expense of presenting Molly's troubled mother (played in a brief, passionate, no-joke turn by Mare Winningham ) as an unnurturing wreck.
All the while, well-known pop cultural celebrities, journalists, and pundits mingle freely as themselves. This blurring of boundaries between entertainment and politics is nothing new  how many times have we watched Larry King  and James Carville  play ''King'' and ''Carville''? But the head count of real personages tickled by the opportunity to be treated (and remunerated) as contributors to commercial fakery is dispiriting. Aaron Brown , Tucker Carlson , Arianna Huffington , Bill Maher , and Chris Matthews  buy into the circus, as do Willie Nelson  and race-car driver Richard Petty. By the time Bud sincerely apprehends his citizen responsibilities (with an assist from Molly and her hard work as her father's keeper), Swing Vote  has swung irrevocably toward condescension.

 A pleasant muddle about life, liberty and the pursuit of Budweiser, among other noble and base causes, “Swing Vote” is also one of the most surprising, politically suggestive movies to come out of Hollywood this year. Topped by a gruffly appealing Kevin Costner as a good ole drunk whose vote will decide the American presidency, it takes place in the kind of New Mexico town that might once have been thought of as Capraesque, but in depressed spirit and hard-times  veneer comes across like a Dust Bowl Hooverville. The film has a Red State setup —  the Nascar champ Richard Petty zooms by  —  and a serious case of the blues.  Directed by the relative newcomer Joshua Michael Stern (“Neverwas”), who wrote the screenplay with Jason Richman after, it appears, watching Garson Kanin’s 1939 movie “The Great Man Votes” (in which John Barrymore’s boozer has  a decisive vote), the film takes its sweet time getting going. Mr. Costner’s entrance as the resident everyman, Bud Johnson, couldn’t be less heroic or  more  symbolic: he’s passed out and snoring, stretched out in last night’s jeans, when his 12-year-old  daughter, Molly (Madeline Carroll), disgustedly shakes him awake. A former cover-band musician whose life has become a blur of benders, Bud has turned his beery nickname into a lifestyle. This drink’s for him, and so are the next 11.  Bud isn’t bad, of course, just one of those good-time guys who has reached a dead end after too many wrong turns. He and Molly live alone in a tumbledown trailer (the girl’s mother went AWOL long ago) with stained walls and no telephone or hot water. He barely makes it to  his factory job and when he gets there, you understand why. With his friends Walter (Judge Reinhold) and Lewis (Charles Esten), he packs chicken eggs in a swirl of feathers. It’s a living, if not anything like the high-flying kind that often shows up in modern Hollywood, where leading men tend to play cops and robbers or white-collar variations on doctor, lawyer and corporate chief. Factories belong in other countries (China), other movies (documentaries) too.  The story kicks in after Bud, having promised Molly he would vote in the presidential election, ends up zonked out in his truck. One thing leads to another flatly outlandish thing, and before you can grumble high-concept hooey, both the conservative presidential incumbent, Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer, all smiles), and his liberal opponent, Donald Greenleaf (a tamped-down Dennis Hopper), have descended on Bud’s town. Accompanied by the usual fast-talking handlers, stone-faced Secret Service men, news twerps and gadflies, the candidates take sneaky, then obvious turns pulling Bud this way and that  —  his choices come down to either nuclear annihilation or the rainbow White House  — until they themselves have been bent so far out of shape, so contorted by politicking, that they’re almost unrecognizable.  As a message movie, “Swing Vote” couldn’t be louder, even if it can be difficult at first to know which message it wants to send. Molly, a walking, talking megaphone, delivers a speech during a class presentation — a left-leaning  warning about voter complacency leading to enslavement  —  that  attracts the notice of a local television reporter, Kate Madison (Paula Patton), a looker with major-network dreams. Her boss, played by George Lopez at full volume, can’t wait to escape, either, which broadcasts another message. Namely that the small town as it was idealized by Hollywood is no longer just a potential trap, the way it seems to James Stewart in Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life.” It’s a dying and dead  zone.  If that doesn’t sound riotously funny, it isn’t. But neither is “Swing Vote,” despite Bud’s crinkly grin, some slapstick, a few comic faces (Nathan Lane’s included) and a handful of belly laughs, the biggest of which skewer anti-abortion and anti-immigration rhetoric. This being Hollywoodland, the movie refuses to take sides  — actually, it takes them, it just doesn’t admit that it does. There’s no doubt who’s right and who’s not. The candidates aren’t party ideologues, though; they’re decent men led astray by fear and ambition. Bud himself has been sidelined by drink, apathy and bad luck, but also by forces beyond his control, and the movie doesn’t pin his woes exclusively on him. His American dream was as much stolen as squandered.  As it swerves from comedy to drama, from light laughs to dark thoughts — an emotionally brutal scene with a fantastic Mare Winningham as Molly’s mother nearly tears a hole in the film  — “Swing Vote” becomes less cohesive and more interesting than it was when Bud crawled out of his first hangover. Unlike classic Capra heroes, those readymade saviors of the people, Bud has been gripped by indifference for far too long to take much notice of anyone beyond his daughter and a few friends. Though the intrusive wall-to-wall music tries to lighten (and direct) the mood at every interval, melancholy clings to this film. Mr. Costner, who eases into his role gracefully, isn’t playing the hero,  just a guy who has to save himself.  In this he certainly isn’t alone, as the plump public in “Wall-E” and some Gotham citizens in “The Dark Knight” in turn discover. Though Bud’s initial indifference brings to mind those two films and their suddenly awakened populations, “Swing Vote” is a mainstream, eager-to-please, relatively generic endeavor, not an auteurist showcase. Mr. Stern does nice work with the actors, even the weak ones. But it’s difficult to pick out a distinctive voice amid the loud music  and equally blaring commercial imperatives that mandate that even the sharpest political jabs be delivered with smiles. In Hollywood every cloud has a silver lining, and this one also comes with Willie Nelson.    “Swing Vote” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The expletives are undeleted.

Graced with a gently cynical spirit and more brains than its average-Joe protagonist, "Swing Vote" applies a pleasing Frank Capra-esque glaze to the fanciful story of a blue-collar American whose vote ends up being the only one that counts. Result may not be the sharpest slice of political theater imaginable, but pic's comic smarts and affecting daddy-daughter drama provide a sturdy platform for its heartfelt advocacy of informed voting and responsible citizenship. Broad commercial potential and impeccable election-season timing aside, Disney's oddly misleading ad campaign won't help this ingratiating, old-fashioned, decidedly nonpartisan entertainment earn the B.O. ballots it deserves.
From its opening shots of America's heartland, handsomely photographed by Shane Hurlbut and accompanied by the downright patriotic strains of John Debney's score, "Swing Vote" feels like a throwback to a more innocent era (well, that or a Stater Bros. commercial). Fortunately, scribe-helmer Joshua Michael Stern ("Neverwas") and co-writer Jason Richman have supplied their cheerily implausible premise with almost enough real-world interest -- issues touched upon include the environment, abortion and gay marriage, but not terrorism -- to mirror our more troubled times.
An idealistic, intelligent 12-year-old, Molly (Madeline Carroll) is used to being disappointed by her irresponsible, heavy-drinking single father, Bud (Kevin Costner). On the morning of the presidential election, Molly urges her dad not to forget to vote, promising to meet him later at the polling place in their tiny hometown of Texico, N.M.
Naturally, Bud misses their meeting, and Molly impulsively decides to cast his vote for him. Through a series of events that don't seem all that hard to swallow, given recent real-life polling mishaps, the machine registers that "Bud" voted, but not whom he voted for. And when the insanely tight race ends up coming down to New Mexico's five electoral votes, Bud's lowly ballot -- which he is allowed to recast in 10 days -- is fated to determine the next commander in chief.
Given that this loopy premise could have been taken in any number of directions, Richman and Stern have done an admirable job of exploring the many possibilities within the simplified context of a family film -- albeit one with enough salty language and grown-up discourse to warrant a PG-13 rating.
Pic spreads its satirical wings as voracious reporters and political-interest groups descend on Bud and Molly's trailer home, while the anxious candidates -- Republican incumbent Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) and Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) -- arrive in Texico to personally woo the undecided voter.
Amid the winings and dinings and mountains of swag, the script earns its biggest laughs with a series of hilariously barbed, Bud-skewed campaign ads that illustrate how readily some politicos will abandon their party beliefs to win an election. Generous fake coverage by the likes of Larry King, Tucker Carlson and Mary Hart (among the many celebrities, pundits and personalities making cameos here) adds to the in-joke verisimilitude.
As Molly grows increasingly disillusioned with politics and disappointed that her dad is "a dumbass" (in the words of Bill Maher), the pic, taking its cue from such Capra classics as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Meet John Doe," paves the way for Bud's redemption -- and, by extension, the mobilization of the voting audience. While it's a letdown that "Swing Vote" turns out to have no more substantial political ideas than either of its vanilla candidates, it's hard not to be stirred by how earnestly the film implores viewers to educate themselves and exercise their rights, or by how boldly it casts its hero as a stand-in for unsophisticated, apathetic schmoes everywhere.
Playing a guy who's irascible, unshaven, perpetually hung over and prone to swearing in his daughter's presence, Costner wins over the viewer, paradoxically, with his utter indifference to whether the viewer likes him or not. Thesp's vanity-free turn strikes engaging sparks with the disarmingly self-possessed Carroll, who's cute as a button but almost too precocious for this world.
While the presidential candidates are interestingly cast against type (Hopper, who gleefully parodied George W. Bush in George Romero's "Land of the Dead," just seems more GOP than the debonair Grammer), their campaign strategists, though played with cutthroat wit by Nathan Lane and Stanley Tucci, aren't given much to do. Paula Patton is appealing as an ambitious TV reporter, with a typically boisterous George Lopez as her boss.
Filmed near Albuquerque, N.M., the expertly mounted production evokes an effortless small-town feel, balanced by occasional glimpses of the Oval Office or Air Force One. Crowded country-western soundtrack includes two songs by Costner's band, Modern West.
