''Derailed" is a tawdry, predictable hunk of movie headcheese, and I still had a pretty good time with it. As I walked out of the movie theater, though, I reminded myself that critics see these things for free and that if I'd paid $9 plus Goobers and Coke like everybody else, I'd doubtless feel rooked. The issue here is return on investment, and the ROI on this businesslike but not very bright little thriller starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston is minimal, if not in the red. If you stumble across it at Blockbuster, though, or, better yet, if you turn on pay cable and it's just starting, power down your brain cells, get a bowl of Chubby Hubby, and settle in.
The plot is as pulpy as the airport novel from whence it came. Frazzled suburban family man Charles Schine (Owen), a Chicago ad exec with a distant wife (Melissa George) and diabetic teen daughter (Addison Timlin), flirts with a fellow commuter on the train. She's a financial adviser named Lucinda Harris (Aniston), and she has legs a middle-age man might focus on while pretending to read The Wall Street Journal. She also has a cool exterior that hints at a softer core; this constitutes the one lonely nuance of Aniston's performance in ''Derailed," and, thespic duties thus dispatched, the actress is free to look dazed while contemplating visions of Angelina Jolie in a wood chipper.
Charles and Lucinda's coy banter leads to lunches, which lead to a dinner, which leads to an erotically charged cab ride, which leads to a hotel . . . and now I have to leave you at the doorstep, because there are surprises afoot. To quote Charles as he helps his daughter with her book report in the film's opening scene, ''The author seduces the reader by twisting the narrative so you never know what's coming next." (Yes, it's the first movie script written in yellow Hi-liter.) If you're willing to play as dumb as the characters, though, you stand to be shocked when ''Derailed" takes a sudden turn for the ugly.
The rest of us are just glad Vincent Cassel has turned up, dripping merry French psychosis. The bad-boy actor (''Irreversible," ''Ocean's Twelve") plays Philippe Laroche, an amoral street thug set on terrorizing Lucinda and blackmailing Charles into emptying his bank account. The neat trick of any Cassel performance is that it's perched on the knife edge of gentility and homicide, and so it is here: Philippe can beat Charles until his ears bleed in one scene and in the next be sitting in Charles's home in a trim suit, charming his victim's wife and daughter with naughty Gallic wit. When Charles comes home, the two women look at him like he's the plumber.
Owen walks through the film like a very good-looking two-by-four, and I guess that's a sensible approach; he knows he'll outclass the material if he's not careful. So the juice in ''Derailed" is in the supporting roles, including RZA as Winston, the office mailboy and former jailbird who becomes Charles's unlikely protector on the mean streets of Chicago. The rapper/producer/composer gives his character a sweet smile and dead eyes.
After enough implausibilities and plot twists have piled up, ''Derailed" backs itself into a nifty little scene where everyone's gun points at everyone else and you wait for the first shot to start the pinballs flying. If director Mikael Hafstrom had given the whole movie the stupid, unrepentant energy of that scene, we might have had a fine piece of B-movie sleaze. As it is, ''Derailed" suggests classic film noirs like 1945's ''Scarlet Street" (just out on DVD, and talk about return on investment) stripped down to pure functionality. Sometimes that's enough, but only on TV and only when no one else is awake.

         "Derailed" is a silly, lurid, pulpy thriller that's not nearly lurid and pulpy enough to be much fun, but more than silly enough to be ludicrous. Directed by Mikael Håfström from a vaguely familiar screenplay by Stuart Beattie, it ushers in every twist and turn with gong-banging foreboding, as though each next big reveal were paying a formal visit to the Addams family.
 
  The movie, the first to be released by the post-Miramax Weinstein Co., stars Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston as a couple of married executives (he's in advertising, she's a financial advisor) who meet on their morning commute, exchange a few anomic, Cheeverish pleasantries and embark on an accelerated flirtation that culminates in attempted infidelity. Their tryst is thwarted when a French-accented thug breaks into their room in a fleabag hotel and enacts, with theatrical relish, the worst nightmare of guilt-ridden, well-heeled adulterers everywhere.
 


         






    Rather than nail its characters to the bed they've made, "Derailed" spins off into nefarious mastermind territory, all the while slogging through a predictable rehash of the cinematic dangers of cheating on your wife — especially if you happen to be an upper-middle-class executive, your wife a gorgeous blond schoolteacher and your daughter a vulnerable, sickly waif whose fourth kidney transplant you've scrimped and saved for. A story as tabloid-pungent as this requires actors willing to ham it up Adrian Lyne-style — to lunge, bellow, toss their manes in anguish, bolt upright in the tub gripping a butcher knife at a jaunty Norman Bates angle. And actors as appealing and attractive as Owen and Aniston deserve a story in which they're allowed to explore emotions other than hangdog guilt and grim restraint.
 
  What the material doesn't call for is measured pacing and a straight face, which only serve to highlight the utilitarian feel of much of the dialogue and several of the characters. When Charles Schine (Owen) informs his wife that there's been a sudden change in their financial picture, for instance, she hits on the idea of selling the house. "We already have two mortgages on the house," Charles replies patiently, as though initiating a child in the mysteries of household finances. "Selling it wouldn't do us any good." This is not so much dialogue as underlining. Observant viewers, or even just viewers who have been around the block a few times, will recognize Charles' oddly intimate friendship with the office mail clerk, Winston (RZA), as imminent plot point fodder. You just never know when a friendly connection to an ex-con from the 'hood may come in handy.
 
  If Håfström has accomplished the difficult task of making Owen seem ineffectual and lumpish and Aniston sharp and grim, he's made Vincent Cassel's slick, versatile, multilingual arch-villain LaRoche improbably florid and cartoonish. In one scene, LaRoche delivers violent, dirty threats in mellifluous French, charming his hapless American victims, with their sadly short-sighted disdain for foreign language education, into thinking he's making nice when in fact he's describing some nasty things he'd like to do to daddy.
 
  An odd cultural tone-deafness pervades the movie, giving it the feeling of a standard Hollywood thriller that's been retranslated from a translation. The result is a not uninteresting, if probably unintentional, reflection on the accumulation of mindless junk clogging the cultural landfill. Not to dwell, but the whole thing feels a little Swedish. How else to explain a couple of Chicago executives happening upon a $49-a-night hostel just off Michigan Avenue? Or the scene in which Charles bumps into LaRoche's sidekick Dexter (Xzibit) on the street and apologizes, and Dexter replies, "Sorry don't pay the bills or stop world wars or feed the poor"? Or the one with the cops who come across Charles sheepishly lurking by his parked car in a dark alley, his companion slumped over the wheel of the car, and decide to challenge his manhood for not picking up their prostitute friend instead of checking out the vehicle? Or the fact that the man who appears to be Chicago's lone homicide detective (Giancarlo Esposito) dresses like Willie Brown and orders drinks like Sam Spade. "Scotch, drop the rocks," he tells the bartender. "Sure, buddy," you wish the bartender would say, "as soon as you drop the pose." "Derailed" seems to want badly to be described as contemporary noir. But it's just pitch-dumb.

Clive Owen's darkly handsome, adult gravitas lends itself to playing characters who think, brood, and then act. An Owen man accepts the consequences of his conflicted choices, which is why he generated all the heat in Closer ; he also treats his own killer sex appeal casually, which is why he would have made such a sterling James Bond (not that there's anything shabby about Daniel Craig, blimey). Owen gamely serves up more of the same in Derailed  playing Charles Schine, a Chicago commuter who gets caught up in a whole lot of ugliness on account of a dame not his wife. But the actor's substance is squandered in a junky thriller that mistakes brute-strength plot twist, showy violence, and the against-type participation of Jennifer Aniston (as Lucinda, the dame) for earned excitement.
Charles meets Lucinda when he misses his train and catches another, i.e., derailment No. 1. She's attractive, seductive  she's got the made-for-close-up facial mobility of a TV star  and he's harried, at odds with his wife, and worried about his seriously ill daughter. One thing leads to another, which leads to a hotel-room tryst, i.e., derailment No. 2. But the liaison is interrupted when Charles is robbed and Lucinda is brutally raped by a furious sadist named LaRoche who says horrible, movie-dialogue things while slapping the famous former Friend  around.
Then comes more bad stuff, as LaRoche proceeds to blackmail Charles, threaten Lucinda, and monologize in variably accented English. The odds are even that reaction to the twist, when it comes, will be huh! Or duh. Or whaaaa? The movie's most notable dubious achievement is a sense of cultural dislocation  it's a coarse, nasty, obvious bit of mischief set in Chicago as seen through the eyes of out-of-towners who have created a Euro ChiTown. In this stereotyped America, two out of three black characters are played by rappers for the touristic fun of casting and hanging around with rappers  and of those, one's an office mail-room guy with a criminal record (RZA), the other's a thug (Xzibit). (The nonrapper is Giancarlo Esposito as a cop.)
Derailed  is the English-language feature debut of Swedish director Mikael Håfström (his surer 2003 movie, Evil , received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film), written by Australian screenwriter Stuart Beattie (Collateral ), and costarring French actor Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Twelve ), who hams it up as le rapist. And as Charles' troubles mount, who's upstanding ad executive and family man gonna call? The African-American office lackey with the rap sheet, of course, because that's the kind of hackneyed shortcut to character that passes for a bright idea in a movie gone off the tracks like this.


Basically "Unfaithful" for men, "Derailed" is a nightmarish cautionary tale about a husband who strays from the marriage bed and ends up paying for it throughout the rest of the movie. Predicated on the novel but unrewarding spectacle of Clive Owen getting smacked around for nearly two hours, this murky psychological suspenser manages the tricky feat of being as predictable as it is finally preposterous. One can only hope it will be mostly uphill from here, artistically and commercially, for the fledgling Weinstein Co., whose first release this is.
Pic reps a fascinating intersection of cultures both in front of and behind the camera: Directed by Swedish helmer Mikael Hafstrom, here making his Hollywood debut, the cast features two Euro thesps (Owen and Vincent Cassel), two hip-hop artists (RZA and Xzibit) and one all-American sweetheart (Jennifer Aniston). Result is a perplexing stew that, in its insoluble blend of tones, temperaments and hackneyed genre standards, at times plays like a high-toned exploitation picture.
Charles Schine (Owen) is on the verge of a mid-life crisis, underappreciated by his wife Deanna (Melissa George), their sickly daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) and the swanky Chicago advertising firm where he works. A missed train hurls him into the path of the lovely, sassy Lucinda Harris (Aniston), who turns out to have an unhappy marriage and a daughter of her own.
After some initial flirting that somewhat ill-advisedly references Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint's naughty transcontinental banter in "North by Northwest," Charles and Lucinda begin to date and confide in one another. Just as they are about to consummate their relationship, however, a Gallic gunman named LaRoche (Cassel) bursts into their motel room, beats Charles to a pulp, steals his wallet and, in a hideous, leering scene, forces himself on Lucinda while her would-be lover lies helpless in the corner.
Terrified that the truth about their affair will come out, Lucinda and Charles opt not to file a police report. Soon, however, LaRoche begins threatening Charles by phone, demanding first $20,000, then $100,000 in cash.
Protag's subsequent actions serve as a textbook example of what not to do if you're ever blackmailed by a violent psycho rapist, with the screw-loose LaRoche and his henchman Dexter (Xzibit, in an effective showboating turn) decisively maintaining the upper hand. Charles' decision not to go to the police comes back to haunt him, while his pitiful efforts to fight back, at one point involving his ex-con co-worker Winston (RZA), lead to terrible repercussions.
Repeatedly emphasizing Charles' inability to protect Lucinda, his family or himself, "Derailed" derives most of its juice from a sort of free-floating castration anxiety -- a threat made literal in one scene when LaRoche grabs Charles by the nether-regions and throws him against the wall of his own home.
Owen has always been at his best playing smooth British badasses in films like "Croupier" and "Gosford Park," and it's simply no fun seeing him as a dumb schmuck. Despite a lingering hint of an English accent that lends the role a somewhat rarefied, cosmopolitan air, thesp can't help but tamp down his own natural charisma.
After years of indifferent rom-com typecasting, Aniston, in her first thriller role since 1993's cult classic "Leprechaun," delivers a damsel-in-distress performance that convinces scene by scene, though her relatively brief screen time precludes the possibility of desperately needed character development. Overall chemistry between the two leads is wan at best.
For his part, Cassel has fun with an outrageously over-the-top turn, as his character's villainous role reversals require him to switch between French and thuggish American accents with almost Meryl Streep-like aplomb. Still, he's been more magnetic and convincingly volatile in his European body of work.
Working from James Siegel's novel, screenwriter Stuart Beattie ("Collateral") demonstrates an ear for literate dialogue and plays scrupulously fair with the clues -- perhaps too scrupulously, as the inevitable plot twists likely will surprise no one who's been paying attention. Everything from the story's bookend structure (the opening and closing scenes are set in prison) to the abundant references to other crime movies -- Charles finds himself in a succession of Hitchcockian wrong-man scenarios, and, in addition, at one point even sports a "Chinatown"-style nose bandage -- suggests a vain attempt to bring coherence and wit to frankly implausible material.
Stylistically, Hafstrom is all over the map, veering from the scuzziest back alleys of Chicago to the cool urban menace of Charles' workplace, yet never really developing the race and class tensions that fitfully puncture the narrative. Rap-heavy soundtrack makes for an interesting fit with Edward Shearmur's trance-inflected score.

It's probably fitting that the Weinstein brothers' first release after their gory split with Disney  deals with shattered marital fidelity and the vengeance rained down upon the guilty party. They must, however, be a little bummed that Derailed  isn't quite a consummate kiss-off. In the wake of A History of Violence , which wickedly subverts the vigilante genre, this "shield the family" thriller doesn't add any nuance to the conversation. That said, as the harried adman whose hormone-spurred bad judgment leads down a nightmare rabbit hole, Clive Owen  proves he can just about save anything. His hangdog virility in Closer  provided the heft and hurt that made the otherwise mannered roundelay seem credible. Here, he smolderingly complicates the moldy Fatal Attraction  morality tale we've seen so many times before.
As his shifty train companion and object of desire, Jennifer Aniston  makes a dazzling corpo-flirt. Her knowing delivery turns dim lines into effective, sexy quips. Like In Her Shoes , the script is hampered by lots of sub-HBO  interstitial banter. At one point, when RZA, who successfully milks his role as Owen's ex-con mailroom pal, asks his friend to list baseball players with 11-letter surnames, Owen rattles them off like he's been waiting for this particular question all his life. Later, Owen's teacher wife, played by Melissa George  (that the couple has a pre-teen daughter seems bizarre), risibly laments that she "handed out an English composition during math hour." Of all possible teacher gripes, this?
In terms of taut plot, Derailed  doesn't exactly hold together either, but it's good at pretending it does. Mikael Hafstrom 's direction, in the noir vein, moves along with a satisfying pulse. He views Chi-town with European eyes, giving the El a kind of elegance and the fratty Rush Street bar scene some funny cosmopolitan frisson.
As a sign of post-Miramax  films to come, Derailed  hints at the brothers W's trademark brio over detail, suffering too in some ways from the untrammeled hotness of its villain. Ocean's Twelve 's criminal sophisto-cad Vincent Cassel  gambles big on crafting an iconic scary-comic malefactor like Nicholson's Shining  schizo, or more modestly, De Niro's Cape Fear   water moccasin. But as a French-accented baddie in the heart of a hog-butcher town, he instead veers dangerously toward Robert Shaw 's subway hijacker in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three a cartoonish archvillain with a nagging sense of decorum. His rough methods make him a sort of street-scrapping Hannibal Lecter . But like Shaw, as Derailed  wears on, Cassel starts to seem fatigued with his own brash demands, overblown psycho constructs, and slithery ripostes. Ultimately, he's just too smooth for the story's thug tactics. There must be easier ways for this guy to skim from yuppie scum. You want to hand him a Scotch and suggest he take up insider trading.
