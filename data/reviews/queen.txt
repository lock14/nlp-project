Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal. That, at any rate, is the most promising key I'm fiddling with these days while trying to unlock the secrets of Mirren's power in The Queen , a superb re-creation of events in the week following the death of Princess Diana in 1997. I realize my notion is simply that of just another Mirrenite who has been smitten and awed by the actress in equal measure for decades, from The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover  to The Madness of King George  through all six seasons of Prime Suspect  to date, as millions were dazzled by Diana herself. But the insight may help to explain why this engrossing and unexpectedly penetrating drama, with its truly fresh perspective on how response to the news of one dead princess recalibrated the relationship between the British monarchy and the masses, is more than just another pop entry in history's ongoing Dianathon.
With prickly dignity of bearing, precision of aristocratic diction, and the gestures of one born and bred to command even in domestic activities as intimate as dialing a phone, walking a dog, or reading the morning newspapers over breakfast, Mirren conjures Elizabeth as an identifiable flesh-and-blood wife, mother, grandmother, and woman with a job to do. She also conveys the importance  and the majesty, unaffected by political fashion  of the institutional Elizabeth II of the House of Windsor, Head of the Commonwealth and Defender of the Faith, a living embodiment of her empire's proud history. In a bathrobe or a crown, watching the telly or receiving curtsies, Mirren's self-possession is a grace that appears at once willed and innate. As she did earlier in the year playing Elizabeth I on HBO, the actor excels at projecting the imperial, not the imperious.
And if that doesn't do enough to explain the thrall of The Queen , there's always the ingenuity of this particular Diana angle itself to commend the season's most unlikely grand entertainment  an art-house production that might even appeal to big Saturday-night megaplex crowds. Sidestepping a whole lot of media hyperventilation with a discretion that does not prevent evenhandedness, director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan (who also co-wrote The Last King of Scotland ) nevertheless convey important sociological information. They explore how the sensational death of a flashy divorcée (smashed in a car in Paris with her Egyptian lover) was felt so deeply by a populace who identified with the glamorous People's Princess. They question Elizabeth and her quite clueless husband, Philip (marvelous James Cromwell), for remaining so unresponsive to the need their subjects had for an official sign of Windsor bereavement. (The Queen  suggests that only Prince Charles seemed to get it, and he was, in small ways and big, in no position to overrule his mother.) They admire the way Tony Blair (Kingdom of Heaven 's Michael Sheen, avoiding caricature), then a youthful, progressive prime minister brand-new to the office, navigated between the growing discontent of the people, the blood scent picked up by the media, and the elaborate delicacies of etiquette when dealing with the labyrinth of palace functionaries.
The Queen  pays serious attention to how an ancient monarchy operates in a modern country briskly uninterested in (and even disapproving of) day-to-day Windsor life, and how, really, it took the People's Grief to breach walls of mutual disregard. And Frears, who probed class ugliness in melting-pot England with far less delicacy three years ago in Dirty Pretty Things , shows extraordinary discernment and restraint in his choice of settings: Elizabeth (already on the throne for 45 years) receiving Blair and his antimonarchist wife, Cherie; Elizabeth in her family rooms eating supper on a tray with her wily old mother (Sylvia Syms); Elizabeth and Philip touring the mountain of flowers piled outside their palace, chatting with selected onlookers in a ritual indistinguishable from a stage performance.
Which brings me back to Mirren, bewigged in her character's impregnable Hairspray  'do, or reading a televised message to her people through matronly eyeglasses. It takes daily effort to keep that hair and those specs going year after year, prime minister after prime minister. It takes a sense of duty, even when a woman wants to stay in a bathrobe and weep. Mirren shows us what it's like to want to weep  and then, by the grace of God, to rule. She rules.

 Is there something in the air, say, the stench of death and decline of empire, to have inspired the recent spate of films about imperial power? Fashionistas of course are already worshiping at the altar of “Marie Antoinette,” with its title bubblehead and hollow charms, while Forest Whitaker devotees are savoring the outré venality of Idi Amin in the rather too enthusiastically entertaining “Last King of Scotland.” Those who think more crowned heads should have rolled in the 18th century, in the meantime, can cozy up to “The Queen,” a sublimely nimble evisceration of that cult of celebrity known as the British royal family. (It opens the New York Film Festival tonight at Lincoln Center and in theaters tomorrow.)  Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, who helped write “The Last King of Scotland,”  also about crazy rulers and the people who love (and hate) them, “The Queen” pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of  the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. It begins just days before her fatal car crash in 1997, when the princess, glimpsed only in television news clips and photographs, had completely transformed into Diana, the onetime palace prisoner turned jet-setting divorcée. The transformation was fit for a fairy tale: the lamb had been led to slaughter (cue Madonna’s “Like a Virgin”) and escaped in triumph (crank the Material Girl’s “Bye Bye Baby”). Elizabeth II wore the crown, but it was Diana who now ruled.  How heavy that crown and how very lightly Helen Mirren wears it as queen. With Mr. Frears’s gentle guidance, she delivers a performance remarkable in its art and lack of sentimentalism. Actors need to be loved, but one of Ms. Mirren’s strengths has always been her supreme self-confidence that we will love the performance no matter how unsympathetic the character. It takes guts to risk our antipathy, to invite us in with brilliant technique rather than bids for empathy. Even Mr. Whitaker’s Idi Amin seems to shed some tears. Ms. Mirren’s queen sheds a few too, but having climbed deep inside Elizabeth II, a vessel as heavily fortified as a gunship, she also coolly takes her character apart from the inside out, piece by machined piece.  This toughness is bracing, at times exhilarating, and it also reminds you of just how very good a director Mr. Frears can be; certainly it’s a relief after the shameless pandering in his last venture, “Mrs. Henderson Presents.” The new film serves as a return to form for the director not only of “Dangerous Liaisons” and “The Grifters,” both of which share with “The Queen” an interest in toxic tribal formations, but also of more freewheeling ensemble entertainments like “Sammy and Rosie Get Laid.” The focus in “The Queen” remains fixed on Elizabeth and her relationship with the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), but it also finds room for a host of smaller, precisely realized characters, each adding daubs of gaudy  or grim color.  The  secondary characters prove especially crucial because it’s through their dealings with the queen, their awe and boobishness (including James Cromwell’s dim-bulb Prince Philip), that we start to get a handle on her. A creature of history and ritual, Elizabeth might have been born in another century (or on another planet), a point Mr. Morgan lays out on the page and which Mr. Frears illustrates with lapidary attention to visual detail. Much of the story takes place inside Buckingham Palace and at Elizabeth’s Scottish estate Balmoral, sepulchers in which the royals have shut themselves up with their servants and riches. Certainly the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) seems half-dead already, her carefully planned funeral almost an afterthought. It’s no wonder the outside world seems so intrusive, even when its knocks are delivered by white glove.  Diana’s death interrupts Elizabeth’s sleep in more ways than one: a gentle hand comes knocking, and in time so does the rest of the world, which takes to the abbreviated life of Our Lady of Televised Confession with passion that in time borders on the religious, the hysterical, the mad. Shortly after Prince Charles (Alex Jennings, both sniveling and sly) brings Diana’s body back from Paris, the queen retreats to Balmoral without comment, not a hair on her tightly coiffed head out of place. Her stubborn quiet only fuels the clamorous sorrow of the public, which lays thousands of bouquets before Buckingham Palace, gestures of mourning that turn into a veritable barricade as overt in menace and purpose as the upturned paving stones of the French Revolution.  The ensuing crisis of confidence solidifies Blair’s power, bringing the monarchy one step closer to the  oblivion it deserves.  As Elizabeth strides around Balmoral in tweeds and sensible shoes, back in London Blair undergoes a metamorphosis of his own, becoming the official voice of healing.  Eager to please his masters, queen and public both, he makes the most of Diana’s death, setting his stamp on the next decade. His wife (Helen McCrory) can only cast an increasingly leery eye at his performance of grief. (Oh, to be a fly on that household wall.) She may not yet know it, but this is a battle, and she’s losing: Blair doesn’t just mourn Diana; he all but becomes a new sacrament, offering up his own touchy-feely persona for public consumption with smiles and moist eyes.  There is something appealingly puppyish about the prime minister’s buzzing excitement as the crisis reaches its apex: he’s seizing the day like a bone. But like all dogs Blair needs someone to bring him to heel, and while Elizabeth’s authority is more ceremonial than actual, she and he play their part in the pantomime of power.  It’s this pantomime that fascinates Mr. Frears, who unmasks it as much as he does the queen, whose dusting of face powder and glazed stare pointedly evoke another, earlier, Elizabeth. Yet if the director shows us the woman beneath the Kabuki-like facade, it’s not to transform her into a softie, hankie at the ready; it’s to strip away the mystique that once shored up the monarchy’s real power and now merely serves as a fig leaf for its spoils.  Diana consecrates Blair, but so  does Elizabeth, whose bafflement at the sharing-and-caring of “the people,” as she calls them, almost marks her for extinction. Her slow-dawning realization of the  cultural shift  that had already changed the country is beautifully realized, though not because the actress and her director mistake the queen’s intelligence for sentiment. Elizabeth no more likes Diana after death than before. When the queen does break her silence, as we know she will, having watched the moment on television once upon a time, it isn’t because of this vexing young woman. It’s because  Elizabeth, standing alone in the Scottish countryside, Mr. Frears’s camera hovering close and then moving off to take in the glorious view, has finally understood  not only the implications of her past but also those of the present.  “The Queen” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Tradition and informality collide -- and mutually benefit -- in the deliciously written and expertly played "The Queen." Dramatized version of the week following the death of Princess Di, from the different vantage points of the British royal family and newly elected Prime Minis-ter Tony Blair, cheekily mixes on-the-nail perfs and docu footage into a witty and finally moving re-creation of a period that challenged both royals and pols. Toplined by a socko per-formance from Helen Mirren, the small, upscale pic should prove a modest theatrical suc-cess on the back of heavy promo and positive crix, with lotsa ancillary mileage.
Film preemed Sept. 2 at the Venice fest to major plaudits, and should prove a classy opener at the New York fest Sept. 29. It's the second collaboration between helmer Stephen Frears and scripter Peter Morgan after their 2003 TV movie "The Deal," which re-created in a similar way the pri-vate arrangement struck between Blair and (current Chancellor) Gordon Brown over sharing of power if New Labor won the election.
Opening on May 2, 1997, "The Queen" picks up almost where "The Deal" left off, as Blair (Mi-chael Sheen, encoring) and wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) are on a high with news of their overnight landslide victory. That day, they go for the traditional audience with the queen (Mirren), to be "invited" to form a new govern-ment. Anti-royalist Cherie is scornful of the whole procedure; Blair is boyishly nervous; the queen is politely scornful of the populist upstarts.
Almost four months later, all the players are woken by news of Diana's car crash in Paris -- "What's she done now?" gripes Prince Philip (James Cromwell) -- and, as they all gather round TVs in their pajamas, her subsequent death. Queen Elizabeth (never a Diana fan) is icily controlled, seeing it as a private family mat-ter. Blair, still hugely popular but untested as a leader, senses a potential crisis in the making. But his spinmeister, Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley), is already on the job, jotting down the words "peo-ple's princess."
Caught on their summer vaca-tion at Balmoral Castle in Scot-land, rather than at London's Buckingham House, Elizabeth battens down the hatches and refuses any official comment. Despite enormous outpourings of national grief and media pressure, she won't entertain Blair's request for a public funeral, chiefly on protocol grounds that, when she died, divorced Diana was no longer a member of the royal family.
With the bit between his teeth, egged on by Cherie, Blair opines: "They screwed up her life; let's hope they don't screw up her death." He seizes the political opportunity in an emotive speech in which he uses the term "peo-ple's princess," and later is pri-vately supported by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who agrees the royals must "modern-ize" and meet the mood of the country.
During the next five days, lead-ing up to Diana's funeral, the twin poles of protocol vs. pragmatism, private grief vs. public mourning and duty vs. opportunism bend this way and that. The queen, battered by the media, is gradually persuaded by Blair to come out of her foxhole and meet public demand halfway.
What's cleverest about Mor-gan's script is that Blair himself is shown learning from the queen's professionalism and eventual sense of duty, to the point where he defends her against Cherie's and Campbell's anti-royal sneers. But his admiration is more that of a political survivor than anything else, of a man still insecure in his new job who can learn from someone who's been at it for almost half a century.
In one of the script's several neat refs to the present day, Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that "one day, quite suddenly and without warn-ing, the same thing (public hostil-ity) will happen to you," rendering the perky pol momentarily speech-less.
Like "The Deal," pic is essen-tially about the finessing of a problem and the lessons learned during it. But the emotional and ethical borders of "The Queen" are much larger, giving the movie an extra heft that makes it play well on the bigscreen.
Much of that heft also is due to Mirren's performance, which starts off as simply an uncanny look-alike job, with the cut-glass accent down to a T, and gradually takes on layers of texture. Thesp reaches into the royal's most private mo-ments -- rigorously writing her private diary, or alone on a Scot-tish moor -- without tipping into bathos or pure impersonation. 
In the latter half, Sheen also manages the same trick, to the point where the crucial phone calls between the two, who only meet face-to-face at start and finish, start to pack a real emotional punch as they find a mutual rap-prochement.
Supports are all on the button, with often creepily accurate body language -- from Yank Cromwell's blithe Prince Philip, through McCrory's snide Cherie, to Baze-ley's cocky Campbell and Jennings' contrite Prince Charles. Roger Allam discreetly fills in the background as the queen's private secretary, and vet Sylvia Syms is almost unrecognizable as the waspish, seen-it-all Queen Mother, who's quite content to talk about her own forthcoming fu-neral.
Alexandre Desplat's music, generally over docu footage, provides a sense of drama at key points. Frears' decision to shoot the royals' scenes on 35mm and the Blairs' on handheld Super-16 -- contrasting the formality of the former with the informality of the latter -- works far more subtly in practice than it sounds in theory, largely because it's not overdone by d.p. Affonso Beato (an Almo-dovar regular).
Color in print caught had a slightly muddy quality that actu-ally helps create a sense of "pe-riod" distance, even though that heyday of Cool Britannia was less than 10 years ago.

The Queen , which opens the New York Film Festival  on Friday and goes into release the next day, is more fun than any movie about the violent death of a 36-year-old woman has a right to be. It's also as exotic an English-language picture as the season is likely to bring.
Directed by Stephen Frears  from Peter Morgan 's script, The Queen  is set in the peculiar bestiary that is Britain's royal family during the traumatic week between Diana Spencer 's fatal car crash and the state funeral that the British public forced into existence. The film's theme is the monarchy in the age of mechanical reproduction. It opens by boldly quoting Shakespeare  ("uneasy lies the head . . . ") and intimating a droll disdain for democracy by Queen Elizabeth  (Helen Mirren ) in the face of "modernizer" Tony Blair 's 1997 landslide.
The new PM (lookalike Michael Sheen ) bumbles through a rote royal meeting, then faces his first crisis some months later with Di's death. He grasps the implications, but her majesty's bedchamber is barely rumpled by the news. "Charles, isn't this awful?" Elizabeth asks her son, before denying him the use of the royal jet to fly to Paris to recover his ex-wife's body. Summering at Balmoral castle in Scotland , the Windsors quibble over protocol, oblivious to the mass outpouring of grief back outside Buckingham Palace . "I think the less attention we draw to it, the better," Elizabeth primly declares. Her instinct is to do nothing. Blair's is infinitely savvier. The politician steps into the breach, hailing Diana as "the people's princess."
Frears cuts between the cheeky operatives in Blair's office and the clueless royals ensconced at Balmoral. Although a great symbolic stag wanders into the proceedings as if from Narnia , it's the repeated use of Diana's actual image that, paradoxically, grounds the movie both in reality and myth. (The archival footage is skillfully integrated. The climactic funeral is particularly well edited, with Diana's peers Tom Hanks  and Tom Cruise  visible in the crowd and the actors playing royals shown, as if on TV, uncontrollably twitching during the eulogy given by Diana's brother.)
The integration of doc and drama is integral to The Queen  's meaning in that Diana's apotheosis was a true triumph of the image. Pursued by paparazzi, the world's most photographed woman died in what might have been the subject for one of Andy Warhol 's silk-screened "disasters." For a full week, her posthumous presence monopolized the TV news, which amplified spontaneous expressions of grief into a massive instance of collective theater, a public ritual performed for the camera. Small wonder that the cloistered House of Windsor  was flummoxedespecially since, for them, Diana was an actual person.
Because the image rules, The Queen 's real queen is Diana. But because the movie is essentially a high-wire acting stunt, its star is Mirren. Could the actual Elizabeth exhibit anything approaching the actress's wit or timing? Could she be nearly as intelligent in her confusion or stylish in her regal dowdiness? The script's attempts to humanize the monarch (she mutters "bugger it" when her jeep gets stuck, suffers the conjugal nickname "cabbage") are less important than the elegance with which Mirren offers her interpretation. The script even allows her to acknowledge her own canny impersonation, sniffing that "nowadays people want glamour and tears, the grand performance."
Where Mirren's performance is grandly controlled, the other royalsdescribed by the irrepressible Cherie Blair  (Helen McCrory ) as a bunch of "freeloading, emotionally retarded nutters"are shown as innately comic. His every expression a paralyzed grimace, Prince Charles  (Alex Jennings ) is a pathetic Bertie Wooster  type poignantly trying to creep beneath Blair's wing, hoping that his mother will take the bullet (real or metaphoric) otherwise meant for him. The tipsy Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms ) is mainly upset that Diana's funeral will poach on the plans she had made for her own interment while Prince Philip , played for maximum unpleasantness by James Cromwell , is the designated royal pain.
Philip compares the crowds outside Buckingham to "hordes of Zulus" besieging a colonial outpost and calls buttinsky Blair a "bloody fool." Blair, of course, is an idealistic commoner and hence the movie's hero. "Will someone please save these people from themselves because as prime minister I really have nothing better to do," he snaps at his staff before manfully shouldering his responsibility to queen and country. Thanks to him, Elizabeth stoically realizes her duty, however grudgingly. By the movie's end, Blair is totally identified with Elizabeth's pain all the way back to her uncle's abdicationas are the filmmakers. No less than any showbiz personage, she has submitted to the tyranny of ratings.
Frears has never redeemed the early promise of Bloody Kids , nor returned to the form of My Beautiful Laundrette , nor made anything nearly as ambitious as Sammy and Rosie Get Laid . Nevertheless, The Queen  is his career-cappermaybe even his knight's move. Whether or not Tony Blair actually saved the British monarchy, Frears has made it seem so and even worth doing.
