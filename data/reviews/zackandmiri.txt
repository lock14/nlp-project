Smith�s new film proves that even though you may be able to take the boy out of Jersey, there�s still no chance of sidetracking the filmmaker�s dominant id. Setting Zack and Miri Make a Porno
 in Pittsburgh, across the Jersey state line, has not diluted Smith�s distinctive comedic raunch in the least. The film�s title alone should make that clear. However, there is also a sweetness to Zack and Miri
, which, when combined with the film�s perfect casting, makes this Smith�s strongest film since 1997�s Chasing Amy
. A romantic comedy, the film is so faithful to the standards of the Hollywood form as to be almost conventional � but for its obvious porno and scatology. Though it�s the films of Judd Apatow (a fellow traveler in the realm of sweet raunch) that brought Rogen�s unique leading-man-manqu� talents to Smith�s attention, in Rogen, Smith has also found a screen soulmate. Co-star Banks, too, is a veteran of the Apatow world, and her charming turn here as Miri, when combined with her current dramatic performance as Laura Bush in W.
, is certain to provide the wide-ranging actress her breakthrough moment. Smith combines these Apatow players (Robinson, as well, comes from that crew) with some of his own regulars (Mewes and Anderson) and some knowledgeable porn stars of today and yesteryear (Lords and Morgan) to create an ensemble that�s beautifully in tune with his aesthetic. Zack (Rogen) and Miri, best friends since high school, live together platonically in Pittsburgh, though the unpaid bills are stacking up and things are getting kind of drafty since the heat�s been turned off. At their high school reunion, an encounter with a pair of male porn actors (played hilariously by Superman Brandon Routh and Mac shill Justin Long � characters fully deserving a sequel of their own) provides Zack and Miri with an idea of a way to raise some cash: Make their own porn film. They figure their friendship is strong enough to withstand sexual contact for the sake of the rent, but in true romantic-comedy fashion, their onscreen carnality leads to offscreen epiphanies about the true nature of their love for each other. Awww. Meanwhile, in an unexpurgated Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland style, Zack and Miri draft a fun little team of makeshift filmmakers and actors to shoot their movie. This creation of community is part of the film�s overall warmth and bonhomie. Smith gives the appearance of wanting to provoke, but along with his smuttiness, he wears his heart on his sleeve.

It's just possible that Kevin Smith has found a way to beat the economic recession and the energy crisis at the same time. Regardless of which candidate takes next week's election, this soft-centered, down-and-dirty comedy foresees an era of mom-and-pop pornography that could well erase the national debt and lift the national libido. At the least, we'll stay warm through the winter.
Rudely silly rather than transgressively shocking, "Zack and Miri" is the sort of bawdy but fundamentally decent farce you could take Grandma to, provided Grandma were familiar with the oeuvre of Traci Lords. Seth Rogen, on loan from the Judd Apatow universe, and Elizabeth Banks (last seen playing Laura Bush in "W.") are longtime best friends, roommates, and losers living in the Pittsburgh area. Times are tight and Zack's job as a surly barista isn't cutting it. When the water and electricity are shut off, desperate measures are called for.
Mickey and Judy would have put on a show in a barn. Smith, the strip-mall Preston Sturges responsible for "Clerks," "Dogma," and "Chasing Amy," understands that porn has become the great American leveler  - an Internet-fueled democracy of basic animal urges open to any entrepreneur with a digital camera. So Zack writes a script (this being Smith, it's initially a series of obscene variations on "Star Wars"), finds a cast and crew (this being Smith, longtime companions Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson turn up; so does Apatow semi-regular Craig Robinson), and starts rolling.
The jokes in the first half of "Zack and Miri" are raucous and liberating, riffing on the notion that sexual stallions and bubbleheaded vixens are just out there, waiting for that one Craigslist ad that would allow them to hop off their Facebook pages and onto the screen. Mewes's character is a priapic Joe Average who walks in and is ready to go. Lords herself shows up as a local sex worker; this is a little like enlisting Whitey Bulger for a supporting role in "The Departed."
If you go in expecting explicit body parts and illegal acts, you'll be disappointed; Smith wants his R rating intact. More to the point, he'd rather laugh at the absurdity of people making a sex film when they should just be having sex. For all their teasing camaraderie, Zack and Miri are drearily uptight about each other; the most outrageous laughs come in an early high school reunion scene when the class dreamboat (Brandon Routh of "Superman Returns") brings his husband, a gay porn star played with all stops out by Justin Long. The real gag of "Zack and Miri Make a Porno," though, is that making a porno is work, not sex. Zack discovers to his surprise that he's a pretty good producer, and as his confidence grows, so does his certainty that he doesn't want anybody "acting" with Miri except himself. Rogen's face is an unmade bed of sexual and romantic frustration.
Banks, as a particular kind of small-town potty-mouth beauty, matches Rogen stride for stride, but both actors seem confused when "Zack and Miri Make a Porno" decides to become an conventional romance in the home stretch. Smith makes the smart point that real lovemaking looks nothing like the aerobic Iron Man contests of porn, and he knows why, too: Other peoples' emotional intimacy can be downright embarrassing.  Here, sadly, it's also  boring.
If Smith's mushy stuff felt half as fresh as his knack for intelligent crudeness, "Zack and Miri" might be one of the better movies of the year, and certainly the most scurrilous. The irony is that with a title as good as this one, he went ahead and made a Mickey and Judy movie anyway.

Technically, Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) do make a porno in Zack and Miri Make a Porno . The platonic duo, friends since high school and now housemates with the sort of bad credit rating and depressed ambitions we've come to expect from the yakety slackers in many Kevin Smith comedies, put out a casting call for people willing to perform sex on camera. The Zack-and-Miri version of thinking big? Maybe homemade porn will pay the bills. (Zack the java monkey's minimum-wage job at a Starbucks knockoff would make presidential candidates weep with election-season empathy.) The pair even volunteer their own services, willing to ''do'' sex on screen if that's what it takes to get the electricity turned back on.
Of course, what Zack and Miri actually make  and what Rogen and Banks power their way through with a cherubic energy above and beyond the call of duty for a premise so inconsequential and puerile  is another Kevin Smith comedy. And what the amateur filmmakers recapitulate in the porno embedded within Zack and Miri Make a Porno  is the usual stuff of that proud son of New Jersey's repertory, only with more giggling over boob jokes, gay jokes, mall jokes, panty jokes, and high-school-back-in-the-day jokes. A Smith production is always noisy, shambling, and liberally smutty on the outside while conservatively gooey on the inside (and always, proudly, a visual eyesore, as if compositional coherence signifies selling out to the Man). This iteration, climaxing with the making of the porno movie within the movie, is all of the above, with Smith on—okay, not steroids, but maybe a Venti Frappuccino half skim with foam. And ogling boobies.
The sex talk is dirty and silly; the sex action in porn scenes, while ostensibly dirty (with the exaggerated assets of former porn actress–turned–winking parody of a porn actress Traci Lords fully bared) is even sillier; and the 10th high school reunion that Zack and Miri decide to attend just to assure themselves that ''even though we're broke and didn't amount to anything...we're better than these people'' is a thicket of scores to be settled for past snubs that still sting.
The simplistic message, however, is one any church pastor might give: Sex isn’t sexy without love, commitment, and fidelity. The established auteur who made Clerks  (un  and deux ), Mallrats , and Chasing Amy  may now be a 38-year-old husband and father who heads a successful production company, but he's still got cheap advice for schlumpy twentysomething guys like Zack. (Zack's notion of getting lucky at the reunion, FYI, is receiving a quicky handjob from a bitter, married classmate who's enraged because her husband is flirting across the crowded room.) The advice: Find someone as luscious and, amazingly, available as Banks' Miri, and the electricity will magically switch on by itself.
Well, duh. Of course  Zack and Miri are meant for each other  why else cast that huggable Fozzie Bear Rogen or the delectable Banks, who, let's face it, looks like the Girl Least Likely to End Up a Loser? When Zack and Miri do finally get it on  an intimate scene that even bad cinematography can’t ruin  their lovemaking, though strategically covered up, is the one naked moment of emotion (and yes, eroticism) in this otherwise coarse movie's whole tired, simulated premise. And still, Smith throws in a limp third act before the dunderheads can admit their obvious lurrrve .
Besides Rogen and Banks, the cast is a scroungy mix of Smith regulars (including Jeff Anderson and muse Jason Mewes), porn pros (including Lords and Katie Morgan), and new ensemble additions including Craig Robinson (he plays Darryl on The Office ) as a married pal pining to see some new breasts and thus willing to underwrite the porno production costs if he can be in on the casting sessions. (Robinson's character is dedicated to the proposition that the word titties  is endlessly hilarious. Endlessly.) Oh, and it's worth mentioning the cameo skit at the 10th reunion between two recognizable, handsome male actors whose names you may read elsewhere, but not in this spoiler-free zone: The big guffaw is that one of the pop cuties plays a gay porn star and the other plays his boyfriend, who was once a crush of Miri's. The whole joke is so very...one decade out of date.  C–

 Defying a trend toward baffling abstraction in movie titles — “Synecdoche, New York”? “Quantum of Solace”? “The Secret Life of Bees”? — Kevin Smith has given his new opus a name that tells you exactly what it’s about. Literal-mindedness has always been among Mr. Smith’s calling cards. His first film, about clerks, was called “Clerks.” And so it will hardly be shocking that “Zack and Miri Make a Porno” is about two people, named Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks), who make what my copy editors would prefer that I call a pornographic movie.  And really, in spite of an avalanche of verbal filth (and a smaller quantum of the visual variety), “Zack and Miri” is not very shocking at all. Mr. Smith has been tinkering with the dirty-mind/soft-heart combination for quite some time, forming a link of sorts between the humanist sexual anarchy of John Waters and the smutty Victorianism of Judd Apatow. He and his characters revel in dialogue that riffs on body parts and bodily fluids, but Mr. Smith’s stories are bathed — metaphorically! — in syrup and schmaltz.  So “Zack and Miri Make a Porno,” in spite of its sometimes tiresome, sometimes amusing lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel. Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that  ...  they have always been in love with each other. Granted, this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera, but it is so sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter.  Mr. Smith tries, with mixed results, both to rub our faces in the tawdriness and to erase it altogether. The movie wants to insist that pornography is a jolly, innocuous pursuit, but also to take refuge in a sincere, romantic traditionalism that is antithetical to the  cynical, often playful sexual ethos of pornography. Mr. Smith is intent on making a love story, which is almost by definition the opposite of the kind of movie Zack and Miri set out to produce.  They are roommates, living in a run-down Pittsburgh apartment and in that treacherous stretch between the end of adolescence and the onset of maturity. Approaching their 10th high school reunion, Zack and Miri are broke, miserable and alienated. This has always been Mr. Smith’s comfort zone. He is a poet of failure, and Mr. Rogen is unmatched at playing reasonably nice, reasonably smart guys with minimal ambitions that they may nonetheless fail to realize.  Zack works in a Starbucks-like coffee shop alongside Delaney, a harried husband played by Craig Robinson (“The Office,” a show-stopping monologue in “Knocked Up”), who is fast becoming the most dependable comic counterpuncher in the business and who needs some bigger roles or a sitcom of his own right away. When Zack and Miri hatch their plan to climb out of debt by making a skin flick, Delaney becomes their producer.  A cast and crew materializes, including the real-life former porn star Traci Lords and  the  Kevin Smith stalwarts  Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson, who signs on as director of photography.  The best moments come early, before “Zack and Miri Make a Porno” decides to wear its heart on its sleeve and keep everything else in its pants. Justin Long and Brandon Routh —  Superman! — do some droll camping at the reunion, and Mr. Mewes uses his deadpan immunity to embarrassment to good effect.  Like Rosario Dawson in “Clerks 2,” Ms. Banks (who plays Laura Bush in Oliver Stone’s “W.”) is forced to be funny on a pedestal. She has to be the nice girl with the naughty mouth, just uninhibited enough to play along with Zack’s schemes but not so daring as to tarnish his idealized image of her.  The gauzy sweetness that envelops  the end of the movie is not unwelcome, but not very convincing either. The “porno” remains unfinished, and so does “Zack and Miri,” having — like most pornography, interestingly enough — thrown away an imaginative premise to get down to predictable, mechanical business. It’s as if Mr. Smith were a plumber who knocked at your door and then, against all reasonable expectations, insisted on fixing the sink.  “Zack and Miri Make a Porno” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some nudity and sexual situations, but mostly just talk.

The bluntly titled �Zack and Miri Make a Porno� is a cheerfully vulgar love story or a sweet-hearted sex farce, however you want to look at it. Very much of a piece with Kevin Smith�s previous down-and-dirty working-stiff comedies, the raucous humor here also neatly dovetails with the pants-down funny stuff recently popularized by Judd Apatow. That, and the presence of Seth Rogen doing what he does best, bodes well for this MGM/Weinstein offering, which looks to pocket some nice change in fall release and prove a very popular home-viewing title down the line.
If there were any doubt that anyone can make a movie now, �Zack and Miri� dispels it, as the lead characters do it -- and the nasty -- for the sole purpose of making money. Friends since first grade, Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have long lived together in a low-end Pittsburgh house but have never been an item, as that would somehow seem weird. 
Smith opens the floodgates for the sex and potty humor at the outset. There�s scarcely a line of dialogue that doesn�t feature the F-word, A-word, one of the C- or P-words or some variant of them, and it isn�t long until you have to either decide that it�s all intolerably stupid or, more likely, succumb to the downright silliness of it and enjoy the overdose. It would be too much to say that what Smith has come up with here is inspired, but it is pretty funny and very energetic.
An unlikely night-before-Thanksgiving high school reunion sees Zack push for a bathroom quickie with a married former classmate, while Miri embarrasses herself by propositioning the handsomest guy in the room, Bobby Long (Brandon �Superman� Routh), before discovering he�s not only gay but also a big porn star, who�s in from L.A. with his b.f. (an amusing Justin Long).
Inadvertent celebrities when both their asses turn up on You Tube thanks to an opportunistic kid with a videophone, Zack and Miri, their rent overdue and the water and power cut off, have got to find a quick fix for their financial quandary. The title explains their solution, but the big discussion centers on whether or not they can bring themselves to do the deed on camera. Of course they can.
Still, Zack plans the scenario so Miri won�t be having sex with anyone else in the film, which initially takes shape as a sci-fi takeoff called �Star Whores� (wait, didn�t Mel Brooks long ago do �Spaceballs�?). Zack assembles a motley crew, consisting of �producer� and casting director Delaney (Craig Robinson), his longtime fellow coffee-shop workmate, who�s comically oversensitive to any perceived insult to his blackness; Lester (Jason Mewes), a young man who can be ready for action at the snap of the fingers; Bubbles (porn legend Traci Lords), who lives up to her name in more ways than one; Barry (Ricky Mabe), a pliable young fellow; Deacon (Jeff Anderson), who qualifies as d.p. by having photographed high school football, and Stacey (�Porn 101� star Katie Morgan), who will do specialty acts.
As lensing gets under way despite an initial setback, Zack can�t believe how much fun filmmaking is, and Miri tells him he actually seems ambitious for the first time in his life. When the time comes for their big scene, for which they never rehearsed at home, it goes differently than either of them would have expected, leading both to assess their relationship in a new way.
What the scene really is, however, is yet another fantasy, now explicit and familiar due to the Apatow stable�s output, of a chubby, geeky guy getting it on with a gorgeous young woman and her digging it. Naturally, chubby, geeky guys will dig the sight of it. Resolution shows there�s both a closet romantic and a good little Catholic boy still deep inside Smith somewhere.
Chemistry between Rogen and Banks is excellent; he bangs out the crude talk with well-practiced, nonchalant expertise, and she�s totally game, throwing it right back at him. Robinson�s deadpan outrage and acceptance of insanity see him neatly underplaying everyone else, and everyone else pitches in to create a nutty group portrait of try-anything common folk.
Dead-of-winter Pittsburgh locations create a sense of ever-present adversity that�s funny in itself; pacing is ultra-snappy, production values what they need to be. A post-fade-out faux promotional video is worth sticking around for.
 


Ostensibly, Zack and Miri Make a Porno  should be money-shot Kevin Smith : Pals make a porn to pay the bills and, in the process of gettin' it on for the video cam, cum to realize their years-in-the-making friendship is really a love affair. Awwwww , how sweet. In other words, it's quintessential Silent Bob, as hard-up meets hard-on in a movie that's all heart once you get past the shit shot that'll shock only those for whom Clerks II 's donkey show wasn't oh-God-no  enough.
There's a Star Wars  dress-up sequence, too, apropos for the guy who got Mark Hamill  to appear as a character called CockKnocker in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back , the same film in which Carrie Fisher  played a rather rode-hard nun. Only, the Lucasfilm  homage is tossed after a few fleeting but promising moments; from there, it's straight-up sex in a coffee shop after work hours, where Zack (Seth Rogen ) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks ) enlist some new fuck-buddies to shoot their amateur smut opus, Swallow My Cockuccino .
The View Askew aficionados will lap this up; Zack and Miri  is undiluted Dork Knight, down to the casting of Superman Brandon Routh  as the gay lover of a dude-on-dude porn star played by Justin Long , vamping and camping it up after his stint as straight man in Live Free or Die Hard  (already perilously close to a porn title). Having gone soft with Jersey Girl  (which is looking better all the time) only to regroup by remaking Clerks  solely for the diehards, Smith here rounds up Judd Apatow 's familiars (Rogen, Banks, Craig Robinson , The 40-Year-Old Virgin 's Gerry Bednob ), pairs them with his own regulars (Jason Mewes , Jeff Anderson ) plus Traci Lords , and puts "Porno" in the title. Still, there is something decidedly novel (nay, revolutionary!) about this particular Kevin Smith film: It looks professionally made, which counts for something. No longer does a Smith movie play like a vacation slideshow; the camera moves! He's rude, sure, but no longer rudimentary. (He's also no longer in Jersey, setting Zack and Miri in the frozen tundra of Pittsburgh .)
The storyline's as conventional as they come. Zack and Miri are childhood friends and roommates who between them can still barely scrape together rent money, even though both have jobs and don't exactly live on the brighter side of squalid. Theirs is a perfectly platonic relationship, more brother and sister than BFFs. Alas, three events conspire to drive them into the adult-entertainment business: a chance meeting with Long and Routh at their high school reunion, some rather benign YouTubed footage of Miri's "granny panties," and their electricity getting cut off during the holiday season. What to do? Voila , porn! Why doesn't everyone think of that?
Robinson, as Zack's coffee-shop co-worker and the only guy he knows with dough, fronts him the necessary coin; the Office  vet, playing a henpecked husband, is terrific as the "producer" for whom the auditioning process alone merits the investment. Mewes too is amusing as the dim-witted hunk just looking to bang somebody—at the very least, Smith has given his old buddy Jay a role for which he's required to do more than roll it up and smoke it. Truth is, Banks and Rogen are forced to grapple with the least interesting characters in the whole movie—slackers in love who, when they finally get around to their one porn scene together, go all soft-focus in a movie desperately in need of something a little, um, harder.
From its few scatological asides to its inevitable boob shots, nothing about Zack and Miri  feels terribly fresh, much less transgressive. We've seen Banks and Rogen play-acting porn already, at the end of The 40-Year-Old Virgin —she in the hot tub, a shower nozzle strategically placed just below the bubbly surface; he off to the side, stripping down for a dip into the warm jets. As for the just-plain-folks angle, last year saw Jeff Bridges , Ted Danson , and their own small-stars shrugging their way through The Amateurs —and Blue Movie  it wasn't, however slight an homage it was to Terry Southern 's literary wet dream in which famous faces are buried in regions nether and yon.
Amiable and engaging in person and a filmmaker for whom comic and movie nerds so desperately want to root, Smith makes two kinds of movies: romantic comedies and bromantic comedies, with Chasing Amy —his one legitimately great movie—the crossover hybrid hit. They're all decidedly conventional affairs, save for the detours into gross-out juvenilia that, the older Smith gets, seem less sincere and feel more like pandering to the audience that goes to his movies solely to walk out with a couple of lines they can quote to each other on the ride home. But the biggest titters at a recent preview screening came during a scene in which Mewes shows off his dick—as though, at last! Still, how Jason Segal  of him. Does Apatow always get there first?
