Maybe it's a measure of how far the collegiate/coming-of-age film genre has fallen, or possibly it�s just the alcohol-fuled detritus of "generation kill," but I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell
 makes John Landis' seminal Animal House
 look like Kubrick, Welles, and the Marx Brothers combined. Hell
 is a cynical, borderline nihilistic glimpse into the minds of modern might-be men, and it's a grim picture of masculinity gone sick and wrong. Gosse's adaptation of twentysomething miscreant Tucker Max's bestselling chronicle of his debauched, sozzled, and epically uncool life story thus far (a follow-up is forthcoming) is, like its willfully antagonistic protagonist, something of a train wreck. A movie full of deviant behavior and random, testosterone-fueled, sex-mad chaos is no great sin in terms of Seventies-era National Lampoon
 filmmaking, of course. But John Belushi's career-defining turn as the boorish John "Bluto" Blutarsky, Delta House's resident monster from the id � paired with Bruce McGill's Corman-esque wild angel D-Day � resonated not only as comedically iconic fraternity archetypes but also as genuine American rebels with causes and motivations beyond the pursuit of kegs, legs, and dregs. Animal House
 was subversive in all the right ways: anti-war, anti-authority, and anti-Ivy League conformism. Maybe it's unfair to compare Hell
 to House
, but the fact is that Tucker Max (here played by Friday Night Lights
' Czuchry) would have been a more likely member of Animal
's uptight Omega House. He abuses his friends and swills the bad life with reckless abandon, but he's also a suit-and-tie guy waiting to happen. His 11th-hour epiphany (you can't be a total jerkwad forever, apparently) is as lame as a near-beer drinking binge. To its credit, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell
's saving grace is a hilariously bitter performance by Bradford (The West Wing
) as Tucker's gamer/geek buddy Drew, fresh out of a hellish breakup and loaded with smart, witty bile. Bradford is the temporarily misaligned moral compass in a film sorely in need of less generic misogyny and more caustic, raw brotherhood. It's not a total wipeout: Czuchry embodies the Tucker Max(-ims) to a self-obsessed fault, and there are moments of rough comic brilliance scattered throughout, but really, this particular antihero is all anti- and zero hero.

For what appears to be a remake of “The Hangover’’ made by drunk, entitled frat boys using their parents’ credit cards, “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell’’ is slightly better than it should be. For Tucker Max, this possibly represents a triumph.
You haven’t heard of Tucker Max? Not for lack of trying. A 33-year-old guy with a law degree from Duke, he has won fame and fortune telling foul-minded tall tales of his sex life and drinking binges on his website and in the pages of a best-selling book. The more sordid and politically incorrect Max gets, the more he’s adored by his following: college guys who think body fluids equal truth and women who like bad boys at the expense of their self-respect.
Who hates Max? A lot of people: most women, a lot of men, op-ed columnists, and the Chicago Transit Authority, which last week removed crass bus shelter posters promoting “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,’’ thereby giving the movie more publicity than ever. Max protested but unconvincingly; he knows stunts like this only solidify his rebel credentials to an audience that doesn’t want to think too much.
Anyway, how’s the movie? Ridiculously cheap-looking, smug, scurrilous, but fairly evolved for a project so fundamentally unevolved. Actor Matt Czuchry plays Max with a sleepy Cheshire cat grin, wandering from one boozy conquest to the next and trying to score a personal trifecta by sleeping with a deaf woman, a blind woman, and a mute. (The first takes up the film’s opening scene; it’s the perfect aisle-clearer for anyone in the audience with actual taste.)
Max stands for unrepentant groin-centric hedonism; his best friend Dan (Geoff Stults) is the upstanding groom-to-be, although unlike most grooms in most bachelor party comedies, he’s allowed to have a personality. The third point of the triangle is Drew (Jesse Bradford), recently dumped by his fiancee and venting his anger in bitter, hyperarticulate rants against all women. Drew’s the litmus test: Unless you can laugh at an intentionally outrageous line like “Not all women are sluts, just most of them,’’ you should stay at home; it’s not worth rising to Max’s bait. Still, this man wonders why he’s accused of hating women?
The threadbare plot follows the three friends out of town to a legendary strip club  - legendary to Tucker, anyway  - and complications ensue. As road comedies go, it’s nothing you haven’t seen before and a lot you have: This movie joins “The Hangover’’ and “The Wrestler’’ in suggesting that a modern guy’s best chance for true love is with a single-mom stripper. The Freudians should have a field day.
What “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell’’ isn’t, surprisingly, is stupid. Misogynistic, infantile, smug  - but not stupid. Max’s dialogue is acrid and smutty, but there’s a mind back there, one that mistakes trash-talk for subversive honesty (when it’s actually the opposite of subversive) but that also sees the limitations in being Tucker Max. In one bar scene, the hero faces off against a crew of women, putting down the humorless one (who’s not a babe, of course) but getting shut down by the others when he goes too far. Later, Max even has to face up to the shallowness of his ways and apologize to his friends.
In other words, Tucker Max  - the real one, not the onscreen version  - turns out to be a closet moralist, if only because he knows that’s the only way he’ll be able to sell himself to the mainstream. He’d better hurry up, though. A 33-year-old man stuck in college is not a pretty sight, and Max’s 15 minutes are just about over.

Imagine a booze-and-sex-and-snark bad-boy comedy, like The Hangover  or Road Trip , in which male debauchery gets pushed so far that it's at once hilarious, shocking, and brazenly honest. That's this adaptation of Tucker Max's gonzo memoir, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell . Matt Czuchry, in a star performance, plays Tucker like a Ferris Bueller who bloomed into a charming sociopath. Insults fly out of his mouth like shrapnel, but on a bachelor-party jaunt to a strip club, both his pals (Geoff Stults and Jesse Bradford) and the strippers give as good as they get. The film is consistently fun, and Tucker's comeuppance will leave you gasping (if not gagging) with laughter.

 Correction Appended  For binge-drinking frat-boy types and the women who love them “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,” Tucker Max’s best-selling comic journal of his true adventures boozing, vomiting and fornicating, is a gleeful primer on the New Coarseness. Its far less pungent film adaptation is something else: a mediocre gross-out movie that barely pushes the envelope.  An early scene follows the author (Matt Czuchry) and his buddies Drew (Jesse Bradford) and Dan (Geoff Stults) into a bar where Tucker, the threesome’s leader and provocateur, initiates flirtatious verbal warfare. After he rudely assesses the physical attributes of the women within earshot, insults and epithets begin to fly. Except for one plain goody-two-shoes,  who is offended by Tucker’s fondness for sexist trash talk, the women fight back.  But the New Coarseness is really just the Old Coarseness with steroids and breast implants. The etiquette that prevails in the kind of pick-up joints and strip clubs that are Mr. Max’s hunting grounds of choice has always been crude. The language may have gotten rougher, but inside the clubhouse words that would offend beyond its walls are the accepted weapons of choice; they may sting, but they don’t wound. Skillfully wielded, they even turn into mating calls.  If the uproarious behavior chronicled in “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell” has been compared to Hunter S. Thompson’s antics in “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” Mr. Max’s book is no gonzo classic. What marginally holds your attention is the narrator’s swaggering attitude, not his language. The shoehorning of his anecdotes into comic situations in the movie blurs their edges. Now and then the book suggests an ’80s monologue by Eric Bogosian, but lacking the social insight and political consciousness. Still, “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell” would have had more vitality as a filmed stand-up routine augmented with skits than a conventional comedy.  Directed by Bob Gosse from a screenplay by Mr. Max and Nils Parker, it is no better than a dozen other Hollywood guy movies like “The Hangover.” Mr. Czuchry is also less of a jock than the author, judging by Mr. Max’s YouTube appearances. A tarnished towheaded angel with a maniacal grin, Mr. Czuchry comes across as a potty-mouthed little boy.  The most developed character, the misanthropic Drew, has a heart of gold beneath a sour, suspicious attitude acquired after his traumatic discovery of a girlfriend giving oral sex to a rapper. In the scenes following his hook-up (after an extended verbal skirmish) with Lara (Marika Dominczyk), a stripper and single mother of an adorable tot, the movie turns as squishy sweet as a Disney Christmas film.  The screenplay consists largely of bits and pieces of Mr. Max’s book, many borrowed from the Austin Road Trip section, slapped onto the chronicle of Dan’s disastrous bachelor party, arranged by Tucker, in a strip club. While a badly battered Dan lands in jail, his marital future in question, Tucker finds himself dashing naked through a hotel lobby with a case of explosive diarrhea from a can of beer laced with a laxative by a vengeful woman. Need I say more?  “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scatological jokes, sexual situations and strong language.

Based on Tucker Max's bestseller and scripted and produced by Max and Nils Parker, low-budget indie "I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell" distinguishes itself from such last-fling-before-the-wedding comedies as "The Hangover" with the grittiness of its Texas-set locales and the smug intelligence of its unapologetically narcissistic protagonist. As portrayed by Matt Czuchry, this self-proclaimed a-hole is even adorably cute. But for helmer Bob Gosse ("Niagara, Niagara"), Tucker Max is above all a celebrity in need of an audience. Pic, which opens Sept. 25 in platform release, looks unlikely to attract date-night crowds but could score with young male target auds. 
After an opening law-school scene designed to showcase Tucker's verbal virtuosity, as well as his compulsion to shock, the pic shifts into buddy-movie mode as Tucker (Czuchry) tricks straight-arrow pal Dan (Geoff Stults) into a bachelor binge at a particularly sleazy strip joint 250 miles away, hauling along woman-betrayed recluse Drew (Jesse Bradford) for some "hair of the dog" therapy.
In an ensuing bar-crawling sequence, the boys toss down shots and do the dozens with a band of pre-wedding bachelorettes, neither side particularly witty in its gender-bashing (with Drew's invective more violent than inspired). Then it's off to the main attraction: the hands-on strip joint.
Despite (or maybe because of) Tucker's nonstop sexual political incorrectness, the pic's femmes tend to shine. Left-behind fiancee Kristy (Keri Lynn Pratt) displays a wicked sense of humor, while the videogame-playing stripper mom (Marika Dominczyk) who snares Drew's heart positively twinkles with mischief. Even the deaf girl whose sexual wails bring the cops bursting through the door -- in the pic's hand-held, "Cops"-style prologue -- upbraids the intruders with speech-impaired brio.
Tucker receives his comeuppance in the form of a powerful laxative introduced in his beer, the proverbial substance hitting the fan -- or in this case, the lens, in one of the cinema's most extended fecal sequences. (Gosse gets maximum mileage out of long shots of Tucker skittering around a hotel lobby's vast, white marble floor, leaving a brown trail behind him.)
Tucker's Ferris Bueller-like genius comes in his ability to repurpose this humiliation as a wedding-crashing, Baptist-shocking standup act to get back into his friends' good graces and feign remorse. Tucker's true epiphany arrives with his dismal attempts to navigate the bar scene solo; apparently, his success depends on an audience of buddies.

Tucker Max  got famous through a website detailing how being an asshole to women constantly got him laid, making him a hero to frat boys and a demon to everyone else who noticed. I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell , adapted from his magnum opus/blog, is pretty damn odious, mostly because it wusses out. Hell  seeks to deflect pre-emptive attacks on Max's misogyny by basically ignoring him for the first half. Though he's there as the party instigator (and played by Matt Czuchry , who redeems the character's written smugness not one bit), the focus is on nerdy pal Drew (Jesse Bradford ). After a bitter break-up with a cheating ex, Drew is prone to randomly threatening to carve a "fuck-hole" into any and all women who approach him until he meets a stripper (Marika Dominczyk ) who can beat him at Halo. In the second half, Max recognizes his sins (against his friends, not women) and redeems himself by hijacking another buddy's wedding for a long, rambling confessional. Hell —Bob Gosse 's first film in 11 years, since Niagara , Niagara —is visually incompetent to a painful extreme and almost never funny, but, worst of all, it doesn't have the courage of Max's unadulterated convictions. If you're going to offend the easily offended, at least go big.
