The controversial film director Boll has delivered another in his dubious string of video-game-to-movie adaptations (see House of the Dead
 and Alone in the Dark
 for further reference if you must). Boll has earned his reputation as a modern-day Ed Wood with his inept but driven filmmaking, although the comparisons end there as Boll�s abilities as a producer and fundraiser far exceed the quality of his finished product. The reigning theory regarding this has to do with the German tax system, which reportedly allows full deductions for film investment losses � making Uwe Boll films blue-chip investments. Mismatched shots, incoherent action, bargain-basement sets and costumes, unfocused performances: All are consistent hallmarks of this German auteur. BloodRayne
, the story of the titular half-human/half-vampire woman who�s bent on revenge against the vampire king who defiled her mother, is no different. However, BloodRayne
 does stand out for its collection of acting "names" who appear in this historical fantasy (most startlingly, Ben Kingsley), and a script by Guinevere Turner (the actress/writer who�s more commonly associated with the films Go Fish
, American Psycho
, the upcoming Notorious Bettie Page
, and the TV show The L Word
, than with video-game makeovers). Amazingly, I saw BloodRayne
 at its world premiere this fall at the Austin Film Festival � the one that focuses on honoring screenwriters. Turner was nowhere in sight, although Boll and his frequently cast actor Sanderson were. As the vengeance-driven Rayne, Loken has the look of a warrior princess down cold, although her acting prowess lacks � shall we say, direction? After breaking away from the circus she  falls in with the Brimstone Society (Madsen, Rodriguez, and Davis are the leaders), who are determined to kill the vampire king Kagan (Kingsley). Showing up for odd cameos along the way are Chaplin, Zane, and Meat Loaf. Maybe everyone involved was hoping that no one would see this movie, but Madsen is the only one who should fear
 anyone seeing his work. The Tarantino regular here appears bloated, hungover, and barely there. Not to start false rumors, but his handlers ought to check whether Madsen was even "of sound mind" when he signed on the dotted line. Never has an actor looked this dissipated on film. I�m not sure what Boll sees when he looks through the director�s lens while filming each of his pictures, but I�m certain it�s something different than what the rest of us see. BloodRayne
 poses no threat to his reputation.

         The only thing left unsliced is the ham in "BloodRayne," yet another video game adaptation by German genre specialist Uwe Boll and a movie with more fading — or faded — talent than an Italian basketball team. Star Kristanna Loken does a lot for a leather bustier but very little for the Rayne of the title, a dhampir — half vampire, half human — who thirsts for the blood of the undead. A sip here, a slurp there. The next thing you know, you're a Veg-O-Matic with hips.
 
  Judging by the movies, 18th century Romania must have had more ghouls running around than Washington has lobbyists, and they're coming out of the wormy woodwork in "BloodRayne." Ben Kingsley — looking frighteningly like Geraldine Fitzgerald in "Arthur" — is Kagan, king of the vamps, and his daughter, as it turns out, is Rayne. Michael Madsen, apparently having decided he was doing way too much legitimate work in "Kill Bill Vol. 2," is Vladimir, a debauched buccaneer who leads something called Brimstone, a society that specializes in hunting down the undead, dispatching them via various impalings, decapitations and a little pyromania. There isn't much more of a story. In fact, there isn't any story. Luckily, Loken is there to provide something to stare at, vacantly.
 


         






    There is a story, perhaps, in Romar Entertainment, the indie outfit distributing "BloodRayne" to about 2,000 theaters. Somehow, Romar pulled together this considerable cast and crew, the most unlikely member of whom is Guinevere Turner, who wrote the script, such as it is. Turner, who has penned screenplays for "American Psycho," cable's "The L Word" and the indie hit "Go Fish," contributes such lines to "BloodRayne" as "If they want a fight, a fight they will get," and "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer." Apparently, back in vampire-ridden 18th century Romania, they could quote Michael Corleone.

Gamers, girl watchers and gore hounds are the target auds for "BloodRayne," yet another vidgame filmization by the frightfully prolific Uwe Boll ("House of the Dead," "Alone in the Dark"). But it's doubtful that even the least discriminating genre fans will storm into megaplexes before this anemic action-fantasy fast-forwards to homevid. Don't expect it to stick around very long after Jan. 6 opening on 985 screens.
Loosely based on the popular Majesco vidgames about a half-human/half-vampire heroine who slices and dices Nazis during World War II, "BloodRayne" bears only a slight resemblance to its source material. Scripter Guinevere Turner (whose previous credits include the far more rarified "American Psycho" and "The Notorious Bettie Page") has cobbled together a formulaic scenario set in a vaguely defined faux-medieval realm where swords, sorcery and sexy bloodsuckers abound.
Rayne (Kristanna Loken of "Terminator 3") is a "dhampir" -- the offspring of a vampire and a human -- with serious father issues. When she was a little girl, her mom was brutally murdered by her not-so-loving dad: Kagan (Ben Kingsley -- yes, that 
Ben Kingsley), a vampire overlord with a taste for comely wenches.
Little Rayne grew up to be the star attraction in a circus freak show, amazing audiences with her recuperative powers. Repeatedly cut and burnt by her handlers, she recovers immediately after guzzling animal blood. But when she accidentally get a taste of human plasma, she's shocked back into an awareness of her tainted bloodline and, more importantly, her thirst for vengeance.
She joins forces with three vampire hunters (Michael Madsen, Matt Davis, Michelle Rodriguez), members of the Brimstone Society, an organization dedicated to slaying creatures like Kagan.
Shot on location in Romania, "BloodRayne" has the unmistakably tatty look of a low-budget international co-production where pennies were pinched and corners were cut. The costumes suggest what "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy might have looked like if its actors had been outfitted at thrift shops.
Pic lurches from incident to incident at a graceless plodding place, offering little in the way of genuine excitement -- the swordfights often are confusingly cut and choreographed -- and only minimal amounts of guilty-pleasure titillation. Loken and Davis perform a spirited pas de deux against a cell door, and Meat Loaf Aday briefly appears as a mack-daddy vampire who surrounds himself with bare-bosomed bloodsuckers.
For the most part, however, R-rated pic emphasizes bloody carnage more than sexy shenanigans. (Whenever a vampire bites someone here, it sounds like someone munching on a crisp apple.)
Most of the performances are surprisingly bland. Even Kingsley, cast in the sort of role that usually tempts great actors to hammy excess, merely goes through the motions. The only live wire is Billy Zane, who purrs one-liners with plummy aplomb as an ex-Brimstoner turned vampire. His character inexplicably disappears at the three-quarter mark, however, which is one of several indications that pic likely underwent last-minute re-cutting.
Another suspicious sign: An oddly anticlimactic finale that seems abruptly truncated. The door is left open for a sequel, of course, but auds may take that as a threat, not a promise.

Riddle me this, Anne Rice : When has a vampire ever been held in captivity, let alone by a circus troupe? It's actually a trick question. Our blood-smacking antiheroine, Rayne (Kristanna Loken ), isn't a vampire; she's a dhampir, a half-human, half-vampire cross-fiend who's as anguished, strange, and sloppy as mercenaries, or movies, get. She's the daughter, after all, of Ben Kingsley , who plays, in BloodRayne 's most plausible turn, the most powerful vampire in the world. After Rayne breaks out of the circus, it's a simple story, really, about a mixed-up girl who wants to slay her father. Can she do it, without turning evil? This mock prequel to Queen of the Damned , based on a video game of the same name, leaves the last part wide open. It's never clear whether Rayne kills her victims because she's hungry, because they're vampires, or because she actually wants to make out with them.
