It took brass hubcaps to make Bonneville , a midlife-chick-road-trip movie starring a '66 Pontiac convertible and a trio of middle-aged driving girlfriends in cool sunglasses, and not once have the gals give props to Thelma & Louise . Surely the ladies saw that flick back in 1991, even in Pocatello, Idaho, where the road begins? Maybe not: This idling feature by first-timers Christopher N. Rowley (he directed) and Daniel D. Davis (he wrote) stalls in a generic crossroads of AARP life issues, including widowhood and the pursuit of postmenopausal sex. And that's despite the best efforts of Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Joan Allen to rally the More -reading troops to whom the movie is exclusively pitched. Lange plays a fresh widow (with a touch of the bohemian about her) delivering her husband's ashes to her angry adult stepdaughter (Christine Baranski?! On what planet?) in Santa Barbara; widowed Bates does the earthy jokes; Allen is saddled with the character of a prim Mormon wife who blossoms with the help of a Las Vegas slot machine.
Ladies! Thelma and Louise drove a '66T-bird, remember?! They picked up a young male hitchhiker 17 years before you did, and they too, um, interacted with a trucker and admired magnificent American sunsets  is it coming back to you? Nope, it's not, which is exactly why the tires are so low on this creaky vehicle.


 The synopsis of “Bonneville” makes it sound like “Thelma and Louise” in first gear: A recent widow named Arvilla Holden (Jessica Lange) and her two best friends, Carol and Margene (Joan Allen and Kathy Bates), hit the road in Idaho in a 1966 Pontiac convertible to deliver an urn full of ashes to a funeral in Santa Barbara, Calif., bickering, bonding and facing hard truths along the way.  The 50-something leads and meandering pace distinguish “Bonneville” from other movies of its type. But the film’s most striking characteristic comes to the fore when the women pick up a hunky young hitchhiker named Bo (Victor Rasuk).  Not only is there no furtive hookup, we sense that none of the travelers would seriously consider having one. When the women sit in a diner watching the shirtless hitchhiker wash their car in the parking lot, they’re just window-shopping. We learn the source of their restraint when Bo and the ladies part ways, and Carol offers him a parting gift: her copy of the Book of Mormon.  As it happens, Carol, Margene, Arvilla and many other major characters are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The film’s screenwriter, Daniel D. Davis, and its director, Christopher N. Rowley, treat their characters’ faith as a given — as merely one characteristic among many. It’s the Mormon flip side of a typical Hollywood movie set in a world in which no one ever mentions God, prays or enters a house of worship. The movie’s no-fuss treatment of religion is as deft as it is unexpected.  Good thing too, because the film has many tiresome elements — starting with Arvilla’s brittle antagonist, Francine (Christine Baranski), her dead husband Joe’s daughter by his first wife. Because Joe never amended his will, Francine, who always disliked her stepmother, is set to inherit the couple’s longtime home. She gives Arvilla an ultimatum: Deliver Joe’s ashes to Santa Barbara for burial next to his first wife, or pack and get out. Despite Ms. Baranski’s sharp performance and a few last-minute nuances, Francine remains a resentful killjoy.  Except for Ms. Lange’s silent, expressive close-ups, which render flashbacks unnecessary, the women’s journey is aesthetically and dramatically unremarkable. The three pass through spectacular terrain, cross paths with a charming trucker named Emmett (the silver fox Tom Skerritt) who joins them for dinner in Las Vegas, and visit a casino floor, where Carol obliviously chats with a young female slot-machine player waiting on a client who pays by the hour.  Yet the film’s worldview lends charm, even excitement, to moments that would seem dull or awkward in a Hollywood road movie. When Margene says she and Emmett went dancing, Ms. Bates’s incredulous, delighted tone makes the act sound as reckless as a one-night stand. When Carol offers Bo her Book of Mormon, he politely declines because it’s clearly a keepsake, and because he already has two.  “Bonneville” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for  mild language and innuendo.

Much has been written about the underserved demographic of middle-aged moviegoers starved for films that reflect life experience in their advancing years. They deserve better than "Bonneville," a bland road movie running on empty. It's depressing to see a deluxe cast wasted on such by-the-numbers material -- from predictable plot to fabricated Hallmark sentiment to strenuous milking of warm-and-fuzzy laughs from the irrepressible spirit of three women whose youth is behind them. Rarely rising above pedestrian efficiency, Christopher N. Rowley's debut feature looks to get the most mileage out of cable dates.
Crisp widescreen lensing (courtesy of d.p. Jeffrey L. Kimball) of magnificent American West landscapes and its Oscar-bait cast give the project an air of dignity. But the casting to type of three high-caliber actresses, all of whom have amply proven their ability in the past to create vividly etched characters, only underlines the absence of original ideas.
It's as if writer Daniel D. Davis had fed into a script program the screen personas of Jessica Lange (proud self-possession tinged with fragility), Kathy Bates (down-to-earth, raunchy good humor) and Joan Allen (uptight propriety), adding thematic ingredients of grief, strength, friendship, bittersweet experience and endurance to his data input.
Her features frozen into an expression suspended between laughter and tears, Lange plays recently widowed Arvilla. When her brittle stepdaughter (Christine Baranski) threatens to sell her house out from under her, Arvilla is forced to transport her husband Joe's ashes from their Idaho home to Santa Barbara to be laid to rest alongside his first wife. Her fellow Mormon gal-pals Margene (Bates) and Carol (Allen) go along to lend support.
Setting off in Joe's lovingly maintained 1966 Bonneville convertible, Arvilla on impulse decides to miss their scheduled Salt Lake City flight and drive to California instead. Conflicted over Joe's wish to have his ashes scattered in places they visited together, she goes on a pilgrimage across the plains, literally letting a little of her husband go at each stop while embracing her memories of him and summoning the strength to continue.
Lange wades with poise through some awkward solo scenes, cooing romantically to the urn containing Joe's remains. But her character's grief, and emergence from it, are never as affecting as they should be, perhaps because the script assumes rather than earns the expected emotional responses.
Her friends also undergo changes during the journey. Joined at the hip to her husband and her church, prim Carol lets down her hair and discovers her independence while, in between dispensing wisecracks, Margene finds romance with a gentleman trucker (Tom Skerritt) and reveals her own cause for sadness. There's also an interlude with a soulful young hitchhiker (Victor Rasuk) searching for the father he never knew, that adds a note of tenderness.
No doubt some audiences will respond warmly to the film's affirmation of female friendship, solidarity and resilience, not to mention its wholesome values. And while none of the perfs contains any surprises, the class of its pedigree leads goes some distance toward fostering emotional investment in their characters. But there's a big difference between a filmmaker who can actually convey with real feeling the pain of loss or the courage required to carry on, and one who merely connects the dots to illustrate it.


Three middle-aged Mormon ladies from Idaho  tie scarves around their heads, don sunglasses, and fly across the American landscape in a convertible like they're Thelma and Louise , yet this rarity in cinema—a graying cast in a female-bonding adventure—couldn't be more dull-humored or predictably maudlin without just calling itself The Bucket List 2 . Arvilla (Jessica Lange ) wants to honor her late husband's wishes of spreading his cremated ashes, but her bitchy stepdaughter (Christine Baranski ) will steal her house away if she doesn't send what's left of "Daddy" to Santa Barbara . Road trip! Accompanied by sassmouth Margene (Kathy Bates ) and prissy pragmatist Carol (Joan Allen )—the latter a plant for the Latter-Day Saints : "Oh my heck, I think I just drank vodka," or "Coffee? What kind of a Mormon are you?"—Arvilla sets out on a journey of enlightenment in which all three women will learn a little something about themselves, and how best to make us roll our eyes. First-time director Christopher N. Rowley  and writer Daniel D. Davis  have created a safe fantasy world where all truckers are gentlemen, as are the hitchhikers, and women stereotypically break anything they try to drive.
