It�s not perfect, but this big-screen debut of H.A. Rey�s lovable monkey is worth recommending to audiences of all ages, especially fathers and sons. Lovingly rendered by executive producer Ron Howard�s Imagine Entertainment, the production is faithful to George�s gentle spirit while fully exploiting the possibilities of old-school, two-dimensional animation. Movies are magical, it suggests, and everything is beautiful and fascinating to children: the sheen of bubbles, mislaid and open cans of paint, a fistful of helium balloons, the power you have to provoke your parents by messing with something off-limits. Toilet paper can be unrolled all over the floor. You can break into a crate of bananas and stuff your face until you pass out. Everything looks slightly hyper-real, its size slightly exaggerated. But the movie also gets George's melancholy just right. For this is not a movie about a man and his monkey, but a movie about parents and children. Children know that the world is not theirs; they know they�re always breaking the rules by wanting the things in their hearts, and they know that they�re inconvenient and messy and sometimes cause their parents to become jobless and evicted and very, very sad. Parents know that they love their children but will always make mistakes in caring for them. But bumbling as parents are, it is still them alone their children want. The screenplay skims off some of the source material�s hinky bits in sending museum employee Ted (Ferrell) to deepest, darkest Africa in search of a legendary ape idol. Rather than pillaging the continent, Ted is trying to save his beloved institution from the meddling son (Cross) of the crusty old curator (Van Dyke), so that's probably okay, and the movie gives us a sarcastic native guide for the expedition. (Whenever Ted marvels at the African exotica, the guide retorts, �Yeah, I know. I live here.�) Enter playful George, who bedevils Ted with peek-a-boo and hops a steamer home to follow him. (Like most children, George is smarter than his parent but lacks caution.) There�s a sort of romance between Ted and a field-tripping schoolteacher (Barrymore) and a very simple plot about exposing Ted�s artifact as a fraud, but the story's best moments are its offhand ones: the t�te-�-t�te with upstairs neighbor Mrs. Plushbottom (Plowright, who is outstanding), a candy-colored workshop of robot toys, and George�s other little discoveries. Jack Johnson�s original songs are a bit heavy on the heartstrings, but you�d have to be made of granite not to be moved: Even the Daily Texan
 hipsters next to me chuckled along with the movie. There�s some winking humor (�We're already on a ship to Africa!� Ferrell crows. �What a time-saver!�) but George
 isn�t pitched above children�s heads � a tactic that makes for smarmy, inauthentic family animation. (Exhibit A: Chicken Little
.) We have our usual absent-mother problem, and a scene of separation between Ted and George may be too intense for very young kids. But it is a sweet, simple movie with a sweet, simple message: that children see the world differently and have much to teach the people who love them.


A fellow movie reviewer of my acquaintance recently spent some time railing against the habit some of us have of canvassing our own spawn for opinions when reviewing a kids' movie. Sentences like "the little critic sitting next to me thought 'Madagascar' was a brilliant addition to world cinema" drive her nuts, reeking as they do of both exploitation and smarmy parental indulgence.
I feel her pain, but sometimes it's just unavoidable. To wit: Having seen the animated 
"Curious George" in the company of two daughters and a borrowed friend, I feel duty-bound to report that the 5-year-old loved it, the 8-year-old loved it, and even the 10-year-old adjudged as how "the monkey was so cute
." Dad, meanwhile, was climbing the walls.
The celebrated children's books of Margret and H.A. Rey have been brought to the screen in as toothless, trivialized, and disarmingly pleasant a manner possible, which is a small miracle when you consider the damage executive producer Ron Howard wreaked on Dr. Seuss with "How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
The filmmaking team, headed by director Matthew O'Callaghan and production designer Yarrow Cheney, aims for the gentle simplicity of the books. The movie uses old-fashioned hand-drawn animation with lots of bright colors, plus a generous helping of surfer-dude singer Jack Johnson's bouncy pastel lullabies on the soundtrack. It also throws in an actual plot, with actual bad guys, and it makes the mistake of turning the Man With the Yellow Hat into a comic boob instead of a trusted and trusting father figure. The nerve.
I suppose you have to have some
 sort of story line if you're dealing with a running time longer than the "Curious George" cartoons that aired on HBO in the 1980s. Ted (the voice of Will Ferrell) is a doofus staffer at a natural history museum who gets sent to Africa by his elderly boss (Dick Van Dyke) to find the giant prehistoric monkey statue that will save the beleaguered institution from closing. Sent on the wrong trail by the boss's jealous son (David Cross of "Arrested Development"), who wants to tear down the museum and build a parking lot, Ted discovers an alternate, pint-size version of the statue as well as a playful chimp companion (George's coos are voiced by Frank Welker). The latter follows him back to New York for various shenanigans and saving of the day.
Somehow Drew Barrymore figures into this, lending her voice to the role of a winsome schoolteacher, as well as Joan Plowright as a pompous dowager, Eugene Levy as a wacky inventor, and Ed O'Ross as a massive Russian doorman. They're diverting enough, but don't the ads for the movie say "Show me the monkey"? They do indeed, but "Curious George" spends an awful lot of time with the humans, and a little bit of Ferrell goes a long way.
Very young children love the Reys' books for an obvious reason: George is a toddler who's more resourceful than they are, gets into worse trouble, yet is never in any real danger. Put the character in a room with a pot of paints and a light bulb over his head, and kids squeal in delightful expectation of messy payoff. The movie includes that scene and is much the better for it -- the theater I was in lighted up with happiness -- but quickly returns to frenetic kids-movie business as usual. Fans of the books will find George's balloon flight above the city turned into something approaching an action sequence, but I for one missed the piercing, multileveled drama of the character's interaction with the baby bunny in "Curious George Flies a Kite."
The animation is oddly soothing -- the traditional 2-D animation has been inventively lighted and shadowed, so that every scene feels like it's taking place at sunset -- and adult viewers might feel narcotized into submission (the better to accept the product placement for Volkswagen
 and Dole bananas, unconscionable in a movie like this). More likely, they'll be bored stiff while appreciating the undemanding good time their kids are having. Genuine, artful simplicity may be an impossible quality in a modern children's movie, so "Curious George" opts instead for mayhem under a blanket of sweetness. The little ones understand.

         I'll show you the monkey. By the time the marketing and branding campaign for the new "Curious George" movie has fully metastasized, you'll be begging for a few monkey-free moments, an occasional monkey-less vista, a day without a monkey. I say this, mind you, as someone who deeply, deeply loves the monkey. And who liked the movie too — which turns out to be as simple, friendly, kid-appropriate and nontoxic as any major motion picmerchtainment franchise could ever hope to be. Add to that the movie is hand-drawn and limited to just two dimensions — somebody please help me to a chair.
 
  "Curious George" the movie is surprisingly faithful in look and feel to its source material, considering what usually happens, and especially considering the character has spent the last 16 years in development purgatory. As reported in an article that ran here Sunday, George has cycled through 42 writers, nine animation studios, I don't know how many directors and just about every trend in animation since Roger Rabbit was framed. Clearly, PETA was not kept abreast.
 


         






    The big difference between this monkey and H.A. and Margret Rey's? He's now conspicuously eyeballed. Millions of dollars later, George's coal-lump peepers are now black and
 white, thanks very much, because studio executives believe eyeballs make him more "accessible" to children. Everybody's opinion is special.
 
  The movie begins with George traipsing around in the jungle, getting into trouble, while folksy surfer Jack Johnson sings and strums in the background. I never got the appeal of Johnson, who composed 16 original songs for the movie. But in this context, I confess, I was with it. His music has the power to focus and calm the savage toddler. And having not-long-enough ago survived a nerve-obliterating Saturday morning screening of "Chicken Little," an anti-nap movie if ever there was one, I left the theater with a newfound respect for his talents.
 
  In a nutshell, "Curious George" is an interspecies, cross-cultural love story that ends well. Will Ferrell plays the Man in the Yellow Hat, renamed "Ted" for reasons that remain mysterious. His banana-inspired fashion sense, on the other hand, is demystified in a funny shopping scene. Ted's cartoon love interest, a teacher named Maggie, plays Drew Barrymore, down to her errant lower lip. George, meanwhile, subliminally channels King Kong, the best-case-scenario version. (Were you to sit a hundred monkeys at an Avid station and let them splice together "Curious George" with "King Kong," you might end up with the simian version of "Mulholland Drive," the light and dark side of what happens to innocent jungle monkeys who brave the big, bad city.)
 
  The story begins when Ted, a geeky docent, is informed by his boss Mr. Bloomsberry (Dick Van Dyke) that the museum is broke. Unless Ted can think of a solution, it will be torn down to make way for a parking structure, which Mr. Bloomsberry's jealous son Bloomsberry Jr. (David Cross) is only too eager to erect. So Ted goes off to Africa to find the Lost Shrine of Zagawa, and comes back instead with a tiny trinket and naughty monkey, who stowed away on the ship and survived thanks to the Dole� brand bananas in the cargo hold. 
 
 
This setback is overcome, naturally, by the end of the movie, at which point the museum is transformed into something resembling the Universal City Walk. This is an unwelcome jolt back to reality, especially if you, like me, actually happen to be at the Universal City Walk. But this is a minor moment, and the movie's only jarring one. 
 
 
With his new eyeballs, and his abiding love for Ted, George is considerably more anthropomorphized than before. And with his cuddly new name, the "Man" is likewise less creepily anonymous. Overall, the film version feels warmer than the books, stressing the monkey's amour fou 
for Ted, that yellow-headed heartbreaker. What it lacks somewhat is that brainy celebration of la différence
 (between man and monkey, of course) that gave the books a wilder edge, a feeling that despite their affection for one another, George and the Man were essentially strangers. Eyeball-less, and ignorant of his friend's name, George was a primal force that the Man in the Yellow Hat could never quite control. No wonder the new line of products to be sold at Kmart and Target will be modeled on the new-look George, while higher-end stores will stick with the old, literary monkey.
 
  The old George was an irrepressible id, a reminder of the fragile equilibrium (not to mention polite distance) between nature and civilization. The new one is a future plush toy.
 
 'Curious George'

 
 MPAA rating:
 G   

Children's books today often feature illustrations so dazzling they're works of art, but that only enhances my love for the magical simplicity of the Curious George  books, which were first published in the 1940s. There was never anything fussy or extraneous about H.A. Rey's drawings of George and his adventurous misbehavior. The eager rascal of a monkey  a stand-in, of course, for every last child who read the books  would dunk himself into a pot of spaghetti or paint a fancy New York living room to resemble his palm-treed jungle home, yet even as he acted like a very bad boy, the tone of the stories was open-eyed, gentle, curiously becalmed. The soft dabs of color told you that there was nothing all that wrong with what George was doing. Left to his own devices, he couldn't help but get himself into a pickle; that's what monkeys do. He was an angelic mischief-maker, and so the books had the effect of letting a kid feel especially good about being a kid.
Given the hellzapoppin', media-zapped, ADD nature of so much contemporary animation, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new cartoon of Curious George , featuring the voice of Will Ferrell as the Man in the Yellow Hat, doesn't veer all that far from the soothing tone of the books. This isn't a high-tech kinetic update, like the Stuart Little  films, engineered to occupy kids and adults at the same time. It's truly a fairy tale for toddlers  and no one very much older. Set to a series of noodling musical numbers by Jack Johnson, a singer-songwriter so mild he makes James Taylor sound like Trent Reznor, Curious George  is a sweet trifle, but maybe a little bit too sweet. George himself doesn't speak, but he does coo, and he grins his adorable grin so much that the movie comes close to denying he's any sort of troublemaker.
Will Ferrell, reduced to a voice, is more paternal, less hysterical than usual; he turns the Man in the Yellow Hat into an affably game science nerd, and Drew Barrymore, as the teacher who has a crush on him, flirts engagingly. There are a few contempo anachronisms, like the fact that the Man in the Yellow Hat has caller ID, not to mention a first name (it's Ted). But I would have gladly overlooked them had his attempt to retrieve the Lost Shrine of Zagawa  a towering ape statue from Africa  carried even a glint of urgency. It's George, of course, who screws everything up, and charmingly so when his King Kong-size reflection gets projected onto New York traffic, but Curious George  ends up being a bit tame for megaplex monkey business.

 In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, Curious George — or "the monkey," as he's called for the first two-thirds of this new animated film — doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture.  In fact, Curious George doesn't even talk. Instead, he makes cute chittering noises, eats bananas and peeks playfully from beneath the yellow hat belonging to his human companion, the Man in the Yellow Hat (here given a name, Ted, and voiced by Will Ferrell). In this film version of "Curious George," directed by Matthew O'Callaghan,  George is all monkey — a quality that will not only appeal to children, but will also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey and are not eager to see them turned into the slangy, ironic metacartoons now in fashion.  Ted, an earnest guide at the Bloomsberry Museum, heads to Africa in search of the long-lost idol of Zagawa. To his chagrin, the statue turns out to be tiny, and his hopes of saving the failing museum with a grand new acquisition are dashed. But unbeknownst to Ted, the baby monkey he befriended has followed him as a stowaway on the ship home.  George's mischievous antics soon get Ted fired from his job, much to the delight of his nemesis, Bloomsberry Jr. (David Cross), who dreams of seeing the museum turned into a parking lot. But after getting into and out of a few more scrapes, Ted and George manage both to salvage the museum and impress Maggie (Drew Barrymore), the elementary school teacher of Ted's dreams. With top-drawer voice talent including Joan Plowright and Dick Van Dyke, original songs by Jack Johnson, and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation that echoes the simple colors and shapes of the books, "Curious George" is an unexpected delight.

It's not just the animation that's two-dimensional in "Curious George." Rudimentary on every level, this long-gestating Universal pic based on the children's character is pitched toward the youngest of kids -- roughly ages zygote to 4 -- with direct-to-video quality animation, plotting and backgrounds. Nothing wrong with that per se, except there's zero here to divert adults, making its 86 minutes feel dangerously close to a hostage situation. The appetite for even mediocre G-rated fare suggests there's a market for this (see "Chicken Little"), but "George" is much better suited to home viewing, allowing parents to seek refuge elsewhere.
Faced with a film replete with original songs by Jack Johnson featuring "Sesame Street"-style lyrics, even patient parents will likely be bored to death. (At the premiere screening, the host of a TV entertainment magazine show actually took a cellphone call during the movie, and he probably wasn't alone.)
For those unfamiliar with the 1940s character created by Margret and H.A. Rey, the troublemaking monkey has received a few modern updates. For instance, there's now an actual name for the little simian's human pal (Ted) known strictly as "the man with the yellow hat" in the books.
The modestly constructed story has Ted (voiced by Will Ferrell) embarking on a jungle expedition to bring back a massive idol that will save the natural history museum where he's employed. Barring such a coup for his employer, Bloomsberry (Dick Van Dyke), the site will be closed and transformed into a parking lot by Bloomsberry's needy son Junior (David Cross, whose animated likeness is his spitting image).
So Ted heads to Africa, where he encounters a playful monkey who he eventually names George. As voiced by Frank Welker, the vocalizations are somewhere between a cooing baby and a poor chimp impersonation.
Stowing away in Ted's ship, George follows him back to civilization, where Ted's failure to find the sought-after artifact (thanks to sabotage by Junior) leaves the threat of closure dangling over the museum. Along the way, Ted receives support from Maggie (Drew Barrymore), a teacher whose frequent class trips have more to do with an interest in him than her students.
There's not much more to it than that, with various chases through the city (one tethered to balloons) all set to those droning songs. And while the cartoonish renderings are in keeping with images of the well-known character, as directed by Matthew O'Callaghan, who cut his creative teeth at Disney, there's simply no magic or sparkle in either the actual or asphalt jungles that George inhabits.
That said, the youngest of kids should be able to sit through the movie dutifully -- especially at home, where at least they're treated to lots of primary colors.

As proverbs and maybe millions of years of evolution tell us, curiosity proves fatal only for meddlesome felines. Thankfully, certain incorrigible monkeys are free to mess around with impunity. Curious George   has walked a rather remarkable road from sketch to screen; in a way, we have the Nazis to thank for the popular children's book series. Creators Margret and H.A. Rey , both German Jews, fled Paris in 1940 on bicycle with only their winter coats and a few picture books containing early scribblings of a naughty little banana connoisseur called Fifi ( le curieux ?), renamed George upon arrival in New York. The film version is mercifully more concise than other paeans to primate high jinks currently chest-thumping in theaters. The cheekiest of monkeys, George beguiles zebras, elephants, and yellow-hatted men alike with spry, Keaton-esque athleticism and criminal cutesiness in his journey from Africa to American metropolis. Simian inquisitiveness becomes a metaphor for our primal need for companionship. And David Cross , already an expert in the jerk-witted grandiloquence of Tobias F monkeyshines as a ponytailed, sniveling heavy, seeking fatherly affirmation and a big payday for turning his dad's failing museum into a multilevel parking lot. Misanthropic toddlers will be rolling in the aisles.
