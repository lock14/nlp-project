Watching Williams as Teddy Roosevelt ogle through binoculars Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) while she stalks around a glassed-in display like some hippie chick in a buffalo-skin straitjacket after a bad trip at Woodstock �94 makes me sad and uncomfortable. That a couple of no-names portraying an oblivious Lewis and Clark casually argue directions by pointing hither and yon � no, west is that
 way, dude � doesn't help. And why do the Wild West and Roman Empire dioramas get to come out and play, but the Mayans remain confined? Maybe I'm just getting old: I didn't complain when Beethoven freestyled on music-store synthesizers at the San Dimas Mall before getting arrested in the Carlin-and-Keanu-driven Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure
. But Night at the Museum
 is a family film aimed at first-graders, not teenagers. It must be held to higher standards. It is formative. Unfortunately, it's also incredibly stupid. Stiller stars as Larry Daley, a would-be schemer and all-but-deadbeat dad living in Brooklyn who finds a job as a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History so he doesn't have to move to Queens. Doing so would disappoint his son, Nick (Cherry), who wants to become a bond trader. There's your tension. On his first night, after inheriting the instruction manual from the "downsized" Cecil (Van Dyke, who looks like he's having a blast), Reginald (Cobbs), and Gus (Rooney), Larry discovers that the place goes apeshit after dark: The Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton reanimates, as do Attila the Hun, an Easter Island Moai, and the entire Hall of African Mammals. Credit Levy � who shoots everything imagination-size, larger than life, and set against amber tones � for unleashing the beasts almost immediately. Amid crummy sight gags and predictable physical comedy, scenes that sputter so awkwardly they feel like they're being started back up by a hand crank every time a bit of dialogue is exchanged, and the stale and watered-down talent that is Stiller in another nonsense story, Night at the Museum
 is at best a rotation of backdrops for its parade of visual effects. Take solace in those and the fact that 8-year-olds everywhere are about to discover the joy of Gervais, here in the role of bow-tied curator Dr. McPhee, not to mention Gugino as docent Rebecca in a series of low-cut sweaters. Still, they'll probably show the most love for a pugnacious Rooney � looking rather waxen and reanimated himself � whose only competition as Stiller's comic foil is a capuchin monkey.


This probably falls under the category of too much information, but when I was a kid growing up in Boston, I used to have a recurring dream -- not quite a nightmare -- about getting locked in the old Museum of Science overnight. The dioramas would slowly come to life, and while I don't remember all the particulars, my neck still prickles when I think about the barn owl flapping its wings against the glass and the severed T. rex head swiveling its eyes my way.
Maybe I even managed to get the coins out of the optical-illusion goblet; who knows? My point is that I'm hardly unbiased when it comes to a movie called "Night at the Museum." The new family film is frenzied and gallumptious in ways typical to modern Hollywood, and the plot leaks buckets even for a kid-flick fantasy. But I'll say this -- the movie's fun, and it honors the secret promise dinosaur skeletons and stuffed critters offer to children: As soon as you turn your back, they move
.
"Night" is essentially one big ad for New York's Museum of Natural History, but that's acceptable as product placements go. Ben Stiller plays Larry Daley, a dreamy Brooklyn schnook who gets a job as the museum's new night guard to convince his ex-wife (Kim Raver) and young son (Jake Cherry) he's dependable. What he doesn't know is that the whole place starts dancing the moment the sun sets.
Why? Does it matter? It has something to do with a magic amulet over in the Egyptian wing, but the upshot is that Larry has to deal with a frisky T. rex skeleton (it likes to play fetch), the beasts of the African veldt (including a capuchin monkey somewhat brighter than the hero), Attila and his Huns, a gum-obsessed Easter Island statue (voiced by Brad Garrett). Etcetera.
The production design is garish but delightful, and director Shawn Levy keeps filing oddities past in the background: faceless Civil War mannequins, Inuits, Pilgrims, clomping bronze explorers. Lewis and Clark spend every night arguing over which way to go.
Since it is the Museum of Natural History, its founder, Teddy Roosevelt, is on hand, played by Robin Williams with what counts for him as restraint and providing Larry with the character-building bully the script requires. (The ex- president has a mildly creepy crush on Mizuo Peck's Sacajawea, but every movie needs a love story, if only a waxen one.)
Better, Larry has to broker peace between two warring factions of itty-bitty historical figures: an Old West cowboy played by an uncredited Owen Wilson and the Roman emperor Octavius, played by Steve Coogan ("Tristram Shandy"). This pits American slacker-dude humor against snippy British bile in ways the routine script by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon ("Herbie Fully Loaded," "The Pacifier") doesn't leverage. But that's all right, since the actors more than compensate.
"Night at the Museum," in fact, is stuffed with smart performers doing graciously silly work, and all Levy has to do is manage traffic. (With a resume that includes the "Cheaper by the Dozen" remakes, he can at least do that.) Coogan's countryman Ricky Gervais, of the original "The Office," plays the twitty museum director, and his scenes are small marvels of inarticulate blither .
Best of all, the troika of retiring guards who advise Larry on his appointed nightly rounds include Bill Cobbs, Dick Van Dyke, and the unstoppable Mickey Rooney, who at this point resembles the world's oldest, angriest troll. Van Dyke is still limber enough to remind us of sitcom ottomans past, and Rooney just has to enter the frame and fix Stiller with beady eye to provoke helpless laughter.
The dreariest pieces are the life lessons Larry and son have to learn at the end. The goofy original kids' book by Milan Trenc didn't need them and neither does the movie. (The light romance between Stiller and Carla Gugino's fetching museum docent, on the other hand, is perfectly digestible.) "Night at the Museum" is nobody's idea of art, but it's an unexpectedly swell ride, most of all when it plays along the hazy line between a diorama and a child's lovely nightmares.


         Someone had a terrific idea to make a movie from the Milan Trenc children's book "The Night at the Museum," in which the displays at a natural history museum come to life at night. But at 32 pages, it would require some imaginative fleshing out.
 
  Unfortunately, the ideas seem to have dried up after someone decided to drop an article and retitle it "Night at the Museum." The resulting film, a tedious family comedy starring Ben Stiller as a luckless dreamer named Larry Daley, tacks on an uninspired back story and a ton of special effects but never engages.
 


         






    The inventor of an ill-fated device called the Snapper — lights go on and off at the snap of your fingers — Larry is on the verge of being evicted from his apartment when he takes a job as a night watchman at the museum. He sees it as a last chance to prove himself to his ex-wife (Kim Raver) and young son (Jake Cherry), who has decided he wants to be a bond trader like his mother's fiancé (Paul Rudd).
 
  On Larry's first night, he's left alone by the three aging guards he's replacing — played by Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs — and soon finds himself chased down the hallways by the very lively skeleton of a T-Rex. Because the character of Larry is never really developed, the stakes are never high enough for us to be invested in the outcome. The bulk of the movie is a series of sight gags and set pieces that wreak much havoc but little else.
 
  The presence of funny men Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt, Owen Wilson as a cowboy named Jedediah, Steve Coogan as Roman Emperor Octavius and Ricky Gervais as the pretentious museum director adds humor, but it's not enough to keep the film from dragging, even during its frantic last half-hour.
 
  Directed by Shawn Levy with an emphasis on mayhem over anything resembling an interesting story, the movie was adapted by screenwriters Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon. Cavemen and dinosaurs, cowboys and Roman soldiers, lions and zebras, all running amok, sounds like more fun than it is.
 
 
 "Night at the Museum,"
 rated PG for mild action, language and brief rude humor. Running time: 1 hours, 48 minutes. In general release.   

 Correction Appended  In “Night at the Museum,” gigantism rules. This season’s answer to “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” it’s an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy.  Yes, the bag does hold some clever robotic toys, but many are broken. If you were to line up the niftiest thingamajigs created for this tale of a would-be inventor-turned-night-watchman, you might have something resembling “ ‘Jumanji’ Meets ‘The Wizard of Oz’ With a Dash of ‘Home Alone.’ ” But the fable arrives smothered in an uneasy blend of wisecracks and pallid inspirational blather.  A self-described action-adventure comedy, “Night at the Museum” is exactly that: it wants to be all things to all people under a certain age. Shawn Levy (“Cheaper by the Dozen,” the “Pink Panther” remake), who directed from Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon’s adaptation of a book by Milan Trenc, subscribes enthusiastically to the current Hollywood philosophy that coherence doesn’t matter if enough stuff is thrown onto the screen. Contributing to the bulk is a score (by Alan Silvestri) that rivals the “Star Wars” soundtracks in pounding grandiosity.  It’s fair to say that “Night at the Museum” is better than the insufferable Jim Carrey “Grinch,” a landmark of holiday film excess. It knows how to build excitement by steadily accelerating the pace and widening the spectacle. Almost in spite of itself, it sets off occasional little bursts of cinematic magic.  The movie begins as a droopy family comedy about the divorced, unemployed Larry Daley (Ben Stiller, ably going through the motions), who is so down and out he may have to move from Manhattan to (gasp!) Queens. It quickly builds to a C.G.I. extravaganza unleashed in the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. There (where the movie wasn’t actually filmed, except for exteriors), its hapless protagonist takes a job as the museum’s night watchman.  Larry, oblivious to the strange looks on the faces of the three guards he’s replacing — Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) — has no idea what’s awaiting him. No sooner have they departed, handing him the keys with strict instructions that nothing  leave the museum, than the place  stirs to life. In no time Larry is playing frightened ringmaster to a rampaging circus of exhibits that have come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet.  A Tyrannosaurus rex hops off its pedestal and like a famished zombie begins clumping after Larry, who discovers that if he throws it a bone, it fetches like a dog. Cute. A stone head from Easter Island demands bubble gum. And a cheeky monkey named Dexter steals Larry’s keys, tears up his instructions and engages him in a face-slapping routine.  At first it seems as though the menacing wild animals (both prehistoric and contemporary) will be Larry’s nemeses. But “Night at the Museum” squeezes the most juice from its historical figures, some life-sized, others miniature, some in dioramas and others on pedestals. The most amusing image is of Mr. Stiller, wide-eyed and floppy-eared, besieged by bands of tiny, finger-sized warriors furiously hurling spears and darts at him.  Of the historical figures, Robin Williams’s Teddy Roosevelt is the noisiest. Once this statue steps off his equestrian roost, he behaves like a bossy, slogan-dispensing drill instructor, whipping Larry into moral shape. But beneath his bluster, the facsimile of the 26th president is an emotional basket case, who admits in a weak moment that he is a synthetic product manufactured in Poughkeepsie. For most of the film, he pines silently after Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), the famous Indian tracker locked inside the glass case of a Lewis and Clark diorama.  Profitable screen time is devoted to the continuing territorial squabble between tiny figurines of Octavius (Steve Coogan), the Roman general, and Jedediah (Owen Wilson, uncredited), a rootin’-tootin’ American cowboy. Bizarrely, the movie gives their dispute a gay subtext. In a slip of the tongue, Octavius addresses Larry as Mary, and Jedediah, quoting from “Brokeback Mountain,” tells Octavius, “I can’t quit you.” I guess it means that nowadays such smidgens of “South Park” humor are thrown into family movies to make everybody feel terribly knowing.  But when “Night at the Museum” returns to Larry’s personal life, it dies. The movie doesn’t even make a pretense of being interested in the scenes between Larry and Nick (Jake Cherry), the 10-year-old son whose respect he is losing. And its cynical lack of concern for giving the characters human feelings is a grave drawback for a movie that wants to engage children.  “Night at the Museum” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

History comes alive in "Night at the Museum" -- the movie, alas, does not. About as dull as a film could be with Attila the Hun, Teddy Roosevelt and lots of exotic wildlife rounding out the cast, this rambunctious, "Jumanji"-style extravaganza is a gallery of special effects in search of a story; rarely has so much production value yielded so little in terms of audience engagement. Still, star Ben Stiller and the promise of state-of-the-art (and at some venues, Imax-enhanced) visual wonderment should help "Museum" exhibit some B.O. life during and beyond the holiday frame.
Author Milan Trenc's tall tale about the supernatural goings-on at New York's American Museum of Natural History -- in which every statue and figurine mysteriously comes to life at night -- makes for a perfectly endurable 32-page children's book.
In padding out that premise to accommodate a 108-minute feature, scribes Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon have supplied some perfunctory conflict, a creaky father-son drama and a few twists to explain the nocturnal phenomenon. But unlike the recent "Zathura," which elaborated on its slim picture-book conceit with warmth, emotion and narrative surprise, "Night at the Museum" never feels like more than an excuse to show off the latest CGI advancements.
Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is a lazy dreamer whose inability to hold down a job or an apartment is taking a toll on his relationship with his son, Nick (Jake Cherry). With the encouragement of his way-too-understanding ex-wife Erica ("24's" Kim Raver), Larry gets serious about his job search and ends up as night watchman at the museum.
Protag is initiated into his new gig by a cranky museum director (a surprisingly unfunny Ricky Gervais) and the three curmudgeonly, vaguely sinister guards he'll be replacing (played by an impressive trio of veterans, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs). But nothing prepares him for his first night on the job, when an enormous T-Rex skeleton suddenly leaps to life.
With monkeys and lions and zebras (oh my) also shaking off their hibernation, and famous figures like the aforementioned Attila (Patrick Gallagher) running amok in the corridors, it's not long before the museum starts to resemble a toga party thrown by history enthusiasts at the local zoo.  Among the more recognizable faces are Robin Williams as a waxwork Teddy Roosevelt, nursing a bizarre crush on Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck); Steve Coogan as a pint-sized but militant Octavius; and, as an equally tiny American cowboy, Stiller's perpetual costar Owen Wilson (making an uncredited appearance).
Under the supervision of Jim Rygiel ("Lord of the Rings"), the visual effects are imaginatively executed -- from the various trick shots accommodating both Stiller and the Lilliputian figurines to the persuasively generated wild animals (courtesy of "Chronicles of Narnia" f/x house Rhythm & Hues, which clearly has the market cornered on photorealistic lions). Much credit should also go to costume designer Renee April, whose diverse creations here include Neanderthal garb, Roosevelt's military uniform and the robe worn by the fictitious emperor Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek).
Yet surprisingly for a film that consists of one eye-popping bedazzlement after another, the overall feeling provoked is one of bland indifference. And though it comes equipped with handy lessons about the importance of knowing your history, the pic proceeds from the assumption that museums are inherently stuffy places -- never mind that all this digitized mayhem is far less stimulating than, say, a guided audio tour of the Smithsonian.
Working on a broader and more expensive canvas than he has in the past, director Shawn Levy ("The Pink Panther," "Cheaper by the Dozen") can't sustain a meaningful comic rhythm, let alone any interest in his central characters, who are consistently upstaged by the pic's visual design. But then, this wouldn't be the first time a filmmaker has been overpowered by the fancy gadgets at his disposal. 
Naturally, Larry's latent problem-solving skills soon kick in and, in the process, he proves himself to be a good father. But in the wake of the recent deadbeat-dad drama "The Pursuit of Happyness," the film's dramatic construction looks even more threadbare: Stiller's Larry doesn't seem to have a paternal bone in his body, while Nick is little more than a narrative appendage, trotted out at regular intervals to either grin or look cutely neglected.
Though the pic makes deft use of exterior shots of the famous Gotham institution, production designer Claude Pare largely conceived the museum's interiors from scratch, with grandly convincing results. Alan Silvestri's score is a bit on the obvious side. 


Ben Stiller  as usual, frazzled with a touch of hipster frumpis a divorced dad in need of a gig, lest his cutie-pie kid wind up spending all of his time with uptight, bond-trading New Dad (Paul Rudd , wasted in a straitlaced cameo). So Stiller's Larry takes a job as night watchman at the Museum of Natural History, where things go bump in the night thanks to an Egyptian trinket that animates stuffed mannequins and waxworks. The first half-hour's too slow; the last half-hour's too manic, as if to compensate. But at least it entertains, thanks in large measure to the buddy-pic relationship between Owen Wilson 's miniature cowpoke and his Roman pal Steve Coogan . Stiller's almost irrelevant to the proceedings; his best scene involves a smartass monkey slapping him stupid, which is as dumb as it sounds. But he's boring because he has to be, lest Teddy Roosevelt  (Robin Williams ) run off with Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) while Dick Van Dyke  and Mickey Rooney  (not wax figuresreally ) get away with the goods. Yeah, it's that kind of holiday movie.
