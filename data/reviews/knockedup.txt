The attraction that exists between wisecracking, hirsute Jewish males and reserved, statuesque gentile females is one of Western civilization�s great wonders, a sociological anomaly that causes thousands of otherwise agnostic wisecracking, hirsute Jewish males to rush off to synagogue each year and give thanks. Ben Stone (Rogen) is such a male: a scruffy, round-faced, good-natured schlub who uses his deadpan wit as a defense mechanism against a world that often doesn�t put much stock in being scruffy or even good-natured. To give Ben some friendly cover, writer/director Apatow surrounds him with a juvenile band of like-minded slackers, played by actors from his cult-favorite TV shows Freaks & Geeks
 and Undeclared
 and his 2005 movie, The 40 Year-Old Virgin
. (Like Preston Sturges, Apatow prefers the comfort of a stock company of comedy players.) Together they form a pack of disaffected modern-day Peter Pans who sidestep the responsibilities of adulthood by pretending they don�t exist, which isn�t hard to do when your brain is stuffed with marijuana smoke and movie trivia. Ben�s right at home in this shambolic world: He�s got the cleverest put-downs and the largest catalog of pop-culture knowledge, and he�s the most adept at using a gas-mask bong. So when he meets Alison (Heigl), a beautiful, blond, buxom, impossible dream of a woman, and unwittingly impregnates her during a one-night stand, it�s clear his introduction to the world of adult accountability is going to be messy. Like most of Apatow�s work, Knocked Up
 walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality, and though it�s extremely funny in bursts, the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act. The fault lies as much with Apatow�s casting as his writing. Rogen may have a gift for deadpan one-liners, but he doesn�t have the skills to carry a movie with this many emotional peaks and valleys: Laugh here, weep there; regress then, grow now; smoke this joint, raise that baby. It�s a heavy load for any actor to carry, much less a one-trick pony like Rogen. Interestingly, the actor who might have pulled off the role best was already a part of the cast: Rudd, who plays Alison�s brother-in-law, Pete, strikes a tone of snarky indifference and disappointed self-awareness that would have been a perfect fit for the reluctantly heroic Ben. As amusing as he may be, Rogen was born to be someone else�s comic sidekick.


"The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and his new "Knocked Up" make writer-director Judd Apatow today's preeminent creator of low-concept sex comedies. The sex is unsafe, the drug use is rambunctious, and the lewd jokes are delivered with cheer. Yet what happens to his life-size characters could happen to us -- if not, perhaps, adult virginity, then at least holding out for real love. Certain family values remain magically sacrosanct.
In "Knocked Up," the premise is easily digestible. A budding TV personality becomes pregnant after she beds a doofus and inveterate pothead she meets in a Los Angeles nightclub. They're both in their 20s. She's a beauty named Alison (Katherine Heigl ). He's a stocky Canadian slob named Ben (Seth Rogen ). Ostensibly, all they have in common is horniness.
The days before their meeting, the meeting itself, and the sex happen in a very funny collection of scenes. And quickly we learn that Alison's story will be as well - rounded as Ben's. She lives in a cottage behind the rustic suburban house where her older sister (Leslie Mann ) lives with her husband (Paul Rudd ) and their two daughters. Alison has just been promoted to an on-air interviewer position at E! and is wary of divulging the news of her pregnancy to her vapid co-workers.
The first half-hour sets the bar pretty high. But the rest of "Knocked Up" is equally sharp, mostly because it turns a convention on its head. Daringly, the movie upends the joke of Ben's fatherhood by showing him falling in love -- not simply with Alison, but with the idea of a family. His wish to be more than some baby-daddy isn't just funny; it's tender and quite lovely.
That's not to say that Apatow stints on the laughs. Thanks to Ben's grubby coterie of friends, outrageousness is built around the movie's bracingly wholesome -- OK, unfashionably conservative -- center. Ben lives in the San Fernando Valley in a filthy house with roommates -- Jonah Hill , Jay Baruchel , Jason Segel , and Martin Starr -- who are galactic stoners, too. The opening sequence gives you the gist: They suck on bongs, dance by their pool, and hit the amusement park, all while Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Shimmy Shimmy Ya" growls on the soundtrack. They're starting a Web business devoted to locating celebrity nude scenes in movies. Basically, the sloth is so thick we could choke on it.
Ben is obnoxious, but in an adolescent way. He doesn't seem like a 23-year-old going on 14. He actually seems 14. Rogen , who had a smaller part as one of Steve Carell's buddies in "Virgin," is something rare in comedy: a guy whose boorishness has charm. The packaging helps. He may talk like a sailor but he's built like the cuddliest of plumbers. He makes it easy to accept that a woman would agree to raise a child with this man even if that woman isn't necessarily you.
Still, it's not entirely clear why Alison proceeds to build a relationship with the jobless, moneyless Ben. For one thing, she never witnesses the beautiful conversation between Ben and his dad (Harold Ramis ) about paternity. Still, the couple looks for a gynecologist together. He agrees to watch "Breathless " with her while his buddies play paintball. To help with his "work," she willingly assists him in for choice female body parts. It hardly seems like a fair exchange.
Her tolerance is actually astounding. Throughout the film, you're waiting for the other shoe to drop and for her to pick it up and throw it at him. Heigl is believable and sympathetic. She plays one of the doctors on "Grey's Anatomy," and she's at her best here when she's going through Alison's hormonal tantrums and hurt feelings.
Alison, though, has nothing on her sister, Debbie. The brittle marriage between Debbie and her husband Pete becomes a possible preview of what she and Ben can anticipate if they make it: thinly veiled acrimony. Debbie is the film's strangest character. She's volatile and emasculating (in a moment that's funny for its unrelenting meanness, she accuses Pete of not being concerned about the alarming number of pedophiles in their neighborhood), but she's needy and worried about Pete's suspicious disappearances.
Debbie gets away with being such a cauldron of extremes because the airy-voiced Mann is extremely good at playing them. She happens to be Apatow's wife (the kids in the movie are theirs), and with the possible exception of T�a Leoni , it's hard to imagine who else could get away with this combination of needling and affection. Rudd is her comedic equal, if not her emotional one. He's been playing variations of the unhappy husband for a while, but he finds characteristically silly ways of expressing it: Here he deadpans while Mann goes ballistic. It's a strategy that's worked for many a sitcom husband.
Apatow has actually spent most of his career in television, creating such superior programs as "Freaks and Geeks " and "Undeclared ," two series that wed the raucously antic with great humanity (they were promptly canceled). His sensibility is suited for the small screen. But his comedy philosophy works even better concentrated in a single movie: Funny and human needn't be mutually exclusive.
In "Knocked Up," after Pete and Ben have fights with their women, they go to Vegas, do some mushrooms, trip out at Cirque du Soleil , then, still high, search their souls back at their hotel room. If Paul Mazursky had ever written a scene for Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble , it would go like this.
At some point earlier, Pete makes the wounded observation that "marriage is like 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' except that it's not funny." Apatow invests all his scenes with that kind of piquant feeling. 
In both of his movies, there's a lot of truth in the characters' neediness, their joy, and the struggle to hold onto their standards. Life may be like a sitcom, but the comedy generously springs from the situation of being alive.


         THE poster for Judd Apatow's first feature, "The 40Year-Old Virgin," gave us Steve Carell gazing beatifically into the middle distance above the encouraging tagline, "Better late than never." The poster for his second feature, "Knocked Up," gives us Seth Rogen gazing sheepishly into the camera below the rather more sobering "What if this guy got you pregnant?" Rogen arches an eyebrow in a way that suggests he knows you could do better. He's really sorry. He hopes you can learn to like him.
 
 The movie hopes so too, so it seriously stacks the deck in his favor. The distinctive element in Apatow's comedy has always been his love for what might be called the differently socialized (the term "loser" buys in too readily to a system that the writer-director clearly doesn't subscribe to), and "Knocked Up" follows happily in that tradition, with the opening sequence an exuberant tribute to the dumb life. But if "Virgin" mined all that was most pathetic and painful about its hero's predicament to create the kind of comedy that made you want to avert your eyes and scream, "Knocked Up" takes it surprisingly easy on Rogen's character, Ben, even though he's young and beefy and could probably handle the criticism.
 


         






   Ben Stone (Rogen) is an amiable slacker and dedicated stoner whose marshmallow physique underscores his even softer aspirations. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a dewy Valkyrie, recently promoted to on-camera talent on the E! network. Ben and Alison meet one evening at a nightclub where Alison has gone to celebrate a promotion with her older, married sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann). When Debbie is prematurely called away on a child-related emergency, Alison decides to stay behind and keep drinking with Ben and his buddies — much to their surprise and, frankly, ours.
 
 Is this what it's come to for the youth of today? The result of all Facebook and no face-to-face? Because there once was a time, long ago, when to get these two together, you'd have had to maroon them on the Blue Lagoon. And yet here, an ill-advised one-night stand leads to an unplanned pregnancy, an unplanned pregnancy leads to a decision to keep the baby, and a decision to keep the baby leads to the young odd couple, barely into their 20s, deciding to make the best of it and try to make the as-yet-nonexistent relationship work.
 
 It's a promising premise, and Apatow takes it unexpected directions. But "Knocked Up" is so enamored of Ben and his insouciant charm that it fails to wonder what it must feel like for the girl. It's one thing to go with the idea that Ben and Alison dwell in different leagues, which after all is the point of the movie. It's another thing altogether for the heroine, who in true girl-on-pedestal form is beautiful, smart, successful, nice and pretty much cool with everything, never to get even the tiniest chance to wonder if maybe she might have done a little better. Alison's view of her future with Ben fluctuates according to what he does or doesn't do in a given situation, or how well or badly her sister and brother-in-law Pete (Paul Rudd) are getting along. But it's never measured up to her own hopes or dreams for a relationship. What her type is, we'll never know.
 
 It should come as no surprise that a movie like this will be firmly entrenched in the boys'-eye-view. But if Alison weren't so pregnant, you'd swear she was stuck in the role of the sacrificial virgin. Ben lives in a post-college frat-house with his buddies Jay (Jay Baruchel), Jason (Jason Segel), Jonah (Jonah Hill), Martin (Martin Starr) and Jodi (Charlyne Yi), where they spend their days combing movies for nude scenes to catalog on their website and thinking up creative ways to smoke pot (fish bowl on the head, snorkeling mask, etc.).
 
 Alison, meanwhile, dwells in splendor and isolation in Debbie and Pete's backyard guesthouse, Alison exists on the margins of her big sister's life. She's never made to suffer the indignity of explaining her situation to her actual friends because she doesn't appear to have any. Until Ben comes along, there are no men in her life, and her only friends, glimpsed for a second, appear to be a trio of catty frenemies she hasn't seen in months. Her first visit to a gynecologist comes only after her first missed period, and she finds the experience as alien as Ben does.
 
 Watching her slowly come around to the idea of mating with this guy for life, it's hard not to feel kind of sorry for her. Ben may have no job, no muscle tone and no clue what he's doing, but he may be the best thing that ever happened to Alison by virtue of the fact that he's pretty much the only thing that's ever happened to her outside of work.
 
 That's not to say "Knocked Up" isn't funny — it's so consistently well written that it sometimes seems as if every one of Apatow's lines has been lovingly hand-crafted by stoned Tyrolean monks. But somehow, probably because the central story doesn't quite jell, it's the loony, incidental throwaway moments that really make an impression — Paul Rudd freaking out over the sheer variety of chair styles in his hotel suite while tripping on mushrooms; Steve Carell as himself, backing away from a tense situation on the red carpet; Ryan Seacrest's hilarious self-satire as the guy with the most jobs in Hollywood; Leslie Mann's unhinged verbal assault on a bouncer for not letting her into a club; the bouncer's painfully candid and soul-searching reply; Kristen Wiig as the most terrifyingly passive-aggressive boss ever to schedule a meeting.
 
 Perhaps not surprisingly, it's the subplot involving Debbie and Pete that feels like the emotional core of the movie. Mann, who plays Debbie, is married to Apatow in real life, and her on-screen daughters are also her daughters with Apatow in real life. Still struggling to define themselves within the confines of marriage, they are clearly in love yet casually hurt each other without intending to. The complexity of their relationship, not to mention the actors' superb comic timing and emotional layers, make Alison and Ben's superficial view of their marriage seem childish and immature. They should be so lucky.
 
 

 
 "Knocked Up." MPAA rating: R for sexual content, drug use and language. Running time: 2 hours, 9 minutes. In general release.   

Knocked Up  is the very opposite of a storybook romance, and also the very model of a great comedy for our values-driven time: Slacker shlub Ben (Seth Rogen) meets career-girl beauty Alison (Katherine Heigl) at a sloshy bar in L.A., where all the women are strong (and work in television) and all the men are exactly average (and dream of hitting it big by launching a dirty website), and the two get drunk together. Sex happens. Slacker shlub and drunken beauty experience misunderstanding about the use of condoms. Conception happens. Beauty, no longer drunk, chooses to go through with pregnancy and raise child, even if dad is a baggy man-boy who lives with stoned roommates. Shlub announces, ''I'm on board.''
Ben doesn't exactly choose to grow up  he remains partial to rumpled T-shirts bearing slogans and convinced of his status as ''the guy girls f--- over.'' But by the time writer-director-producer Judd Apatow's extremely rude, extremely funny, irresistible fairy tale about contemporary American frogs, princesses, childbirth classes, and bongs comes to its sunny, satisfying conclusion, the shlub has become a mensch. Knocked Up  is comic chicken soup for the Colbert Nation soul.
How the auteur who previously crafted the timeless American romantic-comedy classic The 40 Year-Old Virgin  does this so successfully  mixes the raunchy with the sweet, the boob obsession with the sight of a baby's head crowning in childbirth, the gross laughs with the ungooey heart  can, I think, be credited to four strengths, and let's start with the shlubbiest: Seth Rogen as leading man. Was a guy who got lucky on a hook-up ever so believably a mix of decent Joe and  hapless meatball? Rogen's delivery of even the most provocative opinions (''Steely Dan gargles my balls'' is one I savor) is always tinged with distracted good spirits and self-deprecation. And his daft, lightly Jewish-identified sponginess sets off Heigl's own achievement in playing a sharply sensible shiksa to great advantage.
Second, in contrast to the terrors (and, lest we forget, hilarities) of unplanned, out-of-wedlock parenthood, Knocked Up  spends quality time with Alison's married sister, Debbie (embodied with showstopping authority and killer comic timing by Leslie Mann, whose credits include Big Daddy  and marriage to Apatow), her vaguely restless husband, Pete (handsome MVP of thinking-man's comedies, Paul Rudd), and their two young daughters (played with fizz by the Apatows' own spirited girls, Maude and Iris). Debbie and Pete aren't exactly the After to Alison and Ben's Before  they're more like experienced upperclassmen to freshman puppies overwhelmed with just getting to know one another clothed. In his depiction of imperfect, trial-and-error family life  funnier than Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage , but just as keenly observed  Apatow honors everything he holds serious without losing a single ticket buyer out for a yuk-a-minute good time.
Third, even more than in The 40 Year-Old Virgin , the movie has an uncanny empathy not just for dorks who like pictures of naked boobs, but for the gender that comes equipped with those boobs, too. Ben's got mouth-breathing housemates with a dumb penchant for horseplay and a dumber sense of hygiene and nutrition, and Apatow's knack for keeping faith with their retarded social development is admirable. But then, as Elaine on Seinfeld  might have put it, the filmmaker's got access to, uh, the equipment 24 hours a day. That he is able to nestle himself so comfortably in, uh, chick skin is the revelation of this guy's night/girl's night/date night/get-a-babysitter night treat. And for that the Academy would like to thank Ms. Mann, and the little Misses Maude and Iris Apatow for what are surely their contributions to their hubby and daddy's exquisitely raised, feminist consciousness when it comes to issues like pregnancy testing, body image, togetherness time, dining with another couple at a nice restaurant, and the whole Mars-versus-Venus thing.
Finally, Knocked Up  may be the sharpest, most up-to-date commentary on current pop culture not involving Jon Stewart or Comedy Central. The riffs tumble free and loose (''Matthew Fox  you know what's interesting about him? Absolutely nothing!''), and the references are elegantly tossed off, even in the presence of a gynecologist pointing out fetal features on a sonogram. (Says a queasy Ben, ''I'm breathing like James Gandolfini here!'') I'm breathing hard, too, because this comedy is such a blast of fresh air.

 It may be a bit, um, premature to say so, but Judd Apatow’s “Knocked Up” strikes me as an instant classic, a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment without straining, pandering or preaching. Like “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” Mr. Apatow’s earlier film, it attaches dirty humor to a basically upright premise. While this movie’s barrage of gynecology-inspired jokes would have driven the prudes at the old Hays Office mad, its story, about a young man trying to do what used to be the very definition of the Right Thing, might equally have brought a smile of approval to the lips of the starchiest old-Hollywood censor.  The wonder of “Knocked Up” is that it never scolds or sneers. It is sharp but not mean, sweet but not soft, and for all its rowdy obscenity it rarely feels coarse or crude. What it does feel is honest:  about love, about sex, and above all about the built-in discrepancies between what men and women expect from each  other and what they are likely to get. Starting, as he did in “Virgin,” from a default position of anti-romantic cynicism, Mr. Apatow finds an unlikely route back into romance, a road that passes through failure and humiliation on its meandering way toward comic bliss.  This improbable — and improbably persuasive — love story is embedded in what looks at first like a nest of sitcom clichés. The central would-be couple, Ben and Alison, represent the kind of schlub-babe pairing seen more frequently on television than anywhere else. Tall, blond and lovely, Alison (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted to an on-air job at the E! cable network when she meets Ben (Seth Rogen) at a nightclub. He is a pudgy, unkempt stoner who lives with a group of goofball pals. Their ratty communal apartment doubles as the headquarters of their nascent Internet enterprise, a Web site that will collect and catalog movie scenes in which famous actresses appear naked. (It never occurs to them that someone else may already have come up with this ingenious idea. Why else was the Internet invented?)  But Ben, whatever his shortcomings, is friendly and unpretentious, and it does not entirely defy belief when Alison, beer goggles firmly in place, takes him home to bed. Or, rather, to her sister’s house, where she sleeps in a spare room. The sister, Debbie (played by the brilliant Leslie Mann, Mr. Apatow’s wife), is on hand to send darts of envy and disapproval in Alison’s direction and also, along with her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), to incarnate both the ideal and the nightmare of heterosexual domesticity. Debbie is relentlessly critical, Pete is emotionally withdrawn, and together they dwell in a paradoxical state in which fulfillment — two charming young daughters, a big house with a pool, each other — seems indistinguishable from disappointment.  There is, as I’ve suggested, a certain familiarity to much of this: the bickering married couple; the competent, attractive young woman yoked to a slovenly and unambitious young man; the geeky slackers who communicate entirely through allusions to movies, comic books and old television shows. But Mr. Apatow, a creator of some of the best-loved, least-watched series in recent television history (notably “Freaks and Geeks” and “Undeclared”), has a sly way of subverting these familiar touchstones.  When one of Ben’s sperm, showing more initiative than the man who produced it (and taking advantage of an all-too-believable moment of condom carelessness) hits the reproductive jackpot, the stage seems to be set for a comedy of male panic. But that’s not quite how “Knocked Up” plays. Rather than being afraid of commitment, Ben appears fascinated by the idea, as if it were a distant land chronicled in legend and song. When he learns that Alison has decided to keep the baby — there is a funny, knowing riff on the reluctance of movies and television shows even to use the word “abortion” — he seems genuinely delighted.  Alison is somewhat more hesitant, not about the incipient child but about staying with Ben, whose hold on maturity is less sure than his grip on his favorite bong. She does not entirely trust him, but she likes him enough to worry about forcing him to change his ways. What Alison doesn’t realize — partly because he doesn’t quite either — is that Ben wouldn’t mind changing, if only he could figure out how.  At a moment of crisis Ben calls his father, a nice, tolerant guy played by Harold Ramis, for advice. “Just tell me what to do,” he begs, but no help is forthcoming. (“I’ve been divorced three times. Why are you asking me?”) The absence of a credible model of male adulthood is clearly one of the forces trapping Ben and his friends in their state of blithe immaturity.  Mr. Apatow’s critique of contemporary mores is easy to miss — it is obscured as much by geniality as by profanity — but it is nonetheless severe and directed at the young men who make up the core of this film’s likely audience. The culture of sexual entitlement and compulsive consumption encourages men to remain boys, for whom women serve as bedmates and babysitters. Resistance requires the kind of quixotic heroism Steve Carell showed in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” or a life-changing accident, like Alison’s serendipitous pregnancy.  “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up” are, primarily, movies about men, but Mr. Apatow is too smart, and too curious, to imprison the women in these films in the usual static roles of shrew, sexpot or sensible surrogate mom. Alison is not just Ben’s foil, and Mr. Apatow recognizes that her confusion and anxiety are, ultimately, far more acute and consequential than Ben’s. It’s her body and her future on the line, after all.  Ms. Heigl is allowed to be funny as well as pretty — a rarity in guy-centered comedies — as is Ms. Mann. And Debbie’s frustration in marriage is given at least as much emotional and dramatic weight as Pete’s.  I realize that much of what I have said about it makes “Knocked Up” sound like a pretty heavy picture, pregnant (sorry!) with seriousness and social significance. But since the birth of the talkies the best American movie comedies have managed to confront grave matters and to defy their own gravity.  In this case the buoyant hilarity never feels weighed down by moral earnestness, even though the film’s ethical sincerity is rarely in doubt. The writing is quick and sharp, and the jokes skitter past, vanishing almost before you can catch them. Rather than toggle back and forth, sitcom-style, between laughter and tears, Mr. Apatow lingers in his scenes long enough to show that what is funny can also be sad and vice versa.  “Knocked Up” made me smile and wince; it made me laugh and almost cry. Above all it made me happy.  “Knocked Up” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It finds abundant humor in the details — and the very existence — of the human reproductive system.

"Knocked Up" is uproarious. Line for line, minute to minute, writer-director Judd Apatow's latest effort is more explosively funny, more frequently, than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory. Indeed, even more than the filmmaker's smash-hit sleeper "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," his new pic is bound to generate repeat business among ticketbuyers who'll want to savor certain scenes and situations again and again, if only to memorize punchlines worth sharing with buddies. Currently set for a June 1 release, this hugely commercial comedy likely will remain in megaplexes throughout the summer and, possibly, into the fall.
The basic setup -- pregnant with comic potential, naturally -- is simplicity itself: Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), a contentedly underemployed slacker, meets ambitious Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a trendy Los Angeles nitery. She's feeling celebratory because of her promotion to on-camera correspondent for E! Entertainment Television; he's ready to party hearty because, well, that's his natural state of being. One thing leads to another, propelled by ample amounts of alcohol, and the mismatched strangers wind up connecting for what they assume will be a one-night stand.
A few weeks later, however, Alison discovers she is pregnant.
For Ben, a scruffy layabout who shares a disheveled home with four similarly slackerish stoners, news of his impending fatherhood comes as a rude awakening. (Until now, his primary goal has been designing a Web site listing when and where actresses appear nude in homevid movies.) 
For Alison, pregnancy initially seems like a career impediment -- it's hard to do red-carpet reports during one's third trimester -- but she's ready to accept motherhood with a little help, if not a permanent commitment, from the baby's father.
After a surprisingly smooth start, however, this unlikely bonding (which quickly evolves into a friendship with benefits) turns rocky. Alison has certain expectations -- for one thing, she'd like Ben not to get stoned quite so often -- and Ben has a few hang-ups. (During what is, hands down, the funniest sequence in an extremely funny movie, he turns squeamish while attempting sexual congress with his extremely pregnant partner.) 
It doesn't help that their less-than-encouraging role models are Alison's control-freakish sister Debbie and her discontented husband Pete (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, who, along with Rogen, also appeared in "Virgin").
Much of what happens next can be predicted by anyone who's seen a movie in which a feckless ne'er-do-well reluctantly comes of age when adult responsibility is thrust upon him (or her). What sets "Knocked Up" apart is Apatow's gift for balancing the madcap swagger and uninhibited bawdiness of a high-testosterone farce with the unabashed sweetness and romantic yearning of a chick flick. That formula, so effective in "Virgin," proves even more potent here. So much so that Apatow is able to sustain the pic for 132 minutes -- unusually long for a comedy -- with no visible strain and precious little filler. 
Apatow has a perfect-pitch ear for dialogue that is at once profanely funny, persuasively colloquial and pop-culture-aware: The characters repeatedly reference "Spider-Man 3" -- which, come summer, will be playing next door in the megaplex -- in precisely the ways one would expect them to reference it.
Apatow relies relatively little on sight gags or physical slapstick, preferring to earn his guffaws from characters revealing themselves in conversations and quarrels, bull sessions and soul-bearings. The insult-heavy interplay among Ben and his roomies (well-cast Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel and Martin Starr) recalls the hectoring give-and-take among the title character's co-workers in "Virgin." But there is much to amuse during the quieter moments as well. When Ben gets his first glimpse at Alison without her clothes, he exclaims, with equal measures of disbelief and gratitude: "You're prettier than I am."
That line -- which likely will cause a shock of recognition among many male ticketbuyers, though few would ever admit it -- is one of many Rogen adroitly employs to construct a performance that winningly underscores Ben's blunt-spoken crudity and puppy-dog sweetness. 
In his first starring role, thesp vividly conveys both the appeal and the emptiness of eternal adolescence without ever turning too grown-up to tax believability or disappoint auds. He's also a terrifically effective foil for Heigl, who brings a compelling edge to Alison's fear and befuddlement and a ferociously funny frenzy to the character's pregnancy-fueled mood swings.
Casting is spot-on from the good-sport celebs who cameo as themselves (Ryan Seacrest is fearlessly self-satirical) to fleeting bit players. Rudd makes not-so-quiet desperation even more affecting here than he did in "The Oh in Ohio," while Mann subtly reveals the aching dissatisfaction beneath Debbie's toxic snippiness. 
Slick production package enhances pic's overall entertainment value. 


A few friends of mine who've adored Judd Apatow 's Knocked Up  at early screenings have nonetheless voiced a similar complaint: There's no way pin-up-pretty Katherine Heigl  would end up with soaked-in-bongwater Seth Rogen , not even while drunk on a gallon of Everclear and stoned on a field of your finest homegrown. Which may be true; this is the geek's fantasy, after all, not the princess's.
In Apatowland, the lunch-room loner always winds up with the homecoming queen. It happened on NBC's Freaks and Geeks  , in which nebbishy Sam Weir  wound up in a spare bedroom with pom-pompushing Cindy Sanders ; it happened on Fox 's Undeclared , in which nebbishy college freshman Steven Karp  lost his virginity to the adorable Lizzy Exley ; and it certainly happened in The 40-Year-Old Virgin , in which nebbishy Asia fan Andy Stitzer  put action in his figure with hot granny Trish.
In Apatow's world, the guy, no matter how frumpy or klutzy, always gets the girl. The writer-director has replaced George Lucas  as the geek's God of Thunder by promoting the nerdling, long confined to Bionic Woman/Wonder Woman girl-on-girl make-believe, to the bedroom, where he is ready to get . . . it . . . on . By which Apatow means, of course: He's ready to grow up, accept the torturous responsibilities of adulthood, marry, raise loving, compassionate childrenand, yeah, maybe  move out of the shithole he shares with four slack-ass roomies whose idea of a night out is going to pick up the pizza after emptying Bong Jovi.
If you don't buy Apatow's premise that a woman celebrating her promotion to E! on-air correspondent would share her bed with a guy who dreams of operating a nude-celeb website, then wind up trying to get through a pregnancy with him despite the protestations of her sister in whose guesthouse she lives, there's always a gauzy Richard Curtis  romance on cable. And if you'd been paying attention to Rogen's career, you'd know that he's an engaging, warm, and real leading man who deserves to get the girl.
Rogen plays a guy named Ben Stone , who's been stoned most of his adult lifehe's living the dream, he tells his old man (Harold Ramis , genius casting). He lives with four pals, all Apatow veterans who reek of sweat and herb: Jay (Jay Baruchel ), Jason (Jason Segel ), Jonah (Jonah Hill ), and Martin (Martin Starr )and, yes, the fact that the actors share their characters' names suggests they're familiar with short-term memory loss. Together they dream of starting a website called "Flesh of the Stars" devoted to detailing the precise moment when actors shed their clothes in movies.
Heigl, free from the gloomy climes of Seattle Grace Hospital , is Alison Scott , who's been promoted from E! segment producer to on-air talent, alongside Ryan Seacrest  as a delightfully bitchy version of himself. She lives with her sister and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd )proof that one can be successful and stunted. After her promotion, she goes to a club with her sister (Leslie Mann , the real-life Mrs. Apatow) and winds up in bed with Ben; in the morning, his flabby naked ass serves as a grim reminder of the previous night's debauched misstep. Turns out, of course, he misunderstood her command to "Just do it already!" the night before and ditched the condom with which he was fumbling; hence, the gift that keeps on giving in nine months. (In Apatow's movies, men never know how to put on a condom, perhaps because they seldom have the opportunity to use one.)
What happens, of course, is inevitable: A mistake turns into an accidental relationship turns into True Love turns into heartbreak turns into happiness at last, which gives nothing away, because Apatow is not one to betray the characters he loves like family. (In many instances, they are his family: Apatow and Mann's young daughters appear in the film as Rudd and Mann's daughters.) It's the journeywhich lasts more than two hours, and feels much shorterin which the audience is meant to find delight and even a bit of melancholy, as Apatow wrings the biggest laughs from the smallest moments (a trip to the gynecologist, say, or the way Rudd ogles chairs in a Vegas hotel room) and finds absolute truths in fleeting and mundane occurrences (like when Mann's character finds her husband's been secretly skipping out on her for a fantasy-baseball draft).
Ultimately, what makes Knocked Up a terrific filmone of the year's best, easilyis its relaxed, shaggy vibe; if it feels improvised in places, that's because Apatow trusts his actors enough to let them make it up as they go, like the people they're playing. It's more than just a loose-limbed variation on About a Boy. It's a sincere meditation on adulthood, accountability, and fidelityand, yeah, getting high.
