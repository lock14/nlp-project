It�s inarguable that the accuracy of racial portrayals in American movies needs redressing. From historical visions to contemporary stories and across genres and all the various modes of cinematic expression, American filmmakers have always made movies the best way they know how, even though those ways are inevitably constrained and limited by the extent of what it is they know. Lee�s ambition to make a movie about the experiences of the African-American soldiers in World War II was exhilarating to consider since America�s most prominent African-American filmmaker would be taking on one of the most Caucasian of all movie genres: the American war movie. Sadly, Lee�s finished product, Miracle at St. Anna
, is a major disappointment, especially as it comes on the heels of the filmmaker�s greatest commercial success, Inside Man
. Miracle at St. Anna
 is a bloated, muddled, indistinct, and ill-paced movie (adapted by James McBride from his novel) that makes its 160 minutes seem like a tour of duty for the viewer. It�s a war movie and a murder mystery, a history lesson and a sentimental melodrama all jumbled together episodically and glancingly. The bulk of the movie is one long flashback about a group of four Buffalo Soldiers from the Army�s 92nd Infantry Division who get trapped in Tuscany behind enemy lines in 1944. Despite spending more than two hours in their company, these characters never develop beyond their signature traits into memorable human beings. Aubrey Stamps (Luke) is the smart, educated leader who has mixed feelings about the black man�s opportunities in America; Bishop Cummings (Ealy) is a handsome con man and ladies� man who looks after his own interests; Hector Negron (Alonso) is a Puerto Rican from Harlem who�s the unit�s radio operator and translator; and Sam Train (Miller) is an oversized man-child, a �chocolate giant� to the shell-shocked Italian child (Sciabordi) he befriends, a religiously superstitious soul who carries with him through Italy a statuary head he found on the streets of Florence. This extended flashback is bookended by a contemporary (well, 1983) murder mystery in which Turturro as a police detective and Gordon-Levitt as a hungry newspaper reporter appear fleetingly. Lee summons all his singular stylistics here and adds some touches of magic realism to his repertoire. Terence Blanchard�s melodic but strident music score frequently overwhelms the visuals and leaves little to the imagination. And for all Lee�s ballyhoo about racial stereotyping, one might expect him to adopt a less hackneyed approach to his portrayals of Italians and women. Instead of the hoped-for pinnacle of his career, Miracle at St. Anna
 has turned into an ugly skirmish along the way.


Typically with Spike Lee, you don't have to wonder what's on his mind. Earlier this year, he accused Clint Eastwood of whitewashing WWII in "Flags of Our Fathers" and "Letters From Iwo Jima," his double-sided pair of films from 2005. A lot of attention was paid to Lee's charges (where were the black soldiers?). More was paid to Eastwood's response. To paraphrase: Shut up. Then it was Lee's turn: "The man is not my father and we're not on a plantation."
Now "Miracle at St. Anna," Lee's first film about WWII and the African-American men who fought in it, will have to stand, whether or not he intends it to, as a rebuke not simply of Eastwood and Eastwood's prerogative on the war but to every movie anyone has ever made that's failed to recognize the contributions of black soldiers. I hope he rebukes again with a stronger movie.
"Miracle at St. Anna" is a Hollywood war picture that, at some variously inopportune moments, is also a bunch of other things - a police procedural, a docudrama, a courtroom drama, a nighttime soap (in broad, fraught daylight), and a small-Italian-village fable.
It's "Of Mice and Men," "Saving Private Ryan," a Roberto Benigni-less Benigni movie, and occasionally Spike Lee.
Lee seems happiest when his filmmaking can go in a dozen different directions that don't all have to meet up, although in his best movies - "Do the Right Thing," say - or in his most underrated - "Summer of Sam" - they do. This time, his film's many tones, storylines, characters, locations, and flashbacks dilute the essential momentous nature of the occasion.
As an act of storytelling, "Miracle at St. Anna" is generous to a fault. James McBride wrote the script from his novel - and he appears to have left no page unturned. Yet for an endeavor of such wide range, it feels defensively shortsighted. You know what Lee is thinking from the opening scene because he tells you. The camera rolls down a hallway in a Harlem apartment building in 1983 and up to the door, where on the other side an old man watches John Wayne on TV in "The Longest Day," that star-clogged D-Day epic from 1962. The man speaks to his television in aggravation: "We fought for this country, too."
The old man is a Puerto Rican named Hector Negron (Laz Alonso, in rubbery makeup). He works for the Postal Service, and when a face from the past walks up to his window, he blasts it with a Luger. After some rat-a-tat back-and-forth between a journalist (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a detective (John Turturro), then the discovery of a Florentine statue in Hector's house (it's of a woman's head), the movie rewinds 39 years to 1944 Italy, where scores of black soldiers, members of the US Army's segregated 92d Infantry (the Buffalo Soldiers Division) tread across a brook. The Germans are in pursuit, and their assault as well as a series of American missteps (the infantry's young white captain is a hotheaded redneck) leaves a lot of the Americans dead.
But Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller), and Hector are stranded in a beleaguered Italian villa. Its men are resistance fighters, off battling the Nazis, so at least two of the Americans are free to ogle the lusty English-speaking Italian lady, played by Valentina Cervi. (This being a Lee production, the women are a kind of bodacious jewelry.)
Sam, meanwhile, is a tall, lumpy simpleton. He think he's invisible and believes that the statue has value. He's rescued it, as well as an adorable Italian boy (Matteo Sciabordi), from being crushed to death. The child, in turn, has mistaken Sam for a mythical creature: He's "Cioccolato Gigante." I'm not sure what to make of a war movie whose most affecting relationship is between a big, foolish black man and a smart little white boy. Miller and Sciabordi are very good together, but so were Michael Clarke Duncan and that prison mouse in "The Green Mile."
Lee moves on to a grisly massacre, a climactic shootout, and his hokiest finale yet. But the fever that normally ignites his filmmaking and draws us (well, some of us) to it never catches. He was so passionate about making "Miracle at St. Anna," but why does it feel so impersonal?
There's a beautifully eerie sequence in which a lady Nazi urges, over a loudspeaker, the soldiers to surrender because they'll be treated better by Germany than they ever would be in America: "We are a warm people," the voice intones. "We have biscuits . . . just like your momma makes." It's an amazing case of racial science-fiction.
Still, the most fascinating development in this movie should be the bond between its four soldiers, who according to one belligerent flashback, were pals before being shipped to Europe. The film doesn't explore their differences. When Luke or Alonso airs a grievance or expresses a hope, he's not really talking to the actor with him in the scene, he's talking to us.
This movie is too many things without one of those things ever breaking your heart or boiling your blood. "Miracle at St. Anna" is not work of outrage or joy. It's something distressingly new for the filmmaker: a work of obligation. It feels like a movie Lee made in order to say he did it.


Spike Lee's last film, the gratifyingly tense and tricky Inside Man , was celebrated  rightly for the way that Lee finally jumped, feet first, into the studio-genre-movie game. He cooked up a gourmet-popcorn heist thriller and stamped every moment with his personality. Lee, until now, has never made a movie  good or bad  that wasn't unmistakably his. His latest, Miracle at St. Anna , is the first Hollywood feature to tell the story of the African-American soldiers who fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II , and as such it's a movie with a monumental mission. Unfortunately, that's more or less the only monumental thing about it. Miracle  isn't powerful, it's muddled and diffuse, and the disappointment of the film begins with what a hard time I had finding Spike Lee in it.
Based on a 2002 novel by James McBride, who also wrote the screenplay, the movie has a drifting, scattershot structure and no real organizing tone or style (if you wondered what Lee's frozen-figure-on-receding-background shots might look like in a wartime setting, then keep wondering). The bizarrely contrived framing device is set in the 1980s, when a postal worker named Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) mutters in anger at an old John Wayne war flick on TV, then shoots and kills a man who shows up to buy stamps. (He surely has his reasons, but does he really  get away with stashing a loaded Luger under his post-office window each day?) After his arrest, Hector won't talk, but a reporter finds a clue in the form of a priceless artifact hidden in his apartment: the head of a statue that once adorned a bridge in Florence that was wrecked by bombs during World War II.
From this labored and gimmicky setup, the film flashes back to the itch and fear of battle, as Hector, along with other members of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division and its ''Buffalo Soldiers,'' stalks the Tuscan countryside. It's September 1944, and as they try to cross the Serchio River, the men are ambushed. The sequence has thunderous explosions, jittery editing, blown-up bodies everything but the virtuosity of staging that might have made the chaos and carnage revelatory instead of just a Saving Private Ryan  rehash. Four members of the division end up stranded behind enemy lines, all but abandoned by a racist commander. In addition to Negron, there's Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), a college-educated stoic devoted to his service; Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), furious at the world and a loose cannon, with no loyalty to the country he's fighting for; and Pvt. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller), a starry-eyed oversize simpleton who rescues, and befriends, an Italian urchin (Matteo Sciabordi).
The dramatic focal point, if you can call it that, is the war of wills between Stamps and Cummings. These two play out a version of the assimilate-versus-agitate debate that has echoed through many decades of African- American life, though this one would be more convincing if Ealy, a dynamic actor, had been asked to project his anger more in period, with a little less proto-gangsta recklessness. The men arrive at a picturesque village, where they mingle with the locals and Stamps and Cummings stoke their rivalry over Renata (Valentina Cervi), a married woman who is lovely in a saintly way. The film then veers into an endless, murky subplot about the Italian resistance from which it never recovers.
Miracle at St. Anna  wants to do too many things at once to do any of them with much verve. It aspires to be a war epic, but it's dominated less by combat than by flat, meandering talk. It wants to salute the flesh-and-blood valor of the Buffalo Soldiers, but these unsung heroes are treated as such impersonally symbolic and stiff-jointed types that their heroism shines only faintly. The movie tries to be raw and real, yet it isn’t above trotting out a tyke who might have stepped out of Cinema Paradiso II  to tag along with the soldiers as a mascot of sentiment. There are vile Nazis on hand  and also a nice Nazi who does a really good deed. Miracle at St. Anna  winds up as a pastiche of racial-historical correction, showboat atrocity, murder mystery, love story, and windy meditation. Is it any wonder that it’s less than the sum of its ambitious parts? As odd as it may sound to say about a war film, though, the real trouble with Miracle  is that Lee’s filmmaking is joyless. C–

 At the beginning of “Miracle at St. Anna” an old man sits in his apartment watching a movie on his black-and-white television set. The film is “The Longest Day,” the sprawling 1962 World War II drama starring John Wayne and nearly every other white movie star of the era, and it provokes a bitter reaction. “We served our country too,” says the viewer, a postal worker and Army veteran named Hector Negron.  “Miracle at St. Anna,” directed by Spike Lee and based on a novel by James McBride, who wrote the screenplay, exists in part to make the obvious, overdue point that men like Hector (Laz Alonso) — Latino and in particular African-American soldiers — fought as bravely and as hard as the characters in those Hollywood combat epics. But setting the record straight after so many years and so many movies is not necessarily a simple undertaking, and this film sometimes stumbles under its heavy, self-imposed burden of historical significance.  Like the French director Rachid Bouchareb, whose “Days of Glory” followed Arab soldiers fighting for France against the Nazis, Mr. Lee sticks to the sturdy conventions of the infantry movie, adapting old-fashioned techniques to an unfamiliar, neglected story. And the cinematic traditionalism of “Miracle at St. Anna” is perhaps its most satisfying trait. At its best, this is a platoon picture, and if it’s not exactly like the ones Hollywood made in the late  ’50s and early  ’60s, that’s part of Mr. Lee’s argument: it’s the movie someone should have had the guts or the vision to make back then. Better late than never.  It should not be surprising that “Miracle at St. Anna” is occasionally corny and didactic. Every now and then, the action slows down to make time for a speech or a carefully staged argument about racial injustice. But if you’re tempted to roll your eyes, recall that such speeches — on the subjects of liberty and democracy and the mortal threat to those ideals posed by Hitler and his army — have always been a staple of all but the most hardboiled and cynical World War II movies. And in this one, as in “Days of Glory,” the high-minded talk and theme-announcing scenes illuminate a thorny and crucial paradox, namely that the countries fighting against totalitarian race-hatred had some serious race problems of their own.  If Mr. Lee were just advancing this thesis, “Miracle  at St. Anna” would not be as rich as it is. But it would also be shorter and more coherent. In its current form there is too much going on — five or six different movies squeezed awkwardly into a little more than two and a half hours, some enlivened by Terence Blanchard’s lush and mournful score, some drowned in it.  The opening scenes, which take place in New York in 1983, lay out a murder mystery to be unraveled in the wartime flashbacks that make up most of the movie. (To make matters even more baroque, there are flashbacks inside  these flashbacks.) One day at the post office Hector Negron shoots down a customer who has come to buy a stamp. Eager to discover why, a scoop-hungry young reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds a broken piece of statue among Negron’s belongings. This object is either the key to the whole story or one of the biggest cinematic red herrings since “The Maltese Falcon.”  This framing story, which starts as film noir and winds up flooding “Miracle at St. Anna” with sentimentality, supernaturalism and distracting cameos (from John Leguizamo, John Turturro and Kerry Washington, among others), is muddled and unconvincing. Luckily, though, the case of the headless statue does not really have much bearing on the film’s two main narrative strands, which concern the intertwined fates of a band of Italian partisans and a group of  soldiers  from the Army’s all-black 92nd Division in a Tuscan hill town in 1944.  The American soldiers, who have slipped through the German lines, are, with respect to temperament and background, at least as various as the melting-pot dogface units of the old infantry flicks. In addition to Negron, who is Puerto Rican and Roman Catholic, there is Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller), a big, gentle, superstitious  Southerner — a kind of holy innocent in hellish circumstances. His friendship with an Italian boy named Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi) is one of the film’s more improbable elements and also its sweetest.  The significant conflict within the American squad occurs between Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), who is disciplined, idealistic and forward looking, and the cynical, fatalistic Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), whose gold tooth and rough talk mark him as a streetwise foil for Stamps’s stiff-backed righteousness.  Mr. Lee has long been interested in tensions and debates among African-Americans, and in the ideological and social diversity that exists within black America. Like Mookie and Buggin’ Out in “Do the Right Thing” (or indeed like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., that movie’s uneasily twinned emblems of resistance), Stamps and Cummings represent different responses to the challenges of racism. They argue about tactics, politics and the trustworthiness of white people, and also become rivals for the favor of Renata (Valentina Cervi).  She is part of an extended family that is, in its own way, riven by political conflict, as erstwhile Fascist sympathizers share food, shelter and kinship ties with die-hard partisans. This part of “Miracle  at St. Anna,” with its themes of vengeance, treachery and honor, is a reminder of Mr. Lee’s longstanding, frequently ambivalent fascination with all things Italian, including the work of Italian and Italian-American filmmakers.  Here, an obvious debt is to Roberto Rossellini, whose “Paisan” is one of the few World War II movies from the 1940s to address the experiences of African-American G.I.’s. But “Miracle at St. Anna,” produced with Italian financing, is hardly the first Spike Lee Italian joint. It is, rather, the latest in a series of thorny intercultural love stories that stretches back to “Do the Right Thing” and through “Jungle Fever” and “Summer of Sam.”  And it is in the fragile bonds that form between the black soldiers and the Italian villagers that “Miracle at St. Anna” breaks free of its own grandiosity and tells a grounded, moving, human story. Not a miracle by any means, but an earthy inquiry into death, duty, friendship and honor. What we’ve always wanted from war movies.  “Miracle at St. Anna” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, nudity and graphic violence.  MIRACLE AT ST.

Spike Lee loses the battles and the war in �Miracle at St. Anna,� a clunky, poorly constructed drama designed to spotlight the little-remarked role of black American soldiers in World War II. Clocking in at 160 minutes, this is a sloppy stew in which the ingredients of battle action, murder mystery, little-kid sentiment and history lesson don�t mix well. Nor is it remotely clear who the audience is meant to be; the R rating pretty much rules out younger students, and extensive subtitles will deter action fans, who would be bored anyway. Best B.O. will likely be in Italy, where most of the melodrama takes place.
Pic is a particular disappointment after Lee�s reputation-restoring previous feature, �Inside Man,� which saw the director working imaginatively within an established genre. Same can�t be said here, as Lee has imposed no discipline on novelist James McBride�s script, which trudges from digression to digression to the detriment of any dramatic focus.
It remains a wonder that no one, from Lee to the various producers and studio execs, demanded that someone whip this story into more sensible shape before the cameras rolled, so obvious are its excesses and indulgences. Yarn starts with a murder case -- a sixtysomething black postal worker, a devout man and recipient of the Purple Heart, shoots a man who comes to his window to buy a stamp. News of his arrest, and the fact he is in possession of a piece of Italian statuary worth millions, has weird repercussions in Italy, whereupon the action flashes back to Tuscany, 1944, where the Yanks are putting the hard press on dug-in Nazis.
Focus falls on the Buffalo Soldiers, black soldiers within the 92nd Infantry division in the segregated American Army. A number of grunts are sent to ford a river beyond which Germans are thought to wait. The way they�re mowed down reinforces the notion that �Eleanor Roosevelt�s niggers,� as they are derided by racist white officers, are regarded as little more than cannon fodder. In one of the few successful touches, the troops� river crossing is accompanied by a propaganda broadcast from Axis Sally (Alexandra Maria Lara, in an outstanding reading), who goes on about how their country doesn�t care about them and even says the Nazis have nothing against the blacks.
Making it across the river and, shortly, up to the small medieval village of Colognora, are Second Staff Sergeant Aubrey Banks (Derek Luke); Sergeant Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy); Cpl. Hector Negron (Laz Alonso), the man charged with murder 40 years later; and PFC Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller). 
Train, a large man with little military discipline and a preoccupation with religious superstition, saves a 7-year-old boy, Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi), and thereafter watches over him. This sort of heart-tugging, and very Italian, story strand hasn�t been seen in an American war movie in years, maybe even decades, and one can see why; it�s embarrassing.
The other three guys are made of sterner stuff, but the film comes down with a case of severe lethargy once the men hole up in the village. Issues surrounding a fascist father, his lovely daughter, Renata (Valentina Cerri), whom Bishop gets the hots for, internecine quarrels among the local partisans, and the wait to figure out where the Germans are reduce the picture to the speed of a lumbering tank; two successive scenes of dreadful slaughter put the nail in the coffin. A coda blatantly attempts to pull the heartstrings, but it�s not earned.
Beyond the dramatic deficiencies, the writing for character is not good, so that even at the protracted running time, the men don�t emerge as strongly etched individuals. Train stands out because of his size and blubbery vulnerability, Stamps is notable for his courage and ability to speak Italian, and Bishop is the randy, gold-toothed one -- but fully dimensional they�re not.
Lee breaks up the slow flow by plugging in little episodes to dramatize discrimination, notably in a flashback in which German prisoners are allowed to eat in a Southern diner but black G.I.s are not. �I love Italy. I ain�t a nigger here,� one of them later says to further underline the point. Too bad the film wasn�t better written to make the sentiment implicit rather than needing to be said.
Production values are OK without being particularly notables, and Terence Blanchard�s score drones on virtually throughout. Lee�s early-career cinematographer, Ernest Dickerson, handled second-unit chores.


You've got to hand it to Spike Lee  for managing to secure the financing for this big-budget, three-hour World War II epic, performed largely in Italian and German with English subtitles, and lacking so much as a single marquee name in the cast. But as Orson Welles  wisely cautioned: The enemy of art is the absence of limitations. Adapted by James McBride  from his own novel about the African-American "buffalo soldiers" who served bravely—and largely anonymously—for the U.S. during the Second World War, Miracle at St. Anna begins with a clunky 1980s prologue, eventually flashes back to the war, and then further flashes back within those flashbacks, all to tell the ultimately slight story of four soldiers from the all-black 92nd Infantry Division who find themselves stranded behind enemy lines. There, the men rescue a young Italian boy trapped in the rubble, and take shelter with a family of chatty, gesticulating, tea-leaf-reading villagers. At which point, you may begin to wonder if Lee really initiated this project or if it only fell into his hands after Roberto Benigni  proved unavailable. The rest of the movie is piled to the rafters with cutesy-kid antics and even a mythical peasant hero named the Great Butterfly. Mostly, though, our heroes cool their heels for what must only be a few days, but feels like months.
