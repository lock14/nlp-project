While it�s not uncommon for Hollywood to completely defy the laws of probability, sometimes the absurdity of a misfire is so poignant as to demand attention. Case in point: School for Scoundrels
, a modern remake of a 1960 British satire. A film jam-packed with multitalented comedians (Cross, Silverman, Sanz, Stiller) would seem a slam-dunk opportunity for big laughs. I don�t know how they managed it, but School for Scoundrels
 is not only unfunny, it�s completely forgettable. Heder (Napoleon Dynamite)
 plays a shy and insecure meter maid named Roger. His career is essentially a one-note gag, resulting in a mild chuckle as he chugs along in his meter-mobile at 5 mph. But the chuckle quickly turns into a sigh when you realize there aren�t any good jokes coming any time soon. While Roger painfully pines for his fresh-faced neighbor, Amanda (Barrett), he lives a shadow of a life: mocked at work and incapable of keeping even his volunteer position as a Big Brother. Roger is clearly in need of a fix. Enter Thornton (Dr. P) and his extremist class for losers. Now, we�ve seen Billy Bob pull off some great performances and his turn in Bad Santa
 is inspired comedy. But in this sleepwalking turn, he clearly has no idea why he�s in this movie and is as eager to get through the experience as the audience will be. Roger enrolls in Dr. P�s supersecret confidence building class, which consists mostly of being yelled at by Thornton or harassed by his second-in-command (Duncan). Some of the supporting players provide a smile as the other class members in search of their "inner lion." But when the story escalates to a Roger vs. Dr. P battle for Amanda, the character development has been so minimal and the jokes so disappointing, it�s hard to muster an emotion or a laugh. Though Heder is mildly endearing, he should look into finding a new agent right quick. And before he�s asked to sign on for The Benchwarmers 2
. Co-writer/director Phillips, who thrives in testosterone-fueled comedy (Old School
, Road Trip)
, seems at a loss this go-around. While his previous films propelled themselves with whimsy and Will Ferrell, School for Scoundrels
 varies between taking itself seriously and not, leaving the viewer alternately confused and disappointed.


The prostrate new comedy ``School for Scoundrels" represents a waste of a perfectly good title. Directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (``Old School," ``Starsky & Hutch"), it's a remake of a 1960 British film about a sad sack who gets lessons in being a successful jerk, and it achieves something previously thought impossible: It renders Billy Bob Thornton unfunny.
The main character, Roger, is played by Jon Heder -- Napoleon Dynamite himself -- making a noble stab at a romantic lead. Hair combed out in a woebegone pageboy, jaw swinging slackly in the breeze, Roger is a New York City meter man with big dreams and no spine. He's regularly bullied into paying the tickets he writes out, and he's tongue-tied in front of his neighbor, a pretty Australian named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett of ``The Real World" and ``The Last Kiss") whose acid-tongued roommate (Sarah Silverman) immediately pegs him as a Dahmer-in-training.
Clearly, the boy needs help, so a friend and former nerd (David Cross) sends Roger to Dr. P. (Thornton), the leader of a top-secret adult education class in how to discover one's inner stud. ``I used to be like you," confides the friend, ``and now I'm dating two different Asian chicks!" It's all about the goals, obviously.
Aided by a sadistic drill sergeant named Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan), Dr. P. whips his cowering students into shape with manly mantras: ``Friends are just abstractions that stand between you and success"; ``A lion reaches out and takes what he wants"; ``Lie, lie, and lie some more."
In short order -- too 
short order -- Roger is the class's most promising pupil, which causes the good doctor's competitive afterburners to kick in. The back half of ``School for Scoundrels" is a battle semi-royal between teacher and student, with the clueless Amanda as the prize.
Now, a good, ruthless tale of male aggression -- its uses and misuses -- has potential, and if you've seen ``Bad Santa" and ``Bad News Bears" you know Thornton is the man you want leading the charge. Sadly, the movie doesn't let him get out of first gear. The editing in ``School for Scoundrels" has been keyed to tortoise Heder rather than jackrabbit Thornton, and Dr. P.'s impatient, profanity-studded maxims, hilarious as they are, never build to combustive levels. There's too much dead air, and after a while you sense Thornton's attention wander to the movie he'll be making after this one.
Heder gives it a go, and the film's failure isn't really his fault. He's too passive-aggressive for farce, though, and while Phillips fills the edges of the screen with known goofballs -- Ben Stiller as a former pupil, Luis Guzman as Roger's boss, Todd Louiso and Horatio Sanz as fellow students -- ``School for Scoundrels" is in search of a core motor that's just not there.
A nice half-twist toward the end almost saves it, with the fake-outs between Roger and Dr. P. reaching amusingly nasty levels of gamesmanship. The problem is that what they're fighting over isn't worth the energy: Barrett's Amanda is a dull sweetie utterly devoid of interest. ``School for Scoundrels" goes against common sense and even its own title: Why should Roger care about this limp noodle when he has Sarah Silverman in all her sadistic, gorgeous glory right next door?


         The comedy "School for Scoundrels," about a victimized, love-struck New York meter maid (Jon Heder of "Napoleon Dynamite") who gets tutored in jerky alpha male-ness, may not be as devilishly enjoyable as its title suggests, but it's by no means like waiting for the reprieve of an end-of-class bell, either. Loosely based on a 1960 British comedy, this is a modest education-of-a-punching-bag entertainment with a kind of breezily rude compatibility — a hallmark of sorts for both co-writer/director Todd Phillips ("Road Trip," "Starsky & Hutch") and the wonderful actor assigned to play the self-help instructor from hell, Billy Bob Thornton.
 
  Last year, audiences responded merrily to a similar comic setup in which the adventures of Steve Carell's hapless sexual neophyte led to sparkling, incisive relationship humor in "The 40 Year-Old Virgin," but this movie's intentions are more safely in the region of: laugh here, laugh here, fist pump when Heder gets his revenge, and so on.
 


         






    That's not to say there aren't pleasures when a formula works. What's almost refreshing about Phillips' approach to comedy — there's a reason he made a movie called "Old School" — is that he and co-writer Scot Armstrong like the classically unfettered fun of a silly bit played to the hilt. For example, the mealy-mouthed charges of Thornton's Dr. P getting a quick lesson in the cruelty of paintball is undeniably funny, as is the crosscutting montage showing Roger (Heder) and classmates in their everyday lives working up the nerve to pick insanely self-destructive fights with bullies and thugs.
 
  Needless to say, personality breakdown is inevitably more amusing than the confidence-building a happy ending requires, which means Thornton's villainous drill sergeant is the film's real laugh weapon. Heder's Ichabod Crane shtick may make him Hollywood's favorite new point-and-laugh target, but it's the "Sling Blade" actor's emergence in recent years as a comedy star, playing hilariously brittle, insult-wielding satyrs in sardonic corkers such as "Bad Santa" and "The Bad News Bears" that's become the real master seminar in scoundrel-hood. In a Heder/Thornton matchup, you're not altogether sure you want to see teach lose.

There's a good possibility Jon Heder would have found a Hollywood career playing sweet, mouth-breathing dorks in slacker comedies even if he hadn't rocketed to dorkdom fame as Napoleon Dynamite  who knows? As it is, he's trapped within his comfort zone in School for Scoundrels , loosely adapted from a similarly named, very British 1960 romp of twits starring Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael. Squaring off against Billy Bob Thornton, who's in his comfort zone as a sharky, scamming SOB, Heder leads with his trademark toothy expression of clueless stupor as Roger, a meek loser with a crush on Jacinda Barrett's Amanda, the pretty girl in the apartment next door. (Anyone cooler would prefer Amanda's witheringly funny roommate, played by Sarah Silverman.) For lessons in getting the ladies (as well as taking down life's bullies), he takes an underground course from Thornton's shady “Dr. P.” And the lessons work so well that Roger starts to score, kicking in Dr. P's own Bad News Bad Santa competitive side. The clash of comedic styles, meanwhile, dulls Thornton's edge (he can't be mean to such a nebbish and seem fair), while Heder, in his first Hollywood leading role, stalls Roger's energy level as if leery of changing lanes. Director Todd Phillips tries for the kind of frat slaphappiness he applied so successfully to Old School , but these boys are less scoundrels than individual salesmen for the brands of Heder and Thornton.

 As an actor Billy Bob Thornton can do just about anything. If his Southern accent generally rules out roles like Fagin or Prince Hal, his delectable  leer suggests that  he might have made a more plausible Marquis de Sade than Geoffrey Rush some years back. That leer is much in evidence in the shoddy comedy “School for Scoundrels,” though the tackiness of the film, its lazy direction (from Todd Phillips, who did incomparably better with “Old School”) and its self-satisfied stupidity may mean that Mr. Thornton curled his lip about the production rather than for it. Whatever the case, this actor’s estimable talents are squandered here in a role to which he nevertheless brings a little customary oomph.  Part lifestyle coach and 100 percent huckster, Mr. Thornton’s character, Dr. P., the alpha scoundrel,  runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort often played by the other lead actor, Jon Heder. As Roger, a New York parking enforcement officer whom other men, with the usual panic about gender endemic to bonehead comedies, insist on calling a meter maid, Mr. Heder doesn’t lean as heavily on geek-shtick as he did in “Napoleon Dynamite.”  Yet if Mr. Heder has graduated from playing clowns who eat their own snot, as he did in “The Benchwarmers,” and now has a decent haircut, he has a ways to go before he can pass as the kind of guy who can win the affections of the pretty Australian next door (Jacinda Barrett). No matter. Roger gets the girl; we get this lousy movie.  “School for Scoundrels” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some crude language.

Not even the mighty presence of Billy Bob Thornton can stir "School for Scoundrels" to life as a provocative comedy of manners, or just plain comedy. Given its premise -- an adult school teacher attempting to remake wimpy men into fearsome macho studs -- pic seemed certain to either fly high on outrageous humor or crash under the weight of tastelessness. Instead, the movie just sits there and never comes alive. Star Jon Heder's "Napoleon Dynamite" fan club is likely to text-message the guys to stay away, leaving distrib MGM with weak fall earnings. 
Anyone who knows the source material -- the 1959 Robert Hamer, Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas comedy of the same title, but with a kinder disposition -- is too gray to qualify for this film's target aud, so it's strange an old pic should be the basis for a high-concept 2006 laffer aimed at young guys.
Despite his hyphenate status, director-producer-co-scribe Todd Phillips ("Old School") does not appear to be engaged with the story and characters, which may partly explain why Heder and Thornton's characters come off as so lackluster. Like its spineless males, pic has lost its nerve to challenge aud assumptions of what it means to be a man -- presumably the whole point of the exercise.
Parking meter cop Roger (Heder) is an open target for ridicule, either from gangbangers stealing his cherished sneakers or co-workers harassing him. The latest is a group of kids who have rejected him as a Big Brother.
A pile of self-help books at home (the movie's opening, obvious image) is no help at all. Clearly, trying to snuggle up to cute Aussie neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) is out of the question.
Taking advice from his Big Brother coordinator Ian (David Cross), Roger signs up for an adult ed class on confidence-boosting taught by Billy Bob's Dr. P, with Michael Clarke Duncan's Lesher as his intimidating bodyguard.
Dr. P tells his class that they're not even worthy of the status of "loser," since losers at least try, and that in order to regain any sense of manhood, they must find their inner lion. (References to the MGM Leo logo at the pic's header are up to viewer interpretation.)
Less a drill instructor than an unsmiling guy with preening arrogance, Dr. P sends his students into the woods for a paintball game, which includes Lesher having his way (off-screen in this ostensibly PG-13 comedy) with three lowly students --Eli (Todd Louiso), Diego (Horatio Sanz) and Walsh (Matt Walsh) --and Roger showing his first signs of manliness.
Thinking he's won Dr. P's favor, Roger fails to grasp that he's now his mentor's target: P woos Amanda, whom Roger is finally trying to date. In turn (and in one of pic's bits that indirectly quote from the Brit original), Roger turns a tennis game into a chance to pummel P with some balls. It's war, but because things are so languidly paced by Phillips and no truly funny set pieces emerge, this is the comedy equivalent of low-grade combat.
The further he gets away from his toothy/bushy-haired "Napoleon Dynamite" figure, the less amusing Heder manages to be. But he's not alone. "School" assembles a knockout lineup of comic talent, starting with comic genius Thornton, and unfortunately does not provide them with funny material to work with. Only Ben Stiller, who arrives late to the game as a former shell-shocked pupil of Dr. P, has the opportunity to actually build an indelible character with an amusing core.
There's something to be grateful for, at least, in Christophe Beck's score and its ironically amped-up use of military motifs, while the rest of the production credits are merely standard-issue. Though set in New York, pic jarringly inserts blatant Los Angeles locales, including several in the nearby mountains.


The latest from Old School  director Todd Phillips  updates the 1960 original (which was based on Stephen Potter 's series of how-to-get-ahead novels) about a man of little confidence who enrolls in a class he believes will teach him self- reliance; it's Bad Santa meets Napoleon Dynamite , quite literally. The latter, Jon Heder , plays a New York City parking- enforcement officer named Roger, a kindly simpleton who wears kiddie pajamas and mumbles whenever he's in the presence of the woman down the hall with whom he's infatuated (Jacinda Barrett ). A friend suggests Roger enroll in a class taught by a mysteriously monikered Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton ); in it are other neutered men-children who live with their grandmothers. But Barrett's character is the macguffin with as much charisma as a McMuffin; she's just there to bring together and yank apart Roger and Dr. P, who spend the film's final half fucking with each other until the inevitable scream of "Uncle!" Their shenanigans, though, are never terribly nasty; Phillips at least has that much in common with the first man to direct School  in 1960, Robert Hameran affinity for restraint in the drawing of blood. Thornton, who found his nasty niche in Bad Santa  only to seem terribly lost in Bad News Bears , doesn't repeat himself here. Dr. P is a classy, cool brand of vilethe demented drill sergeant in a designer suit. And Heder, cast in the role of the invisible man, is fine too. The movie wouldn't work without someone as nondescript as Heder, because you can buy him as a do-nothing, go-nowhere man; he's perfectly, wonderfully forgettable, appropriate for a movie like this.
