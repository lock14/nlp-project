I have seen the future, and it looks like TBS. Maybe TNT. I predict a happy union between 27 Dresses
 and cable TV, forever rerunning with commercial breaks tailor-made for laundry-loading and sandwich-making. It�s a better fit for this run-of-the-mill romantic comedy about Jane (Knocked Up
�s Heigl), always a bridesmaid, never a � well, you know the drill. Those 27 dresses mark the time Jane has spent, as one character puts it, in the taffeta ghetto of bridesmaidery. Lucky for her, she eats it up � saves every dress, clips her favorite wedding announcements from the paper, even knows where and how and to whom she intends to inflict her imaginary nuptials. The lucky man � or not � is her boss, George (Burns, forever toady); unluckily for her, he falls in record time for her glamorous younger sister (Akerman). Jane is stuck planning their wedding while simultaneously dodging the dogged attentions of Kevin (Marsden), a cynical journalist covering the wedding beat but angling for more ambitious work. Heigl anchors the film with all the spaz-tastic charm she brings to (the increasingly ludicrous) Grey�s Anatomy
, although one hopes her feature film career holds a role less priggish in the future. But the real star-making turn here belongs to Marsden, an unsung actor who�s played the Bellamy before (you know, the nice guy the girl has to go through to get to the real deal), gallantly stepping aside in favor of X-Men
�s Wolverine and Ryan Gosling�s sexy beast in The Notebook
. Here, as a mixed-drink of frat boy and existential downer (or is it tall drink of water?), he reminded me of what Anthony Lane once said about Before Sunrise
-era Julie Delpy, that she served as �a stern reminder that the first duty of a film critic � the sole qualification, to be honest � is to fall regularly, and pointlessly, in love with the people onscreen.� Marsden, with his easy smile and architecturally sound cheekbones, might be a wee obvious choice, but whatever it takes to pass the time � and 27 Dresses
 certainly has time to kill. The jokes hit about half the time � the best bits have an off-the-cuff feel � and it�s pocked with the kind of rom-com clich�s that are practically written in stone (screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna's script for The Devil Wears Prada
 was far sharper). There�s the well-worn, improbable group sing-along, albeit this one, hinging on Elton John-inspired malapropisms, is pretty cute � and what validation to know others have mistaken Bennie�s electric boots for electric boobs. Less winning is a last-act, uncomfortably public declaration of love, which has me wondering: How come whenever I
 have something really important to say, there�s never a mic and an adoring crowd around to twitter, then applaud?


Katherine Heigl plays for keeps in uneven comedy
Katherine Heigl is who Charlize Theron wants to be when she dresses down. That's not a comment on Heigl's talent (we still don't know if she's any kind of actress) or on Theron's, for that matter (we know she is). But Heigl has the normal good looks that Theron descends from Olympus to pull off when she's playing deathly San Franciscans or sexually harassed miners. Heigl is not a goddess. She's very appealing but not chic or cool, which for so-so romantic comedies is an advantage. She isn't slumming, so you believe in her.
Heigl has a regular part on TV's "Grey's Anatomy," and her first movie since playing Seth Rogen's baby mama in "Knocked Up" is "27 Dresses," a sporadically entertaining cupcake of a movie. She plays Jane, a perennial bridesmaid/matron of honor (27 times!) who openly longs for a wedding of her own. Jane is practical, responsible, and a bit single-minded. When she gets her Sunday paper, she skips right past the other sections and goes straight to the Vows department. That's her idea of news.
The first batch of scenes is a giddy whirlwind. Jane is somehow serving in two concurrent ceremonies, and she hires a taxi to shuttle her between them. The movie conflates the two, cutting back and forth as if the separate events were one, with Michael Jackson's "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" holding it all together. We see the blissfully banal rituals (the YMCA, the electric slide, the speeches, the brides who need their dresses held while they go to the bathroom.) Heigl is at the center of the madness, smiling, stressing, rolling her eyes. This is fun. It's almost as well engineered a sequence as that montage in "Wedding Crashers" where Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson drink, dance, and score.
But "27 Dresses" is determined to go downhill from there. It promptly becomes a plain old romantic comedy. The movie makes way for Jane's sister, Tess (Malin Akerman), an azure-eyed blond who, predictably enough, is a nincompoop, to steal the man Jane loves but hasn't told. It's George (Edward Burns), her boss. Soon George and Tess are engaged, and guess who's planning the wedding. Meanwhile, Jane is being hounded by Kevin (James Marsden), the cute newspaper reporter on the weddings beat. He hates his job and figures Jane's life as a bridesmaid would make for the sort of feature that could catapult him out of the "taffeta ghetto." Of course, Kevin is secretly writing about her while pretending to cover Tess's wedding. The movie is as overwritten as it sounds.
Heigl and Marsden are good together, nonetheless - never more so than when they drunkenly belt out "Bennie and the Jets" atop a bar. He's got an interesting face - all sharp, small features. It's like a caricature of movie-star handsomeness. In "Enchanted," you buy him as a joke on Prince Charming, but you'd never buy him as the prince himself. That is, of course, his romantic appeal: He comes in under the radar.
The movie has a number of good, tough scenes, a few of which are at Jane's expense. In one, she walks into a restaurant and the waiters unfurl a banner that says "Will you marry me?," some musicians start playing that insipid romantic restaurant music, and she almost dies. When George tells them to stop -"She's not the one. She's not the one." - Jane almost dies again. You feel for her. And then you don't. Who could so desperately love a man as dull as Edward Burns? His dreaminess is like a studio backdrop. You pull away the gorgeous imagery, and there's a wall.
There's a decent movie in here somewhere. Sometimes it's just vulgar enough, thanks in large part to Judy Greer, who, as Jane's randy best friend, is the Thelma Ritter of this operation. But the director, Anne Fletcher, and the screenwriter, Aline Brosh McKenna, who did such a smart job adapting "The Devil Wears Prada," have made a ditsy single-chick movie with the alluring geometry of a screwball comedy. The movie's kiss of death comes when Jane tries on the 27 dresses for Kevin in the sort of exasperatingly cute montage that Raven-Symoné and Miley Cyrus seem way too old to try. Who exactly is this movie for?


Even before you've seen her, you know her. Jane (Katherine Heigl) is the perennial sad singleton, lonely but eternally hopeful. She's in love with her boss (Ed Burns), who treats her like the world's most lovingly cared-for doormat, and she has been an eager and devoted bridesmaid 27 times, with her leftover dresses  in all their fruit-hued, puffy-sashed, prom-discard plumage  lined up in the closet to prove it. You already know him, too. Kevin (James Marsden) is the jaunty solo male, unlassoed by love, who somehow manages to pen the tenderhearted ''Commitments'' column in the Sunday wedding section of the New York Journal . Staring him in the eye, she asks: Does he really feel all those warm, sincere, special-day sentiments? Or is he just a cynic spooning out ''romantic crap'' for women like her?
That's a question you could well ask the people who concocted 27 Dresses : screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, who previously wrote the hit screen adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada , and director Anne Fletcher, a veteran choreographer who turned filmmaker with Step Up  (2006). It's not that their movie is cynical; it's that all the chick-flick trappings  the fashion, the wedding chitchat, the masochistic one-way crush  drive the story rather than the other way around. 27 Dresses  is a movie geared to a pitch of high matrimonial-princess fever. It's white-lace porn for girls of every age, and the way that it revelsin that get-me-to-the-altar mood, to the point of making anyone who isn't  getting married feel like a loser, is the picture's key selling point.
McKenna and Fletcher, at moments, give good romantic fluff, and they offer a few tweaks  though not enough  of the poshly retro-traditional multibillion-dollar wedding industry. There are also winning performers on screen, like Katherine Heigl, who knows how to glow right through her professional-woman composure. She soft-pedals her sexiness with just the right touch of exasperation. Heigl, amid the friendly mishegoss  of Knocked Up , signified as a nearly generic shiksa goddess, but really, she's a far more exotic actress than that. Her face is all ovals and darting eyes  she's got some of the nervous, high-strung sensuality of the young Kathleen Turner  and she makes Jane a live presence, even if it's a bit much to ask us to believe that a woman this attractive could be this nerdishly self-sacrificing a sop.
And yet, merely by writing that line, I have revealed how completely removed I am from the target audience for this movie. As far as they're concerned, if 27 Dresses  were ''better,'' it probably wouldn't be as good. It wouldn't have that guilty-pleasure, how-I-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cheese frisson that has become the defining spirit of the 21st-century chick flick. McKenna's script melts together a couple of cookie-cutter plots. In the first, Jane's dim-bulb, duplicitous, baby-doll sister, the platinum bimbo Tess (Malin Akerman), snares the boss that Jane has spent years adoringly stepping and fetching for. Will Tess now get to enjoy the perfect Central Park Boathouse nuptials  in Mom's old wedding dress!  that Jane always longed for? Meanwhile, Jane sets off a few damp, sputtering sparks with Kevin, who is planning to write a splashy Sunday feature on her existence as the ultimate bridesmaid. But she, poor dear, has no clue that he's even doing a story! James Marsden, so foppishly funny as the fairy-kingdom prince in Enchanted ,lathers on the charm here like too much aftershave. His Kevin is so gauntly male-modelish and smug, he's like the screwball hero as gigolo.
It's hard to imagine a set of complications more routine, but the way that this tiered cake of a farce has been staged, you can practically lick the white frosting off of the plot. Even the satire of the wedding industry plays like a backhanded endorsement of it. There is, of course, a trying-on-clothes montage, though this one has a rare dash of wit: It's Jane modeling all her bridesmaid's dresses (which, according to the film, are meant to look bad, so that they don't show up the bride), as the movie flashes back to the weddings in which she wore them. There's also an intentionally cringe-worthy (though maybe not this  much) duet between Jane and Kevin, who take refuge at a bar following an auto mishap. Drunk on whiskey, the two sing along with ''Bennie and the Jets,'' getting down with their bad selves in their most impassioned, white-person fervor, which inspires the entire bar to join in. Love means never having to say you're sorry for acting like an idiot. Or for tying yourself in knots in order to tie the knot.

 At the beginning of “27 Dresses,” Jane (Katherine Heigl), a serial bridesmaid with an almost pathological devotion to other people’s nuptials, spends a long night shuttling between two weddings. One is in Midtown Manhattan, the other in Brooklyn; one has an upper-crusty, white-bread look, while the other appears to be a Jewish-Hindu intermarriage. But as the director, Anne Fletcher, methodically cuts back and forth between them, she makes the reasonably insightful, moderately funny point that modern American weddings, however they may strain for individuality and specialness, are all pretty much alike.  The problem is that much the same could be said about modern American romantic comedies. There is a touch of idiosyncrasy here and there — in this one the heroine’s dad is a widower who owns a hardware store! — but most of the elements might as well have been pulled off the registry list at a high-end chain store.  The template is something like this: A career woman who lives in a bright and perky city (though usually not the one in which it was filmed; most of this  Manhattan is actually Providence, R.I.) takes a bit under two hours to make it to the altar with (or at least be stopped at the airport by) the Right Guy, who had seemed at first to be the Wrong Guy. Earlier, the Wrong Guy had seemed to be the Right Guy.  For ease of reference let’s call the one the heroine ends up with the Right Wrong Guy and the one she rejects the Wrong Right Guy. In the case of “27 Dresses” the Right Wrong Guy is James Marsden, who recently played the Wrong Right Guy in “Enchanted,” while the Wrong Right Guy is Edward Burns, who gets to be the Right Wrong Guy mostly in movies he writes and directs himself.  The best thing about “27 Dresses,” which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (whose script adaptation of “The Devil Wears Prada” was far more witty and interesting), is that the Guys are not really the point. Or rather, if getting the Right one is the point of the story (see above), the spark of comedy is carried by the women in the picture.  Too bad it’s such a dim spark. Ms. Heigl, the blossoming babymama in “Knocked Up,” has an impressive gift for mugging. Her eyebrows shoot up and scrunch  downward with amazing precision, and her mouth contorts itself amusingly when she says things like “gewurztraminer,” “hot hate sex” and “I’m Jesus.”  Which may make the movie sound more interesting than it is. To allay that impression, let me just note that the big comic-romantic set piece comes when Jane and the Right Wrong Guy get drunk at a suburban roadhouse and sing “Benny and the Jets” while dancing on the bar. At least it wasn’t “Y.M.C.A.” or “I Got You (I Feel Good),” but still.  Back at the office Jane has the requisite slutty/flaky best friend, who at least is played by the irrepressible Judy Greer (“13 Going on 30”). Jane’s sister, Tess — her rival, as it happens, for the love of the Wrong Right Guy — is Malin Akerman, who was the only remotely funny thing about “The Heartbreak Kid,” in which she played the Wrong Right Girl.  Why Ms. Fletcher and Ms. McKenna couldn’t have supplied these three funny, charming women with a funny, charming movie is something of a puzzle. Or maybe it isn’t, since their task seems to have been to produce a movie that wouldn’t make all the other movies exactly like it too envious.  Ms. Heigl certainly works hard to convince the audience of the existence of a universe in which she could be the dowdier, shyer member of a pair of sisters. The costume designer, Catherine Marie Thomas, worked at least as hard to find a dress (out of the 27 in the title) that might make Ms. Heigl look less than gorgeous. A futile effort, like most of the rest of the movie, or the attempt to find anything else to say about it.  “27 Dresses” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual situations and some mild swearing.

Frothy, funny and formulaic, �27 Dresses� is a pleasantly predictable romantic comedy that sees Katherine Heigl following �Knocked Up� with smooth moves at the wheel of her first starring vehicle. Set to open Jan. 11, pic could prove a potent draw for femme ticketbuyers, dating couples and any �Grey�s Anatomy� fan who wants to see series regular Heigl in something other than a rerun.
An engaging actress with a flair for physical comedy and self-effacing humor, Heigl is immensely appealing as Jane Nichols, an ever-helpful people-pleaser whose biopic could be titled �The Runaround Bridesmaid.� 
Ever since her childhood, when she started serving as surrogate mom to her younger sister following their mother�s demise, Jane has been a tireless provider of support and assistance for all in her orbit. Her chronic selflessness and attentiveness to detail have made her the perfect bridesmaid for her friends � more than two dozen of them, actually � and an invaluable assistant for George (Edward Burns), a clothing and outdoor-equipment mogul who�s blissfully oblivious to his employee�s infatuation.
Jane�s avocation as a bride�s best friend attracts the attention of Kevin (James Marsden), a cynical reporter who�s rather improbably employed (and even more improbably accomplished) as the author of a popular �Weddings� newspaper column. Unfortunately, Kevin has something new to write about when Tess (Malin Akerman), Jane�s sexy, self-absorbed sibling, attracts the attention of George, who�s so smitten he proposes before really getting to know his intended. Guess whom Tess asks to be her bridesmaid? 
�27 Dresses� is a romantic comedy in which nothing the least bit surprising occurs, no disagreement or estrangement seems sufficiently serious to persist, and no one behaves in a manner that cannot be predicted by anyone who has seen more than two or three other romantic comedies. 
But it helps that scripter Aline Brosh McKenna (�The Devil Wears Prada�) has provided some very amusing wisecracks for co-star Judy Greer, whose dry wit and spirited sauciness as Jane�s best buddy suggest a younger, sexier Maggie Smith. It also helps that choreographer-turned-helmer Anne Fletcher (�Step Up�) often finds fresh approaches to handling familiar scenes: When Jane and Kevin reach that inevitable point in their attracted-opposites relationship when they�re ready to unwind, Fletcher puts them through amusing paces in a drunken sing-along scene that makes better use of Elton John�s �Benny and the Jets� than any pic since �Aloha, Bobby and Rose.�
Whether she�s neatly balancing hilarity and heartbreak while stifling her unrequited love for George, or doing the bickering Beatrice-and-Benedict bit with a well-cast Marsden, Heigl effortlessly radiates the kind of charisma that can make auds fall in love with a character (and, of course, the actress who plays her). Akerman, Burns and Brian Kerwin (as the widowed father of Jane and Tess) are thoroughly pro but serve as little more than plot devices and/or window dressing.
Costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas deserves special credit for creating the titular 27 bridesmaid dresses � dutifully preserved in Jane�s cramped closet � that range from gothic to cowgirlish, from too revealingly slight to eye-stingingly garish. The outfits reinforce aud�s overall impression of Jane: She must be a really, really good friend if she�s willing to wear outfits like these.

A forgettable, formulaic comedy so predictable that seeing it and skipping it are the exact same thing. Fox sneak-previewed the movie during the holidays, between the Christmas buzz and New Year's hangover. Only, like everything else consumed and digested during that time period, 27 Dresses  was little more than empty, leaden, stomach-aching calories all but already forgotten; and it starred ... ? Oh, yes, waitKatherine Heigl , right. She's plain Jane, the bridesmaid who's never the bride, in love with her sportswear-making boss (Ed Burns , seemingly in every bad movie this January), who only has eyes for Jane's sister Tess (Malin Akerman ). Through circumstances slight and silly, Jane meets Kevin (James Marsden , still singing), a wedding columnist for a New York Times   knock-off who's as creepy as he is charming: The guy is one Post-It note away from stalking, though movies like this play that kind of boorish behavior as lovey-dovey cute. Ultimately, Jane betrays Tess, Kevin betrays Jane, everything falls apart until everyone comes togetherand if you think that's spoiling anything, you should see your first movie in the near future.
