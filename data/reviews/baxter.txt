On the one hand, Elliot Sherman (Michael Showalter), the pudding-headed accountant who defines ''Baxter'' as a guy (particularly in classic romance movies) who occupies the losing corner of any love triangle, is seen sharing a bed with his fiancée, Caroline Swann. And she's a catch, a chic blondie (played with comic cool by Elizabeth Banks) who evidently gives him the time of night as well as of day. On the other hand, the two kiss as chastely as siblings. So whether Elliot  who gets dumped when Caroline's hot old beau, Bradley Lake (Justin Theroux), reappears  qualifies for the 40-Year-Old Virgin Club is unclear.
Anyhow, sex doesn't figure into The Baxter , Showalter's strained romantic comedy; exaggerated arrested development does, of a guy kind that congratulates adult men on their dweebishness, assuming that dweebishness is of the hipster Brooklyn variety. The writer-director-star, who's also a third of the comic trio Stella , declares in voice-over narration that he's standing up for nice, dumped guys everywhere. He's encouraging them to be themselves because somewhere out there is a gal, a Baxterette, who's as kind and patient and adorable as Michelle Williams is, playing an office temp/singer who loves Elliot as a first choice, not a second.
So is this what nice, dumped guys everywhere are like? Nerds, dweebs, losers humiliated by chic blondies? Sheesh, tough crowd, those Brooklyn hipsters. Fellow Stellans Michael Ian Black and David Wain drop by as mouth breathers, while The Station Agent 's Peter Dinklage provides diversion as a gay wedding planner who was probably rooting for Caroline to run off with Bradley all along: Then she'd be Mrs. Swann-Lake.

 A Baxter, in the lingo of the new romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who gets left at the altar when the hero shows up, like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," to claim his true love. In "The Baxter," Mr. Showalter plays Elliot Sherman, a dull but good-hearted accountant who can't believe his luck when he manages to land a beautiful magazine editor named Caroline Swann (Elizabeth Banks). He quickly proposes marriage, but when Bradley (Justin Theroux), Caroline's annoyingly perfect ex-boyfriend, shows up by surprise at her engagement party, Elliot must watch as his best chance at happiness is stolen from under his nose. Meanwhile, Elliot's friendship with a bedraggled waif of an office temp named Cecil (Michelle Williams) is developing into a full-fledged flirtation.  The tragic flaw of "The Baxter" is that Mr. Showalter is miscast - or has miscast himself - in the title role. Though his writing is sharp and at times quite funny, and his direction at least reasonably assured, Mr. Showalter seems fundamentally uncomfortable in the role of leading man. He has the broad gestures and goofy grimaces of a sketch comic:  an awkwardness that at its best, lends the benighted Elliot a kind of poignancy and, at its worst, simply makes him seem like a visitor from another movie.  Ms. Williams, an actress with an open, childlike face that recalls the young Shirley MacLaine, is luminescent as Cecil, but the performance of the film belongs to Mr. Theroux (recently seen in a recurring role on "Six Feet Under"). Besides being wealthy, successful and handsome, Bradley can break-dance, quote Keats and weep on cue. Yet Mr. Theroux manages to calibrate the character so precisely that Bradley remains a real human being behind the smarm.  Peter Dinklage is thrown away in a minor role as a gay wedding planner, while David Wain and Michael Ian Black, Mr. Showalter's partners in the sketch comedy team Stella, appear in supporting roles as Elliot's quirky friends. In the end, "The Baxter" is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet.  "The Baxter" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language, but no violence or sexual situations.

Aggressively pushing the envelope of "loser comedy" -- i.e.� films whose fans would prefer to laugh at, rather than with, their stars -- Michael Showalter's "The Baxter" may find a following among those who stand in awe of the names Sandler, Ferrell and Spade. But Showalter pushes too far: Nerdiness, after all, can be only so attractive.The title says it all: A "baxter," according to Elliot Sherman's grandmother, is the guy who never gets the girl, who either has soup spilled on him or spills the soup.
Her grandson (Showalter) might as well have "baxter" tattooed on his forehead. How Elliot finally gets the girl -- or, rather, a
 girl -- is the narrative objective of "The Baxter," which wends its way awkwardly and embarrassingly through various humiliations and social faux pas before arriving at the door to love, whose hinges need oil.
Helmer Showalter bravely defies 5,000 years of theatrical tradition and tries to make the most physically unattractive and socially inept character in his movie the object of viewers' affection. But Showalter ends up showing why such a tactic doesn't work. And never did. Chaplin, Keaton, and even Arbuckle played characters who were economically or physically underprivileged, but they had the cleverness to surmount life's obstacles, however briefly. When Woody Allen played a loser, he was always intellectually superior to those around him. There are bright spots in the film, notably Peter Dinklage, who is hilarious as a catty gay wedding planner, and Michelle Williams, whose Cecil Mills is charmingly awkward. One roots for Cecil, partly because there's nobody else. But also because she's adorable.
It was probably a mistake for Showalter to start the movie with a wedding and then flash back -- eliminating anything unexpected. But "The Baxter" aspires to low-key, and it achieves that goal in spades.

Michael Showalter 's directorial debut is an immodestly refreshing crash course in modesty. CPA Elliot Sherman (Showalter) is the self-described "Baxter"one of those "old-fashioned" chaps, all tweed and punctilio, whose filmic fate is to get thrown over by the girl as she navigates a course for her one true love. The damsel in question is fashion mageditrix Caroline Swann  (Elizabeth Banks ), whose appearance in Elliot's office kicks off a whirlwind romance, albeit a whirlwind so chastely spun that the raciest glimpse is of the two of them reading contentedly in bed.
"Caroline and I began courting exclusively," Elliot notes with prim satisfaction, but as their nuptials approach, he's hit by a blast from her past: Bradley (Justin Theroux ), Caroline's high school sweetheart, reappears, a worldly adventurer-millionaire (he's made his fortune in . . . geodes) who instantly dazzles everyone he meets. Distraught, Elliot connects with a dewy temp named Cecil Mills  (Michelle Williams ), a Minnesota transplant whose dreams of chanteuse glory are kept in check by a bad case of stage fright.
A sign of The Baxter 's charm is that it's essentially spoiler-proof: We know from the get-go which couples will pair off, and the pleasures lie in the spring-stepped vibe, the natty throwback wardrobe, and the intricate goofball patter. (The film's also a gentle valentine to Brooklyn , with enough digs to satisfy even those immune to the borough's charms.) Showalter's a Stella  star and State 's-man, but happily The Baxter  never feels like a string of sketches. There are occasional, successful forays into physical comedya zippy hide-the-girl scene, Bradley's ludicrous breakdancing demonstrationbut the stress is less on comic flagellation (what's come to be the standby of the Ferrell-Stiller axis) than on verbal dexterity and potent whimsy. Despite a wedding crash, The Baxter  nods to better-behaved comedies of the past. Fittingly, time is unstable: At numerous points, Showalter leapfrogs crucial scenes, only to track back and fill in the details, giving the film a surface vigor.
Elliot's voiceboth in narration and dialogueis as idiosyncratic as it is perfectly pitched. With traces of a lisp, he's ever on the verge of petulance, yet manages to elicit sympathy for his second-lead status. He thinks Cecil sings like an angeland then compares her to "a purple sandpiper or red-breasted grosbeak," and the precision in those syllables is priceless.
The Baxter  has a high huggability quotient, but the points of the central love triangle are pricklier than one might expect. Elliot's button-down mind values compromise, safety, and the paid vacation, and can't abide any disruption of the status quo; blue-eyed blue blood Caroline alternates smiles with hissy fits; Bradley is moody and manipulative (or is it that his moodiness is manipulative?). If Caroline and Bradley are ultimately caricatures who deserve each other, at least they're fun to watch. Theroux steals every scene he's in, exuding globe-trotting machismo (last known residence: Lillehammer ), salt-of-the-earth appeal (he spearheads an inscrutable drinking game), and a precisely deployed sensitivity (he spouts a phrase from Keatsthen cites it). Only a true Baxter would let his rival hog the best lines.
