Let�s get past the initial hurdle of accepting a movie that�s based on a line of dolls. (This is
 the season of Transformers
, isn�t it?) These dolls seem to be the epitome of everything today�s tween gal aspires toward: They�re vulgar, oversexualized clotheshorses who irritate their elders. In this live-action film, multicultural BFFs Yasmin (Ramos), Jade (Parrish), Sasha (Browning), and Cloe (Shaye) are actually rather sweet, though their �passion for fashion� is unabated. The film opens on the girls� first day of high school, as they wake to their alarm clocks in their individual bedrooms and visually link up over their computers to discuss the day�s attire. (They then fish out the items from their walk-in closets. No, I�m not jealous.) The film nicely incorporates modern-day computer artifacts into the plot, as when mean girl Meredith (Staub) carries a tiny flashdrive as a weapon. Meredith is the school�s top dog, and her goal is to divide the student population into smaller packs. And though the Bratz give voice to lofty sentiments, such as �friendship is a big deal,� a quick dissolve to junior year shows that the four friends have drifted apart, having become divided and separated by the school�s governing cliques. Their �bratitude� emerges, however, and they fight back against the cliques and their ringleader Meredith and her proud papa (Voight), who is also the principal of the school. (Voight�s shameless participation in this project could be a whole topic unto itself: the bottoming-out of Oscar winners.) At 110 minutes (including a music video over the closing credits), Bratz
 is way too long. Yet the full house of tweeners at the screening I attended would probably disagree heartily. I didn�t know I had bratitude before seeing this movie, but � there it is. For all the film�s platitudes about friendship and setting one�s inner voice free, it also supports the coolness of consumer culture and material worth. Still, there�s a filmmaking spark here that riffs on things like imagery from Moulin Rouge
 and Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western music. So, in the end, Bratz
 and I won�t be BFF, but we can coexist until the next gal-pal film comes along.


If you ever wanted a movie to put in the time capsule so future generations can puzzle over the bankruptcy of our current kiddie culture, "Bratz" is it. A live-action film based on a line of dolls, it's pure marketing chum for tweeners: a proudly shallow, purposefully bland ode to girly-girl narcissism. I could actually feel my brain stem shrivel up as I watched it.
The Bratz dolls have caused some concern over the past few years because, well . . . because they look like hookers. Critics worry that these hyper-sexualized figurines, with their attendant bling obsession, will send the wrong message to girls. My own daughters just think the dolls are creepy and can't understand why their feet come off rather than their shoes. In a face-off with the American Girls line, the Bratz would go down hard.
The movie, cheaply shot and raggedly edited, is set in a plastic neverland suburbia. It casts four relative newcomers: Nathalia Ramos as Hispanic Yasmin, Janel Parrish as Asian-American Jade, Logan Browning as African- American Sasha, and Skyler Shaye as Cloe, the designated pallid white girl. They're best-friends-forever who compare clothing notes via computer before every school day. The dialogue runs along the lines of "Shorties and leopard kicks!" and "Work the IQ, girl, but don't lose your passion for fashion!" OMG -- wrst screenplae of the yr!
Now they're in high school and the social dynamic threatens to split the gang up. "Bratz" has one decent, obvious idea in its tiny head -- Cliques R Bad -- and while our heroines are at first drawn to separate groups, they eventually join together to teach the jocks and the nerds and the goths and the loners to all get along. Why anyone would follow four college-age women who act like hyperactive 10-year-olds is beyond me.
Against our girlz stands Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Staub), diva queen of Carry Nation High and an egomaniac of titanic proportions. She has to be extra-loathsome so we'll be able to root for the Bratz without holding our noses. Some vague dreamboats stand on the sidelines -- loved Ian Nelson as Dylan, the deaf DJ -- and a few interminable musical numbers are thrown in at the end, making Disney's "High School Musical" look like Puccini in comparison.
The most depressing thing about "Bratz" -- besides its belief that shopping is a girl's best route to happiness -- may be the appearances of Lainie Kazan as Yasmin's heavily accented mamecita
 (mother and daughter dance around singing "La Cucaracha" at one point, possibly the movie's idea of ethnic cleansing) and Oscar winner Jon Voight as the uptight school principal. That's right, the former Joe Buck is now Mr. Weatherbee. Rent your children "Midnight Cowboy" instead -- it can't do more damage to their psyches than this soulless mallrat of a movie.

         "Transformers," the summer's other
 toy-based movie, seems like an exercise in Reichian minimalism compared with the symphonic awfulness of "Bratz." It's a movie on the wrong side side of the so-bad-it's-good line, but not one without an intelligence behind its depravity.
 
  Within the universe of the self-promotional and the self-referential, "Bratz" is a live-action editorial about the corruption of the culture, although not one that sacrifices on hair or makeup. Based on the line of fashion dolls, as well as an animated TV show, "Bratz" takes all the tropes of the femme-centric high school comedy, pumps them full of Botox and unleashes them on Carry Nation High School. It's an odd name choice, given that temperance is the one quality unknown at Carry Nation, where the curriculum seems to have been replaced by Ostentatious Consumption 101, and Remedial Venality.
 


         






    Into this snake pit flounce our four horsewomen of the apocalypse: Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Jade (Janel Parrish), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Cloe (Skyler Shaye), all of whom have special gifts. ("Fashion is like your superpower," Jade is told. "You shouldn't have to hide it from the world." ) But seriously, sort of, Jade is a chemistry whiz, Cloe plays soccer, Sasha is a cheerleader and Yasmin -- when she's not singing "La Cucaracha" with her grandmother (Lainie Kazan) -- is a very shy singer, whose talent will be as slow in arriving as the spring sale at Barneys.
 
  The evil goddess of the movie, and, naturally, the most amusing thing in it, is Meredith (Chelsea Staub), the obergruppenführer
 of the Carry Nation social scene. Her birthday party, to which she arrives on an elephant, is probably the comedic highlight of the film, save for the keening alt-rock soundtrack, which on repeated listening will certainly bring on a cerebral hemorrhage.
 
 Meredith's father, the beleaguered Principal Berkman, is played by Jon Voight, who brings such comedic subtlety to his performance he might as well be a feather in a hurricane. All around him, a teenage hell is breaking loose, but Voight never loses touch with his prosthetic nose, perhaps hoping he won't be recognized.
 
 MPAA rating: PG for thematic elements. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. In general release.   

Bratz , a movie based on a doll line, is an M&M-colored high school fantasia  for aspirational 10- and 12-year-old girls who'll be shocked (or, hopefully, delighted) when they get to ninth grade and find out life isn't so super-Bratz-fabulous. Its subject is cliques, as four exotically talented BFFs enter a campus as partitioned as Baghdad, drift apart for a while, but get together again in time to resume their high-pitched whines and even sing a closing production number, ''Bratitude,'' that sounds lip-synched by chain-smoking  36-year-olds.

 Arriving as inevitably as puberty, “Bratz” introduces the swollen-headed, fashion-addicted dolls of the title  to a live-action movie and an even more prominent position in the tweener universe. In human form, however, their craniums appear normal, giving no indication of the acres of retail space within.  In a high school story that feels hastily composed from fragments of much better movies, the four ethnically diverse leads use their special talents — soccer, science, cheerleading, singing — to discover themselves and destroy clique culture. This be-yourself message would be more convincing if it weren’t so mixed; applauding athleticism while coaxing female jocks into stiletto heels is hardly the height of girl power. To the Bratz, individualism is only cool as long as it doesn’t require unfashionable pants.  With their tender hearts and lip-gloss dreams, these teenage princesses are direct descendants of Alicia Silverstone’s Cher in “Clueless,” although Sean McNamara’s TV-ready framing and coarse direction lack Amy Heckerling’s snap and style. Instead, the movie’s veneer of inclusion — the hottest guy in school is also deaf — fails to hide some egregious racial stereotyping (the Latina Brat inexplicably shares her home with a mariachi band) and a script that wants to have it both ways. It takes a certain amount of genius to stage a derisive spoof of MTV’s “My Super Sweet 16” while enthusiastically aping the very materialism it promotes.  “Bratz” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a single mother on hard times, two boys on the make and four girls on the offensive.

There�s at least some risk that auds will come to see �Bratz� expecting a movie about German meat products. That would be wrong: No Germans seem to be involved. The second bigscreen extravaganza of the season to be based on a toy -- and a movie so noisy, cloying and hysterically adolescent it may create its own cult of the perverse -- �Bratz� offers supporting evidence that any film in which �Awesome!� gets uttered more than three times should get a NC-17 rating, regardless of all the benefits such a move would deny the hair-extension industry.
Based on a line of fashion dolls that has also inspired an animated TV show, �Bratz� is a tough movie to pass judgment on -- at least, if motive can be considered a factor in sentencing. Brazenly shoplifting along the entire Rodeo Drive of teen-girl classics (especially, if not exclusively, �Clueless,� �Mean Girls� and �Election�), it takes everything in its grab bag to an extreme, including the titular quartet of hotties who, inexplicably, appear to be entering high school at the age of 20.
At Carry (sic) Nation High School -- a combination health spa and disco, with a nod to the fascist slave factory of �Metropolis� -- the four begin as �BFF� (best friends forever!). But they are divided by new allegiances to new cliques: Brainiac Jade (Janel Parrish) becomes a chemistry geek, Sasha (Logan Browning) a get-down cheerleader, Cloe (Skyler Shaye) a soccer player with David Beckham�s foot. Only Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos) remains more or less unaffiliated, like Switzerland.
But the four aren�t happy, and they are reunited two years later by a renewed moral vision, thereby creating a sociopolitical allegory about the evils of tribalism, the former Yugoslavia and the theory of the unitary executive -- as embodied by one Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Staub).
Meredith is an interesting entry in the history of the don�t-hate-me-because-I�m-beautiful school of villainy. Although viewers have seen Meredith�s ilk before, she operates at a level previously unattained among adolescent dictators: She assigns seating at lunch, can reduce a freshman to dust with one withering glance and has the backing of the dithering principal (a terrific if unrecognizable Jon Voight), who happens to be her father.
�Bratz�s� references and parodies are consistently on-target, if always way too over-the-top. Every line of dialogue could plausibly take an exclamation point; most of the characters seem to be medicated, and Lainie Kazan, who has over the years played Italian, Jewish and Greek, now appears as Yasmin�s apparently Hispanic-Jewish granny. The music cues are so obvious and stupid, they�re the funniest thing in the movie -- except, perhaps, when Meredith is picking acts for the school talent show: �If I see one more violin-playing contortionist, I�ll scream.�
A current AT&T ad for Internet service urges the listener to �share your individuality with people just like you.� Which is essentially the message of �Bratz.� For all its blather about �letting your spirit soar,� it�s really about furthering an MTV-defined version of cool, which means too many clothes, too little education and too much money. Meredith lives in a house that would embarrass Michael Jackson -- and her father is a school principal. Obviously, it was Mom who had the money, which makes us wonder where Dad hid the body. And evokes our sympathy. 


Inspired by the eponymous, semi-skanky dolls that launched a thousand parental protests, this tween comedy does a good job rebranding the Bratz as wholesome do-gooders you'd want to take home to momespecially if mom likes the ethnics, because Bratz  is nothing if not worldly. Blonde, fair-skinned Yasmin is Latina, so of course there's a mariachi band in her kitchen. At eight in the morning. On a school day. Jade, who is half-Asian, is the math and science whiz of the group. Blonde Cloe is a Suzanne Somers style klutz, and African-American Sasha is a sassy cheerleader. The Bratz spend most of the movie crusading against the insidious clique overlord, Meredith, at authoritarian Carry Nation High. Meredith, with the help of her father, gutless Principal Dimly (Jon Voight ), tries to keep the Bratz in line, but the fearless foursome (spoiler alert!) eventually manage to triumph. In the end, the most offensive part of Bratz  isn't its stereotypes or brand expansion; it's the sorry state of Jon Voight's career. Up next: National Treasure: Book of Secrets .
