To call Sandler's recent catalog of films scattershot is to understate the obvious in a near-comic way. Saturday Night Live
's former man-child is still Peter Panning his way through his curriculum vitae, via vile little unfunnies like 2006's Click
 and the wholly unnecessary remake of The Longest Yard
 (neither of which played to Sandler's absurdist strengths). But then, seemingly on a whim, he turned in a fine dramatic performance amid the post-9/11 melancholia of last year's Reign Over Me
, a far better and more emotionally cohesive performance than the one he gave in James L. Brooks' misbegotten Spanglish
 or even his breakout freak-out in P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love
. But honestly, does anyone really want Sandler to grow up, all the way? His most rewatchable films remain his early, borderline Dada-as-anger-management outings in Billy Madison
 and Happy Gilmore
. Happily, You Don't Mess With the Zohan
, Sandler's first collaboration with co-writer and current Hollywood comedy godhead Judd Apatow, is a crazed, delightfully bizarre return to form for Sandler. As Israel's top dawg in the secret intelligence agency Mossad, the Zohan (Sandler) is a master of the extreme sport of parkour and
 a tireless schtupper of his adoring female fans. He is the ultimate �bermensch, both Nietzsche's and Hezbollah's worst nightmares. But (in an inspired comic riff on Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer
 � which precious few die-hard Sandler fans will likely get) what the Zohan really
 wants to do is cut and style hair for Paul Mitchell. After faking his demise in an equally inspired waterborne battle with his Palestinian archenemy, the Phantom (Turturro, comically holding his own), the Zohan moves to New York City to pursue his dream, and (some very clever) comedy ensues. As far as I know, this is the first Hollywood-made Jewish/Palestinian/immigrant comedy that also doubles as a surprisingly trenchant analysis of the Middle East's perpetual bloodbath. Would that Hamas, Hezbollah, and Ehud Olmert had Sandler and Apatow's sensibilities, we'd be seeing pie fights on the Gaza Strip. Thank goodness that, in the movies at least, following your dream actually gets you somewhere.


With a snip here and a smack there, Adam Sandler amusingly tackles terrorism in 'Zohan'
If "You Don't Mess With the Zohan" isn't the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations, it's at least the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations featuring a former Mossad agent who shags Lainie Kazan.
Nothing freaks the filmmakers out. Adam Sandler, as the agent, catches fish with his derriere, while John Turturro plays a Palestinian terrorist mastermind who opens a fast-food shack. The movie pretends this is all perfectly normal for almost two blissfully arbitrary hours.
Zohan is a celebrated government assassin who, tired of fighting Palestinians, fakes his death and flees to Manhattan to realize his dream of doing American hair. On the trip west, Zohan gives himself a makeover that turns him from a shaggy Hacky Sack enthusiast into a goateed Ben Affleck look-alike. Rejected from one of Paul Mitchell's salons (he drools over "The Lexington" and other haircuts in an ancient Mitchell style book), Zohan seeks work in a Palestinian-run salon, managed by a no-nonsense beauty (Emmanuelle Chriqui). The parlor's on a street split between Israelis and Arabs.
Lest anyone know he's alive, Zohan works under the name Scrappy Coco and moves in with Kazan and her grown baby of a son (Nick Swardson). At the salon, he starts sweeping up hair and, after his big styling break, winds up the star of the shop, the lines of women out the door testifying as much to Zohan's way with a flamboyantly ugly haircut as to his lascivious determination to sex them up afterward. He never admits it, but his hero appears to be Warren Beatty in "Shampoo," not Mitchell.
Alas, the hair isn't all that's a mess. The film has a drab, budgetless look, and the director Dennis Dugan, making his fourth Sandler picture, shows a kind of negative aptitude for filmmaking. It's all he can do to keep the jokes afloat. But the movie's grubbiness actually makes the winking, sub-Hong Kong action sequences (Sandler delivering a flying kick sideways in real time, for example) surreally funny. The movie's visual tackiness accessorizes nicely with its hero's.
Sandler wrote "Zohan" with Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow, and amid many of their very funny ideas is a plot that doesn't declare itself until the last rushed act. The upside is that it requires Turturro's character to show up in the movie's imaginary Manhattan enclave to destroy his archenemy. The worst idea in the movie is that fact that the filmmakers couldn't find more Middle Easterners to play Middle Easterners. Too much of it involves Rob Schneider as a cab-driving Palestinian nincompoop who has a bone to pick with Zohan. But why so little of the terrific bit players? Ido Mosseri as a fast-talking Israeli who runs a discount electronics store, and Daoud Heidami, as one of Schneider's level-headed co-conspirators, pocket the movie.
Ethnic impersonations aside, the movie creates a capitalist America running on proud immigrant energy and a passion for the music of Mariah Carey. The movie's villains aren't the Israelis or the Palestinians. They're the rednecks and white-collar titans desperately colluding to defame and displace outsiders. With its burning storefronts and arch racial hostilities (the musician Dave Matthews plays one of the rednecks; the boxing announcer Michael Buffer plays the vain, gentrifying property developer), the "Zohan" finale feels like a cartoon version of the infernal climax in "Do the Right Thing." The movie suggests that seemingly opposed factions - poor white people and rich ones; Israelis and Palestinians - can unite to fight a common foe. It's a battle for a corner of America that's passed off as horseplay.
It seemed impossible that Sandler would shed his moron shtick and evolve into any kind of political farceur. But in two superbly titled comedies - "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry" being the other - he's come closer than anyone has lately to Mel Brooks's kitchen-sink burlesques and John Waters's uproarious erogenous adventures. "Zohan" eagerly combines both. Nothing has brought me more cheap pleasure at a movie this year than the sight of shampoo and conditioner bottles falling off a rocking wall while comedian Alec Mapa, as a fellow stylist, tries to keep a straight face. He does a much better job than I did.


Back in his Monty Python days, Michael Palin triumphed as a violence-prone barber who hates cutting hair and dreams of becoming a lumberjack  a lumberjack who dresses in women's clothing. The constantly surprising sketch brimmed with anarchic references to Psycho , mother-and-son psychology, cross-dressing, 1930s movie musicals featuring manly Nelson Eddy as a crooning Royal Canadian Mountie, British on-the-surface propriety and conservatism, British beneath-the-surface kinkiness, and the increasing presence of sexual content on television in the swinging 1960s  all in a fluid seven minutes.
I mention this because in You Don't Mess With the Zohan , Adam Sandler   plays an elite Israeli commando who's sick of combat and dreams of becoming a New York hairstylist  a hairstylist who dresses in polyester disco shirts and tight pants that emphasize his papaya-size package. And although there is an onslaught of sexual content and a parade of guest stars in cameos, the essential conservatism of the project guarantees that there are absolutely no surprises in a padded 112 minutes. (Okay, one surprise: Mariah Carey has a funny line promoting her own conservative musical product.)
There is, instead, about enough novelty to fill a seven-minute sketch, most of it relating to the sweetness with which Sandler initially presents himself as a curly-haired, hyper-macho Israeli super-Jew. This proudly Semitic James Bond is good to his parents (Shelley Berman plays Zohan's papa like a pussycat compared with the kibitzing the old pro gave Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm ), good to the tawny, bikinied Tel Aviv girls who flirt with him, good to his Israeli comrades, and even good to the little Arab kids whose villages he's sometimes forced to disrupt on the hunt for terrorists. Everything he loves about his country is summed up in his love of hummus; he even brushes his teeth with the stuff. There are at least as many hummus visual jokes in this movie as there were ancient tribes in Israel.
As a Hebraic he-man, Sandler is a menschy charmer, all the more so for being so casually, confidently post-political about the role; it's a sexy, adult look for the guy, who also musters an excellent accent and does a nice bit catching bullets in his teeth. But once Zohan fakes his death and escapes to America rather than track down the Palestinian terrorist known as the Phantom (John Turturro  , a reliable Every-ethnic), the comedy gets old just as the action shifts to the new world. (The movie is co-written by Sandler, SNL 's Robert Smigel, and the ubiquitous Judd Apatow, and directed by Happy Gilmore 's Dennis Dugan.) Stowed away in an airplane cargo hold with two doggies in transit, Zohan takes the combined names of his canine fellow travelers and emerges at JFK restyled as would-be hairdresser Scrappy Coco. His tonsorial references have never progressed beyond those in a 1987 hair-fashion book he clutches like a precious bible. But that's not all that hasn't progressed: Scrappy is a typically, tediously innocent Sandler man-child when it comes to sex. He's got the bulge but not the brains.
I know, I know, we're not supposed to care about such persnickety niceties in such a cavalcade. But holy Koran and Torah both, do we need to swallow still more nervous jokes about being mistaken for a homosexual after the ''enlightened'' groaners of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry   ? Landed in melting-pot New York and hooked up with a job at a salon owned by a comely Palestinian cutie destined to become his love interest (Entourage 's Emmanuelle Chriqui  ), Zohan/ Scrappy reveals his talent for satisfying the sexual desires of his older women clients. And most of the heterosexual laughs are had at the sight of their aging lust (more rhino than cougar) for his equipment (more toe-curling than hair-curling).
Then Rob Schneider arrives  he's the comedy tax in any Adam Sandler production  as an aggrieved Palestinian taxi driver who IDs Zohan and rallies his fellow Arabs to rumble. That's when the movie falls into a muck of lessons about shalom as bland as any underseasoned bowl of chickpea dip. Gone is any real Arab-Israeli pertinence. Instead, these New York-based Middle Easterners join forces against a last-act bogeyman, an urban developer (Michael Buffer) who's cartoonishly villainous in his plans for neighborhood domination. Forget Monty Python, You Don't Mess With the Zohan  is a circus that never really flies.
More Adam Sandler:  Adam Sandler: 16 Key Roles

 Let me be blunt: “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” is the finest post-Zionist action-hairdressing sex comedy I have ever seen. That it is the only one I have ever seen — and why is that? what cultural deficiency or ideological conspiracy has prevented this genre from flourishing? — does not much detract from my judgment.  Directed by Dennis Dugan from a script by Judd Apatow, Robert Smigel and Adam Sandler (who also stars), “Zohan” has its share of scatology, crude sexual humor and queasy homophobia, the basic elements from which male-centered Hollywood comedies are constructed these days. There are supporting roles for stand-up comedians (Ahmed Ahmed, Nick Swardson) and “Saturday Night Live” veterans (Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon), a few oddball cameos (Shelley Berman, Chris Rock) and exquisitely random “as themselves” appearances by John McEnroe and Mariah Carey. Why not? Less amusingly, there are also some lumpy computer-assisted special effects, an overstuffed plot and a scattering of awkwardly executed gags. But a lot of the crude bodily-function jokes are actually pretty funny, not least because they are supplemented by more hummus-based humor than you might have thought possible.  You might also think, as I certainly did, that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents a singularly unpromising source of laughs. But as Yitzhak Rabin once said, enough of blood and tears. He did not go on to propose semen, urine, shampoo or hummus as substitutes, but those are, for Mr. Dugan, Mr. Smigel, Mr. Apatow and Mr. Sandler, the substances that come most readily to hand. (So does a made-up but scarily realistic Israeli soft drink called Fizzy-Bubbeleh.)  And the filmmakers spray all this stuff around in a brave and noble cause. American diplomatic efforts have so far proved inadequate to the task of bringing peace to the Middle East, but “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” taps into deeper and more durable sources of American global power in its quest for a plausible end to hostilities. Ancient grievances and festering hatreds are no match for the forces of sex, money, celebrity and exuberant, unapologetic stupidity.  Zohan (Mr. Sandler) certainly seems to think so, though he might express his views differently, and certainly with a thicker accent.  A highly skilled military operative who specializes in counterterrorism, he is basically a less anguished version of the character played by Eric Bana in “Munich.” The brilliant opening sequence places him in a tableau that would bring a tear to Theodor Herzl’s eye. Whether it would be a tear of joy or dismay I will leave to more seasoned polemicists, but there is something both appealing and authentic about a vision of the Jewish state on its 60th birthday that emphasizes lithe young bodies frolicking, flirting and playing Hacky Sack  on the beach. If you will it, it is no dream.  But only part of Zohan’s life is carefree, and it’s the other part — the job that requires heavy weapons, deadly stealth and hand-to-hand combat with a superterrorist called the Phantom (John Turturro) — that drives him into the diaspora. Zohan may have a picture of Moshe Dayan on his bedroom wall, but his real idol is Paul Mitchell, the American hair-care mogul whose outdated styles Zohan studies as if they were pages of the Talmud. He wants to stop fighting and cut “silky smooth” hair. And so, like everyone else with a dream, he migrates to New York, where he finds an entry-level job at a salon run by a pretty Palestinian named Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui).  A romance between them seems at once inevitable and unthinkable, but the taboos that “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” is unwilling to smash are few indeed. The movie is principally interested in establishing its main character as a new archetype in the annals of Jewish humor. He’s a warrior and also, to an extent undreamed of in the combined works of Philip Roth, Woody Allen and Howard Stern, a sexual hedonist, so utterly free of neurosis or inhibition that it’s hard to imagine him and Sigmund Freud occupying the same planet, much less the same cultural-religious tradition.  Sex, for Zohan, is like hummus: there is an endless supply, and no occasion on which it could be judged inappropriate. He is always on the make, but Mr. Sandler’s natural sweetness inoculates the character against sleaziness. In his feathery  ’80s haircut and loud, half-buttoned shirts, Zohan joins a long tradition, stretching back from Will Ferrell through Steve Martin to the great Jerry Lewis himself, of goofballs who mistake themselves for studs and turn out to be right.  The film’s image of Israelis as hopelessly behind the pop-culture curve — Zohan’s musical taste belongs to the same era as his hairdo — is itself something of an anachronism. The hip-hop-inflected Hebrew pop on the soundtrack (by  Hadag Nachash) provides some evidence that real Israelis are much cooler than the ones on screen. And the willingness of the American Jewish filmmakers to mock their Middle Eastern cousins is also a subtle, unmistakable sign of cultural maturity.  “Subtle” and “maturity” may seem like odd words to use about a movie that wrings big laughs from pelvic gyrations, indoor Hacky Sack and filthy-sounding fake-Hebrew and  -Arabic words. But much as it revels in its own infantilism, “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” is also brazenly self-confident in its refusal to pander to the imagined sensitivity of its audience. In this it differs notably from Albert Brooks’s “Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World,” which approached some of the same topics with misplaced thoughtfulness and tact.  I suppose some Middle East policy-scolds may find reasons to quarrel with “Zohan,” either for being too evenhanded or not evenhanded enough in its treatment of Israelis and Palestinians. Did I mention that it’s a comedy? Seriously, though, the movie’s radical, utopian  and perfectly obvious point is that the endless collection and recitation of political grievances is not funny at all, and that political strife is a trivial distraction from the things that really matter. There is so much hummus, and so little time.  “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It is raunchy but not quite sexually explicit, and the really filthy words are either invented or foreign.

Using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a backdrop doesn't come close to capturing the surreal mix of cartoonish comedy, "Give peace a chance" platitudes, puzzling cameos and big-penis jokes that add up to not much in Adam Sandler's latest outing as star/producer/co-writer. The off-the-wall comedy of Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow leaves a mark on the script, but it would require a talent of Peter Sellers' magnitude to conquer this material, and he's not around. Box office should be initially brisk, courtesy of the Sandler faithful, but beyond that, "Zohan" is a mess and then some. 
The movie represents Sandler's fourth collaboration with director Dennis Dugan, who has seemingly stayed within the comic's orbit (from "Big Daddy" and "Happy Gilmore" to the more recent "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry") by directing the star and his posse sparingly, bordering on not at all. As evidence, look no further than Rob Schneider's turn as a Palestinian cab driver with a lingering grudge against the title character -- his most relentlessly unfunny appearance under heavy makeup since his uncredited role in "Chuck & Larry" as an Asian wedding coordinator.
Questions of insensitivity toward Arabs -- played, as most of them are, by non-Arabs -- will surely arise, though the pic's tone is so over the top as to somewhat diminish the impact. The take-away message, moreover, is a rather childlike plea for Arabs and Israelis to all just get along, with the real bad guy being an evil U.S. real-estate developer, played (incongruously, along with much else in the film) by ring announcer Michael Buffer.
Sandler buffed up for the part of Zohan, a near-indestructible Israeli super-spy, but there's still heavy use of body doubles during his early exploits, in which he pursues a diabolical Palestinian terrorist, the Phantom (John Turturro). In the midst of a grenade-batting exchange, Zohan fakes his own death so he can flee to America and pursue his true passion -- cutting and styling hair.
Landing in New York, Zohan struggles to find work. Disappointed in his dream of working at Paul Mitchell's salon, he finally gets his chance from a Palestinian salon owner ("Entourage's" Emmanuelle Chriqui) in an ethnic neighborhood where Israeli electronics stores (with names like "Going Out of Business") uneasily coexist with Palestinian-owned shops.
Zohan's barbering career provides the movie's one truly funny -- albeit wildly broad -- section, as he earns a loyal clientele among elderly women by servicing them in a variety of ways. It's worth noting that in this year of copious male nudity, "Don't Mess With the Zohan" garners a friendly PG-13 rating despite innumerable gags about Zohan's enormous package, which is conspicuous even when sheathed.
In terms of actual laughs, though, the movie itself is pretty flaccid, experiencing too many long arid stretches resembling Zohan's home turf. Burdened with a premise better suited to a "Saturday Night Live" sketch -- the bad-ass spy who really wants to be a stylist -- the writers pad things out by recycling bits about hummus, immigrant Israeli and Arabs' fondness for bargaining, and randy old women. Alas, those efforts, and a decibel level bordering on abusive, can't obscure the lack of originality and pacing.
Several comedy and celebrity figures drop in along the way, but none are given much to do. As for Sandler, his phlegmy Israeli accent is fleetingly amusing but, like most everything else, grows tedious long before "Zohan" reaches its merciful end. Chriqui, in fact, plays perhaps the one character to emerge unscathed and, given the predominantly young-male audience and her flattering wardrobe, should at minimum bolster her position on Maxim-type "hot" lists.
Whatever controversy the theme engenders (and it's hard to imagine Arab-American advocacy groups not howling a little), "Zohan" is too silly to justify genuine anger. The more pressing thought as the movie drags on, rather, is an amended version of Buffer's signature boxing bellow, as in, "Let's get ready to exit!"


In a passable Israeli accent, outsize codpiece, and a new and improved bod, Adam Sandler 's Zohan, a Mossad  super-heavy, is every Jewish nerd's dream of self-transformation—until, that is, he has a career crisis and turns up in Manhattan as a would-be hairdresser in an awful '80s shag who falls for his Arab boss (Emmanuelle Chriqui ) while heading off a simmering Israeli-Arab war among the expats in the 'hood. If nothing else—and there isn't much else—You Don't Mess With the Zohan  pronounces the Middle East fair game for absurdist comedy. Very loaded comedy—the Palestinians (well, Rob Schneider ) are stupid rubes who don't know their nitroglycerin from their Neosporin . But for a caper whose antic pacing is clearly beamed at mini-mohawked boys and their bravely smiling dates, Zohan  comes in a curiously arcane package more likely to induce thigh-slapping among Tel Aviv  elders or Jewish-Americans who took their semester abroad in Israel  circa 1985. Dennis Dugan  directs with his usual heavy hand, but I like Sandler's trademark combination of shock tactics and sweetness. There's a crazed good-heartedness to Zohan (renamed Scrappy Coco) as he shtups his elderly-matron clientele. It's as if Sandler has elected to assemble all the solicitous Jewish mothers he's ever known and give them a great big Oedipal prezzie just for being who they are.
