�We�re going to rescue our brother; then we�re going to save New York City,� declares one of the crime-fighting turtles. Beyond this crux, the rest of the plot in this new outing from the dormant Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise seems an afterthought. Back on the screen for the first time since the early Nineties, the turtles are now animated via CGI and no longer wearing their Jim Henson hard shells. Though they are still identifiable by their color-coordinated masks and penchant for pizza, their character distinctions are harder to perceive in this revival. Even though much of the action takes place in the sewers and nighttime rooftops the turtle clan claims as their own, the overall look of this animated feature is murky and dull. The story involves some nonsense about 13 monsters that slipped through a time/space portal some 3,000 years ago and the rich modern-day tycoon (Stewart) who is gathering them up for unknown reasons. It�s all probably too slippery for the youngest viewers to grasp and too sketchy for the nostalgia crowd (for whom this revival seems most geared). There�s also an undercurrent about turtle-family values, as the brothers are resentful at the beginning of the film of Leonardo�s (Taylor) absence in South America, where he has been sent by their rat sensei Splinter (Mako) to hone his skills. The other three have grown unfocused in the interim: Raphael (North) a rogue fighting force, Michelangelo (Kelley) a party clown named Cowabunga Carl, and Donatello (Whitfield) a stay-at-home phone tech-support clerk. Though it�s all too ineffective for this Middle-Aged Mutant Ninja Critic, the film doesn�t seem as though it will have much appeal for a new generation of youngsters or their older counterparts (despite some vocal contributions by king of the fanboys Kevin Smith). However, TMNT
 probably has just enough juice to keep the franchise alive and kicking until its next incarnation.


Kids too young to remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle phenomenon when it was upon us in the early 1990s probably won't appreciate the fully computer-generated upgrade. But "TMNT" is made for them -- and nostalgic stoners. (The filmmakers have struck while the iron is cold.)
The movie is a serviceable way to pass the time: Kids will cheer the bright colors and funny new words ("Kowabunga!"). And they will probably have missed the cartoon series and the three rubbery live-action movies dedicated to it. So it will come as news.
Laurence Fishburne's holy baritone fills them in during the movie's opening sequences. Turtles named after Renaissance painters were radioactively turned super-reptilian in the sewers of New York and started fighting crime. Having done away with their archenemy Shredder (see live-action film number two), they've broken up and are pursuing new interests. Donatello (voiced by Mitchell Whitfield ) does tech support. Michelangelo (Mikey Kelly ) works the kiddie-party circuit. Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor ), the group's leader, lives in South America. And Raphael (Nolan North ) cruises the streets in armor as a vigilante. The group apparently is finished.
But a technocrat (Patrick Stewart ) is threatening to take over the world with a bunch of immortal warriors made of stone. According to an ancient myth, for complete dominion, he needs to catch one more Pok�mon -- I mean warrior. Can the archeologist April (Sarah Michelle Gellar ), her crime-fighting boyfriend Casey (Chris Evans ), and the wise rat mentor Splinter (Mako ) help the turtles get their act together in time? And exactly whose side is Shredder's niece (Ziyi Zhang ) on?
The animators and designers of "TMNT" create a big city with cool verisimilitude. The buildings shimmer as they scrape the sky, and you can practically smell the sewers' fetid air. The turtles' faces have a readable range of expression (although Michelangelo just looks stoned the whole picture). This is an impressive achievement for characters with virtually no lips and whose eyes almost reach the sides of their heads.
The men doing the turtles' voices bring the heroes to life, but the only truly memorable one is the brooding, chronically bitter Raphael, whom I imagine Michael Chiklis playing in a live-action version (that's not a recommendation). He sounds like he actually might have been toxically born and bre d in the gutters of New York City -- Brooklyn, to be exact. The writers have taken care to give him emotional depth and a dark worldview that other loner-misfit superheroes, like Batman and Wolverine , might appreciate. It's scary to ponder the better movie "TMNT" might have been if that kind of inspiration had been equally spread.
But all this care serves an underwhelming end: The movie still looks like a video game, and that synthetic tone characterizes all the action. The camera frequently rotates around a lot of the fights, creating the impression that the writer and director Kevin Munroe did most of his work using a control pad. (It's worth mentioning that the humans, with their stiff movements and rigid reactions, are like gaming avatars with rifle butts for chins.)
That attention to physical detail is undercut by a story that the filmmakers appear to have presumed kids wouldn't really care about. It's true, they'll want action. But by any means necessary?
The major battle sequence comes out of nowhere, and I don't mean it comes too soon (it doesn't) but it just crashes on top of the movie, signaling that it's almost time to go home. All the energy of this plot is geared toward some kind of showdown, but that it feels anticlimactic underscores how flat this movie is. The battle is purely the result of commercial will -- these things usually are -- but it's rare that you can feel a movie's obligation to give the kids what their parents paid for.
"TMNT" is a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message -- family, family, family -- is the processed cream filling. The production logo at the beginning of this movie reads Warner Bros., but I wouldn't have batted an eyelash if it had said Hostess.

         In the age of "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns," the hatchers of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise must have seen a promising opportunity to re-imagine their heroes for a new generation. Toward that end, "TMNT" bids farewell to the jokey, cheesy guys-in-rubber-suits world of the '90s movies in favor of a more character-oriented approach, a grittier look and superb computer animation — with decidedly mixed results.
 
 
 FOR THE RECORD:



         






    'TMNT': The review of "TMNT" in Friday's Calendar section referred to the "anointed leader" of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as Michelangelo. Leonardo is the leader. —
 

 
 This installment finds the reptilian crime fighters idling as they wait for anointed leader Leonardo to complete the training for which sensei Splinter has sent him away. Rebellious Raphael, however, is secretly moonlighting as an armored vigilante and building resentment toward his absent brother. The team reunites in time to contend with an immortal warlord and his stone generals, who are collecting monsters to open a Ghostbuster-ish cosmic portal.
 
 "TMNT" features an impressive collection of voice talent, led by Patrick Stewart as a mysterious industrialist, Ziyi Zhang as the leader of the rival ninjas and the late Mako as Splinter, the turtles' rat "father." By the way, Splinter is now cuddly. The detail in the movement and color of his fur makes him the cutest human-sized sewer rat you'll ever see.
 
 "Shrek" and "The Incredibles" may have raised the animation bar, but the texture in the costumes and the turtles' skin, even in the way distinct raindrops splash and dissipate on characters' faces, stands up to comparison. The gloomy city backgrounds are beautifully rendered, and the villain and monster design is excellent. The stone generals look like something right out of comic god Jack Kirby's feverish dreams.
 
 Alas, these turtles are not so happy together. The family-schism subplot involving Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) and Raphael (Nolan North) seems wedged in for gravitas, but all it does is weigh the movie down. It also reminds us of the all-too-obvious X-Men parallels: Leonardo as the ho-hum Cyclops analogue and Raphael as a poor man's Wolverine, without the humor.
 
 That's really what "TMNT" lacks most — humor. Despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures (O Pixar, what hast thou wrought?), the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously. More of good-naturedly dimwitted, skateboarding brother Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) with his "cowabungas" and surfer-dude idiocy would have been welcome.
 
 Fans of the comic book may disagree, but a franchise that began as a parody of superheroes doesn't seem suited to the serious approach.
 
 "TMNT." MPAA rating: PG for animated action violence, some scary cartoon images and mild language. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In general release.   

Long ago, I knew the theme song to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  cartoon series by heart; I lined up for the 1990 live-action epic on opening night. So it burns to report that this all-CG reboot is missing the goofy excitement of the old TMNT . By way of meager update, our green crime-busters now fight a messy panoply of villains and monsters instead of the fearsome Shredder, and sidekick April O'Neil (the voice of Sarah Michelle Gellar) trades in her yellow pantsuit for 21st-century Lara Croft gear. Also: not enough pizza.

 As Hollywood falls over itself to produce greener movies with ecologically correct themes, only the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remain willing to suggest that there is an upside to toxic waste. Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, these crime-fighting reptiles have been rechristened "TMNT" and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery  specialists. Nevertheless, the now-23-year-old gang  — perhaps to  connect better with its target audience — is still living at home.  Picking up where the third movie left off 14 years ago,  the story finds Michelangelo clowning at children's parties, Donatello manning a tech support hot line, Raphael playing nighttime vigilante and Leonardo skulking in the Central American jungle. But when a wealthy New York industrialist (snootily voiced by Patrick Stewart) begins collecting 3,000-year-old monsters (all 13 of which are likely to be coming soon to a Happy Meal near you), Leo must rejoin his brothers to avert the end of the world. Or something.  A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, "TMNT" offers an impressive lack of visual texture and discouraging human representation. (Maybe one day animators will learn that the female body requires space between the hips for more than just a bellybutton.) The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.  "TMNT" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has toothy monsters, scary female body images and ferociously ripped reptiles.

Conceived for fans but dumbed down for tots, "TMNT" takes one of the most curious comicbook phenoms of the '80s and translates it to yet another platform: a PG-rated all-CG toon. Animation quality is leagues beyond the hand-drawn style that launched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to popularity, and the storyline is no shallower than "300" (even if ripped turtle shells have nothing on Spartan abs), but pic lacks the personality that made these animated action figures so appealing 20 years ago. Kids will devour this like anchovy-free pizza, while nostalgia-driven kidult attendance should spell sequels for this "cash cowabunga."
Born as an irreverent one-off underground comic, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's 1984 "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" creation was quickly co-opted for toys, Saturday morning cartoons, live-action features and videogames galore. Each incarnation offered a slightly different riff on the basic premise -- four New York sewer-dwelling turtle-men, christened after Renaissance painters, who cracked jokes and fought crime under the guidance of a rat named Splinter -- while taking the property farther away from its roots as a spoof of early '80s comicbook obsessions with mutant and ninja subjects.
"TMNT" is nothing if not a blatant attempt to sell 
more toys and tie-ins, with precious little attention paid to pleasing the fans for whom the pic was allegedly greenlit. And yet, rather than repeating the gang's origin story for the uninitiated, the film picks up where the other movies left off. Time has passed, and Shredder, the gang's longtime nemesis, is still out of commission, and his minions (including one voiced by Ziyi Zhang) have become ninjas for hire. Narrator Laurence Fishburne warns that "a greater evil is poised to destroy" humankind, but in-fighting among the turtles seems a greater threat than the 13 monsters mentioned in the movie's underwhelming intro (collect them all, kids!).
"TMNT" would have done well to borrow a page from the James Bond/Indiana Jones playbook: It desperately needs an adrenaline-fueled pre-credits sequence to jumpstart the action. Instead, pic offers a long 3,000-year-old prologue followed by a bizarre South American jungle encounter in which April O'Neil (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar) reunites with Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor), leader of the gang.
Only, April isn't exactly herself, having ditched TV news reporting in favor of archaeological field work. Meanwhile, the turtles -- Leonardo, Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley), Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) and Raphael (Nolan North) -- have gone soft in their old age, with all but Raphael abandoning their vigilante ways.
Before "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," before "Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!" the franchise provided kids an adult-confounding tongue-twister to embrace. But the "TMNT" acronym spoils the fun -- and besides, the "T" no longer applies: These teenage mutants are now twentysomething slackers.
Their surfer-talk has gone from trend-setting to retro, and writer-director Kevin Munroe forgot to write them any good dialogue. Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and "cool," but the been-there animation can't compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie.
Whereas most toons take years to produce, Hong Kong-animated "TMNT" was rushed through the pipeline in just 28 months. The turtles themselves look great, with perceptible design differences among them beyond their face-mask colors and weapon selections, and the nocturnal Gotham environments impress. But the human characters -- namely April, sidekick Casey Jones (Chris Evans) and villain Maximillian Winters (Patrick Stewart) -- disappoint, their mouths matching their dialogue with all the accuracy of a sock puppet.
Considering the inevitable sequels (bolstered by none-too-subtle references to "further business" involving "familiar faces from your past"), it's a shame that "TMNT" manages only two virtuoso scenes.
In the first, Michelangelo skateboards from street level through the sewers to the turtles' secret lair in a single take, the camera looping and swirling along for the ride as no live-action shot possibly could. Later, Leonardo and Raphael have a rooftop face-off in the rain, revealing the full potential of how a "TMNT" fight might look (neither the original toon nor the movies' clunky full-body costumes could support this level of action).
But the rest feels little more than obligatory, with Munroe's script denying fans the satisfaction of a decent story or amusing interactions. Rather than waiting for a screenplay that warranted their bigscreen return, "TMNT" feels like an attempt to exploit the phenomenon further.

There may be no finer phrase in the English language than "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ," but given how kids these days are super into that whole Internet thing, the latest adventures of the crime-fighting, sewer-dwelling, slang-dropping pop-culture phenomenon are called simply TMNT . Unlikely to achieve BFF status with the MMORPG set, this CGI feature is light on the LOL factor, heavy on the ADD action scenes, and, like, TOOIFM (Totally Out Of Its Freakin' Mind). To wit: 3,000 years ago, a power-mad warrior opened a nasty magic portal that granted him immortality, turned his four brothers into stone, and unleashed 13 monsters upon his foes. Cut to the present, where the immortal warrior turned melancholy industrialist (voiced by Patrick Stewart ) has rounded up his rocky brethren and enlisted Karai (Ziyi Zhang ) and her ninja Foot Clan to capture the monsters, thereby reversing the curse. Meanwhile, the color-coordinated turtle dudes reunite to foil the plot with the help of Splinter (Mako), their Fu Manchu rat guru, and two dorky white kids (Sarah Michelle Gellar , Chris Evans ). Oodles of madcap digi-fu ensue, along with some halfhearted life lessons for our heroes in a half shell. Writer-director Kevin Munroe  parties like it's 1989, grooving on the extreme-sports set pieces and vintage slang to generally cowabusted effect.
