And now the circus goes quiet. In the hush, under the spotlight, after 40 days and 40 nights of manufactured hype and impassioned controversy (or is it the other way around?), stands a small, surprisingly ordinary movie. As a film derived from a book, ''The Da Vinci Code" isn't a fiasco on the order of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities" nor is it a triumph a la ''The Lord of the Rings." Instead, it's an acceptable but uninspired simulacrum: an overly faithful multiplex translation of a very, very popular airport novel.
The Hollywood alchemists haven't turned gold to lead. They've turned copper to zinc.
Ron Howard, it turns out, was precisely the wrong person to bring Dan Brown's best-selling novel to the screen. This project needed a risk-taker and a stylist, someone who could transmute a book that alternates routine action scenes with art-history lectures into riveting cinema. Howard's a good studio soldier, though, and with his house screenwriter Akiva Goldsman he has delivered a ''Da Vinci Code" that's chained timidly to its source. If you've read the book, it'll seem like a dutiful pilgrim's tour of the salient plot points: Here we are at the Louvre, now we go to the Bank of Zurich, whoops, Jesus had a home life. If you haven't read the book, you may wonder what all the noise was about.
How's Tom Hanks's hair? Fine, fine; it's a wardrobe affectation but you get over it after the first few scenes. The real problem facing our Tom is that he doesn't have a character to play. Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology and dashing doubting Thomas, functions as a mouthpiece for Brown's wild and woolly Christian conspiracy theories, and where it's easy for a reader to project three-dimensionality onto the character on the page, Hanks is left holding the bag onscreen.
As the audience's surrogate American in Paris, Langdon has to declaim silly lines of exposition such as ''This is the Bois de Boulogne?" or expound at length on the secrets of Leonardo da Vinci and the shadowy Priory of Sion to Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the fetching French cryptographer who gets swept up in the mystery. Hanks never breaks through the thick webbing of plot to create a viable human being, though; this may be his most constipated, least Hanksian performance ever.
Nor does Tautou, the wonky free spirit of ''Amelie," fare any better. Sophie is stuck asking breathless questions so Langdon can give his discourses; she also occasionally cranks up the suspense by urgently whispering, ''We must find anozzer way!" Don't expect romance between these two, either. Langdon's admiring ''I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex" is the closest he gets to sweet nothings.
To recap for the uninitiated: Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), an aging curator at the Louvre, is found murdered in one of the museum galleries, his nude body grotesquely posed and arcane messages written around him in ultraviolet pen. The detective on the case, Bezu Fache (who else but Jean Reno?), brings Langdon to the crime scene for consultation and grilling, since all clues point to the professor. With the aid of Neveu, Sauniere's granddaughter, Langdon escapes, and the two are off on a merry chase across both France and centuries of Church secrets.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ''THE DA VINCI CODE"? 
Sauniere, it seems, was the grandmaster of a hidden order called the Priory of Sion, which holds the true secret of the Holy Grail. Da Vinci was in on the mystery, as was Isaac Newton, as was apparently the entire supporting cast of ''Eyes Wide Shut." Without giving anything away to newcomers, it involves the relationship of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, the Divine Goddess, and lots of historical flashbacks that look like colorized outtakes from old Cecil B. DeMille epics.
Does the Church like this? Not at all, which is why a rogue bishop (Alfred Molina) in the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei has sent his albino right-hand monk, Silas (Paul Bettany), to murder the Priory members and find the location of the Grail. In turn, both bishop and disciple are being used by an enigmatic Teacher.
More than half the fun of the novel lay in the puzzles, of course: anagrams and riddles and keystones, hints buried in famous paintings that divulged the next step of the treasure hunt while allowing Dan Brown to indulge in miniature ''Leonardo for Dummies" crash courses. This was literature as computer game, but the movie treats it as scripture and nearly bleeds the zing out of it.
When the fugitives arrive at the palatial estate of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), an airy British Grail expert, ''The Da Vinci Code" temporarily gets the lift it needs. McKellen alone understands the inherent pulp silliness of the material, and when he introduces the existence of the Gospel of Philip, he could just as well be talking about the Gospel of Bob.
Eventually, he's chewed up in the plot mechanics, though; as in the book, once the Big Secret has been aired, there's nothing to do but fall back on lazy thriller cliches, up to and including lurking butlers. The movie does pick up anew after McKellen is offscreen, and in the final 15 minutes you can feel Howard rousing himself to care. Hans Zimmer's functional suspense score turns lyrical, the images mist up, and the script delivers sentiments along the lines of ''Why does it have to be human and
 divine? Maybe human is 
divine." The devout may take this as just the latest installment of Hollywood secularism while others may write it off as watered-down Beverly Hills Buddhism. But at least it feels felt
.
Anyway, there's enough for the faithful to get their knickers in a twist over, if they choose to. The reason ''The Da Vinci Code" has been a publishing phenomenon, though, is only partly because of its perceived heresies. ''Is [all this] possible?" asks Sophie at one point, to which Robert responds, ''It's not im
possible," and in that gulf lives our abiding love of conspiracy theories -- our sense that we've been lied to but that the Truth is in the patterns if we're just smart enough to see it. Brown has merely added the Son of God to the JFK assassination and Area 51 as subjects for endless pop cryptography.
All right, conservative Catholics don't come off well here, but neither do misguided atheists, for that matter. The scenes where Silas indulges in his gentle hobby of ritual mortification are played for horror-movie gruesomeness, but maybe the filmmakers can be excused for thinking this sort of thing packs the house after the success of ''The Passion of the Christ."
The greater sin in ''The Da Vinci Code" is against storytelling: The movie is handsome and hogtied and dour as a parson. In its defense, it does make manifest the pleasures of a good book. In the film's goofiest line of dialogue, Hanks turns to Tautou and exclaims, ''I've got to get to a library -- fast
."
Lord, don't we all.


         At the heart of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" is the Priory of Sion, an organization set up to vigilantly protect "one of the most powerful secrets ever kept." Once Brown's thriller became one of the fastest-selling books of all time, a similar organization — call it the Priory of Hollywood — was set up to protect what's as valuable to the movie business as any secret: a property that had the potential for enormous box-office receipts.
 
  No, the Priory of Hollywood, like many of the elements in Brown's book, doesn't really exist, but it is difficult to watch the film version of "The Da Vinci Code" put together by director Ron Howard, producer Brian Grazer, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks and not imagine that it does — and that they are the key members.
 


         






    For what drives this film is not the sense of excitement that clearly motivated Brown when he realized he had come up with a world-class premise, but a sense of responsibility. A need to guard the franchise at all costs has seeped into the very bones of this project, into everything from script to casting, and robbed it of the excitement that a willingness to consider creative risks might have given it. When director Howard told Entertainment Weekly, "I'll tell you what I get a lot. I get people saying, 'Don't screw this up,' there's a lot [of] anxiety about that," he was revealing more about the shape of his film than he may have realized.
 
  Yet despite all this, it doesn't make sense to completely dismiss "Da Vinci" for its lacks any more than it would have to write off the novel because it's filled with clunky on-the-nose sentences such as "Sophie felt herself staggering backward in amazement" and the always popular "Then everything went black." Both the novel and the film are helped, albeit to different degrees, by Brown's compelling premise. While the story plays better on the page than the screen and some of the film's elements work better than others, a proficient Ron Howard version of things is certainly competent if only occasionally thrilling.
 
  One of the reasons Brown's theological thriller was successful enough to be translated into 44 languages is the nature of his thesis. Yes, "Da Vinci" is not shy about venerable genre elements like numbered Swiss accounts and narrow escapes. But its gangbusters plot of a supposed secret history of Catholicism linked with "the greatest cover-up in human history" resonated mightily with a conspiracy-hungry public that (A) is more than happy to assume that forces of authority aren't leveling with us and (B) wants desperately to be in on the secret and in the know.
 
  If Brown's novel has something of the excitement of a nervy leap into the void (the book's level of success was hardly predictable), the script by Goldsman (an Oscar winner for "A Beautiful Mind") has some of the paint-by-numbers qualities of a Classics Illustrated comic book. Though there has been some monkeying with plot details, especially at the end, plus some noteworthy thematic exclusions and additions, the 2-hour-and-32-minute film is careful to be as faithful as it feels it can be to all of the book's major plot elements.
 
  So "Da Vinci" opens on screen with Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being chased down the darkened corridors of his Paris museum by a monk named Silas (Paul Bettany) who has murder on his mind. Before Sauniere dies he uses his own blood to both mark and arrange his body in such a way that French judicial police Capt. Bézu Fache (Jean Reno) feels it necessary to talk to Robert Langdon (Hanks).
 
  Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbology (no, the position does not exist), just happens to be in Paris giving a talk to an appreciative audience. No sooner is he whisked away to the Louvre to view the body than a fetching young police cryptographer named Sophie Neveu ("Amelie's" Audrey Tautou) shows up. She soon clandestinely lets Langdon know that he is in great danger: Fache, a policeman with the bulldog tenacity of "Les Miserables' " legendary Javert, suspects him in the murder of Sauniere, who just happens to be Sophie's estranged grandfather.
 
  The rest of "Da Vinci," on the screen as well as on the page, is a multifaceted chase.
 
  As Fache and others, including Silas and assorted members of the Catholic organization Opus Dei (which is real but strenuously denies any sinister aspects), chase after Langdon and Sophie, they try to figure out why her grandfather was murdered and what it has to do with them. In the process they talk a lot about ancient church history and seek the assistance of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), the reigning expert on the Holy Grail.
 
  Teabing lives in Chateau Villette outside of Paris, and one of the pleasures "Da Vinci" offers is the chance to see it and other key novel locations, including the interior of the Louvre, London's Temple Church and Scotland's Rosslyn Chapel. (Two other key locations, Westminster Abbey and Paris' St. Sulpice church, agreed to be filmed in exterior shots only, with interiors shot elsewhere.) And Teabing's illustrated lecture on Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" makes the book's points about the painting much easier to grasp.
 
  As to the film's other key visual elements, the cast, the results are equally mixed. To deal with the best first, Tautou is impressive as the intrepid Sophie, bringing the necessary urgency as well as a welcome conviction to this critical role.
 
  "Da Vinci's" supporting cast is less successful for a variety of reasons. Both Reno and Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa are too on the nose to be compelling, and though McKellen is always interesting on screen, his performance comes off as more relaxed than involving. Bettany as the tortured monk is anything but relaxed, and although his performance is a strong one, it is not what the film needs: Silas should be out and out terrifying, but he ends up more weird than deeply menacing.
 
  Equally problematic is Hanks' performance as protagonist Langdon. Likely cast for Priory of Hollywood reasons — whom do you put in the biggest novel adaptation but the business' biggest male star — he is not, his much-commented upon longer hair notwithstanding, the best person for the part. There is something constrained about Hanks' work — he's too reactive, almost like his assignment was to be the film's master of ceremonies, introducing the audience to key plot elements. And the hint of dashing romantic charisma that should be part of his character's makeup if the relationship with Sophie is to hold us has never been one of Hanks' strengths.
 
  As to director Howard, he too comes off as a kind of emcee, intent on not getting in the way of this juggernaut of a story. Changes in emphasis have been made, such as the downsizing of the pagan ritual of Hieros Gamos that plays a key part in the novel.
 
  And, perhaps in reaction to conservative Roman Catholic criticism of the book, a section has been added that emphasizes the power and importance of Jesus in the modern world.
 
 But finally, "The Da Vinci Code" remains a calculated bet on a promising hand. The Hollywood mystery of the moment is whether it's going to pay off.

Dan Brown's theological scavenger-hunt mystery novel The Da Vinci Code  may be the pop version of a novel of ideas, but that doesn't mean the ideas don't pop. The book does for Christianity what JFK  did for the Kennedy assassination  portraying it as the ultimate cover-up, which the book then unravels. Brown, a populist trickster metaphysician, draws us into a nexus of puzzles and clues  Fibonacci number sequences, anagrams  that are grounded in tantalizing artifacts from the real world. The novel even has its own version of the Zapruder film, the piece of evidence that's mystical in its power because we can all see and evaluate it with our own eyes: Leonardo da Vinci's 1498 mural of The Last Supper . Is that wilting feminine figure to Jesus' right not the apostle John but, in fact, Mary Magdalene? And, if so, was she Jesus' wife, the progenitor of his bloodline?
Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, is a Harvard professor of ''symbology,'' and in Ron Howard's dutiful, dogged, rather somber adaptation of The Da Vinci Code , Tom Hanks plays him in a dark suit and lank, longish hair  the dictionary image of a disheveled but still sexy academic. He's also been given a case of claustrophobia, a Hitchcock tic that offers Hanks a hook for his performance. I only wish the real hook had been Langdon's ideas. He has been called a cross between Indiana Jones and Joseph Campbell, but Hanks, playing this prof on a crusade, has to sandwich Langdon's brainy passion into the crevices between mediocre action scenes. He looks glum and, frankly, a little lost.
In Paris, Langdon is summoned to the Louvre, where a curator he was scheduled to meet has been found murdered, his naked body posed on the floor in imitation of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man , with a bloody pentagram scrawled on his chest. A police captain (Jean Reno) thinks Langdon is the killer, and thus begins an all-night pursuit in which Langdon, teaming up with a cute French police cryptologist (Audrey Tautou, muffled by the thickness of her accent), sets out to prove his innocence by literally unlocking the Holy Grail keystone, a kind of religious bicycle lock whose ''combination'' is encoded in a series of churches and tombs.
What's revealed along the way is that the truth of Christianity has been concealed  not just the facts of Jesus' life but the nature of Christian faith, its links to pagan goddess worship, to the ''sacred feminine.'' That reality, says The Da Vinci Code , has been hidden for a millennium by the Catholic Church but also guarded, as a sacred secret, by the Priory of Sion, a noble shadow cult whose famous members include Leonardo and Isaac Newton.
As a novel, The Da Vinci Code  hung speculative theology on a routine, if page-turningly rendered, cloak-and-dagger chase plot. It's no surprise that Howard plays up the thriller mechanics, which already felt like a movie on the page  the escapes and showdowns, the creepy stalker violence of Silas (Paul Bettany), a self-flagellating albino monk hitman who represents Opus Dei, the Catholic sect that's portrayed as intent on destroying the hidden revelations of its faith. The surprise, and disappointment, of The Da Vinci Code  is how slipshod and hokey the religious detective story now seems. It's a challenge, to be sure,  to cram Brown's litany of signs and symbols, his  intricate meditations, into a two-and-a-half-hour film, but Howard, working from Akiva Goldsman's script, fails to build intellectual excitement into the quest. He uses cheesy digitized flashbacks, rarely trusting the dialogue to evoke history, and he seems faintly rushed and embarrassed each time the movie grows talky, as if he were worried that the breathless theology wouldn't hold us.
A crucial change from the book is that Langdon has been made into a skeptic, a fellow who doesn't necessarily buy that official Christianity is a lie. This is a sop to the film's critics (i.e., the Catholic Church), but it feels cautious, anti-dramatic. Yes, a soupçon of research reveals that the Priory of Sion is a hoax invented in 1956, and surely it can't be proved that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were ever intimate (though Martin Luther believed so). But what we want from a film of The Da Vinci Code  is the fervor of belief. It's there only in Ian McKellen's playful, crusty turn as Leigh Teabing, the scholar who hobbles around on twin canes, spouting happy rhetoric about the meaning of the Grail. As a novel, The Da Vinci Code  has a resonance that lingers. It may be less history than hokum, but it's a searching product of the feminist era, when even many true believers have grown weary of the church as an instrument of moral reprimand and male dominion. The film is faithful enough, but it's hard to imagine it making many converts.


A pulpy page-turner in its original incarnation as a huge international bestseller has become a stodgy, grim thing in the exceedingly literal-minded film version of "The Da Vinci Code." Tackling head-on novelist Dan Brown's controversy-stirring thriller hinging on a subversively revisionist view of Jesus Christ's life, director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have conspired to drain any sense of fun out of the melodrama, leaving expectant audiences with an oppressively talky film that isn't exactly dull, but comes as close to it as one could imagine with such provocative material; result is perhaps the best thing the project's critics could have hoped for. Enormous public anticipation worldwide will result in explosive B.O. at the start in near-simultaneous release in most international territories, beginning May 17 in some countries -- day-and-date with the official Cannes opening-night preem -- and May 19 in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
Sitting through all the verbose explanations and speculations about symbols, codes, secret cults, religious history and covert messages in art, it is impossible to believe that, had the novel never existed, such a script would ever have been considered by a Hollywood studio. It's esoteric, heady stuff, made compelling only by the fact that what it's proposing undermines the fundamental tenets of Christianity, especially Roman Catholicism, and, by extension, Western Civilization for the past 2,000 years.
The irony in the film's inadequacy is that the novel was widely found to be so cinematic. Although pretty dismal as prose, the tome fairly rips along, courtesy of a strong story hook, very short chapters that seem like movie scenes, constant movement by the principal characters in a series of conveyances, periodic eruptions of violent action and a compressed 24-hour time frame.
The appearance of its easy adaptability may have been deceptive, however, as what went down easily on the page becomes laborious onscreen, even with the huge visual plus of fabulous French and English locations, fine actors and the ability to scrutinize works of Da Vinci in detail.
What one is left with is high-minded lurid material sucked dry by a desperately solemn approach. Some nifty scene-setting, with strong images amplifying a Paris lecture delivered by Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) intercut with the Louvre murder of curator Sauniere by albino monk Silas (Paul Bettany), spurs hope that Howard might be on track to find a visual way to communicate the book's content.
But from the first one-on-one scene between Robert and French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou, occasionally hard to understand), in which she convinces him that cop Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) intends to hold him for the murder, the temperature level drops, and continues to do so as the pair goes on the run to stay one step ahead of Fache while using their complementary specialties to decipher the meaning of the cryptic messages Sauniere scrawled on his body in his own blood before he died.
Part of the quick deflation is due to a palpable lack of chemistry between Hanks and Tautou, an odd thing in itself given their genial accessibility in many previous roles. Howard, normally a generous director of actors, makes them both look stiff, pasty and inexpressive in material that provides them little opportunity to express basic human nature; unlike in the book, they are never allowed to even suggest their fatigue after a full night and day of non-stop running, nor to say anything that doesn't relate directly to narrative forward movement. It's a film so overloaded with plot that there's no room for anything else, from emotion to stylistic grace notes.
The pursuit of a man and a woman barely known to one another was a favorite premise of Alfred Hitchcock, and one need only think of the mileage the director got out of such a set-up in films from "The 39 Steps" to "North by Northwest" to realize some of the missed opportunities here.
Temporary relief comes, an hour in, with the arrival of Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an immensely wealthy Holy Grail fanatic to whom it falls to explain, in unavoidably fascinating monologues, the alternate history the story advances. It is Teabing's thesis that the early Church, beginning with the Emperor Constantine, suppressed the feminine aspects of religion both stemming from pagan times as well as from the prominent role in spreading the faith he insists was played by Mary Magdalene, a role underlined by a close look at Da Vinci's celebrated "The Last Supper."
More than that, however, Teabing insists that Mary Magdalene, far from having been a prostitute, was actually Jesus' wife and that they had a daughter whose bloodline has persisted. McKellen seems to relish every moment and line, which can scarcely be said of the other thesps.
Given the widespread readership the book has enjoyed and the howls of protest from Christian entities beginning with the Vatican, it is hardly spoiling things to point out that the baddies here are members of the strict Catholic sect Opus Dei, including Silas and Alfred Molina's Bishop Aringarosa, defenders of doctrine determined to eliminate the threat to the established order posed by the so-called Priory of Sion, an organization secretly holding the "knowledge" that could cripple the church.
Even after the action moves from France to England, there's still a long way to go, and the final dramatic revelations, however mind-boggling from a content p.o.v., come off as particularly flat.
The darkly burnished stylings cinematographer Salvatore Totino brought to Howard's previous two films, "The Missing" and "Cinderella Man," prove rather less seductive in the largely nocturnal realms of "The Da Vinci Code." Hans Zimmer's ever-present score is at times dramatic to the point of over-insistence.

Stuffed with book learnin', worshipful of scholarship, queasy about violent action, and motored by anagrams and Riddler-style brainteasers, the obligatory film incarnation of The Da Vinci Code  is something of a locker-stuffed nerd in Blockbuster High School . Studiously faithful to the ubiquitous bestseller, Ron Howard 's film is uniquely clotted with history and mythology for a bankrolling summer movie, a form virtually defined by a gape-mouthed ignorance of both.
If only it were allowed to be merely a cheesy romp, an Indy Jones  movie with more sophisticated stereotypes and far less humor. But apparently this is no mere pop novel-turned-high-hat megaplex product. Even satisfied readers of Dan Brown 's Christian skullduggery may be surprised by the gravitas with which this franchise is being regardedin the week rolling up to its release, newspapers dissected the book's high-flying theses yet again as if they were historical assertions in need of debunking. Advance reviews burst early like hand-jobbed teenagers, and incredulous BBC  commentators broke the story of the film's "ordinariness"as if they thought it was destined to be a genuine revelation. Concerns about sectarian violence may keep the film from many Arab theaters, and cries of sacrilege have been renewed, as if by command of Brown's publicity team. Da Vinci Code  coffee table volumes, board games, spin-offs, retorts, T-shirts, and coffee mugs continue to clutter bookstores, while the Vatican  called for a boycott sight unseen, lending Brown's conspiracy theories cultural weight he couldn't buy for a billion bucks.
The resulting irony is thick as a brick, as we're faced with a populace, ordinarily disinterested in historical matters, who are suddenly paying far too much serious attention to the cryptology of the deep Christian past. Even star/coif victim Tom Hanks  is cynically sensible about the hubbubor is he brownnosing the devout?when he told The Evening Standard   that the film's story "is filled with all sorts of hooey and fun kind of scavenger-hunt-type nonsense." Brown might quibble, but Hanks is rightthe Da Vinci Code  movie is old-school skylarking, pulling monk-chant tropes out of The Omen  and talking up theories of symbology, Jesus biography, and Crusades espionage that have loitered in fringe academia for decades. (Robert Graves 's The White Goddess  danced over and disposed of this pagan vs. apostolic material in 1948.) For the first hour, at least, it's the sort of movie in which the hero is told by a stranger, "You're in grave danger." It may've been the 80th or 90th time I've heard that line, and I succumbed to a pang of matinee joy. It didn't last.
A plot synopsis would be redundant for many and scandalous for some; let's leave it with Hanks's semiotic historian being confronted by a Parisian cop (during a book signing!) to help uncode messages left beside a murdered body in the Louvre . From there, he careens (in a single day, mind you) through a nefarious plot involving Opus Dei , the Crusades, the significance of the Star of David, the secret legacy of Mary Magdalene , and a psychotic, self-flagellating albino monk (Paul Bettany ) whose idea of being inconspicuous is to stalk the banks of the Seine  in a cowl.
Jungians will be snoring by the second act, such are the elementary-grade explanations for religious signs and occult motifs. As a thriller, Howard's movie is 2.5 hours of clue-finding, plus explanation, plus police pulling up outside. Hanks's rather testy bookworm has absolutely no third dimension, but Audrey Tautou 's nurturing, code-experienced civilian has too much baggagehelpful flashbacks pop in at the drop of a gospel and often digitally occupy space with the contemporary characters. (A half-remembered glimpse of cabalistic sex ritual scans like an outtake from Eyes Wide Shut .) The juice that made Brown a magnate doesn't begin to flow until Ian McKellen , as an eccentric academic on a Grail quest, shows up with his capable jowls packed with exposition. The book may've magnetized readers with explications of Christian lore that draws too much uninterrogated devotion as it is, but the movie ends up feeling like a long-winded History Channel  special with movie stars and car chases.
Without the 40 million books already sold, this overpuzzled hogwashwhich, it should be rationally said, is no less risible than the Christian dogma it disputesmight've commanded the presence of Scott Bakula  and gone straight to video. Overshadowed by its own marketing hurricane and popular rage, Code  struggles for significance as a movie experience and flies a weak flag as a provocation.
