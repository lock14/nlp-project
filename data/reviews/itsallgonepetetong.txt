ack in the days of raves long gone, the English radio D. J. Pete Tong, a dance-music guru and the occasional subject of media profiles and gossip, was bequeathed an unusual claim on immortality when his name became part of Cockney rhyming slang. The phrase "It's all gone Pete Tong" is patois for "It's all gone wrong," and is now also the title of a faux documentary about a D. J. (not Pete Tong) who goes stone deaf. In "It's All Gone Pete Tong," everything that can go wrong generally does, mostly to surprisingly sweet effect. The faux documentary has become such an established clich� that it even has a reigning auteur in the form of Christopher Guest, the prankster behind "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show." The Canadian filmmaker Michael Dowse, who wrote and directed "Pete Tong," isn't a purist like Mr. Guest, who faithfully mimics the conventions of fly-on-the-wall-style documentary, thereby making a mockery of the form and its claim on the truth. Mr. Dowse takes a less rigorous approach to his sendup, one that eases into faux documentary form principally during intermittent talking-head testimonials and some phony television bits. The rest of the time, the story assumes a more familiar fictive mode as it tracks the sideways adventures of Frankie Wilde, an Ibiza-based club D. J. played with genuine heart and talent by Paul Kaye. Taking a cue from "Citizen Kane," a touchstone to which this film pays fleeting, cheeky homage, Mr. Dowse tells his story mostly in flashback. At the height of his fame and before his hearing went, Frankie lived in a mansion on the Spanish island, where he swatted away bikinied beauties by the dozen and ruled the island's cavernous clubs. With a body that looks like a couple of twisted-together pipe cleaners and a jagged yellow smile that speaks to the enduring excellence of British dentistry, Frankie makes a curious king of clubs. But he is royalty among these sun-drenched mortals, as well as catnip for groupies like his wife, Sonya (Kate Macgowan), and parasites like his manager, Max (a fine Mike Wilmot). As it happens, Frankie spins gold, not just vinyl. When we first meet the D. J., he is in the grip of a mondo  coke habit that would make a goner out of Al Pacino's "Scarface" Tony Montana. Coke builds Frankie up, giving him the energy to spin for thousands of flailing, cheering clubgoers, but it also brings him down, down, down. If Frankie's rise and fall don't yield any new truths about bad habits, it's because addiction often tells the same old sad story and typically leads to just two possible endings: recovery or death. But "It's All Gone Pete Tong" is primarily a comedy, so it gives nothing away to say that Frankie's addiction isn't really the point, but the means to an unexpected end. That said, the fanged, stuffed monster that rides shotgun with Frankie during his binges is genius. This fiendishly perverse homage to "Harvey" aside, Mr. Dowse plays it safe. Because he more or less stays within the parameters of the faux documentary (and the biographical picture), there isn't much room for him to cut loose. He wrings soft humor from the usual sources, including a phony music video and different talking-head experts whose blathering turns out to be as clueless as it is essentially self-serving. Mostly, though, he gives Mr. Kaye room to push at extremes as Frankie loses his hearing and then his grip. The British comic turned actor (best known for his satirical celebrity journalist Dennis Pennis) appears in almost every scene and he carries that weight admirably. He manages the very neat trick of keeping you interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. "It's All Gone Pete Tong" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes considerable drug-related humor, adult language and some violence, nudity and sexual high jinks.

"It's All Gone Pete Tong" was hyped at Toronto as "Spinal Tap" for the rave/electronica scene. A good idea, but film doesn't address it. Instead, this U.K.-Canada co-production from the director of Canadian cult comedy "Fubar" spends half its length on a superstar DJ protag's caricatured but depressing downward spiral before turning into an oddly sweet romance-cum-inspirational-fantasy. Given its most obvious selling point turns out a blind alley, this colorful, sometimes endearing but highly uneven pic looks set for rocky theatrical roads in various territories. Ancillary sales should be marginally smoother.
Framed by mockdoc sequences in which music scenesters (including some real-life DJs) discuss the mystery of protag's disappearance, story starts in earnest with turntablist Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye) on top of the world a year earlier. He's the party drug of choice for hedonistic youth each holiday season in Ibiza, where he lives extravagantly in a villa with trophy wife Sonia (Kate Magowan) and a barely noticed stepson.
Frankie has also just crossed over successfully into actually making records.
But there's a sudden major glitch. Years spent in deafeningly loud environments have taken their toll, leaving Frankie's hearing shot. The good times over, wife and stepson promptly jump ship. Frankie is left alone in his villa, severe depression further racheting up already monumental booze/drug habits.
All this occupies the film's first hour, which despite frequent gestures toward lifestyles-of-the-rich-famous-and-stoned satire (plus some spectacularly rude/crude language) is a sustained downer. Frankie has spat or upchucked on half a dozen people before the opening credits are done. He's such a substance-abusive basket case from the start that there's nowhere for lead thesp's performance to go. Pic should have spent far more time parodying the high life, and less dwelling on his self-destructive spinout.
Fortunately, Frankie hires Penelope (Beatriz Batarda), a deaf woman who's beautiful, patient, tough, single, and likes a stiff drink too, as his lip-reading instructor. Their courtship, as she helps Frankie discover a new way of life lets pic summon some genuine charm. Sophomore helmer Michael Dowse manages a particularly deft transitional montage that begins with Frankie discovering the musical properties of vibration (from a flamenco dancer), segues into lead duo's first lovemaking, and goes on as Frankie re-connects with the dance rhythms he'd thought were lost to him.
"Pete Tong" (title is a Brit catchphrase for losing one's grip) moves fast and looks a treat, with production design and widescreen lensing taking their tip from both Ibiza setting and the Day-Glo nightclub milieu.
Soundtrack, natch, pulses with well-chosen dance tracks. But sensory diversions only distract so much from fact that there's too little real hilarity here. Helmer's own script feels unfocused and semi-improvisational, with good ideas that should've been taken further, and some not-so-good ones that overstay their welcome.

The mega-club dance music scene is tough to mockumentarize. The excesses of Ibiza  bacchanals have been highly self-parodic right from the jump-off. And those fans and DJs who take their trancey transcendence quite seriously may be beyond the reach of satire. But neither that nor the fact that the scene is well past its late-'90s heyday ever dampens Canadian Michael Dowse's exuberant desire to poke belated fun. In his festival crowd-pleaser, what's all gone Pete Tong  (i.e., "wrong" in rhyme slang) is the career of DJ Frankie Wilde, a super-stoned deity of the Pacha decks. As embodied by the charismatic Brit Paul Kaye , known for his long-running role as TV's cheeky celebrity interviewer Dennis Pennis , Wilde  is a gold-toothed, projectile-puking party machine touting his flip-flop collection when he's not sailing triumphantly over the heads of adoring clubbers in a crown of thorns.
If Dowse 's parade of deadpan talking headsstill-faceless megastars like Paul Van Dyk  and Lol Hammondseems kind of stale, his deft dancefloor swoops manage to capture the ravey thrill that eluded "electronica" cash-ins like Groove . It's all giggles until Wilde goes deaf. Then the tone changes completely. Though Kaye's performance doesn't, er, miss a beat, the director concentrates his efforts on bringing us along into Wilde's new silence. Lots of Dowse's ideas work wellthe ringing tinnitus, the conversion of sound to visible waves, the trimming of treble and bass for underwatery effect, the removal of ambient noise entirely. But as the humor flags, It's All Gone Pete Tong  starts to feel more like an exercise. Also, since Wilde has mainly been a cartoon thus far, it's strange when his 24-hour party morphs into a sweet little tale about lip-reading and Photoshop  beat-matching.
Stateside, Damon Dash 's A Hard Day's Night  for the thug set, State Property 2 , continues to ensure that hip-hop's story is sold, not told. For this second extended Roc-a-Fella  records commercial, Beans (the currently incarcerated Beanie Sigel ) reprises his role as a Philly drug boss feuding with local rival Dame (Dash, natch). Improving on the first movie, Death of a Dynasty  screenwriter Adam Moreno  supplies a plot, and even a twist involving a mysterious fixer named Pollo Loco  (the low-key Noreaga ). Of course, the whole thing's just an excuse for Dash to trot out his vodka and his lineupBeans's incessant voice-over provides a scan of leaders of major metro area crews: Harlem's Diplomats , Brooklyn 's M.O.P., Chicago's Kanye West , London's SAS.
When this flick is honest about its pimping, it has that Rat Pack charm. But attempts at real ruggish posturinglike that de rigueur sideways-gatted, full-body-exposure firing stanceare just plain laughable. Take the flashback showing Beans as a little neighborhood roughneck: After some sidewalk beat-downs, he and his pals try to steal weed from a small-time dealer who catches them breaking in. When callous little Beans wastes him, clocking his first body, grown-up Beans's commentary cuts in with the hilarious observation, "I didn't choose the game. The game chose me." Despite his devil scowl and real-life attempted-murder trial, Sigel makes a rather frumpy don of South Philly . As in Fade to Black , when he stole the show from centerpiece Jay-Z , Philly rapper Freeway  proves that even as a laconic Muslim cellmate he has more on-screen juice than Sigel.
You gotta wonder why, given the sharp drug-biz writing on The Wire , Dash doesn't smarten things up. He was a producer on 2002's much more nuanced Paid in Full  (featuring notable performances by both Cam'ron  and Wood Harris , later of Wire fame). And even if these State Property  toss-offs are just consumer primers for tag-popping teensOcean's Thirteen with titty-bar frostingnobody here gets off a shot as good as Frankie Wilde's screaming in-studio exhortation, "Bang those drums like yah bang yah sistah!" With snaps like that, who needs guns anyway?
