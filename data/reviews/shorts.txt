This time around it�s another family film for Rodriguez, whose filmmaking career at this point has two modes: kid pics and grisly adult fare. All are comedic action romps highlighted by their homegrown flavor of technological wizardry and Rodriguez�s near-total creative control. (In Shorts
, Rodriguez is listed as the film�s writer, director, co-producer, cinematographer, co-editor, and contributing music composer.) Additionally, the kid-oriented films are usually family outings. Here, son Rebel Rodriguez supplied many of the film�s ideas, as did son Racer for 2005�s The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
. A look through the cast and crew list will find several other members of the extended Rodriguez family peppered among its ranks. Filmmaking has turned into a family business for this father of five (from a family of 10 siblings), and that�s a good thing in his kid pics because Rodriguez really does seem to have a direct line into what makes the little rascals laugh and relate. In Shorts
, that includes a booger monster, crocodiles running upright, plastic-encased germophobes, and more. The moral lesson is no more complicated than �be careful what you wish for.� The story belongs completely to the kids, with the adult talent all capably doing their thing while letting the spotlight shine primarily on their young castmates. There are also some cultural gibes at our ever-growing dependence on impersonal technological gadgets featuring applications designed to master every aspect of life while dampening our native creativity and imagination. The suburban setting of Black Falls is a company town where everyone�s family works for Black Box Industries, the makers of the ubiquitous gadgets that have an endless array of functions and shape-shifting abilities (something like Transformers). The story follows tweener Toe (Bennett), who finds a multicolored stone that can grant every wish � a wishing rock that creates havoc as it passes from hand to hand. The story structure is kiddie postmodern, as the film cuts forward and backward in chapters as events rewind or fast-forward as though controlled by a digital switch (hence the title Shorts
). The action never pauses long enough to become tiresome, though most of the film�s rude humor is directed squarely at young viewers� sensibilities. (None of that Pixar kind of humor that appeals to kids on one level and adults on another for Rodriguez.) Vanier makes a stunning film debut as Toe�s nemesis, Helvetica Black, a Veruca Salt type of spoiled rich girl who stuffs Toe into garbage cans. Rodriguez�s technical wizardry is less showy here than in his other recent outings, which helps Shorts
 connect with kids on a basic human level. Parents will, no doubt, be renting this electronic babysitter for a long time to come.

You might want to avoid topping the kids off with high-fructose corn syrup before going to see “Shorts.’’ The new family feature from Robert Rodriguez, of “Spy Kids’’ fame and “Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl 3D’’ infamy, is, if anything, even more hopped up than those films. If you want to peel your children off the ceiling after the end credits, by all means load up on the Slushees. Be warned, though: This is the multiplex equivalent of ADD.
The story line is simple: bored suburban kids, silly parents, magic wishing rock, go
. Nothing that wouldn’t be out of place on Nickelodeon. Rodriguez rearranges the chapter-like “shorts’’ out of sequence, though, fast-forwarding and rewinding and pausing the action with literal video-control icons on the screen. It’s like a young Charlie Kaufman got hold of your TV remote and won’t let it go.
Jimmy Bennett  - a charmless Macaulay Culkin clone  - plays Toby Thompson, the bullied brace-face hero at the center of the mayhem. He and spacy schoolmate Loogie (Trevor Gagnon) are the first to pass the rainbow-colored rock from outer space between them, wishing for fortresses and miniature alien friends and endless supplies of Nutrageous bars (so plentiful I’m guessing Reese’s paid for the entire production).
This is all simple fun  - what kid wouldn’t want a wishing rock?  - presented with manic overexuberance. Things get weirder when the grown-ups get in on the act. Toby’s parents (Jon Cryer and Leslie Mann) wish to be closer and turn into Siamese twins; a giant CGI booger terrorizes a germaphobic neighbor (William H. Macy) and his son (Jake Short); a very tired-looking James Spader, as the parents’ corporate meanie boss, grows big ears and turns into a Transformer (shhh, don’t tell the kids).
“Shorts,’’ in other words channels the same gross-out overkill as the “Captain Underpants’’ books that parents endure and pre-teen boys so dearly love. The difference is that those books have an editor (and they’re funnier). Rodriguez throws  10 ideas at the screen at any given time; usually only one or two stick. The boss’s high-tech product, a handheld superdevice, is a nice parody of PDAs, iPods, iPhones, and what have you, and the movie skewers the kind of Type-A parents who text each other within the same room. Those notions compete with a zillion others, though, and the movie just ends up slapping you silly.
Lost in the aggro-entertainment is a sharp little performance from Jolie Vanier as Toby’s schoolyard enemy/love-object  - Rodriguez may have found the next Christina Ricci  - and an enjoyably dreamy one from Gagnon. “Shorts’’ plays well to its narrow 8-to-11 niche, and that’s probably all that matters. Still, if any movie can be said to have too much
 imagination, it’s this one. I don’t want to be around when Rodriguez comes down off his sugar buzz.
.

More like a summer-camp theater project than a studio movie, Shorts ' noodly, kid-oriented action-adventure story follows a magic, wish-granting rock as it falls into various pint-size hands in one all-American suburb. Kid-at-heart filmmaker Robert Rodriguez , whose playtime Spy Kids  trilogy gets a gold star, looks like he's having great fun, but what about the rest of us? Can we wish for a fresher subplot than that of pleasure-deadened grown-ups who live their lives in a stupor of consumerism?

 “I wish I had friends,” laments 11-year-old Toe Thompson (Jimmy Bennett), a picked-on kid with a mouth full of metal and a ZIP code full of weirdos. Toe’s lack of companionship, however, has less to do with his orthodontist than with the peculiarities of his suburban neighborhood: the ominously named Black Falls, home to Black Box Industries and locus of excessive looniness.  Structured as five short stories connected by Toe’s irksome narration, “Shorts” surges forward and rewinds, pauses and skips around as if  controlled by a remote-wielding toddler. This narrative device, assisted by appropriate on-screen graphics, soon becomes tiresome, but it’s emblematic of a film that is dancing as fast as it can to entertain. Yet despite a plot crammed with mini-aliens, maxi-crocodiles and a variously sized James Spader, the movie never engages more than our eyes.  The story’s MacGuffin is a rainbow-hued wishing rock that bounces from one character to another, granting computer-generated fantasies and causing predictable pandemonium. Since this is a tale for tykes, the rock must enlighten as well as gratify; so the avaricious owner of Black Box (a criminally underextended Mr. Spader) learns that his children need more attention than his bank balance, while Toe’s workaholic parents (Jon Cryer and Leslie Mann) finally comprehend that talking is healthier than texting. Everyone learns what it means to be terrorized by technology — something of a paradox  in a movie whose characters, story and emotions are fatally subordinate to a tsunami of special effects.  The least convincing of these invigorate the Black Box, the company’s sole product: a strange, multipurpose gadget that resembles an ebony Rubik’s Cube and can serve as everything from a cheese grater to a solar panel. This utopian utensil — a wishing rock for the consumer — allows for a mild skewering of our infomercial culture and, especially, our increasingly decentralized workplace. Presenting a labor-saving device whose development monopolizes the time and labor of every adult in Black Falls, the movie revels in an absurdity that parents will appreciate even if their kids do not.  Concocted by Robert Rodriguez, a kind of filmmaking Black Box (he wrote, directed, edited, produced, photographed, composed some of the music and supervised the visual effects), “Shorts” feels underwritten and overdressed. Though adept at homing in on the things that kids find hilarious — boogers, loogies, not-blinking contests — Mr. Rodriguez (whose bifurcated brain flips easily from “Grindhouse” gore to “Spy Kids” kookiness) leaves his adults in the lurch. Even the estimable William H. Macy, as a germophobic scientist, is forced to play most of his scenes from inside a Hazmat suit.  Thank heavens for little Jolie Vanier. As Helvetica Black, whose Beryl the Peril demeanor and ingenious nickname (“Typeface”) enliven many a doldrum, this pint-size Christina Ricci is a real find. She’s not enough, though, to rescue a movie so conventional as to urge us to be careful what we wish for. Like a sequel, perhaps?  “Shorts” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A telepathic baby, a bodacious older sister and a raging blob of mucous.

More zippy, diverting fun from Robert Rodriguez's family filmmaking factory, "Shorts" delivers a shopworn moral lesson for kids and adults (be careful what you wish for!) with a more pointed contempo spin (technology is ruining human communication!). A series of cheekily interwoven vignettes, centered around a magic rock that wreaks havoc on residents of a small suburban town, the Aug. 21 Warner Bros. release has fewer marketable hooks than Rodriguez's "Spy Kids" franchise but looks to exceed the $39 million domestic haul of "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D." On homevid, "Shorts" should be a long-term performer.
Foregoing the strenuous 3-D experiments of "Sharkboy" and the third "Spy Kids" movie, Rodriguez's latest feels like a return to kiddie basics, though there's been no accompanying dip in zany energy or infectious sense of play. A pleasing PG-rated confection tossed off between schlockfests (2007's "Grindhouse" entry "Planet Terror" and the forthcoming "Grindhouse" spinoff "Machete"), the pic once again finds Rodriguez wearing almost every hat imaginable -- director, producer, writer, d.p., co-editor, composer, visual effects supervisor, re-recording mixer -- and accommodating no fewer than six members of his family in the sprawling ensemble cast.
Set in the fictitious town of Black Hills, these five "Shorts" are narrated, out of sequence, by young Toby "Toe" Thompson (Jimmy Bennett). Neglected at home by his workaholic parents (Leslie Mann, Jon Cryer) and abused at school by a group of bullies led by pint-sized classmate Helvetica Black (Jolie Vanier), Toe comes into possession of a rainbow-colored rock that has the power to grant wishes. Naturally, they aren't granted in quite the manner he expects.
As the mayhem multiplies, the rock passes from one unsuspecting pair of hands to another, occasioning a series of misadventures involving the other neighborhood kids, their parents and an impressive array of visual effects. Three boys find themselves fending off cobras and crocodiles; another kid, the son of a germophobic scientist (William H. Macy), does battle with a giant booger monster; a bully is transformed into a dung beetle (twice); a baby (Rodriguez's niece, Bianca) is hilariously gifted with superhuman intelligence; and Toe's ordinarily distant parents are given an awkward lesson in forced intimacy.
Each of these snappy tall tales combines broad slapstick, impudent verbal sparring and scatological humor, neatly garnished with an obvious moral lesson or two. One of the charming dividends of Rodriguez's anything-goes approach (which belies the script's sturdy carpentry) is that a kid-targeted cautionary tale about the importance of good hygiene ends up sharing screen time with a fairly barbed portrait of the deadening of American family life due to high-tech distractions such as cell phones and flatscreens.
The chief villain here is Mr. Black (James Spader), father of Helvetica and CEO of the huge corporation that owns everything and everyone in Black Falls, allowing Rodriguez to gleefully satirize domestic apathy and rampant workaholism, as well as multipurpose handheld gadgets and the infomercials used to sell them. Subtle it ain't, but parents watching "Shorts" with their kids may experience an uncomfortable moment of self-recognition.
In an ensemble that involves much adult-kid interaction, the most memorable perf belongs to young Vanier. A dead ringer for Christina Ricci circa "The Addams Family," Vanier is so lovably hateful here, she gets an "introducing" billing in the credits and even her own musical motif.
Pro tech package has an appealingly handmade, labor-of-love quality. Opening logos and titles are preceded by an amusing one-minute short whose tyke characters reappear throughout the film as an increasingly belabored running gag.

Austin 's rebel without a crew, Robert Rodriguez  works in exactly two filmmaking modes: fast, cheap, genre violence (the El Mariachi  trilogy, Sin City , Planet Terror ) and fast, cheap, CGI-overloaded family adventure (the Spy  Kids  trilogy, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D ). One of the latter, Shorts  is a cute and mildly clever fantasy about a nerdy suburban tween named "Toe" (Jimmy Bennett ), who finds a rainbow-colored stone with wish-fulfillment powers; with the comic elasticity of a Tex Avery  cartoon, the simplistic plot's limitless possibilities are digitally and unsubtly rendered. (Calling all dung beetles, upright crocodiles, man-sized frankfurters, and booger monsters!) Structured episodically, but cheekily out of order, the film introduces Toe's friends, family, schoolyard enemies, and broadly eccentric neighbors—including germaphobic scientist William H. Macy  and dictatorial CEO James Spader —as each come into perilous contact with the magical rock. Be careful what you wish for, as we learned as adolescents, which is precisely who and only who this rowdy romp is for—though I'd score points for Jon Cryer  and Leslie Mann 's slapstick as Toe's accidentally conjoined folks.
