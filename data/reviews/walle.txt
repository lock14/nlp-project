What would Stanley Kubrick � or for that matter, Arthur C. Clarke or even Isaac Asimov � have made of Pixar's WALL-E
? It's the story of the last functioning robot (a "Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class," to be more precise), who leads a solitary existence cleaning up an ecologically devastated Earth, some 700 years after the last human being abandoned the dying, trash-strewn planet for the pristine safety of the stars. WALL-E (Burtt), a boxy, oxidated whirball on treads with expressive, binocular eyes, has only a chittering cockroach pal to share his endless days with, and that makes for one lonely robot. He's learned about companionship from an old VHS copy of the musical Hello, Dolly!
, and as the massive dust-and-debris storms roll in every evening, the dingy little 'bot hunkers down inside a makeshift home adorned with the finer detritus of his scavengings � Christmas lights, Commodore 64s, and rubber duckies. Thus safely ensconced, he dreams not of electric sheep but of love. And then, without warning and in a blast of fiery thruster thunder, a titanic vessel lands in his back yard and deposits EVE (Knight), an ovoid female robot who has been given a directive to discover if life � plant life, animal life, any
 life � has blossomed in the seven centuries since Homo sapiens turned their back on their home world. She finds it, too, not only in WALL-E but also in a single, frail green sprout that may well be the only real
 life on the planet. Mission accomplished, she turns herself off to await the return of her mother ship (whose onboard computer is voiced, in a nice touch, by Sigourney Weaver). WALL-E, however, is smitten almost from the moment of EVE's first appearance, and while the film eventually takes both of these �droids off-world and into the sedentary, emotionally disconnected world of the surviving human race, the story remains focused on the blossoming romance between the little load-lifter and his blue-eyed paramour. This is Pixar's finest and most emotionally powerful film yet, and it draws on a wealth of cinematic resources that runs the gamut from Chaplin's best to Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati, and even Martin & Lewis. It's a virtually dialogue-free film up until its midpoint, at which point lyrical references to 2001: A Space Odyssey
 (Industrial Light & Magic's special-effects legend Dennis Muren contributed heavily to replicating the 70mm look of Kubrick's film), Douglas Trumbull's elegiac Silent Running
, and even Geoff Murphy's The Quiet Earth
 begin to crop up all over the place. (There's also a Sputnik-y shout-out to The Iron Giant
's Brad Bird.) But sci-fi aside, WALL-E
 is a love story, pure and simple. Pixar's ceaselessly creative animation artists drench the screen in a dazzling palette of violets, magentas, crimsons, and pinks � the colors of the heart � and achieve a level of clarity that approaches reality without sacrificing one iota of dreamy, animated wit. By turns sad, hilarious, exciting, and, ultimately, hopeful, this is a film of Great Truths masquerading as child's play. Those past science-fictioneers Kubrick, Clarke, and Asimov would've loved it, I think, and I'd wager my first edition of The Martian Chronicles
 that Ray Bradbury, too, is going to recognize a kindred, humanist soul in WALL-E
's life-affirming quest for love.


Daring 'WALL-E' is a family film with a cautionary message that even parents can love


With "WALL-E," Pixar
 at last takes the great leap forward many of us knew the company had in it. A "family movie" in name and MPAA rating only, it's a major visionary work, a sci-fi parable of astonishing scope and depth that is anchored by an adorable bucket of bolts and yoked to a sensibility that is - there's no other word for it - furious. It's also, by a substantial margin, the best American film of the year to date.
The accomplishment of director Andrew Stanton, his co-writers Pete Docter and Jim Reardon, and the artists and computer jockeys who work under Pixar majordomo John Lasseter can be gauged by the disturbing awe we feel at the trash-choked disaster man has made of his home planet. "WALL-E" begins on a ravaged Earth centuries in the future; humans have long since fled in cruise-line spaceships, leaving behind small robots with sad, binocular eyes to sweep up the mess. These are called Waste Allocation Load Lifters, Earth-class - WALL-Es for short - and there appears to be only one left in working order.
As you'd expect, he's lonely. WALL-E spends his days compacting detritus into cubes and piling them up; early on, we realize with a start that what seem to be skyscrapers are in fact towering ziggurats of our leftover junk. At night, WALL-E puzzles over his keepsakes - a Rubik's Cube, a rubber duck - and watches a videotape of the 1969 musical "Hello, Dolly!," obsessively returning to the Michael Crawford love song "Out There." (He's not a Streisand fan, I guess.)
These scenes are stunning in their wide-screen attention to detail and their refusal to let us off the hook. While there is a standard Disney sidekick critter, it's a cockroach; surprisingly cute, but still, a cockroach. The first act of "WALL-E" is, daringly, a post-apocalyptic silent movie that picks up where the last act of "AI: Artificial Intelligence" left off.
What keeps us from hanging ourselves in the theater? Two things: WALL-E himself - he's an ingeniously designed pip, with a timid curiosity and a comically stalwart sense of duty - and the arrival of EVE, a gleaming white probe from the BnL Corp.'s cruiseship far out in space. Her name stands for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, and she's looking for plants - evidence that Earth is ready for recolonization. By chance, WALL-E has just turned one up, a delicate shoot he's repotted into a shoe.
So this is what Pixar is asking us to buy into: a romance between two robots. Because it is Pixar, bringing wit and intelligence to kiddie CGI fare that usually has none, the task turns out to be unexpectedly easy.
"WALL-E" picks up speed when the little guy follows his girlfriend back to the spaceship and the film becomes a more familiarly rambunctious action-adventure story. Again, though, there's magic in the swooping design of the interiors - Pixar just thinks bigger and more elegantly than anyone else - and the comic variations on robot servants. (I especially liked M-O, an anal-retentive sweeper-bot that freaks out at the sight of dirt.)
Where are the people? They're here, and after 700 years of being waited on hand and foot by domestic machines, they've grown pear-shaped and indolent, unable to get to their atrophied feet for lack of bone mass. If anything, this is more frightening than the scenes back on Earth, a goofy but ferocious attack on a consumer culture that turns leisure into religion and humans into overfed sheep.
The machines, by contrast, are superior in every way to the people they ostensibly serve: smarter, faster, more alive. Even the human captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) is under the sway of Auto, the piloting system that takes the form of a ship's wheel with an angry red HAL 9000 eye in its center. The captain wants to head back to Earth. Auto, acting on outdated directives, intends to destroy the plant and keep the ship floating through space forever. Against him (it?) are EVE and WALL-E, now labeled "rogue robots" and volleying through the ship in open rebellion.
"WALL-E" takes the fizzy, frenetic action-comedy of previous Pixar releases and places it in a bigger setting, visually and philosophically. The movie's a consistent delight but you never lose sight of the stakes involved; when the ship tilts off its gravitational axis and the humans pile up against the windows like fat, flopping tuna fish, the image makes you laugh and inhale in horror at the same time. Stanton and company appear to have been studying the work of Japanese animation guru Hayao Miyazaki; while his spiritual dimension is missing, the eco-despair that galvanizes his films "Princess Mononoke" and "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind" is even more keenly felt here.
Everything clicks on the micro level too, from Thomas Newman's exuberant score to the slapstick comedy of the malfunctioning repair-shop bots that assist the heroes (they're lunatics taking over the asylum). Pleasingly, "WALL-E" is aware of its cinematic roots: Aside from the "2001" references, the title character's cozy metallic speech comes courtesy of Ben Burtt, the sound designer who previously provided the voices of R2-D2, Chewbacca, and E.T. It's he who gives us the soul in this new machine.
The end result is, in one of Lasseter's pet phrases, a work of genuine "soopa-genius," but are audiences ready for it? "WALL-E" is an assault on much that we hold dear: our throwaway lifestyle, the belief that high-tech narcosis is our just reward, our corporations and politics (Fred Willard appears in ancient video footage as BnL's "global CEO," vainly urging us to "stay the course"). The mirror it holds up is not a flattering one.
In other words, can you take the kids? The movie's dense by "Finding Nemo" standards, but of course you can, and should. Expect the little ones to be entertained while the larger themes lodge subcutaneously; expect older kids to marvel and be a little saddened and want to have long discussions on the ride home. Expect some adults to be scared silly, others to be confused, still others to clap their hands with joy at a toy story that dares to say things our grown-up movies don't. The nagging, almost misanthropic vision at the core of "WALL-E" may ultimately cause it to be Pixar's most admired movie rather than its most well-loved. For now, it's simply the best.


There's a way to measure how well an animated film takes over your imagination. Do you forget, during the movie, that you're even watching animation? Do the textures and settings, the fantasyland characters, become  for lack of a better word  real? That, or something close to it, is what happened to me during WALL-E , the puckishly inventive, altogether marvelous new digitally animated feature from Pixar. The movie sets us down in a rusty, postapocalyptic urban desert, all glaring sun and junk-heap skyscrapers, where the only living thing, or at least the only thing that moves, is WALL-E, a cute, squat robot with droopy binocular eyes whose name stands for Waste Allocation Load-Lifter Earth-Class. That's a very fancy way of saying that WALL-E is a roving trash compactor  and, in fact, he's the last of his breed. Hundreds of years after humans fled the earth, he's still doing what he's been built to do, molding scrap metal into bricks and piling them into neat towers.
For a while, WALL-E  is nearly wordless, and the director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo ), stages the early scenes with a gentle, unhurried mystery that is unabashedly Spielbergian. He forges a world that's casually amazing in its tactile metallic grandeur. In Toy Story , computer animation perfectly reproduced the  waxy sheen of plastic playthings, and here, in a comparable way, you feel as if you could reach out and touch all the metal detritus. As a character, WALL-E is like R2-D2 gone Charlie Chaplin in the land of The Road Warrior . Almost everything he does is something he's been programmed to do, but after centuries he's developed stubborn wisps of individuality, like his penchant for plopping in a scratchy videotape of the 1969 Hollywood version of Hello, Dolly!  WALL-E  uses several of that film's musical numbers (in particular, the gorgeous ''It Only Takes a Moment'') in a way that's at once tenderly romantic and almost Kubrickishly eerie.
After a while, a spaceship lands, and WALL-E meets EVE, a frictionless white pod with cathode-ray eyes who's been sent to earth to search for organic life. (Her name stands for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator.) These two don't talk, exactly, but they hold hands and burble each other's names. It's love at first mechanized heartbeep.
WALL-E  is a movie you want to discover, but without giving too much away, I'll just say that the early ''silent movie'' section, quietly enticing as it is, is merely the prelude to an eye-boggling future-shock adventure. WALL-E himself is an antique mascot lost in a digital universe; it's up to him to save a spacebound colony of humans who've ''evolved'' into hilariously infantile technology-junkie couch potatoes. Yet even as the movie turns pointedly, and resonantly, satirical, it never loses its heart. I'm not sure I'd trust anyone, kid or adult, who didn't get a bit of a lump in the throat by the end of WALL-E , a film that brings off what the best (and only the best) Pixar films have: It whisks you to a new world, then makes that world every inch our own.

 The first 40 minutes or so of “Wall-E” — in which barely any dialogue is spoken, and almost no human figures appear on screen — is a cinematic poem of such wit and beauty that its darker implications may take a while to sink in. The scene is an intricately rendered city, bristling with skyscrapers but bereft of any inhabitants apart from a battered, industrious robot and his loyal cockroach sidekick. Hazy, dust-filtered sunlight illuminates a landscape of eerie, post-apocalyptic silence. This is a world without people, you might say without animation, though it teems with evidence of past life.  We’ve grown accustomed to expecting surprises from Pixar, but “Wall-E” surely breaks new ground. It gives us a G-rated, computer-generated cartoon vision of our own potential extinction. It’s  not  the only  film lately to engage this somber theme. As the earth heats up, the vanishing of humanity has become something of a hot topic, a preoccupation shared by directors like Steven Spielberg (“A.I.”), Francis Lawrence (“I Am Legend”), M. Night Shyamalan (“The Happening”) and Werner Herzog. In his recent documentary “Encounters at the End of the World” Mr. Herzog muses that “the human presence on this planet is not really sustainable,” a sentiment that is voiced, almost verbatim, in the second half of “Wall-E.” When the whimsical techies at Pixar and a moody German auteur are sending out the same message, it may be time to pay attention.  Not that “Wall-E” is all gloom and doom. It is, undoubtedly, an earnest (though far from simplistic) ecological parable, but it is also a disarmingly sweet and simple love story, Chaplinesque in its emotional purity. On another level entirely it’s a bit of a sci-fi geek-fest, alluding to everything from “2001” and the “Alien” pictures (via a Sigourney Weaver voice cameo) to “Wallace and Gromit: A Grand Day Out.” But the movie it refers to most insistently and overtly is, of all things, “Hello, Dolly!,” a worn videotape that serves as the title character’s instruction manual in matters of choreography and romance.  That old, half-forgotten musical, with its Jerry Herman lyrics crooned by, among others, Louis Armstrong, is also among Wall-E’s mementos of, well, us. He is a dented little workhorse who, having outlasted his planned obsolescence, spends his days in the Sisyphean, mechanical labor of gathering and compacting garbage. His name is an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter- Earth Class. But not everything he finds is trash to Wall-E. In the rusty metal hulk where he and the cockroach take shelter from dust storms, he keeps a carefully sorted collection of treasures, including Zippo lighters, nuts and bolts, and a Rubik’s Cube.  Wall-E’s tender regard for the material artifacts of a lost civilization is  understandable.  After all, he too is a product of human ingenuity. And the genius of “Wall-E,” which was   directed by the Pixar mainstay Andrew Stanton, who wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon, lies in its notion that creativity and self-destruction are sides of the same coin. The human species was driven off its home planet —  Wall-E eventually learns that we did not die out —  by an economy consecrated to the manufacture and consumption of ever more stuff. But some of that stuff turned out to be useful, interesting, and precious. And some of it may even possess something like a soul.  Observing Wall-E’s surroundings, the audience gleans that, in some bygone time, a conglomerate called BnL (for “Buy N Large”) filled the earth with megastores and tons of garbage. Eventually the corporation loaded its valued customers onto a space station (captained by Jeff Garlin),  where they have evolved into fat, lazy leisure addicts serviced by a new generation of specialized machines. One of these, a research probe named Eve (all of the robot names are acronyms as well as indicators of theoretical gender) drops to Earth and wins Wall-E’s heart.  Their courtship follows some familiar patterns. If “Wall-E” were a romantic comedy, it would be about a humble garbageman who falls for a supermodel who also happens to be a top scientist with a knack for marksmanship. (I’m pretty sure I reviewed that a while back, but the title escapes me.) Wall-E is a boxy machine of the old school, with creaks and clanks and visible rivets, his surface pocked with dents and patches of rust. He is steadfast, but not always clever or cool. Eve, shaped like an elongated egg, is as cool as the next iPhone and whisper quiet, unless she’s excited, in which case she has a tendency to blow things up. She and Wall-E communicate in chirps and beeps that occasionally coalesce into words. Somehow their expressions — of desire, irritation, indifference, devotion and anxiety, all arranged in delicate counterpoint —  achieve an otherworldly eloquence.  That they are endowed with such rich humanity is as much a Pixar trademark as the painstakingly modeled surfaces or the classical virtual camerawork and editing. The technical resourcefulness that allows “Wall-E” to leap effortlessly from the derelict Earth to the pristine atmosphere of the space station is matched by the rigorous integrity the filmmakers bring to the characters and the themes.  Rather than turn a tale of environmental cataclysm into a scolding, self-satisfied lecture, Mr. Stanton shows his awareness of the contradictions inherent in using the medium of popular cinema to advance a critique of corporate consumer culture. The residents of the space station, accustomed to being tended by industrious robots, have grown to resemble giant babies, with soft faces, rounded torsos and stubby, weak limbs. Consumer capitalism, anticipating every possible need and swaddling its subjects in convenience, is an infantilizing force. But as they cruise around on reclining chairs, eyes fixed on video screens, taking in calories from straws sticking out of giant cups, these overgrown space babies also look like moviegoers at a multiplex.  They’re us, in other words. And like us, they’re not all bad. The paradox at the heart of “Wall-E” is that the drive to invent new things and improve the old ones — to buy and sell and make and collect — creates the potential for disaster and also the possible path away from it. Or, put another way, some of the same impulses that fill the world of “Wall-E” — our world — with junk can also fill it with art.

Pixar's ninth consecutive wonder of the animated world is a simple yet deeply imagined piece of speculative fiction. Despite the decade-plus since its inception, "Wall-E" is a film very much of its moment, although in a cheeky, uninsistent way; it has plenty to say, but does so in a light, insouciant manner that allows you to take the message or leave it on the table. Adroitly borrowing from many artistic sources and synthesizing innumerable influences, Pixar stalwart Andrew Stanton's first directorial outing since "Finding Nemo" walks a fine line between the rarefied and the immediately accessible as it explores new territory for animation, yet remains sufficiently crowd-pleasing to indicate celestial B.O. for this G-rated summer offering.
Sci-fi films have offered up an endless supply of robots and droids, just as they have imagined numerous visions of post-apocalyptic Earthscapes, and both elements are central to "Wall-E." But how many films, sci-fi or otherwise, have proposed a future human civilization populated by people so fat that they can't raise themselves from their mobile chairs, in which they sit connected to phones, screens and super-sized cups? One can't help but speculate about the perverse prospect of plus-sized multiplexers laughing at these genuinely funny scenes while digging into their popcorn and slurping their sodas.
On its most elementary level, "Wall-E" is a wistful robot-meets-robot love story, in which two lonely and compatible souls, if that is an applicable term, meet in utterly against-the-odds circumstances. It's 700 years since humans have vacated planet Earth, for unspecified reasons, and the only active inhabitants of a once-major American city are the title character -- a small trash compactor on treads -- and his pet cockroach. 
To modern audiences, the amber-hued vistas of the abandoned metropolis will recall the effective opening stretch of "I Am Legend," although the city here has been dead for so long that parts of it have become overgrown in the manner of Mayan ruins. Also, Wall-E has been so industrious that he (the gender is suggested, if not verified) has built neat piles of compacted metal that rival the deteriorated skyscrapers in height and architectural distinction.
Although others of his ilk (officially, Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) have fallen by the wayside, Wall-E, who consists of binocular-like eyes and claw-arms attached to an adaptable box frame atop triangular treads, has clearly been built to last and only needs a blast of sunlight to recharge. He's a collector who lives in a tchotchke-filled space that resembles a larger version of himself, and he's got a single VHS tape, of "Hello, Dolly!" of all things, to keep him company and instruct him in the ways of human courtship.
Unexpectedly, Wall-E soon needs some social skills due to the spaceship arrival of Eve (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). A flying white robot (voiced by Elissa Knight) who roughly resembles a plastic penguin with a black monitor for a face and a head, body and limbs that, disarmingly, don't physically connect, Eve is a superior being in every respect. She spars physically with Wall-E, who would probably fall for any creature to come his way but quickly develops a yen to hold her hand -- for him, the ultimate consummation of desire.
One of Stanton's bold strokes is to withhold any "dialogue," such as it is, for 16 minutes, a decision surely made long before the appearance of a similar strategy in "There Will Be Blood." Albeit accompanied by Thomas Newman's fine score, which provides notable support throughout, this is a silent movie for nearly the length of an old two-reeler, one that combines sobering physical spectacle with sight gags to odd and charming effect.
Everything changes when the object of Eve's mission, a single green sprout, is uncovered, signaling the return of photosynthesis to Earth. This momentous news must be delivered to humanity posthaste, and when Eve blasts off, Wall-E latches onto her ship's exterior.
Having focused on these two characters for nearly an hour, the film shifts into more familiar, boisterous gear upon arrival at the monstrous craft Axiom, a virtual nation in space that has been gleefully conceived and detailed to a degree that could be called malicious if it weren't so genial. It's a world run entirely by machines, to the extent that human beings have turned into floating couch potatoes too lethargic to move even if they wanted to. These Earthlings have turned into full-time consumers with no collective memory of where they came from or what life consists of outside their artificial compound.
All the same, when the equally listless ship's captain (an amusing Jeff Garlin) learns what Eve has brought back, he knows it's at last time for Operation Recall, the return of human beings to Earth. The problem is, are these people ready, willing and able to get off their giant butts and whip their distant homeland back into shape?
That, presumably, could be addressed in a sequel. In the meantime, "Wall-E" pushes an agenda that could, and no doubt will, be interpreted as "green," or ecologically minded. It's a theme that is certainly present, at least as pertains to what forced humanity off the planet in the first place. But in a bigger sense, the picture seems to be making a quiet pitch for taking clear-headed responsibility for the health of the planet as well as one's body and mind.
The adages about how you must lie in the bed you make, and you are what you eat, both would seem to apply here. But Stanton, his co-story hatcher Pete Docter, co-scenarist Jim Reardon and the entire Pixar team operate on the principle that entertainment values come first, and they have applied it throughout to sprightly effect.
Almost certainly, "Wall-E" stands as the first animated film in which the sound designer/editor/mixer also voices the leading role. One can hear echoes of R2-D2, a character for which Ben Burtt created the "voice," in the peculiar sounds he bestows upon the little robot here. Although there is significant pranking and foolishness among the leading characters as well as the "rogue robots" on board the Axiom, there is considerably less dialogue than in the generally talkative Pixar films, which creates a significant difference in feel.
A major distinction in message and tone between this and most related sci-fi is that, for a story rooted in an apocalypse, "Wall-E" is very optimistic. Yes, the worst will come, whatever it is, but humanity will, no matter what, be able to reconnect with its roots. This is good to know.
As expected from Pixar, the picture looks great, and cannot have suffered from having the great cinematographer Roger Deakins on board as a visual consultant.


Many will attempt to describe WALL-E  with a one-liner. Its R2-D2 in love. 2001: A Space Odyssey  starring The Little Tramp. An Inconvenient Truth  meets Idiocracy  on its way to Toy Story . But none of these do justice to a film thats both breathtakingly majestic and heartbreakingly intimateand, for a good long while, absolutely bereft of dialogue save the squeals, beeps, and chirps of a sweet, lonely robot who, aside from his cockroach pet, is the closest thing to the last living being on earth.
Cobbled from so many familiar spare partsfrom Star Wars  to Buster Keaton  to Tron  to the Marx Brothers WALL-E  feels, here and there, formulaic: Lonely boy and sexy girl meet cute, fall in love, save the planet. Its a lifetime of celluloid memories cut and pasted into a spiffy computer program that buffs off the rough edges and leaves us with the shiny, sumptuous brand-new. Writer-director Andrew Stanton , among the founding fathers of the Pixar  Empire, even admits as much. In the press materials, he name-checks all of the above, plus Alien  and Blade Runner  and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
Such reverence for movie history in general and sci-fi in particular is vital to the story, because its what ultimately gives WALL-E  its wow factor and its weightthis reinvigoration of the past on the way to the future of filmmaking. (Charlie Chapin   in space .) The foundation allows Stanton to turn an almost stale story into something approaching the abstract, as the film insists that you do as much work as it does. It needs you to fill in its gaps, which are copious when the movies star is nothing more than binoculars perched upon a metal box hauled around by worn-out treads. (Fact is, WALL-E is little more than Number 5 from 1986s Short Circuit , freed from the tyrannical shackles of Steve Guttenberg  and Ally Sheedy . About time.) It demands that the audience connect the dots, if only to see the smile of a lipless robot. Kids, of course, will be tickled by this silly robot. Also, at times, they will be absolutely confounded and even a little bored.
Stanton, pinning his hopes on a nearly mute trashcan, needs the audience to buy in early. Wisely, he opens with a warm touch: Put on Your Sunday Clothes from the Hello, Dolly!  soundtrackOut there /Theres a world outside of Yonkers /Way out there/Beyond this hick townplays as the virtual camera (piloted by Coen brothers  collaborator Roger Deakins ) rockets the audience toward a Planet Earth thats a smoky shade of decay, its cities a wonderland of trash and rubble tended to by a compact compactor whos kept company by the last surviving roach and a fading sun. There are skyscrapers of scrap as high as the high-rises abandoned by humans 700 years ago, or some time in the 22nd century, when the morons in charge of the planet killed it and then ditched it rather than cleaning it up. (Playing the CEO leader of the world at the time of Earths eventual give-up, Fred Willard  does one, maybe two presidents named Bush.)
WALL-E (a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is the sad creature charged with piling up all the detritus. Carcasses of his robotic siblings litter the streets of the former megalopolis in which WALL-E roams solo, as though he is Legend. After work, WALL-E retires to his bachelor hovel, his only companions the rescued trash (a Rubiks Cube, lawn gnomes, rubber ducks) and a videotape of Hello, Dolly!  Oh, and the roach, still living off Twinkies  seven centuries into the no-future future. All WALL-E wants is someone to hold hands with, like they did in 1960s musicals.
The sadness is palpable; your heart breaks for the heartless. WALL-E speaks through Ben Burttthe very same man who, 31 years ago, turned a garbage can into a teddy bear when he designed the voice of R2-D2. (Burtt is among just seven voice credits in a film that only has substantial dialogue sequences in its final half hour.) WALL-E eventually meets EVE (an Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, voiced by Elissa Knight ), who arrives in what looks like Boba Fett s ship to scour the earth per her directive and ultimately, accidentally, provides the little dude with some companybut not before a courtship period that involves his almost being incinerated a few times.
So evocative and effective are the early sequences involving the twoespecially the first time he brings her back to his pad, their only exchange of words thus far a stuttered recitation of acronymsthat by the time the pair wind up in space, where the humans have taken refuge, it almost feels like a letdown. Because then youre transported back to Pixarland, where instead of blessed silence interrupted by the occasional coo, its Sigourney Weaver  and Jeff Garlin , and (heh-heh, not again ) John Ratzenberger  chattering and barking away.
Stanton, having run out of road with the romance on earth, moves heavenward, and for the first time his film feels earthbound. After 700 years confined in the hermetically sealed space-cruiser Utopia, living off advertisements and milkshakes, humanitys turned globular to the point of immobility. But the parodys too easy; besides, Woody Allen  and Mike Judge  (the latter with his garbage avalanche) got there first.
But WALL-E  will not be remembered by childrenor the adults for whom WALL-E  is really intendedfor its tsk-tsking environmental policy or its Naomi Klein  polemics. Rather, youll adore it because of a cuddly, lonely little robot who breaks your beeping heart.
