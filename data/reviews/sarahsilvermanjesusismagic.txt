         Sarah Silverman has a bright, toothy smile; a sweet, innocent demeanor; and the most outrageously impious sense of humor of any comedian working today. And I don't just mean she's dirty. (She's filthy.) She makes fun of things other comedians wouldn't acknowledge, let alone mock.
 
  It's easy to misunderstand Silverman (if you're inclined to), as the head of an Asian American watchdog group did when he publicly denounced her for using an ethnic slur in a joke on network television. The joke was not an ethnic joke, but a joke about the selective use of slurs. (There's an unspoken hierarchy of acceptability, she suggests, which is mainly fear-based). The incident tacked on another punch line to her punch line:
 


         






    "What kind of world do we live where a totally cute white girl can't say 'chink' on network television? As a member of the Jewish community ... I'm totally concerned we're losing control of the media."
 
  Silverman's fictional persona is that of a faux-naif whose deep-seated awfulness is only heightened by the lip service she pays to political correctness. She makes fun of bigotry by pretending to be a bigot; hypocrisy by pretending to be a hypocrite; and stupidity by pretending to be dumb. Her nice-girl naivete enables her to poke fun at the most grotesque attitudes that lurk under the surface of society by pretending to be well-intentioned — everybody's favorite excuse.
 
  Her formula hardly ever varies and never fails: She says something terrible, and it immediately dawns on her that she's said something terrible. Then she tries to clear it up with something worse."Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic" is a filmed stand-up show book-ended by two hilarious skits skewering the clench-toothed envy cloaked in support that passes as a social life for the average creative striver. At the start of the movie she squirms as two friends (her sister Laura Silverman and Brian Posehn) regale her with tales of landed pilots, upcoming albums and sold scripts. Desperate to get out of there without looking like a loser, she blurts out that she has a show opening later that night — a musical about AIDS and the Holocaust, but funny.
 
  After an inspired number in which she determines, MGM-style, to make the show happen and make herself the star, the movie settles into her stand-up routine — all "Nana was at one of the better concentration camps," and "they're treating the unions that de-bone the Ethiopian babies really badly." The stand-up act is punctuated with yet more musical numbers, backed by her band the Silver Men, like a cheerful song called "You're Gonna Die Soon" in a retirement home; or wonders why any Jew would drive a German car, which leads into a dead-on lampooning of the idea of reclaiming pejoratives that remain offensive in all but the most specific contexts.
 
  It's not as though she's not sensitive though. She cries while watching those C.A.R.E. commercials that feature "1- and 2-year-old babies, 9 months pregnant." The only reason she doesn't send money is because she doesn't want them spending it on drugs. "Learn-medy" she calls it.

If you're going to say the unsayable and stay charming while doing so, it helps to look more like Sarah Silverman than Andrew Dice Clay. Silverman, who presents herself as the world's naughtiest nice Jewish girl, has porcelain skin, a silky cascade of straight black hair, and a slightly devilish but still wholesome smile that beams like a headlight through the darkness of a concert hall; she's like the anti-shiksa Ali MacGraw. Silverman would be a singular talent even if she wasn't beautiful, but it would be foolish to deny that watching a stand-up comedian who resembles the world's sexiest art-history major toss off one-liners about porn stars, doo-doo, Nazis, and the politics of white people trying to cozy up to African Americans by calling them ''n-----s'' exerts its own nasty-cuddly-freaky appeal. Silverman makes her attractiveness relevant by delivering each scathing, oooo-did-she-really-say-that? joke as if it were a come-on. She's flirtatious in her outrage: a stand-up coquette.
At the start of Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic , a concert film with musical numbers, she performs a catchy neo-'60s pop ditty about how excited she is to put on a show, and for all the intentional stupidity of the lyrics, her ironic eagerness is infectious. Then, on stage, she launches into the world according to Silverman. ''I was raped by a doctor,'' she says in a voice of confessional flatness. ''Which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl.'' Score! Even in our politically incorrect times, that's the tasteless equivalent of shock and awe: a joke that tweaks, and detonates, two taboos at once. When she's on, Silverman, with her willingness to say anything, can be liberating: a bomb-tossing jester in the blasphemous-and-proud-of-it tradition of Lenny Bruce and Howard Stern.
For all her fearlessness and talent, though, there's a crucial way, in Jesus Is Magic , that she falls short of those artists. On the concert stage, Silverman drifts in a dreamy daze from one topic to the next, consciously parading  and ridiculing  her princessy narcissism. For her, the tragedy of 9/11 is that it was the day she learned her beloved soy chai latte had 900 calories. She sings to a group of retirement-home folks, ''You're gonna die soon!'' And so on. The trouble with narcissism as a comic theme is that it starts to hem in one's responses to the outside world. Silverman's racial humor gooses forbidden stereotypes yet never reaches beyond those stereotypes. African Americans, in her act, are little more than layabouts and threats. We never hear her experiences  just the clichés that have floated into her brain. Ditto her feelings about sex. She's very funny when she describes blending jelly and fellatio and then worries that she's turning into her mother, but unlike, say, Richard Pryor or Margaret Cho, she leaves any true observations about sex or relationships off stage. The closest she comes to voicing a conviction of any kind is her rather creaky belief that Jews should refrain from buying German cars. In Jesus Is Magic , Sarah Silverman reveals her own head to be an intermittently hilarious place, but she'd do well to take a trip or two outside it.

 In "The Aristocrats," Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza's brilliant essay-film on the world's dirtiest joke, Sarah Silverman provides one of the few genuinely unsettling and provocative moments. Stripping away the frame ("A guy walks into a talent agent's office ..."), she tells the joke from inside, from the perspective of someone for whom it is not funny at all. Which makes it funnier than ever, as well as decidedly squirm-inducing.  In "Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic," she tries, with mixed results, for a similar effect. The film, directed by Liam Lynch, is basically a recording of a one-woman show Ms. Silverman performed last year at a North Hollywood theater, with a few musical numbers and backstage sequences thrown in for the sake of variety. The songs include a mocking ode to the stars of pornographic movies, which Ms. Silverman performs in a velvet evening gown; a perky sendup  of racial sensitivities; and a version of "Amazing Grace" in three-part multi-orifice harmony.  Ms. Silverman's comedy is built, to a large extent, on the discrepancies between her appearance and her material. It's not just that she is reasonably pretty. She also comes across, at least at first, as nice, smart and responsible - the kind of girl (never mind that she is almost 35) your parents would encourage you to be friends with or to take to the prom, more teacher's pet than Heather.  But then she opens her mouth, and the vilest, filthiest things you've ever heard come pouring out of it. Scatology! Baby killing! Masturbation!  Shocking, isn't it? Most of the humor in "Jesus Is Magic" depends on the scandal of hearing a nice, middle-class Jewish girl make jokes about rape, anal sex, the Holocaust and AIDS. She makes fun of religion. She riffs on 9/11. But Ms. Silverman is not smashing taboos so much as she is desperately searching for them. Her pauses and quick reversals of tone, her way of inserting the point of a joke parenthetically into a deceptively rambling delivery or arriving at it a few beats late - the rhythms of her act suggest a desire to catch the audience off guard, to find its unprotected soft spots.  But the audience, at least in North Hollywood and probably at movie theaters as well, is way ahead of her. It laughs happily at everything she says, even before she has turned the queasiness into humor. She has only to utter the sentence "I was raped," and the crowd bursts into chuckles, before she has even converted the setup into a punch line. In other words, those in her audience are comfortable, which means that the performer has to act out discomfort on their behalf, supplying her own awkward silences and moments of hesitation. Ms. Silverman is good at this - her gift for mimicking the prevailing modern tones and idioms of piety, hypocrisy and wounded innocence is considerable - but she may be working a little too hard.  The tradition she wants to join is that of Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, and in some ways she faces greater challenges than they did. Not just because she is a woman in a profession defined and dominated by men, but also because it is not as easy as it used to be to separate the hip from the square. What Bruce did with obscenity and Mr. Pryor - especially in his first concert film - did with race was to find the outer boundary of the audience's tolerance and push beyond it, confronting and confusing the satisfied self-image of the liberal, sophisticated public.  This kind of transgression has long since become ritualized and normalized, and Ms. Silverman's act is the latest evidence that mocking political correctness has become a form of political correctness in its own right. Her version of insult humor is actually flattering, both to herself and to those who find it funny. She depends on the assumption that only someone secure in his or her own lack of racism would dare to make, or to laugh at, a racist joke, the telling of which thus becomes a way of making fun simultaneously of racism and of racial hyper-sensitivity. (Like many young, otherwise deracinated Jewish comedians, Ms. Silverman falls back on her ethnic identity as a way of claiming ready-made outsider status.)  Everything she says is delivered through enough layers of self-consciousness - air quotes wrapped in air quotes - to make anyone who finds it offensive look like a sucker. She even makes fun of the idea that she might be thought of as an "edgy" comedian. And indeed she isn't. Ms. Silverman is a skilled performer, and "Jesus Is Magic" is occasionally very funny, but don't be fooled: naughty as she may seem, she's playing it safe.

Coming across like the love child of Lenny Bruce and Sandra Bernhard, Sarah Silverman has something to offend everyone in the film rendition of her live performance at North Hollywood's El Portal Theater. "Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic" showcases the comic-actress in her familiar on-stage persona as a blithely self-involved Jewish American Princess whose penchant for perky vulgarity can be explosively funny or unnervingly shocking (and sometimes both, simultaneously). Pic should please longtime fans, and may impress viewers who know Silverman only as a quirky character actress ("The School of Rock," TV's "Greg the Bunny").
Despite occasional cutaways to off-stage skits (featuring, among others, fellow comics Brian Posehn and Bob Odenkirk) and a few deliberately cheesy production numbers, pic remains mostly stagebound as Silverman sounds off on various topics in a freewheeling monologue punctuated with songs. As she comments on the absurdities of a world in which she, and she alone, always should be the center of attention, no subject -- not even 9/11 or the Holocaust -- is off limits.
From the start, Silverman indicates everything and everyone, including herself, is fair game during her unflinching pursuit of big laughs. ("I was raped by a doctor -- which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl.") In fact, she's rarely more hilarious than when she makes herself the punchline of her nastiest cracks. Rail-thin yet full-bosomed, she's sufficiently attractive to infuse her talk of sexual misadventures with none-too-subtle erotic charge.
For some viewers, Silverman's iconoclastic envelope-pushing will be genuinely discomforting, if not completely off-putting. She skates on perilously thin ice as she unapologetically rationalizes her use of language that is, at best, racially insensitive -- and at worst, just plain racist. On the other hand, she diminishes the sting of her tasteless slanguage by reminding the audience that, what the hell, her on-stage persona isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer: "I don't care if you think I'm racist. I just want you to think I'm thin."
Helmer Liam Lynch does a respectable job of using off-stage elements as bridges and counterpoints. To her credit, though, Silverman doesn't cheat during these in-between bits: She remains "in character" even when she's being a backstage prima donna. Her refusal to be easily likable is perversely adorable.

Sarah Silverman 's cartoon bunny rabbit smile could make her the poster child for orthodontia, but it's her timing that's the real thing of beauty. Silverman's quasi-concert doc Jesus Is Magic  opens with the star tediously regaled by a pair of Hollywood  wannabes (one played by her sister). Defensively, she dreams up her own outrageous success storya one-woman musical about AIDS and the Holocaustand then proceeds to stage it. A wicked wittle wabbit who feigns innocence as she courts outrage, Silverman jokes about killing Christ ("I'd fucking do it again in a second if I heard those Birkenstocks  padding up behind me"), makes fun of Martin Luther King , travesties 9-11, and suggests that her grandmother got a "vanity number" at Auschwitz . Her vagina monologue is actually a duet (with a third orifice joining in for the chorus).
Her delivery a seamless blend of psychobabbling TV guest and narcissistic Valley Girl, Silverman never breaks character: "You know what babies love? Ethnic jokes!" In the realm of stand-up Jews, she's neither a Lenny Bruce  philosopher nor a Sandra Bernhard  performance artist. Borderline tiresome, Silverman's racial and sexual obsessions might suggest Jackie Mason  with a pretty face. But really, she's a verbal Jerry Lewis , shamelessly willing to say anything. ("I always feel crappy when I do that joke," she pretends to apologize, "but it gets such a good laugh.") A TV crack got Silverman into trouble with an Asian American media watchdog group. "What kind of world do we live in where a totally cute white girl can't say 'Chink' on network television?" she complains. "It's like the '50stotally scary. As a member of the Jewish community, I was really concerned that we were losing control of the media."
