There are too many Johnny Depps in "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End " and much more Keira Knightley than you were expecting -- so much so that the actress becomes the movie's indisputable star. If this still isn't quite what it takes to strike pirate gold, it sails a lot closer to the wind than last time.
But you want to know about Jack Sparrow, don't you? One half hour into this immense, thundering cinematic knick-knack, just when we're beginning to wonder if anything's going to actually happen
, director Gore Verbinski finally cuts to the good captain. Jack and his ship, the Black Pearl , are marooned in Davy Jones' s Locker , which is, against all expectations, an endless desert.
He has manned the Pearl with dozens of clones of himself, infinitely disposable and mutinously muttering; these turn out to be hallucinations. In the surrounding waste are thousands of small rocks that sprout claws and scuttle sideways; these turn out to be real.
It's a marvelous sequence, nearer to genuine surrealism than anything in the previous "Pirates" or available in other blockbusters this summer, and it underscores what's special about this franchise: damn- the-torpedoes excess, larded on by producer Jerry Bruckheimer without a care for expense or even common sense. These movies go too far -- visually, narratively, abaft and abeam -- and still the filmmakers keep going, headed for the waterfall of spectacle run amok.
If the previous installment, "Dead Man's Chest, " was a classic No. 2, antic and insultingly unresolved, "World's End" tips the ship too far in the opposite direction. The first two hours of this 168-minute leviathan are bafflingly action-free, with more care given to figuring out who in the massive cast is where -- and how, and why -- than is necessary. Where's the parodic spirit of the first "Pirates," a movie that made theme-park cinema seem like a good idea?
"World's End," by contrast, opens with a mass hanging. Pass the popcorn. The going gets grimmer, too, before the movie pops buoyantly back to the surface in its mid-section. Because Verbinski and company have boxed themselves in with so many plot threads, they're forced to direct traffic instead of buckling swashes, and it hurts. Only one actor manages to rise through the flotsam.
Surprise: It's Knightley. Her character, Elizabeth Swann , started the series as a winsome maiden in distress and has only gotten leaner and meaner. In "World's End," the actress looks positively feral as Elizabeth at last assumes the aspect of classic female pirates of yo-ho-ho yore, rising to prominence in battle and barking out orders to make a bos'n quail. She could be Anne Bonney or Mary Reade -- all right, if they had been supermodels -- and the movie plops a Chinese corsair's hat on her head and stands back in unalloyed admiration.
I could tell you what happens in "POTC: At World's End," but Disney made me swear not to (really: a corporate document was handed out at press screenings urging critics and bloggers to avoid plot spoilage). More to the point, no synopsis would make a lick of sense. Here goes, anyway: The horrid Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander ), foppish representative of the East India Company , has joined forces with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy , under a wriggling mass of CGI tentacles) to obliterate the pirates of the seven seas.
Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush , still giving great Long John Silver) wants to convene the Brethren Court -- the nine pirate lords of the globe -- to fight the enemy by unleashing the water goddess Calypso (technically a sea-nymph, but never mind). Elizabeth, by now on equal footing with the buccaneers, would rather make a last stand at sea.
Jack Sparrow, one of those lords despite appearances to the contrary, needs rescuing from the arid wastes of the Locker, and the journey there and back by the other major characters is the focus of the movie's first half. This is capped by a remarkable scene in which the world turns upside down and sunset becomes sunrise; that and the multi-Depp scene mentioned above are the best moments in all of "World's End" (except for a blithe bit of ceremony in the midst of intense action toward the end -- but I can say no more).
Chow Yun-Fat shows up as the sneering Singapore pirate lord Sao Feng , but Verbinski is never sure what to do with the character and the movie drifts close to yellow-peril cliche when he lusts after Elizabeth. While never as purposelessly cluttered as "Dead Man's Chest," "World's End" still has too many marbles rolling on the deck: Elizabeth's one-time fiance, Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport ), trying to decide whether he's a good bad-guy or a bad good-guy; Stellan Skarsgard as Bootstrap Bill Turner , touchingly senile under his cursed crust of seashells; Naomie Harris as the voodoo-spewing Tia Dalma ; Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook as the comic crewmen who are this series' R2-D2 and C-3PO .
They all criss-cross, double-cross, and quadruple-cross each other, and poor Orlando Bloom as Will Turner gets swept to sea with the backwash. The actor's not at fault; the writers just haven't given Will enough to do, so busy are they putting the pirate pants on Elizabeth. Notice I'm not complaining.
Depp, too, is pushed slightly into the background, where he prances engagingly. Jack's less of a wobbly cartoon in this one, and when Keith Richards appears out of nowhere as Captain Teague , a sweetly ridiculous father-son reunion ensues. Richards doesn't even have to act -- his fake nose does it for him -- and when he counsels Jack that the important thing in life is just to survive, a "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie backs into the real world for the first and only time. (Spin off, please.)
Thus while the tenderhearted may mourn the passing of a few of the characters, the truth is such fatalities don't really hurt. The writers can always provide an out if it's a major figure, and anyway, what's death in these movies but a momentary setback?
After several hours of noise, exposition, and a brief detour into "The Attack of the 50-Foot Obeah Woman," "World's End" erupts in a highly satisfying battle between the Black Pearl and Davy Jones' s Flying Dutchman . The two ships swirl around a maelstrom -- it's like they're going down a giant toilet, but the movie doesn't go with them. Rather, it pays off with all the high-tech sound and fury this series has promised and not delivered often enough. Confusing and exhilarating, violent and weirdly bloodless, the sequence is modern Xbox filmmaking at its finest.
Then it's over and you realize there's still another 20 minutes and one more gargantuan battle to go. "The problem with being the last of something is that there's no coming back," says Barbossa at one point, pointedly ignoring recent Hollywood history. You can bet your parrot "Pirates" will be back, even if "At World's End" hasn't the foggiest idea when to quit.


         The third 'Pirates of the Caribbean' has plenty of . . . It's possible that someone, somewhere, has put together a flowchart or diagram tracking the many plots, subplots, digressions, divagations and flights of whimsy in "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," which, depending on your tolerance for Byzantine complication for complication's sake, might have been alternately titled "At Wit's End."
 
 The third in a series that appears to be hinting at immortality in more ways than one, "Pirates 3" demands intimate knowledge of the first two installments, not to mention a sterling memory and attention span. In other words, it pays to be prepared. Seriously, this thing is a stern master — walk in casually off the street and you risk nearly three hours of very high-octane confusion.
 


         






   For the diligent and the faithful, however, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, laboring under the bombastic tutelage of Jerry Bruckheimer, have assembled another collection of exciting set-pieces with bellowed dialogue in between. Exciting, distracting and quite possibly permanently concentration impairing, what "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" offers is a wonderfully scenic medley of impressive action sequences so lengthy, elaborate and numerous that remembering what came before becomes a kind of test of mental focus. Me, I failed it, but then, my concentration is shot. If the following plot summary sounds clear and well-ordered, I should probably mention that I consulted secondary materials to help me make sense of what I'd just seen. Any ensuing clarity, in other words, shouldn't be taken as a reflection of my addled viewing experience.
 
 At the beginning of the film, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), chairman of the East India Trading Co., has imposed martial law, suspended habeas corpus and begun rounding up suspected insurgents — or rather, pirates — and systematically hanging them regardless of sex, age or the condition of their teeth.
 
 Those who remember the end of the last film will recall that when we last left our growing cast of heroes, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and the crew of the Black Pearl were hiding out with the witch Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), who brought Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) back from the dead in order to lead the crew in the rescue of Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who, when we last saw him, was being swallowed by an adipose sea monster called the kraken.
 
 Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Elizabeth, Will and Capt. Barbossa have traveled to Singapore to steal a navigational chart from the Chinese pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Some intra-buccaneerial fighting ensues, but it eventually becomes apparent that they must band together with the other lords of the pirate clans to defeat Beckett and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), whose heart Beckett now possesses.
 
 It's nearly an hour before we lay eyes on Jack Sparrow, marooned on the desert island that is Davy Jones' locker, confronting various doppelgängers and muttering to himself about nosy rocks. Until now, the movie has had a stewy quality — the baroque art direction is impressive but oppressive after a while, and it's hard to see or breathe. Jack's minimalist introduction on a sun-drenched patch of sand is a respite that immediately perks things up.
 
 As before, the main characters' motives are multifarious and usually ulterior: Will wants to save his father and marry Elizabeth, Davy Jones wants his heart back, Beckett wants the chart as well as the "nine pieces of eight" the pirate leaders possess, Jack wants immortality, everyone wants to be captain. None of it, ultimately, matters very much. Like its predecessors, "Pirates 3" is a ride (an improvement on the last one, which looked like a ride) that takes us from Singapore, across a frozen ocean, over a giant waterfall to the surrealist desert, to a constructivist Shipwreck Cove and beyond. We get waterlogged ghosts, removable brains, monkey cannonballs and a 50-foot woman.
 
 All this inter-protagonist squabbling and wanting and pining and plotting just bogs down the spectacle, and I can't describe the depths of my despond as the movie continued to pick up narrative threads past the second hour mark. I almost hate to say it, but at this point why bother with a story at all? We're here for the cheekbones and the swords and the tentacle-faces, and we don't have all day.
 
 In broody moods and Mystic-tanned to near oblivion (Knightley is painted a distracting orange), Bloom and Knightley nevertheless make a nice swashbuckling couple together. Keith Richards makes a desultory appearance as Capt. Teague, Jack's father, but the bit doesn't add much beyond an obligatory meta-nod to Depp's actorly inspiration. As the eternally ambivalent and ambiguous Jack Sparrow, Depp, meanwhile, is the soul of the movie and, as before, completely absconds with the show.
 
 Personally, I'd rather see him dine with relish on half a peanut than sit through yet another CG-whiz sequence, but maybe that's just me.
 
 
 "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End." MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of action/adventure violence and some frightening images. Running time: 2 hours, 47 minutes. In general release. Opens Friday, with evening shows Thursday at some theaters.   

In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End , Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), voyaging back from the Land of the Dead, or Davy Jones' Gym Sock, or whatever the hell the place is called, studies a puzzle map with interlocking circles, which he spins around until they spell a hidden message: ''Up Is Down.'' From that one coded signal, Jack realizes that he must plunge the ship he's sailing into the sea and come out the other side. That's a nifty trick. And, in general, Up Is Down seems a good motto for a Pirates  sequel, which needs every last bit of topsy-turvy spirit.
That spirit is there, early on, in a kiddie head-trip sequence where Jack, still stuck in his undead limbo, hallucinates multiple versions of himself, which he happily kills off. He then thinks that he's seeing  or maybe is  seeing  rocks that turn into crabs, which carry his ship across the desert. (Hey, I don't write this stuff, I just review it.) A bit later, the movie features an elaborately well-staged Mexican standoff, which ends with a monkey holding a gun. And there is also a meeting of the world's pirate lords (they've gathered to fight back against the British), which suggests a Hell's Angels convention with yellower teeth. When Keith Richards, as Jack's matey of a father, finally shows up, for roughly two minutes, brandishing a face that's like melted Silly Putty, he makes Davy Jones, with his squishy tentacled mug, look like a Neutrogena spokesmodel.
Yet along with all of this sprightly nonsense, there is far too much lugubrious nonsense. At World's End  is so frantic and dissociated that it barely pretends to make sense. The Pirates  films, with their merry storm-tossed slapstick, their retro serial corniness, are a bit like the Indiana Jones films, only broader, sloppier, and longer. They make you feel like you're at a Disney theme restaurant with too many enthusiastic waiters. That quality, fun yet exhausting, is exacerbated by the tendency of third-part sequels to feature more conflicts and problems than the previous two installments combined.
It must be that the director, Gore Verbinski, and the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, are overcompensating. Just about every character in At World's End  comes with his or her own agenda, and the movie grows top-heavy as we attempt to keep track of who's trying to accomplish what. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is out to free his barnacled father (Stellan Skarsgard); Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) wants to avenge the death of her  father (Jonathan Pryce); Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), with her mondo-zombie accent (''Dare's an eevil undah da sea...''), wants to free the ocean goddess inside her; the heartless squid-face Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) wants, for a moment at least, to rediscover his soft side; the happy raider Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wants to reassert the freewheeling age of pirates; and good old Jack just wants to booze and sail. After At World's End , you'll know how he feels. The movie is two hours and 47 minutes of debts, curses, shape-shifts, and betrayals, most of which leave us baffled because they don't pay off.
The worst news, to me (and maybe I'm in the minority), is that the film returns to the heavy-spirited whimsy of The Curse of the Black Pearl . The follow-up, Dead Man's Chest , was an anomaly of a sequel, in that the entire film took its tone from Johnny Depp's arch, sozzled deviltry. It was a true tall tale, with cheeky duels out of a '30s Paramount comedy, that terrific sea monster, and that demented chase on the giant wheel (which was like Buster Keaton restaged by Spielberg). It had a tossed-in-the-air fruitcake quality that worked for audiences like an escape from the  escapism of summer movies. At World's End  lacks that fizzy charm. It's dutiful rather than buoyant.
Depp still clowns like a pickled vamp, using his here-slurry, there-speeded-up delivery to suggest that Jack is a lot smarter than he lets on (or even realizes himself). Yet he holds no more surprise for us. If there's an actor who provides At World's End  with a shot of humanity, it's Bill Nighy. He uses his fiery theatrical rhythms to give Davy Jones a wonderful seething fervor, and I wish the film had played up his poison-love backstory. Instead, we're stuck with a late-in-the-game revival of the Orlando Bloom-Keira Knightley ''chemistry,'' and it's an embarrassment, an admission that this old-fashioned yarn needs romance yet, in effect, has none. Knightley's Elizabeth becomes a pirate captain this time. You know a franchise has run its course when it has a buccaneer heroine who looks as if she'd hate to get her face smudged.

 Correction Appended  “The immaterial has become material,” announces the East India Company’s scheming Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) early in “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End.” He could be referring to the recent resurrection of the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), flush with life and his expanded role in the trilogy. Or he could be speaking of his newfound dominion over the Flying Dutchman and its squid-faced captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), whose excavated heart is now in Beckett’s possession.  More likely, though, the words are a subliminal reassurance from the director, Gore Verbinski. After the bloated shenanigans of the previous entry, “Dead Man’s Chest” — perhaps the only pirate movie to see the need for a Ferris wheel — Mr. Verbinski is reminding us why we should ever trust him again.  This third and perhaps final episode in the swishy, swashbuckling saga goes some way toward achieving that goal. The cannibals, coconuts and landlocked locations have been replaced by the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. And the palpable relief as the myriad plotlines rush toward some semblance of resolution has made everyone quite giddy; even our passion-deferred lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), appear marginally less bored with each other. Or at least less bored than we are with them.  Filmed sequentially with its predecessor, “At World’s End” is less concerned with ends than inversions, presenting a society where the lawless practice democracy and their rulers engage in tyranny. The crown has declared a state of emergency, civil rights have been suspended, and naysayers are lined up to be hanged.  In one of the film’s most bizarre sequences, the condemned begin to sing, belting out a dirge among the rolling tumbrils and swaying nooses. (Tardy audience members may think they’ve stumbled into a performance of “Les Misérables” by mistake.) The song reaches Elizabeth, in a skiff heading for the Pirate Brethren Court in Shipwreck Cove, and for a while the movie becomes a watery opera with a distinctly Oriental flavor.  By the time Chow Yun-Fat appears, as the grumpy pirate lord Sao Feng — complete with an entourage of old-Hollywood coolies — the Gilbert and Sullivan vibe is beginning to wear. After electing Elizabeth pirate king (the Brethren know who wears the trousers in this trilogy), the pirates set out to clobber the British before Davy Jones and his seafood-combo crew can do the same to them.  This will require the help of the priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), whose role has clarified but whose diction remains unintelligible. “Therr is a cahst to be ped en thah end,” she warns mysteriously, mangling her vowels like a voodoo version of Inspector Clouseau.  Having blown Tia up to Godzilla size, however, the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have no further use for her; in her new incarnation as the sorceress Calypso she amounts to little more than crabs and raging wind. Considering she is afforded only one conjugal visit every 10 years —and that from a man who breathes through a blowhole — her bad temper is entirely understandable.  But what of Johnny Depp’s Capt. Jack Sparrow? Following his unfortunate encounter with a giant cephalopod at the end of the last movie, this one finds him trapped and hallucinating in Davy Jones’s Locker, an arid limbo of rolling dunes and raging heat. Because he is Jack, his hallucinations are all about himself (the real love affair in these movies has always been between Jack and his mirror), and Mr. Verbinski fills the screen with an army of mincing clones in kohl eyeliner and fancy head scarves.  Forever above the fray and beside the point, Mr. Depp’s devilish buccaneer  is the lightfooted device that holds the franchise together; as he sashays from battle to bar, impervious to insult and musket alike, Jack’s very narcissism is his protection. He’s an inverse superhero.  Though the film is filled with the expected special-effects wizardry, its most stunning and surreal moments are also the most peaceful: an army of crabs transporting the Black Pearl over dunes and into the ocean, and a flaming sunrise viewed through tattered seaweed sails. A disappointing cameo by Keith Richards, still alive and flaunting the look of hard-won dissipation that reportedly  inspired Jack’s personal style, is in a special-effects category of its own. Perhaps he should have rented a copy of “Performance” and taken notes from Mick Jagger.  Because of the abundance of unpleasant human characters, all of whom lie, cheat and betray one another at the drop of a flounder, the burden of creating an emotional connection with the audience must be borne, ironically, by characters whose humanity has long since evaporated. From the pathos of Davy — still playing the organ like an invertebrate Phantom of the Opera — to the tragic yearning in the barnacle-encrusted face of Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” reminds us that great acting can transcend even the most elaborate makeup.  Even so, if the story is to continue, its creators will need more than Jack’s limp wrists and Will’s limp resolve. In the prophetic words of Barbossa, “There’s never a guarantee of comin’ back, but passin’ on — that’s certain.”    “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scary battles, scary monsters and even scarier rock musicians.

The third voyage in the "Pirates" trilogy could be touted as "the biggest, loudest and second-best (or second-worst) 'Pirates' ever!" -- not necessarily a ringing endorsement, but honest. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" clocks in at more than 2� hours, but, unlike last year's bloated sequel, at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent -- if no less numbing during the protracted finale. A bountiful opening is assured. The running time could diminish this swashbuckler's staying power, but Disney would likely leap at "Pirates IV" in a heartbeat if the principals would enlist for another tour at sea.
In a sense, the two "Pirates" sequels feel less like movies than a shared event -- much like a concert where the audience sits patiently through lesser known numbers to hear the band belt out favorite tunes. A similar phenomenon occurs during the arid stretches (and there are several) in this sprawling, messy adventure, to be endured until Johnny Depp does something flamboyantly amusing or a new face like Keith Richards or Chow Yun-fat graces the screen.
The notion of "Pirates" as, foremost, a consumer product came through loud and clear in the current Entertainment Weekly, in which director Gore Verbinski referred to the screwy process of shooting the second and much of the third movie simultaneously as "How Not to Make a Film 101."
At one point, when a character asks of Depp's loopy Capt. Jack Sparrow, "Do you think he plans it out or just makes it up as he goes along?," it's hard not to wonder if Verbinski and his writing collaborators, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, aren't slipping in a sly comment about the film itself.
Whatever quaint underpinnings there were to the class-divided romance between Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) have dissipated in the journey since the 2003 original, as their relationship goes through a series of fits, starts and betrayals -- all in this movie alone.
Picking up where the second left off (though a refresher course wouldn't hurt), the couple and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) begin in Singapore, where they and their pirate mates hope to liberate Jack from Davy Jones' Locker, a surreal realm between purgatory and hell. A lengthy battle ensues before the too-long quest to find Jack leads to a colorful international assembly of pirates at Shipwreck City, with the East India Trading Co.'s hissable nobleman Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) in hot pursuit and a final showdown inevitable.
That questions of life and death are somewhat fungible here helps mitigate the high level of carnage, which includes a mass hanging sequence at the outset, as Beckett wages a reign of terror in seeking to bring the pirates to heel.
Beckett's arsenal also features the Flying Dutchman, the seemingly indestructible ghost ship captained by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, seen fleetingly outside of his way-cool octopus visage). But can Will, Elizabeth and Jack defeat Jones and Beckett -- and unfetter Will's dad (Stellan Skarsgard), a barnacle-encrusted soul under Jones' spell -- without sacrificing someone on their side, given that slaying Jones requires that somebody take his place aboard the doomed vessel?
For the most part, those big themes and even the fundamental rules are easily obscured by the cacophony of relentless, state-of-the-art special effects and Hans Zimmer's equally unremitting score, which at times overwhelms the dialogue. Indeed, repetitive action from multiple cannon-firing battles to ship-sucking vortexes yield diminishing returns; the pic's greatest virtue is its sense of whimsy, whether that involves multiple Depps debating himself or the crew's slapstick antics, which wring considerable mileage out of that monkey and parrot.
Depp's fey, morally challenged buccaneer remains a kick and the pic's biggest asset, whereas the now-butt-kicking Elizabeth and conflicted Will -- however dreamy -- have grown tiresome, especially when saddled with stirring, Errol Flynn-style "Avast, me hearties!" interludes.
In musing about the Land of the Dead, Barbossa suggests that getting there isn't the tough part; "It's getting back." Given that producer Jerry Bruckheimer's crew unlocked the secret to spinning riches out of a theme-park attraction, in this case getting there was no small feat. It's returning there that has been something of a chore -- a course "At World's End" steadies but can't entirely reverse.

And so Disney 's immense, booty-busting, pro-piracy epic has come to an End . I doubt very much that Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End  is, in fact, the last we'll be seeing of Captain Jack Sparrow  and, you know, all those other people. How could it be? Treasure remains to be squeezed from Planet Earth, great swaths of which are evidently held captive by the grip of this imbecilic Giant Squid. Far be it from me to spoil the conclusion of the picture, which may or may not hint at adventures to come. Not that I could even if I tried: Long before the third, fourth, or fifth climax in this endless, obligatory summer diversion, I slunk into my seat in a passive, inattentive stupor, fully submitting to the fact that I hadnt the slightest idea what the hell was going on.
POTC:AWE is a lukewarm maelstrom of secret agendas, double crossings, tricky alliances, back stabbings, familial complications, romantic entanglements, political conspiracies, warring factions, hidden gods, cheeky monkeys, and excessive eyelinersome of which is linked to events from the previous installments, some of which is freshly pulled out of the collective ass of director Gore Verbinski  and writers Ted Elliott  and Terry Rossio, and none of which is the least bit captivating or, by and large, comprehensible.
The story, such as it is, begins with the rescue of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp ) from the Locker of Davy Jones  (Bill Nighy ), doomed captain of the Flying Dutchman, master of the crusty Fish Pirates, owner of the most repellently vigorous facial hair in modern movies. The Locker, a/k/a death, is a kind of 16th century, white-on-white Matrix in which Sparrow, intuiting himself as the most entertaining figure in existence, hallucinates the antics of several dozen Sparrow doppelgangers, while stranded beside the Black Pearl ship in an abstract expanse of desert.
Boring Will Turner  (Orlando Bloom ), plucky Elizabeth Swann  (Keira Knightley ), and blustery Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush ) effect his rescue through a keen understanding of the peculiar metaphysic ruling the Pirates  universe: randomly generated nonsense. Thus, by plunging their vessel over a watery precipice, they are damply landed on a tropical beach upon which legions of industrious crabs, neatly hatched from smooth white stones, are hustling the Black Pearl ship overland to meet the rescue party. Via another application of the Whatever Principle, our heroes will exit the Locker and embark in the direction of additional inexplicabilities.
Ah, but I have forgotten Captain Sao Feng ! Luxuriating in the hysterical chinoiserie  of his exotic Singapore  lair, this outrageous Oriental (played by Chow Yun-Fat ) has been wedged into the Pirates panoply in order to exude colorful slant-eyed menace, enable the destiny of a white woman, then die. Impaled by one of the many large wood splinters incessantly flung about the narrative, Sao Feng bestows a totem of Super Piratehood to Miss Swann. Off she goes to join a reunion of the Super Pirates  and fend off the snooty imperialists of the Dutch East India Company .
But seriously, who cares. POTC:AWE  isnt a movie so much as a delivery system for two kinds of special effect: those created by computers, and those generated by Johnny Depp. The former peaked with the attack of the Kraken in in Dead Man's Chest . I do rather miss that hefty, peevish sea monster. The transmogrification of voodoo priestess Aunt Jemima oops, I mean Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris )first into a 50-Foot Woman, then into 50,000 digital crabs, and finally into a vast, oceanic drainage is not, alas, as cool as it sounds.
When Depp freaked his funk in The Curse of the Black Pearl , it seemed a sneak attackthe deployment of frisky, flamboyant, softly subversive shenanigans across the cold, impersonal grain of corporate entertainment. Dead Mans Chest  put him in the spotlight and he withered; blooms of such mincing, mascarad rarity depend on nooks and shadows to flourish. At Worlds End  is even more aggressive in flaunting and defanging his spectacle, resorting more than once to the multiplication conceit. Give em what they want has never been so literal, to such diminishing returns.
As for everyone else: The punishing runtime could easily and harmlessly have been abbreviated by removing witless Will Turner, whose sub-Shakespearean psychodrama with his cursed, crustaceous father (Stellan Skarsgard ) is representative of the films mind-numbing, indulgent exposition. Of all movies, this is the last youd expect to talk and talk and talk and talk, but on it goes, everybody yapping about what they just did, what theyre about to do, what they should be doing, what it will mean if they do X instead of Y. Dude, just fucking do  it.
