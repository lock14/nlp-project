Christopher Guest and his comedy troupe put both joy and pathos into their heavily improvised comedies. On one magnificent occasion -- 2001's dog pageant, "Best in Show" -- they even sustained those two ingredients throughout an entire picture.
The gang's fourth jamboree, "For Your Consideration," which opens today, mocks Hollywood's Oscar mania, and the results are mostly funny but surprisingly sad, too. The movie makes explicit the lust for showbiz validation that has lurked in all of Guest's projects, from the community theater outfit in "Waiting for Guffman" to the middle-aged folkies in "A Mighty Wind."
It's not the dreamers that Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy send up, but the harshness of the dream itself. In "For Your Consideration," the dream is toxic and the factory that produces it is cruel.
Abandoning the faux documentary format of Guest's previous pictures, the film takes us to the period set of "Home for Purim," an inane slice of 1940s melodrama about a Jewish family reunited in time for the dying matriarch's favorite holiday.
We catch snippets of the dialogue ("It ain't a dang mitzvah!") and meet the unknown cast. Victor Allan Miller (Harry Shearer), the sunny, spineless star of a hot dog ad, plays the father; Brian Chubb (Christopher Moynihan) and Callie Webb (Parker Posey) play the adult children while having an on-set fling.
During the production a rumor hits the Internet, impossibly, that Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara) , an insecure passive-aggressive, is giving an Oscar-caliber performance as the high-strung mother ("I've gone meshugenah!").
Soon this tiny, irrelevant, unfinished, and -- let's be honest -- terrifically stupid independent film is beset by attention, expectations, and egos. In the film's best running gag, Fred Willard and a strapping Jane Lynch report the latest "Purim" developments on their cheesy entertainment show. (Lynch power-smiles into the teleprompter and Willard, in a bleached fauxhawk, blasts his putdowns.)
As amusing as it is, the comedy here consists mostly of predictable potshots. (Most hilarious is the farcical tune sung in "Home for Purim" during the breaking of bread. It's literal musical dinner theater.) Guest, who plays the humorless director of "Home for Purim," and Levy, who plays Miller's agent, indulge their usual disdain for the unhip, the clueless, and the philistine. Levy is a dimwit. "Purim" producer Jennifer Coolidge is a dingbat. The veteran publicist (John Michael Higgins) doesn't know what the Internet is. The indie-studio executives (Ricky Gervais and Larry Miller) want the already addled screenwriters (Bob Balaban and Michael McKean) to "tone down the Jewishness." And the actors are gradually exposed as narcissists.
Before he started with these ensemble projects, Guest directed and co-wrote 1989's "The Big Picture, " which was a lot more incisive about film industry craziness. Despite the dead fish floating in this latest barrel, the potshots in "For Your Consideration" do add up to a knowing jeremiad against the maddening phenomenon of awards-season hype. And the film shows with steadily gathering force how personally distorting the machine can be.
The Oscar talk reaches a fever pitch after "Purim" comes out and takes its most drastic toll on Hack, whose face surgically becomes a mask -- no, the mask -- of comedy and tragedy. In the film's superior last third, O'Hara's performance, at once touching and bravely unpleasant, transcends its satirical starting point and becomes vanity's awful downside: Norma Desmond in the funhouse mirror.
Like O'Hara, none of the players in "For Your Consideration" is a household name (no matter how much they should be), so the film's jokes on ignominy are sort of heartbreaking. These aren't megastars biting the hand that feeds them -- it's not Julia Roberts in "Full Frontal," "America's Sweethearts," or " The Player." They're the semi-, sub-, and non-famous satirizing and dramatizing the actor's struggle for attention, better work, and integrity. Lacking a hand to feed them, they bite themselves, instead.


         Fred Willard's faux-hawk is possibly the best thing about Christopher Guest's "For Your Consideration," a spoof of Oscar season hype co-written with Eugene Levy. It's funny in parts but not half as inspired as past efforts. Still, Willard is a genius at playing dumb, and he knows a kindred hairstyle when he sees one.
 
  Taking the world's most ludicrous coif to its loftiest and most poignant dimensions, he plays Chuck Porter, the moronic co-host of an "Entertainment Tonight"-style show he anchors with the only marginally less stupid Cindy Martin (Jane Lynch). Together they make up an important part of the official brainless echo chamber for the entertainment-industrial complex, repeating rumors until they start to become a little bit true.
 


         






    When a writer for a little-known website visits the set of the low-budget weepie called "Home for Purim" and remarks that the overripe performance of its lead, Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), is "Oscar-worthy," he unleashes a chain reaction of hysteria and hubris. Word gets back to Marilyn, whose career has seen better decades, and it isn't long before everybody has heard the news.
 
  One rumor leads to another, and soon Marilyn's movie husband, Victor Allan Miller (Harry Shearer), is mentioned as a possible nominee as well, followed by their movie daughter Callie Webb (Parker Posey). Before long, Marilyn and Victor are taping morning shows and basking in the glow of nomination speculation. Only Callie's real-life boyfriend and movie brother, Brian Chubb (Christopher Moynihan), is left out of the trophy lust-fueled conflagration that ensues.
 
  Guest, who co-wrote and starred in "This Is Spinal Tap" long before directing "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show" and "A Mighty Wind," gets the most out of seemingly throwaway details like hairstyles and names and Marilyn's petty cruelty to her friends — details he uses to express some combination of hope, despair and utter self-delusion in his characters. When not shielded from life by their insulating inanity, they tend to be has-beens and dreamers of middling to bag-of-rocks intelligence, wary optimists who get their hopes up gradually only to see them dashed suddenly.
 
  "For Your Consideration" is the first of Guest's films to be filmed as a narrative rather than a mock-documentary, but somehow it still feels a little played out and in need of a rest. "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" had a buoyancy and freshness that don't come through here. Maybe it's the Hollywood setting, which forms a thin crust of cynicism around the story, but there's something a little too bleak about the broken Hollywood dreams trope and with its stereotypes of stereotypes.
 
  Marilyn, the blowsy, would-be grande dame, is all sublimated bitterness and befuddlement. Victor, the consummate showman (best known as a hot dog pitchman), uses his laser-white teeth to deflect humiliation. Levy, John Michael Higgins and Jennifer Coolidge play Victor's fair-weather agent, the movie's clueless publicist and its rock-dumb heiress/producer. Ricky Gervais makes a brief appearance (flanked even more briefly by Sandra Oh) as the clueless studio suit who steps in at a critical moment to make the movie "appeal to a broader audience." Horrified, screenwriters Philip Koontz (Bob Balaban) and Lane Iverson (Michael McKean) take immediate action by grumbling, pouting and looking aggrieved.
 
  The movie does have its flashes of genius. "Home for Purim," the movie, is set in the Deep South, where Yiddish is spoken with a drawl. In the "Hollywood Now" intros, Cindy and Chuck compete to demonstrate just how ridiculous Hollywood fashion styling can be. And a spoof of movie review shows called "Love It or Hate It," in which one reviewer loves everything and the other hates it all, is hilarious in its reductive absurdity.
 
  As a bicultural person (Guest was born Haden-Guest to a British father and American mother), the director finds humor in the American cult of infinite possibility. But in this instance, Guest's satire starts to border on cruelty to minerals.

Dust off the mantel, book the Botoxologist, do whatever it is that needs to be done when buzz rises to a supersonic whine as the awards season looms: The astute, Oscar-loving/Oscar-tweaking showbiz satire For Your Consideration  is a shoo-in to sweep every trophy available in the competitive category of best coif in this crazy business we call show.
Truly, the level of tender, ruthless, inspired, lethally accurate study that has gone into the follicular expression of each and every character in Christopher Guest's latest hilarious cultural corrective is something inspiring to behold. Eugene Levy (who co-wrote with Guest) goes for a tragically thinning Caesar cut as schlock agent Morley Orfkin. As magnificently ignorant and self-involved Hollywood Now  TV cohost Chuck Porter, the incomparable Fred Willard sticks to a bleached and tufted faux-hawk.
Guest himself favors a cloud of frizz hoping to pass for Eraserhead  cool to play Jay Berman, shlubby director of an indie period-piece drama infelicitously titled Home for Purim . The movie within the movie gathers a Jewish family  including father, son, and lesbian daughter (Parker Posey)  for the favorite holiday of the dying matriarch, Esther Pischer. (In Yiddish, pisher means ''bed wetter''  and, more broadly, a nobody.) The production is barely on the radar of the studio honcho (Ricky Gervais, British guest of Guest). But then veteran actress Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), who plays Esther, is mentioned in some blip on some blog as being Oscar-worthy. And soon the whole dum-dum production is twisted by hurricanes of hype, gusts that blow into enterprises as blithery as the Ebert/Roeper-like TV show Love It/Hate It , and as blathery as a Charlie Rose-like chin tugger. Soon enough, the buzzed-about actors have been cosmetically restyled, and the Jewishness has been steamed out. (Seriously, laurels and swag ought to be handed over to O'Hara for her brilliant portrayal of aging-actresshood.)
For Your Consideration  doesn't have the universal appeal of Guest's Best in Show  or Waiting for Guffman ; the work is more inside baseball, more like A Mighty Wind , with its loving eye roll in the cultish direction of folksingers and their Birkenstocks. But something about that specialized self-mockery moves and tickles me even more, I think  the precision of the skewering, the scholarship in the details. By now the Guest rep company (also featuring Ed Begley Jr., Jennifer Coolidge, Michael McKean, and Larry Miller) runs with such economy of movement that a simple Mary Hart-felt squaring of the shoulders by Jane Lynch as Hollywood Now 's cohost reduces me to tears of joy  and this from a showbiz junkie at a magazine that has already run its first Oscar predictions before Thanksgiving. So if you like EW, you'll love For Your Consideration . And you can quote me.

 One of the most endearing qualities of Christopher Guest’s films is the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the members of his informal repertory company. Like kids playing dress-up in an attic on a rainy Saturday afternoon, they can barely contain their seizures of delight when inspiration strikes, and the mood is contagious.  In their newest film, “For Your Consideration,” written by Mr. Guest and Eugene Levy and performed in a broader than usual version of the company’s semi-improvisatory style, some of the most delirious mischief is concentrated in scenes from a ridiculous imaginary movie, “Home for Purim.”  Contrary to every law of nature, principle of arts criticism or movie-industry business model, this piece of celluloid schlock accumulates awards buzz after a visitor to the set posts a notice on the Internet citing the “Oscar-worthy” performance of one of its stars, Marilyn Hack (Catherine O’Hara). Faster than a mouse click, an epidemic of Oscar fever grips the set, and as the hype escalates, other cast members’ names come into play.  A creaky Southern melodrama with a Jewish twist, “Home for Purim” is performed in a florid, old-fashioned style with accents as thick as lumps of congealed molasses. The word “Mama” is shrieked in the caterwauling tones of “Mama’s Family,” that long-running, hilariously misanthropic spinoff from “The Carol Burnett Show.” In fact, the jolly ensemble style of Mr. Guest’s company owes a great deal to the skits cooked up in the 1970s by Ms. Burnett, Harvey Korman and the show’s writing team.  The Mama in this case is a dying matriarch who, in Ms. O’Hara’s inspired hands, emerges as a sly takeoff on Geraldine Page in her grandly aggrieved Southern mode. As the actor playing Mama’s husband  —  a performer best known for TV commercials in which he plays Irv the Foot-Long Weiner — Harry Shearer wears a Zachary Scott mustache and flashes buck teeth.  Domestic fireworks explode when the movie couple’s prodigal daughter Rachel takes home a lesbian lover for the Jewish holiday. Callie Webb (Parker Posey), the  actress who plays Rachel, is best-known for her one-woman performance piece, “No Penis Intended,” and late in the movie we see a smidgen of this Off Off Broadway atrocity.  “Home for Purim” suggests a hybrid of “The Little Foxes” and “The Children’s Hour,” mixed with a cheesy Tennessee Williams knockoff and garnished with “Fiddler on the Roof.” It’s Jewish Southern Gothic with a sour cream filling and a weepy, sugary topping of David O. Selznick.  Alas, only bits and pieces of “Home for Purim” are shown in  “For Your Consideration.” As the pre-Oscar hype snowballs into an avalanche, Martin Gibb (Ricky Gervais), who runs the distribution company Sunfish Classics, demands that  the film’s Jewishness be “toned down,” and its title is changed to “Home for Thanksgiving.” We see nothing of the final product.  “For Your Consideration” is by far the broadest comedy Mr. Guest and company have made. Despite its merriment, it is also the flimsiest. Unlike Mr. Guest’s earlier films, the movie has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor’s subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Ms. O’Hara’s Marilyn.  Her inspired comic creation belongs on the same shelf as the provincials in Mr. Guest’s “Waiting for Guffman,” who dream that their little amateur show might be Broadway bound, and the aging folk singers of “A Mighty Wind,” who still nurture a sanctimonious image of themselves as a cultural vanguard. Mr. Guest’s vision of naïve American dreamers acting out their fantasies found its deepest expression in the dog owners of “Best in Show,” whose primped-up pets on parade were manifestations of their vanity. Those dog owners also represented a wide cross-section of Americans, something that “For Your Consideration” doesn’t begin to evoke.  In “For Your Consideration,” satire only glancingly collides with reality. To begin with, a movie like “Home for Purim” would never be made, even in the outermost reaches of independent cinema. Nor  would a unit publicist be as clueless and buffoonish as the one played here by John Michael Higgins, who refers to “the World Wide Inter-Web” and delivers this zany analysis of the acting profession: “Inside every actor is a tiger, a pig, an ass and a nightingale, and you never know which will show up.”  Funny? Yes. Revealing? No. By and large, the movie is content to offer amusing caricatures and leave it at that.  And so we are left to enjoy clever spoofs of media types who are already self-parodies. Leading the list is an obsequious television couple, played by Fred Willard in a red Mohawk and a wonderfully deadpan Jane Lynch, who host an “Entertainment Tonight”/“Access Hollywood”-like program, and Don Lake and Michael Hitchcock as dueling movie critics many notches in insight below Ebert and Roeper.  This is the first Christopher Guest film in which too many characters are spread too thinly. The beleaguered screenwriters (Bob Balaban and Michael McKean), whose ideas go unheard, barely have time to register. Even the appearances of Mr. Guest (with frizzy mad scientist hair), as the autocratic director of “Home for Purim,” and Mr. Levy, as  a feckless agent, are too hasty.  That leaves us with Ms. O’Hara, whose Marilyn, a virtual unknown after nearly 30 years in show business, initially feigns nonchalance about the buzz. As she makes the rounds of talk shows, stroked and goaded by one talking head after another, you observe her seduction by the insatiable monster of television celebrity journalism. In her final act of obeisance to the system, she appears, drastically made over and destroyed, her lips plumped, her face stretched into an expressionless mask of desperate ambition.  “For Your Consideration” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language.

Ten years into a collaboration that has produced the mockumentaries "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show" and "A Mighty Wind," Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy shed the gimmick in the almost surreally fast-paced laffer "For Your Consideration." The story of a "prestige" film comically roiled by kudos buzz, "Consideration" is too heavy on ethnic humor and industry in-jokes to attract many in flyover territory. But it will garner critical huzzahs from those it lampoons, which will broaden the duo's fan base in theatrical and fiercely cultish ancillary. 
Warner Independent Pictures plans a Nov. 17 rollout in some 40 U.S. markets, expanding the run a week later, aiming to capitalize, no doubt, on holiday buzz for awards season.
Wisely abandoning the mockumentary approach they'd taken about as far as it could go, Guest and Levy have expanded their rep company of players and utilized an obviously larger budget to widen the net of their cultural satire in snugly cut narrative form. Crucially, they've preserved an anarchic, zinger-fueled wit that works chiefly because they continue to simultaneously embrace and condemn the cruel superficiality of their self-absorbed losers.
Though she's endured the business for more than three decades, actress Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara) still isn't recognized when she drives up to the front gates of the studio. She's there starring as a dying Southern matriarch in a low-budget drama called "Home for Purim" opposite Victor Allan Miller (Harry Shearer), who sees the role as a chance to escape his typecasting as Irv the Footlong Weiner in tube spots.
The crew of "Home for Purim" and the industry hangers-on are about par for the Tinseltown course: insecure, suspicious tonsorial train wrecks with laughably trendy wardrobes. There's the relentlessly cheery makeup guy (Ed Begley Jr.); Miller's distracted agent (Levy); a non-sequitur-spouting publicist (John Michael Higgins); the bland, middle-aged helmer (Guest); the EPK producer (Carrie Aizley); a breathtakingly dim producer (Jennifer Coolidge); and the mismatched screenwriting duo (Bob Balaban, Michael McKean).
One day on the set, Brit d.p. (Jim Piddock) lets slip to Marilyn that an Internet site has speculated her perf may be worthy of that little gold statue. She soon tells Miller, as well as co-stars (Parker Posey, Christopher Moynihan, Rachael Harris), the last a humorless Method type.
Soon the rumor has leaked to a series of contempo entertainment programs, caricatured with spot-on precision. Chief among them is "Entertainment Now," co-hosted by terminally perky and sharp-tongued duo (Jane Lynch and Fred Willard, here sporting a fluffy blond Mohawk).
The media buzz, in turn, attracts the attention of smarmy Sunfish Classics prez Martin Gibb (Ricky Gervais) and his jumpy assistant (Larry Miller), whose boutique distrib is interested in acquiring the film -- with maybe just a few script changes. Renamed "Home for Thanksgiving," pic gets raves from a pair of bickering tube crix (Don Lake, Michael Hitchcock). Can the coveted noms be far behind?
Of course, "Home for Purim" is terrible -- and nobody really seems to care, or even notice. As with the small-town theater company in "Guffman," even the hint of validation is enough to spur on these oddballs.
Entire company is in top form. Rep company newcomer Gervais has a priceless few moments discussing restaurants with Coolidge, while Shearer's character sums up the pic's main theme: "Oscar is the backbone of this industry, an industry not known for backbone."
Little-known thesps Deborah Theaker and Scott Williamson, who between them have been in almost all of Guest's directorial efforts, are given incrementally larger roles here as Marilyn's pal and a morning talkshow host, respectively.
If there's a whisper of disappointment, it's in the promise of O'Hara's touchingly conflicted Marilyn. The role feels underwritten -- particularly as O'Hara cedes face time to a huge supporting cast that includes various thesps doing one-off-cameos as themselves.
Tech package is marked by a TV-like glare, which also is spoofed by Guest: Asked for more light on the set, Piddock's lenser complains, "It's brighter than Stephen Hawking in here."

For Your Consideration pulls off the neat trick of skewering the movie industry while remaking it in its own image. The latest ensemble comedy by Christopher Guest  and company may take place in Los Angeles, but its imaginative provenance lies somewhere between the la-la lands of Entourage  and Mulholland Dr.  It's as weird and whimsical an invention as Guest's Waiting for Guffman , Best in Show , or A Mighty Wind .
The scenario is more or less anchored in reality, or at least what passes for it in Hollywood . Anxiety mounts for cast and crew on the indie production Home for Purim when a blogger forecasts Oscar consideration for leading lady Marilyn Hack  (Catherine O'Hara ). As the hype metastasizes to include her co-star, the famed hot-dog spokesman Victor Allen Miller (Harry Shearer ), as well as supporting beauty Callie Webb  (Parker Posey ), a story for the media, if not a star for the ages, is born.
All of which would be perfectly reasonable if Home for Purim  weren't utterly ridiculous. Directed by neophyte nebbish Jay Berman  (Christopher Guest), it revives some forgotten mode of hysterical melodrama without a trace of irony or competence. Home for the holidays, a preposterous clan of Georgian Jewswe're talking Dixieland here, not Eurasiarally around their dying matriarch. It's the sort of film where a lady about to swoon first puts a wrist to her forehead.
Elsewhere on the set, producer Whitney Taylor Brown  (Jennifer Coolidge ), heiress of the Brown diaper fortune, struggles with polysyllabic words; bumbling agent Morley Orfkin  (Eugene Levy ) gobbles down bagels; and unit publicist Corey Taft  (John Michael Higgins ) calls for the marketing campaign to be "timely, quantifiable, and orotund." Corey's ignorance of the "Interweb" is typical of the way the Hollywood of Consideration  often seems as outdated as the Georgia of Purim .
Guest's movies revel in marginal cultures and obsolete sensibilities, whether it's the podunk thespians of Waiting for Guffman  or the dog nerds of Best in Show . By infusing his antiquated sympathies into au courant Hollywood, he risks a disconnect in the material. But it's exactly that tension, a bristle of styles, that lends Consideration  a more memorable texture than Guest's prior foray into Hollywood satire, 1989's The Big Picture.
The movie doesn't lack for topical zingers. The Charlie Rose Show   receives its definitive mocking, and, as Chuck Porter , meathead co-host of TV tabloid Hollywood Now , Fred Willard  is done up with faux-hawk, diamond earring, hot-pink tie, and the pathetic exuberance of a professional ass kisser. Yet in an amusing send-up of an Ebert & Roeperstyle duo, the best bit isn't the squabbling personalities or blurb-whoring inanity, but a tossed-off quip, barely overheard as the scene fades out: "This film reminds me of your wife and her ceramic turtle collection."
Lines like that (the screenplay is by Guest and Levy) go to the heart of Consideration , a movie about insiders from an outsider perspective. Hoopla in Hollywood isn't the real subject here, merely the pretext for another oddball ode to lovable losers.
