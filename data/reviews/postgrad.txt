Bland to the point of pointlessness, Post Grad
 follows the inane romantic and career highs and lows of perky optimist Ryden Malby (Bledel) as she burrows, ferretlike, into and out of the job market while surrounded by the type of pseudo-kooky nuclear family usually relegated to Disney Channel movies or upbeat Lifetimers. Co-produced by Ivan Reitman, who should know better, and directed with an utter absence of style by Shrek
's Jenson, this is the very definition of cookie-cutter filmmaking, a strange hybrid of subgenres (post-teen comedy, oddball family outing) that brings to mind nothing so much as elements of The Devil Wears Prada
 and Little Miss Sunshine
 fused together and then stripped of anything that might make the final product even remotely unique, satisfying, or borderline interesting. It's milk-and-cookies all the way, as the eternally cheerful Ryden sees her post-collegiate dream job at a Los Angeles publishing house snatched away by her longtime nemesis (Reitman) and ends up working for Pop (Keaton) at his mall-based luggage outlet. Her love life fares little better. Although best-friend-without-benefits Adam (Gilford) � himself torn between becoming a singer-songwriter or a lawyer (!) � is clearly the way to go for a character as stultifyingly dull as Ryden, she manages a fling with the Brazilian hunk and infomercial director next door (Santoro) before realizing the error of her ways and heading in the direction of Mr. Right. No one in the cast, not even the great Carol Burnett, makes much of an impression in a film that virtually defines the word "unnecessary," but it does manage to pull double duty as one heck of a sleep aid.

In “Post Grad,’’ Ryden Malby has a plan: Graduate from college armed with a gilded resume, cruise into a top publishing firm, and snag an airy apartment overlooking downtown LA. Naturally, the floundering job market intervenes to torpedo her dreams. “The world is a screwy place,’’ Ryden’s father says. “It doesn’t play by the rules.’’ In the end, neither does “Post Grad,’’ a disjointed patchwork of zany character sketches lacking in coherence and credibility.
When plucky overachiever Ryden (Alexis Bledel) can’t find a job, she moves back into her suburban childhood home with her eccentric family. The Malby patriarch (Michael Keaton) has a penchant for madcap business ventures. Ryden’s mother (Jane Lynch) does damage control in her husband’s wake. Younger brother Hunter (Bobby Coleman) is a weird little imp who communicates via sock puppet. Carol Burnett, wry and dour-faced as ever, shines as the chain-smoking grandmother.
Before long, the plot spirals into mayhem. A swarthy Brazilian neighbor (Rodrigo Santoro) swoops in to seduce Ryden as platonic best friend Adam (Zach Gilford) languishes on the sidelines. There’s a funeral for a dead cat. Cut to an infomercial with a man dressed as an avocado. Then a derby race. The disorienting jumble of story lines begs the question: Isn’t this a movie about college grads? What happened to the opening shots of mortarboards perched atop earnest faces, the ruminations about uncertain futures?
The script finally lurches to a conclusion that is too starry-eyed to be credible or satisfying, particularly for a film pitched as a hard-nosed look at post-college life in an economic climate that provides no neat denouements or easy answers. True love dissolves Ryden’s career concerns. The movie resorts to clunky truisms  - “What you do with your life is really just one half of the equation; the other half is who you’re with when you’re doing it’’  - in order to yank the scattered plot toward its dubious resolution.
“Post Grad’’ is more portraiture than parable: a snapshot of a wacky family with little broader resonance. It’s often an entertaining snapshot, due to comic dynamos like Burnett, Keaton, and Lynch. But there is no bracing wisdom here for those newly sprung from the collegiate bubble and adrift in self-doubt. “Stay out of the workforce as long as possible,’’ a friend tells Ryden and Adam. That’s as much honest insight as we get.

In Post Grad , the Gilmore Girls  ' bright-eyed Alexis Bledel  plays a Ms. Sunshine who's fresh out of college and unable to find work (let alone her dream job in publishing), and thus  conveniently for the uninspired makers of this dismayingly conservative dramedy  she's temporarily bunking back home with her wacky-lite family. (Carol Burnett  fills the crackpot oldie role usually offered to Alan Arkin.) Friday Night Lights ' Zach Gilford  has the dull honor of playing a loving guy waiting to be loved back. More laziness: Life in the publishing biz is depicted, natch, as a soul suck.

 When someone as fetching as Alexis Bledel can’t get a job — or a decent movie role — then we are officially in the depths of economic recession. As Ryden Malby in “Post Grad,” Ms. Bledel works her “Gilmore Girls” charm to the hilt, but no amount of cerulean-eyed sparkle can transcend this level of thudding mediocrity.  A promisingly perky opening informs us that Ryden is an ambitious cookie with her future meticulously mapped. But when her dream job at a Los Angeles publishing company goes south, Ryden is forced to return home to her Comedy Writing 101 family: the D.I.Y.-nut dad (poor Michael Keaton), the long-suffering mom (a restrained Jane Lynch), the weird kid brother (Bobby Coleman) and the inappropriate oldster (a painfully frozen Carol Burnett). Rounding out the formula is the hometown boy with the fruitless, flaming torch (the wonderful Zach Gilford from “Friday Night Lights”). No wonder Ryden is drawn to the hot Brazilian neighbor with the slept-in stubble (Rodrigo Santoro): so are we.  A weightless dramedy directed (by Vicky Jenson) without a single imaginative shot or fresh idea, “Post Grad” groans with the familiar: the pop-propelled job-hunting montage, the fallback position with Dad (complete with humiliating uniform). More troubling is a play-safe message to young women that cautions security over risk, comfort over long-held dreams and the nice American boy over the dangerously sexy foreigner. Note to the writer Kelly Fremon: Is Ryden postgraduation or postmortem?  “Post Grad” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Squishy writing and a squished cat.

A documentary crew shadowing any randomly selected college graduate entering the workforce today would be hard-pressed to find a less compelling subject than Ryden Malby, the daydreamer Alexis Bledel plays in orphaned Fox Atomic comedy "Post Grad." As fiction characters go, Ryden seems as dull as they come, making it hard to muster much sympathy for her plight, which amounts to the standard soul-searching every young person faces when confronted with the realities of professional life (albeit with quirkier set dressing and supporting characters). Pic's prospects look worse than those of a liberal arts major in a recession.
Drawing heavily from the "Little Miss Sunshine" formula, minus the heart, screenwriter Kelly Fremon surrounds her heroine with family members defined by their most eccentric traits: There's Michael Keaton as the dad obsessed with get-rich-quick schemes, Jane Lynch playing Ryden's take-charge mom and Carol Burnett doing her part as the off-color grandparent with one foot in the grave. The Malby clan manages to upstage poor Ryden as early as the opening scene, setting the tone for the rest of the film as they burst in late on her college graduation, calling attention to themselves on her special day.
Ryden's the type who thinks she has everything figured out, setting her sights on a dream job with "the finest publishing house in all of L.A." So confident is she that everything will go her way that Ryden submits an application for a posh apartment, only to see her plans go pear-shaped on the day of the interview: An uninsured driver broadsides her car; Jessica Bard (Catherine Reitman), school valedictorian and Ryden's "own personal Darth Vader," swoops in to steal the job; and she must suffer the humiliation of moving back into her childhood home.
Ah, to be young and fear nothing worse than embarrassment, which appears to be the emotion "Post Grad" is most preoccupied with, making the film seem all the more petty given the real-world job crisis. Whether it's having the entire family barge in during a make-out session with the Brazilian hunk next door (Rodrigo Santoro) or being spotted by friends while wearing a bellhop uniform at a dead-end mall job, Ryden's constantly finding herself in uncomfortable situations.
Bledel ("Gilmore Girls") has just the face for it, too, with her big blue eyes and baby-doll features giving the character a pouty, brink-of-tears look throughout, but director Vicky Jenson (veteran of such animated pics as "Shrek" and "Shark Tale") seems behind the curve of live-action comedy. While properties like "The Office" and "I Love You, Man" have elevated wince-inducing schadenfreude
 to a veritable art form in recent years, Jenson's still trying to milk laughs from gags involving cat poop and garden gnomes.
Sitting on the sidelines of Ryden's coming-of-age adventure is best friend Adam ("Friday Night Lights" star Zach Gilford, emphasizing his emo side), who patiently waits for her to come around and think of him in romantic terms. The subplot plays out like so many of the film's jokes, tipping its hand to the outcome while the setup is still unfolding, thereby robbing the movie of any suspense that would normally accompany the missteps in their relationship.
Auds should be rooting for the couple to get together, but instead, Ryden's woe-is-me attitude underscores the question why, of the 1.5 million or so college students who graduate each year, she's so deserving of the perfect job and hopelessly devoted man, much less her own movie. It's telling that "Post Grad's" emotional climax shifts its attention away from Ryden to her younger brother, Hunter (Bobby Coleman), in a scene that evokes "Little Miss Sunshine's" striptease dance finale.
A generous budget gives "Post Grad" a polished if rather uninspired look -- certainly less distinctive than the hipster pics generated across the lot at Fox Searchlight.

Post Grad  tries to do three things at once—and half-hits the mark on only one. Part of it is wacky Little Miss Sunshine  family time, with Carol Burnett  in the Alan Arkin  part and Michael Keaton  as the clueless paterfamilias. Part is sketch comedy, which—given Keaton's frequently under-used talents, plus Jane Lynch  as his wife and a supporting cast stacked so deep that J.K. Simmons  can be thrown away on two scenes—is not half-bad. But most of Post Grad  is a soggy, Devil Wears Prada –aspiring romance, with Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel ) as a just-graduated girl whose deep lust for literature (she has read Catcher in the Rye !) is exceeded only by her flawless navigation in heels. When a job in publishing isn't forthcoming until the second act, Ryden leaves the big city and heads back to the homestead to choose between the older Brazilian hottie next-door (Rodrigo Santoro ) and her devoted, absolutely spineless BFF, Adam (Zach Gilford ). Then comes that second act, which features Ryden actually getting a magazine job in this economic climate, only to quit it for true love. Yes, she quit a publishing job. In 2009. Vicky Jenson 's live-action debut is as cartoonish as her work on Shrek  , and that's OK for the comic bits. The rest seems like a remarkably cynical cross-breed—for all demographics, but, ultimately, for none.
