In the low-impact widowed-daddy drama The Boys Are Back , Clive Owen plays Joe, a British sportswriter based in Australia whose chosen style of child rearing, following the death of his wife from cancer, is distracted permissiveness. Bedtimes are indistinguishable from playtimes, meals are indistinguishable from delivery pizza, and if his younger son (Nicholas McAnulty) wants a joyride on the hood of a car, Dad is happy to get behind the wheel. (George MacKay plays Joe's more conventionally raised son from his first marriage, visiting from England.)
If Joe's free-range approach to parenting is controversial  he takes pride in ruffling the nerves of nearby mothers with his WTF attitude  it's also faithful to the examples supplied by real-life widowed British journalist Simon Carr, on whose well-received 2001 memoir The Boys Are Back in Town  this sweetened adaptation is based. But where Carr writes with a straightforward energy, director Scott Hicks (Shine , No Reservations ) shellacs the proceedings with a gloss of sunshiny affirmation, a Hicks specialty/weakness that dulls whatever edge the story has in conveying the bewilderment of an overwhelmed single father. With those piercing eyes, Owen makes a lovely, soulful Joe, of course. But it's not the nice papa we want to understand here, it's the unapologetically naughty one.


 The wanton slaughter of mothers, a fixture of Hollywood drama for some time now, is given an international spin in “The Boys Are Back,” which takes place in an Australia of golden meadows and endless beaches. The star is Clive Owen, raffish and charming as ever but with his sex-symbol magnetism toned down in keeping with the melancholy subject. The film, directed by Scott Hicks (“Shine”) from a script by the television writer Allan Cubitt, has a burnished, high-quality look and a heart swollen with maudlin self-regard.  Mr. Owen plays Joe Warr, a British transplant who has become one of the top sportswriters in his adopted homeland. Joe moved to Australia, we discover in due course, to be with his second wife, Katy (Laura Fraser), an equestrienne he impregnated while she was at a match in England and he was married to someone else. Each union produced a son, and when Katy dies of cancer both boys — cute little Artie (Nicholas McAnulty) and anxious teenage Harry (George MacKay) — end up living with Joe in his rambling house in the countryside.  “The Boys Are Back” was adapted from a memoir of the same name by Simon Carr, a funny and affecting book that the filmmakers have somehow contrived to turn into a dreary and unconvincing dead-mama melodrama. Katy, glimpsed alive in a few early scenes that establish the mutual adoration between her and Joe, returns in apparitional form later to give her husband encouragement and advice.  Nobody else — certainly no other woman — is qualified to do so. As Artie and Harry settle in with Joe, whose child-rearing style is permissive to the point of anarchy, a curious mood of juvenile, treehouse misogyny settles over the film. Joe is happy to do things like speed across the sand behind the wheel of his Land Rover with Artie perched on the hood or let the boy cannonball into a shallow hotel bathtub,  and anyone who raises an eyebrow is marked as a controlling, compulsive stick-in-the-mud.  This includes, from the start, Katy’s mother, Barbara (Julia Blake), whose disapproval of Joe is as emphatic as the grim lines around her mouth. Laura (Emma Booth), the mother of a schoolmate of Artie’s, at first seems more sympathetic to this handsome, sad dad, and maybe even willing to sleep with him. But Laura too proves wanting when she fails to embrace Joe’s “just say yes” parental philosophy and also to meet his every household and child-care need. As for the first wife back in England (Natasha Little), her coldness is shown to be far worse for Harry than her ex-husband’s wanton irresponsibility is.  Not that I want to be hard on the guy. The problem is that the movie always takes the easy way, scattering a few heavy, confrontational scenes among acres of picturesque montages. The central dramatic crisis, which involves Joe’s leaving the boys alone in the house, with predictably disastrous results, is painfully unconvincing. The repercussions and resolutions that follow are laughably unconvincing.  And “The Boys Are Back,” which seems at times to want to acknowledge the challenges of raising children, shrinks away from anything too wrenching or difficult. Joe’s house — he and the boys call it “hog heaven” — may be a mess, but the movie is as tidy as can be, with not an unwashed, unkempt hair out of place.  “The Boys Are Back” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some rough language and intense moments.

The pain of divorce and the tragedy of a parent's death supply the raw emotional materials of "The Boys Are Back," making it all the more impressive that director Scott Hicks steers clear of the maudlin and the manipulative in his sensitively wrought adaptation of Simon Carr's 2001 memoir. The story of a man suddenly forced to be a better dad after his wife's untimely death, this is polished yet authentically moving, widely accessible arthouse fare whose marketers would do well to target family audiences along with the usual prestige-picture crowd. Miramax release opens Stateside Sept. 25.
Carr's onscreen alter ego is British expat Joe Warr (Clive Owen), now working as a sports journalist in Australia. A lovely opening sequence -- in which Joe drives along the beach with his 6-year-old son, Artie (Nicholas McAnulty), perched dangerously on the car's hood -- reps just one example of Joe's more permissive parenting policy ever since his wife's passing.
What follows is a lengthy flashback that fills in the details of Joe's marriage to beloved second wife Katy (Laura Fraser), cut sadly short when she succumbs to cancer. But the mourning period is all too brief, as Joe quickly learns that the business of life -- work, groceries, dishes, laundry and other mundane obligations -- tends to chug on even when time seems to have stopped.
Overly familiar narrative devices -- including Joe's voiceover and visions of Katy hovering over his shoulder, offering maternal advice from the beyond -- prove initially worrisome. But Hicks and scribe Allan Cubitt wisely keep these devices to a minimum and focus instead on the central relationship, which is complicated by workaholic Joe's uneasiness with full-time fatherhood, plus the fact that Artie is too young to grasp the full import of his mother's death and often acts out as a result.
Joe's solution is to instate what Carr's memoir describes as "free-range" parenting -- a radical rethink of conventional child-rearing methods that enforces as few rules as possible, instead stressing the father's role as an encourager of risk. The stakes increase, as does Joe's failure rate, when Harry (George MacKay, "Defiance"), his teenage son from his first marriage, comes to Australia for an extended visit. Joe views this with some apprehension at first, and indeed, Harry's arrival brings an entirely different set of father-son issues to the surface.
Having recently helmed tony literary adaptations ("Hearts in Atlantis," "Snow Falling on Cedars") and a foodie romance ("No Reservations"), Hicks here delivers an intimately scaled character piece that many will consider his finest work since 1996's "Shine." Besides an intuitive feel for contempo parent-child dynamics, embracing the sweet, still moments as well as the raucous ones, the filmmaker evinces an adroit sense of dramatic balance, generously coaxing emotion from the material without pushing too hard.
Avoiding histrionics yet revealing the full measure of Joe's grief at quiet, wrenching intervals, Owen brings his leading-man charisma to bear on a warmer role than he usually takes on. His rapport with McAnulty is well played and observed, while MacKay makes Harry a vital addition to both the family and the film itself, especially in the deeply consoling final passages.
The distaff side of the equation is well handled by Fraser; Julia Blake as Katy's mother, whose relationship with her son-in-law is both supportive and contentious; and Emma Booth as the requisite attractive single mom who catches Joe's eye.
The Warrs' cluttered abode reps a distinctively homey piece of production design, set against a sprawling Outback landscape (the pic was primarily lensed on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula), bathed in warm, summery light and granted a stunning widescreen showcase by d.p. Greig Fraser. An interlude set and shot in Blighty gets cooler, grayer treatment.
A selection of tracks by popular Icelandic band Sigur Ros adds emotional ballast and nicely complements Hal Lindes' score.

In the Oscar derby for Best Actor, is it better to die or to grieve? Clive Owen  opts for the latter route in this strained, sentimental adaptation of a memoir by widowed English journalist Simon Carr . His 2001 book—boozy, breezy, and thoroughly unsystematic—was a precursor to the new laissez-faire parenting movement, which Owen's sportswriter character describes for his two sons (teen and pre-teen) as "just say yes." The approach is, let them play with sharp sticks, let them make a mess, let them stay up late, etc. In the gorgeous coastal province of South Australia , the results are like Lord of the Flies  meets a J. Crew  catalog spread. Both star and producer (and a father off-screen), Owen is determined to present his gentler, domestic side here: He cries and grieves and learns to juggle career and home life—all without the benefit of estrogen! (Mothers will roll their eyes at the spectacle of Owen fumbling with toast and laundry.) But this father and his film—directed by Shine 's Scott Hicks —are only fun to watch while the mischief outweighs the mending. Inevitably, this all-male household must come to terms with, ahem, feelings , which kills the testosterone buzz. Carr's original anecdotes don't supply much storyline, so Hicks spans the gaps with golden-lit montages set to Sigur Rós . They're a great advertisement for Australian vacations. And vasectomies.
