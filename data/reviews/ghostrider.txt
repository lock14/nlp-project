Hark! What's that agonized shrieking rending the air? Is it the screams of the undead as their souls are consumed by the flames of the pit?
Close enough. It's the talented cast of "Ghost Rider" trying to act their way out of the movie.
Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, "American Beauty" discovery Wes Bentley, indie slacker Donal Logue -- oh, the carnage. How they all ended up in this goofy piece of Marvel Comics piffle about a flame-headed, cycle-ridin' emissary of Satan is a mystery best left to their agents.
"Ghost Rider" is the kind of movie that's great stupid fun as long as someone else is buying the tickets. The genre might be summed up as Redneck Horror Faust, or maybe Nascar Goth. Johnny Blaze is a stunt cyclist who in his youth (when he's played by non-Cage-lookalike Matt Long) makes a deal with Mephistopheles himself to save his cancer-afflicted dad (Brett Cullen).
The devil comes in the guise of Fonda, here for his "Easy Rider" highway cred but not allowed to get on a bike, unfortunately. It's quite eerie: Fonda makes it through the entire movie without moving a single facial muscle. In the grand tradition, Scratch doesn't play fair, and we cut several years ahead to find Johnny played by Cage with crazy eyes, a late-Elvis voice, and a hairpiece the size of a small marsupial.
Johnny's a famous Evel Knievel-style daredevil who, thanks to the fine print on the contract, cheats death on a daily basis. The devil's evil son, Blackheart, wants to take control of the world and -- wait, why am I even bothering? All you need to know is that every night Johnny goes flame-on and morphs into a leather-clad, chain-wielding avenger with a Sterno skull and a hunka hunka burnin' hog.
Thankfully, "Ghost Rider" plays a lot of this for comedy -- at least until the special effects budget kicks in -- and Cage lets himself go loosey-goosey in a way he hasn't since, oh, "Vampire's Kiss" way back in 1989. Johnny likes to listen to Carpenters songs and eat jellybeans out of martini glasses, neither of which I bet were in the script by writer-director Mark Steven Johnson. Johnson was responsible for "Daredevil" and the script for "Electra." This time he seems to be in on the joke.
Eva Mendes is scrumptious as Johnny's clap-on/clap-off love interest, and Sam Elliott collects a nice paycheck as a Ghost Rider of an earlier generation. The elemental Nephilim, demons who hang out with Blackheart because he's the baddest kid in school, are cool to look at but put up surprisingly little fight. The star doesn't make the same mistake. Asks Cage's Johnny, "If somebody makes a mistake -- a big mistake -- do you think they should pay for it every day for the rest of their lives?" The correct answer is: Only until their next movie.



Placed alongside such primetime Sony/Marvel Comics movies as the "Spider-Man" franchise, "Ghost Rider" is strictly matinee material. Though the superhero's fans have long awaited his close-up, the Devil's bounty hunter -- complete with a burning skull for a head and a killer motorcycle in flames --materializes in a movie that never measures up to his infernal potential. Yet another lucrative day-in-the-park job for Nicolas Cage typifies pic's constant feeling of routine, while Sony's day-and-date release in several international markets is a savvy way to collect as much coin as soon as possible before the fires go out.
"Ghost Rider" would have been most fun had it been made for a dime by a Roger Corman-type outfit as a quickie Gothic adventure spinning Zane Grey, "Faust" and Evel Knievel. In other words, precisely the kind of project studios simply can't make anymore.
Pic also would have been more enjoyable had Mark Steven Johnson not been tempted to both write and direct. 
Young motorcycle stunt driver Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) is following in the tiremarks of his dad Barton (Brett Cullen), but when he learns that dad is dying of cancer, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) comes calling. His Faustian bargain: Johnny's soul for Barton's full recovery.
Barton's ensuing fatal accident wasn't part of the deal, and even a budding romance with Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) doesn't stop the broken-hearted Johnny from hitting the road.
Dissolve to Johnny as a grown-up Nicolas Cage, having far out-paced Barton's modest carnival act with a huge arena show in which he jumps dozens of trucks, and even a football field full of Black Hawk helicopters. (Those tempted to compare the movie's own beefed-up self to its true pulp origins can insert thoughts here.) What astounds Team Blaze, led by Mack (Donal Logue), is how Johnny pushes so far beyond the envelope in stunt after stunt, while remaining unscathed.
Prelude (narrated by the great sandy voice of Sam Elliott) about a ghost rider out of the Old West comes full circle with the arrival of Blackheart (Wes Bentley), Mephistopheles' ungrateful and soulless son, aiming to get the devil's contract that the old ghost rider took for his own and buried somewhere. With said contract, Blackheart can supposedly suck up evil souls to dominate the planet.
Looking like a grown version of Butch Patrick Billy Mummy in �The Munsters,� saddled with many of pic�s uproariously lousy lines and urged to overplay every moment, Bentley has too many deficits going in to be a genuine threat to Cage's Johnny, once Mephistopheles recruits his bounty-hunting services. This, of course, complicates Johnny's stabs at renewing the love thing with Roxanne, who reappears in the form of Eva Mendes as an "Eyewitness News"-style Lois Lane covering local stories.
After a protracted 40 minutes, final hour at least gets down to the main event, pitting Ghost Rider vs. Blackheart and his easily dispatched gang of angel rejects in a series of nighttime bouts (our hero, vampire-like, spouts a skull and flames only after sunset), some of them in the middle of the unnamed city, finishing with an effects-heavy battle in a Mexican ghost town. Crucial to Ghost Rider's powers -- and his victory over Blackheart -- is his ability to grab a bad guy and force him to feel the pain of the souls he's harmed.
A wittier writer could have mined much amusement between Johnny and Roxanne, and a keen-eyed director could have turned pic's contests and exchanges into dazzling bouts of evil vs. highly compromised good. But on both fronts, Johnson's work smacks of pure recycling from other, better superhero adventures. Even the promise of new effects feels tired here, with nothing that hasn't been seen before (such as several repeated effects involving sand, dirt and decay) in, for example, "The Mummy" movies.
Lacking any pleasurable chemistry with the miscast Mendes, who looks mostly nonplussed by all the Mephistophelean goings-on, Cage is allowed to have a few moments of subversive comedy in an otherwise stunningly bland role. Image of Ghost Rider's fiery hog may have inspired the hiring of Easy Rider Fonda, who keeps his scenes crisp and mean. Elliott, providing the load of pic's expository background, is the acting equivalent of a nice swig of whiskey.
Oz production locales are never betrayed in a story set in Texas, and production designer Kirk M. Petrucelli and lenser Russell Boyd capture pic's contrasting big-city environs and Western exteriors.

When studios elect not to screen a movie for critics, it usually says something about the movie. In the case of Ghost Rider , it's kind of a moot point. Dude, they actually let the guy who made Daredevil direct another picture? Starring Nicolas Cage  as a demonic, hog-humping leather daddy on fire? Oh yes they did, and it doesn't seem entirely coincidental that the plot involves selling your soul to the devil.
Improbably enough, Daredevil has earned something of a minor cult status, and not just with fanboys. Or rather, it has cultivated the affections of some particularly discriminating fanboys: Arnaud Desplechin  and more than one editor of Film Comment  magazine have professed their admiration in terms having nothing to do with snarky contrarianism. It should be noted that their esteem is for the "daring new version" released on DVD, which for all its potential improvementsI haven't seen it, there being only so many hours allotted to my existence on earthwas presumably not so daring as to replace Ben Affleck  with another actor.
Should writer-director Mark Steven Johnson  ever deliver a daring new version of Ghost Rider , here's hoping he puts the "cut" in "director's cut." Until it devolves into exactly the sort of lifeless CGI spaz attack you'd expect, there's some legitimate pop pleasure to be had from the year's first jumbo-sized popcorn flick.
In the title role, Nicolas Cage proves there's nothing, nothing  he won't lend his name to, but also his knack for winning self-deprecation. Actors have collected paychecks with far more disdain than he brings to Johnny Blaze , a melancholy motorcycle stuntman who once sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda ) in return for his ailing father's life. Unbeknownst to JB, the devil's about to come calling, as is the diabolically bodacious Roxanne (Eva Mendes ), the inevitable girl reporter/love interest/Botox  babe. Sam Elliott  co-stars as the crusty old Caretaker, a mysterious grave keeper whooh, never mind: It's way too silly to get into.
Enter Blackheart, a/k/a Satan Jr. (Wes Bentley ), a peevish little snot who arrives on the scene with a clutch of minions possessed of elemental superpowers and shitty outfits. Blackheart's all worked up over some ancient soul scroll he's got to wrest away from Daddy so he can supersize his evil or whatever. Point is, Mephistopheles commands Ghost Rider to go kick their asses. He does this by reflecting pain and suffering back on them via an unholy form of eye contact called "The Penance Stare" and, when that doesn't work, by yelling really loud and throwing clumps of dirt.
Up till now, I thought "Johnny Blaze" was just something Method Man  liked calling himself. Ignorant as I am of the Marvel comic book source material, I can only suppose that the print version of the hero is a tad more rad than his on-screen iteration. A nine-year-old could think up hotter tricks for a demonic biker bound only by the laws of CGI, and yet what pleasure is to be had here comes from precisely its pre-adolescent simplicity and enthusiasmthe feeling that it has, in fact, been made by a nine-year-old. You can feel it in the immensely corny, hilariously unembarrassed overture that establishes the Ghost Rider mythology; in the avid, oblivious embrace of cliché; in the half-baked yet totally sincere ethics lesson about accepting responsibility for your choices, and in the pre-pubescent attitudes toward romance and sex. Johnson's a hardcore, dime-store fanboy, not a revisionist-minded fauxteur like Christopher Nolan  or Bryan Singer , and his giddy, goofball affection for the material sustained my goodwill until his underdeveloped grasp of form and rhythm let it slip away. The blank, frenetic exhaustion of the final reel acts like a kid who tries to snap out of a candy-binge coma by snorting lines of Pixy Stix .
Ghost Rider may lack both tongue and cheek, but Cage shoulders his flaming skull lightly. He honorably proceeds with a straight face until his face, supplanted by pixels, doesn't matter anymore. "He may have my soul, but he doesn't have my spirit," proclaims the Rider, having thwarted Mephistopheles by choosing to stay damned, damned to ride, onward, soulless to Ghost Rider 2 .
