Some fans of Eric Orner's comic strip, ``The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green," will be pleased to know that the characters have made it to the movies with their one dimension firmly intact. The strip is now a cartoonish sitcom pretending to be a romantic comedy about a drama queen and his adventures in lust. The movie might have gotten away with it, were it interested in romance or comedy. But the filmmakers don't appear to have any interests aside from celebrating the shallow sexual whims of the titular Ethan Green.
Ethan (Daniel Letterle) is involved in what is best described as a love rhombus -- four sides, not all of them equally appealing. The trystees include his current, an ex-baseball-player soon to be his ex-boyfriend (Diego Serrano ); his level-headed ex-ex (David Monahan) , who's selling the house Ethan and his roommate (Shanola Hampton ) are living in; and the prissy young real estate agent (Dean Shelton ) who's helping get the house sold as slowly as possible.
Amid the fresh faces, the sight of more seasoned ones, like Meredith Baxter as Ethan's with-it mom, is a kind of relief, though having a TV vet like Joel Brooks show up in muumuus and tacky hats feels like a cruel comment on gay middle age. But Brooks, who is teamed with Richard Riehle , another screen veteran, is a professional. Otherwise, you could trip on the amateurism. Lord knows the other actors do. This feels like a school play that someone has dragged to film school and turned into a final project.
That gay do-it-yourself-and-do-it-badly sensibility has produced genius (John Waters) and some recent minor camp pleasures, among them Charles Busch's ``Die, Mommie, Die!" and Richard Day's brazen ``Girls Will Be Girls." The cockeyed director Q. Allan Brocka (``Eating Out" and the upcoming ``Boy Culture") seems determined to make a decent career with that approach. ``Ethan Green" is sane and comparatively innocent, which, ultimately, is too bad since the banal material is screaming for salacious insight.
The movie's writer, David Vernon, and its director, George Bamber, do manage to wrangle most of the cast into the house for the finale. But that turns into a non-event, too. An episode of ``Golden Girls" is naughtier, funnier, and better made.


         Based on the popular syndicated comic strip by Eric Orner, "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green" is a fairly straightforward romantic comedy that just happens to take the gay social scene as its setting. Ethan (Daniel Letterle) is a nice regular guy, predictably unlucky in love, who is torn between his old boyfriend, his more recent boyfriend and a raucous fling.
 
 As directed by George Bamber from a script by David Vernon, no one involved seems to be under the impression they're doing anything more than having a little fun, and the performances have a spirited playfulness that gives the film a surprisingly bouncy personality.
 


         






   At times the eager-to-please attitude does push too far toward cartoon slapstick, mostly in the inordinate amount of screen time given the flamboyantly cross-dressing "Hat Sisters," played by veteran character actors Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle.
 
 Inoffensive even as it makes some fairly explicit sex jokes, "Ethan Green" may not exactly be fabulous, but it is pleasantly diverting.

A discordant 'Dog Lover's'

 
 The ins and outs of Southern California dog culture have tantalized filmmakers before, as potential lovers can meet in the park, take meaningful walks and, of course, play with their puppies.
 
 "Dog Lover's Symphony" further exploits the conceit by having the story narrated by the dog that brings the lucky couple together, as a young man on parole (Jesse Berns) is taken in by a lawyer (Maxwell Caulfield) and his daughter (Alaina Kalanj), who both encourage him to become a dog trainer.
 
 Written and directed by Ted Fukuda, the film is so off on all fronts it becomes a chicken-egg conundrum trying to pinpoint specific problems — as the stiff acting isn't aided by the overly expository dialogue, which in turn is driven by the functional plotting. It's sort of as if the component ideas for a movie were put into a computer and this is what came out.
 
 By the time the film's left-field conclusion drops, involving temporary resurrection and a check for $10 million, the only suitable ending for such a stinker involves a twist-tie and a baggie.

 In George Bamber's frothy directorial debut, "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green," it's not the title character's social life that lacks spark, it's Ethan Green (Daniel Letterle) himself. He may get by as the hero of Eric Orner's popular gay-theme comic strip on which the film is based, but here he comes off as whiney, immature and, frankly, quite dull. But livelier supporting characters, notably his peppy mother, Harper (Meredith Baxter, best known for playing a favorite 80's TV moms in "Family Ties"), who works as a gay-and-lesbian wedding planner, and Sunny, a basket case of a real estate agent, make up for some of his shortcomings.  At 26, Ethan Green has no trouble finding a hot guy to date or engage in casual sex with, but he is becoming increasingly tired of cruising the fast lane and leans toward settling down. It will be of very little consequence to audiences whether he ends up with the hunky yet intellectually challenged ex-baseball player, the flirty 19-year-old or the mature ex-boyfriend about to wed an obnoxious Republican. The film seems to know it, thankfully, and flaunts its frivolity aggressively with camp and lewd humor. Yet more often than not, these tactics fall flat, and the mostly unfunny — and unfabulous — trifle never rises above sitcom level. Where's the laugh track when it's needed most?  "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian)for strong language, sexual content and crude humor.

"The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green" is a frothy lark with a decided sense of the outrageous, sincere affection for its characters and their romantic plights. Based on the comicstrip by Eric Orner, pic may be so aggressively gay as to limit its appeal even among intended auds. Distribs' interest will depend on open-mindedness all around. 
"Ethan" finds its title character in love again, this time with Kyle, a former big-league ballplayer who's come out of the closet in a book and has pretty much swept Ethan off his feet. Meanwhile, his ex-boyfriend, Leo, is trying to sell the house Ethan lives in, so in an effort not to become homeless, Ethan enlists the help of Punch (Dean Shelton), an impish 19-year-old sex machine, and pile of human wreckage Sunny Deal (Rebecca Lowman), a real estate agent, to nix the house sale. 
It's a crackpot of a soap opera, ornamented by a great deal of sexual humor, sexual innuendo and sex. Lead Daniel Letterle (of "Camp") is a charmingly boyish actor, and the other featured players -- particularly veteran actress Meredith Baxter as Ethan's gay-wedding-planner mother -- are excellent.
"Ethan Green" has a bright, cheerful palette and a cast that's just about as colorful. It also has a very traditionalist sort of denouement, which may seem incongruous for such an out-there, comedy -- but is pretty predictable when the subject is romance.

If you're looking for the perfect date movie to celebrate Gay Pride, do yourself a favor: Rent some good porn and stay the hell away from Ethan Green  . Flat characters and speech-bubble dialogue are to be expected when they're based on a comic stripin this case, Eric Orner 's long-running alt-weekly staple but trust me, you'd be better off with Family Circus. A needy, serial-dating schlemiel, Ethan sometimes exudes a certain spineless charm on the page. Here, he's a shallow, self-sabotaging messand so's the movie, which unspools as a blur of vapid exes, seamy fuck buddies, and Mom (Meredith Baxter , looking very uncomfortable). Daniel Letterle 's Ethan is much too cute to pass as an unlovable loser, but Richard Riehle  and Joel Brooks  are perfectly cast as his "aunties," the Hat Sisters. Unfortunately, they're not enough to save this most unfabulous, unfunny, and unwatchable embarrassment.
