         "The Last King of Scotland" is not based on a true story. It was inspired by "true" events, which leaves more room for invention. Based on the 1998 novel by Giles Foden, it's the story of a young Scottish doctor who in 1971 signs up with the British Ministry of Health to work in a remote Ugandan village and winds up living the high life in Kampala, clutched to the turbulent bosom of Gen. Idi Amin.
 
  The story is as strange and gripping as it sounds, and the suggestion that the doctor might be real adds a not inconsiderable holy-Moses factor. It's a bit of a letdown to discover the events depicted are only partially factual. Amin, of course, was real, as was his jokey, buffoonish charm, his brutal slaying of nearly 300,000 people and his kitschy love of all things Scottish. (Throwing fear of ridicule to the wind, he saddled four of his sons with the names McKenzie, Campbell, McLaren and Mackintosh and once declared himself the last king of Scotland.)
 


         






    The general is played by Forest Whitaker, an actor whose sweet and jovial features counteract his imposing physique and vice versa, creating a curious tension that he fully exploits here. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), however, is fictional — though he did have a kind of real-life counterpart in a former British soldier named Bob Astles, who became one of Amin's closest advisors and was known in the British press as "Amin's white rat." Nicholas — who is young, reckless and very handsome — is more aptly referred to as "Amin's white monkey," though he doesn't find this out until much later, after insult has positively paled next to injury. Still, it hurts. Fresh out of medical school and reluctant to settle down to a life of stew, sherry and Presbyterianism, he has fled Scotland in search of adventure in Africa, and it takes only a passing familiarity with the literature of post-colonialism to guess what he's in for.
 
  Nicholas' groovy bop into the heart of darkness happens by accident. Arriving in Uganda on the very day of Amin's coup, he is met by Sarah (Gillian Anderson), the lonely, tousled wife of the only other doctor in town. Sarah represents just the sort of trouble Nicholas is drawn to — mysterious, complex and none of his business, and his attraction foreshadows a yet more reckless dalliance. When Amin comes to the village to give a speech, Nicholas persuades the reluctant Sarah to come with him. Things take an unexpected turn when soon after the rally Nicholas and Sarah are pulled over on the road by a soldier. Amin has been in a car accident. When Nicholas and Sarah arrive at the scene, they find a wrecked Maserati, a dying cow and a newly installed despot with a sprained hand. Nicholas takes command of the situation, and a few days later he is summoned and offered the job of being Amin's personal physician. Soon he's installed in a swanky apartment, hanging out in nightclubs and speeding around in a Mercedes convertible. Shot on location in Scotland and Uganda, the film shows a side of Africa rarely depicted in the movies. Kampala's bustling energy and striking midcentury architecture reflect Nicholas' youthful optimism. But as the movie progresses, the streets become cast in an oppressive hush, and the beautiful, futuristic buildings start to look like symbols of the dangers of scorched-earth reinvention.
 
  Nicholas breezily rejects the dull security of home and smugly dismisses Stone (Simon McBurney), one of the shadowy British spooks responsible for installing Amin in power and now lurking around Kampala warily trying to take their puppet's temperature with Nicholas as their personal thermometer. But none of this masks the fact that for all his puppyish charisma, Nicholas is just another white man on the make in Africa, fooling no one but himself. His vanity, idealism and lust for adventure make him especially vulnerable to Amin's insidious charm. And Nicholas willfully ignores early signs of trouble, the better to bask in his new role as the dictator's best friend and confidant, choosing to believe he is helping usher Uganda into its new iteration as a free black African nation.
 
  Working from a script by Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock, director Kevin Macdonald, whose previous films "One Day in September" and "Touching the Void" touch on similar themes, captures the energy and exuberance of a young nation in the throes of optimism and works it into a foreboding frenzy. Where there is traditional music and dancing on-screen, there's also a feverish sense of dread that mounts until you start wondering whose eye-view, exactly, you're meant to be peering through. Mostly it's Nicholas', though you get the feeling that Stone and his friends are taking in pretty much the same view.
 
  Whitaker plunges deep into the psychology of the role, portraying Amin as an erratic personality whose charisma and sociability — first-rate survival mechanisms — mask a deep-seated insecurity, searing resentment of foreigners and a galloping paranoia. Amin's bizarre personality was in many ways the product of an impoverished childhood in an occupied nation. Abandoned by his father, he eventually went to work for the British army, where he cleaned, cooked and joined the rugby team. It was there his fondness for Scotland bloomed, though the Scots he so admired allegedly got him riled up for matches by hitting him on the head with a hammer. His love of Nicholas is as fetishistic as it is conflicted, and all that is unresolved about Amin's strange fascination seems to spark a regression once he's in power, from affable wild card to violent, petulant child. Nicholas, of course, is a child as well, focused on his own thoughtless gratification. In one scene, his second illicit lover reminds him what they face if they're caught. He listens, then laughs. He's just imagined them back home in Edinburgh, at the dinner table with his parents. For all his veneer of "civilization," it's his blinkered narcissism that makes Nicholas so savagely dangerous to others.
 
 
 'The Last King of Scotland'

 
 MPAA rating:
 R for some strong violence and gruesome images, sexual content and language
 
 A Fox Searchlight Pictures release. Director Kevin Macdonald. Screenplay Peter Morgan, Jeremy Brock. Based on the novel by Giles Foden. Producers Andrea Calderwood, Lisa Bryer, Charles Steel. Director   

Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who terrorized his country in the 1970s and died in Saudi Arabian exile in 2003, granted himself many outlandish titles during his heinous eight-year reign, among them President for Life, and Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea. The self-proclaimed flourishes, so silly and even so playful, contrast all the more obscenely with the reality of Amin's brutality: Mercurial and paranoid, he presided over the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of people, even while his charisma and flamboyant eccentricities continued to charm the international press. Here was a monster who could turn from clown to executioner in a blink.
Adapted from the acclaimed 1998 novel of the same name by Giles Foden, The Last King of Scotland  takes its title from another of Amin's idiosyncrasies: The African despot had a fondness for all things Scot. And I can't think of a better actor to toggle between media-savvy jester and stone-cold killer than Forest Whitaker, who, even dressed in a kilt, conveys serious menace along with mania. A massively built man who projects the energy and nimbleness of someone daintier, he barrels through this story with great control masquerading as recklessness.  Yet Amin is just half the story  and Whitaker, given such rich source material, carries the easier half. The movie views Amin through the eyes of his personal physician, in a highly novelistic interpretation of reality. (Amin did have a Scottish doctor, but this one is a fabrication.) Recent med school grad Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), naive as Candide, arrives in Uganda on a whim, partly to do good and partly to party, which he does almost immediately with a fellow doctor's wife (Gillian Anderson). Garrigan is intrigued by Amin, and blind to his luxury-loving employer's evil far longer than he should be. Eventually, though  and in an escalation of stakes that tips the movie into the realm of overheated thriller  the truth becomes a threat to his life. The conclusion suggests, quite questionably, that only through the testimony of white men like the doctor could black Ugandans influence world awareness of Amin as a mass murderer.
The balance of star power would appear to be off-kilter  McAvoy so slight and Orlando Bloomish in a fictional role against Whitaker, who is so substantial in an all-stops-out biographical re-creation. But that disparity turns out to be the point on which the picture pivots. Drawing on a documentary visual style he deftly employed in One Day in September  and Touching the Void , director Kevin Macdonald uses McAvoy's boyishness to treat Garrigan's apolitical foolishness as yet another damn mess in one African country's hell. Indeed, the existence of people like Garrigan is one more reason why someone like Amin prevailed for as long, and as tragically, as he did.

 Strange to think that the flamboyantly lethal nut job Idi Amin died in Saudi Arabia just three years ago. About 80 at the time, he had fled Uganda in 1979 after murdering upwards of 300,000 souls. Larger than life physically and metaphorically, he was a former heavyweight boxing champion with a brilliant sense of leadership as a performance: as a dictator, his methods were brutally antediluvian, but his public relations cunning was consummately 20th century. Smiling into cameras, he dropped provocations like bombs: “I don’t like human flesh. It’s too salty for me.”  The queasily enjoyable new fiction film “The Last King of Scotland,” based on the novel by Giles Foden and directed by Kevin Macdonald, creates a portrait of this famous Ugandan dictator from inside the palace walls. Furiously paced, with excellent performances by Forest Whitaker as Amin and James McAvoy as the foolish Scotsman who becomes the leader’s personal physician, the film has texture, if not depth and enough intelligence to almost persuade you that it actually has something of note to say. It would make a terrific double bill with Barbet Schroeder’s mesmerizing 1974 documentary, “General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait,” of which Mr. Macdonald has obviously made a close and fruitful study.  As it also happens, “The Last King of Scotland” would make an even better double bill with Stephen Frears’s forthcoming film “The Queen,” a sly peek at the current British monarch in the wake of the death of Princess Diana. (Amin once wrote milady: “Dear Liz, if you want to know a real man, come to Kampala.”) Amin was an amateur merchant of death compared with the historic British monarchy, but he absorbed the lessons of its colonial tyranny fatally well.  “The Last King of Scotland” makes the case that Amin was rational enough to understand his country’s tangled relationship with British imperialism and to inject that sociopolitical understanding into words. If this lecture feels a little too neat and contrived, well, that’s entertainment.  And how! Cannily designed to please and repulse, “The Last King of Scotland” uses a self-anointed outsider, Nicholas Garrigan (Mr. McAvoy), as its initially empathic point of entry. Arriving in Uganda in the early 1970’s, this young doctor evinces an understandable wide-eyed enthusiasm and wonderment at the sights and sounds around him. He’s alive to his exciting new world, which the exceptional cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who shot Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” and Lars von Trier’s recent films, paints in deeply saturated color. The otherworldly Fauvist palette, as well as the interludes of frenetic cutting, at times recall the Brazilian art-house exploitation flick “City of God,” though Mr. Macdonald, who has a background in documentary, proves somewhat savvier about the politics of representation.  Crucial to that savvy is the director’s vision of Amin as Dr. Frankenstein and monster both. A period fiction with a high-gloss historical finish, “The Last King of Scotland” is also a very contemporary, pointedly resonant film about blowback. That said, and despite some background filler, Mr. Macdonald isn’t interested in furnishing history lessons, and the details of Britain’s African adventures remain largely unstated. In 1888, much as it did throughout Africa and the world, the British government gathered together dozens of different ethnic groups and various kingdoms under its control, naming this new protectorate and commercial venture Uganda. Many pounds of profit later, in 1962, Britain granted Uganda its independence; the African nation has been struggling to recover ever since.  In 1971 Amin ousted Milton Obote, who had become president after tossing out the country’s king five years earlier. (Mr. Obote himself may have been responsible for half a million deaths.) “The Last King of Scotland” opens shortly after Amin has seized power, and his madness had yet to take at least visible bloom. After a brief spell working at a clinic run by a white British doctor (Adam Kotz) and his wife (a very fine, almost unrecognizable Gillian Anderson), Garrigan signs on with Amin. The Scot eagerly makes the transition from rural slum to Amin’s Kampala compound, embracing his ready-made privilege as he drinks in the general’s charisma and hungrily feeds on his praise. A master of manipulation, this Amin knows a choice morsel when one flies into his trap.  Despite his vaguely Falstaffian proportions, Mr. Whitaker doesn’t look like the man he’s playing, a point that becomes less crucial as the performance takes root. As much a seducer as a destroyer, his Amin changes moods on a dime depending on the gas percolating in his bowels or the threats on his person, real and imagined. It’s a role rich in gristle and blood, and Mr. Whitaker makes the most of it, even if the performance and the film’s essential conception of Amin never push deep or hard enough. This actor can play devious, as his brilliant turn in “The Color of Money” showed early in his career. But what you need in a film about a man who fed the corpses of his victims to the crocodiles is something more, something hateful and vile.  “The Last King of Scotland” delivers shocks worthy of the horror film it becomes. Garrigan is the kind of man who exploits his own boyishness, successfully with women, perilously with Amin, and Mr. McAvoy expertly makes the character’s naïveté seem at first appealing, then foolish and finally odious in the extreme. As a stand-in for all the white men who have unwisely and cravenly journeyed into the proverbial heart of darkness, the character effectively serves his purposes, and you shake your head, tsk-tsk, right on schedule.  Clearly, the film means this journey to be as inwardly directed as outwardly bound, though the larger message here, one that might make you blanch after you nod, is that the misery of other people makes unsettling entertainment, no matter how pretty the pictures and valuable the players.  “The Last King of Scotland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is brutal violence from start to finish, including a scene of very graphic, believable-looking torture.

A supersized performance by Forest Whitaker dominates "The Last King of Scotland" and rightfully so, as he portrays one of recent history's great monsters, General Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Helmer Kevin Macdonald's plunge into full-fledged dramatic filmmaking after the partial crossover from documentaries in "Touching the Void" starts well, but trips over preposterous plot developments as it pushes toward its climax. Unusual material and a measure of critical acclaim will give this Fox Searchlight title a decent shot at good biz in specialized release.
Hugely charming when he wants to be, but with a changeability that can turn on a dime to appalling evil, Whitaker's Amin is a man with an iron whim who engages a Scottish doctor as his personal physician after being impressed with his handling of a roadside emergency. This is a fictionalized version of the dictator's rise, wallow in excess and lurch toward the abyss as seen by the brash young medic, based on the acclaimed 1998 novel by Giles Foden.
One improvement screenwriters Peter Morgan ("The Queen") and Jeremy Brock ("Mrs. Brown") make at the outset is turning the relatively bland do-gooder Scotsman of the book into a brash, cocky young adventurer who's ready for anything. Upgrade results in a Nicholas Garrigan, agreeably if not always sympathetically played by James McAvoy, who's not only more entertaining than his counterpart on the printed page, but more plausible as a devil-may-care guy who boldly speaks his mind to Amin while others cower in fright.
Picking Uganda virtually at random as a place where his new medical degree could be put to good use, Nicholas is first stationed at a remote village where he instantly puts the moves on older woman Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson), the attractive wife of the area's hard-working British physician (Adam Kotz). It's 1971, and together Nicholas and Sarah attend a rousing back-country rally where Amin, having just ousted the country's corrupt, communist-leaning leader, Milton Obote, dazzles the locals as well as the naive newcomer, to Sarah's consternation.
After the president's injured hand is neatly bandaged by Nicholas and he realizes the heritage of his chance benefactor, Amin, who long served in the King's African Rifles, sings the praises of the Scottish, deeming them among the bravest fighters on Earth. Director Macdonald, a Scotsman himself, stages a hilarious scene in which Amin appears at a public ceremony wearing a kilt surrounded by Africans performing a Scottish song.
Any misgivings erased by Amin's evident affinity for him, not to mention the leader's genuinely ingratiating persuasiveness, Nicholas accepts his new job and immediately reaps the rewards: a nice apartment within the immaculate presidential compound, a Mercedes convertible, women personally selected by Amin and, above all, unrestricted access to the big boss himself, who deliberately denigrates other members of his inner circle by calling Nicholas his closest adviser.
An alarming episode that only serves to strengthen the bond between the two men has Amin impulsively asking Nicholas to drive him to the airport in the convertible. En route, Amin's limousine, traveling ahead, is ambushed by gunmen. The aftermath, when the would-be assassins are dealt with, reveals to Nicholas the extent of Amin's fury for the first time.
This entire first section is quite engaging for several reasons: the fluky circumstances creating the main characters' bond (Amin's actual physician was Scottish, although much older), Whitaker's utterly convincing portrayal of Amin's larger-than-life appeal and moodiness, and the view the film provides of a rarely seen location, the attractively modern capital Kampala. This is reportedly the first Western production to shoot in Uganda since the second unit of "The African Queen" 56 years ago, and certainly the first time its main city has been shown. To have the action play out in its proper setting adds immensely to pic's interest.
Before long, however, intimations of Amin's misdeeds begin accumulating; judges, rival politicians and others go "missing," and Nicholas gets in hot water when he treats one of his boss's many children, an epileptic boy, and becomes ill-advisedly involved with the mother, Kay (Kerry Washington), an out-of-favor wife of the president.
No matter how impudent Nicholas is capable of being, and no matter how drunk at the time, his rash decision to get it on with a Mrs. Amin is ludicrous; it's a ruinous narrative ploy that signals the undue melodrama that overtakes the picture from this point on. Nicholas' fate and efforts to escape Uganda are linked to the pro-Palestinian hijacking of an Air France and the subsequent Israeli raid on Entebbe Airport, during which he suffers cruel and unusual punishment of the same nature as that endured by Richard Harris in "A Man Called Horse."
In the end, "The Last King of Scotland" is much better when it plays it cool and amusing than when it tries to ramp up outrage and indignation. Among its grace notes is the equivocal portrayal of British interests in the former colony, most prominently repped by an oily, persistent Foreign Service officer (an effective Simon McBurney) who's not as clueless as he seems. The debauchery of Amin's private life is glancingly conveyed by raucous party scenes; at one of them, Amin watches "Deep Throat" and seeks Nicholas' expert advice on the physiological possibility of Linda Lovelace's purported clitoral condition.
Drama moves along speedily, although there's a hasty, unartful look to the picture in general that lacks distinction.

In The Last King of Scotland , an adequate thriller redeemed by Forest Whitaker 's sensational turn as Idi Amin , freshly qualified Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan  (James McAvoy ) arrives in Uganda  in 1970, ravenous for adventure. Under the rigorous and vaguely romantic tutelage of a lithe blonde with a flabby marriage and a thick braid hanging delectably over her shoulder (helplessly played by Gillian Anderson  in Hollywood  shorthand for a help-the-natives do-gooder), young Garrigan, wearing pointy shirt-collars and a me-decade smirk, makes a brief stab at caring for the rural poor. But he's too feckless for the job, and soon a fateful encounter with a cow, a Maserati , and the new president rescues Garrigan for more glamorous pursuits as personal physician to Amin, who has such a thing for Scotland  that he saddles his many children with names like Campbell and Mackenzie. When her prescient warnings fall on deaf ears, the blonde departs with a withering backward glance, and thus do the good times roll for Amin and Garrigan two men gifted with an unerring talent for saying all the right things and making all the wrong moves. The difference being that one is responsible for the deaths of 1.5 million of his people.
The Last King of Scotland  deals with real events filtered through Giles Foden 's 1998 novel, in which Garrigan serves as a composite of numerous white advisers with whom Amin surrounded himself, then mercilessly cut off when they no longer served his purposes. This is the first excursion into narrative features by director Kevin Macdonald , whose Touching the Void , an impressive but hyperventilating tale of mountain survival, and One Day in September  , which replayed the Palestinian massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, were basically thrillers in documentary disguise. Working with fictional material seems to have unsettled Macdonald, for the action sequences feel hardworking and awkwardly derivative of Under Fire , Salvador  , and other superior thrillers of Westerners entangled in the legacy of imperialism. An audience with even the most cursory knowledge of the Uganda conflict will find itself way ahead of the hapless protagonist, who's caught up in a bloodbath spinning out of control; yet here, as is often the case with films about the third world, Peter Morgan  and Jeremy Brock 's expository screenplay doesn't trust us to have even the most rudimentary familiarity with the rise and fall of one of the world's most notorious despots, let alone those who put him in place. It falls to a diplomat, played with ferret-like cunning by Simon McBurney , to be the ventriloquist voice of two-faced English colonialism. "He's got a firm hand, the only thing Africa really understands," he says, priming us for the imminent volte-face in which the British embassy  begins plotting the ouster of a regime so horrific that even the willfully myopic Garrigan, increasingly compromised by Amin's escalating reign of terror, can't ignore its excesses. McAvoy's deftly drawn Garrigan, callow at first, then exponentially freaked by his own unwitting role in the sudden disappearance of dissidents and innocent bystanders, makes a compelling stand-in for the Ugly American growing an eleventh- hour conscience. But this versatile actor, last seen as Tumnus the faun in The Chronicles of Narnia , gracefully cedes the limelight to Whitaker, whose cunningly chameleonic performance makes us see how the mercurial Amin could so smoothly pull the wool over the eyes of a highly educated young Scot, not to mention an entire nation. Prankish, entranced by a good fart, witty and politically savvy, Whitaker's Amin can be the capering monkey or wild-eyed tyrant seen in countless television newsreels. But he's also much morea high roller overcompensating for a dirt-poor childhood, an astute manipulator of the West who hijacks a Palestinian plane-hijacking for his own political purposes, and finally a madman whose careening paranoia will undo his country and himself. Whitaker humanizes Amin without in any way excusing his manipulative seductions or his appalling brutality, and he emerges as a tragic template for the whole raft of African tin-pot dictators who have followed him, their promise misshapen by a long history of poverty and colonialism, and by the premature acquisition of unchecked power.
