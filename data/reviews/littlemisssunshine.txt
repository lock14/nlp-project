         "When all professions are open to all, and when one can reach the summit of each of them by oneself," Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about American democracy in the 1830s, foreshadowing the massive crisis in status anxiety that would eventually compel us to buy Hummers and use phrases like "new paradigm" with a straight face, "an immense and easy course seems to open before the ambition of men, and they willingly fancy that they have been called to great destinies. But that is an erroneous view corrected by experience every day."
 
  In "Little Miss Sunshine," an ordinary, middle-class family has erroneous views corrected by experience the hard way. Over the course of three harrowing days on a road trip, reluctantly embarked on so that their daughter may compete in a children's beauty pageant, the Hoovers come face to face with the cruel limits of their dreams, opportunities and possibilities. One by one they fail, despite their best efforts, their sincere desire to succeed and their many merits as people. In this way, the rambunctiously modest and unassuming comedy, which was acquired by Fox Searchlight at Sundance for a record $10.5 million (though you almost hate to mention the amount, given the moral of the story), is as ambitious, honest and subversive as any American movie since "Election."
 


         






    The Hoovers live in Albuquerque in a modest, wood-paneled tract house where dinner means chicken from a bucket. But they are consumed by fantasies of success that keep them locked in their separate worlds, struggling to measure up to impossibly high standards. Even their name is aspirational — they effortlessly hoover every message put out by a monolithic, inherently anti-humanist mass culture intent on reminding them of just how much they suck.
 
  Having devised a nine-step motivational program called "Refuse to Lose," Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) dreams of Tony Robbins-esque success but has so far only succeeded in burying his personality under a heap of irritating catch-phrases and driving his family crazy. His Nietzsche-reading step-son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has fashioned himself into a do-or-die superman by taking a vow of silence until he can fulfill his dream of getting accepted into the Air Force Academy. Grandpa (Alan Arkin), using what experience has taught him about winning and losing, has embraced hedonism late in life and gotten himself kicked out of his beloved retirement home for snorting heroin. Seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin), who is chubby, awkward and unself-consciously weird, spends her time rehearsing her Little Miss Sunshine talent routine and practicing her victorious meltdown in front of the television. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), the foremost Proust scholar in the United States, has been sent to stay with the Hoover family following a suicide attempt after the graduate student he loves runs off with the second-most-renowned Proust scholar in the nation. Meanwhile, his sister Sheryl (Toni Collette), who is married to Richard, keeps the family afloat financially, but is at a loss as to how to keep them from falling apart.
 
  Given the precariousness of their financial situation and the shaky emotional states of Dwayne and Frank, the Hoovers find themselves with no other choice but to travel to California together in their old VW bus. Before they've made it out of New Mexico, the clutch gives out, making it impossible for them to keep going without pushing the car, chasing it and hopping aboard like freight-hopping hobos as it barrels forward at full speed. Needless to say, the bus is a speeding, ramshackle symbol of you name it — the reckless endangerment demanded of average people by a winner-takes-all culture, a society coming apart at the wheels and, of course, the rickety ethos of a generation that forever cemented rule-breaking individualism with ostentatious material success.
 
  What keeps the characters — and the vehicle — from feeling as arbitrarily schematic as characters in a sitcom is that writer Michael Arndt and directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton understand how all of the characters have carefully constructed their identities from non-compatible, mass-produced kits. Consumed with becoming, the Hoovers are literally not themselves.
 
  Told as a picaresque road trip, "Little Miss Sunshine" employs razor-sharp humor and a deceptively realistic style to satirize a corrupt society that heroes of low status must navigate by their wits alone. The movie is exceptionally well cast with actors whose faces betray their humanity with every indignity they suffer (and there are lots of them, each funnier than the last). Carell gives a wonderfully wry and sensitive performance as a defrocked and humiliated eminence who ultimately learns to find solace in his subject — the epically morose but insightful Marcel Proust — rather than the external symbols of academic achievement. (Those will be handed, in a neat and tidy bundle, to his smarmy competitor Larry Sugarman.) But Kinnear, in particular, is heartbreaking as the picaresque hero straddling the line between his adopted role in society and the stigma of being himself, as he really is.
 
  "Little Miss Sunshine" hilariously punctures the grotesque bubble of the competitive American spirit in which "winners" are recognized by their rigorous ability to conform to the standards imposed by the market, and "losers" include anyone who won't bow to its mighty will.
 
  Watching a terrifyingly robotic emcee sing "America the Beautiful" to a gaggle of 7-year-olds tarted up to look like midget prostitutes, Richard squirms with recognition, his face collapsing under the pressure. You can almost see the scales falling from his eyes.
 
  The problem with the Hoovers is not necessarily that they've failed at the paths they've chosen but that society has pointed them down a series of blind cul-de-sacs and then handed them the blame for their own unhappiness.
 
  Which is really funny, when you think about it.   

All happy families are alike. All dysfunctional families, at least in the movies, are unhappy  and unhilarious  in different ways. If you're going to get on the wavelength of Little Miss Sunshine , you've got to be able to enjoy a comedy in which the characters fit into hermetically cute, predetermined sitcom slots. The members of the Hoover clan include the ineffectual boob of a father (Greg Kinnear), who's desperate to market his annoyingly unoriginal ''9 Steps'' motivational program; a saintly sourpuss mom (Toni Collette); her gay brother, a suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carell); the teen son (Paul Dano), who hates his family so much that he hasn't spoken in a year; and Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a grouch who stokes his X-rated I got nothin' to lose! commentary by snorting heroin.
Sorry, folks, but these are not organic characters; they're walking, talking catalogs of screenwriter index-card data. One can't deny, though, that there's an idiosyncratic plastic cleverness to Little Miss Sunshine . As the family drives to Redondo Beach so that 7-year-old Olive (the charming Abigail Breslin) can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine  preteen pageant, the movie shrouds its synthetic soul in a patina of ''indie'' realism: the leisurely rhythms, the lovely desert road-movie vistas, the terrific actors doing what they can to alchemize schlock into gold. The beauty-pageant climax is pure hypocrisy, as the movie mocks the freakish baby-whore contestants yet celebrates Olive for doing, in essence, just what they do. Smarmy? Yes, but more than that, not funny.

   The family that pops Prozac together stays together, perhaps, but the family that piles into an old Volkswagen bus the color of a banana surely has more entertainment value. That at least seems true of the happily (for us) unhappy relations at the center of the bittersweet comedy of dysfunction “Little Miss Sunshine,” a tale about genuine faith and manufactured glory that unwinds in the American Southwest, but more rightly takes place at the terminus of the American dream, where families are one bad break away from bankruptcy.  Written by the newcomer Michael Arndt, and directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, seasoned music-video directors making an effortless feature-film debut, “Little Miss Sunshine” relates the story of the Hoovers, just around the time that the youngish, harried Sheryl (Toni Collette) takes her suicidal brother, Frank (Steve Carell), under her wing. (“I’m glad you’re here,” she says. “That makes one of us,” he answers.) Straight from the hospital, Frank moves in with Sheryl’s family, including her 7-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin); teenage son, Dwayne (Paul Dano); husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear); and father-in-law, a heroin-tooting crank simply called Grandpa (Alan Arkin).  The bandages on Frank’s wrists are as fresh as his wounds when he enters the Hoovers’ fold, a dim burrow filled with clutter and noise. Eccentric families are a mainstay of comedy, and at least in their schematized personalities (the sullen son, the desperate dad), the Hoovers are not much different from most, despite the vials of white powder tucked in Grandpa’s fanny pack. They may be more downmarket than Wes Anderson’s Tenenbaums and a lot scruffier than the average big-studio clan. (Their kitchen looks as if it hasn’t been remodeled since Alice slaved for the Bradys.) But like most American comedy families, they are also a familiar social microcosm, a group of radically individualized souls in search of one another.  The means to that end is the competition of the film’s title, a child beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine. Soon after Frank moves in, Olive, a dumpling of a child with oversize glasses and a seemingly endless reserve of optimism, receives unexpected word that she has been invited to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, just days away.  Short of cash if not bright ideas, Richard decides to pile the fractious, reluctant brood into the family’s antique VW bus so that Olive can live out her dream and prove herself a winner. Much like Steinbeck’s Joads, the Beverly Hillbillies and millions of other westward-ho pioneers, the notably named Hoovers set a course for California, the land of sunshine, bleached teeth and eternal promise, leaving dusty Albuquerque behind.  “Little Miss Sunshine” doesn’t look particularly ambitious, in terms of either its narrative or its function-over-form visual style. But tucked in between all the hurt and the jokes, the character development and the across-the-board terrific performances is a surprisingly sharp look at contemporary America, one that sets the metaphor of the stage (and, by extension, competition) against the cherished myth of the open road. Like her father, who’s peddling a get-rich scheme, and like her brother, who yearns to fly the coop by becoming a jet pilot, Olive lives in a fantasy world that has become more real than her own life. When she watches a video of Miss America accepting her tiara, the image flickers in her eyeglasses, but it might as well be projected on her frontal lobe.  It’s on the road that the Hoovers first lose and then find themselves, both as individuals and as a family. There is engine trouble, naturally, which leads to a delightful sight gag that involves Richard tucked behind the wheel as the rest of the family pushes — then scrambles inside — the bus. An emblem of an earlier, possibly more freewheeling era, this temporary mobile home seems an unlikely vehicle for transformation, but it takes the Hoovers across state lines and through a series of emotional and psychological roadblocks. In between the fast-food joints, hot tears and hurled insults, there are wide-open spaces and a suggestion of freedom along with a sign for the “Carefree Highway,” an actual state route that here seems more like a cruel joke.  For the most part, the jokes and the sensibility are more kind than not in “Little Miss Sunshine,” which motors forward on the strength of its seamless ensemble and direction, and its touching human comedy. Mr. Arndt unleashes scads of deftly funny one-liners and situations, the best of which float along on sheer absurdity, like the collision between some pornographic rags and Marcel Proust. The jokes don’t land as lightly when they come with a message tied to the punch line, especially as the Hoovers near the Little Miss Sunshine competition, a ghastly spectacle that features underage fleshpots writhing to pounding beats while weighed down by sequins and parental vainglory. Graham Greene’s description of Shirley Temple’s appeal as “interestingly decadent”  could not be more apt.  However true to life, the Little Miss Sunshine competition comes accompanied by a whiff of class snobbishness. Richard weighs in as a total middle manager, the type of man who has read one too many self-help books. But, as the nods to Proust and Nietzsche suggest — and that VW bus, with its intimation of 1960’s rebellion, underscores — the Hoovers are clearly not meant to be cut from the same tacky cloth as the rest of the pageant parents, who smother their daughters in spray-on bronzer and expectation. In a different film, one not as generous of spirit (or funny), that snobbishness might seem insufferable. Yet there’s a melancholy here that clings to this family, which however triumphant and united, may well remain stuck in the national Hooversville located at the crossroads of hope and despair.  “Little Miss Sunshine” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some salty language, but nothing anyone sentient hasn’t heard before.

Veteran husband-and-wife musicvideo and commercials team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris make a disarming segue into features with "Little Miss Sunshine," a quietly antic dysfunctional family road trip comedy that shoots down the all-American culture of the winner and offers sweet redemption for losers -- or at least the ordinary folks often branded as such. Pic's distinguished by a flawless cast, a gentle spirit of rebellion and a smart script by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt that knows never to push its character quirks too hard. Its humanity and heart make it a natural to transcend the indie niche to a broader audience.
Within hours of its premiere at Sundance, Fox Searchlight swooped in to close a worldwide distribution deal on the film, snagging the specialty division a release that stands a chance of being molded into another crossover hit on the order of its Park City pickups "Garden State" and "Napoleon Dynamite."
Like the broken-down VW bus that transports the Hoovers from their home in Albuquerque, N.M., on a foolhardy but determined mission to Redondo Beach, Calif., the filmmakers have an astute understanding that a family is a wildly imperfect machine, made up of ill-fitting components and prone to malfunctions minor and major.
A sharply cut opening sequence of quick character-establishing scenes underlines that this is an especially problematic clan.
Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker on a career downslide yet stubbornly committed to his "Refuse to lose" philosophy. His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) barely disguises her impatience with his canned claptrap, hinting at deeper marital disharmony. Their teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a Nietzsche devotee maintaining a vow of silence until he's old enough to become a fighter pilot, while Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a profane old horndog with a heroin habit. Newest addition to the household is Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell), a renowned Proust scholar who lost both the male grad student he loved and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant to a rival academic.
The family's sole oasis of serenity and self-possession is Olive (Abigail Breslin), a slightly chubby, bespectacled 7-year-old with a questioning nature and a fixation on beauty pageants. Having been taught to pursue her dreams, Olive has been privately rehearsing her talent routine with Grandpa; her shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown is the engine that drives the comedy.
There are probably few more obvious emblems of soulless success than a children's beauty contest. And the notion that Olive would somehow get onstage without her parents having any knowledge of the act she was preparing -- or any misgivings until the last minute about the potential humiliation she's being subjected to -- seems implausible. But as a chaotic, cathartic bonding experience, it works, in part because the family members are so caught up in their individual frustrations and insecurities.
During the interstate trip, punctuated by hilarious setbacks and disasters, the directors nurture the melancholy strain in Arndt's script while subtly coaxing small signs of love and support within the Hoover family. The eccentric comic tone is deftly channeled by a cast with no weak element. As a guy who seemingly buys into the most trite prefab pop-psych blather but gradually reveals his deeper sensitivity, Kinnear has never been better, while Collette does lovely, understated work as an emotionally burdened, abraded woman whose caring nature is never in doubt.
Following "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "The Office," Carell shows further evidence he's the real deal with his morosely deadpan characterization. Arkin gets the best lines as the irascible oldster with no politeness filter.
Dano plays an introspective teen different from his character in "L.I.E." Communicating only with terse notes such as "I hate everyone" for much of the movie, he's both funny and affecting. Gracefully sidestepping all the usual traps of too-cute screen tykes, Breslin is a delight, anchoring the comedy with a balance of guilelessness and innate wisdom as a kid who marches to her own drummer.
The directors' light, uncalculated touch with the material is echoed in the modest production's fresh, appealingly unslick feel. Tim Suhrstedt's widescreen lensing is notable for its agitated movement and quirky but unforced visual compositions, while the score by Mychael Danna and performers DeVotchka supplies warm, animated rhythms.

Like the shambling VW van its hapless characters steer from Albuquerque  to Redondo Beach , Little Miss Sunshine  is a rickety vehicle that travels mostly downhill. How this antic extended sitcom from first-time feature makers Jonathan Dayton  and Valerie Faris  left Sundance with an eight-figure deal and reams of enthralled press clippings is beyond comprehension, even factoring in its big-name ensemble and the predisposition of festival audiences to pat a film about lovable losers on the head.
A grating black comedy about the paralyzing fear of not being strong, successful, or skinny enough, Little Miss Sunshine  means to indict our national obsession with winners and the stigma of coming in second. The opening sequence introduces dad Richard (Greg Kinnear ) delivering a motivational nine-step pep talk with mounting fervor. Big surprise: The very next shot reveals his audience as a few stragglers in a dingy classroom. At home, cantankerous Grandpa (Alan Arkin ) settles in for his favorite leisure activitysnorting heroin while mop-topped teenage Dwayne (Paul Dano ) hits the weights in a sullen vow of silence under a giant Nietzsche  poster.
In the next room, seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin ) stares through glasses at a TV beauty pageant. The camera settles in a hospital ward, on the sodden misery of Uncle Frank (Steve Carell )a gay Proust scholar who cut his wrists after losing his lover to an academic rival. Over his scowling face, the words appear: "Little Miss Sunshine." This is called irony. With Frank sequestered in Dwayne's room on suicide watch, the bickering household gathers for dinnerthe movie pauses to chortle over a gauche Mayor McCheese cup on the tablejust as a fluke announcement makes Olive a contender for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest. Gung ho Richard convinces wife Sheryl (Toni Collette ) to make the 700-mile drive in the family's decrepit van, and the others reluctantly sign onfor no better reason than that's what characters in shaky farces do.
Little Miss Sunshine  is the latest in a long line of Sundance clunkers, from Happy, Texas  to Me and You and Everyone We Know , that seems to have developed its impression of human behavior from incomplete space transmissions. Why does Sheryl, who doesn't want to take the van because she can't drive stick, suddenly decide when they're already on the road that she needs to learn? So the gears can go out, turning the van into a rolling junkyard that requires group pushing. How does Richard manage to sweet-talk a biker into loaning him a ride? That scene, in a Preston Sturges  movie, might've been a pipan illustration of the power of can-do optimism, that pure-grade American snake oil, to hypnotize even the skeptical. But the movie just breezes on by, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for a stranger to hand over his bike. By the time the family makes a hospital getaway with a loved one in the trunk, the characters have edged from foolish to humanly unrecognizable.
The pity is that there are strains of tenderness and generosity here: an affectionate scene between Grandpa and Olive comes as sweet relief, mainly because Arkin's character momentarily becomes a person instead of a wheezy comic device. (Can anyone remember the last time the Foulmouthed Grandpa bit was funny?) And occasionally the directors capture an unexpected bit of beauty or freedomlike Carell's cakewalk bolt toward the rolling van's doors, or a lyrical shot from underneath a whorled overpass.
The movie's platitudinous payoffwinning isn't everything, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, etc.would go down a lot easier if Little Miss Sunshine didn't roam from scene to scene searching for new characters to patronize. A sequence with a brusque hospital "bereavement liaison" (Paula Newsome ) comes off thuddingly sour, but the beauty pageant finale is the nadir. To engineer a happy endingthe heroes mustn't look like losersthe movie has to make everyone else look worse. Thus the contestants are made up into grotesque little kewpie whores, while the adults include a helmet-haired harridan organizer, a leering emcee, and an audience of snooty stage moms. Even as a metaphor for What's Wrong With America"Life is just one fucking beauty contest after another," offers one character helpfullyit goes past comic exaggeration into cruelty.
And yet Little Miss Sunshine  saves its one belly laugh for this scene, which not coincidentally is the movie's only left-field surprise: Olive's glaringly inappropriate (or is it inadvertently appropriate?) talent contest specialty, one of exactly two punches the movie doesn't telegraph. (The other involves Carell's reading material, and it's not Remembrance of Things Past .) As for the rest of this desperately contrived farcewouldja settle for Little Miss Congeniality?
