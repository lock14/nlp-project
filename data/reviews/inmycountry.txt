         "In My Country" is the kind of serious, intelligent probing of the work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up by the government in 1996 to investigate human rights abuses under apartheid, that one would expect from a director of the caliber of John Boorman. He has confronted the horrors straight on but has been stymied by a ponderous script adapted by Ann Peacock from the book "Country of My Skull" by Afrikaans poet Antjie Krog.
 
  Boorman's stars Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson are valiant — even impressive — but they cannot rescue this grueling film or its mechanical plot. "In My Country" is a thoughtful, wholly worthy endeavor of considerable craftsmanship and skill, which is also very tough going, not merely because of the bleakness of its subject but also because of the way in which its story is told.
 


         






    Set nearly a decade ago, "In My Country" finds Binoche's Anna — an Afrikaner poet and a daughter of landed gentry who is preparing to cover the commission hearings for South African state radio and NPR — clashing almost immediately with the Washington Post's Langston Whitfield (Jackson). Idealistic and impassioned, Anna embraces wholeheartedly the commission's decision to proceed in accordance with the African principle of ubuntu,
 which seeks to establish harmony among all people by absolving transgressions rather than seeking retribution for them.
 
  Those guilty of human rights abuses, mainly white members of the military or law enforcement, are confronted in court by their victims or the relatives of victims. The accused can then seek amnesty if they can demonstrate that they were following orders when they resorted to abuse and torture. As a black American who says he has been made to feel unwanted every day of his life, Langston sees the commission as merely allowing perpetrators to escape punishment. He also asks, "How can there be any reconciliation when whites control 90% of the country's wealth?"
 
  Anna and Langston are strong people prepared to wear each other down, and he starts to mellow in the face of Anna's steadfast sincerity of purpose, just as she learns from him that as an Afrikaner there's no way she can absolve herself from responsibility for apartheid and its long-standing systematic injustice and cruelty. As part of his coverage, Langston tracks down Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), the most notorious South African police torturer, and persuades him to open up in order to bring down many others involved. Apart from Anna and Langston, other characters tend to be sketchy.
 
  "In My Country" is unfortunately more didactic than dramatic, and although surprises emerge right up to the end, there's precious little suspense, mystery or uncertainty.
 
  The film's narrative stance may be too dead-on, for it creates the feeling that it might have been more powerful had it had a more oblique, revelatory approach.
 
  Yet such a feeling points to the larger issue that the entire film has been told too much from the outside. Even though their understanding evolves, Anna and Langston are from the start sophisticated, educated, principled individuals whose responses to the working of the commission — and to each other — are predictable.
 
  It would seem that "In My Country," to get to the dark heart of the matter, should have been about a torturer and his victim, rather than a pair of reporters covering an after-the-fact investigation.

Just when you thought Hotel Rwanda  had rendered obsolete the sort of neocolonial uplift that investigates black trauma through a white person's eyes, along comes In My Country . It's set in South Africa in 1996, and, as directed by John Boorman, it's like a Richard Attenborough film made for the Lifetime channel. Boorman dramatizes the actions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was formed by Nelson Mandela to investigate human rights abuses under apartheid. Its mission wasn't to mete out punishment; it was to create a public setting in which victims of the Afrikaner regime could confront the officers who'd tortured and killed their relatives.
Boorman creates affecting and tense moments in the commission room. As stories of atrocity unfold  a boy's hands cut off, a man's genitals tied with wire before he is given electroshock  the victims' relatives howl in agony, and the men who committed the crimes stare and say, ''I was just following orders.'' After a while, though, you notice that none of the relatives are allowed to become characters. Instead, In My Country  hinges on the friendship, and rather starchy romance, of Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaans poet and journalist, and Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson), a testy Washington Post reporter. The movie is the story of Anna's enlightenment  how she confronts her denial of any connection to the brutal government under which she prospered. In My Country , in other words, doesn't so much explore as use the tragedy of black South Africa to give its heroine a righteous slap of nobility.

hey rise up like the dead at the day of reckoning, voice after voice, story after story, the troubled history of a shameful past," muses Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an anguished South African poet and journalist attending public hearings conducted in the late 1990's by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Anna, whose on-the-scene dispatches are carried on South African state radio and on National Public Radio in the United States, is the weepy, hand-wringing conscience of John Boorman's high-minded but hopelessly wooden film "In My Country." At the commission's hearings, conducted from 1996 to 1998, the commission investigating human rights abuses during apartheid took testimony from more than 20,000 witnesses; 2,000 testified publicly. As the predominantly black victims confronted their tormenters face to face in the courtroom, many broke down, recalling atrocities, kidnappings and the disappearance of loved ones. The perpetrators, in turn, were promised amnesty if they faced up to their deeds, told the whole ugly truth, expressed contrition and could prove that their crimes were politically motivated. That old standby, "I was only following orders," was the usual excuse. The hearings upheld the South African principle of "ubuntu," which pursues reconciliation instead of revenge by absolving all sides of their transgressions. Anna has strict instructions from her boss to keep her reports under 40 seconds. At one point her supervisor calls to praise her for having captured an especially bloodcurdling courtroom scream. In this grindingly earnest film, that congratulation sounds a rare and welcome note of media cynicism. The movie reconstructs choice tidbits of the testimony given by a tiny sampling of victims, all but one of them black. Their graphic descriptions of rape and emasculation, of tongues being severed and of burying what body parts they can retrieve of loved ones are at once too much and not enough. Sandwiched between numbing paragraphs of point-counterpoint argument, these shattering fragments are rushed and feel as jarring as screams erupting during a prayer meeting. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir "Country of My Skull," makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces. Even when they modify their positions, the people remain too schematic for you to sense an emotional groundswell that isn't meticulously preprogrammed. Anna meets her rhetorical match in Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson), a surly reporter for The Washington Post who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. To him, forgiveness is unimaginable and the forum seems just another diabolical trick to take white supremacists off the hook. As Anna's na�ve idealism collides with Langston's bitterness, the movie has a chance to come to life. But in a turn of events that occurs without psychological preparation, Anna, who is married with three children, and Langston, a married family man, begin an affair. The chemistry between Mr. Jackson and Ms. Binoche (whose Afrikaans accent is shaky at best) is nonexistent. In their love scenes, Mr. Jackson, who appears stiff and uncomfortable throughout the film, seems lost in thought. But the affair provides an excuse for Anna to utter one of the most stilted goodbyes in movie history when it's time to part: "My skin will never forget you." Her affair and its aftermath shoehorn a distracting extra layer of meaning into the movie by dragging issues of betrayal and forgiveness from the courtroom into the bedroom. Every few minutes the film awkwardly splices in another segment of Langston's continuing interview with Colonel De Jager, a fictional torture-loving white South African police chief, played by Brendan Gleeson with a nasty gleam in his eye. When he taunts Langston with his descriptions of the orgiastic fun at a secret torture farm, he chortles fiendishly about how practicing torture, mutilation and castration is "better than sex." As "In My Country" winds down, it makes sure that everyone shoulders a measure of guilt. Anna discovers a skeleton in her own family closet, while her free-spirited black South African assistant, Dumi Mkhalipi (Menzi Ngubane), also turns out to have blood on his hands. So much for the good guys and the bad, the film sermonizes; we are all culpable. Guilt rules. "In My Country" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, and its graphic testimony pulls no punches.

The combo of cultural cringe and a schematic, didactic screenplay strangles the human emotion in "Country of My Skull," an unquestionably sincere but dramatically stillborn outing by veteran John Boorman set during South Africa's mid-1990s reckoning with its apartheid past. As American and Afrikaans reporters covering the Truth & Reconciliation Commission hearings, Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche trade dialogue more fitting to ethno-political spokespeople than to characters caught up in a country trying to heal its wounds. Given its subject matter, pic undoubtedly will engender reams of earnest coverage, but average auds look unlikely to respond in sizeable numbers.
Film is a particular disappointment coming from 71-year-old Boorman, whose last picture, the quirky John le Carre adaptation "The Tailor of Panama" (2001), though a B.O. disappointment, showed him still bringing a personal style to material. Helmer's career has been dotted with pictures that play out human dramas in on-the-cusp settings ("Hell in the Pacific," "Hope & Glory," "Beyond Rangoon," "The General"), but in "Country" the director, who traveled widely in South Africa during apartheid, doesn't rise above the clunky screenplay.
Pic is based on a personal account of the TRC hearings by Afrikaans poet Antjie Krog, who was commissioned to cover the event by state radio and a local newspaper. From this, South African-born, L.A.-based scripter Ann Peacock has hewn an achingly well-meaning screenplay that decorates the old chestnut of a foreigner finding romance and personal fulfillment in an exotic location with a selection of confessions drawn from the actual hearings. Though its intent is admirable, its execution is both clumsy and emotionally distancing.
Jackson plays hard-nosed Washington Post journo Langston Whitfield, dispatched to cover the TRC hearings in December 1995 and interview (the fictional) Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), who was responsible for the apartheid policing.
Whitfield initially is skeptical of the assignment, telling his editor, "I don't have to travel 5,000 miles to interview a white cop killing black folk; I can do that in my own back yard."
As he says farewell to his family, Whitfield's wife hints at flaws in his character with the words, "If you learn anything about reconciliation, let me know."
Opening reels are full of expository, right-on dialogue as we meet Anna Malan (Binoche), the fictional version of Krog, who has issues with her Afrikaans family but is proud of the solution the country has come up with to settle its past. Unlike a war-crimes tribunal, which seeks retribution, the TRC favors a mutually healing African solution, giving amnesty to anyone who fully confesses past transgressions.
As Whitfield is frequently told, this is based on the African philosophy of "ubuntu," the link that binds individuals to their community, where one's transgression harms everyone.
As soon as they meet at a TRC hearing, Whitfield and Malan are facing off over race, color and every issue on the North-South political agenda, as he brings an American perspective to what she sees as a reason for both African and Afrikaaner pride. In one of the sharper lines in the script, Malan tells him, "We can't climb back on a plane afterwards."
That's exactly what Whitfield does at the end, though not before he's learned respect for local customs, become a wiser person, bedded Malan and been given a fancy artifact for his son back in D.C. For good measure, Malan also profits from meeting Whitfield ("My skin will never forget you," she coos poetically), as well as discovering a skeleton in her own family closet.
Early on, the movie settles down into a regular rhythm, shuttlecocking between Whitfield and Anna's evolving relationship; TRC seshes in which painful past events are disinterred; and Whitfield's interview with De Jager in the latter's heavily guarded home. The last, chopped up and scattered throughout pic, fails to develop much dramatic power, despite Gleeson's potentially fine perf as the embodiment of coolly reasoning evil.
Jackson largely gives a stiff, straight-up perf as Whitfield, and there's little natural chemistry between him and Binoche when they're not trading cultural and political points. Latter gives a reasonable approximation of an Afrikaans accent but doesn't create much of a character to root for on a human level. Both thesps are at their most relaxed alongside charismatic young TV star Menzi "Ngubs" Ngubane, as Malan's sprightly, wisecracking assistant. "Guess who's coming to dinner," jokes Ngubane, as Malan takes Whitfield off to meet her folks.
More touches like that would have helped take the PC cringe out of the screenplay and strengthened the emotional clout inherent in the material. (Fiona Ramsay is also, too briefly, fine in this respect as Malan's no-nonsense boss.) As a result, the TRC sessions, though admirable in their intention, don't engage the viewer as they should.
Tech credits are pro but with no special flavor, neither gritty nor glossy, and eschewing Boorman's usual widescreen format. Seamus Deasy's lensing creates a believable backdrop from South African locations. If only the same could be said for the figures within it.

Rejecting vengeance in favor of an almost unimaginable well of forgiveness, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  marked an extraordinary reckoning with South Africa 's blighted recent past: Those guilty of violent acts during the apartheid era could seek amnesty if they confessed their crimes truthfully, expressed contrition, and could show they were following orders issued from above. John Boorman 's schematic treatment of the hearings, in which victims and perpetrators came face to face, centers on Anna (Juliette Binoche ), a white Afrikaner poet covering the commission for radio, and Langston (Samuel L. Jackson ), an African American reporter for The Washington Post  . That's right, one of the first fiction features on Truth and Reconciliation doesn't bother to recruit a rep for black South Africansunless you count Anna's ever cheerful sound engineer or a bunch of anonymous grieving mothersand prefers to stand by and watch as guilt-ridden Anna and righteous Langston fight and fuck their way across the cultural divide. Boorman's bathetic tourism is unconscionable for a subject of this magnitude; for an infinitely superior account of this chapter of South African history, seek out the documentary Long Night's Journey Into Day .
