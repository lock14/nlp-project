Don't be fooled by the star wattage: "Management" is a small, underwhelming indie comedy about the cuteness of the long-distance stalker.
True, it's a subject the movies have often visited with varying comic returns, from "The Graduate" (Elaine!) to "The Heartbreak Kid" to all those Sundance movies about a noodgy guy pestering his dream girl until she caves in to his questionable charms. Here, the charm curdles fast. What playwright-turned-screenwriter/director Stephen Belber finds adorable, a reasonable person might consider actionable.
Steve Zahn plays the noodge, Mike, a night manager at an Arizona highway motel run by his parents (Fred Ward and Margo Martindale). Jennifer Aniston is the dream girl, Sue, a neatly pressed business traveler who sells office-place artwork and has vague dreams of making the world a better place. Mike is stalled in life until Sue checks in; instantly smitten, he turns up at her room with a dusty bottle of wine, compliments of hotel management.
There are some laughs in the hero's fumbling attempts at romance  - he sounds like a toddler trying to talk Shakespeare  - and Aniston nicely conveys Sue's alarm with body language and widening eyes alone. Then the script demands that something quite unbelievable happen, and the movie's off on a poky cross-country courtship that finally comes to ground in Portland, Ore.
There Sue is living with a glowering punk-rock yogurt magnate named Jango (Woody Harrelson, just punching the clock), and Mike is resorting to such ploys as parachuting into her swimming pool and crooning Bad Company songs outside her window to attract his true love's attention. By now it's clear that neither actor is able to get a handle on characters who live mostly on the page.
Somewhere inside this slowly paced whimsy is a pained and rather more honest movie about the difficulty of finding one's role in the world  -  or what some people might call "growing up." Only in the final sequences, though, does "Management" allow real tenderness to shoot forth and you glimpse what might have been.
Belber also seems oblivious to the creepier aspects of his hero's amour fou: Mike repeatedly turns up at Sue's job, leaves her too many voice mails, and ultimately lives in a windowless basement while plotting to conquer her heart. Or maybe there have just been too many recent news stories about men violently refusing to take no for an answer for this movie's intended sweetness not to turn sour.
Sometimes a cute-stalker movie can win the audience's heart. "Management" only makes you ponder the line between true love and a restraining order.

Isn't it time Steve Zahn grew up? Ever since the '90s, this walking quirk of an actor has pushed his dazed solipsistic zaniness (he's like Michael J. Fox’s hillbilly cousin), but he's 41 now, and it no longer looks cute on him. In the indie dud Management , he's a slacker motel clerk who comes on to a guest  a corporate lonely girl played by Jennifer Aniston in lank brown hair and a why-did-I-ever-say-yes-to-this-script? grimace. She proceeds to not treat him like the benignly annoying stalker he is. The scene in which Zahn, standing outside Aniston's house, performs an off-key-warbling-plus-electric-piano rendition of Bad Company's ''Feel Like Makin' Love'' is obviously intended to be a parody of John Cusack's famous boom-box serenade in Say Anything . But here's a question for contemplation: Just because the moment is meant  to be cringe-worthy, does that make the cringing any less painful?

 If hell is a place of soul-crushing boredom, the Kingman Motor Inn, the Arizona hostelry in which Stephen Belber’s off-kilter romantic comedy “Management” sputters to a start, is a gateway to damnation. This anonymous, sunbaked depot is where 38-year-old Mike Cranshaw (Steve Zahn) works as the night manager, repairing backed-up toilets and discharging other odd jobs under the watchful eyes of his parents, Jerry (Fred Ward) and Trish (Margo Martindale), who own the place.  Mike’s dead-end existence is unsettled by a sudden glimpse of heaven when an attractive guest, Sue Claussen (Jennifer Aniston),  who sells the kind of sterile corporate art found on motel walls, checks in for a short stay. With stalkerlike persistence, the pesky Mike courts her with a bottle of wine, “compliments of management,” which he insists they drink together, followed later by cheap champagne.  Worn down and impatient to be rid of him, Sue finally allows Mike to put his hand on her behind. A spark is struck, and just before returning to her home in Baltimore, she initiates an afternoon fling in the laundry room. Then she leaves Arizona without a second thought. Mike, of course, is besotted.  This absurdist comedy is about a not-so-young, not-so-glamorous man who forges a pathway out of hell after being struck by romantic lightning. Mike may be a bumbling sad sack, but Mr. Zahn gives him just enough spunky appeal to lend this unlikely fly-by-afternoon coupling  and its consequences a shred of credibility.  In pursuit of his dream girl, Mike spends his last dime on a one-way ticket to Baltimore. Sue has to pay his way back to Arizona. Eventually, however, his route to salvation carries him to Aberdeen, Wash., where Sue has gone to live with Jango, a former punk-rocker turned organic-yogurt mogul, played by  Woody Harrelson as a fire-breathing, wild-eyed maniac.  “Management” aspires to be a hybrid of that great-granddaddy of modern romantic comedies about uncomfortable male initiation, “The Graduate,” and smart American road-trip comedies like “Flirting With Disaster” and “Little Miss Sunshine.” If it isn’t half as good — or as funny — as its forerunners, it maintains its integrity as a small, sweet-natured comedy that refuses to obey the commercial dictates of Hollywood by allowing its characters to determine their own zany destinies.  In Aberdeen, Mike talks his way into a job in a Chinese restaurant where he meets his new best friend, Al (James Liao), a fellow employee whom he enlists in a vaguely creepy surveillance operation at Jango’s estate. Mike is so fixated on Sue that he skydives out of a plane into Jango’s swimming pool. Here is where “Management” turns into a screwball farce: it temporarily loses its bearings when it follows Mike into a Buddhist monastery for a period of reflection.  “Management” takes it on faith that there are exits from the cul-de-sacs of American life,  that  lives can have second and third acts, that losers can shake off defeat. Through his misadventures  Mike metamorphoses from superannuated boy into likable grown-up with his endearing childlike traits intact.  It takes an indie movie like “Management” or the 2002 film “The Good Girl” to reveal Ms. Aniston as an actor capable of uncovering darker elements within her usually bland persona of the grown-up girl next door. Underacting, she subtly conveys the loneliness and insecurity beneath Sue’s brusque, self-contained facade.  Sue first shows her humanitarian streak in a scene in which she hands out Burger King coupons to the homeless. Her real dream is to open a food kitchen for the poor. “Management” has a generosity of spirit that makes you believe that good people summoning a lot of pluck can make good things happen.  “Management” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

Neatly mixing whimsical quirkiness, straight-faced absurdity and affecting melancholy, "Management" is a slight but likable dramedy that signals a promising directorial debut for playwright-screenwriter Stephen Belber ("Tape," "The Laramie Project"). Pic benefits greatly from appealing perfs by Jennifer Aniston and Steve Zahn, who deftly apply darker emotional shadings to their characters when necessary, and equally fine work from a small ensemble of solid supporting players. It may be difficult for an indie so unassumingly low-key to gain traction in the ever-more-brutally competitive theatrical marketplace. But appreciative reviews and favorable word of mouth could generate interest among homevid viewers.
Plot pivots on a serendipitous encounter between Sue (Aniston), a stressed-for-success sales rep for a company specializing in "corporate art," and Mike (Zahn), an aimless guy in his early 30s employed by his taciturn father (Fred Ward) and ailing mother (Margo Martindale) at an Arizona roadside motel where Sue providentially checks in.
Mostly out of boredom -- but perhaps partly out of pent-up need for intimacy -- Sue impulsively gives in to Mike's amusingly maladroit come-on. The lead-up to their one-night stand (or, more precisely, one-afternoon quickie) is more than a tad unsettling, given that Mike comes across early on as the most socially awkward motel employee this side of Norman Bates. And the potential for stalker-style melodrama is hardly dissipated when Mike, instantly smitten, decides to follow Sue home to Maryland.
Though her initial response isn't exactly enthusiastic, Sue agrees to hang out with Mike for a couple days, gradually revealing that, despite her tightly compartmentalized approach to life, she's a generous soul who dreams of operating a homeless shelter. Trouble is, she also reveals that she's not entirely over her relationship with Jango (Woody Harrelson), a former punk-rock star who's now a prosperous yogurt mogul.
Proceeding at an amiably unhurried pace, "Management" compels interest and invites empathy by subtly showing how Sue and Mike -- and, to a lesser degree, Mike's father -- are stuck in unfulfilling lives that they are only half-successfully "managing." 
The central relationship at the heart of the pic never entirely transcends contrivance. But Zahn and Aniston are very good at persuasively suggesting a genuine soulmate connection.
Harrelson doesn't appear until the 53-minute mark, but he craftily swipes scenes with self-satirizing swagger. Without half trying, he gets the pic's biggest laugh with a throwaway description of Ed McMahon as a fellow party animal. 
With even less screen time, Ward makes an equally strong impression with his precise underplaying as Mike's stoic yet discontented father. Martindale displays down-to-earth grace during her final scene, and newcomer James Liao earns chuckles as an underachieving stoner who helps Mike land a temporary job at his parents' Chinese restaurant.
The soft- and alt-rock score is pleasantly effective, but pic's true musical highlight is a rousing rendition of '70s Bad Company golden-oldie "Feel Like Makin' Love" as a plaintive romantic serenade. Production values are adequate, with Oregon locales capably serving as settings in three different states.
