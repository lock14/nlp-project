         The architecture of New York City is the canvas for graffiti artists Blest (Mark Webber) and Buk 50 (Gano Grills) in writer-director Adam Bhala Lough's hip-hop fueled drama, "Bomb the System." The duo leave their brightly colored scrawls across the urban landscape in nocturnal "bombing" runs with the police in constant pursuit while philosophically discussing their need to "write."
 
  Lough's impressive, if uneven, debut feature captures the adrenaline rush and contradictory nature of the simultaneously creative and criminal activity but stumbles in its attempt to justify it as an art form. Collaborating closely with composer El P and veteran editor Jay Rabinowitz — who's worked with Jim Jarmusch, among others — Lough finds inspiration in the beats and rhythms of the music, giving the film's pacing a suitably jagged edge. Likewise, the film's visuals explode the primary colors used by the graffiti artists like neon across the dark alleys and shadowy fire escapes they favor.
 


         






    The highly stylized tags made with markers and spray paint generally consist of the writers' names in large, interlocking letters or intricately laced initials. It is their primary means of expression and their way of proclaiming their identities. For Blest and Buk 50, whose real names are Anthony and Justin, respectively, graffiti is every bit as addictive as the various narcotics that fuel their nightly runs. Their crew has become one of Manhattan's most notorious, and they are targeted by the NYPD's Vandal Squad, created to crack down on graffiti.
 
  When Kevin (Jade Yorker), Justin's younger brother and a tagger in training under the nom de spray can of Lune, is beaten and arrested by a rogue member of the squad, the almost comically corrupt Bobby Cox (Al Sapienza), war is declared on the cops. Anthony, however, is distracted by a young female bomber named Alex (Jaclyn DeSantis), and a rift forms with Justin, who questions Blest's commitment to the cause.
 
  What that cause is is open to debate. Some of the film's weaker moments come when its characters try to rationalize their need to create art in the form of tags. It's an impassioned argument, but much of it sounds like mere rhetoric without a legitimate voice of dissent. Anthony and Justin are obviously talented and espouse the inherent need to make their mark, but when contrasted with the far more political work of Alex and her friends, it seems more like ego.
 
  Also hurting the film is the fact that the central character, Anthony, is so self-absorbed. A white kid from suburban Queens, his existence in Manhattan is almost dreamlike, a homage to his late older brother, Lazaro, a legendary tagger who scrawled his name on the Brooklyn Bridge the night he died. There is a sense Anthony is slumming in this underworld of gonzo art — which Lough portrays with great authenticity — and that he can escape. His resistance to the options he has — such as a pending art school scholarship — and his obliviousness to the needs of his friends undercut the sense of tragedy "Bomb the System" aspires to.

dam Bhala Lough's hot little melodrama "Bomb the System" visually rhapsodizes the lives of contemporary graffiti artists in a rich, bleeding-at-midnight palette that blurs the line between film and the illegal public art practiced by its young, alienated characters. As they furtively slap their pseudonyms onto the walls and bridges of Lower Manhattan, the splendid cinematography by Ben Kutchins evokes a downscale New York answer to the icy Los Angeles noir of Michael Mann, but on a minuscule budget and with passion to spare. The movie sustains a vision of Lower Manhattan as a delirious phantasmagoria; its crowning glory, the Brooklyn Bridge, looms out of the shadows, the ultimate magnet for an egotist longing to stamp his identity on a monument. The movie runs on the synergy between this grimy but glamorous urban landscape and the emotional intensity of characters who at moments suggest contemporary descendants of the innocent, tormented teenagers in "Rebel Without a Cause." The James Dean character, 19-year-old Anthony (Mark Webber), is an ambitious young artist who dreams of "bombing" the city of New York - that is, covering its every available surface with his and friends' graffiti signatures. The movie conveys plenty of information and insider argot about the rituals of bombing, including the fact that a graffiti artist in search of subculture stardom never buys his spray paint; it must be stolen. The story baldly reworks the clich� of the troubled young idealist torn between a dangerous, semioutlaw existence and the pursuit of a secure career track (in this case, via art school in San Francisco). The struggle pits Anthony's mother, Diane (Donna Mitchell), with whom he lives, against his posse of sweet but lost spray-can-wielding pals. Anthony's older brother (and idol) already died during a "bombing" expedition, and his mother is desperate not to lose her other son. Somewhere in the middle stands Anthony's girlfriend, Alexandra (Jaclyn DeSantis), whose own posse of political artists go around putting up illegal posters that read "Warning: This is a Police State." Alexandra wants Anthony to join them when they go on the road. Anthony's graffiti name is BLEST. Those of his closest friends, Justin Broady (Gano Grills) and Justin's younger brother Kevin (Jade Yorker), are BUK 50 and LUNE. Together they play cops and robbers with the Vandal Squad of the New York Police Department. The cops mean business. Kevin, only 16, has already had a run-in with the police, who drove him to New Jersey, beat him up and abandoned him there. When a police car driven by two officers in the Vandal Squad is defaced while they duck into a store, it's only a matter of time before there's a violent showdown. "Bomb the System," which rides on a subtle hip-hop soundtrack, might be described as soulful pulp; cult recognition awaits it. "Bomb the System" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and sexual situations and some violence.

A richly textured drama with an angry poetic edge that gets inside the obsessive subculture of New York graffiti artists, "Bomb the System" signals the arrival of a talented filmmaker in NYU film graduate Adam Bhala Lough.
Displaying an incisive sense of place, an unaffected empathy for his impassioned characters, a kinetic visual style and a driving grasp of narrative and pacing, the 23-year-old writer-director provides a fascinating glimpse beneath the surface of the guerilla art world that avoids the prosaic bluster of so many indie street-life dramas. Careful positioning by the right distrib should help the film connect with hip young urban audiences.
The New York graffiti art movement peaked in the late 1970s, became semi-legitimized in the '80s with artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, and was pushed further underground in the '90s when the city's transit authority introduced a rigorous subway cleanup campaign and the NYPD Vandal Squad was established. While a number of indie films in the '70s and '80s touched on the phenomenon, Lough's is the first in more than 20 years to really explore that world; helmer uses it as a gritty background for a moving story of friendship, loss, anti-establishment struggle, artistic expression and self-exploration.
Despite having lost his older brother under tragic circumstances resulting from his nightly "bombing" forays with a graffiti crew, 19-year-old Anthony (Mark Webber) nurtures the same addiction. He hooks up with his buddy Justin (Gano Grills) and the latter's younger brother Kevin (Jade Yorker) to shoplift spray-paint cans and hit the streets each night, on constant alert for cops and hostile rival crews and compulsively looking for virgin walls in out-of-the-way spots where their work will endure.
Not long out of high school, Anthony has no ambition beyond graffiti and getting high, but is pushed by his mother (Donna Mitchell) toward a San Francisco art college where he's been accepted, and by his politicized girlfriend Alex (Jaclyn DeSantis) to leave New York and travel with her.
Signing himself "Blest," Anthony is one of the most wanted graffiti writers on the Vandal Squad's list, in particular that of hardass cop Bobby Cox (Al Sapienza), whose coke-and-booze diet makes him increasingly vindictive. A brush with the cop spurs Anthony and his crew to intensify their bombing excursions, earning them greater notoriety. When the inevitable confrontation happens, Cox's more level-headed partner (Bonz Malone) is unable to control the strung-out cop, resulting in tragedy that pushes Anthony to make a decision but then has darker repercussions.
Lough's screenplay at times spells out its agenda a little forcibly -- notably in an anti-corporate rant from Alex. But the story conveys a strong sense of graffiti as a self-fulfillment mission, from the 1980s when kids "took the paint or took the pipe" to become artists or gangsters, to the present, when it represents a sense of purpose and belonging in an otherwise aimless existence or even just the glue with which to cement fraternal bonds. It also touches on the evolution of graffiti into other forms, from Alex's more overt political poster art to the gallery-friendly work of a former street exponent.
The dirty cop character feels somewhat cliched and is overplayed by Sapienza as a snarling ball of hatred, but performances generally are restrained and affecting, especially the younger characters. Webber creates a sympathetic central character, deftly balancing intelligence, conviction and a certain lost quality.
Expanding on an experimental short film that served as his thesis project, Lough brings sensitivity but also an urgent, visceral feel to the gripping drama. Working with accomplished editor Jay Rabinowitz and lenser Ben Kutchins, the director roughs up the visual field with lots of jump cuts, dissolves and freeze frames, playing with film speed, focus, stock exposure and post-synched dialogue. Sharp use is made of heightened colors, often plucking out bold primary tones within the frame to match those of the graffiti art. Soundtrack also is densely complex, powered by a dynamic, extremely varied techno score from independent hip-hop producer El-P.

Dachau  diary: Schlöndorff's vision of a lost nine days
One of Germany's last remaining cine-excavators of Nazi-era irony, Volker Schlöndorff  speculates on what happened during the nine-day gap in Luxembourgian priest Jean Bernard 's famous Dachau diary, when he was given leave to return home and attend his mother's funeral. Thoroughly fictionalized, this anomalous incident is read as a diplomatic scheme, in which the haggard clergyman (Ulrich Matthes ) is encouraged by a baby-faced Nazi (August Diehl ) to dissuade the home-parish bishop from passively resisting the Third Reich . Schlöndorff and his scriptwriters (German TV pros Eberhard Görner  and Andreas Pflüger ) uncork all manner of fascist prevarication, as Diehl's self-interested career man attempts to cross-pollinate genocidal social philosophy with hearts-and-minds politicking, and essentially, outrageously, sell the idea of Dachau's necessity to the Dachau initiate. The church's collaborationism is a looming, sordid secondary target, naturally, and in fact, Schlöndorff's movie plays best as a dry exercise in historical doublespeak and rationalization. (Unfortunately, the scenes of arrest and incarceration are all smudged up with digital slo-mo "emphasis.") As the traumatized hero, Matthes (Goebbels in Downfall ) is nearly mute, a stunned and impenetrable cipher caught in the cogs of nationalist will.
