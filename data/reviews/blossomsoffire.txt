Blossoms of Fire
 is a bright, amiable chronicle of the vivid lives of the women of Juchit�n, a small, sun-soaked city on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Tehuantepec women are already famous -- from the paintings of Miguel Covarrubias and Frida Kahlo, from their embroidered handicrafts, and from their prominent role in the COCEI, the political party that challenged the long-standing single-party rule of the PRI and has maintained a foothold in the region since 1989. But directors Gosling and Osborne's jumping-off point here is an article about the community in the French edition of Elle,
 which charges that the women �prohibit the men from buying and selling� in the markets and carry on with young lovers while forcing their husbands to �babysit.� It's a gross misconception, made all the more insulting by the article's mondo
 tone, and the directors intend to set the record straight. They follow various townspeople through the farmland, markets, and fiestas
 of Juchit�n, documenting what is in reality a highly pragmatic and mutually satisfactory partnership between men and women in a pre-industrial mercantile economy. Since there is no concrete division between the hearth and the community, women participate as visibly in the marketplace and in civic affairs and as they would in the home, selling produce and dry goods and managing the family finances while the men harvest or fish. (One husband interviewed proudly remarks on his wife's fiduciary prowess, �The money will bear fruit.�) If all this sounds a bit dry and academic, perhaps it is. But let it be said that this sensible division of labor creates ample opportunity to party -- the whole community throws down with gusto for days-long wingdings that are perhaps the best evidence of the Tehuantepec people's colorful, passionate lives. A longtime film editor and collaborator with legendary documentarian Les Blank (Burden of Dreams),
 Gosling carefully weaves the interviews and footage into a thorough investigation of the Tehuantepec region's political history, its ongoing struggle with modernization, and its vanishing indigenous culture and language. There's enough detail to have earned the film an award from the American Anthropological Association. The only real disruption is Gosling's sporadic use of personal voiceover, which probably isn't necessary to tell the story of this subject. (See related interview with Maureen Gosling in this week's Screens section. Gosling will be in attendance to conduct Q&As following the evening screenings on Friday and Saturday.)



    Gender equity is a reality rather than an abstract goal, it appears, in the Oaxaca, Mexico city of Juchitan --- a circumstance novel enough to have spurred somewhat sensationalized accounts of a wild-women's "matriarchy" in publications from upscale Elle to supermarket tabloids. The humbler yet still unusual actuality gets an admiring perusal in "Blossoms of Fire." U.S. docu is engaging tube fare, with potential for limited theatrical exposure.
    Though hardly the party-hearty, macho-female enclave it's sometimes painted as, midsize Juchitan (pop. 100,000) has stayed true to its indigenous Zampatec roots in that customary gender-biased roles don't apply: Women run the produce markets and other small industries, generally handle family finances, and take full part in region's stubbornly anti-PRI political activism. Homosexuality and transgender persons enjoy rare, respectful tolerance. Looks at area's history, distinctive art and the cultural threat of globalization fill out episodic progress. Pic's only liability is its relentlessly upbeat tenor (heightened by rather gushy narration) --- one doubts that society's usual ills are as wholly absent from Juchitan as suggested here. Results at times seem as much p.c. travelogue as serious docu inquiry. Bright lensing takes its cue from populace's brilliantly colored, hand-crafted attire; other tech aspects are well-handled.
