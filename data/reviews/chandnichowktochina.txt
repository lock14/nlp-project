'Chandni Chowk to China" is Bollywood's all-singing, all-dancing, all-Hindi bid to conquer America. Backed by Warner Brothers, which is giving it the largest North American release of any Indian film to date, "Chandni Chowk" could, if successful, forecast a veritable monsoon of Bollywood imports. But only if American audiences can accept an action hero who talks to potatoes.
The tuber-loving Sidhu, played by the remarkable Akshay Kumar, works at a food stall in Chandni Chowk, an ancient bazaar in the walled city of Old Delhi. While chopping vegetables one day, he discovers a potato that resembles the face of Lord Ganesh, a Hindu deity. Sidhu carries the potato with him for the remainder of the film, which includes, among other things, a rags-to-riches plot, a mistaken-identity plot, a long-lost twin sisters plot, a long-lost father plot, an "adventures-in-China" plot, innumerable song-and-dance sequences, Jackie Chan-style slapstick comedy, kung fu fighting choreographed by Huen Chiu-Ku ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Kill Bill"), and a very grumpy Gordon Liu as the villain, Hojo. It's no surprise the film clocks in at over 2 1/2 hours (and even that attention-stretching length is considered short by Bollywood standards).
Although his shtick begins to wear thin in the film's third hour, Bollywood star Kumar delivers an energetic performance as a dim-witted cook mistaken for the reincarnation of a legendary warrior and recruited to defend a Chinese village from Hojo's depredations. Sporting a ponytail and a handlebar mustache and looking like a cross between Adam Sandler and Borat, Kumar dials his overacting up to 11 and keeps it there for the entire film. He laughs, he cries, he sings, he dances, he kickboxes, he talks to his potato - what more could you want from a Bollywood leading man?
The rest of the cast, including martial arts veteran Roger Yuan and Indian model Deepika Padukone, are left to watch from the sidelines as Kumar mugs his way through the film like a manic Jim Carrey. Although Americans may be overwhelmed by the dizzy mix of music, dancing, and kung fu, they should have no trouble appreciating the talent of this extraordinary entertainer.


Chandni Chowk to China  is the first Bollywood movie to be released in the U.S. in the wake   of the Bollywood-inflected Slumdog Millionaire . Let's hope it's not the last: This galumphing   elephant of a chopsocky revenge-of-the-nerd quasi-musical lacks the lyrical choreographic beauty that has marked such Stateside Bollywood releases as the gorgeous Lagaan  (2002). (It also lacks the demented slapstick ingenuity of Stephen Chow's 2005 Kung Fu Hustle .)
India's biggest action star, Akshay Kumar, plays a vegetable cutter from the Chandni Chowk district of Delhi who may in fact be the reincarnation of an ancient Chinese warrior. The movie is two hours and 34 minutes long,   and for two hours of it  before he embraces his Destiny  Kumar sputters, weeps, screams, mugs, worships a potato he thinks is a god, weeps some more, and generally carries   on in the hysterical fashion of a Hindi Roberto Benigni. Then everything goes all Karate Kid  though the fights are anything but kicky. There's one mildly insane disco-cheez dance number (don't get your hopes up  it's the only full-on musical sequence), plus a villain with a flying derby á la Oddjob and a heroine who looks like Beyoncé. It all makes you want to see a Bollywood movie, all right  a good one.

 Genre mixing is mother’s milk to Hindi films, so it’s no surprise that “Chandni Chowk to China” can so seamlessly add kung fu to the usual blend of comedy, dance and melodrama. After all, the choreographed fighting is dancing by another name, and plays off the same desire to see movie-star bodies in motion.  “Chandni Chowk,” the first Bollywood movie to be financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, starts too frantically but settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday-matinee picture. The affable Akshay Kumar, fresh from the runaway hit “Singh Is Kinng,” stars as Sidhu, a vegetable cutter in the Chandni Chowk marketplace in Delhi, who dreams of being something more. Sidhu, an all-Indian boy and a bumbler whose clumsiness gets him in and out of trouble, travels to China, where he’s mistakenly thought to be an incarnation of a great fighter come to save a village from the evil Hojo (Gordon Liu). Hojo’s best trick? Slicing off heads with the edge of his boomerang bowler hat. (That’s just one homage — to Oddjob in “Goldfinger” — in a film crammed with movie references.)  The plot has long-separated twins (one is named Meow Meow) and long-lost fathers, a potato with the face of the god Ganesh, an interpreter called Chopstick and, most intriguingly, Asia’s two superpowers meeting in the arena of pop culture. The explicit message for the Indian hero is know yourself and be self-reliant, and you will triumph. Sidhu’s best trick? A kung fu move derived from his years of cutting vegetables.  In a film impressed with Chinese gadgetry — including a pair of leg cuffs that help the dance-challenged — and with scenes set in the sleek urban landscape of Shanghai, it’s hard not to see a broader point: India, don’t be afraid of China’s accomplishments. Be yourself. You will succeed.  “Chandni Chowk to China” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence and martial arts.

With an encouraging yet desperate nod toward the two biggest movie-consuming populations on earth, Warners is releasing the Bollywood musical/martial-arts adventure "Chandni Chowk to China" -- a film much more of
 India than about it. As with many a Bollywood epic, you can bring the kids, your lunch, your cell phone, your unfiled taxes. There's so much here, and in such heaping, lengthy portions, you could probably weave a sari before the end credits. After letting "Slumdog Millionaire" slip through their fingers, WB execs may be hoping for crossover biz on this one. That seems unlikely, but fans will flock.
Shot in India, Thailand and China, the almost unpronounceable "Chandni Chowk to China" (which apparently marks the first time Beijing has allowed a fight scene to be shot on the Great Wall) features the quasi-hysterical Akshay Kumar as Sidhu, a simple cook from the Delhi neighborhood of Chandni Chowk. Some besieged Chinese peasants believe Sidhu to be the reincarnation of Liu Sheng, "China's greatest warrior."
The villagers want to bring Sidhu back home so he can defeat the dreaded Hojo (martial-arts star Gordon Liu), a landlocked pirate who is oppressing the countryside. But getting the unlikely hero out of the kitchen and away from his perpetually disappointed Dada (Mithun Chakraborty) requires subterfuge; Sidhu's misconceptions about where he's going and why -- and whom he's going to meet -- add to the considerable wealth of lowbrow comedy.
And lowbrow it is, but this is Bollywood, wherein everyone including Indians are mocked, derided, beaten, made to dance (usually in the rain) and where plotlines have more intersecting points than the U.S. highway system. No one is more ridiculous than Kumar, who plays Sidhu as a cross between Jerry Lewis and Ali G, all while trying to stay abreast of the narrative.
His counterpart/counterpoint is the beautiful Deepika Padukone, who does double duty as Sakhi, a spokesmodel for "Dance Magic G9" (a device whose comic potential will be used and abused on Sidhu) and as Hojo's lovely/lethal confederate, Meow Meow, who might have wandered off the set of "Kill Bill." The idea that Sakhi and Meow Meow were separated at birth is easy enough to swallow, but not the fact that the two Indian sisters were the children of Chinese parents -- including a derelict named Chiang (Roger Yuan) who used to be a crack police officer and martial-arts master until his family was destroyed by the evil Hojo.
If "Chandni Chowk to China" were a person, it would need Valium. As directed by Nikhil Advani ("Salaam-e-Ishq"), everything is fast and furious, hilarious, hysterical and frantic. Some of the sequences, and d.p. Himman Dhamija's imagery are quite beautiful and, in the case of the dance numbers featuring Padukone, stunning. But it's the fight scenes choreographed by Huan-Chiu Ku (martial-arts director on "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Kill Bill' and a stunt coordinator on Jet Li's "Black Mask") that truly take off; Kumar's homage to Jackie Chan's "Drunken Master" films is a real tickle.
And then there's the potato. In the early days of the film, Sidhu is looking for a way to make money that doesn't require hard work, and finds a potato bearing the likeness of the Hindu divinity Lord Ganesh. People flock to see it. Sidhu then carries it around throughout the entire movie. Why? One can only imagine that in trying to make a comic-tragic-dramatic dance film that would appeal to musical fans, martial-arts fans and fans of beautiful women throughout India, China, and America, the filmmakers didn't want to leave anyone out. Including farmers.

One of the most persistent legends about the Chinese martial arts is that their world-famous crowning glory, Shaolin kwan  (Shaolin temple boxing), was actually invented by a visitor from India. The story goes that in the mid-500s CE, during a sojourn at the Shaolin Monastery in the northeastern Chinese province of Henan , the itinerant Indian monk Bodhidharma devised a set of strengthening exercises to help the lethargic monks stay focused during long sessions of meditation. These exercises later evolved into the world's most admired regime of acrobatic fisticuffs.
The Bodhidharma myth lends pleasing symmetry to this 21st-century Bollywood expedition to China for a martial arts/song-and-dance crossover—a landmark collaboration between the mainland and the subcontinent, mediated by Warner Bros.  Alas, Chandni Chowk  to China , directed by Nikhil Advani , is asymmetrical in the extreme: shapeless, shameless, and slapdash. Sizable chunks of it were actually filmed in Thailand , and much of the rest could have been shot anywhere—on a back-lot Chinese village, or in front of a blue screen to be replaced by the skyline of Beijing .
CC2C  (as it's called in India) is based very loosely on the life of its leading man, the late-blooming superstar Akshay Kumar , a former chef and martial arts instructor who was actually raised in the eponymous Chandni Chowk district, a market area of Old Delhi  that has salt-of-the-earth, lower-middle-class implications. Kumar wasn't seen as being in the same league as other male stars of his generation until recently, when the 2000 Hera Pheri  (Monkey Business ) marked a shift in his persona from an action star with a likable goofy streak to a full-blown clown, bringing him a whole new level of celebrity.
Kumar's devotion to the Chinese martial arts is apparently sincere. Yet it is CC2C 's central failure that Advani and company barely interact at all with the culture they supposedly set out to celebrate. There's no possibility of China-India fusion because the twain barely meet. The desi  visitors always seem to be on top of a hill looking down at something—a village or a forest or a city—without ever entering into it. The same three or four locations (in particular, a single dusty section of the Great Wall—if that's really what it is) are re-explored so often that our sense of their exotic charm evaporates.
The drama that plays out in front of this matte painting backdrop is a mélange of old-school masala movie clichés decorated with some flashes of minty-fresh foolishness: Kumar's childlike Sidhu is a Chandni Chowk kitchen assistant who has some impressive God of Cookery –style slicing and dicing moves. So it isn't a total stretch when a couple of Chinese villagers show up in the neighborhood, insisting that the cook is the reincarnation of an ancient warrior who alone can defend their village against the glowering, bowler-hatted, and apparently motiveless tyrant Hojo (played with tree-trunk steadiness by Gordon Liu , a kung fu icon from The 36th Chamber of Shaolin  to Kill Bill ). Sidhu consults a rescued potato in the shape of the Hindu deity Ganesha, and naturally decides to make the trip.
From there, so much outrageousness ensues. There's nothing even vaguely normal around for the weirdness to stand out against. We get cartoonish flying and fighting effects out of Kung Fu Hustle . We get a set of twins separated at birth—one good, the other evil (both played by anime-eyed ingenue Deepika Padukone ). We get their rock-jawed father (Roger Yuan ), once a decorated PRC police officer and now an amnesiac mop-headed beggar living in a cave under the Wall. And we get a series of increasingly cacophonous and cluttered group-grope fight sequences, which have almost none of the grace and precision that bring the best such scenes close to uplifting song and dance—something a Bollywood filmmaker, of all people, should have been able to grasp.
