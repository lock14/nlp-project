         Four men head down a hill toward a glistening river in anticipation of glorious fishing in a remote secret spot. "No women allowed!" one of them yells in a burst of over-exuberant male bonding, and no one disagrees. What none of these men know, however, is that a woman is already there, and her presence will change their lives forever.
 
 "Jindabyne," a serious and somber film from Australia starring Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne, is as slow getting started as a leisurely weekend fishing trip, but it ends up having an almost unbearable impact. Nominated for nine Australian Film Institute awards, including best picture, "Jindabyne's" strength and power come from a number of factors: its origin, its current landscape and the unusual way its writer-director, Ray Lawrence, has chosen to work.
 


         






   The source material for "Jindabyne" is "So Much Water So Close to Home," the same Raymond Carver short story about a group of men and a body they find on a fishing trip that played a part in Robert Altman's 1993 portmanteau Carver film, "Short Cuts."
 
 Playwright and screenwriter Beatrix Christian has taken this brief story and gracefully expanded it to feature length by grasping its potential as a way to examine cultures as well as sexes in conflict, to deal with issues like the possibility of redemption and what it is we owe to the living as well as the dead.
 
 While Carver's story is set in the Pacific Northwest and the Altman work in Los Angeles, "Jindabyne" takes place in the town in Southeast Australia that gives the film its name. Cinematographer David Williamson has provided "Jindabyne" with an intense sense of place, showcasing the overwhelming vastness of a bleak landscape that seems to lead (aided by Paul Kelly's moody score) to a bleakness of the soul.
 
 Williamson's job is especially difficult because director Lawrence, whose previous films include "Bliss" and "Lantana" (which won seven AFI awards), works in a very specific and unusually effective way.
 
  Not only does Lawrence shoot in natural light (except for night sequences), he almost invariably goes with only one take every time. "I want the words to sound like they've just fallen out of their mouths" is the director's explanation, and as a result dialogue and situations have an urgency and emotional reality that can be lacking in more conventionally shot films.
 
 Not all actors are comfortable with this system, but Byrne as Irish-born family man Stewart and Linney (who had a similar experience on Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River") as his American wife, Claire, have made it their own. They give deeply felt, at times lacerating performances as one of several Jindabyne couples whose lives of quiet desperation are about to get a whole lot louder.
 
 After a disturbing prologue, "Jindabyne" takes its time introducing its people and its world in happier times. Stewart, who runs a gas station, and Claire, who works in a pharmacy, seem happy to be married and are clearly loving parents to their young son Tom (Sean Rees-Wemyss).
 
  Stewart's three friends, the people he goes fishing with, are, in Carver's words, "decent men, family men, responsible at their jobs." These include:
 
   Billy (Simon Stone), a sweetheart of a young guy who works as Stewart's right hand at the gas station;
 
   Rocco (Stelios Yiakmis), a large, powerful man who is going out with Carmel (Leah Purcell), the local teacher who is part of the Aboriginal community;
 
   Carl (John Howard), a rough-edged, hard-drinking individual who, along with wife Jude (a terrific Deborra-lee Furness), have custody of granddaughter Caylin-Calandria (Eva Lazzaro), a young girl still haunted by the death of her mother.
 
 When these four men arrive at their long-anticipated fishing spot, they are deeply shocked to find, dead in the water, the naked body of a young Aboriginal woman. They consider going back immediately and notifying the authorities, but for a variety of reasons, including the atavistic lure of the wilderness experience that the film beautifully illustrates, they decide against it and instead tie the floating corpse to a tree and go on with their fishing.
 
 Their rationalizations, however, cease to seem sound when they return to Jindabyne, notify the authorities, and are met by a wave of anger and told in no uncertain terms by the local police that "we don't step over bodies to enjoy our leisure activities."
 
 Revealing how this unintended furor plays out in the lives of its characters is the main business of "Jindabyne." As befits a town whose old section disappeared under water years before when a major dam was built, this is a community characterized by barely buried resentments and the hidden ways its citizens are haunted by their pasts.
 
  With the recovered body as the catalyst, what has been papered over explodes onto the surface with devastating results. Slowly, painfully, the different agendas of husbands and wives, men and women, white and Aboriginal communities vividly reveal themselves. It is here that "Jindabyne's" unhurried pacing and Lawrence's singular technique really pay off. We live on the fault line along with these characters, and it is an experience that is not easy to shake off.

Readers of Raymond Carver short stories and fans of Robert Altman's Short Cuts  will find the core of Jindabyne  familiar: Buddies on a fishing holiday find the dead body of a woman in the river and finish their trip before contacting the police, to the particular outrage of one fisherman's wife. In relocating Carver's spare morality tale ''So Much Water So Close to Home'' to director Ray Lawrence's (Lantana ) homeland of Australia, he and screenwriter Beatrix Christian have upped the moral stakes precariously by adding racism into the reckoning  the dead woman is aboriginal, the men white.
That's a lot to take on, mixed in with issues of abortion, mental illness, religious faith, and communal psychology. (There's also the creepy horror-flick presence of a Scary Psycho in a Truck Who Kills Women Driving Alone.) And Jindabyne   named for the lakeside town in which the troubles spill  can't contain all that the filmmakers want to throw in. Best to keep glued to the taut performance by Laura Linney as Claire, wife of one of the fishermen (Gabriel Byrne) and a woman moved to dramatic acts of atonement.

 In the 1960s the town of Jindabyne was intentionally flooded by the damming of a river and left at the bottom of a newly created lake in the middle of the Snowy Mountains in southeastern Australia. Present-day Jindabyne, a skiing and fly-fishing resort, is the setting of Ray Lawrence’s somber new film, in which the old settlement, now underwater, is occasionally mentioned. When it is, the implication of submerged life becomes a haunting, obvious metaphor, since “Jindabyne” concerns itself with emotions that lie under the surface of daily experience, and with a mysterious past murkily visible through the membrane of the present.  Claire (Laura Linney) is a transplanted American who lives in Jindabyne with her husband, Stewart (Gabriel Byrne), a former race car driver, and their young son, Tom. The marriage is shadowed by an earlier episode — Claire had some kind of breakdown and deserted the household shortly after Tom’s birth — and by the unwelcome presence of Stewart’s smiling, meddling mother (Betty Lucas).  What brings their latent bad feelings out into the open, along with a good deal of fresh grief, is a gruesome discovery Stewart makes while fishing in the mountains with friends. He finds the body of a murdered young woman — she’s a member of an Aboriginal community that lives nearby — and though he is horrified, he and the other men keep fishing, tethering the corpse to the shore with fishing line and allowing a day and a night to pass before they alert the police.  This incident and its aftermath — Stewart’s unthinking insensitivity, Claire’s horrified reaction to it and the local scandal that follows news of the fishermen’s behavior — are borrowed from a Raymond Carver story called “So Much Water So Close to Home.” A great deal has been added, by Mr. Lawrence and Beatrix Christian, the screenwriter: a half-dozen or so secondary characters, each carrying a carefully measured share of personal unhappiness.  But “Jindabyne” at the same time tries to remain faithful to the ethical and dramatic crux of Carver’s brief, unadorned vignette, which is related in Claire’s rueful, matter-of-fact first-person narration. “She was dead,” Claire says to her husband. “But don’t you see? She needed your help.”  Claire raises an unusual and difficult moral problem: What are the obligations of the living toward the dead?  “So Much Water So Close to Home” suggests that men and women approach this question differently, and that the chill that falls over Claire and Stewart’s relationship is partly an expression of the gender division embedded in every marriage. To this basic schism, “Jindabyne” adds more, including cultural and racial elements that are no less interesting for being altogether remote from Carver’s concerns.  In the film  Claire seems almost stereotypically American in the way she insists on working through the trauma of the dead girl’s discovery, pushing toward the therapeutic goals of healing and closure, while her white Australian friends urge her to move on and let go of her fury and shame. Their own unsentimental, shrugging ideas about death are at odds with Aboriginal customs as well, and the mutual suspicion and incomprehension between the two populations, as well as the clumsy efforts toward tolerance and respect, are addressed acutely and with sensitivity.  That description could cover the acting as well. There are few actors who convey the wounded intelligence of an ordinary person in distress as well as Ms. Linney. The characters she portrays are often, at first glance, satellites to a central male drama — the mother in “The Squid and the Whale,” the wife in “Kinsey,” the sister in “You Can Count on Me” — but in each of these cases it turns out that her psychological precision holds the key to the story. Here, Claire’s evident sanity and kindness draw the viewer to her side, and we are a bit startled to discover that she, like everybody else, has weak points and blind spots.  Everybody else includes not only the glowering, ferocious Mr. Byrne but also a handful of accomplished Australian actors, notably Deborra-lee Furness and John Howard as Jude and Carl, Stewart and Claire’s friends,   who care for their orphaned granddaughter and manage a motel and campground. The sense of place — of community as well as landscape — gives “Jindabyne” texture and detail, but the movie also has a heavy, overburdened feel.  The wilderness surrounding the town is beautifully shot (David Williamson is the director of photography) in a wide-screen format appropriate to its vastness and in dry, thin colors suggestive of summer in the mountains. Like many other movies made in Australia (and in keeping with some of the Aboriginal beliefs it explores), “Jindabyne” treats the natural world as an active spiritual presence. (Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” and Peter Weir’s “Picnic at Hanging Rock” are among the touchstones of this tradition.)  Sometimes, as in a climactic cross-cultural encounter at the edge of the forest, this augments the film’s power and mystery. But just as often the sights and sounds of nature add a brooding, willful sense of portent at odds with the stark contours of the narrative.  And too many of the incidents, conversations and subplots seem to have been stuffed into the delicate vessel of Carver’s story rather than allowed to grow organically out of it. We know from the opening scenes that a hermitlike local electrician killed the woman, and his intermittent presence provides more distraction than illumination: his inexplicable evil overshadows the human frailty that is the film’s more cogent subject. Similarly, the friendship between Tom and Caylin-Calandria, Jude and Carl’s granddaughter, has an overdone spookiness.  Mr. Lawrence’s last film, “Lantana,” was a superior specimen of the kind of multistranded narrative that has become (see “Crash” and “Babel”) the dominant genre of international prestige filmmaking. “Jindabyne” is simpler, but perhaps not simple enough. It’s not just that the clean, efficient lines of Carver’s story are blurred and tangled. The real flaw is that the movie’s best features — the aching clarity of its central performances — threaten to be lost in a wilderness of metaphor and mystification.  “Jindabyne” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has explicit and implicit violence, profanity and sexual references.
Hinging on a naturally dramatic situation involving four men on a fishing holiday who find a corpse in a river, "Jindabyne" never obtains the full impact of its potentially powerful inner core. The emotionally scabrous lead perfs by Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne, however, provide genuine substance for director Ray Lawrence's third film and should ensure modest aud attraction.
Lawrence's film ranks several notches below his more realized "Lantana," but shows the director working at a more active pace, with only five years separating these two pics following the 16-year wait after his 1985 debut, "Bliss."
As in "Lantana," the adult characters of "Jindabyne" must contend with sudden moral choices, while also keeping their family units together. But, underdeveloped characters, scenes and sequences plus vague and unsatisfying hints at mystical socio-political themes and a sluggish pace, keep pic from reaching its high ambitions.
Lawrence and screenwriter Beatrix Christian have adapted Raymond Carver's bracing short story, "So Much Water So Close to Home" in a distinctly Australian context, locating events in the mountainous southwest region surrounding the town of Jindabyne ("valley" in the Aboriginal tongue).
Thriller tone is quickly established, as Gregory (Chris Haywood), an old man resembling a New England whaler and with a thousand-yard stare, docks his truck in a hideout to scope out women driving alone. His prey is a 19-year-old Aboriginal woman named Susan (Tatea Reilly). Later, auds see Gregory dump her pallid corpse being dumped in a river feeding the local reservoir, which covers over the land that was the site of the former town of Jindabyne.
Even before characters are firmly established, Lawrence imposes a portentous mood over the environs. Against these darker atmospherics is the solidly working-class home of gas station owner Stewart (Byrne), wife Claire (Linney) and their young son Tom (Sean Rees-Wemyss). Tom, under the sway of his friend Caylin-Calandria (Eva Lazzaro), gets grounded when caught for having killed a rodent at school.
Leaving his wife to punish Tom, Stewart goes off on a weekend fishing trip with pals Carl (John Howard) and Rocco (Stelios Yiakmis), plus Billy (Simon Stone), a gangly naif who works at the gas station.
Redolent with "Deliverance's" brand of adventurous danger, the men's trek to their fishing hole is apparently spied upon by unseen eyes. At the 38-minute mark, Stewart discovers Susan's body, at which point Carver's story takes full effect.
The way Lawrence captures the dynamic of the group decision to not immediately report the body to authorities, and instead go on fishing, is possibly the film's most thoroughly convincing passage.
The wordless act of tying Susan's leg to a rock by fishing wire -- ironically out of supposed kindness so she's not dashed on the downstream rocks -- says everything about the morally tendentious position the men have placed themselves in.
What follows, however, is quite flat-footed, despite the refreshing and surprising dramatic choice to shift the story to Claire. It's her desire to understand what really went on at the river that generates the only interesting dramatic content in pic's second half.
A tell-tale sign that "Jindabyne" is clogged with too many unrealized concerns is the botched look at racial hatred in the burg.
Pic is finally burdened with far too much incidents and themes for it to do justice to any of them individually. The story surrounding Caylin's mom-by-adoption Jude (a strong, spiky Deborra-lee Furness), an emotionally fractured woman who alone, deserves its own movie.
Weighting pic down further is a constant pattern of fade-outs and fade-ins that slow matters to a crawl when a sharper pace is clearly called for. Linney and Byrne, though, do all they can to recharge the film at every juncture. Linney's portrait of the wife keeps pic focused on the central plot. Byrne's Stewart is an interesting case study of a man who is, as Claire succinctly terms it, "piss weak."
Even though this same Carver story was used as a fragment in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" (with Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis as the fishing buddies), the same moral themes in that far briefer version came across more effectively than in this diffused adaptation.
In true Australian cinema tradition, landscape is character in "Jindabyne," though the combined contributions of lenser David Williamson, composers Paul Kelly and Dan Lunscombe, sound man Andrew Plain and editor Karl Sodersten are somewhat short of great Oz mood-setters, including "Lantana" itself and current Cannes contender, Rolf de Heer's "Ten Canoes."

Mystery man of the long-ago Australian new wave, Ray Lawrence  has evidently grown less finicky. Lawrence, now 59, made his feature debut with the phantasmagoric Bliss , famous flop of the 1985 Cannes Film Festival ; he then licked his wounds and directed TV commercials for 16 years before reappearing with somewhat more staid fare, the multistranded urban narrative Lantana . Jindabyne , by contrast, follows the latter's relative success by a mere five years.
Lantana  took its title from an Australian plant. Jindabyne , the Aboriginal word for "valley," is named for a town in southeastern Australia that, flooded by a dam, lies at the bottom of a man-made lake. Like more than a few Australian movies, it's haunted by the primal crime committed against the Aborigines and is something of a ghost story. Like Lawrence's previous films, it's also very much a literary adaptation. As Lantana was blatantly Altmanesque in structure, Jindabyne  references the master indirectly. Lawrence's actor-driven thriller elaborates on "So Much Water So Close to Home," perhaps the best-known story by the late, laconic Raymond Carver , having provided the linchpin for Altman's 1993 Carver-fest Short Cuts .
The premise is casually outrageous. Four family guys on a ritual fishing trip discover the body of a young woman floating downstream. It's 11 miles back to the road, it's the weekend, and so they tether the woman's corpse to a tree and continue to fish, drink, and bullshit, with disastrous results for at least one man's marriage. Lawrence transposes the story from Carver's Pacific Northwest  to the mountains of New South Wales , and adds suspense and a racial component while elaborating on the characters.
Scarcely anonymous, the victim is a young Aborigine woman and her murderer could be a serial killer. The unhappy central couple, Claire (Laura Linney ) and Stewart (Gabriel Byrne ), are made considerably more complicated. Both are immigrants to Australia: She's American, he's Irish. She suffered a breakdown after the birth of their son and is afraid to have another child; he's an ex-race car driver, reduced to working in a garage and afraid of going gray. Where Altman suburbanized Carver's story, Lawrence and screenwriter Beatrix Christian  maintain its economically-depressed blue-collar milieu.
As its title suggests, Jindabyne  is a place where things are submerged. Opening with the circumstances of the young woman's murder, Lawrence presents a natural world of disturbed children and tormented adults, each involved in some sort of life-and-death struggle. Claire is pregnant and contemplating an abortion. Her little son and his more obviously screwed-up friend provoke an anticipatory scandal when they "sacrifice" their class pet. Even as the fishermen wade in water, the killer is upstream dumping his victim's body.
To compound these strange and sinister doings, Lawrence evokes the mysterious Aboriginal vibe. There are uncanny voices singing in the wires. The empty landscape cries out and so does Stewart when he spies a body floating by the sacred spot where he and his brethren have decreed, "no women allowed." Eden, however, cannot be protected. Once the guys return home and the story breaksthe newspaper headline "Men Fish Over Dead Body" accompanies a snapshot of the expedition's youngest member holding up his catch with a goofy grintheir evident indifference to the murdered woman becomes a political firestorm. Would they have been so disrespectful if the victim had been white? Angry young Aborigines trash Stewart's garage, painting him as an accessory in a racial hate crime.
Carver's story is told from Claire's point of view, but in Jindabyne , she's less passive, even something of a misguided activistthe repository of universal guilt. Claire is totally obsessed; identifying with the murder victim, she shrinks from her husband while clumsily reaching out to the bereaved family. Playing emotionally isolated characters, Linney and Byrne make for an impressively dour couple, in over their heads and hanging on to their separate lifeboats like grim death.
Hand it to Lawrence and Christian. Jindabyne is a soberly, if sluggishly, crafted movie in which the bitterness never stops. A lengthy Aboriginal healing ceremony notwithstanding, the overweening significance of Lawrence's studied compositions, slow dollies, and portentous dissolves leave little room for catharsis. Although its characters regularly fail to communicate, Jindabyne  is strangely filled with mystical congruencies including the off-speed punch line which, worthy of Carver, reduces divine justice to an inscrutable joke.
