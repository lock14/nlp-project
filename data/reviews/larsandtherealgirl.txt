         "Lars and the Real Girl" is the darndest thing. Starring Ryan Gosling as the romantically challenged Lars, this is a film whose daring and delicate blend of apparent irreconcilables will sweep you off your feet if you're not careful.
 
 For what screenwriter Nancy Oliver, director Craig Gillespie and a top cast have done is construct a Frank Capra-style fable, a throwback tribute to the joys of friendship and community, around a sex toy. Taking one of the most salacious items modern culture can provide as their centerpiece, they've created the sweetest, most innocent, most completely enjoyable film around.
 


         






   What makes this implausible feat of sustained imagination possible is how exactly calibrated "Lars' " emotional effects are. The creators of this film were fiercely determined not to go so much as a millimeter over the line into sentiment, tawdriness or mockery. It's the rare film that is the best possible version of itself, but "Lars" fits that bill.
 
 Credit goes first to Oliver, a "Six Feet Under" writer doing her initial feature script, who, having noticed that a lot of contemporary movies were "dark, edgy, sarcastic and sometimes mean-spirited," determined to do something different without sacrificing intelligence, wit or unexpectedness.
 
 Filmmaker Gillespie, a top commercial creator who is the director of record on the completely dissimilar "Mr. Woodcock," understood this script in a way no one but the original writer usually does. His decision to shoot in the Canadian winter, substituting for the frigid upper Midwest of the script, helps give the film its deadpan, almost Scandinavian humor.
 
 Gillespie has also ensured that the "Lars" performers are all on the same wavelength. First among equals is Gosling, who plays the sweet, guileless and very much removed Lars with unwavering, unblinking sincerity.
 
 The always involving Emily Mortimer conveys generosity and intelligent sprightliness as Lars' sister-in-law Karin, Paul Schneider is very much the guy's guy as Lars' brother Gus, and Kelli Garner wins us over as Margo, Lars' awkward but sincere coworker who is more willing than most to get to know the young man.
 
 That takes some doing, because what Lars does best is what he's doing as the film begins, which is hiding from the other people in his small town. In this case, he's hiding from the pregnant Karin, who lives with Gus in the family house while Lars by choice makes do with an apartment in the garage.
 
 Karin simply wants him to come over for the occasional meal, but though Lars has the habits and disposition of a grown-up choir boy he is pathologically shy, terrified enough at even the thought of human contact to literally run when he sees it coming.
 
 That doesn't stop Margo at work from trying to chat him up and other folks from trying to set him up. That pressure, combined with nervousness about Karin's pregnancy and a coworker who watches too much pornography, leads to the arrival at Lars' home of an enormous crate.
 
 That evening, Lars knocks at Karin and Gus' door. "I have a visitor," he says, proud as can be. But when he produces his friend, she turns out to be not what anyone expected. "This is Bianca," he says, introducing a fully dressed, anatomically correct, life-size silicone doll. "She's not from here."
 
 As Karin and Gus look on astonished, Lars explains that Bianca is a Brazilian/Danish missionary he met online who has to get around in a wheelchair and, because she is as religious as Lars, will have to sleep in the big house.
 
 For Lars, who treats Bianca like an actual person and holds conversations only he can hear, is not thinking of sex. Bianca, it turns out, is the only kind of companion he can tolerate. As Dr. Dagmar, a convenient physician/psychologist (a terrific Patricia Clarkson) says, "Bianca's in town for a reason," and everyone who cares about Lars is going to have to deal with that.
 
 It is the charming conceit of "Lars and the Real Girl" that the group includes not just Karin, Gus and Dr. Dagmar but almost everyone in this mythical hamlet, some of whom turn out to have inanimate objects of their own that they treasure. Because people genuinely like Lars, because they want the best for him, they take Bianca as seriously as he does, which leads to any number of strangely comic and surprisingly poignant situations.
 
 And the truth is, Bianca is good for both Lars and the town. She contributes to changes in his personality, giving him the courage to be the best person he can be. And she makes the townspeople around her reconsider their own lives and begin to value what matters over what does not.
 
 Though it was produced by Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, "Lars and the Real Girl" is being distributed by MGM, complete with the studio's venerable roaring lion logo. It makes one wonder what Louis B. Mayer of MGM's wholesome golden era would think of his company being associated with a film bizarre enough to employ a "Bianca wrangler." If the idea itself didn't give him a heart attack, he would probably like it just fine. It's that kind of a film.
 

 
 "Lars and the Real Girl." MPAA rating: PG-13 for some sex-related content. Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes. In limited release.   

Do not be alarmed if you throw up your hands at some point during Lars and the Real Girl  and blurt out, ''These people are bonkers, and enablers, too!'' The reaction is normal and doesn't signify hardheartedness, even if this wee indie drama is being sold as a charming, oddball story of communal compassion. We're asked to believe that Lars (Ryan Gosling) is a hardworking, church-going young man who's so terrified of emotional or physical closeness that he introduces a sex doll as his mail-order girlfriend named Bianca. We're also to believe that Bianca  clearly manufactured for less talkative pursuits  offers Lars companionable relief from crippling mental problems. And that his brother (Paul Schneider), his pregnant sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer), his fellow congregants, and, heck, the wise local doctor (Patricia Clarkson) collude in his delusion because, really, he's such a good soul. Plus, it takes a village to populate a character-driven indie drama.
Really, I think we put up with Lars at all only because Gosling has such an affinity for the wounded boy birds he tends to play that it's easy to watch him do his thing. He treats his silicone costar with great gentleness. But even his mad skills at embodying misfit masculinity can't sustain the plastic premise. Will no one talk to Lars honestly about the pitfalls of dating a golem?

 Writing about American theater in 1957, the  British critic Kenneth Tynan sounded a familiar note. Modern American drama, he had discovered, is a family affair. Always there is the “confused adolescent boy, just awakening to the eternal mysteries of stud poker.” There’s “a strange,  stammering poetry” to this boy,  who is  right on track for “an emotional upheaval.”  There is also “comic relief” in the form of friends and neighbors, though in time we learn that “their lives too are founded on pain and insecurity and lack of togetherness.”  Tynan could have been describing modern American independent cinema in the main; throw in more comic relief and you have “Lars and the Real Girl” in the specific. An indie wolf in old-studio sheep’s clothing, the film is about a sensitive young loner (“sensitive as a snail’s horn,” to steal another stinger from Tynan) who heaves hurt by the bucket, but finally burrows into the warm, welcoming embrace of his community. It’s part comedy, part tragedy and 100 percent pure calculation,  designed to wring fat tears and coax big laughs and leave us drying our damp, smiling faces as we savor the touching vision of American magnanimity. It holds a flattering mirror up to us that erases every distortion.  Hollywood used to turn out these visions on a weekly basis; it still does on occasion, often by way of sports flicks, though no one sold this type of canned hokum like the old-school professionals. “Lars and the Real Girl” is an independently financed enterprise, which mainly means that it stars Ryan Gosling as Lars, has been padded out with actors whose faces will be more familiar than their names, and was produced with an eye for thrift with modest sets and Ontario locations. It was written by Nancy Oliver, who  regularly contributed to the HBO series “Six Feet Under,” and directed by the relative newcomer Craig Gillespie, whose only other official credit is the recently released big-studio comedy with Billy Bob Thornton called “Mr. Woodcock.”  Before  “Six Feet Under”  succumbed to the familiar serious-television malady and became as mired in suds as any daytime soap, with the usual complement of pathologies and predicaments,   it created a recognizable, lived-in world that balanced individual concerns against larger social issues. The specific flowed into the general and back out again. In “Lars and the Real Girl,” the general has been banished, as it too often is in American independent cinema. The film is set in an anonymous Midwestern town with pretty  clapboard houses, a busy church, bustling stores and even a hopping bowling alley that’s so removed from the larger world, from Iraq, Hillary, Rush and Britney, it might as well be  in deep space. It’s America, shrink-wrapped.  No one seems to pay heed to the nightly news here, but at least one of Lars’s co-workers surfs through the Internet’s racier offerings. This is how Lars comes to buy Bianca, a life-size doll with a ready mouth and monumental bust. The doll has something hiding under her skirt, but we never see Lars playing peekaboo because this is a story about innocence, not sad sacks having their weird way with artificial vaginas. More pointedly, the film means to be about  the generous spirit of everyday folks who, when their 27-year-old neighborhood loner with a funny grin begins lugging around a plastic sex doll, open their hearts and minds to them both — never mind the previous years of neglect that probably helped make Lars a little loony.  American self-nostalgia is a dependable racket, and if the filmmakers had pushed  into the realm of nervous truth, had   given Lars and the town folk sustained shadows, not just cute tics and teary moments, it might have worked. Instead the film is palatable audience bait of average accomplishment that superficially recalls the plain style of Alexander Payne, but without any of the lacerating edges or moral ambiguity. Lars’s anguish has nothing to do with the loneliness of small towns or alienation in the modern world or even real pain; unlike the characters in Mr. Payne’s films, he suffers without disquieting fuss or messy fluids. His infatuation with Bianca inspires clucks of sympathy and a little confusion, but the priest smiles indulgently, as do the old ladies.  It is a well-played con, particularly by Paul Schneider and Emily Mortimer as Lars’s brother and sister-in-law. Mr. Gosling fares less happily. With the exception of a delicate moment when Lars sways in a darkened room, his eyes squeezed shut in private reverie, the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career. Lars is a difficult, maybe impossible character, a holy fool and a martyr in waiting, a subject of mockery and a  means of redemption. With his awkward manner and solitary habits, he comes across as more stunted than damaged, soft rather than hurt. Mr. Gosling smiles his goofy smile and begs for attention, but he never fills this conceit with life. Lars too is a doll, as pliable as Bianca and just as phony.  “Lars and the Real Girl” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). No man-and-doll sex, just courtship.

When a socially awkward small-town bachelor introduces an anatomically correct silicone doll as his girlfriend, the local community ultimately responds with surprising compassion in "Lars and the Real Girl." Helmer Craig Gillespie's sweetly off-kilter film plays like a Coen brothers riff on Garrison Keillor's "Lake Woebegone" tales, defying its lurid premise with a gentle comic drama grounded in reality. Although well-acted by a name cast, the offbeat subject matter and idiosyncratic tone make it arthouse material. Skedded for a limited release Stateside, it should have a longer life in ancillary, and could serve as a niche item for offshore distribs.
The underlying theme of "Six Feet Under" scribe Nancy Oliver's script -- how a damaged person comes to terms with past traumas and grows into adult responsibilities -- may feel familiar, but what's fresh and charming is the way the characters surrounding the protagonist also grow as they help him through his crisis.
Set in an unspecified, snowbound place in the northern Midwest that feels a lot like Minnesota (although pic was shot in Ontario), the plot centers on 27-year-old oddball Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling). Raised by a taciturn father after his mother died in childbirth, Lars has some major emotional baggage: He prefers to avoid human contact and can't stand being touched.
Living in the garage apartment behind his childhood home, now occupied by his older brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer), Lars tries to avoid the married couple's constant invitations. His social life consists primarily of attending church and listening to the porn and action-figure fantasies of a co-worker. At the office, he scrupulously avoids the overtures of flirtatious colleague Margo (Kelli Garner).
Karin's pregnancy seems to awaken a deep-seated fear of abandonment in Lars, expressed by the unexpected materialization of a girlfriend, Bianca, whom he wants his brother and sister-in-law to host. She's a wheelchair-bound Brazilian-Danish missionary on sabbatical to experience the world. And she's also a custom-made, life-size plastic doll ordered from the Internet.
Horrified by their new houseguest and Lars' apparent insanity, Gus and Karin take the couple to family doctor-psychologist Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson). Believing Lars' delusion indicates he's working something out, Dagmar advises his worried family to go with the flow.
Tenderly depicting his characters' human foibles with low-key visual humor, Gillespie never condescends or goes for an easy joke. Oliver's pithy dialogue also avoids obvious yucks.
All the perfs are fine, with nerdily outfitted Gosling sympathetic in a role very different from what he's essayed of late, and Schneider, Mortimer and Clarkson impressively three-dimensional. Among the supporting cast, Nancy Beatty makes an impression as a plainspoken neighbor, as does Karen Robinson as office receptionist Cindy.
Tech package is strong, with spot-on costumes. The eventual absence of Lars' blanket-cum-scarf beautifully signals character development.

How painful to watch Ryan Gosling , one of the most elastic actors of his generation, smirk and gawp and grimace his way through Craig Gillespie 's smarmy little number about a pudgy Midwestern office drudge so terrified of human contact that the only, um, person he can bond with is a mail-order Brazilian sex doll. Lurking within the high concept is a Triggering Trauma so wasting (and banal) that it takes not only loving relatives (Paul Schneider  and Emily Mortimer ) but a whole village of empathic Scandinavian stoics to sort him out, steered by a therapist played by Patricia Clarkson , giving her dry best shot to hoary old bromides like "It's not a mental illness, it's a form of communication." In fact, as Six Feet Under   writer Nancy Oliver  ought to know, barking mad might have made a movie. Instead, Lars and the Real Girl  wobbles in a slow, toneless no-man's-land between mawkish and schmaltzy while trafficking shamelessly in heartland stereotypy.
