         Thirty years prior to the U.S. Olympic hockey team's 1980 gold medal triumph in Lake Placid, N.Y. (dramatized last year in the film "Miracle"), an equally unlikely upset occurred when a hastily assembled American squad beat international soccer powerhouse England, 1-0, in the first round of the World Cup.
 
  "The Game of Their Lives" — written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, the team that brought you the crowd-pleasing "Hoosiers" and "Rudy" — follows that 1950 World Cup team from tryouts held only weeks before they departed through to the climactic tournament in Brazil.
 


         






    Opposites clash as a group of scrappy players from an Italian section of St. Louis known as the Hill attempts to mesh its loosely improvisational style with the more disciplined approach employed by the East Coast players who make up the rest of the team in this oddly flat film.
 
  Despite strong performances by Gerard Butler and Wes Bentley as the leaders of the two factions and crisply directed soccer action, the movie lacks a powerful central presence to carry the drama. Like a corner kick that doesn't quite bend, "Game" is a faithful, straightforward docudrama that fails to become something more rewarding.
 
 "The Game of Their Lives," PG for some mild language and thematic elements. Running time: 1 hour, 41 minutes. In general release.
 
 

 
 Putting 'Madison'
 
  back on the map
 
 
Jim Caviezel, who last year played one character capable of walking on water ("The Passion of the Christ") and another who could drive a golf ball over it ("Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"), stars as the pilot of a hydroplane racer that skims the water in the painfully sincere drama "Madison."
 
  The film is based on the true story of Madison, Ind., an Ohio River town that in 1971 was on the verge of becoming a Rust Belt casualty of modernization after trucking superceded shipping as the region's preferred mode of commercial transit. Caviezel plays the volunteer crew chief of the municipally owned boat, the Miss Madison, who rallies his fellow citizens as they attempt to raise $50,000 to stage hydroplaning's prestigious Gold Cup in the hope of turning around the town's fate.
 
  Directed by William Bindley from a script he wrote with his brother Scott, "Madison" was made before "Passion" or "Bobby Jones" and benefits from Caviezel's ability to project earnestness better than nearly any actor currently working, but its near-comic predictability, "What else could go wrong?" plotting and cliché-ridden screenplay sink it.
 
 "Madison," PG for some mild language and sports peril. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes. At selected theaters.
 
 
   

Madison , named after the down-at-heel Indiana town on the Ohio River where a famous sports upset took place over three decades ago, happens to be about hydroplane racing, a competition of particular interest to spectators who live near water and enjoy consulting stopwatches. But the movie might just as well be about hockey, or darts: In dramatizing how pilot Jim McCormick and the community-owned race boat called the Miss Madison came to beat much fancier, better-funded competitors and take the 1971 Gold Cup while the eyes of ABC's Wide World of Sports watched, director and co-writer William Bindley  engages every move in the underdog playbook, including, but not limited to, the time the good citizens of Bedford Falls chipped in to make up George Bailey's shortfall in It's a Wonderful Life .
For emphasis, Jim Caviezel plays McCormick, presaging the beatitude he would later bring to The Passion of the Christ  (Madison  has been on the shelf since 2001) by imbuing the fellow with the radiance of a penitent, or at least of a Bruce Springsteen American, true to his hometown. The story is narrated in flashback by McCormick's kid (Jake Lloyd), who may or may not have time-traveled from the 1930s. An old white geezer and the town's resident old black geezer sit on a bench and kibbitz like Muppets Statler and Waldorf. The music swells on cue with patriotic harmonies. And the head nods, narcotized by uplift.

t's not every day that a mechanic gets to be a movie hero. The last one may have been Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), who pulled a Boeing 707 out of the snow in "Airport" (1970). But Bruce Dern, as Harry Volpi, is a dashing figure, arriving to save the day in this sentimental film about hydroplane racing. "Madison," in the tradition of "Chicago," "Fargo" and "New York, New York," is a movie named for a city - in this case, Madison, Ind., population 13,000 or so, on the banks of the Ohio River. In 1971, Madison's economy, based on waterway shipping, is shot. All it has left is its tradition of hydroplane racing, and when it has the chance to play host to the Gold Cup race, there are four big questions: Can the town come up with the $50,000 prize money? Does Miss Madison, the community-owned boat whose crew is managed by Jim McCormick (Jim Caviezel), a heating and air-conditioning repairman, have any chance to win? What will Jim have to do? And how will it all affect his son, Mike (Jake Lloyd, a k a Anakin Skywalker of "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace")? "Madison" wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. A baby girl's first word is "Agnew." An elderly white man and an elderly black man argue about which racing day over the decades was best (1962? No, it rained). William Bindley, the director, who wrote the screenplay with his brother Scott Bindley, takes the position that big-city people disdain small towns just for being small. The racing teams from Budweiser and Atlas Van Lines and the television news people are portrayed as openly condescending. The peculiar thing, from an urban perspective, is that while the film, based on a true story, celebrates the peace, quiet and charm of small-town life, it also revels in the thrills of a super-noisy high-speed sport. Only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems or Madison itself are likely to appreciate it. "Madison" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and a couple of fatal explosions.

Basically "The Little Boat That Could," "Madison" charts a predictable course through cliche-infested waters. Not even the warm presence of a pre-"The Passion of the Christ" James Caviezel can invigorate this inspirational but uninspired sports movie, which premiered at Sundance in 2001, then sat on the shelf for four years before becoming MGM's unlikely penultimate release. Studio's less-than-conspicuous marketing push and unenthusiastic word of mouth will quickly capsize the project, though it could prove marginally more navigable on video.
Based on the true story of Jim McCormick, who overcame merciless odds -- and the smug derision of the entire hydroplane racing community -- to win the 1971 Gold Cup, "Madison" draws its title from McCormick's small Indiana hometown as well as the rickety yellow boat that was once its pride and joy.
Once a thriving town on the Ohio River, Madison suffers from rampant unemployment and a general Hicksville reputation. As for the community-owned race boat, the Miss Madison, she's deteriorated into a slow, spluttering wreck, prone to random breakdowns and odd fumes.
Thus it's up to McCormick (Caviezel), the pilot of the race boat and one of the town's last true believers, to rally his neighbors, keep Madison on the highly competitive racing circuit and restore his son Mike's faith in the power of miracles. (Mike is played by a very young Jake Lloyd, with John Mellencamp handling the voiceover.) But McCormick, now an air-conditioner repairman, hasn't raced since his near-fatal accident years ago, and wife Bonnie (Mary McCormack) isn't about to let him risk his life again.
A surprising turn of events leaves Madison hosting the Gold Cup tournament. Meanwhile, the job cuts continue, the boat blows a fuse and McCormick is subject to constant ridicule by the children (yes, even the tots are evil) of the opposing Budweiser team.
To the credit of writer-director William Bindley and co-scribe Scott Bindley, the pace rarely stalls or lingers, motoring along much more efficiently than the floundering craft at the film's center. Yet that only draws attention to the mechanical quality of the narrative, which favors expedience over plausibility at every turn. Every obstacle, from the town's financial rut to the McCormicks' domestic woes, has a quick, ready-made solution. Simply to maneuver McCormick into the boat racer's seat, the plot takes a turn so callous and unnecessarily tragic that it almost stops the film in its watery tracks.
Here it becomes clear that Bonnie may very well have a point in protesting her husband's racing. It also becomes evident that without the benefit of Caviezel's sympathetic drawl and perpetually moist puppy-dog eyes, McCormick might come off as a lot more feckless and irresponsible than he does.
Pic could use more of the occasional throwaway banter between husband and wife. And as a story about teamwork, it needs a richer, more lived-in sense of community ties: Despite colorful local-yokel perfs by Brent Briscoe, Paul Dooley and Bruce Dern as a sort of mechanic/boat guru, neither Madison the town nor "Madison" the movie ever feels fully inhabited.
Though agreeably lensed, the racing sequences lack flair or visceral impact. And, even when the boats quit, Kevin Kiner's aggressively uplifting score never does.

At long last love: Kutcher and Peet take forever to connect
A Lot Like Love  exemplifies the happiness-deferred romance, in which two friends-but-should-be-paramours repeatedly convene, separate, and reconvene over several years, finally staying together only after feature run-time has elapsed. Skimming through lonely stretches and careerist angst, the movie focuses on incidents that threaten the final hookup. But the chemistry between diaper salesman Ashton Kutcher  and photo hound Amanda Peet  is so off that the pairing scans as an alienation effectone enhanced by their age difference, as well as Peet's resemblance (in her goth, graduate-age New York scenes) to an unwaxed Demi Moore . The banter soon develops a rhythm: Hurting from a breakup, Peet gets too drunk to nuzzle and Kutcher doesn't complain; years later, on a car trip, Kutcher whines about his ex and Peet shrugs it off. Interjections from perennial second bananas Kathryn Hahn  (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ) and Kal Penn  (winning even when not conjuring vivified bags of pot) generate the only sparks.
