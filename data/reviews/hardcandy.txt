         Slick and stylish in its writing, direction and design, the psychological thriller "Hard Candy" stays fresh for as long as it does on the strength of powerful performances by Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Maddeningly exploitative, the film takes a provocative subject — pedophilia — and wraps it in a sterile, vacuum-sealed package, devoid of meaning.
 
  Page plays Hayley, a precocious 14-year-old with a Jean Seberg fixation, who hooks up via the Internet with Jeff (Wilson), a successful 32-year-old photographer whose taste in women (make that girls) veers toward the distressingly young. The first 20 minutes of the film (which would have made a great short) detail their innuendo-tinged pas de deux as they agree to meet at a coffeehouse before naughtily retreating to Jeff's minimalist Hollywood Hills home for an impromptu photo shoot.
 


         






    Hayley ratchets up the tension with increasingly daring intimations, then quickly turns the tables on Jeff. As predator becomes prey, the film goes terribly wrong, devolving into a disappointingly simple-minded revenge fantasy bent on dispensing the kind of medieval justice once meted out by Steve Martin as Theodoric of York on "Saturday Night Live."
 
  The sophisticated, complex characters initially set up by screenwriter Brian Nelson and director David Slade grow tiresome as they are put through a series of reversals designed to test the audience's sympathies. The essentially two-handed drama feels increasingly like a one-act play stretched beyond its limits. The boyish Page is amazingly assured, but the implausible turns of the script weigh heavily as Hayley morphs into a pixie-faced, scalpel-wielding vigilante, and the punishment she has planned for Jeff drags the film into a neighborhood adjacent to, albeit less explicit, than that inhabited by films such as "Hostel" and "Saw" (also Lionsgate releases).
 
  Though Jeff is clearly a creep from the get-go — he is
 meeting underage girls on the Web — Wilson adeptly shades him so that it's open to question how sleazy he actually is. The filmmakers, however, sabotage their own (rather weak) climax by stacking the deck in the film's second half, seemingly to rationalize "Hard Candy's" own sleaziness.
 
  As a pure thriller, the film also goes soft in the last half hour. All the film's shiny surfaces and lacerating dialogue cannot make up for the fact that the machinations geared toward keeping the characters in or near the gnawingly claustrophobic house also serve to drain it of any real tension.

Every day, it seems, brings another report of an adult who uses the Internet to seduce the underage, only to wind up ensnared by the cops. That might be a happy fate, though, compared to the one that awaits Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a Los Angeles fashion photographer who, in Hard Candy , makes a racy on-line connection with 14-year-old Hayley (Ellen Page). The two hook up at a coffee bar, where Jeff, a smug sophisticate, works hard to create the impression that he respects this teenager for her mind. They go to his place, they drink screwdrivers at noon, he takes out his camera, and...bam, he falls to the floor, drugged.
When he wakes up, he's tied to a chair, and Hayley, far from a lascivious lamb, is revealed to be a fiery feminist avenger, acidly witty beyond her years. She has agreed to meet this swank modern-day Humbert for the purpose of torturing him for his sins. Be warned: As directed by David Slade, from a script by Brian Nelson that suggests David Mamet in a mood of porno sadism, Hard Candy  is extreme  a battle of the sexes that glides from tricky to angry to shockingly ugly. As Jeff is forced to confront the ultimate male nightmare, the movie flirts with exploitation, only to be saved, somewhat, by the cleverness of its observations about male hypocrisy and female wrath. Mostly, it's worth seeing for Ellen Page. Looking like a baby Sigourney Weaver, she takes off from the script's dexterous sarcasms to play Hayley with an enlightened lack of mercy, an ability to stare down her enemy by thinking just like him. To watch Hard Candy is, at moments, to be very afraid, but the scariest thing about it is the fury of Page's talent.

 More sour than hard, this highfalutin exploitation flick starts with an unsavory premise — possible pedophile meets the jailbait of his dreams — that quickly becomes downright unpalatable. Working from an expository, intellectually clotted script by the playwright Brian Nelson, lingering in the shadows of Ariel Dorfman and Neil LaBute, among others, the director David Slade opens his first feature with his camera trained on a computer monitor. There, a teasing pas de deux  is unfolding between two Internet chatters, Thonggrrrrrl14   and Lensman319. She's young (hence the 14), precocious (she namedrops Zadie Smith) and seemingly as eager as he is. They arrange to meet, silent alarms screaming.  From the chocolate smeared on her mouth and the rich color of her crimson sweatshirt, it initially looks as if Thonggrrrrrl14 is about to meet the big bad wolf in the person of her chat-room pickup, Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a photographer nearly two decades her senior. But this little red-hooded miss, a saucer-eyed pixie called Hayley Stark (Ellen Page), soon proves very wily, and more schooled by Lara Croft than Mother Goose. After hooking up at a cafe with the regrettable name of Nighthawks, Hayley insists on returning with Jeff to his home, whereupon she chugs vodka and go-go dances on the sofa before baring the kind of sharp teeth common only to wolves and psycho chicks born out of the murkiest recesses of the (usually male) imagination.  During the ensuing narrative unpleasantness and visual incoherence (meaningless choker close-ups, pointless slow motion), Hayley subjects Jeff to a range of torture, all in the name of, well, what? Despite the two fine performances, it's hard to say. Although she claims to want to right the wrongs of this alleged fiend, what Hayley says and does to her Internet Humbert Humbert firmly makes the case that this avenging angel is really the demon daughter of Valerie Solanas and Lorena Bobbitt, and consequently as reprehensible as her prey. Viewers who find torture entertaining, even in the age of Abu Ghraib, may find this watchable. Not so those of us who, like an acquaintance, get pretty bored with people in trapped-in-apartment movies having philosophical debates while fearing for their  privates.  "Hard Candy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex and violence involving a teenager.
The Darwinian theory that schlocksploitation must tighten its twist of the nuts with each new release will be tested strenuously for yearsor at least several weeksby Hard Candy . A pointedly s(l)ick cross between Oleanna  and I Spit on Your Grave , thrown like raw meat to Lionsgate for $4 million at Sundance, Hard Candy  has a 32-year-old fashion photographer with an eye for jailbait getting bound and gagged by his latest subjecta screwdriver-swilling, scalpel-wielding gender-avenger who's all of 14 years old. Not to sound like Michael Medved  here, but really: Isn't there a statute of limitations for the rape-revenge genre? "We can sell it as a female empowerment movie," Lionsgate's Tom Ortenberg  told The  Boston Globe  at Sundanceeven as his reading of the film's moral dilemma suggested another marketing tack: "What if this was your daughter?"
Hard Candy , however it's wrapped, is a tough one to swallow. Still, the acute precociousness of our score-settling Lolita strains credibility only if you fail to accept the film's effortless assertion that American pope.g., the Internet and, yes, extreme cinema-on-demandhas lowered the minimum-age requirements for just about everything, including principled payback. Hayley Stark  (Ellen Page ), the freckle-faced femme fatale who toys with her pedophilic prey in an online chat room before meeting him in the "RW" (that's the real world), is reading the autobiography of Jean Seberg  as well as Romeo and Juliet ; her retorts, typed or uttered, are as sharp as the surgical tool she threatens to use on the photographer for "preventative maintenance." (Is that anything like preemptive war?) When Jeff (Patrick Wilson ), the perv-turned-victim, pleads from behind tight ropes that his professional rep will be ruined if Hayley calls the cops, the young cultural critic begs to differ: "Didn't Roman Polanski  just win an Oscar?"
Not for nothing does the movie put its cradle-robbing creep in the image- making biz. Hard Candy , seductively shot in hi-def DV by music video director David Slade , contrives to wag its own finger at itselfto have its bonbon and eat it too. Right from the film's opening peep at instant sex- messaging, Slade goads us to admit taking guilty pleasure even from within a scenario as criminal as this one. Maybe Slade's first RW close-upof a fork slowly sliding its way through moist cakeis already stepping over the line. (Or maybe that comes in the next two shots, whose insinuation of sexual appetite I can't even attempt to describe for fear of crossing the line myself.) In any case, one thing leads to another between these inveterate flirts (rapid-fire innuendo is easy with online practice), and the two proceed blushingly to the shooter's Hollywood Hills  bungalow, a set whose Almodóvarian mise-en-scéne essentially allows Slade to blame the pedophile's interior-decorating sensibilities for our arousal. At least until the tables are turned (and a bit after, I'd say), Hard Candy is film noir as bright-red lollipop: Its intoxicating visuals lower our defenses as effectively as the roofie that Riding Hood slips to the big bad wolf in his own lair.
In the spirit of Lionsgate's Hostel  and The Devil's Rejects , a good half of this lurid two-hander is pure tortureto watch, some will say, particularly once the resourceful Hayley discovers her captive's secret stash of homemade child porn and gets to work with a hospital gurney, a bag of ice, and . . . that scalpel. (Dad, she explains, is a surgeon.) Much as I'm convinced of the filmmaker's own talent for cutting (and shooting), this critic would nearly kill to know how Carol J. Cloverthe rape- revenge-movie scholar who wrote the book on post- Psycho  horror ( Men, Women, and Chain Saws )will come to grips with Hard Candy , a film that forges identification with its victimized heroine like none I've seen in decades. (The Nova Scotia born Page, a Molly Ringwald  type who was only 15 when the movie was made, leaves little doubt as to whether a kid can play a grown-up's icky game and win.) Still, the only truly authoritative review may be that of a 14-year-old girl in an online chat room. If Hard Candy  is a fantasy, it's hersand, given the nature of most fantasies these days, she's entitled to it.
