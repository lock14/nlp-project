As Muna, a single Palestinian woman plunked down in small-town Illinois with her teenage son in Amreeka , the radiant, zaftig Nisreen Faour exudes an irresistible sweetness even when Muna's life is sour. After enduring the hassles and indignities of the West Bank, mother and son happily imagine a freer future in Amreeka (that's Arabic for ''America''). They find encouragement and temporary housing from Muna's Stateside sister (elegant Hiam Abbass from The Visitor ) and doctor   brother-in-law (Yussef Abu Warda). But the U.S. has just invaded Iraq. And the usual challenges of immigrant adjustment are compounded by the fears and prejudices of locals. (Abu Warda's doctor is losing patients  as filmmaker Cherien Dabis has said her own Ohio-based Palestinian physician father did at the time.) Only with perseverance does Muna, a banking professional, get a job  running the fryer and swabbing floors at White Castle. Meanwhile, her son (Melkar Muallem) faces his own hazing in public high school.
Amreeka  is strategically inviting and carefully mild even when making unsubtle points about Palestinian suffering and American insensitivity. Dramatic conflicts resolve, in the end, with the telltale brightness of a script that's been through the Sundance Lab's rinse cycle. But the good   humor, generosity, and love Dabis bestows on her characters in this assured first feature are uniquely hers  the mark of a talent to watch. A–


 Cherien Dabis’s “Amreeka” (the Arabic word for America) stands alongside “The Visitor" and “Maria Full of Grace” as one of the most accomplished recent films about a non-European immigrant coming to the United States. While the arrivals in the other two movies were not legal immigrants, the indomitably good-natured protagonist of “Amreeka,” Muna Farah (Nisreen Faour), is a divorced non-Muslim  Palestinian woman with  a green card.  “Amreeka,” which is set in 2003 at the outset of the American-led invasion of Iraq, is inspired by the experiences of Ms. Dabis, a Palestinian-Jordanian who grew up in Ohio and in Jordan and whose parents immigrated to the United States just before she was born. During the Persian Gulf war, she recalls in the production notes, her family faced the same kinds of persecution and ostracism that Muna and her sister’s family, the Halabys, suffer  as the invasion continues.  The early scenes in the West Bank show Muna stoically enduring the daily humiliation of having to pass through two Israeli checkpoints on her grueling commute from Bethlehem to work in a bank. For all the hardships of life in the West Bank, in coming to America, she is forsaking a relatively comfortable existence  to venture into the unknown with her 16-year-old son, Fadi (Melkar Muallem).  At the Chicago airport, where they are detained for three hours, mother and son endure the same sort of hostile interrogation they received at West Bank checkpoints. After finally passing through immigration, they are met by Muna’s severe sister, Raghda Halaby (Hiam Abbass), and her family, who live in a semi-rural suburb.  Raghda, who left  the West Bank 15 years earlier but is still profoundly homesick, is married to a successful Palestinian doctor, Nabeel (Yussef Abu Warda). The couple have three daughters, the oldest of whom, Salma (Alia Shawkat), is Fadi’s age and becomes his guide to the treacherous jungle of American high school life. Horrified at Fadi’s pleated trousers, because they make him look “F.O.B.” (“fresh off the boat,” she explains), she supervises his wardrobe for his first day of school, and the two become fellow rebels from the social mainstream.  Muna’s first major setback is her discovery while unpacking that the sealed tin of cookies in which she  had stashed all her money is missing, having been confiscated by the immigration authorities, along with the other food she had brought. Deeply ashamed, she is too proud to tell her sister.  Unlike other recent films about immigration, “Amreeka” maintains the buoyant mood of a serious sitcom. As Muna and Fadi confront hostility and prejudice, their misadventures, some of which augur disaster, are resolved without too much grief. The movie is peppered with little jokes. Scrutinizing the cover of a supermarket tabloid, Muna asks, “What does adopting an orangutan love child mean?” A roadside sign with missing letters advises, “Support our oops.”  The film’s upbeat tone reflects the resilience and sunny temperament of Muna, who as embodied by Ms. Faour is the kind of warm, lovable woman you want to hug. Desperate for work and unable to find it at a local bank, Muna takes a job at a White Castle next door but pretends to her family that the bank is her workplace.  At school, Fadi encounters ethnic slurs and bullying, and in the most serious incident is arrested after retaliating. At the same time, rising anti-Arab sentiment decimates Nabeel’s medical practice and strains the Halabys’ marriage. As his practice evaporates, Ms. Abbass, the great Palestinian actress who also appeared in “The Visitor,” imbues Raghda with a heavy weight of sorrow and anxiety.  Through it all, Muna perseveres. For every hostile person she encounters, there is a good Samaritan. Her co-workers at White Castle are understanding when she makes mistakes. Her most helpful ally is Mr. Novatski (Joseph Ziegler), the divorced Polish-Jewish principal at Fadi’s school, who comes to his rescue at a crucial turning point.  If, at moments, the film’s positive outlook verges on naïveté, it never strays over separating the possible from the preposterous. “Amreeka” believes in people, and its faith rubs off on you.  “Amreeka” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some strong language.

From the West Bank to White Castle flips the resilient heroine of "Amreeka," a culture-clash dramedy whose background in Middle-East conflict is leavened with vibrant energy, balanced politics and droll humor by first-time feature director Cherien Dabis. Enormously appealing turn by earthy Nisreen Faour in the lead role of Muna, a Palestinian single mother who brings her teenage son to rural Illinois in pursuit of a brighter future, more than makes up for the film's familiarities. The formulaic fish-out-of-water elements in Dabis' script actually suit her principled effort to make Muna easily identifiable. Kudos and a Stateside pickup seem likely.
Vividly lensed in Ramallah and Manitoba, with a modicum of English-subtitled Arabic dialogue, crowd-pleasingly topical "Amreeka" takes its name from the Arab word for "America." Pic opens on the West Bank, just prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with divorced Muna's discovery of the green card that will take her and 16-year-old Fadi (Melkar Muallem) away from their daily drive through menacing checkpoints to Jerusalem. More of a similar nature, however, accompanies Muna and her son at the Chicago airport, where the modest seed money she had naively wrapped in a cookie tin gets confiscated by customs agents, leaving her broke upon arrival at the suburban home of her sister Raghda (Hiam Abbass), married with three kids.
Thickly accented and pudgy Muna tries and fails to land a bank management job similar to the one she held back home, leading her to take work at a White Castle and struggle to keep it secret from her sister and son. As much as the first "Harold and Kumar" movie, "Amreeka" serves the fast-food chain's bottom line even as it pokes mild fun at greasy sliders, which Muna at one point hilariously replaces with fresh falafel burgers to the delight of her blue-haired young co-worker.
Building to a warm and inclusive vision of immigrant family life, "Amreeka" might meet reflexive derision in some quarters for seeming either too PC or not political enough. Although Dabis, particularly in scenes at Fadi's new school, maintains the presence of white prejudice and the threat of violence, she takes care to reassure her audience that the film will protect its characters from grave harm.
The writer-director scores bonus points by pointing up ironies such as the "Peace" bumper sticker on the car of Fadi's cousin Salma (Alia Shawkat), who initiates a plan to let the air out of a racist bully's SUV tires. So, too, the friendly school principal (Joseph Ziegler) who takes a shine to Muna is not only Jewish, but bears a passing resemblance to Donald Rumsfeld.
In addition to Faour's irresistible turn as Muna, acting is strong and believable. Dabis and her crew make creative use of locations in the teeming West Bank and the wide-open spaces of suburban Illinois. The images, captured with handheld film cameras, have a pleasingly grainy texture, and the sprinkling of Arabic pop on the soundtrack helps keep Dabis' tribute to Middle-Eastern culture authentic and jaunty.

The thriving subgenre of immigrant displacement dramedy gets a confident new spin from Cherien Dabis, a Palestinian-Jordanian raised in the United States. Divorced, demoralized, and struggling with her weight, Palestinian bank employee Muna (a very good Nisreen Faour) leaves the occupied West Bank  with her teenaged son, Fadi (Melkar Muallem), to find a new home with her sister (The Visitor 's Hiam Abbass ) in Chicago. The discovery that she has exchanged one set of checkpoints for another doesn't prevent Muna—an archetypical maternal survivor straight out of Italian neorealism—from buckling down to the business of survival in a culture whose traditional mistrust of dark-skinned foreigners is exacerbated by 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq . Dabis concedes only subtitles to Western sensitivities—the perspective is firmly with the newcomers, whose dialogue switches on a dime from Arabic to English, signaling the constant juggling every acclimating migrant must undertake. But there's nothing bitter or cynical about Amreeka , which is directed with impish wit, an observant visual competence, and an open, conciliatory spirit (Muna befriends her son's Jewish teacher) that embraces the marginality that Arabs and Jews share in common.
