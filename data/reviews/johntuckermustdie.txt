"John Tucker Must Die" is so named because three high school girls, all of whom the title jock (Jesse Metcalfe) has been dating simultaneously, unite for revenge. The movie, however, is not a teen redo of ``The Witches of Eastwick" (but there's an idea). This is a cuter bit of business. Badly made and written, with acting that's been done better on reality television shows, the film needs some of Jack Nicholson's devilish charm. Instead, we get Metcalfe, the lusty lawnmower boy from ``Desperate Housewives," a dreamboat with no sails.
The movie is as inconsequentially pleasant as its star, and far nicer than the title lets on, too. Discovering that they're being played, John's paramours -- the cheerleader (Ashanti), the randy eco-activist (Sophia Bush), and the rigid overachiever (Arielle Kebbel) -- don't actually try to kill their ex-boyfriend. They wage a campaign to make him less popular. (I suppose ``John Tucker Must Be Humiliated" just doesn't have the same ring.) Still, the plot to assassinate his character is futile, since the kid turns out to be socially bulletproof. In one botched prank, he even gives herpes a good name.
When plan A fails, the movie manages to stir some interest. The exes enlist the New Girl, Kate (Brittany Snow), to win John's heart, then break it. Kate, of course, is a virginal, serious student whose cynicism toward men feels true even if the family dynamic that inspired it doesn't. John Tucker reminds Kate of her mother's ex-boyfriends. (Alas, Jenny McCarthy plays the Slutty Itinerant Mom.)
Gradually, the girls teach inexperienced Kate in the ways of cruelty and seduction (cue the Instructional Girl-on-Girl Kiss), and they have a surprisingly good time punking their ex. But Kate turns conflicted about the scheme when John's younger, somehow dreamier, brother (Penn Badgley) develops a crush on her.
But Snow, who was so unconvincing as the good girl desperate to be bad on NBC's ``American Dreams," gives her wide-eyed perkiness the bite a movie this innocuous needs: She's the one person you don't have to fight yourself to like.
Obviously, the plot against the cad is a gimmick, but there's a conviction guiding it that anyone can relate to: Who hasn't wanted to demoralize an old boyfriend by making him wear a thong then tricking him into her coach's hotel bed? That cheerful contempt fuels the first hour.
But then the movie transforms into an altogether more valuable lesson about priorities: boys are stupid, and you'll never be able to deprogram their fundamental roving nature anyway, so, girls, let's just be friends. This, actually, is the rare teen movie to find boys a dim clan of insecure conformists. The 1999 Melissa Joan Hart-Adrian Grenier team-up, ``Drive Me Crazy," and 2004's ``Mean Girls" were similarly perplexed. ``John Tucker" is more explicit about its moral.
I just wish there were more professionalism behind it. Veteran director Betty Thomas (``Private Parts," ``Doctor Doolittle," ``28 Days," ``I Spy") has yet to meet a movie she couldn't make inert and unsightly. This one is like watching 100 minutes of acne.


You'd think, with a movie called John Tucker Must Die , that the high school basketball stud of the title (Jesse Metcalfe) had done something wrong. Ostensibly, he's been caught dating three pretty girls at the same time, but, really, is that a big deal? Well, no, according to this confused female-disempowerment flick. The trio  assisted by a cherubic Brittany Snow  plot delicious revenges on handsome John. But  astonishingly (and offensively), the witless ending comes down harder on the women than the cad.

 More and more, today’s teen comedies send me running to the video store for a fix of John Hughes. At least there’s a heart beating behind his goofy-sweet tales of high school awkwardness. Not so in Betty Thomas’s “John Tucker Must Die,” a dispiriting revenge fantasy engineered by three waspish Barbies against one disposable Ken.  The titular target is a preening basketball star (Jesse Metcalfe) whose queen-bee girlfriends plot payback for the damage he has supposedly inflicted on their brittle little hearts. When attempts to discredit his masculinity and genital hygiene misfire, the ladies bait a love trap with never-been-kissed Kate (Brittany Snow), a nerd with anonymity issues. After the inevitable mouse-to-hottie makeover, Kate is ready to turn John on then snuff him out. Metaphorically speaking.  Unforgivably clueless about teen culture (how many high-school iPods are currently blasting Cheap Trick?), “John Tucker Must Die” can’t even sustain the courage of its girl-power convictions, switching allegiance in the final reel. Yet there’s a Parker Posey snap to Sophia Bush’s portrayal of the vegan girlfriend, and Penn Badgley is wildly charismatic in the role of John Tucker’s younger brother. The entire picture could hang on his cheekbones alone.  If only Mr. Metcalfe shared his talents. Mustering fewer expressions than a Botox infomercial, he struggles to emote even when his character’s protein shake is spiked with estrogen. “I’m anxious and bloated and my nipples hurt!” he whines unconvincingly. Doesn’t he know that acting well is the best revenge?  “John Tucker Must Die” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has boys in thongs, girls in bras and comedy in peril.

Less bloodthirsty than its title would suggest, the feisty teen revenge comedy "John Tucker Must Die" follows the "Heathers" and "Mean Girls" mold of teaming an impressionable heroine with a trio of imperious high school babes; this time, however, they're united in their mission to eradicate not mean girls, but a boy who's broken one heart too many. Predictable developments are more or less redeemed by spirited execution and the pleasures of an able, good-looking cast -- which means Fox stands a fair chance of turning "Must Die" into must-see teen fare.
After briefly introducing herself by way of self-deprecating voiceover, lovely but socially inept teenager Kate (Brittany Snow) quickly turns the story over to its rightful subject, John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe), captain of the basketball team and the most popular stud on campus.
As Kate finds out through her waitressing job, John is secretly dating three girls at once: hot-tempered head cheerleader Heather (pop/R&B singer Ashanti); extracurricular overachiever and multimedia whiz Carrie (Arielle Kebbel); and bodacious vegan Beth (Sophia Bush).
It's not long before the truth comes out, and after a nicely staged three-way catfight in which Kate becomes unfortunately entangled, the four girls band together to punish John for his lady-killing ways. Their initial stabs at tarnishing his image -- spiking his muscle supplements with estrogen, for instance -- are conceived along sitcomish lines, but play out amusingly enough.
John, ever the rebounder, has an uncanny ability to turn even his setbacks into suave victories. And when he dumps Heather, Carrie and Beth in rapid succession (in a sharply cut sequence that plays up the girls' interchangeability), they decide to exact the ultimate revenge by setting him up with naive, inexperienced Kate -- easy enough, once she joins the cheer squad -- and then have her break his heart.
What follows is essentially a very frothy youthful update of "Les liaisons dangereuses," with the added twist that both girl and guy are scamming each other. Kate's friends initiate her in the alien rituals of high school courtship, while John nearly exhausts his supply of empty sweet talk trying to score with this beguilingly hard-to-get newcomer.
Screenplay is the first feature-length effort from TV scribe Jeff Lowell ("Spin City"), and while it boasts a confident structure and quite a few saucy one-liners, several of the key set-pieces -- one of which has John tricked into wearing female undies -- feel recycled from old "Friends" episodes. Nor does the pic quite know what to do with John's sensitive younger brother Scott (Penn Badgley), or Kate's mom Lori (Jenny McCarthy), whose constantly revolving door of boyfriends is meant to provide her daughter with an emotional history.
Helmer Betty Thomas ("Private Parts," "The Brady Bunch Movie") has a snappy, engaging style and an occasional weakness for belaboring jokes. But to her credit, she doesn't even try to pass off this glossy, enjoyable comic fantasy as a credible slice of high school life, and she casts a sympathetic net around all her characters, mainly by letting their charisma speak for itself.
Snow, whose adorable blend of innocence and spunk suggests a less worldly Olsen twin, makes Kate easy to root for as a stuttering wallflower who grows in naughty confidence. As her partners in crime, Ashanti, Kebbel and Bush tear into their parts with bitchy enthusiasm, though their snippy backbiting is at times overdirected.
Metcalfe, last seen as Eva Longoria's botanical boy-toy on "Desperate Housewives," could hardly be more ideally cast as a smooth operator who, even at his most caddish, is almost too charming to loathe. When someone warns him that Kate isn't his type, and he retorts, "Girl
 is my type," one is hard-pressed to disagree.
Musical selections, supervised by Alexandra Patsavas, strike mostly obvious notes, although Rick Nielsen's "I Want You to Want Me" is thoughtfully integrated into the action.

If only. No one buys the farm in this Heathers -wannabe teen "satire," a term used so loosely it'll fly off in a stiff breeze. But the title's difficult to argue with, unless it's to maintain that we'd all be better off if the film's entire roster of characters had been shot in the head at the dump, greyhound-style. But enough about me: John Tucker  (the plasticine Jesse Metcalf ) is a rich-boy high school demigod boffing three princesses (Arielle Kebbel , Ashanti , Sophia Bush ), to the revulsion of shy unpopular kid Kate (Brittany Snow ). The trio discovers his supa-player scheme and plots revengewhich quickly devolves from dreams of violence (my dream, too) to spiking his sports drink with estrogen and setting Kate up as his new honey with the intent to crush his inviolable heart. The script-performance synergy is pure Disney Channel  sitcom, with moderate relief provided by Bush, the only hireling here who seems to have actually watched a comedy once in her short little life. Whatever the target demographic was in the pre-production phase, now it's limited to sexually active 14-year-olds still retaking the sixth grade.
