 Genevieve (Nia Vardalos) and Greg (John Corbett), the conflicted lovebirds in the bottom-drawer romantic comedy “I Hate Valentine’s Day,” may be in their 30s, but they play the game of romance with the finesse of sixth graders in the spin-the-bottle phase of hormonal exploration.  Genevieve, who owns a Brooklyn flower shop called Roses for Romance, has contrived a code of serial courtship in which she terminates each budding relationship after five dates, before she can be seriously hurt.  Greg, a former lawyer from Atlanta, has opened a nearby restaurant called Get on Tapas, whose cutesy-poo name, which nobody seems to get, says everything about the movie’s moronic level of wit.  Ms. Vardalos, who directed, plays her character like a walking smiley-face button. Accompanied by two chirping gay Stepin Fetchits, Genevieve is so “on” that when her rules backfire and the fatuous grin is finally wiped off her face, your impulse is to applaud. His thin lips twisted into what seems to be a sneer, Mr. Corbett (Ms. Vardalos’s co-star in “My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) squints through the role of the doltish restaurateur who wreaks havoc by dutifully following her rules.  Their romance proceeds like clockwork until it is consummated with a two-night sleepover, which she interprets as their fourth date and he (after the second night) as their fifth. It takes the last third of the movie to resolve their disagreement, which is settled on Valentine’s Day, exactly a year after the story begins.  You might blame Nora Ephron, whose screenplay for “When Harry Met Sally” established the formula that “I Hate Valentine’s Day” runs into the ground. Compared with this, Ms. Ephron is Chekhov.  “I Hate Valentine’s Day” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.

"I Hate Valentine's Day" reps a return to scrappy, low-budget filmmaking for Nia Vardalos, who scored one of the most profitable indies of all time with her screenwriting debut, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," only to struggle with successive follow-ups. However, the off-kilter warmth of that film is nowhere to be found in this one, a plodding mediocrity with an almost mercenary adherence to formula. Reteaming of Vardalos with her "Wedding" co-star John Corbett should up the interest level in advance of pic's July 3 release, though it's doubtful that word of mouth will carry it very far.
First seen turning the world on with her smile, scripter and first-time director Vardalos stars as Genevieve, a flower shop owner who is the darling of her impossibly cuddly Brooklyn neighborhood. Working with her pair of prancing gay assistants (Stephen Guarino and Amir Arison, both playing stereotypes imported from the early '90s), she cheerfully opens up her store for the Valentine's Day rush, blessed with a preternatural gift for advising clueless men on the best ways to woo their sweethearts (among her suggestions: chocolates, flowers).
Yet despite all her wisdom, Genevieve is afflicted with a self-inflicted dating handicap: Since she loves romance and hates relationships, she refuses to go on more than five dates with any one particular man, thus summarily cutting off all affairs before the giddiness of early infatuation can begin to decline. No one in Genevieve's huge circle of colorful friends remarks on the utter preposterousness of this policy and, in fact, they all flock to her for advice on their own love lives.�
Of course, Genevieve's system comes immediately under fire when studly charmer Greg (Corbett) strolls into the shop. A former lawyer who has just quit the firm and bought a neighboring restaurant space in order to start up a tapas bar, Greg is dating a flight attendant yet unsure if the relationship is going anywhere (all the preceding backstory is spilled in the course of ordering a few roses). Things quickly go sour with the flight attendant, and Greg confides in Genevieve during the first of their five circumscribed dates, immediately hitting it off. Anyone who can't see where this is going should have their driving privileges immediately revoked.
From here, "I Hate Valentine's Day" hits all the requisite beats of the romantic-comedy liturgy with precision, but does so perfunctorily, as though filling out a quota. The central premise is unbelievable without being interesting or audacious, and its late attempts to expand the emotional palette palate just simply don't come off.�
Toplining her second movie of the season, after the recent "My Life in Ruins," Vardalos is a decent comedic actress, but she clearly lacks the experience to direct herself on camera: For much of the film she wears a strained beauty-queen smile, delivering her lines like a kindergarten teacher explaining the metric system. Yet the biggest problem with her perf seems to revolve around a misunderstanding of her appeal. In "Wedding," she radiated an awkward Everywoman vulnerability; here, she is effortlessly successful, smart, glamorous, beloved by friends who hang on her every word and able to pick and choose from handsome men she cruelly dismisses in accordance with her bizarre rules. Why the audience should sympathize with her plight is not a question that seems to have been raised.
Save for a few forced laughs at the expense of a heavily accented Indian man, the film is at least bereft of any ethnic caricature. Supporting characters run the gamut from Greg's law-school buddy Cal (Gary Wilmes), who is so loathsome and irritating that he ceases to be recognizably human, to Genevieve's adorably pathetic friend Tammy (the wonderful Zoe Kazan), who confuses courtship with stalking and who seems to have been beamed in from a smarter, cuter film.
Vardalos finds a suitably snappy rhythm, and shoestring technical work captures Gotham locations nicely.

Introducing her new romantic comedy at the Los Angeles Greek Film Festival, writer/director/star Nia Vardalos  warned attending critics who had "come here to dump all over it" to "put a cork in it." Alas! Corks must pop for a glorified sitcom as transcendently inept and self-regarding as I Hate Valentine's Day . Slim, trim, and far too old to be simpering like a demented kitten, Vardalos affects a bizarrely self-conscious runway lope through this naked attempt to repeat the box-office moxie of her big, fat Greek wedding. Trading Toula for Genevieve, Vardalos is now an apparently fancy-free Manhattan florist who sets a five-date limit on all potential relationships until she meets a shy restaurateur (John Corbett , again) with permanence written all over his handsome mug. Flanked by the usual gay stooges (Stephen Guarino  and Amir Arison ) gamely cracking wise and an ensemble of sidekicks (among them Rachel Dratch , Jay O. Sanders , and Gary Wilmes ) more gifted than she, Vardalos stalks from one dreary set piece to the next (pretentious art shows, dire karaokethat sort of thing), wearing an expression of petrified vivacity occasionally softened by, here it comes, the childhood wounds that have rendered Genevieve so scared of commitment. Vardalos calls her film "the ultimate indie experiment," and if that's what is meant by ham-fisted pacing, writing, and acting, this is as ultimate and as indie as it gets.
