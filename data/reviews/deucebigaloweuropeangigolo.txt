Give credit to the makers of "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" for stopping short of having Rob Schneider turn tricks in Anne Frank's old attic. That's maybe the only way this wretched sequel could've been more tasteless, and it probably would've been a step up in terms of comedy. Sorry, Deuce fans, but Schneider's faux-sexy alter ego is back with a thud, not a bang, this time stirring up trouble in Amsterdam, where he's aged about as attractively as a two-dollar hooker.
In 1999's "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo," "Saturday Night Live" veteran Schneider and co-writer Harris Goldberg actually managed some laughs and genuinely sweet moments in the course of their thin-stretched sketch about a hapless Malibu aquarium cleaner who stumbles into a brief flirtation with prostitution. Sure, the humor was crass and the "Risky Business"-style plot insipid, but with the bar set very low, director Mike Mitchell at least delivered a fish story that didn't completely stink.
This time the director is Mike Bigelow, an unknown whose only asset seems to be his close-enough last name, and the brain trust of toilet-trained writers includes "Corky Romano" authors David Garrett and Jason Ward.
As you probably don't remember, the first movie ended with word that Deuce married his one-legged sweetheart, Kate (Arija Bareikis), after which the two started a "radical anti-sushi resistance movement" and lived "happily ever after." But that was before anyone knew Deuce would be sequel material. In "European Gigolo," we're informed that Kate was actually killed in a shark attack during the honeymoon, and all Deuce has left is the prosthetic leg he carts around for companionship.
When a mishap again lands him in hot water, Deuce flees to Amsterdam to reunite with T.J. (Eddie Griffin), the jive-talking pimp from the first movie, who these days lives on a leaky houseboat that's tricked out like a Cadillac. Deuce learns that someone's knocking off the great gigolos of Europe, and when T.J. stands accused, he must come out of retirement to find the real killer.
Big mistake.
If all the first "Deuce" had going for it was a regular-guy approach to over-the-top humor, that's completely absent in this follow-up. Now everything's been amped up and dumbed down (yes, it's possible) to where the standout performance is Norm Macdonald's cameo.
Macdonald is just one of many partially recycled elements: The sequel amply revisits the mock slanguage of pimps and "prostidudes," and Deuce again gets paired with women who are giant, deformed, or have behavioral ticks. He falls for a nymph with obsessive-compulsive disorder (Hanna Verboom), which oddly means he's passing on the gal who spews red wine out of her tracheotomy hole, as well as the veiled Chernobyl victim whose nose is a functioning penis.
And here you thought "tasteless" was just a word.
Not even Schneider's "SNL" career, his Adam Sandler connections (this is another Happy Madison Production), or his motley catalog of previous films ("The Animal," "The Hot Chick") prepares a viewer for the lengths to which "Deuce 2" will go to get no laugh. Griffin is reduced to eating fries out of a toilet (a step down from T.J.'s earlier hot-tub buffets) and prying a cat off his private parts. Heaven knows what possessed respected actor Jeroen Krabbe ("Soldier of Orange") to take on the role of a Dutch detective.
Is it too late to redefine "Eurotrash"?


         Rob Schneider returns as an unlikely male prostitute in "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo," who after some mishaps in Malibu heads for further adventures in Amsterdam, where he finds his former pimp T.J. (Eddie Griffin) suspected of being a Jack the Ripper-type killer of male hustlers. T.J. is more alarmed at being viewed as possibly gay, an unsettling thought in a macho extreme gross-out comedy reveling in all manner of sexual activity and involving a wide range of physical deformities and bathroom humor.
 
  The mentality is that of a middle-school male grappling with puberty, but an R rating will make the movie largely off-limits to boys, as it's not the kind of picture parents generally take their children to see. In a script fashioned from a story written for himself, Schneider really isn't much of a gigolo but rather a dimwitted do-gooder. Director Mike Bigelow maintains a mercifully swift pace, and while the film's humor is deliberately as crass as humanly possible, it is not truly mean-spirited, even though Amsterdam is depicted as a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah.

  Maine city faces 'Somali Invasion'
 
 
Ziad H. Hamzeh's "The Letter: An American Town and the 'Somali Invasion' " charts the chaos that Larry Raymond, the elderly, conservative mayor of Lewiston, Maine, unleashed in the wake of 9/11 when he wrote an open letter declaring that more Somali refugees would not be welcome in his city. Raymond has said that Lewiston, in decline since the waning of its textile industry in the 1960s and '70s, has "maxed out" its economic resources. But his missive sparked anger directed at the 1,100 Somali refugees who under a progressive mayor had been welcomed to the picture-postcard town.
 
  The letter encouraged the least-educated and poorest sectors of the community to lash out at Somali neighbors who they believed got a better break from the government — information from City Hall needlessly inflamed the situation. Raymond's letter triggered a media circus and attracted the attention of hate groups, which culminated in a rally staged by the World Church of the Creator and a counter-demonstration celebrating civic unity and multicultural diversity that involved more than 4,000 concerned Lewiston citizens.
 
  "The Letter" has a terrifying in-your-face immediacy, a strong cross-section of talking heads on both sides of the debate, and cuts deeply into the cultural wars dividing this country. Yet it could have been even more powerful with more context, clarity and a well-defined timeline. Undeniably strong, "The Letter" is at times misleading and confusing, possessing the raw materials for a much more coherent and potent film.

Ah, Deuce (Rob Schneider)  remember him? Of course you do. Someone bought all those DVDs of the 1999 original and necessitated this sequel, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo . He's the sweetly dumb ''he-bitch'' who, for $10, will date the undatable. He even married an amputee. (Wow!) After his bride is eaten by a shark, Deuce gets back in the game  this time in Amsterdam, where he must clear his pimp, T.J. (Eddie Griffin), of charges of murder and ''gayness.''
With Hollywood's gross-out wars fought and forgotten (and the comparatively brainy Wedding Crashers  securely on the sex-comedy throne), it's nice to know Schneider is still out there in the jungle, shaking his French tickler defiantly at the sky. His movie, while sloppier than the sloppiest of seconds, is laudable in one important regard: Its obsession with the male body (the only memorable female character has a priapic nose) provides a ''safe space'' for closeted frat brothers to come out, or at least make a ''joking'' grab for each other's genitals. In fact, this may be the most forthrightly bisexual movie ever made for the American mainstream. The world thanks you, Rob Schneider.

 In his 1999 debut, Deuce Bigalow emerged as a shameless beach bum, driving a clunker in a land of Porsche Cayennes, cleaning the scum from the fish tanks of the rich and famous.  A housesitting gig leads Deuce, played by Rob Schneider, into the oldest profession, and he makes the most of his various dates. As a companion for hire who charges only $10, he persuades women to reveal their hurts and faults (some are quite obvious), and they get more than they pay for: healing, and not necessarily the sexual kind. Each hokey vignette is mockery disguised as self-help.  Six blessedly Deuce-free years later, the character's creators, including Mr. Schneider's former "Saturday Night Live" cast mate Adam Sandler, are up to their old exploits in "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo." They spend the film's full 77 minutes making jokes about passed gas, ethnic differences, disabilities and the shame surrounding genitalia. Setting their film in Europe gives them a wider world of cultural stereotypes to milk. In the laissez-faire haven of Amsterdam, Deuce tries to gain acceptance in a guild of gigolos by protecting his colleagues from a homicidal predator who is thinning their ranks.  The material is also wearing thin. Last time, the script chose Tourette's syndrome and limb amputation as grounds for derision, and this time it's blindness, obsessive-compulsive disorder, the removal of a larynx and even one made-up affliction that involves a woman with a penis where her nose should be.  Eddie Griffin is back as T J, riffing on the caricature of an African-American pimp. He is the purveyor of most of the movie's insults, with his unfunny venom usually directed at Asians and gay men. (Charitably, he tries to pay one gay man a compliment by explaining that he sees him as "a normal gay, not a crazy gay - like a musical-theater gay.") Then when photographers catch T J reaching inside two corpses' zippers, he explains that he doesn't mind being accused of murder so much as he fears people will think that he is gay.  Despite the story's claims that Deuce soothes the lonely ladies, there is an essential meanness to the entire project, tapping the manipulative power of taunts. Such jokes don't jibe with the times, the culture or the rebranded Adam Sandler, who has been vying for plaudits and legitimacy in "Spanglish" and "Punch-Drunk Love." Here he helps out his old friend Mr. Schneider with a cameo appearance and takes a step backward. These two fraudulent funny men are banking on some cynical formula that mixes the happy-go-lucky and the hurtful, the curative and the destructive.  "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes every imaginable profanity and absurdly graphic sexual content.

Rude, crude and, uh, cosmopolitan, "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" waves the flag for R-rated politically incorrect studio comedy but doesn't top the laugh ratio of the first Deuce misadventure. It's taken a full six years for the reappearance of Rob Schneider's utterly incongruous, dunder-headed stud from "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo," so references to the previous pic hardly strike a chord. Mid-August opening slot looks prime for at least a few weeks' worth of customers before college terms begin, while vid could be orgasmic.
New "Deuce" was developed by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison shingle, and it can now be said that there's a quintessentially Happy Madison kind of movie. It features dumb, young white Americans and their even dumber if well-intentioned pals in situations far over their heads, who cross paths with enormous women, over-confident male villains and, almost always, someone peeing in public.
All are on ample display here, starting with fish-loving Deuce, who tries to send a sonar warning to fend off sharks at the Malibu shoreline and manages instead to make the dolphins go berserk and munch on unsuspecting retirees. An APB is put out on him just as homophobic pimp and buddy T.J. (Eddie Griffin) phones to invite him to Amsterdam.
With the artificial leg of his dead g.f. Kate under his arm, Deuce flees to the land (as depicted here) of hookers-in-red-lit-windows, canals and unrestricted pot smoking. Though it provides one funny visual joke, pic's obsession with pot smoking is strange for a film set in the present as Dutch libertarianism is hardly a hot pop culture topic anymore. But at least it serves the franchise's best side, which is a yen for gag -- and gag-worthy -- scenes and plot be damned.
But, a plot does surface. Unfortunately, it makes the whole movie go limp. Euro gigolo deluxe Heinz Hummer (fine thesp Til Schweiger, slumming it big time) is found murdered in an alley, setting off a dreary narrative in which T.J. deduces that he'll find the killer by using Deuce as bait. This means that Deuce must resume his gigolo act with a string of dates, each one grosser than the last.
Meanwhile, arrogant Amsterdam cop Gaspar Voorsboch (Jeroen Krabbe) predictably concludes that Deuce is a nuisance. What he doesn't know is that Deuce has the eye of his pretty but insanely obsessive-compulsive niece Eva (Hanna Verboom).
During the many dull moments under director Mike Bigelow's sloppy direction, Deuce-o-philes can ponder if the giant woman pestering our hero in the first film was more horrifically funny than the new model, a behemoth customer who makes Deuce wear an adult diaper.
With its few funny highs, pic stumbles along, finally deflating even the shock of its obnoxious skewering of a myriad of groups, ranging from pro-Iraq war supporters to the French, from Canadians to little people. It's exactly when "European Gigolo" is sloppiest, most random and freely rude that it feels most in touch with its Happy Madison side, which will be comfort to some.
Schneider has come a long way from yelling "You can DO it!!" in every Sandler movie, but he still can't act and has two basic expressions: Wide eyes in a dull haze, or a slightly charming smile.
Griffin, piling on the verbal energy, is a fair contrast and good foil for Schneider, but they hardly rank with the best comic teams. Verboom contributes some cutes, while Krabbe, Schweiger and Douglas Sills as topper of the Euro gigolo org bring some savoir faire.
Pic, made with largely Dutch crew in primarily Dutch and other Continental locales, is extremely low budget. Oded Fehr appears too briefly reprising his gigolo persona from first pic, while Norm Macdonald makes his usual uncredited, and amusing, cameo bow. Along with late "SNL" writer Drake Sather, murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh receives an unlikely but nice dedication in closing credits.

Using his newfound clout, executive producer Adam Sandler  muscled to completion Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo , a turd so redolent that not even the first Bigalow  director would touch it. The eponymous prosti-dude (Rob Schneider ) finds himself in Amsterdam  trying to clear his pimp friend (Eddie Griffin ) of the "man whore murders," in which Europe's greatest male prostitutes are being killed off one by one. While tracking down the real he-bitch killer, Deuce once again escorts a gallery of grotesque and lonely women, including an esophageal-cancer-surgery patient spewing cigarette smoke and red wine through her throat hole, and a woman born with a penis in place of a nosewho, when she sneezes, shoots projectile jizz across the room. The rest of the movie consists of Schneider and Griffin running through standard gay jokes, belittling Asian penis size, and compiling a weakly humorous list of unexplained sexual maneuvers (Turkish snow cone, sneaky Cuban, Chilean rainbow, etc.). European Gigolo 's biggest sins, however, are in not coming up with novel variations on stock fratboy comedy (à la Wedding Crashers ), or proffering any redeeming sweetness like the Farrelly bothers do. It's an unimaginative, mean-spirited gross-out that forgot to bring the funny.
