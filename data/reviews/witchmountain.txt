What once was a strange, flavorless children's movie (1975's "Escape to Witch Mountain") is now the most heavily armed Disney family film ever made. And this is before Dwayne Johnson's biceps get in on the action. Yes, Johnson, the nimble comedian and promising actor, is back to arching his eyebrows and muscling extras through plate glass as though he'd just left the wrestling ring. As with "The Game Plan," his hit from 2007, it's for the kids.
In "Race to Witch Mountain," he plays Jack Bruno, a Las Vegas taxi driver who helps two exceptionally blond, exceptionally robotic children (AnnaSophia Robb, Alexander Ludwig) look for their spaceship. The kids are aliens with superpowers who've embarked on an interstellar mission, the nature of which receives paragraph-length exposition. No one talks in this film, but everyone explains, almost always while on the run.
Why a race to Witch Mountain, as opposed to an escape? I imagine the change has to do with the sequence of Jack's cab barreling the wrong way down a railroad; or the one in which he and the space kids flee a giant metallic assassin, a burning shack, bolts of laser light, and exploding slime pods; or another that requires him and a sexy "astrophysical anomaly detection" expert (Carla Gugino) to plummet down a water slide  - I mean, exhaust pipe. This is not a movie. It's a coming attraction for a theme park.
No one seems to have cared enough to give a human personality to the movie, which is based on the same adventure book that the 1975 film was. Directed by Andy Fickman, who also made "The Game Plan," this new movie is certainly the spiffier product. The original's special effects (an upside-down helicopter, say) looked like they were sent straight to the screen from a box of Cracker Jack. But Eddie Albert, in Johnson's part, had a loneliness in his face that makes the movie's monotonous extra-terrestrial after-school-specialness bearable. And the two kids had natural charm, too.
This new, jacked-up version wouldn't pass a drug test for performance enhancers. In "Race to Witch Mountain" all the scenes set in a busy control room are like all such scenes. This time it's Ciaran Hinds, as a Defense Department baddie (very previous administration), who does the over-the-shoulder, over-the-top peering at the monitors of minions in order to see what Jack and the kids are up to. He's chasing them down to exploit them. If the last 20 minutes of "E.T" were stretched to an hour and a half, then drained of any emotional gusto, you'd have this movie, which, truth be told, plays more as if the producers and director were looking to catch Jerry Bruckheimer's eye: car crashes, shoot-outs, fisticuffs, a guitar-synth score that suggests a video-game version is also in the offing.
The violence plays like certain video games, a cause for alarm for an audience that still watches "Yo Gabba Gabba!" Will kids freak out when scores of soldiers open fire on the blonds? Could they already be desensitized to that sort of thing? The MPAA rating is PG for sequences of "action and violence, frightening and dangerous situations, and some thematic elements." For what it's worth, that's not far from the second "Terminator" movie, which won an R in 1991. As for the vague "thematic elements," that might have something to do with the possibility that Disney is trying to top James Cameron's body count.

In Race to Witch Mountain , Dwayne ''the Rock'' Johnson plays a lonely taxi driver. Is he, per Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle, awaiting the day when a real rain will come and wash the scum off the streets? Hey, maybe he is, But we never find out, because  as this is a remake of the beloved 1975 Disney movie Escape to Witch Mountain   he's soon too busy helping two cute alien kids avoid government agents and (some sort of extraterrestrial robot assassin) to have time for such apocalyptic thoughts. Helpfully, the planet-hopping children have special talents  telekinesis, telepathy etc.  although it is the high-wattage lovability of Mr Rock that's the real superpower on display here.

 I took my daughter, who recently turned 10, to see “Race to Witch Mountain.” Yes, this is one of those Dad-goes-to-the-movies reviews, but surely you didn’t think I was going to see it alone. When the movie was over, as my own impressions buzzed distractingly around in my head, I asked her what she thought. “It was O.K.,” she said. “It was pretty noisy, though.”  Really, what more can I add? And also, what else did she expect? When I was around her age,  there was “Escape to Witch Mountain,” which starred Donald Pleasance, Eddie Albert and Ray Milland; it was based on a popular kiddie-sci-fi novel by Alexander Key and was followed a few years later  by “Return From Witch Mountain,” with, of all people, Bette Davis and Christopher Lee.  As I recall, they were O.K., but in those days Disney live-action juvenile pictures had less competition and were thus less compelled to be loud and dazzling. They were, in fact, kind of strange and spooky. This one, which stars Dwayne Johnson as Jack Bruno, a Las Vegas taxi driver who becomes the unwitting protector of two towheaded aliens, is modest and diverting, rough and bland, with some good (if not quite Bette Davis caliber) actors and so-so special effects.  Mr. Johnson  belongs in the latter category, though his range improves with every role and his natural, lapidary charisma takes him a long way. He is best when he expresses an agitated annoyance amusingly at odds with his solid, muscular presence. He doesn’t really have much to do in “Race to Witch Mountain” (which was directed with reasonable competence by Andy Fickman) — throw some punches, react with incredulity and, well, race to Witch Mountain — but it’s not painful to watch him do it.  Nor to see Carla Gugino pretend to be an astrophysicist whose research is ignored until it’s almost too late, or Ciaran Hinds scowl and bark as a government heavy intent on hunting down the cute little extraterrestrials. They are Seth (Alexander Ludwig) and Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and, like many others of their kind, their English is impeccable, though they are unable to use contractions or slang, or to refer to people by first names alone.  Their powers are impressive — Sara can read Jack’s mind and also talk to dogs; Seth can reach through metal and create force fields — but erratic enough that they need Jack to smack around their pursuers. These include not only the terrestrial government heavy but also his counterpart from Seth and Sarah’s home planet, an assassin with a mask and plated armor.  Jack also has some hoodlums on his tail, apparently because the movie needed a few more black S.U.V.’s driven by guys with shaved heads. It benefits more from the half-clever, sort of obvious conceit of staging a big action set piece in the middle of a science fiction convention full of costumed fans and geeks.  Such folks will not find much to groove on in “Race to Witch Mountain” — the threat of Earth’s destruction or colonization is so perfunctory that it doesn’t rise to the level of allegory — but it will amuse some of their young counterparts until summertime. Provided they don’t mind the noise.  “Race to Witch Mountain” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some rough action sequences.

Smartly positioned for maximum potential as a breakout spring hit with cross-generational appeal, "Race to Witch Mountain" is the sort of full-throttle crowd-pleaser capable of grabbing even teen and twentysomething ticketbuyers who normally avoid anything that smacks of "family entertainment." There's something for almost every demo here -- including baby-boomers with fond memories of the original Disney-produced "Witch Mountain" pics of the 1970s -- and the entire package is impressively propelled by the star-powered, likably comic-macho perf by Dwayne Johnson (formerly known as the Rock). Expect strong B.O. numbers, even stronger homevid sales and very early talk of a possible sequel.
Hyped as a "modern-day re-imagining" of the novel by Alexander Key -- which previously inspired "Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) and its sequel "Return from Witch Mountain" (1978) -- "Race" justifies its title by coming off as much more of a high-velocity action-adventure than its predecessors.
Helmer Andy Fickman (who previously teamed with Johnson on 2007's "The Game Plan") puts the pedal to the metal in the opening moments, as U.S. military and intelligence types rush to secure the Nevada desert site where a UFO has apparently crash-landed. Right from the start, it's established that Burke (Ciaran Hinds), a Homeland Security agent, isn't there to roll out the welcome mat for "illegal aliens."
Meanwhile, off in nearby Las Vegas, ex-con cabbie Jack Bruno (Johnson) is trying to drive the straight and narrow path, despite efforts by mob goons to re-recruit him as a getaway driver. Fortuitously, Bruno picks up an attractive passenger, Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), an astrophysicist who just happens to be in town to lecture at a UFO conference (which is amusingly attended by role-playing, wardrobe-wearing sci-fi geeks). Bruno gruffly dismisses the "nutjobs" who believe in visitations by otherworldly beings. This, of course, sets him up for some ironic enlightenment.
The next day, Bruno picks up two other passengers who scour him free of skepticism. During a series of high-speed chases and hairbreadth escapes, Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig) gradually reveal themselves as extraterrestrial visitors who fell to earth aboard the UFO, which was seized by Burke's team and moved to a super-secret U.S. government installation hidden inside Witch Mountain.
The two human-looking teens are equipped with all manner of shape-shifting, mind-reading and telekinetic abilities, but they need Bruno's help to avoid capture by Burke and his heavily armed SWAT team -- and to avoid assassination by a Terminator-style hunter from their home planet.
"Race to Witch Mountain" strikes a deft balance of chase-movie suspense and wisecracking humor, with a few slam-bang action setpieces that would shame the makers of more allegedly grown-up genre fare. Fickman generously sprinkles witty wink-wink, nudge-nudge touches throughout, and the inevitable cameos by stars of the original "Witch Mountain" adventures, Kim Richards and Iake Eissinmann, are handled with sufficient finesse.
Script by Matt Lopez and Mark Bomback is unabashedly contrived, but the writers are clever enough to kid that contrivance. It may look and sound like a relationship-building throwaway bit, but the scene in which Bruno and Dr. Friedman discuss the ever-so-convenient coincidences that brought them together is self-referentially hilarious.
Johnson continues to flex his muscles as a charismatic screen presence, and here once again demonstrates his ego-free willingness to make himself the butt of jokes even as he does his derring-do.
Robb and Ludwig credibly suggest otherworldly temperaments without being too stiff about it, and Gugino is appealing as a standard-issue brainy beauty. Garry Marshall is the standout among the supporting players as a bestselling, surprisingly well-connected extraterrestrial expert who's greeted at the UFO convention as some kind of superstar (not unlike real-life author Whitley Strieber, who's fleetingly glimpsed among the conventioneers).
Special effects and other production values are first-class across the board, enabling auds to enjoy the pic as a serious sci-fi actioner as well as seriocomic family fare.
