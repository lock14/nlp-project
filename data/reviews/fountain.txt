Darren Aronofsky's "The Fountain" is a noble, shipwrecked folly: a passionately crafted meditation on love and human vanity that stars Hugh Jackman as a conquistador, a research scientist, and an interstellar holy man in a bubble with a tree. Not just any tree, mind you. The Tree of Life.
Does the movie work? Hardly, and yet the thing's alive with the urgency of its emotions. A throwback to the visionary personal filmmaking of the 1960s and early '70s, "The Fountain" represents the polar opposite of the big-box product Hollywood now feeds us.
Not surprisingly, it barely got made. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were originally slated to star in a $75 million version of the film back in 2002, but Pitt pulled out to make "Troy" after creative differences with Aronofsky. The director shrank the budget, cut sequences, recast with Jackman and his own fiancee , Rachel Weisz; the resulting film -- call it "The Fountain 2.0" -- at times plays like an epic in outline form. You can feel the missing material like a phantom limb.
The movie opens with a jolt, in the immediate aftermath of a massive, unseen 16th-century battle between Spanish warriors and Mayan defenders. The armored leader , Tomas (Jackman) , makes a desperate assault on the priestly pyramid in an effort to get at the holy mysteries beyond -- perhaps to the Fountain of Youth itself. The noise and the filmmaking here are fearsome, and it's almost as if the frame of the screen itself is buckling in on the conquistador.
Cut to the modern day, where time is running out for Dr. Tommy Creo (Jackman), whose wife , Izzi (Weisz) , is dying of cancer. Tommy works for a high-tech lab run by Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn), trying to make tumors in monkeys go away. In a flash of despairing improvisation, he injects a subject with an extract of the bark of a Guatemalan tree, and, lo, miraculous things begin happening. But not to Izzi, and, anyway, is life what she wants or is it just time with her work-obsessed husband?
And then we're 500 years, give or take, in the future, and Jackman is floating through space in a translucent sphere. He's bald and in the lotus position; his name is Tom, suggesting David Bowie's old runaway astronaut Major Tom, and he has pretty much set his controls for the heart of the sun.
Clearly, Aronofsky ("Pi," "Requiem for a Dream") has absorbed "2001: A Space Odyssey" at a molecular level. Just as clearly, he's a filmmaker of originality and genuine daring: the space scenes in "The Fountain" feel freshly minted from some common pan-spiritual consciousness. The 16th-century sequences are stiff and dreamlike; Weisz floats through them as a Queen Isabella reaching out to Tomas to save her country and herself. Clint Mansell's score, played by the Kronos Quartet, keens powerfully throughout.
As for the modern-day segments, Jackman convulses mightily to convince us of Tommy's great grief over his powerlessness -- he may actually do more acting here than in all his other films combined. Aronofsky turns his narrative triangle into three sides of a prism; the stories allude to each other and echo back and forth, and it seems as if you're always seeing through the nearest one into the others.
Yet for all the titanic passions clashing through "The Fountain," its message is fuzzy and thin. Men hector God and demand ever more. Women are accepting earth mothers. Love matters more than science. The movie wanders through these Big Ideas but shies from considering them at length; indeed, Aronofsky's directorial style -- a dazzling anti realism, heavy on the editing -- shuts deeper meaning out.
Instead, he has made a heroic poem that's stronger on hyperbole than lyricism. Bless him for that: If there were more Darren Aronofskys, the multiplex would be a stranger and better place. Flaws and all, "The Fountain" believes in itself more fervently than any other movie you may see this year -- so fervently it doesn't need an audience's faith to exist.


         Darren Aronofsky's "The Fountain" spans more than 1,000 years and feels as though it takes about that long to unfold. A metaphysical melodrama about the quest for eternal life, it makes a pretty decent case for euthanasia; here is what it's like to long for a swift, merciful end. Bloated and logy, and art-directed within an inch of its life, the movie shovels heaps of phony portent and all-purpose mystical imagery onto a thin and maudlin plot (think "Love Story" across time and space) in the hope that we'll mistake it for something deep. As pretentious as it is silly, "The Fountain" is just the type of impenetrable indulgence that gives the concept of personal artistic visions a bad name.
 
  The story begins in the 1500s, or seems to. Tomás (Hugh Jackman), a bellowing Spanish conquistador, is hacking his way through the Guatemalan jungle with his men when they are suddenly ambushed by Maya warriors. The fleeing soldiers are swiftly dispatched, but Tomás is taken to a temple, to be killed specially by the flaming sword of a warrior priest, just a few feet from the tree of life. The sword comes down, and Tomás, suddenly beardless and Gandhi-bald, floats up before the warrior in a bubble, calmly seated in the lotus position, and shoots off into space.
 


         






    What is going on? You may as well ask. In as much as it's about anything, "The Fountain" is about the many myths cultures have around the idea of eternal life. For the Spaniards, it was a fountain. For the Mayas, it was a tree. For the supranational, non-denominational yet vaguely Tibetan Buddhist seeming New Age Future Man, it's a murmuring, sighing, hairy tree on a small planet in outer space. You say tomato, I say tom-ah
-to.
 
  Up in Xibalba, the Maya afterworld that was believed to be located in a dying nebula, Tom Creo, medicine man of the future, carefully chips bark off a hairy, sighing tree and tattoos himself with a fountain pen.
 
  His labors are disturbed by the ghostly apparition of his wife (Rachel Weisz) in a fetching winter get-up. She wants him to "finish it." (By now, this sounds like a very good idea, whatever "it" is.) But Tom, clearly in torment, is too busy with the tree and the bark and the fountain pen to pay attention to his wife, even after her hospital bed makes an appearance. Whether this is the underworld, the afterlife, the future, the unconscious or a modern primitive version of "A Little Prince" is not entirely clear. But you get the sense that all bases are being covered, and that you'd do well to take notes.
 
  Which brings us to the main story. Tommy Creo (Jackman in floppy hair, no beard) is a brain surgeon/cancer researcher whose wife, Izzi (Weisz), is dying of a brain tumor. Despite his wife's best efforts, and the exhortations of his motherly boss, Dr. Lillian Guzzetti (Ellen Burstyn), Tom can't tear himself away from the lab even to take moonlight walks with his doomed beloved. He is working, we're meant to understand, on the cure that will save her — which accounts for his pissy behavior around the lab and his mopey demeanor at home. But the unintentional message is that while Izzi may be a perfect thing to idolize, she's kind of a pill to be around.
 
  Weisz is a wonderfully earthy actress, surprising, usually, for her blunt force and directness. But here she plays the vaguest of flaky feminine ideals. Izzi is one of those diaphanous martyrs, a beatific star-gazer with artistic inclinations, who is on the verge of completing (in longhand, mind you, with a fountain 
pen) her phantasy
 opus, called "The Fountain."
 
  The book is a mystical tale about a Queen Isabel of Spain (also Weisz), who, threatened by a crazed inquisitor, sends one of her conquistadors (Jackman, in full facial sprout) to the American jungles to discover the fountain of youth. Cue Jackman's beard, and some candlelit scenes in a Moorish castle where the queen is glimpsed through arabesque screens. Where's Ferdinand in all this? Who knows? Whatever history is alluded to in "The Fountain" is about as sound and grounded as its science. It has one interesting point to make — something about the connection between myths about eternal life and the agricultural cycles of death, decay and rebirth — but it takes altogether too long and expends far too many average art department budgets to make them.
 
  Things get especially weird when Tom Creo (time-traveler? space man? soul liberated from its body?) shoots through wormholes and gets bent out of shape at the edge of the space-time continuum. It looks like the trippiest yoga video you ever saw, or something out of "What the Bleep Do We Know?" But for all the fancy effects and the elaborate costuming, all I was left with — what with the tree, the sap, the soil and the regenerative powers of death and decay ("What if death were an act of creation?" flaky Izzi asks her brain surgeon husband) — is that it all comes down to fertilizer.
 
 
  MPAA rating: PG-13 for some intense sequences of violent action, some sexuality and language. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. In general release.   

It's no secret that The Fountain  is a difficult picture. The fits and starts of the movie's production were documented in EW a few weeks ago, and even a viewer plopped down with no knowledge of the labors to bring script to screen recognizes early on in the bewildering proceedings  when a 16th-century Spanish conquistador morphs into a present-day neurological scientist and then into a 26th-century spiritual cosmonaut, all of them played by Hugh Jackman with pleading eyes  that there's madness, or at least a formidably dense narrative tangle, afoot. The question a curious viewer must decide as centuries collide is whether to resist writer-director Darren Aronofsky's romantic, obsessive folly or to go with it.
I went with it, twice now, and I'm as touched and charmed by its failures (for clearly, in the murk and repetitiveness of his intricate, self-absorbed imagery, there is something troubling the maker of Pi  and Requiem for a Dream  that has eluded his solution) as I am transfixed, at times, by its successful inventiveness and audacity. There's something as recklessly okay about The Fountain  in its imperfection as there is something undeniably cockamamy; it's an entirely mood-dependent experience enhanced by identification with romantic/spiritual/kabbalistic/journal-or-blog-keeping tendencies of one's own, and ruined by impatience.
The triple-time explorer, called Tommy Creo in the present, sallies forth with one constant and its consequence, and that is the love of a beautiful woman (played by Aronofsky's real-life beloved, Rachel Weisz) and the quest to conquer death in order to be with her, always. Tommy (whose surname is Spanish, I believe, for ''I believe'') has a wife, Isabel, whom he calls Izzi (which is Brooklynese, I believe, for ''Is he or isn't he?''). Izzi is dying of a cancer that has reached her brain but left her alabaster skin radiant. Therefore the primate lab experiments Tommy and his research team are conducting are of particular urgency for the desperate husband; unexpected breakthroughs in anti-aging chemistry don't satisfy him if they don't also shrink tumors, and he butts heads with his lab boss, played (with her own fount of wisdom) by Requiem  veteran Ellen Burstyn. Meanwhile, backward in time, Tomas the Conquistador sets out to discover the Fountain of Youth on behalf of his adored queen (Weisz again, in royal gowns), who is herself threatened by enemies. And in the future, Tom, the spiritual seeker with a head as bald and calm as that of Mr. Clean, floats in a translucent bubble looking for a reunion with his lost beloved, and a kind of eternal, wrinkle-free bliss.
In all three guises, from past hirsute to future hairless, Jackman beams a handsome earnestness of such uncomplicated trust in the depth of the filmmaker's philosophizing that it's hard to imagine what Brad Pitt, the originally scheduled Tomas/Tommy/Tom, would have done to convey the same passion of purpose. Licked his lips, cocked his hip, and varied his stubble?
The filmmaker is enthralled by texture. The Fountain  often looks like velvet feels, and the whole thing, set to an ethereal score by Clint Mansell, is shot by cinematographer Matthew Libatique in a rich, chocolate light that makes a primal jungle booby-trapped with savage natives and even a sterilized science lab look dreamy, as if life is lived in a perpetual nighttime. In one particularly sensual visual repetition, tiny, breathing hairs on the bark of the fabulous Tree of Life (Real? Symbolic? Let a hundred creation myths guide each viewer's answer) rise up erotically to the touch, just as Tommy is stirred by the hair at the back of his sleeping wife's neck.
The director stages a couple of scenes with obsessive opulence. A jungle skirmish approaches the grandeur of an Indiana Jones epic, while even Tommy and Izzi's home  a way station in the story, hardly a destination  is crammed with mood, detail, and a hint of Moulin Rouge  decor to impress and distract the student who ventures to unsnarl the knotted strands of logic and faith that choke this Fountain . I'm not convinced Aronofsky makes a compelling, time-shifting explanation for the human hunger for eternal life when the present with a loved one is gift enough, but I'm perfectly content to float with him even if he doesn't solve the riddles of the universe.

 In “The Fountain,” Darren Aronofsky’s third feature (after “Pi” and “Requiem for a Dream”), Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play star-crossed lovers in three different eras. Back in the 16th century, Ms. Weisz is Queen Isabel, a glowingly beautiful monarch menaced by the cruel intolerance of the Spanish Inquisition. (I know, I didn’t suspect it either.) Mr. Jackman is Tomas, a conquistador of sad countenance and unruly beard, hacking his way through the Central American jungles in search of the Tree of Life and in the service of his queen.  In the present, Mr. Jackman is a clean-shaven research scientist named Tom Creo, obsessively trying to develop a cure for the disease that threatens the life of his glowingly beautiful wife, Izzi (Ms. Weisz). Five hundred years in the future, Tom’s head is completely bald, and he floats through the air. Ms. Weisz, if I’m not mistaken, has turned into a tree.  The three stories are not told in linear order, but in a circular, swirling pattern that suggests a mandala or a Mayan calendar. Circles also figure prominently in Mr. Aronofsky’s visual scheme, and he seems to be trying, with a seriousness of purpose that few American filmmakers attempt, to subvert the essentially sequential nature of film. Like a story by Jorge Luis Borges, “The Fountain” dispenses with everyday assumptions about time, space and causality and tries to replace the prose of narrative cinema with a poetic language of rhyming images and visual metaphors.  I wish I could say that it succeeded. At his best — which is to say as a maker of gorgeous, haunting compositions (exquisitely rendered in Matthew Libatique’s cinematography)  — Mr. Aronofsky can achieve an eloquence that suggests a blend of Andrei Tarkovsky (speaking of rhymes) and comic books. But his commitment to conveying meaning and emotion through painstakingly constructed images also gives the movie a static, claustrophobic atmosphere. (When Queen Isabel notes that “these are dark times,” she seems to be commenting mainly on the relentless chiaroscuro of the lighting design.)    The director gives his main actors very little to do. Since their job is to embody a paradoxical romantic axiom — lovers may die, but love never does — they are trapped within a narrow range of emotions. Ms. Weisz’s role is to glow and sigh, while Mr. Jackman registers various forms of anguish and desperation. The intensity of their feeling never breaks the surface, and the frame encases them like a vitrine. It’s hard to sympathize with their hunger to overcome death, since neither one is credibly alive to begin with.  Entwined with their thousand-year melodrama is quite a bit of strenuous ideamongering, having to do with the quest for eternal life and its consequences, and also with the tension between science and art. Tom Creo (the last name means “I believe” in Spanish) rages in the lab, bullying his subordinates and exasperating his supervisor (Ellen Burstyn) with his insistence on going after the secret of immortality rather than a mere cure for disease. Izzi, meanwhile, may have unlocked the secret herself, in a manuscript she has been working on (by hand, on old-fashioned folio pages) called “The Fountain.” “Finish it,” she says to Tom.  She also tells him about Xibalba, the Mayan afterlife, a swirling vortex where all distinctions of present and past seem to vanish. Xibalba, which is also the name of a distant nebula in the movie,  is connected to that tree, which is, according to the movie’s dream logic, both a metaphor and an actual organism. (It is also, a bit misleadingly, the source of the film’s title: fountain of youth, tree of life — same thing, really). It is where superstition and science meet, and where the truth of ancient religion is affirmed by the methods of modern science.  I think so, at any rate. To his credit, Mr. Aronofsky does not explain too much, and “The Fountain” leaves a tantalizing sense of puzzlement in its wake. Parsing its logic and arguing about its premises will be among the main activities of the small, devoted cult of admirers that is likely to gather around this movie, protecting it from the derision of the uninitiated. The problem, though, is that its techniques run too far beyond its ideas, which are blurry and banal, rather than mysterious and resonant. “The Fountain” is something to see, but it is also much less, finally, than meets the eye.  “The Fountain” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some gory combat scenes and some sexual activity in a bathtub.

Backburnered four years ago after original star Brad Pitt pulled out, then long in the making, "The Fountain," third feature by one-time wunderkind Darren Aronofsky ("Pi," "Requiem for a Dream"), made more of a splatter than a splash on Venice's Lido with its world premiere. Greeted by booing at its first press unspooling, pic's hippy trippy space odyssey-meets-contempo-weepy-meets-conquistador caper starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz suffers from a turgid script and bears all the signs of edit-suite triage to produce a still-incoherent 95 minutes. A gush of negative word of mouth will keep B.O. figures at a trickle.
Overpraised for the then-hip, now-dated use of pseudo-science in "Pi," and for the visual excess he deployed in the grungy "Requiem," helmer Aronofsky has been attached to and then detached from various big-budget studio projects over the last few years, including "Batman Begins" and "The Watchman." "The Fountain," written by Aronofsky and based on a story by him and Ari Handel, shows onscreen all the wear and tear of a personal project that has suffered from production fits and starts and reportedly has been cut down from a longer running time to a still tedious and repetitious hour and a half.
Plot interleaves three stories in different time frames and switches throughout somewhat abruptly between them, although auds can parse which is going on when by paying attention to how much hair Jackman is sporting at any given time.
In the 16th century, a bearded and long-locked Jackman plays Spanish explorer Tomas, dispatched by Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz) to the New World to find the biblical Tree of Life, whose sap bestows immortality. In Central America, Tomas must battle mutinous underlings and assorted growling, war-painted Mayan extras to get to a pyramid that hides the tree, whose powers produce floral special effects Tomas wasn't expecting.
Turns out the latter storyline is the plot of "The Fountain," a novel being written in cursive hand in the present, or near-present by Izzi (Weisz again) who is married to Tommy (Jackman again, this time sans beard). Izzi has a terminal brain tumor, for which Tommy is working full-out to find a cure via experimental surgery on monkeys, assisted by a team of gowned-and-masked, personality-free supporting actors.
Only other character to make much of an impact is Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn, the lead in "Requiem"), the head of the research facility, who is wheeled on from time to time to warn Tommy he's working too hard and getting sloppy. Compound extracted from a Guatemalan tree may offer a cure or at least some kind of miraculous healing power.
Last plot strand shows a now-completely bald Jackman, called Tom Creo per press notes, living inside a clear bubble traveling through space toward the Xibalba nebula, an astrological body believed by the Mayans to be the location of the underworld.
Supposedly, it's the 26th century, and Creo's craft is driven merely by mind-power -- or, perhaps more precisely, screenwriter's whimsy. His only company is a nearly dead tree from whose bark he gains sustenance, while he spends his days reliving memories from the 21st century of Izzi, and occasionally levitating around in the lotus position.
Visual effects, credited to a slew of different companies, are indeed striking with their nearly 3-D layers of golden haze. However, segment ultimately looks like a remake of the wormhole section of "2001: A Space Odyssey," as produced by makers of instructional videos for beginning yoga students.
More problematic is the fact that it's hard to muster much engagement with characters who are so sketchily drawn. Izzi, for instance, is little more than a beatifically smiling presence. Weisz admittedly looks cute and pixie-like with a short-cropped hairdo, but Aronofsky hasn't given his now real-life partner much of a role. Charismatic Jackman (and his chiseled cheekbones) does his best to carry the film through its many lulls, but it feels like a lot of time is spent watching him cry or trashing offices in frustration.
No doubt the filmmakers' intention was to celebrate a love that transcends centuries, hence repeated use of lines, scenes and motifs. In the end, however, the effect is just monotonous, especially given overuse of Clint Mansell's mournful orchestral score, slathered over scenes as if in hopes it will paper over the plot's cracks.
Nevertheless, with savvy marketing "The Fountain" might yet find a niche audience, especially with softer-hearted femme viewers who will groove to the pick's rich costumes and honeyed tones.

Solemn, flashy, and flabbergasting, The Fountain adapted by Darren Aronofsky  from his own graphic novelshould really be called The Shpritz . The premise is lachrymose, the sets are clammy, and the metaphysics all wet. The screen is awash in spiraling nebulae and misty points of light, with the soundtrack supplying appropriately moist oohs and aahs.
The Fountain  is an exercise in pulp mysticism that, overflowing with ponderous enigmas, universal patterns, and eternalrecurrences, touches all bases in its first few minutes. An opening invocation of Genesis and a close-up of a golden cross segue to a crib from the sacred text, Raiders of the Lost Ark : A fiery Spanish conquistador (Hugh Jackman ) is trapped by a horde of growling natives in a jungle cul-de-sac; he escapes by climbing a sacred pyramid to go mano a mano with their flaming high priest. There's a cosmic cutin the film. Now a bald astronaut who travels in a full lotus position, Jackman wakes up screaming across the snow-globe universe.
Not nearly as pleasurably tacky as a description might make it sound, Aronofsky's historical phantasmagoria jumps among three time zones. There's the 16th-century derring-do in which Rachel Weisz 's glamorous Queen Isabella  sends Jackman's conquistador to find the Tree of Life and bring back the Sap of Immortality. There's a present-day melodrama in which Weisz appears as the free-spirited Izzi, dying of brain cancer while her renegade medical-researcher spouse Tom (Jackman) races against time to create a cure. Adding to the mystery, Izzi is writing a novel called The Fountain , which is actually the conquistador story and which she begs her husband to complete. (The movie's most impressive special effect is this leather-bound tome written entirely in longhand without a single blotch, erasure, or correction.) Finally and least explicably, there's Tom's 26th-century astral projection.
Izzi who? Are you what? Together these avatars gaze at the Mayan death star, sit beneath the world-tree Yggsdrasil, and make love in a cozy bathtub. Weisz, the auteur's own inamorata, is accorded many close-ups. She's able to carry them, smiling bravely through the tears and claptrap. For his part, Jackman plays Dr. Tom at his most Wolverine-isha perfectly grizzled, broodingly ungracious loner given to explosions of sour petulance. At one point, he instructs his nonplussed research team to "stop agingstop dying, that's our goal." (And create democracy in Iraq  while you're at it.) Ellen Burstyn , a graduate of Aronofsky's 2000 skagfest Requiem for a Dream , appears as Tom's ineffectually scolding, but secretly loving, supervisor.
Part fairy tale, part weepy, part frustrated bodice-ripper, and part film-loop in which beatific Izzi invites distracted Tom for a walk (and is grouchily turned down) six times, The Fountain  is a movie that prefers celestial whiteouts to prosaic fades and, when it comes to visual emphasis, privileges the overhead zoom above all. It's as busy as the hotel lobby that seemingly served as the decorating model for Tom's lab. By the time the hero's 26th-century self levitates through the deliquescing woods between the worlds and the layers of the cosmic onion to the golden birth canal, Izzi's injunction to "finish it" has taken on a new, and not particularly occult, meaning.
What The Fountain  lacks in coherence it makes up in ambition. Aronofsky has not only aspired to make the most strenuously far-out movie of the 21st century, but the greatest love story ever told. Lest anyone imagine The Fountain  to have been written by Madonna's kabbalah teacher after a week pondering El Topo and dancing to the Incredible String Band, the words "By Darren Aronofsky" are twice inscribed during the final credits. The third inscription will reveal itself in 500 years.
