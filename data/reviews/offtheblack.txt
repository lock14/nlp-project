         The gentle drama "Off the Black" takes its title from baseball jargon describing a pitch just off the plate, but despite its frame of reference, the movie is really about the complex relationships that plague fathers and sons. Nick Nolte stars as Ray Cook, a man in late middle age who has slid to the fringes of society, connected to others only through his work as a high school umpire, and even then it's from behind a mask.
 
 A controversial call in a key game and an act of vandalism introduces Ray to Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a 17-year-old pitcher. The pair's uneasy relationship gradually grows to genuine affection and it's to the film's credit that whenever it veers toward schmaltz, writer-director James Ponsoldt guides it in a slightly different direction.
 


         






   Dave's father (Timothy Hutton) is a veritable somnambulist, a wreck since his wife left two years earlier, and Ray's elderly father (Michael Higgins) suffers from Alzheimer's disease. A more conventional film would view Ray and Dave as men seeking surrogates, but "Off the Black" allows them a looser, less hierarchical bond. Though Ray bestows life lessons based on stories of obscure ballplayers, they're handled in an easygoing manner that's never heavy-handed.
 
 Ponsoldt allows the story to progress unhurriedly as Dave begins to see Ray as a more interesting figure than the "whack job" he first encounters. Even though we've seen Nolte play this type of shambling curmudgeon before, he's seldom filled a character with such empathy. "Off the Black" is a modest, bittersweet character study that hits its mark.

We haven't heard much from Nick Nolte since he took that wild 2002 Hawaiian-shirt mug shot. Off the Black  proves he's still a great leading actor. Rumpled, growly, and probably purposely invoking his tabloid past, Nolte plays an always-drunken small-town umpire who befriends the teen ballplayer who TPs his house. Sucking at the top of many a can, and greedily slurping the sides of an overflowing bottle, Nolte gives a master class in how to drink a beer on screen. The rest of his work here is sad, understated, and worth seeking out.

 In “Off the Black” Nick Nolte dives beneath the blubber to bare the weary soul of Ray Cook, an automobile junkyard operator pushing 60 who also umpires high-school baseball games. A heaving wreck of a man, Ray lives alone in a seedy cottage near a railroad track and drinks himself into a stupor each night in front of the television.  Although he leaves Post-it messages in the refrigerator reminding himself to keep to a three-beer limit, he is incapable of following his own rules. In more sober moments he videotapes himself recounting the day’s activities for a diary. As he leaves a medical examination, his doctor throws up his hands in frustration; he wouldn’t know where to begin operating. We get the message: Ray’s days are numbered.  “Off the Black,” the feature-film debut of the director James Ponsoldt, tells the formulaic story of Ray’s last hurrah, in which he blackmails a teenager into posing as his son and accompanying him to his 40th high-school reunion. As he and the pretender, Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), go through the ritual, Mr. Nolte’s craggy face and phlegmy growl register every seismic rumble of Ray’s troubled psyche. And he and Mr. Morgan (likeably fresh but far from dewy-eyed) sustain a convincing rapport.  This modest film could easily have skidded into the mawkish marshland where countless mentor-protégé, father-son dramas have suffocated. But for the most part it steers away from the worst clichés of that tear-drenched genre.  Ray and Dave first cross paths in a male version of meeting cute. Umpiring a ballgame in which Dave is pitching, Ray makes a critical call that walks a batter who scores the winning run. (The title “Off the Black” refers to a pitch that just misses the strike zone.) In revenge Dave and two teammates vandalize Ray’s property, strewing the trees with toilet paper, scrawling graffiti on the pavement outside the house and breaking one of his car windows.  As they flee, Ray wakes from his haze, grabs a gun and rushes outside, where he catches Dave and drags him into the house. Once they calm down, the frightened boy agrees to clean up the mess if Ray doesn’t call the police.  As Dave undoes the damage, the two become acquainted, and Ray develops enough of a liking for the vandal to take him fishing on the local river (the movie was filmed in upstate New York) and to offer him fishy advice. (“If you haven’t fished, you don’t know anything about women.”)  The movie follows Dave into his own troubled home where his father, a professional photographer (Timothy Hutton in an underwritten role), has been depressed since his wife left two years earlier. Frustratingly, the movie offers no explanation of why she left.  Dave’s family history is only one of several plot strands that seem as if they might have been edited out of the movie. Dave also has an uneasy relationship with his younger sister (but why?) and develops a flirtatious friendship with a single mother (Rosemarie DeWitt) who is a friend of Ray’s (but how good a friend and from where?). As a rehearsal for the reunion, Ray drags Dave to a hospital to visit Ray’s father (Michael Higgins), who has Alzheimer’s, and play the old man’s grandson; Dave passes the test.  “Off the Black” is so much Mr. Nolte’s movie that it couldn’t exist without him. His character is the latest in a long line of Hemingway-esque ruins, marinated in beer and testosterone, who have become Mr. Nolte’s specialty.  As fond as he is of these guys, Mr. Nolte has the wisdom and acting smarts not to sentimentalize them. In these roles you often have the sense of this wonderful actor casting a pitiless, smirking gaze into the mirror as he contemplates his own decaying magnificence.  “Off the Black” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some profanity.

Stepping up to bat for the first time, scribe-helmer James Ponsoldt hits a solid single with "Off the Black." Anchored by a terrific performance from Nick Nolte as a grizzled umpire who gets an unexpected second chance at fatherhood, this easygoing comedy-drama plays out slowly but assuredly, infusing a conventional story about a blossoming relationship with welcome reserves of honesty and humor. Modesty and familiarity of the material might stand in the way of a larger audience, but few who see it will leave wholly unaffected.
As was once stated in a memorable episode of "I Love Lucy," nobody loves the ump -- the ump in this case being gruff, hard-drinking Ray Cook (Nolte), who finds his house vandalized one night. Ray manages to collar one of the perps, high school baseball player Dave (Trevor Morgan, "Mean Creek"), whose team recently lost thanks to one of the umpire's close calls. A troubled but fundamentally decent kid, Dave starts coming by every afternoon to slowly clean up the damage.
Ray is obviously lonely -- he spends a lot of time shooting personal video diaries, talking mainly about baseball in words that ache with regret -- and it's revealed early on that he's also terminally ill. Dave is close to his younger sister (Sonia Feigelson), but their father (Timothy Hutton) has become distant and uncommunicative in the years since their mother abandoned them.
When Ray suddenly offers to erase the boy's debt if he will escort him to his 40th high school reunion pretending to be his son, Dave initially freaks out, then reluctantly agrees. What starts off as a business transaction ever so gradually becomes something more, with fishing trips, nights spent chatting on the porch, and (although one of them is underage) frequent guzzling of beer.
It's one of the strengths of Ponsoldt's fine script that neither Ray's cancer nor Dave's parent issues take center stage as they would in a less confident, more melodramatic piece of work. Nor is their surrogate father-son bond seriously meant to compete with Dave's relationship to his biological dad (who meets Ray only once, in a scene that's wisely played for laughs). Instead, pic offers a balanced, bittersweet picture of a symbiotic connection that leaves both better equipped to relate to those around them.
Reducing his voice to an emphysemic growl and frequently slurring his speech, Nolte is toweringly funny as a sad-sack curmudgeon who, for all his ills, never becomes pathetic. The vet thesp harmonizes beautifully with Morgan, who imbues Dave with a starry-eyed sadness and maturity beyond his years.
Ponsoldt rushes nothing, letting every interaction play itself out and allowing the precisely calibrated acting and dialogue to determine the pacing. Helmer's style is sometimes too generous, accommodating side characters -- including an attractive single mom (Rosemarie DeWitt) and Ray's own Alzheimer's-stricken father (Michael Higgins) -- who serve no obvious narrative function but add humanity and texture nonetheless.
Though it's grounded in the mundane, pic is beautifully lensed by Tim Orr ("Undertow"), who once again displays an appreciative eye for the beauty and tranquility of nature.

Movie actors of Nick Nolte 's clout (and gender) get to decide right down to the last wrinkle and half-ounce of muscle or flab how they want to age on-screen. Nolte, weary and grizzled even in his youth, seems to have been prepping for his twilight days since he was 35 in 1976.
That was the year the gruff-voiced, prematurely weathered Nebraska  native and college football stud slouched toward stardom in the soap miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man playing the poor man, naturally. From there, the physical and psychic poundings of Vietnam  (Who'll Stop the Rain ) and the pro ball gridiron (North Dallas Forty ) swiftly supplied the young actor with the limp, the growl, and the short fuse he needed to portray what would become his characteristic theme: the merciless ravages of experience upon the male body and spirit. Now, at 65, he needs only his ageand his integrityto achieve hunched realism rather than aerobicized, plasticized uplift.
Near the end of Off the Black , a disarmingly droll and insightful indie in which Nolte plays a high school baseball umpire and failed dad, there's a short scene of his character Ray Cook  straining once more to wriggle his abundant girth into the ump's uniform. Nolte, never to be mistaken for Heath Ledger , dares to appear naked in this scene, and it doesn't look as though there's a single stretch of toned tissue on his entire bodywhich is no small measure of the shape he's in as an actor. Where most sexagenarian starsHarrison Ford  (64), Michael Douglas  (62), and Sylvester Stallone  (60) among themwill do anything to show they can still crack the whip or get it up or at least get in the ring for one more round, Nolte is a lot more interested in showing that he can't , that the battered body (or mind) simply won't allow it. If Rocky Balboa  , opening later this month, is an absurdist fantasy of senior-age machismo, Off the Blacknamed for the pitch that narrowly misses the markcomes infinitely closer to the reality of exhausted masculinity. It's a ninth-inning movie wherein the ump's only triumph is another brutally honest call.
The first of these unpopular decisions"ball four"is issued, in Nolte's patented rasp, at the start of the film. The crestfallen pitcher is Dave (Trevor Morgan ), a sad-eyed, shaggy-haired 17-year-old in a small industrial town who comes to the crotchety ump's house at night with two friends, some toilet paper, and a brick. Old Ray, whose fridge tellingly sports a yellow Post-it note that reads "3 beer limit," pulls a gun on the fleeing trio's straggling member, peels off the kid's ski mask to discover a flipped-out Dave, and seizes an opportunity to put the young pitcher to work as an indentured servant. Ray toys with young Dave like a cat swatting a mouse, forcing him to do mundane physical labor as penance for trespassing and vandalism. But the relationship expands to include the occasional fishing excursion and adventure in over-limit brewsky swilling. Dave even agrees to attend Ray's 40-year high school reunion, posing as his son in order for the ump to look, or perhaps feel, accomplished.
This old-lion-bonds-with-young-buck material sounds a mite facile and formulaic in description, but Off the Black , written and directed by James Ponsoldt , reveals its relevant details slowly and cautiouslyas men of any age generally do. As in Affliction , another Nolte-driven study of masculinity, the awkwardness of the men's attempts at emotional expression appears inherited. "What did he do?" Ray asks Dave, referring to his old man. "Nothing" is the aptly clipped reply. For his part, Ray is doubly afflicted: Neither his long-estranged son nor his Alzheimer's-suffering dad (Michael Higgins ) is able to swing at the ump's humorously desperate conversational pitches.
Off the Black  belongs on the shelf beside recent peers Spring Forward  and Old Joy ; it's not as deep or resonant as those two, but despite extraneous supporting characters (i.e., women), it's likewise concerned with lamenting, and dare we say expanding the limitations of men's communication skills. Here both umpire and actor call 'em as they see 'em.
