Of all the actors who have taken up the dare of playing Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz may be the first who has truly nailed him in body, spirit, and gesture. Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall , a war epic produced in Germany, is set during the final implosion of the Nazi regime. At its heart is a staggeringly elaborate, full-scale re-creation of Hitler's final 12 days in the vast and winding concrete bunker under the chancellery in Berlin. As the Russians close in on the city, Ganz stalks through the underground hideaway like a man dispatched to hell before his time. His hand held rigid yet trembling behind him, he pores over maps, convinced the German forces have let him down but that they'll be launching themselves toward victory at any moment.
Ganz offers a queasy evocation of the courtly side of Hitler: the smiling baby cheeks, the eyes that could glow with personable sweetness when he was around women or children. But then the actor lets his voice rise into seething, spitting arias of rage, much as Hitler did at the climax of his speeches. It helps that Ganz is speaking German: He turns the language's thrashing, bombastic percussiveness into a living soundtrack of violence. Yet the effect is far different in private: a neurosis inflated into a worldview. The Führer can't believe  can't take in the reality  that his war, his crusade, is over. Downfall  dramatizes how Hitler tapped the gnashing urge of his anger and built it into a force field, shutting out all that he didn't want to see.
If I respect Downfall  more than I was enthralled by it, that's because its portayal stops short of revelation. Once you witness Hitler's denial, the film has little more to say about him. That may be why, at two hours and 35 minutes, it feels far too long. The moment of Hitler's greatest vulnerability  his double suicide with Eva Braun  occurs off camera. What did he say just before he pulled the trigger? Missing from Downfall  is a vision of this ultimate murderer's relationship to death.

According to "Downfall," one of the last meals Adolf Hitler ate before he killed himself in his Berlin bunker was ravioli. Cheese, of course, for as this painstaking (and sometimes painful) film reminds us, the F�hrer did not eat meat. Apparently, he enjoyed the ravioli, complimenting the cook who made it and cleaning his plate while his dinner companions, who included his secretary, Traudl Junge, and his lover, Eva Braun, were too preoccupied to do much more than pick at their food and smoke cigarettes. Their distraction is understandable. The Soviet Army was a few blocks away, and the once-fearsome Nazi military machine had all but collapsed. Hitler's calm demeanor may have been a sign of his own increasingly demented state, as, at least in the movie's rendition of his last days, it came between bouts of raving paranoia and delusional schemes to revive his shattered armies to fight off the advancing Allied forces. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, "Downfall" shifts its gaze back and forth between the crumbling military situation on the ground in Berlin and the bizarre domestic situation in the bunker underneath it, combining high wartime drama with a sense of mundane detail that verges on the surreal. It is fascinating without being especially illuminating, and it holds your attention for its very long running time without delivering much dramatic or emotional satisfaction in the end. At times the German movie, which is one of five finalists for the Academy Award for best foreign film, has the self-conscious intimacy of a behind-the-scenes celebrity portrait. More often, it has the starchy staginess of one of those made-for-cable historical dramas that give actors of reputation (usually British) the chance to put on vintage uniforms and impersonate figures of world-historical importance, either monstrous or heroic. Bruno Ganz, the fine Swiss-born actor who, in the course of a long career, has tended more toward world-weariness than monstrosity, tackles the biggest monster of them all with appropriate sobriety and a touch of mischief. He does some scenery chewing, and while he looks, at 64, older than Hitler did at 56 (and also kindlier), he has clearly studied Hitler's vocal and physical mannerisms closely. The challenge Mr. Ganz faces, which Mr. Hirschbiegel, working from a screenplay by Bernd Eichinger, does not quite allow him to meet, is to make Hitler a plausible character without quite humanizing him. To play Hitler is to walk into a paradox. Sixty years after the end of World War II, he continues to exert a powerful fascination: we still want to understand not just the historical background of German National Socialism, but also the psychological and temperamental forces that shaped its leader. At the same time, though, there is still a powerful taboo against making him seem too much like one of us. We want to get close, but not too close. A few years ago, Menno Meyjes's "Max," a flawed but not dishonorable attempt to explore Hitler's earlier life as a failed artist in Vienna, was widely criticized (often by people who had not seen it) for giving him too much humanity. Curiosity carries with it a sense of moral risk, as if understanding Hitler might be the fateful first step toward liking him. But of course, millions of Germans - most of them ordinary and, in their own minds, decent people - loved Hitler, and it is that fact that most urgently needs to be understood, and that most challenges our own complacency. Accordingly, the real subject of "Downfall," Mr. Ganz's intriguing, creepily charismatic performance notwithstanding, is not Hitler at all, but rather his followers: the officers, bureaucrats and loyal civilians who were with him at the end. Some of these are well known, like Eva Braun (Juliane K�hler), the architect Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) and Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes), who died, along with his wife, Magda (Corinna Harfouch), and their six children, in the bunker with their leader. Other people who figure in this story - which manages to be at once sprawling and claustrophobic - are lesser officers in the SS, and members of Hitler's bodyguard and household staff, including Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara).  

Not so much a Hitler movie as a portrait of a totalitarian machine's spiritual and emotional collapse, "Downfall" is a cumulatively powerful Goetterdammerung
 centered on the last 10 days of the bunkered Fuehrer and those around him. Headlined by a tightly-wound, pugnacious perf from Swiss actor Bruno Ganz as Hitler, but with a roster of thesps reading like an A-Z of the German industry, pic will undoubtedly raise discussion in some quarters for its coolly objective, humanistic approach to the characters and subject-matter. But as thoughtful entertainment, cast in depth and going for the long burn, this is classy upscale fare.
World-preemed at the Toronto fest Sept. 14, and opening in Deutschland two days later, subtitled 2�-hour pic still remains a tricky theatrical proposition, despite its merits, outside German-speaking territories. However, strong critical support could generate some biz as a niche attraction, with small-screen sales down the line.
Scripted and produced by Munich-based vet Bernd Eichinger, this is the first German movie to tackle the subject head-on since G.W. Pabst's B&W "Der letzte Akt" (1956), with legit actor Albin Skoda as Hitler but largely shown through the eyes of an ordinary soldier played by Oskar Werner. Film comes at a timely moment, when fascination with the period and the Third Reich in general is experiencing a renaissance. Indeed, "Downfall" plays as a bigscreen, dramatized accompaniment to "Blind Spot," Austrian helmer Andre Heller's controversial 2002 docu interview with Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge (nee Humps).
Junge's published memoir, along with Third Reich scholar Joachim Fest's recent tome, "Inside Hitler's Bunker," formed the basis of Eichinger's script. And with her real voice bookending the movie, it's Junge who remains the audience's entree into the inner circles of absolute power, as well as being the main avenue for understanding Hitler's powerful allure with ordinary Germans.
Played with a nice blend of star-struck innocence and fresh-faced shyness by Alexandra Maria Lara ("The Tunnel," "Naked"), that sets her apart from the rest of the monomaniacal or conflicted characters, Traudl is first seen, in a brief prologue, as a nervous 22-year-old applicant for the job of Hitler's private secretary in November '42. When she gets the job, she shrieks for joy.
Film charts the last 10 days of Hitler's life, from his 56th birthday April 20, 1945, to his suicide April 30, but with a substantial final act focusing on the suicide of Goebbels and his family, plus Traudl's escape from the city.
Hunched, bleary-eyed and mimicking an Austrian accent thicker than fondue, Ganz understandably dominates every scene he's in, whether railing against international Jewry, the feebleness of the German people or daily small betrayals. Though sometimes over-cooked -- especially compared with the reined-back style of the rest of the cast -- Ganz's playing, especially in quieter moments, is a commanding stab at (without offering any fresh insights into) a character who is effectively impossible to do justice to, as a human being, on screen.
Main surprise is that pic isn't just a one-man show, unlike previous tries such as the more movie-movie Alec Guinness starrer "Hitler: The Last Ten Days" (1973). Despite plunging immediately in medias res
, as Berlin becomes a front-line city and Reich honchos urge Hitler to flee, film succinctly and clearly intros a raft of characters, developing them in parallel with Hitler himself. It's a tribute to Eichinger's script and Hirschbiegel's unshowy, slightly TV-ish helming (similar to his local hit, "The Experiment") that, when Hitler dies some 40 minutes before the end, there are still enough important characters to keep the drama rolling.
Film feels impeccably researched -- especially Bernd Lepel's reconstruction, in a Munich studio, of the warren-like Bunker, all gray, functional concrete bizarrely decorated with paintings, household furniture and occasional carpeting.
Pic avoids being plastered, docudrama-style, with distracting datelines, allowing the human drama to take center stage. Flashes of understated humor, such as the bunker's occupants clandestinely lighting up out of sight of non-smoking veggie Hitler, add further character color.
Apart from a couple of miscalculated exceptions, pic eschews developing subplots of "ordinary" folk as emotional hooks into the larger drama. The historical characters are the drama here, and, as portrayed by German actors from an unsentimental, German perspective -- think Josef Vilsmaier's "Stalingrad" (1991) for emotional tone -- this is the wellspring from which pic draws its slow-burning power.
Late in arriving but maintaining the dramatic momentum after Ganz's exit, Corinna Harfouch is aces as Goebbels' wife Magda, an icily elegant woman who, in one of the most chilling sequences, calmly poisons her six young children while Goebbels himself (Ulrich Matthes, ironically the anti-Nazi Catholic priest in Volker Schlondorff's recent "The Ninth Day") waits silently, almost dumbstruck, in a corridor outside. It's the most commanding distaff perf in the picture, with Juliane Koehler ("Aimee & Jaguar," "Nowhere in Africa") having more screen time but much less to work with as party-girl lightweight Eva Braun.
Rest of the male leads ooze physical presence, with Heino Ferch a standout as loyal but smart architect Albert Speer and Michael Mendl as a tough, no-nonsense military commander. Among the large number of smaller supports Goetz Otto brings a businesslike dedication to the role of personal adjutant Guensche, entrusted with torching Hitler and Braun's corpses.
Overground sequences of street-fighting, and senseless military discipline by Germans against Germans, are grittily staged and sonically arresting, with St. Petersburg locations doing convincing duty as Berlin. Rainer Klausmann's largely handheld (though smooth) lensing goes for matte colors, dominated by grays and olive greens, with a natural-light look. Stephan Zacharias' quiet score is supportive rather than descriptive, his serene, chordal music bringing an extra chill to the final murders and suicides.
A detailed postscript notes what happened to the main characters, with a surprising number living until fairly recently. (Traudl herself died in February, 2002, hours after the preem of "Blind Spot" at the Berlin fest.)

With Berlin  in ruins and the Red Army advancing, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels  promised his colleagues that "in a hundred years' time they will be showing a fine color film of the terrible days we are living through" and asked if they wouldn't want to play a part in it. Downfall  is that fine color movieopening here 40 years ahead of Goebbels's schedule. Confined for two and a half hours almost entirely to the vast and fusty führerbunker , Oliver Hirschbiegel 's apocalyptic kammerspiel  is notable as the first mainstream German, if not German-language, movie to represent Adolf Hitler played with acrid grandeur by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz . (G.W. Pabst 's 1955 The Last Ten Days , not to be confused with the 1973 Alec Guinness  vehicle HitlerThe Last Ten Days , is Austrian; Hans-Jürgen Syberberg 's monumental Hitler, a Film From Germany  and Alexander Sokurov 's monumentally strange Moloch , a Russian-German co-production, are from Mars.) That novelty aside, Downfall  holds few surprises. In essence, the script was written in 1947 when British intelligence officer Hugh Trevor-Roper  published The Last Days of Hitler a hugely successful book that, along with Albert Speer 's Nuremberg  testimony, served as the basis for all subsequent accounts of the Nazi götterdämmerung.
Downfall  garners additional human interest, however, by taking its cues from the 2002 documentary Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary , an extended interview with the princess of the bunker steno pool, Traudl Junge . The actual Junge is heard introducing Downfall . The movie dramatizes her audition for the job as Hitler's secretary andas played by Alexandra Maria Lara the movie's key observer, then jumps ahead to April 1945, as the führer prepares to celebrate his 56th birthday with Russian artillery pulverizing Berlin. (Ironically, these scenes were shot in the streets of St. Petersburg .)
Children defend the city, Himmler is trying to cut a deal with Eisenhower, and Hitler is irritable to the point of mania. His consort, the effervescent, if not hysterical, Eva Braun  (Juliane Köhler ), wants to party, but Hitler would rather see everyone dead. He rants, raves, and orders the impossible, babbling about lost oil fields, bragging how he openly confronted the Jews, and insulting his generals as "the scum of the German people." When not paranoid or delusional, he hands out cyanide pellets and, one hand twitching behind his back, discusses the best way to die.
Increasingly stooped and saggy, Ganz looks like a melting waxwork amid the bunker's moldy furnishings. He studied recordings of Hitler's voice and his harsh growl is evidently an uncanny reproduction. (That he also sounds like Klaus Kinski  puts a new spin on Aguirre ). The war is lost and nobody knows what to do. Wehrmacht  engage in desperate carousing; one general blows up his family. Syberberg's magnum opus provides an exhaustive analysis of the Hitler cult. But Ganz's antics notwithstanding, Downfall 's real subject is the suffering of the German peopleas embodied mainly by a bewildered child soldier, a beleaguered if sanitized SS doctor, and an honest old general.
Other figures stand in for national character disorders. Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes ) and his ice queen wife (Corinna Harfouch ) are brainwashed zombies. "I won't let the children grow up in a world where there is no National Socialism," she declares before poisoning them all. Even though the starstruck Traudl recognizes Hitler is a meanie, she remains loyal. Everyone tells her to leave the bunker, but so long as her führer needs her, she can't. Traudl glimpses the marriage of Adi and Eva; as in HitlerThe Last Days , the officiating clerk reflexively asks for their Aryan identification papers.
Stupid but not unkind and typically wearing some sort of dirndl, Eva is the surrogate for a nation that loved, not wisely, but too well. "He's changed so much," she confides in Traudl. "He only talks about dogs and vegetarian meals." Eva confesses that she hates Hitler's pet Blondi and secretly kicks the dog under the table. In Blind Spot , Junge expressed the anger that Hitler's entourage felt when he drank the Kool-Aid  and abandoned them. Downfall  subsumes that rage in a general sense that Hitler always despised the German masses. This may be cathartic, but if so, only for a German audience. (Francis Ford Coppola , who released Syberberg's masterpiece, arrogantly retitled it Our Hitler ; Downfall  is more like Theirs.)
A current Japanese blockbuster concerns an imperial U-boat thwarting America's plan to drop a third atom bombthis time on Tokyo. Downfall  may be grimly self-important and inescapably trivializing. But we should be grateful that German cinema is more inclined to normalize the nation's history than rewrite it.
