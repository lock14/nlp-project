There is a visual image that dominates Crash
 from its opening credits: blurred spheres of light moving in a seemingly random fashion, sometimes colliding soundlessly, only to continue on their uncertain paths. These abstract illuminations, of course, are headlights floating along the streets of Los Angeles, an urban landscape in which a car accident is the most common form of personal interaction.  Set over a 24-hour period during an unusually cold Christmas season, Crash
 follows the intertwined lives of a multicultural group of Los Angelenos: two African-American carjackers, a Brentwood housewife, a Latino locksmith, a Persian store owner, and a white policeman, among others. The brilliantly conceived screenplay by Paul Haggis and Bob Moresco employs a narrative device made familiar to moviegoers in the films of Robert Altman (Nashville
) and more recently Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia
), one in which the paths of seemingly unconnected individuals frequently cross according to the laws of contrivance and coincidence. In Crash
, the multiplicity of storylines is rooted in the script�s theme about the complex nature of human beings. Normal social intercourse, for many of the film�s characters, is defined primarily by preconceived notions about the color of a person�s skin, the type of car he drives, the number of tattoos on his body, his line of work, and so on. Because racial stereotypes and prejudices form most of our uninformed judgments about others, the dialogue in Crash
 abounds in ethnic slurs and swipes that leave few unscathed. With a greater purpose in mind, this bold and often darkly funny film invites you to make comfortable judgments about its myriad characters based on these first impressions, and to pigeonhole them in uncomplicated, black-and-white terms, not much differently from the way those characters judge and perceive each other. But just when it seems that things are about to reach an explosive boiling point in the City of Angels, something surprising begins to happen in Crash
. In one of the most beautifully directed, scored, and edited sequences in recent movie memory, a "villain" in the film acts selflessly, contrary to the expectations you've imposed on him. At this point, Crash
 starts to rattle your chain in a way that few films have, bearing lucid witness to the full dimensionality of the human species. It�s not a matter of showing the good and bad attributes in everyone � the film thankfully doesn�t fall into that diametric trap � but rather a matter of reminding us that the filters through which we estimate a person�s character can obscure as much as they reveal. Indeed, the film�s final shot is a God�s-eye view of Los Angeles, suggesting that only an omniscient cosmos can truly judge us for who we are. The entire ensemble cast is superb, with Dillon giving a standout performance as an LAPD cop for whom you feel equal measures of disdain and compassion. Equally memorable is rap performer Chris "Ludacris" Bridges as a thief with a skewed social conscience. (You get the impression that all of the actors relished sinking their teeth in this meaty material.) First-time director Haggis (he wrote the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby
) rarely misses a beat here, achieving that which the most experienced of filmmakers have only dreamed of. Like most works of art, Crash
 gets under your skin in a way that is incapable of explanation. It transcends that which can be articulated through mere words. Because no pithy review, no matter how well intentioned, can possibly do this film justice, you really have no choice but to see Crash
. It�s the most compelling American movie to come around in a long, long time.


There will be people who will think ''Crash" is the most important film they have seen in years, and good for them. Whatever makes sense of this vale of tears through which we travel in air-conditioned isolation at 75 miles per hour.
Permit others to be less convinced. ''Crash" is one of those multi-character, something-is-rotten-in-Los Angeles barnburners that grab you by the lapels and try desperately to shake you up. It's more artful than ''Grand Canyon," less artsy than ''Magnolia" (LA gets dusted with snow instead of frogs), and much less of a mess than ''Falling Down." (Michael Douglas as an angry nerd in horn-rim glasses, remember?) It also features some hellaciously fine acting and at least one scene that will stick with me for years.
But its characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do. You can feel its creator shuttling them here and there on the grid of greater LA, pausing portentously between each move.
Since that creator is director Paul Haggis, a longtime TV writer who grabbed the gold ring last year by writing the script for Clint Eastwood's ''Million Dollar Baby," I guess he's earned the right to make a big statement. But, boy, does he want you to know it.
Traffic and race are the twin obsessions of everyone in ''Crash" -- the latter especially sends the characters into conniptions. Two young African-Americans, Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (Chris Bridges, a.k.a. the rapper Ludacris), stroll down a busy boulevard and watch the rich Caucasians flinch. Anthony, the angry street-corner philosopher, muses, ''We're the only black people, surrounded by a sea of overcaffeinated white people -- why aren't we
 the ones scared?"
His friend has an interesting response, which I won't spoil, but it's fairly shameful, and it underscores that while Haggis thinks he's exploding racial clich�s, he's really just rearranging ones we already live with.
Elsewhere in ''Crash," a rising young district attorney (Brendan Fraser) gets carjacked and despairs that the perpetrators had to be black (now he'll lose either the African-American vote or the law-and-order vote). His pampered wife (Sandra Bullock, who's barely in the movie, no matter what the trailers imply) retreats behind a wall of privileged paranoia, taking it out on Daniel (Michael Pena), a Mexican locksmith with jailhouse tattoos.
Daniel, of course, is a sweet-natured husband and father struggling to get his family to a neighborhood where the gunfire doesn't pop all night. He also struggles to keep his cool when dealing with Farhad (Shaun Toub), an Iranian shopkeeper who understands English only as it suits him and is so convinced the world is ripping him off that he buys a gun against the wishes of his upscale daughter (Bahar Soomekh).
Most central to the movie's harrowing vision are two LAPD cops, the venomously racist Ryan (Matt Dillon) and the good-hearted rookie Hanson (Ryan Phillippe). We first meet them as Ryan decides to pull over a Lincoln Navigator in which buppie film director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his chic wife Christine (Thandie Newton) are engaged in a bit of post-awards-banquet horseplay.
The scene gets ugly and Dillon turns Ryan into a genuinely hateful man -- Haggis pushes his loathesomeness into our face. So it's a shock when ''Crash" humanizes the cop later in the game. That becomes the film's modus operandi: The director dares us to assume we know these people, and then neatly offers conflicting evidence.
Rather too neatly in places, and in others most unconvincingly. After Cameron is further humiliated on a film set by his producer (Tony Danza), he embarks on a course of action that simply makes no sense. Characters intersect with one another in what can only be called Screenwriter's Coincidence: By the time the young cop picks up Tate's Peter, I was sure everyone in this overcrowded film had been randomly introduced to everyone else. (I was wrong -- the shopkeeper's daughter unexpectedly shows up at the very end.)
Against that, Haggis pulls off some powerful scenes, particularly the sequence in which a rescue from a flaming car is intercut with the shopkeeper finally being pushed over the edge; the soundtrack music, which could have been wham-bam thriller stuff, is instead a lovely and liquid Arabic track by the American rai
 singer Shani Rigsbee.
Also quite wonderful is Don Cheadle's performance as Graham, the police detective who connects the story's tangents and who becomes the film's weary heart. You get a sense of LA's racial gridlock in the scene in which Graham gets a dose of realpolitik from the district attorney's political adviser (a brilliant William Fichtner).
At the same time, the cards are stacked against Graham in ways that are all too ''ironic." Haggis still has the mind, if not the soul, of a TV writer -- I don't say that to be unkind (I can't wait to see what he does next) but to insist that real life does not fall apart quite this tidily. His agony may be real, but his perspective is still that of a man looking down from the Hollywood Hills, seeing chess pieces rather than people.


         I'm not sure the best way to kick off a movie that wants to expose the dark heart of the true 
Los Angeles is to contrast it with "real cities" where "people walk, you brush past people, people bump into you," but that's what writer-director Paul Haggis does in the first few moments of "Crash," a grim, histrionic experiment in vehicular metaphor slaughter.
 
  Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito), two detectives in love, are rear-ended on their way to a murder scene, and no sooner has the dazed Graham delivered his soliloquy on urban alienation ("I think we miss that sense of touch so much, we crash into each other just to feel something") Ria and the other driver, a middle-aged Korean woman, start loudly trading racial slurs without even a four-letter preamble. So much for the urban brotherhood of man: In "Crash," there's no getting through a fender bender, casual conversation, business transaction, phone call to mom or naked love romp without someone's ancestry taking a nasty beating.
 


         






    From here, Haggis, a veteran television writer who wrote the script for "Million Dollar Baby," weaves no fewer than nine sets of characters into a suffocating tangle of ham-fisted ironies and belief-beggaring coincidences designed to reveal the latent racism that festers in the souls of all those who ever laid claim to a 310, 323, 213 or 818 area code. (Yes, you too.) The movie's structure has drawn comparisons to "Short Cuts" and "Magnolia," though it'll feel familiar to anyone who submits to regular cudgelings by "hard-hitting" network TV dramas that wield messages like bludgeons.
 
  Every conflict in "Crash" — even lovers' quarrels — is racially motivated, and having hit on this key to human inhumanity, the director pursues the line with extreme (sorry) prejudice. There may be a million stories in the naked city, but there are something like 20 principal characters in this movie, and they expend 90 minutes of screen time on roughly one topic of conversation.
 
  What really makes you want to screw up your eyes, clap your hands over your ears and belt out a show tune, though, is the nagging feeling that Haggis, a Canadian who has resided in this city for most of his adult life and who suffered a traumatic real-life encounter with a pair of armed carjackers a few years ago, seems to have experienced some misplaced guilt over his lingering low opinion of the gentlemen who took his car, followed by anger at the guilt, more guilt at the anger, and so on. I'm only guessing, of course, but upon meditating on the lives of his assailants — what were they like in their free time, when they weren't 
sticking guns in people's faces? — the director has written them a funny valentine. They are reborn in his imagination as a couple of charming, clever, philosophical, socially committed young car thieves who, when not busy jacking SUVs, enjoy ice hockey, Merle Haggard and liberating smuggled Asian sweatshop workers into the free market wonderland of downtown L.A.
 
  Anthony (Chris "Ludacris" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate), black men in their 20s, come out of an Italian restaurant in a ritzy neighborhood where Anthony gripes that the black waitress has treated them shabbily. When Peter points out that black men have a reputation for being bad tippers, Anthony confesses that he didn't leave one. This is just the first of about 1 1/2 hours worth of Buddhist conundrums on the nature of racist stereotypes. Anthony, a philosophical sort, sees racism lurking in every corner, even in the gesture of a white woman who takes her husband's arm as they pass.
 
  "We're the only black people surrounded by a sea of over-caffeinated white people and a trigger-happy LAPD," he says. "Why aren't we scared?" It sounds like a good question, until the considerably more chilled-out Peter ripostes with: "Because we have guns?" and within seconds, Jean (Sandra Bullock) and Rick (Brendan Fraser) are scuttling along the sidewalk, having been divested of their Escalade.
 
  If a generalization falls in the forest, and somebody who fits the description confirms it, is it really true? In the case of Rick and Jean, at least, it is. Rick happens to be the district attorney of Los Angeles County, a man apparently incapable of experiencing anything except through the prism of how it will play in the media. After the carjacking, the couple repair home to change the locks and spin the story. Rick frets that being robbed by black men will cost him either the black vote or the law-and-order vote and instructs his aides to locate an African American on whom he can pin a medal. The lonely, bitter, pathologically angry Jean, meanwhile, newly freed from the worry that her racism might have been unfounded, freaks out at the sight of the locksmith, whom she loudly takes for a gang member. Then she snaps at the maid.
 
  It's around this point that the theme of the movie, neatly summarized by one of its characters and encapsulated in the tagline, begins to emerge. "You think you know who you are," the racist cop Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) tells his green, uninitiated partner. "You have no idea." Actually, in "Crash," you do. Whatever flimsy layers cover the characters' raging 24-hour xenophobia are swept away by the slightest breeze. It's painfully clear to anyone but Jean, for instance, exactly who Jean is. The sensitive, sloe-eyed locksmith, meanwhile, like the warm and friendly domestic, bears his symbolic nobility like a cross. Daniel (Michael Peña) bears Jean's insults silently, then goes home to comfort his traumatized child, who sleeps under the bed for fear of stray bullets. Soon, Daniel and his family will be victimized by a high-strung Persian patriarch, Farhad (Shaun Toub), driven to the edge by constant (and geographically inaccurate) race-baiting.
 
  Add to this daisy chain of bigotry a Korean who sells illegal Thai and Cambodian workers to sweatshops, a black HMO worker who denies coverage to a sick man because the man's son is a racist, a white cop on his third African American murder, and a member of the D.A.'s office who wonders "what it is" with black people who "can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar," and the film's characters stop seeming like they've been culled from a random cross-section of the citizenry so much as cherry-picked from the top of the class at the Pat Buchanan School of International Relations.
 
  The few characters who aren't culprits are victims, the most discouraging among them Cameron (Terrence Howard), a successful black television director. Cameron and his wife, Christine (Thandie Newton), are returning home from an awards show when they're pulled over by Dillon's racist Officer Ryan and his conflicted young partner, Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe). Ryan, a virulent racist, humiliates the director and his wife by viciously molesting her under threat of arrest.
 
  At home, the couple implode. After hanging up the phone without reporting the assault ("Do you really think they'll care about what you have to say?" says Cameron), Christine lashes out at her husband. "The closest you ever got to being black was watching 'The Cosby Show,' " she yells. And he: "At least I didn't watch it with the rest of the equestrian team!" Of course, what with all this horseback riding and "Cosby Show" watching, you'd think they'd have a lawyer too. But "Crash" is too heavily invested in the idea of race as class to allow these two even the slightest sense of security, entitlement or surprise at being so crudely mishandled by the establishment of which they are a part. Instead, Cameron quietly unravels as his whole life reveals itself for the sham that it is. Even Tony Danza, who plays an actor on his show, cows him into humiliating a black costar. How's that for rock bottom?
 
  As another critic once said about another movie bearing the same title, " 'Crash' isn't plotted, it's programmed.' " The logarithm is fairly simple: Money plus power plus a pale complexion equals total inhumanity. (Jean learns the hard way that her only friend in the world is the woman who cleans her house.) Power plus pallor minus money fares slightly better. (Ryan's bigotry is motivated by the suffering of his sick father, who lost his janitorial company when the city began giving preferential contracts to minority-owned businesses, and he gets his moment of slo-mo redemption.) Pallor minus power minus money plus small-town idealism (as embodied by Hansen) gets a kick in the head.
 
  Any glimpse of emotional honesty comes courtesy of the actors, who manage to do a credible job despite the material. The smart, sexy spark between Esposito and Cheadle is all but extinguished by the airlessness of the script, and Cheadle manages to squeeze in some quietly affecting moment as the unloved son of a drug-addicted mother. Howard, an actor who radiates intelligence and sensitivity, fills out his maddeningly reductive character as best he can, though he's never given the chance to do anything but react to the trumped-up pressures around him.
 
  Similarly, Newton is never allowed to come down from the ledge of hysteria, just as Bullock is systematically barred from entry into the human race. Tate and Bridges, as the loquacious carjackers, provide the only breath of fresh air in the movie, but given the film's bird's-eye point of view and its pretensions at objectivity, their charm feels assigned at random. The cast members more than pull their weight, it's just too bad they had to get together for this.

The stunning, must-see drama Crash  is proof that words have not lost the ability to shock in our anesthetized society. I can't remember the last time I have felt so galvanized, disturbed, and moved by full sentences, unadorned by gratuitous profanity, flying out of the mouths of screen characters as ordinary as you or me or the guy idling at the next traffic light on an average day in Los Angeles at Christmastime. Crash  is about the collision of cars, the machinery on which L.A. is built. But it's also about the collision of races, cultures, and classes  another kind of L.A. experience. White folks, black folks, Hispanics, and Asians  nobody gets by in this amazingly tough, at times unexpectedly funny, and always humane movie without getting dented. An assured directorial debut by Million Dollar Baby  screenwriter Paul Haggis, who also produced, conceived the story, and wrote the script with Bobby Moresco, Crash  suggests, convincingly, that violent contact  in word or on wheels  is the only way left to reach out and touch somebody.
The pileup begins almost immediately when two young black men (Larenz Tate and rapper–turned–fine actor Chris ''Ludacris'' Bridges), walking in an upscale white enclave and talking about the perception of young black men in upscale white enclaves, efficiently carjack a Lincoln Navigator that happens to belong to the L.A. district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his rich-bitch wife (Sandra Bullock). Bam!, that's four people linked and unmasked, in all their ugliest prejudices and most shameful fears, by the fate of one SUV  a luxe safari truck that at first has nothing, and yet eventually everything, to do with the fate of another Navigator, owned by a rich black TV director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) and stopped for inspection by a racist white cop (Matt Dillon) and his partner (Ryan Phillippe).
How could so many lives smash into one another so quickly? How, for that matter, does the family of a Hispanic locksmith wind up linked, in danger and redemption, with that of a burgled Iranian shopkeeper? What do these strangers have to do with a black police detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito), who are investigating a homicide? Role for role, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is strong, with a stylistic emphasis on blur and confusion interrupted by knife-carved incidents of prejudice and consequence (aurally stitched by Mark Isham's anxious electronic score). As Haggis' taut vignettes reveal Crash 's bigger traffic pattern and the words rain down, there's little to do but grip tight and prepare for major impact.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Picture; Best Supporting Actor (Matt Dillon); Best Director (Paul Haggis); Best Original Screenplay (Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco); Best Film Editing; Best Original Song (''In the Deep'')

hat kind of movie is "Crash"? It belongs to a genre that has been flourishing in recent years - at least in the esteem of critics - but that still lacks a name. A provisional list of examples might include "Monster's Ball," "House of Sand and Fog" and "21 Grams." In each of these films, as in "Crash," Americans from radically different backgrounds are brought together by a grim serendipity that forces them, or at least the audience, to acknowledge their essential connectedness. The look of these movies and the rough authenticity of their locations create an atmosphere of naturalism that is meant to give force to their rigorously pessimistic view of American life. The performances, often by some of the finest screen actors working today, have the dense texture and sober discipline that we associate with realism. But to classify these movies as realistic would be misleading, as the stories they tell are, in nearly every respect, preposterous, and they tend to be governed less by the spirit of observation than by superstition. This is not necessarily bad, and some of these movies are very good indeed. But in approaching "Crash," we should be more than usually cautious about mistaking its inhabitants - residents of Los Angeles of various hues, temperaments and occupations - for actual human beings. This may not be easy, for they are played by people of such graven, complex individuality as Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard, as well as by less established but equally gifted actors like Michael Pena and Chris Bridges (better known to the world by his rap name, Ludacris). Their characters - and the dozen or so others whose lives intersect in the course of an exceedingly eventful day and a half - may have names, addresses, families and jobs, but they are, at bottom, ciphers in an allegorical scheme dreamed up by Paul Haggis, the screenwriter (most recently of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby"), here making his directorial debut. As he demonstrated to galvanizing effect in the "Million Dollar Baby" script, Mr. Haggis is not unduly concerned with subtlety. At a time when ambitious movies are dominated by knowing cleverness and showy sensation, he makes a case for blunt, earnest emotion, and shows an admirable willingness to risk sentimentality and clich� in the pursuit of genuine feeling. Many of the scenes in "Crash" unfold with great dramatic power, even when they lack a credible narrative or psychological motive. Mr. Haggis's evident sincerity and intelligence are reflected in the conviction of the cast, and may also leave an impression on the audience. So much feeling, so much skill, so much seriousness, such an urgent moral agenda - all of this must surely answer our collective hunger for a good movie, or even a great one, about race and class in a modern American city. Not even close. "Crash" writes its themes in capital letters - Race, Class, Life, Fate - and then makes them the subjects of a series of speeches and the pivot points for a succession of clumsy reversals. The first speech, which doubles as introductory voice-over narration, is by Mr. Cheadle's character, a detective named Graham, addressing his partner (and lover), Ria (Jennifer Esposito), after their car has been in a minor accident. He takes the event as a metaphor for the disjunctive, isolated character of life in Los Angeles, while she insists that it is merely a literal, physical occurrence that requires a practical response. It does not take long to figure out whose side Mr. Haggis is on. Metaphor hangs in the California air like smog (or like the snow that is incongruously falling on the Hollywood Hills). The other major element in the atmosphere is intolerance. Ria, who is Hispanic, climbs out of the car and confronts the other driver, an Asian-American woman, and before long their argument has descended into racial name-calling. This sets the pattern for just about every other conversation in the movie. In the next scene, which takes place earlier on the previous day, a hot-tempered Iranian shopkeeper is insulted by the owner of a gun store, who calls him "Osama." And so it goes, slur by slur, until we come full circle, to the original accident, after which a few lingering questions are resolved. In the meantime, quite a lot happens. Guns are pulled, cars are stolen, children are endangered, cars flip over, and many angry, hurtful words are exchanged, all of it threaded together by Mr. Haggis's quick, emphatic direction and Mark Isham's maundering electronic score. Mr. Haggis is eager to show the complexities of his many characters, which means that each one will show exactly two sides. A racist white police officer will turn out to be physically courageous and devoted to his ailing father; his sensitive white partner will engage in some deadly racial profiling; a young black man who sees racial profiling everywhere will turn out to be a carjacker; a wealthy, mild-mannered black man will pull out a gun and start screaming. No one is innocent. There's good and bad in everyone. (The exception is Mr. Pena's character, a Mexican-American locksmith who is an island of quiet decency in a sea of howling prejudice and hypocrisy). That these bromides count as insights may say more about the state of the American civic conversation than about Mr. Haggis's limitations as a storyteller, and there is no doubt that he is trying to dig into the unhappiness and antagonism that often simmer below the placid surface of everyday life. "I'm angry all the time, and I don't know why," says Jean (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the city's district attorney (Brendan Fraser), the day after their S.U.V. has been stolen at gunpoint. Her condition is all but universal in Mr. Haggis's city, but its avenues of expression are overwrought and implausible. The idea that bigotry is the public face of private unhappiness - the notion that we lash out at people we don't know as a form of displaced revenge against the more familiar sources of our misery - is an interesting one, but the failure of "Crash" is that it states its ideas, again and again, without realizing them in coherent dramatic form. It is at once tangled and threadbare; at times you have trouble keeping track of all the characters, but they run into one another with such frequency that, by the end, you start to think that the population of Los Angeles County must number in the mid-two figures - all of it strangers who hate one another on sight. So what kind of a movie is "Crash"? A frustrating movie: full of heart and devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to be subtle; and profoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle and disturb. "Crash" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, strong language (including many racial slurs) and a brief sex scene.

A determinedly dire -- but neatly packaged -- ensembler on the state of race relations, "Crash" represents the modern condition as a violent bumper car ride. In his feature directorial debut, prominent TV writer-producer Paul Haggis demonstrates his tube-honed skill at intertwining multiple story strands, but the tense drama eventually becomes off-putting when it becomes clear almost every scene hinges on an unpleasant or ugly racial interaction. Having paid $4 million for the indie production at the Toronto fest, Lions Gate should be able to parlay the name cast and a measure of critical support into decent returns on this well-made but not very likable picture.
Working in a format that recalls innumerable television shows as well as bigscreen mosaics such as "Short Cuts," Haggis, with co-writer Bobby Moresco, clearly set out to take a serious and probing look at the Los Angeles melting pot, its ever-evolving rainbow nature and the simmering prejudices of its inhabitants. Haggis knows how to grab the viewer's attention, via intense confrontations as well as by planting dramatic seeds that bear fruit in, more often than not, grimly unexpected ways.
Strategy results in a collection of powerful individual scenes. Cumulatively, however, they amount to a narrow, ungenerous and, finally, unrepresentative view of the world, one that suggests people are correct in suspecting others as having only the worst motives. Pic seems to promote an ideology of victimhood, and shoves race-based thinking to the fore of every human exchange. In his earnest attempt to speak plainly about how racial stereotypes and ingrained prejudices play an often insidious part in everyone's daily lives, Haggis protests too much, and in the process contracts the scope of his film.
Yarn begins unspooling during the Christmas season at the scene of a nasty automobile accident in the Hollywood Hills, and proceeds down to Westwood, where two young black men, Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (Chris "Ludacris" Bridges), carjack a Lincoln Navigator that happens to belong to District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock).
An uptight, ill-tempered woman, Jean carps at her husband and denigrates, so that he can hear it, the locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena), whom she perceives to be a Hispanic gang type; she insists they'll just have to get the locks changed on their home all over again. Not only that, but she blurts out insulting racial epithets in the presence of her Hispanic maid.
With a priority call out to look for the stolen SUV, two white cops, Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), pull over just such a car, one occupied by an upscale black couple, TV director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton). In a very nasty, racially motivated way, Ryan puts his hand all the way up Christine's dress, abusing her while verbally humiliating Cameron, all to the horror of his partner. Christine later castigates her husband for doing nothing, even though he was powerless under the circumstances.
Threads are further played out, with offshoots springing up. On their way to a chop shop, Peter and Anthony run over a "Chinaman," whose blood on the car prevents them from unloading it. Detective Graham Walters (Don Cheadle), who's looking for his missing brother, has to grapple with a fresh crime scene in which a white cop has evidently shot a black undercover cop in self-defense. An Iranian shop owner, Farhad (Shaun Toub), buys a gun for self-protection and, after finding his store trashed, determines to use it against Daniel, who he thinks hasn't fixed his broken lock properly.
In the most extreme set of coincidences in a movie hardly wanting for them, Hanson, who has requested a new partner to get away from Ryan, ends up stopping Cameron again in his SUV after it's been 'jacked by Peter and Anthony, with scary results. Ryan, for his part, is the first cop on the scene of an awful highway accident from which the pinned Christine, the woman he's manhandled the night before, urgently needs to be rescued. Irony of ironies.
Some of these stories of the naked city pan out tragically, some are manipulated to seem horrifying then not so bad, and others have a hopeful little spin put on them. There are few positive or strong relationships depicted, save for a conventionally loving father-daughter bond that is shamefully milked for maximum anxiety, and everyone harbors dark suspicions of others, often for good reason. A reasonably realistic and varied array of actions and responses is rejected in favor of an anxiety-provoking slate of negative motives that fulfill the drama's sociological program, creating a blindered view of humanity in a film that could have been employed to examine a more diverse cross-section of attitudes.
Pic may become tiresome due to its insistent hitting of the same notes, but it never bores. Specific scenes, especially those involving Dillon as the racially resentful cop who, like everyone else, has his reasons, bristle with tension as the character continuously pushes past conventional limits in abusing his authority and, redeemingly, in his display of uncommon valor.
Predominant impression given off by thesps is of characters whose nerves are frayed and patience worn thin; they are agitated and exasperated, just one insult or incident from the edge. Actors come across as grim and somewhat suggestive that they're up to something more important than the Hollywood norm.
Largely undifferentiated Los Angeles locations have been given the gritty treatment by lenser J. Michael Muro, and Mark Isham's techno/vocal score mixes moodiness and a veneer of pretension in equal measure.

A daisy-chain civics lesson about race that makes Spike Lee  seem pianissimo, Million Dollar Baby  scripter Paul Haggis 's directorial debut, Crash , is ostensibly set in today's L.A., a snake pit of compulsive racism the film is determined to flush out. But it's a dated, what-about"Ebony and Ivory" pessimist's fantasy, in which virtually every plot point and line of dialogue is evidence of outlandish bigotry. (Whites, blacks, Asians, Chicanos, and Persians routinely spitting public slurs at each other? Not in post-millennium L.A., they don't.) Hyperbolizing up a storm, Haggis entwines nearly a dozen major threads: Matt Dillon 's racist LAPD cop, Sandra Bullock 's spoiled, immigrant-employing housewife, Don Cheadle 's thoughtful homicide detective (with partner-girlfriend Jennifer Esposito ), Terrence Howard 's successful but shamed TV director, Ludacris 's politicized car thief, Shaun Toub 's handgun-buying Persian shopkeeper, etc. The characters pass each other in the night, only to (predictably) circle back later; the soundtrack's portentous liturgies and the multiple montages full of brooding warn us over and over again that every affront and prejudicial slight will come home to roost tenfold.
Generalized racial profiling is a constant source of conflict, and it's to Haggis's credit that the dynamic is ethically ambivalent; his people's presuppositions are as often right as they are wrong. Contrivances abound, but so do gray fields of moral relativism. Not surprisingly, Haggis's film works best in poetical asides, as when Michael Peña 's stereotype-beset locksmith crawls under his hiding daughter's bed to talk to her about distant gunshots, or when an act of vigilante rage climaxes with an apparent miracle. The film's bruising peak is when Dillon's bullethead struggles to rescue Thandie Newton 's rich SUV driverwhom he had sexually harassed on the roadside the night beforefrom a car wreck, a sequence that rises out of the movie's pretensions like an aria. Full of well-observed supporting riffs, Crash  might've accumulated more frisson had it cast a clearer eye on how social tension actually plays.
