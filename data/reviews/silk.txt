         "Silk" is a shaggy worm tale about a young Frenchman's instant obsession with a once-glimpsed Japanese woman beginning in 1862. Based on Alessandro Baricco's bestselling novella, it stars Michael Pitt as Herve Joncour, the unenthusiastic French army officer and mayor's son who bags his military career to work for local silk magnate Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) and marry devoted schoolteacher Hélène (Keira Knightley).
 
 Herve's work, securing healthy silkworm eggs, takes him first to Africa and then to Japan, enduring long, dangerous journeys and painful separations from the fragile Hélène. In Japan, Herve spies a beauty (Sei Ashina) working in the service of the feudal baron (Kôji Yakusho) and is instantly bewitched.
 


         






   Despite the perils of the trek, Herve eagerly returns to Asia in the hope of seeing the girl. However, each venture becomes more of a slog for the audience as the sequences seem to go on for the combined running times of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Reds." The miscast Pitt's logy narrative rhythms don't help his character's incomprehensible motivations or the film's glacial pace.
 
 Extremely attractive though she may be, the girl neither does nor says anything that would make you cross a crowded bar, let alone make repeated trips halfway around the world. And may we reiterate that Herve has Keira Knightley waiting at home.
 
 The underutilized Knightley is saddled with greeting her wayward husband with lines such as, "I thought you were dead," on one of his returns and generally looking saintly. Molina, as Baldabiou, is the only cast member who transcends the material -- as he always does -- and his scenes are considerably more invigorated than the rest of the film.
 
 It's a disappointing offering from Canadian François Girard, the infrequent film director whose prismatic "Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould" (1993) and sweeping "The Red Violin" (1998) set expectations for something far more interesting and less conventional than this.
 
 After working primarily in theater, opera and television in recent years, Girard cowrote the screenplay for "Silk" with Michael Golding, and the pair seems intent on producing some grandly classic depiction of Great Love. And though the film aspires to the epic with pretensions of deeper philosophical meaning, it ultimately settles for being the "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" of historical romances.
 

 
 "Silk." MPAA rating: R for sexuality and nudity. In English and unsubtitled Japanese. Running time: 1 hour, 56 minutes. In selected theaters.   

What we're told in Silk  is that Michael Pitt personifies a French 19th-century silkworm merchant in love with his wife but obsessed with a mysterious woman he glimpses on business in Japan. What we see  is a mopey fellow without the energy to comb his hair. As the wife with even less to do in this wan, generically pretty adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's 1996 novel, Keira Knightley doles out dewy smiles to her costar like biscuit rewards. This leaves Alfred Molina, as Pitt's boss, to try something  anything  to enliven the movie.

“Silk” is the latest casualty in a line of films with a David Lean glint in their eye that aspire to elevated popular art but that come across as kitsch. In the tradition of movies like “Snow Falling on Cedars,” the film, directed by François Girard, confuses pretty scenery doused  in ponderous music with epic visual poetry. Impenetrable musings intended to evoke ineffable romantic longing leave you scratching your head as you wait, ever more impatiently, for something to happen. “Silk” is the latest casualty in a line of films with a David Lean glint in their eye that aspire to elevated popular art but that come across as kitsch.

Impenetrable musings intended to evoke ineffable romantic longing leave you scratching your head as you wait, ever more impatiently, for something to happen. The movie’s narrator, Hervé Joncour (Michael Pitt),  is a military officer in 1860s France who, encouraged by his father, the mayor of a village, is taken under the wing of Baldabiou (Alfred Molina), a greedy, roguish merchant who invites him into the silk trade. The film’s problems begin with Mr. Pitt. As he mumbles Hervé’s story, sometimes inaudibly, his character sounds either supremely detached  or heavily medicated. With his swollen, chiseled lips and empty blue eyes that sometimes tear up, Mr. Pitt is a reasonably photogenic specimen. But this actor, whose typical screen character is a broken, androgynous man-child, is disastrously miscast. Hervé is an adventurer and explorer who travels over rugged territory from France to Japan three times in the movie. Mr. Pitt has the get-up-and-go of a spoiled lap dog flopped on a cushion. To be fair, though, even an actor with twice his vitality would be hard put to infuse feeling into the maundering dialogue. Hervé’s mission is to save Europe’s doomed silk industry by bringing home from Japan a cache of silkworm eggs. An epidemic is destroying the eggs in European hatcheries, and Japan, being closed to the West, has an uncontaminated supply. One of his challenges is to penetrate the border. As he makes the trip west to east, mostly over land, from Vienna to Kiev, crossing the Russian steppes and eventually reaching Japan on a smuggler’s ship, there is plenty of spectacle. But this choppily edited film barely conveys the distance he travels or the hardship he endures. Nor does Mr. Pitt’s face register his reaction to anything. Hervé’s wife, Hélène, a schoolteacher played by the ravishing Keira Knightley, is barely present in the movie. We briefly see her pining for her husband’s return while he’s  away and complaining about their childless marriage when he’s home. Their infertility is not for lack of trying. Although the two are shown entwined in bed, their nude love scenes (discreetly photographed) have zero chemistry. “Silk” is an adaptation by Mr. Girard and his screenwriting collaborator Michael Golding of Alessandro Baricco’s international best seller. For Mr. Girard,  the film fits a pattern. His much stronger earlier movies, “Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould” and “The Red Violin,” also demonstrated his predilection for tricky stories with artistic (usually musical) themes. “Silk” is smothered under a score composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto that desperately wants to sound like Arvo Pärt, especially in piano and violin passages that feature Joshua Bell, who was prominent in “The Red Violin.” But this music, which is supposed to transport you into the sublime, feels more like silk wallpaper. On the last leg of Hervé’s journey, he is led blindfolded from Yamagata harbor to a village in the Japanese interior where he meets with Hara Jubei (Koji Yakusho), a local warlord, to exchange gold for eggs. The transaction completed, he returns by the same route, and with his new wealth buys a house and property that he eventually turns into a field of lilies for Hélène. The movie’s tiny dramatic kernel involves Hervé’s wordless one-time liaison with Hara Jubei’s beautiful concubine, which leaves him feeling obsessed and guilty. If the movie’s twist ending, involving the translation of two letters from Japanese into French, is worthy of Maupassant, it is so long in arriving that the closest thing to a catharsis it offers is a sense of relief that something finally happened. “Silk” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and nudity.

"Silk" is a snooze. Vacuous, arid and terminally dull, this adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's freak bestseller hasn't a trace of real life or energy to it, and is hamstrung by a lethargic lead performance by Michael Pitt as a French military officer that suggests he'd rather be back playing Kurt Cobain for Gus Van Sant. Novel's rep and Keira Knightley's presence will give this a leg up in certain markets, especially in Europe, but general B.O. outlook, and certainly in the U.S., looks wispy.
Italian writer Baricco's 1997 novel was one of those oddball successes, like "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," that occasionally breaks through on the basis of a bogus poetic profundity and faux romanticism, despite a defiant lack of characterization, detail and depth. Unfortuately, French-Canadian helmer Francois Girard ("The Red Violin") is faithful to this aesthetic to a fault, serving up this flimsy tale as if it were a priceless artifact.
Result feels inauthentic in nearly every detail. The Italian town of Sermoneta fills in not very convincingly for a provincial French town of 1862, when young Herve Joncour (Pitt) leaves the army, marries beautiful schoolteacher Helene (Knightley) and, in the employ of entrepreneur Baldabiou (Alfred Molina), heads off for a long journey in search of uninfected silkworm eggs, as the local eggs have been afflicted with a disease.
From the very start, the air feels sucked out of the picture by Pitt, who mopes around as if he hasn't a thought in his head, a desire in his heart or enough energy for a brisk walk, much less a trek to Japan.
Despite the potential for adventure and ethnographic detail in this ambitious trip across two continents, pic (like the novel) is entirely uninterested in such mundane matters. Once Herve arrives at his destination, the film in no way explores the nature of Japan in its final days of virtually total isolation from the outside world; compared to this, "The Last Samurai" was a paragon of cultural investigation and insight.
Despite the ban on trade with the West, Herve manages to make a deal with rural strongman Hara Jubei (Koji Yakusho) and smuggles enough eggs back to France to make himself and virtually everyone else in his village rich from the silk they produce in Baldabiou's factories.
Less fertile, alas, is the union between Herve and Helene. To the latter's distress, she never becomes pregnant and so must content herself with her students as well as a lovely new home and garden, while Herve heads back to Japan again the next year. Knightley's performance, for which she adopts an American accent, presumably so that it will match Pitt's, mainly consists of bland, longing-filled greetings and farewells, along with a topless bed scene.
Story comes to pivot on Herve's fascination for Hara Jubei's concubine, imaginatively called the Girl (model Sei Ashina), whom the Frenchman eyes meaningfully until they share one rapturous night prior to his second departure for Europe with more eggs. As such stories like to put it, Herve is changed forever by this encounter, his subsequent obsession fueled by a note in Japanese that reads, "Come back, or I shall die."
One final trip to a now war-ravaged Japan ensues, and the high hand of fate orchestrates the final details, which are portrayed in a state of airless drama.
As aggravatingly boring as the film is, the least one might expect is a canvas of exceptional beauty to distract the eyes. But even this is denied, as Alain Dostie's lensing has an unattractively brownish cast and is not strikingly composed in the bargain.
Although pic clocks in at under two hours, it feels interminable. A period Japanese village was constructed on location, although this section could almost have been shot anywhere for all the atmosphere evoked.
Ryuichi Sakamoto's score is okay, but nowhere near the level of his work on "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence" and "The Last Emperor."

Based on a novel by the Italian author Alessandro Baricco  that I will assume was more coherent than this mess of an adaptation, Francois Girards Silk stars Michael Pitt  as Herve, a confused-looking French silkworm trader sent on a mission to Japan  by his boss, Baldabiou (Alfred Molina , trying his best). While there, he becomes infatuated with a concubine (Sei Ashina), despite the fact that they only see each other about twice and never exchange a word. Meanwhile, waiting for Herve at home is his fetching wife Helene (Keira Knightley , who isnt given much to do but bat her eyelashes and loll around in a field of lilies). Silk isnt just bad. Its utterly mad. It stutters and hiccups from scene to scene, from country to country, but never once does it make narrative or emotional sense. The scenes in France are a series of goopy, sentimental tableaux worthy of Bouguereau. The scenes in Japan are full of lush, white mists and little else. Girard is not only uncritically preoccupied with that nations Othernessthe mystic Orientbut also with the female body. The camera treats Helene and her Japanese counterpart as pretty knickknacks, silent vessels for Herves uninspiring, aimless lust.
