Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have once again combined their efforts to create a big Hollywood biopic that exudes the strong whiff of Oscar bait. Like 2001�s A Beautiful Mind
, Cinderella Man
 selects an almost too-good-to-be-true public figure and, with an assist from screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, turns the story into one of individual triumph over great adversity. In A Beautiful Mind
, the title subject�s struggle was with the personal demon of mental illness; in Cinderella Man
 the boogeyman is the Great Depression � a public scourge that hobbled a country, but again it�s the individual who overcomes the adversity, not the nation. Still, using the fairy-tale nickname of the boxing contender Jim Braddock (Crowe) as the title of their movie, the filmmakers show that they wish to perpetuate this "great man" approach to history in which the exceptional individual triumphs over the odds and therefore keeps hope alive for the rest of us slobs. Cinderella Man
 is the grandest "feel good" movie to come along in a while, one that uses the Depression as atmospheric background and a love story for narrative heft to create an overlong saga that wishes to inspire, uplift, and engage the masses. Cinderella Man
 follows the basic formula and clich�s of the boxing picture: A rookie with talent and moxie shows great early promise but is sidelined by an injury and then gets a long-shot chance to recapture his title and glory. Where Howard�s film differs from most boxing movies is that Braddock doesn�t chase women and booze: He�s not a victim of his own bad habits and choices, he�s only a victim of bad luck (he breaks his hand), the capricious Boxing Commission that revokes his license, and � like everyone else � the Depression. We see Braddock and his devoted wife, Mae (Zellweger in a thankless, underwritten role), go from middle-class comfort at the beginning of the film to a spartan, unheated basement apartment where the health of their three kids is always at risk from starvation and hypothermia. As much as the film tries to portray Braddock as a regular guy, the "Bulldog of Bergen, the Pride of New Jersey" is really an exemplary figure: He brings his payouts straight home to his wife, he resists taking welfare or asking for handouts (and when he finally breaks down and does, it becomes the film�s most emotional scene), he�s a loving and involved father and kind to his friends, and an onscreen epilogue enumerates all the wonderful things Braddock accomplished in his post-boxing career. He�s a saint in the flesh, but not one who inspires great drama. Howard and cinematographer Salvatore Totino get great material in the ring during the action sequences, but Jim and Mae are sluggish characters to watch for any length. We�ve seen both these actors do similar work before, albeit not with their Hackensack by way of Perth and Waco accents. More attention is likely to be showered on supporting actors Bierko (as the sneering, imperious Max Baer, who had killed two men in the ring) and Giamatti (as the boxing promoter Joe Gould), who has also done much better work before but may earn the sympathy vote after his Academy dis for Sideways
. Like the soft-focused sepia tones that characterize all the film�s backgrounds, Cinderella Man
 reflects us back to ourselves through the gauzy blur of a manmade scrim.


Maybe it was all that Opie time on ''The Andy Griffith Show," but Ron Howard has always had a streak of Norman Rockwell in him -- a trust in the gritty pieties of faith, family, and personal re-invention in which the American myth is rooted. Howard's inner Rockwell finally comes out of the closet with ''Cinderella Man," after years of flirtations (''Apollo 13") and backing away (''The Missing"), and the result is a broad, foursquare piece of populist filmmaking that happens to be tremendously moving.
If you're the sort of occasional moviegoer who feels they don't make 'em like they used to -- well, you're right. Except that Howard and Russell Crowe have just proved you wrong.
It's a boxing film, and one in the classic mold -- closer to a fusion of ''Rocky" and ''Seabiscuit" than ''Raging Bull" or anything Clint Eastwood was up to in ''Million Dollar Baby" -- but it also immerses a viewer in the terrible, grinding poverty of the Great Depression. The true story of James J. Braddock (Crowe), a heavyweight contender and gentle family man whose career peaked early and crashed with the stock market in the late 1920s, it's a comeback saga so unbelievable that it had to have happened more or less like this.
Yet a palpable sense of despair sucks any feel-good simple-mindedness out of the film. People die in the streets of ''Cinderella Man," and in the ring, too. One heads into the final rounds dreadfully unsure where it will end, and that's a testament to both Howard's skill and his conviction.
It's also because we've seen how low Braddock and his family can sink, while understanding that millions of people are sinking lower. When his oldest boy (Connor Price) steals a salami from a store, the father makes him return it, quietly chiding him that ''there are others worse off than what we are." This is just before the gas and electricity get turned off in the dead of winter; a single, eloquent shot of a sleeping child's steaming breath is all the movie needs to convey parental panic.
By 1934, Braddock is working the New Jersey docks -- or, rather, standing with hundreds of other dour-faced men outside the gates, hoping for work. There's an awful scene in which the boxer goes to the old Madison Square Garden and beards the fight men in their smoky den, begging for a handout -- the moment aches with shame and necessity. Then his old manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) appears with a one-time offer: A boxer has dropped out of a match with an up-and-coming heavyweight, $250, win or lose. ''For $250, I'd fight your wife," Braddock responds.
When he steps back into the ring, the radio announcer snorts that ''it looks like they dug old Jim Braddock up," and the dreamy, smiling look on Crowe's face is inscrutable. Is he taking one last look at the crowd before they turn away forever? Or is he grinning because he knows they're about to be shocked? ''Cinderella Man" charts the course of the comeback step by step, fight by fight, gauging the growing fascination of the press and the public, but it makes clear that the boxer never had a game plan. Every extra inch, however temporary, is a gift to a man who can say, ''At least I know what's hitting me."
The writer Damon Runyon coined the nickname ''Cinderella Man," and Howard leans overly hard on Braddock's inspirational meaning to the man in the street. He cranks up the villainy of defending heavyweight champion Max Baer, played by Craig Bierko as a preening, pomaded instrument of death, and he milks the boxing sequences -- shot with an in-your-face immediacy that owes a lot to Scorsese -- for all they're worth.
Worse, the movie paints Renee Zellweger into a corner of sour-faced hand-wringing. The actress plays Braddock's wife, Mary, as a pillar of little-woman pluck; she stands by her man and worries he won't come home and never rises above cliche. I don't know which screenwriter, Cliff Hollingsworth or Akiva Goldsman, is responsible for her line, ''You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock," but Zellweger deserves to take a couple of pops at both of them for it.
But this is a love story between men, as boxing movies tend to be, and the relationship between Braddock and his manager is intensely affecting, full of bluff and bravado and early-talkies vinegar. If Giamatti wins a supporting Oscar for this, as he deserves to, it won't be a make-good for this year's ''Sideways" oversight. In his hands, Joe Gould becomes a quintessentially 1930s mixture of pep and desperation -- Giamatti bears an uncanny resemblance here to the old character actor Ned Sparks -- and he, more than anyone in the movie, understands the tension between greed and hope that drives professional boxing. ''We both know the name of this game," he says to a fat-cat boxing promoter (Bruce McGill), ''and it sure as hell ain't pugilism."
As for Crowe, would Jim Braddock be as interesting if he were played by anyone else? I doubt it. Movie nobility too easily turns self-congratulatory, but Crowe has the physical bulk to make a believable palooka, and he gives grace and edge to the character's innate decency. Asked by a reporter what he's fighting for this time around, Braddock replies, ''Milk," and the actor conveys both the confidence behind the statement and the gnawing fear. ''Cinderella Man" re-creates a time when that fear was the governing emotion of American daily life, and says it was possible, with luck and gumption, to fight back. It's the beautiful lie our movies have always handed us -- only this time it's true.


         "Cinderella Man" tells James J. Braddock's story, but it does not share the boxer's confidence. While the real-life Braddock had enough belief in himself to accomplish miracles in the ring, this filmed biography's reluctance to have faith in its intended audience undercuts its chances to deliver complete satisfaction.
 
  Certainly this true story of a heavyweight champion so unlikely he lifted Depression-weary hearts, a saga already being referred to as "Fistbiscuit" because of its parallels to a certain celebrated horse, is hard to improve on for innate drama. The Times of London said "it makes 'Rocky' look like reality TV," and writer Damon Runyon, who knew a tale or two himself, insisted, "In all the history of the boxing game, you'll find no human interest story to compare."
 


         






    With Russell Crowe in the title role, "Cinderella Man" also has an actor you never want to bet against, no matter what the odds. In fact, Crowe's impressive work as Braddock, his ability to bring integrity as well as skill to his performance, demonstrates why he's the most accomplished actor of his generation's major stars, someone whose ability makes this film succeed more than it should.
 
  Set against the virtues of story and star are "Cinderella Man's" other, more problematic elements. For one thing, the fighter was far from dramatic ("not a very interesting guy" is producer Brian Grazer's candid description) outside the ring. For another, so much time is spent inside the ring that viewers may start to feel battered themselves. And then there is costar Renée Zellweger, who gives one of her more mannered, unconvincing performances as Braddock's loyal and loving wife, Mae.
 
  But the real difficulty is the sensibility of director Ron Howard. After a brief flirtation with the dark side with his sadly underrated western "The Missing," Howard is back making feel-good movies, and doing so with an earnestness that is counterproductive. Like the stereotypical Jewish mother who hampers appetites by insistently prodding children to "eat, eat," Howard hurts our ability to enjoy this good story by pushing its plot points too insistently.
 
  While it is in the nature of the filmmaking process to manipulate the audience, working with his screenwriter of choice, "A Beautiful Mind's" Akiva Golds-man (who here rewrote original writer Cliff Hollingsworth), Howard pulls strings so obviously it makes even reality resemble a setup. "Cinderella Man's" key emotional moments feel as if they've been predigested for an audience that can't be trusted to feel things for itself but needs to be firmly albeit lovingly pointed in the appropriate direction.
 
  This overprotectiveness even extends to the film's look. Though cinematographer Salvatore Totino says in the press notes that "Ron wanted to draw out the grittiness of the period," the beautifully shot Braddock family never look other than glossy Hollywood poor no matter how dire their circumstances get. The setting brings to mind one of biographer A. Scott Berg's stories about producer Samuel Goldwyn, who was observed removing trash from the set of the Lower East Side drama "Dead End" and muttering, "There won't be any dirty slums — not in my 
picture!"
 
  Things are considerably less grim when "Cinderella Man" begins in 1928. The economy is booming and so is the career of Braddock, New Jersey's celebrated "Bulldog of Bergen" who happily returns to his wife, three kids and cozy single family home after another victory under the tutelage of manager-trainer Joe Gould (a solid Paul Giamatti).
 
  Cut to 1933. Four years into the Depression, the Braddocks, though still in love, are living hand to mouth in a dingy basement flat. Bad as things are, they soon get worse. After a particularly unimpressive performance in which he breaks his right hand, the fighter is dramatically told by promoter Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) that his license to box is being revoked. In reality, the injured Braddock retired, possibly because he heard a revocation was in the offing, but nuances like those are not what a film like this is about.
 
  Determined to feed his family no matter what, Braddock gets work at "On the Waterfront"-type shape-ups on the Jersey docks, where his hands get strengthened and he meets Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine), a down-on-his-luck leftist who is meant to stand in for all the radicalized regular guys who lost their jobs in the Depression.
 
  And just because times are tough, don't think Braddock is the type to walk away from his parental responsibilities. He's the kind of father we all wish we had, progressive enough to teach his little girl how to box but still deeply committed to traditional values. "No matter what happens," he lectures his oldest son, "we don't steal. Not ever." No matter how conventional "Cinderella Man's" dramatic situations are, Crowe has the gift to make them convincing. He is the rare matinee idol who can transform, can actually become other people. The situations may be cornball or contrived, but if Crowe is selling, we are buying, no questions asked.
 
  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Zellweger, who does not bring the same level of conviction to the fighter's spouse. Not the first actress to have trouble staying on the screen with Crowe (only "Beautiful Mind's" Jennifer Connelly really succeeded), Zellweger's Mae gets more twitchy and irritating as her husband's fortunes improve and a championship fight with the threatening Max Baer (an engaging Craig Bierko) looks possible. The actress ends up trying too hard to be believable in situations that ought to be second nature.
 
  But then, going too far in restating the obvious is what shortchanges "Cinderella Man's" virtues from the opening bell to the close.

How exceptional a film actor is Russell Crowe? So exceptional that in Cinderella Man , he makes a good boxing movie feel at times like a great, big picture. Playing James J. Braddock, a real-life decent, downtrodden New Jersey underdog whose unlikely triumph as the heavyweight boxing champ of the world during the depths of America's Great Depression was spun as a victory for all decent, downtrodden Americans everywhere who hungered for a second chance, Crowe does something  I can't figure out what  that morphs the very shape of his head. He's done this before, changing physical and emotional contours to play a whistle-blower, a mathematician, a ship's captain, a Maximus, all of them men's men fighting for personal integrity in a man's world. But each time the intensity of the transformation feels complete, and unexpected; there's not another actor working in the movies today with Crowe's kind of gravitational pull to authenticity, to unactorliness.
And so in Cinderella Man  he's a whole new size all over again, this time scaled to the proportions of a family man, adored by and adoring his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and their three kids. In the beginning, Braddock is a lucky bruiser with a happy grin  who wins in the ring, with support from his loyal, chipper trainer-manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti in yet another knockout perf  that's three in a row), and enjoys a comfortable home thanks to the talent of his gloved fists. Then he's a loser whose luck turns miserably bad, then a Depression-era casualty reduced to rock-bottom poverty  no money for food or electricity, nothing but love for heat, a despairing citizen on the dole. And then, luck turns again: Gould scrapes up one more unlikely fight, and Braddock wins. (Giamatti and Crowe get on like gangbusters, two powerhouses sparring.) Then he wins another, and another, leading to a climactic showdown at Madison Square Garden  the Kentucky Derby, let's say, if the underdog were that other Depression-era American underanimal, Seabiscuit  against the cocksure, high-living, literally lethal heavyweight champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko, in a career-expanding, triumphant performance).
And in each round of Ron Howard's classically told saga (from a script by Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth), right up through the pummeling 15-round Baer-vs.-Braddock bout that decides the title, Crowe adjusts his molecular size with athletic ease: He's substantial, he's fading, he's a wreck of a man (cap in hand, literally), he's a guy who picks himself up and gets back on his feet, at no time telegraphing that being on his feet is where he'll stay.
I make much of Crowe's dramatic integrity because without it, what is being touted as Howard's ''grittiest'' picture would lose a fair measure of its grit  the downside of a project that wants to be not just about the blood-and-bone brutality and primal excitement of boxing, where men offer one another their bruisable bodies as collateral, but also about big themes, including hardship, Yankee resolve, American decency, and the spiritual uplift provided by a close-knit family. And Cinderella Man 's impeccably designed,  authentic-enough-looking scenes of just how dire living conditions really were for millions (subtext: Could it happen again?) would dissipate into fussy diversions without Crowe's participation.
As it is, a fact-based reenactment of the moment Braddock repays the nice lady at the government handout office with earnings from his comeback fights is made right primarily by Crowe's clean, nonpolitical conviction of gesture. On the other hand, left to their own imaginings, the filmmakers feel compelled to invent a gauzy fictional anti-Braddock, a fellow dockworker and down-and-outer named Mike (In America 's Paddy Considine) whose own fall, in contrast to his buddy's, is unbroken: Mike drinks too much, fights with his wife, and gets too caught up in political activism for his own good, taking to the squalid, end-of-hope shanties dubbed Hooverville in New York's Central Park as his last stand. The attention to Hooverville (a thing worth seeing for young 'uns, shot with hushed outrage and awe by cinematographer Salvatore Totino, who also worked on The Missing ) is, at least, educational.
In the end, when all the metaphors for character and spirit and American history fall away, a boxing movie, whether Raging Bull , Rocky , or Million Dollar Baby , is about boxing, and the elemental physical intimacy inside the ropes. And here, Howard comes alive with a directness and excitement that matches what Crowe has been up to all along. The fight that decides the championship is long, painful, and dirty, with punches that sting us as much as they stagger Braddock. Endurance is what counts. Despite a few flashbacks to remember what the common guy is fighting for, it's all about the body blows. And the best man wins.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Supporting Actor (Paul Giamatti); Best Film Editing; Best Makeup

n June 13, 1935, the boxer James J. Braddock fought the fight of a lifetime. Born in Hell's Kitchen when that New York neighborhood still warranted that  rough-and-tumble epithet, the 30-year-old heavyweight was the son of immigrants whose bloodlines and hardscrabble woes traced back to Ireland. Said to have weighed more than 17 pounds at birth, the adult Braddock tipped the scales around 190, stood nearly  6-foot-3 and was in the possession of a 75-inch reach. His most famous opponent, the Livermore Larruper, Max Baer, had an 81-inch reach, bringing him dauntingly close to Braddock's lopsided grin. In "Cinderella Man," his movie about Braddock and the fight of his life, the director Ron Howard brings you viscerally close to understanding how that sideways smile was almost erased. Played by Russell Crowe with moist eyes and restless animal vigor, the pugilist known as the Cinderella Man entered the ring against Baer (an excellent Craig Bierko) with the odds 10-to-1  against him. The story of how this well-regarded boxer down on his luck faced those odds is one of the most celebrated in American sport, so it's a wonder it has never before been told on-screen. Filled with ups and heartbreaking downs, it is a story that can put a lump in your throat, though given Mr. Howard's inclination toward hokum, a lump on which you might easily gag. Mr. Howard begins his film with a quote from Damon Runyon, who bequeathed Braddock his fairy-tale nickname. (According to Jeremy Schaap's fast-moving book, also titled "Cinderella Man," the fighter was more prosaically known as Irish Jim Braddock.) The Runyon quote constitutes the best writing in the film, which features a serviceable screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and the higher-profile Akiva Goldsman. Mr. Goldsman also wrote Mr. Howard's much-lauded, multiple Academy Award-winning film, "A Beautiful Mind," a work similarly steeped in nostalgia and hooey, the latter exemplified by the image of Mr. Crowe corrugating his meaty brow to play a tormented math genius. Mr. Crowe, a vibrantly physical screen presence, looks far more persuasive slicked with sweat and slugging other men. In 1928, the year "Cinderella Man" opens, Braddock seemed to have all the right moves. Then a light heavyweight, the boxer was young, supremely healthy and both talented enough and dumb enough to earn a good living with his fists. The Crash changed his fortune as well as his optimistic outlook, and thereafter Braddock entered an agonizing downward spiral. Within a few years, he and his wife, Mae, played in the film by Ren�e Zellweger as a sniffling, squinting Kewpie doll, were living in a basement apartment with their young children and trying to keep the wolf from the door. In 1934, when his  manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), asked Braddock if he wanted a fight, the boxer was wielding a baling hook on the Jersey docks. Almost a year had passed since his last bout. Like Gary Ross's "Seabiscuit," the legend of the little Depression-era horse that could, "Cinderella Man" is a shamefully ingratiating old-fashioned weepie. To his credit, Mr. Howard does not wave the flag as vigorously as Mr. Ross, though the new film's tagline ("When America was on its knees, he brought us to our feet") prepares you for the worst. In any event, given that Mr. Howard and his writers would be hard-pressed to bend this underdog narrative to our current political nightmare, it's a good thing they don't venture down that path. And with this material, there really is no need. Lightly stained a nicotine brown and topped by two male actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans, the film is as calculating and glossy a hard-luck tale as any cooked up on the old M-G-M lot. The Braddock and Baer match affords the film its climax, but it's the face-off between Mr. Crowe and Mr. Giamatti that gives it bite. Neither performer is at the top of his form here - Mr. Crowe's crowning achievement remains "The Insider," Mr. Giamatti's, unsurprisingly, is "Sideways" - but they duet nicely. Mr. Crowe, his face more sharply beveled than it has been in years,  plays Braddock as a reluctant warrior, a good guy who seems almost abashed to lead with his fists. The actor doesn't pump up the heroics, which would have been a poor fit for the unassuming Braddock, but breathes life into the Everyman that both the country and its sportswriters needed. Out of the ring and opposite Mr. Giamatti, Mr. Crowe eases into the boxer's soft side, at times beautifully; in the ring, he's repulsively believable. Mr. Giamatti does a lot of his acting with his eyebrows, which doesn't make the performance any less enjoyable. Gould was as much fixer as manager, and the actor makes you see the man's every angle as cleanly as if they were drawn with a ruler and compass. In his book, Mr. Schaap repeats one contemporary observer's theory that if Gould had been a better manager, Braddock would not have  suffered so many career downturns. Mr. Howard and his collaborators don't test those particular murky waters, but they make sure we see boxing is an ugly game no matter how likable the players. In one of the most effective scenes, Gould frantically urges Braddock to break his opponent's nose and "fill his face with blood." This is a fight movie where the blood doesn't dribble. With a killer of a sports story and two top-flight actors, Mr. Howard can't go terribly wrong. A fine craftsman, the director  has in recent films been drawn to increasingly darker themes, perhaps because, in the age-old calculus of mainstream production, dark equals heft. In his last film, "The Missing," a taut western pegged to the hoariest frontier clich� (white women kidnapped by marauding Indians), Mr. Howard employed a somber palette and let (or just watched) his two leads, Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones, cut loose. The director pretty much repeats the same formula here, aided by the same talented cinematographer he used for "The Missing," Salvatore Totino, and his longtime editors Mike Hill and Dan Hanley, whose hard cutting intensifies the blunt force of every punch. The fights are brutal, at times floridly so, and crucial to the film's own blunt force. Like some musical song-and-dance numbers, they break into the main storyline, providing much-needed relief from Braddock's gratingly soft-focus marriage. Taken together, the fights also create a leaner, meaner parallel narrative. One of the satisfactions of "Cinderella Man" is that, in the end, the story that unfolds inside the ring is not the same one that Mr. Howard, his screenwriters and the composer Thomas Newman seem keen to sell. Their Cinderella Man is the decent little guy who affirms what movie people call the triumph of the human spirit. The story Mr. Crowe tells, with Mr. Giamatti riding shotgun as a gleeful Mephistopheles, is that of a man who, having sampled the blood of others, clearly enjoyed the taste. "Cinderella Man" is rated PG-13  (Parents strongly cautioned). The fight scenes are intensely violent and, at times,  protracted.

An exquisite ode to a working-class hero, "Cinderella Man" takes the almost impossibly perfect elements of the saga of underdog boxer James J. Braddock and fills it with emotional gravitas, wrenching danger and a panoramic sense of American life during the Great Depression. Oscar winner "A Beautiful Mind" seems a warmup to this main event, in which helmer Ron Howard grasps the full measure of artistry he's often reached for, and gifted thesp Russell Crowe limns a role he seems born to play. Universal's summer release strategy seems riskier than Braddock's final bout, but solid, sustained B.O. boosted by glowing critical response -- with a late-round re-release during awards season -- could deliver winning results. 
It's unavoidable to compare Braddock's arc of triumph -- from contender to washed-up club fighter to heavyweight championship challenger -- with the story of Seabiscuit. But "Cinderella Man" far outpaces that pic, thanks to an exceptionally developed story, a roster of career-worthy performances and a hero who can speak.
Despite its seemingly simplistic outline of a can-do spirit triumphing during the Depression the film plumbs the angry depths Howard sounded in his tough, underappreciated Western "The Missing," and only hinted at before that.
Howard, with screenwriters Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman, exhibits a loving understanding of Warners' raw 1930s films of desperate working-class lives and hard-scrabble heroes, and of the boxing genre from "Champion" to "Raging Bull."
Crowe's Braddock is a good family man of stalwart but never self-destructive pride who explains his reason for boxing is to put milk on his kids' table.
Making the connection between Braddock's career trajectory and the nation's fortunes, the film somewhat excessively superimposes dates and locations to briefly chronicle his ring successes of the '20s, and his losses just as the Depression hit. By 1932, Braddock was broke.
Pic is divided between Braddock's struggles at home and his unprecedented comeback. Both aspects are brilliantly supported -- the first by Renee Zellweger as Braddock's plucky wife, Mae, the second by Paul Giamatti as his trusty trainer/manager Joe Gould.
A gentle pan shot shifts from the Braddocks' comfy home during the good times to a bleak one-room cold-water flat four years later in New Jersey, where Braddock, Mae and kids Jay, Rosemarie and Howard scrape by. When Jay (Connor Price) is caught stealing a sausage from a meat store, Braddock treats him with understanding and assures the boy he won't be sent to live with richer relatives.
Things get worse. Braddock is so inept in a 1933 bout that his boxing license is revoked. He winds up looking for work on the Hoboken loading docks (the location of "On the Waterfront").
He finds an ally in co-worker Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine), a former Wall Street broker-turned-radical and the film's most significant fictional creation. A measure of the script's craft is how well Mike is integrated with the reality-based characters, serving as a way for the pic to comment on the politics of the times.
Braddock reaches bottom in a sequence that a more insistent director might have pushed over the top, when Mae sends the kidsoff to relatives while Braddock is away at work. Pale and drawn, Crowe looks like the life is being sucked out of him as he realizes Mae's well-intentioned action means his promise to Jay has been broken.
Begging for change from his former boxing associates at a Madison Square Garden hangout, Braddock is reunited with Joe on the offer of a one-time match.
Gradually, the workings of the sweet science and the business behind it take the forefront, somewhat backgrounding Mae (who makes a point of never attending a bout). Yet Zellweger's side of the story continues to provide surprising moments, as when she discovers Joe and wife Lucille (Linda Kash, in an aces cameo) are so determined to maintain appearances that they live in their gorgeous apartment sans furniture.
Final hour ratchets up the tension as Braddock counters skeptics and wins matches, ultimately earning a bout with ferocious heavyweight champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko). Pic shows the magnitude of the mountain Braddock must climb when a promoter shows Braddock film of Baer's roundhouse punches killing opponents.
If there's any complaint in the finely judged lead-up to the climax, it's in the easy way the pic paints Baer as the bad guy. Result is a far less dimensional Baer than in Jeremy Schaap's new Braddock biography (also "Cinderella Man," both borrowed their titles from colorful scribe Damon Runyon).
As the grueling match develops, and Baer's seeming supremacy is challenged by Braddock's wiliness, the champ's emerging desperation suddenly makes Bierko's cocky superstar human.
Fight scenes are consistently well-drawn and balanced (by editors Mike Hill and Dan Hanley) between close-ups, long shots and reaction shots around the ring, with a deliberate lack of filmic fanciness. The structural mastery of the Baer fight results in a marvelously tense movie-within-a-movie that raises the bar for the fight genre.
Pre-credit notes about Braddock's and Mae's life afterward feel anticlimactic, but provide a moment to consider the actual pummeling Crowe and Bierko went through for the cameras.
Taking this performance alongside his work on "Master and Commander," it's reasonable to place Crowe in the company of the leading men who brought great humanity to classical roles, from Spencer Tracy to James Stewart. As Braddock, Crowe's eyes have never seemed so full of unspoken sadness and ferocity, with his body language ranging from spent hopelessness to a single coiled muscle preparing to strike.
Interplay with Zellweger is electric, with both matched step for step by Giamatti, in a performance that many will far prefer to his turn in "Sideways." Indeed, Giamatti is the film's onscreen audience, showing his pain at Braddock's flubs and amazement by his turnaround.
Overall casting by Howard, Jane Jenkins and Janet Hirshenson is inspired.
Lenser Salvatore Totino, who did excellent work in "The Missing," has a more ambitious range of images and moods here, and creates a virtual gallery of Depression life from the most intimate to the most cosmopolitan. Wynn Thomas' sensitive production design is remarkably human-scale for this kind of pic.Thomas Newman's score, blessedly short on Irish motifs, is the only element a bit too in love with its own sense of grandness.

Catherine Hardwicke  turns from girl problems to boy problems for Lords of Dogtown , translating Thirteen 's Angeleno teen ennui into a narrative account of the early days of skateboarding, adapted by screenwriter Stacy Peralta  from his documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys . Leaner and sharper than its fast-and-furious TV spots would let on, Lords  follows the fortunes of four skating pioneers: strutting Tony Alva  (Raising Victor Vargas  's Victor Rasuk , turned West Coast bro), brooding badass Jay Adams  (Emile Hirsch ), nebbishy runt Sid (Michael Angarano ), and teen Peralta (Elephant 's baby-faced John Robinson ), scripted by his adult self as an uptight skate wonk.
The crew starts as a gaggle of miniature beach punks, incubating in a Venice Beach  of rotting piers, zonked-out hippie parents, and the chaotic surf shop of low-rent entrepreneur Skip Engblom portrayed by Heath Ledger  as a humanoid Spuds MacKenzie  with a fly-catching SoCal drawlwho assembles the Z-Boys into a ratty competition team. Once they're recognized for their street-savvy innovative skills by the impresarios of the nascent pro circuit, Alva and Peralta zip vertically into scene stardom, while Adams descends into poorly sponsored cholo -esque delinquency, complete with bandanna and flannel.
Punctuated with legitimately engagingaction bits, grimy pavement-level sound recording, and the occasional blink of wheel-cam, the film's well-cast character study counterbalances its function as self-hagiog-raphy; Peralta carefully paints his generation with kindly brushstrokes (after positioning himself as good-kid center, whose only sin is working too hard) while skate-culture cameos by Tony Hawk  and Johnny Knoxville  (as usual, dealing instant scene death with every line) provide expected insider fan service. Channeling Amy Heckerling  for the post-emo era, Hardwicke's pop-Cassavetes melodrama nevertheless rides as smoothly as a big-budget after-school special, capturing youth struggles from an appropriately blown-out teen's-eye perspective. Parents and their professional analogues are fallible agents of love, handicapped by their own eternal West Coast adolescence. The director stagflates the film's hardscrabble '70s environs until one can almost hear the dull clinking of food stamp tokens inside a macramé purse, providing the protags with a survival-level rationale for selling out as fast as their little urethane wheels will take them.
Such is the logic of the sports biopic, in which flights of talent and ambition need best be undergirded by a morally correct narrative engine, powered by existential necessity; audiences forgive the rumbling of a stomach before the feeding of an ego. So Dogtown  's grubby recession looks like a playground romp next to Cinderella Man 's ashen Depression-era setting, an all the more appropriate motivation for its boxer-hero's brutally agonistic slugfests. Russell Crowe  updates his Gladiator  role to the 20th century, portraying real-life prizefighter Jim Braddock  as a ringside messiah whose own late-career comeback from washed-up working-class punching bag to world champeen not only feeds his starving family, but provides the sallow-fleshed masses withcoughsomething to believe in.
Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard  spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment. Paul Giamatti  fast-talks as Braddock's suspendered manager, Joe Gould , playing the role of supportive man-spouse, after his real wife (Renée Zellweger ) hennishly urges him away from pugilism. Beat down by the nation's economic bottoming-out, Braddock lets out his class rage on the bodies of fellow travelers (in the ring, he says, "at least I know who's hittin' me") until he reaches the ultimate anger object: hulking pretty-boy Hollywood -type Max Baer  (Craig Bierko ), complete with flossy showgirl entourage and the acme of '30s rich-male villain wear, a leonine fur coat. Having killed two opponents, Baer long-arms his literally deadly head blows with a showy grin; he's a mere monocle away from functioning as a populist caricature of ruthless capitalism itself.
Howard keeps the action tight, with most of the plot used as elaborate and efficient setup for the film's climactic 20-minute battle. A few period details go a long way: Gould's barren upper-middle-class apartment, emptied of all but the attitude of wealth; sports reporters jamming on stand-up typewriters flush against ringside; Zellweger and kids stealing wood from an Esso sign after their electricity has been shut off; a boxer with a gnarly, potato-like face straight out of a WPA painting. Aside from a handful of fairy-tale motifs, riffing on the Damon Runyon -coined title, the most enigmatic reference seems to be thrown in for obscure historical touch: a bank of coming-attractions posters advertising S.O.S. Iceberg , a Leni Riefenstahl  mountain film. Not quite enough for a WW II omen, they might hint at seeing Cinderella Man  as a mythic-democratic Triumph of the Will .
Future analysts of American culture may be just as perplexed at the Adam Sandler -Chris Rock  remake of '70s comedy The Longest Yard , in which a ragtag football team of multicultural prison inmates is assembled to hit the gridiron against a steroided phalanx of Aryan Southern guardsand will no doubt ponder why an incarceration-crazy society ends up rooting for the objects of its own control anxiety as comedic underdogs. Add to this otherwise painless comedy an unmysterious obsession with feminized men as objects of ridicule, from a cleverly grotesque troupe of prison bitch cheerleaders to a tedious peppering of fops and faggots. No uplifting populism here: In a man's world, even the underdogs get their own underdogs to piss on.
