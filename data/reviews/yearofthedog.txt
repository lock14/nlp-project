         If someone took you to see "A Mike White Film," your expectations might range from the iconoclastic, "Chuck and Buck," to the quirkily mainstream, "School of Rock." With "The Good Girl," "Orange County" and "Nacho Libre" falling somewhere in between on the scale of provocativeness, White is one of the few contemporary screenwriters with a strong enough voice to persist through a variety of directors.
 
 That said, the unfiltered White makes his directing debut with "Year of the Dog," a scruffy personal comedy about a woman whose devotion to her dog leads to profound changes in her life. With pathos competing equally against the often pungent laughs for the audience's attention, it's a movie that is both unsettling and amusing, most comparable to "Chuck & Buck" in tone.
 


         






   Molly Shannon stars as Peggy, who might be described as a cat lady except that her beloved pet is a dog. She's a prettily plain, 40ish secretary who has more or less written off the human race when it comes to long-term companionship. That void is filled by the adorable pup, Pencil, who is the center of Peggy's life, her reason to get up in the morning and the face that eagerly greets her when she comes home from work at night.
 
 When Pencil meets an untimely demise, it sends Peggy into a whirlwind of animal rights activism, partly inspired by a sweet-natured dog trainer and pet-adoption activist named Newt (played with gentle ambiguity by Peter Sarsgaard). Peggy's new obsession has an adverse effect on her job and her relationships with her family and friends, but White maintains a careful balance between mocking her and building empathy.
 
 Peggy shares the child-like qualities of many of White's characters: Buck's doggedness, Holden's delusional romanticism in "The Good Girl," Dewey's enthusiasm in "School of Rock." Her innocence is probably her most charming trait but also the thing that sets her up for the big fall whenever she's faced with bad news. Peggy makes a series of disastrous choices, but White does an excellent job of immersing us in the story to the point where their cumulative effect catches us off-guard.
 
 Shannon, in a part written specifically for her, lets a lot of Peggy's emotion inch across her face in stealthy discoveries.
 
 As a writer, White has always been a practitioner of the cinema of discomfort, creating scenes that are at once off-putting and mesmerizing. As a director, he proves equally adept at mining the elongated awkward moment for both laughter and emotion.
 
 His characters operate in a zone of obliviousness, talking but not really listening to one another. The film is built on scenes between Peggy and the various people in her life in which we are usually way ahead of the characters. However, the train-wreck quality of the encounters makes it impossible to turn away.
 
 Every character has his or her own obsession — be it an engagement ring for Peggy's co-worker Layla (Regina King), hunting for her neighbor Al (John C. Reilly) or corporate success for her boss, Robin (Josh Pais) — making it impossible for any of them to connect with Peggy. Even her brother, Pier (Tom McCarthy), and sister-in-law, Bret (Laura Dern), treat her as a sweet eccentric while they smother their two young children in an overprotective cocoon.
 
 White and Shannon also do something very interesting with Peggy's political awakening. She's portrayed as undeniably kooky, and when she bottoms out she's way down there, but it's a far cry from the stereotypical, one-joke-and-out portrayal of those seeking a cruelty-free lifestyle. Peggy is nothing but sincere, and her evolution of consciousness is entirely credible. The film questions the stance and asks some hard questions but ultimately presents it with a degree of acceptance.
 
 For what is essentially a comedy, there is a lot of tragedy in "Year of the Dog," and the immediate effect may be that it's a bummer of a movie. But White is a clever writer, and many of his best lines will sneak up on you long after you leave the theater. There's a stealthy sweetness to the movie, a desire to understand those who go their own way, that would seem to be his ultimate aim.
 
 
 "Year of the Dog." MPAA rating: PG-13 for some suggestive references. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. In selected theaters.   

I mean no impertinence when I say that as a portrait of love and grief, writer-director Mike White's exceptional film Year of the Dog  deserves the same admiration accorded Joan Didion's exceptional memoir The Year of Magical Thinking . True, Didion's crystalline prose describes the author's sense of widowhood following the death of her husband, while White's fearlessly uncomfortable movie describes the pain of a fictional singleton named Peggy (Molly Shannon) following the death of her pet beagle, Pencil. But the depth of loss felt by Peggy for Pencil is expressed with observations just as acute and honest as any in Didion's lauded account. And an amazing, translucent Shannon is fearless too in exposing Peggy's naked sadness.
What happens is, when Pencil dies suddenly of toxic poisoning, Peggy falls apart. The contours of her self-protective, solo life as a good office worker, good friend, and good aunt to her brother's self-involved family can no longer contain her. And when shy attraction to an ambiguously asexual fellow animal lover (Peter Sarsgaard, brilliantly embodying banked male libido) isn't returned, she goes, honestly, a little crazy; mourning can do that. White's strength as a writer (The Good Girl , School of Rock ) has always been a stubbornly non-judgmental compassion for even the oddest of (human) ducks. Making an untidily fascinating directorial debut, the filmmaker introduces one such stray and gets us to respect her without pity.

 The wily and resourceful young screenwriter Mike White writes movies that seem as if they were cooked up by the skinny, self-consciously awkward guy who always ends up alone in a corner at the office holiday party. As it happens, Mr. White, who sometimes acts in the films he and others write, is a skinny, seemingly self-aware guy, though given his résumé — “Chuck & Buck,” “The Good Girl,” “School of Rock” and “Nacho Libre” — it’s a safe bet he doesn’t often play the wallflower, at least in Hollywood.  “Year of the Dog” is exactly the kind of story you would expect Mr. White to make for his directing debut. It’s funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means it’s also funny in a kind of existential way. It stars the comic Molly Shannon as a woman who discovers her true self through a love of animals, though not that kind of love. She’s not Catherine the Great, just Peggy the Good. It’s a film about what it means to devote yourself to something other than your  fears and desires, to shed that hard, durable shell called selfishness. It is, rather remarkably, an inquiry into empathy as a state of grace. And if that sounds too rarefied for laughs, rest assured, it’s also about a stone-cold beautiful freak.  That freak would be Peggy, who seems like a punch line in waiting. Unmarried and just north of 40, she lives with her sole companion, a sturdy little beagle named Pencil, in a tidy little house someplace in Southern California. She works as an assistant to some kind of numbers cruncher, Robin (the divine Josh Pais), on an office floor filled with cubicles that, from just the right angle, look remarkably like feedlot pens. It’s drab but pleasant enough, and anyway Peggy doesn’t seem to mind or notice. Every morning she brings a big pink box of doughnuts for everyone in the office to share, then soaks in the joy. At lunch she listens to her office mate Layla (Regina King) plot her love life with the cunning of Sun Tzu.  We are, during the opening of “Year of the Dog,” in seriously overtilled territory, somewhere between Alexander Payne and Todd Solondz. Mr. White lays out the narrow parameters of Peggy’s life with an aggressive lack of visual flair in a style that might be termed, to bend a phrase from Gloria Grahame, Late Nothing. His most obvious choice, one that feels like a misguided shortcut, is to arrange objects and people symmetrically — including Tom McCarthy and Laura Dern as Peggy’s obsessively matched brother and sister-in-law — inside the frame like displayed goods. It’s a standard-issue comedy strategy, fine for Barry Sonnenfeld-level laughs, but it also suggests that there’s nothing beneath these overly clean, tidy lines and, by extension, nothing much beneath Peggy, either.  This being a Mike White film, I was keeping my fingers crossed for more. One of the most talented screenwriters enlivening the commercial mainstream, Mr. White is a standard-bearer for freaks and geeks. (He worked on the critically revered television show  of the same name.) He boldly let his own freak flag fly in the 2000 pathology-driven comedy “Chuck & Buck,” in which, as a childlike man (Buck) who romantically stalks an old friend, he slithers under your skin, delivering an off-putting performance that deliberately risks turning a creepy story into an unlikable one. “Year of the Dog” limns less dangerous territory, but one of its modest glories is that here too Mr. White takes some appreciable chances with our sympathies, notably through  a leading character who has more in common with Buck than  might at first appear.  It takes a while, but Mr. White does peel away  his film’s surface banality.  What gets everything moving, including his somewhat sneakily or perhaps cautiously articulated intellectual interests (this is, after all, a studio-bankrolled comedy), is Pencil’s untimely death, which tears a hole in Peggy’s world and eventually her psyche. For Peggy, a woman who greets her beloved four-legged friend with a toothy smile that rivals the sun for warmth (Pencil shines right back), this isn’t the death of some adopted stray, one in a line of carelessly loved dumb beasts. It is a shock to the system, a life-altering tragedy, a terrible end that becomes — movingly, through one odd story kink after another — a radical new beginning.  Reader, she becomes a vegan. She also advocates and donates, destroys a couple of fur coats and takes her young niece and baby nephew to an animal sanctuary where rescued horses, cows, pigs and chickens roam about breathing fresh air with the green grass below and the blue sky above. Into the void left by Pencil she crams a couple and then a couple hundred and then thousands of abused and abandoned creatures, both by petition and by adoption, transforming into a kind of Angelina Jolie of the animal kingdom. She also finds what she hopes may be her Brad Pitt in the form of a pasty lump who volunteers at the A.S.P.C.A., ignoring or ignorant of the warning embedded in his name: Newt (Peter Sarsgaard, superb).  In other words Peggy becomes, at last, a fleshed-out character worth spending time with, not because she’s funny (she is) or nice (not always) or sympathetic (not necessarily). Instead it is precisely because she isn’t especially pleasant to be around, because she makes some wrong and, depending on your worldview and palate, some suspect choices — fermented soybean, for starters — that she and the film finally start to hum, whistle and work. After the story settles in, Ms. Shannon, who remains best known for her tenure on “Saturday Night Live,” fits Mr. White’s anti-intuitive purposes admirably, in large part because so much of the performance willfully goes against the grain, pushing at us with naked, frenzied need that can feel embarrassing and, at times, almost grotesque.  In its broad outline, “Year of the Dog” is the story of a woman who goes slightly bonkers and becomes an animal-rights advocate, not because she’s bonkers, but because the love of animals is where she finally finds her peace of mind, sense of self, grace. It’s also about the creation of conscience, about what makes us human and why, a surprisingly little-told story in contemporary American cinema.  You can learn a lot from our movies, like how to hold a gun and blow someone’s head off. It’s more unusual to watch a film in which the central struggle is how to be happy and sane. There’s a touch of the saint in Peggy, true, but what makes me love her is that she’s ridiculously, beautifully human.  “Year of the Dog” is Rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bring hankies.

Needy human animals straining against the leash of emotional expectations make Mike White's low-key "Year of the Dog" more situation tragedy than situation comedy. But Molly Shannon's bittersweet portrayal of its lonely canine-loving heroine, along with a passel of pups trying to steal the picture, make for a satisfyingand funny, if ironic, comedy intended for lovers of both the beast and/or sophisticated laughs.
Marvelously and subtly shot by cinematographer Tim Orr -- who creates wonderfully shiny, sterile surfaces under which White agitates his characters -- "Year of the Dog" centers around Peggy (Shannon), an office assistant with a wide gummy smile who's obsessively attached to her beagle, Pencil. When Pencil meets an untimely end, the guilt-wracked Peggy is left to find something to fill the void in her life, spent mostly doting on other people's children, treating her co-workers to daily donuts and otherwise making no impression on anyone's world but her own. 
Storyline is more episodic than linear. The humans she does meet -- asexual activist Newt (Peter Sarsgaard), her irritating super-mom sister-in-law Bret (Laura Dern) and her neurotic boss Robin (Josh Pais), all wonderfully portrayed -- don't offer much solace for Peggy. In a uniquely mismatched love interest, her increasing affinity for animals dooms her relationship with next-door neighbor and gun nut Al (John C. Reilly). So she goes to the dogs, literally and figuratively.
White, who has had a long comedic pedigree as a screenwriter, with such films as "The School of Rock," "The Good Girl" and "Chuck & Buck," makes his directing debut here, and the result is a full realization of the ironic undertones in his previous work. It's left to the individual viewer as to whether Peggy is simply a generous soul unappreciated by life or one so love-starved that animals fill the need she can't satisfy through human contact.
White is not a conventionally comic writer, and "Year of the Dog" is not a conventional comedy; both are fatalistically funny and resigned to the concept of unhappiness but generous enough to accept whatever a character may need to do to avoid it.

Speaking as the owner of a new puppy, I can say definitively that a dog is both more and less annoying than the average person. Year of the Dog makes much the same point with its pack of un- controllable pooches, including a cute beagle that rips into the wrong bag of treats and thereby makes an early widow of its master, Peggy (Molly Shannon ), a hypersensitive animal-lover who can't easily manage the loss.
Indie/studio mongrel Mike White , writer of Chuck & Buck  and The School of Rock (and oddball actor in both), here directs his latest geek's revenge fantasy like a psychotherapeutically treated Todd Solondz . His fishbowl universe of prissy suburban breeders, casually sadistic office bosses, and zoophilic outcasts might turn Shannon's administrative assistant a touch irritable at the midway point, but, unlike Solondz's, White's humor isn't merciless. If anything, Dog 's bark is more like a lonely howl; its comic bite never breaks the skin, and its kisses are sloppy. (You probably shouldn't see the film if you don't want to consider bringing home a pup of your own.)
That said, White's world, as before, teems with narcissistic injury and desperate, borderline-pathetic yearning. The dogs are hardly the only yelpers here. White introduces Peggysingle, save for her pupat the dog park on a sunny day, wearing a smile that seems a tad too wide to last. Spooning her little Pencil in bed at night, gazing at pictures of him in her cubicle during the workday, Peggy is, in the words of another White screenplay, a "good girl." (She wears a crucifix neck- lace on some days.) At the mall, she catches her best friend's beau flirting with another woman outside Victoria's Secret  and growls like a dog.
White is a first-time director, but his habit of fixing the characters in un- nerving proximity to the camera, under lights that are just shy of harsh, has less to do with inexperience than with his urge to magnify human imperfections until they look animalistic. Peggy can't keep wagging her tail forever. Indeed, her trouble in So Cal paradise begins when Pencil goes out to "tee-tee" and doesn't make it home.
Cruelty? Comedy? Of course. White's tonal ambiguity, vacillating subtly between sarcastic and earnest, gives his dangerously slight film a tiny edge that lasts almost all the way through. The twinkling of a piano on the soundtrack matches Peggy's grief as she weeps into the red, white, and blue sweater vest that dear departed Pencil doesn't need in doggy heaven. Golly, what can our good girl possibly find to fill the hole in her heart? Her girlfriend Layla (Regina King ) is perky but self-obsessed, hubby-hungry, and more than a bit insensitive: "Even retarded, crippled people get married!" she tells her unattached pal. Peggy's regular-guy neighbor Al (John C. Reilly ) pays just enough attention to spark her interest, but he's mostly into hunting and his vast collection of knives. Her perfect brother (Thomas McCarthy ) and perfect sister-in-law (Laura Dern ) are busy sheltering their perfect daughter. Her boss (Josh Pais ) is a tightass. And the concerned guy from the animal hospital, asexual Newt (Peter Sarsgaard ), seems to love canines exclusively, but he at least helps get Peggy an abused shelter dog named Valentine.
Dogs, unlike people, don't disappoint. Or do they? Everyone here, human and animal, has a primal preoccupation with licking wounds, marking territory, playing fetch, or baring teeth. As a vision of middle-class suburban America, Year of the Dog  is maybe limited, but not by much. The film's realist brand of satire hardly requires White to design a kitsch parade from scratch, only to set up his camera at PuppyWorld. Likewise, Shannon's richly minimal performancea series of reactions, most ranging from deadpan to perturbedderives pathos from the familiarly elemental: happy, sad, bitter. What other significant emotions are there? When Peggy starts to act up, staging little revolts at work and at home, it's more than a case of a neglected pup wanting attention. Surreptitiously writing company checks to animal rights groups isn't revolutionary, perhaps, but it isn't unheroic either. White's comedic style may be fairly docile, although Year of the Dog  does have a forceful lesson for the leash and collar set: Jump the fence.
