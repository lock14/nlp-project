Yes, this is the new Woody Allen film widely hyped for a threesome, although it�s not the configuration as advertised in the ungainly title. Vicky (Hall, indefinable but intriguing) is the smart, sensible brunette and Cristina (Johansson) the amorous, free-thinking blonde; together, they are American best friends summering in Barcelona and falling, at a staggered clip, for a sultry Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem). It sounds like the setup for a hot, sexy mess � and it might have been had Allen scrapped Vicky and Cristina to focus on the scenic glories of Gaud�s Barcelona and the twin headspin of Bardem and Cruz (who plays Juan Antonio�s brawling ex-wife, Maria Elena). But Allen�s take is too toothless, too bemused with the ever-shifting dynamics among the four players � shifts that often seem unmotivated, despite the near-constant narration (delivered by Christopher Evan Welch) that plainly announces them. That narration also carries the whiff of contempt for the American leads � although Cristina doesn't help herself when, tasked with the question of what she does for a living, she replies, �I�m currently at liberty.� (A well-heeled, unaccountably monied woman aching for male approval and artistic credibility by flopping from bed to bed, hobby to hobby, philosophy to philosophy? Gosh, Woody � haven�t seen that
 one before.) Muse or not, Johansson is done no favors here by Allen, and when sidled up to Cruz, who�s only gotten harder, sexier, and more bedazzling as she ages, the jejune actress � sorry, ingenue
 � amounts to not much more than a blinding blonde with a power pout. The real problem � as ever, in Allen�s latter years � is the glass-house remove that dogs his writing. Vicky Cristina Barcleona
 is by no means a bad film, but it�s irrefutable evidence that Allen has aged � or cloistered � himself into irrelevance. As non-native speakers, Bardem and Cruz � who have a corker of a scene in which they comfort each other, in Spanish, while being mutually dumped by the third leg of their m�nage � trois � manage the formal, stilted-sounding language believably, but something is terribly amiss when the American actors sound like English is their second language.


'Barcelona' continues Allen's European sojourn

For his last four movies, Woody Allen has been working in Europe - three in London and a new one, "Vicky Cristina Barcelona," in Barcelona. It was initially neat to think of the filmmaker on vacation away from Manhattan (or given his preference for casting Scarlett Johansson, on his honeymoon). It might be time to see what his native New York has to offer again. His next film is set there, but we have to admit that Allen may never come entirely home, if not geographically then artistically.
"Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is fitfully good. It looses two American friends - Johansson's lusty but insecure Cristina and Rebecca Hall's prim Vicky - on Barcelona for the summer. Vicky is doing graduate work on Catalan life and culture. She's engaged to an enthusiastic but unexciting finance guy (Chris Messina), who checks in with trivial updates from Manhattan. Cristina, meanwhile, is trying to figure out who she is and what she wants. According to the narration that opens the film, she's made a 12-minute short about why love is so hard to find.
Both women's lives are upended when a stranger named Juan Antonio invites them both to fly with him to Oviedo for sex. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, and anyone who has yet to forget his grim exploits in "No Country for Old Men" might feel inclined to tell these two to run for their lives. Juan Antonio is a painter, and he comes on strong. If you're waiting for a murder weapon, it's his unrelenting lust ("I came over here with no subterfuge," he assures them).
Vicky is appalled. Cristina is turned on. But they hop in his plane, and Allen manufactures inorganic mix-ups that leave Vicky heartbroken as she watches her friend and this seducer fall for each other. The longer Juan Antonio stays in Vicky's mind the duller her engagement seems. She feels vaguely worse after she discovers Cristina's relationship with Juan Antonio has made room for Maria Elena (Pen�lope Cruz), another painter and the unhinged love of his life. Could that third person have been Vicky instead?
Vicky compares her conventional relationship to Cristina's sudden, unconventional one and it opens a sad existential void. Simply by staring off into space or squinting into the faces of her costars, Hall, who's English, gives the character real gravity. She's good enough to create an imbalance between herself and Johansson, who has about half the charisma Hall does. How long could a friendship between Vicky and Cristina really last?
Allen has Henry James in his sights. His tale of American women enriched and undone by travel abroad has some resonant insights into the box a committed relationship can trap a lady in. But he relies on trite gags (food poisoning, say) and doesn't go as far as he previously has in dramatizing romantic discontent. The movie doesn't need tragedy, just better realism or better fantasy. For years, the young women in Allen's films - Mariel Hemingway in "Manhattan," Juliette Lewis in "Husbands and Wives," Natasha Lyonne in "Everyone Says I Love You" - actually seemed young. Now his interest in young characters comes at the expense of their youth. Vicky and Cristina could almost have been played by Mia Farrow and Dianne Wiest, and yet they're only somewhat less callow by the end of their adventure.
In too much of "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" Allen is unwilling to apply his wisdom, but every now and then he finds a terrific moment of visual depth. A shot of Johansson radiates in the foreground of an art gallery opening while Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn, as Vicky and Cristina's older, married mentors, gossip nearby. It's the rare time in a movie that Johansson is sexy and believably thoughtful - she flashes the womanly guile her voluptuousness always suggests, and all Allen is watching in that moment is her face. It's a reassuring blip of cinema from a director who lately has been coming up short in that department, too.
During this European interval, Allen has been playing the visitor. He's appeared in only one of these films ("Scoop"), but you can feel him wandering around these cities in bad shorts and a floppy sun hat, holding up a map. He hasn't discovered much as a philosopher or an artist. And only once, in the very good "Cassandra's Dream," have the moral and emotional trappings of the trip compelled him to take some risks.
This time Allen gives us Latin cliches - two hot-blooded, hot-headed artists who use the American who's wandered into their world for sexual tinder. Erotically, the movie couldn't be duller. There's a lovely scene between Johansson and Cruz in the vermillion light of a dark room. But Allen's approach to bisexuality between stars of this magnitude is borderline prophylactic, discussed more than done.
In its way, "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" epitomizes sexual and cultural tourism. Cruz nonetheless manages to transcend mere stereotype. True, she wails, quacks, weeps, hisses, and spits (it's Hurricane Pen�lope). But there's also tremendous grace in her neurosis. Allen has come looking for postcards for his scrapbook, and this increasingly inspired woman sends him home with a portrait of a complicated lady.


Woody Allen  has been called many things  nerd, comic genius, pervert, culture hero  but it's become clear that he's also the last living hippie. If he could, he'd take us all back to the garden. Early in Vicky Cristina Barcelona , Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), comely American tourists who are spending the summer in Barcelona, are approached by Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), a soft-voiced hunk of a Spanish artist who announces his desire to whisk them off for a weekend in which the three of them will eat, drink, feast on art, and make love. (Woody Allen movies are the last place in the Western world where people use the phrase make love . He should really think about retiring it.)
Vicky, the uptight one, is a budding Catalan scholar and feminista  who's about to marry a dull finance guy, and she's offended by Juan Antonio's offer. Cristina, on the other hand, is a free spirit, a budding artist (she's trying her hand at photography), and she's up for adventure; before the weekend is over, she'll be firmly under Juan Antonio's sexo-Euro-art spell. (But then, so will Vicky.) Other characters appear, like Vicky's annoying ''It's all good!'' fiancé (Chris Messina) and Juan Antonio's hot-blooded suicidal egomaniac of an ex-wife (played with terrific, truth-telling verve by Penélope Cruz). As the relationships develop and mutate, the film turns into a duel between love, which Allen sees as wild and libertine and probably European (at one point, three of the characters are living in communal erotic harmony), and commitment, which is shown to be fuddy-duddy and dishonest and probably American.
But that's why Woody is such a hippie. In Vicky Cristina Barcelona , there is no vision  no possibility  of a relationship that is long-term and monogamous yet amorous in spirit. To Allen, commitment is a conspiracy of society. It's a drag, man! It's just so damn...bourgeois.
I hope it's not too bourgeois of me to point out that for a director who is trying to make a worldly romantic comedy, this is quite a shallow and jejune point of view. (It's why the '60s had to end.) Vicky Cristina Barcelona  is a movie of distinct pleasures, a number of them of the travel-and-leisure variety (never mind all that wondrous, dripped-candle Gaudí architecture  what's really fabulous is the long lunches in which people linger over wine). The writing is zippy, the story spins like a top, and Bardem turns out to be the wittiest of leading men, making Juan Antonio a seducer who is almost innocent in his games. As for Hall and Johansson, both of them have lovely presences, yet Vicky and Cristina, as characters, never quite transcend the schematic. They are mind and body, spirit and flesh, strait-laced and free. In Woody Allen's perpetual counterculture, never the twain shall meet.

 Bathed in light so lusciously golden and honeyed that you might be tempted to lick the screen, “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” is a rueful comedy about two young American women who, during a summertime European idyll, savor many of the Continental delicacies that such travelers often take pleasure in: art, music, culture, yes, but also strange bodies and unexpected dreams. These bodies and dreams open possibilities for the women, intimating freer, somehow different lives, despite the persistent tugging of a voice that hovers at the edge of this story trying to pull it and its characters down to earth, where desire can fade quickly.  That narration, which weaves in and out of the story like a thread, is spoken by the actor Christopher Evan Welch, but more rightly belongs to Woody Allen, the film’s writer and director. Although “Vicky Cristina” trips along winningly, carried  by the beauty of its locations and stars  —  and all the gauzy romanticism those enchanted places and people imply  —  it reverberates with implacable melancholy, a sense of loss. Mr. Allen may be buoyed (like the rest of us) by his recent creative resurrection, but this is still the same glum clown who, after the premiere of “Match Point,” his pitch-black, near pitch-perfect 2005 drama, commented that cynicism was just an alternate spelling of reality. Ah, life! Ah, Woody!  Ah, wilderness of a heart that knows what it wants even when the rest of the body does not! Sensible Vicky (Rebecca Hall) insists that she knows what she wants  —  her dull fiancé in New York, for one  —  while dreamy Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) does not. The two have traveled to Barcelona so that Vicky, who speaks little Spanish, can work on her masters in Catalan culture, while Cristina plays her foil, and we play virtual tourist amid the city’s Gaudí splendors. With the narrator setting the brisk, at times rushed, pace, the women move in with some acquaintances (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn), but their sentimental education doesn’t really begin until they meet one of Spain’s national treasures: Javier Bardem.  Mr. Bardem slithers into “Vicky Cristina” (and in that order) like a snake in the garden, wrapping himself around the two women with blissful, insinuating, sensuous ease. He’s the celebrated painter Juan Antonio, one of those artistic sybarites who attack both women and canvases with bold strokes. Eyes hooded, smile taunting, he invites the Americans to fly away for the weekend  —  a jug of wine, a loaf of bread, thou and thou  —  a proposition that inspires mockery from Vicky and girlish excitement in Cristina. Mr. Bardem, relieved of his ghoulish Prince Valiant bob from “No Country for Old Men,” invests the cliché of the Latin lover with so much humor and feeling that he quickly vanquishes the stereotype.  The same goes for Penélope Cruz, who plays a combustible Judy to Mr. Bardem’s smoldering Punch. As Maria Elena, Juan Antonio’s unstable former wife (an incident with a blade botched their happily ever after), Ms. Cruz has her own type to surmount, which she does with fire, smoke and comedy. With her artfully tousled hair and watchful eyes, Maria Elena is a classic screen siren (and totally crazy chick), but one with the pulse of a real woman. Ms. Cruz, slipping between Spanish and English (the latter was once a serious obstacle for her), does especially nice work with her voice, which seductively lowers and sometimes rises with animal intensity, suggesting a more variegated interior world than that provided by Mr. Allen’s writing.  Maria Elena and Juan Antonio give the film such a twinned jolt of energy that you may wish it would head off into Almodóvar country, but that wouldn’t be true to Mr. Allen, for whom desire remains an agony. Still, he’s enough of an entertainer to give the audience its pleasures, which partly accounts for Ms. Johansson. She isn’t much of an actress, but it doesn’t terribly matter in his films: She gives him succulent youth, and he cushions her with enough laughs to distract you from her lack of skill. The appealing Ms. Hall, whose jaw line and brittle delivery evoke Katharine Hepburn, furnishes an actual performance, one that, tinged with sadness, makes evident that this is as much a tragedy as a comedy.  There will always be an audience that hungers for a certain kind of Woody Allen movie, but it’s a relief that he has moved away from the safety and provincialism of his New York. Working in Britain for his previous three films and in Spain for this one has had a liberating effect, perhaps because it’s made it easier for him to step down as a leading man. He gave himself a sizable role in “Scoop,” but mostly he fluttered around Ms. Johansson,  tossing off jokes. He was playing the fool rather than inhabiting one, as had become his custom in those films in which he clutched at much younger actresses with whom,  like Fred Astaire after Ginger Rogers, he never found the right rhythm.  The characters in “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” by contrast, generally move fluidly  —  bopping and weaving, going here, pausing there  —  a looseness that works contrapuntally with the voice-over’s insistent forward drive. Delivered in novelistic third person, the narration allows Mr. Allen to dispense with large chunks of exposition, to fill in the narrative gaps, yet it also puts some aesthetic distance between him and his characters. The film feels personal —  “Sentimental Education,” a touchstone here, is one of the things that makes life worth living, as he says in “Manhattan” —  though not claustrophobic, another cloyingly needy dispatch from a ravenous id. What Mr. Allen says about life and disappointment still sounds very Woody, but these days he seems content to speak through his characters, not just for them.  “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Mild violence, discreet sex.

"Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is a sexy, funny divertissement that passes as enjoyably as an idle summer's afternoon in the titular Spanish city. With Javier Bardem starring as a bohemian artist involved variously with Scarlett Johansson, Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall, pic offers potent romantic fantasy elements for men and women and a cast that should produce the best commercial returns for a Woody Allen film since "Match Point." And, in the bargain, if Barcelona wants even more visitors than it already attracts, this film will supply them.
Just as London did when Allen went there for "Match Point," the Catalan capital serves as an evident stimulus for the director. Even if the film provides a strictly tourist's view of the city (a perspective justified by the scenario, in fact), and one just as upscale and heedless of money as ever for Allen, "VCB" is by several degrees more hot-blooded than his usual norm, thanks especially due to the palpable chemistry of Bardem and Cruz in the second half.
The film is all about sexual attraction and what to do about it (and in what combinations). Initial proposition along these lines comes soon after best buds Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) arrive to spend the summer at the sumptuous hillside Barcelona home of Vicky's older friends Judy (Patricia Clarkson) and Doug Nash (Kevin Dunn); after spotting Juan Antonio (Bardem) at an art gallery, the two all-American beauties are approached by the confident bearded painter in a swank restaurant with the disarmingly blunt offer of joining him in a small town for a weekend of art, food and sex.
Vicky, who's engaged to nice guy New Yorker Doug (Chris Messina) and is vaguely neurotic in longstanding Allen-female fashion, says nay, but when Cristina, who's looking for adventure, says yeah, the trio flies off by private plane to picturesque Oviedo. In different ways, Juan Antonio insinuates himself into both women's lives in the coming days, admitting in passing his abiding love for his ex-wife Maria Elena (Cruz), who once stabbed him in a fury and now lives with a man in Madrid.
Not only because she's available and Vicky's not, Cristina seems a better match for the charming seducer, and she eventually moves in with him while Vicky begins to wonder if she's facing a boring life with Doug, who springs a surprise proposal to come marry her in Barcelona. Cue Maria Elena's dramatic entrance, which throws a monkeywrench into everyone's lives and spectacularly revs the picture's body temperature up from warm to hot.
Cruz, who officially graduated from sex kitten to powerhouse melodramatic actress in "Volver," is in full Anna Magnani mode here, storming up and down mountain peaks of emotion and captivating everyone in the process. Allen even generates affectionate comic mileage from the common rap on Cruz's acting--that she's great in Spanish but blah in English--by having her deliver Maria Elena's colorful tirades in her native language, only to be told again and again by Juan Antonio to speak English so Cristina can understand her. She's dynamite here in either language.
The sexual permutations eventually multiply with the man and two women under the same roof, especially in a provocative red-light-drenched photo dark room encounter between the two women. But Vicky unexpectedly re-enters the picture as well in a very nicely constructed romantic farce that boasts a boisterously amusing climax.
Looking macho but speaking mostly in a tender, sincere way to his women, Bardem is a thoroughly convincing and likable ladies' man. Johansson needs mostly to be open and malleable, reacting to Cristina's life opportunities, and thesp's slower pace serves as a nice contrast to the others. Hall, whom American theater audiences saw on tour in her father Peter Hall's production of "As You Like It," registers engagingly and betrays no Englishness as a woman who suddenly doubts what she thought were life's certainties.
The locations include a laundry list of celebrated spots in the city and environs (Gaudi creations, the Miro Museum, the old amusement park, et al.), all of which shimmer with summer luster through the lens of cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe ("Talk to Her," "The Others"). A soundtrack of local music adds to the vibrating sexiness.
Pic's one significant problem is the narration, frequently employed to fill in background and connect the narrative dots. It would be interesting to see if the film could play without the commentary altogether. But if it's deemed necessary, the bland, tonally off-putting male voice could profitably be replaced, possibly by Clarkson, who plays the one character plausibly in a position to know all the information imparted in the voiceover.

Perhaps this review should begin with a disclaimer: Vicky Cristina Barcelona , Woody Allen 's 39th film as writer-director, will do little to endear itself to the happily-ever-after crowd or those who consider acts of infidelity punishable by impeachment. Leave it to Allen to make a romantic comedy in which all the major players end up either single, homicidal, or trapped in safe, boring marriages, and where the closest thing to a blissful relationship is a short-lived ménage à trois. Talk about modern love! Yet, from those unlikely materials, Allen has crafted a wry and thoughtful film about the peculiar stirrings of the heart that is certainly his most accomplished piece of work since 2005's Match Point  and arguably his funniest in the eight years since Small Time Crooks .
Set in Spain, where the blood runs muy caliente  under the drone of the Mediterranean sun, Vicky Cristina   begins with two American girlfriends arriving in Barcelona  for summer vacation. Brainy, long-legged, and demure, grad student Vicky (Rebecca Hall ) is finishing a master's thesis on Catalan identity. Blond, impetuous, and ready to go wherever her libido leads her, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson ) is an aspiring filmmaker who has recently completed a short about—what else?—why love is so difficult to define. Early in their sojourn, they attend an art opening at which Cristina catches the eye of a broodingly handsome painter, Juan Antonio  (Javier Bardem ), renowned for his "violent relationship with a fiery woman" which ended in one—or perhaps both—of them trying to kill the other.
Vicky seems appalled, Cristina intrigued—so much so that when Juan Antonio invites both women to abscond with him for a romantic weekend in the town of Oviedo , she readily accepts. "But," she adds, teasingly, "you have to seduce me."
Round and round they go: When an untimely bout of food poisoning lands Cristina in bed in a way other than she intended, it's Vicky who reluctantly sets off with Juan Antonio on a tour of Oviedo's scenic riches and, in due course, falls under his spell. Later, the rules of attraction will reset themselves once more.
For a while, Vicky Cristina Barcelona  seems to be shaping up as a diverting if insubstantial bedroom farce, with Bardem as a near-parody of the artist-lothario, Johansson as the vivacious bimbo, and Hall as the frigid intellectual who learns to let her hair down. But it's one of the unexpected pleasures of Allen's film that very little is as superficial as meets the eye. A hedonist at heart, Juan Antonio turns out to have his own complexities and depth; he may be an omnivore when it comes to attractive women, but really he's an unapologetic consumer of beauty in all its manifestations: architectural, musical, physical. "Life is short, dull, and full of pain," he tells the women upon their first encounter, effectively summarizing his personal worldview (and perhaps Allen's). Likewise, the two female leads have been written by Allen with considerable nuance, even if they ultimately function as avatars for two opposing romantic philosophies—short bursts of intense passion versus a sustained, "meaningful" (whatever that means) relationship over the long haul.
Filming in Spain, as with England before it, seems to have rejuvenated Allen, who has put more care into things like composition (the cinematographer here is Javier Aguirresarobe , who shot Talk to Her  for Pedro Almodóvar ), editing, and performance than was evident in most of his work of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The result is a movie of real energy, levity, and joie de vivre. Then, around an hour or so in, Penélope Cruz  makes her entrance.
As Juan Antonio's erstwhile amor  and muse, Maria Elena , Cruz sets this heretofore perfectly enjoyable enterprise ablaze like a raging comic fireball. The movie's much-ballyhooed make-out scene between Cruz and Johansson follows, though I would argue for another scene of the two actresses frolicking on a Barcelona hillside—Cruz in a flowing white sundress and toreador's hat, Johansson in a sleeveless checkerboard top and tight denim shorts—as an even more feverish burst of high-test eros.
A whirling vortex of jealousy, passion, and lust, spewing her words in a melodic rush of English and Spanish, Maria Elena is at once too much to handle and the closest Vicky Cristina Barcelona  comes to offering up its vision of the ideal woman. (And yes—ironically or not—she's also the one most likely to put a knife in you.) Surely, this will prompt the cultural guardians who remain unwilling to parse Allen the filmmaker from Allen the public figure to condemn Vicky Cristina Barcelona  as an untenable defense of loose morals and male piggishness. But I for one found something oddly elating in the movie's conviction that it is better to have made passionate love and maybe almost died at the hands of a jealous mistress than never to have loved at all. To quote Guy Lombardo  and His Royal Canadians: "Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think."
