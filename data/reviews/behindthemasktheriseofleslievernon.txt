A wickedly entertaining postmodern take on the hallowed, Eighties-era slasher flicks peculiar to American cinemas, Behind the Mask
 is a faux documentary centered on the title character, played to the blood-flecked hilt of his rusty, old hand scythe by Baesel. Set in a contemporary world where hometown maniacs like Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, and Jason Voorhees are very much alive, or dead, or undead (and if those names don't ring a funereal bell in your head, this likely isn't the mockumentary for you), Behind the Mask
 (which had its world premiere at SXSW 2006) uses the increasingly familiar trope of a documentary camera crew that follows the titular character throughout his preparations for his debut killing spree, allowing us entr�e into the inner workings of the allegedly supernatural serial killer's mind, motivation, and technique. The latter comes up for some serious skewering: As Baesel plays him, the ingratiating proto-slasher Leslie Vernon resembles nothing so much as a giddy, witty, cardio-pumped theatre nerd with a pocketful of doom in lieu of the usual, you know, stardust. (Even his regulation spooky mask resembles a Cabbage Patch version of the theatre's iconic inverted smile of Tragedy.) With an equally game grad-student journalist (Goethals) and her sound and camera crew in tow, Vernon enthuses over his chosen virginal victim (Carlson) and demonstrates the mountains of preplanning that go into forcing hormone-crazed teens to make all those seemingly natural (if ultimately foolhardy) choices, such as going into pitch-black basements or using second-story windows as horror house exits. Director Glosserman, working from a script co-written with David J. Stieve, occasionally hits heights of satiric brilliance even Christopher Guest might envy, as in one early sequence that has the oddly endearing madman stalking his quarry in an appropriately gloomy library ("Look at him go!" enthuses an awestruck cameraman. "He's like a little monkey!") For all its postmodern theorizing, genre fans will recall that similar feats have been done before, and better � specifically in Dutch filmmakers R�my Belvaux and Andr� Bonzel's 1992 film, Man Bites Dog
, which, while less polished (suitably so) than Behind the Mask
, effectively presaged everything from the astonishing popularity of what what we now call "reality television" to the whole meta-pomo-pop-culture mindfuck that's currently doing double duty as both American reality and its televised mirror shade. The post-post-postmodern ur-gag behind Behind the Mask
 is that Leslie Vernon, psychopath, isn't even a genuine person within this fictional world. He's actually an egotistic preener originally hailing from Reno, Nev. (which, if you've been to that now-official methamphetamine capital of North America, doesn't seem like much of a stretch at all). It's a smart gag in an even smarter movie, a poke in the eye of genre convention with a flensing blade and a disarmingly charming razor-blade grin.


Little did you know that Jason, Freddy Krueger, and all the other bogeymen of modern movies weren't just psychotic mass murderers -- they were workaholics, too. It takes preparation to get a crew of horny teenagers into a decaying mansion and slaughter them one by one, and you still have to chase down the virgin scream queen in the final reels. "You have no
 idea how much cardio I have to do," gripes Leslie Vernon, panting his way through a workout.
Who's Leslie Vernon ? The dark star of "Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon," and a mad slasher who takes his duties seriously. The movie's a cheeky, low-budget goof on dice-and-slice horror films, but for all the visible seams, it's a lot cleverer than "Scream."
The conceit is that all those famous movie killers were for real and that a college news team headed by reporter Taylor Gentry (Angela Goethals ) has stumbled on to the next one, who's granting her backstage access. As played by Nathan Baesel (ABC's "Invasion" ), Leslie suggests Jim Carrey torn between his perfectionist and homicidal impulses. (Either that, or the young Jack Lemmon as Norman Bates.) Patiently explaining to Taylor and her cameramen (Ben Pace and Britain Spellings ) how he chooses his target group, Leslie says "One from Column A, one from Column B, a Survivor Girl, tie 'em all together."
A "Survivor Girl"? "Sorry, industry term."
Like a mockumentary remake of " The Blair Witch Project," "Behind the Mask" creates a meta-mythology for junk flicks. Director Scott Glosserman (who wrote the script with David J. Stieve ) lets Leslie wax semiotic about "yonic imagery" and throws in a few cameos for the buffs: Zelda Rubi nstein, the miniature medium from "Poltergeist," as an unlucky librarian; Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund as Leslie's "Ahab" or psycho-hunter (it's the old Donald Pleasance role from "Halloween" ); Kane Hodder , the hulking stuntman who played Jason in "Friday the 13th" parts 242 through 869.
This would all just be kids dinking around with dad's videocam if not for two things: The dialogue has wit, and the rug gets pulled out from under us and the characters in several short, sharp jolts. At a certain point, "Behind the Mask" loses the tatty digital-video and immerses us in cinema: 35mm, stereo sound, eek-eek-eek
s on the soundtrack.
By now, Leslie's wearing a fright mask and wielding a rusty scythe, and it's the reporter's lousy luck that she's up against a depraved maniac who's also an entrepreneurial careerist. "I made a choice to counterbalance all those things that are held good," our plucky madman tells her before he drops the killer blow. "You chose journalism."


         The marriage of horror and comedy has given birth to a few favorite children ("Young Frankenstein," "Scream") and plenty of ugly ones ("Child's Play," "Scream" 2 and 3). But what of the unholy trinity of horror, comedy and mockumentary? Despite some birthing pains, "Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon" comes across at its best as the love child of Wes Craven and Christopher Guest.
 
 In this universe, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers all exist — and are pioneers of the "industry," heroes to affable young Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel, TV's "Invasion"), who is planning his very first murder spree. Leslie enthusiastically demonstrates to amateur documentarian Taylor (Angela Goethals) how a burgeoning boogeyman nurtures a legend, selects that special victim and rigs tricks to strike terror in the hearts of naughty teens before slicing and dicing them.
 


         






   After an awkward opening, "Behind the Mask" finds its groove as first-time director (and co-writer) Scott Glosserman gleefully hacks up horror clichs to deconstruct the genre with carnivorous, lip-smacking delight. It's a meta-slasher flick: Leslie and Taylor even discuss the symbolism of his actions in offhanded Freudian jargon.
 
  Film students will titter at the idea that the subjects of their analysis could actually think the things professors impose upon them.
 
 The whole thing is savvy and fun, as when the soon-to-be killer sees a group of stoners during a campus scouting trip and tells Taylor, "Those guys don't move quite as fast, so they're good to pad your numbers late in the game."
 
 Along the way, Leslie introduces us to his mentor, a retired and equally congenial slayer, Eugene (Scott Wilson), and Eugene's supportive wife (Bridgett Newton). There's much warm reminiscing about tradition, how "Fred" and "Jay" revolutionized the business, and how today's guys do so much more prep. But amid all these charming interludes rises a nagging gnawing: Can Taylor and her crew really sit back and watch as Leslie carries out his plan?
 
 Most of the performances find the unexalted level of the slasher genre, except for Wilson, Newton and Baesel, whose regular-guy charm is Will Ferrell-like. The movie occasionally stumbles as it switches between mockumentary and standard horror-film modes — at its heart it's a teen carnage fest, although the violence is mostly only implied — and its ending is disappointingly predictable. However, "Behind the Mask" is original and weirdly delicious, and executed with gory aplomb.

After assorted "Screams" and "Scary Movies," it may seem late in the day for a satire of slasher cinema. But "Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon" manages to pump fresh blood into the horror-comedy subgenre. An ingeniously twisted mockumentary about a frightfully ambitious young man who wants to follow in the bloody footsteps of Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, pic could generate appreciative reviews and upbeat biz during limited theatrical play before slaying auds in homevid and cable venues. Anchor Bay will kick off release in a dozen major markets Jan. 5.
Working from a sharp script he co-wrote with David J. Stieve, helmer Scott Glosserman does an impressive job of establishing and sustaining the central conceit: Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel), a would-be bogeyman, prepares himself to draw first blood while followed by a small documentary crew.
Preening and posing for director Taylor Gentry (Angela Goethals), Leslie enthusiastically explains the method behind his madness while doing cardio workouts (all the better to enable him to briskly walk after fleeing victims) and practicing heart-slowing yoga exercises (to make credulous bystanders assume he's really, really
 dead). He also invents his own mythos -- a backstory involving a purportedly drowned youngster -- while scoping out potential victims among the teen population of his small town.
Pic takes some well-aimed potshots at genre cliches. Chief among the comic highlights: Vernon's guided tour through a secluded cabin that he methodically prepares before the inevitable arrival of doomed teen-agers. (Windows nailed shut? Check. Defensive weapons boobytrapped? Ditto.) As he make ready for murder, Vernon dutifully reminds the documentarians about the cardinal rule of the game -- the "last victim" always is the only virgin in the group -- thereby planting the seed for a gag that pays off big-time during the actual killing spree.
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge spoofiness extends to the casting of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" star Robert Englund as an obsessed psychiatrist bent on stopping Vernon before he gets started. Vernon describes the doctor as his own private "Ahab" -- an absolute necessity for any self-respecting slasher -- and, truth to tell, Englund shrewdly channels the spirit of the late Donald Pleasence's Dr. Sam Loomis in the "Halloween" series. 
But the real masterstroke is the tone of straight-faced absurdity maintained throughout Vernon's sentimental reunion with his mentor, Eugene (Scott Wilson), a "retired" serial killer who marvels at the resiliency of contemporary death-dealers. (Back in his heyday, Eugene notes, he didn't have to worry about returning for sequels.)
It's not exactly surprising when Vernon reveals why he chose these particular documentarians -- or, more specifically, this particular director -- to record his grand debut as a master of mayhem. But Glosserman skillfully maneuvers this twist -- more like a 180-degree turn, actually -- without forcing his pic off the tracks. Final reel is closer to an actual slasher thriller than a broad comedy, but the mix of jokes and jolts works surprisingly well.
Lead actors are perfectly attuned to pic's tonal shifts. Baesel comes across as a younger, edgier and much scarier Jim Carrey (think "The Cable Guy II: Back for Blood"), while Goethals nimbly handles the demands of a role that evolves from amusingly satirical concept to seriously distressed damsel to furiously avenging angel. In his scene-stealing supporting turn, Wilson plays it perfectly straight and is all the more hilarious for doing so. Englund is similarly (albeit fleetingly) effective.
Production values are above-average for a small-budget production. Credit lenser Jaron Presant for enhancing the illusion of cinema verite mixed with Grand Guignol. Use of the Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer" to underscore closing credits is an appropriately cheeky capper for pic.

Subtext is scarce in Scott Glosserman 's Behind the  Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon  , a metahorror flick of Craven self-satisfaction. The film's eponymous loon, as played by Nathan Baesel , is the type who'd give himself a blowjob if he couldand judging by an impromptu flip he does in one scene, he's probably tried. This pathological cutie aspires to myth, living in a world where Freddy Krueger , Michael Myers , and Jason Voorhees  are not only real but also revered as heroes by an outspoken serial-killer community that includes a former psycho-slasher played by Scott Wilson  (check IMDb  for in-joke). Taylor Gentry  (Angela Goethals ) is the aspiring documentary filmmaker who records Leslie's plan to become the next big bogeyman, a "business of fear" that includes stuffing his intended crime scene with Freudian symbology, casting teenage sluts and stoners, and doing cardio so he never looks out of breath. Taylor's obvious sense of decency and journalistic aspirations blow the promising premise's credibility from the startwhy would she conspire to record a murder?but it's Glosserman's snarky pandering that's most damning. Desperately overcompensating for the fact that most horror films are already parodies of themselves, Behind the Mask  takes a bite out of the dumb Scream  franchise before devouring its own tail, proving that you are what you eat.
