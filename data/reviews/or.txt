r (My Treasure)" was shown at last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Manohla Dargis's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 5; the full text is avialable at right. The unrated film, in Hebrew, with English subtitles, opens today in Manhattan. Filmmakers have long been fascinated with prostitution, not only because of the profession's metaphoric resonance (see the films of Jean-Luc Godard, ad infinitum), but also because woman's work just isn't very interesting if it doesn't involve sex and the possibility that the woman on screen might be stripped of her clothes and perhaps her humanity. In the Israeli film "Or," about a prostitute and her teenage daughter, both clothes and humanity are stripped away with impunity. Directed by Keren Yedaya, this well-meaning but irritatingly na�ve feature delves into the horrors of prostitution, or more accurately, the filmmaker's horror about the subject. Set in modern Tel Aviv, in what looks to be a working-class neighborhood, the story traces the everyday struggles of a street prostitute, Ruthie (Ronit Elkabetz), and her teenage daughter, Or (Dana Ivgy). From all appearances, Or seems to have long ago assumed the role of the responsible one in the family: she collects bottles and cans for money, works as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by a sympathetic neighbor and keeps up the family's cramped, cluttered apartment as best she can. In turn, Ruthie, recently returned from a hospital stay, behaves like one of those out-of-control adolescents who show up on cable television: she dresses like Slattern Barbie, refuses to get up in the morning, sneaks out at night, keeps bad company and whines, a lot. Shot in an unadorned style that makes everything look fairly grotty, the women included, the film mixes scenes of quotidian life with melodramatic incident, and then the whole thing grinds to a stop. Along the way, Ms. Yedaya and her co-writer, Sari Ezouz, build the case that prostitutes are purely victims and that prostitution is so pathological, so radically dehumanizing, that the prostitute herself is little more than an empty shell. In this formulation, prostitution isn't a lousy way to make a living; it's an iron cage with a rusted lock. Ruthie and Or are victims not only of  poverty, male opportunism and social indifference, but also of their actions and desires, which don't really belong to them in any meaningful sense because, well, everything they do and feel is symptomatic of their pathological existence. Ms. Yedaya's take on prostitution would be tolerable if her characters, especially Ruthie, weren't such ideological constructs. A monster from her gaudy blue eye-shadow to her Frankenstein platforms, Ruthie insists on breaking her daughter's heart by turning tricks. She says they need the money, but something else clearly drives her into the streets. But because Ms. Yedaya refuses to give Ruthie a hint of a dreamscape, a moment outside that iron cage, we never learn what makes her tick. That Ruthie might get something she needs from prostitution, however unhealthy, is something the film refuses to consider; worse, there's a suggestion that Or's teenage lust is a symptom of Ruthie's pathology rather than something good and real and human. Prostitution isn't the only disease in this film; so is desire.  
Rock of underages: Kids get Zap-tized by tyrannical tutor
The short-fused motormouth who runs the Paul Green School of Rock Music , an after-school program for nine-to-17-year-olds in Philadelphia , has claimed, not unreasonably, to be the inspiration for Jack Black 's character in School of Rock. But where Richard Linklater 's movie approached its central incongruitythe idea that anti-establishment rock can and should be schooled with a breezy mix of ironic farce and fuck-the-Man feelgoodism, Paul Green , the frustrated musician and self-proclaimed "really good teacher" at the center of this documentary, embraces the same philosophy with grim, cranky resolve. Students like Madi, a Quaker folkie, and Will, the resident depressive, attest that rock school is a misfit sanctuary and that Green's manic tantrums serve a motivational purpose. In any case, as Will deadpans, "It's a lovable quirk that he's mentally disturbed."
But with his Hannibal Lecter  impersonations, Vietnam  P.O.W. re-enactments, and borderline abusive teasing, Green tends to be more actively unpleasant than amusing. He almost gets misty-eyed envisioning a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone : "Where did all these bands come from? All of a sudden they start tracing stuff back to me." Given that Green's curriculum is even more ossified than his fictional counterpart's, this immodest forecast assumes the resurgent popularity of Frank Zappa -style art-prog. There's plenty of talent on display12-year-old guitar prodigy CJ kills every time he's onbut as the kids dutifully make the pilgrimage to Germany 's tribute-band Zappanale, it's depressingly clear whose dreams they're acting out. (Is it really fair to be force-feeding drug music to listeners who aren't, um, properly equipped to enjoy it?) Don Argott's lively documentary, ostensibly a paean to alternative pedagogy, extends its subject a long leash, and he in turn does his damnedest to sabotage the project. Rock School ends up being a movie about just how little fun rock 'n' roll can be.
