If you had told me before I walked into the screening of Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins
 that hyperactive comedian/actor Lawrence would be the quiet center of the movie, I probably would have laughed in your face, then taken your temperature, as would any reasonable soul within earshot. Up to this point, Lawrence�s film career � from House Party
 to Bad Boys
 to Big Momma�s House
 � has been built on the premise that, in comedy, less is always less and that the best way to keep people�s attention is to be the loudest person onscreen at all times. And though Roscoe Jenkins
 is hardly what you�d call subtle, most of the film�s most boisterous, most scatological moments are left in the hands of other actors. They include Epps, who plays a morally defunct con man with a passion for all things kink, and Mo�Nique as the beyond-voluptuous sister of the film�s title character and one of the most perfect examples of self-indulgent, self-righteous id to come out of Hollywood in years. Lawrence, meanwhile, is actually the soul of endearing insecurity (with exceptions made for the occasional overblown sex scene or desperate fist fight). He plays Jenkins, a hugely successful daytime-TV �doctor� with a Jerry Springer
-like talk show who returns home to rural Georgia for his parents� 50th wedding anniversary, only to discover that, despite his fame, fortune, and newfound urbanity, around his family he�ll always feel like a petulant teenager. Poor Roscoe is treated to the scathing attacks (both verbal and physical) of various siblings, the abiding disappointment of his father (Jones), and the sight of his childhood sweetheart, Lucinda (Parker), arriving for the weekend on the arm of his childhood antagonist, cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer), who is a living, breathing, guffawing reminder of Roscoe�s failures and barely disguised self-contempt. At its best, Roscoe Jenkins
 is about the crushing influence of the past and one man�s attempts to free himself � by hook, crook, or Hollywood � from underneath it. At its worst, however, the movie is content to just explore the apparently infinite comic potential of dogs having sex, people getting sprayed by skunks, and men getting beaten up by overweight women. In other words, Jenkins
 suffers from an epic and disappointing case of schizophrenia; it�s capable at times of real subtlety and warmth and humanity but not confident enough in itself to stay away from fart jokes or empty acts of sassiness for very long.


"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins" is a comedy that wants us to believe that James Earl Jones and Margaret Avery could be the proudish parents of Martin Lawrence, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Mo'Nique. You can't ask comedy to pull that off when it's science-fiction's job. Then again, realism gets beat up something awful in this movie. So do we. This is one of those your-roots-are-showing family circuses where just about everybody seems like a clown.
Lawrence plays RJ Stevens, a sub-Dr. Phil talk-show host and best-selling author ("The Team of Me") who takes his snotty vegan fiancee, Bianca (Joy Bryant), to Georgia for his parents' 50th wedding anniversary. He hasn't been home in nine years, which is plenty of time for the humiliations he's avoided to pile up.
Before RJ even gets out of his first-class seat, his white suit is covered in beet juice (which airline stocks that?). He's forced to wear a pair of madras patch pants, then an entire Cross Colors faux-African outfit, which is perfect for a movie that feels like it came out 18 years ago. Both getups are only slightly more obnoxious than the movie itself.
Eventually, RJ's successful car salesman cousin, Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer), shows up. They resume their boyhood rivalry over Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker), the down-to-earth beauty who's still mysteriously available to them. The writer and director Malcolm D. Lee ("Roll Bounce") has no apparent interest in developing this movie into even a moderately plausible, tonally consistent entertainment. He'd rather show us two dogs having sex (which goes on long enough to be almost funny) or whip up senseless horseplay that ends in the destruction of Mamma Jenkins's kitchen. Oh, and look out for that stream of skunk spray that hits RJ's face. (Yup, it's that type of movie, too.)
Lee hasn't grown much as a filmmaker or a storyteller over the years. But, my, can he waste a very good cast. Here everybody stands around while one actor does his or her thing (usually it's Mike Epps as a lewd cousin). Playing the eldest Jenkins's child, Duncan is actually as funny as Epps and Mo'Nique. He ought to get himself a real comedy, quick.
"Roscoe Jenkins" never tries for passable adult laughs. Why is Mo'Nique scrubbing her feet at the kitchen table? Why does Margaret Avery have to be socked in the head during the long, long softball-game sequence? Why doesn't Mamma Jenkins have any control over her house? And that skunk . . . for real?
Sadly, the movie's biggest burst of inspiration involves Lawrence and Mo'Nique battering each other a la Eddie Murphy and Della Reese in "Harlem Nights." None of Lee's attempts at satire work, either. Bryant is supposed to be playing a cutthroat "Survivor" contestant and some joke on Paris Hilton (she's usually a pleasure to watch; not here).
It's as if Lee's taken the likable bawdy gags of his 2002 blaxploitation romp "Undercover Brother" and the ensemble charm of his 1999 romantic comedy "The Best Man" and dropped them on the Jenkins house like a cartoon anvil. The movie hurts.

In this broad comedy of familial bad manners, Martin Lawrence stars as a Jerry  Springer-ish talk-show host with a Survivor -winning fiancée (Joy Bryant) and a young son (Damani Roberts) he somewhat neglects. All three decamp to his parents' house in rural Georgia on the occasion of the oldsters' 50th wedding anniversary. There, our celebrity-life-embracing hero is cut down to size by the relations he left behind, including his abrasive sister, Betty (Mo'Nique), and big brother Otis (very big brother, actually, given that he's played by Michael Clarke Duncan). In short, if you thought National Lampoon's Vacation  films were at least okay, then Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins  is a decent enough way to spend two hours.
However, as was the case with the Vacation  movies, the cast is never really made to break a metaphorical sweat. Lawrence is a genuinely funny actor and spiky stand-up, but here he is often merely required to fall over  or be sprayed by a skunk (a comedy trope that, humor scientists now agree, stopped being funny some time during the second Reagan administration). Mo'Nique is similarly given little opportunity to show off her indisputable comedic chops, though her freewheeling monologue during the closing credits hints at what might have been. The result may not smell nearly as bad as a skunk, but it does give off the distinct whiff of underachievement.

 Late in “Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins,” a comedy about a talk-show host (Martin Lawrence) revisiting his relatives down South, there’s a scene in which characters sit in the family patriarch’s living room playing video games. The scene is already funny because the competitors are playing on a bulky 1977 television   while the hero’s recent gift to his father, a flat-screen plasma  set, sits unopened in a box nearby. But the crowning touch is a throwaway detail: The  TV’s knob is missing its button, and in its place is a pair of pliers clamped over the metal stem.  “Roscoe Jenkins” is just a shaggy diversion that gives its energetic star and its populous, accomplished supporting cast (including James Earl Jones as Papa Jenkins, Margaret Avery as Mamma Jenkins and Cedric the Entertainer and Mo’Nique as the hero’s siblings) a chance to clown around. But it’s a cut above other films of its type because every scene is packed with details like those pliers — touches that suggest that the film’s writer and director, Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”), is working overtime to smuggle life into formula.  Mr. Lawrence is apoplectic and affecting as Roscoe, a braggart who now calls himself R. J. Stevens, and whose cockiness masks his hurt over past and present miseries.  His dad always favored Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer), an adopted child turned used-car impresario who won every prize Roscoe coveted,  including Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker, sweet but tough),  Roscoe’s childhood crush and Clyde’s current squeeze. Roscoe’s gossiping, eavesdropping, trash-talking sister (Mo’Nique) stirs every pot, and when called out by Roscoe, silences him with a “Raising Arizona”-level backside whupping.  His fiancée, Bianca Kittles (a gem of a performance by Joy Bryant), is a “Survivor” prizewinner who pressures Roscoe’s sweet-natured son, Jamaal (Damani Roberts), to be more ruthless, and whose scheming nature brings out Roscoe’s least flattering qualities. (Roscoe puts up with her because the sex makes him speak in tongues.)  You can see every twist coming: Roscoe’s disenchantment with Bianca and his reconnection with his family; the tension between Clyde, who treats the empathetic Lucinda as a possession, and Roscoe, who sees her as his salvation; the sequence in which the family members run an obstacle course, and Roscoe must choose between helping his struggling son and heeding Bianca’s exhortations to abandon Jamaal and win the race. (The film’s vilification of Bianca is its least savory aspect; a  story with this many screwed-up, hypercompetitive characters has no business scapegoating one of them.)  But it’s the gags that make or break this sort of film, and “Roscoe Jenkins” is aces in that department, from Clyde’s fits of comic weeping (he sounds like the Cowardly Lion) to the newly  health-conscious  Roscoe’s furtive sampling of forbidden barbecue (his sauce goatee gives him away) to the veteran scene-stealer Mike Epps, as Roscoe’s hustling best friend, getting a laugh simply by pronouncing the word Telemundo.  The most absurd gag is a dog sex scene, shot like something out of a  soft-core film, that pays off in subsequent images of those same dogs tenderly spooning. As  the song says, everybody needs somebody sometime.  “Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for crude and sexual content, language and some drug references.

The much-abused hero of this family-reunion comedy shares his first name with a Los Angeles restaurant chain best known for its chicken 'n' waffles -- a delicious if artery-clogging combo. As soul food goes, Roscoe's signature dish still digests more smoothly, and satisfyingly, than "Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins," an in-your-face double helping of fat jokes, crude slapstick, wacky Southern-black stereotypes and occasionally inspired improv -- sort of like a BET remake of "Dan in Real Life" in which Martin Lawrence gets smacked around a lot. Pic's target audience should eat it up; others, not so much.
Lawrence plays successful Hollywood talkshow host RJ Stevens -- that's Roscoe Jenkins to his folks -- who's heading home for his parents' 50th wedding anniversary celebration. Roscoe hasn't seen the family in nine years, and auds will understand why upon meeting his gruff dad (James Earl Jones, oozing authority), who's always given preferential treatment to Roscoe's attention-hogging, super-competitive cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer).
Rounding out the clan are Roscoe's sweet-natured mom (Margaret Avery) and boisterously obnoxious siblings: sly con artist Reggie (Mike Epps), tough-lovin' family man Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan) and plus-sized diva Betty (the irrepressible Mo'Nique). Generally unimpressed with his celebrity status, Roscoe's relations love nothing more than to torture him, reminding him of past mistakes and opening the occasional (well-deserved) can of whup-ass when he tries to fight back.
Also there to dredge up unpleasant memories and stir up competitive male hormones is Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker), the beauteous young woman whom Roscoe and Clyde fought over years ago. Predictably, this doesn't sit well with Roscoe's shallow fiancee Bianca (Joy Bryant, who deserves better), a pampered-princess type who refers to their impending marriage as an "alliance."
Roscoe also has a young son, Jamaal (Damani Roberts), who's trotted out every so often to look cutely neglected and give this noisy, aggressive movie some semblance of an emotional core. The ploy would be more successful if writer-director Malcolm D. Lee ("Undercover Brother," "Roll Bounce") didn't swing at every comic target with all the restraint of two unneutered dogs in the throes of passion -- an image that, incidentally, comes directly from the movie.
As the misunderstood Roscoe, Lawrence gamely cedes the comic spotlight to Epps, Duncan and Mo'Nique -- skillful performers all, and Lee often lets them run their mouths off long after the cameras would have ordinarily stopped rolling. While the effect is pretty hit-or-miss, this directorial indulgence does yield some amusing off-the-cuff banter amid the general pile-up of physical pratfalls and cloying daddy issues. (Pic seems wholly unaware of the irony that Roscoe, having never earned his dad's love, also mistreats his own son.)
Louisiana-lensed production looks slick and professional; musically, however, pic veers between overemphatic emotional cues and a rap/pop/R&B soundtrack that couldn't have been cheap.

In this overlong but exuberantly performed comedy from writer-director Malcolm D. Lee , Martin Lawrence  is R.J. Stevens , a tabloid TV talk-show host who takes his Survivor -winning fiancée (Joy Bryant , terrific) home to Georgia to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his parents (James Earl Jones  and Margaret Avery ). In Hollywood , R.J.'s a king, but down home, he's still seen as the hapless kid who lost every childhood game to his cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer ), who arrives at the reunion on the arm of R.J.'s unrequited love (Nicole Ari Parker ). Although the big comic setups in Lee's script feel a bit forcedR.J.'s encounter with a skunk, he and Clyde's climatic obstacle-course showdownthe director continually sets up moments of rapid-fire, barb-filled interplay among his accomplished cast. As R.J.'s crazy cousins (lots of cousins in this house), Mike Epps  and the stand-up comic Mo'Nique  counterbalance each other nicelyhe with a sly, street-hustler charm and she with raise-the-rooftops boisterousness. It's impressive, actually, that Lawrence lets this film's supporting players steal so much of his showas movie stars go, he must be a pretty secure guy.
