Early on in "Michael Clayton," the title character's resume is read out loud by an interested party. Suddenly, it all comes into focus: An attorney at the elite, high-powered New York law firm of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen, Clayton (George Clooney) is an outer-borough boy, a graduate of Fordham Law rather than Harvard, the kid who made good from a family of cops. He has been at the company 17 years and never made partner. He's the fixer, the guy other attorneys call when their clients run someone over with their Porsches. In a firm of white-shoe lawyers, he's the one with mud on his wingtips.
Clooney plays the character with the lived-in weariness of a man who knows he has gone as far as he's going to. It's a subtle, watchful performance, but you have to pay attention to it, and to the movie, too. "Michael Clayton" is the directorial debut of screenwriter Tony Gilroy ("The Bourne Identity" and sequels), and it's a writer's film, as the resume gambit described above implies. It also falls squarely and satisfyingly into a long legacy of New York morality plays, specifically those directed by Sidney Lumet. Like "Serpico," "Prince of the City," and "The Verdict" (Boston-set but New York in feel), "Michael Clayton" is a drama of dwindling options in a concrete jungle. When the hero's in-car navigation goes on the fritz, it could be a metaphor for his life.
Kenner, Bach's biggest client is U/North, a chemical corporation fighting a six-year-long lawsuit resulting from a toxic weedkiller the company put on the market. The case is inching toward settlement when the attorney of record, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), goes spectacularly bonkers in a Milwaukee deposition room, stripping off his clothes and shouting that he has blood on his hands.
It's damage-control time. Name partner Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) dispatches Michael to rein in his old friend, while U/North puts its general counsel, a pale-eyed attack dog named Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), on the case. Edens, it turns out, is bipolar and has gone off his meds, and his long rants of complicity and paranoia form the heart of the movie's initial scenes. You can practically hear Gilroy giggling as he crams in all the dialogue he couldn't get into "Armageddon."
Michael takes in this meltdown with patience and sad eyes, wondering where Arthur's briefcase has gotten to, and wondering, too, where his own moral compass went. He's divorced, a good father to his young son (Austin Williams), a good son to his ailing father, a prickly sibling to his brother the police detective (Sean Cullen) and his other brother the cokehead loser (David Lansbury). With the latter he made the mistake of investing in a restaurant that has gone bust, leaving Michael holding the bag for $75,000 he doesn't have. Due by end of week.
That's a lot of character development, and "Michael Clayton" takes its sweet time doling it out. Steadily paced, occasionally lumbering, the movie's for grown-ups willing to settle in and sift the complex chess moves of legal and personal feint and counterfeint. There are thriller elements - a car bombing here, a corporate assassination there - but they're sunk into the muck of daily compromise. At one point, a business negotiation among several of the characters becomes, by degrees, a murder conspiracy, and as it does so the bland MBA dialogue turns both comic and horrifying. Everything is actionable here, and nothing can be said outright.
Gilroy revises the rules of dramatic thrillers in ways that are modest but refreshing. Violence comes when you don't expect it; the usual movie signals that someone is lunchmeat just aren't there. The film's villains are oddly human, too, prone to panic attacks and technological snafus. "Michael Clayton" is about the gap between predatory professionalism and the sins of real life - about how those sins can corrode the hardest business suit of armor.
The energy sags a bit at midpoint, but eventually Gilroy rolls his marbles to the center of the table, and you start appreciating what both Clooney and Swinton are up to. The latter tempers a corporate counsel's arrogance with deep fissures of insecurity; you're always aware of how naked Karen feels in this world of men she has chosen.
Clooney, for his part, allows his movie star looks to go flabby and soft (all things being relative, of course), and he buries the performance way down in his gut. Michael rarely shows his cards because A) he's a lawyer and B) he knows he's considered a day visitor at the country club. "I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor," he says, and as far as he's concerned that's his real resume. Only in the very final frames of this slow, rich, rewarding film does he allow himself the one thing he has earned.


         AFTER what must seem like a lifetime of writing screenplays for other people to direct, Tony Gilroy has come out from behind the curtain. With the George Clooney-starring "Michael Clayton," he's not only saved his best script for himself, he's also turned out a smart and suspenseful legal thriller that comes completely alive on-screen.
 
 Watching this film makes you feel that Gilroy, best known for writing credits on all three "Bourne" films, has poured the energy pent up during a decade and a half in Hollywood into this strong and confident directorial debut about desperate men searching for redemption in a cold and ruthless world.
 


         






   Gilroy starts with his impressively heightened and dramatic dialogue, an ability to get people to talk articulately while they're at a fever pitch of anxiety and concern. Added to this is an unexpected gift for creating intensity on screen. As a director, Gilroy has an unmistakable instinct for the emotional jugular and a breakneck storytelling style that pulls you through his movie, no stragglers allowed.
 
 In "Michael Clayton," Gilroy's been helped by an excellent cast that relishes the script's texture, starting with Clooney as the titular character, "the keeper of the secret sins" for the "vast and powerful" New York law firm of Kenner, Bach & Leeden.
 
 Expertly supporting Clooney are Tom Wilkinson as the organization's ace litigator, a man who is at once Clayton's close friend and biggest crisis. Then there's Tilda Swinton as the in-house attorney for an agrochemical giant called U/North that is involved in a multibillion-dollar class action suit, with Wilkinson's character working with her as the lead attorney.
 
 Issues like corporate malfeasance lurk around the edges of "Michael Clayton," along with themes of moral responsibility, conscience and regeneration. Rather than making the film unwieldy, they add a welcome hint of substance to what is at heart a crackerjack tale of suspicion and anxiety, a film that understands the secret pleasures of showing how the powerful operate when they think no one is looking.
 
 Michael Clayton has been at home in that world for 17 years, taking pride in his role as the guy you call when calls need to be made, who sardonically views himself as "a janitor: the smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up." Filmmaker Gilroy has said he's "interested in the guy who's the best at something," and when it comes to New York fixers, Clayton is the man.
 
 But being the man has taken its toll, and when we meet Clayton he is god's weary, beaten-down soul, a Willie Loman who's wondering what it all means. He couldn't be more different, frankly, from glib, self-satisfied Danny Ocean. But Clooney, who apparently was genuinely exhausted when shooting began, handles the transition beautifully and uses a quiet form of charisma to get hisstoryacross.
 
 Rather than tell this tale straight, Gilroy takes the risk of bringing us in during the middle of it, increasing our interest by making us briefly speculate about exactly what is going on before gradually filling us in and introducing the characters properly.
 
 The first person we meet is heard rather than seen, delivering a voice-over that frankly doesn't seem to be making much sense. In fact, playing over cool visuals of a deserted Manhattan law office (Robert Elswit is the reliable cinematographer) is the rant of a deranged individual whose thoughts and ideas are about to become central to the story.
 
 The man we're hearing is Arthur Edens (Wilkinson), the most feared litigator in Clayton's firm, a killer in the courtroom who for the last  six years has been defending the good name of a particularly nasty U/North pesticide.
 
 Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Edens has a psychotic breakdown. This not only threatens the case and puts U/North attorney Karen Crowder (Swinton) into a terrifying tizzy, it threatens the plans of Marty Bach (a well-used Sydney Pollack), one of the firm's founding partners, to merge Kenner, Bach & Ledeen with a London firm. Naturally, he calls on Clayton to clean up the mess, but if that ever was a simple job, it's not anymore.
 
 Wilkinson, as those who remember his Oscar-nominated performance in "In the Bedroom" will be expecting, is an exceptional actor who does some of his best work here, playing a man who goes in and out of sanity in a way that leaves it unnervingly uncertain just when he is rational and when he is ranting.
 
 As the tightly wound Crowder, Swinton projects the agony of having to pretend to be someone she really isn't. When Crowder first hears about Michael Clayton and digs into his résumé, the kind of attorney he is frankly baffles her. "Who is this guy?" Crowder asks an associate. Both she and the audience are about to find out.

When critics complain about the dumbing down of movies into franchise popcorn, what we're really doing is yearning for a terrifically engrossing, tethered-to-the-real-world drama like Michael Clayton . It's better than good; it's such a crackling and mature and accomplished movie that it just about restores your faith. This is a tale of greed, lies, and under-the-table violence  an exposé of what corporations do, and the way corporate law firms help them get away with it  yet if that all sounds familiar from a hundred other muckraking dramas, Michael Clayton  makes you feel as if you've never seen any of it before.
This is the first movie directed, as well as written, by Tony Gilroy, the screenwriter of the Bourne  films, and he works in a quiet, nervy observational style, immersing us in what really goes on within the corridors of high commerce. He also fragments time into a gripping mosaic. The movie kicks off with a botched car bombing, and there's a murder in the middle of it that is one of the most plausibly terrifying things I've ever seen in a film, yet Gilroy's touch is so subtle and glancing you might not even guess you're watching a thriller  which is why, when the story begins to thrill, it earns every pulse pound. It never leaves human experience behind.
The title character is played by George Clooney, with his snappy bravado and self-aware charmer's glint intact, but creased by a weariness we've barely seen before. For the first time, fear darts out of his eyes. Clooney's Michael Clayton is a veteran ''fixer'' for the prestigious New York law firm of Kenner, Bach & Leeden. Once a DA, he went for the big money in the early '90s and now operates in an ethical twilight zone, greasing palms and smoothing out whatever needs smoothing. He's the classic American cynical-sharpie hero, like Bogart in Casablanca , who has only just begun to notice that he's sinking into the muck around him.
Slithering out of a Chinatown poker game (he's a card addict who's tumbling off the wagon), Clayton drives to Westchester to lend assistance to one of the firm's clients, who's been involved in a hit-and-run accident. The driver's blend of entitlement and flop sweat is mesmerizing  there but for the grace of God go us  and Clayton, laying down his options, communicates a sizzling grasp of police ritual and the law. The scene sets a tone of ordinary people parsing what their money can and cannot buy. Michael Clayton  is about the ordinary people who happen to be sitting atop the pyramid of power.
The story pivots around a $3 billion class-action suit  or, rather, the unraveling of the case after Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), the law firm's star litigator, loses his marbles. Edens has spent six years defending the '' progressive'' agrochemical company U/North, which manufactured a weed killer that resulted in several hundred deaths on family farms. The firm doesn't even want to win; it wants the case to hang in limbo so it can feed like a parasite off the billable hours. At a deposition, Edens takes his clothes off and starts speaking gibberish, the apparent result of his having gone off his manic-depressive medication. The movie's sly joke is that he has really come to his senses. Wilkinson plays him as a dead soul reborn as a crazy-eloquent blabbermouth  a man, his innards eaten by guilt, ready to make amends. What this means is he plans to deliver a key piece of evidence to the plaintiffs.
It's Clayton's job to knock Arthur back into line. But there are other forces at work, like U/North's in-house counsel (Tilda Swinton), a neurotic shark in pearls who hires a pair of troubleshooters to keep tabs on Arthur. These techno-drones (Robert Prescott and Terry Serpico) are quite the duo: They're like aging members of the Princeton swim team, and they speak in the most sinister of corporate euphemisms. (You never knew how creepy the words '' We're good'' could sound.)
Gilroy doesn't just dramatize; he gives every character the equivalent of a deep background check. The scenes with Michael and his brothers, a workaday cop (Sean Cullen) and a druggie black sheep (David Lansbury), carve deeply into the conflict between class striving and family loyalty. And Michael's failed attempt to open a restaurant, which has landed him $75,000 in debt, makes a mockery of his expense-account ease. He's forced to get the money from the head of the law firm, and this squinty executive king is played, by Sydney Pollack, with such an exquisitely dry acceptance of corruption that, for a moment, he makes avarice look like the only emotion that's real. Clayton knows that he's being bought. Yet redemption awaits, in a galvanizing final encounter that gives Clooney the chance to remind you of what it looks like when a great movie star lays his heart and soul on the table.

 Dark in color, mood and outraged worldview, “Michael Clayton” is a film that speaks to the way we live now. Or at least, the way certain masters of the universe do, as they prowl the jungle in their sleek rides, armed with killer instincts and the will to power. It’s a story about ethics and their absence, a slow-to-boil requiem for American decency in which George Clooney, the ultimate in luxury brands and playboy of the Western world, raises the sword in the name of truth and justice and good. Well, someone’s got to do it.  And Mr. Clooney, who smartly moved away from star-making nonsense like “The Peacemaker” as soon as he could, has in recent years proved that it’s possible to play outwardly different, seemingly contradictory roles (glamorous, righteous) while hopscotching from Hollywood to Darfur and back. You have to be clever to pull this off, and you have to have clever friends like Steven Soderbergh, with whom Mr. Clooney created the production company Section Eight. Now defunct,  Section Eight dropped bombs, uncorked bubbles, supported independent voices and mucked about in television (“K Street”). With “Syriana,” “Good Night, and Good Luck,” “The Good German” and now “Michael Clayton,” it also helped Mr. Clooney create a singularly contemporary screen identity as a man of unquiet conscience.  In “Michael Clayton,” written and directed by Tony Gilroy, that conscience seems to have gone M.I.A., lost amid the dirty wheeling and dealing of a powerful New York law firm. Michael (Mr. Clooney) is the firm’s designated fixer, though he likes to call himself its janitor. He works in that rarefied gray zone where the barely legal meets the almost criminal and takes lunch at the private club. Michael isn’t a member of that club; he just mops up its mess, soothes its Botoxed brow and slips a fat envelope of thank you to inconvenient witnesses. There’s a dirty kind of glamour to this world, with its rich trappings and its Ivy League smilers with their gutting knives. Its ugliness seduces as much as it repels and entertains.  Mr. Gilroy’s previous writing credits include the “Bourne” franchise   and the goofily entertaining legal thriller “The Devil’s Advocate.”  (Keanu Reeves is the advocate; Al Pacino, the other guy.) “Michael Clayton” marks his debut as a director, a gig that seems to have inspired him to watch (rewatch) old Sidney Lumet films. Though Michael is more upscale, smoother around the edges (he probably doesn’t own white tube socks), he’s a variation on those soulfully alone Lumet cops and lawyers who fight the system and struggle to do the right thing, though not necessarily because they want to. The world Michael wanders is so darkly sinister, as perilous as that in Mr. Lumet’s “Q & A,” that his black coat and suit melt into shadows as depthless as an abyss.  It is an abyss, Mr. Gilroy suggests, largely of our own making. There are a few obvious, almost too obvious villains in “Michael Clayton,” notably the chief counsel for an agrichemical  giant, Karen Crowder, played with twitches and rolls of gut fat by a mesmerizing Tilda Swinton. A Lady Macbeth in pumps and discreet pearls, Karen has pledged her troth to her corporate masters instead of a murderous husband. She’s a cliché — brittle, sexless, friendless, cheerless and all the rest — but what makes her work is her unnerving banality, visible in the blank canvas of a face that looks untouched by gentleness or empathy. This is a pitiful creature, as unloved by her writer-director creator as by the genius actress who plays her.  Karen embodies evil, but Michael serves it. His law firm is helping the agrichemical company settle a multibillion-dollar suit. It seems the company with the smoothly reassuring television commercials (cue the green fields and smiling children) doesn’t bring good things to life but death by the hundreds. While working to settle the case, Michael’s friend, Arthur (Tom Wilkinson), the firm’s star litigator, has an epic meltdown. There’s blood on Arthur’s manicured hands, though not only his, as Michael discovers through a series of fairly predictable twists and turns. Mr. Gilroy hasn’t reinvented the legal thriller here, but I doubt that was his intention; at its best and most ambitious, the film plays less like a variation on a Hollywood standard than a reappraisal.  It’s a modest reappraisal, adult, sincere, intelligent, absorbing; it entertains without shame. Mr. Gilroy directs with a steady hand and a steady eye, too, with none of the visual frenzy that characterizes the “Bourne” thrillers. His movie moves rather than races. There’s a little narrative tricky business (a sizable portion of the story occurs in extended flashback) and an unexpectedly tender moment when Michael stares into a new morning in a country field without uttering a single word. Mr. Gilroy’s characters talk a lot (they’re lawyers, after all), but he knows when to shut them up, an exception being a disappointingly tidy climactic encounter that seems designed to give Mr. Clooney the last, rousing word, or maybe just a shot at an Oscar.  That’s too bad because the film feels truest when Michael is grappling with his contradictions. His struggle, as well as the film’s moody thoughtfulness, the Lumet touches and the agreeable presence of Sydney Pollack in a small role, overtly invokes 1970s American cinema. But Mr. Lumet and Mr. Pollack didn’t give Hollywood its social conscience, which comes and goes and depends on the audience to sustain it. In some ways, Michael is  a grimmer, compromised version of Erin Brockovich, the freewheeling legal clerk in the short skirts who leads the charge against social injustice in Mr. Soderbergh’s populist 2000 drama. (Michael has to be dragged.) The main difference is that the earlier film’s optimism feels like a faded signal from a faraway land.  Recently, Mr. Clooney has served as a guide into a different country, one in which the media fail, capitalism kills and heroes stumble. His glamour and easy manner make these excursions feel less a matter of duty than of necessity; they provide the pleasure that softens the pain. He does some strong work here, especially when he’s nursing his character’s misery or gently squaring off against the young actor (Austin Williams),  who plays his son. But he’s almost always good, and he’s a big enough star now that each new role feels as if he’s playing a version of himself. That’s O.K. We need George Clooney, just as we needed Warren Beatty — seducer of heavy hearts and troubled minds, the beautiful bearer of our very bad tidings.  “Michael Clayton” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Adult language, some violence.

Spare and unhurried, writer Tony Gilroy's directorial debut "Michael Clayton" features strong performances and a solid story, drawn from the familiar well of faceless corporations grinding ordinary people through their profit-making machinery. Yet Gilroy's fidelity to his script comes at the expense of the pacing, which initially lumbers forward so assiduously as to feel like a throwback to an earlier era. If George Clooney's recent choices have oscillated between serious showcases (think "Syriana") and moneymaking endeavors (the "Ocean's" series), this falls squarely into the former camp, presenting Warner Bros. with a classy but difficult-to-market, no-frills, few-thrills thriller.
Having written the first two installments in the "Bourne" trilogy (and co-written the third), Gilroy seems determined to catch his breath, casting Clooney (also among the eight producers, along with co-star Sydney Pollack) as the title character -- a "fixer" for a large corporate law firm, New York's Kenner, Bach & Ledeen. He's the kind of can-do guy whom colleagues bill as a "miracle worker" but who, in world-weary fashion, describes himself as "a janitor."
Struggling with financial troubles brought on by an entrepreneurial gambit, Michael is asked to clean up after one of the firm's top litigators, Arthur (a terrific Tom Wilkinson), suffers a breakdown while taking a deposition defending multinational conglomerate U/North against a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit. The timing could hardly be worse, given that the firm's lead partner (Pollack) is in the process of orchestrating a merger and doesn't want anything scuttling the deal.
Gradually, Michael learns that Arthur's apparent madness might stem from the time he has invested in this case, exposing him to smoking-gun evidence of corporate malfeasance that puts U/North's chief counsel (Tilda Swinton) into a panicky sweat. Those questions, and how he resolves them, will ultimately test Michael's moral compass.
Concentrated in a four-day window and told primarily in flashback, the movie is somewhat chaotic and hard to follow through the early going before it zeroes in on this relatively simple premise -- one that will be highly familiar to anybody raised on "Don't trust big corporation" thrillers from the 1970s, like "The Parallax View" and "The China Syndrome." Then again, given the historic parallels -- with Vietnam-era mistrust of institutions morphing into the Iraq war -- the recurrence of this formula isn't particularly surprising.
Still, the stakes in those earlier films felt considerably higher, and the only uncertainty here is not how far the U/North folks will go to protect their interests, but what a cynical soul like Michael will do under the circumstances. (In an odd bit of happenstance, the movie overlaps on several fronts with "Damages," an FX drama about a multibillion-dollar civil suit that also unfolds through flashbacks.)
This lack of fireworks makes "Michael Clayton" refreshing in a sense, eschewing traditional white hats and black hats for more realistic shades of gray -- a tone well represented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and James Newton Howard's understated score. In that regard, it's also a strong if less flamboyant vehicle for Clooney, playing a laconic, never-let-them-see-you-sweat type that contrasts nicely with Wilkinson's standout work as an agitated attorney on the edge.
On the downside, some of the peripheral threads -- especially Michael's relationship with his family, both as an irritated brother and a single dad -- occupy time at the outset but really don't lead anywhere, and the conclusion leaves a few key questions conspicuously unanswered.
For all its strengths, then, "Michael Clayton" poses a challenge for Warner Bros. that owes as much to those attributes as its weaknesses -- just the kind of thorny situation, actually, where the marketing department might yearn to call in a fixer.

It will no doubt be said time and again of Michael Clayton  : best John Grisham  adaptation ever . Only, of course, it did not spring from the billion-dollar mind of the attorney turned franchise, but from Tony Gilroy , who made his big-screen bow 15 years ago as the screenwriter of the ice-skating melodrama The Cutting Edge . Since then, Gilroy has shored up his now-estimable rep as the writer of the Jason Bourne  series (insomuch as he's the one who writes the few words that director Paul Greengrass  throws into his cinematic blender).
No less obsessed with strangling tension and its liberating release in his directorial debut, Gilroy lopes in the opposite direction with Michael Clayton , starring George Clooney  as the titular fixer in a law office where attorneys like to bend laws till they break. This is as languid as the Bourne movies are feverish, as nuanced and intricate as those films are full-steam-ahead. Even when a car catches fire in the middle of a frostbitten nowhere, it feels like an addendum to a reverie, a quiet moment (with horses, no less) punctuated by a sonic boom . The dream-like vibe permeates the entire movie Michael Clayton  seems to exist in a world where everyone's half-asleep, listing from one bad thing to another as they wait for the inevitable blowup.
That said, the story is relatively easy to follow: It's Erin Brockovich   sans the feel-good, yet another story about the Big Bad Corporation  doing anything and everything to crush the little people in this case, the little people it's poisoning to death. For six years, an agrochemical company called U/North has been fight- ing a class-action suit in which the plaintiffs allege that its fertilizer is lethal. A brilliant litigator named Arthur Edens  (Tom Wilkinson ) has been defending U/Northonly Arthur's but a cracked shell of his former brilliant self. His is the first voice the audience hears: Arthur's narrating a rambling confession to Michael that almost sounds like a suicide note.
Arthur, who disappeared after running naked from a deposition, is in possession of a single document that threatens to undermine U/North's entire case six years' worth of defense, gone like that . His firm's partnersamong them director Sydney Pollack , once more brilliantly cast as a devious, deadpan sonofabitchwant Arthur found and the potential damage contained. U/North's in-house counsel, played by Tilda Swinton  beneath a layer of extra flab and a sheen of dripping sweat, would like Arthur muzzledby any means necessary, she tells the buttoned-up goon squad that U/North employs for emergencies just like this.
Caught between them is the hollow man himself, in need of redemption or at least a shower and a shave. Michael may have been hot shit years ago, but now he's broke, having invested all his dough in a doomed restaurant, and alone, barely a father to the 10-year-old son he lost in the divorce. He's a degenerate gambler, leaving piles of filthy lucre on underground poker-room tables. And he's not even a good fixer anymore: When first we see Clayton, he's stumbling around a spoiled suburbanite's kitchen, up to his ass in a run-of-the-mill drunk-driving case he would have easily made vanish with his magic wand once upon a long, long time ago.
It will take the audience a good long while to realize that the movie's earliest scenes are actually flash-forwards, but Gilroy's not using the commonplace device as some kind of a lookie-there-Ma trick. Rather than taking the audience out of the film (as was the case in 21 Grams , where the gimmick kept drawing our attention away from the story), the tactic here sucks us further into the point where an event seen and absorbed early on can still surprise the second time around. It appears as though Gilroy's learned a great deal from Steven Soderbergh , the first director to wring from Clooney a great performance when they first paired up on Out of Sight the movie that got Clooney to stop acting with his eyelids. Like Soderbergh, Gilroy uses the time-shifting device to heighten the disquieting surreality of the piece the audience, like the characters, is never sure of what's happening, only that one betrayal will lead to something worse.
It would seem an impossible (or at least a preposterously pretentious) trick, turning the commonplace "legal thriller" into something deeply felt. But Gilroy's up to the challenge, as is his uniformly astounding castClooney, especially, as the charmed and charming man stripped of his superpowers, but also Wilkinson and Swinton as the mirror images of each other, who find in a pile of legal documents absolute truths worth lying and dying for. Michael Clayton  has all the makings of something utterly familiar and ordinary, but it argues its case as anything but.
