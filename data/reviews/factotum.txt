         The low-life serenade writing style of the rebellious Charles Bukowski is an acquired taste, but the good news about "Factotum" is that you don't need to acquire it in order to thoroughly enjoy this playfully bleak piece of work.
 
 That's because "Factotum," based on a 1975 Bukowski novel, is actually a delicate melding of a trio of sensibilities that don't naturally cohere. It gracefully combines the bleak world of the despairing poet and novelist with the droll point of view of Norwegian director Bent Hamer and the distinctly American independent acting sensibility of stars Matt Dillon and Lili Taylor.
 


         






   This may sound ungainly, but the result is a surprisingly satisfying film, true to Bukowski and itself, a work that manages to make the man and his profane world more palatable without compromising on who he was and what he stood for.
 
 The voice of the disenfranchised and the by-alcohol-dispossessed, Bukowski, who died in 1994, recently returned to the news when his widow donated his literary archive to the prestigious Huntington Library. Considered a major literary figure in Europe, he's attracted cinematic notice before, in an informative documentary called "Bukowski: Born Into This" and in several fiction films, including "Barfly" (1987), in which his alter ego Henry Chinaski was played by Mickey Rourke.
 
 Director Hamer also has a noteworthy past: His charming "Kitchen Stories" was a surprise art-house hit a few years back. Assisted here by the mischievous music of Norway's Kristin Asbjornsen, who has turned some of Bukowski's poems into songs, "Factotum" displays the director's trademark absurdist sensibility and gift for whimsical humor.
 
  Though Bukowski lived most of his life in Los Angeles and set his writings here, "Factotum" has not only moved the time frame to the present but has also chosen to leave the city nameless while shooting very satisfactorily in much more Scandinavian Minneapolis.
 
 The dictionary defines "factotum" as someone who does all kinds of work, and the film opens with Chinaski (Dillon) gainfully employed at one of the oddest jobs imaginable, using a jackhammer to break up sheets of ice for delivery to customers in need of cooling.
 
 Within minutes, that job is history, but no matter. For a man who'll work anywhere once, including a bicycle supply warehouse and a pickle factory, what is one job more or less? Chinaski even finds employment at a reasonable facsimile of the Los Angeles Times, dusting a huge lobby statue called "Visions of Peace."
 
 The reason Chinaski leads such a hapless, listless, aimless life, struggling with small-time schemes and plans as he stumbles from one half-sodden situation to the next, is his full-time commitment to alcohol in quantities that would anesthetize a moose. "That may not sound noble," is how he puts it, "but it is my choice."
 
 As played with deadpan Buster Keaton grace by the gifted Dillon, who is maturing into one of the most unexpectedly involving of contemporary actors, Chinaski has a remarkable dignity and self-possession for a nominal down and outer.
 
 A wary, somewhat tentative man given to telling apoplectic bosses "I've given you my time, which is all any man has to give," Dillon's Chinaski has the can't-be-fazed confidence of someone who has seen the worst the world can throw at him and pretty much survived. There is a calmness to him even when he is furious, and, fleshed out with an involving voice-over that screenwriter Jim Stark has adapted from Bukowski's own writings, he is a character whose sense of humor is matched by his sense of self.
 
 Though he has a brief fling with the bar-hopping Laura (a fine Marisa Tomei), the love of Chinaski's life, at least as far as this film is concerned, is the unapologetic alcoholic Jan (Taylor), a co-religionist who is every bit the drinker and bottom feeder that Chinaski is. When they embark on joint benders, even figuring out what the time of day is can become a major challenge.
 
 "Factotum" hardly soft pedals these people; we see them at their physically and verbally abusive worst. But helped by superior acting by Dillon and the always excellent Taylor, who spark to each other here in the best possible way, we are also allowed a glimpse of the sweetness and the absurdity that coexist with the feckless squalor and bad behavior, and that is no small accomplishment.
 
 Helping "Factotum" manage this is director Hamer's instinctive minimalism. Chinaski and Jan are not typical movie alcoholics, they don't overdo things and fall down dead drunk. The delicacy of their actions forms a fine counterpoint to the extent of their dissipation, allowing us to understand what Chinaski means when he titles one of his short stories "My BeerSodden Soul Is Sadder Than All the Dead Christmas Trees in the World."
 
 For the other saving grace of Chinaski/Bukowski is that he is a writer, totally serious about himself and his work even though few other people know or care about what he is doing. "If you are going to try, go all the way or don't even start" is his creative philosophy. If you follow it, he says, "you will be alone with the gods. It is the only good fight there is." No matter how drunk he got, and few people got drunker, being true to that credo was what kept him alive.

A man on a bender may skulk from bar stool to alleyway to strip joint, staring into a whiskey glass as he spews a rant of self-justification, but to him that's not decadence; it's adventure  a reason for living. That was certainly the way that Charles Bukowski saw it. The celebrated Los Angeles author, who fashioned himself an American bohemian Dostoyevsky, may have lived on skid row and worked day jobs he couldn't have had more contempt for, but he drank hard, fought hard, screwed hard, and wrote hard  sometimes all night long. He poured more energy into being a bum than a lot of people do into ''honest'' middle-class lives.
Playing Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's fictional alter ego, in Factotum , which is based on Bukowski's 1975 novel, Matt Dillon gets a few crucial things right, notably the author's brusque, lord-of-the-streets grace, his way of uttering harsh thoughts in soft tones, as if he didn't expect to be listened to. Dillon's unsullied youthfulness takes getting used to  his face, still so free of worry lines; his movie-star hair  but he summons a rusted nobility that's right for Bukowski. It's too bad that the film was directed by the Norwegian minimalist Bent Hamer (Kitchen Stories ), who makes a fetish of building scenes around silence. As Chinaski's derelict muse, Lili Taylor calls up the poetry of desire, but this is the sort of movie in which nothing happens  in the worst sense. We get bits of Bukowski's thoughts in voice-over, but why bother with the cliché flaccid diary approach when what we want to see is Matt Dillon saying  these things, giving them to the audience?

 FOR years the boozy, beautiful  world of Charles Bukowski has proved catnip to European filmmakers and a few American actors happy to go along for the rough ride: Ben Gazzara, Mickey Rourke and now Matt Dillon. Bukowski’s own story (his parents moved to Los Angeles from Germany when he was 3) clearly holds attraction for certain creative types, as do all his tales of ordinary  madness. That many of those stories take place in Los Angeles may be particularly seductive, since few images telegraph the paradox of the American dream better than a drunk passed out in the shadow of Hollywood.  Hollywood, as sign or guiding principle, is nowhere to be found in “Factotum,” and there isn’t a palm tree in sight. Shot in a seedy, forlorn Minneapolis, far from that city’s green-canopied streets and Prairie School architecture, the film was directed by the wonderfully named Bent Hamer, a Norwegian whose earlier features include the deadpan comedy “Kitchen Stories.” Working with the producer Jim Stark, Mr. Hamer adapted the screenplay from the 1975 novel of the same title, with snippets from three other, more characteristically Bukowskian sounding volumes: “The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills” and the posthumous “What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire” and “The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship.”  Published when Bukowski was in his mid-50’s and starting to reach a wider readership, “Factotum” presents the age-old struggle of man against mediocrity. Henry Chinaski (Mr. Dillon), Bukowski’s familiar alter ego, is the heroic survivor of countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing, mind-deadening jobs. Or, as he puts it so nicely in the novel: “How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed”  — there is, naturally, a scatological dimension to this list  —  “brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?”  In “Factotum” Henry answers this most reasonable question mostly by trying to avoid working, or at least working too hard, for other people. (Bukowski himself toiled for the Postal Service for more than a decade.) To that end, he takes a succession of menial jobs that require him to polish the vainglorious décor of a newspaper building (he holds out hope, briefly, for a job as a reporter), jackhammer ice and sort pickles. He does all of this with degrees of competency and just enough interest to keep him from collapsing into a stupor, though on occasion he does drop into the nearest bar. There, in a flood of alcohol, he casts a bloodshot eye on the adjoining flotsam and jetsam, taking notes on the human condition.  Of course Bukowski-Chinaski was always working, even when he could barely hold down a job, sending out manuscripts and collecting, for many lean years, rejection notices. In “Factotum” Mr. Hamer shows us Henry coiled over a dimly lighted table, pressing his pen hard into sheets of paper, as the words float on the soundtrack. Mr. Dillon, wearing a beard and the flushed cheeks of a committed lush, sounds as persuasive as he looks. Whether he’s nuzzling another drunk (Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei take turns baring necks and psyches) or swapping philosophies with another shirker (Fisher Stevens), the actor delivers much of his dialogue with the hushed deliberation of a man who spends a lot of time in his head, which makes sense,  given the company he generally keeps.  Like the film itself, Mr. Dillon’s performance works through understatement. It’s easy to go big with Bukowski, the way that Barbet Schroeder did in his 1987 film, “Barfly,” in which a freewheeling Mickey Rourke plays a skid-row Puck in a theater of the damned. There are intimations of soul amid this film’s bloody grins and barstool gargoyles, but what it lacks is an appreciation for Bukowski’s tenderness, for those sighs of feeling that rise up when life is this hard, but the soul enduring it has not hardened in turn. Mr. Dillon’s phrasing carries the weight of such feeling, as does the hypnotically slowed gestures that give him the aspect of a man sitting at the bottom of a pool and thinking about drowning.  Henry doesn’t drown, though, as played by Mr. Dillon and interpreted by Mr. Hamer, he does wallow magnificently and often rather hilariously. “Factotum” is a film about the horrors and occasional comedy of work, as well as gutting through life on your own terms, which in Bukowski’s case meant turning both that horror and that comedy into literature. Even now, more than a decade after his death and well along into his canonization, there remains something genuinely liberating about his refusal to join the clock-puncher’s lockstep. Subversive might not be the right word with which to characterize his commitment to his art, his muse, his hip flask and the Big No, as in no to the straight and narrow, no to the clean and tidy. But it does have a nice ring.  “Factotum” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The language is blue, and you could get a contact high from the alcohol fumes.

Sophomore effort by Norwegian helmer Bent Hamer ("Kitchen Stories") reps an effortless blending of his offbeat Scandinavian sensibility with the quintessentially American down-and-out milieu. Based on writings by late novelist Charles Bukowski, story tells of author's frequently unemployed, alkie alter ego, played impeccably by Matt Dillon. Arguably one of the best adaptations of Bukowski's work, even compared with Bukowski's own script for 1997's "Barfly," deadpan timing and ace perfs bring out the morose humor and surprising warmth in the often miserabilist scribe's voice. Likely to click with hipster auds, pic should find gainful employment in urban areas and Euro territories.

Script is based on Bukowski's novel "Factotum" as well as several of his other books. Plot is more a picaresque string of adventures than a traditional three-acter. Living in unnamed city (pic was shot in MInneapolis), protag Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) drifts from woman to woman, apartment to hovel, and lousy job to lousy job. (Pic's onscreen subtitle is a parenthetical definition of factotum: "A Man Who Performs Many Jobs.")
Fired from ice-factory gig in the first scene of pic, Hank moves into a residential hotel and resumes writing, his only other passion, apart from drink. Voiceover explains that he sends unsolicited material continuously to the only publishing outfit he respects, the Black Sparrow Press (Bukowski's real-life publishers), even though nothing ever gets accepted. Occasionally, he grows discouraged with the perpetual rejections, but, then, Hank's voiceover explains, he reads any other writer and that gives him heart that he could still do better.
Hank meets fellow barfly Jan (Lili Taylor, superb) in a dive and soon the two are shacking up. Hamer's skilled directing and Dillon's poised delivery ensure that Hank's description of Jan as "an excellent fuck... (who) had a tight pussy and took it like it was knife that was killing her," somehow manages to sound affectionate rather than offensive.
When Hank starts making money as a bookie, Jan leaves him, and for a while he hooks up with a Laura (an almost recognizable Marisa Tomei), an on-call floozy for eccentric French millionaire Pierre (Didier Flammand) whom she shares with two other women (Adrienne Shelly and Karen Young).
That too ends, and, several dead-end jobs later (bicycle parts factory, statue cleaner, trainee taxi driver), movie doesn't so much end as simply stop, but not without a final kicker touch.
Reminiscent of early Jim Jarmusch films (which "Factotum" producer Jim Stark also worked on) and those by Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki, humor in Hamer's pic bubbles up from the deadpan rendering of simple comic vignettes, shot often in one or two take set-ups, that occasionally shade into melancholy.
Thesps deliver lines with laconic perfection, and resist too obvious word-slurring and stumbling when playing drunk, as their characters often are.
Lensing by Norwegian John Christian Rosenlund ("The Color of Milk," "Dragonfly") is the standout element in an overall classy tech package, favoring lighting schemes that seem to always suggest late afternoon with shafts of warm light falling into dusty interiors. Two of the non-source songs featured have lyrics by Bukowski himself.

Bent Hamer 's deadpan adaptation of the Charles Bukowski  novel has an appealing listlessness, but it begs the question: Is there anything left to learn from this material? The man who made an art of debauchery and a romance of the picaresque had few other subjects, and there's not much new in his alter ego's endless cycle of drink, cigarettes, sex, and fiction. As Hank Chinaski, Matt Dillon  adopts a Brando brow and hang-dog eyes, then thrusts his lower lip into his upper one to create Bukowski's salmon frown. The pose captures the author's apathetic bemusement with humor and grace, but to what end? He gets a job, loses it, drinks, writes, fucks, and then repeats the cycle. Nor is there much redemption in Lili Taylor  and Marisa Tomei , playing women sinking on the same ship as Chinaski. Taylor's sweetness bubbles up into a fine performance, extravagantly depraved, and Tomei surprises with a rich take on a woman who is neither young nor coy. But none of it goes anywhere. It's just stylized alcoholism with a tired wink.
