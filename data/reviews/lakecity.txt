The folks in Lake City  have more problems than mice at a cat convention. Or Sarah Palin at a Katie Couric interview. Or  well, you get the Southern-fried idea. On the run from drug thugs and with a kid in tow, a sad-eyed mook named Billy (Troy Garity) heads to the Virginia farm where his mama (Sissy Spacek) leads a lonely life of self-sufficiency. Why is Billy fleeing, and who's the kid? Wait and find out. (The Sopranos ' Drea de Matteo, in strung-out, smudged-mascara mode, has something to do with it.) Why is Mama melancholy in her small town of friendly neighbors? Keep waiting and find out about her Terrible Tragedy From the Past.
Why do these characters with woes so big affect us so little? The answer lies in the generic, undifferentiated indie stylings of writer-directors Hunter Hill and Perry Moore. The story is as impersonal as it is labored. And the filmmaking follows suit, with images that are blandly pretty (there's a South by Southeast  chase through a cornfield) and dialogue that's pretty bland. I hoped for something hot when Rebecca Romijn showed up as a local cop who knew Billy as a kid. But no luck: She just does standard small-town cop things, in uniform. C–

 It is foolish to expect an actor to work miracles, but for longtime moviegoers the name Sissy Spacek over a movie title promises that the film will have a core of integrity, at least in the scenes in which she appears. And when Ms. Spacek speaks her clichéd lines in the mediocre screenplay of “Lake City,” a movie that has delusions of high seriousness, her plain-spoken delivery lends them a resonance that is not in the written words.  Her character, Maggie, is a self-sufficient farmer living alone in rural Virginia who contemplates selling her homestead. The resolute set of her jaw and her flinty blue eyes, not to mention her comfortable old house with its lived-in furniture, evoke an inviolable solidity. At first the movie, with its richly saturated palette, seems to offer a sober yet lyrical portrait of contemporary Americana distilled in the figure of an independent woman of a certain age holding her head high.  When Maggie’s estranged, grown-up wastrel son, Billy (Troy Garity), who has been playing in a rock band in Memphis, returns unexpectedly and drags along a mysterious boy named Clayton (Colin Ford), Maggie takes them in without any fuss; questions and explanations are saved for later. Under her steady, watchful care, hearty meals are served, and the chaos of the world seems safely removed. As the camera surveys this austere country life, you prepare for a family drama that explores the possibility of restoring the luster to tarnished American dreams.  But “Lake City” soon deteriorates into a parental soap opera that plays coy games of hide and seek while dredging up a distant family tragedy for which Maggie blames herself. Even when those events are finally shown, the details are so cluttered that any sense of catharsis is lost. Billy and Clayton, who may or may not be Billy’s son, play out their own tortured drama of paternity and denial.  “Lake City” then dives headlong into ludicrous melodrama, as armed drug dealers, one played by the rocker Dave Matthews, show up in search of a missing stash. In a climactic sequence that suggests “No Country for Old Men”  filtered through “North by Northwest” and “Witness,” Maggie, Billy and Clayton flee for their lives into a cornfield.  The first feature written and directed by Perry Moore and Hunter Hill, “Lake City” feels like a movie whose story was slapped together during filming. Its three phases — Southern pastorale, Sudsville and Kablooie — don’t really connect.  When Billy is first seen, he is being tortured to reveal the whereabouts of Hope (Drea De Matteo), Clayton’s mother, who has presumably run off with the drugs. Hope belatedly and briefly appears when she storms into Maggie’s house to claim Clayton. Then she is gone. But the avenging furies are not far behind.  The acting is much stronger than the storytelling. As a sullen, weakling son with a chip on his shoulder, Mr. Garity gives a furtive, sidelong performance that lends Billy as much plausibility as the screenplay allows. Keith Carradine does the best he can with the phoniest character, Roy, a guitar-playing onetime roustabout who runs the local gas station and gazes longingly at an indifferent Maggie. Mr. Ford’s Clayton is the saddest character: a suspicious, damaged child whose trust in the adult world has been prematurely shattered.  “Lake City” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and scenes of violence.

In their debut outing, helmer-scribes Perry Moore and Hunter Hill fall victim to the Rapunzel fallacy: the belief that if you capture a star, he or she can spin cliche hay into cinematic gold. In "Lake City," Sissy Spacek faces down murderous drug dealers and races through the cornfields to protect her grandson in a Southern heartstring-tugger about the importance of family. Thesps -- including Dave Matthews (sans band), Drea de Matteo, Keith Carradine and Jane Fonda-offspring Troy Garity -- set off enough emotional tripwires to stave off bathos, but it's a near thing. Theatrical chances look dim. 
The filmmakers chose their icon well. Through "Coal Miner's Daughter," "The River," etc., Spacek's diminutive toughness and bone-deep commitment emerge as part of an untamed rural landscape, be it hillbilly Appalachia or the flood-dampened South.
But, Moore and Hill's script plunges Spacek in a mawkish stew of banality and improbability composed of bits and pieces of earlier roles. She plays Maggie, a steadfast farmwoman resisting all offers to sell out to developers, having found serenity living alone on her ancestral Virginia acres.
Maggie's peace is shattered by the arrival of prodigal son Billy (Garity), dragging behind him a whole urban action-film load of complications. First, there is Billy's own recently discovered son Clayton (Colin Ford), dumped on him by Clayton's mother Hope (Drea de Matteo), who took off with a fortune in cocaine. Now Billy is on the run from a drug dealer (Matthews) who thinks he knows Hope's whereabouts.
Maggie struggles to set things right with a mix of self-sacrifice, chutzpah and a little help from her friends (including laid-back would-be suitor Keith Carradine and Rebecca Romijn as a sexy cop with a weakness for Billy). Fragmented flashbacks and pregnant silences signal a past tragedy that still separates Maggie from Billy.
Tech credits tend to work against the script's pure treacle, lenser Robert Gantz casting a fine golden glow over the lush Virginia terrain and onto Spacek's face.

Troy Garity  has a rangy, lonesome-stranger body and pouchy eyes. He can boot a cigarette butt to the curb like a champ and fill a frame with the handsome, so-what lure of damaged goods; in a better world, and a better movie, he'd have the ladies sighing, the gentlemen nodding, and all parties clamoring for more. Instead, Garity brings little more than moves to Billy, the troubled baby-daddy and narc-anon member he plays in Lake City  ; added to the general torpidity and twangy tropes of this Southern family drama is the discomfort of watching a natural actor force it. As Billy's mother, Maggie, Sissy Spacek  fares a little better, if only because she's had more experience bravely telegraphing through even the roughest terrain. After a nasty run-in with a drug dealer (Dave Matthews ), Billy seeks haven at his family's Virginia homestead with Clayton  (Colin Ford ), a surly young boy of uncertain provenance, in tow. Mother and son have an uneasy bond that should be familiar to anyone who has ever seen a movie in which a child's room has been preserved and locked tight. That bond is examined, tested, and finally renewed following a violent denouement that bleeds any lingering patience you might have for this film right through your eyeballs.
