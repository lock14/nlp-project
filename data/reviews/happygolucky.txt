The sunshiny primary-school teacher nicknamed Poppy (Sally Hawkins) in Mike Leigh's exuberant comedy Happy-Go-Lucky  is the kind of relentless optimist one might worry about in real life. Doesn't this woman ever stop beaming and twittering? Living with her best friend (an indispensably vibrant Alexis Zegerman) in a cheery boho flat, Poppy experiences theft, a wrenched back, a troubled young student, a deranged homeless man, a hypercritical sister, and a really angry, uptight, apoplectically weird driving instructor (the marvelous Eddie Marsan). And still she laughs. What's wrong with her?
The point is, nothing. The London universe Leigh creates (employing his trademark improv techniques to unite his ensemble, many of whom make their film debuts) isn't so much a reality as a hope, and an invitation to find joy and grace in everyday moments. It's a wish all the more endearing coming from a filmmaker best known for drabber dramas of family dysfunction and British miserablism like Vera Drake  and Secrets & Lies . And that grace is made manifest by Hawkins' sparkling performance in a role the filmmaker created specifically for her twiggy charms. Hawkins imbues Poppy with an innate effervescence that plays off beautifully against adversity. Leigh, meanwhile, cushions those adversities with bright texture and jolly music, concluding with an image of realistic contentment  in a rowboat, on a lake  that's hard to beat at a time when we really need it. A–

 If you know the British filmmaker Mike Leigh’s work — early and later titles like “Bleak Moments,” “Naked” and “Vera Drake” — you may find yourself watching his most recent movie, “Happy-Go-Lucky,” with mounting unease, a tinge of dread. Despite the extraordinary human parade that has passed in front of his lens, laughing and raging, yearning for love and asking for cuddles, Mr. Leigh has never been an artist for whom happy (word or idea) has been an easy fit. Life is sweet, as the title of another of his films puts it with a heart-swelling yes, but it’s also an eternal fight against doom and gloom, the soul-crushing no.  The push and pull between yes and no animates all of his work, investing it with narrative tension and a sense of artistic purpose that is, whether overtly articulated or not, also insistently, vigorously left-leaning. The hard-working and often besieged characters who populate his stories live in worlds partly defined, if not wholly circumscribed, by ideology and the state. Nobody mounts a soapbox or whistles “The Internationale” in “Happy-Go-Lucky,” but the film is so closely tuned to the pulse of communal life, to the rhythms of how people work, play and struggle together, it captures the larger picture along with the smaller. Like Poppy, the bright focus of this expansive, moving film, Mr. Leigh isn’t one to go it alone.  Played by a glorious Sally Hawkins — a gurgling, burbling stream of gasps, giggles and words — Poppy rides into “Happy-Go-Lucky” on a bicycle, with daytime London and the film’s opening credits slipping past her. She looks lost in thought (not lost) and wonderfully content. The bike soon goes missing (“We didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye,” she murmurs), but Poppy keeps moving forward and dancing and jumping and laughing and nodding her dark, delicate head as if she were agreeing not just with this or that friend but also with life itself. She’s altogether charming or perhaps maddening — much depends on whether you wear rose-colored specs — recognizably human and every inch a calculated work of art.  Mr. Leigh’s characters look as if they live in the world rather than in a movie, but are actually painstakingly conceived through an involved and lengthy collaboration between him and his actors that begins with improvisatory rehearsals and results in a tightly structured shooting script. Poppy, short for Pauline, a pixieish 30-year-old partial to bright blues (as if she were dressing with pieces of sky), is one of his most persuasive optimists, though Mr. Leigh tries to obscure her appeal with some early misdirection. Not long after her bike ride, Poppy and some girlfriends materialize at an ear-piercingly noisy club, bouncing in unison to the numbing sonic throb, only to then dissolve together into a silly, girly puddle.  Before you can start huffing superiority, Poppy and her roommate, Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, tastily tart to Poppy’s sugar), are joking about Stravinsky and “The Rite of Spring,” a bit of high-cultural name-dropping that feels as if it had been specifically designed to tweak the audience’s class assumptions. Mr. Leigh has a documentarian’s eye for unadorned reality — his people and places look equally lived in — and his dialogue has the ebb and flow, the swells and eddies and logjams of ordinary conversation. His characters often talk in circles instead of direct lines, clucking and offering cups of tea. But the dramatist in Mr. Leigh is always hard at work, aligning his characters for maximum narrative effect and emotional pow.  That’s true even if “Happy-Go-Lucky” seems as lighthearted as the bobbing bloom at its center. In some ways, the film feels like a coda to Mr. Leigh’s splenetic 1993 drama “Naked,” about an angry young man, Johnny, with a severe case of logorrhea. Words are weapons for Johnny, who uses them to prop himself up and tear everyone else down, while for Poppy, a primary-school teacher, they’re more of a caress. They’re also invariably outwardly directed (“Bless ’em,” she says with believable habit) and often accompanied by and obscured by hiccups of laughs and giggles. These yelps of joy at first make her seem a touch demented (a bookstore clerk’s silence suggests as much), a prejudice Mr. Leigh is delighted to demolish.  Movies sometimes seem made for misery, for rivers of tears, stormy skies and third-act woe. Happiness is for suckers and Disney Inc. But happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and in “Happy-Go-Lucky” it’s also a question of faith. Poppy isn’t a celluloid saint: she lusts like a real woman and nurses plenty of pints to go along with her loneliness. She also betrays herself and her neediness in a series of amazingly paced and played scenes that find her taking weekly driving lessons from Scott (Eddie Marsan, in a boldly repellent turn), a seething lump of rage and resentment whom she soon sends hurtling around the bend. Horribly funny and often just horrible, the lessons distill individual relationships to their stop-and-go lurching essence.  Nothing and everything happens in “Happy-Go-Lucky”: Poppy chatters and wanders, teaches and learns. At one point, she takes flamenco lessons (from a sternly funny Karina Fernandez), doing her best to hold a pose that the instructor likens to that of an eagle. But grand poses don’t come naturally to Poppy, who, earlier in the story, dresses up like a chicken to the delight of her students. She’s made of humbler stuff, human stuff, which Mr. Leigh tenderly expresses in a surrealistic interlude that finds her wandering through a garden and arriving at a kind of Joycean nightscape where a visibly disturbed, gibbering homeless man (Stanley Townsend) asks her again and again, “Know what I mean?” “Yeah,” says Poppy, reaching across the abyss. “I do.”  “Happy-Go-Lucky” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Expletives.

Nearly four years after his dark period drama �Vera Drake,� iconic Brit helmer Mike Leigh is back with �Happy-Go-Lucky,� his mellowest work yet, and his most purely entertaining. Effervescent comedy offers a lighthearted slice of life seen through eyes of a free-spirited London schoolteacher, replete with lessons of various sorts and humorous comparisons of teaching methods. Less pointed and edgy than anything in Leigh�s oeuvre except �Career Girls,� it still gets by on its own diverting charms. Opening in Blighty on April 18, brightly designed pic should come near Leigh�s best domestic grosses and will be appreciated in arthouses worldwide. 
Thirty-year-old Poppy (Sally Hawkins) is an ever-smiling optimist who tries to brighten the days of everyone she encounters with constant chatter and jokes. Colorfully clad, with jingling jewelry and clattering high-heeled boots, she�s also the type of person whose unending cheeriness can exasperate the morose mopes who often populate Leigh�s universe. However, unlike some of his past heroines, her external mannerisms don�t seem to mask underlying insecurities or hidden secrets. 
Poppy teaches tots in a North London school as multicolored as the rainbow necklace she wears. For 10 years, she�s lived with fellow teacher and best pal Zoe (Alexis Zegerman), whose wry calmness makes her an excellent foil to Poppy�s breathless enthusiasm.
After her bike is stolen, Poppy decides to take driving lessons from the Axle School of Motoring (motto: �Good driving is no accident�). She and tightly wound instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan) have something of a personality clash as he tries to enforce rigid teaching methods; their subsequent encounters provides pic�s main drama.
 Poppy also accompanies colleague Heather (Sylvestra le Touzel) to flamenco class, where passionate Spanish teacher (Karina Fernandez) puts the group of uptight Brits through their paces to hilarious effect.
Poppy eventually hooks up with Tim (Samuel Roukin), a social worker from the school system who admires her compassionate spirit. This development doesn�t go over well with Scott, leading to pic�s most dramatic confrontation.
Not since �Naked� has a Leigh pic concentrated so completely on a sole character, with Hawkins� Poppy in every scene. In contrast to Johnny�s dark and disturbing journey through the city in �Naked,� Poppy�s peregrinations through London are completely life-affirming.
With vivid characterizations from the entire ensemble cast derived from Leigh�s trademark lengthy rehearsal process, pic feels as though it could have profitably spun in many different directions. Flavorsome scenes with sisters Suzy (Kate O�Flynn) and Helen (Caroline Martin) and brother-in-law Jamie (Oliver Maltman) suggest more going on beneath the surface. Indeed, several catalogs list the running time at 158 minutes, indicating scenes were left on the cutting-room floor.
Coming in at nearly two hours, pic unfolds at a good pace, slowed down only by a lengthy scene where Poppy tries to help a homeless man (Stanley Townsend).
Thin, fine-boned Hawkins, so good in small parts in Leigh�s �Vera Drake� and �All or Nothing,� manages to make what initially appears to be a scatty, irritating character ultimately endearing. Dark-haired and hazel-eyed, she sparks visual memories of Katrin Cartlidge, a favorite Leigh ensemble member who died in 2002.
 Marsan (also from �Vera Drake�) gets some of the pic�s best dialogue, with long, paranoid rants about �the system.� His use of mnemonics to cue proper driving doesn�t rub off on Poppy, but �Enraha!� will surely be one of film�s most-quoted lines.
Shooting the first Leigh pic in widescreen, regular d.p. Dick Pope has fun with the frame -- from Poppy�s bouncing into sight from below during trampoline lessons to a full-body horizontal view of her at the osteopath afterwards. Playful opening-credits sequence divides the screen into thirds.
Rest of the tech package is fine, although Gary Yershon�s jaunty string- and horn-filled score is, like Poppy, sometimes a little irritating. 


It's uncommon these days to see movies with women in strong central roles. Rarer still, at least outside the tele-phantasmagoria of American politics, is the notion of woman as self-created, free-spirited, history-making individual.
This week, there are two. Max Ophüls's 1955 Lola Montès   may be the ultimate portrait of a world-historical diva, albeit a martyred one (in a martyred movie), ultimately petrified by her own glamour. By contrast, the protag of Mike Leigh 's Happy-Go-Lucky  is less distant star than warming ray of sunshine. There's nothing aristocratic about Poppy: She's a modestly gaudy people's heroine industriously repairing the social world, one frayed interaction at a time.
After extended cameos in two previous Leigh films (as a resourceful pop tart in All or Nothing  and the date-raped rich girl in Vera Drake  ), fine-boned Sally Hawkins  shoulders the burden of every scene as the most relentlessly upbeat 30-year-old kindergarten teacher ever to bicycle London's chartered streets. The blithe spirit who animates Happy-Go-Lucky  is a priestess of positive polarization; she's either irritating or endearing—whichever you find her, you have to wonder why.
Poppy is introduced pedaling through traffic, grin on her face and hair in the wind. Idly browsing a bookstore (and utterly failing to engage the surly clerk), she spots a title on the shelf and chirps, "The Road to Reality —don't want to be going there." Indeed, Poppy can smile even when her bike is stolen: "Oh, no! I didn't even get a chance to say good-bye." And when she hurts her back in the course of a daily regimen on the trampoline, she's able to laugh through the pain. Poppy, in short, is a very cheerful girl, and that cheer is her good fortune.
Heroic optimism is a surprising ploy in the post-Soviet cosmos. Walking out of this daringly non-ironic movie, a less enthusiastic colleague characterized Poppy as "the Idiot"—as in the Dostoevsky  novel. It's an illuminating comparison. Generous, guileless, and self-effacing to a fault, Dostoevsky's saintly Prince Myshkin has a catalytic effect on the fallen, grown-up society in which he moves. As does Leigh's "idiotic" heroine.
With her sharp features, toothy smile, and bright eyes, Hawkins has the creature cuteness of a Disney  chipmunk. Her character is naturally friendly, pleased to make eye contact with strangers, an empathetic fount of jokey banter and playful innuendo. (Typically dressed in Fauvist floral prints, clashing textured tights, and high-heeled cowgirl boots, Poppy is also fun to watch—"She's a rainbow," as the Rolling Stones  once sang with a sarcasm that the movie never even remotely approaches.) One ponders the mystery of Poppy's personality, waiting for the meds to wear off. They never do, although midway through the movie, there's a surprising flash of seriousness revealed in her response to an incident of schoolyard bullying.
Even more than most of Leigh's collectively developed films, Happy-Go-Lucky  is a movie about an actor's performance. But it's also deeply concerned with the nature of pedagogy. Poppy not only teaches, she also learns. Leigh extracts maximum vaudeville from the wildly melodramatic flamenco class his protagonist attends, and unobtrusively constructs his narrative around her five lessons with the tightly wound, increasingly nutty driving instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan , another graduate of Vera Drake , in a furious, spittle-spewing performance that equals Hawkins's in intensity). Amiable as she is, Poppy can't help teasing this paranoid crank—"You celebrate chaos!" he shouts at her—but she does learn from their interactions, each of which has a message all its own building up to the movie's climax.
Poppy's innate concern, her refusal to judge and willingness to listen to anybody, is demonstrated when she meets another sort of madman in a spot desolate enough to serve as the set for a Beckett play. These encounters—spluttering Scott and a muttering vagrant—afford the movie's most intense interactions, although Poppy, who never breaks character, is always relating. She's given an equally good-natured and unflappable housemate (Alexis Zegerman ) with whom to riff, as well as pupils, sisters—one clownishly sullen, the other fearfully judgmental—and colleagues of both genders.
As the critic Harold Rosenberg  observed, Dostoevsky's Myshkin is "less a dramatic figure than an edifying one," and, in writing The Idiot , the author was urgently seeking something beyond art—namely that which "man can be." It would be unfair to burden the entertaining and occasionally glib Happy-Go-Lucky  with such weighty intent, but, for all his reputation as a sour miserablist, Leigh has made some blatantly utopian movies—most obviously his paean to popular art, Topsy-Turvy , and, in a different register, the pro-choice passion play Vera Drake .
More than a few critics were troubled by the unrealistically safe saline abortions performed by Vera Drake 's angelic outlaw heroine. But in opposing a criminal state, this warmhearted busybody embodied the promise of a more enlightened social order—the safe, reassuring abortionist of the future. So it is with the altruistic Poppy, whose adult devotion to education and occasionally expressed childish desire to fly seem to herald a further stage of human development.
Will this lighthearted creature fulfill her earthly mission? At the very least, the spectacle of Poppy's devotion and desire, not to mention her all-around sunny disposish, left this viewer feeling unaccountably happy—at least for the moment.
