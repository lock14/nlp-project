We bring you this breaking business report: The sky is falling.
At least over the house that Walt built. The word is that negotiations between Pixar
 and the Walt Disney
 Company are being put on hold this weekend pending the release of ''Chicken Little," Disney's first in-house attempt at a digital-animation blockbuster along the lines of Pixar's ''The Incredibles" and ''Toy Story" (and DreamWorks' ''Shrek" and ''Shark Tale").
I repeat: The sky is falling. ''Chicken Little" is shiny and peppy, with some solid laughs and dandy vocal performances, but even a small child may sense how forced this movie is -- how hard it tries to be all things to all audiences. As for parents, they won't be able to miss the baling wire holding the story together. The film is being released to selected theaters in ''Disney Digital 3D" as well as the regular 2-D version this critic watched, and, in truth, it needs all the bells and whistles it can get.
The primary problem with ''Chicken Little" is that it's two movies, each of which cancels out the other. The first half is a gentle fable about a misfit cockerel (voice of ''Scrubs" star Zach Braff) who can't seem to bond with his kindly jock dad, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall); there's much talk of ''closure" between the sight gags, and the film occasionally stops in its chicken tracks so characters can share their emotions while listening to drippy soundtrack songs.
Older kids will get itchy with all this touchy-feely stuff even as their younger siblings may find it reassuring. Those same toddlers, however, will probably freak when the movie suddenly turns into ''War of the Worlds Jr."
See, Chicken Little was bopped on the head by a sky-colored hexagon that promptly vanished, causing no end of derision from the good animal folk of Oakey Oaks. A year passes, and the movie seems to climax early with a baseball game in which the little fella unexpectedly saves the day. (I hope I'm not spoiling things for grown-ups reading this. As for you kids, put the newspaper down right now and walk away.) Then he's hit by another sky-tile, and this time he has back-up witnesses in his nerdy school pals Abby ''Ugly Duckling" Mallard (Joan Cusack), neurotic Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina), a guppy in a water-filled diving helmet.
The tile comes from the underside of a UFO; the friends suddenly realize their town is on the verge of being overrun by alien robots with long, whippy arms (they look like evil octopus sperm, so help me God). ''Chicken Little" introduces a cute, fuzzy alien baby to help this go down more easily -- and you can bet you'll be able to buy the tie-in toy as soon as you leave the theater -- but the fact remains the movie has gone dark in a hurry. An overly fast wrap-up only adds to the sense of CGI multiple-personality disorder: The film's a weird slumgullion of ''funny aminal" comedy, personal growth, and alien invasion. With classic disco hits.
The only part that really works is the comedy: The gags are bright and they keep on coming, tossed over the plate with the fizzy topical references any self-respecting family comedy has to have these days. ''The Wizard of Oz," Cosmopolitan magazine, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark," the cinematic cliches of baseball movies -- all come in for a wink and a nudge and the occasional bare-faced theft. (The producers of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure" called -- they want their ending back.)
You don't mind too much, though, because the timing's sharp and the casting is deep and pleasurable. Wallace Shawn, Patrick Stewart, Amy Sedaris, Fred Willard, and Harry Shearer show up for small bits, and even if Don Knotts doesn't do much as Mayor Turkey Lurkey, I'm just glad the man's still working. And all movies, live or animated, should have Joan Cusack in them.
Still, ''Chicken Little" doesn't come close to the genius ease of Pixar -- the way John Lasseter's company turns out movies that effortlessly click on all levels. This is the difference between filmmaking that's organic and ''property" creation based on market-tested blueprints and careful retrofitting. The worker bees at Walt Disney Feature Animation have disassembled the Pixar model to its gears and springs and put it back together, and all that's missing is the soul.

         The classic story of Chicken Little, soon to be obscured by the new, computer-generated Disney version, is a cautionary tale about the dangers of overreacting to iffy conclusions and circumstantial evidence: A chicken gets beaned by a falling acorn, deduces that the sky is falling and promptly incites mass hysteria, endangering herself and her friends when a cunning fox takes advantage of the general mayhem.
 
  The movie has nothing in common with the fairy tale other than an eponymous chicken and an incidental acorn. But there do seem to be parallels between the fairy tale and the events leading up to Disney's first foray into computer-generated animation. The disappointing results of recent hand-drawn features such as "Home on the Range" and "Brother Bear" ("Bear's" screenwriters Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman also wrote "Chicken Little" with Ron Anderson) combined with the concurrent success of Disney-distributed Pixar films such as "The Incredibles" has led the studio to conclude that the future of animation does not include pencils.
 


         






    It may be too soon to say if Disney has thrown out the baby instead of the stale bathwater by shuttering its hand-drawn animation department. (On this, it's probably safe to say that traditionalists and geeks will be split down the middle.) More problematic, though, is the idea that for its animated features to have a more "global appeal," they need to be, you know, like, cool. 
Of all things, this is a hard one to manufacture. "Chicken Little," though it has its moments, mostly just feels anxious and overreaching. It tries to be all things to all people and fails to be anything to anyone.
 
  With their hard, plushy-shaped bodies and lazy-lidded eyes, the multi-species residents of Oakey Oaks (an antiseptic slice of Restoration Hardware Americana) have the childish look of Disney theme park characters molded in plastic. But Chicken Little (Zach Braff) and his friends, a "Three Little Pigs"-inspired porker named Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), an ugly duckling called Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) and a scuba helmet-wearing fish named Fish Out of Water, are meant to be contemporary teenagers — though, oddly, they are contemporary teenagers conversant in '80s movies, '70s dance hits and women's magazine pop psychology. The frenetic pace and satiric real-world allusions (like when Little finds himself surrounded by reporters with microphones) don't jibe with the cutesy small-town imagery, and the character design lacks the kind of stylistic unity required to fully buy into an alternate universe like this one. Basically, the tone just feels off — the movie looks too young for older kids, acts too old for younger kids and is much too hyper for adults.
 
  The movie begins when Chicken Little is hit on the head by something he believes to be a piece of the sky, incites pandemonium and soon finds himself at the center of a media maelstrom. But when his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall), publicly dismisses his story, Little becomes the town laughingstock. A year later, barely able to show his face in public, he desperately seeks to regain his father's respect by joining the baseball team. Later, he saves the world from an alien invasion.
 
  This is not so much a story as a series of events, so it relies "Shrek"-like — for energy, excitement and huge chunks of plot — on other movies. The relentless references to "Back to the Future," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "War of the Worlds" and "Aliens" will no doubt have first-graders nodding in smug recognition, that is if they're not too scared by the death-ray shooting tripods come to obliterate Oakey Oaks or by the harvested vital organs hung out to dry on the mother ship. This frenetic allusion compulsion, which already feels about as fresh and organic as an old McNugget, is underscored by a grating soundtrack of dance hits from the '70s, '80s and '90s (Gloria Gaynor, the Bee Gees, the Spice Girls, C+C Music Factory — the really old gang's all here) and anthem-style '80s rock. Particularly awful is the theme song, "One Little Slip," by Barenaked Ladies, which "musicalizes" (publicity-speak) the chicken's social anxiety with lyrics like: "A cup of good intentions, a tablespoon of one big mess, a dash of overreaction...." It's hard to tell if you're supposed to be feeling something or baking a cupcake.
 
  Its best gags are visual (there's a good one where panicked lemmings jump off a park bench when they can't find a cliff), but "Chicken Little" relies far too much on mean-spirited fat and ugly jokes at the expense of Runt and Abby to come off as cute. It's as if the studio had decided to throw off its wholesomeness like tear-away pants. Some of the grown-up jokes are tired and flat — the thoroughly Oprah-ized Abby rattles on and on about the importance of "closure" between Little and his dad. But at other times, the allusions are so random and bewildering that they suggest perhaps more than was intended. Runt, for instance, is a morbidly obese pig with an anxiety disorder who sings Bee Gees tunes to relax. When he misbehaves, his mother threatens to take away his Streisand records. Forget that the target audience for this movie is unlikely to know who Streisand is, let alone what records are. And why suggest that Runt is gay only to make a joke at his expense?
 
  It would be one thing if this were just another tone-deaf movie, but "Chicken Little" is an example of the kind of reactionary thinking the fairy tale derides.
 
  Ironically, the original story of Chicken Little is more pointed, caustic and relevant than anything that wound up on screen, and it could have been harnessed into something smart and cathartic for both kids and parents. But the movie falls into a trap any unpopular kid can tell you is a big mistake — it tries way too hard.

Chicken Little , Disney's first fully computer-animated feature film, is a takeoff on the famous fable about the flustered fowl who gets conked on the head with an acorn and overreacts, convinced that the sky is falling. Accordingly, no conclusion will be drawn here about a sky-wide decline in Disney's storytelling capabilities based solely on the company's first direct bid to match the achievements of Pixar and DreamWorks.
Instead, focus will remain on the banality of the acorns dropped in this particular endeavor, another in a new breed of mass-market comedy that substitutes self-reference for original wit and pop songs for emotional content.
Production notes boast that Chicken Little himself (voiced by Scrubs ' Zach Braff with generic ebullience) is computer-clad in more than 76,000 individual feathers, but what the cluck do we care about erisimilitude of plumage when the issues between the scrawny hero and his father (Garry Marshall) are so derivative? Dad's a single parent who at first doesn't believe in his son, until the arrival of real danger ignored by the town's adults, and squawk squawk squawk.
The tech complexity employed to replicate muscle movement doesn't make up for the simplistic colorlessness of the characters  including a recycled trio of fellow outsiders as Little's friends and a standard collection of naysayers and oddballs among his adversaries. Each represents a joke delivered before, and better, by Finding Nemo , The Incredibles , Shrek , and the vast heaven of TV sitcoms. What falls in Chicken Little  are hopes.

 It has been something of an article of faith in the movie industry lately that two-dimensional feature-length animation is obsolete. The kids supposedly want the shiny new 3-D, computer-generated critters and monsters and have no appetite for old-fashioned drawn and tinted cels. Evidence for this trend has been found in the lackluster performance of some of Disney's recent animated features, which seemed not to be capturing the imaginations of audiences enchanted by Buzz Lightyear and Shrek.  So Disney stepped away from the 2-D business on which its empire had been founded and set about catching up with Pixar, its sometime partner, and with DreamWorks. "Chicken Little" is the first Disney-produced computer-animated film, and its publicity material announces that the 3-D version being released in some theaters "has the distinction of ushering in a revolutionary new digital 3-D motion-picture viewing experience." Cluck, cluck! It also has the distinction of being a terrible movie - a hectic, uninspired pastiche of catchphrases and clichés, with very little wit, inspiration or originality to bring its frantically moving images to genuine life.  The story begins tongue-in-beak, with a sendup of the familiar barnyard fable. In a town full of rubbery anthropomorphic animals, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) is a brainy, nerdy fellow who alarms the town with news that the sky is falling. After a year of ridicule - during which he becomes a local laughingstock, and subject of a forthcoming movie - he is ready to move on, as is his father, a nervous widower named Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall).  "Widower"  should be the tip-off that, computer-generated or not, we are safely in the familiar land of dead mommies, where entertainment is wrapped in family therapy. Buck and Chicken Little have a lot of healing to do, a process helped by  Abby Mallard  (Joan Cusack) and accomplished through dreadfully teary soundtrack songs and moments of wet-eyed bonding.  Of course, such sentimentality cannot stand alone. It must be complemented - and also, in a sense, subverted - by jokey pop-culture humor and a kitchen-sink plot. So we have a pig named Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), who is passionate about 70's Top 40 hits, giving us a chance to groove, with sagging irony, to Gloria Gaynor and the Bee Gees for the thousandth time. Then, since the idea of a town populated by farm animals is apparently insufficiently exciting for today's sensation-addicted youngsters, there is an alien invasion right out of "War of the Worlds."  Disney, the great pioneer of American family entertainment, has apparently been reduced to turning out knockoffs of well-known products, its own and those of its competitors. Chicken Little's knack for inventions and his posse of misfit friends owes a lot to Jimmy Neutron. There are not one but two cute, antic sidekick types: a fish (whose diver's helmet and incomprehensible chirping is weirdly reminiscent of Kenny on "South Park") and a fuzzy, three-eyed orange alien.  Not to be Chicken Littleish about it, but our children deserve better. They will clamor to see this heavily advertised movie and beg for the tie-in merchandise, and the resulting revenue will be taken as an affirmation of quality. But "Chicken Little" joins "Shark Tale," "Robots" and "Madagascar" as the latest evidence that technical novelty is a cheap - or, rather, a very expensive - substitute for good storytelling and memorable characters.

Disney's first inhouse all-CG animated feature, "Chicken Little," lives up to its name by serving up a fraction of what audiences are used to getting in this department from Pixar and DreamWorks -- little originality, little humor and little ingratiating characterization. Under-nourishing and highly derivative fast-food item probably will ring up less B.O. than most of the high-flying animated features of recent holiday seasons, although the Disney imprimatur and marketing muscle still will send it on a highly profitable journey through every segment of its commercial playoff.
Unprepossessing pic feels secondhand in all respects: It spins off a tiresomely familiar fairy tale, takes place in the sort of idealized small town that's long since come to feel shopworn, references pop culture touchstones as laboriously as did "Shark Tale," spotlights a father-son dynamic that blandly echoes that of "Finding Nemo," is upfront in poaching from "War of the Worlds" for its dramatic climax and comes in a distant second to "Jimmy Neutron" in the coolness of its outer space gizmos and creatures. In short, "Chicken Little" looks recycled inside and out.
One could go further and say the film apes "Ice Age" in that the action hinges on an acorn, or at least what appears to be one. Upon being beaned, the diminutive and bespectacled title character (voiced by Zach Braff), who sports a large white head atop a wimpy torso, throws the town of Oakey Oaks into a tizzy by insisting the heavens above are about to land upon the citizenry's heads.
When this fails to come to pass, the newly minted and pointedly unathletic social outcast determines to win his widower father's respect by excelling at baseball. Pennant-deciding game fills up the first act in ho-hum fashion but doesn't resolve everything with dad (Garry Marshall, Bronx accent conspicuous in context); that provokes one of Chicken Little's buddies, the web-footed Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), to go on in tedious jargon about finding "closure" and staging an "intervention" that no doubt will resonate deeply with all the 8-year-olds in the audience.
Rounding out the scintillating group of central characters are a disturbingly overweight young porker named Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), who's into Streisand records and can be relied upon to overreact hysterically to all occurrences; and Fish Out of Water, who wears a water-filled diving helmet (the reverse of Sandy in "SpongeBob SquarePants") and therefore cannot utter a single intelligible word.
When flying saucers arrive and cough up aggressive robotic octopi with long thin tentacles, there is legitimate concern that the local population, and specifically dad, may not believe the feathered pariah's warnings. It takes a while for everyone to figure out what the extraterrestrials are really up to, but Chicken Little's role in resolving matters favorably is deemed sufficiently inspiring to warrant an elaborate bigscreen telling, "Chicken Little: The True Story," SRO preem of which serves as the final scene.
Penned by the team of Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman, who wrote Disney's pallid "Brother Bear," along with newcomer Ron Anderson, the script aspires to "Shrek"-like impudence and wit, but cannot transcend its conventional thinking and attitudes on matters big and small. Borderline frantic pace resembles that of the directing-producing team of Mark Dindal and Randy Fullmer's 2000 Disney feature "The Emperor's New Groove."
Visuals are bright without being distinguished, while John Debney's eclectic score is all but overwhelmed by an avalanche of mostly '70s pop hits.

In its first computer-animated feature without Pixar , Disney  shirks the wit of Toy Story 2  and Monsters, Inc.  in favor of the blandness of Saturday-morning cartoons. Of course, as every babbling-stage child knows, the story of the world's most famous avian alarmist shouldn't take 78 minutes to tell. Disney distends it into an exercise in talk-to-your-dad-ism, casting Chicken Little (Zach Braff ) as a nerdy runt of a bird who loses the confidence of his father (Garry Marshall ) after causing a town-wide panic by claiming that the sky is falling. One year later, his humiliation compounded by the imminent release of Crazy Little Chicken: The Movie , Chicken can't catch a break in schoolhe's stuck with an unconscionably high locker, perennially relegated to the "unpopular" dodgeball team, and consistently late to sheep-speak class (every answer is "baa"). The usual pop-culture jokes, disco tunes, and sarcastic narrator are on hand to prevent atrophy, but by the time the sky really does start "falling"courtesy of an alien invasion Chicken Little 's frantic efforts to stay farm fresh have started to wear on the nerves.
