Few things can shake the timbers of liberal complacency like observing how third world citizens manage to support themselves in a New (or old) World Order. In this video documentary, we visit Cerro Rico , a massive Bolivian mountain whose hundreds of dying silver minesdating back to the 16th century, when Spaniards enslaved the natives to extract oreare still being drilled by desperate villagers, many of them children. Contrasting the magnificent mountainscapes outside with the claustrophobic hellishness inside, the filmmakers focus on one 14-year-old boy, his cheek stuffed with coca leaves, his day divided between school and subterranean darkness. He's our guide into this centuries-old mutant- Christian culture, in which Jesus belongs to the outside world and the mines belong to the Devil, every mine coming equipped with an ancient horned-deity shrine, to which alms must be paid for safety's sake. Perhaps little more than an object lesson in the end, the movie's nevertheless a sobering day trip, more for its hints of a forgotten history of culture collision than its sensible but rote socioeconomic sympathies.
