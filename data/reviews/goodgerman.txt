         The first scene of Steven Soderbergh's "The Good German," which is set in Berlin at the end of World War II, instantly calls to mind Roberto Rossellini's "Germany Year Zero." The last scene is a dead ringer for "Casablanca." Book-ended between the neo-realist beginning and the iconic ending is a film noir done in the classic style. Using vintage lenses, black-and-white film (high-contrast color stock with the color pulled out, but close enough), Hollywood back lots, rear-projection, expressionistic angles, an old-fashioned score, a morally compromised hero, an alluring femme fatale and a very bleak view of the world, Soderbergh has made a movie set in 1945 that looks as if it were made in 1945. Some of it was, even. The director has included footage of Berlin after the war shot by Billy Wilder and William Wyler, for verisimilitude and (why not?) good luck.
 
 It's a curious arc for "The Good German" to follow, though — from a brutal, quasi-documentary to a rainy tarmac through a Vaseline-coated lens — even if things do end on a bit of a down beat. The movie unfolds in a bombed-out city divvied up like a bank-robbery haul between the Americans, the Russians, the French and the British. Despite the best efforts of all involved, some of the biggest spoils are still on the loose. While military lawyers sift through scientific records to figure out who will stand trial for war crimes, the Russians are kidnapping nuclear physicists in the streets, before the Americans can get to them with offers of California tract houses and a side of cars.
 


         






   It's into this quagmire that a rather romantically inclined, morally confused reporter for the New Republic named Jake Geismer (George Clooney) steps into, having been issued a uniform, a driver and an official story by the Army. Jake has returned to Berlin for the first time since the war began to cover the Potsdam Conference. Before he left, he was running the Associated Press' Berlin bureau and having an affair with a married stringer named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett). Soon, Jake discovers that Lena is now the girlfriend of his driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire), a baby-faced corporal and thuggish racketeer whose gee-whiz demeanor plays like a long, sardonic joke about the representation of baby-faced corporals in 1940s war pictures. Jake has come back to Berlin to find Lena, but all Lena wants to do is get out of town. Soon there's a murder, which Jake sets out to investigate. He wants to know, but he doesn't want to know. You want to say, "Forget it, Jake. It's Kreuzberg."
 
 The last time Clooney played the mark, he was fat and bearded in "Syriana." Here all he needs is Maguire's Tully, whose easy malevolence pegs him instantly. Maguire is fabulous as the kind of kid who can rhapsodize about his mom's apple pie (pie you somehow doubt she even makes) and then offer you an hour with his "girlfriend" if you're interested. At first, the unexpected shock of language that would have never made it past Production Code censors and a sex scene that would have made their heads explode feels inexplicably elating. And its not just the naughty bits that make it seem so naughty. In a few quick strokes, Soderbergh and screenwriter Paul Attanasio (working from a novel by Joseph Kanon) sketch a convincing scenario in which it is technically not possible for the good guys to win a war because good guys don't fight them. Or they don't start them, anyway.
 
 Graham Greene (who, incidentally, wrote the postwar noir classic "The Third Man," which was set in Vienna in 1949) described the problem inherent in suggesting such things in the years leading up to, during and following the war. His first movie script, which he wrote in 1937 while he was a film critic for the Spectator, was an adaptation of a John Galsworthy story about a murderer who kills himself, and an innocent man who hangs for the crime. A fine sensationalist plot, but the British Board of Film Censors disagreed. "They forbade suicide, and forbade the failure of English justice." You get the feeling that this is just the sort of historical wrong Soderbergh and Attanasio have set out to right, and that it's not for nothing they're doing it now.
 
 Fortunately, the movie doesn't bog itself down in making comparisons, but it does get mired in its obsession with its own style. The further along it gets, the harder it is to believe that Jake and Lena ever had a past together, or that the memory of this past would continue to bind them. Jake and Lena are made up of so many contrasting layers they wouldn't be out of place on a pastry cart, but you can't really imagine them in love with each other. Maybe Jake's desire to help her stems from an oddly placed guilt, even as he suspects there's much about what Lena's done since he last saw her that he doesn't know. But ultimately he doesn't want to know. No one really does, even if choosing not to know tends to cancel out all the moral choices, from the little ones all the way up to the big ones.

The Good German  works better for those who think meta. On one level, Steven Soderbergh's latest, elegant movie-loving project is a period-piece drama set in Berlin at the end of World War II, where U.S. war correspondent Jake Geismer (George Clooney) gets embroiled all over again with an old German flame who still sets men on fire. Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) used to be a soft girl until the war made her hard (when Jake first sees her again, she has taken up with Tobey Maguire as a conscience-free black marketer). Jake used to be a passionate guy until the war made him bitter. Secrets are involved, and double-dealings, and a rich supporting cast, including Beau Bridges as a bushy American colonel, Ravil Isyanov as a slippery Russian general, and Deadwood 's Robin Weigert as Lena's lusty roommate, stealing every scene she's in, sometimes just by chewing a sandwich. The air is perfumed with the bouquet of grand old 1940s Warner Bros. noir pics colored in black and white and wartime shadows.
But it turns out those scents and shadows are what's best in The Good German , while the story itself (the script is by Paul Attanasio, from the 2001 novel by Joseph Kanon) fades to an unmemorable gray, bleached of relevance. On the meta level, Soderbergh has re-created not only the kind of story told in the 1940s, but the kind of technical production Hollywood gloried in more than half a century ago, too. And so the movie is best received as an erudite thesis on how function sometimes follows form and not the other way around  how, for instance, the sound-and-picture limitations of the time (lenses and microphones, lighting and master shots) forced performances to project out rather than allow them to turn inward in today's prevailing style.
The good student will filter Attanasio's intentionally ''modern''-sounding dialogue through the actors' ''old-fashioned'' declarations and may experience a thrill of time-and-again cinematic dislocation. The leisure-time viewer will say, ''Hey, this is sort of like Casablanca , so why play it again?''

 In his genre pastiche “The Good German,” Steven Soderbergh has tried to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. Based on the well-regarded Joseph Kanon novel, this film stars a distracted, emotionally detached George Clooney as Jake Geismer, an American journalist who, following World War II, returns to Germany to check out the doings at Potsdam and find his lost love, Lena, a frau who, as played by a vamping Cate Blanchett, recalls Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s postwar heroine Veronika Voss by way of Carol Burnett.  As it turns out, they don’t make them like they used to even when they try. Mr. Soderbergh has explained that with “The Good German” he was seeking to make a film that looked and sounded like an old studio picture, but without the old studio prohibitions. In the name of verisimilitude and creative freedom, his actors talk a blue streak in black-and-white images captured with period-era camera lenses. More lewdly, Tobey Maguire, who plays Tully, one of those smiling sadists of the type once played by Dan Duryea, helps the film earn its R rating by doing the kinds of things to Ms. Blanchett that audiences could only dream of doing to Ingrid Bergman.  Here’s looking at you kid, flung over the bed and on your knees.  With one startling and critical difference, Paul Attanasio’s screenplay follows the general direction of Mr. Kanon’s novel, which, embroidered with historical detail, zeroes in on the mid-1940s moment when the United States and the Soviet Union were racing to scoop up German scientists in preparation for the long, cold war to follow. The novel stacks up  the various acts of wartime violence — genocide, carpet bombing, postwar raping and pillaging committed by the respective German, American and Soviet players  — as if they were poker chips. In this game of high-stakes moral relativism, the Germans clearly have amassed the most chips (six million and counting), though the thuggish Soviets and slick, smiling Americans are doing their best to catch up.  Mr. Attanasio, whose credits include “Quiz Show,” attempts to work all this murk and mess into a compressed screenplay that also leaves room for the stars. When not chasing after Lena, Jake races around the impressively dilapidated sets trying to put all the geopolitical pieces together. When an American soldier winds up dead in Potsdam, Jake thinks he has the makings of an ideal you-are-there story. His zigzag pursuit of his long-cooled love quickly dovetails with a boiling-hot story involving Nazi war crimes, the details of which are helpfully provided by assorted secondary types, including Beau Bridges as the American military officer running part of Berlin, Leland Orser as an American Jew hunting down Nazis and Ravil Isyanov as a watchful Soviet officer.  Despite Mr. Soderbergh’s attempt to mimic the classic studio style, notably through the deliberate editing patterns and fairly restrained camerawork, “The Good German” bears little resemblance to a Hollywood film of the period. Tonally his cinematography is particularly off-key, characterized by hot whites and inky blacks that can put faces into harsh light and swallow bodies whole; neither Ms. Blanchett nor Mr. Clooney is flattered by his attentions. Although he tosses in an occasional beauty shot, framing Jake against a mottled nighttime sky in one scene, the film’s high-contrast austerity owes more to the anti-aesthetic of the modern art house than it does to the back-lot Expressionism of Hollywood noirs  or one of the filmmaker’s favorite touchstones, “The Third Man.”  In “Casablanca,” another of the golden oldies Mr. Soderbergh samples  for “The Good German,” Humphrey Bogart cozies up to Bergman in flashback on a Parisian bed. The lovers remain dressed throughout their abbreviated affair, though one suggestively uncorked bottle of Champagne and several coy dissolves  suggest realms of adult possibility. Yet while the language routinely waxes raw in “The Good German,” the most striking difference between it and a Hollywood film like “Casablanca” aren’t the expletives, the new film’s calculated cynicism or even that glimpse of bedroom coupling; it’s that the older film feels as if it was made for the satisfaction of the audience while the other feels as if it was made for that of the director alone.  In the film laboratory that is Mr. Soderbergh’s brain, ideas boil, steam and sputter. In 1989 he conquered Cannes and launched a thousand Harvey and Bob Weinstein stories with his independently financed sensation “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” quickly becoming a legend before his time. He subsequently flopped and floundered before he brought his independent ways to bear on the studio apparatus, a metamorphosis that involved turning a television actor into the sexiest man alive, repurposing the Rat Pack and winning  an Oscar.  It has been a second act that, until recently, seemed as smart as the man living it but that has grown gradually more disjointed as Mr. Soderbergh’s penchant for experimentation has become an end in itself rather than a means to aesthetic liberation. That’s too bad for us, for him and for Hollywood, which frankly could use all the help it can get.  In a recent interview Mr. Soderbergh said that he would have been happy with a career like that of Michael Curtiz, a workhorse who spent decades  churning out entertainments like “Casablanca” for Warner Brothers. The idea that the extremely self-motivated Mr. Soderbergh might be satisfied with a career like Curtiz’s is rich nonsense. Curtiz had next to no say on the personnel who worked on “Casablanca.” By contrast, for “The Good German” Mr. Soderbergh persuaded the same studio, now owned by a media conglomerate for which movies represent only a thin slice of the pie chart, to cough up millions for what is essentially a pet art project.  Increasingly, Mr. Soderbergh’s oscillation between glossy divertissements like the “Ocean’s” films and modest diversions like “Bubble” seems less like the natural workings of a restless imagination than a disengaged one. Even more than “Bubble” or “Ocean’s Twelve,” “The Good German” feels like the product of a filmmaker far more interested in his own handicraft — in the logistics of moving the camera among the characters with a dip and a glide — than in the audience for whom he’s ostensibly creating that work.  Manufactured for mass enjoyment, “Casablanca” runs wonderfully more than half a century after leaving the factory. It’s sentimental and contrived. It’s also the kind of well-wrought, pleasurable film that Mr. Soderbergh can do beautifully (see “Out of Sight”) and seems recently reluctant to pursue.  The extent of that disengagement is most evident in the new film’s wildly feel-bad denouement, in which the paradoxically good German of Mr. Kanon’s title, the one who looked away from atrocities, is transformed into a duplicitous Jew. The most charitable explanation for this offensive, historically spurious character is that Mr. Soderbergh and Mr. Attanasio, in trying to cram the novel’s nearly 500 pages into a 105-minute film, decided to conflate two different clichés into one.  Rather unfortunately, and perhaps with an eye to the present, they end up suggesting that in wartime everyone’s hands can become slicked with blood, even a Jew in Nazi Germany. Somewhere, Jack and Harry Warner, who stopped doing business with Nazi Germany before any other studio in Hollywood, are spinning. They aren’t the only ones.  “The Good German” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes some gun violence and fisticuffs, a little sex and a lot of raw language.
The Good German , directed by Steven Soderbergh  from Joseph Kanon 's bestseller, is as much simulation as movie. Specifically, it's the simulation of a 1940s private-eye flick. It's not just a period film but one that feigns being shot in that period.
Filmed for maximum chiaroscuro in hyper black-and-white, this is an old-school urban thriller played out amid the still-smoldering ruins of postwar Berlin  rather than the back alleys of downtown L.A. It's a promising ideausing the '40s to evoke the '40s, repaying Hollywood 's debt to German expressionism by bringing film noir back home. Soderbergh isn't the first to try this particular stuntLars von Trier  played a similar game in his underappreciated Zentropa , and The Good German  is haunted by The Third Man  the way Carol Reed 's 1949 classic was haunted by Orson Welles . But neither of those were Hollywood movies and neither one had the same concern with resurrecting something that may never have existed; such voluptuous disillusionment regarding U.S. motives wouldn't have had a place in a 1946 American movie.
The Good German  is essentially an exercise in sleight of hand. Even more than digital magic, Soderbergh's deliberately archaic cinematography (credited to his pseudonym, Peter Andrews ) allows for many satisfying segues between newsreel footage and back-lot rubble. The cluttered mise-en-scéne is often sensational and there are several effective set pieces, notably a triumphal Allied parade through the bombed-out city, which verges on sci-fi. Despite (or rather, because of) its self- consciously retro qualities, The Good German  is one of Soderbergh's more experimental moviesbut the pizzazz is mainly visual.
Paul Attanasio 's adaptation streamlines Kanon's 500-page opus, set in August 1945 against the backdrop of the Potsdam  conference where Churchill, Truman, and Stalin met as allies for the last time. The Good German  doesn't lack for atmosphere. Berlin is less a cold crater than a sinkhole of depravity, complete with a fat congressman looking to rehabilitate the Nazis en masse. George Clooney , a foreign correspondent who had been stationed in pre-war Berlin, returns to the scene of the crime to cover the conference (for The New Republic  , no less) and is immediately assigned the sleaziest driver in the U.S. Army  (Tobey Maguire ). This fresh-faced twerp picks not only Clooney's pocket but his brain as wellturns out that he's pimping Cate Blanchett , the married woman Clooney had loved when last in town and for whom he still carries a major torch.
Her face a taut mask of enigma and voice dropped an octave to husky Dietrich range, Blanchett is given every opportunity to slink meaningfully through the debris. Maguire is considerably less convincing as the callous fixerparticularly when used to establish the callow nature of the American occupiers. ("Just don't jew me on the price," he warns a legless black marketer.) Walking through the Humphrey Bogart  role, Clooney seems to be forever glancing back at his director. He's at once inanely overconfident and distractingly ineffectual as the forthright American.
Clooney's character can't even get into the confab he's supposedly covering; it's good news for the plot when he wanders over to the Russian zone in time to see the corpse of an American G.I. pulled out of the river. Like a proper shamus, Clooney takes one thumpin' after another. Trying to get to the bottom of the murder, as well as the missing-person mystery that swirls around Blanchett, he's punched out by Russians, Americans, Germans, and even Maguire.
Generals and MPs warn him off the case. So does Blanchett, hissing, "You should never have come back to Berlin." Nevertheless he perseveres, making a badge out of his bandaged ear as Jack Nicholson  nursed a wounded nose through Chinatown . This intentional corniness is far from unpleasant. However flavorsome though, The Good German  is seriously deficient in the stars' star power and narrative excitement. The movie is lovingly framed, carefully lit, and fatally insipid. The direction is slack; the pacing is perfunctory. While the mysteries of Blanchett's past proliferate, Clooney never has much trouble finding her (or her file).
In his most fatal re-creation, Soderbergh closes with an homage to Casablanca  . It's a dark and misty night. The getaway plane is on the runway. Blanchett is wearing an Ingrid Bergman  cloche hat and Clooney is desperately trying to think for the both of them. But if Casablanca was the acme of wartime romanticism, The Good German  is its self-conscious antithesis. Soderbergh wants to show the birth of postwar moral relativism. It's hard to believe in anythinghis characters most of all.
