The conflict between knowing, or at least suspecting, the awful truth behind our beloved hamburgers and where, exactly, they came from (not to mention what's squirming and roiling within them before they hit the grill) is at the sinewy heart of Linklater's film. Using Eric Schlosser's contemporary updating of Upton Sinclair's 1906 meat-packing expos�, The Jungle
, as its background, Linklater and the author have fleshed out a multilayered narrative that rips the protective veil of high-dollar marketing and high-stakes ad campaigns from the fast-food industry and all of its attendant social ills: the undeniably horrific plight of the undocumented Mexican workers who daily ebb and flow across the border to work in one of the four major meat-packing plants in this country, the sexual harassment, the rampant methamphetamine use among workers desperate to keep up with the impossible pace of the mechanized inspection lines, and the daily loss of life and limb to the ominously grinding machinery of the meat industry (both literal and figurative). It's a real horror show on the so-called "kill floor," but what's most shocking about this film is how little it shocks. Part of this is due to multiple, convergent storylines, which recall those in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic
 transposed from the shadowy world of the pan-American narcotics trade to the pan-American fast-food industries. Unfortunately, where Soderbergh's film crackled with momentous import (thanks in large part to Stephen Gaghan's brilliant scriptwork), Fast Food Nation
's characters come off as randomly generated ciphers whose only purpose here is to illustrate the assorted societal and industrial dysfunctions of the fast-food biz. The film opens intriguingly with a group of Mexican laborers making the hazardous, desert border-crossing (one of them is separated from the group and, we assume, perishes). Among them, Sylvia (Moreno, of Maria Full of Grace
), her husband Raul (Valderrama), and sister Coco (Talanc�n) end up in Cody, Colo., where they quickly find work at the mammoth beef-processing plant just outside of town. (The town itself is a major representative player in Linklater's film, and, with its generic consumer outlets and omnipresent McDonald's, it comes off as less strip-malled than strip-mauled.) It's not long before Coco is shacking up and getting high with the predatory line boss (Cannavale) and Raul runs afoul of the huge, clanking machinery. Meanwhile, Greg Kinnear's middle-management stooge is sent by his McDonald's-like chain to investigate reports of bovine feces in their star hamburger patties, and a group of student activists, including Mickey's McJob employee Amber (Johnson), passionately argue about how best to shut down the Machine. And then Hawke shows up. Why? And then Kinnear disappears from the storlyine. Why again? Fast Food Nation
 succeeds in broad strokes, pointedly drawing a parallel between the ceding of populist power and outrage to the faceless, profiteering, frighteningly un-American corporations that most certainly do not have your (much less your children's) best interests at heart. In this sense, it's a noble and worthy and important film. But as a character-driven narrative, it's a hollow beast, too often pedantic, that smacks of good-guy agitprop, shrill when it should be subtle and shrieking when a whisper would be far more unnerving. (See related inteview with Eric Schlosser on p.56 of this week's Screens section.)



Richard Linklater's "Fast Food Nation" is major. It's an angry movie that could shame a Big Mac lover into having a salad. Yet while it feels like a call to arms, the movie's glamourless style and the conditions it describes are so stark you go home spent. That's an outcome more American directors should risk.
Linklater has fashioned Eric Schlosser's exhaustive nonfiction bestseller about the bloody tentacles of the fast-food industry into a morality play about the vicious circle of consumption that puts the worker in the maw of the corporation.
Where Schlosser traveled the world, Linklater settles in Colorado and the American Southwest, his class-sensitive material reaching for the scornful heights of Sinclair Lewis.
The movie opens with a slow tracking shot inside a Mickey's, a fictional fast-food chain, which trails McDonald ' s and Burger King but is eager to top them. The camera pans down into a fat, oily patty, the way melodramas pull into a star's face before they flash back to tell her story.
Linklater, who wrote the movie with Schlosser, gives us the history of that hamburger and others like it. We're taken from the cattle ranches to the slaughterhouse where the meat is ground, pressed, frozen, and stacked like enormous pink poker chips, to the homes of the disaffected kids who flip those patties even after they've dropped them on the floor. (The sound of impact evokes an air hockey match).
We drop in on Mickey's marketing meetings, and also follow a Mickey's suit named Don Anderson (Greg Kinnear) as he sniffs new sandwich flavor samples fresh from the chemical lab. He then makes his way west to investigate a nasty rumor: the Mickey Burger may contain feces.
The movie's scope pulls back further. The jokey shot abruptly following the greasy opening is of a dog running on the streets of a Mexican border town, where a handful of men and women are about to cross into America. Most of them will wind up at Uniglobe, a vast, immaculate meat-packing plant full of gleaming chrome. The complex's workers are predominantly Mexican immigrants and the floor supervisor (Bobby Cannavale) threatens to make errant meat cutters pull kidneys.
The most virtuous of the immigrants, Sylvia (Catalina Sandino Moreno), quits almost immediately and takes a job cleaning hotel rooms. But her husband (Wilmer Valderrama ) and her wilder sister (Ana Claudia Talancón) stay on.
"Fast Food Nation" has the dramatic flatness and willful lack of personality of some documentaries -- or at least how Linklater thinks a documentary should be. The movie nonetheless feels like both a work of investigative journalism and an immense human-interest story, veering into muckraking, horror, teen comedy, and what passes for "Twilight Zone" science fiction.
Linklater's assets here are his keen intelligence and his long career as a chronicler of Americans living against the system. At last, the young slackers he made famous in "Slacker" and "Waking Life" try striking back against the empire. The results, of course, are dispiriting.
But fruitless revolutions are nothing new. When a couple of former anarchists (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) reminisce about their youthful exploits, you understand why a generation of young people never left their sofas.
The director is delicate enough never to bash you upside the head with his big ideas, the way other omnibus pictures like "Babel" and "Crash" do. While they purport to be about fate, destiny is mostly a matter of manipulative screenwriting.
"Fast Food Nation" is a movie about the socioeconomic limits on human action. Audaciously, the film insists we're not terribly different from the droves of cows in the picture. As Linklater and Schlosser devote a lot of time to the immigrants' personal struggles and to Arquette's burger-flipper daughter (Ashley Johnson) who inherits her mother's social conscience, the movie imparts a kind of damning hopelessness that swells to tragic proportions.
Eventually, we're taken where we feared to tread: Uniglobe's "kill floor," whose horrors Sylvia witnesses after an unfortunate turn of events. Moreno has the perfect face for conveying such a sight. Her seeming goodness exacerbates the cruelty of the severed heads in bins and innards speeding down slides. All the movie's heartbreak and rage well up in her eyes.
So does something else in this unforgettable moment: a moral defeat. Virtue is something the rich don't have and the poor here simply can't afford to keep.


         Anyone who has read Eric Schlosser's book "Fast Food Nation" can tell you that the big burger-related question of the day is not "where's the beef," 
but what, in the name of all that is good and pure, is in 
the beef. Apparently, not much that is good and pure. Beyond that, you don't want to know — and neither does the $330-billion fast food industry, which in response to Schlosser's Upton-Sinclair-of-the-Happy-Meal exposé, launched a major PR counteroffensive designed by the same people who brought us the Swift Boat campaign. (McDonald's has denied involvement.)
 
  According to an industry website that's probably just coincidentally called "Best Food Nation," there's no basis to critics' claims that fast food companies knowingly hire illegal workers, that cattle farming harms the environment, that fast food restaurant jobs lead nowhere, that dangerous meat-processing jobs are given to untrained workers and that beef patties and cow patties sometimes contain a surprise ingredient in common.
 


         






    These, of course, are the major plot points of Richard Linklater's fictionalized adaptation of the book, which not surprisingly refrains from naming names, especially litigious ones. Instead, "Fast Food Nation" invents a global burger mill with a friendly corporate identity and a little bit of a PR problem. An activist group has smuggled a frozen patty out of a secured location and had it tested in a lab. The beef contained high levels of fecal coliform — or, as Mickey's chief executive explains to his new marketing manager, Don Anderson (Greg Kinnear), who recently hit a home run with the launch of "The Big One," "There's ... in the meat."
 
  So, Don is dispatched to Cody, Colo., to see what he can find out about the Uniglobe Meat Packing plant. Weaving together three main narrative strands to create a sprawling, ambitious overview of a world colonized by corporations, Linklater introduces us to recent illegal immigrants Raul (a surprisingly sensitive Wilmer Valderrama) and his sister-in-law Coco (Ana Claudia Talancón), who have just gotten jobs at the plant; Raul's wife, Sylvia (Catalina Sandino Moreno), who has opted for lower-paying but less brutal work as a hotel maid; and Amber (Ashley Johnson), a bright high school student who works at one of the many Mickey's franchises in town.
 
  At first, Don is impressed with the "official" (read: embedded) sanitized tour of the plant, until he hears one too many offhand remarks about unsafe working conditions and poor hygiene, convincing him to dig deeper. Tony (Esai Morales), the owner of the Mickey's franchise where Amber works, refers him to an old cattle rancher named Rudy Martin (Kris Kristofferson). Part two of Don's education comes with a tour of Rudy's ranch, where he sees burned-out illegal meth labs and cracker boxes built by real estate speculators encroaching on the land. Part three comes courtesy of Harry Rydell (Bruce Willis), an inspector who acts as a liaison between Mickey's and Uniglobe, who dismisses Rudy's point of view as the perspective of "fraidy-cats."
 
  For Linklater, the term "Fast Food Nation" applies to more than just burger and taco chains. It represents a gradual, complicit shift from reality to permanent reality displacement. In "Fast Food Nation," small-town/rural landscapes are transformed into chain-store dystopias. Workers are made to wear uniforms and name tags and robotically parrot corporate scripts when talking to customers. Drugs help people get through the mechanical actions.
 
  Ironically, all of this artificiality is rooted in a reality that's almost too much to bear. It doesn't get more visceral than the meat plant — especially at the gut table, where the problem Don's been sent to investigate is spilling out faster than the unskilled workers can contain it. The movie itself seems to move at the slow, rather bovine pace that Linklater favors. At times it's as though the movie was headed to slaughter, to the hidden part of the plant where cows are guillotined and blood forms rapids.
 
  If Linklater regards the fake culture that has replaced real places with horror, he has nothing but respect and affection for his characters, and the movie is rescued from nihilism by his humanistic view. Linklater defines his characters by their relationships, hopes, choices and weaknesses — not, as so many directors do, by their particular socioeconomic circumstances.
 
  From the illegal workers to the executives whose success requires serious moral compartmentalization, to every fry cook, cashier, hotel concierge, chain-restaurant waitress and client in the film, every character exists within an increasingly homogenous, inorganic system, and each individual must find a way to live within it on his or her own.
 
  Don may be the most morally compromised of all the major characters, and though he soon drops out of the story, Kinnear makes him one of the most complex and interesting. No other actor I can think of is better equipped to channel the ignominious pain of the midlevel, white-collar hustler than Kinnear — a genius at reconstructing his company-man expression after each time his face crumples in fear and loathing. The guy is Willy Loman in Dockers.
 
  Linklater makes these points skillfully, and with a light touch, without resorting to bombast, melodrama or false polemic. The situation he describes is nobody's plight, but it is everyone's seemingly unsolvable problem.
 
  As Rudy tells Don, "This isn't about good people versus bad people. This is about the machine that's taken over the country." Rudy's observation makes an impression, but when Harry advises Don to look the other way, saying "It's a sad fact of life, Don, but the truth is we all have to eat a little ... every now and then," you know he has long ago taken that message to heart.
 

 
  MPAA rating: R for disturbing images, strong sexuality, language and drug content. Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes. In general release.   

''We all have to eat a little s--- from time to time.'' That's Bruce Willis philosophizing, as a Colorado cattle supplier unperturbed by reports of poop in the patties in Fast Food Nation . The cattleman's viewpoint, expressed to a marketing exec (Greg Kinnear) of an extremely McDonald's-like fictional burger behemoth, is one of capitalist pragmatism. But it's also served with a tasty ground-up heaping of outrage and irony, then chewed over by Kinnear (the new official mascot of put-upon American family men). And that's the Fast Food Nation  appeal, first of Eric Schlosser's 2001 exposé that turned millions off their Big Mac feeds (at least for a week) and now of this freewheeling dramatized adaptation by filmmaker Richard Linklater, which asks and answers the question, Dude, do we really have to eat s--- to have it our way? S---, no.
Even the most ardent advocate of supersizing is likely to know already that the behind-the-counter world of Quarter Pounders and Whoppers isn't pretty. But the movie's muckraking power  loosely wielded, in slackerish tones pitched for reception by the text-message generation  lies in piecing together how that poop gets into those patties, with a logic that can't easily be shrugged off. For a change, the interwoven ensemble approach to storytelling works even though handled by someone other than Robert Altman. (It helps that Linklater, who extends Babel icious plot twining to the illegal Mexican immigrants working the slaughterhouse jobs no one else will take, doesn't strain farther around the world to tie in, say, a deaf Japanese teenager.)
Naturally, a subject this right-on draws a right-on cast. Kris Kristofferson, Avril Lavigne, and Ethan Hawke pitch in. And in the ripe Mexican subplot  featuring Bobby Cannavale, Luis Guzmán, and Wilmer Valderrama  Catalina Sandino Moreno (pictured, with Valderrama) makes her post–Maria Full of Grace  debut. She looks lovely even when stained with cow blood, while the horrors of the killing-floor conditions in which she works argue for a salad after the show.

 If you go to see “Fast Food Nation” with a group of friends, there is a good chance that someone — the smart-alecky contrarian; there’s one in every crowd — will bring up the subject of spinach.  Early in the film a fast-food executive named Don Anderson (Greg Kinnear) is dispatched to Colorado to investigate reports of E. coli bacteria — “fecal coloform counts off the charts!” — in his company’s beef supply. Since the movie, adapted by Richard Linklater and Eric Schlosser from Mr. Schlosser’s best-selling investigation of the industrial food chain and directed by Mr. Linklater, dwells on conditions in the feed lots and slaughterhouses where future hamburgers live and die, it can plausibly, if a bit glibly, be interpreted as a brief for vegetarianism.  Hence the impulse to point out that contaminated leafy greens have recently sickened more people than dirty meat. So there. A similar response was evident last spring in Cannes, where several American journalists bragged (or at least joked) about heading for the local McDonald’s after the “Fast Food Nation” screening, as if to prove they had resisted its lessons.  “Most people don’t like to be told what’s best for them,” says Bruce Willis in a sly, brilliant, single-scene cameo, and the suspicion that the movie is doing just that may provoke some reflexive resistance.  Which is too bad, because “Fast Food Nation,” while it does not shy away from making arguments and advancing a clear point of view, is far too rich and complicated to be understood as a simple, high-minded polemic. It is didactic, yes, but it’s also dialectical. While the climactic images of slaughter and butchery — filmed in an actual abattoir — may seem intended to spoil your appetite, Mr. Linklater and Mr. Schlosser have really undertaken a much deeper and more comprehensive critique of contemporary American life.    If it’s true that we are what we eat, then how, this film asks, do we even know who we are? The writer William S. Burroughs once contemplated “a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork,” and “Fast Food Nation” aims to produce a similar moment — to shock, to demystify and to force a kind of horrified, questioning clarity.  In what has become the preferred cinematic method for addressing complex social issues — see also “Crash,” “Traffic” and “Babel,” among others — Mr. Linklater’s film tells multiple stories, which radiate like spokes from the hub of a central theme. Don Anderson pokes around in fictional Cody, Colo., trying to balance his search for the truth with an apparent desire not to do anything that might hurt his career.  Meanwhile, a group of Mexican immigrants, having crossed the border illegally, arrives in Cody (Don unknowingly drives by the van transporting them) and takes up dangerous, stomach-turning jobs at the meat-processing plant. And a teenage burger-slinger (who works at one of Don’s franchises after school) undergoes a crisis of conscience when she falls in with a group of anticorporate activists from a nearby college.  Mr. Linklater is a nimble and versatile director, but what he does best — what he seems to like most — is to film people in conversation. His most characteristic movies — “Slacker,” “Before Sunset,” “Waking Life” — consist largely of unfettered, idiosyncratic talk, and “Fast Food Nation” is thick with debate, argument, rumination and repartee. Curiously enough, the talkiness is what saves the movie from turning into a lecture. Its loose, digressive rhythm keeps it tethered to reality, while the dialogue and the easy pace of the scenes allow the characters to register as individuals, not just as types.  It helps that the performances are generally strong. Mr. Kinnear is, yet again, the All-American dad and solid citizen, at once a paragon and a parody, thoroughly decent and just a bit sleazy. Ashley Johnson is completely convincing as Amber, the striving high school student whose idealism is the flip side of her ambition. The only thing Amber wants more than to change the world is to get out of Cody, and one of the film’s quiet insights is that these two desires — to fight the system and to win by its rules — are not necessarily incompatible, though they may seem contradictory.  In other words, when Amber and her newfound comrades sit around the dorm debating strategy and raging against the machine, they are attacking one version of the American dream while embodying another. A more basic instance of that dream motivates Raul (Wilmer Valderrama) and Sylvia (Catalina Sandino Moreno), a young married couple who have crossed the American-Mexican border on foot. While both actors are natural magnets for the sympathy of the audience, Mr. Linklater and Mr. Schlosser resist the impulse to turn them into caricatures of the noble, suffering poor. They are too interesting to be pitiable, just as Bobby Cannavale, as the predatory supervisor at the meat-packing plant, is more than just the sum of his ruthless, despicable actions.  The cast is large — there’s Ethan Hawke! And Kris Kristofferson! — but the crowdedness of “Fast Food Nation” is evidence of its liveliness. (Paul Dano, as one of Amber’s coworkers, and Ana Claudia Talancón, as Sylvia’s wayward sister, deserve special mention.) Everyone in it has something to say, and the central characters face some hard ethical choices set down by the logic of 21st-century consumer capitalism.  The movie does not neglect the mute, helpless suffering of the cows, but it also acknowledges the status anxiety of the managerial class, the aspirations of the working poor (legal and otherwise) and the frustrations of the dreaming young. It’s a mirror and a portrait, and a movie as necessary and nourishing as your next meal.  “Fast Food Nation” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of sex, violence, drug use and animal slaughter.
The vigorous muckraking sensibility that informed Eric Schlosser's 2001 nonfiction bestseller keeps this fictionalized screen version of "Fast Food Nation" bobbing along despite its overly slackerish narrative organization. Richard Linklater's rough-hewn tapestry of assorted lives that feed off of and into the American meat industry is both rangy and mangy; it remains appealing for its subversive motives and revelations even as one wishes its knife would have been sharper. Pre-sold title and contrarian perspective will play into the sympathies of hip, younger audiences, although a more pugnacious comic approach and emotionally bolstered drama might have helped Fox Searchlight push the picture to a more mainstream arena in planned fall release.
Making a shaped, involving film from Schlosser's intensively researched, highly popular expose of the junk food juggernaut in the United States repped a considerable challenge, and the author and Linklater have made eminently reasonable decisions about where to train their focus.
First half is led by Don Henderson (Greg Kinnear), an amiably inquisitive marketing veep for Mickeys, a burger giant that's riding the popularity wave of its top-of-the-line "The Big One." He is sent into the field by his boss to quietly investigate scientific findings that cow manure has turned up in the company's product.
Don's search for evidence takes him to Cody, Colo., home of the firm's enormous feedlots and meat packing plant. Town also reps the destination of truckloads of illegal Mexican immigrants, who are hired for the most disagreeable jobs at the superficially pristine slaughterhouse. A group of new arrivals under the eye of coyote Benny (Luis Guzman) prominently includes attractive, pliant Sylvia (Catalina Sandino Moreno), her wilder sister Coco (Ana Claudia Talancon) and Sylvia's b.f. Raul (Wilmer Valderrama).
Fast food culture is such an obvious target that Linklater might have decided just not to bother taking too many potshots for cheap laughs; perhaps the sight of Cody's main drag, dominated like so many other towns by personality-erasing chain restaurants and stores, is so numbingly demoralizing that it's now beyond humor.
But pic's multi-faceted structure so strongly brings to mind Robert Altman's ensemble community portraits that it's impossible not to imagine, and wish for, a more caustic, stinging social critique than the present film is able to muster.
Linklater's sensibility is far gentler, however, and his generosity extends not only to Don, who becomes progressively upset by what he learns, and the few-alternative illegals, but to such other characters as Amber (Ashley Johnson), a high schooler too bright to remain stuck as a cashier at Mickeys; Pete (Ethan Hawke), Ashley's rambunctious uncle who tries to encourage her to raise her sights, and Rudy (Kris Kristofferson), a longtime local rancher ideally positioned to illustrate to Don how things have changed for the (much) worse.
Offering a different perspective is cattle supplier Harry (Bruce Willis), who urges Don to take a pragmatic view of Mickeys' food contamination, pointing out that, "We all have to eat a little shit from time to time."
Inevitably, the nutritional problem and the drama lead literally to the bowels of the meat packing plant, where Sylvia ends up working. Scenes of the killing floor and the guts room will heavily reduce post-screening burger consumption, if not win a flood of converts to vegetarianism.
More to Linklater and Schlosser's point is the issue of big corporations' ability to easily take advantage of illegal workers through intimidation and denial of medical care.
All of these developments easily hold the attention, as do others involving a sisterly feud between Sylvia and Coco, the sexually predatory antics of plant supervisor Mike (Bobby Cannavale) and the inept efforts of local students to "liberate" cattle in a midnight raid on a feedlot; cows, they conclude, are dumber than they thought.
But Don disappointingly disappears at the half-way point, the characters played by Kristofferson and Willis, among others, pop up once and never return, and a developing subplot involving a couple of rebellious Mickeys workers plotting a robbery simply aborts. All this, along with relaxed pacing and a laid-back visual style, creates the sense of a laissez faire approach to storytelling, one that's not off-putting but nevertheless does not fully serve the attack mode suggested by Schlosser's systematic original approach.
In the end, viewers waiting for an emotional and/or dramatic payoff will be disappointed. As a call-to-arms, it's highly sympathetic but surprisingly mild-mannered.

Fast Food Nation , directed by Richard Linklater  from Eric Schlosser 's 2001 bestselling exposé of the McDonald's  conspiracy, is an anti-commercial. It's designed to kill desire and deprogram the viewer's appetite.
Linklaterwho, along with Steven Soderbergh  and Gus Van Sant , has staked out a particular outpost on the indie-studio borderhere takes a cleaver to the great American hamburger. One might wish that his movie had honed its satiric edge. Still, as blunt as Fast Food Nation  is, it's also a surprising piece of social criticism to emerge (like Borat ) from the status quo folks at Fox.
Timed for the centennial of Upton Sinclair 's classic muckraker The Jungle , as well as Thanksgiving, Fast Food Nation  opens with a slow zoom into the fresh-charred heart of a greasy, gristle-flecked beef patty. The thing looks disgusting long before it's established that any individual burger is the ground residue of many, many messily butchered animals (plus their hormones and the contents of their intestines), given a dollop of extra fat, injected with chemical perfume, and possibly dipped in floor dirt or garnished with an employee's loogie.
So much for the micro: Linklater is actually after bigger game. He uses the scarcely fictionalized Mickey's franchise ("Home of the Big One") as a metaphor for American life. A cheerful Mickey's marketer (Greg Kinnear ) learns that for all the engineered slogans, scientific packaging, and artificial aromas, lab tests show that "there's shit in the meat." His investigatory mission to the megapacking plant in Colorado intersects with the stories of the Mexican illegal immigrants who work there, as well as that of a Mickey's register girl (former child actress Ashley Johnson ) turned eco-activist.
A more materialist (and successful) ensemble film than the mystical Babel , in that everyone is connected through the same economic system, Fast Food Nation  is exotic for being a movie about work. Its characters struggle with some of the world's dirtiest jobsmorally as well as physically. In this, Linklater is following in the Sinclair tradition: The Jungle , which also focused on immigrant workers, was intended not so much as an attack on the meatpacking industry as a socialist jeremiad against capitalism itself.
Linklater's panorama is overflowing with good intentions and it's graphic enough to put you off beef, even before reaching the plant "killing floor." The movie is valiant, if curiously anemic. Its most galvanizing scene effectively undermines the argument: Bruce Willis  has a lip-smacking cameo as the voice of cynical realisma Mickey's operative who mocks American 'fraidy cats and shocks Kinnear with the smirking assertion that "we all have to eat a little shit from time to time."
The next morning Kinnear leaves his hotel, disillusioned with the plastic people of the service industryand pointedly vanishes from the movie. (This may be as much strategic as thematic; Kinnear's awakening is difficult to take seriously mainly because sincerity is beyond his register.) The other featured stars are predictably liberal. Kris Kristofferson  has a scene as a righteous cattle rancher threatened by unscrupulous developers. The movie stops dead so that he can give Kinnear a little history of the meat industry's price-fixing and political influence. He laughs at the idea of a clean burger and offers what amounts to the movie's political worldview: "The machine has taken over this country . . . like something out of science fiction." Later, Ethan Hawke  ambles on set as a happy hippie, a cabinet maker who argues unconvincingly for the nonconformist life.
There's a hopeless sense that McDonald's R Us: After two months in the States, one Mexican couple saves enough money to treat themselves to a food-franchise dinner. It's one of the wonders of America: "Next week, we'll try pizza." (Later, the coyote who managed their border crossing will welcome two kids to America with a bag of Mickey Bits.) Linklater provides his own auto-critique when a frustrated cadre of student environmentalists attempts to liberate a pastureor "prison camp"filled with contented cows. The animals won't budge. "We should have brought a cattle prod," one kid concludes.
Something worse than a prison camp for cows, the slaughterhouse is rife with exploitation and danger. This is where Linklater finds his melodrama, following the fate of three Mexican illegalsfresh meat for the machine. The most painfully naive is played by Catalina Sandino Moreno , the open-faced Colombian actress Oscar-nominated for her role in Maria Full of Grace ; her character here deserves the same sobriquet. The despoliation of Moreno's grave, clear-eyed child of nature is the movie's emotional crux. Her season in hell is the real thing sentenced to the killing floor, pulling kidneys amid torrents of blood, her comradely gaze clouded with ammonia tears.
That this horrific sequence was actually (and perhaps necessarily) shot in a Mexican meat plant doesn't exactly contradict Linklater's polemic that we are what we eat, but it does complicate his beef.

Alienation is more difficult to dramatize than horror. Our Daily Bread , a documentary by Nikolaus Geyrhalter , provides a different perspective on the mass production of food. Geyrhalter's viewpoint is programmatically detached. Opening with an endless row of trussed pig carcasses, neatly hanging by their hind legs, Our Daily Bread  (showing next week at Anthology Film Archives) is a cool, nearly wordless succession of scenes from the European food industry.
