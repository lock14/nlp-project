Historically, Nancy Drew may be the best teen detective around, but in this new screen incarnation she is definitely no spy kid. When compared with Robert Rodriguez�s child detectives, it�s not really a matter of Nancy�s retro look and grounding in the fundamentals of sleuthing that separates the women from the girls (as the saying goes) but, rather, this film�s lack of gaiety and surprise that makes it a dud for old and new generations of the books� fans. In an attempt to make Nancy Drew
 more appealing to current tweens, the filmmakers have taken the girl out of pedestrian River Heights (located in one of those flyover states, we�re told) and moved her to Los Angeles, where she attends Hollywood High amid a setting ripe for a remake of Clueless
. Given her throwback fashion sense of Fifties-style plaids, pleats, knee socks, and penny loafers (designed by costuming pro Jeffrey Kurland), Nancy appears to her chic classmates as ripe for a makeover. Thank goodness for strong-willed girls: Not only will Nancy Drew solve mysteries that stymie professional crime-solvers, she remains self-confident about her unique fashion identity and exceptional intelligence. Yet this 21st century Nancy Drew
 seems more about the clothes and other tween concerns than the mysteries and danger that fueled her between-the-covers escapades. Her pals, "tomboy" George and �pleasantly plump� Bess, are reduced to cameos in the film�s opening River Heights sequences. Nickelodeon star Roberts sinks into the role with her natural acting gifts, yet this film affords her little opportunity to stretch beyond the story�s basic narrative contrivance. Nancy, the perennial teen, still tools around in her roadster convertible, but Roberts looks barely old enough to possess a learner�s permit, no less navigate L.A.�s notorious freeways. As Nancy traverses the city solving a Hollywood mystery that has defied professional sleuthers for decades, her target audience is other contemporary teens and not the older women in the audience who, during their own youth, devoured the character's adventures with each passing book. Although hardly clueless, this Nancy Drew seems like she'd be more at home in a movie titled thusly.


The appearance of a Nancy Drew movie in 2007, a full 73 years after "The Mystery of the Old Clock " was published, begs a question: How ya gonna keep your kids in River Heights when they've already seen Hogwarts -- and Middle Earth and Narnia and all the other shiny make-believe palaces of modern moviegoing?
Credit "Nancy Drew " with trying, at least. The new film dives bravely into the abyss between hip and retro, earnest and (air-quotes) ironic, and promptly loses its way. The movie's fodder for tweener girls with indiscriminate Nick TV addictions, but there's just enough wit on display to make you realize it could have been worse.
The problem is that the beloved teen sleuth, familiar from umpteen mystery novels written by "Carolyn Keene" (a pseudonym for at least 10 underpaid writers employed over the years by publisher Edward Stratemeyer ), is not now nor ever has been cool. She's a holdover from the days when pep and stick-to-itiveness were positive qualities in a girl, rather than attitude, wardrobe, and the best cellphone dad's money can buy.
The people behind "Nancy Drew," director Andrew Fleming and his co-writer Tiffany Paulsen , are aware that time and culture have passed their heroine by. They try to make the most of it, shipping Nancy (Emma Roberts , daughter of Eric, niece of Julia, and star of Nickelodeon's "Unfabulous ") from squeaky-clean River Heights to bad old Los Angeles in the early scenes. There her sensible pullovers and businesslike demeanor render Nancy a freak to the mean girls and everyone else in school. She has an entire cafeteria table to herself; whatever she's got, the other kids are afraid it's catching.
The joke is that Nancy barely notices, so self-assured is she and so caught up in solving the mystery of the mansion she and her father (Tate Donovan ) are renting. This involves the ghost of a legendary movie star (Laura Elena Harring ) and it delivers the prerequisite secret passageways, scary caretakers, purloined wills, and villains who explain far too much while holding the heroine at gunpoint.
It's strictly B-movie stuff, no different from the old Bonita Granville "Nancy Drew" movies of the late ' 30s or the Pamela Sue Martin TV series of the ' 70s in sophistication and production quality. Purists will be glad to know the family cook, Hannah (Monica Parker ), travels with the Drews to LA, followed by Ned Nickerson (Max Theriot ) in Nancy's blue roadster, a zippy runabout from some alternate universe where the 1930s never ended.
Roberts is pleasant enough but, like her fellow TV-bred teen stars, there's not a lot of there
 yet, let alone enough to suggest a corn-fed Sherlock Holmes. Still, the movie has fun with the culture clash between this living American Girl doll and her sold-out, sexualized peers. "OMG, I'm sitting next to Martha Stewart ," one girl text-messages, while another sniffs, "Penny loafers -- did your podiatrist recommend them or are you being ironic?"
"Nancy Drew" has the nerve to suggest that sincerity just might be the next youth craze (as if
), even while poking gentle fun at its heroine's more obsessive qualities. Maybe she does carry rappelling line in her purse, but so what? It's not every teenager who can perform a tracheotomy on a moment's notice. "Anyone can learn emergency medical procedures," Nancy chirps. Are you taking notes, girls?


         Among the many things that the new movie "Nancy Drew" gets right is its timing. Just as it was starting to look as if round-the-clock coverage of rich, debauched teen train-wrecks was the only show in town, along comes a heroine — old enough to drive but too young to get decent rates on car insurance — who isn't a sociopath, a moron or a "laid-back" invertebrate whose most salient character trait is looking hot while being supportive.
 
 Nancy Drew, played by Emma Roberts (Eric's daughter and Julia's niece), does stuff. Not only does she do stuff, she does it ingeniously and sincerely. She outsmarts local law enforcement with nary an eye roll or a sarcastic remark. She escapes from kidnappers with a crucial item using string and a clothespin. She refuses to exceed the speed limit during a car chase. Caught up in a big case, she benignly neglects her boyfriend, Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot), who shares her total disregard for the hollow teenage posturing. Though she's initially hurt by the rejection of her peers at her new school, she remains as she is and finds the one weird friend who likes her for her. I think it's the most radical thing I've seen so far this summer.
 


         






   Directed by Andrew Fleming from a script by Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen, the latest screen incarnation of "Nancy Drew" (she's appeared on television and video over the years; the last time she was on the big screen was the late 1930s) seems to be based on a couple of assumptions. First, that, thanks to the books, the mothers in the audience may already be familiar with the amateur sleuth from the small town of River Heights, with her blue roadster and her freshly baked goods provided by her uniformed German housekeeper, Hannah. Second, that their daughters will have no idea who this girl is and will require some fashion and celebrity-themed material in order not to feel as if they've walked into the theater and onto another planet.
 
 To this end, the filmmakers relocate Nancy and her do-good lawyer dad, Carson (Tate Donovan), from River Heights to Los Angeles, where he's taken a new job. In exchange for a promise to quit her dangerous detective activities and act like a "normal" teenager, Carson allows Nancy (who is motherless) to pick the house they'll live in. Unable to resist a mystery, Nancy chooses the decaying and possibly haunted mansion of a legendary movie star named Dehlia Draycott (Laura Elena Harring), whose mysterious and probably murderous death by drowning has never been solved. The house, leased to the Drews by the flamboyant real estate agent Barbara Barbara (Caroline Aaron), comes complete with trap doors, secret passageways and a strange caretaker named Leshing (Marshall Bell), who always turns up unexpectedly and always seems to be lighted from below.
 
 While Nancy, her father and their hometown seem to be suspended somewhere in the 1940s or '50s, Dehlia Draycott, her house and the mysterious Leshing seem to belong to the two decades preceding those. We're told that Dehlia was a star in the '70s and '80s, but her most contemporary get-up is a flapper dress, and Nancy checks out her movies on a World War II-era projector. The movie's chronological confusion feels at once like a tongue-in-cheek postmodern pose and a nod to the difficulty of making a movie about a character like Nancy in this day and age, but it's telling that "Nancy Drew" can't quite decide on an era. That the sight of a cute teenage girl reading technical tomes such as "Advanced Sandcastle Making" can make your heart leap says something about the moment we're enduring, and it's not very nice.
 
 This is not to suggest that Nancy is not a fashion plate in her own right. Emma Roberts is about as pretty and put together as it's possible to be, and her costumes are whimsical, Sherlock Holmes-inspired couture. (Burberry must be pleased). To those of us who grew up in the '70s, when teen movie heroines looked like Kristy McNichol in jeans and glittery  T-shirts, it's still a little sad to see how utterly all but the most doll-like representations of femininity have been banished from the media. Still, given the contemporary reality, "Nancy Drew" feels like a refreshing turn in a positive direction, and I, for one, kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.
 
 Not that Nancy's look isn't fetishized, branded and marketed before the end credits even begin to roll. And it was dispiriting to read in a profile in this paper of Roberts suggesting that she's already caught up in the idea of herself as a brand-in-the-making. Hopefully, though, the girls who see "Nancy Drew" this summer will take their cues from the smart, engaged, intellectually curious character Roberts so charmingly portrays.
 
 Despite a couple of minor letdowns along the way, however — Nancy flipping through an issue of In Style on her train ride from River Heights to Los Angeles, for instance — the movie sticks to its guns. When Inga and Trish (Daniella Monet and Kelly Vitz), Nancy's foes-turned-groupies, decide it's time to furnish her with a makeover, you brace myself for the inevitable "Pretty Woman" hooker-with-a-credit-card moment. When the scene takes another turn, you're shocked by the rush of exhilaration and gratitude.
 
 
 "Nancy Drew." MPAA rating: PG for mild violence, thematic elements and brief language. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In wide release.   

Inspired by the amateur detective of classic girlhood literature reimagined for an ''OMG! BFF!'' Nickelodeon crowd in Nancy Drew , I've been doing some sleuthing of my own. Why does a movie so dolled up with oodles of stylistic doodles fall so flat? Traditionally a poised square peg in a round hole, nonconformist Nancy in the movie, played by Emma Roberts (a Nick star herself on Unfabulous ), retains her endearing time-warp wardrobe, even though she and her father (Tate Donovan) have moved to L.A., where her classmates are twittering fashion slaves and her house is haunted by the ghost of a dead movie star. Nancy's true-blue admirer from countless books, Ned (Max Thieriot), continues to do his beta-male duty, but now he's joined by a squat, wisecracking Hollywood kid (Josh Flitter, an acquired taste), whose every gesture hustles a laugh. There's a through-line, if you squint, between the era-jumbling sensibilities of Nancy Drew  and 1999's Dick , both appreciative of teen girls as cultural commentators and both directed by Andrew Fleming. And Dick  rules.
But this movie does not. And the culprit, I'd say, is the uninteresting casting of Miss Roberts in the title role. She's a pleasant enough performer, but her made-for-teen-TV acting style, a perky blandness, doesn't supply a clue as to the appeal of Nancy Drew after all these years.

 In “Nancy Drew,” the titular girl sleuth, a literary role model and crush object for generations of young readers, is decked out with air quotes and the full complement of knowing pop-culture accessories. At one point in the film a Southern California real estate agent appraises Nancy’s penny-loafer-and-knee-socks look and says, “With a little tweaking, you could be adorable.” Later a semi-reformed Mean Girl from Nancy’s school notes that Nancy’s retro appearance has become a fashion sensation called “the new sincerity.”  As far as I’m concerned, the old sincerity worked just fine, and too much tweaking has been done with the intention of bringing the girl sleuth up to date. The disappointment of “Nancy Drew,” which was directed by Andrew Fleming and written by Mr. Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen, is that it trusts neither its heroine nor its audience enough to approach its material with the confidence and conviction that Carolyn Keene, the pseudonymous author of the Nancy Drew books, brought to the franchise.  The movie turns Nancy, played with more pluck than brilliance by Emma Roberts, into an uptight goody-two-shoes, a prig who lectures her school principal on matters of policy and who won’t exceed the speed limit in the middle of a car chase. Worse, “Nancy Drew” corrupts the clean, functional, grown-up style of the books with the kind of cute, pseudo-smart self-consciousness that has sadly become the default setting for contemporary juvenile popular culture produced by insecure, immature adults.  Nancy and her father (Tate Donovan) move from River Heights, a hackneyed Hollywood image of an American small town, to an equally hackneyed Hollywood image of, um, Hollywood. There, the girls are vapid mini-fashionistas who wrinkle their noses at Nancy’s heartland earnestness and conspire to steal her cupcakes at lunch. Some people have tattoos. Back home there was a German housekeeper in a starched uniform, a population that dresses from the 1958 L. L. Bean catalog and a clean-cut boy named Ned (Max Thieriot), who hung around waiting for Nancy to notice that he’s madly in love with her.  In time Ned shows up in Los Angeles, where he must compete for Nancy’s attention with Corky (Josh Flitter), kid brother to one of the Mean Girls and perhaps the most annoying annoying-sidekick character in a movie since Robin Williams’s last cartoon voice-over.  Corky’s wisecracking distracts from what should be the movie’s main concern, namely the solving of a mystery. The great appeal of the Nancy Drew books (the first was published in 1930), as of any mystery-novel series, lies not in the static, predictable characters but in the intricate, well-carpentered plots. What keeps the readers’ eyes on the page is the chance to look over the detective’s shoulder as she puzzles over clues, and to feel the tingle of apprehension when her sleuthing begins to get her in trouble.  The greatest failure of “Nancy Drew” is that it denies viewers these pleasures, sacrificing the sturdy mechanics of a decent thriller in order to pursue tired jokes and second-hand atmospherics. At first the set-up seems promising. Nancy and her dad move into a crumbling bungalow once owned by a movie star whose death 25 years earlier has never been explained. Her fate gives the movie some intriguing intimations of Hollywood kiddie-noir. But this is not a child’s-portion “Chinatown,” or even a PG “Black Dahlia.” Instead the mystery has all the suspense and intrigue of a less-than-groovy episode of “Scooby-Doo.”  I wish it were otherwise. And maybe, if this movie spawns sequels, it will be. Ms. Roberts is certainly energetic and likable, and the character might regain her wide and durable appeal in spite of the obnoxious way she is written here. But as it is, “Nancy Drew” stands as an example of how to take a foolproof, time-tested formula  —  a young detective using smarts and determination to solve a case  —  and mess it up with superficial cleverness and pandering hackwork. How this happened is hardly a mystery; botched adaptations are as common as BlackBerries in Hollywood. But it is nonetheless something of a crime.    “Nancy Drew” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild violence and semi-scary situations. 

A beloved literary sleuth makes a go at bigscreen crime-solving in "Nancy Drew." Purportedly an attempt to modernize the young detective's adventures for a new generation of tweens, the pic instead serves up stale mystery-movie cliches and overcooked red herrings in a thoroughly wooden adaptation. Despite the presence of Nick TV star Emma Roberts, "Nancy Drew" won't ride enough text-messaging buzz to do big business theatrically. DVD prospects look brighter.
Of course, most young readers today are more interested in the mystical happenings at Hogwarts than the adventures of the old-fashioned Nancy Drew. But for generations of fans, Carolyn Keene's (a.k.a. Harriet Stratemeyer Adams) Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries were enduring touchstones of childhood literature. Previous incarnations include four William Clemens-helmed Nancy Drew pics in the late '30s as well as a TV series, "The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries" (ABC, 1977-79); DVD editions of both the films and the series are due this month.
In this case, scribes Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen have aimed to freshen the formula by changing the setting from small-town River Heights to Los Angeles. In a brisk hometown-set opening sequence, Nancy (Roberts) easily dispatches a couple of thugs, demonstrating her polite manners, mental acuity and acrobatic escape skills. Then she's off to California with her lawyer dad Carson (Tate Donovan), who has made her promise to give sleuthing a rest.
But Nancy can't resist a case, and the house they've rented holds an unsolved mystery of its own: It's the notorious Draycott mansion, where celebrated film star Dehlia Draycott (Laura Elena Harring, seen in flashback) was found murdered decades earlier. With its hidden passageways, attic full of Dehlia's archives and cranky caretaker Mr. Leshing (Marshall Bell), the house offers Nancy plenty of clues.
Where she can't seem to get a clue, it seems, is high school; in her prim plaid skirts, penny loafers, knee socks and matching headbands, Nancy is an anachronism, quickly eliciting the scorn of "cool" girls Inga (Daniella Monet) and Trish (Kelly Vitz), as well as the curiosity of precocious 12-year-old Corky (Josh Flitter). You don't have to be a detective to pick up traces of "Clueless," which, while good for a few laughs, feel like clunky afterthoughts.
Undaunted by the girls' derision, Nancy marches forward trying to solve Dehlia's murder. With Corky as her new sidekick and her old pal (and romantic prospect) Ned (Max Thieriot) in town for a visit, Nancy quickly uncovers Dehlia's long-lost child (Rachael Leigh Cook), the rightful heir to her mother's estate. But wait: Nancy must contend with menacing phone calls, side-swiping cars, false-bottom boxes, shadowy figures and yes, creaky boards before she's done.
Even the script's predictable plot contrivances might have been less egregious if the actors looked as if they were having some fun, but under helmer Fleming, the cast is as stiff as the dialogue. Roberts (TV's "Unfabulous") gets the look right, but her Nancy doesn't feel fully three-dimensional. Only Donovan and Barry Bostwick, in a small supporting role, inject some spark into their perfs.
Tech credits are fine, particularly Tony Fanning's production design for the musty Draycott mansion and Alexander Gruszynski's colorful lensing of Los Angeles. Ralph Sall's music, however, seems to have been pumped at full blast in order to cover for script deficiencies.

So lame it's . . . cool? Nancy Drew  , writer-director Andrew Fleming 's attempt to jump-start a new Warner Bros. franchise, is a movie flaunting an obvious demographic strategya teen flick with a sensibility, or at least sense of humor, that's most definitely parental.
Invented in 1930 by the same Stratemeyer syndicate that gave the world Tom Swift  and the Hardy Boys, the bold, intelligent, and well brought up Nancy sleuthed her way through some 60 mystery novelsmotoring around the Midwestern countryside in a blue roadster, amazing school chums with her perspicuity, and inspiring an international fan base whose self-identified members range from Ruth Bader Ginsburg  and Barbara Walters  to Fran Lebowitz  and Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
An eternal 16 until changes in the motor vehicles code mandated she turn 18, Nancy lived in Oedipal bliss with a doting fathermom having died long beforeand kept company with an equally adoring, somewhat dim, beau. The last time Warners brought Nancy to the screen, in the person of Bonita Granville , she was a scatterbrain; in her current incarnation, played by Emma Roberts  (niece of Julia), she's a perky, politely eye-rolling little know-it-all who, although a senior in high school, looks 14 and has the personality of an obnoxious, if fearless, 12-year-old.
This tweener goddessa virtual Batcave of handy accessories packed in her shoulder bagmay prove too annoying for general audiences, particularly as Roberts plays her comically straight. The movie derives much of its humor from the spectacle of Nancy's single-minded rectitude once she and dad (Tate Donovan ) relocate from River Heights to a spooky old mansion in the Hollywood Hills  where, 25 years before, the star Dehlia Draycott  met her mysterious demise. Nancy plunges headlong into that mystery as well as the world of Hollywood  High; there, she is the enigma, astounding the resident mean girls with her bulletproof Teflon  dweebishness.
Fleming has worked this territory before. Set in an L.A. parochial school and featuring a coven of teenage witches, The Craft  (1996) was a promising riot grrrl saga that midway through went all, like, moralistic; even funnier than it was puerile, Dick  (1999) imagined the Nixon  presidency brought down by a pair of ecstatically simpering 15-year-old ninnies. High school brings out the best in Fleming's mise-en-scenethe frame lovingly packed with representatives of every adolescent subculture.
Like Dick , if not to as richly comic effect, Nancy Drew  practices a form of dual address. Jokes like the girl detective's solemn announcement that she "recently discovered movies aren't shot from beginning to end" or casting Mulholland Drive  amnesiac Laura Elena Harring  as the resident dead movie star, are launched into a void well above the target audience's head. So too, Nancy's pedantic concern with historical anachronismespecially since she herself is a walking time capsule. ("Nothing sounds like vinyl," she declares at the onset of her suitably retro birthday party.)
In some respects, Fleming's two-track approach recalls the old Jay Ward  cartoonsCrusader Rabbit , Rocky & Bullwinkle , George of the Jungle , et al. Nancy herself resembles one of Ward's heroic nerds or super-smarties, spreading goodness as she single-handedly unravels a sinister cabal. Her character is inoculated against insufferability by the addition of a squat, amorous 12-year-old (Josh Flitter ), playing a whiny Sancho Panza  to Nancy's brainiac Quixote. "I wonder who tried to kill us?" she muses after a speeding SUV nearly flattens them. "I'm wondering too," he replies. "In fact, I'm kind of freaking out about it!!"
Unavoidably arch but essentially playful in its wit, Nancy Drew  neither wears out its welcome nor compromises its heroine. Nancy is unstoppable. By the movie's end, her trademark penny loafers and Sandra Dee  outfits have been officially pronounced fashionable, "the new sincerity." That's pretty much the idea of this 12-year-old superheroine, quotation marks and all.
