The strangest thing about Todd Haynes's new movie isn't that he cast six actors to play the various faces and phases of Bob Dylan. It's that he needed only six.
"I'm Not There" is an epic rock un-biopic, a work of staggering cinematic craft that's part jigsaw puzzle and part meditation on the mysteries of art and stardom. It's most definitely not about the man born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 in Duluth, Minn. Instead, it's about our idea of who Bob Dylan is, or should be, or how he's supposed to behave. And it's about how the artist who took that name was so deeply repelled by the notion that he - or anyone - can be pinned down with labels that he shed his skin again and again and again. Who's the real Bob Dylan? Check the title.
Haynes dramatizes this not through linear plot but in a heady, onrushing mosaic of scenes and images, loosely sewn together using Dylan songs in their original incarnations and in new cover versions (the two-disc tie-in CD is mostly terrific, but few of the cuts make it into the movie). What separates "I'm Not There" from a nostalgic waxwork like "Across the Universe" is its scrappy, mocking humor, celebrating and subverting the man and his era in the same breath.
Dylan was to celebrity what Picasso was to painting: He broke it open and viewed it from all sides simultaneously. (Bowie? Madonna? They're serving leftovers.) Each "new Dylan" was a betrayal of the one before it; the arrogance was part of the allure.
Consequently, you can't tell the players in "I'm Not There" without a scorecard. The movie begins by audaciously offering a portrait of the artist as a young black child (Marcus Carl Franklin), already telling tall tales of living the blues and crisscrossing America by freight train. The kid calls himself "Woody Guthrie" and like his Depression-era namesake carries a guitar case painted with the words "This machine kills fascists." A black southern housewife takes one look at him and says, "It's 1959. Find your own time, child."
So he metamorphoses into Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), the tormented "troubadour of conscience" of Greenwich Village's early '60s folk scene. Rollins in turn is played in a fictional Hollywood movie by a hip young actor named Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), who himself comes to represent Dylan the early '70s superstar. Robbie will marry Claire (a gracefully moving Charlotte Gainsbourg) and toy with domesticity, but the relationship blows up in his face just in time for "Blood on the Tracks" and the end of the Vietnam War.
There's more: In the movie's most electrifying turn, Cate Blanchett has been cast as Jude Quinn, a.k.a. Dylan at the mid-'60s peak of his powers. Jude's the one who takes the stage at Newport, machine-gunning the folkies with blistering rock 'n' roll, who tours England in a deepening haze of contempt and amphetamines, who baits journalists and is dubbed a Judas by enraged audiences.
The Jude scenes are so well done they make you giddy with delight and unease. Blanchett disappears into the role as eerily as she became Kate Hepburn a few years back: The pipe-cleaner legs, the masklike shades, what critic Janet Maslin once called the "fabulous corona of unkempt hair." This Dylan's a terrified jerk, teetering on the edge of self-immolation, and the music crashes out of him in torrents.
Hovering over the film is a fifth Dylan, a poet named Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw) who answers questions put to him by a bureaucratic subcommittee. These scenes feel both tangential and to the point - "There's something kinda freakish about setting a man onstage apart from all the rest" could serve as the movie's subtext - and the same could be said for the sixth Dylan, a retired Old West outlaw named Billy (Richard Gere).
Haynes shoots the Blanchett sequences in a gritty black and white (aping the look of D.A. Pennebaker's 1967 Dylan film "Don't Look Back," with a few nods to Fellini) and the Bale section as a sub-Scorsese rock doc, but the Billy scenes are done up as a 1970s revisionist western - Altman's "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" by way of "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid," in which the singer appeared. Some commentators have found the Gere bits the weakest link in "I'm Not There," but if you know the films and you love "The Basement Tapes," they can seem terribly emotional: a ramshackle mini-movie in which Dylan the weary recluse presides over the death of the hippie dream.
Fair question: Will any of this matter if the singer means little or nothing to you? Possibly not, although if you want to see our culture of celebrity engaged at its most primal level, or if you just enjoy supremely confident moviemaking, the film can't be dismissed. Don't expect easy listening, though. The experience of watching "I'm Not There" is almost exactly like that of being dropped into one of Dylan's knottiest, most epic songs - "Desolation Row," say.
Others have tried this approach and failed, notably Dylan himself with 1977's "Renaldo and Clara" and 2003's "Masked and Anonymous" (co-written by Dylan and directed by Larry Charles). But Dylan's not a filmmaker, and one man's art doesn't always translate to another man's medium. His songs unfold like movies, but his movies rarely sing.
Haynes, by contrast, was born with a camera in his hand and a cutting room in his head. His filmography is all over the map - the Barbie-doll puppet show of "Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story," the glam-rock idolatry of "Velvet Goldmine," the Hollywood-melodrama revisionism of "Far From Heaven" - but the throughlines are cinema, pop music, and the visualization of passionate, difficult ideas.
Bob-worship is passionate and difficult by definition, of course. Either Dylan takes up a sizable block of psychic real estate in your head or you think he sings like a goat. If you know the biographical basics - a few minutes of Googling will do the trick, or a visit with Scorsese's 2005 documentary "No Direction Home" - you'll be better equipped to appreciate Haynes's dumpster-diving: The wit of Julianne Moore's imperious Joan Baez impression, the goofiness of David Cross's Allen Ginsberg, Michelle Williams literally leading Jude up the garden path as the Edie-like Warhol socialite Coco Rivington.
As the above suggests, "I'm Not There" is an intentional patchwork, and more than once Haynes stoops to the obvious. (A lugubrious "Ballad of a Thin Man" music-video number is merely clever in the style of "Across the Universe.") Is there any other way to capture such restless reinvention, though? The movie's about a man habitually fleeing meaning for pure, irreducible essence, and it can be exhausting on a first viewing. On repeat visits, though, Haynes's vision grows in comedy and in depth, much the way a favorite album seeps into one's consciousness and then into one's very being.
Who knows? Maybe the whole thing is Dylan's life flashing before his eyes as the motorcycle crashes. Maybe it's another tall tale, or a manifesto on how to cope with fame in America through Cubist rebellion. One thing is clear: In its ambitions, its failures, its back-porch humor and bone-deep dread, "I'm Not There" feels like the most alive work to hit the screen in ages.


Just about every inspired film emerges out of some kind of obsession. The singular haunting beauty of I'm Not There , Todd Haynes' thrilling deep-vision meditation on the music and many lives of Bob Dylan, is that obsession isn't just its fuel  it's the movie's spirit and subject, its driving force. Haynes shoots way past love or worship. He's addicted  to Dylan, to his jingle-jangle sound and ornery grace, and he wants to lure you right inside that intoxication. Haynes splits Dylan into six different actors, leaping around key periods in his life from the late '50s through the early '80s (Allen Ginsberg, Edie Sedgwick, the Beatles, and Norman Mailer all amble through), and he treats the songs as a heavenly chorus. The moment you hear the spiky sweet propulsion of ''Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again'' over the opening credits, you're reminded that no one ever made pop music more incandescent than Bob Dylan. Haynes is out to find the source of that light, that mystery. And so he treats each moment, whether iconic (Dylan visiting the dying Woody Guthrie; his electric-folk revolution at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival) or intimate (like the dissolution of his first marriage), as a reality to be riffed on, toyed with. I'm Not There  is a fantasia, a tell-all, a biopic that's all high points, a folk-rock essay, and a dream, all wrapped into one. It plays like the headiest musical ever made.
Haynes, whose last film was the great Far From Heaven  (2002), may be the only director alive who can stage a movie as a brain-tickling semiotic experiment and still pack every frame with flesh-and-blood passion. In design, I'm Not There  is a trip through the ''masks'' and identities Bob Dylan wore and discarded (sometimes without even knowing it), and Haynes layers and connects those images with nimble, fun-loving trickery. Dylan starts off as an 11-year-old black kid (the witty young Marcus Carl Franklin uncannily mimics Dylan's sidelong grin and faux-dust-bowl drawl), already trying on a personality as if it were a suit of clothes; he rides the rails, passing himself off as a troubadour named Woody. In his Greenwich Village coffeehouse days, Dylan is played by Christian Bale as Jack Rollins, folkie and civil rights protest singer  a close gloss on the real thing. But then we see a cornball 1965 Hollywood version of the Jack Rollins story called Grain of Sand , starring a hot young actor in the Dean/Brando mold named Robbie (Heath Ledger). Robbie becomes a version of Dylan (got it?), as we trace the collapse of his marriage to an artist played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. And I haven't even mentioned Cate Blanchett, under Wayfarers and frizzy hair, who does a spectacular, soul-on-the-sleeve enactment of Dylan in his Don't Look Back  media-put-on phase. Blanchett makes Dylan a cussed dude who uses his wit to wound, and Haynes' slyest joke is that the actress, from her lurching marionette posture to her boyish cheekbones to her slurry misanthropic mumble, is the film's most exquisitely spot-on Bob.
In I'm Not There , every aspect of Dylan's life  singer, icon of cool, walled-off pop star, even failed husband  is a role, a concoction, and thus his aura of authenticity is the least authentic thing about him. Haynes wants us to experience the ''real'' Dylan as a spirit, a force larger than all his images, as he is passed from one actor to the next. Yet none of the gamesmanship would mean much if I'm Not There  didn't present Dylan in such an intensely personal way. The divorce scenes singe your heart  it's the boomers, after the '60s, falling from grace. Blanchett's Dylan, sparring with a British journalist (Bruce Greenwood), is an overworked, pill-popping narcissist whose agony is the knowledge that every word that defines him  ''protest,'' ''folk singer,'' ''authentic''  turns to sham the moment it's heard from the mouth of the media. Richard Gere, in the Edenic backwater Missouri green, plays a fanciful version of Dylan in his Basement Tapes /roving-outlaw wilderness days, and if this is the one section of the movie that's too vague, it's also elusively sad. One feels a redemption of the most ironic kind when Bale shows up as the born-again Christian Bob, singing the transcendent (if little-known) song ''Pressing On'' to a rec-room congregation in the early '80s.
What's finally so moving about I'm Not There  is that it's a story of loss. Dylan, as the film portrays him, is a revolutionary who loses his innocence, his idealism, his wife and family, his connection to his audience, his sanity, even his dog. He finds no direction home. Yet the ultimate thing that's lost is what his music is  and Dylan, in the sublime final moments, is right to say that we always knew it wasn't ''folk.'' It's something holy and unnameable and beautiful and pure. I'm Not There  lets you hear it again, more majestically than ever.

 From Andy Warhol to Lonelygirl15, modern media culture thrives on the traffic in counterfeit selves. In this world the greatest artist will also be, almost axiomatically, the biggest fraud. And looking back over the past 50 years or so, it is hard to find anyone with a greater ability to synthesize authenticity — to give his serial hoaxes and impersonations the ring of revealed and esoteric truth — than Bob Dylan.  It’s not just that Robert Zimmerman, a Jewish teenager growing up in Eisenhower-era Minnesota, borrowed a name from a Welsh poet and the singing style of an Oklahoma Dust Bowl troubadour and bluffed his way into the New York folk scene. That was chutzpah. What followed was genius — the elaboration of an enigmatic, mercurial personality that seemed entirely of its moment and at the same time connected to a lost  agrarian past. From the start, Mr. Dylan has been singularly adept at channeling and recombining various strands of the American musical and literary vernacular, but he has often seemed less like an interpreter of those traditions than like their incarnation.  His persona has been as inclusive as Walt Whitman’s and as unsettlingly splintered as that of Herman Melville’s Confidence Man. Vulnerable as Mr. Dylan is to misunderstanding (“I couldn’t believe after all these years/You didn’t know me better than that” in “Idiot Wind”), he also actively solicits it (“Something is happening here/But you don’t know what it is/Do you, Mr. Jones?” in “Ballad of a Thin Man”). So it is only fitting that Todd Haynes, in “I’m Not There,” his incandescent rebus of a movie inspired by Mr. Dylan’s life and music, has chosen to multiply puzzles and paradoxes rather than solve them. Not for nothing does one of Mr. Haynes’s stories take place in a town called Riddle.  Among its many achievements, Mr. Haynes’s film hurls a Molotov cocktail through the facade of the Hollywood biopic factory, exploding the literal-minded, anti-intellectual assumptions that guide even the most admiring cinematic explorations of artists’ lives. Rather than turn out yet another dutiful, linear chronicle of childhood trauma and grown-up substance abuse, Mr. Haynes has produced a dizzying palimpsest of images and styles, in which his subject appears in the form of six different people.  Not one is named Bob Dylan (or Robert Zimmerman), though all of them evoke actual and invented points in the Dylan cosmos: Billy the Kid, Woody Guthrie, the Mighty Quinn. They’re not all musicians: One is a poet named Arthur Rimbaud; another is a movie star.  These divergent visions of Dylan are played by two different Australians (Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett); a young British actor (Ben Whishaw); a prepubescent African-American named Marcus Carl Franklin; Richard Gere; and the most recent Batman. Their stories collide and entwine, adding up to an experience that is as fascinating and inexhaustible as listening to “Blood on the Tracks” or “The Basement Tapes.”  It is unusual to see a masterwork emerge from one artist’s absorption with the work of another, though Mr. Haynes came close with “Far From Heaven,” his 2002 homage to the director Douglas Sirk. And while “I’m Not There” is immersed in Dylanology, it is more than a document of scholarly preoccupation or fan obsession.  Devotees of Dylan lore will find their heads swimming with footnotes, as they track Mr. Haynes’s allusions not only to Mr. Dylan’s own music but also to the extensive secondary literature it has inspired, from books by David Hajdu and Greil Marcus to films, including D. A. Pennebaker’s 1967 documentary, “Don’t Look Back,” some of which Mr. Haynes remakes shot for shot.  But the film is anything but dry, and like Mr. Dylan’s best songs, it is at once teasingly arcane and bracingly plain-spoken. Mr. Haynes, switching styles, colors, film stocks and editing rhythms with unnerving ease (and with the crucial help of Jay Rabinowitz and Edward Lachman, the editor and the director of photography), has held his cerebral and his visceral impulses in perfect balance. “I’m Not There” respects the essential question Mr. Dylan’s passionate followers have always found themselves asking — What does it mean? — without forgetting that the counter-question Mr. Dylan has posed is more challenging and, for a movie, more important: How does it feel?  As you watch the mid-’60s renegade folk singer Jude Quinn — embodied in Ms. Blanchett’s hunched, skinny frame and photographed in silvery Nouvelle Vague black and white — pinball through swinging London, subsisting on amphetamines, Camel straights and gnomic talk, it feels like a pop earthquake. The ’60s, man! As Mr. Ledger’s character and his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) meet, marry and fall apart, it feels like the heartbreaking aftermath of a moment of high promise and possibility. (That would be the ’70s.)  Riding the rails in 1959 with a pint-size, wisecracking hobo who calls himself Woody Guthrie (Mr. Franklin) and saddling up with Mr. Gere’s Billy the Kid in Riddle, Mo., in the 19th century, you feel a piercing nostalgia for a pastoral America that probably  existed only in legend. With Christian Bale, playing a star of the Greenwich Village coffeehouse scene who resurfaces as a Pentecostal minister in Los Angeles years later, you experience a prickle of confusion and morbid curiosity. As it all unfolds, there may be other feelings too, including awe at the quality of the performances and occasional exasperation at Mr. Haynes’s sprawling, hectic virtuosity.  Still, I would not subtract a minute of this movie, or wish it any different. Nor do I anticipate being finished with “I’m Not There” anytime soon, since, like “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” it invites endless interpretation, criticism and elaboration. Instead of proposing a definitive account of Bob Dylan’s career, Mr. Haynes has used that career as fuel for a wide-ranging (and, if you’ll permit me, freewheeling) historical inquiry into his own life and times. In spite of its title, “I’m Not There” is a profoundly, movingly personal film, passionate in its engagement with the mysteries of the recent past.  “Live in your own time.” That’s the advice young “Woody Guthrie” hears from a motherly woman who offers him a hot meal and a place to sleep. It’s sensible advice — he’s daydreaming of the Depression in the middle of the space age — but also useless. It’s not as if anyone has a choice. To slog through the present requires no particular wit, vision or art. But a certain kind of artist will comb through the old stuff that’s lying around — the tall tales and questionable memories,  the yellowing photographs and scratched records —  looking for glimpses of a possible future. Though there’s a lot of Bob Dylan’s music in “I’m Not There,” Mr. Haynes is not simply compiling golden oldies. You hear familiar songs, but what you see is the imagination unleashed —  the chimes of freedom flashing.  “I’m Not There” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).   It has sex, swearing, brief violence and drug use.

A densely idiosyncratic, cubist-like cinematic portrait of a man who often calls to mind Bob Dylan, Todd Haynes' "I'm Not There" resembles a film a precocious grad student in musicology might make about a creative hero. Stylistically audacious in the way it employs six different actors and assorted visual styles to depict various aspects of the troubadour's life and career, the film nevertheless lacks a narrative and a center, much like the "ghost" at its core. Dylan fans and '60s-era pop-culture mavens will constitute pic's most reliable audience, as mainstream interest will remain unstirred.
Haynes' unconventional approach to biography was no doubt the reason this became the first project about Dylan's life anointed by the man himself, who allowed the use of his songs, both in original form and in covers. Dylan's own taste in cinematic ventures has been questionable over the years, but "I'm Not There" is decisively superior to "Masked & Anonymous."
As it jumps around in time and explores assorted Dylan personae backed by one of the 20th century's most impressive greatest-hits collections, "I'm Not There" is never dull and rarely aggravating. Some of Haynes' most daring ideas -- such as having the youthful, Woody Guthrie-idolizing Dylan portrayed by an 11-year-old black boy, and expressing the impact of the Dylan-goes-electric Newport concert by having the singer and his band literally machine-gun the folky audience -- come off surprisingly well, and the general let's-try-this approach is broached in such a genial manner that it encourages the viewer to abandon any preconceptions and follow where Haynes leads.
Such open-mindedness is further spurred by the first "Dylan," who receives significant screentime. Young Marcus Carl Franklin is charmingly forthright as a guitar-toting kid who, in 1959, rides the rails, '30s-style, and identifies himself as Guthrie when he doesn't claim to be Arthur Rimbaud. Little "Woody" is admired for his talent wherever he travels, until he is upbraided one day by a wise lady who admonishes him to "Live in your own time."
And so he does, materializing in Greenwich Village in the guise of "Jack" (Christian Bale) and taking the progressive music scene by storm with "The Times They Are A-Changin' " and other early gems.
At this stage, pic begins to fracture itself, for good and ill. Heath Ledger turns up as "Robbie," a moody actor who stars as a Dylan-like figure in a Hollywood film called "Grain of Sand." A docu format reminiscent of Martin Scorsese's "No Direction Home" takes over to accommodate straight-to-camera interviews with the likes of former intimate Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore), and the verite vein persists in an attempt to explain why Jack cut his ties with the protest movement shortly after JFK's assassination, around the time Robbie meets painter Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).
Getting it on with Claire to the strains of "I Want You," Robbie, in a charming scene, takes her to the country to pick up a motorcycle, and they eventually marry and have two kids.
The film suddenly jolts to life at the 40-minute mark with the cataclysmic New England Jazz & Folk Festival; not only is the music now plugged in, but the central figure, "Jude," is impersonated by Cate Blanchett. Scrawny, her eyes often concealed by large shades and topped by a curly mop identical to Dylan's at the time of "Don't Look Back," Blanchett is, appropriately enough, truly electrifying at first; she's uncannily got down the skittish movements, wary eyes, curt mumble and occasional flashes of brilliance, and comes far closer than anyone else to approximating the Dylan the public knows.
As the performance goes on -- it's by a fair distance the dominant turn in the picture, both in impact and duration -- and the character becomes increasingly wigged out by drugs and paranoia, the reliance on mannerisms over psychological depth becomes more apparent. Still, Blanchett's casting and performance rep a daring coup, and she can now rightly claim to be the only thesp on Earth ever to have been asked to channel both Bob Dylan and Katharine Hepburn, and to have done so successfully.
Jude's British tour and associated events provide the core and highlight of "I'm Not There," due to a combination of Blanchett; the encounters with notables such as Allen Ginsberg and the Beatles (in a throwaway, "A Hard Day's Night"-style gag); the visual elan Haynes and lenser Edward Lachman achieve in black-and-white by subtly segueing in style from D.A. Pennebaker and Richard Lester to the sleeker, swinging-London look of John Schlesinger's "Darling"; Jude's seemingly futile pursuit of an elusive Edie Sedgwick-type blonde named Coco (Michelle Williams); his defiance in the face of audience fury at his new sound; and the probings of an intelligent journalist (an excellent Bruce Greenwood), intent upon exposing Jude as a fraud.
Unfortunately, after steadily gaining steam and conviction through its midsection, the film grinds to a virtual halt when it again radically shifts focus to gaze upon "Billy" (Richard Gere), a reclusive mountain man intent upon leaving behind a celebrated and/or notorious past. This interlude clearly reflects not only on Dylan but on Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid," in which Dylan played a supporting part.
Meant to echo both Peckinpah and "McCabe & Mrs. Miller," this unduly protracted section is poorly conceived on every level, as it dramatizes and contributes nothing. Impossible as it no doubt would have been to eliminate a star like Gere from the picture, the end result unquestionably would have been superior without this meandering Western material, for which Haynes seems to have no feel.
Having hit this crossroads and proceeded down the wrong path, pic more or less stumbles the rest of the way, as do the various Dylan incarnations. Only a final, haunting closeup image of the real Dylan in performance brings things fleetingly back to life.
Dylan freaks and scholars will have the most fun with "I'm Not There," and there will inevitably be innumerable dissertations on the ways Haynes has both reflected and distorted reality, mined and manipulated the biographical record and otherwise had a field day with the essentials, as well as the esoterica, of Dylan's life. All of this will serve to inflate the film's significance by ignoring its lack of more general accessibility. In the end, it's a specialists' event.
Production looks and sounds great. Montreal-area locations superbly stand in for such diverse settings as the northeastern U.S., London and environs, and Paris, a tribute as well to production designer Judy Becker. Costume designs by John Dunn, along with makeup, hair and assorted accoutrements, provide further crucial period verisimilitude, and the use of Dylan's music is intelligent and invigorating.
"I'm Not There" may not be all there, but it doubtless provides lots to talk about.

I'm Not There  is the movie of the yearbut to whom does Todd Haynes 's Bob Dylan  biopic actually belong, and when was it really made?
The great attention-grabber of last month's New York Film Festival , I'm Not There  is as notable for its stunt casting as its elusive subject. It's Six Actors in Search of the Great White Wonder. Half a dozen performers of assorted age, race, gender, and prominence play the variously named protagonistwho is introduced by a stand-in for the poet Arthur Rimbaud  as a corpse on a slab: "God rest his soul. . . . Even the ghost was more than one person."
I'm Not There  shows a showbiz life falling apart and reconstituting itself multiple times, but it's not anything like The Bob Dylan Story . His name is never uttered.

On first viewing, there seems to be no particular form. This is a dense film with an all-over free-associational structure. The characteristic means of advance is two steps forward, a dipsy-doodle step back, and a flying leap into the future. As Haynes's 135-minute phantasmagoria rolls on toward closure, the oldest of its Dylan figures hops a freight train along with the youngestso it must be yet another one who crashes his motorcycle by the tracks. Meanwhile, the flaming electrified Dylan of 1966 dies of a drug overdose, floating over London as the actual Dylan "posthumously" croaks the movie's haunting title songa 1967 "Basement Tape" session which, until this movie, existed only as a bootleg.
How to explain the film's jokes and allusions? The glimpse of the street musician Moondog on Sixth Avenue? The meaning of veteran folkie Richie Havens  singing "Tombstone Blues" on the porch of a sharecropper's shack? The tortuous Black Panther explication of "Ballad of a Thin Man"? Small wonder that one enthusiastic Film Comment ator has compared I'm Not There  to Finnegans Wake .
This isn't the first time that Haynes, who studied film as semiotics, has taken pop stars or pop music for a text. He established his reputation in the late '80s as the co-author of Superstar , a Super-8 tour de force that wrung maximum pathos from the tale of Karen Carpenter  by using a cast of Barbie dolls . A decade later, Velvet Goldmine probably the most cerebral rock 'n' roll movie ever madeproposed glam rock as a Dionysian religion with a David Bowie like androgyne as its cynical high priest.
I'm Not There  is doggedly pop-modernist in its layered, nonlinear, postCitizen Kane  structure and strategically applied Dylanology. The viewer is invited to search for the author's footnotes as well as the subject's fingerprints. Quotation merges with invention. A tarantula crawls through it. Original recordings mix with covers. The title is made literal by Haynes's subtitle: The Lives  and Time  of Bob Dylan . The lives are his. The timehowever chronologically skewedis ours.

A discreet fellow, to the business born (his father was the accountant to Dylan's legendary first manager, Albert Grossman ), Rosen opened the vaults to issue the multi-CD "Bootleg Series" in the early '90s and produced the 2004 Scorsese-signed documentary No Direction Home ; he encouraged the publication of Dylan's memoirs and the unfortunate Twyla Tharp  ballet; he not only facilitated I'm Not There  but the release of several archival documentaries.
Thus, as Haynes's film opens at Film Forum, D.A. Pennebaker  will premiere an hour's worth of outtakes from his 1967 Dylan portrait, Don't Look Back , at the IFC Center , and the Walter Reade  will run Murray Lerner 's The Other Side of Mirror , a straightforward documentary of Dylan's mid-'60s appearances at three consecutive Newport Folk Festivals.
Is it all too much? Following the New York Film Festival press screening of I'm Not There , I walked to the subway with a post-'60s, European-born film programmer. She could appreciate I'm Not There  as a Todd Haynes film, but the Dylan minutiae was a baffling source of irritation.
Can one communicate the significance that Haynes takes as a given? The best sense may be found in a two-page story written by a man who very likely never heard of Dylan. In "Everything and Nothing," Jorge Luis Borges  writes of an artist who has "no one inside him" and whose words, "which were multitudinous, and of a fantastical and agitated turn," suggested "a dream someone had failed to dream." To understand that dream and Dylan's importance to his audience of dreamers, catch The Other Side of the Mirror .
Something Dylan always resisted making, The Other Side of the Mirror  is a pure performance film. But it is also a three-act drama. In 1963, a 22-year-old lad turns up at Newport  as a mysteriously accomplished folk revivalist. The movie opens during an afternoon workshop with solemn Bob  performing his original iron-mining dirge, "North Country Blues," on a stage crowded with other folkies. Chanteuse Judy Collins stares fixedly into space; old time banjo-picker Roscoe Holcombhimself a former coal minerlooks baffled. Not for the last time is somebody wondering: Who is this nasal-voiced kid, and where did he come from?
